<PRE>                              THELMA AND LOUISE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a cross-country chase film with
     a strong feminist subtext.  Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis
     find themselves in a life of crime in a world with little
     support from the opposite sex.  Rating: high +1 [-4 to +4].</PRE>
<P>     Thelma and Louise have had it.  Thelma (played by Geena Davis) is
something somewhere between a housewife and a household appliance.  Her
husband bullies her, cheats on her, and treats her like dirt.  Louise has it
a little better as an unmarried waitress with a foul-tempered boyfriend.
The two of them want just to get away for a weekend and do a little fishing.
Then, after an evening in a bar, Thelma is almost raped and Louise has shot
the rapist.  Suddenly the two are on the run from the law, a situation they
find both exhilarating and terrifying.  Thelma has never been allowed to
think for herself.  Now that she is free and thinking, it is not surprising
that her decisions are not very well thought-out and generally get the two
deeper into trouble.  In a sense this is a coming-of-age film about Thelma.</P>
<P>     At least superficially, this is a story that has been done many times
before.  The sympathetic characters start with a little fun, enrage the law,
and eventually are being chased by regiments of law enforcement officers.
Yes, the film does have car chases and hair-breadth escapes and the usual
scenes of police cars cork-screwing through the air and crashing.  Take away
the subtext and you have a very cliched film.  The subtext, however, makes
this a very strong little propaganda film.  There are a lot of men in this
film and only one man is decent and another is decent when he is not having
a temper tantrum.  Jimmy, Louise's boyfriend, does prove to have redeeming
features.  And Hal, the policeman tracking Thelma and Louise, manages to
understand every wall of the box the two of them are in.  Hall is more
interested in saving the two from harm than he is in catching them.  If this
film has a hero, it is Hal.  But every hunk Thelma tries to pick up only
makes things worse.  Truck drivers on the road are sexist pigs.  And
Thelma's husband Daryl is a real piece of work.</P>
<P>     Ridley Scott's direction is good in the human interaction scenes if
rather cliched in the action scenes.  The photography of the great Southwest
is certainly visually stunning.  Still, the film's message about feminism
and, in general, freedom comes on a little strong.  While the rapist
certainly has none of the audience's sympathy, killing him seems
unnecessary.  We want to see his attitudes and behavior punished, but like
Louise, we have strong second thoughts as to whether his crimes deserve the
death penalty.</P>
<P>     In any case, this may be one of the most intelligent cross-country
chase films.  I give it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
