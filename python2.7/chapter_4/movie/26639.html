Susan Granger's review of "BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2" (Artisan)</PRE>
<P>  It's marketing vs. movie-making. Last weekend, the newest
installment in this media phenomenon saturated 3000 screens in the
U.S. and about 1000 screens overseas, almost double the normal amount
for a wide-release movie. That generates a huge box-office tally but
doesn't truly tell the tale. The original used the Internet to spread
the fake-but-funky horror story about aspiring film students who
vanished in Maryland's Black Hills. This time, it's saturation
booking. Documentary film-maker Joe Berlinger begins with what's
happened to Burkittsville, where a local entrepreneur and former
mental patient (Jeffrey Donovan) guides hiking tours through the
supposedly haunted woods to the utter frustration of the Sheriff
(Lanny Flaherty), who bellows, "There is no goddamn Blair Witch!"
Nevertheless, four intrepid campers take off: a preacher's daughter
who fancies herself a white magic Wiccan (Erica Leershen), a Goth
psychic (Kim Director), a cocky writer (Stephen Turner) who is
determined to expose the Blair Witch as mass hysteria and his
troubled, pregnant girl-friend (Tristen Skyler). The body count mounts
as a competing tour crosses their path, along with sex, lies and
endless videotaping, culminating in a Civil War-era factory. To evoke
fear, Berlinger relies on standard slasher shocks, gore, nudity, and a
guitar-metal soundtrack, all quite reminiscent of the "Scream"
franchise. As a result, the characters are stock stereotypes, the
dialogue's banal and there's no tension. On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is a thudding 2. Perhaps
there really is a Blair Witch curse to wreak havoc on the third
installment, a "prequel," being made by the co-directors Eduardo
Sanchez and Daniel Myrick from the original, Orlando-based Haxan
Films.</P>
