<P>   Irving Berlin knew that there's no business like show
business and Bill Condon does his bit to prove it.  In one
scene of "Gods and Monsters," Condon's fanciful and
splendidly realized adaptation about the last days of
"Frankenstein" director James Whale, the impresario of horror
insists that there's no joy in the world that compares to that of
directing films.  Condon creates an inventive tale of this
important figure's views, work and memories. And why not? 
In 1957 his subject was found dead in his pool like "Sunset
Boulevard"'s Norma Desmond.  His departure was listed as
"under mysterious circumstances."  Since Whale was a
practicing gay in a Hollywood that looked askance at such
behavior, the old man is indeed a subject worthy of
biographical inquiry.  Christopher Bram covered his life story
in his book "Father of Frankenstein," which forms the basis of
Condon's screenplay.</P>
<P>   Unlike the conventional biopic "Without Limits" about track
athlete Steve Prefontaine, "Gods and Monsters" does not play
to the grandstands.  It unfolds instead as a mostly serene
probing of the director's mind in his final days, a period
highlighted by his recollections of a better time and by an
unusual friendship between him and the young man he hires
to mow his lawn.  The victim of a stroke which left his motor
ability untouched but which caused neurological electrical
storms in his brain, Whale was confronted daily with the
choice of taking a prescribed drug which zonked him out or of
avoiding the medicine, which caused his mind to go off in a
hundred directions.  Like the stroke-afflicted character Emily
Stilson in Arthur Kopit's play "Wings," Whale endures an
ailment which causes  memories, both pleasurable and
distressing, to flood his faculties.  Through a brief, unusual
friendship with a working-class stiff, he recalls his direction of
Elsa Lanchester as the "Bride of Frankenstein" while Condon
frequently breaks away from the narrative to offer up snippets
of scenes from that accomplishment.  </P>
<P>   The film is superbly acted by Ian McKellen, one of the
world's foremost thesps, who is encased in a large home on
California's Pacific Palisades but has lost his capacity to
enjoy.  He looks in the mirror at his old but distinguished
features, runs a comb slowly and lovingly through his silky
white hair, and for the most part appears to us as a
mellowed-out venerable chap.  His calm makes his bursts of
rage all the more alarming, as in Condon's imaginative view
he taunts a robust young man, begging to be killed.  Such
moments of privacy are rare as he is under the watchful eye
of his servant of fifteen years, the Hungarian-born Hanna--
who is portrayed as woman with unconsciously comic
repartee by  Lynn Redgrave, made over to look about seventy
years of age and wearing a perpetual scowl.</P>
<P>   In an unusual and marginally dangerous bit of casting,
Brendan Fraser, known to a large audience as a sweet, comic
personality in "George of the Jungle" and "Encino Man,"
provides the catalyst for the older man's reveries.  Handsome
and muscular, Clayton Boone (Fraser), a drifter who accepts
odd jobs in tony California neighborhoods, could not help
reviving Whale's dormant sexuality, belying a popular view
that senior citizens do not think of sex.  Rather, as one
knowing person suggests, they think of nothing BUT sex. 
Boone poses for Whale's sketches, at first seeming to tolerate
his new employer's homosexual background ("live and let
live") but soon becomes enraged when the man makes ribald
suggestions about the armies of folks who'd cavort naked
under his roof and at his swimming pool.</P>
<P>   Director Bill Condon seamlessly weaves visions of the old
man's fancy into his drama of his subject's deterioration,
following clips from "Bride of Frankenstein" with a
reenactment of Whale's direction of the movie.  He creates a
mood that lets us imagine what it might be like to be going
through a neurological crisis, blending 1950s reality with the
moviemaking of the 1930s.  It does not take long to realize
that the muscular Brendan Fraser is pictured by Whale as the
Frankenstein monster, a creature who is treated
sympathetically and with a great dry wit in Whale's movies. 
The monster is the lonely outsider in a world he can scarcely
understand.  In Condon's most comical scene, Whale
embarrasses gay director George Cukor and Princess
Margaret at a house party by introducing his gardener--like
the monster, an outsider to this milieu--which we see as one
of Whale's futile attempts to break through his own
vulnerability.  </P>
<P>   Money isn't everything.  Like "Sunset Boulevard"'s Norman
Desmond, Whale is shown to lack nothing in material
comforts.  But he no longer uses the pool, which was the
locus of so much of his enjoyment in his earlier days.  His
career junked two decades back with the failure of his movie
"The Road Back," Whale might as well be living in the
England of his childhood, a youth of poverty whose diet
consisted of drippings.  Ian McKellen, who cannot turn in a
bad performance, is quietly riveting throughout, no longer the
misanthrope of Christopher Bram's novel but a sympathetic
soul who justifiably captivates our compassion.  Not Rated.
