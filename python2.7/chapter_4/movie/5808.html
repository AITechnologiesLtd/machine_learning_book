<P>Made both for children and grownups, plain funny or darkly funny in its 
depiction of downtrodden kids, "Matilda" will please all, disturb no 
one. It comes from a story by Roald Dahl whose fantasies were the source 
of  "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" and "The Witches." "Matilda" 
is fairy tale-ish enough to be unfrightening to youngsters and 
un-subverting to adults--unless the latter are as caricaturally stupid, 
uncultured, vulgar and insensitive as the crummy parents of charming 
Matilda.</P>
<P>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood dress horribly, talk dumbly, are concerned 
only with the most dubious blessings of suburbia and materialism. But 
they are very funny in a "yeech!" way. He is a used-car dealer of 
Himalayan dishonesty. He cheats the sellers, gives them a pittance, then 
scotch-tapes and camouflages the cars which he resells for 
thousands.There is nothing in him of the relative warmth of, say, 
car-dealer Ted Danson in the neglected "Made in America." As Harry also 
deals in stolen car parts, the FBI is stalking him. One of the two 
agents is Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) in a small role.</P>
<P>The most interesting thing about Harry may get lost in the shuffle as 
the story concentrates on the title character. Harry is not merely a 
felon and a mega-crook, but a creature who finds blissful, almost erotic 
thrills in his accomplishments, a man who waxes ecstatically 
self-congratulatory about his skills, the con-man as an artist.</P>
<P>The Wormwoods have two children, a boy sketchily used and undeveloped in 
the film, and their younger daughter. Matilda is like one of those 
characters in popular lore on whom a fairy godmother bestowed supreme 
intelligence. She is mentally so precocious that it makes her a junior 
version of John Travolta in "Phenomenon." Her self-absorbed, loutish 
parents are unaware of her genius as well as of everything else 
concerning the girl. </P>
<P>In her bookless house Matilda teaches herself to read. Discovering the 
public library, this junior Wormwood becomes a Bookwormwood, goes 
through hundreds of volumes, mostly novels for grownups. A shot of her, 
sitting on the grass abd devouring a book while on the other side of a 
wire fence, children are playing, sums her up beautifully, even 
touchingly.</P>
<P>When Harry finally notices the books his reaction is:" What d'ya want a 
book for? There's nothing you can get from a book that you can't get 
from televison faster." Their living-room TV set, always on, is, by the 
way, stolen goods. While watching it that Matilda discovers that she 
also has the power of telekinesis and of making things explode.</P>
<P>Matilda would the embodiment of neglected (though not abused) children, 
were it not for comic exaggeratiions. At age six-and-a-half she tells 
her folks that she should have been in school, a notion that never 
crossed the Wormwoods' minds. Especially as they vaguely believe (when 
forced to think) that Matilda is still four! Additionally, as Harry says 
"If you go to school, who will sign for the packages?" The place is 
piled high with containers of illegal car parts.</P>
<P>Finally Matilda does go to a private establishment in a gloomy mansion 
whose principal, nicknamed Miss Trunchbull, is a sadistic monster. 
"Aaaah. Newcomers! Fresh Meat!" she says to herself. Miss T. was a 
shot-put, javelin and hammer throw champion at the 1972 Olympics. These 
were the games where Israeli athletes were assassinated in Munich. While 
Miss T., played by a British actress, has no national identity, she is 
built like a Walkyrie, wears a kind of paramilitary uniform and may well 
have been inspired by the infamous SS, Ilse Koch, The Bitch of 
Buchenwald, down to jackboots and riding crop.</P>
<P>I won't give away how she still practices her sports on the terrified 
pupils, how she affirms her authority, what is the special punishment 
room called "The Cruncher," what one of her dark secrets is, etc.etc. 
Enough to say that one of the signs in her school reads :"If You Are 
Having Fun Learning, You Are Not Learning."</P>
<P>Matilda, who is most appealing, lovable and (among other things) a 
mathematical genius with a computer mind, rapidly bonds with the much 
put-upon teacher Miss Honey (the name says it all). Miss Honey also has 
a deep dark secret.  She visits the Wormwoods and realizes what creeps 
they are. Miss Honey and Matilda become allies and defeat the Principal, 
with no small thanks to Matilda's increasing powers to move and levitate 
objects and people. Not in gory, vengeful fashion like Sissy Spacek in 
"Carrie," but 
nicely and constructively, for the common weal.</P>
<P>The special effects for all this can get a bit tiresome, but they are 
just a gnat in the ointment of this satirical, farcical, blackly 
humorous tale. The balance among characters is finely tuned. At one 
extreme are Matilda's family and the school principal. At the other, the 
mellifluous ("mel" means "honey" in Latin) Miss Honey. At the center, 
always perfectly normal in personality and character is Matilda, played 
with confidence, natural wisdom and mischievousness by the young actress 
of "Mrs. Doubtfire."</P>
<P>DeVito and Perlman, married to each other in real life, must have drawn 
inspiration from their experiences and observations. Though howlingly 
grotesque, they achieve, in a paradoxical tour-de-force, a basic level 
of believability that makes the children's triumph over nastiness even 
more satisfactory.</P>
