<PRE>Phantoms
Directed by Joe Chappelle
Starring: Peter O'Toole, Ben Affleck, Rose McGowan, Joanna Going, Liev 
Schrieber
Screenplay by Dean Koontz, based on his novel</PRE>
<P>Though "Phantoms", a current horror, sci-fi release, has nothing to do 
with th 1987 comedy "Planes Trains and Automobiles", I am struck with a 
line from the latter that really sums everything up. When Steve Martin is 
berating John Candy, he says, "Oh, and when you're telling these stories, 
here's an idea....have a point! It makes it so much more interesting for 
the listener!" Apparently, Mr. Koontz wasn't listening.</P>
<P>"Phantoms" spends its first thiry minutes confusing the hell out of the 
viewer, making us ask, "what could possibly be responsible for all this 
grisly death?". Perhaps if anyone in Hollywood was creative enough to 
create a reasonable answer to that question, then this might be a 
worthwhile film, but deep inside, we know no one is good enough to write 
themselves out of this one. "Phantoms" has so many problems, plot holes, 
and inconsistencies that it is hard to know where to start. So I'll start 
with the lame characters. Two sisters (Rose McGowan and Joanna Going) 
wander into this town to find everyone mysteriously dead. The entire town 
has been wiped out, and yet they bump into the sheriff and two officers. 
I won't even ask why they're ok. They explore this town, becoming 
increasingly creeped out and realize that bodies are disappearing, 
strange noises are emenating from the phone, (why? No clue.) and nasty 
animals lurk outside, waiting to suck the life out of you. In 
desperation, Sheriff Affleck makes a radio call for help but the receiver 
says that they can't hear the message. Funny, then, how some mysterious 
task force shows up to this dinky town in their white ultra-protecto 
suits to solve the problem. Why these sisters have anything to do with 
the story is beyond me. They never contribute. Affleck is a former FBI 
agent who's haunted past is his ONLY reason for being a part of this 
story, and when Peter O'Toole comes in, you just know that no one in 
Hollywood remembers that this man is a professional and deserves better 
scripts. </P>
<P>Of course, this is a mysterious being from the depths of the Earth's 
core, and there is one man who has studied it extensively. Apparently, he 
was laughed at by his colleagues, and now he is a tabloid writer. This 
underground superspeicies knows who he is and wants him to come 
investigate, so he shows up in his own white ultra-protecto suit. (The 
suits, by the way, don't provide any protection, but at this point, who 
cares?) This tabloid writer turned Earth Savior is played by Peter 
O'Toole. O'Toole fills in the gang that this is a creature that feeds off 
the life and intelligence of the humans it sucks down. It has been around 
since the begining of time, "this thing was responsible for the end of 
the dinosaurs!" he proclaims. It seems this super creature has consumed 
someone who has seen "Alien" and got the idea that popping out of corpses 
mouths and devouring other people is a cool monster move.</P>
<P>Why this creature is here, why it choses this tiny town to start it's 
Earth-conquering quest, why it has managed to elude the history books and 
scientists (EXCEPT for Mr. O'Toole), why one character keeps popping up 
as a living corpse controlled by part of this creature,  and why Koontz 
thought this would be an interesting film is beyond me. NONE of these 
questions are answered at any time. Director Joe Chappelle did a supreme 
job of showcasing his amaturish director devices. He builds tension with 
slow movements towards some door, has the music heighten, the close up on 
the character's face, the shot of the hand about to open the door and 
"bam!"...nothing there, but oooh. It was scary for a sec. When the girls 
first reach the town and find dead people, they think it is a disease. 
Reasonable at this point, so when one of them (a doctor) tells the other 
to try and use the phone, she grabs a tissue for her sister to use. We 
all know that kleenex will stop nasty airborne viruses from infecting us 
when we use the telephone.</P>
<P>Everyone who made this film owes themselves an apology. And if "Phantoms" 
doesn't make my year's worst list next January, then we are in for a real 
bad year in the theaters.</P>
<P>Zero out of four stars
