<PRE>                                 NOW & THEN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I like a good chick movie every now and then, especially if 
the chicks are of the attractive variety. That factor doesn't quite 
apply to NOW AND THEN, where the stars are four twelve-year-old 
girls -- Gaby Hoffman, Thora Birch, Ashleigh Aston Moore and 
Internet favorite Christina Ricci. I don't know if being the teenage 
girl most-lusted after by pedophiles is worth putting on your resume, 
but if you are one of the pedophiles, you'll head for the video store 
the second I tell you NOW AND THEN features a lingering closeup 
of Ricci in a training bra. The rest of you will probably head for the 
bathroom after reading that.</P>
<P>        NOW AND THEN also features the adult counterparts of 
the four girls -- Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rosie O'Donnell and 
Rita Wilson. (Another note for you Internet pedophiles, this film 
tells us Christina Ricci will look like Rosie O'Donnell in twenty 
years. I'm sure that's a real ego-booster for the girl...) The four 
women reconverge in their hometown after being called there 
by Wilson, who reminds them of the pact they made as children 
to be there for d a problem arise.</P>
<P>        The four women only appear in the first ten and last ten 
minutes of the movie, with the main plot revolving around four girls' 
coming-of-age story. So it's a cross between IT and STAND BY ME 
(and it even has a subplot about a dead body), but it could never 
have come from the mind of Stephen King... barring an overdose of 
estrogen pills, of course. It could also be a cross between the 
nostalgic childhood feel of 1993's THE SANDLOT and the 
women-sticking-together ethic of STEEL MAGNOLIAS.</P>
<P>        Whichever of the four films most inspired NOW AND 
THEN, it comes off as an entertaining movie most of the time. The 
film is at its best when focusing on the curiosities of youth -- sex 
and seances, mostly. Ricci is a tomboy who has to tape down her 
overly-developing chest and finally learns the reality behind her 
mother's death. Birch has dreams of Hollywood. Hoffman's parents 
are divorcing. Moore is fat. And so on.</P>
<P>        And we get the obligatory boys-with-cooties and truth-or-
dare scenes here, along with the girls' odyssey of trying to learn the 
mystery of a cemetary tombstone reading "Dear Johnny." (I won't 
give away the mystery, except to say Dear Abby goes to great 
lengths to get rid of her competition.) They also learn to trust each 
other and distrust their parents. Interestingly enough, it's adults like 
Vietnam vet Brendan Fraser and waitress/psychic Janeane Garafolo 
who tell them not to trust adults.</P>
<P>        Since at least 80% of NOW AND THEN is spent in the past, 
the scenes at the beginning and end of the grown-up friends reuniting 
are ultimately expendable. The real attraction of the movie (especially 
for those Internet pedophiles) is those pubescent girls. I suspect the 
only reason Demi, Melanie, Rosie and Rita make appearances at all is 
for the sake of name recognition. They're prominently displayed on 
the front along with their twelve-year-old counterparts, making it 
seem like an equal-time story between past and present, now and 
then. But the movie should have just been called THEN. Forget 
about now. Adults aren't to be trusted.</P>
