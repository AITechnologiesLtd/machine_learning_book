<PRE>                                      SCREAM
                       A film review by <A HREF="mailto:ismailp@capsure.net">ismailp@capsure.net</A>

<P>SCREAM:  This movie bored the pants off of me.  All the self
reflecting winks at the genre just served to pull me out of the realm of
movie magic, instead of drawing me in.  There were no character
development to speak of.  Then again, I shouldn't be surprised, after
all there were no interesting characters at all!  To top it off, it
wasn't the least bit scary.</P>
<P>I wanted to fast forward to the end to find out if the whole thing had
been a movie within a movie, involving a screenwriter's dream sequence
brought about by a case of indigestion.  No luck, I should've followed
my gut and walked out.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 2</PRE>
<PRE>Rating system:
1 - absolute worse film
2 - poor
3 - average
4 - good
5 - excellent</PRE>
