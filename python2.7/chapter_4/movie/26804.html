<PRE>Charlie's Angels (2000)

<P>I don't remember watching the TV series Charlie's Angels, given that the 
show premiered when I was about a year old, I guess that's why.  Now, 
Charlie's Angels is a big screen movie starring big name stars that I 
recognize.  How's the movie?</P>
<P>Remember this summer's Mission: Impossible 2?  Great film, but it lacked a 
sort of fun to it.  I loved M:I-2 since John Woo directed it, but the movie 
did take itself a little too seriously.  Imagine Charlie's Angels as M:I-2 
with the seriousness taken out and a lot of fun added in.</P>
<P>Three angels, absolutely gorgeous angels might I add, work for a man 
they've never seen, his name is Charlie.  These angels, Natalie (Cameron 
Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu), are trained to do 
everything.  Charlie guides them along via a proxy, Bosley (Bill 
Murray).  The opening sequence of the film sets the tone for the rest of 
the film, it takes place on an airliner and it is explosive.</P>
<P>The plot for Charlie's Angels is quite thin, something to do about a 
kidnapping, a satellite, voice recognition, and plain old revenge.  But, 
that doesn't matter because the film is more about mindless fun and action, 
oh and lots of cleavage.  And it delivers on all counts of this.  Complete 
with mind-bending computer enhanced and ever so fake looking martial arts, 
explosions, car chases, helicopters, and did I mention explosions, 
Charlie's Angels is a summer film trapped in a fall release date.</P>
<P>There's not much I can say about the film.  It's mindless and it's 
fun.  The actresses are great in their roles and all of them savor 
it.  Diaz steals every scene she's in.  Barrymore is wonderful.  And Liu is 
great.  Murray does some great scenes in the movie in which he improvises 
and these scenes are laugh out loud funny.</P>
<P>The director, Joseph McGinty Nichol (credited on the film as McG), knows 
how to put together a wham-bang film.  He uses slow motion well, as if he's 
studied John Woo's film with great care.  He puts together action sequences 
that will satisfy any adrenaline junky.    Kudos to McG for putting 
together such a fun movie.</P>
<P>Well, like I said before, there is not much I can say about this film but 
Don't Miss it.  This is a Don't Miss film, catch it in the theatres.  It's 
nice to have a post-summer adrenaline rush type film like this in late fall.</P>
