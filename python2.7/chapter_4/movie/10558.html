<PRE>GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Gus Van Sant
Writers: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
Starring: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgård,
Ben Affleck, Cole Hauser, Casy Affleck, George Plimpton</P>
<P>There are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few
people have, but they chose not to take advantage of this for some
personal reason.  "Good Will Hunting" is about one of those people.</P>
<P>The Will Hunting of the (horrible) title (let's face it, this film would
be a bitch to title), played by co-writer Matt Damon, is a mathematical
genius.  He can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time
it takes to brew a cup of Irish Cream Cappuccino.  And he works at
MIT...as the janitor.</P>
<P>One day, the professor of one of the most challenging courses,
Proffessor Lambeau ("Breaking the Waves"'s Stellan Skarsgård), puts a
big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete.  The
next day, it's already done on the board, but no one in his class claims
to have done it.  So Lambeau puts another problem on the board, this
time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove.  And,
duh, it's done again.  Of course, they catch the guy who did it red
handed - Will.</P>
<P>Before Lambeau can find Will again (he ran away when he caught him),
Will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball
court, and struck a police officer, so Lambeau gets him out on probation
with two agreements: a) he work with him on math, and b) he get some
therapy.  After going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one
way or another (for a hypnotist, he fakes being under his spell, then
launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic, "Afternoon
Delight").</P>
<P>Finally, Lambeau's old college roomate, Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a
psych professor, agrees to treat him, and the two begin a rocky
relationship, as Sean tries to get Will to open up.  Turns out Will had
a rough childhood, being abandoned, and placed in foster homes and what
not.  It also turns out that Will does not want to do simple mathematics
all his life; he wants a challenge.  And that is to hang out with his
buds (including the other co-writer, Ben Affleck), and do honorable
jobs, like construction.</P>
<P>Is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of Einstein and
Kasinsky?  Should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to
do?  This appears to be one of the million questions in this film, which
is jam-packed with greatness, but does not have the totally brilliant
whole it should.</P>
<P>I'm not saying "Good Will Hunting" is a bad film at all.  It's a very
enjoyable film with tons of great moments, and lots of great things
about it.  The acting is amazing, with two Oscar-nomination-worthy
performances from Damon and Williams, who have amazing chemistry
together.  We also get some great support from Stellan Skarsgård (great
name), Ben Affleck, and from Minnie Driver, who plays Will's love
interest, Skylar.</P>
<P>There are tons of individual moments that I adored.  I loved all the
comedy in the film, especially a scene where Damon proves a schmuck out
of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks,
his various attempts at therapy, and of course, my favorite scene in the
entire film, the one where he delivers a long, exstensive rant to some
NSA agents about the downside of working for them.</P>
<P>I liked the relationship between some of the people, like Will and
Skylar, Will and Sean, Sean and Lambeau, and Will and his friends. 
There are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch.  And
there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their
portrayal, that I felt rightfully uncomfortable.  Like the break-up
scene between Will and Skylar, Will and Sean's first meeting, a bar
scene between Sean and Lambeau, and a scene where Sean tells in detail
how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife, who would later suffer a
slow, painful death, and leave him lonely and slightly bitter.</P>
<P>However, the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything,
and not enough of it either.  The film tries for deeper relations
between the characters, but they're sometimes either overwritten or
underwritten.  Take for example the relationship between Sean and Will:
the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient
relationship going with out any problems, but when it tries to show them
as equals, it falls on its face.  We hear how they went to the same
town, and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical
both of them are at times.  But this never takes off like the other
parts of their relationship do.</P>
<P>Also, Will's relationship with his best friend, Chuckie (Affleck), has a
nice climax, but not enough rising action.  We see them joking around,
but when Chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them, it seems
more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one.  Their
relationship never goes beyond "just best friends," and his decision
just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of
something more...human.  Maybe it was just me.  And it also goes for a
parallelism with the relationship between Sean and Lambeau, but that,
again, is underwritten.</P>
<P>And, of course, as in most films like this, the girl/boy relationship is
pretty underwritten.  We never understand what they see in each other,
so when Skylar confesses that she loves him, it seems more like it's
there for plot details that anything else.  Minnie Driver is
interesting, though, and breathes life into her character.</P>
<P>The writing is a bit at fault here, but what makes all this worthwhile
is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness. 
Sure, it feels overstuffed, but it's extremely enjoyable.  The dialogue
that Affleck and Damon have written is amazingly fresh, and seems
extremely human.  I think that they should get a nomination for their
script chiefly because of the dialogue, which is amazing.</P>
<P>While this is probably director Gus Van Sant's most conservative film
(you'd hardly know it's the same director of "To Die For," the only Van
Sant film I've seen, really), it's still a pretty remarkable film,
albeit a tad overrated (what's this "best picture" deal?).  And if a
film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws, I have no
problem with reccomending it to anyone.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
