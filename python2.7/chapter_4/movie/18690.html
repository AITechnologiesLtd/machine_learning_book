<PRE>Much Ado about "Notting"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>I love a good fairy tale...always have since I was only knee-high. 
Why?  Because these are stories that you'd always like to see happen in
real life but probably never will.  These are dreams that you wish
would somehow come true.  These are the kinds of stories 'that can only
happen in the movies.'  "Notting Hill" can be called a fairy tale for
at its heart is a romantic comedy about two different types of people
that, in today's frenzied world, could never get together.  But in the
world of fairy tales, there's always a wonderful chance that the
impossible might happen.</P>
<P>The majority of us live rather uneventful and ordinary lives.  We are
the common folk who go to work every day to make an honest living, not
at all well-informed about happenings beyond our personal borders.  The
citizens of Notting Hill are equally 'plain.'  Many of us are probably
like unlucky-in-love William (Hugh Grant).  His personal life has been
marred by a series of broken hearts while his career lies behind the
counter of a travel bookstore that he owns and operates.  For him, the
seasons come and go just like the few customers that actually find
their way into his little store.  </P>
<P>One day, he and his store are visited by famous actress Anna Scott
(Julia Roberts).  Although somewhat starstruck, he sees her as
surprisingly down-to-earth, much like the proverbial girl next door. 
In turn, she finds him charming with a playful smile and a sense of
self-depricating humor.  But she really appreciates his life of
normalcy.  He's out of the limelight, but special in his own way.  This
and their other subsequent chance encounter brings out their attraction
for one another.  But being a celebrity has its drawbacks.  "Notting
Hill" is a smart film that acknowledges the tremendous obstacles that
these two must overcome.   With Anna's popularity, she desparately
protects her privacy while the merciless paparazzi follow her every
step.  For William, his fragile heart can barely take her frequent
flights into hiding.   It also shows how down-to-earth celebrities can
be.  The fame and glory can be daunting.  But she's just a normal girl
who wants to accompany William to his little sister's birthday party,
who gets her feelings noticeably hurt at a restaurant when an adjacent
table makes derisive comments about her, and who wants to steal kisses
in the middle of a darkened park.  But most of all, she says, "I'm just
a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."</P>
<P>Julia Roberts balances well her vulnerable girl against her own need to
protect herself.  She has always done well in fairy tales.  But it's
Hugh Grant, who I think, deserves a nod for his great comedy timing and
his charming mannerisms.  I especially liked this one scene where the
only way that he could see Anna was to masquerade as a magazine rep on
an interview.  He's not too media-savvy, and says that he's from Horse
& Hound.  "Are there any horses in your latest movie," he gingerly
asks?  Her reply is, "no, the movie was set in outer space."  He's at a
complete loss, and this is a very funny moment.  With its sunny
disposition, weepy ballad-filled soundtrack, and nice touches of
comedy, everyone can live happily ever after.</P>
