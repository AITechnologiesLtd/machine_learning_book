<P>     A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE, the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski's 
DECALOGUE episodes to be transformed into a feature film (the other 
being A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING), takes a unique look at the emotional 
latticework that interconnects love, lust, and sexual obsession.  
Hypnotically engrossing, this picture delves deep into the psyches of 
its two main characters, employing irony, humor, and drama to weave a 
masterful tale of human interaction that will leave an indelible imprint 
on all who view it. </P>
<P>     A question that people have pondered for ages is whether there 
exists a pure form of romantic love -- an attraction so deep and 
innocent that sex becomes an unwanted distraction.  For eighty-six 
minutes in A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE, Kieslowski explores this issue.  
Nothing is resolved, except perhaps an understanding of the great pain 
and fragility that can result from the simple act of opening one's 
heart. </P>
<P>     The story begins with nineteen-year old Tomek (Olaf Lubaszenko) 
training a telescope on the windows of an apartment opposite his.  
Inside, a beautiful, older woman, Magda (Grazyna Szapolowska), is 
undressing.  Initially, we assume that Tomek is watching for the 
titillation value, but, as we observe him night after night, it becomes 
clear that he's more interested in Magda when she's fully clothed and 
engaged in some mundane activity than when her actions turn sexual.  In 
fact, when she goes to bed with a man, Tomek trains the telescope away. </P>
<P>     As his obsession deepens, Tomek is no longer content with merely 
watching.  He begins to make phone calls and pilfer letters, then 
eventually works up the courage to meet Magda face-to-face.  In a 
guilty, rushed confession, he tells all.  At first, Magda is furious and 
seeks her own form of revenge, but eventually she finds herself drawn to 
the young man.  One night, after the two go out on a relatively harmless 
date, she invites him into her apartment and proceeds to shatter his 
illusions.  A brief, unsatisfying sexual encounter rips away Tomek's 
innocence and sends him fleeing Magda's apartment.  Once home, he slits 
his wrists. </P>
<P>     Tomek survives the suicide attempt, but while he's in the hospital, 
Magda is riddled with guilt.  She begins to obsess over him, trying to 
find out everything she can about his life and friends.  She uses a pair 
of binoculars to watch his apartment, waiting for his return.  She turns 
away her lover, unwilling (or unable) to engage in sex while Tomek is 
away.   </P>
<P>     Certainly, the central irony in the film is how the tables are 
turned.  The object of voyeurism becomes the voyeur.  The loved one 
becomes the lover.  In the end, it's not clear whether or not Magda has 
fallen for Tomek, but we recognize that she is experiencing deep pangs 
of guilt for what she did, and that she craves his return to innocence.  
She would like nothing more than for him to return to spying on her.  
Recognizing too late her power to wound, Magda seeks redemption.  
Obliquely, the closing scene of A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE indicates she 
might find it.  In this, the resolution is vastly different than that of 
DECALOGUE 6, which concluded with an emotionless Tomek admitting to 
Magda that he will never spy on her again.  Coupled with several added 
scenes that build character and fill plot holes, this different ending 
gives a new and more satisfying outlook to the story than the one 
presented in DECALOGUE. </P>
<P>     During the scene when Tomek is in Magda's apartment, a fascinating 
change in point-of-view occurs.  Up to then, everything had been from 
Tomek's perspective.  All of our glimpses of Magda's rooms had been 
through his telescope.  Then, it all changes.  When Tomek runs from the 
apartment, we remain inside with Magda, watching him through a window.  
>From that moment on, the story is told from Magda's viewpoint.  This 
unique way of framing things allows for greater development and 
understanding of both characters. </P>
<P>     As in WHITE, Kieslowski uses comedy to set up several scenes.  
There are a lot of very funny moments in A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE.  
However, even beyond the comic undercurrent, there are many comparisons 
between this movie and the middle entry in the THREE COLORS trilogy.  
Both deal with diseased relationships, sexual obsession, and the need 
for equality.  And, in voyeurism, A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE shares a 
thread with RED.   </P>
<P>     Love is probably the most commonly presented theme in all motion 
pictures.  Most of the time, it is used as a plot device, so rarely is 
there a thoughtful examination of the dynamics of the emotion.  A SHORT 
FILM ABOUT LOVE is the exception, and what a magnificent exception it 
is.  With actors that give finely-tuned performances and a script that 
is richly detailed, the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.  There 
is more real feeling in this brief feature than in a hundred full-length 
Hollywood romantic comedies. </P>
