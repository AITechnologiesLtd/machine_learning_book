<PRE>                             REVIEW: HYPE! (1996)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     In the spirit of full disclosure, let me admit upfront that I am
from the Beach Boys generation.  Not only do I never listen to heavy
metal, punk, or grunge music, I haven't listened to anything but
classical for years.  Given these facts I am one of the least likely
people on this planet to be recommending a documentary about the grunge
movement in Seattle.  Nevertheless, this review will do precisely that.</P>
<P>     First time director Doug Pray creates an accessible documentary
film, HYPE!, about the birth of grunge in Seattle.  It is an absolutely
riveting film with broad appeal although given the subject, it may only
be seen by a niche audience.  If so, a lot of viewers are going to miss
out on something well worth seeing.</P>
<P>     "Seattle is currently to Rock n' Roll what Bethlehem was to
Christianity" claims a magazine article shown as the film opens.  To
set the stage the picture starts by introducing people to the
Northwestern United States.  Retro graphic designer Art Chantry tells
us, "The Northwest is where the term flying saucer was coined.  The
Northwest is the serial killer capital of the world.  ...  This is all
part of what goes into the music.  ...  Everyone wants to come here and
live that good yuppie lifestyle."</P>
<P>     As the talking heads are speaking, deft editors Doug Pray and Joan
Zapata intersperse video clips of the Northwest's majestic beauty and
absolute squalor.</P>
<P>     Once the background is laid, the groups are shown in performance,
but this is most assuredly not a rock video.  The clips are short and
used to illustrate the points.  Two things are immediately clear.</P>
<P>     First, these groups have a blast playing their music together.
Their shtick of hoping around like kangaroos and jumping into their
instruments and into their audience as much from exuberance as
showmanship.</P>
<P>     As you watch them, their joy becomes quite infectious.  This is a
high energy, very upbeat show.  If it has a single message, it might be
that this music is pure unadulterated fun.  Certainly the film is quite
humorous and never pedantic.</P>
<P>     Second, the groups are not all the stereotypes you may believe.
If the word grunge makes you think of a bunch of white males with long
unkempt hair and needle pitted arms, think again.  The groups have
people of both sexes and multiple races.  Moreover, some of the members
look more like nerds than rock stars.  As Van Conner of Screaming Trees
puts it, "We were the guys in high school who couldn't even talk to the
pretty girls.  We're nerds."</P>
<P>     The show attempts to be a bit educational.  One band member
demonstrates how punk was transformed into grunge.  This excerpt
appears on the trailer so I've seen the clip fours times now, and I
still can ascertain no difference which, I suppose, is the point.  One
of the rock producers gives advice to a new band to choose just five
chords to play and never play more than three different ones in any one
song.  Grunge is minimalist music.  It is the energy of its players
that breathes life into it.</P>
<P>     For a documentary, the camera work by Robert Bennett is surprising
good.  It says in the press kit that the film is done without "any
narration or voice-over commentary."  This is done so that there would
be "no outside pundit."  All of this gives the film a clarity that lets
us eavesdrop without being noticed.</P>
<P>     After the original Seattle bands, especially Pearl Jam, Nirvana,
and Soundgarden, get worldwide recognition, other bands flock to
Seattle until they number in the thousands.  The working title of the
film was THE FABULOUS SOUNDS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, but was changed
to HYPE! when Pray realized what the media had turned the area's music
scene into.</P>
<P>     The band members got so disgusted with clueless reporters who show
up wanting to get the scoop on the Seattle music scene that they start
making up stories.  The best appears as fact in a New York Times
article that purports to give an up-to-date lexicon of grunge.
Twenty-five year old Megan Jasper, a sales rep at Caroline Records in
Seattle, just made up words along with their bogus definitions, and the
Times took them as gospel and printed them so that the rest of their
readers could speak fluent grunge.</P>
<P>     Soon the commercial world discovers grunge too.  Although the
movement's costumes are low rent, the fashion designers see them as an
opportunity to turn them into something to make big profits.  We have
scenes of grunge outfits displayed on the marbled floors of exclusive
shopping emporiums.</P>
<P>     Similarly, the rock music publishing world wanted to write about
nothing but grunge.  My favorite article they show is the one
headlined: "Honey, I blew up the amp."</P>
<P>     For a documentary that interviews three dozen people, it still
manages to make all of them compelling.  Somehow you feel you get to
know all of them in a short amount of time.  Many fictional films can't
accomplish this with just a few stars.  I ended up liking and caring
about most of them.  A fascinating group.  Although I'd still never buy
any of their records, I loved watching their antics as they performed,
and I loved listening to them talk.</P>
<P>     Record producer Martin Rushent sums it up best.  He claims the
purpose of grunge is to, "get rock back to its basics.  Make a noise
and play music your parents won't like."</P>
<P>     HYPE! runs just 1:24.  It was not rated at the time of the press
screening, but I see no reason why it shouldn't get a PG rating.  There
is no sex, nudity, or violence.  There may have been some bad language,
but I didn't remember any.  The film would be fine for anybody, but I
am sure it would hold no interest for younger kids.  The best
documentaries, and this is one, take you into worlds you have never
been or ever wanted to go and let you live there vicariously.  I
enjoyed my voyage into the world of grunge, and I think you would too
so I am recommending the film and giving it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
