<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This bizarre supernatural art-horror film is the first feature with all
dialogue recorded in Esperanto (an artificial international language
created in the 1800s so everyone in the world could speak in the same
tongue). There are English subtitles. This lost film was reconstructed
from a single print found at Cinematheque Francaise in Paris and
producer Anthony Taylor recently recorded it on video for the first
time. Incubus has been missing for the past thirty years. It's a
gorgeously photographed b/w film by cinematographer Conrad Hall; a
spooky tale about murderous sea creatures. It's filled with hokum, as it
tells about the battle for souls between the God of Light and the God of
Darkness. Guess who wins?</P>
<P>This film also comes with the mystique of a "curse" that supposedly
befell members of the cast and crew, several of whom were murdered,
kidnapped, or committed suicide after its completion.  In 1966, Milos
Milos, an actor from Belgrade, murdered his girlfriend, Mickey Rooney's
fifth wife, Barbara Ann Thompson Rooney, and then shot himself. Ann
Atmar, a sometime nude girlie-magazine model, committed suicide a few
weeks after the film was finished. A few years after the film was
released, the daughter of Eloise Hardt, was kidnapped from her Los
Angeles driveway and murdered.</P>
<P>The film is set during a lunar eclipse in the mythical land of Nomen
Tuum (translation-an Unknown Time), where there is a Deer Well with
strange healing powers. But it is also a dark place where succubi lure
corrupted souls into hell. The attractive Kia (Allyson Ames) is one such
succubus, who easily lures impure souls to the sea where she steps on
their head and they drown. She tells her leader that she wants more
challenging prey and finds Marc (pre-Trek William Shatner), who plays
the very moral visitor to the Deer Well to heal his physical injuries.
He is living there in a cottage with his beloved virginal sister Arndis
(Ann Atman). Kia woos him and leads him away with her, but the head
demon, Amael (Hardt), tells Kia to be careful with him, he won't be
easy, his soul is good and he will try to conquer you with love.</P>
<P>When she lures him away, he takes her to the cathedral's altar and she
runs away in fear of his goodness. But his sister is taken by the
Incubus (Milos Milos), disguised as a young peasant. He was summoned by
Amael to rise from the underground of the dead, and Arndis is brought to
Satan's Bridal Chamber by him. Here, the Incubus deflowers her and
returns her to Marc, in the hope that Marc will forget his Christian
beliefs and seek bloody revenge. The catch is that Kia can't go through
with the ruin of Marc and succumbs to his love, something she will have
to pay the price for as the Incubus goes after her. When she spots him
by the cathedral, she makes the sign of the cross in defense; but, the
Incubus turns into a screaming black goat who attempts to ravish her.</P>
<P>"Incubus" was directed by "The Outer Limits" creator Leslie Stevens, who
filmed it on Big Sur, California. This thin story has merit, as it casts
a spellbinding effect over its eerie doings and strange surroundings. If
its strangeness you are seeking, or a cultish horror film from the 1960s
that is an oddity, or if you are a fan of horror films, then this is the
film for you. Others might not be so taken with the strange events
taking place, events that seem more nutty than real; and, they might not
be taken by Shatner's stiff performance. I found this B film engaging in
an Ingmar Bergman way, but without the Swedish director's ability to
tell a better story. But, the film deserves an audience beyond its
cultish fans.</P>
