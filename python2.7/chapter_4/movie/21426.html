<P>The tagline to this film is "There are movies that define every decade..."
which in my opinion, refers to either THE BREAKFAST CLUB or WALL STREET from
the 80s, and yet unclear as to which movie from the 90s. FIGHT CLUB perhaps?
One thing IS for sure and that is the fact that BODY SHOTS isn't that film!
Creating this false sense of expectation sure isn't going to help this
film's success either. Wake up, fellas, execs don't decide which film
defines a decade...audiences do that!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four single horny twenty-something guys prepare to go out to a nightclub in
order to hook up with four twenty-something single young horny females. They
drink, they meet, they dance and they f*ck. Some of the drinking, partying
and sex is cool and fun, and some of the drinking, partying and sex is not
cool and not fun. An accusation of date-rape is the center of the film's
second half.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film seemed to have two levels of entertainment. One part of the film
was about a bunch of guys and girls talking about sex like it was bubble
gum, while the second part of the film essentially turned into an ugly
date-rape situation, in which everyone is asked to figure out which half of
the "he said/she said" scenario they are more comfortable believing. Or then
again, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, this film is probably less
about date-rape than it is about alcoholism. I tend to agree. Everyone in
this film drinks...and I mean drinks! It's obvious by the end of this film
that alcohol played a large part in the night of every one of these "kids",
and that sex and alcohol could provide for a lethal combination. But does
all this make for an interesting movie? Not really. I thought the actors
were all okay, although not a one stood out of the pack. Actually, I take
that back.</P>
<P>Mr. Ron Livingston was the highlight of this film with his hip doofus
character sprinkling the movie with much needed humor from time to time. The
screenplay did also provide for some interesting insight into the different
perspectives on sex from both sides of the fence, with at least one
engaging, yet overlong, deliberation about blowjobs sure to keep most guys
interested for at least that little while. Other than that, most of the
characters were kinda boring, each with their particular "way of thinking",
and the direction of the film was needlessly over-stylized with several
slo-motion shots and views of the city feeling out of place in a
character-based story. The film also offered direct interaction with many of
the characters, as each one spoke to the camera every now and again. This
seemed like a good idea, but once again, the lack of charm or spark from
most of the actors, and the director's camera trickery, just seemed to take
away from anything which may have come from this addition. All in all, an
over-stylized TV Movie of the Week for those folks who actually don't enjoy
watching the classics like GO and SWINGERS over and over again. Luckily for
me...I am not one of those people. And if you're really in the mood for a
picture of rich, snooty kids who like to take drugs and f*ck the world,
check out LESS THAN ZERO...now there's a good movie!</P>
<P>PS: Note to studio. If you want to label a film as one that will "define a
decade", how about you make sure that all of the twenty-something characters
to which we're all supposed to be able to relate, don't drive Mercedes
Benz's, live in beach houses and have just signed $5Million contracts to
play for the Oakland Raiders. I'm sitting in the theatre in a Tee and
Bermudas with nachos running down my face, and somehow, I don't see myself
in the same boat as these rich brats. But I digress. Burp!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film was originally titled JELLO SHOTS, but was forced to change its
moniker when the JELLO company threatened to sue. Considering the
transgressions that occur after most of the characters in this film drink
these "jello shots"- I can't say that I blame them. The film also went
through two other titles including LAST NIGHT and THE NIGHT BEFORE.
Strangely enough, the screenwriter of this film, David McKenna, is the same
fellow who wrote one of 1998's Best Pictures, AMERICAN HISTORY X starring Ed
Norton as a skinhead. This was only his second produced screenplay. His
third is entitled GET CARTER and is set to star Sylvester Stallone.
This is director Michael Cristofer's motion picture directing debut. He
previously wrote and directed the TV movie GIA starring Angelina Jolie. He
also wrote the screenplays for such films as THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, THE
BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES and MR. JONES.
Actor Sean Patrick Flanery is a triathlete with a black belt in karate.
Jerry O'Connell's real name is Jeremiah O'Connell. He starred in his first
film, STAND BY ME, at the age of 11. After that film, Jerry went back to
school and did not become a full time actor until he graduated from college,
although he did appear in several things along the way.
Actress Tara Reid began her career on TV in such shows as "Saved by the
Bell: The New Class" and "Days of our Lives".
Actress Amanda Peet has also made her share of TV appearances including one
on "Seinfeld", in which she played a character named "Linette" in the
episode called "The Summer of George".</P>
