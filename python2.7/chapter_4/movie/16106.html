<PRE>A LIFE LESS ORDINARY
Directed by Danny Boyle</PRE>
<P>Near the beginning of "A Life Less Ordinary" there's a knockout of a
scene: Exquisitely bored rich girl Cameron Diaz (in a white swimsuit
that will probably never touch water) coerces her dopey dentist fiance
into balancing a carefully polished apple on top of his head so that
she can shoot the fruit with her equally carefully polished
revolver. At the last minute, the worm squirms, just as the shot is
fired. "Call a doctor," the shootist tells her butler, in a tone that
suggests disappointment rather than despair.</P>
<P>Yes, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge are up to their
old tricks again. Having previously mined murder ("Shallow Grave") and
drug abuse ("Trainspotting") for jet-black humor, they're now out to
set the romantic comedy on its ear, pairing Diaz with Scottish hottie
Ewan McGregor in a kidnap-caper-gone-awry yarn that starts off in
Heaven and wraps up with a postscript dramatized via Claymation.  No
one is likely to accuse the British filmmakers of playing it safe in
their first cruise through the American mainstream.</P>
<P>Even so, the millions who embraced their first two films may find "A
Life Less Ordinary" a bit less enchanting; certainly the 90 minutes
that follow that poolside scene don't come close to topping it. The
concept of angelic intervention in modern-day life must be one of
those ideas that always sounds great on paper, but on the screen it's
given us failed fantasies like last year's clunky remake of "The
Preacher's Wife," as well as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's
"Two Of A Kind" and director Alan Rudolph's "Made In Heaven." Casting
Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo as militant Cupids ensures that
"Ordinary" has a much lower sugar content than most films of its
ilk---you call almost retitle it "Slugged By An Angel"---but even this
pair eventually wear out their welcome and become little more than a
mildly irritating gimmick.</P>
<P>What flashes of magic "Ordinary" has come not from its concept but
from its quirks. Having half-heartedly kidnapped heiress Celine (Diaz)
with the hopes of getting a fortune from her billionaire daddy, the
graceless Robert (McGregor) comes to realize his supposed victim knows
a good deal more about working these kinds of scams than he does. When
Robert tells Celine he's asking $500,000 for her return, she gasps
that at that "if word got out that I went for only $500,000, I'd never
be able to show my face in polite society again," and while Robert
wants to send an old-fashioned ransom note made up of letters clipped
from newspaper headlines, Celine nonchalantly slashes her arm and
writes the message in her own blood.</P>
<P>Though Hodge's story is little more than a string of set-pieces (the
karaoke fantasy, the bungled bank job, the slam-bang Road Runner-style
chase, etc) the movie looks and sounds fabulous, thanks to Boyle's
sharp eye and a soundtrack featuring everyone from Underworld to
Elvis. Even when "Ordinary" doesn't quite capture the madcap mood it's
after, it always offers something unique to look at and listen to, and
McGregor and Diaz (looking more than ever like Michelle Pfeiffer's
sullen little sister) handle the comedy deftly. If this had been the
first film from Boyle and Hodge it would probably have been celebrated
as an auspicious debut, but when you've raised the bar so high with
two instant cult classics, a middling follow-up is destined to look
much worse by comparisson.  James Sanford</P>
