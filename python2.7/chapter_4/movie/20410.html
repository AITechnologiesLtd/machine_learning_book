<PRE>Backstroking with Dragons
Lake Placid</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Kind of a cuter smaller version of the recent "Godzilla," "Lake Placid" is
actually a slightly better movie. Where "Godzilla" makes the head hurt,
"Placid" splashes up a bit fun. A solid "B" movie.</P>
<P>Basically, something big in a New England Lake bites a swimmer in half, so
paleontologist (Bridge Fonda) flies in from New York to investigate. She
teams up with a handsome ranger guy, small town sheriff,  and hippie
crock-doc who likes to backstroke with the dragons.</P>
<P>The dialogue between the four is throw-away sarcasm; still, a few beauts
slither through. And honestly, the interaction between the sheriff and
crock-doc is very amusing. It nearly takes over the movie and it should.</P>
<P>There's a scene where the fearless crock-doc jumps into the sea-monster's
waters, finding himself face to jaws he advises the beast, "I know biting my
head off right now might seem viable ... but it would cheapen you."</P>
<P>The mysterious reptile below the surface is the least implausible of the
unlikelies in this picture, but if you're willing to swallow them whole, you
might just have fun. Further, you'll get to see Betty White swearing like
one of the South Park gang. Now that's a good time.</P>
<P>Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt. Directed by Steve Miner.
Written by David E. Kelley. Produced by David E. Kelly and Michael Pressman
at Phoenix/20th Century Fox.</P>
