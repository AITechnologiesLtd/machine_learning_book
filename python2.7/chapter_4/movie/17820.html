<PRE>CRUEL INTENTIONS (1999)
Directed by Roger Kumble
Review © 1999 Scott J. Promish</PRE>
<P>CRUEL INTENTIONS is the latest film adaptation of the novel 'Les Liasons
Dangereuses.'  Instead of playing it straight in its historical context
(like 'Dangerous Liaisons' (1988) or 'Valmont' (1989)), however, the story
here involves modern day high school students, with a slightly incestuous
twist.</P>
<P>Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe) and Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) are bored, rich stepsiblings who control much of the social life in
their academic universe.  Sebastian is a philanderer who gets whatever girl
he wants, and eventually dumps her in the most creative and nasty ways he
can think of, while Kathryn's specialty is pure revenge.  When the new
headmaster's daughter, Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon) appears in a
popular magazine article, boasting about her commitment to wait till
marriage for sex, Sebastian sees a whole new challenge.  Kathryn proposes a
wager: if he fails to bed Annette, she gets his vintage Jaguar; if he
succeeds, he gets to bed his stepsister, the one girl he's lusted after but
could never really have.  Though Kathryn wins either way, he agrees.</P>
<P>This is a gleefully immoral and refreshingly mean-spirited film.  Parents
would no doubt gasp at much of the talk and behavior, while this reviewer
was made to giggle uncontrollably throughout.  CRUEL INTENTIONS doesn't care
about being politically correct, favoring realism over being acceptable.
(Several reviewers have decried the homophobic dialogue in the film,
apparently forgetting what it was actually like to be in high school.)</P>
<P>It's a shame that such good writing is ruined by two really terrible
performances.  Philippe's delivery is so flat and unconvincing, it's almost
inconceivable that none of his character's previous conquests could see
through his act.  Similarily, Witherspoon's Annette is extraordinarily dull.
When Sebastian finally falls in love with her, one can't help but wonder
what he finds so entrancing.</P>
<P>Gellar is good, and Selma Blair is very entertaining as naïve freshman
Cecile, whom Kathryn attempts to corrupt to get back at her for stealing an
ex-lover.  Unfortunately, Philippe and Witherspoon do much to deaden the
film; too bad - it could have been quite good.</P>
