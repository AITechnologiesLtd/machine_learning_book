<PRE>TUMBLEWEEDS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Hot on the heels of--and certainly not to be confused with--that
other mother-daughter road picture currently doing the rounds (the Susan
Sarandon/Natalie Portman "Anywhere But Here"), Gavin O'Connor's
"Tumbleweeds" tumbles into town Š and will likely tumble right back out
again.</P>
<PRE>        In addition to lacking spark, it's simply not that good a movie.</PRE>
<P>        Writer/director O'Connor, who also appears in the film as a
melancholy truck driver, might think he has something going here but what
he has is a Performance (capital P) and a handful of secondary characters
and situations that don't amount to much.</P>
<P>        That Performance comes courtesy of Janet McTeer, a respected
English stage actress who won a Tony for her performance as Nora in the
1997 West End revival of Ibsen's "A Doll's House."  In "Tumbleweeds,"
McTeer makes a radical departure by playing Mary Jo, a sassy West Virginian
single mom.  McTeer throws herself into the role with aplomb: Mary Jo is
brash and uninhibited, dresses for sexual success, and has zero talent when
it comes to picking suitable mates (or "future ex-husbands" as her
12-year-old daughter likes to quip).</P>
<P>        Your enjoyment of the film will entirely depend on just how
irritating you find Mary Jo's character.</P>
<P>        Ava, her daughter, is played by newcomer Kimberly J. Brown.  She's
adequate in the role, but no Natalie Portman, and serves mainly as a
sounding board to McTeer's liberated ebullience.</P>
<P>        As the film opens, Mary Jo is in the middle of yet another domestic
argument.  She and Ava pack up and hit the road.  If we all upped and ran
every time we squabbled with our spouses there'd be a heck of a lot more
traffic on the interstates.  Where to this time?  Ava suggests California
after a breeze through Missouri leaves an unappetizing old flame standing
with reverse-tire tracks burned into his driveway.</P>
<P>        But it's not long before Mary Jo sets her sights on some other
wagon-hitching material.</P>
<P>        O'Connor's character, Jack, is an odd one--hapless and sullen.  I
swear he doesn't smile once in the entire picture.  OK, so perhaps when he
first meets our female protagonists, when their car runs out of water on
the highway--"I should've used my piss!" squawks Mary Jo alluringly.</P>
<P>        While some might find Mary Jo's vulgarity a little much at times,
there's no denying that her relationship with her daughter is an open and
loving one.  The film, however, takes the all too obvious tack of having
the mother be the carefree, irresponsible one with the daughter providing
the centered, calming influence.  "Tumbleweeds" rushes to summarize this
familiar dichotomy in a creaky metaphor concerning Mary Jo's reluctance to
go near that big Pacific ocean.  You don't need to have seen "Anywhere But
Here" to know it'll be Ava who serves as her swim coach.</P>
