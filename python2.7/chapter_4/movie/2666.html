<PRE>                               WYATT EARP
                       A film review by Cindy Bale
                        Copyright 1994 Cindy Bale</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Lawrence Kasdan.
Starring Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman
Running time is 3 hours.</PRE>
<P>     WYATT EARP details thirty-five years in the life of same from
around 1865 to 1900.  After seeing the movie SPEED twice recently, I
kept thinking that I was seeing Wyatt's life pass before my eyes in
real time.  This movie was boring, slow, boring, and slow.  There were
a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just
fell flat.</P>
<P>     The script happily woman-bashes but also tries to sound like an
80s movie.  They cannot have it both ways.  "I now pronounce you
husband and wife."  Sure, they said that in the 1800s.
"Entrepreneur."  Sure.  Every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that
Wyatt's third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it.  "Oh,
the script was written by two men?"  "No kidding!"</P>
<P>     The movie is torture to sit through.  The scenery is boring.  The
fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important.  Can you say
poor editing?</P>
<P>     Everyone looks ugly in this movie.  When you shoot people from
under their chins, they look like they have double chins.  Kevin
Costner has never looked worse.  He should sue.  He looks like he
gained the 43 pounds that Dennis Quaid lost.</P>
<P>     Dennis Quaid is marvelous.  If you have to see this movie just for
his performance, go into the theatre at the movie's halfway mark.  Doc
Holliday (Quaid's character) shows up at about the 90-minute mark.</P>
<P>     Gene Hackman is very good.  Is he in the credits?  I don't
remember seeing his name.</P>
<P>Mare Winningham makes the best of a small role as Wyatt's second wife.
Annabeth Gish is good as Wyatt's first wife.  I though that Jamie Gertz
played Wyatt's third wife, but I later heard that her name is Joanna
Going.  She looks great but her dialogue sucks.  She also seems way to
young for Costner.  Costner seems way to old for 90% of this movie.  In
his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old.  Yeah, right.
Catherine O'Hara and JoBeth Williams are always good and totally wasted
here.</P>
<P>     This is the worst movie that I have seen in years.  THE LAST
ACTION HERO was better that this.  Go see MAVERICK if you want to see a
Western.</P>
<P>Rating:  1 out of 10 bullets for Dennis Quaid's performance only.</P>
