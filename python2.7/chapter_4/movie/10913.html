<P>     For 18 years, THE BLUES BROTHERS has occupied a unique position as
perhaps the only action-musical in film history.  The adventures of Jake
(John Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) on their "mission from God"
somehow managed to mix production numbers and car chases into a ridiculous
cocktail of over-the-top absurdity and musical showmanship.  Much of the
film's unlikely success was attributed to the chemistry between Belushi
and Aykroyd, but the primary responsibility of the two stars was to
maintain a stoic demeanor behind their dark glasses.  No, I think THE
BLUES BROTHERS worked because it really _was_ like a mission for those
involved.  Belushi, Aykroyd and director John Landis became proselytizers
for soul, prepared to do absolutely anything to bring their musical
message to the people.  If that meant juxtaposing the Godfather of Soul
and vehicular chaos, so be it.  It was an insane film powered by the
fervor of true believers.</P>
<P>     If BLUES BROTHERS 2000 leaves a viewer feeling less than satisfied,
it's not necessarily due to the absence of the late Belushi, though John
Goodman does frequently seem unsure exactly what to do with himself.  The
main problem is the absence of a similar focus on the music, replaced by a
more cynical attempt to re-create the past.  The story is an over-plotted
collection of gimmicks, sending Elwood back into the world after nearly
two decades in prison to discover that brother Jake and surrogate father
Curtis (Cab Calloway in the original film) have both passed on.  In a
quest to re-connect with some sort of family, Elwood a) seeks out Curtis's
illegitimate son Cabel (Joe Morton), an Illinois State Police commander;
b) brings a meek bartender named Mack McTeer (Goodman) along to help
re-unite the Blues Brothers Band; and c) hooks up with troubled orphan
Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who serves the essential purpose of looking
cute in a miniature black suit, hat and shades.</P>
<P>     I'm not suggesting that THE BLUES BROTHERS was anybody's idea of a
streamlined narrative.  It had cops in pursuit, cartoonish hate-mongers, a
gun-wielding psycho, switch-wielding nun Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen
Freeman), Aretha Franklin singing, James Brown preaching, and carnage
galore.  BLUES BROTHERS 2000, on the other hand, has...well, every one of
those things, _plus_ items a-c above.  The pointed effort to recreate
every situation from the original -- recruiting the band members from new
vocations, playing a gig for a crowd expecting a different musical style,
etc. -- draws attention to the structure in a way which makes it feel
muddled rather than original, tired, rather than inspired.  Even Aykroyd's
performance draws unnecessary attention to itself, fooling with the notion
that Elwood is a three-dimensional character in need of growth.  Those who
remember him speaking about two dozen words in THE BLUES BROTHERS may be
startled to find that prison life has turned him into a loquacious sort
given to deconstructing the malevolence of Russian gangstersss or the
iconography of the Brothers' distinctive look.  They may also be quite
disappointed at how the loss of his deadpan reactions takes the edge off
the absurdist comedy.</P>
<P>     For all its flaws, however, there's almost enough energy in the
musical numbers alone to make BLUES BROTHERS 2000 worth watching.  In
addition to return players Franklin and Brown, the performers include Sam
Moore, Wilson Pickett and Eddie Floyd (sharing vocals with teen bluesman
Jonny Lang on "634-5789"), and an all-star blues jam for the finale in
which spotting the familiar faces is half the fun, and drooling over the
epic collection of talent is the other half.  Between the high-spirited
production numbers and one spectacular hundred-police-car pile-up -- a
hilarious non-stop parade of soaring, crashing metal -- there is enough
fun to satisfy most viewers, particularly if the familiarity is exactly
what they're looking for.  It's too bad that the much of the film feels
rushed, flattened and processed, like a knock-off sequel cranked out in 18
months instead of 18 years, to be sold with a marketing-friendly
abbreviation like BB2K.  Even with all the retail destruction and
collapsing buildings in THE BLUES BROTHERS, it used to be about the
_music_, man.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 soul men:  5.</PRE>
