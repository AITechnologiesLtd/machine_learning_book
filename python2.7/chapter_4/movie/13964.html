<P>Vince Vaughn must've really liked working with his co-stars in this
film. Come autumn, Vince will be co-starring opposite Joaquin Phoenix
in CLAY PIGEONS, and come Christmas, he joins his other co-star, Anne
Heche, in Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's
classic PSYCHO (Don't look at me, I didn't green-light this project.)</P>
<P>PLOT:
Three guys go down to Malaysia for some fun and relaxation. They smoke
hash. Drink a lot of rum. And bang a lot of girls. Money depleted, two
of the friends return home to NY. The remaining guy gets caught with
their remaining brick of hash, and is to be sentenced to death by
hanging, unless his two friends return to the exotic land of Malaysia,
and serve respective three-year prison sentences. If one returns, he
serves six years. What would you do?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Solid premise filled with a plethora of moral dilemmas, this film rocks
you through the gamut of emotions on the strength of its superb casting
and genuine performances. If the plot line of this film does not
interest you, then you may or may not like this movie depending on your
mood. On the other hand, if the basis of this film does draw in you
some intrigue, get ready to enjoy the spoils of your emotional
interest. This is a not a film for the kids. Suffice it to say that if
you liked the Oliver Stone-penned MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (7.5/10), you will
most likely appreciate this film as well.</P>
<P>This movie is not a cut-and-paste moral drama that slowly places all
the right pieces in front of you as you strand along. It's a well
drawn-out story with interesting characters, real emotions, and several
unforeseen curves thrown in for a deeper search of the soul. The twists
keep the story from getting boring, but more than that, it is the
actors that come through in blazing colours. Vince Vaughn delivers his
best performance since his breakthrough role in SWINGERS (8.5/10), with
a character that could easily have been played without much care, but
instead, we find a well-rounded human being whose continually
interesting to watch, and a joy to deconstruct. Granting that I've
never been much of an Anne Heche fan should draw further notice to my
acclamation of her rock-solid performance, while Joaquin Phoenix plays
his part with a big heart and sensitive touch, likely to bring tears to
your eyes. </P>
<P>The two negative points in this otherwise extremely compelling drama
would be Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance and performance as the
one-dimensional reporter with a dire need for acting lessons, and the
uninspired and trite budding of romance among a couple of the
characters. Other than that, make sure that you bring plenty of
tissues, if you're the type of person that cries (Mrs. JoBlo is guilty
as charged...again!), and prepare to be transported through some of the
darkest passages of your consciousness, while attempting to complete
the answers to some of the most personal questions rustling through
this fine film. A summer blockbuster it is not, but a thought-provoking
story, it is.</P>
