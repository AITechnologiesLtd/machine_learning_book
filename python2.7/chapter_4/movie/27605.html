<P>In French, "chocolat" means both chocolate and hot chocolate. In 
1988  there was another film by that title, a splendid 
socio-political work which had nothing to do with sweets but was 
director Claire Denis's  semi-autobiographical reminiscence of her 
youth in then colonial French Cameroun's (sic) in North-West Africa.</P>
<P>By coincidence, the year 2000 also saw "Thanks for the Chocolate," 
the 52d feature by the redoubtable Claude Chabrol. It won the major 
Delluc Prize in France, has not yet arrived in the USA, and has 
little to do with food --even though Chabrol is the most 
gastronomy-oriented of major directors.</P>
<P>Our "Chocolat" is only indirectly political, as it refers to forces 
of enlightenment versus obscurantist and conservatist attitudes. But 
it does fit nicely within the sub-genre of "food movies and their 
magic," one that includes the Mexican "Like Water  for Chocolate," 
the American  "Big Night,"  and the great Danish :Babette's Feast." 
(The fine Canadian lesbian film "Better than Chocolate" gets its 
title indirectly as its protagonist happens to be a chocomaniac).</P>
<P>Director Lasse Hallstrom made several movies in his native Sweden. 
"My Life as a Dog" rightly became an international hit and led to 
America. There he made the quirky and under-seen "Once Around," the 
lauded "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," the fair "Something to Talk 
About," and the excellent "The Cider House Rules." </P>
<P>Hallstrom's movies have originality and deal with offbeat 
characters. With "Chocolat" he goes several steps further by giving 
us a real fairy tale. It is Lent time in 1959.  In a French village, 
single mother Vianne (Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Thivisol of 
"Ponette" fame) appear out of nowhere. (Juliette Binoche's most 
recent films include the "Three Colors" series, "The English 
Patient" and "Alice and Martin.") </P>
<P>Vianne has come to purchase a derelict "chocolaterie." Where her 
money comes from, how she transforms the locale into a decorated, 
well-equipped shop with chocolates, truffles and other goodies to 
die for, plus other aspects of the film, remain a mystery. But after 
all the movie is an A to Z pantasy. Before you know it, the place 
looks great -- and he confections can make audiences drool. This 
shop is a genuine "salivatorium."</P>
<P>Soon Vianne has a small group of faithful followers, including the 
curmudgeonly  old Mrs. Amande Voizin (Dench) who early on had 
declared the shop's look to be "early Mexican bordello." But she 
gets tamed and forms a trio with Vianne and Josephine (Lena Olin who 
is Mr. Hallstrom's wife and had co-starred with Binoche in "The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being.") Josephine, first shown as a 
kleptomaniac then as a battered wife,  leavesher abusing bar-owner 
husband, finds refuge in the chocolaterie, gets prettier, becomes 
Vianne's co-worker and finally--just like Madame Voizin-- can smile, 
laugh and be normal.</P>
<P>The chocolates, the hot chocolate and other sweets have magic 
ingredients, including hot chili peppers. Also odd names such as 
"Nipples of Venus." Tasting almost anything does miracles, changes 
lives, lifestyles and attitudes.</P>
<P>But -- there's always a "but" in fairy tales--, there is Opposition 
with a capital O. The village's uncontested boss and Mayor (the 
England-born  Alfred Molina, he of a thousand faces) is the Comte de 
Reynaud. His word is law, his odd religiosity a kind of substitute 
for a traumatized psyche. He covers up the fact that his wife has 
left him for good (why is not explained but could be guessed) by 
pretending that she keeps extending her trip abroad.</P>
<P>The other major character is the Mayor's secretary, husbandless 
Madame Clairmont (Moss), a high-bourgeoisie lady with a talented 
young son, Luc. She is also the estranged daughter of old Mrs. 
Voizin and forbids Luc to talk to his grandmother.. And she's 
against the chocolate shop and its people. (There are reasons given, 
sort of reasons, that is. Don't expect Cartesian logic.)</P>
<P>The Count is a fine specimen of unreasonable intolerance. When 
defied by Vianne, he reminds her that his ancestors had put to the 
sword hordes of Protestants (or Albigensian heretics?)  He 
communicates his dislike of Vianne to the parishioners, who follow 
meekly, and tries to do the same to the very young new priest who is 
smart, tolerant and not taken in by the "capital offense" of Vianne 
who dares open her place while Lent is going on.</P>
<P>How the plot develops must remain unsaid, except for the later 
addition of Johnny Depp. He shows up on water, with other river rats 
who, much like gypsies, are disdained, mistrusted and indeed opposed 
by the villagers. This adds another element of discrimination 
against people who are "different" by knee-jerkily religious, 
extreme-right, sclerotic, unthinking peasants. The film's main body 
goes from Lent in 1959 to Lent the following year.</P>
<P>The  message is tranparently about tolerance vs. mindless 
suspiciousness, but it is also a paean to gustatory delights. Food 
is a religion in France, but it can co-exist with "regular" faith, 
just as tradition can peacefully co-exist with novelty. The story 
reminds me of the near-classic in the early days of the Cold War's 
Red Scare (and future  McCarthyism) "The Boy With Green Hair" 
(1948). A war orphan wakes up with green hair one day, and that's 
enough to make him "different" and discriminated against.</P>
<P>"Chocolat" is most entertaining, light even when things get serious, 
often very funny (note the parts with the young priest.)I. It was 
made mostly in England, with some footage in France. I suspect that 
the real French village used was for high shots of rooftops, later 
patched in with studio scenes. All the performers speak in English 
with a variety of would-be French accents. A delicious film, easy on 
the eyes and, I hope, on the digestion of any chocolate-eating 
actors. </P>
