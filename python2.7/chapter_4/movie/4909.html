                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Review written in 1989  (original theatrical release reviewed)</P>
<P>   Mix together 2001, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, ALIENS, and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE
and you have THE ABYSS, director James Cameron's incredibly ambitious
underwater adventure.  Cameron has gone for broke in his attempt to chart
new cinematic territory--to boldly go where no director has gone before. 
He has created a sci-fi love story of epic proportions, one that is
surprisingly provocative.  Despite flaws in the film's execution, one has
to be impressed by the scope and scale of Cameron's vision.</P>
<P>   In one of the most grueling shoots in film history, THE ABYSS was
filmed 30 feet underwater in a 7.5 million gallon concrete tank.  The
movie is set aboard Deepcore, a submersible, commercial oil rig which is
commandeered by the Navy to investigate a crashed nuclear submarine.  The
Navy sends a team of SEAL (Sea, Air, and Land) divers down to the rig to
lead its civilian crew on a search expedition.</P>
<P>   In the lead roles, Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio hold their
own against the hardware and special effects--playing, respectively, Bud
Brigman, the foreman in charge of Deepcore's crew, and his estranged wife
Lindsey, a self-described "cast-iron bitch" who designed the revolutionary
oil rig.  The two characters rekindle their love while all hell is
breaking loose on the ocean floor; they find themselves contending with a
hurricane, some mysterious alien sea creatures, and a Navy officer who is
suffering from water pressure-induced psychosis.</P>
<P>   Technically, THE ABYSS is dazzling--a cinematic knockout.  The movie's
budget is rumored to have exceeded $50 million, and it's a good bet that
nearly every penny is on the screen.  Perhaps most startling and
awe-inspiring is the sound; THE ABYSS offers the most dramatic utilization
of Dolby stereo surround I've ever heard.  The movie is a triumph of sound
editing, especially when blasted through a state of the art THX sound
system.  Clinking chains, whirring motors, and gasping breaths engulf the
audience from every direction.</P>
<P>   Visually, THE ABYSS is no less stunning.  Cameron's direction--as well
as the movie's cinematography, underwater sets, and special effects--are
spectacular.  One particularly gripping moment comes when Cameron shoots
from inside a diver's helmet; the tension and claustrophobia are almost
unbearable.  THE ABYSS passes its most important test: it creates the
illusion that the action is actually unfolding half a mile beneath the
ocean's surface.  Cameron's film is beautifully and lovingly crafted and
so overwhelmingly massive that it leaves you in a state of sensory
overload.</P>
<P>   Cameron also wrote THE ABYSS, but unfortunately his spiritual story of
the unknown is full of leaks.  First, it's riddled with too many loose
ends, holes, and above all, implausibilities.  The movie strains its
credibility at every twist and turn to the point where it sometimes even
unintentionally draws laughter from the audience.  The characters seem to
rely on luck more often than their own resources to get themselves out of
sticky situations.  For example, a crew member awakens from a coma at just
the right moment to save his comrades.  Second, except for the two leads,
the members of the rescue team are forgettable, stock characters.  When
three crew members drown early in the film, their deaths have no emotional
impact whatsoever.  None of the supporting actors leaves a lasting
impression, except for Michael Biehn (TERMINATOR, ALIENS) as the deranged
SEAL officer; Biehn deserves credit for trying to flesh out his cardboard
character.  Third, the movie takes itself so seriously that it often
borders on pretentious melodrama. </P>
<P>   For the above reasons, THE ABYSS is often difficult to swallow at face
value, and you never totally buy the situation.  Unlike THE TERMINATOR and
ALIENS, Cameron's two previous films, THE ABYSS fails to completely absorb
you into its fantasy world.  The movie hit the theaters over a month
behind schedule because of production and special effects delays, which
perhaps explains its unfinished feel.  It almost seems as if Cameron
hurried his final cut, in which case the holes and loose-ends may be
rooted in the editing room rather than in the screenplay.
   At two hours and twenty minutes, THE ABYSS is about half an hour too
long.  Cameron spends too much time setting up the conflict, and he also
tries to cram too many themes into the film.  The alien subplot, while
providing an excuse for some nifty special effects, is ultimately no more
than a recycled Hollywood cliche.  The movie also superficially
introduces, and then fails to explore, the political undercurrents
surrounding the issue of nuclear weapons (the sunken sub houses warheads
with 5 times the power of Hiroshima).  THE ABYSS tries to tread through so
much water that everything seems half-baked, except for the touching love
story between Bud and Lindsey.</P>
<P>   In Cameron's capable hands, however, the cup is definitely half-full
rather than half-empty.  Once all the plot strands are in place, the movie
kicks into high gear and offers the intense, riveting action that is
Cameron's forte.  One of the most nerve-wracking scenes has Bud and
Lindsey stranded in a flooding capsule with only one oxygen suit between
them in which to swim back to the oil rig.  Panic sets in as they (and we)
realize that only one of them can escape alive.  While THE ABYSS doesn't
match the breakneck pace of ALIENS or the frightening suspense of THE
TERMINATOR, it contains enough nail-biting tension to leave you without
finger nails.</P>
<P>   THE ABYSS will undoubtedly spark heated debates between its fans and
its foes, like two other recent big-budget extravaganzas with lofty
aspirations: BATMAN and THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.  Visually, all
three films are astonishing.  They differ considerably, however, in the
strength of their scripts.  In BATMAN, director Tim Burton complements the
film's dramatic film noir look with a story that, while not fully
developed, is absorbing and compelling.  BARON MUNCHAUSEN, on the other
hand, is all flash and no substance; it leaves you altogether indifferent
to the characters and plot.  THE ABYSS, by comparison, falls somewhere in
between these two extremes.  The blossoming love between Bud and Lindsey
and their desperate battle for survival on the ocean floor provide enough
human drama to make THE ABYSS more than just a technical achievement.</P>
<P>   After all is said and done, THE ABYSS is not Cameron's strongest work. 
The film really doesn't break that much new ground.  Its mystical feeling
is too reminiscent of 2001, and its climax makes me wonder if THE ABYSS
should have been called "Close Encounters of the Sub-Oceanic Kind." 
Without the spiritual and extraterrestrial nonsense, THE ABYSS would have
worked splendidly as a straightforward survival thriller.  Even so, it
remains a complex, challenging must-see for adventure fans, one that will
leave your ears ringing, your heart pumping, and your head spinning.</P>
<P>NOTE:  THE ABYSS (1993 Special Edition):  ***1/2</P>
