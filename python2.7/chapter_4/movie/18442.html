Length: 081 minutes
Year: 1997

<P>Mima is a singer in a popular pop idol group. Then one day, she decides to
forgo her singing career for a serious acting. But alas, she got only a
minor role to contend to, and so, to further her career, she chose to strip
and even appear in a rape sequence in the film. But things are not going
fine for her. First, she received threats. Then, she found a fan page
dedicated to her is actually reporting on her every move. Next a mysterious
figure, claiming to be the real her, started appearing everywhere and
talking to her. And she started developing memory lapses, forgetting what
she has done in those hours. And finally people are getting murdered around
her in the most gruesome way possible during her lapses. But who is the
killer? Is it the mysterious security guard that is stalking her? Or is it
her friends? Or could it be Mima herself? But is she capable of murder?
Forewarned, the anime is not for the squeamish. For though Perfect Blue runs
at only 81 minutes, it contains enough nudity and violence for a longer
film, and the murders occurred is at its most violent. But Perfect Blue may
be, in my opinion, the best Japanese animation in this years Singapore
International Film Festival. It does not delve in the usual science fiction
that Japanese anime normally deals in. It deals, however, with the dark
reality of film-makings. Also, Perfect Blue is also a murder mystery.
Everything you see in the film may or may not be reality. As for the ending,
I would spoil it for you. See for yourself and be amazed.</P>
