<P>   What's the story on this movie?  Is this the sort of film
that requires the mentality of an immature 12-year-old or
by pushing the envelope on vulgarity has crossover appeal
and the makings of a breakout smash?  The first, if you go
along with AP critic Christie Lemire, who's apparently
afraid of being considered a prude. The latter if you're at
one with Joe Leydon of  "Variety," whose mind is keen and
way, way open for the likes of the Wayans brothers.</P>
<P>    To get the answer simply add those reviews and divide
by two and you get a movie which, when it's funny, it's
very funny; when it's vulgar, it's very very vulgar; and as 
for immature and repetitious and bordering on tedium, it's
that too.</P>
<P>   If you took your Aunt Sherry from Sioux Falls to see this
and if the last movie she saw fell under the Hollywood
code, "If a couple are in bed, each must have at least one
foot on the floor," she'd disinherit you.  She wouldn't
believe her eyes.  If you introduced the movie to your
open-minded intellectual friend Herbie and Herbie never
saw Scream 1, 2 or 3, he wouldn't have the foggiest about
what's going on.  But if you've been brought up on the
likes of "Friday the 13th," the "Scream" Trilogy, "The Blair
Witch Project," "Amistad," "The Sixth Sense" and others
and at the same time appreciate some darn good smut
and offensiveness (think "Clerks" or anything by the
Farrelly Brothers), you are the targeted audience whether
you're 18 or 80.  </P>
<P>  The no-holds-barred script is by committee and it shows. 
"Scary Movie" does not have a tight narrative. In fact you
could not be faulted for wondering whether the plot serves
only as Krazy Glue for a succession of one-liners, sit-
comish wisecracks and practical jokes, the best coming
during the opening half hour when the unwavering, swift
pace hits you with the first gag within 30 seconds.  The
movie is so up-to-the-minute, citing even a quickie from
"Big Momma's House," that you'd think it was made fresh
for the audience of the day only to be recycled for the next
day's crowd with the addition of something to rib the
producers of whatever came out last Friday.  Keenan Ivory
Wayans is best known to the movie crowd for his take-off
of the 1970s blaxploitation films with his "I'm Gonna Get
You, Sucka" (with Wayans in the role of Jack Spade out to
avenge the death of his brother who died of an o.g., or
overdose of gold chains).  Wayans has not changed his
style in the dozen years since that one hit the market, still
playing it loose and good-natured, making clear at every
point that we're watching actors who are self-consciously
watching the cameraman.   The performers playing high-
school kids are all in their twenties and thirties, co-opting
those who would find fault with that sort of casting by
cracking a joke about that very shortcoming.  </P>
<P>   Some plot points: Having run over a pedestrian on the
highway whom they thought dead and dumping him into the
river, the kids have made a pact to tell no-one about their
actions that night.  But when a knife-wielding creature with a
scream mask begins drawing blood on the campus of B.A.
Corpse High School, they naturally assume that the brute is
the hapless pedestrian out for revenge.  The first juicy killing
brings in reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri), who will do
anything to get a story--and she means anything--thereby
leading to a line of smutty jokes that pop up here and there in
this freewheeling story.  We are soon introduced to the
characteristics of each player, including the virginal Cindy
(Anna Faris) and her horny boy friend Bobby (Jon
Abrahams); a goofy cop named Doofy (Dave Sheridan)
who is modeled on the slow-thinking Dewey of the Scream
series; a sheriff with an eye for the young 'uns (Kurt
Fuller); a pot-smoking doofus and bmoc football player
(Marlon and Shawn Wayans); and a number of others,
each with a sharply individual personality.</P>
<P>   At time these individuals take themselves so seriously--
steering clear of winking to the audience in a way that
could ruin the effect of the satire--that feminists in the
audience might actually take offense at the beatings that
only the women seem to be getting at the hands of the
men.  If the great English satirist Jonathan Swift were
alive today, he'd think his "A Modest Proposal" was too
modest indeed.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 88 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
