<PRE>Scream 3 -- *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee
Rated R (excessive violence, language), 110 minutes, 2000. Dimension. Neve
Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey,
Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Liev Schreiber. Directed by Wes Craven.</P>
<P>There was a lot riding on this movie. Everyone even moderately interested in
the "Scream" series was dying to know how it would end. What would be the
"final act"? This is the end of an era for them, a movie which has kept them up
nights searching for clues on the Internet, talking and tossing around rumors
with their equally enthused buddies, and, for kids under 17, those elaborate
plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "Scream"
while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older
than themselves. No need to worry; "Scream 3" is endlessly inventive and
entertaining, a fine epilogue to the series that made Kevin Williamson a
household name, reinvented the horror genre, and continued in the
self-referential, post-modern tradition of Quentin and co.</P>
<P>So, how does the story go? As opposed to what some fanatical Internet sites
would have you believe, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), now all-grown-up and
constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her
psyche, is not living in Hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress,
but rather in upstate California, living, understandably, alone in the confines
of fences and vast security systems. She works at home as a crisis center
affiliate over the phone. But thatâ€™s not where the movie starts off. Instead,
in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar, and conceptually
horrifying, sequence in "Eye For An Eye" (1995), Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber),
now a big star, drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls,
demands the location of Sidneyâ€™s home, and, when he doesnâ€™t get it,
threatens the life of Cottonâ€™s girlfriend Christine, and Cotton canâ€™t do
anything to stop him. The rest of the sequence is particularly clever, setting
up a constant throughout the picture: the killer has a high-tech electronic
voice-changer that tops that of the first two. Not only does he sound
unmistakably like talented voice-over artist Roger Jackson (ha, ha), he can now
easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters, including Sidney, and the
returned Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David
Arquette).</P>
<P>At the same time, Stab 3, the third film-within-a-film based around the
characters and events of Woodsboro and Windsor College, has taken a less
authentic approach this time around in Return To Woodsboro; whereas the account
of the first two films was true, the franchise within "Scream" has now become
totally fictional. Nevertheless, we learn, Cotton made an appearance in the
movie which is now in production, as himself to be killed off in the first
scene. So, it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in
which they bite it in the movieâ€'either the actor portraying them, or the real
thing. Sometimes both. Clever, indeed. But, who goes next? No one knows. Three
different scripts were penned, weâ€™re told, to keep the true finale off the
Internet (a nod to the "Scream" 2 fiasco a few years back) and no one knows for
sure which one the killer read.</P>
<P>Still, all the while Sidney stays concealed in her home, only visiting dad for
the first half-hour of the film, while also having horrifying visions of her
mother, which takes us back a bit to Sidneyâ€™s fear of becoming what her
mother wasâ€'or, at least, what her mother was secretly. When Sidney finally
ventures out to Hollywood as the murders become more prevalent, sheâ€™s chased
onto the set of Stab 3, wandering through "Woodsboro," written and directed as
an odd, surreal, nightmare indeed, this is one of "Scream 3"â€™s finest
moments.</P>
<P>Okay, over the years, Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™ve become quite the "Scream" fan.
No, I donâ€™t have the Ghostface costume or the directorâ€™s cut laserdisc, but
I often find myself compelled to pop in the DVD of either member of the
preceding duo, and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these
films (yes, I said "dramatic element"), sometimes debating with family and
friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become
quintessentially affiliated with "Scream".</P>
<P>Throughout the film, though, I noticed a much more subtle approach than the
other two films. Granted that thereâ€™s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout,
but thereâ€™s considerably less blood, less gore. Honestly, I like this
approach. Itâ€™s more classical, more rebellious, constantly demonstrating the
capable direction of Wes Craven. He knows when to hold back and at the same
time makes the movie ooze with energy, illustrating the delicate poise flowing
from his years of experience. Some critics have noted that "Scream 3" seems to
take itself more seriously this time; maybe so, or maybe screenwriter Ehren
Kruger (Arlington Road), who took over after Williamson had scheduling
conflicts, saw an opportunity for true ironyâ€'maybe even a little bit of
satireâ€'if the film worked in a few more clichÃ©s.</P>
<P>What puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film, Iâ€™m
afraid, is the ending, or, rather, the identity of the killer. It does the job,
I guess, accomplishes what it should, bringing the three films full circle, but
upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a
little too contrived, too arbitrary; after a second viewing, which I endeavored
upon due to this recurring disapprobation, the killerâ€™s identity still seems
a little too random, but his motivation came across more sound this time
around, and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying.</P>
<P>All in all, "Scream 3" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a
trilogy: it is not the worst of the films. As a trilogy, "Scream" was a lot of
fun; refreshing, humorous, offbeat. Almost sad to see it go. But then, it does
seem best to quit while youâ€™re ahead, and "Scream 3" does a fine job of
providing closure to its characters. For now, "Scream" holds the title as the
finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid. Not too shabby.</P>
