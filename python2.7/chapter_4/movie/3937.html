<PRE>                                 DANGEROUS MINDS
       A film review by Mike Gosea, Eric Hollins, and Jenny Stevenson
        Copyright 1995 Mike Gosea, Eric Hollins, and Jenny Stevenson</PRE>
<PRE>Year: 1995
Staring: Michelle Pfeiffer
Rating: 4 of 5 stars</PRE>
<P>        Hollywood Pictures' DANGEROUS MINDS is a well-done modern
interpretation of the classic "lost kids are saved by a teacher with an
attitude" theme.  Similar to the film STAND AND DELIVER, this drama and
street action movie is certainly worth the cost at your local theatre.  The
film is well done with a nice touch of the true ghetto feeling that one can
relate to.  The screen and camera play exceeds the standard and the hip-hop
soundtrack will have you bouncing in your seat.  The talented yet largely
unkwown cast has put together one of the better films of this summer....</P>
