<PRE>A pain in the neck
The Watcher</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Spader's tough, but depressed, cop performance is mesmerizing. How could
anybody in their right mind be afraid of Keanu Reeves? That takes an expert
actor. Spader does such a great job that you might even come to fear Keanu
too ... a little bit? Maybe? Well, fear not (er, I mean, don't worry),
there's a good movie here -- even if the bad guy isn't all that frightening.</P>
<P>Basically, Spader, out on workman's comp because of the drugs for the
insomnia and migraines due in part to an LA serial strangler (Reeves), has
moved to Chicago in search of peace and a good psychologist. Unfortunately,
Reeves, missing the special way Spader used to pursue him, packs his piano
wire and sets up shop in the windy city.</P>
<P>Psychologist (Tomei), "Maybe you're just afraid."
Spader, "You're f-ing right I'm afraid."</P>
<P>This well paced film, backed by thumpin' tunes, moves with strength. All
involved act well, with Spader topping the list; though his later scenes
aren't too bad, Reeves is simply miscast. (Leave the pretty-boy crazed
killer gig to Brad Pitt.)</P>
<P>Another major distraction to the project is overuse of a passé digital
effect - strobe. Every time the image juts across the screen, my teeth
grind. But maybe I'm biased, thinking it pretty cool, I overused that effect
myself many years ago with my own shorts. Seeing it here nauseated me while
denigrating the overall quality of the production.</P>
<P>Also, midway into the story, Reeves steps into Spader's psychologist's
office posing as a potential patient. This new twist to the personal game of
chess between he and Spader waxes extremely promising. Terribly intrigued to
see it develop, audiences may very well be dismayed when it drops out of the
film like a dead body.</P>
<P>Lastly in a third act face to face, a gritty overworked Spader draws his gun
on a smilingly giddy unarmed Reeves; sorry, I don't believe Spader would
turn an ear before taking a shot at some limb or other.</P>
<P>Still, overall, a very strong B+. This film is stirring, has action, humor,
and great dialogue (the Spader character is artfully drawn and portrayed).
It's not all that scary, though a few victims do get a bit choked up - you
probably won't.</P>
