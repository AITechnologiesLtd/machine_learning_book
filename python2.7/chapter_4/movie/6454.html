<P>     Tragic, perhaps, the fate that befalls the Disney 'toon.  In
recent years, our most-beloved family features have been transformed
into Saturday morning cartoons (THE LION KING), sequelized in made-
for-video movies (ALADDIN), and, even, staged on Broadway as fully-
functioning musical productions (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  Is anyone
really surprised, then, by a live-action remake of ONE HUNDRED AND ONE
DALMATIANS?  Talk about future marketing strategy!  Just pick any ol'
classic in Walt's vaults, re-release it into theaters, then re-release
it on video, and then remake it as a big-budget "event picture." Throw
in a boatload of licensed products, a video re- lease for the remake,
and a subsequent airing on ABC/Disney, and you've made millions.  If
not billions.  Repeat every five years-- duh, to cash in on the
current crop of toddlers-- and another four-way stock split before
the end of the decade is guaranteed.  Just like that.</P>
<P>    Happily, the sound of ringing registers is but a soft echo in this
exceptionally warm and fuzzy (furry?) remake.  Jeff Daniels and Joely
Richardson have a wonderful chemistry as the London dog owners who
fall in love after their Dalmatians do.  (Though I had to think twice
if I was watching the guy who played the President in INDEPENDENCE
DAY.  No, that was Bill Pullman.) They're also a world more interest-
ing than Glenn Close, whose narrow performance as Cruella De Vil is
the year's most overrated.  (Blame the script.  As written, she's less
a cruel villain than a campy eccentric.) Most impressive are the
technical credits, from art direction to animal handling to location
photography.  Some of the best production work of the year is on
display.</P>
<P>     Too bad that the script, by John Hughes, doesn't let the dogs
talk.  Several later sequences of inter-breed interaction are
particularly tiresome.  (Woof.  Cut to dog barking.  Woof.  Cut to
other dog listening.  Woof.  Cut to first dog running in direction of
second dog.  Repeat several times.) Another major problem of the
script is Hughes' overabundance of violent physical humor.  Okay, I
laughed at the bumbling bad guys (Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, both
nicely underplaying) getting their 'nads fried on an electric fence,
but this movie really deserves something more than the unintended
alternate title of HOME ALONE 3: SEEING SPOTS.  I don't even know if I
can recommend this to young kids, as they'd probably fall asleep
somewhere in the middle.  </P>
