Screenplay: Steve Oedekerk</P>
<P>On-screen couples don't come any odder than "Nothing to Lose"'s Tim
Robbins and Martin Lawrence. The pairing of Robbins (coming off a career
high from directing and writing the enlightening Dead "Man Walking") and
Lawrence (coming off a career low from directing, writing and acting in
the horrible "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate") could have resulted in
a quirky good time, but "Nothing to Lose" has almost nothing on its mind
-- and the result is a 97-minute running time that feels about as long
as three viewings of "The English Patient."</P>
<P>Robbins is well-cast as Nick Beam, an even-tempered Los Angeles
advertising executive whose serene, routine life is interrupted through
a series of hapless coincidences. Nick's happy marriage to wife Anne
(the omnipresent Kelly Preston) is turned topsy-turvy when he returns
home from work early one day to discover what appears to be her in bed
with another man -- and the cufflinks on the downstairs endtable suggest
that it's his boss (Michael McKean). Distraught and upset, Nick hops
into his car and goes on a drive to clear his head. When he's at a
stoplight, novice hoodlum T. Paul (Lawrence) attempts to car-jack him --
but T. Paul has clearly picked the wrong guy on the wrong day.</P>
<P>Nick steps on the gas and doesn't let off until he and his new "friend"
are well out of the city limits. They strike up a hostile, chummy
rapport that leads to many disagreements, most of them over T. Paul's
habit of robbing from convenience stores to support his family. This
gives Nick an idea, albeit a naughty one -- why not steal from his own
boss as payback for sleeping with his wife? To top everything off,
Nothing to Lose also introduces us to another set of criminals (John C.
McGinley and Giancarlo Esposito), only these guys are hardcore into
their profession, and the local police keep on getting their exploits
confused with those of Nick and T. Paul.</P>
<P>Robbins is a likable guy, and Lawrence can be such when he wants, so
it's a surprise that the time they share together falls flat on its
face. The two have no chemistry whatsoever, a testament to how poorly we
get to know Nick and T. Paul as a duo. We are unwisely spared the
moments when they first meet -- the movie jumps from T. Paul's failed
hold-up to a scene where they're stopping for food many miles away.
"Nothing to Lose" never tries to explain their relationship to us, and
therefore it totally overlooks what likely could have been its best
scenes. In place of development is a long, violent sequence where Nick
and T. Paul knock each other around outside a diner. It's as if nobody
knew what else to do.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong -- "Nothing to Lose" does contain its fair share of
out-loud laughs. It's just that none of them belong to either Robbins or
Lawrence -- they're given to supporting performers that are each
utilized for about one brief scene each. There's a good bit with an
elderly general store clerk who gives Nick pointers on how to be a
better criminal. Director/writer Steve Oedekirk cleverly casts himself
as a security guard who's a slave to the rhythm. Great character actress
Irma P. Hall is fine in her two bits as T. Paul's slaphappy mother. And
the film's brightest sequence is executed early on, with Nick
criticizing an employee for creating a "magical" trail of chocolate
chips that follows a cookie company's mascot -- the semi-sweet morsels
hilariously resemble excrement.</P>
<P>"Nothing to Lose" is never a terrible movie, but I still don't think I
could subject myself to it again. When the film is smart, it can really
catch you off guard. But that's almost a rarity, because the story takes
turns being either too silly or too socially relevant. There's even a
plot twist near the movie's midsection that's insubstantial because it
should surprise no one who observed closely and listened carefully
during the film's first 20 minutes. All these weaknesses make it clear
that there's not much to gain from watching "Nothing to Lose."</P>
