<P>_Girl,_Interrupted_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The title of _Girl,_Interrupted_ bears a singular subject, but audiences
will likely walk out of James Mangold's adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's
memoir thinking of two "girls"--Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, who further
cement their reputations as two of the most gifted young screen actresses
today.  It's unfortunate, however, that the script often isn't as strong as
they are.  But what is fortunate is that their performances more than
compensate for the shortcomings in the writing department.</P>
<P>Ryder plays the "girl" of the title, Susanna, who in the 1960s is sent to
the Claymoore mental hospital after pressure from her parents and a
therapist.  Though she was hospitalized for chasing a bottle of aspirin with
a bottle of vodka, Susanna is more depressed and unmotivated than truly
mentally ill--a statement which doesn't necessarily hold true for her peers
at Claymoore.  Her roommate is Georgina (Clea Duvall), a pathological liar;
she also spends time with self-inflicted burn victim Polly (Elisabeth Moss)
and laxative junkie Daisy (Brittany Murphy).</P>
<P>Susanna ends up bonding most strongly with the most volatile patient, Lisa
(Jolie), whom we first meet being dragged back into the ward after an escape
attempt.  Dangerous, carefree, and intensely charismatic, Lisa cannot help
but captivate Susanna's attention--and that of the audience.  It's a role
perfectly suited for Best Supporting Actress Oscar aspirations, and Jolie
(who has already garnered a Golden Globe nod and the Broadcast Film Critics
Association's Supporting Actress prize) runs with the opportunity.  There's
more to her performance than the expected fits and teary breakdowns; she is
able to make Lisa into a multidimensional person, with real humanity behind
the histrionics.  She will undoubtedly be competing for the golden statuette
in March.</P>
<P>By comparison, more likely to be overlooked is Ryder's performance, which is
very much Jolie's equal.  Susanna is basically the calm audience surrogate
in the middle of the storm, but the fact that she remains a strong presence
amid the flashier turns is a tribute to the effectiveness of Ryder's
measured, no-frills work.  Despite the many spotlight-stealing moments
afforded to Lisa, _Girl,_Interrupted_ is Susanna's story of growth, and one
is able to see her progression through Ryder's nuanced performance.</P>
<P>Less subtle, however, is the script by Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anna
Hamilton Phelan.  I think the honest portrait of these troubled young women
makes engrossing enough viewing, but the writers have decided to manufacture
blatantly "movie" situations for dramatic purposes.  It's an understandable
decision, but the mechanics behind such contrived scenes as an angry,
tear-stained climactic confrontation between Susanna and Lisa are a bit too
obvious and distracting to be completely believable.</P>
<P>Yet one does buy into such scenes to a certain degree, again thanks to the
work of the cast and the overall power of the story.  _Girl,_Interrupted_
may ultimately be a film, underrealized; but its desired emotional effect is
more than adequately achieved.</P>
