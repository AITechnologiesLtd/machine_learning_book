<PRE>Introduction
============</PRE>
<P>     Why are the trailers giving away so much plot, these days?  I've
seen *far* more of NICK OF TIME, FATHER OF THE BRIDE II, and MR.
HOLLAND'S OPUS that I ever necessarily needed to.  The ads for OTHELLO
look good, though, and wisely avoid overdoing the dialogue.  (Here's a
thought: how about Demi as Desdemona?  Moor versus Moore?  Iago-a-
go-go?  Imagine the ending to *that* one!)  The new Woody Allen, MIGHTY
APHRODITE, is in limited release and doesn't open in our area until
November 10th.  Grrr.  The same weekend as ACE VENTURA 2.  The other
big dates:  November 17th, for AMERICAN PRESIDENT and GOLDENEYE, and
November 22nd, for FOUR ROOMS, CASINO, TOY STORY, and, maybe, MONEY
TRAIN, NICK OF TIME, and WAITING TO EXHALE.  Phew.</P>
<PRE>BLUE IN THE FACE
================</PRE>
<P>     I walked out of SMOKE; I stayed for BLUE IN THE FACE.  Paul Auster
and Wayne Wang's improvised, quasi-sequel to SMOKE is a mildly
diverting, occasionally hilarious love-letter to the borough with an
attitude.  Short sketches, star testimonials, and man-on-the-street
interviews make for an amusing, if slight, exploration of all things
that are Brooklyn.  So, in addition to cameos by Madonna, Lou Reed, Jim
Jarmusch, Lily Tomlin, Mira Sorvino, and Michael J. Fox, expect plenty
of talk about the Dodgers, Belgian waffles, and plastic bags in the
trees.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>DEAD PRESIDENTS
===============</PRE>
<P>     Three movies in one.  A coming-of-age tale set in the South Bronx,
a tour of duty in Vietnam, and an armored car heist.  The last is the
one that they show in all the ads, and the least successful segment in
this well-intentioned period drama from Albert and Allen Hughes (MENACE
II SOCIETY).  Good humor and honest performances in the first segment
lead into a stunning war sequence that's not for the faint- hearted.
(Severed heads and strewn intestines, anyone?)  The Big Heist, at the
end, is where the narrative becomes choppy.  Huge chunks of the story
seem to be missing, perhaps to trim an already- healthy running time?
By the end, nothing makes sense.  If there's an overt social statement
lurking about, it's buried under a mound of other, unresolved issues.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>A MONTH BY THE LAKE
===================</PRE>
<P>     The polite chemistry between Edward Fox and Vanessa Redgrave is
the reason to watch this frothy, light comedy about a pair of Britons
vacationing at a lakeside resort in Italy.   The veteran actors are a
joy to behold, despite director John Irvin's incessant close-ups and a
story that sags toward the end.  Uma Thurman co-stars as an American
nanny whose disposable flirting with Fox gets taken far more seriously
than it should be.  She's also a bit of a sore thumb, here, in
comparison to the more-distinguished acting styles of the others.
>From the novella by H. E. Bates.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
<PRE>VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN
===================</PRE>
<P>     Eddie Murphy sucks.  Authentic horror director Wes Craven
(NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) tries in vain (vein?) to strike a balance
between the jugular and the funny bone.  He fails at almost every
cross.  Eddie sleepwalks through his undead performance as a Caribbean
Count, scouting the borough for his half-vampire mate (Angela Bassett,
who has seen stranger days).  The laughs are few, the set design is
lousy, and there isn't one single campy cameo to speak of.  Even John
Landis did better with his half-baked INNOCENT BLOOD.</P>
