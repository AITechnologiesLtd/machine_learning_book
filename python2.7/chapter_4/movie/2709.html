<PRE>                                GO FISH
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This halting and spotty first
     production for director Rose Troche is the story of two
     very dissimilar lesbians who finally fall in love after
     much effort by friends.  The portrait of a lesbian
     subculture is not always flattering and often not even
     very interesting, but there are moments of clever wit.
     Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     GO FISH is the long, slow story of the meeting, slow romance, and
eventually getting together of two lesbians.  One is the attractive and
energetic Max (played by Guinevere Turner); the other is the more
introspective and almost masculine Ely (V. S. Brodie).  They seem
mismatched in looks, in tastes, and in temperaments.  But their friends
are determined to bring them together.</P>
<P>     Along the way we get a look at their lives and the lives of their
circle of friends in the lesbian sub-culture.  Superficially the women
in this small circle are witty and affable, in some ways like the menin
LONGTIME COMPANION.  But as time wears on they appear to have less and
less in their lives beyond tracking who in their group is sleeping with
whom.  The lesbians are shown to be aimless and self-absorbed and
fixated on the sex-lives of themselves and their friends.  Just
occasionally there is an on-target piece of sly if self-deprecating wit,
like a minutes-long conversation on what is just the perfect anatomical
euphemism to replace "honey-pot."  This neuron-numbing conversation is
both exasperating and funny, much like some of the writing in THIS IS
SPINAL TAP or FEAR OF A BLACK HAT.  Another pointed sequence shows the
women who daily had been the objects of bigotry bringing the same
bigotry to bear on one of their numbers who had experimented with
bisexuality.  With similar intolerance, Max's first reaction to Ely is
insulting rejection simply because Ely is unattractive.</P>
<P>     Perhaps part of the inspiration for this film was SHE'S GOTTA HAVE
IT, though Rose Troche simply does not move the plot along and does not
engage the viewer nearly as well as Spike Lee does.  This is a first
film for director Troche who co-produced, co-authored with actress
Turner.  In many ways the unevenness of the production betrays Troche's
inexperience.  The cinematography is crude and in black and white to
save costs.  Acting is very often at the high-school play level.  The
film is salted with odd visual images, apparently symbolic but usually
obscure or perhaps meaningless.  A device that is perhaps over-used to
give us the thought of the characters is to have them lie on the floor
head-to-head and discuss their innermost thoughts.  It is a crude
device, albeit occasionally useful to the script.  In Spike Lee's first
film he had characters talking directly to the camera as if being
interviewed and he used it for much the same purpose.</P>
<P>     Early in the film, one of the characters complains about "touchy-
feely, soft-focus, sisters-of-the-woodlands" sort of lesbian films and
this is clearly intended to be an alternative.  Whether it is intended
to be as self-critical of the urban lesbian subculture is questionable.
But even at its short length much of this film drags and is in need of a
tuning.  I rate this on a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
