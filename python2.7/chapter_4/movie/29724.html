<PRE>MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Good news!  Max Keeble's Big Move is the greatest movie ever made... if
you are 12 years old.  Its depiction of junior high is surprisingly
enlightening; kids from all over can identify with these simple
characters.  There's plenty of preteen gossip, wacky school staff
members, and drooling over attractive girls.  Thus it is a sure-fire hit
for its unabashed target audience.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I'm not 12 years old, and I really didn't need to be
reminded of those times I spent fighting with teachers, standing up to
bullies, and getting poor grades.  So if you're not in the 11- to
13-year-old target market, this film is only remotely amusing.</P>
<P>Not that Max Keeble's Big Move is painful to watch -- it's actually
pretty light-hearted and, at times, quite funny.  Considering the nature
of the beast, this movie isn't half bad.  The performances give a
relevant story energy and life, and the slapstick humor often makes you
laugh.  Guiltily, but you still laugh.</P>
<P>Alex D. Linz from Home Alone 3 plays the title character, who, as the
movie opens, enters junior high.  He's got friends, enemies, and a major
dilemma -- his father's business is moving.  The Keebles need to be out
of town by the end of the week, and Max doesn't want to leave his
hometown.  But wait!  If he doesn't need to worry about the
consequences, he has one last chance to settle a few scores.</P>
<P>Sadly, the film ultimately serves up a bunch of preachy boloney, stuff
about standing up for yourself, facing bullies, saving animals, and
every other lesson you can learn as a kid in middle school. 
Screenwriters Jonathan Bernstein, Mark Blackwell, and James Greer make
this such a silly, simple story, that when it finally does try to
provide the audience with a real moral, it comes off as just another
missed target.</P>
<P>The soundtrack defines each scene by filling the movie with the latest
in kiddie pop music.  This isn't a terrible idea since kids don't really
look for effective mood development, anyway -- instead the film is much
more interested in its own shallow sense of humor.</P>
