<PRE>ABSOLUTE POWER (1997)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>        Ever notice how too many movies are getting geared for the "young"
audience?   You know what I mean, little substance, too little plot,
just fast action, violence and sex that make millions at the box
office.   Amazingly enough, "Absolute Power" seems like a movie geared
for people in their 70s, with a great plot and great acting, but
atrociously slow and devoid of any excitement.</P>
<P>        "Absolute Power" tells the story of Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood), a
cat burglar who, while pulling off a robbery, gets in a hairy
predicament:  The supposedly "empty" mansion that Luther is robbing from
has visitors.   Luther hides, and sees a young women enter the room with
an older man; we can see from the expressions on Luther's face that he
vaguely recognizes the face.   The couple start to perform rough sex,
when things get too rough, the two start to fight, climaxing in a
violent struggle where the woman nearly kills the man when BLAM!   A
Secret Service agent has shot and killed the woman, and this mysterious
man is none other than: the President (Gene Hackman)!   What a great and
original plot!</P>
<P>        To boot, Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman do a great job acting their
respective roles.   So you ask, why does this picture get a -2?</P>
<P>        First of all, the movie is SLOW, and in many ways boring.   For
example, there is only one action piece in the entire movie, which
starts and ends quickly.   In addition, too much time is spent with the
sub-plot showing the relationship between Luther and his daughter (Laura
Linney).   Simply put, there is too much time in the
movie for interviews and talking, not enough for true suspense, plot
development, and action.   Even the opening robbery draws out for too
much time.   To put the nail in the coffin, the movie and plot wraps up
far too quickly and easily.</P>
<P>        Maybe it's my young mind at work, but "Absolute Power" crawls at a
snail's pace.  Only the strong acting by the two leads Eastwood and
Hackman save the picture from further punishment.</P>
<PRE>        Nick's Rating: -2</PRE>
<PRE>        *** Movies rated from -4 (worst) to +4 (best), 0 = average movie ***</PRE>
