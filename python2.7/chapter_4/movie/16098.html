<P>THE FACULTY ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A> )</P>

<P>starring Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall, Jordana Brewster
screenplay by Kevin Williamson
directed by Robert Rodriguez</P>
<P>Before Kevin Williamson came along, could anyone other than film
geeks/freaks name a living, working screenwriter? His name on a
movie's credits (sometimes before the title) is a signal to teenagers
that they're in for some post-Gen X irony-his screenplays assume
everyone born after 1980 grew up in a video store. (Often, as he's 
cribbing a plot, he'll refer to the source-the Breakfast Club episode
of "Dawson's Creek", for example.) Williamson is, in some circles,
even hipper than Quentin Tarantino is.</P>
<P>T2's Robert Patrick stars as a pent-up high school football coach
whose body is taken over by a parasitic alien; he proceeds to
contaminate virtually the entire faculty-most amusingly,
Ain't-It-Cool-News webmaster Harry Knowles (!) in his screen debut as
the Teacher Most In Need of a Treadmill. A group of rambunctious 
whippersnappers uncover this secret early on. Together, they search
for places to hide and a defense against their newfound enemies.</P>
<P>Said group of archetypal-make that stereotypical-teen heroes are as
follows: Delilah (Brewster), the head cheerleader and school beauty;
Stan (Shawn Hatosy), ex-captain of the football team and ex-boyfriend
of Delilah-a jock with a yearning for learning; Casey (Wood), the
underappreciated school nerd; Marybeth (Laura Harris), the naive new
girl in school; Zeke (Hartnett), the rebel without a comb, an
underachieving student who sells homemade drugs out of the trunk of
his car; and Stokeley (DuVall-be still my beating heart), the weirdo
gothic brainer who pretends she's a lesbian so guys will leave her
alone. Did I just describe the cast of The Breakfast Club? Here,
Williamson takes it a step further, as the characters look to the text
of Jack Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers for a solution to
their dilemma.</P>
<P>The real problem is that Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) is
such an efficient director (three staff members are snatched within
the first five minutes of the film) that (the nonetheless enjoyable)
The Faculty rarely has a chance to breathe. Relationships are pared
down to their essentials; oftentimes, two characters are conversing
(and snooping together) who were not friends a scene before. Marybeth
gravitates to Stokeley immediately-why? Unlike The Breakfast Club (or
any of the Body Snatchers films, for that matter), there is little
reason all these characters would unite. Also, as in most movies of
this type, it seems a dartboard was used to select who will become an
alien and who won't. (Aside, some entries for Roger Ebert's Movie
Glossary: when testing a group of people to see which person is
harbouring a secret alien identity, the last one tested will turn out
to be the monster; in an attempt to body snatch the male protagonist,
a female villain will appear totally nude before him and invite him
closer.)</P>
<P>There is mild subtext to Williamson's screenplay (which was polished
off by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel)-The Faculty at time plays like
an effects-laden "Just Say No!" commercial. Which is a great message, 
except that drugs defeat these aliens-perhaps Rodriguez and co. are
commenting on the merits of detox? The beauty of all three Body
Snatchers movies is how emblematic of their respective periods they
are (1956: McCarthyism; 1978: the Me Generation; 1993: the military
state); in 1999, there is more to say about the threat of widespread
mind control than what's laid out here. Today's teenagers and
twentysomething folks (myself included) have been spoonfed so much pop
culture-we're all talking like the characters on "Friends"-that I
doubt they'd notice if our teachers and parents lost their identities,
too.</P>
