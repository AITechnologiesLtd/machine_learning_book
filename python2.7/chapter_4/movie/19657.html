based on the novel "Ils Partiront Dans L'Ivresse" by Lucie Aubrac
written and directed by Claude Berri</P>
<P>At the beginning of "Lucie Aubrac", there is a disclaimer explaining
that this film is based on a true story, but certain dramatic
liberties have been taken. One of the film's problems is that not
enough dramatic liberties were taken, and we're left with a competent
historical drama-romance without much to it. Daniel Auteuil plays
Raymond, a member of the French Resistance in 1943. Recently married
to Lucie(Carole Bouquet), he gets arrested while at a secret
meeting. He is then sentenced to death, and it is up to his
headstrong, confident wife to rescue him.  Their love story is
charming, but not gripping. What is really fascinating is how strong
Lucie is; becoming a member of the Resistance and leading the troop to
save her husband's life. However, while the historical aspects of the
film are slightly interesting, there is so little character
development that you'll be bugging yourself to find out which name
belongs to which face. It doesn't help that the characters change
their names every few days. Writer/director Claude Berri has
undoubtebly used a lot of skill in putting this film together, but the
only ones who will really enjoy it are either foreign history buffs or
people who like a sentimental, slow-moving romance. Regardless of the
film's flaws, Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil are excellent. With a
little more drama and emotion, "Lucie Aubrac" would be a fine film.</P>
