COMPANY MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Psst.  If you can keep it a secret, I can now reveal some of what really 
happened just before the infamous Bay of Pigs.  I found out the inside 
story at COMPANY MAN, an over-the-top comedy that is so intentionally 
"bad," it's hilarious.  Think of it as the movie that BATTLEFIELD EARTH 
should have been.  Or, perhaps more aptly, think of it as a history 
lesson in the deliciously wacky AIRPLANE! style.  </P>
<P>Whatever it is, the movie, jointly written and directed by Douglas 
McGrath (EMMA) and Peter Askin, will have you laughing loudly and often.  
More sophisticated viewers will undoubtedly engage in a bit of 
revisionist history afterwards as some critics did at our screening, 
claiming that it was actually a terrible movie and that their laughs 
were merely those of derision.  If a comedy rates high on my 
laugh-o-meter, that's enough for me.  I don't care what devious means it 
employees to produce the guffaws.</P>
<P>As the story opens in 1962, the worlds most pedantic grammarian, Allen 
Quimp (McGrath), is testifying behind closed doors to a select 
congressional committee led by an incredulous senator (Jeffrey Jones 
from FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF).  Congress wants to know how an English 
and Driver's Ed teacher was sent to Cuba as an undercover agent for the 
CIA.  (Remember, you're sworn to secrecy.)</P>
<P>Although Allen is the author of the 854-page book modestly titled, "The 
Grammar Crisis in the English Speaking World," he needs something else 
to impress his relatives, which include a Nobel Prize winner and an 
astronaut, so he decides to be a "company man" at the CIA.  Since he 
"knows a little Russian" -- not the language but a small Russian man -- 
he figures that he is the right guy for the CIA.  The Russian turns out 
to be none other than world-renowned Russian ballerina Rudolph Petrov 
(Ryan Phillippe), who tells Allen, "I wish to defecate -- I mean 
defect."</P>
<P>Allen ends up being inducted into the CIA and shipped off to an obscure, 
third world island, Cuba, where his superiors figure that there is no 
chance that he could get into any trouble.  Once there, his obsession 
with perfect syntax and semantics drives fellow agent Fry (Denis Leary) 
nuts.  "There's no use in winning the war against Communism if we lose 
the war against the double negative," Allen admonishes Fry.  About to go 
stark raving mad, Fry tells him, "I've only said one sentence since you 
arrived, and you've been correcting it ever since."</P>
<P>Indicative of the wild level of the comedy is the casting of Woody Allen 
as the CIA station chief.  The producers managed to find a cryogenically 
frozen Woody from his wonderfully crazy, early comedies like BANANAS and 
defrost him.  No signs of the angst-filled later Woody are present.  </P>
<P>Also along for the ride is Sigourney Weaver, showing off the comedic 
talent that she displayed as the computer operator in GALAXY QUEST.  
This time she plays Daisy Quimp, the agent's wife, who is planning on 
getting rich by writing a book about their time in the CIA.  When Fidel 
Castro (Anthony LaPaglia) starts his revolution against General Batista 
(Alan Cumming), she wants her husband to overthrow the revolution in 
"the most readable way possible."  The superlative cast for COMPANY MAN 
never seems to stop.  I half expected Tom Cruise to pop by the set for a 
cameo.  Everybody else seems to have dropped by.</P>
<P>The press kit details some of the actual failed attempts by the CIA 
against Castro.  The writers use variations on them in the script.  My 
personal favorite involves a scheme in the movie to spike Castro's 
shampoo in order to "defoliate his face."  Nothing like a defoliated 
face to demoralize a revolutionary.</P>
<P>COMPANY MAN runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for brief sexual humor 
and drug content, but it is so mild that it's basically PG.  With the 
exception of one ribald scene during the ending credits, the film would 
be acceptable for almost all kids, but kids probably need to be 11 or 12 
to be able to appreciate the film's humor.</P>
