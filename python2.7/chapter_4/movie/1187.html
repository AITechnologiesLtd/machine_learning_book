<PRE>                                  CAPE FEAR
                       A film review by Erica Quirein
                        Copyright 1991 Erica Quirein</PRE>
<P>     I finally saw it, CAPE FEAR, what I believe to be one of the best
thrillers for a long time.  Granted my expectations were high, but the
movie *was* everything it was made out to be.  I do not claim to be an
expert movie critic, but from the eyes of an ordinary person, it seemed
pretty damn good!  The key to enjoy the movie is to go see it with
intentions to enjoy it, not critique it.  Keeping this in mind, the
movie is a "four-star," satisfaction guaranteed!</P>
<P>     The movie's cast all gave remarkable performances.  It stars Robert
DeNiro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, and Juliette Lewis.  Once again
DeNiro gave his usual outstanding performance.  He portrays his
character flawlessly, and believably.  Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange
have been in the background for a while, but they appear to be back,
better than ever!  Newcomer Juliete Lewis seemed very real in her role
and shows great promise to being a major star in the future.  The whole
cast was great!</P>
<P>     I will not venture into describing the plot.  Do keep in mind that
the plot was unusual, and be in store for a psychological roller
coaster.  The movie is a thriller that is easily enjoyed.  It is
directed flawlessly.  The movie will be much more satisfying if you just
watch it and don't try to evaluate each and every detail.  Have fun for
a change and give the analizing part of you brain a well deserved rest.</P>
<P>     The movie is a good one..................................ENJOY!
...Friendly tips from someone just like you.............Erica Quirein</P>
