<PRE>MEMENTO
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        I went into "Memento" knowing only three things about it: 1. it's about a
guy (played by Guy Pearce) who suffers from short-term memory loss; 2. it
co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both from "The Matrix"); and
3. it's received some pretty good press.  But that's all I knew.  In many
ways this is already too much information since the less you know about the
film going in the more likely you are to enjoy it.  For reasons that are
hard to explain, I had an innate sense that this film was going to be
good--very good, in fact--so I avoided reading anything about it
beforehand.  That proved to my advantage.  For you to be at a similar
advantage, stop reading this review now, go and see the film (and don't
talk to *anyone* who's seen it before you do), then come back and finish
reading from where you left off. </P>
<P>        "Memento," a crisp, stylish film noir that plays havoc with the senses (if
anything it's more a physiological than a psychological thriller), is
written and directed by Christopher Nolan (this is only his second
feature).  Its storyline concerns an insurance investigator, Leonard Shelby
(Pearce), who suffers from chronic loss of memory.  He cannot remember much
of anything, cannot create new memories, cannot remember someone he was
introduced to moments before--he has to rely on prolific note-taking, body
tattoos, and
Polaroids to keep track of who he is, and what he's doing.  What he's doing
is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Again, it's
unfortunate knowing that particular piece of information, for example,
beforehand since the way this plot detail is revealed in the film is
extremely powerful. </P>
<P>        So Nolan centers his intelligent, fine-looking film around this man with a
mission.  Leonard's investigation itself is complex and intricate.  Then we
have his condition, which adds to the complexity and intricacy of the
narrative.  These two elements make the film extremely engaging, but Nolan
doesn't stop there.  Perhaps the most intriguing component of the film is
the way in which it's put together.  Events happen not chronologically, but
backwards in time.  Nolan's film isn't the first to do this, of course.
"Betrayal" (from 1983) documents, from a cuckolded husband's point of view,
an extramarital affair in reverse chronological order.  And Quentin
Tarantino's masterful "Pulp Fiction" plays around with continuity like no
other contemporary piece of filmmaking.  In "Memento," this rarely
attempted cinematic technique seems less like a plot device and more an
integral part of the film's framework, working superbly in context given
the medical condition of its lead--Leonard is always backtracking, checking
his notes, trying to remember things; it's the perfect combination of
substance *and* style. </P>
<P>        In that regard, "Memento" excels on every imaginable level.  The writing
is sophisticated--clever one minute, funny the next, gut-wrenching
thereafter; the acting (by Moss, Pantoliano, and above all Pearce) is
sublime; and the direction is brave and intellectually stimulating. </P>
<P>        If you've heard *anything* about this film you've probably heard how good
it is and of that you can be assured.  "Memento" is quite simply the best
film of the year.  It's the smartest noir thriller since "The Last
Seduction," the most brilliantly structured film since "Timecode," and the
most mesmerizing mystery story I can remember seeing in a long, long time.</P>
