<PRE>                        DR. T AND THE WOMEN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Robert Altman looks at the
          superficial lives of the wealthy and frequently
          not too bright in Dallas upper class.  His
          points are less subtle and just a bit more
          vulgar than usual.  The film takes a long time
          to make its point, which turns out to be
          disappointingly trite.  This is a film that at
          least superficially seems to verge on misogyny
          but perhaps is really anti-rich.  Rating: 4 (0
          to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     DR. T AND THE WOMEN is about a fabulously handsome and
successful gynecologist living and working in the Dallas area.  Dr.
Sullivan Travis, (played by Richard Gere) lives the good life.  He
has a beautiful wife Karen (Farrah Fawcett) and two nice children.
In his practice he treats many attractive women, yet he remains
totally faithful to his wife and family.  In typical Altman fashion
we follow several strands of plot in the lives of T's family, his
patients, and T's relationship with an intriguing woman golf
professional at T's country club.  Problems start to creep into T's
world as Karen Travis childishly takes off her clothes and takes a
swim in the fountain in from of a Godiva chocolate shop in an
upscale mall.  Her doctor diagnoses her case as something called a
Hestia Complex, a mental disease of the wealthy.  Meanwhile as one
daughter plans her upcoming wedding, another seems intent on
disrupting the wedding plans.  And several other plot strands work
themselves out.</P>
<P>     Director Robert Altman is a surprisingly erratic filmmaker even
after all these years and after having made several classics.  There
is a great deal of similarity in all his films--each will have a
large number of familiar actors and a lot of plot strands that all
make a sort of mosaic of life in some part of the country.  Yet each
film will be trying to make some point and the quality of the film
tends to hang on that point and sort of people he is portraying.
Last year this gave us the charming COOKIE'S FORTUNE.  Considerably
less charming and in the final analysis more than a little fatuous
is this film.  What we get is a not very flattering portrait of the
nouveau riche, with women going through women's pursuits of spending
large sums of money, planning weddings, and turning visits to the
gynecologist into one more popular form of entertainment.  It is
hard to imagine women so excited about getting an intimate
examination that they cluster like pigeons turning the doctor's
office into real chaos just for the excitement of being examined.
Somehow even with someone with Richard Gere's looks doing the
examining, this really stretches the imagination.  Meanwhile the
receptionist snorts like a horse and patients plan accidents for
other patients.  While the women are doing this, the guys are doing
really masculine and only marginally more believable pursuits like
shooting skeets (well, golf balls) and going duck hunting.</P>
<P>     Altman has done more interesting work. This film only really
engages the viewer if one is fascinated with this sector of society.
The film generally hovers no further than arm's length from being
sexually titillating.  We see locker room scenes, and gynecological
examinations.  People take off their clothing out behind desks.  We
see Farrah Fawcett nude in a fountain once it is clear she is not
mentally competent.  Altman can do better things than tantalize the
audience.  Most of these patients are treated in a superficial and
not very sympathetic manner.  Many we never see outside the chaos of
the waiting room.  Like MAGNOLIA the story builds to a sort of a
strange climax, though what happens here is much less likely than
what happens in MAGNOLIA.  This is all in service to making a point
that has been made many times before in film.  Altman is no more
intelligent about making that point in this film.  Nor do his
characters have the interest value they had in COOKIE'S FORTUNE.  If
one neither enjoys the theme nor the characters, there is not much
left.</P>
<P>     Altman probably cannot make a film that is totally bad.  His
famous relaxed style of shooting a film attracts too many good
people.  But with a really mediocre script he can waste talent on a
film worth only a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
