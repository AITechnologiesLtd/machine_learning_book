<PRE>                          ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     Disney has served up one of each of the things it does best for
this summer's younger movie fans and the grownups who love to accompany
them.  ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD is an unashamed lunge for your
heartstrings, while THE LION KING is an invitation to watch the
extraordinary marriage of computer graphics with human animation.</P>
<P>     ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD bounces itself off the sure-fire subjects
of redemption, parentless children and snatching victory from the ashes
of defeat.  Roger, a young baseball fan, concocts the dream that his
dad will come home to him if his California Angels can win the
pennant.  Since the Angels are cellar-bound and dad is a dark and
dreary loser who rides his motorcycle with a cigarette dangling from
his lip, the possibility of either dream coming true is close to
zilch.</P>
<P>     But Roger prays, and the real angels hear him.  Flying in
throughout the season at critical moments, they steam a pitch, abort a
homer and supply the general sizzle needed to bring the moribund team
to life.  Coach George Knox (Danny Glover) is nasty in the early
scenes--all the better for his later redemption.</P>
<P>     Roger and his very cute sidekick run their operation from the home
of their warmly wise foster mother, Maggie (Brenda Fricker).  Watch for
another standout performance by Fricker, who manages to seem very real
in the midst of all this emotional manipulation.  The movie is massive,
sentimental overkill, but it's also a no-lose deal for everyone between
three and ten as well for big people who want to believe that an angel
is waiting at their shoulders to offer an assist in a tough situation.</P>
