Review: Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas</PRE>
<P>Starring: Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro</P>
<PRE>Directed by Terry Gilliam</PRE>
<PRE>Approx running time: 120 min.</PRE>
<P>Terry Gilliam is a very strange fellow. But why he thought Hunter
S. Thompson's book would make a good film is beyond me. It isn't as if
Gilliam and his team of talented artists didn't make a fine attepmt,
indeed they did. But Fear and Loathing is a two hour mind trip. And
like a trip it has no substance and no purpose.</P>
<P>What makes the film watchable is the performance of Johnny
Depp. Though some may wonder why he chose such a pointless story to
work with, it is clear that the character was a challenge to
re-create. (Apparently , he did a great amount of research on
Thompson.) Benicio Del Toro gives a fantastic performance as well,
perhaps the best of his career to date. But Del Toro's character is as
unappealing as Depp's is strangely compelling.</P>
<P>Depp plays the part with a certain goofiness that never crosses the
line into menace or threat. Del Toro plays a slob of a scary scumbag
that never approaches goofiness or appeal. The two have a great deal
of screentime together, sharing acid and ether trips in various Las
Vegas locations. But there is never really a development of comraderie
between them. Seeing as the film lacks a central point, it seems that
the least Gilliam and co-screenwriters Todd Dunes and Alex Cox could
give us a good pair of buddies to carry the film. But sadly, we are
left only with Depp's funky facial expressions and whacky walks to
amuse us.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp, who is rapidly proving why he is one of the most gifted
actors of his generation, also creates a fantastic vocal sound for his
character, a kind of cross between Elvis Presley and Robert
Mitchum. That voice, combined with the cigarette holder which dangles
from his lip in every single shot, helped form an otherwise bland
character into something watchable and slightly entertaing.</P>
<P>Fear and Loathing begins with numerous trips that required digital
effects. Carpet paterns coming to life, bats flocking toward Depp's
eye, and faces being pulled and distorted in all directions. It is
rather a letdown, then, when the effects suddenly stop and all of the
following acid trips are portrayed only in the reactions the actors
have to them. One is an incredibly vivid and rather annoying scene in
which Depp trys to calm Del Toro who is sitting in murky bath wather
with grapefruit peels floating around him.</P>
<P>Indeed, the visuals in Fear and Loathing are unique and often cool to
look at, but if Depp's fine performance can't save this film, then
neither can they. Nor does the fine camera work by Nicola Pecorini do
enough to save it.</P>
<P>Gilliam is certainly better than this. Fear and Loathing suffered from
a lack of point, drive and in some spots, ambition. Other than telling
you that Depp is a writer on an assignment and he goes to Vegas with
his junkie attorney, I can't tell you what I really watched for two
hours. That's about as far into plot synopsis as I can get. But one
thing I can tell you...Terry Gilliam is a very strange fellow.</P>
