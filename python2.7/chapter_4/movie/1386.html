<PRE>                              ONE FALSE MOVE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     ONE FALSE MOVE is a film directed by Carl Franklin, from a script
by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson.  It stars Cynda Williams, Bill
Paxton, Michael Beach, and Bill Bob Thornton.  Rated R, for violence,
strong language.</P>
<P>     ONE FALSE MOVE is a quirky and surprising thriller.  It begins with
a scene of horrifying brutality and violence.  One thinks that he or she
has seen this before and knows what is going to follow: vengeance, cops
and druggies, mayhem and high-speed car chases.  But even at the
beginning one knows he or she is in for something different, if just
because of the camerawork that makes one's skin creep.  And then a
sudden change of pace and place, with some comedy thrown in, and the
disorientation is complete.  This is not going to be a routine Hollywood
formula film.</P>
<P>     By the time the film comes to its conclusion, it has widened its
aims and taken charge of a surprisingly broad territory.  Racism,
justice, abuses of all sorts, prejudices, the gap between rural and
urban, all these are fresh as the last headline.  The story is sharp as
a crease, powerfully told, with plenty of twists and turns to keep
anyone off balance.</P>
<P>     The story, by the way, or at least the script, was co-written by
one of the actors, Billy Bob Thornton, who plays a white-trash coke head
who is barely under control at the best of times.  He and his co-writer
Tom Epperson provided a script full of taut writing, tight plotting,
full of energy and discipline.</P>
<P>     The other actors are equally up to the demands of the script as
Thornton.  Cynda William as Fantasia is the touch point, the pivot, of
the story.  It's her mysterious, ambiguous role in the story that
provides the most interest.  She is the worst of the worst, yet driven
by the tenderest of emotions.  She's elegant, beautiful, treacherous,
passive, possessed by more demons that would seem possible to pack into
her small frame.</P>
<P>     Michael Beach is the third member of this particular menage.  An
ex-con with a genius IQ, a passing resemblance to Malcom X, and a taste
for knifework.  He's cold and focused and very scary.</P>
<P>     The cops include Jim Metzler as Dud Cole and Earl Billings as John
McFeely, two LAPD officers who find they have to work with the hickish
Dale "Hurricane" Dixon, played by Bill Paxton.  This is more Paxton's
movie, more Dixon's story, than anyone else's, although the script tries
to fool you into dismissing him as a swaggering rube.  And he is due for
some come-uppances, some course corrections for his life.  At first he
appears irritating, foolish, headstrong, childishly self-involved,
mostly harmless even if thoughtlessly racist and casually abusive of his
powers.  His wife (Natalie Canerday) puts her quiet wisdom on display
when she sums him up with: "Dale doesn't know any better -- he watches
TV.  I read nonfiction."</P>
<P>     Paxton may play Hurricane a little too broadly at first, but in the
latter parts of the film his characterization takes on depth, dimension,
color, and complexity.</P>
<P>     A word of praise should also go to the musical score by Peter
Haycock and Derek Holt and to the photography of James L. Carter.</P>
<P>     Finally, let me say something briefly about the director, Carl
Franklin.  He has managed to give us a portrait of life on both sides of
the color line that is probably unique.  He finds the contact point
between human folly and inhuman crime.  He lets one of the characters
speak a line that rings loud since the LA riots: "Looking guilty is
being guilty for black people."  But he puts it in the mouth of Fantasia
after she has fully joined in her companions crimes.  He is a very
assured director, and I await with pleasure his next film.</P>
<PRE>     I high recommend ONE FALSE MOVE even at full price.</PRE>
