<PRE>                         THE DESIGNATED MOURNER
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Remember back in your college days when your English literature
professor would assign novels so dense with prose that it took five
readings to get through the paragraph-long sentences?  After many late
night sessions of reading and rereading the text, you were finally able
to decode the sentences and begin to glean the book's complex messages.</P>
<P>     THE DESIGNATED MOURNER is the film equivalent of that assignment. 
Since it was written by Wallace Shawn, who also wrote the famous and
successful MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, his latest film comes with impressive
credentials.  MY DINNER WITH ANDRE set the gold standard for film
talkfests with its imaginative and enlightening dinnertime conversation
between two friends, Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory.</P>
<P>     With perhaps three viewings, one might be able to decipher some of
THE DESIGNATED MOURNER's nuances.  With only one, understanding it, and
more importantly caring about it, becomes a challenge.  Whether the
material is worth the effort is problematic.  Like the college
assignment, one must decide whether its mastery has sufficient payoff.</P>
<P>     The film opens with three talking heads, whose fidgety bodies rest
most uncomfortably in straight back chairs.  Jack (Mike Nichols) and
Judy (Miranda Richardson) are a frequently warring married couple, and
Howard (David De Keyser) is Judy's revered father.  Although Judy is
married to Jack, the bond with her father is much stronger.</P>
<P>     Filmed by Oliver Stapleton in harsh lights and shadows, the
lighting has the same standoffish effect as the dialog, which is
univitingly cold.  Behind the chairs are blurry lights so that the
attention is drawn to the large heads that fill the screen.</P>
<P>     Nichols gets most of the lines so the film's success rests mostly
on his shoulders.  In short, he is no Spalding Gray.  Whereas Spalding
Gray (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA, MONSTER IN A BOX, and GRAY'S ANATOMY) can
mesmerize an audience with his monologues, Nichols just talks fast. 
Gray has a compelling storytelling ability that Nichols lacks.</P>
<P>     Although snippets of the dialog have power, most serve only to
obscure and befuddle.  ("The past and the future don't actually exist. 
I mean where are they?")  Jack tells us, "Stories are as necessary as
food."  Well, if that is so, then this movie will leave many starving.</P>
<P>     The film, based on a play by Wallace Shawn, does have a story or at
least the brief sketches of one.  However, the story is little more than
a plot device to let Jack babble along at a breakneck pace.  Whereas
Gray talks to us, Jack ramblings seem more directed to himself.</P>
<P>     Howard, the father, is an intellectual who switched in his 20s from
prose to poetry.  This helped protect him from the unnamed totalitarian
government under which they live, government officials being unable to
realize that his poetry might be subversive.</P>
<P>     A recurring subtheme revolves around the trials and tribulations of
the male sexual organ, with its name used frequently for shock effect.</P>
<P>     "I guess, I've always been a low-brow at heart," reflects Jack in
his big conclusion scene.  He never did fit in with Judy, Howard, and
their literati friends.  There is a good chance that you may feel
similarly left out.</P>
<P>     THE DESIGNATED MOURNER runs 1:35, which might seems short but it
was long enough to put one of the four critics in our private screening
to sleep.  He snored through some of it, but missed little -- it's that
sort of a movie.  I cannot recommend this inaccessible film, but I do
give it ** for its risk taking and a valiant effort.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
