<PRE>                             CIAO, PROFESSORE!
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     What a delightful, heart-warming, film!   What a dedicated teacher
and what a bunch of irresistible third grade rascals he inherits as his
students ... just as soon as he can round them up from their busy work
schedules.</P>
<P>     Professore Spetelli (Paulo Villaggio) is the maestro who finds
himself in a suburb of Naples in southern Italy.  He had asked to be
assigned to the town of Corsano but through a computer error he is
appointed to teach at Corzano where the Mafia rules, where his students
are truants who work in the barber shop, the gas station, engage in the
black market and are priming themselves to graduate to the Mafia.
Maestro Spetelli involves himself with the students and, eventually,
they with him in this hilarious yet poignant film.</P>
<P>     Villaggio is wonderful; the kindness shines from his face.   The
young boys and girls are uninhibited in their language and their acting
is astonishingly  superb.  Put that all together, hand the reins over
to a great director, and you come up with perhaps the best film so far
this year.</P>
<P>Directed beautifully by Lina Wertmuller.</P>
<PRE>In Italian with English subtitles.</PRE>
