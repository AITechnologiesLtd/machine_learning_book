                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>Directed by Roger Donaldson
Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker
'Sil' and Ghost Train Design by H.R. Giger
U.S.A., 1995</P>
<P>     Contrary to what you may have heard on the net and elsewhere, the
first half of SPECIES is actually a charming little B-movie. It's not
so much that the film's troubles begin halfway through, but that it
makes a string of bad decisions that forfeit both our goodwill and our
willing suspension of disbelief. Still, if it wasn't MGM's flagship
release for the summer movie season -- say, if Roger Corman had
produced a low-budget version of the same script for his movie series
on Showtime -- I can't imagine it would have taken near the critical
drubbing it seems to have garnered.</P>
<P>     The premise is delicious, if a little incredible: aliens have
responded to our search for extraterrestrial life by solicitously
beaming back a DNA code. Humans being what we are, we decide to
experiment with the stuff, fabricating a syringeful of the otherworldly
stuff and then injecting it into a human ovum and growing a small army
of human/alien crossbreeds. Silly us. A few die, others are frozen for
future study, and one darling little girl, known as Sil, is kept in an
isolation chamber for study (she has grown to an apparent 12 years old
over the course of a few months). This gives her a lot of sublimated
anger, and when the team of scientists led by Ben Kingsley finally
decides to gas the child, she breaks through the chamber's glass and
escapes.  And since this little kid soon grows to womanly proportions
and sets out to fulfill her biological imperative to breed (conceivable
killing off the human race as she makes tiny monsters), Kingsley sets
out after her.</P>
<P>     The early scenes seem to cement our identification with Sil
(Michelle Williams). Her wide eyes establish her as the loneliest
little girl on the planet, and she projects a palpable sense of
betrayal when the cyanide gas is turned on and Kingsley mouths down at
her: "I'm sorry." Even when she kills a transient, she seems blameless,
like a wild animal escaped from captivity.  Before she grows a cocoon
and morphs into an adult, we watch her months-old mind cope with
adolescence. The artist H.R.  Giger, who designed the Aliens in the
original Alien, worked on Sil, too.  The "Ghost Train" that chases Sil
in her dreams is all his creation (funded, in fact, by the artist's own
money), and symbolizes menstruation, which is actually a mild
foreshadowing of the transformation to come.  Along with the grisly
cocooning sequence, these are the only potentially disturbing scenes in
the film.</P>
<P>     Just a little later, Sil is full-grown and played by model
Natasha Henstridge, who is undeniably gorgeous and makes the whole
movie look just a little too much like a cosmetics commercial.  Her
exploits from then on are episodic (in much the same way as producer
Frank Mancuso Jr's films in the seminal Friday the 13th series), as she
seduces and dispatches men in a guileless search for one suitable for
breeding. That's the fun part.  Unfortunately, it's intercut with the
comparably tedious exploits of Kingsley's posse.  Forest Whitaker is an
empath who has the fortuitous skill of sharing other people's feelings
over videotape.  Michael Madsen gets the requisite Michael Madsen role.
And so on, with Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger (both perfectly
adequate in undemanding roles) rounding out the team.</P>
<P>     You'd think that one night in L.A. would be long enough for a
sex object of Henstridge's caliber to try mating with about a dozen
men, but the script is too clunky and methodical to let her really have
at it (though she does go shirtless in at least four, maybe five
scenes). A little more development of Sil's character would have gone a
long way toward adding a little bit of weight to the same situations,
since the audience is predisposed to identify with her early on (she's
half human, after all). The less said about the dialogue, the better, I
suppose, though these actors struggle mightily with it. The special
effects, which consist mainly of Sil's varying transformations into
alien form, range from the wickedly effective (early on) to the ho-hum
(the last 20 minutes or so, when less really would have been more). And
the direction is by Roger Donaldson, a competent thriller maker (NO WAY
OUT, THE GETAWAY) who either lacked the clout or was uninterested in
making a more substantial horror story from this material.</P>
<P>     I saw SPECIES at the end of a week which also included
screenings of BELLE DE JOUR, THE LAST SEDUCTION, and the original
ALIEN. I think ALIEN is the best of that lot, and it's a good example
of the kind of movie SPECIES billed itself as (Giger worked on both).
But the thing about all these films is that they are meditations on the
female by male filmmakers, and all of them dwell conspicuously on the
bizarre: BELLE DE JOUR's casual masochism, THE LAST SEDUCTION's
trenchant moneylust, and ALIEN's horrified look at the reproductive
system.  SPECIES exhibits a similar morbid fascination with issues of
pregnancy and the female body.  It's fitting that Henstridge's body is
on display during much of the movie, since her body, with its capacity
to morph and transform, is the really terrifying object that the film
revolves around.</P>
