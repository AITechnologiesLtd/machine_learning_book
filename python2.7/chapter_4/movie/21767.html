<PRE>XIAO WU (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>        3 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Wang Hongwei, Hao Hongjian, Zuo Baitao;
        Written & Directed by Jia Zhangke;
        Cinematography by Yu Lik-wai</PRE>
<P>        One becomes accustomed to seeing the world on screen distorted by
the conventions of cinematic "realism," so it is rather a shock to see a
movie which resembles life as it might actually be lived.  XIAO WU is a
low-budget Chinese film which opens a window onto small-town China.  It
gives us a view unobstructed by the things which distance most movies from
actuality: no narrative structure, no famous actors, no technical polish.
It is not a documentary, but it might as well be.</P>
<P>        It is set in Fenyang, a dusty provincial town not likely to be
found in any tourist brochures.  Fenyang is director Jia Zhangke's
hometown, and his actors are non-professionals.  Town and people are
presented with a spare, unglamourous style which emphasizes above all what
this place is like, seemingly without exaggeration and certainly without
romanticization.  Xiao Wu is a pickpocket living a rather aimless existence
in the town.  The movie follows him through the days and nights of his
life.</P>
<P>        Xiao Wu's former partner in crime is now a respectable
businessman--which is to say, he sells cigarettes.  He is getting married.
Xiao Wu, an embarrassing reminder of the businessman's past, is not invited
to the wedding.  Sometime in their past, Xiao Wu promised a gift to his
former friend.  To honour his promise, he shows up before the wedding
reception and offers his gift.  The two men sit down in a back room and
have an awkward conversation, seen as one long unbroken take.  It is one of
the film's best scenes, capturing the two men's respective characters with
precision, suggesting the weight of the emotional history between them
without verbalizing it.</P>
<P>        But the film does not stitch scenes like this into a larger design.
We witness a succession of incidents in Xiao Wu's life, related only by
the fact that they all happen to the same man and they all serve the film's
political agenda (like most Chinese movies seen in the West these days, it
is a harsh critique of communism).  Xiao Wu goes to a brothel and befriends
a prostitute.  He has dinner with his family.  He falls under the suspicion
of the local chief of police after some ID cards are stolen.  There is no
sense of imposed narrative, no sense that the film is moving toward
closure.  Instead, there are long unbroken takes which ignore the demands
of drama.</P>
<P>        A representative sequence: Xiao Wu and the prostitute he is sort of
dating sit together in bed.  They talk.  They are silent.  They smoke.  The
smoke drifts in the air.  Background sounds from the street emphasise the
silence in the room.  She sings.  They smoke some more.  Smoke drifts.  She
asks Xiao Wu to sing.  He demurs, embarrassed.  The camera never moves.</P>
<P>        The movie as a whole is similar in approach: it lets things happen,
not forcing them in any particular direction.  Xiao Wu purchases a pager.
His girlfriend has his number.  One day, he goes to the apartment she
shares with some other prostitutes and discovers that she has gone away
with some men from the city.  He waits for her to page him.  Each time his
pager goes off, we wait for it to be her, expecting a resolution to their
relationship.  But she never pages him.  That's not the way this movie
works.</P>
<P>        The thrust of the film, instead, is simply to _see_ Xiao Wu.  He is
under our scrutiny throughout the film, which strips away the clutter and
distraction of plot and laboured symbolism and postcard photography, and is
instead content to observe.  This impulse toward exposure becomes literal
at one point, when Xiao Wu is alone in a public bathhouse.  We see him
fully naked.  He sings--something he has refused to do in public, in front
of his girlfriend.  It is here that XIAO WU crystallizes into the
epiphanous vision of one man's private life that it strives to be.</P>
<P>        It is easy to become impatient with the film's methods, but what it
accomplishes, in the end, is rare.  We are given some obscure understanding
of Xiao Wu's existence, freed of moralizing or generalizations.  He is not
a victim or a hero or an everyman.  He is himself.  That is XIAO WU's
triumph: it shows a man who is no more than what he is.  It shows us what
it is that makes him, like all of us, unique.</P>
