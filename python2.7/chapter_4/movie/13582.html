<PRE>The Last Picture Show</PRE>
<PRE>Peter Bogdanovich   1971   US  Columbia   BW   118m.</PRE>
<P>Anarene, Texas, population 1131, is a no-account, dying township near
Wichita Falls. The truck drivers don't slow down as they pass through
it. A few old-timers live there, a few well-off employees of an oil
company, a few wayward kids
who've left home and gone into lodgings to get away from their folks, a
few schoolteachers and their families, a young boy with a mental
handicap  -  in short, the same kind of people who live everywhere else.
This is Hicksville, Texas, and the
year is 1951. It is solidly located in time and space, so real that we
can almost smell it, feel the chill wind that sandblasts the buildings
as it rips across the flat featureless West Texas plains, but the time
and place don't matter because what the 
lm deals with applies to all times and to all places.</P>
<P>Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) is Everyman. He wants to be a good
person, to be able to like himself, but he is weak, corruptible, easily
deflected onto what he knows is the lower path. When we first meet him
he has an enormous amount
still to learn. He has to learn that actions have consequences, that
other people have feelings and that when you trample on them they (and
ultimately you) get hurt, that relationships create expectations and
responsibilities, that the demands of
kindness outweigh those of immediate sexual gratification: in short,
what it is to be human. As the film unfolds, we see him grow into a
decent, considerate human being despite all the forces pulling him in
other directions. The triumph of the
film's ending is that he doesn't run away from the things that he has
done, he turns the pick-up truck around and goes back to face Ruth
(Cloris Leachman), and more importantly himself. The heart-rending,
inarticulate confrontation between
Sonny and Ruth that ends the film is one of the all-time high-points of
American cinema. This is how a film that seems at times unrelentingly
downbeat and pessimistic can actually uplift and send you from the
theatre believing that better is
possible of human beings, that all is not hopelessness.</P>
<P>This is a shocking film: not because of nudity, or anything to do with
sexuality or violence, but because of honesty. Instead of glossing-over
those parts of all our lives that we would prefer to deny and/or forget,
"The Last Picture Show" selects
them out as its subject matter and places them before us without
compromise, without moralising, without means of escape.</P>
<P>Some commentators have been inclined to blame the town itself and the
crushing boredom of existence there for the moral shortcomings of its
citizens, to over-stress the importance of a particular way of life and
a particular moment in the
history of the United States, as if people would behave better if there
was more to do, more to aspire to, a greater variety of potential
partners. Personally I think that this misses the point. The details of
people's "lives of quiet desperation"
would of course be different in another situatiuon, but whether in
Anarene or Beverley Hills, Barcelona or Bangkok people have much the
same choices to make as to how they are going to treat one another, much
the same needs and wants and
much the same opportunities to behave decently and achieve self-respect
or to behave wretchedly and forfeit it. The town simply supplies a stage
for the unfolding of completely universal aspects of human behaviour. It
is the universality of
the material that gives it its bite, that makes it at times downright
uncomfortable. Which one of us has not, at some time or another, acted
shamefully and tried to cover it up afterwards? Which of us has not
experienced the mind-numbing
clumsiness and embarrassment of early sexual encounters and lied about
them?</P>
<P>It would be time-consuming to summarise all of the plots and sub-plots
of "The Last Picture Show" and really they are not crucial to the film:
the two central aspects are character and atmosphere.</P>
<P>We are introduced to Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), the grizzled old cowboy
who has settled down in Anarene and lives a lot in his own romantic
version of the past, while providing a father-figure and role-model for
some of the town's rootless
teenagers; Ruth Popper, the neglected and near-suicidal wife of the High
School football coach, who longs for some kind of affection and
adventure in her empty life before she grows too old to enjoy it; Jacey
Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) the
pretty, self-centred, manipulative and spiteful teenager who comes from
a family where this is the norm; Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) the
aspiring High School football hero desperate to prove his manhood, full
of pent-up violence and
resentment which eventually find an outlet in signing-up to fight in
Korea; and many, many more, each one of them a fully-rounded, believable
human being without an ounce of carricature or exaggeration to mar their
plausibility. Just look at
the way the characters interact asnd spark off one another. Look at the
relationship between Jasey and her mother, or between Sonny and his
first lacklustre girlfriend Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart). Peter
Bogdanovich must have made a pact
with the Devil to extract performances of this level from all (yes,
absolutely all) of his cast.</P>
<P>As well as the human actors and actresses the town itself is a major
player in the drama. Bleak, windswept, tatty and dying it seems to stand
for the emotional void in the characters' lives, and also for the end of
an age of youth and innocence
that has been outgrown, both in the individual lives of the protagonists
and in America itself. The Royal Cinema presents flickering escapist
fantasies, like "Father of the Bride" (the 1950 version) based on a
sentimental and tacky representation
of family life that bears no resemblance to anything in the real
experience of the people watching it; and "Red River", a 1948 Howard
Hawks cowboy movie in which John Wayne stands in for Sam the Lion in his
particular fantasy of what Texas
used to be. It is all myth and fairytale, it has nothing to do with what
life is really like, and in the end it too is taken away  -  the cinema
closes down: the time has come to stand on one's own two feet, the
picture show is over.</P>
<P>If it is ever for a moment suggested that film is an inferior art-form
to the novel or the play, "The Last Picture Show" provides all the
counter-argument that one could possibly require.</P>
<P>I would recommend that you see this film first when you are about
seventeen years old, again at about twenty-five, and then at intervals
of about a decade for the rest of your life. On each occasion you will
see a different film, an even better one
than you saw the time before.</P>
