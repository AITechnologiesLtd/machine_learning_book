<P>Plot: Angels hover invisibly over LA, listening in on people's thoughts. 
One angel, Seth, aches to touch and feel the things that ordinary people 
do. He is drawn to Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon whose life starts 
falling apart after a patient she cared about died, and appears to her, 
offering comfort and solace. Gradually the two fall in love and Seth 
faces the choice of whether or not to to elect to fall from being an 
angel and become an ordinary mortal so he can be with her.</P>
<P>Wim Wenders' `Wings of Desire' (1987) was one of the great fantasy films 
of the 1980s. It lacked anything appreciable in the way of trite moral 
epiphanies like any traditional Hollywood angel fantasy, but instead 
used angels as an extraordinary and beautiful poetic meditation on the 
human condition. Now of course comes `City of Angels', the Hollywood 
remake of `Wings of Desire', which is sadly exactly the banalizing that 
one would expect when a European arthouse film having been passed 
through the studio grinder. In `Wings' the romance was one of, but not 
necessarily the primary, subplot, but in `City' it is propelled to the 
forefront and told in the most shameless Hollywood romantic sentiments 
conceivable. At which, one must admit, it conducts itself passably. 
There are some passages which come with a tenderly written feeling - 
most especially the opening scene where Cage takes the soul of a child 
from a hospital operating theatre ("Will Mummy understand ?" "She 
will"). It is just that when you compare it to `Wings' it cannot help 
but seem an inferior effort. Director Silberling ably imitates Wenders' 
camera moves serenely circling through the air as though operated by 
angels. And there are even moments when the film seems to play with the 
double meaninged title and the visual iconography that one might 
associate with it in a very Wenders-esque way - angels casually holding 
conversations atop downtown street signs or sitting atop the Hollywood 
sign. And indeed it even takes the ending to further places than `Wings' 
ever went to by opting for a tragic ending to the romance to add the 
comment that the joy of life entails pain as well (a corollary that 
Wenders left it to his sequel `Faraway! So Close' before getting around 
to making). </P>
<P>But where Wenders achieved a kind of numinously divine poetry about the 
aching fragility and beauty of the human condition, `City' is left 
straining at romantic cliche. Silberling just cannot help but overplay 
his hand. One of the most haunting images in `Wings' was one beautiful 
tracking shot showing angels invisibly sitting amongst the people in a 
library. Silberling repeats it in `City' but overplays it to the point 
of absurdity - it becomes a focal location in the story and gets tricked 
out with absurdly heavy-handed shots like having all the angels 
sinisterly looking down from the balconies. And where the film really 
loses it altogether is in the disastrous casting. Nicolas Cage is 
appallingly miscast as an angel - where he should radiate a beatific 
divine grace and drift through listening to human thoughts with a 
boundless empathy, Cage comes across as rather dopey. And most laughably 
when it comes to the film's celebration of the joy of life, his attempts 
at running about animated by the ecstasy of sensation make him look like 
a total lunatic. Equally Meg Ryan is completely miscast in the part of a 
heart surgeon. Ryan is a light comedy actress and is almost impossible 
to believe as a surgeon on the emotional brink. (And she is not exactly 
helped by poorly motivated script - it is hard to believe an experienced 
surgeon would just suddenly go to pieces for no well-defined reason 
after the medically inexplicable death of a child she never knew). 
Between this absurd box-office oriented miscasting and Silberling's 
heavy-handed mishandling of the story, the serene, almost divine poetry 
of Wenders's original topples into risibility.</P>
