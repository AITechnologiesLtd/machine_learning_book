<P>     Movie people love making movies about movie people -- they validate
film-making as the most fascinating of all pursuits, even as they allow
Tinseltown to tweak its own inflated image.  It's a wonderful mystery of
the film industry that so much self-absorption and self-loathing can
co-exist without some sort of matter/anti-matter explosion.  Too often,
though, the tweak doesn't take.  Steven Seagal playing himself in MY GIANT
was unconvincing as a pompous, difficult star playing a pompous, difficult
star; BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN was as brainless and misguided as the films it
intended to satirize.  For every THE PLAYER, there are half a dozen
attempts at insider humor too self-congratulatory to tap into what's truly
goofy about Hollywood.</P>
<P>     Steve Martin is one of the guys who gets it, and in BOWFINGER he
finds an unlikely partner in Eddie Murphy.  Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger,
a never-was producer convinced that he's finally found a project that will
launch him into the big time.  The science-fiction/action project needs
only one thing to guarantee studio support:  the participation of Kit
Ramsey (Murphy), action star extraordinaire.  Ramsey has no interest in
the project, but Bowfinger has a creative solution.  He plans to send his
cast and crew wherever Ramsey happens to be, throwing him into the film
without his knowledge.  Little does Bowfinger know that the strange things
happening around Kit are sending the already-edgy celebrity into a
full-fledged paranoia.</P>
<P>     Martin, who also wrote the script, has previously demonstrated his
fondness for skewering Los Angeles (L.A. STORY) and classic cinema (DEAD
MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID); he even played a soulless studio suit himself in
GRAND CANYON.  The key is that he knows how to do it with affection,
finding the absurdity in film culture and conventions while still
recognizing their magical appeal.  In a sense, BOWFINGER is a broad,
contemporary re-working of ED WOOD, the story of a guy so determined to
make his mark that he'll go to bizarre lengths to do it.  Martin the actor
lets go of his recent flustered Everyman persona to find a guy willing to
look ridiculous to be a player.  Martin the writer, meanwhile, takes broad
aim at every possible industry target -- producers with short attention
spans, action films, the casting couch, Scientology (thinly disguised as
an organization called Mindhead), even former girlfriend Anne Heche.
While some of the barbs are caustic, they all come back to a group of
people trying to make magic ... even if the magic is an alien adventure
called "Chubby Rain."</P>
<P>     The scattershot approach to Hollywood satire should have fallen flat,
and on occasion it does feel somewhat forced.  Director Frank Oz certainly
deserves some credit for his deft touch, but the real anchor of BOWFINGER
is Eddie Murphy.  Unlike Seagal, Murphy appears genuinely willing to poke
fun at his history as holy terror.  His Kit Ramsey is a borderline
psychotic, surrounded by yes-men who validate his demented conspiracy
theories and a Mindhead guru (Terrence Stamp) who gets rich off of them.
It's a wild, wired performance, complemented by his second role as Jiff,
the geeky Kit Ramsey look-alike Bowfinger hires as a stand-in.  Jiff not
only lets Murphy subtly satirize his fondness for playing multiple roles;
he provides a sympathetic face for an innocent's sense of wonder at the
world of the movies.  Murphy should always be this loose and entertaining.</P>
<P>     BOWFINGER isn't a perfect comedy, at times pushing its thin premise
farther than it can sustain.  Heather Graham's secretly Machiavellian
ingenue grows a bit tiresome, and the Mindhead gags often feel timid and
blunted.  When the set pieces work, however -- Jiff's terrified journey
across a freeway, or an attempt to spook Kit in a parking garage, or
gathering a "crew" at the Mexican border -- they're wonderfully funny
stuff.  It's also a movie about movies that doesn't get caught up in its
own hipness.  When Steve Martin wants you to laugh at something about
Hollywood, you know it's out of authentic whimsy, not a movie star's
hypocritical attempt to cozy up to the laypeople.  As a result, BOWFINGER
feels relaxed and honest, a satire with enough wisdom to recognize there's
still something delightful about being a film-maker.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Hollywood chuckles:  7.</PRE>
