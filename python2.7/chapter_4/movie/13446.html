<P>Certain movies can be marketed for one demographic and made for another.
And often, that same movie may be suitable for neither grouping. When
that happens to a movie, there's an awful, sinking feeling that occurs
while watching it. And you get that feeling when watching the story in
SMALL SOLDIERS unfold. The movie runs 110 minutes long, but somewhere in
the middle it becomes very apparent that this movie was not made for
anyone over twelve years of age. The dialogue, story, and setting are
very childish, and only the spectacular special effects and sometimes
on-target humor make this movie a tad worthwhile. </P>
<P>The movie begins at, conveniently, the beginning, when GloboTech
Industries president Gil Mars (Denis Leary) licenses his weapons
technology to toy makers (headed up by Jay Mohr). Two lines of these
super-smart, self-aware, "living" toys are introduced: the Commando
Elite - G.I. Joe wannabes - and the Gorgonites - STAR WARS alien extras.
These opening scenes are a bit ponderous, and they spend too much time
on characters that aren't important. The most miscast of all is Denis
Leary, whose character is too confined for him to make use of his
cynical comedic talent. Eventually, though, they do introduce the main
plot. A shipment of the toys makes its way to a small-time toy store
owned by Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) and his father (Kevin Dunn). The
first time the toys come "alive," they overrun the store and escape
before anyone notices. This is Alan's fault, because he was supposed to
be watching the store that day. </P>
<P>Alan's got a rocky relationship with his family because he once
graffitied the wall of a school he was at and pulled the fire alarm.
These seemingly superfluous bits of knowledge about Alan's character are
extracted tediously, and to no effect. The biggest result of all of the
development of his character is that his parents don't trust him, which
is the setup for many formulaic scenes. Alan gets caught doing something
that has an explanation, but they won't believe him. This, along with
the very out-of-place love story between Alan and his next-door neighbor
Christy (Kirsten Dunst), are nothing but lopsided lampoons of
prepubescent cinema. There's nothing here that hasn't been done before,
and it's up to the toys to save the day and the integrity of the pic.
Which they do, with varied success. </P>
<P>After the toys escape from the toy store, they fight the battle to end
all battles at Alan's house. There's a lot of unnecessary violence in
this scene and at other points throughout the movie, making it largely
questionable as a children's movie. On one side, the good guy toys - the
Gorgonites - aren't really that likeable. As Alan says, they're "losers
with self-esteem problems." They're programmed to lose, and their
monotonous, defeated voices don't really help. On the other side are the
Commando Elite, which really are the most fun in the entire movie. Tommy
Lee Jones voices the lead Commando, Chip Hazard, with great success, and
if not for the violence included, they would be a fine source of comic
relief. However, that final fallback - the comedy - also fails largely.
Phil Hartman is very underused, and the only jokes that work are
none-too-subtle jabs at the Spice Girls and TITANIC. This movie is just
too off-balance to be much fun, and the target audience is never really
honed in upon. Seeing it is a very gutsy movie.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "SMALL SOLDIERS": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
