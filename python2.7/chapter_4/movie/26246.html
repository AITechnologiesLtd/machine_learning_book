<P>Susan Granger's review of "GIRLFIGHT" (Screen Gems)</P>
<P>Curiously coinciding with the culmination of the summer Olympics, this is a
female twist on the perennially popular, "Rocky"-genre underdog tale. Written
and directed by Karyn Kusama, the coming-of-age story focuses on Diana Guzman
(Michelle Rodriguez), a sullen, tough, pugnacious, young Latina who is
determined to carve a different future for herself. But in Brooklyn's Red Hook
projects, there are not many choices. If she doesn't get pregnant, she's going
to wind up in a dead-end job. "Your mother was a receptionist in a very nice
office," her widower father (Paul Calderon) reminds her. So - without parental
consent - she sneaks into the ring and immediately views boxing as a viable
ticket out of poverty. The shabby gym becomes her sanctuary. She's encouraged by
her paternal coach (Jaime Tirelli) who recognizes her featherweight potential
and channels her rebellious rage into the discipline of the sport, despite the
inevitable ridicule and harassment. There's even a romantic twist provided by a
fellow boxer (Santiago Douglas) who competes with her in the ring. But the
climactic fight is too long and predictable. Plus, the script is burdened with
heavy-handed dramatic confrontations and awkward dialogue. Nevertheless, with
her mean left hook and a big mouth, Michelle Rodriguez - who's reminiscent of a
youthful Marlon Brando - exhibits all the unaffected feistiness necessary to
make her a winner. Indeed, this feminist fairy-tale was highly acclaimed at
Sundance, Cannes, Deauville and Toronto. And it's not surprising that the
brilliant independent film-maker John Sayles lent his expertise as executive
producer. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Girlfight" is a poignant,
satisfying 7 - if you like seeing a muscular girl pummeling and pounding her
opponents.</P>
