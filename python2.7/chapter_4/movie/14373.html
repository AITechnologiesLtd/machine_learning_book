<PRE>HUSBANDS & WIVES (1992)</PRE>
<P>"People grow apart; it's a lot of little personal things."</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Judy Davis, Sydney Pollack, Liam 
Neeson, Juliette Lewis
Written & Directed by Woody Allen
Cinematography by Carlo di Palma</P>
<P>In MANHATTAN, Woody Allen filmed a love letter to New York; it was a 
romantic, sentimental vision of a city and its people, full of glorious 
black-and-white postcard shots and charming portraits.  Diane Keaton's 
character's obsessive self-analysis came across as an endearing 
mannerism, while Mariel Hemingway's teenage love interest did not 
represent anything unhealthy, but simply a stabilizing influence and a 
naïve faith in life to counter the Allen character's angst.</P>
<P>My, how things change.  HUSBANDS & WIVES, fifteen years later, turns 
MANHATTAN inside out.  If the earlier film was an unequivocal 
declaration of love, then the later one is the divorce proceedings after 
the relationship has broken down.  Here, we see a New York that is drab 
and brown and anonymous, filmed with a jittery hand-held camera.  Mia 
Farrow's character's constant dissection of herself and her relationship 
is aggravating in the extreme; Juliette Lewis, the precocious love 
interest, represents nothing healthy at all, but instead typifies the 
Allen character's self-destructive obsession with unstable women.  </P>
<P>  It is occasionally very funny (e.g., when Judy Davis's character 
reveals what she actually thinks about during sex), but more often than 
not it is painful and uncomfortable.  Where MANHATTAN was three-quarters 
comedy and one-quarter drama, HUSBANDS & WIVES inverses those 
proportions.  It pries into the characters' innermost lives, and exposes 
them, warts and all--although, figuratively speaking, when you take away 
the warts, there isn't much left. </P>
<P>But they seem to be happy enough, when we first meet them.  Gabe and 
Judy (Allen, Farrow), a married couple, are about to go out to dinner 
with their good friends Sally and Jack (Davis, Sydney Pollack), when 
Sally and Jack drop a bombshell: they are planning to separate.  This 
stuns Gabe and especially Judy, who is more upset than either Sally or 
Jack, both of whom discuss their separation with equanimity.  No one's 
angry, they say; it's not a tragedy.  But they are; it is.</P>
<P>The "happy" separation lasts until Jack moves in with someone else.  
Then, in one of the finest scenes, Sally, furious, calls him up and 
rants at him, as her date for the evening listens from another room.   
Sally hurls accusations at her ex, then walks out, smooths down her 
dress, and assures her date that she's fine ... then walks back to the 
other room, calls Jack again, and raves some more.  The violently raw 
emotion of Sally's monologue makes us cringe; the reaction shots of her 
date in the other room make us laugh.  Allen, handling his material as 
well as he ever has, is able to make both the drama and the comedy work: 
the tone is always just right.</P>
<P>After Sally and Jack separate, and reveal the cuts that have been 
festering beneath the band-aid of their marriage, Gabe and Judy in turn 
analyze their own relationship.  She wants a baby; he doesn't.  They 
argue.  Finally, he agrees to have sex without contraception, and she 
doesn't want to: now she's not ready for a baby.  This kind of emotional 
doublethink is second nature to these people, and Allen sees it very 
clearly, as when Judy sets up Sally with one of her co-workers (Liam 
Neeson), only to admit later that she was attracted to him herself.</P>
<P>While there is a cutting edge to his wit, Allen is not cruel to his 
characters.  Jack's new amour, a "tofu and crystals" New Age woman, is 
lampooned quite savagely, but she comes across much better than Jack in 
one startling sequence, when he becomes furious with her for embarassing 
him at a party, and ends up embarassing himself more than she ever 
could.  Nothing is straightforward.</P>
<P>Allen could treat these people with disdain, with their euphemisms and 
their analysts and their rationalizations and their self-absorption, but 
instead he sees them for what they are: fairly average people struggling 
to make some sort of accomodation with life, to make some sense of their 
incoherent emotions.  And while there is sympathy, there is also a 
refusal to allow them to make any excuses.  This even-handedness, this 
maturity, is what distinguishes the movie from similar--but more 
simplistic--comedies of modern-day manners.  MANHATTAN may be the better 
movie, but HUSBANDS & WIVES is the wiser one.</P>
