SPEED (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>"Thrillride of the summer" is a magical phrase that saves
legitimate movie critics from being branded sell-outs. It
allows them not to admit that they were degraded to the
intellectual levels of unwashed masses while they were
enjoying Hollywood blockbusters. It also helps them to later
explain why they were giving two, three or five thumbs up to
the industry products that couldn't pass objective
inspection. One of such products, ideal for the use of
phrase, is SPEED, 1994 action thriller by Dutch cameraman
turned director Jan de Bont, summer blockbuster that used to
be called "the movie of the year" in those pre-Tarantino
times.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is nice example of utter simplicity.
Harry Payne (played by Dennis Hopper) is a mad bomber who
wants to extort money from the city of Los Angeles and, in
the process, get even with Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves),
daring policeman who had foiled Payne's similar stunt in the
past. Payne rigs the city bus and sets the device to arms
itself whenever bus exceeds 50 mph speed limit. The bomb
wouldn't explode as long as the speed doesn't decrease below
that level. Traven becomes aware of that and first he races
to get to the moving bus, and than to stop it from going
under the critical speed limit. Among helpless passengers is
Annie (Sandra Bullock), who would have to take the role of a
driver.</P>
<P>Plot, although nothing but a loose cohesive material for
three long and spectacular action scenes, is rather complex
in comparison with the characters in SPEED. This "high
concept" product hardly needs characters - cardboard
cut-outs seem to do the trick. The most noticeable example
is Jack Traven, character without any life apart from what
we see on the screen. Lack of character and emotion is
adequate for the wooden style of acting by Keanu Reeves.
Dennis Hopper, on the other hand, plays just another in his
long series of psychotic villains, not trying at all to be
original. The only real personality in this film is Sandra
Bullock, in rather thankless role of romantic sidekick that,
ironically, launched her into Hollywood major league. But,
she, as well as anything else, is secondary to the
relentless attack on viewers' audio-visual senses and their
hormones. Jan de Bont, after spending lots of his career on
the sets of great directors, learned couple of tricks, and
it shows - SPEED is really entertaining film, full of
breathtaking stunts, explosions, chases and other
spectacular actions. Unfortunately, those qualities seem to
wear off on the second viewing, when the critical audience
becomes painfully aware of paper characters, lot of
implausibilites, lack of originality and whole series of
plot holes who could devour entire galaxies. The impression
is becoming even worse when SPEED gets compared with action
genre classics like DIE HARD or ALIENS, that could entertain
the audience for years afterwards. And here lies the answer
why "thrillrides of the summer" quickly burn out of our
memories as soon as leaves start falling in the autumn.</P>
