<P>     A FOREIGN LAND, which catapults its characters from Brazil to 
Portugal, is a black-and-white thriller that recalls Brazil's Cinema 
Nuovo.  Using various requisite elements of traditional film noir in an 
atypical setting -- the femme fatale, the heroic-but-clueless hero, the 
stolen goods, and the cold-hearted villains, this movie is more 
engrossing than it perhaps has a right to be.  There's nothing 
especially magical or momentous about A FOREIGN LAND, but, after a shaky 
setup, it manages to grip an audience for the balance of its running 
length.</P>
<P>     The film opens with parallel stories.  It's 1990, and Brazil's 
newly-elected president, Fernando Collor, has frozen all personal 
savings accounts.  Young Brazilians, fearing a bleak economic future, 
leave the country in droves.  Amongst them is Alex (Fernanda Torres), 
who would rather eke out an existence as a waitress in Portugal than 
remain in Sao Paolo.  Meanwhile, back in Brazil, Paco (Fernando Alves 
Pinto) dreams of traveling abroad, and, when his mother drops dead of 
shock after learning that the government has confiscated her life's 
savings, Paco no longer has anything holding him at home.  Accepting a 
"delivery job" from a shady "businessman", Paco is off to Lisbon.  When 
things go wrong, Paco and Alex are thrown together, and end up on the 
run with a violin full of uncut diamonds and an underworld honcho 
(Tcheky Karyo) on their trail.</P>
<P>     Much of the first half of A FOREIGN LAND is slow and disjointed.  
The setup, which basically comprises everything leading up to Alex and 
Paco's first meeting, seemingly takes forever.  We get to know the 
characters, but wonder if anything interesting is ever going to happen.  
During this part of the film, there's also a painfully obvious plot 
device that has one of the characters selling a passport.  Once the 
movie reaches its narrative meat, however, it quickly becomes involving 
and suspenseful.  Aided by stark black-and-white cinematography and 
crisp dialogue, the second half of A FOREIGN LAND is about as good as 
modern film noir gets.  </P>
<P>     The political background and international settings are what 
differentiate A FOREIGN LAND from most other low-budget thrillers.  The 
usage of Sao Paolo and Lisbon as locations is a lot fresher than, say, 
New York and London.  The result is that, while A FOREIGN LAND doesn't 
strike out in any amazingly new directions, it adds enough unique dashes 
to a familiar genre to captivate an audience.</P>
