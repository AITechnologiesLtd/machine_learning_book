<P>And this is where the story really starts.  Manon, now a grown teenager
decides
to take her revenge in her own hands, on the people who destroyed her
father.</P>
<P>With the help of an outsider boyfriend they begin planning their attack,
until
the old farmer's accomplice is found out and kills himself.  At that point
the
old farmer is lost, and has little strength to keep up the chore of plugging
the well every time it swells up.  The problems mount until 2/3 of the way
the film drops a brick on your head.</P>
<P>An elder woman, who lives elsewhere, comes to visit.  She was one of the old
farmer's flames, and dearly loved him.  She loved him so much that when she
got pregnant she kept the child.  And she tells the story of the child
growing
up away from dad.  And in the meantime Yves Montand's face begins to turn
sad, that the woman he loved the most, never told him the story before, and
they never married,  which they both wanted.</P>
<PRE>As it turns out, she was the mother, and he was the father.  In essence he
was
the murderer of his own son.  And he now has to live out the rest of his
life,
knowing of his guilt.</PRE>
<P>He absolves himself, apologizes to Manon, and clears himself before he dies,
a disappointed man, sad in love, and sadder in life.</P>
<P>The beauty of this film is the turnaround between what is really a set of
criminal actions, and the kharma which begets him.  What he did to others,
he
now pays in full unto himself.  The suffering he applied to others, he now
has to face in full.  And he does, thus showing his strength and ability.</P>
<P>Manon and her husband unplug the well, the town is happy, and the prosperity
will now start.</P>
<P>It isn't often that a story is told, and keeps you in, only to find out that
all that matters is not gold.  And when it does, the story has to deal with
it without throwing it away.  This film does, and delivers with as much
beauty
as there is.</P>
<P>If you have the patience to see this film, do so.  You will be stunned, but
you will like it.  It delivers, like most films don't.</P>
<P>A MUST SEE.  But it only makes good sense if you see both films, since the
first film explains the outcome and actions of the second film.  SUBTITLES,
you say, so what. A film is a film, and to take care of the action like this
novel does is an accomplishment not often done in film.  This is LITERATURE
at
its best on film.  This is not ENTERTAINMENT.  And as literature, it teaches
and helps us along.</P>
<P>ENJOY IT.  The Acting is superb, and this was Yves Montand best role ever.
He
won several international awards for it.  It's a tour the force, and a real
shame that he gets ignored for the Oscars.  There isn't much better work
around that can stand up to this kind of material.  Brilliantly written and
taken care of with just as much care.  Wonderful music and visuals through
out, as it has 'poetic' moments every now and then, giving us the seers a
chance to catch our breath, and evaluate what went on.</P>
<P>If you like good work, this is as good as it gets, or are likely to find.</P>
