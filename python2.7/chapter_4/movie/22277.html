<P>Just as the original "Psycho" sired the slasher genre, John Carpenter's
"Halloween" solidified the genre that became more shock for your buck than
genuine scares. Amazing that so few directors followed Carpenter's model -
atmosphere to spare and a chilling sense of doom that none of the sequels or
"Friday the 13th" films ever came close to capture. "Halloween" has its flaws,
but it is a superb scare show - a triumphant exercise in style that dictates
its substance.</P>
<P>"Halloween" begins with a young kid walking around the outside of his house,
looking for his sister. He grabs a mask and a kitchen knife, approaches his
sister's bedroom by walking up the stairs and finally stabs her. All this time,
Carpenter shows us what this kid does from his point-of-view - a very
subjective stance that comes from Hitchcock and, of course, the notorious
"Peeping Tom," which showed the killer filming his subjects as he killed them.
The kid is Michael Myers, who is admitted to a mental institution. Nearly a
decade later, Michael is still in a institution, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam
Loomis (Donald Pleasance), is checking on him obsessively, aware that he is
pure evil. During a rainy night, Michael escapes and drives away and now Loomis
is in hot pursuit of someone he calls "inhumanly patient." </P>
<P>The story then shifts to October 31st, the celebrated day of Halloween, at the
calm, homely town of Haddonfield, Illinois. We see a teenage woman named Laurie
Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) walking to school with a young kid who believes in
bogeymen. They make plans for the evening since Laurie will be babysitting him
(the title of the film was originally "The Babysitter Murders."). Then we meet
some of Laurie's friends, who are actively dating and dreaming of sexual
escapades, yet Laurie is the lonely, straight girl of the trio. There is the
brunette-haired Annie (Nancy Kyes), whose father (Leigh Brackett) is a local
cop, and Lynda (P.J. Soles), the ditzy blonde who ends every sentence with the
word "totally." They all make plans for the evening since Annie and Laurie are
babysitting, and Lynda wants to bring her boyfriend over at one house. And in
this town, terror awaits - Michael Myers is paying a visit to wreak havoc. </P>
<P>"Halloween" is almost monochromatic in its look - the scenes during the day are
overcast and the nights are truly dark where silhouettes and shadows exist -
perfect time for Michael to attack (in one scene, Michael kills a dog and
offscreen, we hear it whimper). Carpenter uses the hand-held camera effectively
to build the tension by choosing to follow the subjective nature of its
characters. Examples of such moments are when Annie hears noises outside her
house as she prepares to do laundry, the car that comes to a screeching halt
when Annie shouts, "Speed kills," the discovery of the dead bodies by Laurie,
and so on. Subjectivity is especially well-handled when Laurie walks across the
street to the house where Lynda and Annie are supposedly, and this scene,
accompanied by Carpenter's famously eerie electronic score, is a hark back to
Vera Miles' similar walk to the Bates House in "Psycho." </P>
<P>What is particularly arresting about "Halloween" is that the characters are not
killed immediately - Carpenter lets us observe these teenagers and who they
are. The long takes of Laurie, Annie and Lynda walking home from school show us
the daily activities and thoughts of teenage girls, oblivious to the unseen
terror about to take place. Laurie is not as oblivious, and conveniently sees
Michael Myers hiding in bushes, driving by, or standing by his car while she
looks from behind windows. Lots of subjective shots throughout, and the
suspense builds with a real pulse eschewing any of the gore or blood that would
have diminished its overall power. These tree-lined avenues of Middle America
hide something inexplicable and without emotion, and all Laurie can do is run
and cry when she finds that this killer is after her (in a way, Laurie's escape
from an unstoppable killer led the way to Linda Hamilton's escape from the
unstoppable Schwarzeneger in "The Terminator") There's a terrifying moment
where Laurie begs for help from a neighbor, and the neighbor observes and
closes her shades, thinking it is a Halloween prank.. "Oh, my God! Help,"
shouts the helpless Laurie. </P>
<P>There is a stretch of Catholicism in "Halloween" emanating from its
semi-Production Code morals (though the Production Code was eliminated back in
the late 50's). The idea is that any teenager girl or boy who has sex or
lustful thoughts is killed by Michael Myers. Laurie is the only survivor
because she is still a virgin, though she may have lustful thoughts about a guy
in her class. "So. You do think about things like that, don't you Laurie," says
Annie at one point. The only thing Laurie does that may make her a member of
this triad is that she smokes marihuana, yet has more interest in chemistry and
studying than any of her friends do. Since this premarital sex-is-a-sin complex
began in "Halloween," it became a mode for all rip-offs to follow. You have
sex, and you will die, as indicated in the post-modern "Scream." </P>
<P>Back in 1978, "Halloween" was made for a low-budget and went on to gross
millions of dollars making it the biggest independent film ever (initial
reviewers panned it until someone from Variety spoke highly of it).  It is a
superb motion picture, reveling in its atmospheric, nocturnal pull guaranteed
to give you some major shivers. Precisely, what makes this horror film so
central to the genre is acknowledging that it is what you don't see that can
kill you in the dark. </P>
