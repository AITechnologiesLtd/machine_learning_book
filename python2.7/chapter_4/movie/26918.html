<PRE>ME & ISAAC NEWTON
A film review by Norm Schrager

<P>Michael Apted, master of the forward-thinking 7 Up series (42 Up has
just been released on video), now offers up a documentary about
ambitious people like himself.  Really ambitious people.</P>
<P>Apted's Me & Isaac Newton brings us inside seven groundbreaking
scientific minds.  We get to know their studies, and we also get to know
them.  But what begins as fascinating documentary greatness fizzles down
to a lengthy, anti-climactic ending.  Insert your own Big Bang joke
here.</P>
<P>The film starts off reflecting Apted's skill as a storyteller and
filmmaker, with an almost wondrous feel to the introduction.  The seven
masterminds explain why they are so eager -- practically desperate -- to
figure out the world.  Meanwhile, appropriate imagery slowly fills the
screen -- a cool, blue universe or a shaking collection of cells, ironic
combinations of the literal and abstract.</P>
<P>Since the scientists interviewed are so diverse in their work, they're
worth mentioning: a nuclear physicist searching for dimensions beyond
the third; a Nobel Prize-winning pharmaceutical chemist; a primatologist
who visited Madagascar and never left; a robotics expert; an Indian man
creating clean drinking water in third-world areas; a cognitive
scientist figuring out how and why we use verbal language; and a leading
authority in the study of cancer.  Man, you could get smart just
standing near these people.</P>
<P>In getting them to the big screen, Apted does a couple of things right:
first, he works within a strong formula, helpful due to the size of the
group (the same size as his 1997 companion film, Inspirations).  First
we learn of the participants' childhoods and early interests (some
stories are a hoot), and we then get a glimpse into their work and the
hopes that have sprung from them.  Second, Apted has really picked the
right people for us to meet.  At least three of them (the physicist,
primatologist, and water chemist) could easily have had substantial,
individual biographies made just about them.</P>
<P>But at a point late in the film, Me & Isaac Newton succumbs to that
liability of all documentaries: it has a filmmaker that appears too
close to the subject matter.  The result, as it seems here, is that
Apted doesn't know when to stop, forgetting that you can give too much
of a good thing.  In my opinion, the scientists provide nothing too
revealing after about 90 minutes, and the movie runs about 20 minutes
beyond that.</P>
<P>But that first hour-and-a-half makes for a classic documentary.  The
subject matter is vital, the people involved are smart, easy to listen
to, and full of energy, and the director carefully weaves the
first-person stories to highlight their variety, similarities, and
originality.  There were at least three times during the film where I
found a revelation or idea to be just incredible.</P>
<P>Why can't we break through to the 10th dimension?  How come we learn
language in a few years, and not thirty minutes?  What is the next
disease to be conquered?  Apted's subjects ask these questions, and
prepare to answer them like very few people in the world.  But why are
they doing so on the big screen?  The film's run is very limited, so one
can assume that the motive is Oscar-driven, and once the movie loses its
punch toward the end, that statue seems unlikely.</P>
<P>For all its meaningful, insightful knowledge, Me & Isaac Newton doesn't
have to be seen in a theater.  I would have been just as happy seeing it
on PBS or Discovery.</P>
