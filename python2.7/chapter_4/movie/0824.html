<PRE>                               METROPOLITAN
                       A film review by Ed Nilges
                        Copyright 1990 Ed Nilges</PRE>
<PRE>     Who else saw this move, and what did you think of it?  I give it 5
out of 5 for freshness and originality, 4 out of 5 overall.</PRE>
<P>     METROPOLITAN is about a group of TwentySomethings, self-described
as "Urban Haute Bourgeois."  However, it's not yet another movie about
rich people.  Most movies made today, *unless* they are explicitly about
an underclass or a Dark Side, are made about fictional characters with
enough money to decorate a set.  The makers of movies, for the most
part, lack the imagination to see that there is any sort of interesting
freedom in characters explicitly constrained by the need to earn money.
This is perhaps because the lives of such people have a highly iterative
character (get up, catch the bus, work, go home: da capo): but a
Minimalist composer such as Phillip Glass has made something out of
sheer iteration, and the film My Dinner With Andre has as a secondary
character one who (quite unusually) practically makes an appeal for
personal financial salvation in his own movie.</P>
<P>     Although the characters in METROPOLITAN are not immediately worried
about paying the rent, there is an interesting tension between their
elite background (shopping at Brooks Brothers) and the rather humdrum
prospects they enjoy.  The movie makes the point that even an expensive
education is no guarantee of self-fulfillment, or even of an interesting
or rewarding job.  One of the best scenes in the film takes place at
T. J. Melon's, an East Side watering hole where two of the main
characters meet up with a semi-failure in unfashionably wide lapels and
a Princeton tie.</P>
<P>     More poignantly, one of the characters of the film is the son of
divorced parents.  Divorce, of course, introduces steep decline in the
lives of the ex-wife, and the children, who usually stay with the
ex-wife.  It's hard for the characters in this situation not to at least
try to keep up appearances, and the note of shabby gentility is a new
element in American film.</P>
<P>     For films up to now have been stories of social ascent, whether
legal or illegal (cf. THE GODFATHER).  Somewhat more innovative are
stories of recovery (as in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE) where a character
finds that her decline is due to character flaws which she can herself
change.  Any decline undergone by the characters in METROPOLITAN is not
due to character flaws.  The people in this film are noble in a fashion
that reminds the viewer of Jane Austen, a writer discussed in the movie.
The men, in particular, clumsily try to behave as paladins in a way
thought outdated even in F. Scott Fitzgerald's time, which is decried
as "sexist" by the women, but which provides the (slightly
disappointing) resolution of the movie.</P>
<P>     Underneath the modulated voices, the chivalry, I sensed a low key
and smoldering anger in METROPOLITAN.  This is an anger at fathers who
absented themselves from families in their own search for self-
fulfillment.  Unlike the modal fathers of my generation (I'm 40), who
came home to their families and who exhausted themselves meeting their
needs, the father of the generation of METROPOLITAN is presented as one
overly concerned with his own needs...who moves, for example, to New
Mexico without telling his son, and who leaves his son's old toys in the
street for his son to stumble upon (Manhattan is a small place in its
way.)</P>
<P>     Since it's too hard to confront the Father directly, we get instead
a large, aristocratic figure in a pony tail who is the same age as the
characters in METROPOLITAN, but who comports himself, according to one
of them, in a despicable way.  This involves treating women as sex
objects.  Although the male characters, in making this charge, are
themselves charged with sexism by the women in the film, they are
obviously reacting to the economic sexism of fathers who left their
families in the financial lurch in a way described by Barbara Ehrenreich
(see her books THE HEARTS OF MEN and THE WORST YEARS OF OUR LIVES).  A
hundred years ago, the character who confronts Lord PonyTail would have
charged him with toying with the affections of women.  I half-expected a
challenge to a duel in one drawing-room scene.  Now, the charge is that
Lord PonyTail is treating women as sex objects.  Are the two charges
actually equivalent?</P>
<P>     But Lord PonyTail (whose long hair now marks him as Out Of The
Past) is not *really* the hero's father, any more than the gun the hero
pulls is a real gun.  Audrey is at once amused, and impressed by her
parfit, gentil knight's assault on The Dark Tower.  Perhaps this leaves
room at the end for forgiveness of the *real* father.  Can the *real*
fathers of that generation redeem themselves?  Question for discussion:
is the *real* father that generation which treated child support as a
non-starter for much the same reasons they treated energy conservation
as a non-starter?  That generation which has several divisions of
TwentySomethings in the Persian Gulf at risk as I write, for this
reason?</P>
