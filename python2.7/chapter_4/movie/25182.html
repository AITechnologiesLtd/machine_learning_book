"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Toward the end of Fox's new animated feature Titan AE, one of its
characters shouts `Let's not do that again,' after flying a spaceship
through a tough-to-navigate ice field.  One has to wonder when Fox is
going to come to the same conclusion about their animated film division.
They continue to shell out top dollar to produce expensive ‘toons that
are panned by critics and go widely unseen by the public (like 1997's
Anastasia).</P>
<P>Titan lifts its story from – oh, I don't know – every successful
science-fiction film that I've ever seen in my life.  The only thing
that keeps Titan from being an extremely unwatchable film is the
animation, which is astonishingly well-done here.  But like other highly
touted animated films of late, Titan's vividly realistic backgrounds and
inanimate objects are ruined by dull sketches of people and other
assorted creatures.  Why does the technology used to animate humans seem
like it hasn't been updated since Pearl Harbor?  I've seen
better-looking people in after school cartoons and video games, not to
mention Toy Story and its sequel.</P>
<P>Titan is set some 1,000 years from now and kicks off with a spectacular
opening sequence, where an alien race called The Dredge hover over Earth
with the intention of destroying our planet.  The Dredge don't mess
around like those pesky creatures from ID4.  They blow Earth up in all
of five seconds, sending chunks of it scattering around the solar system
like the lumps of loose stool in my toilet after a night of hearty
Mexican food and beer (hence the AE – for `After Earth').  Some of
Earth's humans manage to escape before The Dredge do their dirty work,
including a blond scamp named Cale (Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3).  Cale's
father gives him a pat on the head and a gold ring, and tells him that
he'll see him in a few years.</P>
<P>Flash to fifteen years later, where an adult Cale (Matt Damon, The
Talented Mr. Ripley) is working as a space welder on a salvage station.
With most of Earth's inhabitants destroyed by The Dredge, humans are now
looked down on and bullied like members of a middle-school chess club.
One day, the Luke Skywalker-like Cale is approached by the Han Solo-like
Korso (Bill Pullman, Brokedown Palace), who tells him that he is the
only person in the galaxy that can determine the location of something
called the Titan Project, which is supposed to be humanity's only chance
at defeating The Dredge.</P>
<P>It turns out that Cale's ring, which he wears every day despite hating
his father for leaving him, is genetically encrypted and produces a map
revealing the location of the Titan (of course the magic ring appears on
his hand only when it's integral to the plot, and Cale never noticed the
little buttons on the inside that Korso presses to activate the stupid
thing).  Cale is reluctant at first, but eventually relents and joins
Korso in his search for the Titan.  Korso has a bunch of sidekicks,
including a super-genius turtle that sounds like Peter Lorre (John
Leguizamo, Summer of Sam), a gun-toting bad-ass (Nathan Lane, Isn't She
Great), something called Stith (Janeane Garofalo, 200 Cigarettes) and a
gorgeous brunette named Akima (Drew Barrymore, Never Been Kissed).</P>
<P>There are no surprises in Titan's script.  In fact, the only thing
remotely unexpected is how little the characters look like their
real-life counterparts.  I always thought that animators tried to make
their characters appear somewhat similar to the actors that provide
their voices.  Damon is the only one who comes close, but his Cale is a
dead-ringer for James Van Der Beek (I kept waiting for the Paula Cole
song to sneak up on me).  Pullman isn't close at all, and Barrymore's
character looks Asian, and even has an Asian-sounding name.  Lane would
probably burst into tears just from seeing a photograph of a gun, so the
idea of him playing his role is laughable.</P>
<P>I expected a lot more from Titan, especially considering the talent that
produced the script.  Three gifted writers (Joss Whedon, Buffy the
Vampire Slayer), John August (Go) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) churned out
a paint-by-numbers story with a really silly ending.  Their script was
based on a story by Randall McCormick (Speed 2: Cruise Control) and Hans
Bauer (Anaconda), which could explain a lot about the film's
crapulence.  I was looking forward to snappy dialogue and witty banter,
like from Buffy and Go, but there was precious little to enjoy.  I did
laugh out loud at the cheesy A-Teamesque montage of Cale and friends
repairing a dilapidated spaceship, but I don't think that's what
overrated directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman (Anastasia) were going
for.</P>
<P>So who exactly is supposed to want to see Titan?  The question is a
no-brainer, judging from the people that showed up for the advanced
screening.  The film is targeted to prepubescent boys and nerdy men that
still haven't seen a real live naked woman yet.  This is probably why
the plot features a jaded guy with floppy hair that doesn't fit in
socially and still manages to land an impossibly curvy girlfriend.  It's
also chock-full of songs from Powerman 5000, Lit, Luscious Jackson and a
plethora of other hot modern rock ballads.</P>
<P>1:34 - PG for action violence, brief language, an animated bare ass and
the implication that Cale has a boner in one scene</P>
