<P>     The best anti-drug movies are the ones that eschew sermons.  
Nothing turns off an audience faster than a film that becomes pedantic.  
However, when a production gets the message across through a story that 
lacks even a trace of artifice, its effectiveness is indisputable.  Such 
is the case with THE BASKETBALL DIARIES, film maker Scott Kalvert's 
updating of Jim Caroll's autobiographical novel.  The tale related here 
isn't all that original, but the honest presentation lends impact to a 
wrenching scenario. </P>
<P>     Jimmy Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a star basketball player on 
his New York City Catholic school team.  Fellow roundballers Mickey 
(Mark Wahlberg) and Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and unofficial cheerleader 
Pedro (James Madio) are Jimmy's closest friends, and whenever trouble 
stalks one, it invariably affects them all.  So, when the drug cycle 
starts, it quickly spreads to each of the four corners of the 
friendship.  What begins as casual use first becomes a weekend habit, 
then an everyday obsession.  Grades plummet, on-court performance 
becomes unreliable, and crime looms as the only means to pay for a 
seemingly-endless supply of uppers, downers, cocaine, and heroin. </P>
<P>     There have been quite a few addiction movies, but most are surface 
melodramas, concerned with busting the bad guys or facilitating a 
Hollywood-style transformation from user to productive member of 
society.  Films like THE BASKETBALL DIARIES, which paint a stark, ugly 
portrait of drug abuse, are rare.  This is not the type of picture 
likely to draw big at the box office.  Much of what's shown is simply 
too raw for audiences out for a couple hours' entertainment. </P>
<P>     In THIS BOY'S LIFE, Leonardo DiCaprio played a young man coming of 
age in the Pacific Northwest.  Here, though his character undergoes a 
far different change, the actor's performance is equally on-target.  
Because it demands so much range, the role of Jimmy Carroll requires 
more effort, but DiCaprio doesn't miss a beat. </P>
<P>     The decay of the individual always makes for powerful drama.  Such 
was the case with Cyril Collard's SAVAGE NIGHTS, and it is no less true 
here.  The teen years -- an age of rebellion and uncertainty in the best 
of circumstances -- can be devastating when an individual loses control.  
THE BASKETBALL DIARIES captures this with brutal effectiveness.  Facile 
escapes are rejected, and the resolution is acceptable because we can 
believe it.  In fact, that's the reason this film works as well as it 
does:  credibility.  You won't need many fingers to count the times when 
scenes ring false.  By another name, call this HOOP NIGHTMARES.   </P>
