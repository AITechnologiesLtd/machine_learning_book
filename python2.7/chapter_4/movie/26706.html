<P>A 70mm Cinemascope spectacular directed by Mr. Stanley Kubrick, a format of 
film ratio in the same breadth since its inception in 1953's "The Robe," as 
well as many other epics. No, this is not "2001: A Space Odyssey." It is one 
of Kubrick's lesser works, at least in contrast with the films he created 
later on. "Spartacus" is the "Gladiator" of 1960 and far superior to its 
modern counterpart. It is often beautifully made, wonderfully scored, and 
exceptionally acted by most of the principal actors, but it is also a 
long-winded story with not enough pathos to warrant a more than three-hour 
length. </P>
<P>Spartacus (played by the dignified Kirk Douglas) is a born slave selected to 
become a gladiator by the brutal yet cowardly Batiatus (Peter Ustinov, who 
won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Spartacus joins a gladiator school that 
has a tough regiment which includes running, jumping, dueling and avoiding a 
spinning ball with blunt projections (later used to similar effect in 
countless films including "First Knight"). These training gladiators are 
treated like prisoners of war - they are housed in dark, unpleasant dungeons 
where outside light hardly exists. Women are given to them to be pleased, but 
Spartacus proves to be impotent since love is something he is not experienced 
in - some of these scenes show the tender side of Kirk Douglas that has 
rarely been shown before or since. </P>
<P>One day, the domineering, sardonic General Crassus (Laurence Olivier) visits 
the school along with some gleefully depraved friends to watch a real fight 
to the death. Batiatus is reluctant to stage such a fight but gives in 
anyway. Spartacus and an Ethiopian (played by the late Woody Strode) fight 
for the pleasure of the spectators, who interestingly seem to ignore the 
brutal fight until the moment of the kill. The Ethiopian chooses not to kill 
Spartacus while holding him down, and is thus killed by Crassus. </P>
<P>Later, there is a revolt against the guards and an escape, though the slaves 
first stage similar fights to the death among the surviving guards. Spartacus 
is disgusted at such conduct in general, and persuades the slaves to fight 
the Romans in full glory, perhaps they could be called the "paths of glory." 
The rest of the film focuses on Spartacus' strategies to fight the Roman 
legions through most of Italy, while the Senate deals with the aspiring 
dictatorial machinations of Crassus in contrast with the older, wiser General 
Gracchus (Charles Laughton), who is wholly opposed to his sadistic, prideful 
antagonist. It is like a political campaign full of the usual backstabbers 
and irate politicians. </P>
<P>The film's pleasures are listening to these Senate hearings, and the 
conversations between Crassus and Batiatus, and Batiatus and Gracchus - both 
Crassus and Gracchus are politicians with slightly different agendas on how 
to attack Spartacus' army. There is also some unusual insights on the private 
lives of Crassus and Gracchus, particularly for 1960. We learn that Crassus 
is bisexual and also pines for Spartacus' wife, Varinia (Jean Simmons). There 
is an originally censored scene, later restored, where Crassus shares a bath 
with a slave, Antoninus (Tony Curtis), who later joins Spartacus' army. The 
sly discussion is on oysters and snails, and Crassus admits he likes both 
oysters and snails (Olivier's lines were later post-dubbed by Anthony Hopkins 
for the 1990 restoration). In contrast, Gracchus is merely a womanizer and 
lives with several women who attend to his every whim.</P>
<P>If "Spartacus" suffers, it is from the developing relationship between 
Spartacus and Varinia, another former slave, which is often playful but 
mostly dated in its peculiar innocence. There must have been some strain on 
their marriage considering the chaos in and around Rome and her incoming 
pregnancy but because of the time in which this film was released, one must 
not fret over such details. </P>
<P>Another flaw is how Spartacus is presented in the film. The adapted 
screenplay by the formerly blacklisted Dalton Trumbo focuses on the strength 
of Spartacus as a skilled fighter and his transition into an exceptional 
general with an acute sense of planning battle strategies. The first half of 
the film certainly shows that side of Spartacus, but as the film spans its 
196 minute running time, we find that less focus is placed on Spartacus and 
more on Varinia's eventual escape from the throes of Crassus, who wants to 
possess and own her. By the end of the film, Spartacus becomes a supporting 
player who is left crucified on a cross as are all his troop members. </P>
<P>"Spartacus" is often breathtaking and alluring, and the battle scenes are 
well-directed and disorienting. This is a film that must be seen in a 
theatre, particularly to be astounded by the 70mm format that fills our own 
field of vision in ways most movies today do not. As compared to most of 
Kubrick's epics, however, which never seem dated and evolve with each passing 
generation, this one is just a pleasant time filler, an interlude for those 
interested in Kubrick's career. It is the one film where he had the least 
creative control over his vision, and it shows. </P>
