<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I almost began this review writing something like, "Pigeons defecating
on Oliver Platt's face is not a funny sight," but then I remembered that
there were, in fact, people in the theater laughing as this statement
becomes reality in the final moments of Doctor Dolittle.  I don't want
to sound condescending, because there are clearly people in the world
who will find this to be a good family film (Roger Ebert, for instance,
actually *liked* it).  I felt kind of the same way I did as I watched
Flubber, which is unbearable in many of the same ways.</P>
<P>        Doctor Dolittle is not a funny film.  It has entertaining moments, and
I might have chuckled once or twice, but mostly I was just bored.  It's
under 90 minutes, which I found to be a blessing, even though it feels a
little longer than Lawrence of Arabia (but without the excitement). 
It's a one-joke movie (talking animals!), in which the joke gets old
almost as it's told --  it's not cute, or fun, and it substitutes trite
sentimentality for Deep Themes and Messages.  The only thing I felt as I
walked out of the theater was the urge to vomit, and I'm not
exaggerating.</P>
<P>        Eddie Murphy, seemingly unmoved by the fact that his roles no longer
require his comic talents as an actor, plays John Dolittle.  It's
established that he could talk to animals as a child, but a nasty
preacher scared the talent out of him.  Now, as the preview shouts, "the
doctor is in!" (I don't know what that has to do with anything, but I
though it would make a nice quote).  His talent is back, and he finds
that animals are going to him with their problems.</P>
<P>        Some animals are easy to repair, like the owl with a stick in its
wing.  Then there are the harder ones, like the suicidal tiger (voice by
Albert Brooks).  It might be totally useless to bother with the
logistical errors of the film, but, frankly, they irritated me.  Now,
when was the last time you saw a tiger attempt suicide?  And by jumping
off a building?  Don't bother answering that, for I doubt many people
have.  The animals in this film don't act like animals -- they act like
people trapped in the bodies of animals.</P>
<P>        So, no one believes poor Dolittle, and he gets put in a mental
institution, because he's a danger to himself and to everyone around
him.  What I didn't understand is why Dolittle was also the only person
who could see the animal's lips moving.  I'll buy the fact that he's the
only one who can hear their voices, but their lips are clearly moving. 
Why can't anyone else see that?  The film is so poorly conceived that
even a minor problem like this is simply ignored, as if no one will
care.  I really hope someone else does.</P>
<P>        Now, like all stupid wannabe family films, I'll say that I would have
looked past all these problems had the film something to offer.  Paulie,
which was another talking animal thingy, was a nice film, with a little
wit and a lot more entertainment value (and I buy a talking parrot more
than anything presented in Doctor Dolittle).  This film, directed by
Betty Thomas, is boring.  The animals may have a few good lines, and
some of the special effects are easy on the eyes.  But, most obvious is
the lack of energy out of Murphy, and the general lack of intelligence
in the film.</P>
<P>        And, of course, it resorts to defecation for laughs.  Feces is never
funny, and especially when it's splashed on the face of an actor as
talented as Oliver Platt (who is shamelessly wasted here).  Why do
"family" films have to fall back on this kind of material?  Had the
talking animals bit been done more competently, then feces and
flatulence would not have been necessary.  Kids were laughing at the
things I thought were amusing here, so I'm going to hold with the belief
that feces is not necessary to entertain children.  You can call me
old-fashioned for thinking that kids deserve more than this.</P>
