<P>You can learn a lot about society by seeing who it celebrates. That's
the message in /Celebrity/, a funny typically-neurotic Woody Allen
film.</P>
<P>/Celebrity/ follows the life of an estranged journalist Lee Simon
(Kenneth Branagh) who appears to be blessed with some of the best and
worst luck a human being could have.  On the one hand, he attracts
gorgeous women who are willing to do almost anything for him (though
one claims her body is owned by her husband but her head isn't?!?).
On the other hand, he invariably screws things up such that in the end
he is left alone, as his dreams and ambitions drift away with the
waves.</P>
<P>The movie is also about the lives of the rich and the famous and the
power they wield over others. Brandon Darrow (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a
non-typical bad boy role), for example, is a famous actor sought after
by Simon to star in the script he's hawking. Simon does everything to
please Darrow but that only lands him in trouble (and a $6000 debt!).
Likewise, people currying favours from Simon (given his journalist
status) are left in the cold.  The lesson: like with everywhere else,
there are few nice people in the industry.  There is some commentary
about celebrating and glorifying people, but it gets lost in the
shuffle that is Simon's woes.</P>
<P>/Celebrity/ remains interesting because of the famous actors playing
the characters that Simon flirts with, including Wynona Ryder, Melanie
Lee Griffith, Famke Janssen, and Charlize Theron.  As is typical with
many Woody Allen films, the movie is extremely hilarious at times and
manages to keep you amused through-out.  The film is done entirely in
pretentious artsy-fartsy black and white.  </P>
<P>Lee Simon as a character is reminiscent of Sherman McCoy from /The
Bonfire of the Vanities/.  It's tempting to look at the character of
Simon as a portrayal of Woody Allen (particularly given Branagh's
excellent mimicry), and perhaps this is what the Director intended. If
this is the case, Allen either has a confused view of himself or
enjoys taking us all for a ride.</P>
