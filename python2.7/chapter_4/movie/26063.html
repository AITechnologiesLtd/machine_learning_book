<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An affectionate coming-of-age tale, set in 1983, about a teenager from
the upper-middle-class environment of Dutchess County, New York. The
film has some eccentric characters influence the life of the
underachieving teenager Sebastian Cole (Adrian Grenier), but it is his
shaggy-haired stepfather Hank (Clark Gregg) who influences him more than
anyone else, including his real parents. Sebastian's ambition to be a
writer is never developed except through the adventures he goes through
in his senior year in high school. These misguided adventures are things
a kid needing but not getting parental help might do. The adventures
include a hapless teenage romance, an heroic rescue of a kidnapped girl
from a pimp, trips into NYC's punk rock scene, and nearly killing
himself while trying to prove how much he could drink. He considers
these episodes to be Ernest Hemingway-like experiences. The film with
all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story,
still remains grounded in reality, accurately picturing the wasteland of
suburban life in the 1980s.</P>
<P>Sebastian has a pretty Prince Charles haircut, which allows him to look
innocent no matter the incident, even when he seems to be bleeding to
death in either Mexico or someplace in the American Southwest, where the
film opens, or when innocently engaging in a spicy dinner conversation
with all of his dysfunctional family present (Is there any other kind,
in teen movies?).</P>
<P>The film is told in flashback from the point where he is bleeding and
being nursed by a beautiful senorita, and he looks at a wallet-sized
photo of his family and remembers how his family life quickly unraveled
when his stepfather, Hank, announced that he's planning to become a
woman. His bitchy sister Jessica takes off on a motorcycle with her
unappealing boyfriend Troy (Macht) for an early start to Stanford in
order to get far away from the family; his perturbable and alcoholic
British mother Joan (Colin), leaves her second husband and takes
Sebastian back to England with her; while, his real father Hartley
(Shea), a successful but egocentric architect, tells him the only way to
be successful is not to be a nice person and let no one interfere with
your ambitions.</P>
<P>Unhappy with life in England, he returns to upstate New York to live
with Hank, who has changed his name to Henrietta and now wears dresses.
He is undergoing hormonal treatment as he awaits his sex change
operation. Henrietta becomes a real mother to him, making the tardy
student get to school on time, threatening him with military school if
the capable student doesn't get his grades up, and he provides support
for him financially and emotionally, as Sebastian tries to work out his
disappointment that Hank broke up his family with his announcement. But
even if Henrietta is strict with him, he offers him a mother's love and
a father's guidance.</P>
<P>Sebastian's only ambition is to graduate early from high school (needing
Physical Ed to graduate, he fakes an expertise in karate in front of gym
teachers, in lieu of attending regular classes), as he is restless about
his future and not ready to fit into life in Dutchess County just yet,
he mainly hangs around with another rebellious student Wayne, and while
shooting arrows for target practice, meets Mary (Palladino). Their
romance is a sexually charged teenage one, probably not going anywhere
until Mary professes a love for him. This frightens him, arousing his
hidden insecurities, and he moves away from her. It becomes apparent to
him as his life becomes troublesome, that the only one who is there for
him, is Henrietta, the ex-marine, who dishes out his/her love with a
barrage of pep talks and lectures.</P>
<P>The charming Adrian Grenier is appealing to a certain extent as the hero
who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way. Clark Gregg
plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman, but who has
been a man so long and still looks like one, that there is certain
smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman. But, the story
never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a father undergoing a sex
change and the devastating reaction it has for his family. It seems to
wither towards its climax. Henrietta becomes unexplained, as if he/she
has no psychology and that we must just accept him/her as the
one-dimensional angelic character he/she is portrayed as. When we see
him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who
makes fun of him, we're into a typical macho Hollywood response mode to
such problems, and it becomes apparent that this character will remain
underdeveloped. The film setups an engaging story but didn't take it
anywhere special, as it was a let down after such a fast start and such
a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from
such an unlikely source as Gregg. You can rest assured, that this
offbeat teenager comedy/drama, returns safely back to its genre's teen
movie fold by the film's end, and that is its main fault.</P>
