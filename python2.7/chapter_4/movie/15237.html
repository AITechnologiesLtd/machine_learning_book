 Warner Bros./Baltimore Films
 Director:  Dean Parisot
 Writer:  Vince Gilligan
 Cast: Drew Barrymore, Catherine O'Hara, Luke Wilson, Jake
Busey, Shelley Duvall</PRE>
<P>   The difference between an idiotic comedy like "The
Waterboy" and a silly comedy (disguised as a quirky one) like
"Home Fries" is that Adam Sandler and his colleagues
seemed to be having a ball during the filming.  The
performers in "Home Fries" go through the motions just this
side of embarrassment in a work that tries to emulate the
style of the Coen Brothers but possesses scarcely an
smidgen of originality.  The laughs that scripter Vince Gilligan
must have hoped to get from his 10-year-old screenplay are
purportedly the old chestnuts like spoofing the awkwardness
of the male gender when dealing with impending childbirth
and of the females by showing how they coax the men into
doing the nuttiest things.  Mother-son sallies complete the
formula in a movie that would not have seen the light of day
had not Mr. Gilligan become famous as one of the key writers
of "The X-Files" series.  Its one saving feature is the
presence of the cupie-doll cute Drew Barrymore in the role of
a very pregnant burger-flipper in a small-town fast-food stand
who is assigned to the auto take-out section to keep her
lower body hidden from the customers.   </P>
<P>   Barrymore has just concluded an affair with a Henry Lever
(Chris Ellis), a married man about twice her age whose only
possible appeal to the smooth-skinned young redhead is that
he's the only man in the southwestern backwater who lives in
a house rather than a trailer or a wooden shack.  Filmed in a
Texas hamlet thirty miles from the capital of Austin, "Home
Fries" almost takes wings when Dorian (Luke Wilson) and
Augus (Jake Busey), two young stepsons of Henry Lever, fly
over their stepdad's car in a chopper aiming the scare him
out of his affair.  Instead, Lever falls dead from a heart attack
but Lever's widow (Catherine O'Hara) is more relieved that
the affair is finally over than she is about her husband's
demise.  </P>
<P>   Believing that burger-flipper Sally (Drew Barrymore)
overheard their helicopter-based conversation in her headset,
Angus convinces Dorian to take a job in the Burger-Matic
stand to learn more about what Sally knows about the killing.
Though Angus, who has an overly close relationship with his
young mom, wants to eliminate Sally just to make sure that
Mrs. Lever is safe, his brother Dorian has fallen in love with
the precious little pregnant package and considers proposing. 
His differences with his brother and his mom serve as a
setup for farcical actions, and "Home Fries" moves ahead on
a conventional level, painting by the number in as formulaic a
manner as the clowning employees in Burger-Matic apply the
pickles, onions, bun, burger and sauce.</P>
<P>   The movie makes about as much sense as Vince Gilligan's
"The X-Files."  Would these two fellows in their mid-twenties,
test pilots for the armed forces from the looks of things, be
living their mother, one of them willing to eliminate the
woman's nemesis with extreme prejudice?  As the diabolic,
self-centered mother, Catherine O'Hara looks good--about ten
years older than her sons--but director Dean Parisot fails to
evoke genuine nastiness from her image.  While the
borderline-psychotic Angus does indeed convince the
audience of his effect on the flustered Dorian, the film simply
sinks, lacking humor, its self-indulgent characters coming
across as vapid rather than convincingly odious, its situations
lackluster.</P>
