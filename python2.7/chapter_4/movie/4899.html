<P>     LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY, the American name given to Herve Palud's 
1995 French fish-out-of-water comedy, L'INDIAN DANS LA VILLE, is easily 
one of the most tedious viewing experiences of 1996.  I came as close to 
walking out of this movie as anything I have ever watched.  No one, no 
matter how desperate they are for family entertainment, should be 
subjected to the indignity of sitting through this ninety-minute excuse 
for a motion picture.</P>
<P>     LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY seems to take equal parts "inspiration" 
(and I use that word very loosely) from Francois Truffaut's 1970 
feature, THE WILD CHILD, and Paul Hogan's CROCODILE DUNDEE.  However, 
while Truffaut's movie was thoughtful and Hogan's was fanciful, Palud's 
is just plain moronic.  The script is kindergarten level, the 
protagonists are irritating caricatures, the acting is nonexistent, and 
the editing is embarrassingly haphazard.  </P>
<P>     Thierry Lhermitte plays Stephan, a workaholic stock broker who's 
trying to obtain divorce papers from his wife, Patricia (Miou-Miou), so 
he can marry his current girlfriend, space cadet Charlotte (Arielle 
Dombasle).  Thirteen years ago, Patricia left Stephan for the deepest 
reaches of Venezuela's rain forest, so Stephan goes searching there.  
Eventually, he finds her, but she's not alone.  She has a son, Mimi-Siku 
(Ludwig Briand), who also happens to be Stephan's.  Through a series of 
contrivances too silly to explain, Mimi-Siku ends up in Paris, where he 
impresses Dad by shooting arrows into pigeons, setting his pet tarantula 
loose in Stephan's apartment, roaming the streets half-naked, and 
climbing the Eiffel Tower.</P>
<P>     LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY is one of those comedies that's almost 
never funny.  The single amusing sequence takes place inside a carnival 
haunted house, where Mimi-Siku mistakes costumed workers for real 
threats.  It's worth about two chuckles.  Other than that, however, the 
humor is consistently lame.  Are we supposed to laugh when the jungle 
boy offers his father monkey guts?  Or when he roasts tropical fish over 
an open fire?  Or when he chows down on cat food?  And those are the 
high points.  As for the feeble attempts at father/son bonding... this 
is the kind of formulaic regurgitation that makes GETTING EVEN WITH DAD 
look good by comparison.</P>
<P>     Hollywood is often condemned as the chief producer of bad family 
films, but rarely does an American studio come up with something this 
unwatchable.  For some reason, LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY was a big hit in 
its native country, so Touchstone Pictures purchased the U.S. rights, 
dubbed the voices into English (complete with the expected poor 
synchronization of lip movements with words), and distributed prints to 
multiplexes.  Some might argue that LITTLE INDIAN, BIG CITY would have 
worked better with subtitles.  I doubt that.  No matter what language 
the movie is in, the operative word for it is mal. </P>
