<PRE>Les Miserables  (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>Opening May 1, "Les Miserables" beats the handfuls of summer films.  It 
sprawls across the screen, inviting the viewer into the expansive French 
countryside.  Even larger are the themes, which are portrayed without 
condescension.  </P>
<P>Liam Neeson dominates the screen.  His Jean Valjean is a lout who 
clobbers a good-hearted bishop, a man who forgives Jean without 
hesitation, who ransoms (what a good word!) Jean's soul from evil and 
darkness.  For the rest of the film Jean returns this gift of redemption 
to other characters.  His relentless kindness never clogs up the plot 
with sentimentality;  Neeson allows us to accept Jean's selflessness 
without question.  Dynamically changed from the brute who became 
animal-like after 19 years of imprisonment, he hardly seems like a 
dynamic character.  Indeed his decency during the two eras into which 
the film leaps seems static, a miraculous given.</P>
<P>Uma Thurman never looked so bad.  As Fantine, eyes bugged and gums 
bloodied, she commands our sympathy completely.  Of course Victor Hugo 
created a cliché with Fantine's character, but Thurman delivers an 
understated resignation that permits us to imagine the depth of her 
sadness.  Inspector Javert's purposeful destruction of Fantine is his 
most despicable act.  Geoffrey Rush, who took the Academy Award for Best 
Actor for "Shine," brings a wonderful, transparent methodology to his 
acting.  His Javert carries out the law whenever he is onscreen, 
passionately but quietly:  and Rush's lankiness is perfect for the 
sternness demanded by the role.</P>
<P>Claire Danes gives us a believable Cosette.  Reacting with 
understandable puzzlement and determination, she alternates between the 
loyal daughterof Jean and the cunning lover of Marius.  Danes is 
wide-eyed and pleasant to look upon, but when her chin quivers with 
emotion -- as it does in "Romeo + Juliet" and "Little Women," -- we are 
reminded of Stallone's sneer or Clooney's downcast glances;  it becomes 
a trademark tic.  </P>
<P>It is admirable that director Bille August has cut Hugo's 1200 page 
novel down to a film of just two hours fifteen minutes.  This remake of 
"Les Miserables" is stronger than the recent "Man in the Iron Mask";  
the narrative builds a watchable momentum, scene by scene appalling or 
satisfying our sense of humanity.  But there is too much that is quiet.  
I was not expecting an epic with "Braveheart"-style battle scenes;  the 
ones shot in the old streets of the Czech Republic are fine.  But a 
greater amount of old-fashioned character development would let us know 
Marius better;  would tell us more about Javert's obsession with the 
law;  would, in the form of flashbacks, let us see Jean in prison or 
Fantine with her daughter, before their separation.  The story stands 
just on the strength of Hugo's thick plot.  But at least fifteen more 
minutes before the eyes would give the work the pleasant heft of the 
novel carried under the arm.</P>
