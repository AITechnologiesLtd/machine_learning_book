<P>The X-Files taught us that alien colonization won't be loud like
Independence Day, but insipient, like Body Snatchers, Puppet Masters, all
that. More They Live than War of the the Worlds. The trailer establishes all
this with minimal effort, too, as it's already conventional knowledge. And
we are hungry for it, or something like it. It's been two summers now since
Contact made the aliens benevolent, paternal, essentially erasing the
(ir-)rational fear of the Alien series. Which is to say it's high time to
give those aliens fangs again. The Astronaut's Wife does just that.
Or, to be more specific, it gives NASA pilot Spencer Armacost ('Texan'
Johnny Depp, a long way from 21 Jumpstreet, bit closer to Elm) fangs, via a
low-orbit close encounter. And of course no one can see those fangs for most
of the movie. His wife Jillian (Charlize Thiron) has her suspicions, but,
luckily for Spencer, Jillian is an ex-mental patient, so is thus easy to
convince that it's all hallucination and paranoia brought on by her
pregnancy. And there's even the suggestion that it might all just be
paranoia. But then there wouldn't be any special effects. To writer/director
Rand Ravich's credit, however, he is able to milk a lot of tension from an
otherwise subdued movie by keeping the range of Spencer's suprahuman
abilities more or less under wraps until the closing frames, a bit of
dramatically-effective concealment.
But Spencer's not the title-character here. Jillian is. Along with their
marriage, which is so ideal for the first few minutes that it has to be
doomed ('unmade in heaven'). This is something of a non-traditional
approach, though, putting the wife--the ostensible victim here--in the
leading role. Typically, it's the alien's pursuer who gets the screentime,
which gives the movie license to use all the cop/criminal conventions in
space etc, but The Astronaut's Wife isn't Predator, is a bit more low-key
than that. Which is to say it has to rely on a whole nother set of
conventions. Specifically, those Polanski hammered out once and for all with
Rosemary's Baby. Chereze Thiron even has a schoolboy Mia Farrow haircut and
a husband who spends his days at the office. And everyone who shares her
suspicions is summarily removed. It's all about isolation. The only
difference is that instead of giving birth to the supernatural, Jillian may
be giving birth to the extraterrestrial. Not the 2001 kind of
extraterrestrial, though, but something less the benign-infant, more our
replacement. Again, it's how aliens get a terrestrial foothold:
hybridization. And don't think Starman here. Think Species.
Jillian does. But too, she has a little more of that final-girl resolve than
Rosemary did. Very Jamie Lee Curtis, except instead of intense action and
longindying screams we get intense dialogue and longindying stares. Which is
a bit of a change. The stand-off as opposed to the shoot-em-up. This is a
drama, after all, nevermind the alien overtones. It's about trust in
marriage, what the breakover point is. What will convince Jillian she's not
losing it, that Spencer is in fact listening to the coded-static radio
transmissions we know from Contact, Arrival. And it's all fairly strong up
until then, until her convincing. And then, inside of two minutes, it simply
falls apart, uses the same cheap trick Fallen used to 'surprise' us in the
closing frames. And the thing is, there was such a better ending within
reach. In all The Thing incarnations there's always the distinct possibility
early on that these people have just been cooped up too long. Instead of
expanding on that, using it for the ending, The Astronaut's Wife takes the
easy way out, the grand way out, the Hollywood way out. Shoots for the
disturbing Twilight Zone ending and doesn't quite make escape velocity, has
to settle for the typical, when it had the potential to be so much more.
