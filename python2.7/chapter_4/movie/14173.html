<PRE>Shine (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>If 'Rain Man' became a concert pianist, he would
be David Helfgott.  "Shine" is the true-life
story of David, taking him from repressed childhood
to demented adulthood.  "Shine" is always interesting
and never drags, but sometimes misses the mark.</P>
<P>David is the only male son of tough-love father
Armin Mueller-Stahl, a Jewish concentration camp
survivor now living in Australia.  Father succeeds
in making David a child protege, but is reluctant
to give up control over him.  As David matures,
he develops greater psychological problems, with
the blame blatantly placed on his father.  David's
growing success as a pianist is wrecked by a
nervous breakdown, and he ends up institutionalized.
But he gradually recovers, and there is a happy
if unlikely ending.</P>
<P>Three actors play David.  Alex Rafalowicz is
child protege David, timid and polite.  Noah
Taylor is adolescent David, awkward and self-effacing.
Geoffrey Rush is middle-aged David, jabbering,
joyous and oblivious.  The Taylor and Rush versions
of David appear to have nothing in common except
their skill with a piano.</P>
<P>"Shine" is a good movie, but it has been over-rated.
I have several explanations for this.  The addition
of John Gielgud and Lynn Redgrave in minor roles
adds class to the cast, as does the extensive
use of (and references to) classical music.  Also,
the notion of an 'idiot savant' is appealing, a man
who can't tie his shoes or carry a conversation, but
who has some redeeming, extraordinary talent.  Give
David a piano and he's the life of the party.  Take
it away, and it's back to the funny farm.</P>
<P>Rush won the Academy Award for Best Actor, while
Mueller-Stahl was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.
Both give excellent performances, but I can't say
the same for their characters.  Demented David
always charms and never alienates, while his father
has psychological problems that rival his son's.
It just seems too easy to put all the blame for
David's dementia on his abusive father.</P>
