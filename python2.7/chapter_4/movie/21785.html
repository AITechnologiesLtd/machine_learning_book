<P>Synopsis:  Investigator Ichabod Crane journeys to 1799 Sleepy Hollow to 
investigate a series of murders involving decapitation.  Townspeople 
believe the spirit of a dead German mercenary is threatening them.  Cute 
blonde Katrina and a listless orphan help Crane solve the mystery. </P>
<P>Comments:  Tim Burton has directed a number of entertaining and 
groundbreaking films over the years.  BATMAN, of course, is perhaps his 
best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels.  He's 
done biographical work (on the director ED WOOD), children's movies 
(NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS), and a homage to alien invasion movies 
(MARS ATTACKS!).  SLEEPY HOLLOW, his newest feature which fans have been 
anticipating for a while, shares the similar dark and atmospheric style 
of his earlier work and counts among his better movies. </P>
<P>SLEEPY HOLLOW quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period 
horror films of the 1950s and 1960s, especially Hammer Studios' 
reworkings of DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, and American International's 
series of movies based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe.  Christopher 
Lee, in fact, star of many Hammer productions over the years, appears at 
the beginning of SLEEPY HOLLOW as a judge who sends Ichabod Crane out to 
investigate the murders.  The movie also borrows from the Universal 
monster movies of the 1930s.  One of the climatic scenes involves a 
windmill and obviously takes its cue from FRANKENSTEIN. </P>
<P>I mention these allusions for a reason.  Seasoned horror film fans, 
including myself, will smile at their inclusion in this film.  With the 
recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies, 
especially THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (the most overblown turkey of the 
decade), we needed a film like this.  Not only does it have a sense of 
history, but Burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an 
entertaining exercise in horror.  The film's eerie landscapes and foggy 
towns, indeed, overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy 
aspect of the movie. </P>
<P>Johnny Depp, a veteran Tim Burton actor who has appeared both in ED WOOD 
and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, plays Ichabod Crane, who has apparently changed 
occupations from Irving's original story and is now an investigator.  
Depp is adequate in his role.  No more; no less.  Equally adequate is 
Christina Ricci, who plays the love interest in the film.  She's a good 
witch too.  How cute.  One of the few weak parts of SLEEPY HOLLOW is the 
wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters.  The two 
actors, however, carry the movie well enough, but the supporting cast is 
what makes this movie shine.  Veteran actors such as Jeffrey Jones and 
Michael Gough (who played the butler Alfred in all four recent BATMAN 
flicks) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy 
which Depp uncovers.  While I do not wish to reveal crucial plot points, 
I can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing.  You have to pay 
attention.  Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the screenplay.  He's the one who 
also wrote 8 MM and SEVEN.  Walker is quickly becoming one of the 
premiere suspense writers in Hollywood, and SLEEPY HOLLOW certainly 
doesn't hurt his growing reputation. </P>
<P>As one might imagine from a gentleman like Walker, SLEEPY HOLLOW is 
quite graphic.  There's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings.  This is 
definately not a flick to take the young kids to.  A lady in front of us 
took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes 
covering the youngest's eyes with her hand.  He was obviously upset by 
the movie's intense violence.  If you're looking for a good scare, 
however, SLEEPY HOLLOW is definately recommended. </P>
