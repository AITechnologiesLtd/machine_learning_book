<PRE>"Scream" (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>When I first heard about Scream in 1996, I was told that it was a spoof of
horror movies. From the master of the horror himself, Wes Craven, it ridiculed
the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them, by making the teenagers do
what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them
(don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door, never say
"I'll be right back," etc.). When I first heard this description, I figured
that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie. How hard is it to make an
extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies.
Was this Wes Craven's remedy from making "real" bad movies such as Vampires in
Brooklyn? It just seemed cheap to me. </P>
<P>Then I actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes, involving Drew
Barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation, completely changed my
attitude. Scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick,
it's also a pretty scary movie. If you've seen a million of these kinds of
films, you know exactly what is going to happen. This is part of the fun of
watching Scream. The movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive
the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to
watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent, attractive teenagers. To
those who rarely see these types of movies, Scream is a thrilling unpredictable
ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film. There's nothing wrong
with that misjudgment though. I have witnessed viewers from both sides of the
audience, the newbies to horror and the fanatics. Their opinions on the film
were so different but both very positive. From these varied reviews, I am
convinced that Scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal
teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other
categories. Films that both deride and celebrate genres like Galaxy Quest and
The Big Hit would not have existed, in my opinion, if it was not for the
outstanding success of Scream. The low - budget 1996 gem may, alongside Pulp
Fiction, be the most influential film of the 1990's. This influence may exist
to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like Teaching Mrs. Tingle
or television programs such as Dawson's Creek but to others such as myself, we
congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors,
screenwriters, and directors. </P>
<P>Scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by
Kevin Williamson. Within the film are characters who tell other characters, as
well as the audience, the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie. Mainly
from the rants of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Stu (Matthew Lillard), we are
reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more
subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well (the virgin
always survives; have sex and you're dead meat). Not only are we treated these
rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different
films and actors. The script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film
geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every
little film for his own self-satisfaction.  In this case, Williamson finds
these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement. I hear there is a
new movie coming out called Scary Movie which is a spoof of Scream, which is a
spoof of scary movies. I will certainly see the film but I have the feeling
that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than
Scream's perfect subtlety. However my last gut feeling about this stuff,
Scream, was dead wrong... so who knows.</P>
