                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     It's six years after the first LOOK WHO'S TALKING, and Mikey and
his little sister Julie are old enough to speak with their own voices,
which means no more wisecracks--at least not from them.  This time
around, the plot centers on the two dogs adopted by the family:  Rocks
(voice of Danny DeVito), a toughened street mongrel, and Daphne (voice
of Diane Keaton), a pure bred show dog.  With Christmas fast
approaching, Molly (Kirstie Alley) has lost her job, so her husband
James (John Travolta) must work extra hard to impress his new boss
Samantha (Lysette Anthony) in order to maintain financial solvency.
Little does the unsuspecting James realize that he was hired for more
than his ability to pilot airplanes.</P>
<P>     In the case of the LOOK WHO'S TALKING films, the third time
definitely isn't a charm.  There are few enough ideas that can support
a sequel, not to mention two, and LOOK WHO'S TALKING isn't among that
select group.  Yes, the original entry was clever, occasionally funny,
and worth a look--at least on video.  LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO, however,
was downright awful.  Number three in the series isn't worse than its
immediate predecessor (thankfully), but it's not better either.  My
sincere hope is that this flat, lifeless excuse for family
entertainment will put an end to these pictures for good.</P>
<P>     Once upon a time, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley managed to work
well together.  Their chemistry was never perfect, but it was good
enough to suit a light comedy.  Two films later, whatever they once had
is gone.  If James and Molly are still in love, you can't tell it from
the performances.  Talk about actors on auto-pilot!  The dogs generate
more PG-rated heat than these two stiffs.</P>
<P>     The entire acting scene isn't bleak, though.  Lysette Anthony is
suitably vampish as the man-eating mega-corporate exec who sets her
sights on James (why she chooses him is a mystery, but I guess there's
no accounting for taste).  The role isn't much of a challenge, but Ms.
Anthony is never boring.  Also, little Tabitha Lupien is tremendously
cute as Julie, and does a good job outacting everyone older than her.</P>
<P>     By now, the one-liners and juvenile humor have become worn out.
Even the little kids in the audience didn't appear to be enjoying
themselves--and this is aimed at them.  The few "adult" double
entendres are so obvious that no one who understands them is likely to
do more than smirk.</P>
<P>     There are two specific moments in this movie worth mentioning.
The first is the opening shot--a no-cuts scene of well-choreographed
bedtime mass confusion that runs on for about five minutes.  The second
is an in-joke for those who remember that Ms.  Alley originated the
role of the half-Vulcan Lt. Saavik in STAR TREK II.  Here, donning the
pointy ears as one of Santa's helpers, she informs an annoying patron
that she's quite willing to demonstrate the "Vulcan death grip."</P>
<P>     As you can tell from these "high points," this film is sorely
lacking in reasons why anyone of sound mind would want to watch it.
Even Charles Barkley's big-screen acting debut can't camouflage a
wandering script built on formulas and cliches.  As for John Travolta
and Kirstie Alley, suffice it to say that their pets steal every scene,
and when the dogs aren't present, then the furniture takes the honor.
LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW has about as much appeal as the pile that Rocks
leaves on the back seat of James' cab.</P>
