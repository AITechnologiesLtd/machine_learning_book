<PRE>East-West (Est-Ouest)
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer</PRE>
<P>Director:  Régis Wargnier
Producer:  Yves Marmion
Screenwriter: Roustam Ibraguimbek, Serguei Bodrov, Louis Gardel, Régis
Wargnier
Stars: Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov, Serguei Bodrov, Jr., Catherine
Deneuve
MPAA Rating: PG-13
Year of Release: 1998 in France, 2000 in USA</P>
<P>Academy Award-winning director Régis Wargnier (Indochine, A French
Woman, Lumiere and Company) returns to the Oscar-caliber arena with this
multilingual period drama about a family lured back to Stalinist Russia
under a false promise of amnesty. Wargnier's nomination for East-West is
certainly deserved.</P>
<P>Russian emigrants Alexei (Oleg Menchikov-Barber of Siberia, The Kiss)
and Marie Golovine (Sandrine Bonnaire-Circle of Passion, Les Innocents)
receive a disappointing welcome when they step off the boat in Odessa
with their young son, Serioja (played by Ruben Tapiero and Erwan
Baynaud). But, because of Alexei's medical skills, the family is spared
execution and shipped off to Kiev to share meager quarters with a
household of alcoholic miscreants-including a strapping young swimmer
named Sacha (Serguei Bodrov, Jr.) Wracked with guilt over the
miscalculation that has landed his family in captivity, Alexei struggles
to protect his foreign-born wife while avoiding the scrutiny of a
fear-ridden polity. Hope stirs when French actress Gabrielle Develay
(Catherine Deneuve-Indochine, The Hunger, The Last Metro, Belle de Jour)
comes to perform in the local theater.</P>
<P>Tensions plague the Golovine family, from within as well as without.
Alexei, estranged from his wife, begins an affair with their building
superintendent, Olga (Tatiana Doguileva) and Marie turns to the young
Sacha for solace. There's nothing sexy here, however. Just lonely,
desperate people clinging to each other in the dark.</P>
<P>This film is beautifully constructed, with enough emotionally potent
material to keep you in your seat, even if you've had to pee since
curtain. Bonnaire is devastating in her desperation and Oleg Menchikov's
stony-faced coldness is wonderfully unnerving. Catherine Deneuve's
performance as Gabrielle is a smoldering delight, though she only
appears on screen a few times during the film. Despite some appallingly
flat portrayals of Soviet officials that harken back to bad Cold War
stereotypes, the movement of this film is upsetting and delivering;
worthy of the Oscar nomination, if not the Oscar itself.</P>
<PRE>Five stars</PRE>
