<PRE>                              DEAD MAN WALKING
                       A film review by Michael J. Zwirn
                        Copyright 1996 Michael J. Zwirn</PRE>
<P>I saw Dead Man Walking this past week at the Mall of America. This is
an adaptation of a book by Sister Helen Prejean of New Orleans,
relating her work with two death row inmates in Angola Prison in
Louisiana.</P>
<P>It's not hard to give away much of the plot for this story, simply because
there isn't much of one. That's not a criticism; this film is a fine
character portrayal that offers Susan Sarandon as Sister Helen and Sean
Penn as a condemned inmate the chance to develop strong and
three-dimensional subjects. The point isn't to develop a convoluted
plot but to create the human element of a painful and ambiguous true
story.</P>
<P>Superficially, this plot could be described as a prison drama with Penn
attempting to escape his imminent execution by whatever means possible
with Sister Helen's help. That would be misleading. Really, there's no
doubt that Penn is not only culpable, but a deeply flawed human being
who will not admit his own complicity but is quick to blame the faults
of others -- blacks, lawyers, police, his accomplice, anyone. As his
execution nears the inescapability of his situation becomes more clear,
Sister Helen's motivation changes from achieving a temporal reprieve
for Penn to helping him to achieve an eternal spiritual reconciliation with 
him soul and God. </P>
<P>Particularly strong points in the film-making were the portrayal of
Sister Helen's developing friendship with Penn, through the bars or
windows of the prison (the two cannot touch one another until Penn is
on his way to the execution room), the acting of the supporting
characters representing the families of the murder victims, and the
soundtrack, which deserves special praise. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and
Eddie Vedder of all people duet on the haunting music during the
climactic final scene, during which the execution is quickcut with the
murders (which are seen only in flashback). Other artists on the score
include Springsteen, Suzanne Vega, Lyle Lovett and Michelle Shocked,
who is reemerging from an extended exile from recording.</P>
<P>There are some weak points in the story -- Would a murderer appealing
his death sentence really praise Hitler in a TV interview? And must we
be bombarded with images of the malliciousness and hypocrisy of the
government and the prison authorities, if the larger point of the movie
is to demonstrate the acceptance of personal responsibility for one's
actions? But this is a very strong movie which will certainly get Oscar
nominations for both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon, and deservedly so.
It's the best work Penn has ever done and Sarandon is better than
usual. Especially praiseworthy in this film is the deliberate ambiguity
of the filmmakers on the volatile issue of the death penalty -- there
is no one-sided propagandizing on the question, and both the accused
and the victims' families make stng cases. Also notable is the
portrayal of a representative of the Church as a real human being
rather than a figurehead for a larger institution.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5.</PRE>
