<P>Roberto Benigni is the modern-day Chaplin - quixotic, energetic and clownish.
He's always surrounded by societal misfits and higher-ups who want no part of
him, yet Benigni always finds a way to immerse himself in their company and
conform to society's expectations, all the while still remaining buffoonish.
"Life is Beautiful" is his latest film as writer-director, but this time he's
confronted by a deeper reality - the Holocaust. </P>
<P>Benigni stars as Guido, a Jewish-Italian buffoon who continually runs into a
pretty schoolteacher (Nicoletta Braschi), whom he desperately longs for. The
first time, he confronts her at a farm where he makes off with some eggs. Then
he makes a merry trip to one of the picturesque villages of Tuscany, seeking
employment as a waiter and living with his uncle. </P>
<P>Of course, he keeps running into the schoolteacher, who admires his
persistence. In one incredibly riotous scene, Guido impersonates an official
who is to lecture a class about races. Guido makes such a spectacle of himself
by undressing in front of the class and making observations about racism that
practically had me falling out of my seat laughing. Guido finally wins the
teacher's heart, and they get married, have a son, and run their own bookstore.</P>
<P>During the last hour of the film, Guido and his son are captured by the Nazis
and taken to a concentration camp. It is here where Guido tries to convince his
son that it is all a game, a contest played by military-style officials where
the grand prize is a real tank! </P>
<P>The first hour of "Life is Beautiful" is sweet and comical, among Benigni's
finest moments on screen. It is on par with the rampant silliness of "Johnny
Stecchino." The second half is not as ingenious, and I think mainly because
Benigni chose a subject that is difficult to take on any comic level. </P>
<P>The notion is that Guido tries to shelter his son from the horrors of the Nazi
death camps by accentuating that it is all a game, a farce that can be reckoned
with. In doing so, Benigni has removed all the inhumanity and horror from the
Holocaust - he turns it into another one of Guido's comical pranks. </P>
<P>Some of it is successful - I like the scene where Guido serves as translator
for a German commandant who explains what the duties of the prisoners are in
the camps. There is also a brief moment where Guido sees a mountainous hill of
corpses, all photographed as if they were a glass painting. </P>
<P>By the end of the film, though, the theme of survival and sacrifice is lost
when we don't really see what was lost or gained from the experience. It
doesn't help that the camps and their surroundings are photographed in the same
colorful, picturesque quality as the Tuscan village scenes. </P>
<P>"Life is Beautiful" is a paradox in theory - it presents the Holocaust as a
fairytale, and expects us to laugh along with Guido. If we had seen it from
Guido's son's point-of-view, the comical scenes would have worked better. His
son surely would have had his own wild-eyed view of one of the century's
greatest atrocities. And the last scene of the American tank arriving at the
camps reeks of Spielbergian sentiment. </P>
<P>In general, "Life is Beautiful" does so many things right, and is often
wonderful and touching. Benigni is one of the few uncommonly pleasurable actors
in the movies today, and he has agreeable chemistry with his real-life wife
Braschi ("Down By Law"). It was a mistake, though, to transcend the meaning of
the Holocaust by turning it into a farce. </P>
<P>The movie doesn't have the atmosphere or the sardonic pull of the similar Lina
Wertmuller classic, "Seven Beauties," which accepted the reality of the war and
had the superb comic actor Giancarlo Giannini at its center, saving his own
life by sleeping with the commandant. Sure, we all make sacrifices, but
sometimes we need to see what we're making them for. </P>
