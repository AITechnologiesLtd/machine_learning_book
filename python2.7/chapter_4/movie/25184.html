"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Making a film that's a spoof of an entire movie genre is kind of a
strange proposal. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery, and even though Mel Brooks has built a pretty successful
career out of sending up westerns, space adventures and (unfortunately)
vampire flicks, the whole idea of the genre parody doesn't seem much
different than Beavis, Butt-Head, Tom Servo or Crow tearing movies apart
in their living rooms.</P>
<P>But what about a movie that spoofs a movie that spoofed a genre? That's
what we have with Scary Movie, the latest collaboration from the
brothers Wayans. They've already lampooned blaxploitation flicks (I'm
Gonna Git You Sucka!) and gangsta films (Don't Be a Menace to South
Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood), and here they satirize
the Scream trilogy, among other horror films. Even its title is taken
from the one that Scream abandoned.</P>
<P>Scary Movie begins with Carmen Electra (Hyperion Bay) making popcorn and
receiving a phone call from a masked killer, a la Drew Barrymore's
memorable opening scene in the first Scream picture. The story is more
than a little familiar – knife-wielding lunatic begins slashing his way
through a small clique of friends and is pursued by a soulless news
reporter (Cheri Oteri, Saturday Night Live) and a retarded deputy (Dave
Sheridan, MTV's short-lived Buzzkill). Even the school principal is
played by a down-and-out ‘70s television sitcom star (Henry `The Fonz'
Winkler in Scream, and David `Squiggy' Lander here).</P>
<P>It isn't long before Scary Movie moves from Scream to I Know What You
Did Last Summer. After a funny automobile accident involving oral sex
and a beehive (don't ask) that occurred exactly one year ago, the band
of boobs starts receiving notes that threaten to expose their big
secret. While they're at it, the Wayans also toss in a scene right from
Dawson's Creek, a show that was created by Scream and IKWYDLS
screenwriter Kevin Williamson.</P>
<P>There isn't really too much else to say about Scary Movie without giving
away a lot of its gags. Some of the jokes fall flat, but most are direct
hits. In addition to sending up the two recent horror hits, the film
also briefly tackles The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth
Sense. There are also unexpected homages to Amistad and The Usual
Suspects (the latter seemed to go over the head of just about everyone
in the theatre), and a sick, X-rated version of Johnny Depp's death
scene in A Nightmare on Elm Street.</P>
<P>Scary Movie was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (A Lowdown Dirty Shame)
and its script was cobbled together by no less than six screenwriters.
Originally, the film's production was supposed to take just a few weeks
at the end of the summer of 1999 and slated for a fall release. But then
the Wayans' script (originally titled Last Summer I Screamed Because
Halloween Fell On Friday the 13th) merged with a similar project that
spoofed horror pictures (called Scream If You Know What I Did Last
Halloween), and the production was stretched out long enough for the
film to include a parody of the `Wassup' Budweiser commercials.</P>
<P>1:26 - R for strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violence</P>
