<PRE>                           MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Pete Nelson
                        Copyright 1996 Pete Nelson</PRE>
<P>Note: There will be some spoilers in here.</P>
<P>I have a few points to make about this movie.  First of all, it's not
an action movie.  About 90% of the good action sequences in the movie
you've already seen - in the commercials and the previews.  The only
major action sequence is the helicopter scene in the tunnel, and
that's at the end of the movie.  So, if you're looking for a good
action movie, save your dough.</P>
<P>Second, the casting is a bit odd too.  Ving Rhames (Marsellus Wallace
from Pulp Fiction) plays a hacker.  While he's not a bad actor, it's
very hard to picture big, burly tough-guys as hackers.  Also, Emilio
Estevez seems like a promising character, but he is killed off in the
first fifteen minutes of the movie.</P>
<P>Finally, at the end of the movie, I still wasn't sure who the good
guys were and who the bad guys were.  Either the plot-web was too
tangled or I'm just not very good at figuring these things out.</P>
<P>A couple pieces of trivia I saw in the movie:  While it's never used,
Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) alias is Phillip Douchette.  Also, John
Voight's character gives away the location of Ethan to the people
looking for him.  He's going to be on a train.  You can see the word
"Voit" on the train ticket.  May mean something else, but it's an odd
coincidence.</P>
<P>To sum up, if you like a good spy-type mystery, you'll probably like
this.  If you're looking for a great action movie, go see Twister.</P>
<PRE>Scale: As my friend said when we left, "A five with an occasional
eight." </PRE>
