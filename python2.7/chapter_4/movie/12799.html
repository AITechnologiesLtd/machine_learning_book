Broadway Damage  1/2* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Aspiring Broadway composer Robert (Aaron Williams) secretly carries a
torch for his best friend, struggling actor Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas).
The problem is, Marc only has eyes for "perfect 10s," which the geeky,
insecure Robert certainly is not.  Meanwhile, Marc's spoiled (hetero)
female roommate, Cynthia (Mara Hobel), spends her days lying about their
apartment and harrassing magazine editor Tina Brown.</P>
<P>Writer-director Victor Mignatti's "very romantic comedy" (as the ad
campaign states) is supposed to be (pardon the pun) a gay ol' romp, but
it's hard to have much fun with these annoying, self-absorbed characters
and their shallow personal problems: Marc and Cynthia have sitcom-level
domestic "crises" (such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious); Robert and
Marc go to acting class (how riveting); the zaftig Cynthia goes on eating
binges (how original).  But more than anything else, the three whine.
Constantly.  Marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent "10,"
David (Hugh Panaro), the hunky musician from across the way; Robert whines
about not being able to find the right guy; Cynthia whines about having to
find a job (horrors).  The terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending
that is wholly undeserved.  Add in overly broad performances and some
laughable lipsynching by Panaro, and you're left with one astonishing piece
of cinematic damage.</P>
