<PRE>                               FALLEN 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               4 :-( :-( :-( :-(  for the angel from hell</PRE>
<P>Cast: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth
Davidtz,  James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas
Director: Gregory Hoblit
Screenplay: Nicholas Kazan</P>
<P>How does one catch a serial killer that is able to possess and transfer
itself from one human host to the next? I'm referring to evil spirits,
also known as fallen angels. In particular one called Azazel, a close
relative of Beezelbub who did so much body hopping during the movie it
gave me a blooming headache!</P>
<P>This movie presumes that serial killers are the way they are because of
possession by evil spirits. These spirits are supposedly able to take
complete control of man, causing them to do wicked things. Can you
imagine the legalities in the law court – ‘Sorry Your Honour, I didn't
mean to murder the boss, my brother, the school teacher or his lover.
It's just that an evil spirit called Azazel made me do it.' Even if evil
spirits did exist, this version is totally unbiblical – taking away any
human responsibility for murder and making it in to some fancy Hollywood
concept for cheap thrills. I don't buy it.</P>
<P>This movie is a poor choice for Denzel Washington, a fine actor and
regular Church-goer. I find it surprising that he would condone such
nonsense – not the fact that spirits exist, but the fact they go body
hopping at a whim, causing good people to do evil things. John Goodman
is a steady co-star in any movie and helps lend a hand to deliver a slow
and thoughtless script. FALLEN is so full of superstitious mumbo-jumbo
that the words ‘Acracadabra' and ‘Open Sesame' should have been regular
quotes. It is a relief to see that Donald Sutherland doesn't play
another sinister bad guy, one of his more recent entrapments.</P>
<P>I have little else pleasant to say about this way over the top rendition
of an over regurgitated serial killer franchise.</P>
