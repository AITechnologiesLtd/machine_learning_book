<PRE>                                       EVITA
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show hosted by
Laura and Robin Clifford, running on Boston Cable TV. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<PRE>EVITA
-----</PRE>
<P>is the long awaited movie version of the 70's Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical starring Madonna as Eva Peron, a small time actress who slept
her way to the top by finally seducing Juan Peron, the dictator of
Argentina, played here by British star of stage and screen, Jonathan
Pryce.  Once established as Argentina's first lady, Eva Peron became a
self-serving champion of the downtrodden masses before succumbing to
cancer at the age of 33.</P>
<P>Directed by Alan Parker, "Evita" is narrated by Antonio Banderas as
cynical everyman Che.</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>"Evita", the movie, has been a long time coming to the big screen, and
has made its journey amidst much controversy, especially the one in
casting Madonna as Eva Peron.</P>
<P>Well, after years in the making, "Evita" has finally made it and it is
not shabby!</P>
<P>Alan Parker brings us a lavish screen production of the 1979 stage
play, with brilliant costume (88 costume changes for Madonna), art
direction, photography and music.</P>
<P>The music is mostly effective, keeping the songs in sync with the
period feel of the film. A couple of electric rock numbers are out of
place with the period and would have best been dropped. Two of the
numbers - "Look Out, Buenos Aires", a flashy and colorful piece, and,
what Laura calls "So Sad When A Love Affair Dies", which chronicles
Eva's efforts to sleep her way to the top - are good examples of how
the music fits the film.</P>
<P>Madonna, as Eva Peron, does a first rate job with the songs, but isnt
an experienced enough actor to use non-lyric expressions to convey
emotions. It makes me wonder what would have happened if Meryll
Streep, a much more accomplished actor, were cast as Eva. Madonna is
not that impressive as an actor, despite her entreaties for Academy
recognition.</P>
<P>Antonio Banderas, on the other hand, impressed the hell out of me. He
has a natural singing voice, with a slight gravelly quality, that
lends to his role as the everyman narrator, Che. His presence as both
actor and character help to make him the best thing in "Evita".</P>
<P>Jonathan Pryce, as Juan Peron, does not really have much to do but be
a figurehead character. His singing is fine.</P>
<P>My problem with the film, and the thing that hampers it from being
better, is that there is little attempt to educate the viewer about
the Argentine politics of the period and Eva's place in that world.
There's more shadow than substance to the story. Mainly, the film
tells me that Eva Peron was little more than a conniving opportunist -
not the image I would expect the filmmakers want to put forth. </P>
<P>A particularly favorite lyric from one of the film's songs, which sums
up Eva Peron, is "The people, they need to adore me. So, Christian
Dior me." It gave me a hearty chuckle.</P>
<P>I think its funny that I rate "Evita" the same as I do "Beavis and
Butt-head Do America". I give "Evita" a B.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Alan Parker has co-produced, co-written (with Oliver Stone) and
directed a lavish musical film version of the smash stage musical
"Evita."  The 15 history of this coming to the screen approaches the
story of the casting for "Gone With the Wind," with the likes of Meryl
Streep vying for the role of Evita and directors such as Ken Russell,
Francis Coppola, Michael Cimino and Oliver Stone attached to the
project.  Parker ignored the play's screenplay and went back to the
original concept album's score and lyrics (which preceded the actual
stage production) along with historical research in order to write his
film's screenplay.</P>
<P>The film looks great.  It was shot on location in Argentina, England
and Hungary.  The "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" scene was filmed at
the actual balcony of the Casa Rosada, where Eva Peron addressed the
people.  The art direction and costume very successfully evoke the
1920s and 1940s periods that the film takes place during.
Cinematographer Darius Khondji ("Seven," "Delicatessen," "The City of
Lost Children") also lends an appropriate period glow to the film.</P>
<P>"Evita" is told entirely by musical numbers (with the exception of a
very few spoken lines by minor characters).  Madonna (who passionately
fought for this role) does a fine job - at times I even forgot it was
Madonna I was watching, although not entirely.  She's publically
stated that she expects an Oscar nomination for this role.  While
she's good (surprisingly so in a few scenes, such as her death bed
scene), I don't think she's quite up to the competition this year.</P>
<P>The big surprise for me is Antonio Banderas as Che - he sings with
conviction and provides many of the film's laughs with his sly asides
and wry commentary.  Jonathan Pryce (English stage and screen star and
Lexus pitchman) doesn't fair as well as Juan Peron - his character is
never fully realized and I never understood his motivations.  At one
point in the film, we're given the indication that by the time he
marries Eva, the romance has been entirely replaced by politics.
Later, he stands up for her against political adversaries.  How did he
feel about her?  This film remains vague on that subject. </P>
<P>There are some terrific musical numbers, smartly choreographed.  A lot
of history is covered as Eva begins sleeping her way to the top,
dumping each lover with the refrain "isn't it sad when a love affair
dies" while Che steps in and informs the dumpee that he's been had in
particularly colorful ways.  The seduction duet between Madonna and
Jonathan Pryce ("I Could Be Good for You") is very effective and one
of Pryce's best scenes.  The rousing "New Argentina," a number which
was cut from the stage production, attempts to fill in some of the
political history of the time.  As Madonna remakes herself as the
first lady she sings "the people adore me, so Christian Dior me!" as
we're presented with a montage of costume and makeup tryouts.  There's
also a nice fantasy sequence where Madonna tangos with Banderas as she
counters his everyman's accusations of how she's ultimately let her
people down. </P>
<P>"Evita" isn't entirely successful, however.  It's opening sequence,
where we're presented with Eva's funeral cut back and forth with the
7-year old Eva attempting to attend her father's funeral (she was
illegitimate and refused entry) is a bit confused.  The film also gets
very repititve in its last half hour - a judicious trimming of 10-15
minutes would have tightened the film considerably.  The film also
fails in its depth.  As I already mentioned, Juan Peron isn't well
fleshed out and we're never entirely sure of Eva's sincerity either -
the filmmakers show both angles but never attempt to come to a
conclusion.</P>
