<PRE>                           LOST IN SPACE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                 3 :-) :-) :-)  for the Robinson Family</PRE>
<P>Cast: Gary Oldman, William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Matt LeBlanc, Heather
Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson, Jared Harris
Director: Stephen Hopkins
Producers: Mark W. Koch, Stephen Hopkins, Akiva Goldsman, Carla Fry
Screenplay: Akiva Goldsman</P>
<P>LOST IN SPACE is as convolutedly, complex as an episode of Star Trek in
its time dimensional best. Action packed enough to keep hormonally
charged pubescents happy and worthwhile enough, for parents to get rid
of the kids for an Easter afternoon break. I'm sitting here, still
trying to work out the in and outs of who went where and when, looking
for who and found what, only to prevent something from happening, so
that they could travel through the centre of a planet to escape it's
gravitational collapse (theoretically not sound). If you're lost in time
and space, so am I, which is why this movie is so aptly titled LOST IN
SPACE.</P>
<P>Imagine giant metallic spiders, battling powerful pet robots controlled
by a highly intelligent, lonely child. Included are evil doctor
saboteurs, a Captain America unlucky in love, computer generalised
monkeys with a great set of lips; a mother in charge, a father
neglecting his children, the family pride, the family misfit - say hello
to the Robinson Family. This story is immersed in state of the art
special effects, fanciful explosions with loud metallic noises
interspersed in between moments of quiet reflection, before another bout
of noise and explosions, screams, numerous amusing one liners and
finally a way home.</P>
<P>This adaptation of the popular 60's sci-fi series is light years ahead
of its predecessor. Gone are the once daggy costumes, the Ed Wood sets
and the corny, soppy dialogue which suited its time. Put your seat belts
on because the 90's version of LOST IN SPACE doesn't give you much time
to contemplate a toilet break. Memorable scenes include still frames of
the family Robinson frozen in mid air whilst gate travelling, Will
Robinson jumping into a pit slow motion and numerous scenes of John West
humiliating himself trying to impress Penny Robinson.</P>
<P>The cast is well chosen. William Hurt is in fine form as the father,
John Robinson. Mimi Rogers is ideal as the down to earth,
speak-your-mind mother, who doesn't take crap from anyone. The evil,
troublesome, meddling, snivelling Dr Smith is portrayed by Gary Oldman,
who has a knack for playing villainous roles. Then there is Matt LeBlanc
of friends, who shamelessly humiliates himself with some of the worst
pick up lines a guy can think off. But I believe the story belongs to
Will Robinson (Jack Johnson), the genius kid with a heart of gold.</P>
<P>Good family entertainment for all members of the family.</P>
