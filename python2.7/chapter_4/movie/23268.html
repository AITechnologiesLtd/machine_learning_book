Review of ANALYZE THIS</P>
<P>Analyze This, starring Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Chazz
Palminteri, Bart Tangredi, Michael Straka, Joseph Rigano, Joe Viterelli,
Richard C. Castellano, Molly Shannon and Max Casella.  Directed by Harold
Ramis.  1999.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll.</PRE>
<P>   After the buddy comedy Rush Hour, with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, Analyze
This was another chance to capitalize on this market.  Directed by Harold
Ramis, Analyze This is able to get similar laughs to Rush Hour, but just like
Rush Hour, Analyze This fails when it strays away from its main duo.</P>
<P>   Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal play the double trouble team of Analyze
This, and I must admit, DeNiro in this type of comedy is very scary.  I was
skeptical, but DeNiro is able to salvage a slightly above average performance,
mainly because of Crystal's amazing comic wit.  The rest of the cast, aside
from Lisa Kudrow and Molly Shannon, are mainly unknown Italian actors, playing
Paul Vitti's (Robert DeNiro) associates.</P>
<P>   Analyze This is a very funny comedy at times.  And at other moments, it is
downright boring.  It starts off very dull by examining the life of Paul Vitti.
 However, a hilarious sequence between psychiatrist Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal)
and one of his patients, Caroline (Molly Shannon), gets Analyze This back on
the right track.  The interaction between DeNiro and Crystal gets downright
hilarious, with DeNiro being able to play upon his tough-guy image and still
get laughs.  Even better, he gets sensitive, and when that happens, Analyze
This becomes a downright laugh-riot.</P>
<P>   Lisa Kudrow never seems to find the right film.  No matter where she goes,
she still reminds everyone of Phoebe, from the popular TV series "Friends." 
Kudrow tries to surmise a new side of her comic mind by playing Ben Sobol's
wife-to-be, Laura MacNamara.  However, her character comes off stale.  She
plays the fiancee of Sobol, and is very upset and Paul Vitti becomes one of his
patients.  The only times when DeNiro and Crystal do not fully function is when
Kudrow gets in the way.</P>
<P>   Director Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, Animal House) adds this
comedy to his already populated list, and while it is definitely not the cream
of the crop, he has had far worst.  Ken Lonergan and Peter Tolan are credited
with the script, and while their interaction of Crystal and DeNiro is flawless,
they fail with Kudrow's character and the mob implication.  Kudrow never gets
any laughs, despite being paired with Crystal and DeNiro, a horrible feat to
say the least.  Also, whenever Vitti's fellow mobsters get involved, laughs are
usually dry.  One exception is Joe Viterelli, who plays Jelly, Paul Vitti's
right-hand man.  Jelly is sorely lacking in on-screen time, but when he does
show up, he always gets a laugh.</P>
<P>   1999 was a great year for comedies.  While Analyze This is not in the range
of Steve Martin's comic masterpiece, Bowfinger, Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro
play off each other perfectly to deliver another solid comedy for everyone to
enjoy.</P>
<P>Final Verdict: B
