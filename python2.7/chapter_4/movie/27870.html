<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A poor imitation of Lubitsch's classic romance/comedy Trouble in
Paradise. Dieterle's Jewel Robbery is adapted from a play by Ladislas
Fodor. Even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences, it was
seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress. It was
a witty Depression eye-pleaser for American audiences who liked to watch
the rich in action, especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels.
These were perceived as victimless crimes, since the jewels were
insured.</P>
<P>Set in Vienna, William Powell plays the dapper jewel robber who bursts
into an exclusive jewelry shop and robs the owner (Kohlmar) at gunpoint
of his entire collection and also robs the customers. One of the
customers is the bored, fun-loving Baroness Teri von Horhenfels (Kay
Francis), whose wealthy husband, Baron Franz von Horhenfels (Henry
Kolker), is in the store buying her a 28 carat diamond (The Excelsior
Diamond).</P>
<P>Teri has just dumped her latest lover, the diplomat friend of her
husband, Paul (Hardie), and is looking for a new lover. She is charmed
by the suave Powell, who robs with class, is handsome and well-spoken.
They flirt with each other during the robbery, which results in everyone
getting locked in the safe, except the foolish security guard Lenz
(Charters), who is suckered into taking the stolen boxes of jewelry out
to Powell's car and smokes the marijuana cigarette Powell gives him, as
he immediately becomes giggly.</P>
<P>The police have been under siege by a number of recent jewelry robberies
and extend every effort to catch the thieves. Powell, before he plans to
retreat to Nice, enters Teri's house, returns the diamond he stole from
her and tempts her to run off with him. She digs the thrill of it, but
is too scared to give up the security of her rich lifestyle, even if she
doesn't love her husband and leads a dull life, not caring about anyone
but herself.</P>
<P>Powell's gang enters her house pretending they are the police and
confiscate all the jewelry from the robbery which Powell planted in her
safe. They take her to Powell's luxurious suburban home as Powell
persuades her to run away with him. When the real police come to raid
the gang's hideaway house, Teri is mulling over Powell's offer of being
with him, but still can't let go of her secure society ties. Powell ties
her up so she won't be thought of as part of the robbery and flees over
the rooftops. As the film concludes, she smugly talks into the camera,
while telling her unsuspecting hubby who is with the cops, that she
plans to go to Nice after this terrible ordeal.</P>
