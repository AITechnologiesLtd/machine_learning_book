<P>When Jim Henson passed away in 1990, many of his fans doubted that the
Muppet franchise would carry on with the same wonder previously seen in some
of the most ingenious outings such as 'The Muppet Movie' (1979), 'The Great
Muppet Caper' (1981) and The Muppets Take Manhattan' (1984).  Steve Whitmire
does an incredible job of performing the voice of Kermit the Frog in the
same unique and memorable fashion of Henson himself.  Frank Oz and Dave
Goelz also contribute greatly to the icon voices of Miss Piggy and Gonzo.
The Muppet franchise seems to have survived but not with the same wonder and
amazement of the early years but its nice to see them try and provide
wholesome and quality entertainment for today's children.</P>
<P>The story of 'Muppets From Space' centres around Gonzo.  He's always been a
unique character and we find out that his roots come from another world and
that he himself is an alien and his people want to come and take him back in
a similar style seen in 'E.T.'  All of your favourite Muppet characters,
including Gonzo, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Rizzo the Rat, and others, all live
together in the same house.  It's a zoo (no pun intended) as they all fight
for bathroom time, a place at the breakfast table and room to movie about.
It's cute and harmless fun that in many cases is meant only for extremely
young children.  Older kids and adults especially may find the entire film
very boring at times and many of the characters aren't given the exposure I
would like to have seen.  That's one thing I always enjoyed about the old
television show.  There would be a segment giving everyone equal time and
everyone received their equal share of the pie.  In this one, you only end
up saying: "There's Fozzy", "There's Beaker", "There's Rolph", but we don't
see enough of them.</P>
<P>As Gonzo is discovered to be an alien, he is captured by a secret government
laboratory who want to experiment on him and it's up to the rest of the
Muppets to rescue him.  The whole thing is done in the most campy style
imaginable.  There is a spray carried by Miss Piggy where she can use it on
anyone and they're hypnotized into doing whatever she says and they all
carry a formula that will make them invisible.  It was nice, however, to see
the adult characters, such as Ray Liotta, Andie McDowall, Jeffrey Tambor, F.
Murray Abraham, Rob Schneider and the laughable Hulk or Hollywood Hogan,
whatever he's called these days, take a back seat to the Muppets and not
over shadow their presence.</P>
<P>Director Tim Hill and writers Jerry Juhl and Joseph Mazzarino have made a
film that looks more like television than the movies but considering that's
where the Muppets roots are, that isn't such a bad thing.  I just wanted to
see a less pretentious climax and more zest this time around that was
missing most of the way.</P>
