<PRE>                              TRAINSPOTTING
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>(UK, 1996)*** Directed by Danny Boyle. Written by John 
Hodge from the novel by Irvine Welsh.Photography, Brian
Tufano. Editing, Masahiro Hirakubo. Production design, Kave Quinn.  
Cast: Ewan McGregor (Renton), Ewen Bremner (Spud), Jonny
Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert
Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Shirley
Henderson (Gail). A Miramax release. 93 minutes. Rated R (everything you 
can imagine in a drug movie). At the Art.</P>
<P>"England and America are two countries divided by a common language."
Never has this been so true as in "Trainspotting," even though the US 
release is said to have been partly or fully redubbed. The film, set 
mostly among low-class to lower-middle class people in Edinburgh's 
suburb of Leith, is not spoken in the often colorful, singsong Scottish 
burr but in a slang that most of us will find from 50 to 75 percent 
impenetrable, although the almost constant voice-over by the main 
character, Mark, is relatively clear. The story, however, does come 
through in its essentials, especially as the younger people who do all 
the talking do not drop literary gems in the process. This is filmmaking 
at the opposite pole of Masterpiece Theatre. </P>
<P>Still, I am sorry I didn't see the picture at the Cannes Festival, where 
it was a most sought-after film among the not competing titles. It was 
subtitled in French, which means that , ironically, a lot more French 
people than Americans have gotten the details of dialogues or 
monologues. There is a short subtitled  stretch in "Trainspotting," but 
that's in a conversation inside a dance-hall where the din is deafening.</P>
<P>The movie is about a group of mostly male friends and co-addicts. Not 
all, however shoot up. If I understood the goings-on correctly, one pal 
is clean, another (the violent Begbie) is addicted to drink. Overall 
though, and no matter what type of addiction, heroin reigns supreme, 
with its grunge, its glum, its filthy rooms populated mostly by syringes 
and needles--plus a baby who is neglected. </P>
<P>But then everything else is neglected. The Big H has taken over, has 
made its victims victimize others (thefts and other crimes) to sustain 
the habit. A familiar story, rendered unfamiliar up to a point by 
merciless, harrowing depictions that have little or none of the 
sentimentality of many other drug movies. </P>
<P>The movie has been a runaway hit in the UK, where it has been repeatedly 
compared to "A Clockwork Orange" and where it has caused controversies 
--one criticism being that it does not condemn drugs.</P>
<P>It does not, indeed, not in a preaching way, but it still is powerfully 
anti-drugs simply by showing what happens to its habituees. On the other 
hand, while it shows, abundantly, the symptoms, it does not go to the 
causes --something far more difficult to do and necessitating much more 
than a mere 93 minutes. There is even a cop-out when Mark says "Who 
needs reasons when you've got heroin?" -- dumb, dead-end reasoning. And 
Mark (or one of the group) comes up with the praise of heroin: "Take the 
best orgasm you ever had, multiply by a thousand, and you're still 
nowhere near." </P>
<P>Reasons, however, are given. They are in the deja vu, 
rebel-without-a-cause tradition. Mark gives us the classic, ironic 
anti-bourgeois-life cause. "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. 
Choose a family. Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental 
insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments." </P>
<P>The film is at its best when portraying the friends, their milieu, their 
drug and sexual adventures (there's an instant pickup of a too-young 
Catholic school girl that flashes right away to sex), and the surrealism 
of their hallucinations. The most notable one is when a  man goes to the 
"Worst Toilet in Scotland," drops in by mistake a couple of capsules, 
then plunges in after them in a nightmarish scene that takes him 
underwater. Next best (?) is when Mark, who has overdosed, is taken to 
Emergency then back to his parents' home, where, in his bed he gets 
frightening shakes, sweats, chills and visions. </P>
<P>After a test for AIDS, he says "I'm the luckiest of men. I'm HIV 
negative in the middle of an epidemic." He then decides to stay clean. 
But wait...
Next, he looks for "something new" which is a respectable job in London. 
Here the movie fails in its intent. There's a rather sudden transition 
to Mark in London, walking about the City in a correct business suit, 
looking like a neat and healthy employee of whatever business it is, and 
saying in voice-over "For the first time in my life I was almost 
content." </P>
<P>The way this was presented is so gauche that I thought it was another 
figment of Mark's imagination --but it was not. Then back in the saddle 
again, Mark and Co. get in n a deal to buy smack from some Russian 
sailors and resell it. They asked for 20,000 pounds, got 16,000. Pretty 
good, and pretty well filmed. So is the testing of the smack by Mark who 
gets hooked again, but, at the end, in a realistic illustration of "No 
honor among thieves"  sneaks away with the wherewithal to be voluntarily 
co-opted by the bourgeois life he had so despised.</P>
<P>There's more to this film than I can reveal but essentially, its 
strength is in the dispassionate way it documents the life of those 
"unfortunates" who, had they been alcoholics instead, I would have 
called them "sediment." There are some injections of humor that may or 
may not work for you.  </P>
<P>Within the plethora of "Addiction of the Month" theatrical and TV 
movies, "Trainspotting" stands as "Addiction of the Year." I wish,for 
comparison, that I had the time to see again a fierce competitor, the 
excellent "Panic in Needle Park" (USA, 1971) by Jerry Schatzberg, Al 
Pacino's second feature and his explosive entrance in the Great Actors 
class.</P>
<P>The movie's cryptic title refers to the British hobby of standing by 
passing trains and collecting the numbers on locomotives. This may be 
taken as an addiction, a useless habit. Stupid perhaps, but at 
least, benign.</P>
