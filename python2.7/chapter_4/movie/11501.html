<P>FALLEN
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **½ (out of ****) 
Warner Bros. / 2:02 / 1998 / R (language, violence)
Cast: Denzel Washington; John Goodman; Embeth Davidtz; Donald Sutherland; James 
Gandolfini; Elias Koteas; Gabriel Casseus; Michael J. Pagan 
Director: Gregory Hoblit 
Screenplay: Nicholas Kazan <HR>In last winter's "The Preacher's Wife," Denzel Washington played a friendly 
angel. In this winter's "Fallen," he plays a cop on the trail of a 
not-so-friendly angel. It's an interesting transition to an interesting film, 
but don't look too hard at "Fallen" or you'll find it has a hard time getting 
up. Injecting a basic thriller plot with some creepy religious themes, the movie 
is quite uneven and a little unsatisfying, yet still manages to somehow be a tad 
better than most of the cinematic releases anchored to January's dumping ground. 
Despite its flaws, "Fallen" covers some nifty ground and boasts a few choice 
moments before its twisted finale results in one too many head-scratches. </P>
<P>As the film opens, Philadelphia homicide detective John Hobbes (Washington) is 
attending the execution of Edgar Reese ("Crash"'s Elias Koteas), a serial killer 
whom he apprehended single-handed. What Hobbes doesn't know is that his 
adversary's murderous motivation has been supplied by the dark, fallen seraph 
that's inhabited his body, making Reese not your typical psychopath. This 
diabolical entity -- called Azazel -- is transferred through human hosts by 
touch, and targets Hobbes as an eventual victim. But Hobbes fights back with the 
help of a pretty theologian (Embeth Davidtz) who's actually related deeper to 
the case than she'd like to admit. Also on hand to cast interdepartmental doubt 
on Hobbes' seemingly out-there actions are his loyal partner (John Goodman) and 
suspicious lieutenant (Donald Sutherland). </P>
<P>It takes a good while for "Fallen" to get moving, but when it does, things 
become quite intriguing. The film, which plays like an occasionally spooky mesh 
of "Seven" and "The Exorcist," boasts an exciting gimmick -- how Azazel can be 
transferred into just about anyone -- that leads to a handful of exciting 
sequences where Washington must cast distrustful eyes on every person in his 
surroundings. Although "Fallen" might leave you with a detached feeling, it's 
hard to not be engrossed with the story's unfolding details. What keeps the 
movie from being solid entertainment, however, is that too much of it remains 
frustratingly ambiguous, like the interaction between Hobbes and his brother and 
nephew. And "Fallen"'s alleged "surprise ending" -- a denouement that Warner 
Bros. issued requests asking the press to not spoil -- should shock no one who 
has been watching attentively. </P>
<P>Washington is his usual sunny, likeable self, which contrasts nicely with the 
movie's cold, grim atmosphere. Other cast members are solid without being used 
terribly well; Davidtz ("Schindler's List"), for example, creates the beginnings 
of an interesting character, but later comes off like walking, talking 
exposition. Still, even if the good guys are an underdeveloped crew, the film 
does manage to make Azazel menacing without the use of a constant actor or even 
special effects aside from some periodic weird point-of-view shots. But "Fallen" 
is nonetheless an uneven film. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of 
Fortune") has traces of a true, terrifying tale in "Fallen" -- what could have 
possibly kept his script so lopsided? Could it be ... Satan? <HR>© 1997 Jamie Peck

Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" -- Roger Ebert on "Look
