<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Many films feature strange and convoluted family relations, but few
show them with the emotional strength and visual presentation of Mike
van Diem's Character.  This is the first picture I've seen of the five
that were nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film
this year; I can't say that this one is better than the others, but I am
certainly not disappointed with its winning of the award.  This is a
strong, bold film, powered by superb central performances from Fedja Van
Huet and Jan Decleir, and by some of the most striking imagery to come
out of any film in the last year.</P>
<P>Character, which takes place in the Netherlands around the 1930s,
revolves around young Katadreuffe (Van Huet), a young man who, at the
beginning of the picture, is seen confronting an aging man who has
apparently worked against him his entire life.  The story then jumps
ahead of time; the older man is dead, and Katadreuffe is being
interrogated by police officers.  The young man then tells his story,
beginning with his birth.  It turns out that the older man, Dreverhaven
(Decleir), is Katadreuffe's father.  Katadreuffe goes on to explain his
life story to the police officers.  </P>
<P>He speaks of his mother, Joba (Betty Schuurman), with whom he did not
get along.  He explains his failed efforts to begin his own business,
and his love for reading the few books he had at his disposal.  When he
is old enough, he goes to work at a law firm, and a lawyer named De
Gankelaar (Victor Low) takes Katadreuffe under his wing.  Katadreuffe is
forced to borrow a large sum of money at one point, and it turns out
that the bank from which he takes the loan is his father's bank.  From
that point on, the two men clash with animosity, and Katadreuffe does
everything that he can to beat his father.</P>
<P>Character tells a deep and immersive story of a complex father/son
relationship, but, on the surface, it's a fascinating and absorbing
film, always interesting to look at and effective as entertainment.  Van
Diem, who also co-wrote, does a fantastic job with direction, and keeps
the pacing swift and smooth throughout the picture.  The production
design, by Rikke Jelier, is interestingly colorless and fantastically
dark; the city streets and building interiors have such an authentic
feel to them that I never once questioned the on-screen image.  Rogier
Stoffers' cinematography is agitated and fascinating to watch; also
splendid is the heavy musical score by Paleis van Boem, full of thick
stringed instruments that fit the mood of the film perfectly.</P>
<P>The acting from the two leading men is superb.  Van Huet is a striking
presence, and plays this character with depth and complexity.  
Katadreuffe is an interesting person to begin with -- dignified,
determined, and extremely intelligent.  Van Huet conveys all of this and
more, layering the performance in brilliant subtleties and nuances
(watch how his demeanor changes in numerous ways depending on his
situation).  Decleir is equally good, but in different ways.  I
sometimes criticize a film for having a one-note villain (I shouldn't
refer to this man as a "villain," actually), but there's more to this
performance than is outwardly noticeable.  He seems like a bad man, but
what he actually does for his son warrants much consideration.  </P>
<P>There is so much to admire about the smooth and complete way that Van
Diem has brought this subject to the screen.  The film relies a lot on
plot and story, but without bogging down the characters in contrivances
and Things that Make you Think Twice.  I like how the story is
character-driven, but still features many interesting turns throughout. 
And, even though the film is inherently sad and has several tragic
moments, Van Diem never sentimentalizes the material.</P>
<P>But there's something profound at the center of Character.  The title
itself explains a lot of what the film is about -- are Dreverhaven's
intentions deeper than they first appear?  I think that they are. 
Viewers must remember that this is a man who has tried hard to be an
influence in his son's life.  He is a stern man -- perhaps he's just
plain mean -- but Van Diem is too smart to make this a character whose
intentions are clear.  Character is a film that never goes beyond its
boundaries -- it's a slick, entertaining, and honest picture about a
relationship so strange that it actually qualifies as realistic.  </P>
