<P>In the last few years, the disaster film has been making a comeback. Last
year we had Independence Day and Twister. Now we have Dante's Peak and
Volcano. Disaster films can be great fun--they can also live up to their
title. For an example of the latter, take Dante's Peak a completely silly
little picture about a volcano. Yep, nobody knows that it is alive, but it
is. It explodes. So, uh, is this movie gonna make sense? No, just watch.
Uh, is it gonna be fun? If you don't think--just watch. But, uh, shouldn't
it require intelligent participation? No, just watch. </P>
<P>Sound like fun? Judge for yourself--I found this movie completely
disrespectful to my intelligence. The special effects were not very good.
It was never convincing. I wanted to, y'know, walk out. After five minutes.
It is truly ludicrous. I don't mind a movie that isn't "deep", but this
movie fails to "entertain".</P>
<P>Now take Volcano, a simple little film that came a few months later. Maybe
they were doing extra filming--don't ask me. How's it compare? Next to
Dante's Peak, it's Citizen Kane. It's exciting and well-edited and makes
the concept of volcanos seem quite realistic. It does what it wants to. You
might not find yourself cheering, but you'll probably be on the edge of
your seat. Sure I think of the cinema as an art form, and sure, I like to
be challenged by a film--to have my morals questioned--but by no means am I
so
snobbish that I can't appreciate escapist entertainment--and that's what
this film provides. I don't think you should pay more then $4.50 to get
in--but I don't think you'll altogether regret it if you do. </P>
