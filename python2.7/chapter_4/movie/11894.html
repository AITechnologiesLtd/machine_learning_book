<PRE>The Pelican Brief (1993)
* * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Good, workmanlike adaptation of Grisham's novel, but the joy of
discovery is gone.</P>
<P>John Grisham writes solid, workmanlike novels which get translated into
movies of dizzyingly varied quality. THE PELICAN BRIEF, directed by Alan
Pakula, is one of the better ones, but it's limited by the strangely
one-sided screenplay. A thriller should allow us to participate in the
puzzle being unscrambled onscreen; this one shuts us out, and instead gives
us too much manufactured suspense.</P>
<P>Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) is a legal student down south, and her mentor and
lover Tom Callahan (Sam Shepard, very nice) are both confused about the
assassinations of two Supreme Court justices. On a lark, Shaw tries to
figure out why two men of such disparate persuasions were killed -- but the
more she uncovers, the more serious she gets, and soon she's assembled an
amateur legal brief that purports to have the answers. Then the brief falls
into the wrong hands, and she's targeted for death. She runs -- one of the
nice things in the movie is that she is not stupid, and knows better than to
do things that leave a trail, like use credit cards -- and winds up crossing
paths with Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington), a journalist who has done jail
time for not jeopardizing his sources.</P>
<P>This leads us to the movie's big problem, which is that up until about the
halfway mark, we're almost totally in the dark about what the mystery is.
Then we get it -- all in one gigantic, clumsy expositional lump. This tactic
irritated me, because I could see no end of opportunities earlier on to
deploy the same information in small daubs -- and allow us to fit everything
together.</P>
<P>The movie is not stupid, though . There are many good touches, especially
whenever Grantham's journalistic ethics and his boss (a wonderful John
Lithgow) are concerned. One of my pet peeves is the way journalism (or
computer techonlogy, or the military) are represented in the movies, and
this one gets it mostly right: one scene with Washington and Lithgow arguing
about the factuality of a source has enough tension in it to propel a movie
all by itself. The thriller plot is well-oiled and unfolds nicely, even if
it is jury-rigged. And we get a gallery of good-to-excellent performances. I
don't normally think much of Julia Roberts, but she did well by me in this
one, and Denzel Washington is never less than great. There's also one piece
of cinematography -- a scene of someone being gunned down by a sniper --
that I will not soon forget.</P>
<P>But because we're not allowed to participate in any of the assembly of the
evidence from the start, we get only to watch passively, and instead get the
contrivances of an assassin (Stanley Tucci, really creepy) and many other
scenes that don't add up to much. I wanted THE PELICAN BRIEF to add up to a
lot more, but it worked against itself in far too many ways.</P>
