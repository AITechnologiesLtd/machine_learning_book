<P>F#!KIN' A!
Two f#!kin' Welsh sociopaths f#!k s#!t up in f#!kin' TWIN TOWN
--A review by Justin Siegel<HR>Starring: Llyrs Ifans, Rhys Evans
Director: Keith Allen
Star Rating: *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Rating out of Ten: 8.1<HR>In the same way TRAINSPOTTING, a grotty, perverted, and magnificant 
Scottish comedy, probably sent William Wallace spinning in his grave, 
TWIN TOWN, an even more grotty, perverted, and a little less magnificant 
Welsh comedy, will probably put a big fat grin on Welsh poet Dylan 
Thomas' dead face.</P>
<P>TWIN TOWN is the story of two brothers: Julian and Jeremy Lewis (Llyrs 
Ifans and Rhys Evans), who aren't twins but are thought to be by just 
about everyone. They a little bit poorer than TRAINSPOTTING's Mark 
Renton, but a little bit crazier, so it works out even. When their 
father, Fatty, falls off a roof and breaks his leg while working for 
Brynne Cartright, the "twins" want a little compensation. It doesn't take 
a genius to figure out that they aren't going to get it.</P>
<P>So what do they do? They urinate on Brynne's daughter's head while she 
sings at a Karaoke bar. And what does Brynne then do to get back at the 
twins? He gets a crooked cop to beat them up. And what do the twins then 
do to--well, the list goes on. Let' just say that decapitated poodles, 
sheep-molesting farmers, and exploding trailor parks all make cameos 
along the way.</P>
<P>TWIN TOWN really wants to be TRAINSPOTTING. In fact, TRAINSPOTTING's 
director and producer exec-produced TWIN TOWN, and director Keith Allen 
had a supporting role in TRAINSPOTTING. TWIN TOWN is considerably funnier 
than TRAINSPOTTING, but not as powerful -- not by a longshot.</P>
