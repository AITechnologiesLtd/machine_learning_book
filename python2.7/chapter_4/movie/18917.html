<P>   "The General's Daughter" is the sort of movie that will be
cheered by people who hate their fathers.  Throw in folks who
dislike and mistrust all authority and you have a box office
success. Just wait for the hoops and hollers when the
honchos get their comeuppance! But if you have good taste
you'll recognize early on that while the concept that drives the
film has originality, Simon West directs Christopher Bertolini
and William Goldman's screenplay--based on a novel of the
same name by Nelson DeMille--with the usual plot
mechanisms, a conventional narrative approach, and hyped
soundtracks to create dramatic tension when virtually none
exists.  (You know that a film is desperate when the music
division resorts to the greatest cliche of all, Carmina Burana--
which is more appropriate to horror flicks.)   </P>
<P>   Since "The General's Daughter" involves crimes of violence
in the military with cover-ups abounding, it brings to mind
similar works like "A Few Good Men" and "A Soldier's Story." 
The former movie, based on a Broadway play, deals with the
trial of two Marines for complicity in the death of a fellow
Marine while they were serving on the U.S. military base on
Guantanamo.  The case puts the whole military mentality on
trial.  In the latter film, which is based on an off-Broadway
play, a white commanding officer in charge of a black
company whose sergeant has been murdered has the military
on edge because the killer may be a white officer or a
member of the local Klan.  The point: when films deal with
the genre of crime in the military, they often consider
investigations to be nothing less than inquiries that could
shake the entire armed forces to their foundation.  "The
General's Daughter" is no exception.</P>
<P>   "The General's Daughter" focuses on Warrant Officer Paul
Brenner (John Travolta), a sergeant who is working
undercover with the army's criminal investigation division.
Though a non-commissioned officer, he seems to have the
authority to bust personnel as high as generals, but not just
to apprehend them.  He just loves to use his superior brawn
to get the perps into hammerlocks, cuff them, throw them
against walls, and then tell their lawyers that in this man's
army the defendants do not have the right to counsel.  He is
conveniently paired with Warrant Officer Sarah Sunderland
(Madeleine Stowe) with whom--for no reason other than to
create romantic tension when none would ordinarily exist--he
once had a dalliance.  The story opens on Lt. General
Campbell (James Cromwell, the farmer from "Babe"), who is
receiving a retirement banquet from hordes of officers as the
great man prepares to accept a vice presidential nomination. 
(Wouldn't it be great to see this apparatchik get his from a
sergeant?)  When the general's daughter, Capt. Elizabeth
Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), is raped and strangled, Brenner
and Sunderland take swift action to get to the bottom of the
crime, but not before Brenner proves his vigor by ridding Fort
MacCallum of a racist gun-runner.</P>
<P>   This initial James-Bond style escapade serves as the only
exciting moment of shoot-em-up dynamics.  Subsequently,
the movie sinks into the usual unbelievable scenes 
commonly found in whodunits that feature flat dialogue,
macho men, vulnerable women, crazed killers, nutty victims,
and/or cover-up attempts involving high officials.  The
discovery of porn tapes in one officer's secret room--in the
living quarters of the army official you'd least expect to
possess these--creates renewed interest part-way into the
story, but before this movie can begin to drum up the interest
found in "8mm" the detectives are off on the more banal
cause: to blow the lid off the military.</P>
<P>   Travolta is most interesting during the first couple of
minutes when he puts on a convincing Bill Clinton accent to
fool the MP's at the fort, but then spends his time either
manhandling people well above his rank or flirting badly with
his partner, played without enthusiasm by the Madeleine
Stowe.  You'd think that Col. Fowler (Clarence Williams III),
who is the right-hand man of the general, would crack a little
smile, just once, and that Timothy Hutton would try to show
us some of the charm he rewarded us with as a college
instructor in "The Substance of Fire."  But no...everyone in
this picture takes himself or herself far too seriously as if to
prove that if you don't crack a smile or burst into laughter at
the silliness of the plot, you must be a darn good actor. </P>
