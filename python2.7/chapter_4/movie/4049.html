<P>     It's not often that a slasher/thriller is released by a recognized
distributor of art-house fare (in this case, Sony Pictures Classics),
but that's the case with MUTE WITNESS.  Of course, it's somewhat unfair
to pigeon-hole this movie by using the word "slasher", since that term
conjures images of FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH, and this picture aims
considerably higher.  In approach and execution, if not in content, MUTE
WITNESS belongs in the same category as another low-budget edge-of-the-
seater:  THE STEPFATHER.</P>
<P>     It goes without saying that it's not a good idea to think deeply
about this sort of movie while it's on-screen.  There are gaps in logic
-- many obvious, others less so--but these occur in service of a
better-paced, more taut storyline.  MUTE WITNESS isn't a masterpiece of
plotting or originality, but it provides the requisite shocks and
scares, includes a few unexpected twists, and mixes together a fair
number of the genre's requisite cliches.  It's slick and fun, but not
great.</P>
<P>     MUTE WITNESS opens on the set of a low-budget, schlocky horror
flick being filmed in Moscow.  Director Andy Clarke (Evan Richards) has
brought the production to Russia because costs are low (the same reason
MUTE WITNESS was filmed there--art imitating life).  Only two other
Americans are with Andy on this journey:  his lover/assistant, Karen
Hughes (Fay Ripley), and her sister, the movie's special effects/makeup
maestro, Billy (Mary Sudina), who is mute but not deaf.  The cast and
crew are all locals, many of whom don't speak English.</P>
<P>     One night, Billy becomes locked in the studio after dark.  As she
searches for a way out, she comes upon two men filming what appears to
be a porno movie.  All is not as it seems, however, and the sex act
turns violent.  While the camera rolls and Billy looks on in silent
horror, the naked woman is brutally hacked to death.  As Billy turns to
flee, she knocks over a coat rack, and a chase through lonely, deserted
corridors ensues.</P>
<P>     Director Anthony Waller keeps the tension at a high level that
atones for many of the film's faults.  Several thriller staples appear
to have been deliberately included--not because the plot requires
them, but as a kind of "wink and nod" at the knowing audience.  There
isn't a need to show Billy emerging naked from a bath, but Waller does
it anyway.  There's a thinly-disguised playfulness about how he
approaches this, as well as other, traditional slasher/thriller
elements.</P>
<P>     The last half-hour is nicely convoluted.  The situation is
complicated to begin with because of the communications
difficulties--hardly anyone speaks the same language, and Billy can't
talk at all.  On top of that, MUTE WITNESS toys with us by making it
unclear who's on whose side.  Things are sorted out by the last frame,
but it's fun to guess along the way about who can be trusted.</P>
<P>     The only "name" actor in the film is Sir Alec Guinness, who has
     the briefest of cameos as "The Reaper"--the vile instigator of
all that takes place.  Everyone else in the cast is an unknown.  The
best acting job is turned in by Mary Sudina, whose mute performance is
lively and convincing.  Fay Ripley and Evan Richards don't fare as well
dramatically, although several of their scenes contain a portion of
comic relief.</P>
<P>     There's nothing especially artsy about this film.  The issue of
communication, and the resulting vulnerability and isolation that occur
when there's no common language, is one of MUTE WITNESS' most compelling
themes, but it's too often used as little more than a plot device.  This
film has its share of blood, gore, chills, and thrills, and Waller is
competent, although not masterful, at blending these elements without
bothering too much with the abstract--and potentially more
interesting--aspects of his production.</P>
