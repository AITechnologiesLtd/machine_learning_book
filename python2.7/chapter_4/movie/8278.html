<PRE>    THE ENGLISH MAN WHO WENT UP A HILL, BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Hugh Grant, Colm Meaney, Tara Fitzgerald, Ian McNeice, Kenneth
Griffith, Ian Hart, Robert Pugh Director: Christopher Monger Screenplay:
Christopher Monger based on the story told by Ivor Monger</P>
<P>We all have our unique quirks and obsessions; but when it comes to what
is considered a hill, and what is considered a mountain, the Welsh win
hands down. People have fought and died over less, so let's give this
tale of metric measurements a twenty foot chance.</P>
<P>'Ffynnon Garw' Welsh hill turned mountain, or mountain turned hill
(depending on the change of seasons or it's human residents), is twenty
feet short of one thousand. So guess what the community does about it?
Toil, sweat and buckets of dirt; a dead priest, a coffin at its peak,
and of course enough soil to allow 'The English Man' (Hughes) to walk
down a mountain.</P>
<P>This is not a particularly exciting, or well made film. But if ever
interested in a bit of Welsh history, or the joining of human effort -
T.E.M.W.W.U.A.H.B.C.D.A.M. is for you.</P>
<P>Comment: Not Mount Everest but still a pretty hill.</P>
