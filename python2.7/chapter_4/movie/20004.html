Capsule Review, August 15, 1999.</P>
<P>Marion Vernoux's "Love Etc." is a rare French film that could almost be 
mistaken for an American film in its portrayal of three characters who are 
about as annoying and dim-witted as a bunch of flies. Marie (Charlotte 
Gainsbourg) is a lonely art restorer who puts a personal ad in the local 
newspaper in hopes of meeting a charming companion who can sweep her off her 
feet. Benoit (Yvan Attal), a man with no self-esteem and a low self-worth 
level, answers it, but afraid that she will be turned off by his appearance, 
sends her a picture of his better-looking, womanizing best friend, Pierre 
(Charles Berling), instead. Once Benoit and Marie meet, they instantly hit it 
off, even going as far as to get married soon after. Unfortunately, their 
unexpected happy existence is threatened when Pierre begins hanging around 
more and more, until Benoit is convinced they are having an affair behind his 
back. If not for the mature performances by the three leads, especially 
Charlotte Gainsbourg, "Love Etc." would be an almost completely worthless 
drama, but as is, it is more frustrating than anything. From the very 
beginning, it is obvious that the actors are playing characters who are well 
below their own personal intelligence, as they all are forced to do unlikely, 
at times cruel, things to one another. A few subtle, quiet moments sneak in 
every once and a while, but the asinine screenplay, by Julian Barnes, 
destroys all signs of cinematic promise.</P>
