<PRE>                            SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Nora Ephron tells the story of Fate
     bringing together a man and a woman "made for each other."
     The story is occasionally touching, but feather-light.
     Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Not long ago A STRANGER AMONG US introduced audiences to the word
"bashert."  It is the concept that a man and a woman are fated to meet and
fall in love, a pairing made in heaven.  People in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
discuss whether there is anything to this concept and are inclusive, but it
is clear that screenwriter Nora Ephron wants us to believe it is true.
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has the strangest case of bashert since SOMEWHERE IN
TIME.  Ephron, who previously wrote WHEN HARRY MET SALLY..., has written and
this time directs this story about when Sam met Annie.</P>
<P>     Sam is Sam Baldwin (played by Tom Hanks).  Sam lost his wife Maggie and
decides to leave Chicago and its memories and to move to Seattle.  There,
eighteen months later, he is still a wreck and an insomniac to boot.  He
lives in a houseboat with his son Jonah (talk about tempting fate!).  Jonah
(played by Ross Malinger) calls a radio psychologist to ask what his dad
should do.  When Sam is called to the phone, he opens up to the psychologist
and shows such sensitivity that hundreds of women listerers across the
country are moved, including the absolutely right woman for Sam.  She is
Annie Reed (played by Meg Ryan).  Unfortunately, she lives a continent away
in Baltimore and is already engaged to be married.  But Fate is not to be
cheated, and we follow two story lines--the lives of Sam and Annie--knowing
full well that they will eventually come together.</P>
<P>     Ephron's plotting is not really her strong point.  The film is
extremely sentimental from the opening credits on.  Under the credits we
hear Jimmy Durante singing "As Time Goes By" and are shown a map of the
United States on a section of a globe.  As each actor's name is credited, a
star is added in the sky over the map.  Then in the film as a running gag
everybody has seen the sad film AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER.  All the women love
it; none of the men care for it.  Eventually that film will be pivotal in
bringing Sam and Annie together.</P>
<P>     While the plot is sentimental and a little sticky, the dialogue is a
lot of fun and often very witty and insightful.  Annie's confidante is her
friend Becky (played by Rosie O'Donnell) who, like Annie, is unmarried and
is clearly getting frustrated.  Her cynical comments are some of the best
lines in the film.  On the other hand, Sam's conversations with his friend
Jay (played by Rob Reiner) are totally unlikely and inane.  As before,
Ephron's female characters are better written than her male characters.
Still, it is unusual these days to see an unabashedly--not to say overly--
romantic film.  SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is diverting and even nostalgic with
its resurrection of old songs that act as commentary on the story.  Nothing
great, but a solid +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
