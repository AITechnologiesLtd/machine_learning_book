<P>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</P>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Austin Powers has lost his mojo all right.  And so, unfortunately,
has Mike Myers.</P>
<P>        In this much-anticipated follow-up to 1997's "Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery," Myers and his co-conspirators have missed a
wonderful opportunity to improve upon the original film and given us
instead a wildly uneven romp which misses about twice as much as it hits.</P>
<P>        The dark forces in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" draw
consistently bigger laughs than the swinging secret agent and his latest
shag-pad material, CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (a stunningly awful
Heather Graham).</P>
<P>        Dr. Evil (Myers) is back, hysterically so, as is his right-hand
woman, the Rosa Klebb-styled Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, still having
a blast).  They're joined by Dr. Evil's delinquent son (Seth Green, also
terrific) and an obese Scot with the catchy moniker of Fat Bastard.  Played
by Myers under what seems to be three metric tonnes of makeup and
prosthetics, Fat Bastard is a repulsive cross between Monty Python's Mr.
Creosote (from "The Meaning of Life") and Charlie MacKenzie's father in "So
I Married an Axe Murderer."  Myers has the accent down perfectly and his
Fat Bastard is a welcome, if gross, addition to the film's eccentric roster
of villains.</P>
<P>        Also in tow in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a one-eighth-the-size
version of Dr. Evil.  "I shall call him <pinkie to the lower lip> Mini Me."
Mini Me (played by Verne Troyer) is another brainstorm; too bad they
couldn't have come up with a kitten-sized version of Mr. Bigglesworth.  And
last but not least there's Rob Lowe as the young Number Two, who does a
better Robert Wagner than Robert Wagner.</P>
<P>        Whenever the bad guys are on screen, especially Dr. Evil, the film
is a hoot.  One of the film's funniest lines comes when Dr. Evil is going
through his "zip it" routine with his son Scott.  But the writers don't do
anything with Austin except to land him with the great-looking but
hopelessly-afloat Graham.  A brief but satisfying appearance by the
original film's Elizabeth Hurley only reinforces just how bad Graham is.</P>
<P>        Austin flashes his bad teeth and growls "groovy baby, yeah!" but
his character is becoming very repetitive and Myers himself doesn't seem to
know how to extend his creation.  So the film settles for a lot of
unwelcome bathroom and bodily orifice humor.  And I mean a lot.  Austin
Powers accidentally mistaking a stool sample for coffee?  Felicity
"retrieving" things from Austin on all-fours in silhouette?  You have to
believe that Myers and his co-writer Michael McCullers can do better, much
better, than that.</P>
<P>        "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" has some terrific sight
gags, several outrageously funny product placements, a bunch of inspired
cameo performances (Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello *not* included), a
cleverly-edited sequence in which various people comment on the phallic
nature of Dr. Evil's spaceship, and a wonderful throng of evildoers who ham
it up at every possible opportunity.</P>
<P>        But for those of us who expect a little more from the extremely
talented Mike Myers, the psychedelic love machine in his Carnaby Street
duds is--at least for the time being--all shagged out.</P>
