<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>As one might expect from a film featuring a cast including some of
America's greatest active actresses, Jocelyn Moorehouse's A THOUSAND
ACRES, based upon the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Jane Smiley,
benefits from customarily outstanding central performances.  Sadly,
the fine performances by Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are in
service of a particularly overwrought screenplay by famed Aussie
screenwriter Laura Jones which fails to live up to the standards set
by their work.</P>
<P>As has been well publicized, A THOUSAND ACRES is a modern adaptation
of Shakespeare's tragedy, "King Lear", in which the benevolent
monarch is eventually driven to madness and death by the scheming and
conniving of his two evil daughters Goneril and Regan after his
proposal to divide his kingdom up three ways -- to Goneril, Regan,
and the youngest and favourite daughter, Cordelia.  However, the Ms.
Smiley's novel, and Ms. Moorehouse's film, stands "King Lear" on its
head while transporting it to the modern American Midwest -- here,
Ginny/Goneril (Ms. Lange) and Rose/Regan (Ms. Pfeiffer) are the
sympathetic protagonists, while Larry Cook/Lear (Jason Robards) is
antagonistically portrayed as the abusive farmer who proposes to
split his prized thousand-acre Iowa farm between daughters Ginny,
Rose, and Caroline/Cordelia (Jennifer Jason Leigh).</P>
<P>It's a fine idea and a solid premise to attempt to reinvent the plot
by embracing (and, where needed, embellishing upon) the perspective
of a different set of characters in the story, and A THOUSAND ACRES
is initially very faithful to this concept.  The problem is that it's
simply *too* faithful -- seemingly hampered by the unnecessary
inclination to touch upon every major plot point in "King Lear" from
its alternate perspective, the film's narrative flow suffers,
lurching back and forth and resulting in inconsistent
characterization and erratic behaviour in service of the plot.</P>
<P>The early scenes in A THOUSAND ACRES are particularly problematic, as
characters seem to change their behaviour depending upon which way
the wind is blowing.  Featuring an absurd amount of unnecessary and
extraneous voice-over by narrator Ginny, the first hour of the film
seems more like a sequence of vaguely interrelated scenes rather than
a cohesive introduction, and while they clearly aspire to be moving
-- Richard Hartley's stirring score, virtually omnipresent at the
outset, at times obscures the dialogue -- there's ultimately no real
payoff, and it's easy to become distanced by the sudsy storyline.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND ACRES takes an irrevocable turn about halfway through the
film, effectively demonizing Larry, and by association, his
supportive daughter Caroline, and canonizing Ginny and Rose.  It's at
this point where the film begins to collapse in on itself, as all
subtlety inferred in the familial relationships is lost, and where
stunning revelations fraught with heavy doses of melodrama become par
for the course.  The film quickly loses interest in Larry and
Caroline and focuses upon the sisterly relationship between Ginny and
Rose; it's telling how inconsequential Larry and Caroline become that
their eventual fates are left as a throwaway piece of narration.</P>
<P>And yet, due to the performances and the handsome cinematography by
Tak Fujimoto, it all almost works.  Ms. Lange and Ms. Pfeiffer turn
in superb performances as the film's leading characters; Ms. Lange
portrays great depth and thoughtfulness in her moving turn as Ginny,
whose pleasant nature masks her struggle with long-buried repression,
while Ms. Pfeiffer is equally mesmerizing as the blunt, forthright
Rose.  She demonstrates an emotional volatility and edginess rarely
seen in any of her other film performances (ironically, reminiscent
however to Ms. Lange's previous work), and Ms. Pfeiffer's icy,
unblinking stares convey a torrent of spiteful emotion.  Ms. Lange
and Ms. Pfeiffer have great screen chemistry, and these performances
are indeed so strong that they serve to emphasize the weaknesses in
the film; one is so impressed with their individual performances that
they are left wondering how much more effective they would be had
they been in service of involving characters in a film less cumbered
by artifice and not nearly as intent on tugging heartstrings.</P>
<P>The remainder of the cast is quite capable. Ms. Leigh and Mr.
Robards, both underused in A THOUSAND ACRES, share an easy affable
chemistry onscreen -- no surprise: where do you think she got the
name 'Jason' for her stage name, after all?  The remainder of the
more-prominent male characters have little depth.  Keith Carradine is
fine as Ginny's dignified husband Ty (correlating to "King Lear"'s
Duke Of Albany), while Kevin Anderson is again fairly wooden and
quite uninteresting as Rose's destructive husband Peter.  Colin Firth
is uncompelling as Jess Clark, but he's not given much material with
which to work -- his superfluous character adds nothing to the film
(Ginny could have easily been stirred out of her stupor in another,
more effective manner than through the use of his character) -- and
frankly seems extraneous to the story, save for the ill-conceived
need to remain near-religously faithful to the original source
material.</P>
<P>Ms. Moorehouse reportedly was extremely displeased that her final cut
of A THOUSAND ACRES was discarded in place of the one currently seen
on the finished product, and threatened to go the Alan Smithee route
by removing her name from the project.  As can be seen by the
direction credit, she was eventually appeased, but I, for one, would
be curious to see how her cut of the film plays.  If it's any easier
to become involved with these characters and their dilemmas, it'll be
an improvement, but the problem ultimately lies with Ms. Jones'
unfocused, vastly-overwritten screenplay; consequently, any
improvements would be minor, incremental ones.</P>
