<PRE>                             2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY
                        A film review by Dominic Ow

Rating : ** out of *****</P>
<P> There are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes
and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it. Then there are
movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it
all in the last five minutes. Writer-director John Herzfeld's Two days
in the valley falls into the latter category.</P>
<P>Weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters,
Herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a
Altmanesque series of parallel stories. Hitmen Lee (James Spader) and
his partner Dosmo (Danny Aiello) pop a guy in bed while leaving his
drugged wife Becky Fox (Teri Hatcher) lying next to him showing the
audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked. An understandeably
shocked Becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down
a couple of vice cops, (Jeff Daniels) and Wes (Eric Stoltz). A murder is
not vice territory, flirting with asian prostitues is, but Wes would
rather play inquisitive detective.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, washed-up director, Teddy (Paul Mazursky) is about to end his
life. But before he can do that, he must find a good home for his dog.
Enter nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), who takes the dog and Teddy for a ride.</P>
<P>Stuffy art dealer, Allan Hopper (Greg Cruttwell) has kidney stones. While struggling about his fancy house, he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's (Glenne Headly) plain appearance.</P>
<P>Don't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just
what the hell is going on. You might like that feeling of cluelessness. 
Herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces
it all rather neatly in the last five minutes.</P>
<P>The jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though. The
characters lack the stature or moral complexity of Altman's real-life
heroes in Short Cuts, even though they are interesting and funny. Funny,
that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of Tarantino's Pulp
chcaracters. The tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean
resolution of (director's name? guy who also did last seduction) Red Rock
West.</P>
<P>Two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the
screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters.
It'll keep you guessing alright but you won't remember the answers five
minutes after the credits.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.

 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
