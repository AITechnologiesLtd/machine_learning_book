Rated R (for horror violence, gore, profanity, and a brief sex scene).
Back in the early 1980's, there was a slasher movie craze, and it 
eventually burned out because the films simply weren't any good, 
reaching for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking. But then 
1996's "Scream," a genre-shattering horror flick suddenly revived the 
genre, and since then we have been bombarded with new horror movies, and 
the strange thing is, ever since then, they could be divided easily into 
two categories: the great ("Scream," "Scream 2," "I Know What You Did 
Last Summer") and the awful ("An American Werewolf in Paris," 
"Wishmaster"). Usually you can tell before you see one of these little 
fright items whether they are going to be worthwhile or not. And 
luckily, the new slasher film, "Urban Legend," directed by newcomer 
Jamie Blanks, fits in the former category: the great.
"Urban Legend" stars Alicia Witt (TV's "Cybill") as Natalie, a student 
of the fictional northeastern college Pendleton University, who becomes 
convinced after several dead bodies show up that a psychopathic killer 
is on the loose, murdering people in ways that are based on urban 
legends (i.e. an axe-wielding killer hiding in the backseat of your car, 
a babysitter receiving threatening phone calls that are coming from 
inside the house, etc.). Complicating the story even more is the myth 
that at the college 25 year ago, a muder spree took place, and the sole 
survivor was Mr. Wexler (Robert Englund), who, surprise!, is currently 
teaching the American Folklore class at Pendleton U.
As in the "Scream" movies, "Urban Legend" has a lot of fun toying with 
its audience on who the killer is: could it be Mr. Wexler; Paul (Jared 
Leto), a journalism major and potential boyfriend of Natalie; the 
school's janitor; or any number of the other students and staff. 
Regardless of this minor similarity to "Scream," "Urban Legend" is an 
original because of the extremely clever, ingenious storyline. 
Practically no popular legend is left unturned, and all of them are used 
to spooky effect.
There are many things that separate this from those 80's stalk-and-slash 
movies: the characters aren't all one-dimensional airheads, and the 
performances are from mostly talented up-and-coming actors; the writing 
is sharp and often funny, with many in-jokes and tributes to other 
movies, most noticably "Halloween"; the killer's identity is, for most 
of the running time, unpredictable; and most importantly, it is actually 
scary, with many effective, suspenseful set-pieces.
Two particular moments that are especially nerve-wracking is the opening 
scene, set at a gas station, and another set at a radio station. The 
picture runs at a brisk pace, and is consistently entertaining.
The technical credits are superb, particularly the moody cinematography 
which casts the college as an ominous character of its own, and the 
down-beat music score. Another plus is that there are very few songs in 
the movie, and like some of the great genre works, like "Halloween" and 
"The Exorcist," it relies more on instrumental scores.
If there is a negative thing about the resurgence of the horror genre, 
it is usually the climax, which reveals the killer's identity and then 
becomes an example of overacting, and loses its frightening grip. Not 
here. In "Urban Legend," the villain, whom will remain nameless, 
obviously has a lot of fun, and it becomes both menacing and strangely 
humorous. 
Oh, and one last thing that is worth mentioning: Loretta Devine, who 
plays the school's black security guard who is obsessed with Pam Grier 
and blaxploitation movies, is a standout, stealing every scene she's in.
"Urban Legend" is one of the very best of the recent slasher offerings, 
because it mixes its laughs and chills with more smoothness and grace 
than usual, and it proves that just because it's a horror movie where 
people are brutally murdered doesn't mean it still can't be intelligent 
and impressive filmmaking. </P>
