<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>What I didn't need was Australian director/writer of "Cedars," Scott
Hicks ("Shine"), to tell me what a bad thing the internment of Japanese
Americans during World War II was for a little over two hours of a
darkly photographed film and then precede to bore me to death with a
glum romantic/courtroom drama, that never got untracked, but seemed so
proud of itself for being so politically correct in taking a stand
against bias. All the film's great social themes and plays on morality,
were too docile and too manipulatively inflated to hold my interest.</P>
<P>The film is set in the Pacific Northwest of Washington, in an island
fishing village in the early 1950s, where the weather was either misty
or snowing. The first part of the film, just stagnated, as uninvolving
flashbacks filled the screen and uninteresting storytelling techniques
prevailed, without fleshing out the reality of the characters except to
see them in wooden terms.</P>
<P>A fisherman is found dead, entangled in his net and the sheriff who
discovers the body suspects foul play. Through flashbacks at the trial
that visually move back and forth from present to past, we learn that
the fisherman was a childhood friend of Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), who
is being accused of the murder because he was the last one on the boat
with the fisherman and had a motive for killing him. He is a decorated
Japanese American war veteran, whose family was to buy land from the
fisherman's white family but missed their payments when Miyamoto's
family was sent to the detention camp for the remainder of the war. He
is now asking his childhood fishing partner to consider going against
his mother and sell him the land. The fisherman's mother was bias
against the Japanese because of Pearl Harbor and sold the land to a
white farmer, returning to the Japanese family all the money they put
into the land for payments.</P>
<P>Into the picture, in the middle of a snow storm, the reluctant hero of
the film, Ishmael Chambers (Hawke), smelling a story that intrigues him,
as he is now a reporter on the same paper his father was a
crusading-editor (Shepherd), who sought justice for the Japanese
Americans during WW11, reminding his readers that they are our
neighbors. Ishmael had fallen madly in love with Kazuo's wife, Hatsue
(Youki Kudoh), as a teenager when they grew up so close to each other,
but she sent him a "Dear John" letter after her mother urged her to only
marry a Japanese boy, when she was in the camp and he was fighting in
the South Pacific.</P>
<P>At the trial, ponderously played, featuring various forms of flashback:
we see a fair-minded judge (Cromwell), a one-dimensional bigoted D.A.
(Rebhorn), and the defense attorney Gudmundsson (Max Von Sydow), who
tries to steal every scene he is in with his sometimes melliflous and
other times doddering spiel in defense of Kazuo, bringing up a  corny
liberal argument against prejudice, and finally telling the court
humanity itself is on trial. Von Sydow reflects the opinions of the
author of the popular novel the film is based on, David Guterson.
Everything seemed so contrived, the film had no fresh air to breathe,
the cinematography was darkly uninspiring, the courtroom seemed to be
staged only as a reason to give the filmmaker his chance to applaud
himself for being so free of bias.</P>
<P>The kicker to the story comes from Ishmael, when he decides to come to
terms with the bitterness of being rejected by Hatsue and he turns over
to the court in the nick of time evidence he had discovered of her
husband's innocence. Everything seemed so mechanical: the acting, the
story, and the directing; everything was so dutifully right, the film
left me asleep in the cedars, as I was unable to see what the fuss was
about in telling Americans that their country shamefully put Japanese
Americans in internment camps during the war. What's the surprise? Don't
they teach that in the high school social studies courses anymore?</P>
