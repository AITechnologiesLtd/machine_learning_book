<PRE>                         THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>How does it feel to be very bright, to yearn for a man's love and
passion and still regard yourself as pretty close to being an ugly
duckling?  That is what Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand), a professor of
Romantic Literature at Columbia University,  has to confront.  Has not
her mother, Hannah, (Lauren Bacall) told her, in not those exact
words, that she is a plain-looking woman?  Mother Hannah, despite her
getting along in years still has traces of her beauty and makes the
most of it.</P>
<P>On the other side of the coin there is handsome Gregory Larkin, a
Columbia U. mathematics professor  who has to ward off the advances of
a host of beautiful women only too eager to get him into the sack.
(We should all have that problem.)  Gregory yearns to meet a woman
whom he can love because they have things in common, because she is
bright, rather than because she is beautiful.   In desperation he
places a Personal Ad that reads "Columbia University professor (male)
seeks a woman interested in common goals and companionship.  Must have
a Ph.D. and be over thirty-five. Physical appearance not important."
With a little chicanery by her sister, Rose and Gregory meet.</P>
<P>Almost immediately there is that chemistry of admiration and respect
and love and Gregory asks her, to her great surprise and happiness, to
marry him.   Of course, Gregory has not so much as kissed her yet,
His love is that of the aforementioned admiration and respect variety.
Rose, for her part, agrees but she also looks forward to making
passionate love with her husband.  What happens when she discovers
that is not at all what he had in mind.  Had he not told her that
stuff about admiration and respect?  Why is she obviously angry and
frustrated?  What is wrong with women?  Cannot a husband and wife have
love without sex?  Apparently not in their case.</P>
<P>Based on the French film, LE MIROIR A DEUX FACES, Streisand's version
is a delightful romp as we witness the metamorphosis of a plain-Jane
into a svelte, glamorous, sexy-looking woman.  Let Gregory handle that
when he comes home from Paris after a three-month's lecture gig during
which Rose has not returned any of his many pleading phone calls.</P>
<P>Bridges is charmingly terrific as is Streisand.   Aided by such
experienced actors as Lauren Bacall at her best, Georges Segal, Mimi
Rogers, Pierce Brosnan, Brenda Vaccaro, the stunning Elle MacPherson,
the film is most entertaining.   This is one you will not want to
miss.</P>
