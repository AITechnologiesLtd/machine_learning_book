<P>     I relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can
make me feel like a fool.  I spent the first hour of FORCES OF NATURE
slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage, grousing to myself
about its transparently PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES plot machinations,
and waiting for the inevitable Hollywood denouement.  This was a mass
market romantic comedy, after all, a genre which has been taken over by
teenagers and, even in its best days, worked hard to perpetuate the
romance = infatuation paradigm.  Then Marc Lawrence did something 
wonderful, something which made the entire film click into place:  he
showed me a comic love story about grown-ups.</P>
<P>     It certainly didn't look that way from the outset, which introduces
groom-to-be Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) at his bachelor party, surrounded by
friends and family whooping over his "last night of freedom."  Ben loves
his fiancee Bridget (Maura Tierney), but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements
of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till
death do you part business.  Then, on an ill-fated flight from New York to
his wedding in Savannah, Ben meets Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), a
free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships
behind her.  As transportation troubles thwart them at every turn, Ben and
Sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows
ever stronger, Ben seeing in Sarah the chances he's never taken and Sarah
seeing in Ben the stability she's never had.</P>
<P>     FORCES OF NATURE gets off to a solid enough start, setting up the
characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue.  Ben is an
ideal role for Affleck's easy-going charm, and he plays the straight-laced
straight man without forced exasperation.  Sandra Bullock, for her part,
is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films
combined, avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character 
depth as moping.  The two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom
cast -- are effective and connected from the start, yet the script's
apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories Ben hears makes it
difficult to enjoy the romance completely.  Lively and funny though it may
be on a consistent basis, FORCES OF NATURE leaves a bitter taste that
feels like self-justification.</P>
<P>     The kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite
purpose, leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution.  FORCES OF NATURE
isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment; it's about a man
learning what commitment means _to him_, learning that it's not what he
thought it was.  Lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its
happy ending, an ending which is happy because people make the choices
that make the most sense.  Earlier scenes that might have felt like
throwaways take on more resonance, and that bitter taste sweetens into
something fresh and genuine.  Though one too many plot contrivances keep
Ben and Sarah together through the film, and they do exchange the 
obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples, FORCES
OF NATURE wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor
and the simple wisdom.</P>
<P>     That is, provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy
direction of Bronwen Hughes.  For a brisk romantic comedy, FORCES OF
NATURE comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the
year:  teetering hand-held shots, why-not low or high angles, sweeping
pans.  Occasionally the hyper-real approach works, with cinematographer
Elliot Davis creating a world of fantasy romance; far more often, Hughes
refuses to let a scene be what it is, covering it with flourishes so thick
you almost can't find what's underneath.  A script this smart and mature
deserved a more restrained director, but even Hughes' excesses can't spoil
this unique concoction.  FORCES OF NATURE may restore your faith in
romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant, something that
can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and
about adolescents.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 special forces:  7.</PRE>
