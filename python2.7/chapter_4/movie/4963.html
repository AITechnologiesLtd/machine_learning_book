<PRE>                           LAND BEFORE TIME III
                       THE TIME OF THE GREAT GIVING
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     The original THE LAND BEFORE TIME is an involving, magical, and
beautiful tale.  In the second sequel, LAND BEFORE TIME III: THE TIME
OF THE GREAT GIVING, the physical beauty is still there as are all of
the lovable lead characters, but sad to say that the director (Graham
Morris instead of Don Bluth), writers (John Loy and John Ludin instead
of Judy Freudberg, Tony Geiss, and Stu Krieger), and all of the voices
are different.  This version is a sweet and harmless little story that
will delight kids who are into the series, but the underdeveloped and
formulaic story line will disappoint adult viewers.</P>
<P>     Ducky, Petrie, Littlefoot, and Sarah are again the stars.  Their
voices sound the same, but actually they are done by different people.
In short, these dinosaurs are as lovable as ever.  Every time Ducky
delivers her canonical, "Yep, yep, yep" response, a warmth goes through
my whole body.  These are the sort of animal characters that kids and
adults of all ages can cherish.</P>
<P>     LAND BEFORE TIME III is a story about water conservation.  It has
subthemes of parents learning how to become parents and of species
learning how to work together and share, hence the subtitle of the
movie.  Unlike the original of the series, which had the quite scary
T-Rex called Sharptooth, this version has only a group of young bullies
lead by Hip.  Hip and his band and some mildly mean dinosaurs that
appear at the end are weak villains, hence the show lacks any genuine
tension.  From the beginning it just meanders to a quick and fairly
uneventful ending.</P>
<P>     The story line is that a change in their environment causes The
Great Valley to begin rapidly to lose its water.  This means that the
dinosaurs fight for the little water left, and the vegetation they eat
starts vanishing.  While the adults are arguing over water allocation
rules, the four good kids venture into The Mysterious Beyond and find
that a volcano eruption has caused a landslide that blocks their water
source.  Meanwhile, the rebellious bullies want to keep the water for
themselves.  Hip declares, "When you're big.  All the rules that
grownups make don't apply to you," and other such tough guy mottoes.</P>
<P>     Eventually, the grownups come to learn how to be better parents.
Sarah's Dad tells Hip's dad, "if you always rule with anger, that's all
your son will know, and that's what he'll express to others."  True
enough, but like most lines in the show, it is too stilted.  The show
ends before it ever gets started, and the narrator pedantically
explains the message of the movie to us in case we missed it, telling
us that the dinosaurs, "each learned the special kind of joy which
comes from giving to others."</P>
<P>     LAND BEFORE TIME III runs 1:11 which is plenty of time given that
not much happens.  The film is available now on video.  Since what does
happen is totally innocent with no real villains and very mild,
non-scary violence, it justly gets a G rating.  There is no sex or bad
language.  The characters are all naked, but they are dinosaurs
afterall.  A kid of any age could see the film, and if they liked the
others in the series, they will probably enjoy this one albeit probably
not as much.  My son Jeffrey (almost 7) likes all three shows and gives
this one a thumbs up.  I can not recommend the picture, but for the
wholesome and lovable characters in search of a script and for
wonderful, soothing, theme music (James Horner), I do give it **, which
may be a bit on the generous side.  On the other hand, I love that
"Yep, yep, yep" line.  You have to hear it to understand its appeal.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
