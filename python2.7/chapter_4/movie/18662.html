<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>KINGPIN</PRE>
<P>The concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it
stupid, really.  Shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown
miserably out of control.  Sadly, that is the case with Kingpin, a film
directed by the Farrelly Brothers, the duo that brought us There's
Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber.  Since the duo directed and
didn't write the script, I can assume that's part of the problem.</P>
<P>The story seems good enough: a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of
Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is sitting on top of the world.  His
popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the
ground.  Then, however, he runs into Ed McCracken (Bill Murray), a rival
bowler with hardly any real consideration for, well, anything.  These
two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting, and,
before Roy sees it coming, Ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his
hand in a bowling ball machine.</P>
<P>Forward seventeen years later, where Roy has become quite the loser,
complete with mechanical hand, torn-up car, and, of course, the
occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for
a while.  However, he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local
bowling alley, where he runs into an Amish kid named Ishmael (Randy
Quaid), who has quite the bowling arm.  With the kid's help, he figures
he can be known again, particularly at the biggest bowling tournament
rapidly approaching in Reno, Nevada.</P>
<P>Of course, the Amish kid needs some coaxing, particularly when you
consider, well, he's Amish.  This leads to some of the best comic scenes
in the film, such as Roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the
cow.  Finally, the duo get on the road and, along the way, pick up an
additional helper- a beautiful hustler (played by the gorgeous Vanessa
Angel).</P>
<P>The main problem I had with Kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny.  In
fact, it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it, such as the
aformentioned above and Roy's explanation of not having children
(something involving a cheese grater?).  But that's just it- scenes.
There's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire
momentum of the movie, like the abuse Angel takes from her hustler
ex-boyfriend.  I mean, was this really necessary?  Couldn't have this
been handled just a bit wackier?  I mean, this is a comedy, why throw
ethics in?  Particularly in a Farrelly Brothers vehicle, where hair gel
can be easily mistaken?</P>
<P>That really ruined it, however, and that's too bad.  The acting is top
notch, especially from Angel and Murray, and the really funny scenes are
worth noting.  Still, if you're going to think dumb, think dumb all the
way through, OK?  At least the Farrelly Brothers got back on track with
Mary or I'd still be a little bit irked.</P>
