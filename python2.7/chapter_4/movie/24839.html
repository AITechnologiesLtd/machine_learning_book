<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film can be loosely pegged as a noir film, though it plays more
like a typical 1950s caper movie. The films open like a documentary, as
a voiceover tells us we are in Los Angeles and a group of bank examiners
are about to make a routine audit of a Hollywood bank. Herman Tate
(Beddoe), a bank teller himself, is disguised as a bank examiner and
sneaks in with the examiner group undetected. He then goes to the head
teller's window of Mike Donovan (Barry Sullivan) after an initial audit
by one of the real examiners, and asks to recheck the big bills while
his partner Vera distracts Mike, asking him if she can open an account
at his teller's window. He steals the $50,000 in those few seconds and
walks out of the bank unnoticed. At the end of the day, which is a
Friday, a worried Mike notices the large sum of money he is short, but
doesn't report it until Monday.</P>
<P>The poignancy of the story is how an innocent, hard-working person like
Mike, could have his whole life turned upside-down over such an
incident. When he tells his boss (Lummis) about it, he has no
explanation why he didn't report it immediately, except he couldn't
understand how so much money was missing. This minor slip-up, is why in
a loose way, Mike becomes a noir protagonist, though he doesn't have the
dark side to his character this genre usually calls for. His wife Ruthie
(Malone) accepts his story, trusting him completely. Even the bank
manager and the F.B.I. who question him, think he is innocent. But his
life turns into hell when, even though, he is not charged with anything,
the bonding company that must insure his honesty, cancels him out and
the bank is forced to fire him. Not only can't he get bonded so he can
get another teller's job, but the bond company puts a mean-spirited
insurance investigator on his tail, Gus Slavin (Charles McGraw). Slavin
is convinced Mike is guilty and tails him everywhere, and when Mike gets
a job, he informs the boss on him and Mike is promptly fired.</P>
<P>Finally a taxi company, run by a tough-minded boss (Reeves), refuses to
fire him, asking Slavin if you are so sure he stole the money, why isn't
he in jail!</P>
<P>Mike gets a chance to clear his name when he accompanies his wife to the
bank they just opened up an account in, and he recognizes the teller as
the one who acted as the bank examiner during the heist. He then
foolishly goes after Tate and Vera, not waiting for the F.B.I. men to
take over the pursuit, as he promised his wife he would do. After the
couple lure Mike into a trap, Tate refuses to shoot Mike, but Vera
shoots Tate and wounds Mike. Mike is able to somehow stumble out of the
beach house just as the police arrive to arrest Vera and get the money.
The film ends on an unclear note, as Mike is happily back at his job,
but Slavin is seen through his workplace window still following him for
no logical reason. I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean, except
that life for the Donovans will never be as rosy as it was when his day
started on that Friday morning in April before the bank got robbed. I
think if the filmmaker reworked some of the loose ends left hanging in
this film, there would have been a much stronger film to complement the
very strong characterization of the earnest Barry Sullivan character the
filmmaker was able to present.</P>
