<P>If you're tired of the crappy children's films that Hollywood keeps
cramming down your throat, check out these two gems from French
filmmaker Michel Ocelot - the most happening animator this side of Nick
Park and Aardman Studios (Chicken Run).  Ocelot's films are uniquely
animated and offer stories fresh enough to make the typical Disney film
seem like two-week-old bread.</P>
<P>Ocelot first became recognized in 1999 with a film called Kirikou and
the Sorceress, a wonderful adaptation of an African folktale. You know
Kirikou isn't the typical kiddie pic from its first scene, which depicts
a pregnant woman hearing her unborn child shout, "Mother - bring me into
the world!" Before you know it, the infant has bolted out of his
mother's womb, cut his own umbilical cord and begins to run around,
announcing to everyone within earshot that he is Kirikou.</P>
<P>But Kirikou quickly finds out that life on the outside isn't all it's
cracked up to be.  His father and most of his uncles have been eaten
trying to battle an evil sorceress and her robotic henchmen.  Despite
the sorceress' winning streak, Kirikou's last remaining uncle is on his
way to try his luck at knocking her block off.  Little Kirikou tags
along and is mistaken for a magic hat.</P>
<P>A battle ensues between the sorceress and Kirikou's village, with the
wicked woman setting various traps to capture the village's children.
She's a crafty sorceress, using a magic boat, a malevolent tree and a
wild boar (a la Princess Mononoke).</P>
<P>Although Kirikou plays well with most adults, it may not be a film for
your kids if you're concerned about cartoon nudity.  All of the female
characters are topless, and most boast an impressive, perky D-cup.  At
times, Kirikou looks like Howard Stern's dream come true as opposed to a
children's film, but if you're willing to overlook that very minor
problem, you'll find a gem of a film with important lessons that the
whole family will enjoy.</P>
<P>Ocelot's latest film - Princes and Princesses - offers more of the same
distinctive animation, but divides itself into six different sections,
which are held together with an interesting narrative.  Two children and
an adult sit in a dark studio and dream up ideas to turn into animated
shorts (there's no evidence confirming Ocelot developed his ideas in a
similar manner).  The three characters are silhouetted and use crazy,
magical equipment to develop their simple ideas into grand spectacles.</P>
<P>Each segment is set in a different time and place in history and, as the
title suggests, contains either a prince, a princess, or both.  The
stories, which are completely different and unrelated to each other, are
repetitive, like a children's book, and involve Egyptian fig trees, 19th
century Japanese coats and humans turning into ants.  There's even a
funny intermission about halfway through Princes that tells the audience
to take "a one-minute break to talk things over."  And each is packed
full of Ocelot's distinctive animation and thought-provoking morals,
which will thrill viewers of all ages.</P>
<P>Kirikou – 1:17 – Not rated, but includes a lot of cartoon boob action
Princes – 1:10 – Not Rated, and contains no objectionable material</P>
