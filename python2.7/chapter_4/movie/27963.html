<PRE><b>DRACULA 2000</b></PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Patrick Lussier
Written by: Joel Soisson, Patrick Lussier</P>
<P>Abraham Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer) is an antiques dealer with a 
secret in the cellar of his massive home. No one is entirely sure what he 
has buried down there, guarded by a high tech security system, but Marcus 
(Omar Epps) and his team of cyber thieves intend to find out. What they 
discover is not the gold and jewels they came for. Instead, they find 
Dracula himself (Gerard Butler), buried for over a hundred years. Dracula is 
soon released from his prison and seeks out Van Helsing's daughter, Mary 
(Justine Waddell), whom he is connected to in ways even he doesn't fully 
understand. So, Van Helsing and his assistant, Simon (Jonny Lee Miller), 
track the prince of darkness across Europe. As they travel, Simon (Belmont 
maybe?) soon realizes that all the legends aren't true. Dracula may hate 
crosses, but they don't exactly hurt him. Silver stakes are the way to go, 
and Drac's hatred of Christianity and silver may be the key to finding his 
weakness and killing him once and for all.</P>
<P>Hey Patrick, Dracula may be immortal, but we're not, and you just wasted two 
precious hours of our lives. Oh and what a waste of time this movie is. If 
you're like me, you'll spend your time trying vainly to keep from falling 
asleep (I asked the girl next to me to please slap me upside the head if I 
started drifting off. She seemed to like that idea and hit me even when I 
wasn't falling asleep) or chatting with folks next to you about the good old 
days when Dracula movies were entertaining. You know, the moment Dimension's 
logo hit the screen at the film's start, I got this sick feeling in my 
stomach. I had to wonder, why should I feel this way? Afterall, Dimension 
brought us <i>Scream</i> and <i>From Dusk Til Dawn</i>; two films which 
perfectly combine horror and comedy for a rousing good time. Then it dawned 
on me, while Dimension may have given us those great flicks, what have the 
brought us lately? <i>Highlander: Endgame</i>? <i>Reindeer Games</i>? That's 
not much of a resume there, and despite my hopes that <i>Dracula 2000</i> 
would pull them out of their rut with Wes Craven's name attached to it, this 
was not to be.</P>
<P>Hey, look everyone, it's another cast full of young and talentless actors. 
Jonny Lee Miller (<i>Mansfield Park</i>) leads our fairly talentless cast 
with a performance that almost borders on tolerable at times. He tries to 
deliver his lines with something resembling flair, but when your dialogue is 
about as wooden as the stake your trying to stick through Dracula (sorry, 
they're silver stakes now; when did that happen?), you can't be expected to 
do too much. Then there's Justine Waddell (<i>Mansfield Park</i>... 
interesting), about as attractive as your average teen actor, and just about 
as talented. How about Gerard Butler as the prince/princess/wolf/bat/leech 
of darkness? Try to imagine a nancy boy wearing a black trench-coat that's 
about two sizes too large, staring at everyone with a wide-eyed look that 
seems to say "Hey, look at me, I'm in a movie! Teehee!" That's our boy. The 
only saving grace comes from Omar Epps (<i>The Wood</i>), who does what he 
can with a seriously underwritten role, and the great Christopher Plummer 
(<i>The Insider</i>). When these two are on screen the film is almost 
tolerable. Almost being the key word there.</P>
<P>Here's a quick lesson for all you aspiring directors out there: a few 
startles do not a horror movie make. Does <i>Dracula 2000</i> have startles? 
Oh yes, of the cheap, cheesy, I would have seen it coming if I'd been paying 
attention to the movie variety. Does it have any scares? Not only does it 
not have a single scare, it doesn't have anything even remotely resembling a 
scare. It's as though Lussier intentionally avoided scaring his audiences. 
Yet it wasn't the lack of scares that surprised me. I've come to expect that 
from modern horror movies. What really surprised me is that there was no 
humor here either. The closest the film ever gets to a humorous moment is 
Dracula watching a music video filled with images of fire and people wearing 
leather. There is a look of sheer admiration on his face as he whispers, 
"brilliant." Other than that, don't expect a chuckle this time around. Why 
is this lack of humor surprising? Because most modern horror and slasher 
films have decided to forgo horror in favor of self-aware humor. <i>Dracula 
2000</i> has ditched horror in favor of... what exactly?</P>
<P>So, what works in the film? The first twenty or so minutes, in which we see 
the high-tech, high energy break in is quite entertaining. After watching it 
I'd settled in for what looked to be an entertaining movie. My mistake. 
That's about all that works in the film, but let me tell you right now what 
really, REALLY doesn't work. You ready? This is a minor spoiler (not that 
you should care). Forget everything you thought you knew about Dracula, 
folks. Forget all those stories about his once being Vlad the Impaler, a 
Transylvanian. According to Patrick Lussier, Dracula was actually the man 
responsible for turning Jesus in for his ten pieces of silver. Umm... what? 
I can forgive a bad horror movie, but I'm not too willing to forgive a bad 
horror movie that rewrites a good one. I've got to briefly mention the 
film's soundtrack, which is an unusual combination of modern rock songs and 
operatic singing which sounds like a bad Hans Zimmer imitation. While the 
soundtrack's disjointed feeling does rather fit the tone of the movie, 
that's not necessarily a good thing. <i>Dracula 2000</i> runs far too long 
at 127 minutes. I'd recommend the film to those who think modern horror 
movies "rule" (you people confuse me) and give it two and a half out of five 
stars. By the way, there is one legitimate scare in the film. It's preceded 
by five, count them, five different teen-flick previews. Lord have mercy.</P>
