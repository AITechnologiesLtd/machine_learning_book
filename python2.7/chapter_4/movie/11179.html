"The Borrowers" - Give Credit to the Little People
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Did you ever misplace a comb, only never to find it again?  Did you ever
wonder why you keep losing your keys?  Why is there always one sock
missing when you take your laundry out of the dryer?  Maybe it's because
you're not the only tenants living in your house.  If you look under the
floorboards or behind the cracks of the walls, you may indeed learn that
you have housemates called "The Borrowers".</P>
<P>Borrowers are little people standing no more than several inches high.
Because they scurry around like mice, are extremely intelligent, and
have never been seen, they are something of a myth.  When the 'Beings'
of the house are away, they come out to pilfer batteries, food, and
other supplies.  Credit cards are used as doors, dental floss is used
for rope and thimbles are used as pots. </P>
<P>The central story focuses on the family of the house, named the Lenders.
Supposedly, the house belongs to them, which was stipulated in a will,
but the scheming lawyer, played by John Goodman complete with oily hair
and villainy mustache, claims that a will was never made, and by
default, the house belongs to him.  He plans to level the house and then
to turn it into a deluxe condominium complex.  Of course, this would not
only force the Lenders to move out but would also force the Borrowers to
leave as well.  Ah...but there's no surprise that there is indeed a will
and when the Borrower children take back the will, the ogrish Goodman
comes after them with an exterminator.</P>
<P>But there is more to this movie than just an entertaining story and
watching the little people achieve escapes that would impress any
magician.  The humor is physical and very funny at times thanks to
Goodman's abilities.  He gets a face full of insecticide, electrocuted
and tremendously tormented.  Meanwhile, the visual aspect of the film is
a joy.  With a fairy-tale look right out of Mary Poppins or Wallace and
Gromit videos, the movie achieves a whimsical adventure that allows you
to sit back and enjoy the ride.  A climatic scene takes place in a milk
bottling plant.  Watch as the littlest one gets trapped inside a bottle
filled with milk as everyone tries to save him as the evil lawyer closes
in on them.</P>
<P>This 83 minute offering makes a terrific matinee and a great antidote if
you're suffering the blues.  Of course, be mindful that this is a film
based on a children's story, so if you don't go at night, prepare for an
audience full of kids.  Clever, cute, inventive, and fantastical, this
movie will bring out the inner child in all of us.</P>
