<PRE>THE HITMAN
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Back in 1980s, Chuck Norris used to be synonym for the
action films. He couldn't, of course, top the success and
fame of big action names like Sylvester Stallone or Arnold
Schwarzenegger, but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed
that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up
genre aficionados. That quantity was mostly provided by
Cannon Group, prolific production company that dominated the
B-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap,
formulaic and, more often than not, unwatchable genre
products. THE HITMAN, 1991 action thriller directed by
Chuck's brother Aaron, is one of the last among them.</P>
<P>Chuck Norris here plays Seattle cop betrayed, shot and left
for dead by his partner (which shouldn't surprise anyone,
considering the fact that the partner is being played by
Michael Parks, specialised for roles of usually very mean
characters). Surviving the shooting, cop is pronounced dead
and hired as deep undercover agent. He infiltrates the
underworld circles in Seattle and becomes their top hitman,
using his abilities to start brutal war between three major
crime organisations - Italians, French Canadians and
Iranians.</P>
<P>Since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability
from Chuck Norris, at least not in this kind of movie, the
biggest attraction of this film should have been action.
Well, the action in this film falls flat - it is boring,
repetitive and not at all exciting. It is nothing more than
monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too
brutal even for this type of films. We know very little
about Norris' character while, on the other hand, gangsters
are portrayed with more human dimension. In the end we
almost feel sorry for them, since they are shown totally
powerless against Norris and his unstoppable and bloody
crusade. During the film, somebody obviously became aware of
that problem, so the screenwriter introduced the subplot
dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by Norris. That
caused another problem - any questions about nature of that
relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this
one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and
gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation. The
photography in this film is dark, setting is depressive and
this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers
without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in
watching it.</P>
