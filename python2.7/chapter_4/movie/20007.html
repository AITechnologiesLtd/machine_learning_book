<P>BROKEDOWN PALACE has three things working against it.  It has been done
before.  (MIDNIGHT EXPRESS)  It has been done recently.  (RETURN TO
PARADISE)  And it has been done better.  (Both of the above)  But since
lack of originality has never stopped filmmakers, we find ourselves with
another opportunity to examine what happens when American tourists are
arrested for drug smuggling while in a foreign country.</P>
<P>Alice and Darlene are best friends.  Deciding that they are deserving of
one last unforgettable vacation together after their high school
graduation, they make plans to travel to Thailand.  Why?  They have no
real reason except a hotel room there can be had for six dollars per
night.  Besides, Thailand means "freedom", a piece of trivia that proves
irresistible to two naive and iconoclastic young girls.  Looking for a way
to break free of the "oppression" of their privileged upbringing, they
pack their bags and head to Thailand, giggling all the way.</P>
<P>Upon encountering the intense and unrelenting heat of Eastern Asia, Alice
gets the brainstorm to fraudulently lounge pool side at a five star
resort.  There they meet Nick Parks who, after partying with them, invites
them on a weekend jaunt to Hong Kong.  But a funny thing happens on the
way to Macao... they get busted for possession of heroin and tossed into
prison without a moment of hesitation.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie deals with their attempts to prove their innocence,
first to the authorities, then to their lawyer, and finally to themselves.</P>
<P>Claire Danes (THE MOD SQUAD) is Alice, the "wild" one of the duo.
Throughout the film, Miss Danes, bravely defiant and wearing her teen-aged
angst on her shoulder like a badge of honor, poses and postures more than
she acts.  Whatever it is that she's doing is not enough to lift the story
by newcomers Adam Fields and David Arata out of the melodramatic rut that
it has dug for itself.</P>
<P>Kate Beckinsale (THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO) plays Darlene with a bit more
subtlety.  The more reserved of the pair, Miss Beckinsale conveys a
sweetness and charm that is set in contrast to the bleak and unforgiving
environment into which her character is thrust.</P>
<P>Bill Pullman (LAKE PLACID) and Jacqui Kim (STAR TREK: GENERATIONS)
portray the girls' lawyers, Yankee Hank Green and his wife Yon.  They take
the case, at first for the money it brings and then later for the
injustice being levied against their clients.  Mr. Pullman's performance
as a man trying to work in a strange and crooked system is the best thing
about the movie.</P>
<P>Director Jonathan Kaplan (THE ACCUSED) obviously positioned the film to
appeal to the teen-age market.  It has the feel of being made with the
same arrogance of youth and counterculture mentality that seems to be so
prevalent among our teens.  The parents of the film are either helpless
and weak or hopelessly opinionated fools.  They are rendered powerless
because they work within the system rather than against it.</P>
<P>It is a system that does not look favorably upon our heroines.  The girls
learn that in Thailand, when accused of a crime, their entire lives come
under scrutiny.  As the Republicans tried to tell us in 1992, "character
does matter."</P>
<P>Ultimately, we will all be judged according to our actions and words.
Not by a crooked or corrupt system which operates on bribery and pride but
rather by the Judge of all righteousness before whom all will eventually
stand.</P>
<P>"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every
one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad." 2 Corinthians 5:10 [KJV]</P>
<P>At that time, neither bribes nor excuses will have an impact.  The only
things that will change the outcome of our time before the judgment seat
of Christ  are the actions we take and the decisions we make prior to
reaching it.</P>
