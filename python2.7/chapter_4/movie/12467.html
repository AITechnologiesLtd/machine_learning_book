<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>In these days of sexual harassment cases, I suggest that people go to see
ARTEMISIA  to see what sexual harassment really is.  </P>
<P>The true story opens in Rome in 1610 where 15 year old Artemisia is living
in a convent.  She takes a candle from the chapel to enable her to have
light in the late hours in her room to draw.  Her ability to sketch the
human body comes from her use of this candle and a mirror to examine and
recreate her own naked body.  When her artist father, Messier Gentileschi,
is shown her drawings he takes her from the convent to become his
assistant.  She does much of the painting that is passed off as his work.  </P>
<P>She wants to learn as much as possible but is not allowed to attend the
academy, simply because she is a female.   Her desire to learn about the
male body is fulfilled when she convinces a young worker to take off his
clothes for her, in exchange for a kiss.  She sketches what she has seen.</P>
<P>In the art world of that era females are only used as nude models and
participants in after hour orgies.  When her father is hired to work with
Agostino Tassi in painting the frescoes for a new church, Artemisia 
learns even more when she peeks through the window at one of the orgies. 
She prevails upon Tassi to become her art teacher and shows him her
sketches.  When he sees the male nudes that she has done, he surmises that
she is much more experienced than she is, and he is very surprised when
she loses her virginity to him.  </P>
<P>When her father learns of their indiscretions, he has Tassi arrested, for
rape.  Artemisia insists that he did not rape her, but her father is
trying to save her reputation, even at the cost of Tassi's career and
freedom.    Some of the scenes that follow had the audience gasping at
what happens next.  </P>
<P>The epilogue gives a condensed version of what became of them.  Artemisia
did, in fact, become a recognized artist, with works on exhibition at the
Louvre, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</P>
<P>This is an excellent movie, although it will not appeal to everyone.  I'm
very glad that I saw it.  I learned from it and I wouldn't mind seeing it
again.</P>
<PRE>I give it a solid B.</PRE>
