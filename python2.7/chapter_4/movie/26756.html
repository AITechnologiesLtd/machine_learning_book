<P>_Mercy_Streets_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        _Mercy_Streets_ is the latest feature film project from
Providence Entertainment, the makers of last year's abysmal
Christian-themed thriller _The_Omega_Code_--and, as that fact suggests,
there is an aggressive pro-faith agenda at work in this drama.  For
devout viewers of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, that element will be
enough to not only send them flocking to theatres, but also spread
enthusiastic word-of-mouth (as was the case with _Omega_).  For everyone
else, however, that angle is the only thing that separates this plodding
melodrama from most cheap direct-to-video fare.</P>
<P>        The not-ready-for-the-big-screen indications come early, when we
see that the top-billed star is none other than straight-to-tape stalwart
Eric Roberts.  Roberts, in fact, only has a supporting role in
_Mercy_Streets_, taking a back seat to the real lead, a justified unknown
by the name of David White (who also produced).  White plays John, a
recently released convict who quickly falls back under the wing of mentor
Rome (Roberts) and into the criminal life.  John tries to double cross
Rome, but when the plan unravels, John seeks out estranged brother
Jeremiah, a gentle guy studying to become an Episcopal priest.  The
twist?  Jeremiah and John are twins, setting the stage for laughably
primitive camera tricks (the brothers never face the camera at the same
time; composite shots have an obvious dividing line; etc).  When Rome
inadvertently kidnaps Jeremiah, John must assume his brother's identity,
and Jeremiah has his darker instincts brought out by Rome's persuasive
ways.</P>
<P>        While not especially fresh, there's nothing inherently wrong with
the basic premise of _Mercy_Streets_.  But such a twin-switch scenario
sinks or swims with the actor tackling the dual role, and White isn't up
to the task.  He is completely overwrought and unconvincing as the tough
John (an early scene that's designed to establish the character's mean
side is especially embarrassing), and while he fares better as the nice
Jeremiah, White isn't able to convey what should be the conflicted
anguish of that character.  The air of realism that director Jon Gunn so
clearly strives for is also ruined by Roberts' scenery chewing theatrics.</P>
<P>        Then there's the matter of the religious agenda.  Don't get me
wrong; I have no problem with a film that tries to push a personal belief
as long as it goes about it in a compelling way (e.g. _The_Contender_). 
Gunn fails to do so; despite some arbitrary visual flourishes (slow
motion and freeze frames), the film is slowly, lazily paced, and he and
co-writer John W. Mann clunkily incorporate the Gospel message--somewhat
baffling considering one of the main characters is a
minister-in-the-making.  As such, when the film suddenly shifts to talk
of God and His word, the moments stick out and feel even more preachy
than they otherwise would have been.</P>
<P>        The softhearted spiritual talk also feels less than sincere
considering the amount of violent content in _Mercy_Streets_.  Bloodshed
is fairly minimal, but there are some brutal moments, in particular a
couple of fistfighting scenes and one unexpectedly intense beating scene.
 The positive message behind _Mercy_Streets_ is good for the entire
family, but it seems like wasted effort when the vessel for the message
isn't entirely appropriate for all audiences.</P>
