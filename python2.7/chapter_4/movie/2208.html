<PRE>                                   MALICE
                       A film review by Jason John Seaver
                        Copyright 1993 Jason John Seaver</PRE>
<PRE>Cast:                Bill Pullman, Nicole Kidman, Alec Baldwin, Bebe Neuwirth.
                Special Appearances by Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott

Rating:                R (Violence, profanity, partial nudity)</PRE>
<P>     Whatever you do, don't see this movie twice.  It's not a bad way
to spend an afternoon, and it will keep you guessing, but a lot of time
it doesn't play fair with the audience.  You may not notice it at the
time, but fifteen minutes out of the theater, max, and the flaws will
become readily apparent.</P>
<P>     Bill Pullman plays the Dean of Student Affairs at Smith College, a
(real) all-female school in Massachusetts.  A serial rapist has been
stalking and mutilating his students, and he's understandably upset.
The detective assigned to the case (Bebe Neuwirth) hasn't had any
success in tracking the criminal down, and finds circumstantial
evidence that he may actually be the culprit.</P>
<P>     One of the girls manages to live through the experience, thanks to
a brilliant surgeon (Alec Baldwin).  The surgeon, it turns out, went to
the same high school with the dean, and is new in town, and looking for
a place to stay.  His classmate has an apartment on the third floor of
his house he can rent out, although his wife Tracy (Nicole Kidman) is
none too thrilled by this arrangement, even though it was originally
her idea to rent the apartment out.</P>
<P>     Point one in Malice's favor:  All four of the identified actors
give excellent performances; I was especially impressed with Pullman,
whom I had previously seen only in Mel Brooks's SPACEBALLS.  Neuwirth
actually did a little too well--I could have easily done without the
central Mass. accent, which in my opinion borders on one of the most
obnoxious modes of speech in existence (and I go to school and have
family here).</P>
<P>     Point two:  The situation absolutely screams that Baldwin's
character will be revealed to be the rapist, and that the movie will
culminate in a confrontation between him and Pullman that leads to the
former's demise.  Happily, that resolution doesn't come to pass.</P>
<P>     Point three:  The police are actually portrayed as efficient,
trustworthy, and effective.  This seems to be an extremely rare event
and should be noted.</P>
<P>     Taking away from MALICE, though, is that the situation that does
come to pass is unlikely in the extreme, with plot holes big enough to
drive a tank through comfortably.  The plot twists and turns like a New
England road, surprising at every opportunity.  The plot twists create
a terrific sense of paranoia, an atmosphere where no-one can be
trusted.</P>
<P>     They also suffer from seeming to be made up by the writers as they
went along.  Oftentimes a new revelation will have only a tenuous
connection to the story set out at the beginning of the movie, and by
the end several facts about the real situation are flat-out
contradictory.</P>
<P>     I've tried to reveal as little as possible about the movie because
it is, despite the writing flaws, an enjoyable (if ephemerally so)
movie.  The dialogue is well-done, the basic idea behind the plot is
good enough to make up for the missteps in execution.  Someone else
mentioned that a quirky mentor seems to be a Scott Frank trademark
(remember Robin Williams's role in DEAD AGAIN); Anne Bancroft is
excellent in her scene.</P>
<P>     I'd put it in the 6.0-6.5 range.  See it once, preferably at
matinee prices, and enjoy it for its plusses, rather than its fault.</P>
