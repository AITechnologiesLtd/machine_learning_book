                       A film review by Bryan Dobson

<PRE>REVIEW: Volcano 
RATING: 8.5 / 10</PRE>
<P>Well, I'll admit when I first heard about this film (which was before 
Dante's Peak) I could just smell what 'Twister' had started. So now it 
seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film 
era. With 'Twister', 'Dante's Peak', 'Volcano' and soon 'Flood' and 
James Cameron's extremly expensive 'Titanic'</P>
<P>I'll say first off I enjoyed 'Volcano' much more than I did 'Dantes 
Peak'. Part of that is just being biased as I usually enjoy anything 
that Tommy Lee Jones appears in. </P>
<P>I've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and 
really didn't see or think that once during the entire film. I get 
bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute. Another thing, 
and boy am I bitching today!, that bothers me is when critics and such 
go on about "Well thats not really possible." You know what? I 
couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not, really I 
couldn't. It's a freaking movie and I don't WANT reality thrown in my 
face. I want to be able to see the impossible, the all might "WHAT IF" 
to many reviewers have seen one to many movies!</P>
<P>The special effects are the second star to this feature. They are so 
amazing that I found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed FX 
and LA was was not burning to the ground. They did an incredible job 
and come Oscar time (if they remember) some notice better be thrown 
there way.</P>
