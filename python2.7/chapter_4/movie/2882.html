                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     In the world of Science Fiction. it is "known" that you cannot
witness future events by going ahead in time.  However, it is also
"obvious" that you can go back and witness events that have happened in
the past.  And if you can do that, you can change an event so that what
follows will be changed, too.  If you go back and kill a grandparent of
someone you know in the present, that person will then not be born and
you have changed the course of events.  In that manner, traveling to
the past and altering events would allow for a new kind of criminal.</P>
<P>     Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a timecop in the year 2004
who works for the Time Enforcement Commission that prohibits going back
which by that time had become a reality.  When Senator McComb (Ron
Silver) goes back in time to change events and become rich and enable
him to run for president in the present, It is Walker's mission to
prevent McComb from changing the past.  Going back in time with him is
Sarah Fielding (Gloria Reuben). who also works for the Time Enforcement
Commission.</P>
<P>     When Walker travels to the past, he meets Melissa (Mia Sara) who
in the present was his wife but who was murdered.  Now Walker realizes
he can change the events that led to her murder and they can thus live
happily ever after.  (Still with me?)</P>
<P>     As in all the action films, this one is filled with shootings and
gore.  The only difference is that it has time-travel as its gimmick.
No matter how you slice it, it is still an action film and it is still
Science Fiction.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Peter Hyams.
