<P>Jon Avnet's new film is an interesting and entertaining indictment of
the Legal system of Mainland China. Richard Gere plays Jack Moore, a
legal representative for an American satellite corporation hoping to
open up broadcasting opportunities in Beijing. Jack has worked with
officials of the Communist government before and is well liked and
respected. His charm and ability to communicate with those of differing
ideologies is considered honorable and imaginative. While setting up the
final proposals for the broadcasting rights, Jack meets a beautiful
Chinese Model at a fashion show. He is attracted to her, as she is to
him. A tryst develops, playfully erotic, growing into something more.</P>
<P>The neXt morning, Jack is awakened by the rough handling of the Red
Guard. The Model has been brutally murdered. Jack's shirt and chest are
covered in her blood. The Guards investigate the scene and place Jack
immediately under arrest. At his interrogation, he is told that there is
compassion for those who confess, but severity for those who resist. He
is assigned an Attorney, Yuelin (played by Chinese actress Bai Ling),
who urges him to confess to the crime to save his life. Jack steadfastly
refuses forcing Yuelin to investigate the case more that certain
individuals would like.</P>
<P>Red Corner is a strong film, with marvelous moments and a superior
central performance by Bai Ling as Yuelin. Richard Gere handles his role
as Jack Moore well enough, but doesn't really come to life until about
midway through the film. His portrait of righteous indignation at the
beginning of the film, while acceptable, doesn't give the film a strong
enough emotional core to hang on. As a character ark, Jack really
doesn't have a drastic enough change in his attitude to foster much
audience sympathy. Even when telling of the death of his wife and child,
you feel no pain for the character, as his burying of those emotions
makes it hard for the audience to really feel his plight.</P>
<P>And his plight is a hard one indeed. One of the most interesting images
in the film is of nameless guards looking in on Gere as he sits in his
darkened cell, the only light, is coming through a narrow slit in the
cell door. The feeling of isolation and invasion  permeates the film.
The main set, a libertine maze of streets and alleys that makes you feel
there are many secrets here, many lies that will never be resolved. The
first scene of the film, of Jack being photographed by a surveillance
video camera sets the tone for the film perfectly. He is no longer in
control of his own life. It is now controlled by the State. A State to
which he has no allegiance.</P>
<P>Gere's performance is workman-like and not as strong as some of his best
performances (Officer & a Gentleman, Internal Affairs). It's almost as
if he is trying to separate performance from his own personal
convictions (as his are now well known). It could be said that Jack
Moore is a man who's convictions are greater than his own life. But that
conceit seems trivial in the face of the overwhelming danger the
character faces. It is only in his scenes with Bai Ling, that Gere comes
to life. There is an honest chemistry between the two stars, and
Director Avnet uses it well.</P>
<P>Yuelin, therefore is the center of the film. Bai Ling's performance is
without a doubt one of the best of the year and it would be a shame if
the Academy overlooks her work in this film. She uses every inch of her
body in her performance (a telling moment when finally believing that
Jack may be innocent of the crime, her eyes cannot look directly at him
for long, darting away from one side of his face to his shoulder and
back, a marvelous and subtle performance). We feel the character growing
and changing against her own wishes, facing truths about herself that
she'd rather not.</P>
<P>The script by Robert King and Ron Koslow is taunt and well paced. The
setup and resolution of the crime are well constructed and solidly
delivered. The trial is presented in an interesting manner, showing not
the usual trickery of where a well placed argument convinces everyone of
the truth. Here, the accused is guilty, an idea of Chinese law
unfathomable to Westerners. These are presented mater of factly without
the usual hyperbole associated with thrillers of this type. The
political aspects of the film are given rather cursory explanation,
Chinese view Westerners as primitive sophisticates, with no thought or
conscience. In prison Jack is treated like a dog, an animal that would
have no thought as to weather it should eat it's own feces. This is
reinforced in a scene where, during Jack's escape, he hides in a small
animal pen, unnoticed by the Guards standing over him.</P>
<P>Director Avnet manages the film well. He is not intrusive in his style
in the way of the MTV style. Avnet uses his camera to  frame reality,
without resorting to stylized angles or tracking. The film is actually
rather standard, looking at times almost like a Television drama,
(similar too 'Fried Green Tomatoes'). The cinematography by Karl Walter
Lindenlaub is very straight forward, using  the 1.85:1 framing of the
film to give a feeling of intimacy and claustrophobia. Even the visual
effects by DIGITAL DOMAIN are unobtrusive, convincing us that we are
actually in China. You will not notice the effects as they are seamless,
the film was not shot in China, but rather in areas around Southern
California. All of the backgrounds are CGI or miniatures. The very fact
that the effects do not call attention to themselves  ensures that the
effects team will be ignored come Oscar. time.</P>
<P>This is Avnet's best film since 'Fried Green Tomatoes'. 'Red Corner' is
not a great film. It is flawed. But it's flaws show a heart and
willingness to tell a story that most films today seem to have
forgotten.</P>
