                        A film review by Dominic Ow
                        Copyright 1997 Flying Inkpot</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Danny Boyle
Produced by: Channel Four Films (aka Film Four International) / Figment
Films/ PolyGram / The Noel Gay Motion Picture Company 
Runtime: About 93 minutes 
Cast: Ewan McGregor (Mark Renton), Ewen Bremner (Spud Murphy), Jonny Lee
Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy)
Rating: ***1/2 out of *****</P>
<P>Whew. This film oozes energy, the kind of breakneck, no-
holds-barred, in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen
on screen these days. Like the marginal, motley bunch of
post-apocalyptic youths director Danny Boyle tries to depict,
TRAINSPOTTING veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately
retains its footing and control. The result: a movie that is a
delightful example of how the medium is the message.</P>
<P>The message: a bunch of losers with loser names, Mark Renton (Ewan
McGregor), Spud (Ewan Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee
Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Bored,
aimless
and restless, their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub,
grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up
the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of
methods, some ingenious, others plainly dumb and desperate. Not part of
the daily dose if obtained, sex is a bonus.</P>
<P>You can find these characters as they are, foul-mouthed, dirty,
pathetic, ugly perhaps but definitely interesting, in Irvin Welsh's cult
novel of the same name. What makes the film a completely different
experience is how director Boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make
the filmic medium synchronous with the message.</P>
<P>One of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart
around restlessly. It'll truck into a character's pimple, just as soon
as
it will dolly out to an establishing shot. Distracted and curious, it'll
maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the
doped-out-eye-view. You'll even find characters peering into the camera,
their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens. This film camera is just
another one of the guys.</P>
<P>Tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality,
Boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across.
Bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have
nightmares. I don't want to give too much away, but if you cross Chuckie
from CHILD'S PLAY with some of the wacky fantasies in HEAVENLY
CREATURES, you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary
the alternate state of consciouness can be. That said, this film
has a good share of drugs - consumed, vomitted, defecated, pissed off,
exchanged, bought, sold, injected, smuggled, enjoyed and regretted. If
that isn't your cup of tea, nobody forced you to see the film. Stay at
home and rent UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.</P>
<P>And what's a buzz without tunes. From Pulp to Iggy Pop (yes, he's
still alive), the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy
permeating the film. Good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting
desires and values of the message. Every once in a while, a film comes
along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity
of its characters it hopes to depict. Trainspotting is that shooting
star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations. </P>
<P>Dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from Northwestern
University's Radio/TV/Film programme not too long ago. He has laboured
on various music videos and short films in and around campus and
Chicago. NOWHERE TOWN, a 26min short film that he shot, co-directed and
co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the Charleston
International Film Festival for best student production. He is currently
finishing a couple of small projects. With his minute amounts of leisure
time, dom does Nell impersonations. </P>
