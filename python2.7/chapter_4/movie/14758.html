<PRE>                      ELIZABETH (British-Indian)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: The first hour is beautifully realized.  In the second
hour the writing gets a little muddled and the style becomes less
original.  Still, this story of the coming to power of Queen Elizabeth
is enthralling.  She is a bit too much a 1990s woman, but the
photography is very good.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Shekhar Kapur.  Unusual to see an Indian directing a
     film about a British monarch.
   - Very powerful telling of the rise to power of Elizabeth I.  The
     first hour was spellbinding.  The director filmed with real power.
     By the second hour the writing had gotten a little muddled.
   - David Hirschfelder (SHINE) provides a very melodic score.
   - Many overhead shots to show the size of the buildings and
     smallness of people.  Photography kept dark.  Many scenes done in
     rich blacks and reds.
   - Somehow reminiscent of a Hieronymous Bosch painting with some of
     its weird and powerful images.
   - False move in showing Elizabeth practice an argument using a
     technique like would be used to show outtakes.  It seems like too
     modern an editing technique.
   - Elizabeth begins as a pawn and learns to fend for herself.
     Deciding best way to be rid of Elizabeth, Queen Mary instructs a
     bishop, "Your Grace will find some proof of her treachery."
   - Very harrowing and haunting scene of an execution by burning.  Do
     not bring young children.
   - Wolsingham (Geoffrey Rush) is Elizabeth's Secret Service and is
     ruthless in protecting her.
   - I like films of this period and few are done as well as ELIZABETH.
   - She may be written a little too much like a modern woman.</P>
