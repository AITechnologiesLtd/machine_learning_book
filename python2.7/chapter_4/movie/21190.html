<PRE>rated R
Artisan Entertainment

starring Terence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzman, Barry

written by Lem Dobbs
directed by Steven Soderbergh</PRE>
<P>Ever since he stormed on to the indie scene in 1989 with `Sex, Lies
and Videotape', director Steven Soderbergh has made films that
stray from the mainstream (`King Of The Hill' and `Gray's
Anatomy' being two of his better efforts). Last year, `Out Of
Sight', his critically acclaimed dark romantic comedy, tanked
during a busy summer at the box office. It was his first studio film.</P>
<P>Probably because of his disappointment, he has returned to his roots
with `The Limey', a strikingly stylish and elegant film noir
fueled by a tour de force performance by Terence Stamp. `The
Limey', shot at times on a handheld camera, is an excellent,
expertly paced movie which entertains and enlightens.</P>
<P>Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, two 60's icons from separate
continents, play enemies caught in the midst of a deadly
predicament. Wilson (Stamp) has just finished a nine-year jail term in
England, and flies out to Los Angeles to avenge the death of his
daughter, Jenny. She reportedly died in a car crash, but Wilson senses
that his headstrong daughter would be too smart to fall asleep at the
wheel.</P>
<P>He is helped by Jenny's two former friends (played by Luis Guzman
and Lesley Ann Warren), and his search leads him to Terry Valentine
(Fonda), a wealthy record exec (and former boyfriend of Jenny's)
whose heart is still in the 60's.</P>
<P>As Wilson continues his odyssey, he dives more deeply into a life of
crime and learns about the daughter he was never there for. Stamp's
fiery performance conveys a yearning to start over, and to have
another chance to bring up his neglected daughter. He will never get
that chance, but he seeks vengeance for her sake.</P>
<P>Steven Soderbergh directs `The Limey' with the maturity of an
Orson Welles.  Refreshingly, `The Limey' doesn't waste time
with inconsequential conversation or subplots. The story-telling is
direct, from first frame to last.</P>
<P>Quick cuts and flashbacks are not used pretentiously, but rather to
further the story. Two conversations may be going on at once, but each
one is clear. The juxtapositions save several minutes of screen
time. A predictable trick would have been to have a romantic subplot
involving Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, but conventionality is not part
of Soderbergh's picture. This is the way films should be made.</P>
<P>Another reason `The Limey' works so well is the way it works the
60's motif into the action. The soundtrack, with songs like
`Magic Carpet Ride' and The Who's `The Seeker', sounds
cool and adds to the mood. Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda may have
seemed past their time, but they end up making tenacious older men.</P>
<P>`The Limey' is not Elmore Leonard `Out Of Sight' material,
because there are no pulp characters and because Lem Dobbs (`Dark
City') gives the actors mature un-Tarantino dialogue. Stamp's
Wilson is driven and mad, recalling many classic noir characters.</P>
<P>The film has more depth than the average thriller, yet the surface
material itself is better than most.  Like in Alexandre Dumas'
`The Count of Monte Cristo', revenge is presented as a noble
deed, despite the crimes involved.</P>
<P>In a bold move, Soderbergh has decided to use real scenes of a younger
Stamp for the flashbacks.  They are taken from `Poor Cow', a
1967 film best known for being the debut of acclaimed British
filmmaker Ken Loach (`My Name Is Joe').</P>
<P>`The Limey' will not be patronized by a large audience (although
Terence Stamp's performance may stir up some buzz), but it is a
satisfying return to form for Steven Soderbergh. It is the kind of
film that can be made only by a veteran, and it may be this
director's finest accomplishment yet.</P>
