<P>Another Christian film with Hollywood-type production values has been
released nationally and once again, it has been pretty much ignored by the
media and critics.</P>
<P>THE OMEGA CODE which is being distributed by Providence Entertainment,
deals with an apocalyptic theme, using the controversial "Bible Code" as a
major plot device.  Despite the lack of a large scale marketing effort and
almost complete snub from both print and online critics, the film did well
enough to place in the top ten films (according to the box office
receipts) in its opening weekend.  This is no doubt due to the on air
support given to the film by Christian broadcasters on TBN.</P>
<P>Certainly the film does not deserve to be ignored, but neither does it
merit rave reviews.  After a promising beginning, it slowly becomes
muddled and confused, lost in its own sea of implausible characters and
transparent plot devices.</P>
<P>Casper Van Dien (STARSHIP TROOPERS) stars as Dr. Gillen Lane,
motivational "guru" and expert on mythology.  His skill in the art of
persuasion is being sought after by Stone Alexander (Michael York, AUSTIN
POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME), millionaire philanthropist and obvious
megalomaniac.  Together they plan to bring the dream of world peace closer
to reality.</P>
<P>Unknown to Gillen, Stone is using a stolen program which unlocks hidden
messages numerically coded within the Bible.  By fulfilling these
prophetic messages, Stone's rise to power increases at a rapid pace.  His
idea of world peace is, in actuality, world domination.  But the final
piece to the code is missing, in the hands of a pair of mysterious
"prophets" who try to warn the world against blindly following the path
that Stone is paving, knowing that it leads away from God and towards
destruction.</P>
<P>Can Gillen, who has begun to have "visions" that he cannot explain,
discover Stone's evil intents in time?  What is the final message of the
Bible Code which has been kept out of Stone's hands?  Both of these are
important questions but not as important as the one which must be asked...
"Why isn't this a better film?"</P>
<P>Part of the answer lies with the script by Hollis Barton and Stephan
Blinn, who between them have no other screen credits.  Instead of
developing fresh and interesting characters, they have relied upon
superficial and clichéd stock characters which stretch the limits of
credibility.</P>
<P>Mr. Van Dien, who looks like a TOP GUN recruiting poster, is hard pressed
to pull off the role asked of him.  He has yet to develop the charisma
that would explain the influence or popularity which his character
supposedly enjoys.</P>
<P>I must be quick to state that I applaud any effort to bring biblically
minded stories to the movies.  And there is much within THE OMEGA CODE
that is noteworthy.  Here we find the idea of an antichrist rising to
power under the guise of philanthropy and altruistic works; the spiritual
struggle which is waged daily;  the superiority of God's power over any
other force, whether it be spiritual or physical; and the idea that each
of us have a choice to make - that as we choose to turn to God for
guidance and protection, God is faithful to guide and protect.</P>
<P>But to this reviewer, the true weakness of the film is the element which
probably appealed the most to the filmmakers.  The "phenomenon" of The
Bible Code (which "predicted" Hitler's rise and Princess Diana's death,
among other events) is an example of a trend that mankind has followed
throughout the centuries.  We, as a people, instead of just reading the
Word which God has revealed, oftentimes prefer to read into the Word.  We
are fascinated by hidden messages and unexplained prophetic-like
inferences.</P>
<P>Such things distract from the true purpose of studying the Word.  God has
given us all things pertaining to life and godliness.  With His Word, we
have the knowledge of how to live a life more than abundant.  Instead of
embracing the Bible Code, we would be better served if we would simply
embrace the Bible.</P>
