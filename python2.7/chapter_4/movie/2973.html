<P>"THE BROWNING VERSION is the story of a man and his wife and the 
school--a triangle set in a beautiful prison.  It is a film about a man 
finding the courage to transcend all the things in his life that conspire 
against him." 
            - Mike Figgis, director of THE BROWNING VERSION </P>
<P>     Call it Merchant/Ivory Lite.  Mike Figgis' remake of the 1951 film
(which, in turn, was based on a 1939 one-act play by Terence Rattigan)
has the look and feel of something that the HOWARDS END
producer/director duo is noted for doing.  In fact, THE BROWNING
VERSION has more than superficial similarities to last year's THE
REMAINS OF THE DAY.</P>
<P>     The title refers to Robert Browning's translation of Aeschylus'
AGEMEMNON, a story which has both symbolic and concrete significance to
the film's plot.  AGEMEMNON happens to be the favorite tale of the main
character, Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney).  Through the years,
his passion for this book, as well as for other classics, has kept him
in teaching.  Now, as a forced retirement (the result of failing health
and perhaps a fossilized soul) approaches, he sees in his own life
similarities to Agememnon's--most notably the faithlessness of his
wife.</P>
<P>     He has been married to Laura (Gretta Scacchi) for fifteen years,
but it's been a long time since they have been happy together.  She has
entered into an affair with visiting American science professor Frank
Hunter (Matthew Modine) while Andrew continues to ferret away his
emotions.  Despite a coldness that earns him a reputation as the
"Hitler of the lower fifth," there is an occasional student that he
makes an positive, lasting impression upon.</P>
<P>     THE BROWNING VERSION does not lack substance, but it is
somnolently-paced and goes virtually nowhere.  Much of the character
interaction is shallow and perfunctory, and almost all the subplots not
directly connected with the main story are unappealing.  Jean Francois
Robin's exemplary camera work can't hide the script's basic
deficiencies.</P>
<P>     The greatest asset of THE BROWNING VERSION, and the man who
singlehandedly rescues this plodding production, is Albert Finney.  His
is a performance to laud, even though it has no chance of a deserved
Oscar nomination (too few people will see THE BROWNING VERSION).  Like
Anthony Hopkins in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, Finney perfectly captures
the frustrating essence of a repressed man with all of his pent-up
emotion bubbling just beneath the surface.  We in the audience have an
irrational urge to shake Andrew until he acts.</P>
<P>     Greta Scacchi is solid, although vastly overshadowed by her
co-star.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast isn't as eye-opening.
Matthew Modine is the personification of blandness and the venerable
Michael Gambon is far from stellar as a stereotypical doddering
headmaster.  Julian Sands, in a small role as Andrew's replacement, is
ineffectual enough to blend with the scenery.</P>
<P>     Figgis is adept in fashioning several heartwrenching moments
during THE BROWNING VERSION, all of which are lent their potency
through the strength of Finney's acting.  The climactic speech, which
is meant to be cathartic, verges on a SCENT OF A WOMAN-like overkill.
Figgis and Finney, however, manage to keep things barely on the right
side of the "cornball" line, allowing the scene to accomplish what is
intended.</P>
<P>     Though set in the 1990s, THE BROWNING VERSION has the feel of a
period piece.  Without Albert Finney, no amount of upper class British
posturing would have made a difference to the final product.  With him,
however, we are treated to a rare example of transcendent
characterization--an individual who can make a mediocre motion picture
worth a look.</P>
