<P>Well, look here -- it's a movie from Hollywood that actually defends
pornography! In this day and age when the whining and crying over
sexual content in the media -- especially "newer" media such as the
Net -- seems to be reaching an all-time Pinkness saturation, we
finally get a movie that comes out and says "This is porn, a lot of
people want to see it, and by God, we've got a right to make porn
available to people who want to see it!" It's about damn time we got a
movie that makes a sensible statement like that. The movie's far from
perfect -- it's a typical Hollywood whitewashing of the porn
controversy, a simple black-and-white, good-vs.-evil story -- but
hell, it's still a lot of fun to watch, and at least it says something
about our culture. You'll get more good Slack from this movie than you
will from EVITA or DANTE'S PEAK.</P>
<P>As you've probably heard, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is supposedly the
story of Larry Flynt, the owner of a few strip bars and publisher of a
sleazy skin magazine who happened to get lucky: he acquired nude
photos of Jackie Onassis and published them in his rag. That caused a
national sensation, and he rode the wave of infamy to build his baby,
Hustler, into a huge publishing empire. (If THAT'S not Slack, tell me
what is! ) Of course, you have to remember that this is a Hollywood
story, and it's aimed at mainstream audiences -- i.e. the Pink masses
who hate to THINK. So the makers of this movie (Director Milos Forman,
who made ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST -- and producer Oliver Stone,
that egotistic jerk who thinks every one of his movies has to be an
Important Wake-Up Call To America) dumbed it down and made Larry Flynt
into a Hollywood Good Guy. He's a clean, straight, good ol' boy who
loves his wife dearly and just wants to turn an honest profit...and he
just happens to be in the business of publishing dirty pictures.
Right. And I just happen to be J.R. "Bob" Dobbs' legitimate son and
heir, too. Needless to say, the real-life story probably has as much
to do with this movie as the movie JFK had to do with the real Kennedy
assassination -- i.e. little to none -- but hell, at least Woody
Harrelson (who plays Flynt) manages to have a lot of fun with the role
and get away with pulling some fine stunts on film. It's fun to watch
as Flynt tells his photographer to forget trying to be "arty" and just
go for hard-core smut.</P>
<P>There's one great scene where Flynt is standing in front of a huge
movie scene, making a sermonizing speech about the First Amendment and
the right to publish porn; as he says this, the movie screen is
illustrating the difference between pictures of war and murder (which
nobody seems to mind publishing), and sex (which gets people upset for
some reason). It's a great visualization of the classic defense of
pornography, namely: "Why is it okay to show pictures of murder and
suffering, but not okay to show pictures of people having sex and
enjoying themselves doing it?"</P>
<P>It's a simple message, and frankly this is a simple movie. We've got
good guy Larry Flynt, crusading to bring his porn to the grocery
stores of America. For bad guys we've got the usual enemies: Jerry
Falwell and the Moral Majority, and the other fat old white men who
wield all the power in government, and who usually play the role of
the bad guys in movies of this sort. (Falwell sued Flynt after Hustler
made fun of him by publishing an alleged "story" of Falwell having sex
with his mother in an outhouse.) There's no exception here: The rich
old white men in suits all hate this evil, disgusting filth, and the
movie emphasizes their hypocrisy by using Charles Keating as a major
player in the anti-porn crowd. (Keating was the central figure in the
nationwide savings-and-loan scandal of the late 1980s, which cost the
taxpayers over two billion dollars.)</P>
<P>So it's a simple "good" (Flynt) vs. "evil" (Falwell) story. But, the
movie's still a hell of a lot of fun, and Larry Flynt is such an
outrageous figure that even Hollywood can't tame him. He wanted
Hustler to be as lewd, shocking, and offensive as possible, and this
movie has the good sense to give us at least a few glimpses into that
milieu.</P>
<P>We get a lot of laughs (mostly from Flynt's antics at bucking the
"establishment"), we get some great gags (mostly taken from the pages
of Hustler itself -- wait till you see what they do with Santa Claus
and the Wizard of Oz), AND we get a knockout performance by Courtney
Love, who plays Flynt's drugged-out wife Althea. Courtney is
everything Madonna ever wanted to be -- namely, a real actress -- and
she's a wonder to look at. She also does a striptease, so you folks
who want to use this movie as an excuse to look at some naked women
won't be disappointed either. Whether she's posing for her husband (or
the photographer), or getting zonked out on Flynt's "pain killers,"
she steals every scene she's in. You can't help but watch her, even
when she's getting thin and pale.</P>
<P>You can tell Oliver Stone produced this movie because of the two
mysterious "conspiracies" that never really get resolved, one of them
involving the would-be assassin who paralyzed Flynt from the waist
down and confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. But
fortunately, director Forman know how to tell a story without beating
the audience over the head with it (Stone's forte), so we don't mind
the fact that this movie is trying to force its "porn is good" message
down our throats. It even gets wimpy at one point, when Flynt finds
religion and tries to turn over a new leaf (sort of)...but that
doesn't last long.</P>
<P>Hollywood (and Sony Pictures, the distributors) is raining praise on
this movie as a way of trying to show us they can "take a stand" over
a supposedly controversial issue. Bull. If this movie was made at an
independent studio with about 1/10 of the budget, it would probably be
the scathing, vicious attack on "the establishment" it wants to
be...but then it would be rated NC-17 (which is still box-office
death) and it would barely reach 1/10 of the audience it's reaching
now. The original poster for this movie had an image of Harrelson
wearing a diaper made of an American flag, crucified between a woman's
legs...but Sony decided that image was too "controversial" and they
pulled it in favor of the much tamer image we see on the movie posters
now (Harrelson's face, with a flag covering his mouth). That's the
true face of Hollywood, which is (as always) dominated by the
Conspiracy: it's afraid of real controversy, and it pulls back in the
face of anything really daring and produces a pale facade instead.</P>
<P>But, nonetheless, we've still got a fun, intelligent movie from
Hollywood that tells us that people like looking at dirty pictures,
and by God, we've got a right to see those dirty pictures! So even if
it's not a perfect movie, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is still worth
seeing. It's a movie with its mouth in the right place. It reveals a
lot more about Hollywood than Hollywood realizes...but then, that's
why Hollywood is Hollywood and we are SubGenii. They've got the
MONEY...and we've got the SLACK.</P>
<PRE>And so does this movie.</PRE>
