<PRE>                           GRUMPIER OLD MEN
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Directed by Howard Deutch
Cast Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess
Meredith, Daryl Hannah, Kevin Pollak.
Written by Mark Steven Johnson</P>
<P>These grumpy old men keep getting older and crankier with fewer excuses
for abusing each other and getting laid.</P>
<P>The personal mini-war between 'Putz' and 'Moron', played respectively by
Lemmon and Mathau is temporarily on hold because their children (Pollak
and Hannah) are getting married. Now that their avenue for playing
childish pranks on each other is closed, they divert their foolery
towards the unsuspecting Maria (Loren), the new gal in town who has
taken over the old bait shop to open a classy Italian restaurant on the
waterfront.</P>
<P>Loren plays the sultry, Italian lass with the same fire and spirit which
made her famous in 'House Boat'. She rubs cold water and ice over her
breasts as she tempts Matthau's character to leave her restaurant alone;
then invites him over for dinner where they discuss the bisexual organs
of the earth worm resulting in the urge to go worm hunting after desert;
she giggles like a school girl as they fumble in the dark before falling
conveniently onto the moist soil where they start --.. well -- you can
only imagine what happens next.</P>
<P>Although this is not the most romantic way to court a woman, it is
certainly one of the more inventive. What can you say when Matthau's
character takes sexual advise from "Geraldo" and buys gifts for his
girlfriend on the home shopping net work.</P>
<P>The kids eventually call the wedding off because of the overwhelming
meddling of their respective father into their private affairs. As a
result second world war erupts between 'Putz' and 'Moron' in Minnesota,
and it requires the death of Grandpa Gustafson (played by the delightful
Burgess Meredith) to bring everyone back to focus on the more important
issues of life.</P>
<P>Yes there are better things to do in life than to banter over the size
of one's manhood, accuse another's sister of having crabs or getting
laid when it is way pass your bed time.</P>
<PRE>However, this movie did make me laugh!</PRE>
<P>Comment: Diverting entertainment for the elderly with lots of sex
between grandmothers and grandfathers.</P>
