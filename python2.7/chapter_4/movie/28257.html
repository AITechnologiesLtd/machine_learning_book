<P>Susan Granger's review of "PEARL HARBOR" (Disney/Touchstone Pictures)</P>
<P>          It's a glossy, three-hour, epic love story about the loss of 
innocence, set around the tragedy of "the day which will live in infamy," 
according to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Jon Voight). And at $140+ 
million, it's also the most expensive movie ever made. So, is it a patriotic 
blockbuster? Yes. Is it an Oscar-contender, like "Titanic," its obvious 
inspiration? No. </P>
<P>  Written by Randall Wallace ("Braveheart"), directed by Michael Bay 
("Armageddon") and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, "Pearl Harbor" delivers 
primarily in the violent, realistic action sequences: the Japanese sneak 
attack on the U.S. fleet on the fateful morning of December 7, 1941. Planes 
swoop in. Bombs explode. Battleships sink. Machine guns fire. </P>
<P>   The two-pilots-and-a-Navy nurse love story fares less well. Ben 
Affleck and Josh Hartnett are boyhood pals who fall in love with the same 
woman, Kate Beckinsale. Affleck meets her at an Army induction center, where 
she inoculates his bare rump - twice. Romance ignites and blazes until his 
plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain. In Hawaii, Hartnett, delivers 
the news to Beckinsale and soon they find passion under the parachutes in an 
airfield hangar. But Affleck's not dead, and Beckinsale's pregnant. If it 
sounds trite, sappy and prosaic, it is. Without high drama or sentimentality, 
there's an emotional detachment, and it takes Col. James Doolittle's (Alec 
Baldwin) Tokyo raid, four months later, to resolve their destiny. But Cuba 
Gooding Jr is charismatic as cook who shot down Japanese Zeros and was the 
first African-American awarded the Navy Cross; too bad his part is so 
truncated. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Pearl Harbor" is an 
stunning, explosive 6. It's a contrived, commercial war movie. If you want 
accurate history, rent "Tora, Tora, Tora."</P>
