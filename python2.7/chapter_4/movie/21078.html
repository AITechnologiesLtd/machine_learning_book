Grade: D-</P>
<P>In "The 13th Warrior," Arab poet Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) finds
himself kicked out of Baghdad for feeling up the king's old lady.  With his
translator (screen legend Omar Sharif in a small role), Ahmed heads north to
act as ambassador to the Northmen (Vikings).  He finds a group of warriors
mourning the loss of their king.  A messenger soon arrives from another kingdom
requesting assistance.  A soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer
the summons, twelve Northmen and one outsider.  Thus, Ahmed becomes the "13th
warrior."  </P>
<P>On the trip, Ahmed manages to learn the Vikings' language by listening to their
fireside conversations.  A bit far-fetched, it's true, but we have to swallow
it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the
grunting.  Ahmed, who's called "Ibn" by the Vikings, forms friendships with
Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhøi) and the Viking leader Buliwyf (Vladimir
Kulich).</P>
<P>When they arrive in the other kingdom, the thirteen warriors discover that
they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves. 
Hereafter, most of the movie is battle scenes:  the cannibals attack the
Vikings, the Vikings attack the cannibals, the cannibals attack the . . . well,
you get the idea.  Just to add some action, there's also a Viking vs. Viking
duel.</P>
<P>Other movies insert scenes between the fights; these scenes are called
character development.  I suspect that "The 13th Warrior" had a better script
at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team
direction.  The movie started off in the hands of John McTiernan (you'll notice
a lot of similarities between "Warrior" and McTiernan's "Predator," including
the chittering jungle sounds).  Somewhere along the line, McTiernan bailed and
Michael Crichton took over.  Crichton, whose novel "Eaters of the Dead" is the
basis for "Warrior," has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction
"thrillers":  "Westworld," "Coma," "Looker," "Runaway."  Their result of their
consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie.</P>
<P>Perhaps what "The 13th Warrior" needs more than anything else is a villain. 
The "eaters of the dead" are a faceless mob in blackface.  They have no
personality, and by the end they don't even seem particularly threatening.  The
audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression.  McTiernan
should know about the importance of an interesting villain; it was his "Die
Hard" that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil
roles in action films.</P>
<P>"The 13th Warrior" suffers from a lack of vision.  It wants to be "Predator"
meets "Braveheart" meets "The Magnificent Seven" meets "Dances with Wolves." 
With so many competing goals, all it can do is echo what it might have been. 
It might have been a satisfying action film.  It might have been a
beautifully-rendered medieval epic.  It might have been a thought-provoking
examination of the meeting of cultures.  What a shame it turned out to be
nothing in particular.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  If you want to see Antonio swing his sword, rent "The Mask of
Zorro."</P>
