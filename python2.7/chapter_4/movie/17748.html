<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>The first immediately impressive aspect of The Matrix is its spectacular
visual style, the second its fascinating story line.  Directors/writers
Larry and Andy Wachowski have made a dark and often chilling Sci Fi
piece; one that sucks its audience into an incredible futuristic world
and never relents until the final credits roll.  Kudos to the
Wachowski's for providing enough intrigue to disguise some of the film's
weaker moments; intrigue that is created not just from clever scripting
but also from testosterone charged performances.  Keanu Reeves and
Australian Hugo Weaving are exhilarating opponents who face off towards
the end in a few breathtaking action sequences.   Like in 1998's Dark
City, there are significant holes in the plot, but none that can't be
overshadowed by the nightmarish atmosphere that is evoked.  In fact, The
Matrix often feels like a bad dream sweetened by amusing (although
derivative) subplots.</P>
<P>Posters, theatrical trailers and even the film's web site pose the same
question: what is The Matrix?  Well, that would be telling.  Since much
of the interest in this film comes from not knowing what it is about for
a lengthy period, it would be unfair to reveal the diagnostics.  Thomas
Anderson (Keanu Reeves) - a computer hacker known as "Neo" - is told
that he is "the one;" a man who will free the human race from the
clutches of The Matrix.  Anderson joins rebel-warriors Morpheus
(Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) in a journey across
time and reality, all the while battling a group known as "the agents,"
led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).</P>
<P>If that synopsis sounds a little silly, rest assured that the basic
story line makes a reasonable amount of sense.  Bit by bit, we are
eventually told what is wrong with the seemingly ordinary world our
characters are based in, and yes - what The Matrix is.  At more than one
stage I was reminded of "The Force" - The Matrix is also a power that
can be manipulated to the hero's advantage.  Anderson undergoes
Skywalker-esque training, and these scenes provide great bits of martial
arts action and daring stunts including roof-to-roof leaps.  Morpheus is
our Yoda, and he has the right amount of wisdom and courage thanks to
Laurence Fishburne's enigmatic presence.</P>
<P>Filmed and edited entirely in Sydney, The Matrix will help put Australia
on the map as one of the best places in the world to make movies.  It is
rare for special effects to aid story as much as they do here, and it is
equally rare for a Sci Fi blockbuster to build as much premise and
intrigue as this one.  The Matrix is not only a crowd-pleasing success -
it is a fascinating look at reality and how it is perceived.  No doubt
this film, like The Truman Show, will make us look at our world in a
suspicious new light.</P>
