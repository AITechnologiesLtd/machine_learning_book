"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>It's tough to anticipate what to expect from a film with this much
baggage.  Throughout the production of Shaft – a remake/sequel of the
1971 blaxploitation film of the same name – reports surfaced almost
daily about ugly name-calling incidents between has-been director John
Singleton (Rosewood), star and Gardenburger pitchman Samuel L. Jackson
(Rules of Engagement) and cracker screenwriter Richard Price (Ransom).</P>
<P>The good news is that the theme song isn't messed up.  My greatest fear
was that on-his-fourteenth-minute-of-fame song-stealer Sean `No-Talent'
Combs would be tapped to hip the thing up with samples from Steppenwolf
and Kenny Rogers, in the way that frat-boy-date-rape rockers Limp Bizkit
ruined the M:I-2 theme.  The bad news is that the remake wasn't campy in
the slightest, which is how I would have approached the film - you know,
with really cheesy action sequences and bad guys with big, white top
hats, furry white coats, glass canes and ... wait; I'm describing P.
Diddy.  Shaft plays like a conventional action flick, which to me was
just disappointing.</P>
<P>The story involves a bar altercation where Walter Williams (Christian
Bale, American Psycho), the racist son of a New York City bigwig, offs a
young black man.  The case, which is caught by Detective John Shaft
(Jackson) hinges on the testimony of a waitress named Diane (Toni
Collette, The Sixth Sense) that may have witnessed the murder, but she
disappears.  Williams uses his connections to get a bargain-rate bail,
skips town and ends up in Switzerland.</P>
<P>The film flashes forward two years, where Shaft is still trying to hunt
down Diane, but catches wind that Williams is coming back to the
States.  Throw in a drug dealer named Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright,
Ride With the Devil), and you've got more story that an average action
film can probably handle.  You know this is the case when you realize
that Diane has been on the run for two years yet hasn't even left the
Bronx.  When Shaft is kicking ass, the film is great, but when he's not,
it really drags.  The resulting effect is a choppy and uneven viewing
experience.</P>
<P>On the plus side, ain't nobody in the world can say `motherfucker' like
Sammy J.  He's built a whole career around being able to deliver that
one word really well, and he throws it around quite often here.  I'd pay
twenty bucks just to have him say it right in my face.  Hell, it's
cheaper than an all-day pass to Six Flags, and probably at least twice
as scary as whatever their new ride is this year.  Can Jackson/Shaft
kick ass?  Lord, yes, but he could have kicked a lot more.  I would have
liked more fisticuffs as opposed to the standard gunplay that ran
rampant throughout the film.</P>
<P>Also worth mentioning are Collette's amazing Bronx accent (she's
Australian) and the hysterically over-the-top and nearly unrecognizable
performance from Wright, who may be one of the screen's best bad guys in
some time.  Bale nails his pretentious white prick role, but that seems
to be what everyone thinks about him anyway.  And big-mouth rapper Busta
Rhymes does an admirable job playing Shaft's wisecracking sidekick.
Also appearing in Shaft are Vanessa L. Williams (Light It Up), Dan
Hedaya (The Hurricane), Lee Tergesen (Oz), Gloria Reuben (ER) and
Richard Roundtree (Steel), the star of the original film, who plays
Shaft's Uncle John.</P>
<P>1:42 - R for strong violence and language</P>
