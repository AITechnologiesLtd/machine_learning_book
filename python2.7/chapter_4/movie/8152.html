<P>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1990, PG, 95 minutes [1 hour, 35 minutes]
[adventure]
starring: Judith Hoag (April O'Neil), Elias Koteas (Casey Jones), Josh Pais
(voice of Raphael), Corey Feldman (voice of Donatello), Robbie Rist (voice of
Michelanglo), Brain Tochi (voice of Leonardo), produced by Kim Dawson, Simon
Fields, David Chan, written by Todd W. Langen, Bobby Herbeck, directed by
Steve Barron, based on the comic book and characters created by Kevin Eastman
and Peter Laird.</P>
<P>Now this is a first. For once, Hollywood was able to make a movie based on a
popular [children's] trend that is not total stupidity. In fact, "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles" is really quite original as it combines some of the
gritty elements from the comic book with storylines from the animated series
to tell a lighthearted, campy story.</P>
<P>The setting takes place in New York City where some kind of invisible crime
wave going on. As we hear the voice of journalist April O'Neil (Hoag)
describe the situation, we see for ourselves just how masterminded the
criminals are. Surprisingly, they are teenagers with the stealth and other
abilities of ninjas. As April leaves she is mugged by some of the thieves,
but they become victims themselves  when someone puts out the lights and
disarms them. Of course we know it's the turtles and we then proceed to
follow them home and learn a bit about them. </P>
<P>The TMNTs are four, huge, mutated turtles who wear masks and are obviously
ninjas. They live in the sewers with their mentor, a mutated rat named
Splinter. The only problem is the story tries to counter the turtles'
hyperness with the serious, metaphoric words of their sensi. One minute
Splinter is giving an important analogy or proverb (a la Yoda in "The Empire
Strikes Back"), and the next minute the guys are partying... but then again,
they are teenagers.</P>
<P>Through some good cop-out devices, April finds herself warned by the Foot
Clan (the perpetrators of the crime wave) to "shut it." She then meets the
turtles after Raphael comes to her rescue. We also learn about the Foot's
secret headquarters through a character with ties to April. There isn't much
here in terms of explaining the genius of the criminal organization or why
they are committing so much theft, just the fact they are ninjas, and
therefore invisible, seems to be reason enough.</P>
<P>The Foot learns about the turtles, and kidnaps their master, and thus fight
scenes ensue and a plot of sorts begins to form. We get good characterization
of the turtles though, they are quite human in their personalities and
actually likable because they don't seem like big cartoons. In fact, the
general attitude of the film works like this as a whole. Yes, sometimes the
script provides for fight scenes but there is actually a story and a fun
spirit to it all. </P>
<P>If the film succeeds in any way, it would have to be the cleverly scripted
and well choreographed fight scenes. They are hilarious because of the way
the turtles fight, using household objects and all the while exclaiming
wisecracks and one-liners. The violence isn't even graphic, but portrayed in
such a way that we know who's winning.</P>
<P>I don't have to tell you how the film ends, it's typical but somewhat
suspenseful. Considering all the elements that make up and surround the film,
this is really quite an accomplishment.</P>
<P>Even if "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is  just an exploitative children's
film, the fact remains it has a decent story to tie it all together. Its
lightheartedness gives it the charm those other adventure flicks miss. </P>
