<PRE>'Blues Brothers 2000'</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Usually I don't compare sequels to their original.  This is an exception
to the rule because 18 years have passed between two films and you
instinctively will draw comparisons this time.  It's unavoidable.</P>
<P>You can't go home again.  Not true for all sequels but certainly for the
ones that try and top an established classic, especially when the
original classic has 18 years to gain status.  Jack Nicholson waited 16
years to make 'The Two Jakes', the sequel to 1974's 'Chinatown'.  It
failed.  James Cameron, currently riding high with the eventual Best
Picture Oscar winner for 1997, 'Titanic', made 'Aliens' in 1986 and it
topped the rather cerebral original 'Alien' from 1979.  The 'Star Wars'
franchise only had three years between all three films and the films
that followed the original 'Star Wars' weren't as good but they were
very close.</P>
<P>1980's 'The Blues Brothers' still defines itself as a cult classic with
a nutty blend of music, action, humour and cleverness and while that
film was original in its big screen concept, based of course on the
'Saturday Night Live' sketch, it still has a watchable presence which is
timeless.</P>
<P>'Blues Brothers 2000' doesn't understand that in order to make a sequel
work, you have to offer the same feeling of the original with a
different story.  This film couldn't be more different than the
original.  The film is almost totally lacking in action, it has TOO MUCH
music and not enough laughs, excitement, and it feels like a paper
weight laying still.</P>
<P>Why it's called 'Blues Brothers 2000' is a mystery to me.  Nobody in the
film is related and putting their band back together this time serves no
purpose.  The original had them putting the band back together to raise
money for the taxes due on a Catholic orphanage, but this time, there's
no reason to put it back together and no one cares.  This is a story
that didn't need to be told.  The original had all you could ask for.
Jake and Elwood were pursued by all the enemies you didn't want.  The
police, the army, rednecks, Nazis and even a scorned woman.  The premise
was so absurd that the way the films characteristics were shaped, it all
worked.</P>
<P>Jake Blues (John Belushi) is dead, in real life of course but also in
the story.  His brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) has been released from
prison after 18 years (remember the end of the original?) and he
searches for something to do with his life.  He visits 'The Penguin'
(Kathleen Freeman), the nun who raised him years ago in her orphanage.
She insists that Elwood be a mentor to 10 year old Buster (J. Evan
Bonifant) and later in the film, Elwood takes on two other members of
the band he will put together (John Goodman and Joe Morton).  Morton is
a commander with the Illinois State Police but later becomes a Blues
Brother when he "sees the light", literally.  Elwood also tracks down
other members of the band from the first film and they do it all again.</P>
<P>The film's music is by Paul Shaffer.  How did David Letterman's barely
passable sidekick get this assignment?  The film must have had a limited
budget which explains its lack of action and lack of memorable songs.</P>
<P>'Blues Brothers 2000' was directed by John Landis, who made the first
one and the picture is written by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis.  The two
of them wrote the original.</P>
<P>Many appearances made by celebrities and original cast members here have
far less bite than the original and the characters are reduced to
caricatures, especially in the case of John Goodman and it's actually
embarrassing at times.  So much so that the film's 122 minutes seem much
longer.</P>
