<PRE>                             THE SPECIALIST
                       A film review by Alex Siegel
                        Copyright 1994 Alex Siegel</PRE>
<P>     In THE SPECIALIST, Sylvester Stallone plays a ex-CIA demolitions
expert, who is now a kinder, gentler hitman.  Sharon Stone plays the
femme fatal, and James Woods plays the buddy gone bad.</P>
<P>     Let me start by saying that this was a really bad movie.  I'm not
kidding around here, I've seen my share of lemons in my day, and this
one was a true dog.  What, you may ask, made it so bad?  A whole lot of
things.</P>
<P>     First off, the script was laughable.  Rambling, incoherent,
uneven, it badly needed a few more passes through the typewriter.  In
particular, the dialog was criminal.  It's been a long time since I've
heard so many wooden lines strung together within the space of two
hours.  Ironically, the only character who came off as vaguely real was
the drug lord.  At least he had more than one emotion at his disposal.</P>
<P>     The acting was was also poor, which is surprising considering that
this is a veteran cast.  Stallone, who has never had great range, was
particularly uninteresting here.  Even in the action scenes, he seemed
tired and bored.  Woods demonstrates a range of emotion: from vague
hostility to full temper tantrum.  Stone looks somewhat distressed from
beginning to end, and never breaks into a smile.  Maybe she was
thinking about what this movie will do to her fragile career.</P>
<P>     But there's more.  The production values were very uneven.  In
almost every scene, the lighting was bad, or the sound was off.  Even
the explosions (and there were plenty) seemed half-hearted.  At times,
it looked downright amateurish.  Maybe they were under a tight
deadline, or maybe they just didn't care.  In any event, the director
should start looking for another line of work.  It's interesting that
Ed Wood opened on the same night.  Just a coincidence, I suppose.</P>
<P>     A few bits in particular deserve honorable mention.  There is a
long love scene in the middle that almost had me laughing out loud.
The only word that fits is "comical."  If real people had sex like these
two, there would be a lot fewer babies in the world.  The low point of
the movie had to be the fight on the bus.  Embarrassing.  Throughout
the scene, I couldn't shake the sensation that I'd seen it before, in
about a thousand other cheap action flicks.  Whoever decided to include
the pregnant woman should be shot.</P>
<P>     It's hard to think of another movie to compare this one too.
CABIN BOY, HIGHLANDER II, BARBARIAN QUEEN, THE PERILS OF GWENDOLYN.
These too were a frontal assault on our intelligence.  Maybe some of
the "Sea Quest" episodes.  The mind boggles, and the stomach churns.</P>
<P>     That's enough ranting.  To conclude, THE SPECIALIST is bad,
boring, and bad.  Don't see it, ever.</P>
