<PRE>                             TITAN A.E.
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: By rights this film should become
          a milestone.  TITAN A.E.  recreates much of the
          feeling of awe I had when the first STAR WARS
          film was released.  This is a space opera writ
          large.  In the 31st century aliens have
          destroyed Earth.  Humans and aliens race to find
          the spaceship Titan which holds the key to the
          survival of the human race.  That kind of plot
          can be a lot of fun if done well.  TITAN A.E.
          does it well.  Rating: 9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     The year I got frustrated with animation was 1973.  That was
the year that two events coincided.  One was the release of the
French film FANTASTIC PLANET.  The other was NBC running an animated
Star Trek series in its Saturday morning line-up.  The former had
some fascinating images of strange animals and plants in an imagined
world, but the script was obscure, static, and emotionally cold.
Ultimately it was very disappointing.  At the same time the animated
STAR TREK TV series used limited animation and even more limited
imagination in the artwork.  As I told friends that in animation you
have to put up 24 frames a second, but it is not like live action.
You have complete freedom as to what you put in those frames.
Somebody somewhere was making the decision that the images in those
frames would be unimaginative and boring, that the alien world where
Kirk was standing would be represented by a horizontal line at the
bottom of the screen.  Even with an example like FANTASTIC PLANET to
show what could be done to show some imagination, nobody did.</P>
<P>     When Japanese anime came along I thought that film was finally
starting to use the potential of animated film.  And it was a step
closer to what I was looking for but in spite of its many advocates,
I think anime cinema has turned into a colossal disappointment.  The
films are full of under-developed characters and over-extended
chases and fights.  If you do not care about the characters, you do
not care who wins the fights.  That brings seeing the film down to
the level of watching professional wrestling.  And in spite of
claims to the contrary Japanese animation is not good.  Generally in
anime that animation is crude and jerky.  What people are responding
to is the occasional quality of the artwork.</P>
<P>     TITAN A.E. much closer to what I had in mind.  The is solid
space opera in the classic tradition of writers like Gordon Dickson
and Alan Dean Foster.  In addition the animation is good and the
artwork extremely imaginative.  With the artwork, the humor, and the
animation, there are no dead spots in the film.  This is a film that
you turn away from at your own risk.  Do not go out for popcorn.</P>
<P>     In the early days of the 31st century a discovery is made that
could change the future for everybody on the planet Earth.  Whatever
that discovery was (and we never find out precisely) it threatens an
alien race called the Drej.  The Drej respond to the threat by
destroying Earth in 3028 A.D.  Only handfuls of people make it off
the planet before it is destroyed.  Scientist Sam Tucker arranges
for his five-year-old son Cale to be taken to safety and then pilots
the huge spherical starship Titan into space just in time to escape
the dying Earth.  Fifteen years later Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) is
a piece of space flotsam.  He is working in an interplanetary space
dump with the dregs of several alien races.  The shadowy human Korso
(Bill Pullman) tags Cale for a mysterious mission to go and find the
Titan.</P>
<P>     So far it seems like a space opera primarily aimed at a teen
audience.  That is exactly what it remains, but then so was STAR
WARS.  The point is that it is space opera well done.  The
screenwriters are an eclectic bunch with Ben Edlund creator of the
satire "The Tick," John August who wrote the surprisingly Generation
X film GO, and Joss Whedon creator of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
Three screenwriters is generally a bad sign, but three so different
talents can make for synergy and one very rich screenplay.  Here
they have written a screenplay that has some depth.  It has
unexpected twists (August's forte), some good humor (likely from
Edlund), and a good deal of fantasy imagination (which may have come
from Whedon).  They have bound in strong mythic elements (the quest,
the son avenging the father) that, though familiar, should resonate
with the audience.  The film does owe a debt to anime, but the
characters are much more developed and three-dimensional.</P>
<P>     Where the writing has weaknesses it is in an emotionally weak
ending which also rather stretches the credulity.  There are loose
ends left unresolved, an over-emphasis on fighting, and the Drej
make a very flat and uninteresting villain.  The other questionable
command decision is to use a raft of name actors for voices where
they are not needed.  There are so many good but barely-known actors
they could have used.  And speaking for myself only, I come to a
film like this not even knowing whose voices I will be hearing.  I
would rather not even recognize the voice and be saddled with
connections to the actors' roles in other films.</P>
<P>     Speaking of what is flat and what is three-dimensional, the
animation is an uneasy mixture of the two.  Most of the character
animation is flat, but the hardware uses three-dimensional animation
techniques.  This occasionally means you have a flat face in a
three-dimensional space suit.  But more important than how it is
animated is what is being animated.  Perhaps George Lucas has
finally been beaten in creating worlds and scenery rich in
imagination.  Even the artwork is full of novel ideas in the center
stage and in the details.  And making these spacescapes seem real
may well be the best use to date of 3D animation techniques.</P>
<P>     TITAN A.E. was produced and directed by the team of Don Bluth
and Gary Goldman, graduates of Disney animation studios.  The two
left because they saw different potentials for animation than did
Disney's other people.  They missed out on what is probably Disney's
golden age of animation and frequently their films, while some were
quite decent, seemed a step or two behind Disney Studios.  Films
like AN AMERICAN TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME seemed to be only
Disney-esque.  The real creativity was from places like Disney's
Pixar in the TOY STORY films and in film's like BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST, THE LION KING, and this season's DINOSAUR.  And for animation
technique, perhaps they are still a step behind.  But in TITAN A.E.
Bluth and Goldman have given us much more imaginative images and
probably a better story.  In a season when in short order we have
DINOSAUR, TITAN A.E., CHICKEN RUN, and FANTASIA 2000 released, Bluth
and Goldman have given us what may well deserve to be the STAR WARS
of animated films.</P>
<P>     TITAN A.E. is a film of images and imagination, perhaps the
best space opera to come to the screen since the original STAR WARS.
Weighing heavily the novelty of this film I give it a 9 on the 0 to
10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.  I am hoping this film is a
bellwether of things to come.</P>
