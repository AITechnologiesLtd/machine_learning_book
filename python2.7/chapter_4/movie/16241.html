<PRE>Psycho '98</PRE>
<P>Starring Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore and Anne Heche
Directed By Gus Van Sant</P>
<PRE>(Universal Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Although this remake of Alfred Hitchcocks classic Psycho (1960) seems to
want to be taken seriously, it comes across as nothing but an oddity made by
an overly ambitious film student. The film, nearly a scene to scene remake,
comes across as pointless to those who have seen the original. The classic
story, about Norman Bates (Vaughn) who has a bloodthirsty mother who kills
Marion Crane (Heche,) who has stolen $400,000, is familiar to many. Which
means the shocks and scares the original had are nearly lost. Also, because
the film is almost exactly the same, it can't be said that this remake is an
attempt to better the original.</P>
<P>Still, it's a pleasant film, with no major flaws. Anne Heche is excellent as
Marion, carrying the entire first half of the film with ease. She's better
than Janet Leigh, delivering a much more rounded and tougher performance,
yet still keeping that daffy, angelic look that the role requires. Julianne
Moore as her sister is also very good, leaving an impact on the audience
even if she isn't the film very long. William H. Macy is as dependable as
ever as the the private investigator who is trying to piece together the
mystery. It's seems that it's impossible for Macy to deliver a poor
performance, and he doesn't disappoint here. But while the supporting cast
is fine, including Viggo Mortensen as Marions husband Sam Loomis, there are
some problems with Vince Vaughns performance as Norman Bates, the jittery
owner of the Bates motel. Rather than coming across as naturally nervous
like Anthony Perkins outstanding performance, Vaughn is quite obviously
faking the jitteriness, including an horribly forced giggle. His performance
is almost campy, it's like he's a bully doing an impression of the wimpy kid
at school. His frame is also too imposing to look like the nice man who is
extreme mothers boy. Considering  the film centres around his character, he
does seem to drag the film down with him. It's a shame, because the rest of
the cast were very good.</P>
<P>Apart from the cast and setting (the film is now set in a bizarre 1998 where
60's clothes still rule supreme) nothing much has changed from the original
shocker. Director Gus Van Sant always intended this to be as faithful as
possible, and from the Saul Bass credits sequence to the infamous shower
scene, nothing much has changed. Van Sant has basically shown what the film
would be like if it was filmed in colour. The bird symbolism still exists,
and there's a clever scene where the audience sees Hitchcocks cameo from the
original film. (A look-a-like is standing outside Marions workplace.) The
direction is fine, the script as good as it ever was, the music still
shrieking and tension inducing (the music now produced by Danny Elfman.) But
even though Psycho is an enjoyable movie, there just this strange feeling
that there's no point to this remake. Nothing has been changed (except from
the inclusion of a few butt shots just for the sake of it) and, in honesty,
Hitchcock seemed to handle the film better than today's Hollywood.
Obviously, after the success of Good Will Hunting (1997) Van Sant was given
the opportunity to direct whatever film he wanted, and it was probably his
'ambition' to recreate Psycho for the nineties. It's a nice idea, and it may
appeal to today's younger audience, but for the rest who have seen and
enjoyed the original, this reworking is somewhat a waste of time. I'd
recommend the film, but only for novelty value.</P>
