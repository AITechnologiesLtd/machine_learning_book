<P>   If you can't get the love you want, then want the love you
get.  This appears to be the central purport of Vincent Gallo's
"Buffalo 66," a quirky, autobiographical tale of the writer-
director's younger days in the cold and snowy town of Buffalo,
New York.  Gallo is unashamedly on an ego trip with this one,
having scripted the story, helmed the production, and even
composed the music (he is a former rock musician).  Billy
Brown (Vincent Gallo), named for the Buffalo Bills football
team by his mother, Janet (Anjelica Huston)--who is a
devoted fan even to the point of obsession--seeks to win the
affection of his parents.  We in the audience see that this
quest is a lost cause and we understand how its pursuit has
affected Billy's life so greatly, but Billy appears clueless.  His
off-putting mannerisms--his tough-guy stance, his
unapproachability, even his fear of being touched by a pretty
girl--are all recognizable defenses for the young man's
insecurity.  But Billy has the luck to meet a delightful young
woman, one who falls in love with him in a single day, making
the entire movie appear to be a typical male fantasy.  </P>
<P>   Nor does Gallo seem to mind that his picture will be treated
as a fabrication.  Calling the production a fable rather than
one which should be taken literally, Gallo has filmed his
sequences with reversal stock, giving Buffalo the eerie look of
a decaying city half buried in snow highlighted by a seedy
motel, a sleazy strip joint owned by a former athlete now
going to pot, and a tap-dance class populated by seemingly
despairing women following the rhythms of a chirpy instructor. 
Photographer Lance Acord underscores the cheerlessness by
filming with a harsh, blue background, frequently jump-cutting
to keep the momentum and resorting to an occasional scene-
within-scene collage as the principal figure conjures up his
past.  </P>
<P>   The story opens as Billy is released from prison, having
served five years for a crime he did not commit.  Having told
his parents that he was actually engaged in a long-time,
secret project for the government, he calls to tell them that
he's on his way home.  In a final pitch to impress them, he
kidnaps a girl, Layla (Christina Ricci) from a dance class and
forces her to accompany him to his parents' home and to play
the role of his wife.  Rather than become terrified, Layla
enjoys the escapade with its opportunity to play the actress,
and charms her "mother-in-law" Janet and Janet's husband
Jimmy (Ben Gazzara) more than their own son had ever been
able to do.  </P>
<P>   We learn the reason the forced confession that sent Billy to
the pen and follow him as he relates to his slow-minded friend
Goon (Kevin Corrigan), to the manager of his favorite bowling
alley, Sonny (Jan-Michael Vincent), and to a woman on whom
he one had a crush, Wendy (Rosanna Arquette).  </P>
<P>   The central scene, a fairly original take on the age-old
theme of dysfunctional family, accommodates the film's lively
and idiosyncratic sense of humor.  As Billy sits at the table
watching his captive "girl friend" Layla tells lies to his parents,
prevarications designed to make him look good in front of his
unappreciative family, dad tries to conceal his hostility with
silence while mom spends more time relating to her TV set
which is showing a game with her favorite team.</P>
<P>   If this movie can overcome a serious implausibility factor, it
would rank as a solid contribution to the low budget family of
films which have been showcased at the Sundance Festival. 
Feminists may be repelled by the implication that women are
just looking to be taken by force.  Billy has enough of a chip
on his soldier to alert any normal person to stay away, and is
able to turn his life around by gaining the instant love of his
kidnap victim.  An unkempt, unshaven guy who is repelled by
the touch of another human being, he is far from  the type
who can attract the affection of Layla, even given the reality
that the girl is as lonely as he. (Why this charming creature
with a kewpie-doll appearance would lack boy friends is
likewise unexplained, nor are we privy to anything in her
background save for her involvement in a tapdance class.) 
Christina Ricci delivers here and is a performer to watch. 
Having turned in roles in "The Addams Family" and "Addams
Family Values" and "The Ice Storm," she is soon to appear in
"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" while Gallo, known to some
for his part in Calvin Klein commercials, should be able to
parlay his ego into solid movie positions in the future. 
"Buffalo 66" features a few scenes that might have come out
of a film school student's imagination--particularly one in
which Billy shoots a former pro football player in the head--but
compels attention by the sheer chutzpa of its telling.  Rated
R.  Running time: 112 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
