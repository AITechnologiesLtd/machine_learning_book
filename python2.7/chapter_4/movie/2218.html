<P>     One night in the early 1960s, a young boy is taken in by a West
Texas family.  He claims that he's lost and, being the decent folk that
they are, his benefactors decide that it's their responsibility to see
that he's fed, bathed, and given a place to sleep.  But this guest
turns out not to be the homeless waif the family believed him to be,
and when he's discovered letting his criminal father Roy (James Caan)
into the house to rob it, a bloodbath ensues.  The sole surviving
member of the family is a baby girl.  Father, mother, and son are all
brutally gunned down--two of them in cold blood.</P>
<P>     Thirty years later, the boy has grown into the man Arlis Sweeny
(Dennis Quaid), a vending machine stocker who roams from town-to-town
following a set routine that gives him comfort and helps shield him
from memories better left buried.  Then into his life comes Kay (Meg
Ryan), a woman whose future is as bleak as her past, and suddenly
Arlis' deeds of thirty years ago return to haunt him anew.</P>
<P>     FLESH AND BONE is film noir, complete with the characters and
settings expected from an entry in the genre.  It's a thriller that
doesn't rely on action for its suspense.  Drama--occasionally spilling
over to melodrama--is the backbone.  The story isn't overplotted; the
only real plot twist is easily guessed at early on, and while the
entire script turns on one massive coincidence, that event is so
expertly buried within the context of a gripping tale that it doesn't
seem so implausible when it happens.  Chock it up to fate's bitterly
ironic sense of humor.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Steve Kloves, who penned THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS,
displays the same strength of character here as in his previous
effort.  He creates a quartet of highly believable people:  the
taciturn loner Arlis; the emotionally and physically battered Kay; the
ornery, pragmatically deadly Roy; and the shameless
survive-at-all-costs Ginnie (played by Gwyneth Paltrow).  Though things
may not move that quickly in FLESH AND BONE, the four keep the audience
engrossed throughout.</P>
<P>     Hollywood conventions are routinely flouted.  The tension comes
not from cinematic tricks and musical crescendos, but from a
combination of the vivid atmosphere and the steady, dreadful buildup to
an inevitable conclusion.</P>
<P>     Dennis Quaid, normally chosen for cocky, devil-may-care roles,
plays Arlis with an effective subdued charm.  Meg Ryan is likewise
solid, cast against type as the swearing, boozing Kay.  Her best
moments are those when her character's vulnerable side is allowed to
show.  James Caan turns in one of his most disturbing performances in a
long time.</P>
<P>     The real eye-opener, however, is Gwyneth Paltrow, who more than
holds her own playing opposite three established stars.  Her
performance as the sexy, cynical Ginnie is fresh and unaffected, and it
doesn't take long for us to get into the character's head to understand
her motives and crushed dreams.  Not since Juliette Lewis in CAPE FEAR
has an American debut been this impressive.</P>
<P>     Perhaps, ultimately, FLESH AND BONE is mostly-static, and maybe
its central plot element is hard to swallow.  But these characters are
so impressive, and their circumstances so compelling, that I didn't
care about shortcomings in the story.  FLESH AND BONE is all
suspenseful buildup without shoot-outs, chases, and explosions, and its
conclusion doesn't demand a neatly-packaged resolution.  More
importantly, it's one of the few successful '40s-type noir thrillers to
grace the big screen in recent years.</P>
