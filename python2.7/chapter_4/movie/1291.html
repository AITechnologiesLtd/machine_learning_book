<PRE>                      THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., R, Comedy/Musical/Science Fiction/Cult, 1975
Distributor: CBS FOX (but not currently available for purchase)
Director: Jim Sharman
Cast: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien,
      Meatloaf, Patricia Quinn, "Little Nell" Campbell,
      Jonathan Adams, Charles Gray, Peter Hinwood</P>
<P>     Straight and naive couple Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are
going on a drive in the woods to visit Adams when one of their tires
blows out.  They return to a castle they had recently passed to see if
they can use a phone to call for help.  At the castle they meet
Transylvanian transvestite Tim Curry, his creation Peter Hinwood, his
servants Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn, groupie "Little Nell"
Campbell, and many others.   As the night progresses Barry Bostwick and
Susan Sarandon get loosened up.</P>
<P>     I am a very big fan of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and strongly
urge, if you haven't gone to see it, that you do so.  Who knows, you
might surprise yourself and like it.  On a rating scale of zero to five,
I give ROCKY a five.  THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is rated R for adult
situations, explicit language, adult humor, and brief female nudity.  *A
WORD OF WARNING*, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is not for little
children or people who are easily shocked for it contains a lot of
sexual innuendo and a range of other taboo subjects.</P>
<P>     THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW was originally released in the
theaters in 1975 and was a box office bomb.  Since then a cult following
has been established and the movie has started theatrical runs at
midnight.  THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW can still be seen in the
theater on the big screen, and, for those people who don't want to go
out to the movies at midnight, it is on video cassette at those video
stores that got the film when it was available for purchase.  For your
first viewing you may wish to see ROCKY on video because in the theater
there is a lot of audience reaction to the film and some of the lines
will be drowned out.</P>
<P>     THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is one of those films that gets
better each time you view it.  The first time that I saw ROCKY, I felt
that this was a very bizarre film.  Most of the cast end up wearing
fishnet tights at some point in the film.  This sort of shocked me, and
sort-of turned me off to the film.  I liked the songs a lot though.  The
second time I liked the film a lot more.  I was no longer shocked at all
by the attire of some of the characters in the film.  I found ROCKY to
be a truly original film.  Where else can you find a man who walks
around for almost an hour and forty minutes wearing little more than
fishnet tights and a garter belt?  The film contains wonderful songs
that make you want to sing along, and if you go to the theater to see
ROCKY you will find out that the audience does sing along.  Now THE
ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is one of my favorite movies.  I have bought
the soundtrack and the video cassette, and have seen the play THE ROCKY
HORROR SHOW three times.</P>
<P>     A big part of ROCKY in the theaters is that all the cult fans call
out reactions to lines in the film, sing along, and, in theaters that
allow it, some people throw things at the screen at certain points like
toilet paper, rice, and water.  Some people dress up like their favorite
character in the film.  Some people dance in the isles.  If you are
lucky, at your theater will be a group of ROCKY fans who act out the
film as it goes along.  In short it's a great deal of fun.  All this
will be missed if you watch the video (however, just before and after
the film on the video cassette there are scenes of theaters playing
ROCKY with the audience participation).  And for those of you
interested, the minister in the beginning of ROCKY was played by Tim
Curry and the three other people in the church were played by Richard
O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, and "Little Nell" Campbell.</P>
<P>     THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is based on an English play called
THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW that played in London and was written by Richard
O'Brien.  All the music and lyrics for the songs were written by Richard
O'Brien also.  The film was co-written by Jim Sharman (the director of
THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW) and Richard O'Brien.</P>
<P>     Tim Curry (THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, CLUE, IT) plays Dr. Frank-N-
Furter (a scientist).  Frank-N-Furter is the main character in the film.
He is a transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania (Transsexual is a
planet).  Frank-N-Furter is creating the perfect creation, Rocky
Horror, and about to unveil him to a group of Transylvanians when two
strangers show up and threaten taking Rocky away from him.</P>
<P>     Susan Sarandon (PRETTY BABY, BULL DURHAM) plays Janet Weiss (a
heroine).  Janet is one of the two people who get brought into Frank-N-
Furter's castle and exposed to a different view on sexuality.  She falls
in love with Rocky Horror, much to Frank's dismay.  In the beginning of
the film Janet is very uncomfortable in Frank's castle, but as the night
wears on she starts to feel more at home!</P>
<P>     Barry Bostwick (MOVIE! MOVIE!, CAPTIVE, A PARENT TRAP HAWAIIAN
HONEYMOON, SLITHER) plays Brad Majors (a hero).  Brad is the other
person brought into Frank's castle, and he is sexually loosened by
Frank.  He is confused with the castle, yet likes it at the same time.
He just doesn't know how to react to what happens to him.  He and Janet
are engaged to be married.</P>
<P>     Richard O'Brien (FLASH GORDON, SHOCK TREATMENT, JUBILEE) plays Riff
Raff (a handyman).  It is said that Richard O'Brien wrote the role of
Riff Raff for himself.  Whether it is true or not, I don't know.  Riff
Raff is the caretaker of Frank's castle.  He is also from Transsexual
Transylvania.   Riff Raff doesn't care much for Rocky Horror.</P>
<P>     Patricia Quinn (SHOCK TREATMENT) plays Magenta (a domestic).
Magenta is Riff Raff's sister and she is also from Transsexual
Transylvania.  Magenta doesn't like Rocky Horror very much, and she
isn't very pleased with the way Frank treats her.</P>
<P>     "Little Nell" Campbell (JUBILEE) plays Columbia (a groupie).  She
came to Frank's castle because she was in love with Frank.  At Frank's
castle she fell in love with Eddie.  She worships the ground that Eddie
walks on and is very upset with what happens to him.  She seems to
despise Brad and Janet.</P>
<P>     Jonathan Adams plays Dr. Everett V.  Scott (a rival scientist).
Dr. Scott is a former teacher of both Brad and Janet.  He is now a
friend to both of them.  He, apparently, has been investigating Frank
for a period of time and coincidently picks this night, when Brad and
Janet are at Frank's castle, to act.  This action endangers the lives of
Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott.</P>
<P>     Peter Hinwood (THE ODYSSEY) plays Rocky Horror (a creation).  Rocky
Horror is "born" in the beginning of the film.  Riff Raff and Magenta
terrorize him.  Frank comes after him for sexual reasons and Janet
tempts him.  Rocky is very confused by the whole ordeal and just wants
to get away from it all.</P>
<P>     Meatloaf (ROADIE, WAYNE'S WORLD) plays Eddie (an ex-delivery boy).
Eddie is Columbia's lover and Frank's ex-lover.  Frank needed to get a
brain for Rocky so he took half of Eddie's.  Then he put Eddie in deep
freeze for future use if necessary.  Eddie has the smallest role in the
film, but the one who, in my opinion, is the most liked.</P>
<P>     Charles Gray (DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, THE MIRROR CRACK'D, SHOCK
TREATMENT, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) plays The Criminologist (an expert).
The Criminologist narrates the dreadful story of what happened to Brad
and Janet (The Denton Affair).</P>
<P>     Also for those of you interested, on the walls of Frank's castle
are many famous paintings, like the Mona Lisa.  And the male statues in
Frank's lab have lipstick and fingernail polish on.</P>
<P>     This film has an interesting style.  Events that have happened in
the past are narrated by the Criminologist; yet the scenes with Brad and
Janet are done like they are taking place in the present.  The scenes
with the Criminologist are spliced in the middle of scenes with Brad and
Janet.</P>
<P>     If this film comes to a theater in your area definitely go see it
and don't forget to bring your squirt gun filled with water, (Scott)
toilet paper, and rice.  Remember, in the lines of Frank-N-Furter,
"Don't dream it, be it."</P>
<PRE>"And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human race
Lost in time, and lost in space
And meaning."
