<P>Adam Sandler likes to work with the same people. And why not. He went from
being just another schmucky "Saturday Night Live" alum trying to make it in
the movies, to a loud and proud member of the $20-Million a film club, and
friggin' huge in the movies! Back he is with his producer and screenwriting
buddies, Jack Giarraputo and Tim Herlihy from THE WATERBOY (5.5/10), THE
WEDDING SINGER (7/10) and HAPPY GILMORE (8/10), for a Sandler-look at being
a real-life big daddy.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Slacker/law school graduate cannot seem to get himself pumped up to do
anything until his girlfriend dumps his sorry ass due to his
irresponsibility. So he adopts a child to prove himself to said girlfriend,
but suddenly finds himself actually liking the kid more than just a vehicle
to cure his immature transgressions.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite having seen his grown-up kid character umpteen times in various
other Sandler incarnations, this film still managed to be funny and cute,
filled with lowest common denominator jokes, an adorable kid and a
transparent plot. Now if you're not a Sandler fan, or have had just about
enough of his loveable loser characters-- sweet and nice on the inside,
unapologetic slackers on the outside, then chuck this one over to your video
rentals futures. But if you're like the rest of us, enjoy Sandler's idiocy,
and subconsciously live vicariously through his "never-wanna-grow-up"
adult-goof-boy characters (or Sandler himself...hard to distinguish really),
then sit back and enjoy this derivative character recycled in plenty of
laugh 'em up humor.</P>
<P>Yes, Sandler's character screams really loud when he gets upset and cracks
people up. Yes, there are plenty of easy piss jokes, barf jokes, gay jokes,
hooters jokes, and sports talk peppered throughout this
marketable-soundtrack-layered script. Yes, there are no less than three good
looking women in this film, who in real life wouldn't cross the street to
acknowledge Sandler's "if-not-a-movie-star" existence. But hey, this is an
Adam Sandler movie and I personally consider him to be a pretty funny dude,
despite his lack of creative Mike Myers flair. Unoriginality and weak story
aside, I suppose the film's contrived "emotional" ending also struck me as
somewhat artificial, but I guess we had to expect a slightly softer touch in
a film which treads superficially over a serious subject (adoption vs group
homes).</P>
<P>All in all, the kid's too darn cute to resist, Sandler does his regular
fun-loving schtick, chuckles abound, and many laugh-out loud jokes pop up
here and there (Although a lot of them are featured in the trailer.) I'm
curious to see how this film does with the general audience, seeing as
originality doesn't seem to be Sandler's strong suit. Oh yeah, please try
and remember to straddle your ears when Sheryl Crow wails into an
unnecessary version of the classic Guns 'N Roses hit "Sweet Child O'
Mine"...youch!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The script for this film was originally written by Steve Franks, his first
produced screenplay, but ultimately polished up by veteran comedy writers
Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy. Herlihy is currently the head writer of TV's
"Saturday Night Live", member of the New York State Bar and played the
"Singing Kangaroo" in this film (Wow!). Producer Jack Giarraputo, who was
Sandler's third roommate alongside Herlihy at NYU, skipped out on his own
bar exam, and instead moved to Los Angeles and slept on Sandler's couch
(Great move!).
Director Dennis Dugan, who began his career as an actor, played double-duty
when he directed HAPPY GILMORE, as he was also one of its co-stars opposite
Sandler.
The kid who plays Julian in this film is actually two kids. Born identical
twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse, this duo make their feature film debut here,
despite some years experience as Brett Butler's youngest child on TV's
"Grace under Fire". Cole was actually the first actor to read for this role,
but is actually 15 minutes younger than Dylan. Both kids were born in
Arezzo, Italy, but raised in Southern California.
Julian's Scuba Steve toy is based on the Diver Dan doll that Adam Sandler
cherished as a child. When he lost his Diver Dan doll, his father dressed up
as Diver Dan and came to the front door. He said that the doll was with him
now, but "thanked me for watching over him while he grew up." Sandler
credits his father for doing "anything" to make him feel better.
This film marks actor Steve Buscemi's (Who will always be Mr. Pink from
RESERVOIR DOGS in my heart) fourth collaboration with Adam Sandler on film.
This film was originally titled GUY GETS KID. The film's dedication reads:
"This movie is dedicated to our fathers. Thanks for putting up with all of
our crap. We love you."</P>
