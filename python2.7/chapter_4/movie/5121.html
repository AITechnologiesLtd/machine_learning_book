<P>     Not since Robert Altman's THE PLAYER has a film been this 
relentless in its satirical attack.  THE GREAT WHITE HYPE takes the 
boxing industry and rips it open, displaying the rotting, putrid innards 
for all to see.  There are times when this movie is so vicious that it 
ceases to be funny.  While THE GREAT WHITE HYPE has its share of 
comical, occasionally-hilarious moments, don't expect a non-stop 
laughfest on par with THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  </P>
<P>     Co-writer Ron Shelton is no stranger to sports movies -- he 
scripted five before this (three of which he directed):  THE BEST OF 
TIMES, BULL DURHAM, WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, COBB, and BLUE CHIPS.  Shelton 
is familiar with the behind-the-scenes machinations, and this knowlege 
is crucial to the film's success.  THE GREAT WHITE HYPE works primarily 
because its excesses aren't far removed from reality.  Perhaps the most 
disturbing thing about the movie is the recognition of how true-to-life 
the most outlandish and absurd aspects are.</P>
<P>     James "the Grim Reaper" Roper (Damon Wayans) is the most 
devastating heavyweight champion since Mike Tyson.  With his 38-0 
record, he's a force to be reckoned with.  Or is he?  Is Roper 
undefeated because he's so good, or because his flamboyant, publicity-
loving manager, Reverend Fred Sultan (Samuel L. Jackson), only lets him 
fight stiffs.  That's the question Roper's would-be-rival-in-the-ring, 
Marvin Shabazz (Michael Jace) would like answered.  He can't get a match 
with Roper because Sultan won't commit to a date. </P>
<P>     The pay-per-view revenue for Roper's last fight is down -- way 
down.  The money isn't rolling in the way it used to, and Sultan knows 
the reason.  People have lost interest in the heavyweight championship, 
he claims, because they're tired of watching black men beat up each 
other.  They need a white hero -- someone with a "clean-cut", "all-
American" image.  And, Sultan adds, if he doesn't exist, "I'll create 
him."  When one of Sultan's assistants uncovers the name of Terry 
Conklin (Peter Berg), the only man ever to knock out Roper (albeit in an 
amateur bout more than 10 years ago), Sultan has his man.  With his 
entourage in tow, the promoter pays a visit to Cleveland, where Conklin 
is acting as lead singer for a bad heavy metal band.  After making one 
$10 million offer to the ex-Golden Glove Champ, Sultan has his "great 
white hope" -- Irish Terry Conklin (who's not Irish), defender of the 
homeless (he gives large donations to that cause) and challenger for the 
heavyweight championship.</P>
<P>     The secondary plot of THE GREAT WHITE HYPE involves the rise of 
Mitchell Kane (Jeff Goldblum) from tabloid reporter and self-styled 
"freelance crusader" to a major force in the boxing promotion business.  
Kane, who starts out trying to expose Sultan as a fraud, ends up 
becoming another cog in the Don King-like promoter's machinery.  Jon 
Lovitz, Cheech Marin, Salli Richardson, and Corbin Bernsen all have 
small roles as Sultan's flunkies.  And, although Jackson's performance 
is the one to watch, everyone else is more than capable, especially 
Damon Wayans, who finds the right balance between seriousness and 
comedy.</P>
<P>     Ably directed by Reginald Hudlin (BOOMERANG), THE GREAT WHITE HYPE 
never lets up with its pummeling of the boxing industry and its image-
obsessed attitudes.  The film also presents a timely message about how 
racial divisiveness can be exploited in sports (especially boxing) to 
bring in big bucks.  Shelton and Tony Hendra's script sparkles with 
nasty, incisive wit -- their pens were sharpened to finely-honed points 
before they began this skewering.  And the boxing match at the end is 
actually suspenseful, because we don't know how things are going to turn 
out -- there's potential for more ridicule no matter who wins or loses.</P>
<P>     There are occasions when THE GREAT WHITE HYPE goes too far, and 
rarer instances when it doesn't go far enough, but those moments are 
only apparent upon close examination.  This movie isn't the unqualified 
success that THE PLAYER or SPINAL TAP were -- both of those films had 
more artistry than is evident here -- but THE GREAT WHITE HYPE is still 
the kind of first-rate satire that would make Jonathan Swift proud.  By 
the time this hyper-energetic, unapologetically politically incorrect 
motion picture draws to a close, boxing has been dealt a knock-out 
punch. </P>
