<PRE>REVIEW: The Borrowers</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>3 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>If youre reading this review, the chances are youve seen the posters and
perhaps even trailers for The Borrowers.  So Ill address the question that
everyone wants answered: what exactly are they?  Do they bear close similarities
to the mouse in Mouse Hunt, or are they perhaps a Home Alone Macaulay Culkin
type being?  Well theyre a little bit of both.</P>
<P>The Borrowers like to consider themselves as cautious, alert, inconspicuous and
good at climbing.  But if this is the case, why do they end up being chased
across the town by a greedy lawyer, a clumsy exterminator, a smelly hound and a
big-eyed kid on a bike?</P>
<P>Pod (Jim Broadbent), Homily (Celia Imrie) and their kids, Peagreen (Tom Felton)
and Arrietty (Flora Newbigin) are our Borrowers.  They live under the
floorboards of a big house and borrow items from the residents living there.
But when the human being familys Aunt dies (who previously owned the house),
the greedy and self righteous lawyer Ocious Potter (John Goodman), tells the
family that a will was never found and the house was now officially his.  As
they begin to move out, the confused Borrowers get tangled up in these human
matters and stumble into danger when Peagreen and Arrietty get up to mischief
and attempt to foil the evil Potters plans.</P>
<P>It came as no surprise to me to find The Borrowers a fairly ordinary collection
of thrills and spills for kids, with a few exceptions.  One of my obvious
highlights was a tense scene involving a couple of borrowers, John Goodman, a
light bulb and ruler.  Sound exciting?  Probably not, but is a treat to see
simple everyday household items turned into life saving objects for these tiny
little people.</P>
<P>Although The Borrowers may seem at first to be a delightfully different kids
flick, but really its very similar to what weve seen many times before.  The
bad guy, John Goodman, will chase the little critters all over the place  but
when he finally catches them, rather than simply stepping on them hell conjure
up some evil and deranged death plan. Of course, as he turns his back on them
they will miraculously escape to freedom just to be caught again later on.</P>
<P>But poor John  the first time he gets caught out by these tiny beings is his
last  thats kids flicks for you, eh?</P>
