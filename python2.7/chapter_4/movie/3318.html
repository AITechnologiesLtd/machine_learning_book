<PRE>                                 SHALLOW GRAVE
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>Great Britain, 1994
Dir: Danny Boyle
Scr: John Hodge</PRE>
<P>     There's a guaranteed audience these days for the "sophisticated
thriller."  In genrespeak, that's the movie with a self-consciously
twisting and turning plotline, overtly intelligent characters, and a
calculated streak of nastiness allowing the viewer to feel truly
decadent, giggling along with the filmmakers. SHALLOW GRAVE is such a
movie, a British import about a trio of flatmates who conspire against
their own better judgment to take advantage of someone else's
ill-gotten gains. When I saw it, with a "sophisticated" crowd, the
folks to the left and right of me were swept up in the movie, cackling
evilly or burying faces in hands when the proceedings on-screen became
particularly gruesome. It's definitely a crowd-pleaser.</P>
<P>     Incredibly, some reviewers have been comparing SHALLOW GRAVE to
Quentin Tarantino's films, as though the director of PULP FICTION
somehow invented the stylish thriller.  Rubbish. SHALLOW GRAVE owes its
existence pretty much in its entirety to the films of Alfred Hitchcock,
which it apes shamelessly. It's a canny imitation, and the director has
done enough homework to know what kind of homage works and what's just
stupid (the movie is fiercely intelligent). But intelligence alone
doesn't completely compensate for SHALLOW GRAVE's shortcomings. Perhaps
overconfidence leads this film to count on its audience being so
delighted by each new odd camera angle and unexpected revelation that
it becomes lazy in terms of showing us anything truly surprising.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a crazy high-speed tour of city streets, set
to a thumping high energy soundtrack. It resembles nothing so much as
Shinya Tsukamoto's cautionary horror fable TETSUO, and it's hard to
understand why the film takes such a hyperkinetic approach during its
opening credits. Things slow down from there, as we settle in for a
study of three characters sharing an apartment--Alex (Ewan McGregor),
David (Christopher Eccleston), and Juliet (Kerry Fox). The casual
cruelty of these characters is established immediately, as they
interview and humiliate potential roommates. Alex is the most outgoing
of the three, with the loosest tongue.  David is shy and retreating,
while the smart and sensible Juliet (whose boyfriend is conspicuously
absent) functions as the apex of a very repressed sexual triangle. They
finally settle on a strange fellow named Hugo (Keith Allen), an
apparently well-off writer who pays his first rent in cash. But soon,
Hugo is a corpse, and the suitcase of cash he leaves behind in his
bedroom is too much of a temptation. What if, Alex wants to know, the
three of them dispose of the body and keep the money?</P>
<P>     That's probably the first 10 minutes. The rest of the movie
springs out of that proposition, as the situation becomes more and more
precarious and the riches bring out the worst in everybody. The ensuing
shenanigans are both intense and wickedly funny, and it wouldn't do to
spoil them here. It's very easy to place yourself in these roles, and
the triumph of any thriller is that the audience feels the fear and
isolation of the characters. But while one character's complete
transformation is essential to the storyline, it's wholly unbelievable.
The sexual dynamics (which pivot on Juliet's status as an object of
desire) are intriguing and well-handled, but Boyle's relentless homage
to Hitchcock (odd camera angles, snickering gallows humor, and shots
lifted wholesale from VERTIGO and PSYCHO) wears thin.  It's more than a
little disappointing when the credits finally roll, because we hope for
more from this clever thriller.  But perhaps it's to the director's
credit that we really do want to spend more time with these rather
unpleasant people, feeding ravenously, vicariously off of their
actions.</P>
