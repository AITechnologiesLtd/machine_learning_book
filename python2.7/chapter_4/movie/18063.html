<PRE>The Matrix
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Keanu Reeves; Laurence Fishburne; Carrie-Anne Moss; Hugo Weaving &
Gloria Foster</P>
<P>Let me first say that the conditions that I was forced to watch The Matrix
under were less than ideal. So I have tried to be as fair as possible
considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal. I
watched The Matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the
best of times. Under no circumstances, should it have ever been allowed to
show a big budget special effects laden film like The Matrix. This theater,
owned by the parent company of one of Hollywood's biggest studios, hasn't
even graduated into stereo sound yet. The mono sound that the audience was
subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many
years past mandatory retirement age. In other words, the sound sucked. As
someone used to digital sound in a movie theater, bad sound doesn't do
anything to add to a film. I'm not even going to go into the horrible
splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together.</P>
<P>There, I've had my rant, now on with the regularly scheduled review. Which
sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which I'm assuming was
spectacular, but I'm just guessing. My guess on the sound seems like a
fairly solid one considering the visual quality of The Matrix. It is nothing
short of stunning visually. Sadly, the rest of the film, while pretty good,
doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making
this film look so darn good.</P>
<P>The Matrix has at it's core a good concept, although it strays into the
confusing side more often than I would have liked. Keanu Reeves plays a
computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality
is just a hoax. It turns out that that many years ago the world was
devastated by some sort of disaster. Now machines run the planet and humans
spend their lives in a sort of incubator, plugged into a computer network.
The computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a
representation of the Earth before it was destroyed. The population of the
planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really
spend their entire lives as comatose. That is except a small band who have
discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons. They
now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this
lie. Reeve's character, Neo, is recruited by this band of rebels led by
Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Newcomer Carrie-Anne Moss and one of
Hollywood's most underrated actors, Joe Pantoliano, join Fishburne in the
band of freedom-fighters.</P>
<P>The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. This can be
attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's
extensive pre-production training in martial arts. This lends itself to some
of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a
film. When you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer
generated world, it all adds up to an eyeful.</P>
<P>As I already said, the visuals far outpace the rest of the film. Acting in
The Matrix is not bad, but it certainly isn't real good either. Keanu Reeves
gives his usual fairly emotionless performances. Although to his credit, it
is one of his better performances. Laurence Fishburne on the other hand
often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film. More than a few
times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort
of Shakespearean drama. Joe Pantoliano was a little under used in this film
but he made the most with what he had. Carrie-Anne Moss turned out a
surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role. It's
nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking
looks.</P>
<P>You have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the
work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in
this film. It was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves
down perfectly for the fighting sequences. I also put much of the blame for
the somewhat strained performances in The Matrix on the dialogue, which was
terrible at times.</P>
<P>In more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at
other times it was just plain weird. It almost seems as though the writers
were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept
for the movie. So they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so
that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about. Thereby
covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the
departments of logic and believability. My other major complaint with The
Matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending. The setup for it was hokey and
frankly used in many a bad film before. The ending itself was just plain
strange.</P>
<P>The main reasons to recommend The Matrix are the visual effects and computer
animation which make this a real treat to watch. While the rest of the film
(acting, dialogue and to a degree plot) detract from the high production
values, they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending The Matrix
as a fun way to spend an evening.</P>
