<PRE>_Traffic_ (R) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Featuring well over one hundred speaking parts over the course of a
running time that just misses the two-and-a-half-hour mark, Steven
Soderbergh's sprawling drama _Traffic_ is indeed jam-packed, but never
does it reach a stall.  This saga of the so-called "war" on drugs is a
masterwork of superb performance, smart writing--and, most of all, the
mark of a director who not only knows what he wants, but also exactly how
to make his ambitious vision a glorious reality.</P>
<P>Unlike most multicharacter pastiches, such as the ones made by Robert
Altman, or Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_, the characters of
_Traffic_'s three tales don't constantly crisscross, nor are they all
brought together by a big event.  Intersections are rare in _Traffic_,
and the junctions that do occur are often fleeting.  Yet the stories are
strongly linked by their greater thematic concern: to vividly illustrate
how the drug problem touches all corners of the country, all walks of
life, from people on the harsh urban streets to those in lavish
upper-class neighborhoods.  Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan, working
from the '80s British miniseries _Traffik_, steadfastly refuse to force
easy, comforting conclusions from difficult and complex situations; as in
real life, one is left to decide for oneself who or what is right, and
what it all means.</P>
<P>While _Traffic_ is essentially about the war on drugs in America, the
film's starting point is the almost-exclusively south-of-the-border (and
nearly all Spanish language) story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro,
doing away with his annoying tics and delivering a career performance),
an average Tijuana State policeman who is given the opportunity for
greater prestige by working for General Salazar's (Tomas Milian) efforts
against the drug cartels.  Just north of the border in San Diego is the
setting for another thread, in which very pregnant European émigré Helena
Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones, her real-life condition adding a deeper
layer to her role) learns that the pampered lifestyle provided by husband
Carlos (Steven Bauer) comes from dabblings in drugs, not legit business
ventures.  The film also travels a bit northwest to Cincinnati, the third
central locale, where Caroline (Erika Christensen), the teenage daughter
of newly-appointed U.S. drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas),
brings her father's enemy much closer to home than he could have ever
imagined.</P>
<P>Soderbergh effortlessly weaves the individual strands into a tapestry
that is at once cohesive and characterized by its contrasting colors. 
The latter can be taken in a literal sense--Soderbergh, under the
pseudonym "Peter Andrews" (his father's name), shot the film himself, and
he gave each part of the film its own distinct look: grainy, washed-out
yellow for Mexico; a solemn blue sheen for Cincinnati; sun-drenched full
color for San Diego.  Each, of course, is representative of the
prevailing mood: the arid amorality of the drug underworld; the sad
desperation of daughter and father; the sparkle of a too-good-to-be-true
standard of living.  The intimacy and realism of the characters and their
situations, aided immeasurably by Soderbergh's hand-held
documentary-style lensing, smooth out any possible seams between the
pieces.</P>
<P>_Traffic_ may sound like a grim exercise in arty pretense, but the
weightiness of the subject matter doesn't necessarily keep the film from
being an accessible entertainment.  This element is largely satisfied in
San Diego, where Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman make a crack seriocomic team
as FBI agents surveilling the Ayala home and protecting a key witness
(Miguel Ferrer); this thread also delivers its share of unpredictable
twists.  The other two sections are by their very basic premises--power
struggles between drug lords and overmatched law enforcement, teen
substance abuse--darker and hence less open to offering more standard
genre satisfactions, but the performances make them instantly absorbing.</P>
<P>It is easy, almost too easy, to peg _Traffic_ as merely being a
statement on the futility of the war on drugs.  Yes, once boiled down to
the bare essentials, that is what the stories are about; yet the film's
essence are its painfully, truthfully imperfect people, who show how
everyone, knowingly or not, in some way becomes a casualty and a
perpetuator of the war machine.  With its wide focus, Soderbergh's film
is technically epic in scale, yet _Traffic_ derives its lasting power
from the savvy notion that sheer size is no match for urgent,
true-to-life immediacy.</P>
