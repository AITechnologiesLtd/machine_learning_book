<P>"Buffalo '66" is the type of film that serves as a reminder of those small,
lonely towns throughout America where you don't see or hear much, and the only
excitement to be found is maybe at a third-rate bowling alley or a pool table
at some tavern on a squalid street corner. In other words, a film about the
kind of places you know exist, but would never think of visiting - a place not
unlike Buffalo. Vincent Gallo's directorial debut "Buffalo '66" focuses greatly
on the squalid nature of such towns. </P>
<P>The scrawny Gallo stars as Billy Brown, a young man released from prison after
six years for a crime he didn't commit. And what's the first thing Billy does
after exiting the prison's front gate? He asks the guard if he can use the
bathroom. This is something Billy tries to do for the first fifteen minutes of
the film, but he can't seem to find one. Finally, he relieves himself at a
tap-dance studio where he abruptly kidnaps a blonde, Lolita-like teenage
student named Layla (Christina Ricci), and threatens her with words like "Don't
wash the front windshield of the car like that!" </P>
<P>Billy's motive for kidnapping Layla is to make her pretend she is his wife so
he can present her to his parents as a sign of maturity and responsibility. She
calmly agrees, but wonders if his parents will cook meat since she's a
vegetarian. When they arrive at his parents' house, they are greeted with
indifference and the cheerless dinner scene, an absolute riot to watch, is
beset by past humiliations, particularly when Billy is reminded that as a kid
he was allergic to chocolate doughnuts though his mother didn't care. </P>
<P>"Buffalo '66" captures the seediness and icy coldness of Buffalo better than
any other film could, but it's deficient in the screenwriting department. Gallo
does a marvelous job of developing the hirsute antihero Billy, who is really
just a lost soul in search of something. I also liked the way he wrote and shot
the dinner table scenes, emphasizing the pain and dysfunction between Billy and
his parents by composing a wide spatial distance in the reverse angle shots
(the parents are superbly played by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). But the
film suffers by not divulging much information about Layla - who is this girl?
Is she a sexpot, a hooker, a forlorn dance student, an angel, or none of the
above? The cherub-like Ricci plays her with great sex appeal and perfect comic
timing, but she is much too enigmatic a character for my tastes - a nobody who
is still a nobody by the end. And the feel-good ending negates most of what
preceded it. </P>
<P>Still, in an era of bland blockbuster phenomenons and clever post-modernist
horror flicks, "Buffalo '66" is surely different and it has an edge. It betrays
its own edginess and sense of anxiety, but it holds your interest right from
the opening black-and-white title credits to Gallo's imposing presence. He has
one of the more hauntingly expressive faces I've seen in a long time, and it
suggests anything but peace. </P>
