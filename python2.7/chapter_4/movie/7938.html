                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1995, R, 111 minutes [1 hour, 51 minutes]
[drama]
Starring: Nicholas Cage (Ben), Elizabeth Shue (Sera), produced by Lila Cazes,
Annie Stewart, written and directed by Mike Figgis, based on the novel by
John O'Brien. </P>
<P>"Leaving Las Vegas" plays a lot like its main character of a suicidal
alcoholic, as it is a drunken stupor through the lives of two pathetic
people. This is a grim story about two people who have hit rock bottom, but
somehow manage to fall in love with each other, once again showing how
strange and powerful love can be.</P>
<P>Nicholas Cage stars as Ben, a failing screen writer who is fired and
de-friended because of his alcoholism. He has depended upon alcohol so much
that when he's sober he can't function properly. He embarrasses himself at a
bank as he tries to sign a check but can't because of his nerves. He goes to
his only home, a local bar, and after a few shots is back to normal and even
witty, friendly, and almost likable. It's obvious he's given up on life and
decides to drink himself to death in Las Vegas. He figures he'd be an even
less important stiff in a town full of derelicts and immorality.</P>
<P>Enter Sera (Shue), a typical hooker who will do anything for money. Figgis
goes so far to define this mood and theme by indulging us with her work, so
much so it almost seems pornographic, but that's just the atmosphere of Las
Vegas. While driving one night, Ben almost hits Sera with his car. Later, he
sees her on the street and offers to solicit her. Perhaps it was fate that
they met again, and this time something between the two clicks.</P>
<P>It's hard to tell if Ben wanted to solicit Sera for pleasure, of if he was
just too drunk to comprehend what he was doing. They don't exactly have sex
but instead just attempt to talk to each other. Somehow the two fall for each
other, but when considering what Sera does for a living, it's obvious she
can't have a relationship and the story becomes a bit predictable from here.</P>
<P>The works well as a brutally honest character study, however, it doesn't
offer anything creative as far as plot goes. What it does do is paint a bleak
picture of the effects of alcohol and how two people, even as pathetic as
these two, can find shelter and happiness in each other. At times the story
starts to get a little sappy, as it's implied that they love each other
through talking, kissing, etc. Ben admits he has nothing to live for, and
Sera's kindness is the only thing besides alcohol that affects him. </P>
<P>"Leaving Las Vegas" works as a good love but is a little clouded with Ben's
alcoholism. What do they see in each other and why do they care? I'm not
really sure, but it is fascinating to watch them go through the motions. </P>
