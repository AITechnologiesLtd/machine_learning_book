<PRE>                             NOTTING HILL
                     A movie review by Joe Barlow
                         (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Alec Baldwin, Rhys Ifans
DIRECTOR:  Roger Michell
WRITER:    Richard Curtis
RATED:     PG-13
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>        "Notting Hill," the new romantic comedy from director
Roger
Michell ("Four Weddings and a Funeral"), is the cinematic
equivalent
of a hot fudge sundae: it has no nutritional value whatsoever,
but
tastes so good going down that you simply don't care.  And like
our
metaphoric sundae, it leaves behind such a sweet aftertaste
that
you can't help wanting just a little more.  Tooth decay be
damned.</PRE>
<P>        Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is the world's most beloved
actress.  While in London to promote her latest film, she
wanders
into a dilapidated bookstore run by Will Thacker (Hugh Grant),
the
even more dilapidated owner.  Anna is charmed by Will's amiable
personality, and the fact that he treats her like a person as
opposed to a celebrity.  A second accidental meeting later on
sets the amour wheels in motion... as well as the inevitable
complications stemming from their vastly different backgrounds.</P>
<P>        There's nothing new about the structure of "Notting
Hill";
the "rich girl falls for poor boy" scenario is
well-established,
having been employed in movies ranging from "Titanic" to
Disney's
"Lady and the Tramp," and the delights of the film certainly
owe
nothing to the formulaic way in which the story devlops.
Still,
the movie does offer some pleasant surprises along its journey
to
Happily Ever After-ville.  The biggest one: the performances.
Although the lead actors are fine (and Hugh Grant is
significantly
more than that), the show is stolen by the strong supporting
cast,
which include a wheelchair-bound woman that Will has always
loved...
despite the fact that she's married to his best friend.  Will's
little sister is pleasantly freaky, stuck working in London's
worst record store to make ends meet.  Comic relief is provided
by Will's sleezy roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), the Jar Jar Binks
of the story.  I was quite frankly more interested in learning
more about these folks than I was in seeing the outcome of the
tale itself, primarily because they were all so interesting and
unusual.</P>
<P>        Visual grace is not Roger Michell's strong point.  Most
of the time he chooses to simply point the camera at his cast
and turn it on, allowing the sweet chemistry between his two
lead
actors and the clever screenplay from Richard Curtis to carry
the
momentum.   Much has been made of the fact that the movie was
actually shot in the Notting Hill region of London, but we
never
get to see very much of it, and that's a little disappointing.
Too much of the film plays like a montage of talking heads:
there's a lot of dialogue, and not much else.  There are,
however,
two amazing shots that I must make mention of.  The first is
the
impressive pullback of Anna and Will sitting alone on a park
bench,
enjoying a rare moment of privacy together.  Through the
pullback,
the camera not only allows them a much-deserved moment of
solitude,
but also foreshadows a later discussion on perspective, a scene
upon which the whole movie hinges.  There's also a great
weather
montage: Michell shows the passage of several months by having
Will walk down the street, through bright sunlight, into rain,
then snow, and back into the sunlight again, all in one
continuous shot, while Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine" plays
softly in the background.</P>
<P>        "Notting Hill" isn't really a film about relationships
so much as the concept of 'celebrity.'  We're given a glimpse
into
the claustrophobic life of a big-name movie star, watching as
her
personal life is basically irradicated before our very eyes.
It's
undeniably interesting... but surprisingly, it's not really
involving on an emotional level.  Although Grant and Roberts
look
great together, I had trouble believing their relationship.
The
script flings them together much too quickly-- the first kiss
occurs after they've been together only a handful of minutes.
Nor
did I understand why Grant's character, so charming and
intelligent,
was utterly smitten with a woman who treats him so horribly.
It's
probably not a good sign when, while watching a romantic
comedy,
you're hoping the guy will dump the girl and find someone who
actually deserves his affections.  I can understand the lure
and
appeal of Hollywood glitz and fairy dust, but they should not
be
a key factor in deciding whether or not to pursue a
relationship
with a person.</P>
<P>        There are some problems with the film--and significant
ones--
but in the end I was won over by the movie's utter sweetness
and
great comedy.  I don't often laugh out loud at the theater, but
"Notting Hill" got me on at least five occasions, and had the
rest of the audience rolling in the aisles as well.  It's that
beloved rarity: a romantic comedy in which the humor is
actually
given the same amount of attention as the love story.  The
touching
but hilarious scene in which Will poses as a reporter for
"Horse and
Hound" magazine simply so he can be near his beloved shows both
the absurdity of love, and the lengths to which people will go
to
keep it.  The entire movie is full of gems like this.</P>
<P>        "Notting Hill" is a paint-by-numbers story, completely
predictable from start to finish... but since the ride was an
entertaining one, I have absolutely no problem with that.</P>
<PRE>                 RATING: ***  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<PRE>       ("Notting Hill" sweetens the deal on Friday, May 28th.)</PRE>
