<PRE>Titanic
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) Modern-day treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton)
hears the story of one survivor from the sinking of the Titanic. When
her story is done, Brock says that even though he's been working on the
Titanic for 3 years, he never got it. Until he heard her story, he never
saw past the wreckage on the bottom of the Atlantic. </P>
<P>The same might be said of the audience after seeing the movie. Without a
good story, the sinking of the Titanic could have been just another
special effects movie, more interested in the ship itself than on how it
affected lives. Instead, Cameron made the Titanic the BACKGROUND for his
story. </P>
<P>Titanic is great. The melodramatic love story is the perfect foreground
for the sinking of the largest passenger ship in history. The film is a
technical marvel, and even without the spectacular sinking, the story is
engaging. </P>
<P>The melodrama involves Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor boy who wins a
ticket to America on the Titanic in a poker game, and Rose (Kate
Winslet), a young socialite who is traveling to America for her wedding
to Cal. Though Rose doesn't love Cal, she must marry him because she and
her mother are penniless, unbeknownst to the rest of high society. </P>
<P>Jack falls for Rose as soon as he sees her and is determined to win her
in spite of the class barrier. Rose doesn't even know Jack exists until
he comes along as she contemplates throwing herself into the Atlantic.
Not only does he talk her down from the ledge, but when her handlers
suddenly arrive and assume the worst of Jack, he keeps his mouth shut,
protecting her. </P>
<P>The two fall deeply in love and talk of how they might escape together
when the ship lands. If this were any other ship, the conflict of two
lovers fighting class barriers would have been interesting enough to
make a movie. Instead, their relationship faces an even bigger conflict
. . . . </P>
<P>There is a love scene in the movie that, for me, is one of the best in
quite a while. The two lovers don't have sex, or even touch. Rose knows
that Jack is an artist, so she insists that he sketch her in the nude.
Both are just shy enough and just eager enough to make the amorous
tension wonderful. </P>
<P>DiCaprio is great in the male lead role. Ever since his astonishing
debut in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, his presence brings high
expectations. Not all of his films have been great (THE BASKETBALL
DIARIES,for example) but he shines in TITANIC. His character loves life,
and DiCaprio "lets his heart soar," as Cameron aptly put it. </P>
<P>Kathy Bates was good in a small, sympathetic role: the unsinkable Molly
Brown. In Jack and Rose's story, Molly was a bridge between their social
classes. She had new money but started out poor, so she was interested
in seeing Jack succeed among the upper crust. </P>
<P>The biggest flaw for me is the inexcusable 2-dimensionality of the
movie's "villain," Cal (Billy Zane). I have already called the story a
melodrama, and in melodramas, the villains are made of evil. But when
Cal had already lost the girl, and a chance for redemption presented
itself, he continued to be a prick. </P>
<P>The special effects of the launching and the sinking of Titanic are
fascinating. Roger Ebert even called them seamless, but he was wrong.
Some scenes are clearly made of computerized cartoons and composites.
For example, when the ship launches and the camera flys overhead, some
of the figures on deck move very artificially. These effects may be more
elaborately made than ever before, but they are still not seamless. </P>
<P>No amount of computer animation can yet pass for reality, which is
probably why Cameron chose to build a huge set that could actually sink.
The investment was worthwhile, for if the entire sinking only happened
on a computer, the effect would not have worked. The reality of the wood
and metal and water needed to be felt and seen. (See the last plane
crash in AIR FORCE ONE for a "realistic" cartoon that just isn't real
enough.) </P>
<P>Because everyone knows the fate of the Titanic, Cameron (who also wrote
the script) included some ironic foreshadowing. There's almost too much
and it distracts in parts. Nevertheless, I found myself rooting for the
lovers to make it in America, in spite of their certain fate. </P>
<P>And because the previews tell you where the lovers are when the ship
goes down, one would expect a predictable ending. But one doesn't need
surprise to create tension, as Cameron deftly showed. The slow march of
floodwaters, the violent cracking of a doomed ship, and the
unpredictable human response to certain death add to an incredibly
tense, emotionally draining experience. </P>
<P>In fact, some might say that there is no best "part" of the movie; that
the best thing about it is the entire experience, the spectacle of it
all. The daunting length and melodramatics of the movie ask a lot from
audiences, but that contributes to the sense of TITANIC being more an
event than a movie. Also, the sheer size, not just of the subject
matter, but of the length, the cast and the cost of the film makes it a
once-in-five-years movie.</P>
