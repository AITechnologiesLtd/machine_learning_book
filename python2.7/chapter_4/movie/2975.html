<P>     Break out the whips and chains!  We're going on a trip to an
island called Eden, where the dominatrix Mistress Lisa hold court and
just about anything (supposedly) goes.  And, judging from the actual
journey, if author Anne Rice has any complaints about the shoddy
treatment her book got in this limp translation, they're probably
well-justified.</P>
<P>     EXIT TO EDEN is really two stories in one, which is this case
means less, not more, for the money.  The film exhibits a split
personality in just about every area, from its views on sex down to its
uncertainty about whether it wants to be a slapstick crime farce or an
offbeat romance.</P>
<P>     Elliot (STRICTLY BALLROOM's Paul Mercurio) is a celebrated
photographer with a penchant for being spanked (developed when he was a
lad in Australia).  He signs up for a trip to an exclusive B&D fantasy
island and, once there, falls hopelessly in thrall to Mistress Lisa
(Dana Delany), the raven-haired resort boss.  Much to her surprise and
dismay, she finds herself responding to this new, individualistic
guest, and certain involuntary defense mechanisms spring into place.</P>
<P>     Taken alone, this particular storyline might have made an
enjoyable motion picture.  If he didn't want to face up to certain
serious issues, director Garry Marshall could have done something
similar to what he did with PRETTY WOMAN.  Unfortunately, this is only
half the plot--and the better half by far.</P>
<P>     Quite by accident, Elliot has taken the only existing photographs
of super criminal Omar (Stuart Wilson).  Since Omar is incredibly
camera-shy, he and his cohort in crime Nina (Iman) follow Elliot to the
island with the goal of killing him and retrieving the film.
Fortunately, a pair of repressed Los Angeles cops (played by Rosie
O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd) are hot on the trail.  Everyone eventually
ends up on Eden.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of attempts at slapstick in EXIT TO EDEN, none of
which work.  In motion pictures, there are few lamer things than jokes
that fall flat, and this movie is full of them.  Despite the presence
of accomplished comics O'Donnell and Aykroyd, EXIT TO EDEN is almost
laughless.  Worse still, all the failed humor detracts from time that
might better have been spent developing the relationship between Elliot
and Lisa.</P>
<P>     Rather than approaching his potentially-controversial subject
matter with a degree of sensitivity and intelligence, Marshall elects
to adopt a PORKY'S-like, exploitative attitude.  Soft-porn titillation
interferes with story telling, and one wonders whether Delany and
Mercurio were chosen for their roles based on their ability and
charisma, or on the appearance of their naked buns (which get a fair
amount of exposure).</P>
<P>     EXIT TO EDEN has all the ingredients of late-night cable fare.
The film, which invites a decidedly-unfavorable comparison to John
Duigan's SIRENS, isn't so much repugnant as it is disappointing.  It's
"R" rating also raises questions about the basic inconsistency of the
MPAA.  Other, non-mainstream films have gotten "NC-17"s for a lot
less.  Perhaps the Association tempered their rating because they found
EXIT TO EDEN amusing.  If so, they're probably the only ones.</P>
