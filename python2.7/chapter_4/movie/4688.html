<PRE>                                THE PROMISE
                             (DAS VERSPRECHEN)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THE PROMISE (DAS VERSPRECHEN) tells the fictional but realistic
story of a romance that starts with the building of the Berlin Wall in
1961 and ends with its destruction in 1989.  At a dance in the Fall of
1961, five young East Berliners leave to escape using the sewers that
go under the newly constructed wall.  One, Konrad (Anian Zollner as the
younger Konrad and August Zirner as the older one), slips and falls.
He runs home before being caught.  His friends, including his
girlfriend Sophie (Meret Becker as the younger Sophie and Corinna
Harfouch as the older one), escape successfully.  They go to Sophie's
Aunt's (Tina Engel) West Berlin house which they say is a "villa" since
afterall it has two bathrooms.</P>
<P>     Her aunt is a fashion designer thus providing a natural contrast
between the wealth of the West and sparseness of the East even though
the trams in the East proclaim in bold banners that the "DDR is the
Industrial Leader of the World."  The parents of the escaped kids are
forbidden by the East German police from ever sending or receiving mail
from their kids.</P>
<P>     Konrad first becomes a guard on the wall, but eventually becomes
an astronomer at the University.  Because of this he is permitted
limited travel and sees Sophie a few times over the thirty years.  One
of these times is 1968 during the Prague Spring.  They have undying
love for each other, but for various reasons he is never able to come
to her in the West until the wall falls.  The movie is about their love
and torment and about the turmoil and repression of the Communist
governments of the East.  It is a sad and melancholic film full of
great dramatic music (Juergen Knieper) filled with violins that added
immensely to the intensity of the emotions.</P>
<P>     When Sophie is in Prague and declares she will stay with him, the
people there laugh at her saying, so "you believe in socialism with a
human face?",  which was the theory of the time and soon to be
discredited.  When the tanks roll in, your heart drops.  Waitresses
serve their customers crying, to which the audience goes along.  The
skillful editor (Suzanne Baron) knows just when to mix stock historical
footage in with the movie for maximum effect.  Some bide their time and
go along with the events without protest.  As Konrad's Professor Lorenz
(Otto Sander) tells Sophie, "Outrage is quantitative.  It gets used
up."</P>
<P>     Through the years whenever Sophie and Konrad see each other, it
becomes increasing sad.  In the early 80s Konrad asks her, "Can a woman
love a man she has only seen three times in twenty years?"  He knows
that there never will be anyone for him but her.  He is shown making
one deal with the devil (Communists) after another in attempts to be
with her.</P>
<P>     Konrad's sister Barbara (Susanne Uge as the younger Barbara and
Eva Mattes as the older) is a Protestant minister who fight against the
regime no matter how costly it is to her and to her family.  Refreshing
to see religion as a force for good albeit her attempts were all total
failures.</P>
<P>     The ending when the wall comes down is incredible.  Lots of misty
eyes in the audience.  The director and the cinematographer (Franz
Rath) knew just how to handle it in a simple and controlled fashion.
One of the East Germans is interviewed at the wall.  Confused, lost and
depressed at the upheaval in her life she feels that "when the cage
opens after thirty years, you can't fly anymore."</P>
<P>     The acting by the four actors playing the two leads is phenomenal
as is the direction.  I was very moved by this picture.  It forms
wonderful images in your subconscious that stay with you.  This is a
movie about love kept.  Although it has many a tragic scene, the
ultimate message made me feel like I had just heard Beethoven's Ode to
Joy being sung - very uplifting.</P>
<P>     The fine script (Felice Laudadio, Peter Schneider, Margarethe Von
Trotta) develops what could have easily been a complex and long movie
into an accessible and standard length film.  The characters are all
ones that the audience cares about, and by the end, dry eyes are to
come by.  And yet the script never manipulates the audience, rather it
approaches the story in a remarkable low key fashion.  The East is
shown to be full of Orwellian logic.  When border guards hesitate to
kill potential escapees, their officers accuse them of being "against
peace."  There are simple scenes of people staring with binoculars
wistfully across the border from their balconies.</P>
<P>     When I was at Berkeley getting my doctorate in the late 60s, one
of my friends and fellow student got out of Czechoslovakia right after
the Prague Spring.  His brother was a writer who spent a lot of time in
jail so all of this repression there rang true to me.  By the way, his
brother later became Czechoslovakia's first president.  So there too
was a happy ending.</P>
<P>     THE PROMISE reminded me somewhat of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF
BEING which is certainly a compliment, but THE PROMISE is a unique show
thanks to the script and the artful direction of Margarethe Von Trotta.
She is in total control.  The casting is excellent.  I did not realize
for quite a while that the older Sophie was not the same actress as the
younger one.  Konrad was not quite as close, but very similar.  In an
American production, we would have spent a ton of money and had the
actors spend hours every day getting made to look older through makeup.
I liked Von Trotta's different actors approach.</P>
<P>     THE PROMISE runs just 1:59 but manages to cover thirty years with
perfect pacing.  You will never be bored nor will you feel cheated that
they are trying to cram too much stuff in.  The film is in German with
easy to follow English subtitles, and it is rated R.  Although it does
have brief nudity and a little sex, I can not remember any violence.
It would be fine for absolutely any teenager.  I strongly recommend
this film to you.  If you are at all interested in love or history, you
must see this film.  It will touch your heart as it did mine.  Finally,
I award it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
