<P>In 1983, Tom Cruise became a star in the brash comedy "Risky Business." 
In the ensuing years, he has made films that ranged from the sublime 
("Rainman") to the...well, to "Days Of Thunder." In the exuberant "Jerry 
Maguire," Cruise's outstanding performance is a powerful reminder that 
beneath that dazzling smile lies one hell of an actor.</P>
<P>Jerry Maguire is an extremely powerful sports agent, a shark who 
manipulates his superstar clients with a combination of ass-kissing and 
motivational seminar babble, while securing them obscene amounts of money 
from team-owners and endorsement packages. One night, in a crisis of 
conscience, he pounds out an inspirational  "mission statement", 
encouraging his company to shift their attitude and focus on fewer 
clients (which, of course, means less money.) Shortly after distributing 
his manifesto, he recognizes that he has committed corporate suicide, but 
the damage is done. Within days, he is fired, and finds himself starting 
over, with one client (Gooding), one employee (Zellweger), and a strong 
sense of desperation.</P>
<P>Jerry Maguire isn't a simple story of redemption. Director Cameron Crowe 
("Say Anything", "Singles") is far more clever. Maguire doesn't 
necessarily want to stop being a shark. He still thrives on the 
adrenaline-charged lifestyle, on being a power player. What he wants is a 
home base, a safe place where he can connect with others on a more human 
level. The joy of the film comes from the unexpected twists in his 
personal journey, and the extremely rich supporting cast.</P>
<P>Cuba Gooding Jr. Is electric as Rod Tidwell, a wide receiver for the 
Arizona Cardinals. He yearns to be a spoiled superstar; for the sheer 
thrill of it, to be sure, but also to build a secure future for his 
loving family. Gooding's outbursts, both of temperament and exhilaration, 
provide some of the film's most satisfying moments.</P>
<P>Playing Maguire's assistant, Renee Zellweger gives a subtle and rich 
performance. As an idealistic single mother, she initially seems 
painfully naïve, but as her relationship with Maguire builds, the 
strength and inherent decency beneath her wide-eyes emerges. The love 
story between her, Maguire and her young son (six year old charmer 
Jonathan Lipnicki, with a beatific smile that lights up the theater) is 
compelling and absolutely credible, a rarity in contemporary films.</P>
<P>After its frenetic start, Jerry Maguire leads viewers on a funny and 
moving tale of love and growth. The combination of Crowe's exceptional 
script and the superior cast, highlighted by Cruise's flawless 
performance, results in one of the years most substantial movies. </P>
