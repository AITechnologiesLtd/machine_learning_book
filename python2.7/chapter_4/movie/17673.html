<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>Bound is a movie that I think pretty much everyone should see.  For those
who enjoy a well-written, suspenseful crime drama, this movie is a good
choice.  For anybody who is more interestd in astonishing visuals that you
want to watch over and over again, this is _unquestionably_ the movie you
want.  If you have more simple tastes, there are quite a few amusing jokes,
some really good acting (Pantoliano is particularly impressive), and even
a lesbian sex scene...  The list goes on and on.  No matter what your
reason, though, it's a really good movie.</P>
<P>For me, the best part about it is the visuals -- the brothers Wachowski have
accompilished a great deal on what is probably not a huge budget.  The movie
has a great Noir sort of feal, and the directors went to great lengths to
make every shot in the movie interesting and very pleasing to the eye.
Great
use of slow-motion and interesting camera effects abound.</P>
<P>As I said, though, there is more here than a technical marvel.  The writing
(also the work of Larry and Andy Wachowski) is first rate -- the story,
though not the most original ever,  has some variations on the norm, and
there's a good blend of humor and drama.  I don't really want to give away
anything about the plot, so I'm going to keep my mouth shut.  Basically,
though, it's a mob/crime kind of a thing -- sort of.</P>
<P>It's worth saying that though there are good performances all around, the
Wachowskis and the cinematographer, Bill Pope (he has also worked on "Zero
Effect" which I will review sometime as well as "Clueless", "Fire in the
Sky", and "Army of Darkness"), are the clear stars of this production.
There are way too many things I love about this film for me to list them
all, and most of them would just be "this part's awesome" or somesuch, and
that wouldn't be much help to anybody.</P>
<P>Now, even if the movie doesn't sound that good (I didn't think so when other
people told me about it), please do yourself a favor and try it out.  Also,
don't let a dislike for one or all of the stars stop you from watching it
either -- I most definitely was not a fan of Tilly prior to this film, and I
certainly had no positive feelings about anyone else in the film.  This
movie
will change that.</P>
<P>Not seeing this film would have been one of the worst mistakes of my life.
It is a well-conceived and very well-exectued movie.  The directors have a
unique vision that I think make this movie one of the better ones I have
ever seen.</P>
