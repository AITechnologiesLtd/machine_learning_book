Review: The Virgin Suicides (1999)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[3.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The challenges of adolescence is a topic that has been frequently
explored. It is a universal theme that practically all viewers can
identify with. This film explores this topic with the allegorical
story of a troubled family.</P>
<P>The film is set in a middle class Michigan neighborhood of the 1970's.
A narrator (voice of Giovanni Ribisi) introduces the story beginning
with the suicide attempt by the youngest of five daughters of the
Lisbon family. The narrator is recounting the story from his past,
since he was a member of a group of boys who knew and liked the girls.
A foreboding tone of impending doom is set immediately, and the
details slowly unfold. The girls are attractive, cheerful, and
seemingly well-adjusted, so no one understands how they came to their
terrible fate. Although their social activities were restricted by
their parents, particularly their devoutly religious mother, their
family never outwardly appeared exceptionally draconian or
dysfunctional.</P>
<P>By setting the story in the 1970's and displaying the pop culture of
the era, the film uses nostalgia to evoke a feeling of remembrance,
but this is not the primary focus of the story. The film has a cogent,
if oblique, plot that it develops. From the film's title, the
narrator's introduction, and the symbolism of the opening scene where
municipal workers mark the Lisbon's tree for removal (to control a
Dutch Elm Disease epidemic), the eventual result is clear.</P>
<P>What differentiates this story from typical teenage angst stories is
the fact that the source of the conflict is not part of the plot. The
perspective is from the outside, as the narrator is merely an observer
of the events. The narrator states that the events of their
adolescence have lingered into their adulthood, and they habitually
reflect this one troubling dimension of their remembered past. The
point being made is that among the halcyon days of youth, there are
problems that may not always be tangible. It is not with morbid
perversity that the tragic events are examined, but rather as a symbol
of part of the pain of growing up.</P>
<P>All aspects of the film are executed well. The story, based on a novel
written by Jeffrey Eugenides, provides a strong foundation. Director
Sofia Coppola skillfully focuses the scope of the film to its
essential elements. The film uses nostalgia for a past decade without
becoming a slave to this dimension. The acting is uniformly
proficient. All the roles of the adolescents are believable, and the
performances of James Woods and Kathleen Turner as the Lisbon parents
required subtlety, as their involvement in their daughters' torment
are unclear.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This is a highly mood-oriented film whose story
does not attempt to raise questions and answer them. It is a well
crafted exploration of the remembrance of past tragedies and
mysteries. Although it has some light-hearted moments, the film is
essentially quite dark and brooding. It is a success because it keeps
esoteric perspective, and manages to communicate an understandable,
yet murky, story.</P>
