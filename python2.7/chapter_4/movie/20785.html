<P>Picture: * * *½
The picture on this DVD in incredible. Besides a few moments where it is a
little dark, the picture is sharp and clear. Without having any lines or
anything. To me the picture could have been mastered a bit brighter in some
scenes, but then again the film in the theatre was dark too.</P>
<P>Sound- * * * *
Incredible. The film has 3 ch. English Dolby Surround 5.1, with music-only
audio only tracks and commentaries during the film from the cast and crew. When
you are in a theatre with great sound and the sound is behind you, even if you
have only 2 speakers, the 5.1 surround really is around you and amazing. I
would recommend getting audio equipment or speakers for best expierience.</P>
<P>Special Features- * * * *
The best feature of the DVD is the special features. It contains bio's of the
crew, including awards they've won, films they were in where they were born and
so on. It also has a great feature called 'Follow The White Rabbit' in which a
little rabbit icon appears at the bottom of the screen and when you press
select the DVD shows you how they made that certain special effect. Also it
contains the HBO First Look: The Matrix, a documentary of the making of the
film, 'Take the Red Pills' which shows you more of the making of the film
including the bullet scene. It also has scene selection, english subtitles,
Interactive menus, and enhanced features for your DVD-Rom PC, which includes
Are You The One? Challenge, Screenplay, Storyboards, and the genre essays 'Do
you know kung fu" Original theatrical website and sampler trailers.</P>
<P>Film Rating- * * *
Some may be disappointed with The Matrix. I'll tell you I was. I sat there and
sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen. Now wait wait, I know
most of you loved it, and I'm not saying I didn't like it. What I'm saying is
the first half was extremely slow. Now seeing the trailer it makes you think
the whole entire movie is one big special effects show. Don't be fooled, this
movie has a big story. And big chunks of talky moments. But I will admit the
special effects and the acting were above par, deserving the rating above.</P>
<P>Ok now to the story. Well this may take a while. Ok first of all, our world we
live in now, is not the real world, actually we live inside a computer
generated world known as The Matrix. A man played by Keanu Reeves is about to
find that out, when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world.
He does so, and finds out that he can do anything, be anything he wants to be.
But he has to fight a 'Matrix skipping' bad guy, who wants to send him back to
his own world or destroy him.</P>
<P>Laurence Fishburne, his guide of sorts plays his character well as does Keanu
Reeves. But I sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the
special effects were. Yeah there were some in the first half but not enough.
The trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this
was a special effects laden movie.</P>
<P>Now for the second half, it is explosive, and saves the movie. Some of the
special effects and fighting were breathtaking. The sound, the music, and all
the effects were effective, and the last hour kept us entertained. But with a
running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, this movie is at least 40 minutes too
long. One would have wished for a better 'Matrix', but I do have to say, I did
like it and I was entertained.</P>
<P>Overall DVD Rating- * * *½
The Special Features, sound, picture and film are all good on the DVD. Though
the film wasn't as great as I thought it would be and a bit slow in parts the
special effects were definately amazing. The 5.1 Surround was absolutely
incredible, and I would definately recommend the DVD of 'The Matrix.</P>
