<PRE>                        LORD OF ILLUSIONS
                      A film review by Gail
                       Copyright 1995 Gail</PRE>
<P>     Okay, just a brief review of Clive Barker's LORD OF ILLUSIONS.
If any of you out there are familiar with Barker's work and style then
this movie will not disappoint. Barker has again managed to create a
movie so powerful and disturbing that it gets under your skin and stays
with you long after the movie ends.</P>
<P>     The movie itself stars Scott Bakula of "Quantum Leap" fame, as a
private eye who gets assigned an unusual case involving a cult leader
and his followers.  Whilst the story itself is at times predictable,
the gory and sometimes sickening effects have you glued.</P>
<P>     All in all this movie is definitely not for the faint hearted but
a must see for those of you who crave a good horror flick but are sick
of the usual hum drum efforts of "Freddy" and the like.</P>
<PRE>Cheers, Gail...</PRE>
