<P>Following a sneak preview for "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," 
several friends asked my opinion of the comedy. When I shrugged it off as 
merely "okay," the disappointment and annoyance in their eyes was 
unmistakable. Like so many others, they were psyched up for this sequel 
to the 1997 spoof and eager to play the "Austin Powers" game, tossing 
around catch phrases like "Yeah, baby, yeah," "shagadelic," and "Oh, 
behave!" Then along comes Movie Boy to rain on their parade.</P>
<P>I freely admit to being mystified over the immense popularity that has 
built up around "Austin Powers." A modest success when released 
theatrically, the film went on to become a huge hit on video. Perhaps 
repeated viewings add to the enjoyment of the absurdist humor. Whatever. 
I watched the original only once and found it intermittently funny, but 
too thin to warrant a second look. I feel the same way about the sequel. 
Packed with gags -- some clever, many lame and almost all puerile -- the 
film has too many dead spots between the laughs, and I caught myself 
checking my watch almost as often as I chuckled. In other words, "Austin 
Powers 2" is "okay."</P>
<P>But "okay" isn't good enough for fans caught up in Powers-mania. While 
many have complained about the unrelenting hype for "Star Wars: The 
Phantom Menace," few seem bothered by the massive barrage of ads for this 
film. Granted, some of the commercials are a hoot, but still, the 
ubiquitous advertising campaign left me tired of Mike Myers face long 
before entering the theater.</P>
<P>When giving advice to student reviewers at seminars, I urge them to avoid 
the inclusion of lengthy plot descriptions, explaining that writers who 
do so are generally disinterested in the film and merely using a long 
synopsis as a lazy way to pad the word count of their article. With that 
in mind, here is a lengthy plot description of "Austin Powers: The Spy 
Who Shagged Me."</P>
<P>The film begins in 1999, with freeze-dried '60s super-spy Powers (Mike 
Myers, who also plays Dr. Evil, a Scottish thug called Fat Bastard, and a 
'60s guru) honeymooning with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) when 
he discovers that his new bride is actually a "fembot" with a bomb 
planted in her noggin. Single again, Powers learns that his nemesis, Dr. 
Evil, has returned from outer space with a new diabolical scheme to wreck 
havoc. Using a time machine (with enjoyably cheesy visuals straight out 
of "The Time Tunnel"), Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 and steals Austin 
Powers' "mojo," leaving the oh-so-groovy secret agent impotent in all 
senses of the word.</P>
<P>But, thanks to British Intelligence, Austin Powers also has access to a 
time machine, in the form of a psychedelic Volkswagen Beetle (his travel 
mode echoes that of the "Back to the Future" trilogy). So he returns to 
the Swinging Sixties to regain his virility and stop Dr. Evil from 
destroying the world. Along the way, Powers picks up a new love interest, 
American CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who joins him 
on his biggest adventure yet. </P>
<P>NOTE: The preceding plot description ate up 188 words -- not bad, not bad 
at all.</P>
<P>In "Austin Powers'" scattershot screenplay are a number of undeniably 
entertaining scenes. Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) appears on a Jerry 
Springer Show episode titled "My Father Is Evil and Wants to Take Over 
the World," only to have his dad make a surprise appearance that, 
naturally, leads to a brawl. Jerry Springer segments in movies have been 
done to death, but this one is nicely-executed and plays well. </P>
<P>A particularly witty scene has Powers addressing the audience directly, 
saying "You know what's amazing is how England looks in no way like 
southern California" just prior to a fight obviously set in the southern 
California hills, with a red British phone booth incongruously placed on 
the side of the road for "authenticity." </P>
<P>My favorite bit shows Dr. Evil piloting a spaceship that resembles male 
genitalia, with rapid-cuts of various characters' reactions to the sight 
(a radar operator says "It looks like a giant..." then the film cuts to a 
fighter pilot shouting "Dick! Dick, look out to starboard!" and so forth).
 The sequence is juvenile as hell and very funny.</P>
<P>A lot of the movie falls flat, however. Endless segues of a go-go dancing 
Powers grow tiresome, and Heather Graham lacks comic spark. The visuals 
of Dr. Evil's tiny clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), are amusing, but 
Troyer's limited acting skills mute the humorous potential. A reprise of 
a hilarious scene from the first film, depicting Austin frolicking nude 
with objects strategically placed to cover his "naughty parts," fails to 
amuse because you can see the "Cops"-style optical blur placed over his 
genitals.</P>
<P>Of course, "Austin Powers" is a critic-proof movie. Fans will drink in 
every second, quote the catch-phrases like crazy and wonder why a spoil-
sport like me bothered to critique their movie.</P>
<PRE>Good question.</PRE>
