<P>   For the past couple of decades in America, we bear
witness to a traditional assumption turned upside down, the
supposition that parents as a whole are more conservative
than their kids.  Stare with disbelief at yuppies who
concentrate more on their cell phones than on the people
they are with, their brunches at the Odeon, their trips to
Jamaica and their Gucci loafers, and you can believe that the
young no longer try to push their aging parents to the left. 
Quite the contrary.  What the majority of this country's
population find difficult to accept is that life here was not
always so complacent, a desire to make a bundle was not
always the principal object of students in college, and a belief
that politics was a job to be left strictly to the bureaucrats was
not always the nation's creed.  Believe it or not, kids, politics
was not always just the subject of editorials in the good gray
Times, which debated American intervention in Nicaragua
and the Gulf as though these were issues meant to be
studied for a good grade on a midterm.  During the late
1960s and early 1970s, the Vietnam War propelled a large
segment of the nation's young people into taking active and
dangerous stances, getting themselves surveilled, stomped
and otherwise harassed by agencies of the Johnson and
Nixon administrations.</P>
<P>   Abbie Hoffman, arguably the most colorful of the nation's
protesting youth and founder of the Youth International Party
or Yippie! was an unlikely candidate for the honor of turning
many of the sixties' flower children into political activists.  A
nice Jewish boy from Worcester, Massachusetts, Hoffman
was born in 1936, got his Bachelor's from Brandeis
University, got arrested in Mississippi for registering Blacks
during Freedom Summer, and sold the products of poor
people's coops in Mississippi two years later in a crafts store
in New York City.  Best known for his rejection of American
corporate culture, he and some pals threw money from the
visitors' gallery of the Stock Exchange in 1967, causing a riot
as the traders scrambled for the cash.  During an anti-war
demonstration, he led 50,00 people to surround the Pentagon
to try to levitate the building by their psychic energy.  When
the Yippies held a so-called Festival of Life at the 1968
Democratic National Convention while protesting American
involvement in Vietnam, violence led to arrests which in turn
led to the Chicago Seven Trial--whose principal image was
that of Black Panther defendant Bobby Seale, bound and
gagged to a chair for disrupting the court.  When Hoffman
was arrested for selling cocaine and faced a life sentence, he
disappeared for six years, and became an environmental
activist under the false name of Barry Freed.</P>
<P>   Does what you just read sound exciting?  Moving?
Poignant?  Maybe not.  But in the hands of Robert
Greenwald, who directs "Steal This Movie" (ironically with the
financing of hedge funds on Wall Street), the story of Abbie
Hoffman and his influence on American politics becomes
everything that the printed word lacks.  While the picture is
unabashedly pro-Hoffman and pro- just about every activity
entered into by him and his friends and followers, it deserves
to be seen by a large audience for bringing the man's
endeavors to glorious life, conveying not only the excitement
of the anti-war protests but even more important the price
that Hoffman paid in loneliness--in the tremendous emotional
pain that the man went though when he was unable to see
his wife and child for six years except for brief periods of time
under a pseudonym.  The misery which literally drove him
crazy is conveyed in such a trenchant manner that we can
understand what made Hoffman take chances by letting down
his guard and in ultimately revealing his actual identity to his
child while still in hiding.</P>
<P>   Abbie Hoffman, who died by suicide in 1989 and is
portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio, would have been pleased by
the casting.  D'Onofrio, who is eight inches taller than the
activist, is better looking and speaks more eloquently than the
guy he's portraying, successfully adopting Hoffman's native
New England accent.  Director Greenwald takes us to
Hoffman in the late seventies, showing the fugitive from
justice as he contacts a magazine reporter by pay phone,
hoping that a compassionate article would allow him to return
to society without serving time.  From that interview,
Greenwald cuts to the key points in the man's life, beginning
with his meeting on a bus with his future wife, Anita (Janeane
Garofalo).  </P>
<P>   The energetic, even charismatic Hoffman proves to be a
brilliant organizer, gathering thousands of like-minded young
people to a march on the Pentagon in opposition to the
Vietnam War.  These actions lead to the consequent
surveillance set up by the J. Edgar Hoover's FBI on him and
his friends in the leadership of the Yippies, particularly Jerry
Rubin (Kevin Corrigan), Tom Hayden (Troy Garity), Abbie's
wife Anita, and his lawyer, Gerry Lefcourt (Kevin Pollak). 
Photographer Denis Lenoir adds verisimilitude to the
proceedings by injecting grainy, newsreel-type pictures into
the movie to give the story the feel of a documentary.  A
large segment of the movie deals with Hoffman's utterly
romantic meeting with Anita, who joins him in activities such
as the anti-war demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, the bliss of their union
marred by Hoffman's eventual bonding while on the run with
the Swedish-American beauty, Johanna Lawrenson (Jeanne
Tripplehorn).</P>
<P>   At times, however, Greenwald seems to be talking down to
his audience as though he were filming a lesson for a high-
school social studies class while throwing in high drama to
come across to an adolescent audience as cool.  On the
whole, however, Greenwald--and his producer Jon Avnet--
made the right decision by eschewing a talking-heads
documentary and going with this penetrating and lively biopic
(however one-sided) on an ordinary fellow who made a name
for himself in the sort of youthful political activism that seems
all but dead today.</P>
