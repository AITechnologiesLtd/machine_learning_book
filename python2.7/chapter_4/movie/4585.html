<P>"Mr. Holland's Opus" is a "biopic"(biographical picture), a 
genre common in the 1930s and generally reserved for famous 
figures. Mr. Holland is not famous. He is a well-trained 
performer-composer who, tired of dragging himself and his wife 
from odd job to odd job, decides to try teaching near 
Portland,  Oregon, in the newly named John F. Kennedy High 
School. He plans to stay only for a short while and devote 
himself to composing. He remains for at least 30 years, 
through 1995. devoting himself to young people.</P>
<P>The biopic, smoothly combined with a school picture with a 
difference, becomes a triple whammy paean to music, education 
and the teaching profession.  While there have been hundreds 
of movies involving schools, very few reach the seriousness 
and depth of this film. Fewer yet depict so well a teacher's 
dedication. </P>
<P>Arguably, the first classic school picture was Jean Vigo's 
"Zero for Conduct," in which all the teachers but one (a 
younger newcomer who clowns like Charlie Chaplin) were 
miserable creatures  loathed by the students.  Schools were 
present in the pleasantly corny Andy Hardy series. Later,  
American high schools (Ridgemont, Cooley, Rock 'n' Roll, 
Central, et al.) were venues for student sheenanigans. So were 
the comic British "St. Trinian's" series.  Hardly any students 
ever seem  to study in those movies.  </P>
<P>In a  handful of fine, non-comedic foreign works l("Pocket 
Money,"  "Au Revoir les Enfants,"  "Heavenly Creatures")  the 
actual educational process in them was secondary to other, 
serious themes. </P>
<P>A few schools were the settings for personal dramas ("The 
Browning Version"),  dark deeds ("Diabolique," "Unman, 
Wittering and Zigo," "Pretty Maids All in a Row") or armed 
revolts (the British "If" that derived from "Zero for 
Conduct").  Two notable films centered on girls' crushes on 
their female teachers, the German classic "Maedchen in 
Uniform" and the little-known French  "Olivia."</P>
<P>"Lean on Me" was about a disciplinarian principal. "Madame 
Sousatzka," where the teacher gives private lessons, stresses 
eccentricity, as does "Dead Poets Society. " There is, of 
course, Frederick Wiseman's epoch-making "High School," but 
that's a documentary. And so on...</P>
<P>Among the movies that focus strongly on truly dedicated 
schoolteachers, the more familiar titles include a classic 
"Goodbye Mr. Chips," as well as "The Blackboard Jungle," "To 
Sir, with Love," "Conrack," "Ciao Professore!," and the 
wonderfully quirky "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." I would 
also recommend the odd but successful casting of Bette Davis 
in an older movie, "The Corn Is Green." </P>
<P>"Mr. Holland" joins this small, select group, in a different 
context and with a new approach. Glenn Holland at first feels 
and fumbles his way to teach musically inept and cacophonous 
kids and to put up with a fine but demanding principal 
(Dukakis, with a delicious wink in her eyes) and her 
semi-martinet, crew-cut assistant principal.  Gradually, 
Holland learns how to teach, and does so superbly. Slowly, he 
gets caught up in the passion for teaching. He also reaches a 
persuasive level of eloquence without ever becoming a 
goodie-goodie speech-maker. </P>
<P>A natural, what with his original methods, warmth, love of 
music and the arts, Mr. Holland forms students who are almost 
too accomplished to be true. He must face the killing schedule 
of so many teachers, a the low pay that must be supplemented 
by odds and ends , like driving lessons. Obliged to form a 
marching band, he manages it only through the friendship of 
the gym teacher --for a change, not an uncouth or comical type 
-- and a quid pro quo: Holland will teach an instrument to a 
black wrestler who needs the credit. In one scene, Mr. H.  
improvises tricks that inculcate rhythm to the kid. This could 
be a subtle attack on the old cliche " blacks are born with 
rhythm." There are several more excellent scenes in the film, 
but let the viewer discover them.  </P>
<P>When a son is born to the Hollands he turns out to be deaf.  
The shock to Mr. Holland is not followed by the expected 
sentimentality but by complex, believable reactions which over 
the years include difficulties, frustrations and 
misunderstandings as well as love. </P>
<P>As Mr. H gets older, there is also a nicely handled bit of 
temptation. Typically, script and direction do not make a 
mountain of this or of a mid-life crisis. In general the movie 
skirts schmaltz, feel-good saccharine or feverish drama. It is 
also mercifully free of the usual school bullies, toughs or 
clowning figures. </P>
<P>Perforce episodic, the movie is intercut with documentary 
footage to show the passage of the years and to orient us, a 
procedure that reminds me of Olympia Dukakis addressing 
Holland about his "compass." (See the film and you'll get the 
point). Viewers should be ready for several moments when it 
seems that the movie is about to end.  </P>
<P>The music, classical and popular, is beautiful. The aging of 
the actors (makeup, hair, movements) is most skillful, as is 
the dosage of routine, solemn, funny and sad elements.  
Richard Dreyfuss, in an Oscar-worthy,  sober performance is 
entirely convincing. With luck, some of us had someone like 
Mr. H in our school days. </P>
<P>Many moments are touching and could be eye-wetting, yet all 
done without pulling out all the stops as  "Mr. Holland's 
Opus" remains steadfastly sweet but never becomes cloying, 
never departs from realism. The characters, their lines and 
behavior feel genuine. Even the deaf people are really deaf.  </P>
<P>One small flaw in the movie is the finale's improbably 
well-organized homage to the music teacher. It happens just 
after the school is forced to cut 10 percent of its budget.  
Of course this gets done by eliminating programs in music and 
other arts. </P>
<P>By coincidence, just before seeing the film I had caught 
documentarist Ken Burns on C-Span where, rationally, lucidly 
and passionately he made a case for not cutting federal 
subsidies to the arts. Mr. Holland is not alone in trying to 
send us a message.  </P>
