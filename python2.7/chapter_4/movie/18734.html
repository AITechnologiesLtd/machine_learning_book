<PRE>                               eXistenZ - a film review by Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Virtual reality is a concept that is beginning to lose its luster partly
because no one seems to have the imagination or the stamina to explore it.
After enduring endless ordeals like "Lawnmower Man" and "The Matrix," one can
savor the lurid, fascinating, uneven "eXistenZ," the latest from the twisted
mind of David Cronenberg, who helmed mind and body experiments like "Crash,"
"Videodrome" and "The Naked Lunch." </P>
<P>"eXistenZ" stars Jennifer Jason Leigh as Allegra, a twisted, sexy computer
designer whose latest creation is a game called eXistenZ, a virtual reality
game where a bio-port is connected to the spine, and resembles a fleshy game
pod made of amphibious organs and brain matter. The game begins, but this is
not a world of razzle-dazzle computer pyrotechnics or laser beams or kung-fu
fights. Instead, you experience a world where trout farms exist, guns made of
chicken bones and fire human teeth, people walk and act like zombies, and
Chinese waiters serve you two-headed amphibians. To make matters worse, Allegra
enters her own game with a seemingly incompetent market trainee (Jude Law), who
has not been accommodated with a bio-port. </P>
<P>"eXistenZ" never makes clear when it is a game or when we are seeing reality,
although I am sure that in our reality, two-headed amphibians who seemed to
have wandered in from Jurassic Park are non-existent. Nevertheless,
Cronenberg's idea is to show that a faux reality may not be far from our own -
our feelings and emotions dictate our fantasies, and some are more dangerous
than others. If only he pushed further with this concept as Wim Wenders did
with the dreamlike, humanistic "Until the End of the World," a parable about
the danger of being addicted to visual images. Cronenberg wallows in grisly,
fleshy details and sudden bursts of violence - the most impressive is the
shooting of a Chinese waiter, which shows that the Jude Law character may be
taking the concept of the game's "free will" too far. </P>
<P>The actors follow the command of Cronenberg's universe, and no one ever
overacts even in the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh is indeed one of my favorite
actresses of all time - a quixotic wonder with her expressive eyes, sexual
demeanor, and wavy-like patterns in her blonde curls. She is the perfect
Cronenberg heroine, and we side with her and hope she can survive her own
destructive game. Jude Law reminds me of Rufus Selwell in "Dark City" - he
handles his role with aplomb and subtle smirks directed towards the whole
ridiculous show. I also enjoyed the tense, rat-like Ian Holm as the designer of
the pods - it is a real kick to watch this actor repairing a bloody pod. </P>
<P>"eXistenZ" still has Cronenberg's continuing clinical obsession with flesh and
bodily fluids - it affected me to watch these slimy appendages being applied to
our semi-heroes in agony, as if they couldn't get enough. This is decidedly not
meant for the "Matrix" action crowd. Thus, "eXistenZ" disturbs and intrigues,
but it never is truly profound or provocative. </P>
