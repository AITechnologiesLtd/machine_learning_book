<P>This film is reminiscent of two other films helmed by brother
writer-directors. The first would be 1996's BOUND (8/10) by the
brothers Wachowski, and the other would be BLOOD SIMPLE (8/10), by the
ultimate in brother-tandems in the film industry, Joel and Ethan Coen.
The twin Pate brothers have orchestrated a solid follow-up to their
first film THE GRAVE, which had debuted at the 1996 Sundance Film
Festival. </P>
<P>PLOT:
A wealthy, arrogant, manipulative alcoholic by the name of Wayland gets
interrogated by two tough cops in regards to the murder of a prostitute
found chopped in two pieces. Wayland suffers from a serious case of
temporal lobe epilepsy, and has had a history of deception. The intense
officers also have their own demons, and struggle to determine the
truth and the identity of the real killer in this meandering murder
mystery.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Dark, gritty, engrossing whodunnit, with strong performances by all of
its leads, effective storytelling by the way of the Pate brothers
(despite its convoluted plot) and a unique, if somewhat overdone, style
of directing. This film suggests film noir, but with its proverbial
femme fatale chopped in two, I suppose. The entire story basically
takes place in one interrogation room, with two uncompromising cops
grilling a wealthy suspect, but the superior performances by the
actors, the interesting story line, and the unique flashbacks from
directors Pate, make this film a suspense filled, original tale of
tantalizing inquisitiveness. </P>
<P>It's the type of film that continues to leave you guessing as to the
identity of the perpetrator, even after the final frame of the film has
been faded out. And it's not in the nasty sense of the plot being too
complex, but in the good sense of being able to sit down and discuss it
thought-provokingly with others afterwards. If you are the type of
person who likes to have their films delivered fresh and clean on their
plate, then you will definitely not enjoy this film's unique sense of
serpentine narrative. But for all those who relish the idea of actually
paying close attention to a film, and utilizing most of your brain's
capacities to solve a well-developed mystery, then straddle yourself up
for a good time with this enigmatic confection.</P>
<P>Michael Rooker pulls off another convincing performance as the tough
guy with an attitude, and Penn demonstrates his capacity to act
decently, without having to resort to a swear word every two lines. Tim
Roth does come across as the strongest of the bunch with an excellent
portrayal of a man whose ambitions, dreams and hopes were lost a long
time before his extreme wealth and epileptic condition drove him to
psychologically deceptive distractions. The directing is also uniquely
envisioned to take full advantage of an otherwise dull setting, but the
twin brothers do tend to ambitiously overwork the camera at some
points. All in all, this film demonstrates an involved story line with
many twists and turns, solid performances by its leads, a unique
filming style and an all-around good time for all those looking to
untangle a quirky murder mystery.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Renee Zellweger met producer Peter Glatzer and the Pate Brothers at a
bus stop in the snow at Sundance in 1996. They had just seen Zellweger
in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD and were so impressed with her performance that
the role of Elizabeth was written for her. Shortly thereafter,
Zellweger was cast opposite Tom Cruise in the critically-acclaimed hit
JERRY MAGUIRE (7.5/10).
Renee took her first acting class to ensure graduating from The
University of Texas with a literature degree, made her film debut while
still in Austin in Richard Linklater's DAZED AND CONFUSED (7/10).
Jonas Pate graduated from Princeton University in 1993. His twin
brother Josh graduated from Chapel Hill in 1992. The duo joined forces
with Peter Glatzer to create THE GRAVE, their first feature film, which
premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1996. 
Don't blink because you will miss Ellen Burstyn doing her best
impersonation of a "struggling, aging actress playing a bit part in an
independent production", as she portrays the bookie Mook in this film.
HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER was Michael Rooker's first movie
which was filmed in 1986, but was not released until years later.
This film was originally titled LIAR.
This film was shot entirely in South Carolina, home of the Pate
brothers.</P>
