<PRE>                               PHILADELPHIA
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who was fired by his legal firm for
having AIDS.  Denzel Washington is the ambulance-chasing lawyer who
prosecutes the law firm for doing this.  Mary Steenburgen defends the
firm.</P>
<P>     I liked this movie as a whole, but found some serious problems
with parts of it.   Tom Hanks acting, for example, is great.  I didn't
know he had the kind of intensity required to display such a range of
emotion so quietly.  He really carries this movie, and deserves the
accolades being heaped upon him for this role, independently of the
courage he showed in taking it.</P>
<P>     Jonathan Demme's direction is normally excellent, making it all
the more odd that he flubs some of the testimony so badly.  He is great
when he is directing Hanks--I remember especially the street scene
after Hanks's first meeting with Washington, and the soaring fantastic
opera scene.  Demme seems to have a gift for drawing out these kind of
individual performances (remember Byrne's dance at the beginning of
"Stop Making Sense"?) (By the way, the music in this film is excellent,
and really enhances the story line.)</P>
<P>     But in the courtroom, the direction, or possibly the editing, is
badly flubbed.  You don't have experienced lawyers, who are trying to
prove they are not bigots, just get up on the stand and start referring
to the Old Testament's views on homosexuality--at least, not without a
lot of goading.  The writing is weak here, too; it's as if the writer
wasn't interested in dramatizing what should be one of the two major
points of the film.</P>
<P>     There are a few other odd scenes as well.  Hanks's relationship
with his family is oddly uncomplicated.  It is as if Demme wasn't
intersted in these scenes, and wanted to get past them with as little
diversion from the main story line, but then, why put them in at all?
They aren't strictly necessary to the story line.</P>
<P>     Washington's homophobia is not convincing.  I'm fairly sure he
could have portrayed a convincing homophobe, after seeing his great
dramatic skill, so the problem must once again have been a lack of
clear direction.</P>
<P>     It is always nice to see Mary Steenburgen.  Here she seems
conflicted about her role, which is appropriate given the subject
matter.  I thought she was just about the best thing about the
courtroom scenes, after Hanks's brooding stillness.</P>
