<PRE>MIGHTY PEKING MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>So what does it take to make a movie so bad that it's good?  How far
over the top does a picture have to go to become hilariously horrible?
What does a B movie have to do to make sure that audiences realize that
the filmmaker is winking at them from behind the camera?</P>
<P>Meng-Hwa Ho's unabashedly hokey MIGHTY PEKING MAN knows all of these
answers.  The 1977 film is about to be re-released by Quentin
Tarantino's ROLLING THUNDER PICTURES in "hopes of jump-starting the
recently dormant but still vital Midnight Movie tradition."  Not only is
it a perfect midnight movie, it's also one of the few foreign films that
work well dubbed.  Dubbing usually makes actors look silly, but here it
just makes already outlandish performances seem even more so.</P>
<P>The story, a Chinese parody of KING KONG, has a not-so-fearless group of
explorers going into the jungle to find the ape that is rumored to be
"over 10 feet tall."  At various times, he appears to be anywhere from
30 to 300 feet tall.  Among the picture's delights are its crude special
effects.  The man in the ape suit gets to crush small villages that are
made of such simple materials that you can create the same effects in
the comfort of your own home.</P>
<P>The joys of the movie, however, come more from the actors than the
gorilla.  Johnny Feng (Danny Lee) leads the expedition.  He's distraught
because his girl is sleeping her way to the top by dating his successful
brother, a television director.</P>
<P>The safari travels in covered wagons pulled by water buffalo.  One of
their first encounters with danger is a herd of marauding elephants who
crush an entire native village -- buildings, livestock and humans.  Does
this make any sense and does it have anything to do with the story?  No
and no, but it's stupidly funny.</P>
<P>Even better is the tiger attack.  One of the frightened men jumps
straight into quicksand and disappears with only his hat left on top.  A
less fortunate one has his leg bitten off by the tiger after an
unsuccessful wrestling match.  Johnny goes for medicine, but the person
bankrolling the mission shoots the wounded worker first.  No sense
wasting valuable medicine, he reasons.</P>
<P>The funniest character is played by Baywatch babe lookalike Evelyne
Kraft as Samantha, the ape's companion.  Dressed in cheesy, skimpy
animal skins, she looks terrific.  Her bikini outfit has only one
shoulder strap, which makes her running scenes sensually humorous since
her top is unable to fully serve its intended purpose.  She speaks
little intelligible language since she and her parents crashed there
when she was a little girl.  Taking Johnny to the wreckage, she says
"mama" and "papa" as she points to the two skulls in the cockpit.</P>
<P>The jungle turns out not to be as harsh an environment as one might
suspect.  One look at Samantha, and you realize that there must be a
nearby makeup counter and a hair salon.</P>
<P>And did I mention the python that bites Samantha's thigh just south of
her private parts?  Well, Johnny gets to come to the rescue and happily
treat her wound in the traditional manner.  But it is the ape's
ingenuity that saves her.  Turns out that the Mighty Peking Man knows
herbal medicine.</P>
<P>The ending scene which is, of course, set on the top of a tall building
has the military pounding away mercilessly at our lovable beast.  This
long sequence is choreographed to the dramatic ending of Shostakovich's
fifth symphony, a piece of classical music as over-the-top as the story
itself.  As the French horns blare, the cymbals crash and the violins
make loud discordant sounds, the ape fights his last battle.  You should
count yourself lucky if your life ends with such a climactic flourish.</P>
<P>MIGHTY PEKING MAN runs a bit long, even at just 1:30.  It was rated
PG when released in 1977 before the introduction of the PG-13 rating,
which it would undoubtedly get today.  The film contains sexuality,
brief nudity and comic violence and would be fine for kids 11 or 12 and
up.</P>
