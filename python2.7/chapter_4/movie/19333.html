<P>A Thumbs For Sale! Review: <A HREF="http://www.thumbsforsale.com">http://www.thumbsforsale.com</A></P>
<P>Oh, to be the nice guy...and actually win for a change. That, if you'll
allow me to get slightly philosophical for a moment, seems to be one of
the key themes behind "American Pie", that perverse Home Economics
lesson now playing down at your multiplex. Or, if you're a Hollywood
exec, or one who likes to sit at home and play Hollywood exec (I like to
think I play one on TV, for example), the theme might appear to be
"everything old is new again." Or, "what comes around goes around." You
see, "Pie" is like a late nineties remake of "Porky's", with the
requisite twists. With all the doubling up of condoms, they could have
called this one "Pigs in a Blanket."</P>
<PRE>And no, I wouldn't have complained.</PRE>
<P>But let's get back to deconstructing the Pie, which appears the media is
trying to turn into a spectator sport for the duration of the summer.
Don't let them. Not only is there little to deconstruct here, the flick
is enough of a spectator sport in and of itself to warrant little
popcorn-laced pontificating after the fact.</P>
<P>The high concept on display here is watching four perfectly average and
perfectly nice guys wallow in an increasing surreal world of
masturbatory mishaps. Mostly, these happen to the generally innocuous
Jim (Biggs), which serves to bring him all that much closer to his
clique of friends who spontaneously decide after one particularly frigid
beer-soaked evening, that they must band together and form a little
blood cult if any of them ever hopes to get some action before D-Day--I
mean, Senior Prom.</P>
<P>But in typically late-90s fashion, rather than sign a pact (in blood, of
course!) with an unholy spawn of Satan, they agree to form what amounts
to a little support group. Yup, when the going gets rough, or fails to
get going altogether, they'll chime in with a little well-deserved
support for the poor libidinous sod left to his own devices after
another failed attempt at gaining maturity.</P>
<P>Of course, in high movie fashion, the flick ends the morning after the
Prom and the impossibly Hollywood-esque party that follows. And amongst
our little group of friends, there are the typical smiles of
accomplishment, little moral lessons floating about in their heads, and
a wave of nostalgia so instant, it makes VH-1 look as fresh as PBS in
between pledge drives.</P>
<P>True, unless you're a hopeless prude, or vying for an internship at "The
700 Club", you'll laugh and laugh until the fateful moment your Coke
makes a safe passage through your sinuses. But we're talking about
extremely cheap thrills here. Unlike, for instance, "There's Something
About Mary", the best stuff wasn't left out of the trailer.</P>
<P>For the most part, the guys mulls about like a bunch of mostly
well-behaved B-average students on their way to Big-10 universities in
the fall. Which, I might add, the flick points out on occasion after
occasion. They're extremely likeable, but not charismatic to say the
least. Even Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), the resident geek and sophisticate
of the gang, isn't so weird that he won't be able to pick up quality
dates down at the library once he makes it to U-State or wherever his
student loans take him.</P>
<P>The girls, on the other hand, are the fascinating folks in this story.
Unfortunately, unlike other aspects of their character, their roles are
a tad underdeveloped. Natasha Lyonne, who ruled the indie world for a
few weeks last year in "The Slums of Beverly Hills", begs for a spin-off
starring her worldly-wise Jessica. I think she gets all of eight or nine
minutes of screen time here. And Alyson Hannigan will probably spend a
few months in the limelight for her captivating "Band Camp" schtick.
Both will then move onto bigger and better projects.</P>
<P>As will this critic. Make it a matinee, if you must.</P>
