<PRE>                         GOOD WILL HUNTING 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               3 :-) :-) :-)  for being very well written</PRE>
<P>Cast: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie
Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser
Director: Gus Van Sant
Producer: Lawrence Bender
Screenplay: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck</P>
<P>Although this movie is not the over the top, sensational, earth
shattering experience that I had expected it to be; it is so well
written and acted that one cannot criticise it for its otherwise minute
flaws.</P>
<P>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the man that all mediocre folk carrying
mundane jobs in order to maintain their otherwise ordinary lives wish to
be. He has the gift of superior intelligence (a modern day Einstein) but
works at a construction site, has multiple problems with the law and
does not have aspirations to be greater. Now that's gratitude for you!
Discovered by a Professor of Mathematics (Stellan Skarsgard), just
before being imprisoned for aggravated assault, Will Hunting must attend
several psychological counselling sessions a week with a community
psychologist (Robin Williams).</P>
<P>>From this basic story line the audience is lead through a journey of
events that must occur to improve Will Hunting's disposition. If the
movie had ended on a bad note, like that of a genius throwing his life
away, it would not be getting the good press it's receiving today. So
the focus rests on Will Hunting, not just his intelligence, but rather
the emotional turmoil of this extraordinary young man. In the same vein
as FORREST GUMP, WILL HUNTING carries the message that intelligence does
not make the better person. Great care is taken in discussing the issues
dealing with physical abuse, broken homes and self blame. Before finally
bringing about the predictable cathartic moment when self defence
mechanisms collapse like the Walls of Jericho. Include in this journey
an understanding, sympathetic girlfriend (Minnie Driver) who he
initially tries to push away. Then add timely confronting questions from
a genuinely interested therapist, who reinforces the technique with
fatherly affirmation and you have discovered the method used to rescue
Will Hunting from himself.</P>
<P>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the new kids on the block and this movie
is a major cornerstone in their budding careers. Be prepared to expect
much more from them in the future. Robin William's well controlled
interpretation of a psychological therapist is rightly up for Oscar
contention; as is Minnie Driver who is unlikely to win in her category.
Gus Van Sant will be overlooked in favour of the Cameron team, as shall
all other major contenders for Best Picture. Be overwhelmed by the
Titanic certainty on Oscar night. This movie will however receive best
original screenplay if that is any consolation.</P>
