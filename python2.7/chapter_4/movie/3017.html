<P>     The events surrounding the kidnapping and murder of Quebec's labor
minister Pierre Laporte in 1970 by the Front de Liberation du Quebec
(FLQ) is a matter of national history for Canadian citizens.  However,
for those outside the country, details surrounding this incident may be
little-known, or not known at all.</P>
<P>     The FLQ was a terrorist organization operational in Canada during
the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Participants favored the separation of
Quebec from the rest of the country, and were willing to use violence
to press their claim.  The group's most infamous action occurred during
October of 1970 when four FLQ members from the Chenier cell kidnapped
Minister Pierre Laporte.  Eight days later, after the government
refused to meet a list of seven demands, Laporte was killed.  OCTOBER
details the events during that long week from the perspective of the
abductors.</P>
<P>     As is inevitable for any sympathetic portrayal of terrorists,
OCTOBER has stirred the cauldron of controversy.  In Canada, the movie
has been called everything from an amazing portrait of the loss of
innocence to blatant FLQ propaganda.  In reality, it's some of both.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Pierre Falardeau is a separatist sympathizer, and
this film is based on the account of one of the four kidnappers, with
whom Falardeau is friendly.  At times, the film maker's political
agenda interferes with his story, especially during the first half,
when the characters are wont to spout FLQ slogans (which sound exactly
like the kinds of things all terrorist organizations say).  While it's
necessary for the audience to understand why the characters act as they
do, Falardeau apparently wants to force a sympathy not only with them,
but with their movement as well.</P>
<P>     Where this movie really shines is in the interaction between the
four terrorists (played by Hugo Dube, Luc Picard, Pierre Rivard, and
Denis Trudel) and their victim (Serge Houde).  The relationship that
develops is complex and multi-layered as the basic humanity of all
involved is uncovered.  Falardeau eschews simplistic terms like "good,"
"evil," "right," and "wrong."  Laporte is not the "scumbag" he was
believed to be, and the FLQ don't really want to kill him.  In their
own words, they are militants, not killers.</P>
<P>     The no-win situation that arises when the government refuses to
honor the FLQ's demands fuels the ultimate conflict of conscience that
comprises the final act.  Killing Laporte, in addition to being morally
reprehensible, would hurt the FLQ's image.  Freeing him, however, would
give the organization a reputation for backing down--and to back down
is to be defeated.  In war, the undermanned side cannot afford
defeats.</P>
<P>     Motion pictures depicting the terrorist's point-of-view are not
especially popular, for obvious reasons.  Like Neil Jordan with THE
CRYING GAME, Pierre Falardeau faces a momentous challenge in getting
his audience to identify with individuals who bear such a negative
label.  While the director may have played somewhat loose with the
facts (as Jim Sheridan did in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER), it's
difficult to deny the dramatic impact of his finished product.  Only
those blinded by personal involvement in the issue are likely to deny
the effectiveness and skill with which OCTOBER's tragedy is
illustrated.</P>
