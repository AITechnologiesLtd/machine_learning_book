<PRE>                          A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     Director Bruce Beresford's earnest straightforwardness served well
enough in dramas like DRIVING MISS DAISY or even MR. JOHNSON but
rapidly sinks this attempt at an Evelyn Waugh/Kingsley Amis comedy of
manners.  To be fair, it's not likely anyone else could have done better
with William Boyd's script (from his novel of the same name), which
rounds up the usual British comedy suspects, and runs them through
numbingly familiar colonial games of sex and social climbing.</P>
<P>     Set in a fictional West African country, the story offers Colin
Friels as a Lucky Jim-like British foreign service climber named Morgan
Leafy, stuck under the thumb of supertwit High Commissioner Fanshawe
(John Lithgow honking an pseud-Sloane accent).  Leafy has to balance
the logistics of an impending visit from a member of the royal family
and sub-rosa bribery of local politicians with the demands of his
African girlfriend Hazel (Jackie Mofokeng) and sexual targets of
opportunity including Fanshawe's wife (Diana Rigg) and daughter
(Sarah-Jane Fenton), and the wife (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) of a local
nationalist leader (Louis Gossett Jr.).</P>
<P>     The Africa outside the embassy walls is presented solely as a
source of exotic plot complications to put Leafy into a comic
lather--sketchy, anachronistic, visually lackluster, and, with locals
rolling their eyes fearfully at the name of the thunder god Shango,
borderline racist stereotype.  It's no better inside the embassy, with
Dame Rigg given a line like "I want our loins to mingle."  Friels is
good, in his Michael-J.-Fox frantic way and Sean Connery is perfect as
the "good man" of the title, an incorruptible doctor with a gift for
wry understatement, but neither rescue the proceedings from the level of
not very inspired silliness.</P>
