<PRE>                               INDIAN RUNNER
                       A film review by Jeff Inman
                        Copyright 1991 Jeff Inman</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Sean Penn
Starring: David Morse, Viggo Mortensen, Valeria Golino, Patricia Arquette,
          Jordan Rhodes, Charles Bronson, Dennis Hopper.</P>
<P>     An Indian runner was more than a courier.  He *became* the message
he was carrying.  What danger is a bear, to a message?</P>
<P>     I used to think Sean Penn was an immature, arrogant, photographer-
punching, Madonna-marrying, loudmouth.  But all that has changed now.
The guy has grown up.  And that's not all.  It seems that Sean Penn has
talents both as a writer and a director, if this film is any indication.</P>
<P>     One might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy
machismo, given Penn in charge of Bronson and and Hopper.  But, no.
This film is about a real struggle, and the victories and defeats are
not simple.  Penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives
of the characters, without unnecessary rush or flash.  The focus of the
story is two brothers.  David Morse is the brother who has grown up in
the small midwestern town in which they were raised, tending a failing
farm and finally becoming a police officer.  Viggo Mortensen is the wild
brother, whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain
that he can't name, much less resolve.</P>
<P>     The film picks the story up on the day when Mortensen returns from
Vietnam, and Morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for
the state line.  It becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens
the link that the brothers once shared.  The film is unobtrusive,
simple, direct, plain, and sincere.  It isn't exactly perfect, but its
sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to
identify the sickness before it destroys them.  Life seems to move
forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems.</P>
<P>     This is a good film without big budget sets, or big name stars
pushed into your face.  In fact, I'm reviewing it because I suspect that
it may not get much marketing.  There were perhaps 10 others at the
showing I saw.  I thought the structure was clean and not
oversimplified, though there are a few free-form sections which also
work very well.  The obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche, but
what are you going to do--this movie *does* take place in the 1960s
after all.  In my opinion, it is worth full-price admission.</P>
<PRE>Violence:      Yes.  Some.  Not gratuitous.
Sex:           Um, not emphasized.
Playing Time:  I don't know.  Bring your watch.</PRE>
<PRE>My Rating:  8/10</PRE>
<PRE>.
