<P>   While "Dancer in the Dark" does a satiric take on American
musicals, whatever parody informs "Chunhyang" lies in its
criticism of social-class rigidities and not in its use of music. 
"Chunhyang" could be called a musical but is unlike any such
genre known in the U.S.  Utilizing a legend of a woman who
is swept away by a nobleman in 18th Century Korea, director
Im Kwon Taek introduces a Western audience to a theatrical
form known to educated Koreans today in much the way that
Kabuki and Noh drama are perceived by cognoscenti in
Japan.  The result is a mixed bag.  "Chunhyang" displays
exquisite cinematography in a lavish, high-budget costume
drama using 8,000 extras that curled its way around the
festival circuits in Cannes, Telluride, Toronto and New York. 
The simple story is effectively told but is interspersed with
musical numbers not only unfamiliar and strange to most of
its targeted audience of cultivated viewers but to my Western
ears downright irritating, unnecessary and shrill. 
"Chunhyang" features a vocalist who, together with a
drummer, belts out the story in a piercing cacophony that
makes no distinction between elements of high melodrama
and components of ordinary, mundane affairs.  The tale is
recited by a Pansori who chants at various times during its
exposition like a Brechtian narrator foreshadowing and
commenting upon what is developing.  Lose this Pansori and
you're left with a lovely fable that could easily go over with a
broader audience but would, of course, deny the producers
their claim to originality and their apparent wish to enlighten
most of us about this unique feature of Korean culture.</P>
<P>   A Romeo-and-Juliet-style fable with a happy ending, Kim
Myoung Kon's screenplay, exquisitely photographed by Jung
Il Sung, focuses on a handsome scholar, Mongryong (Cho
Seung Woo), who is the son of the provincial governor and is
reading furiously in preparation for a state examination. 
Using his Sancho-Panza-esque servant, Pangja (Kim Hak
Yong) as a travel agent, he winds his way about the
countryside, looking in on villages to further his education
about his country, but forgets much of the landscape when he
discovers the topography of a courtesan's beautiful daughter,
Chunhyang (Lee Hyo Jung).  Arrogant at first in demanding
that Chunhyang come to him for a meeting, he gives in to
this independent lass by meeting her more than halfway,
charming her into secretly marrying him, and then sadly
leaving her when ordered to do by his father--who has just
been appointed to the king's cabinet.  The replacement
governor (Choi Jin Young) gives new meaning to the term
"male chauvinist pig," demanding sexual favors from this
married woman and ordering his chief penal officer to beat
her severely when she resists.  He has her thrown into prison
and orders her execution.  "I cannot serve two husbands any
more than I can serve two kings," she repeatedly cries as she
desperately hopes for her man's return.</P>
<P>   "Chunhyang," Korea's most lavish film ever, looks terrific. 
Costumes, art direction, and shots of the landscape are
magnificent.  Im Kwon Taek's direction is on target not only in
the portrayal of 18th Century Korea with its courtesans,
bureaucrats, and governors with unlimited power, but in his
vignettes of the lovers as they coyly take part in marriage-
night antics, later to become madly in love with each other as
they playfully roll in the hay.  As we witness the title figure's
growing passion for her husband, we easily believe her fierce
loyalty to the handsome, if somewhat bland noble, and we
accept Mongryong's willingness to overlook class differences
as irrelevant.  Credibility suffers only at one point:  Having
been beaten, left incarcerated for months or years, and about
to be executed, Chunhyang looks as beautiful as she was on
the day that her prince charming met her.  Every hair is in
place, her face is appropriately made up, her clothing
immaculate.</P>
<P>   Did I mention that Im should lose the drummer and Pansori
(nothing personal)?</P>
