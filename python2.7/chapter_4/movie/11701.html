<P>Clinton...err, Stanton, flies his colors</P>
<PRE>Primary Colors
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>There's a popular maxim that the American public gets exactly the politicians
that it deserves. It's difficult to judge the truth of that because the masses
never really see these men and women, only their public faces. The demand that
they live the life of saints has created a situation where everyone in office
must lie in order to remain there.</P>
<P>The film from the novel by  (no longer) "Anonymous" (former "Newsweek" writer
Joe Klein) follows the presidential primary campaign of Jack Stanton (John
Travolta), a very thinly disguised Bill Clinton. Although the book is loosely
based on Clinton's 1992 campaign, it would be a mistake to take it as truth.
Some events are drawn from reality; others are completely fictional.</P>
<P>Told from the point of view of Henry (a darker George Stephanopoulos) Burton
(Adrian Lester), the story is one of difficult decisions. Burton is an
idealistic young black man drafted into the position of campaign manager for
the southern governor. At first he is excited about working for a man who
matches his vision. After a series of scandals, he has to re-think his
position and determine how much he is willing to bend to get his candidate elected.</P>
<P>Charismatic Stanton has a thing for the ladies. He's shown bedding down the
head of a teacher's union, accused of fathering the child of a teenage girl
and is the subject of a Gennifer Flowers lookalike's tabloid tale. Although
potentially a fatal flaw for a politician, his uncontrolled libido is not the
moral dilemma at the core of the film.</P>
<P>Is it justifiable for a politician to tell something different from the
truth? What is the high ground in terms of dealing with damaging personal dirt
about your opponent? These are the major issues at stake.</P>
<P>Stanton genuinely cares about the common man. In a scene reminiscent of
Edward Hopper's painting "Nighthawks", he sits in a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop
in the middle of the night listening to the lone employee explain how he has
to work impossibly long hours just to make ends meet. To demonstrate his
concern and get elected, the would-be president fabricates stories about his
past during speeches. They could have been true, they just aren't.</P>
<P>When campaign investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates), a stand-in for real
life Betsy Wright, comes up with information that would sink his opponent
there is the question about what to do with it. Stanton has refused to "go
negative" previously, but this material would guarantee his victory.</P>
<P>Is Stanton God or Satan? It turns out, like politicians in the real world,
he's neither. Admirably the film doesn't provide easy answers, but we do see
that idealism and politics are not good bedfellows...although other campaign
workers might be.</P>
<P>That politicians and their staff are human beings might come as a surprise to
many people. The media and the public tend to see them as symbols and forget
that there's flesh and blood there. If a friend has an extra-marital affair,
it's unfortunate, Maybe the couple can work things out and if not, well, it
happens every day. If the President of the United States does the same thing,
there's moral outrage. In "Primary Colors", the characters are people:
sometimes noble and certainly flawed.</P>
<P>Remembering my experiences as a minor staffer during a congressional race
years ago, the behind the scenes look feels realistic. Nothing is as organized
and unified as it appears from the outside. The intense feelings and abrupt
coming and going of staff members seem about right. It's not a shock when
co-workers end up in bed together.</P>
<P>Director Mike Nichols ("The Graduate", "The Birdcage") has a remarkable cast
here. Billy Bob Thornton who has burst on the cinema scene like a house afire
during the past year plays self-proclaimed redneck spin doctor Henry Burton
Jemmons (or maybe it's James Carville). Emma Thompson is Stanton's wife Hilary
-- err, Susan. Florida governor Fred Picker (possibly inspired by Jerry Brown)
is portrayed by Larry Hagman who has turned out to be quite the talent after
his mundane years on television.</P>
<P>Travolta is outstanding as the good ol' boy with an apple fritter in one
hand, a greasy chicken leg in the other and always talking the talk. Gnawing
on a rib held in his hands, you can tell that he's filled with a gusto for
being alive. That zest is what gets him into trouble, but it's also what gets
him elected. Travolta is one of those actors with such a presence that
sometimes he's "John Travolta" rather than the character. It's a testament to
his skills that just minutes after the film starts, you forget the actor and
see Jack Stanton.</P>
<P>The real standout is Bates. Her inspired off-the-wall (judged safe for the
campaign because, after all, she's been out of the mental institution for
months) pistol-toting lesbian has a fire in her belly for truth and justice.
She dominates every scene she's in. Her sexual persuasion is handled well in a
matter of fact manner. When Burton discovers the actual relationship with her
beautiful "assistant" (Stacy Edwards), it gets no more than a raised eyebrow.</P>
<P>Although you can look for Academy Awards acting nominations next spring,
there are odd moments. When the bigger than life Travolta, Thornton or Bates
is on-screen with some of the lesser-skilled others, the contrast is sometimes
jarring.  Lester's adequate performance appears flat when compared.</P>
<P>Clinton's popularity seemingly results from his persona as a real person.
This might mark a turning point in America's future. Politicians as human
beings? Who would have thunk it?</P>
<P>"Michael Redman's thoughtful analysis of the Oscars Presentation"
Only in Hollywood could they take such a lively art form and turn it into
such a boring non-event. It was the "Anti-Titanic".</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for 23 years and it might be that long
again before he watches another awards show.)</P>
