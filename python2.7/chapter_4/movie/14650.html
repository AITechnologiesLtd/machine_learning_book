<P>  "I'm a lazy person, I like others to arrange things for me. Like
who's to die, and where and when-is all planned by others. That's why
I need a partner". These are the words spoken by the character Ming,
in the 1995 Hong Kong film "Fallen Angels". This belief of his,
explains his current situation and represents his attitude towards
life. The film showcases the relationship between Ming and his
business partner, as well as the relationship between a man named He
Qiwu and his father, his work, and his short term girlfriend.
Successfully, the movie intertwines the two stories, making them fit
and connect in subtle and not so subtle ways.  By the end of the film
it leaves the viewer thinking, about the ways in which we experience
life, and the way in which we are suppose to experience life. At least
that's what the director, Wong Kar-wai intended when he made this
film, and in my opinion, he succeeds.
  The first story the movie presents is the story between Ming, who is
an assassin, and his partner. His partner does all the preparation and
planning, so that all Ming has to do is kill. No decision making is
his modo for work and for life. His statement about being lazy and
liking the identity, time, and place of a person's death to be all
planned by others, suggest that he feels the same way about life in
general. The planner, being God, has already made the decision making,
and all Ming has to do, is do the job, whatever that may be.
  The character Ming grows throughout the movie by conflicts that
derive from his relationship with his partner, who is a woman that
remains nameless throughout the entire film. They've been partners for
years and when she begins to fall in love with him he decides to
terminate their relationship, although her falling in love with him
didn't solely cause his decision. He finally made up his mind to end
the partnership when he got shot.
  As the story of Ming and his partner unfolds, the movie shifts to
another story. He Qiwu's story. At the age of five, He Qiwu ate an
expired can of pineapples and lost his ability to talk. This handicap
made it difficult for him to find or keep a job, so he decided to
become his own boss. By breaking into stores after hours and running
them. The customers who are unfortunate enough to come to the store
he's taken over, are forced to buy something. It was by doing this
that created He Qiwu's criminal record, and from the help of his
father whom he has a deep bond with, he manages to dodge the police
numerous of times.
  "We rub shoulders with people everyday, strangers who may even
become friends or confidants." These words represents one of the ways
He Qiwu feels towards people and life. And these words also represent
one of the attitudes or beliefs that the films itself portrays. When
He Qiwu's character is introduced, the connections between the two
stories begins to show. There is a specific scene in the film that
displays the way in which complete strangers can find a connection
between one another by just walking passed each other. One day Ming's
partner, who is intensely in love with him but fears to get too close,
unknowingly walks pass Ming's girlfriend, Blondie, but as she walks by
she stops, because she recognizes Ming's smell on Blondie. Blondie
also recognizes Ming's smell on Ming's partner. They both stop and
look at each other.
       The characters Ming and He Qiwu both reach a point in their
lives where they decide to change, due to some form of pain they
experienced.  Ming gets shot and decides to end his partnership and
stop having things arranged for him, and make a decision for himself
wether it be right or wrong. Ming changes, or evolves by deciding to
live differently by arranging things himself, and not relying on
others to do so for him. He Qiwu gets his heart broken and decides to
change his ways and be more responsible. He decides to stop breaking
into stores after hours and running them and gets a normal job. Ming
and He Qiwu both change, which is one of the things this movie is
about. It's about connections, changes, decision making, and life in
general. Wether one believes in the possession of free will or not,
life is meant to be enjoyed even if it has already been planned out
for you. Depending on your belief.
      Visually, the film has a life of it's own. It's evident that the
director, Wong Kar-Wai has a very distinct visual style. The look of
the film is captivating and pulls you into the imagery presented. It's
the cinematography and editing that is the highlight of the
film. Filled with a huge amount of energy, the film grabs you, screws
with your head, and slowly lets go while the credits roll. The
director's use of super 8mm, 35mm, oblique angles, slow and fast
motion would seem like overkill in most other directors hands. But
Wong manages to make it all make sense.
       There is very little dialogue in the entire movie, due to the
fact that the story is toldmostly with narration from the main
characters. The viewer is transported into the mind of the characters
for most of the movie, and it works. The editing is fast paced
andimmensely energetic, and it's this and the camerawork that give the
movie so much energyand drive. The film gets a little boost from the
acting as well, which is also powerful, butit's clearly the director,
cinematographer and editor, who make this movie so much of a thrill to
watch.
       Being a foreign film I thought that there would be certain
views and or beliefs portrayed in the film that might be
incomprehensible to some people not native to that country, but I felt
that many of the beliefs were universal. Beliefs about making a
change. Wether it's for the better or worse, doesn't really matter, as
long as one doesn't spend his/her entire life following the plans and
decisions made by others. And beliefs about the interactions with
others can lead to many different possibilities. He Qiwu's words of
strangers rubbing shoulders with each other, who may become friends or
confidants, is evidence of this belief portrayed within the movie.
  Ultimately this movie leaves it's audience with an experience that
will be remembered for quite sometime after initial viewing. Not many
films have such a distinct style and image, and it is fortunate that
Wong Kar-Wai allowed the world to see his vision realized. During the
final scene in the film, Ming's partner says to herself, "The road
home isn't very long, and I know I'll be getting off soon. But at this
moment I'm feeling such lovely warmth." Now at the moment she said
that, she was riding on the back of a motorcycle with a guy who was
giving her a ride home. But the words are very relative to life. By
"the road home", she could mean the length of life to death, and by
"the moment" she could mean the time that is cherished during
life. Overall, Fallen Angels is a visually stunning and thought
provoking film that I recommend to everyone, who is a fan of
intelligent and outstanding works of art.</P>
