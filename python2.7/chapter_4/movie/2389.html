<PRE>                             ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros
Directed by Tom Shadyac
Starring Jim Carrey
Supporting cast includes Tone Loc, Randall "Tex" Cobb, Dan Marino, and,
in yet another bad role, Sean Young!</PRE>

<PRE>"You really love animals, don't you?"
"Only if it gets cold enough."
                        - Sample wit of Ace Ventura, Pet Detective</PRE>
<P>     What are we going to do with Jim Carrey?  Viewers of television's
"In Living Color" know this one-man cartoon from such characters as
Fire Marshall Bill.  Viewers also know that "In Living Color" is a
skit-show and that a little of Jim Carrey goes a long way.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, this fact was forgotten by the makers of the Carrey
comedy ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.</P>
<P>     Three writers, including Carrey, worked on the slapstick story,
which sends a self-styled "Pet Detective" on the trail of a stolen
dolphin.  The missing mammal belongs to the Miami Dolphins, who need
their mascot for the upcoming Superbowl.</P>
<P>     For plot porpoises, this story works as well as any Three Stooges
short.  Carrey gets to do his "official" schtick as he snoops around
greater Miami.  He leers and sneers, craning his neck to funny effect.
He even does his Captain Kirk impersonation.  Again.</P>
<P>     All of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you
realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on
anyone *other* than Carrey.</P>
<P>     (Suggested alternate title--JIM CARREY: WILL DO ANYTHING FOR A
LAUGH.)</P>
<P>     Export it to France and you may have a hit.  As it stands, ACE
VENTURA isn't even good kid's stuff.  The profanity count, alone, is
too high.  Which is ironic, since children are, probably, Carrey's best
audience.</P>
<P>     The film doesn't even have the goofball charm of Chris Elliott's
recent no-brainer CABIN BOY.  Sure, Carrey has his moments.  But what
can you say about a film whose high-points include watching Carrey
slink around to the theme from "Mission Impossible?"</P>
<P>     ACE VENTURA has one glaring incongruity.  Amid the butt-jokes and
double-takes, the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and
rather funny "Crying Game" gag.  And, for *this* intended audience, that
takes (ahem) cojones.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE is an unfunny showcase for
                 the remarkable (and wasted) talents of comedian Jim
                 Carrey.  Don't bother.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
