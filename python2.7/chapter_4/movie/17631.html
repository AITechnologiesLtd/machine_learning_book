<PRE>LOLITA (R).  
(Beyond Films)
Director: Adrian Lyne
Stars: Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, Dominique Swain, Frank Langella, 
Ben Silverstone
Running time: 133 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Adrian Lyne's previous films (9 And 1/2 Weeks, Fatal
Attraction, etc) have dealt with the nature of sexual attraction and
obsession, and his adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial 1958
novel Lolita further explores these themes.  However, free of the
strict moral and censorship code that shaped Stanley Kubrick's 1962
version, Lyne is able to explore the novel in far more detail.  Where
Kubrick largely alluded to the nature of the relationship between
Humbert and his precocious 12 year old step daughter, Lyne is able to
explore it in franker terms.</P>
<P>However, Lyne's intelligent and sensitive handling of the
provocative material and his sense of restraint is unexpected.  Lolita
is nowhere near as sexually explicit or torrid as its detractors would
have us believe, but is rather a more poignant and evocative tale of a
tragically doomed and illicit love affair.  Many writers, including
James Drearden, Harold Pinter, and even David Mamet, have attempted to
write a more contemporary flavoured adaptation of Lolita, but Lyne
found the perfect collaborator in former Vanity Fair film critic
Stephen Schiff, whose lyrical and melancholy script seems to capture
much of the book's flavour.</P>
<P>The two central performances are powerful and complex and
enhance the movie.  Jeremy Irons brings his usual pained and haunted
expression to the character of Humbert Humbert, the refined English
professor who comes to New England to take up a teaching assignment in
1947.  Humbert is still marked by the loss of an adolescent love that
has haunted him for the past quarter of a century.  He is initially
reluctant to take up lodging with the man hungry widow Charlotte Haze
(Melanie Griffith), until he spies her beautiful young daughter
Dolores (newcomer Dominique Swain).</P>
<P>Despite her childish demeanour, Dolores arouses long forgotten
feelings in Humbert.  He eventually marries Charlotte, just so he can
be close to Dolores, and successfully manages to avoid most of his
husbandly duties.  For a long time Charlotte misreads the attraction
between Humbert and her daughter.  Following the death of Charlotte,
Humbert and Dolores set out on a journey across an America slowly
recovering from the war and emerging with a recognition of its own
identity and culture.</P>
<P>Irons brings sophistication and urbane charm to the role, and
makes Humbert something of a sympathetic figure.  He convincingly
conveys Humbert's ever increasing sense of guilt and remorse.  His
voice over narration provides insight into his obsession, and also
adds some touches of droll humour.  Lyne uses some neat cinematic
tricks to illustrate Humbert's disquieting inner nightmares as he
begins to lose control of the relationship.  Irons gives a confident
and convincing performance in this tricky role, whereas James Mason
always seemed uncomfortable.</P>
<P>In a remarkably assured debut performance, Swain (who went on
to play Nicolas Cage's daughter in the action thriller Face/Off) is a
wonderfully seductive and manipulative nymphet.  Swain beautifully
mixes childlike innocence with an earthy quality and a smouldering
sexuality that sears across the screen.</P>
<P>Frank Langella (from Dave, etc) is truly creepy as the
enigmatic and predatory Quilty.  In the early stages, he is mainly
seen in shadows and gloomy lighting, which gives him a sinister,
mysterious and somehow menacing quality.</P>
<P>Lyne's adaptation of Lolita finally reaches our screens,
following a year of protracted debate over whether it is pornography
or art, and whether it should be banned.  Not since Martin Scorsese's
The Last Temptation Of Christ has a film had so much free
pre-publicity, which certainly won't harm it at the box office.  Far
from glorifying paedophilia, as most of the film's detractors have
claimed, Lolita ends badly and tragically for all concerned.  In fact,
the most disturbing scene is the Taxi Driver-like violence at the end
when Humbert confronts the monstrously amoral Quilty in his own
mansion.</P>
<P>The film is visually rich, and has a beautiful, glossy, almost
romantic surface that seduces the audience, despite its dubious
subject matter.  Howard Atherton's exquisite cinematography brings to
life the rich American landscapes through which Humbert and Lolita
travel on their odyssey.  Ennio Morricone's lush score further
enriches the movie.</P>
