<PRE>RUSHMORE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Nerdy 15-year-old Max Fischer, played by a perfectly cast Jason
Schwartzman, might appear to have it all.  A student at an elite private
school named Rushmore; he participates in every extracurricular activity
on campus from backgammon to beekeeping to wrestling.  And he's
constantly on the prowl for opportunities to establish new clubs.  No
activity is too mundane for Max to organize.  As he sees it, even the
old recess game sometimes called dodgeball, in which kids throw a ball
at each other, deserves incorporation into a school-sponsored sport.</P>
<P>With his prominent braces, bookish glasses and exceedingly plain looks,
Max overcompensates by being the only boy at school to a wear a blazer
and tie.   In a fancy prep school, he's the preppiest kid on campus.</P>
<P>Max's talents appear limitless.  He even writes, directs and produces
his own plays, including a realistic Vietnam war drama that requires his
audience to wear earplugs and safety goggles in case the bazooka or
other parts of the dangerously real pyrotechnics go awry.</P>
<P>RUSHMORE, written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson and directed by Wes
Anderson, isn't a movie that's easy to pigeonhole.  The trailers would
lead you to believe that it's a comedy and probably a bad slapstick one.
The movie is certainly funny, and, unlike what the trailers suggest, it
isn't that over-the-top.  In addition to the humor, the story has two
quirky romances and some sweet undertones.  Most of all, it's a poignant
tale about two people who have had limited success in their lives.</P>
<P>Although Max excels at some things, academically and socially he's am
unqualified disaster.  As the story opens, he has been put on "academic
sudden death" because of his poor grades.  (Max demands documentation.
A kid's got to know his rights.)</P>
<P>In a supporting role that the studio hopes will garner him an Oscar
nomination, Bill Murray plays Herman Blume, the school's superrich
supporter.  Herman is bored stiff with his life and his family, and he
is cursed with a pair of obnoxious twins who attend Rushmore.  In an
empathetic performance, Murray takes an understated approach.  With just
the rolling of his eyes, he imparts a deliciously mocking humor,
revealing how bereft his character is of any joy in his life.  Herman
may be financially well off, but he is terminally unhappy.</P>
<P>Perhaps the film's best scene occurs when Herman tries to obtain a
little solitude during a party at his house by floating underwater in
the swimming pool.  A kid also dives under and stares at him, thus
destroying his fleeting moment of peace.  The incident is reminiscent of
THE GRADUATE, as is some of the rest of this unusual motion picture.</P>
<P>Both Max and Herman fall in love Rosemary Crosswith, a new teacher at
Rushmore.  Olivia Williams, the female lead from THE POSTMAN, plays
Rosemary with an inviting sweetness.  Rosemary tells Max that he's too
young for her, but that doesn't dissuade him.  Ever resourceful, he
finds out what he thinks are her passions and then lobbies to obtain
them for her.  From keeping Latin as part of the curriculum to building
an aquarium, no challenge is too daunting for him.</P>
<P>Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography gives the picture a bleak and austere
look that has a FARGOish feel to it.  The images are colorful, yet flat
and devoid of warmth, reflecting the desperation of the characters.</P>
<P>It's not often that two award pins can summarize a person's life, but
Max's pins can.  Prominently displayed on his sport coat are his awards
for "Perfect Attendance" and "Punctuality."  If, as Woody Allen said,
"90% of life is just showing up," Max does have some major
accomplishments to his credit.</P>
<P>RUSHMORE runs 1:33.  It is rated R for profanity and mature themes and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
