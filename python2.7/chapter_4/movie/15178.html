<P>Holy Man (1998) - Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum, Kelly Preston</P>
<P>   The poster for "Holy Man" shows a serene, Zen-like Eddie Murphy
   sitting atop a giant bar code. The movie is a lot like the poster -
   gentle, soft-spoken and nowhere near as funny as you might hope. But
   behind this simple packaging lies a subtle film that's not perfect,
   but still a better entertainment value than most.</P>
<P>   Jeff Goldblum stars as Ricky Hayman, an executive for a home-shopping
   network. His life isn't quite perfect - his tailored suits can't quite
   hold his work-induced ulcer, and his sportscar is about to be
   repossessed. The whole network is on the verge of going under, and
   media analyst Kate Newell (Kelly Preston) is brought in as their last
   resort.</P>
<P>   On their way to a meeting, Ricky and Kate run into G (Murphy), a
   wandering holy man on a spiritual pilgrimage. Literally. With the
   sportscar. In an uncharacteristic show of guilt, Ricky invites G to
   stay in his apartment while G waits for the doctor's OK to continue
   his quest.</P>
<P>   A few nonsensical contrivances later, G is an on-air personality,
   mixing Deepak Chopra-ish sound bites with hawking bizarre products
   like the "Hood Buddy" (it cooks while you drive) and "L'il Squirt" (it
   goes in the toilet; use your imagination). "Spirituality on a home
   shopping network?" execs cry, but sales are up - way up.</P>
<P>   Murphy is remarkably subdued in "Holy Man," and it's both appropriate
   and successful. His famous laugh is absent, as is his traditional
   scene-stealing. He's finally learned the valuable lesson that he
   doesn't have to constantly be the center of attention to turn in a
   memorable performance.</P>
<P>   Unfortunately, Goldblum and Preston seem to still think of him as
   "the" star. They turn in adequate, but not stellar, performances.
   Playing off his normal status as center of attention, they rarely
   allow their acting talents to shine. In addition, the producers'
   apparent need to put Preston in unnecessarily tight clothes merely
   because she is the female lead had to be distracting at some point.</P>
<P>   Their characters' romance seems forced, as they have remarkable little
   chemistry with each other. The presence of Murphy can cover a lot of
   flaws, though; everyone who interacts with G seems just a bit more
   relaxed. If only there were more of him in this film.</P>
<P>   Throughout "Holy Man" the humor is subtle and dry, and all too often
   whitewashed to near invisibility by the preachy anti-consumerism
   message. Even infomercial stars like Morgan Fairchild have trouble
   selling this movie, but you shouldn't have much trouble renting it.</P>
