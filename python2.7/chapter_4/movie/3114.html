<P>     The wonderful thing about dreams, like hope, is that everyone can
nurture their own, and there's no cost.  It's taking the next
step--transforming those wispy ideals and half-realized wishes into
reality--that demands a price, and sometimes a high one at that.
HOOP DREAMS, the tale of two high school basketball players, is less a
story about the sport than it is a chronicle of life in the inner city
and of following Aldous Huxley's advice that "a man's reach should
exceed his grasp."</P>
<P>     Traditionally, documentarians know the endings of their films
before they start shooting.  This is not always the case, however; HOOP
DREAMS is an excellent counterexample.  Like other features filmed as
the events take place (such as Michael Apted's excellent SEVEN UP
series and 1992's BROTHER'S KEEPER), this picture has a legitimate
dramatic structure that is equally as compelling as a scripted slice of
fiction.</P>
<P>     HOOP DREAMS follows two Chicago youths, William Gates and Arthur
Agee, from their Freshman year of high school to their first year of
college.  In addition to documenting the inevitable on-court maturation
process, the movie illustrates the difficulties of balancing sports
with scholastic and family pressures.  Neither William nor Arthur are
advanced academically, and both suffer through a variety of
away-from-school crises.</P>
<P>     At the start of HOOP DREAMS, when William and Arthur are 14, each
appears to be a solid prospect for recruiting by "white" suburban
basketball powerhouse St. Joseph High School and its legendary coach,
Gene Pingatore.  Arthur has the quickest step one talent scout has seen
in five years, and William looks like the "next Isiah Thomas."  One
point explored by this film is that no matter how "can't miss" a
prospect is, and regardless of their level of talent and enthusiasm,
most of them, in fact, fail.  Being the star of a high school team does
not guarantee a trip to the NBA, and realizing this represents a rude
awakening for William and Arthur.</P>
<P>     While William quickly becomes Coach Pingatore's "go-to guy" on the
varsity squad, Arthur's slow development as a player allows him to be
dropped from the Freshman team.  When his parents can no longer afford
St. Joseph's tuition, Arthur is cut loose and sent back to public
school.  His home life is further disrupted by financial struggles and
the departure of his father.  William, on the other hand, suffers a
series of knee injuries that erode his confidence, and the unexpected
arrival of a baby daughter throws his personal life into further
turmoil.  (Oddly, the film makers don't inform us that William has a
girlfriend until Alicia is born.)</P>
<P>     The rich texture of HOOP DREAMS' drama is its greatest asset.
This is a film that goes beyond the verisimilitude of something to come
from the pen of Spike Lee or John Singleton, into the realm of real
life.  The shattered illusions of William and Arthur are all the more
poignant because these are not the dividends of a screenwriter's
fertile imagination.  And the drug deals depicted are chilling for
exactly the same reason.</P>
<P>     HOOP DREAMS is not without flaws, some of which--like the
irregular transitions and erratic pacing--are understandable results
of the manner in which the film was put together.  Film makers Steve
James, Frederick Marx, and Peter Gilbert amassed 250 hours of
interviews, clips, and game footage, then edited it all down to
one-hundred seventy-one minutes.  Arguably, more could have been cut
without undermining the story or its themes.  There are times when HOOP
DREAMS threatens to drag.</P>
<P>     Most movies about sports lack anything but the most rudimentary
tension.  After all, in pictures like HOOSIERS and THE NATURAL, we know
which team is going to win--regardless of how unlikely the manner of
the victory is.  Not so for HOOP DREAMS, which presents a number of
condensed real games where the outcome is as much in question as in any
genuine sporting event.  Even viewers without an appreciation of
basketball will find that they have a rooting interest.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, however, HOOP DREAMS is about life and its challenges,
both on and off the basketball court, and that's the reason you don't
have to be a sports fan for this film to work.  If any single line sums
up the lessons learned by the two protagonists, it comes late in the
movie, and is spoken by William in his Marquette University dorm room:
"People always say to me, 'When you get to the NBA, don't forget me.'
Well, if I don't get to the NBA, you don't forget about me."</P>
