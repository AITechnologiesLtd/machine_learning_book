<P>Even if you don't like Bruce Willis as a person, or think that he sucks as
an actor, you gotta give the guy credit for this much: he sure does like to
diversify his roles! In the past two years alone, he's played an action hero
saving the world in ARMAGEDDON, a general in THE SIEGE, a quirky car
salesman in the very trippy BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, second fiddle to a kid
who saw dead people in THE SIXTH SENSE, an aging husband in THE STORY OF US
and a comedic hitman in THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. So what's missing on his list?
Well, howsabout a good ol' fashioned sugary sweet children's Disney movie?
Check! Phew...okay, now let's dust John McLane out of the woodworks and get
ready to die some more!</P>
<P>PLOT:
An aging image consultant with a huge chip on his shoulder, a frigid
attitude, and little love in his life suddenly finds himself confronted with
his 8-year old self. Why his younger counterpart has all of a sudden become
a part of his present reality is unknown to the man, but he is certainly
going to do his best to find out.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A kid's movie presented by Disney, this film makes no bones about itself.
It's a simple tale offering a predictable but important life lesson, a
handful of laughs via the latest cute kid in town Spencer Breslin, a
happy-go-lucky booming score, but certainly nothing more than an above
average Disney Sunday Night Movie of the Week starring Bruce Willis in a bad
hairpiece. In fact, if it wasn't for the adorable performance put forth by
the kid in this film, or the final act's resolution of said fantastical
situation, I wouldn't have recommended this film at all. But something about
the film's conclusion "got me" (read: I wept openly within myself... :), and
despite it being an obvious pull at the ol' heart strings via the most
powerful corporate company in the world of entertainment (M-I-C-K-E-Y
etc...), I still appreciated the sentiment and credited the film for that
much. I also happened to see this film with a few kids in tow (not my own),
and they all seemed to truly enjoy it. They cracked up at the kid on the
screen, made fun of Bruce and hopefully picked up a bit of the message
contained within (and a free toy plane given away to all kid attendees), so
target audience-wise, the course is certainly set to be flown.</P>
<P>Bruce was okay in the film, but he honestly didn't have much to do. He just
stood around as the straight man and acted nasty to just about everyone. The
romance angle of the film also didn't work for me, with a lot of it feeling
manufactured, a convenient device for the entire setup. In the end, this
film certainly isn't going to break any new ground (see BIG to know what I'm
talking about) or knock anybody over their ass in appreciation of its
entertainment value, but as a parent, you certainly can't go too wrong with
this film. In fact, it is more than likely that many adults will also see a
bit of themselves in the Willis character and hopefully take a little
something away from the film themselves. So if you've already seen CHICKEN
RUN, and need a safe, cute, sentimental fluff piece to present to the kids,
this film might just be the one for you.</P>
