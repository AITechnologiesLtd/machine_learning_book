<PRE>Review of Home Fries (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 11 December 1998 by myself at the UA 64th Street for $4.50</P>
<P>Somewhere in Hollywood it was decided that mix-and-match genre screenplays
area good idea. Action-adventure? Comedy? Psychodrama? Taut mystery?
Screwball romance? Honestly, just pick two and leave it alone. But that is
not what director Dean Parisot and writer Vince Gilligan decide to do. The
only mistake avoided was casting Valerie Bertinelli, always good for an
unintentional laugh.</P>
<P>The oddly named and aimless *Home Fries* suffers a series of coincidences
and motivations that baffles the moviegoing imagination. What is intended
to draw in the audience and sustain our interest is merely annoying. I
must admit, I was curious to see where it was going, and in reviewing it,
I must warn you that I will give it all away.</P>
<P>Sally (Drew Barrymore) gives her married lover Henry the heave-ho, even
though she is pregnant. Cut to Henry run off the road by a mysterious
black helicopter, and then scared to death when they fire a series of
shells at him. Scared to death (heart condition), but untouched by the
weapons. Then we discover that the two men flying the copter, Dorian and
Angus (Luke Wilson and Jake Busey, both of whom have mostly made
forgettable films) are the stepsons of the dead man. So it was not just a
"prank gone wrong." Then there's the matter of the people who might have
heard them over their radio communications. It seems that Sally heard them
talking (but didn't know what they were saying) on her fast-food radio
headset. She works at the local franchise of a burger chain. So naturally,
Angus insists that Dorian get a job there and figure out if they need to
*kill* her to protect their butts and Mom's (played by Catherine O'Hara
whose comedic talents go completely untapped in favor of sheer frenzy).</P>
<P>But then Dorian falls in love with the very pregnant Sally. But the
increasingly murderous Angus wants to kill someone. What a pickle (no bun
intended) for Dorian. How does he keep Sally from getting killed without
telling her that he killed the father of her unborn baby, who happened to
be his stepfather?</P>
<P>*Home Fries* goes on *further* to dabble in the possibility of a
class-struggle story, with the rich Dorian romancing the utterly poor
Sally. It's all too stupid.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, thoughout, there is some absolutely splendid filming (kudos to
Jerzy Zielinski), and a dynamite soundtrack. If they had just decided to
film the Texas scenery with the Chris Isaak music, I would have loved
that. It was just the plot and the dialogue that got in the way.</P>
<P>PS: That's Shelley Duvall as Sally's mother. She may not be dead, but her
career obviously is.</P>
