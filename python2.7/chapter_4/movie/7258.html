<PRE>                STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (SPECIAL EDITION)
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Oddly enough, I had forgotten much about this middle film of the <I>Star
Wars<I> trilogy so seeing it on the big screen again was an unexpected
treat. The darkest and arguably the best of the films suffered from the
second-act syndrome when you had to wait three years for the next movie.
It works much better as a part of the whole.</P>
<P>Everything goes wrong in this one. The rebels are on the run. Han Solo
is captured by the bad guys. Luke fails to complete his Jedi training,
loses a hand and gains a father (You already knew that, right? I'm not
ruining anything for you, right?) =97 none of which are good things. The
ending is just the opposite of the triumph of "Star Wars". The Dark Side
may just come out on top.</P>
<P>There aren't as many changes from the original as the Special Edition of
the first film featured. A few fixes here and there, short new scenes
and a punched-up soundtrack are fairly unobtrusive and make it easier to
watch the film rather than be pulled into the "What's New" game.</P>
<P>Now I'm looking forward to "Return Of The Jedi" even with those
terminally cute fuzzy things.</P>
