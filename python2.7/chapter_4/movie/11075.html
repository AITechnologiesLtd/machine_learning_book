<P>Review: The Tango Lesson (star) (star) (star)</P>
<P>Sally Potter (herself) and Pablo Veron (himself)</P>
<PRE>By Jonathan Williams</PRE>
<P>Near the beginning of The Tango Lesson, Sally Potter asks tango master
Pablo Veron why he chose to dance the tango: ³I didn¹t choose the tango;
the tango chose me.² Of course it did, Pablo. During that split-second
pause after his first sentence I knew what his second phrase would be,
about being chosen, and I knew that this film would not surprise me, but
it would be pleasing. The Tango Lesson is a delightful film, but mostly
because it is filled with beauty, beautiful dances, beautiful moments, and
beautiful people, especially Pablo and his first partner (unfortunately
NOT Sally). But a profound revelation The Tango Lesson is not. Some of the
moments, like the one above, contained predictable dialogue, and I found
myself marvelling at things I don¹t think I was supposed to marvel at.
Like what a magnificent dancer Sally Potter is, she does all her own
dancing, and how everyone who lives in Paris seems to be able to speak at
least three languages. I left the movie, less enthralled by the
romantic/man/woman story than by the magical lifestyle that Parisians,
especially independent movie makers, seem to lead. I kept wondering if
someone like Pablo Veron really can make a living putting on stage shows
where the entire show is a series of couples soloing a tango number
onstage. Only in Paris, I thought. Remember, for those of you who are
provincial American suburbanites like myself, France is a country where
they rate intellectuals like Americans rate college football teams. They
really are different than us. </P>
<P>I think I was supposed to be captivated by the intrigue of the story--film
director meets and learns from tango dancer who later must follow her
direction in making a film--but I wasn¹t. I think I was supposed to be
captivated by the love story that wasn¹t a love story, but I wasn¹t. I
wasn¹t bored, but, as I said before, I kept being awed at some of the
wrong things. I was awed, and rightfully so, by the dancing. Pablo Veron
shines, and Ms. Potter is not far behind for someone whose profession is
film directing. And even though I still don¹t want to learn the tango, I
marvelled at how beautiful dance is. There is a sort of religious, not
capital ³R² religious, but cultural religious undertone to the film. Both
of the main characters are Jewish and it becomes a connecting point for
them. Again, I ended up marvelling less at their connection and more at
the cultural stereotype my mind kept trying to draw about Jews truly being
the chosen people. Everything the main characters did in the movie, aside
from a few awkward moments where Pablo remembered he was acting in a film,
seemed effortless, seamless, flawless, like a smooth tango. </P>
<P>To be blunt, one of the reasons the film¹s emotional story line didn¹t
hook me is because the story seemed contrived, less a reflection of what
happened between Sally and Pablo in real life and more a reflection of
what she wishes had happened (or didn¹t happen). As a couple they danced
well together, but they lacked chemistry. Sally Potter just looked so much
older than he, and, I¹m afraid, so much plainer. Her thin, drawn, elfin
face just didn¹t make me think tango, even though I knew she was supposed
to be a film director first. Call me conventional, but I have to see some
obvious physical beauty and energy in a woman onscreen for me to think
that another man could fall in love with her. Even though this might have
been based on reality, I still had trouble believing he would be attracted
to her. </P>
<P>As an aside, I just want to say that there are a couple of humorous
moments in the film. At an early point in the film she makes a trip to LA
to promote a bizarre script idea that she is seen working on in the film¹s
opening. The overdone poolside conversation is cliche but no doubt
reminiscent of some real life experiences the director herself must have
had trying to pitch aesthetic ideas to people who don¹t even know what the
word means. </P>
<P>See the film. Not because you¹re going to appreciate the similarities
between filmmaking and tango dancing or the almost love story or the
needlessly weighty things Sally seems to be saying about the
creative/artistic process, but see the film because it is not like
anything you¹re going to see in America for a good long while. And enjoy
the dancing. I did, and I caught myself smiling as I watched. A film
hasn¹t done that to me in a long time. </P>
