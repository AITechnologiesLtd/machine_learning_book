<P>"Awww, poor baby... heehee!" - Howard Langston</P>
<P>Arnold, as Howard, is willing to do anything to anybody that hinders his
quest to find a Turbo Man action figure for his son for Christmas in
JINGLE ALL THE WAY.  Naturally, since he's Arnold and Chris Columbus was
involved in the production (as a producer), "anything" involves
generally beating the crap out of all kinds of people, animals, and
assorted objects - himself included.</P>
<P>JINGLE is ostensibly a family comedy, and, in the end, it does promote
family values.  Along the way, though, it also trumpets the joys of
brawling and divorce, as well as all but openly declares Santa Claus a
myth - three things that you may or may not want your kids exposed to. 
Most families won't be phased by this, though, and so JINGLE will be
welcome for viewing when the holiday season rolls around.  </P>
<P>The performances are mostly well done.  Arnold always has charisma even
in the most unlikely of roles, and it's a pleasure to see him apparently
having fun while he races around in this film, playing a bewildered
parent that's sharp in contrast to the always-in-control action heros
we're used to.  Sinbad steals many of his scenes, tossing out pop
culture references ("Rodney King... Rodney King... ") and acting quite
insane as the postal worker Myron.  Unfortunately, he's sometimes
portrayed as an unwanted comedic sidekick, and sometimes as a villian -
apparently someone couldn't decide what to do with him. </P>
<P>The physical comedy in a family show is something we've seen way too
many times before, and it'd be boring if not for the fact that it's
Arnold Schwarzenegger getting his clock cleaned for a change.  At least,
until the scene in the warehouse.  That's the location for the most
inspired part of the movie, in which Howard ends up in a brawl with evil
Santa Claus impersonators who'd rather deck his halls with candy cane
nunchakus than sit down for milk and cookies.  That whole sequence is
beautifully surreal - and belongs in a better movie than this.  How can
you not love seeing an elf announce the arrival of the police by
shouting "It's the Grinch!  Scatter!"</P>
<P>Yes, there's a fair share of flaws to this show, as is the case with any
movie Chris Columbus touches, it seems.  When the story starts, we learn
how Howard is an overworked businessman who doesn't spend enough time
with his family.  And that's got to be one of the most overused
character cliches in all of filmdom.  It's just plain painful to see it
now.  The movie stays in rut for about 15 minutes until Howard gets home
and makes up with his son (Jake Lloyd, aka Anakin Skywalker in episode
one of the STAR WARS series, to be released in 1999), and after that,
becomes light-hearted and fun for some of the time... and painfully
stupid at other times.</P>
<P>Those other times belong primarily to Phil Hartman, who brings the movie
down heavily every time he shows up on the screen.  And he's on the
screen far too much.  Hartman was an asset to "Saturday Night Live," and
continues to be one to "Newsradio" and "The Simpsons," but, on the big
screen, he's playing the obnoxious sleazy guy far too often, and when he
does it, he's just that - obnoxious.  Every moment he shows up on the
screen is a pain, as is the subplot of him moving in on Howard's wife,
Liz.</P>
<P>Of course, not all of the humor hits the mark, either, as if often the
case with family films.  And when it does, it doesn't always hit it as
hard as the warehouse scene.</P>
<P>When the finale finally rolls around, the film is charging ahead at a
full slapstick comic pace, and it all seems so likable that you tend the
forgive the ludicrous nature of the much of what happens in that
ending.  The whole thing is wrapped up nice and neat when the credits
roll.  But after the credits have faded, Arnold, Liz, and Jamie appear
on the screen for one last scene that has one of the strongest comic
payoffs of the whole show.</P>
<P>The cynical - yet accurate - view of Christmas shopping and the strength
of the certain elements of the comedy, along with the likable nature of
the show are all good points.  But Phil Hartman and the stupid portrayal
of Howard at the beginning of the movie drag it down heavily.  It was
tempting to make the rating 1/2 a star higher because of its good
points, but Hartman just hurts the movie too much.  JINGLE ALL THE WAY
is only a mildly diverting time, since all the good moments are hurt by
all the Phil Hartman moments which only serve to make the viewer angry
that he/she is being forced to watch his horrible role.  Sadly, thanks
almost single-handedly to Phil Hartman and merely a few other obviously
stupid plot devices, JINGLE ALL THE WAY only gets...</P>
<PRE>Rating: **</PRE>
<P>"Back up!  This is a homemade explosive device!  And I'll blow it up! 
Know why?  'Cause I work for the post office, so you KNOW I'm not
stable!  Tell 'em!" - Myron
"This man is totally insane." - Howard
"THANK YOU!" - Myron</P>
