I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Exuberant stand-up comedian Margaret Cho clearly enjoys her routines as 
much as her uproarious audience.  A self-described "trash-talking fag 
hag," she is a chubby Korean-American bisexual with a lot on her mind 
from sex to diets.  She's in favor of the former and against the latter 
since "the first thing you lose on a diet is brain mass."</P>
<P>Lionel Coleman's documentary, I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT, records Cho doing 
her routine in front of her hometown audience in San Francisco.  As a 
documentary, it is the most basic, just point-the-camera-at-her variety.  
Unlike Spike Lee's wonderful THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY, in which Lee 
incorporates audience reaction shots, Coleman slavishly confines his 
camera almost exclusively to either full-body or just head shots of Cho.  
We hear the audience laughing profusely but rarely see them.</P>
<P>Cho's material, which has some biting social commentary, is undermined 
by her fingers-scraped-across-the-blackboard style of delivery.  Her 
comedic grammar requires every funny line to be screamed with such 
ear-piercing shrillness that your soda container would break were it 
made of glass rather than plastic.  Repetition also plays a large part 
in her syntax.  The more a piece of dialog is repeated, the funnier it 
is supposed to be.  With her high-pitched scream, she repeated one 
unprintable line 16 times in a row.  A printable one -- "Lesbians like 
whale watching!" -- is screamed over half a dozen times and isn't 
particularly funny even the first time.</P>
<P>Reviewing I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT is like covering most Adam Sandler 
movies.  As I sat there unimpressed and never laughing, my audience was 
busting a collective gut.  Sandler crowds are like that too.  My job 
reviewing films is not to tell you what someone else's reaction is but 
to tell you mine.  Still, it is hard to stare silently at a picture when 
everyone else is in stitches.  Guilt sets in, and you subconsciously 
worry that your fellow moviegoers may vote you out of the theater for 
inappropriate behavior.  (The converse, of course, is even truer.)</P>
<P>Cho does have boundless energy.  She bounces onto the stage like a pudgy 
basketball player ready for the big game.  She is proud of her girth, 
and many of her jokes involve television executives who have dared 
suggest that she slim down.</P>
<P>Cho spends long segments on her distaste for straight men, saying "I am 
heterophobic," and on her preference for gay men.  (Still, she later 
describes numerous heterosexual episodes and only a single homosexual 
one that she has had.)  Continuing on her gay vs. straight theme, she 
reveals the reason that the men in gay porn are so much better looking 
than those in straight porn.  It is so that the men watching straight 
porn won't accidentally have "a homo moment."  Her exaggerated delivery, 
as always, destroys what should have been a good joke.</P>
<P>Cho likes to ask herself questions.  "Am I gay?" she screams shrilly and 
rhetorically.  "Am I straight?  And I just realized that I'm just 
slutty."  Although she can do cute facial contortions and exaggerated 
accents and can write some good material, Cho is a comedian whose 
grating delivery made me want to cheer only once -- when the credits 
rolled and the theater doors opened.</P>
<P>I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT runs 1:36.  It is not rated but would be an R 
for strong language and sexual humor and would be acceptable for high 
school seniors and older.</P>
