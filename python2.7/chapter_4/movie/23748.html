Director: Rob Hardy
Writer: Rob Hardy</P>
<PRE>Rating: Off Target (1 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>For a film touted as exploring relationships and Black sexuality, Trois
is surprisingly tame. Despite it's lurid subject matter and it's
passing nod to Fatal Attraction, it moves along with flat, uninspired
dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to
overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Freshly moved to Atlanta, Jermaine (Dourdan) and his wife, Jasmine
(Moore), have the trappings of a perfect life. They have a beautiful
house in suburbia. Jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm.
Jasmine is his supportive wife, who is finishing up her college
degree.  In an opening montage via a home video of the pair, we see the
unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs. This
is a couple that has it all. Into this Eden slithers the lure of lust.</P>
<P>Despite his outward appearance, Jermaine reveals himself as selfish and
covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person. A glimmer of
his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he
goes about his business, oblivious to Jasmine's concerns. We also find
that he has been relentlessly asking Jasmine to participate in a menage-
a-trois, much to Jasmine's dismay. As Jermaine puts it, "Don't you want
to be sexually free?"</P>
<P>Jermaine shares his desire with  co-worker Terrence (Smith), who
obligingly sets Jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in
just such an encounter. The woman, Jade (Palmer) is a direct
counterpoint to Jasmine. Jade, at one point was a college student, too.
Unlike Jasmine, she found herself pregnant, dropped out of school and
now struggles to make ends meet. To further reinforce their
differences, it's revealed that Jade is involved in a custody battle
over her son.</P>
<P>Inevitably, through liquor and a touch of duplicity on Jermaine's part,
the forbidden act is consummated. The aftermath of the encounter
sidesteps into Fatal Attraction territory as acts of violence are
perpetrated upon Jermaine's property with the hint that the violence
may escalate. By this point, Trois shows itself to be a soap opera
without the requisite melodrama: a Fatal Attraction without the social
significance.</P>
<P>The exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and
stereotypical. Jermaine comes off as insincere, sexually driven and
selfish. Jasmine is bland and subservient. Jade comes off a bit
sympathetically, but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy. Yet
another tale of a sexually aggressive "dog" of a man who imposes his
will upon his accommodating, innocent mate.</P>
<P>The last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve, but by this
point, will you even care? If the rest of the movie was as dynamic as
the ending, perhaps there could have been some freshness to it. As it
stands, Trois is pretty standard fare.</P>
