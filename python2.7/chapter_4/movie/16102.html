<PRE>                            A CIVIL ACTION
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A successful but unscrupulous
          personal injury lawyer takes on an environmental
          case and soon finds that he and his law firm may be
          in over their heads.  Stephen Zaillian writes the
          screenplay as well as directs an excellent
          supporting cast in a true and realistic story of a
          civil action case.  The film may even sacrifice
          dramatic impact for accuracy.  This may well not be
          the story the viewer is expecting, but it will be
          an education in how the law works.  Rating: 7 (0 to
          10), +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 10 positive, 0 negative, 7 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Stephen Zaillian has written some of the most intelligent
screenplays to be made into films in the last several years.  He wrote
SCHINDLER'S LIST and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER.  The latter he also
directed.  His second directing project A CIVIL ACTION.  He is again
directing his own script, a very nuts-and-bolts look at a civil action
against two major corporations as seen through the eyes of the lawyer
who brought the action and risked his law firm and his career on the
case.  The film is based on the book A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.</P>
<P>     The film's first moments are among its most chilling as the voice
of Jan Schlichtmann (played by John Travolta) gives us "the calculus of
personal injury," a litany of cold rules for figuring the settlement a
personal action suit.  A victim who is alive and suffering pays off
better than one who is dead.  A male victim will pay better than a
woman will and a child will pay least of all.  As he explains the rules
we see how he plays for a jury's sympathy in order to squeeze more
money from a defendant.</P>
<P>     Schlichtmann's law firm is considering a case from Woburn,
Massachusetts, where eight children have died of leukemia.  It sounds
like just the sort of idealistic case everyone would assume lawyers
should take, but several law firms have already turned down the case.
Schlichtmann is also inclined to refuse the case until he discovers
that there are two major corporations involved.  (Apparently no names
have been changed, by the way.  Certainly all the major characters have
the same names as the principal in the original court case. The viewer
will probably recognize the names of the corporations.)  Schlichtmann
attacks the case in the only way that he knows how, launching a multi-
million dollar investigation in the hopes that a sufficiently large
settlement will pay off the investigation costs.  This is not the story
the viewer expects.  A lot of it is about the financial gamble of
environmental litigation.  The huge commissions charged by the legal
trade are seen not so much as greed but as the pay off of a very big
investment.  In its own way this is one of the most positive films ever
made about the legal profession.</P>
<P>     As with SCHINDLER'S LIST we never actually see when Schlichtmann's
motivation changes from being purely financial to idealism, but
eventually his outrage is obvious.  However, his crusade will bring him
in direct conflict with eccentric legal genius Jerome Facher (not
unexpectedly well-acted by Robert Duvall). In the film Facher plays law
the way Bobby Fischer plays chess, repeatedly trying to get under his
opponent's skin.</P>
<P>     John Travolta is sufficient for this role, but never manages to do
anything beyond the obvious.  He just wears a suit well and looks
reasonably sophisticated.  But Robert Duvall really is a brilliant
actor, and here he has to take an eccentric and make him seem
formidable.  That he does quite nicely.  William H. Macy's role as
accountant for Schlichtmann's law firm seems a little overplayed, but
there is nice support by Tony Shalhoub and especially James Gandolfini
who plays with real sincerity.  It would be nice to see Dan Hedaya in a
sympathetic role for once, but this is not it.  He seems condemned to
always play characters seething with inner rage.  But Duvall steals the
show.</P>
<P>     Conrad Hall's camerawork is a little showy.  He intentionally
under-lights any courtroom scene.  Half of an actor's face will be lit
as if carved out of the darkness.  The score by Danny Elfman shows more
control than he usually has, but the end-credit song by Talking Heads
seems jarringly out of place.  In all this may well be the most
sympathetic and at the same time frightening film about the legal
profession since THE PAPER CHASE.  I give it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
