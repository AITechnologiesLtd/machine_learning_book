<PRE>                     HOME FRIES (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Black comedy set in part in and around a burger
restaurant that serves French fries not Home Fries.  So the title
doesn't really work and neither does the film.  Drew Barrymore and
Catherine O'Hara star.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), high 0 (-4 to +4) Minor
spoilers in this review.</P>
<P>   - Dean Parisot directs a screenplay by Vince Gilligan.
   - Sally Jackson (Drew Barrymore) does not know what will become of
     her.  She will soon be having the baby and the father Henry is
     telling her he will soon be leaving his wife, but he clearly has
     little intention of doing so.  Then when driving home one night he
     turns up a back road and is attacked by an army battle helicopter.
     The surprise kills him.  The helicopter it turns out was operated
     by his two stepsons angry about Henry's philandering.  But due to
     radio interference, somebody at the local Burger-matic overheard
     the attack and may or may not have understood what they were
     hearing.  One of the stepsons (Luke Wilson) gets a job at Burger-
     matic to find out what people know.
   - Sally's father holds whole restaurant hostage.  He is overpowered,
     but nothing ever comes of it.  He is not punished.
   - Catherine O'Hara manipulative character makes suggestion that her
     children kill people and then claims to have been misinterpreted.
   - Luke Wilson perpetually has a pained facial expression that looks
     like someone is stepping on his toe.  Drew Barrymore is too much
     like a baby doll.  There just is no chemistry between them.
   - Exaggerated and overdone chase scene.
   - Plot has not much to do with Home Fries, or even the burger
     restaurant.
   - A black comedy needs funny ideas.  This one seems strained.  The
     timing was off or something else intangible, but the film just did
     not work.</P>
