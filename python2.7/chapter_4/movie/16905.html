<P>_Six_Ways_to_Sunday_ (R) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>What is it with independent films with days of the week in their title?
Last fall brought the awful _Thursday_, a pointless, plotless, blood-soaked
exercise in nihilism.  I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse than
that detestable film, here comes _Six_Ways_to_Sunday_, which would more
aptly be called _97_Minutes_to_Nowhere_.</P>
<P>_Six_Ways_ exemplifies, all too painfully, the traditional criticisms of
independent film: pretentiousness, self-indulgent artiness, graphic
violence, a would-be "hip" sense of humor, a touch of "taboo" subject
matter.  The flat-out awfulness shouldn't be a surprise once one discovers
what director/co-scripter (with Marc Gerald) Adam Bernstein's only other
credit is: arguably the worst big screen _Saturday_Night_Live_ of all time,
_It's_Pat_.  _Six_Ways_ follows Ohio teen Harry Odum (Norman Reedus), whose
progress up the mafia ranks and budding romance with a mafia maid (Elina
Lowensohn) causes some strain with his beloved, overprotective--to say the
very least--mother (Deborah Harry).</P>
<P>As with any film, _Six_Ways_'s effectiveness--or, rather, lack
thereof--lies in the execution, and while the basic story (loosely based on
Charles Perry's novel _Portrait_of_a_Young_Man_Drowning_) may not sound so
bad, it's everything else that makes the film as unwatchable as it is.  The
dialogue is often laughable in the wrong way; the direction a study in how
_not_ to make a film (all  flashy cuts and "surreal" visual narrative
devices; jarringly abrupt shifts in tone); and the acting is even worse.
Reedus is a former model for Prada, and his sub-amateurish performance
shows it; Harry and Lowensohn duke it out for worst performance when their
characters square off over Harry's affections.  The only person, in front
of or behind the camera, who makes any kind of positive impression is
Adrien Brody, who plays Harry's wannabe gangsta best friend.  That it is
also one of the lesser performances I've seen Brody give says a lot about
just how insufferable this worst-of-'99 shoo-in is.  (opens March 5)</P>
