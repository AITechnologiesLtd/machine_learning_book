<PRE>THE WAY OF THE GUN
------------------</PRE>
<P>Parker (Ryan Phillippe, "Cruel Intentions") and Longbaugh (Benicio del Toro,
"The Usual Suspects") have tired of petty crime and want to make one big
score for early retirement.  While picking up easy cash by donating sperm,
they overhear a story about a surrogate mother who's being paid a cool million
to carry a couple's child.  Bingo!  The two manage to kidnap Robin (Juliette
Lewis) away from her bodyguards only to discover she's carrying the child
of Hale Chidduck (Scott Wilson), a powerful bagman with an amoral team of
his own in "The Way of the Gun."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie was frustrated to learn that even
after winning an Oscar for writing "The Usual Suspects," he couldn't sell
a script outside the crime thriller genre.  "The Way of the Gun" is 
an exercise in proving himself to Hollywood.  While this new story isn't
as slick as the previous, it's still satisfyingly twisty, even if the 
ending gets a bit bogged down.  McQuarrie also proves himself as a director,
getting solid performances out of his cast and achieving a retro-Western
look for his film.</P>
<P>Parker and Longbaugh end up in a massive shootout when they attempt to
kidnap Robin in the lobby of her doctor's office, only getting away with
the hugely pregnant woman when she tries to make a break from her own
bodyguards.  Chiddick brings in his bagman Sarno (James Caan), who disparages
Robin's bodyguards Jeffers (Taye Digs, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back") and 
Obecks (Nicky Katts, "Boiler Room") and forms his own team beginning with
suicidal Abner (Geoffrey Lewis, father of Juliette).  They make contact
with Longbaugh at a Mexican motel where Longbaugh demands $15 million for
the child.  Sarno advises that things will end badly.  Meanwhile Parker
is philosophizing with Robin and Chiddick's trophy wife Francesca listens in 
to various underhanded conversations when she's not dallying with Jeffers
or watching prenatal videos.</P>
<P>Absolutely everyone outside of our two 'heroes' in this story has a different 
agenda than appears on the surface.  Even Dr. Painter (Dylan Kussman, "Dead
Poets' Society"), Robin's gynocologist, has more than one hook into the
proceedings.  Everyone but the Chiddicks themselves will end up across the
border for a drawn out and bloody finale.</P>
<P>The cast is excellent.  Ryan Phillippe discards his golden boy shallowness
to play a suddenly God-fearing tough guy with scrubby facial hair and a
low growl of a voice.  Del Toro personifies cool as the elder, more goal
oriented of the pair.  Juliette Lewis is a fighter who keeps punching through
every obstacle thrown in her way until an unwanted C-Section is forced upon
her in a remote brothel.  Caan is the most complex character as the experienced 
and rueful bagman.  Diggs is suave, all killer cool while his counterpart
Katts is darker, brawnier.  Geoffrey Lewis creates a surprisingly sympathetic
oddball with little screen time.</P>
<P>The script features some great dialogue ('$15 million is not money - it's a
motive with a universal adapter on it.') and even some hilarity (Parker and
Longbaugh's sperm donor interviews).  McQuarrie and his director of
photography Dick Pope ("Topsy Turvy") use visual irony and Western style
earthtones to good effect, recalling the films of Peckinpah.  "The Way of 
the Gun" also offers up the most unique car chase (idea creditted to Benicio 
del Toro in the press notes) in movies since "Bullitt" and "The French 
Connection."  Score by Joe Kraemer inventively employs castanets.</P>
<P>If you can take a heavy dose of violence, blood and a pregnant woman
in peril, "The Way of the Gun" is like a mystery tour where the journey
is more exciting than the destination.</P>
