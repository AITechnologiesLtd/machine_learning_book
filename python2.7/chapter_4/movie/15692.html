<P>After fighting for the remote control that they have just received from 
a mysterious television repairman (Don Knotts), teenage siblings, David 
(Tobey Maguire), and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), are transported into 
the t.v. set and find themselves on the black-and-white 50's sitcom, 
"Pleasantville," taking over the places of the children in the show, Bud 
and Mary Sue. Their parents in the show are, as are the rest of the 
parents, the type that you might see on "Father Knows Best," or "Leave 
It to Beaver," with a housewife (Joan Allen) who does all of the cooking 
and cleaning, and a husband (William H. Macy) who goes to work during 
the day, only to return by saying, "Honey, I'm home," and to find his 
dinner waiting for him in the kitchen. Since David is a fan of the show, 
he can always tell which episode is occurring at a certain time, and 
urges Jennifer not to do anything that would disrupt their routine. 
Soon, however, Jennifer has had sex with one of the boys from school, a 
thing that no one in the show has previously even known about, and as 
many of the people in Pleasantville become open to new, fresh ideas, 
parts of the fictional world begin to subtly turn to real colors, 
including the people themselves.</P>
<P>If there was one word to describe Gary Ross' new fantasy, 
"Pleasantville," it would be the word, magical, and the less said about 
the story, the better. The film is a wholeheartedly original motion 
pcture, visually beautiful, and, while it starts off as a sort of 
"fish-out-of-water" story, it quickly turns it something far more 
meaningful and mature than expected. Although basically a comedy, 
"Pleasantville" also contains many serious moments, including one scene 
in which David helps his mother, played splendidly by Allen, who has 
turned to real colors, and frightened at the prejudices of the other 
people in the town, to cover up her face with gray makeup.</P>
<P>One of the big treats of "Pleasantville" is the way that the film very 
gradually begins to transform things into technicolor. At first, it may 
just be small things in the background, such as a clock or a flower, and 
it is quite entertaining picking out all of the delicate changes. As far 
as I can tell, "Pleasantville" is the first film to actually blend 
black-and-white and color together in the same frame, and it is never 
less than convincing and always gorgeous and strangely poetic to look 
at. Credit certainly must go to production designer Jeannine Oppewall 
and cinematographer John Lindley, for creating a whole new, unexpected 
world.</P>
<P>"Pleasantville" easily could have been the fantasy of this generation, 
just like "The Wizard of Oz," but there are a few minor problems that 
ultimately hold it back from being a downright great film. One problem 
is the Don Knotts character, who has no point in the story but to give 
the kids the remote so they would be put inside "Pleasantville." We 
never really get to know who he is, or what his goal was. Witherspoon, 
who has proven herself a fine actress, and doesn't disappoint here, is 
nonetheless underused, and seems to all but disappear from the middle 
section of the picture. And my last minor quibble is that one of the 
climactic scenes set in the courtroom owes more than a little to, "To 
Kill a Mockingbird," right down to the way the building looks.</P>
<P>These slight distractions take very little away from "Pleasantville," 
however, because as previously mentioned, the film is a magical 
experience. It contains enchanting, one-of-a-kind images, a memorable, 
Oscar-worthy music score by Randy Newman, and then, and this is the big 
surprise for a mainstream film, it actually adds profundity and realism 
to what, on the surface, might appear to be merely a 50's sitcom satire.</P>
