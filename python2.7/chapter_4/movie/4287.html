<PRE>                           HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: W. D. Richter's screenplay is a study
          of family relationships.  Some result in conflict;
          others have a nurturing effect.  Jodie Foster's
          second directorial effort starts well and continues
          nearly as good for most of its length, but in the
          end it turns into a feel-good film that does not
          take enough chances.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Most romantic comedies are about strong, emotionally secure people
finding each other.  A WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING or a PLAY IT AGAIN SAM
may be about someone superficially shy, but you will rarely see a
character have serious problems holding his/her life together.
Divorcee Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is to that point.  She
has lost a job she loved and her sixteen-year-old daughter has confided
that this Thanksgiving weekend she is ready to have sex with her boy
friend.  Claudia is also catching cold and though she hates planes she
has to fly from Chicago home to Baltimore.  Claudia has lost control of
her life just when she has to go through the annual trial of
Thanksgiving dinner with her eccentric family.  Holly Hunter usually
plays self-assured women and her performance makes the freshly written
and acted early part of the film the high point.  However, as the film
starts focusing on more characters and as Claudia finds her way back to
peace of mind, the film loses its creative bite.  Instead it finds its
way to the easy route of a well-worn romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     The Larson family is a study in contrasts and odd personalities.
Mother Adele (Anne Bancroft) is cold and needling and tries to be
always in control.  Father Henry (Charles Durning) is a late-in-life
romantic finding odd moments to dance with his wife and play the organ,
but has lost the capacity to be serious.  Brother Tommy (Robert Downey,
Jr.)  is a consummate but often obnoxious clown.  His pranks are
amusing for a short time, then start to grate on the characters and the
audience.  Tommy is gay and has brought a bemused friend (Dylan
McDermott) to the party.  Sister Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson) is an
upwardly mobile yuppie striving for a starchy respectability.  Aunt
Gladys (a skeletal Geraldine Chaplin) is getting a little strange in
several ways at once.  They will come together, clown around with each
other, get on each other's nerves, and make some painful admissions to
each other.  The contact will strengthen some relationships and show up
weaknesses in others.</P>
<P>     Jodie Foster's LITTLE MAN TATE was a heavy-handed and misplaced
argument against the fostering of intellect in children.  HOME FOR THE
HOLIDAYS's study in relationships works considerably better while that
study is really what it wants to be.  It falters only toward the end
trying to force a happy ending.  Even the chaotic Thanksgiving dinner,
the showpiece of the film, manages to show more humanity than farce.
Richter's script, based on a short story by Chris Radant, goes a little
overboard in some of its characterizations, especially those of Tommy
and Adele, and the dialogue is interesting, but not always believable.
Nor is it really believable that this family lets so much hang out ata
family get-together.</P>
<PRE>     This is a film that has a lot going for it, but loses points on
trying too hard to have too easy a finish.  I give it a high +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
