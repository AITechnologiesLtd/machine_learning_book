Rating: R</P>
<P>John Sayles' "Men With Guns" is about what happens to a society when brute force
and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining
power.</P>
<P>The film takes place in an unnamed Central American country, where the men with
guns are the rulers. Most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some
are controlled by guerrillas with guns, some are controlled by Army soldiers
with guns, and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves, bandits, and
terrorists. All people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by
their powerlessness.</P>
<P>However, like so many Central American countries, this one also features
modernity. There is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of
contemporary civilization: skyscrapers, hospitals, televisions, highways, etc.
But, it might as well be in another country because those who live in the
comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the
rest of the land, or else they are simply ignorant of it.</P>
<P>The film's main character, Dr. Fuentes (Federico Luppi) falls into the latter
category. One of his patients, an Army general, describes him as the most
educated man he has ever met, and also the most naive. Fuentes is a true
liberal, a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting
bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous Indians. With government assistance,
he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into
the rainforest to cure and educate. This program was to be his legacy, and he
repeats over and over that it was a good idea.</P>
<P>However, when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his protégés, he
finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned. As he travels deeper
into the forest, going from village to village, the story is always the same:
the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the Army soldiers,
usually for helping the other. When Dr. Fuentes asks a village woman why the
Army killed one of the doctors, she replies simply, "Because they had guns, and
we didn't." Rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by
the men with guns, because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain
power.</P>
<P>Dr. Fuentes picks up several companions during his journey, all of whom are
characterized by their loss. First, there is a young boy named Conejo (Dan
Rivera González), who has neither a mother nor a father. Next, Fuentes crosses
paths with a thief named Domingo (Damián Delgado), who deserted the Army because
he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities. Through his
ordeal in the Army, Domingo has lost most of his self-respect, and defines
himself only by his pistol.</P>
<P>Along the way, the group also picks up Padre Portillo (Damián Alcázar), a priest
who has lost his faith. As Domingo is running from the Army, so is Portillo - he
has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer, and ran away from the village in which
he was preaching. Last, the group takes on a mute girl named Graciela (Tania
Cruz), who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier, her innocence
and even her will to live forcefully taken from her.</P>
<P>Sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are
abundantly evident in "Men With Guns." (Like many of his films, Sayles might
have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room, but a
longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the
director is also the editor.) He creates fascinating, complex characters,
especially Dr. Fuentes and Domingo. Their uneasy relationship is also somewhat
humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power -
Domingo's attempts to control Fuentes with his revolver are constantly
undermined by Fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded (at first it is, but
later is isn't).</P>
<P>The setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself. Sayles knows
how to bring a location to life, whether it be an early twentieth-century coal
mining town in "Matewan" (1987) or a contemporary Texas/Mexico bordertown in
"Lone Star" (1996). Sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes
to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer Slavomir
Idziak ("Gattaca") successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the
Central American terrain.</P>
<P>Sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on
location in Mexico, using all Latin American actors, and having all the dialogue
spoken in either Spanish or native Indian dialects. The one exception is a
couple of bumbling American tourists who work not only as comic relief, but as
evidence of just how clueless the United States is about what is going on a few
hundred miles south of the Texas border.</P>
<P>It would not be a stretch to say that "Men With Guns" is a depressing film. In
fact, the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure. In addition
to loss, the main characters are also failures at something, whether that be Dr.
Fuentes failure to change anything through medicine, or Padre Portillo's
inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being.
Nevertheless, it is bleak material Sayles has chosen, and he deals with it
accordingly. The last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope, even in a
world where, as one character puts it, "Nobody refuses the men with guns."</P>
