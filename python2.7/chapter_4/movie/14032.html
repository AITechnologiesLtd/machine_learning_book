<PRE>REVIEW: Armageddon
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will
Patton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Peter Stormare, Keith David, Michael
Duncan, William Fichtner
Director: Michael Bay
Screenplay: Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J. Abrams
Australian theatrical release date: August 20, 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 and a half stars</PRE>
<P>Hotshot producer Jerry Brukheimer is all too familiar with corny,
underdone and translucent action flicks.  Thankfully, he's also headed
the production of some spectacular cornballs, most memorably The Rock
and Con Air.  This time, he's handed the directing reigns to Michael
Bay, one of the few directors this year who hasn't been suckered into
treating his material incorrectly.  Mimi Leader tried too hard to pull
off an effective emotional substance in Deep Impact, and Roland Emmerich
was up to his usual mainstream garbage with the massively disappointing
Godzilla.  Trouble is, he doesn't bother to change the pace or form of
the film and, although his material is treated with the precision and
care of a capable director, an on going sense of repetitiveness found so
regularly in Armageddon becomes tiresome and monotonous.  And frankly, a
little insulting.</P>
<P>An asteroid is descending quickly upon Earth, so a NASA team of experts
(including Billy Bob Thorton, the leader of the pack) smartly decide to
hire oil diggers to solve the problem. Just after a few demands are met
(including "no taxes again…ever") the team is ready to blast off and
save the world from destruction at the hands of Harry (Bruce Willis).</P>
<P>Everything runs quite smoothly during the opening scenes, with plenty of
explosions and car wrecks to satisfy most special effects hungry
viewers.  That's the first thing that separates Armageddon from the
similarly thought of Deep Impact: Bay is not at all hesitant to use his
computer-generated eye candy, but Mimi Leader let it all build up into
an exhilarating climax. I'm not sure which one is better - whilst I
enjoyed watching the opening scenes of Armageddon much more, I can't
help but feel that Deep Impact introduces its scenario, and its
characters, much more effectively.  Talking about introducing
characters, we first meet Harry when he's whacking golf balls into Green
Peace protesters, then gets a shotgun and attempts to shoot his
daughter's boyfriend (Ben Afflick).  And that's the sort of idiocy you
can except from these whimsical characters later on, especially when
they're, um, saving the world.</P>
<P>When the film is set on Earth, it's actually quite enjoyable.  The fast
paced, snappy venture into the lives of these idiots and the developing
of Thorton's character is all fun and games.  But it's when we witness
Bay's joy ride onto the Asteroid that things go dreadfully wrong for the
characters and our entertainment levels.  A brainless, dumb and utterly
boring collage of scenes follows, where every and any possible mishap
occurs to our inane astronauts.  In "the action film of the year" I
actually, literally, fell asleep for a brief moment just to be awoken by
one of the annoying demonstrations of digital sound.  I found myself
wishing that the Earth (read: the US) could kill two birds with the one
stone: that is, get rid of the Asteroid and, oh please, get rid of Bruce
Willis.</P>
<P>Most of the laughs come from Steve Buscemi, a weird little actor who's
played the Weird Little Funny Guy role so many times that he's almost
perfected it.  But honestly, can't he try to vary his talents a little
further?  Buscemi's Armageddon performance is a replica of his other
roles in The Wedding Singer, The Big Lebowski and Con Air, amongst
others.</P>
<P>Potentially, this film is a great 90-minute flick with a ludicrous 144
minute running time.  I can forgive Bruce Willis for looking like a
dopey yobbo, by I can't forgive Armageddon's editors for making me feel
like I was watching Titanic Special Edition in Space.  In all fairness,
it has a super ending - courageous, uplifting, joyful, etc etc.  But by
that time my eyes were barely remaining open and my ass bones were
aching just enough to warrant a wise thought: "Arma-gedden-outa-here."</P>
