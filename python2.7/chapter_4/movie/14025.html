<P>Instead. Instead of a movie about two guys echanging banal witticisms
in a convenience store.  Instead of three brothers pandering to every
cliche surrounding religion, relationships and infidelity. Instead of
holier than thou posturing by making a movie about three girls even
thouhg you're a guy. Instead of masturbatory musings about your
personal problems and LA nightlife.  Instead, Greag Araki has
committed to himself to the relentless pursuit of a unique style and
uncompromising vision that has yielded true gems of Americain
Independent filmmaking.</P>
<P>I missed the first installment of the Trilogy that this film
concludes, (Totally Fucked Up, The Doom Generation, Nowhere). However,
it is clear from the last two, that Araki is taking leaps and bounds
cinematically. Continuing its alarming capacity for ignorance, the
popular press gave Nowhere a cold reception. Most complaints centered
around accusations of a 'vacuous style'. A bizarre comment considering
how accomlished Araki's direction is here.</P>
<P>The first time you see a film by Araki, it looks like the work of a
cheap and clumsy wannabe. However, it seems that as his trash aesthtic
becomes apparent, along with his ideological position (a gay male in
US society) and subsequent psychoanalytic and semiotic concerns, Araki
emerges as an interesting and very competent filmmaker. Although his
homosexuality has recently come into question Nowhere wrapped in 1995,
and so many of these concerns were still brought to bear on the film.
As such, Araki's films in general are unappologetic, very loud
challenges to virtually every position held in conventional society.
Nowhere in particular is a savage critique that is both relevant and
convincing of youth in America and their cult-of-slacker-horseshit. On
this basis, although rooted in 90210 and other contenporary pop icons,
the film also reads as a poignant comment on the 'Kevin Smith set'.</P>
<P> Araki's visual style here is head and ahoulders above his previous
work both technically and aesthetically. Despite accusations of
excess, I'd much rather see Araki shoot loud murals than Ed Burns
incompetently choregraph steady-cam shots. Nowhere's quick off-tempo
cutting and surrealism is ample support to Araki's ideological
concerns. This film is evidence of heroic bravery in the face of the
Americain Independant scene as it exists today. This is best
epitomized in the final scene in which Araki shows no mercy in
carrying out a complete and total sabotage, thematically as well as
visually, of his entire film.</P>
