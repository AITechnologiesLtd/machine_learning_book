<PRE>from DROWNING BY NUMBERS</PRE>
<PRE>                     DROWNING BY NUMBERS
           written and directed by Peter Greenaway</PRE>
<PRE>Starring
Joan Plowright
Bernard Hill</PRE>
<P>     If THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER is a
necessity to see (which I think it is,) then DROWNING BY
NUMBERS is a diversion.</P>
<P>     Take a bit of Fellini and a bit of Agatha Christie and
you get DBN:  three generations of women plot to and
eventually do destroy the men in their lives.  But this isn't
the fun part.</P>
<P>     The fun part is in the detection necessary on the part
of the viewer to find the numbers embedded in the scenes.
But bear in mind that on a video rental, much detail will be
lost and also the copy I saw was not letterboxed, so portions
of the frame were missing from time to time.  It is also a
distraction to be sure, but the film _is_ about games. [After
viewing it a second time, I still missed quite a few numbers,
including #1 !]</P>
<P>     DROWNING BY NUMBERS is a game and a good game at that.
It's a combination of TEN LITTLE INDIANS and JULIETTE OF THE
SPIRITS.  If you follow Greenaway's work you'll want to catch
up on this if you haven't seen it before.</P>
<P>     I am drawn into these works and am glad I have made the
effort to see all the Greenaway films of which I am aware. It
seems that much of the superior filmmaking these days is once
again being done by Europeans (Vincent Ward, Wim Wenders, and
Greenaway.)  And if it weren't for vid. stores we more than
likely wouldn't have a chance to see any of them.</P>
