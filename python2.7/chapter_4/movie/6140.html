<P>     Any traditional version of Shakespeare's "Richard III" will open 
with "Now's the winter of our discontent made summer by this son of 
York", the first line of one of the Bard's best-known soliloquies.  It's 
a telling point, therefore, that LOOKING FOR RICHARD starts with a 
stentorian voice declaring: "Our revels now are ended."  This movie, a 
labor of love for Al Pacino, who makes his directorial debut, does not 
intend to present a complete, unabridged version of the text.  Like all 
film makers who take on Shakespeare, Pacino's goal is to give life to 
his own passion for the plays.  His methods are decidedly 
unconventional.  LOOKING FOR RICHARD is a condensed version of "Richard 
III" wrapped in a stream-of-consciousness documentary.</P>
<P>     Since this is the second version of the play (following Ian 
McKellan's RICHARD III) to hit screens within a year, there's a 
legitimate question about overexposure.  I don't think it's a serious 
concern, however.  Even with an actor of Pacino's stature involved, the 
general public is unlikely to turn out in droves to see LOOKING FOR 
RICHARD.  The primary audience will be Shakespeare buffs, and, even if 
they have seen McKellan's adaptation, they won't mind.  Besides, the 
films, despite telling essentially the same story, have vastly different 
approaches.  RICHARD III translates the play to a 20th Century, pseudo-
Nazi England while LOOKING FOR RICHARD keeps the original historical 
context intact but adds a great deal of work-in-progress footage.</P>
<P>     Pacino begins the film as a documentary investigating what modern 
day audiences think of Shakespeare's works.  The answers he gets during 
person-on-the-street interviews are predictable:  "it sucks", "it's 
boring", "huh?"  The director's motivation for making the movie is 
stated up front:  "It has always been a dream of mine to communicate how 
I feel about Shakespeare to others."  To do this, Pacino interviews 
numerous actors and scholars.  Sound bytes from his talks with the likes 
of Kenneth Branagh, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Kevin Kline, and 
James Earl Jones are sprinkled throughout LOOKING FOR RICHARD.  He also 
takes his camera to the supposed birthplace of Shakespeare and the site 
of the Globe Theater.</P>
<P>     After this lengthy introduction, Pacino moves on to the play.  We 
glimpse the casting process and are given an impromptu history lesson 
about the War of the Roses (which functions as background material).  
Someone in the crew worries that no one knows "Richard III", but the 
assertion is made that it's the most often-performed of all of the 
Bard's plays.  And, although the documentary portion of LOOKING FOR 
RICHARD is largely over at this point, occasional interludes throughout 
the remainder of the film return to this format.</P>
<P>     The second half of LOOKING FOR RICHARD concentrates on performing 
select scenes from the play.  Although perhaps only a third of the full 
text is used, even someone who has never seen "Richard III" should have 
no problem following what's happening (Pacino's narrative interruptions 
attempt to explain potentially-confusing issues).  The unconventional 
method of filming, which becomes a little wearisome through 
repetitiveness, must have required extensive time in the editing room.  
There are lots of quick shots that switch between a full, costumed 
version of a play and a simple read-through.  At times, LOOKING FOR 
RICHARD recalls VANYA ON 42ND STREET, although this movie makes the 
behind-the-scenes sequences a more important part of the whole.  </P>
<P>     A number of familiar faces fill roles here.  Pacino, of course, is 
Richard, complete with faux hunchback and limp.  Alec Baldwin (HEAVEN'S 
PRISONERS) plays Clarence, and Harris Yulin (MULTIPLICITY) is King 
Edward.  Penelope Allen (DOG DAY AFTERNOON) is Queen Elizabeth, Kevin 
Spacey (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) is Buckingham, Aidan Quinn (LEGENDS OF THE 
FALL) is Richmond, and Winona Ryder (LITTLE WOMEN) is Lady Anne.  It's 
worth noting that, while the play sequences appear to have been produced 
over a relatively short period of time, the entire film has taken years 
to piece together, as is evident from Pacino's constantly changing 
appearance (short hair and a beard in one scene, clean-shaven with long, 
flowing locks in the next).</P>
<P>     Although Pacino is attempting to make "Richard III" accessible to 
the "average" movie-goer, he probably doesn't succeed.  LOOKING FOR 
RICHARD is a fascinating piece of film making, but I don't think it does 
anything so revolutionary that non-believers will be suddenly converted.  
Pacino's passion is obvious, but it's not universally contagious. 
However, those who enjoy Shakespeare, or are at least open-minded, will 
find much to appreciate here.  LOOKING FOR RICHARD is unlike any 
previous adaptation of the Bard's work, and that's reason enough to give 
it a shot.</P>
