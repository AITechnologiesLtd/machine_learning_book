<P>"Magical" may be a good word to describe quite a few of Steven Spielberg's
films. He's notorious for elaborately done flicks, which are often fresh and
visually superior to the run-of-the-mill movies coming out all the time.
"Magical" can also be used to describe the world of fairy tales and legends
we've all come to know and love as children. So what happens when the two
meet? HOOK - and it's a delightful result.</P>
<P>HOOK asks the question, "what if Peter Pan grew up?" Simple, to the point,
and very intriguing. HOOK begins in modern-day America as Peter Blanning
(Robin Williams, excellently cast), a workaholic father of two, is taking his
family back to London where he grew up. No, it's not a vacation, and we soon
learn that it probably never would be since Peter can't get away from the
demands of his office. The real reason they are heading across seas is to
attend a special dinner in honor of Wendy Darling (Maggie Smith), the
"mother" of orphaned Peter and several others. We also quickly learn that
Peter's family relationship has suffered considerably due to his 25 hour
business days. He misses his son's soccer games, he pays more attention to
his cellular phone than his daughter's performance in a play, and although
it's never addressed, he probably hasn't made love to his wife in months.</P>
<P>While in London, the temperatures continue to rise (metaphorically speaking).
Even on the other side of the Atlantic, Peter can't get away from pressing
business matters and non-stop phone calls. Nonetheless, Peter, his wife Moira
(Caroline Goodall), and Granny Wendy head off to the award banquet, leaving
the two children in care of some no name maid (or something - Hell, I don't
know). While they're gone, tragedy strikes. Jack and Maggie (Charlie Korsmo
and Amber Scott respectively), the two kids, get kidnapped by none other than
Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman).</P>
<P>Naturally everybody freaks out and Phil Collins shows up playing a police
officer. Sorry folks, no rock video forms here. The only evidence left behind
is a note nailed, well actually "sworded" to the bedroom door from Captain
Hook. It seems ole' Hook wants a rematch with his "only worthy opponent", and
he's going to use the kids to make sure he gets it! </P>
<P>This is where things get interesting: Granny Wendy *is* the Wendy from the
beloved fairytales! And, as she explains to Peter, he *is* actually thee
Peter Pan. One day, long ago, Peter Pan never returned to Never-Never Land
(tongue twister, ain't it?) and finally grew up. But because Peter became
Peter Blanning and blacked out that part of his memory, it's as much as shock
to him as it is to us (in theory). And so, with nothing more to really be
done, Peter ends up flying the friendly skies back to Never-Never Land to
reclaim his children.</P>
<P>HOOK is actually quite an admirable film and, with a couple of exceptions,
couldn't have been cast better. Williams plays both Blanning and Pan to a T.
They could *not* have found a better man (or woman for that matter - think
Mary Martin). Hoffman *is* Captain Hook, mixing the perfect amount of evil
and cowardice to the role while Smith, Korsmo, Scott, and Bob Hoskins as Smee
are all wonderful and damn-near flawless. It's Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell
that really sinks and stinks. She's annoying and although she's probably
supposed to maintain a sense of youth and playfulness being a pixie and all,
she comes off more like some kid overly eager to charm us. Then again, when
most of your lines are spoken to yourself, it could be mighty hard to play
off of.</P>
<P>The sets and effects here are another delight. Seemingly simplistic at first,
the Never-Never Land sets add quite a bit of depth and realism to the film,
making it fun to watch as Peter re-discovers his true homeland. And while the
special effects are not those of flashy sci-fi movies, they are quite well
done and a pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>HOOK doesn't quite hold enough to be deemed a classic, but it does rise high
above mediocrity with it's dynamic acting, captivating cinematography, and an
enchanting musical score by John Williams. All of that tops off a richly
intriguing plot with a definitive hook (pun heavily intended). If you're
looking for some good family fare, this might just do you in!</P>
