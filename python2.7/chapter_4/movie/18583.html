SUICIDE KINGS (director: Peter O'Fallon; cast: Christopher Walken (Carlo
Bartolucci/Charlie Barrett), Denis Leary (Lono Vecchio), Jay Mohr (Brett
Cambell), Henry Thomas (Avery Chasten), Sean Patrick Flanery (Max
Minot), Jeremy Sisto (TK), Johnny Galecki (Ira), Lisa (Laura Harris),
1997)</P>
<P>Another film skewed for Tarantino enthusiasts, and this one is just as
conversationally maddening, filled with vulgarities and street talk, but
no sex. It pays to be the first one on your block to do it, because
imitation is always second-hand stuff, and this film has the feel of
something already done by many other copy-cats. But it was a funny
movie, in a perverted way, even if the story line just didn't add up.
But, then again, life doesn't make sense, as Carlo Bartolucci aka
Charlie Barrett (Walken), the retired crime boss knows, and he is the
main man and reason this film comes up looking good. He gets kidnapped
by a group of rich young men: (Avery (Henry Thomas), Max (Sean Patrick
Flannery), TK (Jeremy Sisto), Brett (Jay Mohr) and Ira (Johnny
Galecki).They chloroform him, duct-tape him to a swivel chair in the
isolated, shuttered summer house in Long Island of Ira's father, and cut
off his ring finger. Ira is the only one in the group who didn't know
what was going on, as the boys showed up at his house with Charles when
he thought they were coming to play poker. He is the only funny one
among the boys, berating them for drinking his parents' liquor and
messing up the place, as he acts the part of the nerd and butt of their
jokes.</P>
<P>When you hear the reason why they did this, you'll know for sure that
this film doesn't make sense. It goes like this, Avery's sister, Lisa
(Harris), gets kidnapped on a date with her steady squeeze Max (Sean)
and supposedly has one of her fingers cut off. There is a ransom note
for two million dollars, which the family can't afford to pay. The boys
figure that by kidnapping the crime boss (The logic being, he's a bad
guy anyway and deserves what he is getting), they can get him to put up
the ransom and use his underworld contacts to find the kidnappers.</P>
<P>This is Peter O'Fallon's feature film debut, as he chugs out all the
slickness he could muster to make this film seem like its happening,
including glittering credits that seem to be dancing on the screen. Even
the title is slick, as it refers to the king of hearts (the one with the
sword through his head). But it also could refer to the ill-advised
nature of the mission the boys are on, because what they are doing is
surely suicidal.</P>
<P>Denis Leary as Lono, the wiseguy lieutenant in Carlo's mob, who has a
constant dialogue going on about his $1,500 boots, and is the
temperamental strong-armed enforcer of the mob, is brilliant in this
role, providing enough wise cracks and controlled violence to make you
forget about the craziness of the story, as he keeps contact with
Carlo's lawyer and zeroes in on both sets of kidnappers. His encounter
with the dopey kidnappers of Lisa, shows how he goes about his business,
pulling the film into the gangster genre for a few minutes before going
back to its satire of that genre.</P>
<P>Suicide Kings has its share of surprises and plot twists, as it becomes
evident from Charlie's contacts that there was an insider on this job,
who is one of the boys who kidnapped Charlie, as he starts playing
mind-games with them, telling them that the difference between winning
and losing is being able to read your opponent. This is done while the
boys are playing poker, and it passes for about as much wisdom as you
are going to take away from this well-acted, dark comedy/suspense film,
that is absolutely ridiculous, but it is entertaining as escapist-fare.</P>
<P>There is one more priceless pearl of wisdom dished out, that I feel
should be mentioned, because it highlights the confusing messages the
film sends out, it was also uttered by Charlie during his confinement,
and for no particular reason it made me laugh aloud-- "Everybody lies:
But word on the street, that's solid."</P>
<P>This film is anything but solid, but it had a weird flavor to it, that
sometimes seemed natural and other times forced. But the performances of
Walken and Leary, kept me in this one, sometimes wondering what's the
story with this film.</P>
