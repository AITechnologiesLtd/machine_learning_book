CAN'T HARDLY WAIT
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) 
Columbia / 1:36 / 1998 / PG-13 (teen sex and substance abuse, language)
Cast: Ethan Embry; Jennifer Love Hewitt; Charlie Korsmo; Lauren Ambrose;
Seth Green; Peter Facinelli; Jenna Elfman; Jerry O'Connell; Michelle
Brookhurst; Melissa Joan Hart 
Director: Harry Elfont; Deborah Kaplan 
Screenplay: Harry Elfont; Deborah Kaplan<HR>Slasher flicks and teen comedies are probably the most well-known
cinematic staples of the 1980s, and their mainstream potency is still
being tested today. The "Scream" franchise may have boldly reinvented the
former, but throwbacks to the latter like "Can't Hardly Wait" aren't so
much of a revelation. The film doesn't put a new spin on its subgenre so
much as it repackages bits and pieces of its '80s predecessors and peppers
the proceedings with many timely pop culture quips. But however familiar
or shallow things get, an extraordinarily appealing cast runs to the
rescue; if "Can't Hardly Wait" comes close to working, it's in a large
part due to its ready-for-"Tiger Beat" players. These mostly fresh faces
really liven up some otherwise lackluster action. </P>
<P>Most of the action takes place at a big bash to celebrate Huntington High
School's graduation day. Attending the beer- and sex-soaked festivities
are our six main teenagers -- requisite nice guy Preston (Ethan Embry),
prom queen Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), star jock Mike (Peter
Facinelli), acerbic wit Denise (Lauren Ambrose), white "homeboy" Kenny
(Seth Green) and unpopular brainiac William (Charlie Korsmo). Kenny,
hoping to hook up with a girl and lose his virginity, ends up bonding with
Denise, who's present out of emotional support for Preston, who wants tell
Amanda of his longtime crush on her. Amanda has just broken up with Mike,
who's been tormenting William, who will seek revenge against Mike before
the night is over. Did you get all that? </P>
<P>Actually, the gossipy character interaction that composes "Can't Hardly
Wait"'s various story threads ring true for the most part. (Gosh, I was
there only two years ago!) It's within the characters themselves where the
movie begins to falter. That they're walking, talking stereotypes really
doesn't matter; this seems like a deliberate effort on the part of
co-directors and -writers Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan to emanate such
"classics" as "The Breakfast Club." But they fail to make their entire
contemporary cross-section of young people completely interesting. Both
Michael and William are crudely rendered, and their conflict, particularly
how it ends, is pretty revolting. The Preston-Amanda romance (or lack
thereof) is supposed to be Wait's main event, but it's hard to care much
about either person. </P>
<P>Preston is solely defined by his affection for Amanda, while, in turn, all
she does throughout the film is mope and pout. The would-be relationship
somehow manages to click despite the strange, hindering oversight that
we're never allowed to see why she's so special to him. This is not
because we root for Preston, but because we root for Ethan Embry, whose
endearing, natural and occasionally goofy charm makes up for his
alter-ego's lack of distinction. Embry ("That Thing You Do!") does a fine
job of getting the audience to identify with the anxiety, longing,
hesitancy and heartbreak of first love; if only his Preston were fully
fleshed-out, he'd be worth following into a "Can't Hardly Wait" spin-off
feature. </P>
<P>On the other hand, Denise and Kenny already are; when the film eventually
breaks up into several superimposing stories, it is only theirs that
crackles with the completely realized good-time vibe that Elfont and
Kaplan were probably going for -- and that's very likely because Lauren
Ambrose and Seth Green have a great deal of fun bringing to life the most
comedically vibrant party patrons here. So, while the material is
distinctly uneven, these winning performers, their occasionally winning
characters and smattering of winning moments make the whole package not
much of a chore to endure. "Can't Hardly Wait" is a decent attempt to make
a film that definitively encapsulates a decade's worth of teen fads and
attitudes. It's just too bad the far more successful "Clueless" beat it to
the punch three summers ago.<HR>Copyright 1998 Jamie Peck

"Joe's Apartment' would be a very bad comedy even without the roaches, but
it would not be a disgusting one. No, wait: I take that back. Even without
the roaches, we would still have the subplot involving the pink
disinfectant urinal cakes." -- Roger Ebert on "Joe's Apartment"</P>
