<P>        Perhaps having an easily identifiable title is all it takes to
get a movie these days. How else to explain the rash of unnecessary
and unappealing sequels - ``Odd Couple II,'' ``Species 2,'' ``Home
Alone 3,'' etc. - currently congesting marquees?</P>
<P>Add ``Major League 3: Back To The Minors'' to that list.
Granted, it's not as excruiating as ``Major League 2,'' but why
continue this franchise, especially since Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger
and Wesley Snipes, the guys who made the 1989 original work, have long
since fled? In their place is a trio of tired-looking ex-TV stars:
Scott Bakula (``Quantum Leap''), Ted McGinley (``Married With
Children'') and Corbin Bernsen (``L.A. Law''), whose wardrobe of
oversize jackets and baggy sweaters can't hide the fact the
once-upon-a-time hunk should now be sporting an ``I'm Not Fat, I'm
Fluffy'' bumper sticker.</P>
<P>The drabness of the leads sets the tone for the picture, which
is not so much awful as it is awfully dull. Movies like ``Titanic''
weave vibrant, colorful tapestries; movies like ``Major League 3'' are
as invigorating as watching Saran Wrap unroll.</P>
<P>Writer-director John Warren has torn several pages from ``Bull
Durham'' without appropriating any of its humor, sexiness or human
interest.  Former major leaguer Gus Cantrell (Bakula) is talked into
managing the Buzz, a very minor league team made up of quirky souls,
such as an ex-ballet star who does arabesques on the field, a
hoity-toity pitcher who laments the fact that backwoods diners don't
serve balsamic vinegar, and one genuine talent in the form of
``Downtown'' Anderson (Walton Goggins, looking like Jim Carrey's rabid
brother). You need not call the Psychic Friends to figure out Cantrell
succeeds in turning this motley crew into a ball team to be reckoned
with.</P>
<P>McGinley, in one of the most grating comic performances since
Chris Tucker in ``Money Talks,'' plays Huff, the snobbish manager of
the Minnesota Twins, a dork whose grudge against Cantrell leads to a
showdown between the Twins and the Buzz in Minneapolis. Indicative of
``League 3'' 's skimpy budget, the ``crowd'' at the big game seems to
number only a few hundred, barely enough to fill one section of seats
in the stadium.</P>
<P>Those sad souls who can never get their fill of Bob Uecker
will delight in his frequent appearances throughout the film, dropping
such knee-slappers as ``they timed this kid's fastball with an
hourglass'' and ``I've seen better hands on a clock.'' But the movie's
sharpest insight goes to Huff: ``When you get major talent, you get
major personalities.'' To elaborate on that line, you could say when
you get major talent, you get ``Major League,'' and when you get major
has-beens, you get ``Major League 3.''</P>
