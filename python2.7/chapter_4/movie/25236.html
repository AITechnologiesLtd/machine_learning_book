Reviewed by Dustin Putman, July 8, 2000.</P>
<P>A "Naked Gun/Airplane!"-style parody of the recent '90s resurgence of slasher 
movies was bound to happen sooner or later, and using the mother of them all, 
"Scream," as its major outline, one couldn't ask for a film much more funny 
or outrageously ballsy as "Scary Movie," mercilessly directed by Keenen Ivory 
Wayans (1988's "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"). Borrowing major plot points, and 
then skewering them, from "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "The Blair Witch 
Project," "The Matrix," "The Usual Suspects," and, yes, "Scream," the act of 
watching "Scary Movie" is akin to getting, on average, five jokes, puns, and 
one-liners, thrown at you per minute. As is always the case with spoofs, not 
every comedic moment works, but so many are thrown at you, and there is such 
an unusually high success rate, that anyone open-minded about humor that is 
almost always in bad taste should have the most rib-ticklingly good time at 
the movies this year so far.</P>
<P>Occasionally a scene-for-scene lampoon of the original "Scream," "Scary 
Movie" has taken its basic plot, and added a prominent plot point from "I 
Know What You Did Last Summer," to unleash its rapid-fire line of gags. 
Carmen Electra opens the film in the Drew Barrymore role of Drew Decker, a 
high school student home alone who receives a phone call from a stranger. 
While jiffy popping some popcorn, they prattle on about their favorite scare 
movies, including Drew's personal favorite, the Shaquille O'Neal genie movie, 
"Kazaam!" Soon, however, the fun ends as she is being chased around her house 
by a killer in a ghostface Halloween costume. She inevitably is killed (but 
not before getting her clothes torn off and given the opportunity to strike 
some tantalizing poses while in the midst of her yard sprinkler; getting her 
breast implant stabbed out; and getting hit by her dad's car while he is 
receiving roadhead from her mother). If this already doesn't sound like your 
cup of tea, I hasten to add that this opener is only a relative taste of far 
raunchier things to come in the next 80 minutes.</P>
<P>The next morning, rumors are abuzz at B.A. Corpse High School, where the 
innocent virgin Cindy (Anna Faris) suspects the murder is related to a man 
she and her friends, including her boyfriend Bobby (Jon Abrahams); closeted 
football player Ray (Shawn Wayans) and his sassy girlfriend Brenda (Regina 
Hall); hunky Greg (Lochlyn Munro); and his lover, the snotty sex-on-legs 
Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth), accidentally hit with their car and dumped in the 
lake a year before, on Halloween. Soon, the six students are receiving 
threatening notes and being slaughtered one at a time, by someone who knows 
what they did. Also getting in on the action is cutthroat bitch reporter Gail 
Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri), who will go to any lengths to get her story, and 
Deputy Doofy (Dave Sheridan), Buffy's retarded brother.</P>
<P>The less you know going into "Scary Movie," the more unexpected and humorous 
it will undoubtedly be, so to discuss many of the brighter moments would be 
unfair. Suffice to say, if ever there was a movie that proves how unjustified 
the MPAA actually is, it is "Scary Movie." With no less than three scenes 
showing the male organ (one of which portrays it erect), and an unstoppable 
barrage of equally naughty behavior and images (does an "orgasmic explosion" 
mean anything to you?), the film has somehow passed as an R-rating, when much 
less extreme films have received (1998's "Orgazmo," 1995's "Showgirls") or 
been wrongfully threatened (1999's "Eyes Wide Shut") with an NC-17. Alas, 
"Scary Movie" turns out to, indeed, be scary--scary that director Keenen 
Ivory Wayans and screenwriters Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, 
Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg, and Aaron Seltzer (whew!) had the courage to 
write such un-PC, potentially offensive material. That there are six writers 
involved in the film is usually a negative sign, but not this time. 
Apparently, all six had some really slam-bang, witty ideas and they morphed 
them all together into a sure-to-be-classic whole.</P>
<P>The whole cast of "Scary Movie" keep straight faces throughout, which is the 
right way to go. By making everything seem serious and real, it only proves 
more funny for the audience watching it. And if the sold-out audience whom I 
saw it with is any indication, there is going to be major repeat business 
just to catch all of the jokes that were easily missed the first time around, 
in part due to the loud, infectious laughter that swept over everyone. </P>
<P>The token virginal heroine, Cindy, is played by newcomer Anna Faris, and her 
delicious, likable turn is as good as it possibly could have been. Also 
taking advantage of the chance to test out their comedic skills are Shawn and 
Marlon Wayans; the delightful Regina Hall (1999's "The Best Man"), as 
loudmouth Brenda, who gets her much deserved comeuppance in one of the 
picture's best scenes, when she causes an uproar at the local movie theater 
showing "Shakespeare in Love;" Shannon Elizabeth (1999's "American Pie"), who 
is distraught that her boyfriend is killed until she learns she has just won 
the town's beauty pageant as Miss Fellatio; and Dave Sheridan and the sadly 
underused Cheri Oteri (TV's "Saturday Night Live"), as Deputy Doofy and Gail 
Hailstorm, obvious takes on the David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette 
characters in the "Scream" movies.</P>
<P>"Scary Movie" is never anything less than silly, but amidst it all are some 
fairly knowing moments of social commentary, including material on race 
relations, homosexuality, the portrayal of teenagers in Hollywood movies, as 
well as sly truths about teenagers and young adults. After hitting the 
unknown man with their car and deciding to do away with the body, Buffy says 
to Cindy, "We'll just pretend it never happened. Like the time we were drunk 
and went down on each other." It may not be art, but it does have a ring of 
honesty to it.</P>
<P>When film parodies work, they really smoke, but it is a particularly tricky 
genre in which most attempts fail. For every "Airplane!," there is a "Spy 
Hard," a "Wrongfully Accused," and a "Jane Austen's Mafia!," and "Scary 
Movie" is one of the very, very few recent ventures that belong in the former 
category. If you are in the mood to go to the movies, have a great time and a 
lot of big guffaw laughs--oh, and if you aren't faint of heart--it would be 
absolutely foolish to pass up "Scary Movie."</P>
