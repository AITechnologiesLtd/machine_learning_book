<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A sometimes engaging indie film about three best friends growing up in
NYC, that is a heartfelt story but is hampered by its awkward dialogue
and unfulfilling plot. It begins with the voiceover from a mature Danny
(Cryer), telling how he met at an early age his two best childhood
friends -- Stan (Stear) and Richie (Baez).</P>
<P>The crux of the film has them already graduated from high school and
functioning as young adults, living a life that is less rosy than their
childhood expectations. Stan, their outspoken leader, who was born with
a bum foot, is living with his childhood sweetheart Gabby (Skye), and is
unhappy in his current job as a pizza parlor worker, resulting in a
drinking problem. Danny is the timid one who works as an appraiser for a
jewelry store, a respectable job but the store operates much like a
pawnbroker's, and he feels unsatisfied with his position but thinks he's
lucky to have it. Richie, who fooled the boys early on by lying about
his sexual prowess with women, has had a mental breakdown and
disappeared somewhere in Coney Island, where his friends believe he is
living as a homeless person.</P>
<P>When the two friends go in search of Richie, in the deserted winter
landscape of Coney Island, we see in flashbacks all the disappointments
in their lives that led to their current despair and what bonded them
together and why this search becomes a spiritual odyssey for them.</P>
<P>They come across a few of the odd characters who inhabit the bleak
offseason playland, such as a photographer in his seventies who has the
boardwalk in his blood and can't leave the area, even though it has
deteriorated from his youth and he has led a lonesome life there. A
couple of men lovers who recreate a staged melodramatic lover's argument
in front of the boys and talk in an unnatural stagelike voice. And an
unethusiastic waitress, with a scowl, who serves them hotdogs without
any relish. A young Skee-Ball operator who talks like a college lecturer
about the rules in his place. All these characters seemed contrived and
left the film feeling flat, though comedy burst forth from time to time.
The best conversations are between Danny and Stan, and give the pic its
intellectual stimulus and reason for being.</P>
<P>The story of Richie, takes the film down a different avenue, as it is
wracked with pain. Richie has a chemical imbalance and chooses to be a
homeless person, with sparks of memory coming back to him, but because
of his sexual problems and guilt-trip over his sister's car accident,
and because he refuses to take his medicine to treat his condition, he
can't function as a normal person any longer. He is too depressed to
make any sense of his life and the film doesn't know what to make of
him, except as a tragic figure who was once considered to be like the
other boys.</P>
<P>"Went to Coney Island" never got untracked, though it had some bright
dramatic moments and some perceptive comic offerings, but it could never
come together as a complete picture. It was also done in by a needless
subplot of Stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten, which just
seemed like padding to a thin story. Too much of the film seemed to have
no place to go, just like misinformed tourists who go to Coney in the
winter to see the idle Cyclone ride.</P>
