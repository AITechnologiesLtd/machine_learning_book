<PRE>                             BODY OF EVIDENCE
                       A film review by Andrew Hall
                        Copyright 1993 Andrew Hall</PRE>
<P>    I never would have thought it possible:  Madonna has made Sharon
Stone look like Meryl Streep.</P>
<P>    Not to put down Stone by comparison, but Madonna is just awful Uli
Edel's new film BODY OF EVIDENCE, which looks - even from the previews -
like a cheap copy of BASIC INSTINCT.  The new film also stars Willem
Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, and Anne Archer.</P>
<P>     An rich old man with heart trouble has been murdered, and his
blonde bimbo girlfriend Rebecca (Madonna) is quickly arrested and tried
for his murder.  Frank (Dafoe) steps in as defense attorney; Bob
(Mantegna) is the prosecutor.  </P>
<P>     The prosecution thinks Rebecca is the murderer because she was
suddenly written into her lover's will just before he died and also
because they had kinky sex - yes, handcuffs were involved, so naturally,
she's guilty.  To complicate things, Dafoe gets - well, more involved
with his client than he should.</P>
<P>     Was Rebecca a golddigger who killed her lover for his money?  Or
was it his secretary (Archer)?  By the end of the movie, I hardly cared.</P>
<P>     The beginning of the film is extremely rushed.  We are introduced
to Rebecca and Frank, but we don't learn much about them.  Perhaps we're
supposed to have seen the previews and have seen BASIC INSTINCT to guess
what they're all about?  Once we get to trial, things slow down, but
it's too late.  We never seem to find out what motivates these
characters.</P>
<P>     Now, BASIC INSTINCT wasn't the thriller of the decade, but the
characters seemed somewhat convincing and at least interesting.  Rebecca
and Frank are just dull and lifeless.  Archer and Mantegna are decent,
but they don't have much to do.</P>
<P>     Dafoe sleepwalks his way through this one.  Perhaps he shouldn't be
blamed since the story is so bad.  Why in the hell would Frank get
involved with Rebecca?  Now, had we seen that he was unhappy in his
marriage or something, we might understand, but he seems perfectly happy
to me.  Then he just suddenly goes after Rebecca.  Why?  She's not
*that* great looking, Frank!</P>
<P>     Ah, though, there is plenty of steamy sex in BODY OF EVIDENCE, just
as there was in BASIC INSTINCT.  If that's the reason you'd want to see
this film, well, maybe you won't be as disappointed as I was.</P>
<P>     Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.  Still, the
ending was unpredictable and pleasing, especially if you're not crazy
about Madonna.  Oh, well, it could have been worse.  At least she didn't
sing.  </P>
