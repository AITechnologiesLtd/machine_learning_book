<PRE>THE CONTENDER
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com
filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>A day after The West Wing ruled the Emmy Awards, Rod Lurie's White House
drama The Contender screened at the Boston Film Festival.  With that
kind of timing, comparisons are unavoidable.  So with The Contender
boasting an intriguing storyline (woman nominated for the Vice
Presidency) and a top-line cast, how is it that I was pining for Martin
Sheen by movie's end?  I blame Lurie, for what I believe to be a true
dud of the fall season.</P>
<P>Lurie is an L.A. film critic-turned-filmmaker who made his debut with
last year's virtually unseen Deterrence, with Kevin Pollak as the
President.  Lurie's back to politics again, and this time it's Jeff
Bridges as Commander-In-Chief, and he'd like to appoint Senator Laine
Hanson (Joan Allen, in a role written especially for her) to the VP
vacancy.  Not so easy.  The Senator has enemies, like Gary Oldman's
Congressman Sheldon Runyon.  His team digs up dirty pictures from
Hanson's youth, and all hell breaks loose for the Senator.</P>
<P>It's not so much fun for us either.  The primary problem is that Lurie
just can't direct.  He rushes and bumps through his somewhat appealing
script in the first half, just so we can get to that naughty photo.  And
with predictable plot points, such as a clumsy, oh-so-secret rendezvous
to pass over the pictures, it seems that Lurie read some book about
moments needed to make a government conspiracy movie.  No wonder the
guy's favorite film is All the President's Men.</P>
<P>And I'm not sure he knows where to place the camera.  Not once do we get
a satisfying wide shot within the Oval Office, or anywhere in the White
House for that matter (don't have that trouble with The West Wing, do
you?).  At one point, he follows Oldman running down a set of stairs
with a jarring, useless Steadicam shot, borrowing from others' styles
with no narrative purpose.</P>
<P>Speaking of narrative, there are problems there too.  Lurie's subject
matter is admirable, but it takes way too long to get from setup to
dénouement.  Much of the screenplay smacks of a trying-too-hard
intensity, and scattered visuals (the Senator jogs through Arlington
National Cemetery -- I get it!) are as heavy-handed as Lurie's obvious
politics.  And although The President's been in office 6½ years, he's
continually amazed by the variety of food at the White House, ordering a
snack at every opportunity.  Cute once, passable twice, stupid the fifth
time.</P>
<P>What's inexcusable, though, is the hypocrisy in this film.  While Lurie
chides the act of digging up the photo, he revels in its discovery,
showing us a gang-bang snapshot 5 or 6 times.  Later, after his
screenplay smartly supports a politician's right to privacy, and we're
sure Hanson's past is immaterial to her success, the President asks for
lurid details and she tells him!  In my eyes, that cheats the character,
and it's a huge, cowardly cop-out.</P>
<P>On the bright side, Joan Allen continues to be one of this country's
best actors, and she'll probably pull an Oscar nomination for this one. 
She brings such a stoic pride to Hanson that I'd vote for her in a
second.  Oldman, who has spent much of his career overacting, is subdued
and natural as Runyon, and the likable Bridges is just plain goofy.  How
did Lurie get such talent in this picture anyway!?  I figure either most
actors are thrilled to sink their teeth into political issues, or this
guy smooched a lot of butt while reviewing movies in L.A.</P>
<P>Either way, fall will arrive, you'll make your decision on the upcoming
election, and hopefully, you will vote.  And, if hungry for fictional
politics, you should stay home and see what ol' President Bartlett is up
to.</P>
