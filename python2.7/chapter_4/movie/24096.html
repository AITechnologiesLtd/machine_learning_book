<P>Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a classic
Halloween tale, so it is a bit odd that this interpretation of that
story was release during the Christmas season. Perhaps it was intended
for the October time frame but was delayed.</P>
<P>Only a scant few elements of the original story are kept. Character
names are preserved, but the story is completely different. Whereas
the original is a simple story of jealousy and deception, this Gothic
film is a much more complex and intricate work. Deeper themes of
objectivity and reason, spirituality, treachery, and even pure carnage
are incorporated.</P>
<P>In this rendition, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a police
investigator in 18th century New York. His rigorous insistence on
rigorous scientific inquiry and thorough investigation is seen as
meddlesome by the courts, so he is banished to the rural village of
sleepy hollow to investigate a series of brutal murders.</P>
<P>The people of the village attribute the gruesome decapitations to the
legendary Headless Horseman, a mythical figure inspired by pure
bloodlust. Ichabod sets up residence at the home of village elder
Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), but dismisses the beliefs of his
host and the others. To Ichabod, the world is starkly rational, with
scientific explanations for all processes. His patronizing attitude
causes him to be not particularly well-liked except perhaps by his
host daughter, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci).</P>
<P>The world that Ichabod enters is dark and eerie, a signature creation
of director Tim Burton. The most enjoyable parts of the film are the
noir mood and Gothic themes that are elaborately constructed.
Unfortunately, the story is weak, and does little to complement the
cinematography. Although the film is able to maintain suspense and
keep its mysteries hidden, the story is ultimately muddled and it
builds into a ridiculously frenetic and overly cathartic climax.</P>
<P>Moderately recommended. The success of the film is in its mood and
visuals, not its story. The narrative is clumsy and becomes
uninteresting, but the imagery and special effects are entertaining.
It is not a retelling of the classic story, but a complete reworking
of it that fits it into a different vision.</P>
