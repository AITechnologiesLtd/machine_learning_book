<PRE>Three Times a Lady
Run Lola Run</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Poor Lola, she just got her moped stolen and now her boyfriend is going to
get rubbed out by the bad guys ... unless ... she can find 100,000 marks and
get it to him in twenty minutes.</P>
<P>Lola does a lot of running. However, that's not what the film is about.
Rather, it's a study of the interaction between would-be strangers and
ourselves, if chance meetings are varied by fractions of seconds. Whew...
what a sentence! Basically, Lola runs her same 20 minute mission three
times. The magic of film allows us to witness the big changes in outcomes,
based on tiny changes in timings. A pretty cool idea.</P>
<P>The director also takes his fair share of creative license in this
production. I guess he figures, "It's not possible to have three tries at
any one instant anyway, may as well give Lola a shrieking scream capable of
breaking glass. And draw a cartoon Lola on occasion to add to the
soft-spoken surrealism." (That's not a real quote -- just me supposin'.)</P>
<P>Franka Potente (Lola) looks great on film. Her appearance matches the
part -- striking red hair, but not distractingly beautiful. Her loser
boyfriend is played so well by Moritz Bleibtreu that I actually care about
him. Still, it's Lola's mission that is the beating heart of this little
film.</P>
<P>Driving the three part marathon is a soundtrack factory sealed with
industrial music. If pounding music sparks headaches for you, stay home or
bring Tylenol.</P>
<P>I loved the opening shot of a soccer ball kicked directly up into the camera
which must have been on a crane (or balloon or helicopter). I loved the
shock Lola finds when she barges in on her poppa for the dough. And I loved
the casino scene. (I'm being vague on purpose.)</P>
<P>Though lacking the solidity of a full feature drama, this colorfully
nerve-wracking art film is an interesting study in chance events with some
fun chili pepper moments.</P>
<P>In German with English subtitles.
Starring Franka Potente and Moritz Bleibtreu.
Writer/Director Tom Tykwer.
