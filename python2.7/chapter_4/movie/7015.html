<P>     Thirty minutes into WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, my stomach hurt from 
laughing.  Like some of the most brilliant comedies of recent years -- 
CLERKS, LIVING IN OBLIVION, and FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, to name a few -- 
WAITING FOR GUFFMAN reminds us of the true meaning of the term 
"sidesplitting."  And, unlike in many of the movies on my "funniest 
films" list, there's nothing bizarre or twisted about this humor.  The 
laughs dished out by WAITING FOR GUFFMAN are universally accessible.</P>
<P>     Director/co-writer Christopher Guest is most recognized for two 
things:  his satire and his marriage to Jamie Lee Curtis.  His best-
known work is undoubtedly THIS IS SPINAL TAP, which he co-authored and 
appeared in.  Those familiar with that film will find certain 
similarities to WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, the most obvious of which is the 
faux documentary format.  However, where SPINAL TAP, like many parodies, 
relied upon acid humor and vicious barbs to generate laughter, WAITING 
FOR GUFFMAN is a much gentler creation.  This movie can be considered an 
affectionate satire, because, while it pokes fun at small-town America 
and high school stage productions, it also offers up a heartfelt homage 
to them.</P>
<P>     Because the title sounds like WAITING FOR GODOT, some viewers may 
be fooled into expecting highbrow entertainment from WAITING FOR 
GUFFMAN.  They are in for a huge surprise, for, although Guest's film is 
exceptionally perceptive, there's nothing remotely artsy or pretentious 
about it.  This "documentary", which chronicles the production of an 
amateur play to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the fictitious town of 
Blaine, Missouri, offers one laugh after another.  </P>
<P>     Blaine has two claims to fame -- it's the "stool capital of the 
United States" and it was visited by a UFO before Roswell was ever heard 
of.  In fact, when the aliens landed in Blaine, they invited the 
residents on board their ship for a pot luck dinner, and when they took 
off, they left behind a circular landing site within which the weather 
never changes (67 degrees with a 40% chance of rain).  Now, Blaine is 
150 years old, and, to celebrate the occasion, the town council has 
decided on a number of special events, all to culminate with the play 
"Red, White, and Blaine", which is to be produced at the local high 
school.</P>
<P>     Directing this play is off-off-off-off-Broadway exile Corky St. 
Claire (Christopher Guest), the man who attempted to turn BACKFIRE into 
a stage production.  Corky is ably assisted by his music director, Lloyd 
Miller (Bob Balaban), and has a fine cast of six.  They are the husband-
and-wife team of Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine 
O'Hara), Blaine's travel agents (who have never been outside of Blaine), 
local dentist Allan Pearl (co-writer and Second City alum Eugene Levy), 
Dairy Queen waitress Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey), auto mechanic 
Johnny Savage (Matt Keeslar), and an old coot by the name of Clifford 
Wooley (Lewis Arquette).  Abandoning their day jobs and SCRABBLE clubs, 
they come together to breathe life into a musical version of Blaine's 
history.</P>
<P>     There are numerous reasons why WAITING FOR GUFFMAN works.  In the 
first place, it has intimate knowledge of the objects of its satire.  
Like Kenneth Branagh's A MIDWINTER'S TALE, this movie understands the 
backstage ins-and-outs of putting on an amateur production, and uses the 
funny side of that background in the script.  Anyone who has ever 
participated in a high school play will be struck with an eerie sense of 
familiarity.  And those who have lived in communities like Blaine will 
immediately recognize the acuteness of Guest's perception.  </P>
<P>     Secondly, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN doesn't go for cheap laughs.  While 
the performance of the play (which takes up the final third of the film) 
has a few minor mishaps, it is not populated with the kind of pratfalls 
that could lead to easy laughs.  The play comes off much as it might in 
real life.  And, perhaps unsurprisingly, there's the same kind of charm 
about "Red, White, and Blaine" that there is about any amateur 
production where the players substitute enthusiasm for talent.</P>
<P>     Although I won't reveal the film's biggest laughs, I can mention 
that one has to do with a re-interpretation of a scene from a 
critically-acclaimed motion picture and another pokes fun at the kind of 
movie merchandising that surrounds big-budget goliaths like STAR WARS.  
The auditions for the play are an especially good source of humor, since 
all of them are improvised and Guest is seeing them for the first time 
as they're being presented to the camera.  </P>
<P>     Everyone in the cast is on-target, from Guest, who plays Corky as 
is-he-or-isn't-he-gay, to Larry Miller as Blaine's mayor.  Special note 
should be made of Parker Posey (in the process of challenging Lili 
Taylor as the independent film queen), whose portrayal of Libby Mae 
couldn't be more on-target, and Eugene Levy, who plays the most fun-
loving dentist since Steve Martin donned a leather jacket in LITTLE SHOP 
OF HORRORS.  </P>
<P>     There is such a thing as comic momentum, and Guest has a good sense 
of what that means.  Comic momentum doesn't refer to nonstop jokes, but 
to an atmosphere that is always ripe for humor.  By utilizing 
accomplished performers and crisp editing (60 hours of footage has been 
trimmed to 84 minutes), the director achieves this.  I'm not certain how 
widely Sony Pictures Classics intends to distribute the film, but this 
movie is worth seeking out.  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is one of those too-
rare motion pictures that actually lives up to the label of "a comedy".</P>
