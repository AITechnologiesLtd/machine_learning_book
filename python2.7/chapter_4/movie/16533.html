<P>High school comedies have been pretty rare this decade. While the 
horror film saw itself revived back to the glory days of the early 
80s (beyond that, actually), teen comedies have been absent for most 
of the 90's. Sure, there was a Dazed and Confused here and a Clueless 
there, but after that, what are we left with? National Lampoon's 
Senior Trip? Can't Hardly Wait came along last year, and was a 
deliberate attempt to recapture the 80s spirit, when films like Say 
Anything, Sixteen Candles, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High were 
opening seemingly every weekend. The problem with Can't Hardly Wait 
was that it tried too hard. It remembered those great 80s films so 
much that the line between homage and ripoff was stretched very thin. 
There were some fine individual moments and it was certainly 
energetic, but in the end it failed. And considering it's weak box 
office performance, it seemed like the genre was dead. Well, She's 
All That is perhaps the very film that can revive this genre. The 
sold out theater I saw 
t in was very receptive towards the movie and so was I (albeit for 
different reasons).</P>
<P>Freddie Prinze Jr. is Zack Siler, a guy who is living on top of the 
world. He is senior class president, an honor student, pretty much 
runs the school, and has a knockout girlfriend (O'Keefe) to boot. 
Early in the film, everything falls apart. His girlfriend dumps him 
for Brock Hudson, star of MTV's The Real World. In an attempt to 
protect his legacy, he bets his friend (Paul Walker) that he can turn 
any girl in the school into the prom queen. The girl Walker picks is 
Laney Boggs, a social nothing who wears glasses, eccentric clothes 
(to say the least), and paints dark and disturbing works in art class.</P>
<P>One would think Laney would love the chance to get to know Zack. One 
thing I enjoyed about the film, is that she is initially reluctant to 
spend time with him. She is rightfully suspicious about his 
motivations, but he convinces her that he wants to learn about art. 
This may not have been just a line. She takes him to an art show and 
puts him on the spot. He goes up on stage, and in a wonderful moment 
of spontaneity improvises an act involving a hacky sack. Zach gets a 
real rush out of the moment. He's never experienced the thrill of a 
live performance before. Outside of the theater, he tells Laney she 
has beautiful eyes and should not wear contacts. This is a key scene, 
because this is the first time we understand that Zach's interest 
here is more than just winning a bet, and it happens before her 
transformation. That being said, the big transformation scene is 
every bit as wonderful as it should be.</P>
<P>At it's heart, She's All That is just a traditional romantic comedy. 
On a broader scale, it deals with themes such as responsibility, 
choices, and the high school social structure. Zach is afraid to 
decide what college to go to, and he uses his father's agressiveness 
as an excuse. Laney hides her true feelings in her bizaare paintings 
and uses her father and brother, both of whom she practically takes 
care of, as an excuse for not having a social life. John Hughes 
usually attacked parents, and presented them as one-dimensional 
subhumans who had no ability to understand what their children were 
going through. She's All That takes a different route. It says 
someone must make their own choices, and take responsibility for 
themselves, no matter what problems their parents might present. 
The social structure in high school is the most painful, inhumane, 
cruel thing for a teenager to go through. Both Zach and Laney begin 
to understand this. They also learn that it's possible to survive 
this structure without actually becoming part of it. Laney has a line 
later in the film - "I think the right person is up there" - that 
pretty much sums up this theme.</P>
<P>Freddie Prinze Jr.'s performance is really strong here, as opposed to 
his bland, wooden performance in I Know What You Did Last Summer. At 
the beginning of the film, he is the typical all-american egotistical 
jock, proud of his legendary existence. To Prinze's credit, Zach is 
never too obnoxious. This is because Prinze never overacts. Instead, 
he relies on his natural charisma and allows the material to speak 
for itself. It's a gamble that pays off because later in the film it 
allows him to be quite charming. As Laney, Rachael Leigh Cook is 
quite a revelation. Like Janeane Garofalo in The Truth About Cats and 
Dogs, she is beleivable as someone who could be perceived as an ugly 
duckling by the majority, eventhough the rest of us know better. She 
has one particular scene, when she learns of the bet, where she 
delivers a line of pure uninhibited rage perfectly. There is more to 
anger than just shouting and Cook understands that. Together, they 
have a fabulous chemistry, and every scene between them is absolute
y delightful.</P>
<P>If She's All That has a flaw, it is in the annoying portrayal of two 
supporting characters. I very much enjoyed Jodi Lyn O' Keefe's 
performance in Halloween: H20 (though I didn't enjoy the film), but 
here she seems to be on a mission to steal every single scene she is 
in. Instead of just playing her one-dimensional character as a bitchy 
snob, O'Keefe wildly overacts with a repetitive line delivery and 
bizaare facial expressions. Look at Jordanna Brewster's performance 
in The Faculty for a much better portrayal of a similar character. 
Then there is Matthew Lillard as Brock Hudson, the Real World star. 
His performance is fine on it's own I suppose, but it really belongs 
in a different movie. I think this subplot would've worked better if 
O'Keefe's character got together with one of Zach's friends.</P>
<P>However, other minor characters are simply wonderful. I admired how 
the film gives each of them a chance to shine. Kevin Pollak, as 
Laney's dad, is addicted to watching Jeapordy. The fact that he never 
knows the right answer doesn't prevent him from giving a hilariously 
wrong one anyways. Paul Walker's performance is interesting, because 
he is able to disguise his true intentions several times throughout 
the film. Keiran Culkin is amusing as Laney's younger brother, and 
the friendship that develops between him and Zach is actually 
touching. Elden Henson, as Laney's childhood friend, and Anna Paquin, 
as Zach's sister, also have some very nice moments.</P>
<P>Lee Fleming's script is witty and smart. He doesn't rely on tired 
cliche's to wrap the film up.  A key confrontation is left off screen,
 and instead just revealed through dialogue. This allows the incident 
to be funny, instead of horrifically out of place, as it would've 
seemed if shown on screen. Iscove does a fine job throughout. The 
film is never boring, and a big dance scene at the prom is quite an 
exhilarating moment, thanks to some wonderful choreography combined 
with lively music. She's All That isn't very original on it's surface.
 It's another retelling of the Pygmalion story. But it's execution 
that matters the most, and Iscove, Fleming, and the actors execute 
the material just right.</P>
