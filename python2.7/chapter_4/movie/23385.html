<P>CrankyCritic® movie reviews: Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samurai
Rated  [R], 115 minutes
Starring Forrest Whitaker, John Tormey
Written and Directed by Jim Jarmusch
website: www.wayofthesamurai.com</P>
<P>IN SHORT: Deliberately paced urban samurai flick. Magnificent
performance by Forest Whitaker.</P>
<P>Cranky walked in to the screening of Ghost Dog with two preconceptions.
First: Somewhere in Hollywood there's a guy (sic) in an office who's job
it is to think of various genres that have never been combined in a
movie script before, which is normally as bad an idea as it sounds.
Second: I've never seen star Forest Whitaker give a bad performance.</P>
<PRE>Still haven't.</PRE>
<P>And I don't know much about the Samurai way of life, for which Jim
Jarmusch's film provides more than adequate background. Each major scene
is preceded by a quote from the Hagakure an 18th century "manual" (sic)
of Samurai thought and behavior. The quotes all have their purpose; they
keep this story to a slow and deliberate pace, not unlike the Samurai we
see in this story, called Ghost Dog (Whitaker). "Slow" is a deliberate
ruse on a Samurai's part. When it is time to battle, he moves like a
cyclonic wind -- quick and deadly. A weapon is never drawn unless it is
to be used; though we see a sword used for practice, Ghost Dog's
preference is an arsenal well equipped with things that go "boom!"</P>
<P>Ghost Dog serves a Master he has seen, prior to the start of this flick,
only twice. Made-man Louie (John Tormey) once saved a much younger Dog
from street thugs. As an adult Samurai pledged to his service, Ghost Dog
communicates through the use of passenger pigeons, cooped near the
ramshackle rooftop shed that he lives in. It's a nice touch, as the
Master/Samurai relationship is as long extinct in the modern world as is
this species of pigeon.</P>
<P>The mobsters we see are middle aged, mostly overweight relics of an
older era. Louie has ordered Ghost Dog to kill Handsome Frank (Richard
Portnow), but the hit is witnessed by the Mob boss' daughter, Louise
(Tricia Vessey). Louise wasn't supposed to be present at the hit. The
boss, Vargo (Henry Silva), orders Ghost Dog to be put down, else Louie
will take the blame. As for the Samurai, there is one more thing you
should know: It is considered the ultimate disgrace to allow one's
Master to be killed (Masterless Samurai are called Ronin, and that film
of Frank Miller's graphic novel languishes in development hell.) While
anyone with half a brain can see the Ultimate Showdown coming a mile
away, getting there is a trip.</P>
<P>The bloodshed, when it comes, is fast and furious. Balancing it all is a
surprising amount of humor in Jarmusch's script, highlighted by a
totally whack performance by rapfan mobster Sonny Valerio (Cliff
Gorman).</P>
<P>Is there enough violence to make the teens happy? Doubtful. Is there
enough characterization and story for us grownups? tons. Cranky hopes
Ghost Dog isn't too slow-moving to break out of the arthouse market.
Whitaker's performance is so well worth seeing, it becomes the first
name on the list we keep locked away until December comes rolling
around.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,
he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<P>Well above the arthouse average and Recommended.</P>
