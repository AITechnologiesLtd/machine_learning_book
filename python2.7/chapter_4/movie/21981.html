<P>Another driver, a very different kind of taxi.  The latest collaboration of
screenwriter Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese inevitably brings to
mind  their first, 1976's "Taxi Driver."  Like cabby Travis Bickle, paramedic
Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) cruises New York City on the graveyard shift and
has a front-row seat for all the misery and depravity those mean streets can
offer.  Like Travis, Frank is drawn to a woman he wants to save, and both men
also seek to redeem themselves - Travis through violence, Frank through
healing.</P>
<P>Frank suffers from burnout.  He hasn't saved anyone in months, and the ghost of
a homeless girl (Cynthia Roman) who died because of his mistakes pursues Frank
with accusations.  He has become convinced that his purpose is not to save
lives but to serve as a "grief mop."  Some of the grief he mops early in the
movie belongs to Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette) whose estranged father has
suffered a heart attack.  After Frank restarts Mr. Burke's heart, the old man
is transferred to the hospital, where Mary will be found holding vigil when
Frank returns again and again with other patients.  In Mary, a recovering drug
addict, Frank finds a fellow lost soul.</P>
<P>Frank is partnered with a variety of paramedics whose reactions to the carnage
differ from his:  Larry (John Goodman) seems unconcerned and dreams of starting
his own ambulance service, Marcus (Ving Rhames) puts his faith in Jesus and
calls on Frank to do likewise, and Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a violent bigot who
thrives on blood and pain.  Wandering through it all as pale and dazed as the
living dead, Frank explores various routes in search of his own peace,
including drugs from Mary's dealer (Cliff Curtis) and a destructive rampage
with a baseball bat.  Every night Frank begs his boss to fire him, yet he will
not quit.  His eventual redemption is heavily ironic and raises more questions
than it resolves.</P>
<P>Of the many resurrections of the 1970s in recent years, "Bringing Out the Dead"
is the most welcome.  When Scorsese closed that decade with "Raging Bull" (also
from a Schrader screenplay), he seemed to exhaust the style and themes that had
produced not only "Taxi Driver" but also "Mean Streets" and "Alice Doesn't Live
Here Anymore."  Since then he's successfully explored a wide range of genres
including offbeat comedy ("The King of Comedy" and "After Hours"), gangsters
("GoodFellas" and "Casino"), and period pieces ("The Age of Innocence" and
"Kundun").  Now Scorsese returns to familiar turf with the varied skills of a
seasoned director.  With dizzying cinematography and editing, the filmmakers
successfully depict Frank's interior world.</P>
<P>Frank Pierce is Cage's most challenging role since "Leaving Las Vegas," and he
proves again that he is a substantial actor. "Bringing Out the Dead" is also
the first film real-life spouses Cage and Arquette have made together.  Their
romantic scenes seem touchingly genuine.  The entire cast gives strong
performances from start to finish.  It's especially nice that Rhames is getting
to demonstrate his acting range; too many of his most prominent roles have been
criminals and thugs.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  Scorsese and Schrader are an unbeatable combination.</P>
