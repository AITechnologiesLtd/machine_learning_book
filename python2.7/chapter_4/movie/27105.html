<P>Directed by Gus Van Sant, the story focuses on a young man with intellectual
gifts beyond those of his fellow peers. A boy with a soft heart, little
faith in himself and no real desire to stand out. A kid who only begins to
believe in his own self-worth when taken under the wings of an older, wiser
man, who himself, has also got issues to overcome. That was the plot line
for GOOD WILL HUNTING, a film which garnered an Oscar in screenwriting for
the buddy-acting duo out of Boston, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Three years
later, director Gus Van Sant has decided to take another shot at a very,
very similar film. In my humble opinion, the former was a much better movie.
This one is only passable. And the cameo is cute, but more distracting than
anything.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A young black man living in the Bronx is dared by his friends to break into
the house of an older man considered by all to be nothing more than a
hermit. After their initial encounter, the two strike up a friendship as the
older gentleman helps the younger one improve his writing skills. It turns
out that he is none other than William Forrester, a long-lost writer who
penned one incredible novel over 50 years ago and then disappeared.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The great performance given here by first-time actor Rob Brown and the
semi-inspirational story of the film doesn't save it from feeling déjà vu,
telegraphing most of its scenes from the start and wasting plenty of its
side characters. Other than the main duo in this film, who did provide for
some great moments and solid chemistry, the rest of the cast here felt quite
underwritten. Anna Paquin is barely given any soul, Busta Rhymes is funny
but presented with little background and none of Brown's friends in the
movie have anything more than a few lines to distinguish themselves. The
worst case goes out to F. Murray Abraham, who is nothing more than a
one-dimensional "road-block" inserted into the story for obvious conflict
reasons. With that in mind, his character's shenanigans didn't really
provide for any real tension, since his obvious "destructive" nature, left
little doubt as to the film's outcome. Anybody who has seen even one other
"inspirational" movie should be able to see what is ultimately going to
happen once the relationship between Connery and Brown blossoms. But even
more importantly, their story simply did not pull me in emotionally. Brown
was really good as the young boy with the genius brewing under his tough
exterior, but Connery was simply okay as the crabby Scottish drunken guy.</P>
<P>I don't know, maybe I just predicted too much of this film from the get-go,
but I can't imagine anyone else not doing the same. And with very little
development around the two main protagonists of the story, I just didn't get
into their characters as much as I was hoping to. I would have liked more
background on both of them as well. The little we did learn wasn't enough to
satisfy all of my queries. And despite the film moving at a decent pace
(it's long but I didn't feel it go by), Van Sant made some very odd choices
in directing, which stood out for me as a viewer. The slo-mo shots seemed
out of place in this straight-forward drama and the final speech given by
one of the characters was drowned out by a grand score, meant to tug at us
emotionally. Only I was left wondering what the words were that he was
saying. I mean, the film is about writers after all and yet we are barely
treated to any words written by either of the two main players. That was too
bad. With that in mind, I would suggest anyone interested in this topic to
check out WONDER BOYS starring Michael Douglas. That film also covers just
about the same points made in this one, only it focuses more on the older
character instead of the younger one, and does provide for a much stronger
story and better developed secondary characters. All in all, this movie was
an interesting watch, mainly because of the great chemistry between the two
leads, but left me with very little to take home and even less to recommend
to others.</P>
