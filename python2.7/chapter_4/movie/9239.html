Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 50</PRE>
<P>"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was a surprise summer hit in 1985.
Kids loved it, leading to a lengthy Saturday morning television
run for star Pee Wee Herman.  But while the TV show was
only twenty minutes and tightly structured, the film version
has only a thin plot that must cover ninety minutes, leading
to inconsistent humor and an episodic storyline.</P>
<P>Pee Wee Herman's prize possession is his eyesore neon-red
bicycle.  After it is stolen, Pee Wee searches nationwide
for it.  He runs into various characters that are almost as
eccentric as he is.  There is a chase scene involving
Godzilla and Santa Clause.  There is a happy ending.</P>
<P>For those who have escaped American eighties culture, as
well as episodes of Murphy Brown, I will attempt to describe
the character of Pee Wee Herman.  He is nerdy, pre-adolescent,
asexual, and uninhibited.  He makes curious faces, has a
goofy laugh, and has no visible means of support.  When
standing, his arms jut at odd angles from his body, as
if imitating a tea kettle.  He has no clue about what
impression he is making, and has no qualms about turning
people he dislikes into enemies.  He is naively trusting
when it comes to meeting strangers.</P>
<P>While kids embraced the film, the intention was to make a
comedy that adults would enjoy.  But the supporting cast
of chums and antagonists are all cartoonish, especially
a gang of look-alike bikers that share the same two emotions 
of joy and anger.</P>
<P>The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack by 
Danny Elfman, which bounces along merrily.  Burton's direction 
is hit and miss, much as we would expect a movie to be if a 
camera simply follows Herman around.  It is sometimes funny 
and always a little odd.</P>
