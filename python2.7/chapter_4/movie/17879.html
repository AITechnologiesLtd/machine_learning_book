<P> SNAKE EYES  (director: Brian De Palma; cast: Nicholas Cage, Gary
Sinise,Carla Gugino, Luis Guzman, Stan Shaw, Kevin Dunn, John Heard,
1998)</P>
<P>After a brilliant, stylish opening sequence, this film begins to unravel
and by the time it ends, it is a misfire. Cage and Sinise play well off
each other: Sinise reserved (just right for the part), Cage frenetic
(over - emoting but still very effective). Cage is the free - spirited,
corrupt Atlantic City cop and childhood friend of Sinise, who is the
naval officer in charge of security for the secretary of defense.</P>
<P>He is in Atlantic City to protect the secretary while he attends the
heavyfight fight, that turns out to be fixed; Cage is his guest, he is
only there to watch the fight, but in some ludicrous way becomes in
charge of the investigation after the assassination.The assassination
taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done, and well
worth the price of admission, as De Palma goes crazy with his cameras
offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the
casino.</P>
<P>We are witnesses to this assassination from many different perspectives.
We soon learn who the villains are, so the picture that so brilliantly
set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as:
loyalty, corruption, sense of duty, patriotism, and one's own personal
dilemmas begins to go off in another direction, in the direction of
where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds, that
is, it turns into a flat action movie, where things are easily
predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the
characters.</P>
<P>The camera is the only star of this film. In the end, this became a
very annoying  picture that promised so much and only delivered what
could be best described, as superficial entertainment.</P>
