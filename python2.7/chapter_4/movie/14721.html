Susan Granger's review of 'THE IMPOSTORS" (Fox Searchlight Pictures)</PRE>
<P> Stanley Tucci's "Big Night" was one of my favorite films of
1996 and, incredibly, his second comedy is a genuine delight. No, it's
not as witty as "Big Night." That's a hard act to follow. But it is
genuinely wacky and hysterically funny. Conceived as a madcap
screwball farce, it stars Tucci and Oliver Platt as two out-of-work
theater actors who, after bumbling a big audition with a
writer/director (Woody Allen), accidentally stow away on a luxury
ocean liner in the 1930s. No, not the Titanic, the
S.S. Intercontinental, sailing to Paris. Masquerading as stewards,
they try to avoid a pretentious British actor (Alfred Molina) whom
they have unwittingly offended. Dashing down the corridors, they
encounter various crew members: the German Head Steward (Campbell
Scott,) who is in love with the Head Stewardess (Lily Taylor), who is
in love with the ship's detective (Matt McGrath), a shy young Italian
who is terrified of hurting anyone. Then there are the passengers: a
suicidal singer (Steve Buscemi), a deposed Queen (Isabella
Rossellini), an obsessed sheik (Teagle F. Bougere), an impoverished
socialite (Dana Ivey), her morose daughter (Hope Davis), and a tennis
pro who plays a better game off the court (Billy Connolly). And when
they discover that the nefarious First Mate (Tony Shalhoub) has
planted bombs to go off at midnight, chaos reigns. Written and
directed by Tucci, at times it resembles a silent movie but with
sound. There's Buster Keaton slapstick and Charlie Chaplin
pantomime. Tucci's Laurel, Platt's Hardy. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "The Impostors" is a frothy, zany 7, as bubbly and
intoxicating as a glass of vintage champagne.</P>
