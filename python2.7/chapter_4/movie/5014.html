                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        CADILLAC MAN is not the first movie to revolve around a hostage
situation, and it certainly won't be the last.  Screenwriter Ken Friedman,
however, has constructed a hostage crisis which transcends the usual
Hollywood formulas and cliches.  CADILLAC MAN puts a new spin on an old
wheel by being the first hostage movie I can think of to feature a confused
terrorist who doesn't know what he wants--a terrorist whose only demand is
that the police "go away."  The movie also adds the new twist of having its
hero, Robin Williams, try to TALK his way out of the crisis rather than
SHOOT his way out.</P>
<P>        CADILLAC MAN has an overly long set-up, but once the movie kicks
into gear, it gets a lot of mileage out of an intriguing premise.  Williams
plays a car salesman whose personal life is in shambles.  He has serious
female trouble with not only his girlfriend (Lori Petty) but also his
ex-wife (Pamela Reed) and his money-draining mistress, splendidly played by
Fran Drescher.  At first, the movie seems kind of forced, especially
Williams' voice-over narration, which is meant to establish his character.
But just when you start to get impatient and begin wondering what the point
is, Tim Robbins literally comes crashing into the movie, and the story
quickly comes into focus.</P>
<P>        How does Robbins fit into the picture?  His wife (Annabella
Sciorra) and Robin Williams work at the same auto show-room.  Robbins is
crazed with the idea that she is having an affair with any or all of the
salesmen so he gets an AK-47, drives his motorcycle through the show-room
window and takes the entire dealership hostage, including Williams and all
of the customers.</P>
<P>        Williams gives a fascinating performance as the fast talking
salesman who must use all of his wheeling and dealing skills to gain
Robbins' trust and talk him into releasing the hostages.  A true team
player, Williams never tries to steal the spotlight from the other actors,
all of whom give zesty performances.  Tim Robbins, in particular, is
dazzling as the manic terrorist who isn't playing with a full deck.
Williams and Robbins reportedly improvised many of their scenes, and it's
exhilarating to see them flying by the seats of their pants as they play
off one another.</P>
<P>        CADILLAC MAN is impossible to pigeon-hole: it's not exactly a drama
and not exactly a comedy.  The movie lies in that grey area somewhere in
between, gracefully mixing humor and drama.  Director Roger Donaldson
extracts ample comic relief from a Chinese restaurant close to the hostage
site, where a rude waitress, deliciously played by Lauren Tom, abuses
customers by telling them what and how much to order.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, CADILLAC MAN sometimes stalls and breaks down; it
could use a major tune up in the editing room.  The movie takes much too
long to get to the hostage crisis, and, even worse, Lori Petty's role as
Williams' fashion conscious girlfriend is virtually irrelevant to the story
line.  Her scenes are unforgivably awkward and unnecessary; they should
have been left on the cutting room floor.</P>
<P>        "The Salesman, The Terrorist, His Wife, and Her Lover" earns extra
brownie points, however, for not being a sequel and for not being a buddy,
police, ghost, or mind-switching movie.  Originality is a rare commodity in
Hollywood; thankfully, CADILLAC MAN has a full tank.</P>
