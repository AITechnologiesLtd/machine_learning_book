<PRE>                               ADDICTED TO LOVE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The idea of a "revenge comedy" naturally appeals to my dark side,
and I've always been a Matthew Broderick fan -- so what could keep me
from getting out to this little film?  Not much.  Not the fact that the
first act feels like it was put together while the writer was under
anesthetic.  Not the fact that the film's editing is better described as
butchery.  Not the fact that Broderick as a hick astronomer is a bit
far-fetched.  Not the fact that Kelly Preston is an unbelievable bore to
watch.</P>
<P>     No, none of this could keep me from laughing at the hysterics of
Broderick and Meg Ryan trying to win back and irrevocably destroy their
respective lovers.  While ADDICTED TO LOVE has more gaping plot holes
than you can shake a stick at, it's still awfully funny when it wants to
be, largely carried on the shoulders of Broderick's natural charm and a
cast of thousands (of roaches).  And Meg Ryan ain't bad, either.</P>
