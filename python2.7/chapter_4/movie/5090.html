<PRE>                                 FAIR GAME
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This is the movie that could single-handedly bring "Mystery 
Science Theater 3000" out of cancellation. It's one of those movies 
that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious, due in no small part to its big 
star, supermodel Cindy Crawford. If you only remember one thing 
about FAIR GAME, it should be that it singlehandedly proves 
Crawford should stick to the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues. If you 
thought Kathy Ireland was laughable in ALIEN FROM L.A., you'll 
change your mind when you see FAIR GAME. Ireland would win 
handfuls of Oscars if this was her only competition.</P>
<P>        In a real casting coup, Crawford plays a super-intelligent 
lawyer (in a jogging bra, of course). We all know this is a stretch, the 
only legal opinion Crawford has ever put forth being that she favors 
the death penalty for anyone who wears white after Labor Day. 
Nonetheless, someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer, but 
we're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two 
showers in a period of twenty minutes. And for you horny teenage boys 
out there, you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the 
dark... Come to think of it, that may have been a body double. Cindy 
Crawford isn't black, is she?</P>
<P>        Like I said, Crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of Russians 
after her. Billy Baldwin (or is it Stephen? Alec? Adam? Kim 
Basinger?) is the police detective who has to save her life, time after 
time, chase after chase, explosion after explosion. There's absolutely 
nothing original about this movie. It's every cop show of the 70's 
mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology-
exploitation movie of the 90's. Three decades of crap all in one place, 
driven further into the ground by Crawford's complete lack of acting 
talent. And it's all completely predictable. You know the mistakes 
Baldwin and Crawford are going to make before they make them, you 
know when the "sexual tension" will finally end up in them 
consummating the relationship, you know when the villains will 
capture Crawford so Baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you 
know the movie's going to suck from the first scene.</P>
<P>        The plot isn't really explained until the end. All we know is 
these Russians have every detail about Crawford in their computer. In 
the words of one of the villains, "We even know what size pantyhose 
she wears." (Yeah, you and every 14-year-old boy in America.) He 
goes on to add, "We know more about her than she does." (_That_ I 
find very easy to believe.) I hope you enjoyed those two sample 
dialogue quotes, because I wrote down plenty of other bad ones 
("If it weren't for me, you'd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in 
Cuba!") because, you see, FAIR GAME is not only a showcase for 
recycled action cliches and terrible acting, but also some seriously bad 
dialogue.</P>
<P>        It all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in 
plenty of places I wasn't supposed to and grimace in places I was 
supposed to laugh. One more thing FAIR GAME has against it is some 
awful comic relief. Would you laugh at a scene where Crawford 
tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like "I'm very 
interested in _hard_ware" and other crap about playing with his 
joystick? I wouldn't, but not because I'm a computer nerd. It's just not 
funny. Crawford's only contribution to the Information Age are a few 
GIF files floating around with her head on a nude Traci Lords' body... 
or was it Jack Lord's body?</P>
<P>        I'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie. The 
boat with all the Russians has just blown up and Baldwin and 
Crawford are floating on a life raft. Crawford says woodenly, "That 
was my client's boat you just blew up. I'm filing a lawsuit against you. 
You're in big trouble," or something to that effect, and Baldwin replies 
smugly, "What do I have to do to get out of it?" They of course begin 
making out and the credits roll. I'm not going to talk about how stupid 
the line is or how, if they'd really wanted to go for a bad closing line 
they would have had Baldwin say, "You think I could settle out of 
court?" but I will tell you that, if anyone ever suggests you watch 
FAIR GAME with him or her, you quote the final line of the movie to 
that person: "What do I have to do to get out of it?"</P>
