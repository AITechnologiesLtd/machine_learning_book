<PRE>INSTINCT
--------------
Review by Alex Ioshpe</PRE>
<PRE>8/10 - Alternative rating B -</PRE>
<P>To make a long story short - "Instinct" is a modern Tarzan-story with a dose
of social critisism. Dr. Ethan Powell ( Anthony Hopkins ) has suddenly been
found and imprisoned for killing two African guards after he disappeared two
years ago.</P>
<P>He has not spoken a single word since he has been found and he has become
distant and violent. Powell is then transferred to a special prison in the
U.S, where helpless lunatics are beaten and discriminated by the prison
guards.</P>
<P>Here is where Dr. Theo Calder ( Cuba Gooding, Jr. ) steps in. He is a young
and so far successful psychiatrist whose task is to write an evaluation on
Powell to determine why a brilliant scientist has suddenly become insane and
isolated himself from his family and the rest of the world. Later Theo finds
out that Powell has been living with wild gorillas for two years, instead of
studding them and has somehow made a connection; became a member of the
family. He has seen how the Africans killed the gorillas, how they pillaged
and destroyed. That  is why his violent behavior is to some point justified
by mankind's "rape of the world". Slowly when Theo is venturing deep into
Powell's mind, we get to witness his journey from the beginning. The African
jungle is here displayed as a peaceful eden - a paradise slowly transformed
into hell.</P>
<P>And here is the beautiful part of the film, it is also by the way the most
serious part -</P>
<P>Powell dreams of a world where we kill only as much as we can eat, where we
live like we have lived 10 000 years ago, in harmony with the nature instead
of in "control" of it.</P>
<P>The script is serious, solid and well written, exploring the true nature of
man, as well as our social and family mentality. The casting is likewise
solid, but there are specially Hopkins'and Gooding's performances that are
worth noticing. Stan Winston's computerized gorillas are incredibly
realistic and Danny Elfman's score, although not great, is at times
effective.  So it's actually nothing bad to say about "Instinct".</P>
<P>However, instead of venturing deeper into the lost instincts and explore the
true nature of man, Jon Turteltaub is concentrating his energy on the
difficult conditions in the prison and Theo's romance with Powell's daughter
(which by the way fails to capture my attention or emotions). The film's
lack of  focus is a bit disturbing. Another very important thing to notice
is that it never answers the question: "What is it we should do?", "Should
we throw our clothes off and return to the jungle, like Powell?" or should
we all become vegetarians? My point is that "Instinct" showed us how we are
like from nature's point of view - greedy, violent and stupid, sawing the
branch we're sitting on. But it is never said what we should do about it.
The important questions are asked, but never answered. Some of you may say
that everyone should figure this one out for themselves. Maybe so, but I
feel that after asking these important questions it's equally important to
answer them. It's like the director was not sure himself and found the easy
way out. However the film's many good moments, such as Powell's explanation
of control, and solid acting saves the film. It's not a bad movie and it's
not a masterpiece. It will not get any important nominations at the Oscar's,
but it's a well made film with a serious and important subject worth
thinking and making films about.</P>
