<PRE>                            WHEN WE WERE KINGS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If ever a film deserved the commendation of "It packs a powerful
punch," this documentary about the great heavyweight champion Muhammad
Ali (nee Cassius Clay) is it.   This is one great film.  Well-told,
dramatic, exciting and with wonderful picturesque descriptions by such
knowledgeable celebrities as Spike Lee,  George Plimpton.and
especially. Norman Mailer.  Mailer's description of what is going on in
the ring is a classic and should be carved in stone.</P>
<P>     Except peripherally, the film does not cover much of Ali's early
life; the focus  here being  the "Rumble In The Jungle" of Africa in
1974 when Ali, believed to be over the hill at age 32, had signed to
fight the most formidable fighter of his day, George ForEman. The two
had been brought together in Africa to let the black Africans see their
heroes in action and Ali gave them that and more amid shouts of "ALI!
ALI!"</P>
<P>     Having lived through the years when Ali was in his prime, I should
have known more about him . . . but did not.   I had seen him on TV
talk shows  but this film was a revelation for me.    It made me check
out more about his life, learning that when he refused to register for
our ill-conceived (to say the least) Viet Nam War, he gave as his
reason "No Vietnamese ever called me "nigger.'"   That really tells it
all.  That really shows the strength in the man.   For standing up
tall, his title was taken away.</P>
<P>     Ali was handsome, had a boyish smile, had wit and charm . . . all
revealed in the film.   His battle with Forman, why it was fought, what
others thought about his taking on the champ, are all brilliantly
shown.  Do not tell me you do not like documentaries.  This one is a
must-see!   You've heard of "edge of the seat movies?"  This one will
pull the seat right out from under you.    Go, man, go!</P>
