<P>Traditionally, the last two weeks of August and first two weeks of 
September spell nothing but bad news for filmgoers. The studios view the 
period as a cinematic Bermuda Triangle, a place to dump those movies too 
flimsy to compete in the crowded summer marketplace and too weak to have 
a prayer in the autumn Oscar marathon. For critics, reviewing these 
flicks is a daunting experience because, after three months of writing 
about dreck like "Wild Wild West" and "Inspector Gadget," most of us have 
run out of insults. So when a nice little offering like "Outside 
Providence" comes along, I feel particularly grateful. </P>
<P>While the TV ads trumpet the film as a "non-stop laugh-fest from the 
creators of 'Dumb and Dumber,' 'Kingpin' and 'There's Something About 
Mary,'" "Outside Providence" actually contains as much drama as comedy. 
The Farrelly brothers brand of humor is present, but the jokes are 
incorporated into a surprisingly effective coming-of-age story.</P>
<P>Set in the blue-collar town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1974, the movie 
follows young Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), an aimless high school 
stoner living with his wheelchair-bound kid brother (Tommy Bone) and 
surly father (Alec Baldwin). When not lingering at the grave of his 
mother or enduring the insults of his dad (whose nickname for his son is 
"Dildo"), Tim spends his time smoking dope with his friends, until one 
fateful night when he has a run-in with the law. Literally.</P>
<P>The kid is spared a jail sentence when Pop pulls some strings and packs 
the boy off to spend his senior year two and a half hours away at the 
Cornwall Prep School. Initially, Tim seems hopelessly lost in this 
cultured environment, but he soon finds that the alien setting offers 
many new possibilities, including the prospect of romance. </P>
<P>Plotwise, there's nothing in "Outside Providence" we haven't encountered 
countless times before, but the screenplay navigates adroitly through the 
various clichéd situations. In fact, many of the film's rewards come from 
what doesn't happen. A frail kid confronts a bully and, instead of a 
fight or chase scene, they quietly make peace with each other. A student 
feuds with an authority figure and, instead of building to some 
outlandish public confrontation, their relationship ends on a realistic 
note. A man faces an angry reaction from his buddies when he reveals that 
he's gay and, instead of a melodramatic make-up scene, we simply see the 
guys playing cards together again later, having come to terms with his 
revelation off-screen. </P>
<P>More than anything else, "Outside Providence" is about growth and 
reconciliation, and the film feels far more touching and real than what 
one would expect for a work associated with the Farrelly brothers.</P>
<P>A great part of the authenticity comes from director Michael Corrente 
("Federal Hill," "American Buffalo"), who picked up Peter Farrelly's 
gritty 1988 comic novel for a buck in a used bookstore. Corrente found 
the book hilarious and saw in it the potential for something more than a 
standard teen comedy. He inserted his own dramatic sensibilities into the 
story, along with several images from his childhood, including a tender 
scene of Old Man Dunphy teaching Tim how to fasten his tie. Corrente also 
took a treasured memory of his parents playfully shooting Christmas tree 
bulbs with a "Rifleman" gun and reworked it into a poignant flashback 
sequence.   </P>
<P>Too often, actors playing working-class folks come off like they're 
slumming, but not here. Shawn Hatosy, the fresh-faced kid with the 
crooked teeth from "In and Out" and "The Faculty," hits just the right 
notes as Tim Dunphy. From his early scenes as a clueless druggie to the 
latter portion of the film, when he begins the rough journey towards 
manhood, Hatosy subtly works expression and inflection to make his 
character ring true. </P>
<P>Alec Baldwin gives one of the best performances of his career as Old Man 
Dunphy, an emotionally stunted man who buries his pain beneath a stream 
of "good-natured" wisecracks. Baldwin expertly shades his portrayal of 
the damaged father, using his eyes to show the love for his sons that 
lies beneath Dunphy's crude and rude exterior.      </P>
<P>The supporting players are also good, with the exception of Tim Crowe, 
who overacts as dorm-master Mr. Funderburk, making him nasty almost to 
the point of being cartoonish. </P>
<P>Stylistically, Corrente proves adept at mixing the Farrelly-style comic 
bits with the dramatic text. He also nicely contrasts the Pawtucket and 
Cornwall settings, using a grainier film stock for the hometown scenes. 
Although the film is packed with '70s hits, Corrente wisely keeps the era 
in the background, maintaining an appropriate perspective on the retro-
kitsch. </P>
<P>The Farrelly brother's name could hurt "Outside Providence" more than it 
helps it. Those expecting a barrage of "There's Something About Mary" 
style gross-out gags may feel let down, while those who would appreciate 
the bittersweet coming-of-age story may very well avoid the film because 
of the Farrelly trademark. Hopefully, in the sea of early September 
mediocrity, this funny, sad, sweet little film will find the audience it 
deserves.</P>
