<P>   They say that the Communist Party of the United States is
made up today of 10,000 members, half of whom are FBI
agents.  Now, 10,000 out of a population of 270,000,000
wouldn't make much of a dent in this nation's political box
office, especially since of the legitimate members, most are
said to be little old ladies in tennis sneakers.</P>
<P>   Things were different during the Depression.  Not that
Communism appealed even then to that many workers,
employed or otherwise.  But the ideology did cut some ice
with urban intellectuals, which is not surprising considering
that radicals often come from that class--think Robespierre,
Danton, Franz Fanon, even Karl Marx himself.  </P>
<P>   In a most satisfying documentary produced by its writer-
director, Joseph Dorman captures the flavor of the 1930s
radicals by examining the lives of four of their major
spokespersons, all New Yorkers of professorial bent, all
members of the Jewish faith.  Three are alive today; one has
recently died.  All are articulate about their beliefs and appear
to have strong memories of those perfervid years which are
not at all gone forever, as the three living subjects are still
furiously writing today.  The dramatis personae are Irving
Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell and Irving Howe.  All came
up from poverty, all went to the then-free City College in New
York.  Nowadays they and their acolytes would be considered
members of the Old Left, their ideas having been picked up
and thoroughly changed by organizations of the 1960s and
70s like Students for a Democratic Society: the New Left. 
One of these men, Irving Kristol, did a 180 degree turnaround
and became a conservative.  Nathan Glazer, author of
groundbreaking texts in the field of sociology, became a
moderate, as did Daniel Bell.  Irving Howe did not change his
beliefs all that much, remaining until his recent passing a
leader of the American socialist movement.</P>
<P>   Dorman's film, which is aptly edited by Jonathan
Oppenheim, spends a good deal of time in the present,
dominated by the recent views of the four who sit in their easy
chairs discussing their lives.  The interviews, which are
topically organized as camera person Peter Browscombe
switches his lens from one spokesman to another as each
subject is considered, are laced with flashbacks to black-and-
white snapshots and motion picture clips of demonstrations
from the thirties.  Occasionally we witness scenes from the
fifties, as the treacherous Senator Joseph McCarthy, looking
every bit the malicious and power-seeking politician, grills
those accused of membership in the American Communist
Party--many of whom invoke the Fifth Amendment as a
defense against self-incrimination.</P>
<P>   The strongest point made by the film is that most of these
leftist protesters quit the party and became anti-Communist
when they heard the remarkable news that their idol, Soviet
leader Josef Stalin, did not turn out to be a Slavic Mother
Teresa but was instead a paranoid, totalitarian despot who
put thousands of innocents on trial and somehow got them to
confess to preposterous charges of treason.  Stalin's signing
a non-aggression pact with Communism's arch-enemy,
Adolph Hitler, did not help the cause.</P>
<P>   "Arguing the World" is hardly for everyone.  It is, after all, a
documentary, a genre which does not exactly attract the
"Jurassic Park" crowd.  Even within that category, it focuses
on men from academia, founders of highbrow periodicals like
The Partisan Review, not a favorite subject of masses of
Americans--many of whom probably hated school.</P>
<P>   For its target audience, though, "Arguing the World" is a
splendid look at four American geniuses, in large part
answering the query: Why are so many intellectuals attracted
to left-leaning politics?   Not Rated.  Running time: 106
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
