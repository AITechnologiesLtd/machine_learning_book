<PRE>DR. T AND THE WOMEN
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>        So it's better than "Ready to Wear" ("Prêt-à-Porter"), but that's
about the kindest thing one can say about "Dr. T and the Women," the latest
film by director Robert Altman, an over-cast and overextended project which
meanders and sallies for near-on two unfocused hours without really getting
anywhere.  Richard Gere stars as Dr. Sullivan Travis aka Dr. T, a
successful Texan gynecologist whose waiting room runneth over with the
finest fillies Dallas has to offer, lots of hot flushed gals with big
bouffants and lots of lacquer jostling for position in his fur-lined
stirrups.  In an all-time male fantasy quickly done in by an 80-year-old
with a yeast infection, the good doctor prods, probes, and pap smears his
way from nine to five yet remains strangely unfulfilled.  His cheerleading
daughter Dee Dee ("Almost Famous"' Kate Hudson) is about to check in to the
honorable estate of marriage while his loopy wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett)
checks into the local sanitarium.  Dr. T needs something new in his life;
something fresh.  Enter Bree, a golf pro played by Helen Hunt.  "You're not
like any woman I've ever met," he tells her to her face.  And if a
gynecologist tells you there are no two alike then you have to believe
there are no two alike.  With a screenplay by Anne Rapp (who penned
Altman's previous film, the over-cast and overextended "Cookie's Fortune"),
"Dr. T and the Women" follows pretty much the same path--a lot of talent
drowning under Lyle Lovett's Texas twangs.  Any film which opens with an
implicit pelvic exam and closes with an explicit live birth is trying to
say something, but the stuff in the middle, alas, doesn't amount to much of
anything.</P>
