<PRE>                             THE LITTLE RASCALS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Way back in 1922, Hal Roach who had produced Laurel and Hardy and
Harold Lloyd silent comedies, came up with a comedic look at the
innocent adventures of children.  There existed at the time shorts with
child actors and with the movies designed for a young audience.  Roach,
on the other hand, aimed at both young and adults when he started his
series (originally called Hal Roach's Rascals).</P>
<P>     Roach employed unknowns in order to get spontaneity and naivete.
Child actors such as Shirley Temple were not even considered ... and
Mickey Rooney flunked his audition.  From the beginning the series was
a great success.  The question before the House is: what about this
1994 version?</P>
<P>     Director Penelope Spheeris had a great group of kids to work with,
many of whom looked very much like the original "gang," right down
through Petey, the dog with the black ring around one eye.  The problem
may be that this latest version is too cutesy.  Little Darla, for
example, who looks very much like the original, is made to act too
adult.  The action is for the kids in the audience while the gags are
for their parents.</P>
<P>     Despite the elements being there, the film is only mildly
amusing.  Although most of the new kids look very much like the
originals, it may be that imitation has its limitations.</P>
