<PRE>[video] "Lair of the White Worm"
A Postview, copyright 1997 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>In this adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel, a group of proper
English types with room-temperature IQs are mystified by a local
outbreak of vampirism, in between dream sequences that indulge
the director's fetishes.</P>
<P>Alexei Sayle once listed the basic mysteries of the
universe, concluding with "And why do people keep giving Ken
Russell money to make films?"  After this, you'll be wondering
why too.  His previous "Gothic" covered similar territory with at
least some skill.  In comparison, "Lair" takes a deep breath and
dive-bombs straight into Bad Movie Hell.</P>
<P>Gathering together everyone on the books with a regional
accent, we are introduced to the picturesque English countryside
and a village, seemingly with a population of about six.  Our
four leads gambol and frolic in a manner not unlike Enid Blyton's
"Famous Five".  Julian Sands having passed on this film, we
instead have Hugh Grant as dashing RAF pilot Lord James D'Ampton
(really), looking as if he was sedated.  (I envy him.)  The
neglected Peter Capaldi as a geek archaeologist gets to muse over
a giant snake skull he has dug up, his acres of curly hair
threatening to dominate every scene he is in.  Catherine Oxenburg
and Sammi Davis, their romantic interests, flit about until such
a point as they can be captured by the bad guys.  Just over on
the next set, the slinky Lady Sylvia Marsh (Amanda Donohoe, she
of the Acting Career That Would Not Die) chews scenery, stopping
only to slaughter the occasional anorak-wearing nerd.</P>
<P>But this is a Ken Russell film, it's been 20 minutes and there
haven't been any naked nuns yet!  Wheel them on!  Before you can
say "a clear need for Freudian analysis" there's a dream sequence
in which naked nuns are being raped by brutal centurions as a
gloomy Christ looks on, restrained by a large latex worm.</P>
<PRE>Why?</PRE>
<P>Tiring of jaunting about in sports cars, sipping apertifs
and competitive under-acting, Grant and Capaldi decide that
something is amiss.  (Although they wrongly conclude that it is
Lady Sylvia and not the director.)  Grant misses the obvious plan
(invite the Lady Sylvia into his car down on the main road, get
arrested and soon everyone will know what's going on) and
basically wanders about in Lady Sylvia's gothic mansion for the
rest of the picture.  Capaldi is attacked by a snake-policeman
and defends himself by charming the snake with music.  (Or maybe
it's an intense dislike of bagpipes.  Capaldi in a kilt with
bagpipes is a frightening thing.)  Soon Donohoe sheds her
clothes, paints herself blue and is threatening the girls with a
massive strap-on (and a role in the sequel).  But Capaldi has
protected himself with snake anti-serum ("Where's the acting
anti-serum?")  and Donohoe is engulfed by a giant bendy snake.</P>
<P>There are some more naked nuns in there somewhere, but it's
all become a blur to me.</P>
<P>Appalling.  [*/misfire] and "Cannibal Apocalypse" on the Sid
and Nancy scale.</P>
