<PRE>PROOF OF LIFE</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Warner Bros./Castle Rock Entertainment
 Director: Taylor Hackford
 Writer:  Tony Gilroy
 Cast: David Morse, Meg Ryan, Russell crowe, David Caruso</PRE>
<P>   Lest you think the picture might be called "Woof of Life,"
this film--which takes place on the roof of life high in the
Ecuadorian Andes--is far from a dog.  But think of what
Costa-
Gavras could have done with the K&R (kidnap and ransom)
theme!  Slashing Tony Gilroy's script, which thoroughly
demonizes the South American terrorists by making them
virtually faceless and with only the slightest nuance of real
emotional feeling, Costa-Gavras would have given at least
equal time to the hardy mountaineers who live all-year-round
amid a gorgeous panorama  but without the use of toilets,
showers or L.L. Bean catalogues.  What really drives them,
and do they all think alike?  Imagine as well what Martin
Scorsese could have done with the smoldering romance
between a miscast Meg Ryan and the sexy Russell Crowe! 
In "The Age of Innocence," Scorsese successfully employs
Michele Pfeiffer as an unconsummated diversion for Daniel
Day-Lewis--bound to marry the socially equal but (to him)
unappealing Winona Ryder.  This we could believe.</P>
<P>   "Proof of Life" is apportioned into two motifs: one is the
struggle of Terry Thorne (Russell Crowe) to work out a
ransom payment with a troupe of E.L.T. terrorists (patterned
perhaps by Peru's Marxist Sendero Luminoso guerrillas), who
have captured a man who works for an oil company, Peter
Bowman (David Morse).  Thorne is salaried by a large British
insurance company that guarantees executives the ransom
money should they be kidnapped.  The company uses
Thorne throughout the world's hotspots to negotiate the
exorbitant demands of abductors from outrageous initial sums
like six million dollars down to more reasonable six-figure
payoffs.  He is not asked to liberate the captives.  He merely
dickers with the abductors and delivers the cash.  The other
motif is Thorne's simmering liaison with Alice Bowman, the
victim's wife, who, together with the quarry's sister Janis
Goodman (Pamela Reed), is eager to gain Peter's release. At
least at first, that is. Given the obvious physical attraction of
Terry and Bowman--who have met with each other for a
period of over three months while the ransom is negotiated,
"Proof of Life" gains points by allowing the audience to
wonder whether they will throw the desperate Peter to the
wolves and take off together into the sunset.  To up the ante,
director Taylor Hackford captures a tumultuous scene that
could have come from Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf."  Before the abduction, Alice and Peter are
having a virtual knock- down, drag-out squabble, with Alice
insisting that they leave the (fictionally named) country of
Tecala in South America and return home to Dallas while
idealistic Peter contends that by building a dam, he is doing
considerable good for the population and must remain where
he is for a while longer.</P>
<P>    While Slawomir Idzak's camera captures all the
resplendent beauty of the stunning mountain ranges, land
wide enough to keep the guerrillas hidden from the
government for years, only a couple of scenes exploit the
dangers of traversing the slopes.  In one dramatic spectacle,
Eric Kessler (Gottfried John), a Bible-toting French missionary
who is tolerated by the guerrilla band by pretending that he is
insane, makes a grand leap that would be the envy of the
nightly divers at Acapulco's La Quebrada.  In another, Peter
is sent from one peak to another in a flimsy, would-be
funicular like a fluttering bed sheet whipped across a roped
trail by a sudden 100 mph gust.</P>
<P>   The action scenes are strictly by the numbers, starting with
a James Bond-like opening that displays the muscular Terry
Thorne delivering cash to desperate Chechen kidnappers
who must raise money to continue their battle for
independence against the Russian government.  The final
shootout involving the mowing down of abductors is not
without a few thrills, but there's nothing there that we haven't
seen in any video-games parlor.  Pamela Reed's Janis
Goodman is obviously a strong, independent woman of some
means but is reduced here to a wimpering, simpering
housefrau as dependent as the likewise weeply Alice
Bowman on the big strong savior.  And the armed band of
revolutionaries are shown as an undisciplined group of
cartoonish bandidos who have lost all awareness of their
political program and are simply in the business of making
money through a trade in cocaine.</P>
<P>   David Caruso turns in an appealing role as Dino, Terry's
competitor in the insurance negotiation business who lines up
behind him in a rescue effort. Russell Crowe is dependently
strong, taking moments out from time to time simply to
ponder his options as he did in the role of Ridley Scott's
eponymous Gladiator.  Though the film includes a few
product placements such as a Hertz rental station and a
passenger aircraft of British Airways, the real commercial is
for Ecuadorian tourism.  Who needs to get seasick gaping at
the turtles of Galapagos when you can ascend from the
colonial, cobble-stoned streets of Quito to the smashing
heights of the Ecuadorian Andes?  </P>
