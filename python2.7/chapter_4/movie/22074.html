<PRE>TOPSY-TURVY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Perform without benefit of a corset?  Scandalous!</P>
<P>For the latest Gilbert and Sullivan opera, the actors and actresses have
been firmly instructed not to wear their corsets.  None of them have
ever gone on stage without a corset before, so pandemonium has set in.</P>
<P>TOPSY-TURVY, an homage to the business of show business and to Gilbert
and Sullivan operas, is a surprising work by writer/director Mike Leigh,
an intense filmmaker best known for edgy dramas like NAKED and SECRETS
AND LIES.  Set in London in 1884, TOPSY-TURVY takes us backstage as
Gilbert and Sullivan work on perhaps their best known operetta, "The
Mikado."</P>
<P>As William Schwenk Gilbert, Jim Broadbent gives an endearing performance
as a successful and driven man who resented the critics and his being
the lesser talent of the Gilbert and Sullivan team.  Critics would
predict great success for their works and then go on to ridicule their
artistic abilities.  Gilbert was referred to in one review as "the King
of Topsy-Turvydom," which wounded his pride deeply.</P>
<P>In a lesser performance, Allan Corduner plays Arthur Sullivan as
somewhat of an enigma.  "You're a genius," Gilbert says to Sullivan.  "I
merely bask in your reflecting glory."  But Corduner gives us little
appreciation of Sullivan's actual gifts.  That he had higher aspirations
than Gilbert is made apparent but little more.</P>
<P>The film's momentum suffers greatly from Leigh's proclivity to include
such extraneous material as dentist visits and to let some scenes run on
for what seems an eternity.  If you don't like Gilbert and Sullivan
operas, imagine how painful having long passages read aloud will be.</P>
<P>All the picture's production sins, and they are many, are eventually
redeemed as you become part of the show.  By the end you'll feel like
you've signed on to sing in the chorus.  And when there's a revolt on
stage to come to the aid of a member of the company, you'll want to join
the protest.</P>
<P>Filmed by Dick Pope in garish colors, the movie makes Gilbert and
Sullivan's style of comedic opera look attractive and funny.  The opera
as kitsch was something that Gilbert himself was unclear about.  He
describes "The Mikado" as "not grand opera but low burlesque."  But soon
afterwards, he says, "This is not low burlesque.  This is an entirely
new Japanese opera."  Whatever it was, he certainly poured his heart and
soul into it.  Yet, he wasn't happy.  In depression after the opera's
triumph, he laments to his wife, "there's something inherently
disappointing about success."</P>
<P>Among the film's small delights are Leigh's fascination with the
scientific instruments of the time and their effect on the operation of
an opera company.  From the telephone to the "reservoir pen" to the
special effects, each contributes in it's own way to the opera's
production.  Even cryptography has its place when competing companies
need to keep their box office revenues secret from snooping telephone
operators.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, can make up for the fact that the movie is a full hour
too long.  Films like this almost make you wish for a dastardly studio
executive to seize the print and cut it down to the proper size.  Movie
after movie this holiday season feels as bloated as a diner after a big
Christmas dinner.  Even with its excesses, however, TOPSY-TURVY is a
good-spirited and intriguing behind-the-scenes look at a stage
production and is worth seeing.</P>
<P>TOPSY-TURVY runs 2:40.  It is rated R for a scene of risqué nudity and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
