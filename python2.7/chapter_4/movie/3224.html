<P>     NOBODY'S FOOL is about as sublime a motion picture as is likely to 
come out of Hollywood.  With a structure that contravenes the norm, this 
film concentrates on character first, letting the plot fall naturally 
into place.  Situations are forced on neither the film's inhabitants nor 
on those in the audience.  It's rare to sit through a drama and not feel 
manipulated, but the feelings generated by Robert Benton's movie are 
entirely natural, and likely to bring a smile to the heart.</P>
<P>     In another Academy Award-worthy performance, Paul Newman gives an 
unforgettable portrayal of Donald Sullivan (or Sully, as most people know 
him), a cantankerous aging man living in the small, snowbound town of 
North Bath, New York.  With the spirit of a mischievous teenager but the 
body of a sixty year old, Sully has the kind of infectious presence that, 
in his own words, "grows on you."  He delights in flirting with women 
half his age, and engages in a game of theft where he and his sometimes-
boss Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis) take turns devising creative means by 
which to steal a snow blower from one another.</P>
<P>     NOBODY'S FOOL is as much about regrets as about choices made; as 
much about the road not taken as the one traveled.  It's about families 
broken apart, and parent/child relationships mended.  Sully's father was 
a ruthless, violent drunk whom he never forgave, and that is perhaps why 
he was such a poor father to his own son Peter (Dylan Walsh).  When the 
boy was just one year old, Sully walked out on him and his mother.  Now, 
decades later, the abandoning father is trying to make amends--not only 
to his son, but to his grandchildren as well.</P>
<P>     For those seeking a film with an unforgettable central character, 
NOBODYS FOOL is not to be missed.  Not only does it offer the best in 
easygoing, unconfrontational drama, but the story is told with a sense of 
wry, intelligent humor.  In fact, the movie is so perfectly attuned to 
its audience that it can display Melanie Griffith's breasts without the 
moment's self-consciousness that so often accompanies nudity in American 
motion pictures.</P>
<P>     Speaking of Griffith, this is the best acting she has done in a long 
time.  After a string of lackluster comedies (the last one of which was 
MILK MONEY) and ineffective thrillers (SHINING THROUGH, A STRANGER AMONG 
US), NOBODY'S FOOL offers a role for which she is  suited.  Playing the 
dowdy wife of a perpetual womanizer, she finds the right mixture of 
strength and pathos.  </P>
<P>     Also holding his own is Bruce Willis, here in his second consecutive 
solid performance (on the heels of PULP FICTION). Jessica Tandy, to whom 
the film is dedicated, is as effective as ever.  Of course, no one can 
quite match Newman, who shows a chameleon-like ability to shed his star 
image and don a most atypical personality.  This is the sort of part 
normally  associated with a character actor of Albert Finney's status.  </P>
<P>     Quiet and enchanting in its simplicity, NOBODY'S FOOL is a joy.  
Admittedly, it meanders a bit, but that's part of its charm. The 
intelligent sensitivity of the script, coupled with Newman's powerfully 
understated performance, make this motion picture special.  There aren't 
many of them like this out there.</P>
