<PRE>FALLEN (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Fallen is a crash of genres. It takes a detective/sleuth genre and smashes
it together with a thriller/supernatural genre. Typically, smashing genres
together, especially such different genres, doesn't work really well. How
well does it work with Fallen?</P>
<P>The movie starts off with the calm voice of Detective Hobbes (Denzel
Washington) recounting a story for us, "I want to tell you about the time I
almost died." And from here we are transported back in time to the start of
the events that Hobbes is referring to.
Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) is about to go to the gas chamber. But, before
he does, he gets a visit from the detective that caught him and sent him to
the chamber, Detective John Hobbes. As Reese is sent off to the gas
chamber, he starts to sing a song, that is used very well throughout the
film, "Time is on my side…"</P>
<P>What happens next is the supernatural part, it seems that Reese was the
embodiment of a fallen angel, Azazel. Now that Reese has been gassed to
death, he's pretty angry and wants to get some payback. It seems that
Azazel travels from body to body via touch. Azazel doesn't want to kill
Hobbes right away, he wants to play with Hobbes and ruin his life first.</P>
<P>Hobbes is quickly alerted to Azazel's presence, by Azazel in different
people. But, Hobbes is confused to how -- as he believes -- Reese is doing
what he's doing, since he believes that Reese is dead. For Hobbes and his
partner Jonesy (John Goodman) the problem is to find out what is happening
and how it is happening. In his detective work, Hobbes runs into Gretta
Milano, the daughter of a cop who killed himself 30 some years ago. There
is a link between Milano's dad and what is happening to Hobbes. She tells
Hobbes about Azazel and helps him out.</P>
<P>Fallen is a well-written film by Nicolas Kazan. It does well with the
mixing of the genres and plays somewhat like a longer episode of The
known -- Primal Fear, does an excellent job of bringing the audience into
the film without a sudden onslaught of supernaturalism. Hoblit is able to
ease us slowly into the supernatural portion of the film because the script
has Hobbes as an unbeliever and the audience is slowly brought to the point
of suspension of disbelief as we follow Hobbes' own trip into the
supernatural. The film itself looks beautiful with its washed out colors
and high contrast cinematography. Kudos to cinematographer Tom Sigel. The
film looks almost like a David Fincher film -- it would have been fun to
see how the film would have turned out if Fincher had directed it.</P>
<P>Look for Elias Koteas' eerie performance as Reese early on in the film. He
is convincingly creepy as a serial killer taken over by a demon.
Washington, like always, is great onscreen. He has a commanding onscreen
presence. And though John Goodman has a supporting role, he takes the role
all the way and is a joy to see onscreen.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is a chase sequence in the middle of the film between
Azazel and Gretta that is pretty exciting and will cause you to scoot to
the edge of your seat. This chase sequence is ingenious and if I say
anything more, it'll spoil the chase for you.</P>
<P>The end of the film has a big twist and for me it was a well-deserved
twist, but I'm afraid that it is so big that some audience members might be
disappointed. Kudos to Hoblit for keeping such a twist in the film.</P>
<P>The music by Tan Dun is strange, creepy, and works really well with the
film. The score is filled with high strings and is somewhat hard to
describe, but it does work really well.</P>
<P>The only thing that bothered me about the film was its running time. It
doesn't excessively run too long, but it does feel a bit on the long side.
The film could have benefited from a few cuts to tighten it up. But, this
is not a big deal.</P>
<P>Fallen works very well as a film that smashes two very different genres
together. The last film that did this was Devil's Advocate. Though Devil's
Advocate works a bit better than Fallen, Fallen is a great film to spend
two hours with. If you have time, catch Fallen in the theatres. If not,
catch it on video.</P>
