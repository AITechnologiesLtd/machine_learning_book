<P>Good news: Woody Allen's back. Despite an embarassingly humble release
pattern, here in the capital, Allen's new film Deconstructing Harry is
one of the best of the year. It chronicles life history, more or less,
of a New York novelist of jewish origin. This description is unfairly
simple, however, since ultimately this loose story serves only as a
premise for Allen to launch a savage social critique, backed by deft
casting and narrative technique. The film has been characterised as
everything from 'irresponsibly sexist' to 'embarassingly
revealing'. This is perhaps hardly surprising in view of the
technocratic lynching Allen received in the media several years ago.
Ironically, many of these reviewers are in fact indulging the very
vices that Allen critiques through his protagonist. It is to his credt
that despite this he has managed to pull off a film as inspired as
this. (Ottawa dwellers be advised of the upcoming screening of
Manhattan at the Bytowne.)</P>
<P>    Allen takes no prisonners as he lampoons every facet of
conventional life and those naive, bored or lazy enough to still
practice it. The jewish faith, and by extension, institutionalized
religion, is treated with characetristic duality (Love and Death),
sexuality is twisted into an eerie grotesque (Manhattan) and Allem's
wit is razour sharp. Not the gimmicks and tricks that littered Mighty
Aphrodite or Everyone says I Love You. The film is exemplary of the
bizarre experiences Allen's best films put us through: to laugh while
recognizing how pathetic the goings-on are. And no-one is more
pathetic here than Allen's protagonist. A man so incapbable of
spending time in the real world, he has been left no alternative but
to create his own.</P>
<P>    The film benefits from truly inspired casting. The film is
structured such that for most of the people present in Harry's real
life there is another set of actors that play the fictional
recreations of these people as present in Harry's books. The pairings
could be the subject of a review in and of themselves.  Examples of
people/character pairings include: Kristie Alley/Demi Moore and Judy
Davis/Julia Louis Dreyfus. The considerations that emerge from these
pairings are two-fold, exploring both the unreliability of perception
and by extension the artistic process as well as alluding to the
fallacy and duplicity inherent in the star system. (Perhaps that last
one is my own zeal getting the better of me) Nonetheless Allen seems
to have payed careful attention to every casting decision. Even Robin
Williams apearrance as an actor in one of Harry's fictional stories,
although it lasts only several minutes, is elevated to a level above
that of a simple cameo. A lesser filmmaker would have treated the
appearance in a purly cursory manner, Allen instead seems to be
suggesting that the casting is to be scrutinized in detail.</P>
<P>    One of the most notable aspects of the film, is its narrative
construction. Deconstructing Harry is narrated with a flashback
structure that consists of three planes. The first is Harry's present
day life with all of its dilemmas and complications, the second is the
fictional world of Harry's books, and the last is Harry's true past
that is dealt with on occasion to contrast with the fictional world
that we are presented with. Which of these is which is only made clear
as the film progresses.  The associations that emerge as a result of
the interacting of these three planes are a primary source of meaning
generation in the film.  It is only as the fictitious and the
non-fictitious is delineated that the relevance of certain scenes
becomes clear. Harry turning 'soft' is an amusing gimmick on it's own,
however, situated as it is after the actor-story and late in the film
it is an eleagant device reaffirming the inescapable fate of the
protagonist: to forever be confounded by the very fiction he seeks
therapy with.</P>
<P>    On this basis, an attractive reading of the film-although it is
impossible to confirm or refute it- is as an allegory for the current
state of Americain independant filmmaking. As filmmaker after
filmmaker lines up with their low budget, flawed assumptions and
'genuine story', there are eerie parallels to be drawn with the flawed
ethic displayed by Allen's protagonist.</P>
