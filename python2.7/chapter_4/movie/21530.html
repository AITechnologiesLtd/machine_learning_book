"Man vs. Everything: A bold dig into the sexuality, fears and
emasculation of modern man"</PRE>
<PRE>by Tim Clifton</PRE>
<P>"Fight Club" is, by and large, an effective film that surrealistically
describes the status of the American male at the end of the 20th
century: disenchanted, unfulfilled, castrated and looking for a way
out. At times equally exhilarating, insightful, funny and inscrutable,
"Fight Club" has enough ideas for five films and story lines for
three, pushing well beyond two hours in length and exhausting the
audience's attention span in the process. In a season where many films
have modest and predictable goals, "Fight Club" is a wild smorgasbord.</P>
<P>The beginning of the film is pitch perfect, chronicling the
desperation and despair of modern living in a society where comfort is
the measure of success.  It's the ultimate visual statement of the
question: Are you working for your car or is your car working for you?
A consumer society that emasculates men.  No rite of passage into
manhood, no lion or bear to kill. In an era where men do not have
missions, in the urban wilderness, what is there to hunt? To dominate?
To kill?</P>
<P>To its credit, "Fight Club" has pace, it builds up to its violent
scenes and at times offers an amusing and pathetic portrait of a
nebbish loner, Edward Norton ("Primal Fear", "American History X"),
unnamed at the beginning of the film, aside from the pseudonyms he
uses as he trolls for emotional connection by attending every support
group he can find. But for the most part he is sleepwalking through
life, sad with dark circled eyes, thinking that his life will be
complete once he buys all his IKEA furniture. He becomes a support
group junkie because it's the only way he can relate and have contact
with people, and discovers that his "power animal", in one hilarious
visualization scene, is a penguin. By chance he meets Tyler Durden,
played by Brad Pitt ("Legends of the Fall", "Seven"), who appears to
have it all in the manhood department: he is, literally as we find
out, everything that Edward Norton's character is not. He admires the
freedom of Durden, a man's man, independent and self assured, who's
not ashamed of his desires and wants.</P>
<P>Durden doesn't own anything, and makes his living by raiding
liposuction disposal units, his primary ingredient to make soap that
he sells to upscale department stores, in other words, he is the urban
equivalent of a hunter gatherer, using the system so that he can live
by his own rules. Durden makes you think that he's just a couple of
negative life experiences away from the serial killer Pitt played in
"Kalifornia."</P>
<P>Together, they establish a fight club for men, as an underground way
to express rage and live on the edge, to feel alive by approaching
death. Durden beds Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman Norton
accosted in his exploratory support group encounters. And this is
where we get the first hint that Durden is pure, undiluted id unbound,
and sets up what we eventually discover: that both Pitt and Norton are
Tyler Durden, the intellect and the id fractionated, dissociated from
each other. The fact that they live in a decaying house but in
different rooms is symbolic of that separation. This film, bottom
line, turns out to be a primer in Sigmund Freud and Robert Bly with a
touch of Jung added in.</P>
<P>While this is a cunning twist, (on par with the surprise twist in "The
Sixth Sense"), unfortunately it makes the last quarter of the film
difficult going, as it loses its momentum, particularly as the story
departs on a fascist plot line designed to wreak larger havoc on
society in order to bring about collapse.</P>
<P>Fincher has a strong visual and mood setting style that cumulatively
builds suspense. He is no stranger to the dark nature of mankind as
evidenced in the film "Seven". Fincher works in the nether regions of
the color spectrum preferring blacks, grays and other muted
colors. "Fight Club" also plays with perspective effectively, using
sound and visual effects, as well as simple devices such as having
characters break the fourth wall by talking directly to the
audience. This is like an underground film that accidentally got
greenlighted with a $60 million budget.</P>
<P>One may be tempted to have a knee jerk reaction that the violence and
fascist tone in "Fight Club" lands it in the odious company of
"Natural Born Killers", but this film is much smarter and deeper than
that. The violence in "Fight Club" is honest and ugly. It's not a
ballet like Sam Peckinpaw ("The Wild Bunch") or a comedic choreography
like Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". "Fight Club" is about a
man trying to become an integrated and whole human being, searching
for identity, a place, a mission in a consumer world where our last
major war was over petroleum.</P>
<P>"Fight Club" is anchored in the performance of its two stars and
intelligently written with sharp observations about American
society. Norton carries the first part of the film masterfully. As for
Brad Pitt, it deconstructs his matinee idol status and makes him a
truly menacing figure. This is arguably the most audacious mainstream
movie to be released this year. And even though it's outrageous and
out of control, and runs out of gas before the end, it's because this
film is trying to push the envelope and every button in sight at the
same time.</P>
