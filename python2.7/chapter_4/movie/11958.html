<P>GOOD WILL HUNTING (Be Gentlemen Limited Partnership / Lawrence Bender
Productions / Miramax Films)</P>
<PRE>MPAA Certification: R
Genre: Drama
Cast: Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan
Skarsgård
Directed by Gus Van Sant</PRE>
<PRE>My personal rating: 5+ out of 6</PRE>
<P>GOOD WILL HUNTING was to me a very warm-hearted, intelligent and
well-conceived story of a 20-year-old boy, Will Hunting (Damon), whose
skills in mathematics and general science are tremendous. He suffers
from a difficult childhood, and together with his friends, he has been 
involved in robberies, fighting, and vandalism. A mathematics 
professor, Gerald Lambeau (Skarsgård), discovers Will's abilities,
and attempts to make use of him in his mathematical research. But
upon realizing that Will is uncooperative and difficult to handle,
professor Lambeau persuades Will to see a therapist, Sean Maguire
(Williams), who was Lambeau's room-mate in college.
Throughout the rest of the movie we follow the growing friendship
between Will and Sean, and Will's new-found love, Skylar (Driver).
Will Hunting must understand who he really is, and attempt to
deal with his past. Only then might he be ready to face the future ...</P>
<P>Ben Affleck (starring Will's friend Chuckie) and Matt Damon has
written a very impressive screenplay, and I was not surprised
that they snatched an Academy Award for it. Although the story is
somewhat predictable (several times we know what the next move will
be), I find it charming and quite good. The ending might be a bit
slow, but it's surprising and lovely. Robin Williams shows once and
for all that he can do drama roles, and Matt Damon is very convincing
as Will Hunting. Even the Swedish actor, Skarsgård, seems to do well
in Hollywood pictures. His role is very basic and unemotional but
not cardboard-like. Generally speaking, all the actors did their part,
and brought the movie to a place among the best of 1997.</P>
