<P>Mumford
Directed by:  Lawrence Kasdan
Starring: James Adams, Ted Danson, Hope Davis, Loren Dean,
Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer, Martin Short, 
Robert Stack, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Alfre Woodard
Running time:  111 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ***1/2</P>
<P>Mumford (Dean) is a psychologist who has recently opened a
practice in the town of Mumford.  He is highly successful
and it seems every citizen of prominence in the town comes
to him.  Among his patients are the local pharmacist with
a rich fantasy life in which he never appears, a high 
school girl suffering from anorexia, a housewife who can't 
stop buying things, a young divorced woman with chronic
fatigue syndrome, and a billionaire who just isn't happy.</P>
<P>Everything seems ideal on the surface.  But there are problems.
Mumford isn't quite what he seems to be.  A rejected patient,
Short playing the sneaky annoying guy he always plays, tries
to create problems for Mumford.  The local billionaire has
some unusual requests.  And Mumford finds himself falling in
love with one of his patients.</P>
<P>I watched this film with a friend who took umbrage at the 
underlying message, that serious illnesses like anorexia
and chronic fatigue syndrome can be cured by having a friend
or getting a date.  Of course, this film isn't a serious 
attempt at espousing a treatment and Mumford's methods are
not to be taken seriously.  But I suspect some people will 
be upset at this depiction.  </P>
<P>This is a funny movie.  It's also pretty obvious.  You are 
never surprised at any of the revelations or at the final
turn of events.  But it does make you laugh.  And what more
can you want from a comedy?</P>
