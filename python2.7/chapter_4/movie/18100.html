<P>It's like a bad hair day.With high expectations you enter a newer, much
talked about beauty salon. You exit  looking terrible. Fluffy is good but
uglifying fluffy is not. You go to the movie Entrapment  in a positive
state of mind since no matter what he plays, Sean Connery is appealing
simply "because he's there" --like Everest . Also, because last July,
co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones made a strong American debut in The Mask of
Zorro.</P>
<P>Among more esoteric criteria, there's curiosity as to what Brit-born
director John Amiel hath wrought. His feature debut Queen of Hearts (UK)
was excellent; his next films ,U.S. made were the quirkily original Tune in
Tomorrow; Sommersby ( the remake of The Return of Martin Guerre), and
Copycat , both ho-hum; The Man Who Knew Too Little, a fizzle.</P>
<P>Producer-writer Ron Bass has scripted or co-authored Rainman, Gardens of
Stone, Sleeping with the Enemy, The Joy Luck Club, and more .Lately he
perpetrated What Dreams Come True. William Broyles co-wrote Apollo 13. The
reputation of the technical crew (cinematographer, designer, editor, etc.)
is solid. And it is the techs who are the real makers of Entrapment. Q: For
better or for worse?  A: for worse.</P>
<P>In the opening sequences, a totally masked human being dives a huge
distance from the top of a New York skyscraper down to the outside of a
large picture window. The creature uses incredible gadgetry and carries on
its body enough super-high-tech gizmos to build a Ferrari. The break-in
nets a Rembrandt painting.</P>
<P>Right away the outrageous gadgetry is like a warning sign to the viewer. At
first, like a yellow traffic light.  In the next few minutes it turns red.
Expectations are rapidly discouraged.</P>
<P>Cut to the big insurance company which will have to shell out $24 million.
Investigator Gin talks her supervisor Hector Cruz (pronounced Cruise) who
pants discreetly in the presence of the beauty, to let her go after the
thief.</P>
<P>Videos of an auction confirm that the robber has to be the master of them
all, the  mega- I.Q. Mac. The videos are providential, as everything else.
Nothing ever goes terminally wrong. Name the place, time, planning,
operation, method,equipment, throughout the flick all work with the
precision of an atomic clock -- and to the detriment of even a shadow of
believability. More discouragements for viewers.</P>
<P>In London, Gin stalks Mac, Mac stalks Gin. When they get together Gin
declares that she was the robber of the Rembrandt. "Now can be a good time
for you and I to discuss something" says  suave Connery, whose smoothness
does not extend to the English grammar. They join forces for a series of
feats-- but not feasts for our brains.</P>
<P>Gimmickry keeps bombarding us. It replaces what logically should have been
the step-by- step development of heists, scams and such, from conception,
to planning, to modus operandi.. We are placed before "faits accomplis."
All this involves double- and triple-crossings, mistrusts, Mac's princely
castle in Scotland, a call-box that just happens to be in view of the
mansion (Mac predictably monitors Gin's call to her boss), the reaching of
an exposition by underwater means.The duo remove their diving outfits to
appear in public in impeccable formal clothes.They perpetrate a  highest
-tech robbery of an invaluable Chinese mask. All this keeps the viewer at
arm's length, uninvolve, without a stake in the game.I have nothing against
techno-flicks, even think fondly of some, like the wrongly disparaged
WarGames. But man cannot live by computer chips alone.</P>
<P>The couple take off for Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia, for what will be a
climax of a scheme of Gin's. At the start of the new millennium, via
computer strategies, big money establishments will  find themselves eight
billion (with a b) dollars lighter.</P>
<P>What surfaces is a) a case of aesthetic blindness. Looking at the
backwaters of the city, Gin warbles "Isn't it beautiful?" (My answer :NO!
); b) the reappearance of diverse characters, all even less than
unidimensional; c) the main action. It  takes place during the Millennium
revelry at, in, and between the interconnected twin towers of the tallest
building in the world. All this is beyond the possibilities of sane
descriptions. The phony wrap-up, a  happy ending that, while not hi-tech,
makes no sense, is strictly from hunger.</P>
<P>Matters are so incredible that they veer from ridiculousness to script
stupidity. I realize that this entire turmoil is supposed to be amusing,
but my funny bone was paralyzed. A few good moments are overwhelmed by the
mechanical nature of things. It's not just Missions Impossible but also
Suspense Impossible. At least, whether bored or not, the viewers won't be
offended by the picture. That's a teeny plus.</P>
<P>(There may be an exception, though. Actor Ving Rhames, who seems to be
Mac's main purveyor of high-tech stuff --but wait-- is, I hear, highly
principled, moral and religious. Yet he plays the movie's sole purveyor of
cascading four-letter words. It jars).</P>
<P>What about love and sex, you'll say? By moviedom's Ten Commandments there
has to be mutual attraction. For a change, it is made into a hesitant
flirtation, a "pas de deux" miles away from the instant bonding of James
Bond and his cuties. But then, if filmmakers go for cliches, they ought to
have the courage of their convictions. Too little time is devoted to
romance.At one point, Rhames reminds Connery "Hey, you're 60." In reality
he was 68 when the film was made, and made with an uncomfortable, secret
awareness of his true age. The couple is handled diffidently, as if with
roadsigns that warn "Dangerous Curves. Reduce Speed."</P>
<P>James Bond was a bedding-downer, not a lover. But 23 years ago, in Robin
and Marian, the aging, scarred, battle-weary  Robin (Connery) and the aging
nun Marian (Audrey Hepburn) gave us a splendid, beautiful, moving love
story. With a little more daring, while never talking to the mind,
Entrapment could have spoken to the heart  had it propped up its awfully
dull dialogue and un-propped the stage props.</P>
<P>The overwrought, cartoonish, supra-tech nature of the yarn dehumanizes
everything. By comparison, it  makes even the James Bond adventures feel
realistic and rich in characters. Here however, total and unstoppable
incoherence takes us from plain yawns to giga-yawns. It can be dangerous if
you also feel like gagging.The solution is for your brain to gag and your
jaws to yawn.</P>
