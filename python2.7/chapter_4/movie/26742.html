<P>   Nothing aids meditation about life better than having a
heart attack on the golf course.  You stare at the sky and as
your life begins to pass before you, you fixate on your
journey's most dramatic events.  In this case, Old Hardy
(Jack Lemmon), dropping to his knees and then his back
while suffering his fifth or sixth coronary assault, allows his
mind to drift to two seminal events in his life: one involves a
brief scene recalling a World War One battle engaged in by
his childhood hero, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) in which
Junuh's witnessing the death of his battlefield buddies causes
him to be shellshocked.  The other, which Old Hardy narrates
from time to time and which takes up the bulk of this story,
involves his role as onlooker to dramatic events in Junuh's
life--his romance with the drop-dead gorgeous Adele
Invergordon (Charlize Theron) and his Prozac-like revival
from the long depression emanating from his trauma on the
field of carnage.</P>
<P>   When a guy says that golf is a game that no one wins but
one which you can only play (as Old Hardy one once learned
from a most unusual fellow), you wonder what he means by
that: after all, there are winners in the sport, aren't there? 
You soon realize that Hardy is manipulating the game of golf
as a metaphor for life, and here the geezer is on safer
ground.  Indeed, life is a game, and no one gets out alive.
Ultimately we all lose.  But how you play the game is what
counts.  To demonstrate this, "The Legend of Bagger Vance,"
directed with Robert Redford's restrained hand, turns what
could have been a fortune-cookie story into a lovely tale
which skirts the borders of the maudlin but remains as solidly
authentic as the counsel it preaches.  "The Legend of Bagger
Vance" has added, mythic resonance since (as the splendid
online critic Edward Johnson-Ott points out) the film is
nothing short of a retelling from the Indian epic "The
Mahabharata," in which Bhagavan (meaning "Lord" or
"spiritual master") aids Arjuna thorugh a spiritual crisis.  The
name "Bagger Vance" sounds an awful lot like "Bhagavan"
and "R. Junuh" is not unlike "Arjuna."</P>
<P>   "The Legend of Bagger Vance" is situated in one of the
most touristic cities, Savannah, Georgia, just as the
Depression was to put thousands of its citizens out of work
and would lead to the suicide of Adele's father--who had built
a magnificent golf course only to see the land go unused. 
Adele, refusing to sell, takes a chance on attracting national
publicity by announcing a competition between two of the
world's great golfers, the strikingly handsome Bobby Jones
(Joel Gretsch) and a fellow known to put on a good show as
well as belt out a great game, Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). 
To attract the ardent interest of the locals, she also
invites a man with whom she enjoyed a pre-war romance,
Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who has "lost his swing" and
spends his time holed up with his heavy-drinking, card-
playing pals.  </P>
<P>   While Junuh has to be roped into the joining the game
given his utter lack of confidence, who better able to do the
convincing than Hollywood's most strikingly attractive
performer?  As the bold entrepreneur impresario, Charlize
Theron's Adele could probably convince hell to freeze over,
though she is unable to get her depressed boy friend to do
much on the golf course--not until the mysterious Bagger
Vance emerges from the nocturnal mist insisting that with a
little help from a concerned caddy, Junuh can get his groove
back.</P>
<P>   Redford's movie, scripted by Jeremy Leven from Steven
Pressfield's nostalgic novel, follows the trajectory of Frank
Coraci's "The Waterboy"--in-the-dumps guy finds his
authentic self and emerges as hero--but oh, what a
difference. While "The Waterboy" is a pathetic, dumbed down
attempt at comedy, "Bagger Vance" turns what could have
been fortune-cookie maudlin into a tender, well-acted, and
most of all controlled and adult yarn whose mythic roots
could scarcely be lost on any viewer.  The expressive J.
Michael Moncrief in the role of young Hardy Greaves is not a
cutesy-putesy sitcom kid in the game to attract the ahhhs and
ohhs and look-how-darling crowd but is as genuine an idol-
worshipping kid can be, a sight to be seen by today's youth
who are allegedly bereft of real heroes.  As Adele, Theron
shows us that saving her golf course is important but even
more consequential is revving up and saving her relationship
with her true love.  Will Smith is the perfect spirit, giving
advice like an ordinary human being, a caddy in fact, and not
with the lighting bolts and special effects visions so often
used to designate supernatural elements.  Even the crowds,
as well-behaved as they are enthusiatic, give testament to
Robert Redford's vision, the belief that you need no blaring
soundtracks or melodramatic brushes to represent the broad
spectrum of human emotion.  This is the way to tell a story.</P>
