<P>        This is the third Besson film I have seen. While I liked The
Professional very much, I pretty much loathed The Fifth
Element. Besson definitely has something recognizable that runs through
his films, but I wouldn't call it auteuristic. I'd call it
self-indulgence.
        It would be easy to say that many great filmmakers are
self-indulgent, but I'd be inclined to disagree. Fellini comes to
mind. His is a very a personal cinema, but it isn't marked by
self-indulgence because, while extremely personal in nature, he still
made his films for the audience. He communicated his own personal
feelings and view through his style, and when it worked,
which seems to have been the usual case, it was quite rewarding.
        Besson, on the other hand, seems to make his films mostly for
himself. It's as if he can't really decipher what an audience
will take from any given scene. There just always seem to be things in
his films that don't belong there or in any other film. It's as
if it makes sense in his head, but nowhere else, perhaps. The best/worst
example of this is The Fifth Element. This film just
makes very little sense. Nothing fits together and it becomes a series
of ludicrous images meant to be some sort of grand
tapestry-- ultimately, only mismatched and predictably silly episodes.
        While The Fifth Element is near-masturbatory, The Messenger
merely borders on delusions of grandeur. It endlessly
tries to reposition itself to look at Jeanne in some way that should
reveal her in a new light, but this only tends to be a hindrance
as it becomes increasingly hard for the audience to take on any sort of
alliance or alignment. While I think it is a great idea to try
and examine Joan of Arc from different perspectives, it just isn't done
right here. Usually, the best portraits do not lay judgment
on their subjects, but present them as they were or are. This movie
could have been Lawrence of Arabia, offering Joan as an
enigma and trying to find the hidden motive, but never once alleging to
truly know it and leaving the audience to make the final
assumption. That's involvement and that's connection for the audience.
Any of that in The Messenger really is not due to
anything or anyone other than Milla Jovavich playing Joan herself.
        While the purpose of the writing and direction seems to be
lacking, not knowing even whether it should try to judge the
subject, but, rather, seeming to make an assumption then pull away
haphazardly, unsure of what to do next, Jovavich seems
quite sure of herself. She establishes herself in her role and plays the
whole thing with great consistency. She constantly seems
obsessed and never backs down from that. The power of her performance
comes from the way she plays the obsession.
Sometimes it merely seems to be a driving force, and other times it
seems to be something that could pull her apart. She seems
to be the only one who really makes the subject her own, unafraid of
offending anyone with the way she portrays her
characters, while the rest of the production seems to float somewhere
above the decision or inclination to do the same.
        All this is not to say that the film is horrible. There are
indeed some good things within it, such as the wonderfully shot
battle sequences. They look amazing and really pull you in, only
faltering when they try to focus in on individuals. This is
because the only true character in the film is Joan. All supporting
characters are more like vague and useless charicatures,
mostly ridiculous. So, when the battle scenes begin to focus on these
characters, it just seems silly and uselessly orchestrated
and calculated. Still, this happens few enough times that the battle
scenes are still quite stunning, and, along with the very strong
performance of Jovavich, the film becomes much more watchable than it
would have been without.</P>
