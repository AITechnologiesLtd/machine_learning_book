<PRE>                             LEAVING LAS VEGAS
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<PRE>** 3/4.[Credits follow text]  </PRE>
<P>"I came here to drink myself to death " says Ben (Cage) to 
Sera (Shue). This may or may not reach the status of 
quotations like "Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'"; "Go 
ahead, make my day";  "Here's looking at you, kid"; "Goodness 
had nothing to with it, dearie".But it is bound to find a 
place on lists and in movie-trivia games. </P>
<P>Ben, arguably the heaviest drinker in movie history, is a 
gigaholic. Dismissed from his Hollywood job, he heads for 
Vegas.  There he has a strange love affair with hooker Sera. 
Contrary to the old film cliches, there is no mutual 
regeneration in this odd couple.  </P>
<P>The film,out for months,only recently made it to my town. By 
then I was aware of its unamimously enthusiastic (so far as I 
know) critical reception, and that Oscar nominations were 
almost guaranteed -- even though its subject does not make 
Cage and Shue shoo-ins for the big acting prizes. </P>
<P>By coincidence, the day after I finally saw that movie, Dick 
F., a close friend, fine academic, actor and critic -- a man 
who understands movies -- asked for my reactions to it. Here 
they are, pell-mell, with mixed praise and reservations, the 
way I e-mailed them to him.</P>
<P> 1) Logically, what with Ben's daily bathtubful of alcohol, he 
should have arrived in Vegas in a hearse.</P>
<P>2) A drunk of his caliber and a prostitute of Sera's type are 
not intrinsically interesting. </P>
<P>3) We never learn what drove Ben to the hooch, except that he 
now drinks because his wife has left him... because he drank. 
A vicious circle. We know that Sera seems proud of her talent 
for adapting to men's wishes and fantasies. "I turn on, I 
become who they want..." She is also rather smug about the 
money she makes. "I get $300 just to get in his room, and it's 
$500 after that." This does no make her "simpatica." </P>
<P>4) I use the phrase "not interesting" but not "unappealing" or 
"depressing."  The last two are not drawbacks.  Many top 
movies are about human monsters. But "uninteresting" is a 
liability. </P>
<P>5) Gertrude Stein said that the ordinary is more interesting 
than the extraordinary. She was right. Crazies or weirdos are 
not automatically interesting without deeper layers or 
sub-texts. </P>
<P>6) Other mega-drunks can be more involving. As in John Ford's 
"The Fugitive," with Henry Fonda as the "whiskey priest," from 
Graham Greene's moving "The Power and the Glory." Or, from 
another Greene book, "The Honorary Consul," with its great 
turn by Michael Caine. Or Albert Finney in John Huston's 
neglected "Under the Volcano." Or the classic "The Lost 
Weekend" with its pathetic dipso. Or "Days of Wine and Roses" 
with its terrible slides into booze. Or the weird, nihilistic 
"Barfly," with Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway, both irritating 
actors -- which makes them all the more convincing as lushes.</P>
<P>7) Nicolas Cage is on my short list of the best performers 
around today. Again, his acting certainly is up to his 
standards. He squeezes every drop of his role with minimal 
expressions, has an odd type of politeness, gentleness and 
sincerity. His pores must ooze alcohol, but behind the skin he 
is a potentially likable fellow, which makes his tragedy all 
the sadder. Even so, his character is so limited by the script 
that he did not engage my attention sufficiently.</P>
<P>8) Ben is no liar, yet he states that he is great in bed. It 
is widely held that alcohol may increase desire but impedes 
performance. Go figure.</P>
<P>9) Sera's part is rather undeveloped. That she will fall 
incongruously for the drunk is telegraphed early on. That, 
with the rates she charges and at the rate she is going, she 
may well end up terminally diseased or even killed by someone 
(her profession has that risk) is also clear. The affair 
between two dregs is an old romantic cliche, but, I admit, 
carefully camouflaged by risque realism.  </P>
<P>10) Photography is excellent -- with hand-held shots and quick 
transitions -- and all the more remarkable as it was shot on 
Super-16mm stock. But why are the views of Vegas so lush, 
especially the night shots?  Why romanticize a place that is 
tawdry, Mafia-ridden and coarse, a place that, metaphorically, 
reeks of sex-for-pay and greenbacks?  This might have been 
justified if shown as the perception of romantic lovers, but 
this couple is beyond esthetic fantasies. </P>
<P>(After writing the above I was told that in a TV interview 
director Figgis did address someone's complaint that night 
exteriors "looked too pretty." He replied that the 
camera-people shot handheld, with available or minimal light, 
and let the backgrounds just happen, so that the result was 
unintentional beauty. I'll have to think about this).</P>
<P>11) The photography as well as the story can become precious, 
as in  boozing underwater in a motel pool. I allow however 
that the vacation spot has a desolate ambiance that fits the 
mood, and that there was clever staging in the  way the motel 
owner, with contained rage, throws out the couple.</P>
<P>12) The odd name Sera is too obvious: it points to Que Sera, 
Sera (What Will Be, Will Be), which leads to the notion of 
fatality as well as to an anti-Doris Day image.</P>
<P>13) Sera's pimp sordidly sells her in Vegas. We learn nothing 
about where those two are coming from. Physically they come 
from Los Angeles, but their past is a mystery.  Ben too is 
from L.A., but at least he comes from the movie world which is 
its own kind of prostitution, a parallel to Sera's profession. 
(Note the opening of the movie in a restaurant where two 
bimbos are ready to do themselves some good by joining their 
Hollywood-executive male hosts on the casting couch).  </P>
<P>14) Sera gives Ben a hip flask, another obvious symbol. It 
stands for her complying with Ben's request after she had 
offered him to stay in her apartment : "I'll  do it but you 
must never ask me to stop drinking." The flask, however, is so 
ludicrously tiny for someone with superhuman imbibing powers 
that it becomes comical.  </P>
<P>15) The film, proceeds rather than progresses, which is OK. 
But the talk remains dull, the twosome, indifferent. Their 
speech may be natural, but it paints the movie into a corner. 
How much could one take of a "prehistoric" flick with people 
who just grunt, were it not for action (a saber-tooth tiger?) 
and Raquel Welch in a bikini? </P>
<P>16) On the positive side, Shue is capable and visually 
intriguing: mow she looks now like a sleazy hooker, now like a 
sexy, rather elegant one, now like a college student, then 
like the girl-next-door or the young mother across the street.  </P>
<P>17) On the negative side. The abuse and violence visited on 
Sera feel like a "hey, let's have some action" afterthought.  
Experienced and streetwise as she is, she should have detected 
trouble instantly, and avoided it. </P>
<P>18) On the confusing side. Sera provides a commentary by 
appearing somewhere periodically and talking to someone whom 
we don't see in what seem to be different times, places and 
people. Murky. Perhaps the filmmakers had planned to use a 
narration like those often found in films noirs, then thought 
better of it.  </P>
<P>19) On the irrelevant side. A TV is showing bits of actors 
Alida Valli and Joseph Cotten, in not just one but two 
different movies, "Walk Softly, Stranger," then "The Third 
Man." In the first film, Cotten is a crook redeemed by 
beautiful crippled Valli. In the second, he discovers that his 
pal Orson Welles is a crook and he (Cotten)is scorned by 
Valli. I cannot find any connections to "Vegas."  </P>
<P>20) The sexual climax is called "la petite mort" (the small 
death) in French and perhaps in other languages. Preciously, 
it is combined here with the big death. Ho-hum.</P>
<P>21) The acting is, I repeat, very good, in the grand manner 
(plus the Grand Marnier manner). At least Cage dies without 
saying "Rosebud." </P>
<P>Sad footnote. The author of the source novel committed suicide 
a fortnight after the movie contract had been signed.</P>
