UNBREAKABLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>UNBREAKABLE is the highly anticipated film that again unites THE SIXTH 
SENSE writer/director M. Night Shyamalan and actor Bruce Willis. The kid 
this time, however, is not Haley Joel Osment but 12-year-old Spencer 
Treat Clark (GLADIATOR).  Superbly crafted and strongly acted, the movie 
feels much like its predecessor.  While it's well worth seeing, it has 
to be labeled as a disappointment.  </P>
<P>Whereas THE SIXTH SENSE was a great film without the ending twist, 
UNBREAKABLE relies on its "surprise" ending to close the deal with its 
audience.  The ending is interesting but feels too much like a cheap 
plot trick.  It's also a lot easier to guess than THE SIXTH SENSE's 
shocking conclusion.  </P>
<P>The director's control is amazing.  Taking significant risk, he sets a 
pace so slow and methodical that he banks on the audience's good graces 
to stay with him.  He never loses you, but, in less capable hands, the 
movie could have turned into a major seat fidgeter.  Still, as you sit 
there in suspense, you're likely to find that the movie is drawing to an 
end before it ever seems to have properly achieved lift off.  It's a 
great ride in a sleek jet that spends all the time taxiing around the 
runway.</P>
<P>As the story opens, we are given a host of statistics about comic books, 
culminating in the conclusion that the average comic book enthusiast 
spends the equivalent of one entire year of his or her life reading 
comics.  It's a strange way to get started, but it lays the groundwork 
for the rest of the plot.</P>
<P>When we first meet David Dunne (Willis), he is a sad and lonely guy 
traveling on a train.  Willis's emotive performance lets us share in 
David's pain before we have even a hint as to what it could be.  A 
balding, middle-age security guard at a football stadium, David is the 
paragon of physical health, having never been sick since, well, no one 
is quite sure.  Emotionally, however, he is a wreck, complaining that he 
wakes up incredibly sad every morning.  His marriage with his wife Megan 
(Robin Wright Penn) is ending, and they are in the  final boarding 
stages of a separation.</P>
<P>The train crashes, killing everyone except David, who doesn't have a 
scratch on him.  This leaves him even more dazed and confused than 
normal.</P>
<P>In a parallel story that is quickly joined to the other, Samuel L. 
Jackson, as Elijah Price, plays a man whose bones are so brittle that 
the kids call him Mr. Glass.  Elijah, who was literally born with broken 
bones, is as fragile as David is indestructible.  Oh yes, David is a 
comic illustrations art dealer, but only to serious adult collectors.</P>
<P>Filmed by Eduardo Serra in extremely dark, morose shades of gray and 
scored by James Newton Howard with ominous, foreboding music, the 
intense picture projects a strong impression on the viewers.  Long 
sections of the movie are so silent that I was embarrassed just quietly 
turning the pages in my notebook.   </P>
<P>UNBREAKABLE takes you on a mesmerizing journey that you don't want to 
miss.  But don't be surprised if it leaves you less than satisfied.  I 
will not say anything more about it lest I accidentally give something 
away.  This is important since, absent the anticipation of the story's 
resolution, the movie loses most of its punch.</P>
<P>UNBREAKABLE runs 1:47.  It is rated PG-13 for mature themes, some 
disturbing violent content and a sexual reference and would be 
acceptable for teenagers.</P>
