Susan Granger's review of "GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI" (Artisan)</PRE>
<P>  Writer/director/producer Jim Jarmusch re-imagines the
gangster picture as a quirky cross-culture fusion of Eastern
philosophy, hip-hop music, urban darkness, and movie iconography. He
focuses on Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), an assassin who is obsessed by
the noble precepts of the 18th century warrior text, Hagakure: The
Book of the Samurai, applying them to his work as a contract
killer. In the samurai tradition, Ghost Dog has pledged his loyalty to
one master (John Tormey), a small-time New Jersey mobster who once
saved his life, with whom he now communicates only by carrier
pigeons. He's a loner whose only human contact is with a
French-speaking ice-cream vendor (Isaach DeBankole) and a curious
little girl (Camille Winbush) he meets in a park. The deliberately
slow-paced, character-driven plot involves a great deal of brutal
violence, stemming from vengeance, jealousy, and countless
double-crosses, climaxing in a blood-drenched finale. Curiously, Ghost
Dog doesn't speak a line of dialogue until 45 minutes into the
film. The blasting musical soundtrack by Wu Tang Clan's RZA
underscores both the hit-man's zen-like qualities and the lurking
menace of his allegorical environment. Jarmusch says he built his
characters from his experience living in New York's Little Italy,
where he witnessed the death of an old Mafia order. In fact, he
maintains, some of the actors came from that world: "They're gentlemen
to me, but they've also killed people." On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is an offbeat,
thought-provoking 6. While it's not a film to enjoy, it's one
adventurous movie-goers may appreciate.</P>
