<PRE>SCARY MOVIE 2
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The original Scary Movie was no cinematic masterpiece, but Scary Movie 2
isn't even on that par.  Keenen Ivory Wayans directs this shapeless,
excruciating mess of a movie that delivers exactly what we expect, just
not in a funny way.  While I admire the risk it takes in pushing pushing
the envelope, I don't admire Scary Movie 2 as a whole.  Tasteless,
raunchy humor is expected -- but does anyone want revolting and
nauseating humor?  There's a fine line between funny and just plain
sick; this movie goes way beyond that line.</P>
<P>The original was imaginative with its send-up of teen slasher flicks. 
Although relentless in its humor, it contained a definite purpose, a
true central character, and motivation.  Not that I liked it, but it
offered a lot more than this sequel.  Here, setting replaces story, and
that leads to an assortment of problems.</P>
<P>Screwball humor works best when it is situation based.  Scary Movie
spoofs recent movies such as Hannibal, What Lies Beneath, The House on
Haunted Hill, Charlie's Angels, The Haunting, and many others. 
Unfortunately this movie rarely captures the attitude of a screwball
comedy.  It's a bitter festival of perversion; the sequences feel
distant, unrelated, and seldom do they advance the plot.  Well, if you
can call it a plot.  The first film loosely followed the structure of
Scream, but SM2 has nothing.  It just fires off a lot of rounds, but
they rarely hit their targets.</P>
<P>Why's that?  It took seven screenwriters to create Scary Movie 2, and
it's almost as if the only guidance given to each writer was that he be
locked in a room and forced to concoct his own gross-out situation in an
attempt to outdo the others.  The product of those efforts gives us a
few early laughs, notably a hoot of an opening scene, wherein James
Woods stars in a memorable parody of The Exorcist.  But after the title
sequence, everything plummets downhill.</P>
<P>Scary Movie 2 contains plenty of creative jokes that evolve from
sexuality, drug use, intestinal difficulties, a vulgar talking bird,
reproductive organs, homosexuality, race relations, bodily fluids... oh,
and once in a while there's a gag about a ghost.  Any semblance of this
being a "scary" movie is lost altogether.</P>
<P>Of course, I sigh in surrender, as nobody will see Scary Movie 2 for a
thought-provoking story, well-developed characters, or a solid
narrative.  In fact, they'll come for the exact opposite reason --
because it doesn't have those things it will offer a cheap laugh.  While
this is no critics' picture, I can find pleasure in slapstick and
screwball humor, and I treasure the creativity it takes to spoof serious
material.  The problem comes when there is absolutely no humor and no
creativity in the end product.  Now that's scary.</P>
