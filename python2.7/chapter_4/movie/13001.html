<P>  Watching this movie about Francis Bacon, perhaps the
greatest painter of the latter half of this century, I couldn't help
thinking about Neil Simon.  Like Bacon, Simon is tops in his
field--not the greatest playwright, artistically speaking, but the
most successful, one of the most prolific, in fact the most
highly remunerated writer of plays in history.  Despite the
sniffing of some theater snobs, Neil Simon is nonpareil in his
ability to shape a well-constructed work.  So when are we
to get a movie about him?  Never.  Why not?  Because he
wears a suit and tie, speaks normally, and has had a
prosaically stable married life.  What artists get movies made
about them?  Those whose lives are filled with great drama,
preferably of the debauched kind.  Thus we get Vincente
Minelli's "Lust for Life," not because Vincent Van Gogh was a
great painter, but because he was a great painter AND cut off
his ear.  Scott Hicks's "Shine" would never have been made if
its accomplished pianist had not spent a good deal of his time
babbling incoherently.  Agnes Merlet's title character in her
"Artemisia" was a splendid painter whose name would be
unrecognized today if she did not insist on painting naked
men in Renaissance Italy.  Brian Gilbert made hay with
"Wilde" because that late 19th century British writer was
hounded by the Marquess of Queensbury until he wound up
in jail for the "crime" of private, homosexual unions.</P>
<P>   Along comes this picture about a painter about as
unorthodox as the aforementioned who, despite his being a
household name in England and France, is largely
uncelebrated in the U.S.  Ah but wait: he should be better
known and he will be after the release of this movie.
Americans may or may not go for what he did on canvas but
they can relate to the sensationalism that surrounded him. 
Bacon was a homosexual who encircled himself with a
demimonde of weird aesthetes, but what makes him a
fascinating study is his novel relationship with a working-class
stiff, a low-life petty burglar named George Dyer whom Bacon
caught in the act of robbing his home.  Rather than turn him
in or scare him away, he seduces him into a seven-year
relationship, paying him handsomely to be the model, the
icon, of a great many of his paintings.  He saves the man
from his insignificance but ultimately steers him toward
suicide.  Therein lies the potential audience, thematically at
least, for "Love is the Devil."</P>
<P>   Yet this fascinating, disturbing, challenging, and poignant
film is likely to be seen only by a select audience, an elite not
of devotees of the brush but of fans of highly stylized, avant-
garde filmmaking.  John Maybury, its writer-director, has taken
great pains to avoid the format of a static biopic.  Instead, he
has drenched the screen from time to time with a succession
of fast-moving images to capture the ambiance, much more
than the details, of the ill-fated affiliation.  He has the good
fortune to organize the skills of one of the world's great
performers, Sir Derek Jacobi in the artist's role, and the
talents of Ryuichi Sakamoto, whose atonal notes augment the
eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere of the 90-minute work.</P>
<P>   The story begins in 1964 as Bacon (Derek Jacobi) surprises
burglar George Dyer (Daniel Craig), who has chuted himself
into the painter's home and rummages about for something of
value.  "And who might you be?" the artist bellows, "You're
not much of a burglar.  Take your clothes off and come to
bed and you can have whatever you want."  With these words
the lives of the two are forever altered, as Bacon uses Dyer to
model a good deal of his paintings from 1964 to 1971 while
Dyer struggles--with Bacon's financing--to shuck off his
working-class culture and to fit into the artist's cloistered
world.</P>
<P>   Throughout their relationship, though Dyer has
been custom-fitted with expensive suits, given money and
trips to Paris and New York, he is no match for his
Pygmalion.  Gaining solace only when hanging out with rent
boys in Parisian bars, he cannot match his benefactor's
perpetual wit.  The clever Bacon is in his element when
mixing with women like models for nude photography with
whom he shares drinks, toasting "Champagne for my real
friends, real pain for my sham friends" and introducing his
unconventional confederates with words like "Welcome to the
concentration of camp."  When Dyer complains of nightmares,
Bacon quickly replies, "George, nightmares cannot be as
horrific as life."  </P>
<P>   It comes as no surprise to learn that director John Maybury,
himself an artist, has had experience making MTV videos. He 
amusingly hones in on his painter in the act of making
up his face even more carefully than Bacon applies himself to
his paintings.  In fact while Francis is seen actually attacking
his canvasses with the color, he deftly applies cosmetics to
his eyelashes, powder his face and forehead, and whitens his
teeth.    </P>
<P>   While Bacon often treats Dyer with contempt, lashing out at
him for rustling newspapers and "babbling" and advising him
to "get out," he has sublimated his rage most effectively in his
work, as so many artists are able to do to tame their inner
demons.  Maybury intermittently interrupts the unorthodox
narrative with images from the paintings, particularly one of a
naked man, covered with blood from head to toe while sitting
in a position similar to that found in the logo of the epic play,
"Angels in America."  The image keels over at the point in
which Dyer swallows a bottle of pills with a bottle of liquor.</P>
<P>   Maybury coaches a splendid performance from Derek
Jacobi (as though it were possible to do otherwise), and while
Daniel Craig cannot match one of the grand masters of British
theater (though he could easily portray the nicotine addict
from "The X-Files"), he does fine as the master's disturbed
foil.</P>
<P>   Toward the end of the movie, Bacon remarks "I want a
picture to annihilate the rest."  The entire movie may fall short
of annihilating the other movies about painters, photographers
and writers, but when you consider, especially, that this is
Maybury's first feature film, "Love is the Devil" is an
astonishing piece of work.</P>
