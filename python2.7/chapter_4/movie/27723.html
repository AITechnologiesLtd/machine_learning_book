<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>The hiss of a burner. The thrust of a needle injecting into the 
bloodstream. The dilation of a pupil as the drug takes effect. These are 
the images director Darren Aronofsky invokes over and over again in 
"Requiem For A Dream", one of the most remarkable, affecting and 
devastating movies in recent history. This is a film about drugs and the 
people who are hooked on them. But Aronofsky, not content merely to 
portray their debilitating influence on the lives of his characters, also 
uses brilliant cinematic trickery to draw the audience into the addict's 
frame of mind. "Requiem" is a trip in its own right -- disorienting and 
exhilarating and exhausting -- and that is perhaps most disturbing of all.</P>
<P>Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a twentysomething junkie with an 
ever-present need to get high. He's not the only one: his best friend 
Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are 
addicts too. Harry even goes so far as to steal furniture from the home of 
his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) to sell to a pawnbroker for a few bucks. 
(In one notable early scene, Sara drops by shortly thereafter and buys 
back the furniture: this is evidently a routine that has been repeated 
many times.) Harry and Tyrone dream of graduating from buyers to dealers; 
for his part, Harry hopes to repay his mother for everything she's put up 
with over the years, and wants to fund Marion's dream of becoming a
fashion designer. But neither of them really appreciates the peril 
inherent in their line of work -- from rival sellers, from the law, and of 
course from the drugs themselves.</P>
<P>Sara, meanwhile, is a widow who has all but given up on the remaining 
years of her life. She spends her time eating junk food and watching 
television, or sitting in a lawn chair in front of her apartment building 
with other aging belles, gossiping and getting sunburnt. One day, Sara 
gets a phone call which leads her to believe that she will soon appear on 
her favourite programme, a bizarre combination of game show and self-help 
promo. Sara seizes on this as an excuse to lose weight and get back in 
shape, and on the advice of one of the other women visits a doctor who 
prescribes her a daily menu of diet pills. At first, everything goes well 
and the pounds seem to drop off. Soon, though, the prescribed dosage just 
doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to, so Sara doubles up... 
and doubles up again... and again...</P>
<P>"Requiem For A Dream" benefits from several outstanding performances, none 
of them more exceptional than Burstyn's. Hers is as courageous, as 
difficult a performance as they come: Burstyn assumes an already pitiable 
character and exposes herself to indignity piled upon indignity. Sara 
Goldfarb represents what I expect many people dread as they age. She is a 
woman who no longer lives her days but merely endures them, whose future 
seems destined to consist of nothing more than the same tedious routine. 
She has no prospects, nor the energy to manufacture them.</P>
<P>It is hard, then, to not feel a glimmer of hope for Sara when she believes 
she might appear on her game show. It's fairly obvious from the start that 
this is a hoax, but perhaps this is just what Sara needs to reinvigorate 
her life. It is, therefore, all the more horrifying and disturbing to 
witness her downward spiral into diet pill addiction. Instead of Sara 
being lifted out of her routine, that routine has simply been made more 
terrifying. For instance, the fridge is no longer a source of transient 
comfort, but is now a monstrous nightmare: Sara hallucinates it burbling 
nastily and lurching toward her. The second half of the movie, as Sara's
appearance crumbles while her days race by in an addiction-fueled blur, is 
as scary as a formula slasher films put together.</P>
<P>Also well-handled is Harry's story, even though these segments are 
somewhat less absorbing -- perhaps because Harry and his friends just 
aren't as sympathetic as Sara. Leto gives a solid performance, mixing a 
naive optimism with the obstinacy and resourcefulness necessary to 
maintain his lifestyle. Harry's real tragedy is that he believes he can 
use drugs to his own advantage, when in reality it is the drugs that are 
using him. For instance, consider how, near the end, Harry willfully 
ignores the deterioration of his own health because he refuses to accept 
anything that might come between him and his fix. Wayans (so far removed 
from "Scary Movie" so as to be virtually unrecognisable) and Connelly turn 
in laudable supporting performances, as addicts who meet their own dismal
fates.</P>
<P>As important to "Requiem" as its strong acting is Aronofsky's direction. 
He embraces his medium here, employing such devices as quick editing, 
enhanced sound, and unusual perspectives to portray the universe from the 
disjointed point of view of his characters. (In most hands, the sight of 
an angry refrigerator would appear preposterous; here, it is petrifying.) 
In one notable scene, Harry and Marion are in bed together. Aronofsky 
divides the screen in two, with one half focussing on Harry and the other 
on Marion. Despite the fact that we know they are lying next to each 
other, their influence is barely felt beyond the edges of the other's 
frame. In this way, Aronofsky effectively conveys how the couple is 
together, and yet vastly apart -- a facet of their relationship which 
becomes increasingly pronounced later in the film, when a shortage of 
drugs drives them to desperate recourses.</P>
<P>Perhaps most astonishingly, Aronofsky successfully tells his story in 
"Requiem" without ever seeming preachy. This is a film of brutal, awful 
reality, not just another "Afterschool Special"-type exercise, and is 
infinitely more effective as a result. Forget narcotics and 
pharmaceuticals: after viewing "Requiem For A Dream", you'll think twice 
before popping so much as a vitamin pill.</P>
