<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Paying homage to the likes of Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson and Starsky and
Hutch ... "Payback" is a "Death Wish" of the '90s. Opening with a late '60s
secret-agent theme and filmed in a grainy bluish hue, the film has a 70's
feel without sticking plastic yellow daisies all over the screen. "Payback"
is packed with 90's twists, action and dialogue; so even though, president
Nixon and a certain Hicks fight are mentioned, you might still miss the
subtle "retro-ness."</P>
<P>Porter (Mel Gibson), a likeable thief, is betrayed by his wife in cohorts
with fellow thief Val (Gregg Henry). Following a successful sting, his
junkie wife Lynn and crime pal Val pop a couple of rounds in Porter's back
whilest fleeing with his share of the take. Months later, Porter exits the
hospital alive, but dead set on squaring the deal. And boy is he sorely
lacking in the patience department.</P>
<P>By now Val is hobnobbing with syndicate heavies after buying his way in with
Porter's money. Val spends his leisure time with Pearl, a tiny Asian
prostitute with an awesome left hook. Pearl's idea of foreplay brings the
battle of the sexes to an all out fist fight. It's shockingly funny.</P>
<P>Porter hooks up with Rosie, an old girlfriend who looks so much like his
wife that you might get a bit confused (so take heed). Rosie knows him well,
"I think the rumors that you're dead are true, you're just too knuckleheaded
to admit it." Porter and Rosie take on the entire syndicate for a scant sum
of 70 grand. All the while, a couple of cops ride Porter's back expecting
that this lunatic is actually going to be intimidated into handing a chunk
of the spoils to them. This and a few other plausibility issues are easily
overshadowed by the powerful and driven Mel Gibson. This movie is packed
with surprises, gunfire and humor; it's a fun action flick you shouldn't
miss.</P>
