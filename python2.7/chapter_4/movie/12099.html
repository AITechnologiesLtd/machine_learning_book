<PRE>TITANIC (1997)</PRE>
<P>Starring: You already know the whole damn list</P>
<P>Directed by: James Cameron, Written by: James Cameron</P>
<P>Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for disturbingly realistic violence, nudity,
sexual situations, and strong language - in other words, it should've
been an R</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Doug Skiles</PRE>
<P>It's hard to say something about this movie that hasn't already been
said.  Yes, it's brilliant.  Yes, the performances are all excellent. 
It's very well-written, and expertly directed.  What else needs to be
said?</P>
<P>Well, since you know that this film is an epic of excellence, maybe some
of its flaws should be pointed out for a change.  I'm not saying that
it's not excellent.  But somewhere, in the shuffle, we forgot that it's
not perfect.</P>
<P>There's little things, like the fact that the special effects, usually
excellent, also have clear flaws (obvious stunt doubles with
texture-mapped Leo and Kate faces in some scenes, obvious CGI people in
some daytime overhead shots).  There's big things, like the fact that
Billy Zane's Cal Hockley and David Warner's Spicer Lovejoy, who act as
the villians, are ridiculously one-note and depicted as having no
redeeming qualities.  It's even taken so far as to have Lovejoy put Jack
in a James Bond-style slow-moving death trap, where Spicer mocks Jack
briefly and then leaves him to his fate, just as someone like Goldfinger
would have done to Sean Connery.  You almost expect the dialogue to go:
 "Do you expect me to talk? - Jack Dawson
 "No, Mr. Dawson, I expect you to die!" - Spicer Lovejoy</P>
<P>That's never said, but the dialogue that IS there does sound a little
cheesy at times.  However, it's usually excellent, the stuff that
Cameron's legacy is made of.  All of his movies have dialogue that
always sticks with us, from the emotional union between Ripley and Newt
in ALIENS (1986) to the simple one-liners like "Hasta la vista, baby" in
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991).  </P>
<P>But perhaps the problem with the farthest-reaching implications is the
destruction of moral standards.  Why does Hollywood feel the need to
always depict marriage as a trap?  Is it because Hollywood marriages so
rarely last?  Maybe Cameron wanted to justify his own three marriages? 
And why do we always promote teen sex in Hollywood films?  We give
teenagers everywhere a license to have sex even when they feel nothing
for their partners.  We tell them to do what feels right, regardless of
how they feel about the person they use to get it.  When you see Jack
and Rose in this film, they're like a latter-day Romeo and Juliet -
star-crossed and doomed lovers, who fall in love with their idealized
images of each other rather than the truths.  Like Romeo and Juliet,
they believe that they've found love, but they barely know one another -
they've found infatuation, a temporary, yet powerful feeling that leads
them to do anything in their power to protect their relationship.  Only
as the years go own, and Rose grows older, does she realize that, yes,
Jack was someone she will always cherish for all that he did for her. 
But it's pretty doubtful that she could've understood that at her young
age on that Titanic voyage, after having only two days with the boy.</P>
<P>Some of these problems sound serious, but Cameron's narrative is such
effective storytelling that it doesn't matter very much.  It's the thing
of legend - an epic in the style of Hollywood's golden age.  It can
leave you disquieted, or it can leave you uplifted - or, more likely,
both at once.  Today, parents look at their children and smile, telling
them how it felt to see STAR WARS (1977) in it original theatrical
release.  Years from now, the youth of today will have their own movie
stories to share, and surely TITANIC will be one of them.</P>
