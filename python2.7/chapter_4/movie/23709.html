<P>After my scathing review of the sappy Brokedown Palace, I attracted the 
attention of a 14-year-old AOL troll who, among other things, took 
umbrage with my dismissal of that piece of celluloid as MTV-esque in its 
lack of depth or sensible storyline.</P>
<P>Man, she'll be chompin' at the bit after this one...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
A lookalike movie ("Doc Hollywood" without the humor, "An Officer And A 
Gentlemen" without the smarts) with lookalike actors (Leelee Sobieski 
looks like a young Helen Hunt, Chris Klein looks a bit like Keanu 
Reeves, and in the right light, Josh Hartnett looks like Tommy Lee 
Jones, pre-wrinkles), this flick soaks in the deep-fry vat of stupidity.  
"Here On Earth" (or "HOE", as I like to call it) simplistically recounts 
a mindnumbingly dumb "love triangle" between Kelley Morse (Klein), a 
spoiled little rich boy doing court-ordered community service rebuilding 
a diner he and "farmboy" Jasper Arnold (Harnett) trashed during a 
testosterone-driven drag race through Jasper's small town, and hometown 
girl Samantha "Sam" Cavanaugh (Sobieski), the object of Jasper's 
affection and Kelley's mapmaking tutorial.</P>
<P>Throw in a completely unnecessary (and just as completely unsuccessful) 
ploy to Pull At The Heartstrings with a subplot you could smell from a 
country mile away, and you'll understand Bammer's 5 Second Review of 
"Here On Earth": "Yuck".</P>
<P>The Upshot:
You Know Your Movie Sucked When...the only thing interesting about it 
was the geography fetish the writer seemed to have.  Bad enough that 
Richie Rich and Miss Thang had sex to a bad recital of various states; 
worse yet was Seitzman's inability to keep track of whether his story 
was set in Massachusetts, New York, or Toledo, Ohio.  More proof that 
public schools are failing our Youth; get thee back to Remedial 
Geography, sir! </P>
<P>This one went south (one of the few geographical directions that Kelley 
didn't head) rather quickly, when Seitzman and Piznarski chose to make 
the Kelley character a total jackass from start to finish, without 
giving him even the hint of a redeeming characteristic (even his 
Obligatory Half-Nekkid scenes felt too slimy to be sexy) or reason to 
root for him.  Sam's attraction to Kelley made absolutely no sense in 
that, or any other, context; to say that it seemed to come from way far 
out of left field, would be a gross understatement.  And because she, in 
turn, stepped all over poor loyal Jasper in her eagerness to play Name 
That State with Kelley, she sank right into the quagmire with Richie 
Rich; instead of coming across as Innocence, Awakened, she more closely 
resembled Ho', Golddigging.  Of the three lead characters, only Jasper 
had my sympathies--and he came off looking like a damfool, for letting 
his long-time girlfriend use him like a doormat (even after they'd 
broken up, no less).</P>
<P>There's little use in talking about the other characters--all there to 
support the losing cause of propping up the lamebrained main- and 
sub-plots; or how the cinematographer tried to capture the essence of 
Small Town U.S.A.--so nicely done that all it did was remind me of how 
bad the humans looked within it. If the storyline, as foundation, is 
shaky, the rest of the "house" is doomed to crumble; and "HOE" was 
standing on some seriously shaky ground.  </P>
<P>The last time I felt this mad after having watched a movie was in 
January of this year.  The target of my anger?  You remember a lil' 
something called "Supernova", no?</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
And now that I've offended the sensibilities of the MTV Generation, 
let's see if this application of the BF Brush winds up alienating me 
from My People...</P>
<P>As I sat in the theater watching "HOE", I kept pinching myself to make 
sure I hadn't nodded off and missed the part that explained why Sweet 
Smalltown-girl Sam would go for a [I'm running out of non-curse words to 
call him] stuck-up cretin like Kelley.  Clearly, Sam suffered from the 
same sicknesses that far too many Black women in America suffer from: 
the "No Good Black Men Left" fever and the "...So I'll Take This No-Good 
One" flu.  I could easily see the three main characters being Black, 
without skipping a beat: my mind's eye saw Charlie, faithful sturdy 
9-to-5'er with a mortgage and a receding hairline, supporting LaShaun, a 
simple city girl who hangs tough with him--until Slick Maurice rolls up 
to the curb with his Lexus and his Rolex; then it's Goodbye Charlie...</P>
<P>Hey, dog me out for that stretch of the imagination if you will, but at 
least my version *entertained* me for a minute or two.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Is it Just Me, or have most of the movies so far this year been bloody 
awful?  Maybe it's another ill effect of La Nina.  Here's to hoping the 
Bad Weather surrounding these writers, directors, and actors, will clear 
up soon.</P>
<P>"Here On Earth" (rating: greenlight): 
Somewhere along the way, it lost its compass.  But not even a 
state-of-the-art Global Positioning System could've helped "HOE" find 
its way home.</P>
