<P>THE ADVENTURES OF FELIX (DROLE DE FELIX)<HR></P>
<P>When Felix (Sami Bouajila, "The Siege") loses his job, he decides to travel
from Dieppe to Marseilles to visit the father he never knew.  He buys his
teacher boyfriend Daniel (Pierre-Loup Rajot) a ticket to meet him in a week's 
time and sets off on a journey that will net him a family of a different kind
in "The Adventures of Felix" (Drole de Felix).</P>
<P>The writer/director partnership of Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau
("Jeanne and the Perfect Guy") begin their film by establishing Felix'
loving relationship with Daniel in the coastal Normandy town of Dieppe.
Daniel is amused to discover that Felix has become addicted to a soap opera
during his job on a commuter ferry boat, Felix has a run-in with an
inexperienced kite flyer and he visits the local clinic for his HIV cocktail.
These three experiences will gain new significance as part of Felix' trip.</P>
<P>Once Felix hits the road, his adventures are titled as 'My little brother,'
'My grandmother,' 'My cousin,' 'My sister,' and finally 'My father.'  These
relationships are all symbolic and recognized by the audience well before
Felix makes the connection.</P>
<P>Sami Bouajila has our good will before he sets out on the road, where his
tendency to break out into song and dance as he travels makes him even more
endearing.  His first significant encounter, where he witnesses a fellow
Arab being beaten in a racist attack in Rouen, will haunt the rest of his
journey.  Felix bounces back by assisting a young art student, Jules (Charly
Segue), a seventeen year old who sneaks Felix into his bedroom for the night
hoping for romance.  The two 'borrow' a car and later Felix takes Jules into
his first disco (they get thrown out when Jules' age is discovered).  Felix
defines their relationship as like a younger/older brother, disappointing
Jules but leaving him with new life experiences, and moves on.</P>
<P>Felix is prodded awake by Mathilde (cabaret singer Patachou in a marvelous
comedic performance), a firecracker of an older woman who insists that he 
carry her groceries.  This sequence is rich with warm humor, as Felix does the 
chores Mathilde's son never gets around to while his sexuality makes her 
relive her wild youth ('I was a hot tomato.').  Their shared morning ritual of 
pill taking and soap opera viewing over breakfast highlights the similarities
between two diverse individuals.</P>
<P>'The Cousin' sequence, where Felix meets a railroad worker (Philippe Garziano)
and shares outdoor sex and some kite flying, is perfunctorily handled and
doesn't mesh well with the film's themes or pacing.  Felix moves on to assist a
woman on the side of the road.  Isabelle (Ariane Ascaride, "Marius et
Jeannette") is going in Felix' direction, but must make stops along the way
to deliver her three children to their three respective fathers.  The kids
provide some hilarity, especially when young Tonio (Adrien Auzias) challenges
Felix' conventional ideas about family.  Felix' final encounter with an
old fisherman (Maurice Benichou) leaves them both with fresh outlooks on
life and is satisfyingly poignant.  A worried Daniel meets up with a more
self aware, but still boyishly engaging, lover ready to take a romantic
holiday.</P>
<P>Director of Photography Matthieu Poirot-Delpech captures the glories of 
his north to south French locations in brilliant color while the classical
guitar score provides a Middle Eastern flavor.  Except for that one abruptly
handled sequence, Ducastel and Martineau deliver a socially conscious,
humanistic, funny road movie that's always engrossing.  "The Adventures of 
Felix" and its star have charm to spare.</P>
