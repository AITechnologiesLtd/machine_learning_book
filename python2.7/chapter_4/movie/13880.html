<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</PRE>
<P>Craig Monahan has come a long way from creating music videos and various
documentaries.  He began writing the script for The Interview over eight
years ago, which was finally furnished off with the help of a couple of
co-writers.  Much like Neil LaBute (responsible for the astounding In
the Company of Men), he has been able to ink more pen and film more
cohesively in his first feature than many directors and writers can
achieve in their careers.  Behind all the sticky multiple twists and
unwinding intrigue, his style of film making seems simple enough to me:
he doesn't really give a toss what we think of his characters or what
they do, just as long as we are manipulated enough into believing two
sides of a story, and that knowledge given to us isn't really given at
all.  It's forced; and once we enter the world of dark, repressive crime
life in Melbourne, there's no turning back.  And nor would we want to.</P>
<P>The two main protagonists are plausible and spiteful enough to ensure an
almost perfect amount of chemistry between the two leads. Tony Martin is
familiar with the tough guy role (with his characters in the long
running drama E-Street and Heartbreak High), playing Detective John
Steel, who interrogates the scared and confused Eddie Fleming (Hugo
Weaving).  Fleming seems innocent enough; and perhaps he his, but when
his apartment door is busted down by Steel and his even-tougher-guy
partner Wayne (Aaron Jeffery), he is placed in a darkened interrogation
room in the Melbourne CBD.  The charge: car theft.  Although Fleming is
at first reluctant to talk, when the subject changes from automobiles to
serial killings, he's all words.  And Steel realizes that his
predicament is far more complex than what he once suspected.</P>
<P>Monahan beckons us to ask the questions that he really loves not to
answer.  Is Fleming telling the truth?  Is he manipulating the situation
to his advantage?  Is he a conniving criminal genius, or an average
no-hoper on the dole?  Much to the film's advantage, he's probably a
little of everything, and reminded me of Kevin Spacey in The Usual
Suspects.  Both are unremarkable little men who end up showing their
sinister-but-maybe-not-sinister colours.</P>
<P>Monahan and his team of writers have pushed aside conventional narration
and replaced it with the art of reveal, where the characters are
diffused bit by bit until we can get a reasonable understanding of their
motives.  This is similar for our comprehension of the plot, which puts
our protagonists in entirely different positions. "I've been from Lord
Mayor to shit carter in less than two hours," Martin states when a
heated conversation eventuates.  And whilst on the subject of Martin -
he's a dynamic actor who gives an equally dynamic performance.  With a
subtle Australian flavor to his speech and a vital presence, Martin
burns into the back of our brains the perfect image of a good cop and
bad cop rolled into one.  Weaver is also good - very good - but some of
his dialogue seems a touch too simplistic at times.</P>
<P>It's a shame that Monahan has thrown away some valuable scenes with the
inclusion of Steel's predictable, uncivil macho man partner Wayne.  He
spoils the atmosphere on many occasions by looking, pure and simply,
stupid.  One scene, when Steel gives him firm advice regarding their
case, all effectiveness of this moment is lost when Wayne spits over the
side of a flight of stairs in his frivolous display of anger.</P>
<P>The Interview is perhaps a little over worked, with the production crew
doing everything possible to seduce us into the world of crime
investigation.  However, it is shot with incredible skill and precision
by Simon Duggan, who balances out the film's long pull-backs with
extreme close ups.  Oscar nominee David Hirschfelder (for Shine) also
adds much to the experience with his eerie and abstruse composition.</P>
<P>In the end, The Interview is an excellent gritty Australian flick, with
only a few flaws.  Although the film's climax is a little too passively
written, this is probably a good thing for Craig Monahan - this
explosive new director is already impressionably brilliant behind the
camera.  If he manages to achieve that same feat with his writing, Craig
might just become the new force in Australian cinema.</P>
