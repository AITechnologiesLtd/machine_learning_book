<P>        It's a curious comment on the state of Hollywood that the most
realistic action hero offered up in any of this year's summer blockbusters
is the President of the United States.  Judging from "Air Force One"'s
opening weekend box office, we as an audience, even in this modern age of
cynicism and distrust of our nation's leaders, are more than willing to
believe that the President would defend himself, his family, and his
country with his fists as easily as he would with military strikes and
smart bombs.  Why?  Two words: Harrison Ford.  In "Air Force One", Ford
adds to his mile-long list of action fits while giving the audience a
two-hour lesson in star power.
        The setup of "Air Force One" is fairly easy to follow.  An allied
group of U.S. and Russian commandos raid the Presidential Palace of
Khazakhstan, overthrowing and imprisoning the hard-line Khazakhstani
Communist leader, General Radek.  U.S. President Marshall(Ford), at a
banquet in Moscow, follows this with a speech condemning Radek's
brutality, replete with a vow to fight terrorism throughout the world.
Ford makes a stately and noble chief executive; he embarks on this new
policy, not because his re-election campaign is coming up, but because,
"It's the right thing to do."  Once again, an idealism that we as
Americans wish our leaders still had.  After the banquet, Ford retires to
his plane, the actual AFO, for the flight home with his wife(Wendy
Crewson) and daughter(Liesel Matthews).  We see the president as a doting
father and loving husband, and a football fanatic who'd rather watch the
game with a beer than sit through another policy meeting; we see the
President as an average guy.  Unbeknownst to him and everyone else on
board, however, a group of Russian terrorists, led by psycho
extraordinaire Gary Oldman, have boarded the plane with the aid of a
duplicitous Secret Service agent, disguised as a news crew on a press
tour.
        Of course, the terrorists take over the plane, kill a few people,
and go looking for the President; they want him to influence the Russian
president to release Radek.  Before Oldman and company can get to him, the
Secret Service whisk Ford off to his Presidential escape pod.  Believing
that the Prez has escaped, Oldman goes to Plan B.  He uses AFO's
communications system to contact Washington, and informs Vice President
Glenn Close that he intends to kill a hostage every half hour until Radek
is released.  Predictably, the Cabinet is in disarray.  Close squabbles
with the Scretary of Defense (Dean Stockwell)over authority; a humorous
moment arises when the Cabinet can't find a copy of the Constitution to
figure out wh exactly is in charge.  They know something that Oldman
doesn't:  Ford wasn't in the escape pod.  Unfortunately, they don't know
if he's alive or dead, so they also don't know if he's still the
President.
        This is where the action begins in earnest.  Ford sneaks around
the underneath of the plane, trying to figure out a way to save his family
and the other hostages.  Soon, Oldman notices that he's losing men, and
begins looking for whoever is attempting to foul up his plans.  Much of
the film from this point feels like a high-stakes version of "Die Hard" on
an airplane, and it is, but "Air Force One" is also complex, well-acted,
and its action scenes will leave you breathless.  Oldman gives the film an
intense, brooding energy as the buzz-cut psycho leading the hijacking,
alternately exuding justifying ideology, uncontrollable rage, and cool,
collected malevolence.  His telephone conversations with Close are
chilling.  He is every bit as solid and contolled here as he was
outlandish in "The Fifth Element"; this film loses a little steam with his
demise.  Close is a convincing VP, all nerves as she attempts to sort out
the mess while defending the President's course of action.  "Fargo" Oscar
nominee William H. Macy lends a hand as an Air Force officer who aids the
President in retaking the plane.  The real stars, though, other than Ford,
are director Wolfgang Petersen and the model AFO he has created.
Petersen's trademark claustrophobic action (I recently read a review which
referred the film as "Das Plane") is in good effect here; it's a surprise
Bruce Willis hasn't sought out Petersen.  The tense action and fantastic
in-air effects (Check out the exploding fuel tanker and the fighter plane
battle.  Only one of the effects shots doesn't work - you'll know which
one when you see it...) help Petersen overcome a somewhat implausible,
often corny script by first-time Screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe.  Even
with all of this going on around him, though, everything centers on Ford.
He is worth every penny of his reported $20 million salary in this, his
best actioner since "The Fugitive" and his return, after the disappointing
grosses of "Sabrina" and "The Devil's Own", to the box-office throne to
which he is accustomed.  One amusing final note:  A friend with whom I saw
"Air Force One" couldn't understand why everyone in the film spoke so
reverentially of Ford's President Marshall.  I have no doubt that if
Harrison Ford himself were President, he'd receive the same reverence.</P>
