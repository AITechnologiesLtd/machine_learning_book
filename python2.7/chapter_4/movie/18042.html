<PRE>PERFECT BLUE (1997)
Director: Satoshi Kon
Rating: 3.5/5</PRE>
<P>SPOILERS AHEAD - When it comes to battling inner demons - the
doppelgaengers, the alien others - the Japanese literary circle takes it
on almost with an obsession. The anti-hero in Abe Kooboo's 1964 Tanin no
kao (The Face of Another) confronts his new, unfamiliar face, while the
protagonist in Endo Shusaku's 1986 novel Sukyandaru (Scandal) has to
face his murderous double in Tokyo's red light district.</P>
<P>Based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi's 1991 novel, Satoshi Kon's (Roujin Z,
Patlabor 2, Memories ~ Kanojo no omoide/Magnetic Rose) anime, Perfect
Blue (1997), deals with the double of a former pop idol who returns to
torment the singer, when she seeks to become an actress instead.</P>
<P>Mima Kirigoe is a member of the idol group Cham. Quitting the trio, she
decides to take up a career as an actress, and gets her first role in
the murder-mystery Double Bind, playing the sister of a murder victim in
the show. Already uneasy about her new life - especially having to
appear in a rape-scene, as well as posing nude for photo magazines -
Mima's life starts to fall apart when those involved in the film are
brutally murdered one by one. On the Internet, an alter-ego posts every
minute detail of her life onto her fan site. And more ominously, a
malevolent double appears to taunt Mima for turning her back on her
singing career.</P>
<P>Perfect Blue is an interesting dig at Japan's pop-idol industry, and its
teen idorus whose careers and lifestyles are at the mercy of the clean,
wholesome images their marketers and adoring fans come to expect of
them.</P>
<P>When Mima chooses to part with her idol-singing career, not only does
she earn the scorn of her former fans, but her own guilt also returns
back to haunt her in the form of her pop-idol double. Her rocky start in
the film business, coupled with the success of Cham, soon affects her
morale -- to the point that Mima wonders if she herself could be behind
the gruesome murders.</P>
<P>Further irony is also found in Double Bind, the movie Mima is acting in
when the crimes began. Called 'the looking-glass of Perfect Blue' by the
staff of the anime, Double Bind is almost a mirror-image of the turmoil
going on in Mima's head.</P>
<P>Takeuchi's novel seems set for what should have been an intriguing film
adaptation. But despite Kon's competent direction, Perfect Blue is less
the psychological thriller than it is another murder-mystery to feature
a celebrity being stalked.</P>
<P>The film fails to work up enough scenes inside Mima's head to suggest
that as her acting career takes a turn for the worse, Mima's begins to
yearn for her past. There are flashes of that in the film - like when
she fantasies herself among her former group mates, as they celebrate
their single making it to the charts - but such moments are few and
brief.</P>
<P>In another scene, Mima wakes up to the news of the murdered
photographer, and subsequently finds the blood-stained attire tucked
away in her closet. A terrified Mima hastily hides them away when
someone comes knocking on her door, and that is the last we hear of the
matter. Such a discovery would have undoubtedly traumatised the girl,
and yet its psychological impact is again played down.</P>
<P>By dealing inadequately with Mima's own ambiguity, Perfect Blue loses
that cutting-edge in this sort of film. By the time it is revealed that
Mimamaniac, an obsessed Mima fan, and Rumi, Mima's own disillusioned
manager were behind the killings, the ending has become disappointingly
run-of-the-mill.</P>
<P>"I am the real thing," a confident Mima takes off her shades as she
smiles into the car's rear-mirror. Not that there was much before that
had one guessing otherwise. Not that there is much after to indicate
that it's all but one bad dream for Mima either...</P>
<P>I'm not looking for another Freudian trip - a la Neon Genesis Evangelion
- but for a show touted as a 'psychological suspense-thriller', the way
the film ended, and how it got there, left me feeling rather
short-changed.</P>
<P>Also, the screenplay by Sadayuki Murai (Eko Eko Azarak) is engaging as
far as mystery-dramas go, but again it's more pulp fiction than a
thinking-man's anime. Some of the scenes in the later half of the film -
with Mima's mind traversing back and forth between acting and reality -
gets a little disruptive and incoherent as well.</P>
<P>But criticisms aside, Perfect Blue is, nevertheless, well worth the
accolades and awards it's received. It's an unmistakably disturbing and
absorbing work -- gripping (and perhaps gory) enough to keep fans of the
genre happy. Some scenes -- like the one where Mima's double stabs a
photographer to death -- are visually powerful. And Mima does come
across as an anguished and confused character.</P>
<P>Being a fan of horror-mysteries myself, I enjoyed Perfect Blue. But
being a demanding anime fan, I;m also left thinking if this could have
been something more, especially when the industry's heavyweights such as
Katushiro Ootomo and Hisashi Eguchi have lent their expertise to the
film.</P>
<P>Perfect Blue is good, no doubt. It just ain't perfect.</P>
