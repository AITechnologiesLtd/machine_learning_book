<PRE>Cooler Than 007
The Corruptor</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat (of Hong Kong action film fame and "Replacement Killers") is
cool. Cooler than 007 (I'd give him a 009 on the cool scale) but in a Clint
Eastwood, not spy/gadgetry, kind of way.</P>
<P>Take a not so simple game of who-can-you-trust?, fine cinematography, a
great amount of gun fire, a slice of prostitution on the side and you've got
the ingredients for "The Corruptor."</P>
<P>After stylishly swank opening credits, the picture explodes onto the
screen -- a bomb in Chinatown. Yun-Fat is the tough, slightly crooked cop
respected in his district. Mark Wahlberg ("Boogie Nights") plays the rookie
(refered to as "the boy") whose white face and green bottom aren't welcomed
on Yun-Fat's Chinese team. The two grudgingly befriend each other while
eliminating members of gang A (like targets in a video game) as they are
seduced into a corrupt loyalty by gang B.</P>
<P>Despite a few unlikely plot developments, "The Corruptor" is compelling from
start to finish. Yun-Fat, following up "Replacement Killers" with style, is
beginning to show his age. But like Eastwood and Connery, I don't expect him
to loose his cool any time soon.</P>
<P>Starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg.
Directed by James Foley.
Produced by Dan Halsted at Illusion Ent./Newline Cinema.</P>
