<P>A Look Back at PRIMARY COLORS (1998) and THE WAR ROOM (1993)</P>
<P>After hearing the media's relentless obsession over President Clinton's sexual
life and personal affairs (not to mention "Wag the Dog"), we get Mike Nichols'
irreverent, deeply hysterical "Primary Colors" that centers on a presidential
candidate trying to evade questions about purported sexual dalliances. This
couldn't be a more timely subject and make no mistake, this film is about
President Clinton. "Primary Colors" also reminded me of the intoxicating
documentary "The War Room" from 1993, which focused on Governor Clinton's run
for the presidency in 1992. The same basic premise exists for both films: the
underdog aiming for the presidency amid a flurry of rumors and personal
bashing. </P>
<P>"Primary Colors" stars John Travolta as the white-haired, doughnut-eating,
Arkansas-bred Jack Stanton who vies for the presidential office. As played by
Travolta, Jack is quite a charmer and full of charisma, more so than Clinton.
He is even married to a Hillary Clinton-type, played to the hilt by Emma
Thompson using an authentic American accent. Stanton gets help from his
campaign staff headed by a James Carville-redneck-type (Billy Bob Thornton),
and a promising, idealistic campaign staffer Henry Burton (Adrian Lester). Jack
has fleeting sexual flings with co-workers while the staff prepares a campaign
aimed at proving to the people that Stanton believes in putting the people's
needs first. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, Stanton's sexual history is put at the forefront of the
political forum and is exploited by fellow candidates, including Gov. Fred
Picker (Larry Hagman in top form) who enters the race late - Picker may
intentionally remind you of Ross Perot. In order to defend himself against
verbal attacks and seemingly fabricated tape recordings, Jack enlists the help
of an old friend, Libby Holden (an intense Kathy Bates) a.k.a. "Dustbuster," a
lesbian, all-purpose troubleshooter who has no qualms about placing a gun on a
man's privates. </P>
<P>"Primary Colors" is based on the book of the same name by Anonymous (recently
known as political journalist Joe Klein), and it is rife with richly drawn
characters, an acidly sharp script by Elaine May, and astute direction by Mike
Nichols. It is a film that begins as comedy and slowly evolves into a dark
satire - a reproach of the process by which someone like Jack Stanton gets
elected despite the personal allegations. </P>
<P>"The War Room" is a vibrant, witty excursion into the presidential campaign of
1992 when then Gov. Clinton was running for office. The film follows the
campaign process via chief political strategist James Carville and adviser
George Stephanopolous, and is all set in the "war room," formerly a Little Rock
newspaper office. </P>
<P>Carville and Stephanopolous are two of the most charismatic characters I've
seen in a documentary (or film) in a long time, and they couldn't be more
opposite in their physical demeanor. Carville, in his Southern drawl, is always
actively making decisions whether it's about prepared speeches, the look of a
campaign poster, or arguing endlessly on the phone about the other candidates
or Clinton's past - "Every time somebody even farts the word 'draft,' it makes
the paper."         Stephanopolous is the more timid, quiet, reserved individual -
he reminds me a lot of Michael J. Fox's character Alex P. Keaton in "Family
Ties"; Fox subsequently played a variation of George in "The American
President." George is more subtle and calm than Carville, and operates in an
equally articulate manner. At one crucial point, George receives a call from a
black woman claiming to have given birth to Clinton's child. George convinces
the caller that she will be ridiculed in the press if she comes out with such a
sensational story. This scene is reminiscent of the scene in "Primary Colors"
where Stanton's advisers visit a teenage black girl claiming to have the
candidate's baby. </P>
<P>As directed by D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, "The War Room" is very keen
on details and conversations between staff and personnel regarding the plight
of the Clinton campaign. The atmosphere grows more and more tense as we get to
the inevitable climax where Clinton wins the nomination in the election
victory. On the eve of the election, Carville gives an emotional speech
regarding the strong effort he and his aides have made in helping Clinton, and
the positive effect politics has had on his life. George is even questioned by
the secretary as to how he feels: "Exhausted." </P>
<P>"The War Room" could have used more footage of Clinton and perhaps the
filmmakers could have catched him in truly private, unguarded moments as to how
he really felt about the adultery charges. Still, "The War Room" and "Primary
Colors" greatly succeed in capturing the political atmosphere and the
exhausting process in which a candidate is elected. The irony is that Clinton
and Stanton's adulterous affairs not only sidestepped their political agendas,
but made them stronger candidates for the presidency. In other words, give the
people what they want. </P>
