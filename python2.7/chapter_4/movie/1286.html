<PRE>                                  OVERSEAS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     OVERSEAS is a film by Brigitte Rouan, from a script by Rouan,
Philippe Le Guay, Christian Rullier, Cedric Kahn.  It stars Rouan,
Nicole Garcia, Marianne Basier, Philippe Galand, Yann Didet, Bruno
Todeschini.  Cinematography by Dominique Chapuis.  No rating, but
includes nudity.  In French with English subtitles.</P>
<P>     OVERSEAS is the story of three sisters living in French Algeria in
the period from after World War II until the return of de Gaulle to
power (and the imminent withdrawal of the French from Algeria).  The
story is told three times with each sister as the narrative focus each
time.  Each sister's reactions to the events around them is recorded:
one trapped by her provincialism and Catholicism has her sensuous
instincts blocked at every turn, and almost oblivious to the changes
happening around her; one is practical, but is pressured into marrying a
dreamer when she really wanted a strong man and winds up with one she
must protect from financial ruin and assassination; the third and
youngest is a volunteer nurse who crosses the line between the "colons" 
and the Algerian nationalists.</P>
<P>     Rouan as writer and director, ably assisted by cinematographer
Chapuis, controls and manipulates the three point-of-view stories deftly
and with great clarity, to say nothing of wit.  Each time we go through
a scene like the initial airplane landing we learn new details, see new
textures, understand more deeply what is really going on under the
surfaces and off in the shadows on the edges.  Rouan and Chapuis mix
naturalism with bold touches of near-Greenaway stylizations.</P>
<P>     Her achievement will make one think of Kurosawa's RASHOMON and the
novels of Virginia Woolf, but she keeps to her own vision and purpose in
exposing the injustices and beauty of Algeria's colonial past.  She
creates an indictment of and an homage to the *colons* and the
Algerians.</P>
<P>     I highly recommend this highly crafted, witty, ironic, and
insightful film at full price.  I hope you get a chance to see it.</P>
