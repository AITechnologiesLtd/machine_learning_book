<PRE>               A film review by Joshua McAdams</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Joshua McAdams</PRE>
<P>        The movie "Private Parts", starring popular radio personality
Howard Stern, documents the rise of a obscure kid from sub-urban New
York who becomes the self-crowned "King of All Media." Director Betty
Thomas paints by numbers over an Ivan Reitman comedic template that
had given us such films as "Ghostbusters" and "Stripes." In this time
test formula the hero gets laughs while battling an oppressive
establishment that wants to shackle all that is funny and good in the
world. Throughout the film the audience is blatantly  manipulated into
routing for the shock-jock. Poor Howard is constantly belittled and
picked on by everyone from his father to the WNBC program manager. He
is ridiculed by other performers for his Fartman act at the MTV Music
Awards. Meanwhile the guy carries on a romance with his beloved wife
Allison that is straight out of Brothers Grimm fairy tales. When he
finally gets some clout he uses it to stand up to the evil corporate
lawyers and management types that want to tone down his radio show. In
the end Howard spells out (for anyone who missed the first ninety
minutes) how misunderstood he has been his whole life and how is
really just a loving father and husband. Message received loud and
clear.</P>
<P>"Private Parts" reminds me of a book I read in high school.
Its called "Fahrenheit 451". It a prophetic novel by Ray Bradbury
that deals with a society devoid of books and completely dependent on
television. Truth and fiction have become so ambiguous that only the
weather is immune to manipulation. People become like drones willing
to accept what ever form of reality is offered to them.  Welcome to
the United States of America circa 1997.</P>
<P>You see I dont like or dislike the man personally nor do I
have any objection to any of his humor. Ive listen to his radio show
before on many occasions and have seen him of E! Entertainment
Television where Howard has a half hour show. I never read the book on
which "Private Parts" basicly because I wasnt really interested in
what a radio disc jockey would write about. Of course plenty of people
were extremely interested in what Stern was saying - the book became a
bestseller. Its not really the vulgarity of his shows that attracts
me, its the spontaneity of the individual. Like his WNBC program
director is told in the movie, people tune in because you never know
what Howard is going to say next. Unfortunately, in "Private Parts"  I
knew exactly what was going to happen next.</P>
<P>This film is not about Howard as much as it is for Howard and
his handlers. The man needs more mainstream appeal in order to sell
future movie projects. Enter the Hollywood machine which cranks out a
thinly veiled piece of propaganda and then creates a marketing
blitzkrieg surrounding it. People flock to it because of star
recognition and curiosity, they leave assured that Howard is really a
sweet guy, unfairly persecuted by a conservative society of idiots in
seal suits.   They may never hear his caustic humor that ended up
costing him almost two million in fines from the FCC. They may never
see the pornographic pay per view specials that netted him over twenty
million dollars.  They will never witness his treatment of women and
mental handicapped people. While I find of this type of corrupting and
infectious humor to be extremely funny, the mass audience may not have
approved. Then again, he would have never become the media behemoth
that he is by catering to family values.</P>
<P>Its shocking how much this film behaves like a marketing
infomercial for the kinder, gentler Howard.  I almost expected to see
a preview for some high concept comedy starring Stern to run before
"Private Parts." Howard and Jim Carey are wacky Siamese twins joined
at the waist in the 1998 release of "Oh, Brother!"  Or maybe, as
rumored,  Shumacher will put him in the  Batman serial as the
Scarecrow opposite the next  actor to prostitute himself as the cape
crusader. Either way both Howard and those who hold his leash are
looking at significant returns.</P>
<P>Incredibly Private Parts has not only been well accepted by
the general public(who may be helpless after years of idiotic sitcoms)
but also by critics who are supposed to protect us from the
unscrupulous designs of the movie business. Films should be
trade-offs, you take my seven bucks but I get something in return. It
could be a good, entertaining story, it could be(but usually isnt)
some though provoking insight. If all the filmmaker is doing is
polishing a persons image then you come off feeling like a hooker who
not only gets rode hard but is stiffed on her fee as well. </P>
<P>To me, Stern comes off not as the All American anti-hero but
as the Benidict Arnold of entertainment, selling out his hard core
antics in favor of the marginalized profits of world-wide super
stardom. Some may claim the humor make for a better movie, I think it
serves to disguise the true purpose of the what you are watching. If
you are busy laughing at jokes about genitalia how much objective
thinking can one do? To her credit,  Betty Thomas tries to show
Howard in all of his glory, behind the microphone stirring up trouble,
but I imagine her hands were tied by powers from on high from the word
Go. But we arent talking about historical accuracy or artistic
integrity here, were talking money. We are talking box office. We are
talking sequel.  Cha-Ching!</P>
<PRE>        Rating: Dont see this movie. Dont see it on video. Its not</PRE>
<PRE>        only pointless and processed, its mind control.</PRE>
