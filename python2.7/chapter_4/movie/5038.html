<P>     The script for I SHOT ANDY WARHOL began life as a documentary 
before the producers convinced writer/director Mary Harron to transform 
it into a dramatic interpretation.  The result is an impressive feature 
debut -- a provocative look at Valerie Solanas, the intellectual, 
possibly psychotic prefeminist who shot Warhol in 1968.  In the wake of 
NICO ICON, a documentary about The Velvet Underground and their lead 
singer, this film represents the next (and certainly not last) motion 
picture to plunge into the strange, experimental world surrounding Andy 
Warhol and his Factory.</P>
<P>     Most of I SHOT ANDY WARHOL takes place in New York City from 1966 
to 1968, chronicling the period in Valerie Solanas' (Lili Taylor) life 
when she wrote her definitive work, SCUM MANIFESTO, was introduced to 
Andy Warhol (Jared Harris), became a fringe member of his circle, and 
eventually shot him.  Valerie, who had a "pitiful childhood" 
characterized by abuse and molestation, is subversive and disturbed, but 
many of her theories, as outlandish as they initially seem, are 
consistent, logical, and thought-provoking.</P>
<P>     SCUM, or the Society for Cutting Up Men, was the prefeminist 
organization formed by Valerie (she was also the only member).  It was 
founded on a number of basic principles -- the male is a biological 
accident, women are the naturally superior gender, the female function 
is to create a "magical world", and men are sex-obsessed machines.  THE 
SCUM MANIFESTO represents Valerie's legacy (it's still in print today).</P>
<P>     Those offended by the "male bashing" aspect of THELMA AND LOUISE 
may become apoplectic during I SHOT ANDY WARHOL.  Since the film is 
essentially a character study of Valerie, it gives an uncompromising 
presentation of her views and experiences.  She despises "men, married 
women, and other degenerates", and makes no secret of her feelings.  
She's a "butch dyke", and proud of it, and the only time she has any 
sexual interaction with men is when she gets paid.</P>
<P>     Lili Taylor, who, like Eric Stoltz, has gravitated towards 
independent features, gives a powerful, passionate portrayal, bringing 
out Valerie's anger and disgust with the world.  Like Jennifer Jason 
Leigh in MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE, Taylor makes us believe 
that we're watching Valerie, not just an actress playing her.  There 
won't be an Oscar nomination for this work, but recognition of some sort 
is warranted.</P>
<P>     There are two other notable performances in I SHOT ANDY WARHOL.  
The first, given by Jared Harris (the son of Richard Harris), is that of 
Warhol himself.  Harris manages to capture not only Warhol's strange 
magnetism, but his aloof, almost-shy nature.  Stephen Dorff (BACKBEAT) 
plays Candy Darling, Valerie and Warhol's transvestite companion.  
Supporting roles are filled by Martha Plimpton (as Valerie's best 
friend), Lothaire Bluteau (as Maurice Girodius, the publisher who buys 
the rights to Valerie's writing), and Tahnee Welch (as a member of 
Warhol's circle).</P>
<P>     I SHOT ANDY WARHOL presents a toned-down, nostalgic look at New 
York in the late 1960s as well as the subculture that took root around 
Warhol -- the wild, bohemian lifestyle, complete with drugs and sex.  
Primarily, however, this is Valerie's story -- an invitation to explore 
her theories and understand her motivation, even if you can't relate to 
such a disagreeable personality.  In fact, I SHOT ANDY WARHOL is daring 
because it makes no attempt to soften Valerie's character or blunt the 
downward spiral of her insanity.  This is a film of powerful ideas, 
impressive set design, and compelling performances.  It will offer 
fodder for hours of post-movie discussion.</P>
