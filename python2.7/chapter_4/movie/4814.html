<PRE>                          CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY
                       A film review by John Schuurman

<P>     The only bad thing about *Cry, the Beloved Country* is that its
run in the "big houses" has been so very short. It ran in Chicago a
scant two weeks. Doubtless the film has lost money for Miramax. One has
to wonder  why the studio decided to make the investment at all, what
with apartheid in South Africa being dismantled and all. It seems that
for a  movie whose prominent feature is a hated political system to
succeed,  the politics have to be current. But there is the rub. In my
eyes, the  thing that makes the movie work is that the cruel system of
oppression  is now a fresh but receding memory. Had the system been
current, the  movie would have been much more harsh and strident. The
political  agenda to break the hated system would have dominated (and
destroyed)  this work as a film.</P>
<P>     Now, given a small buffer of time since the real thing, it can
concentrate on being a redemption story set in a beautiful but
treacherous place. The memory of apartheid is fresh enough that it
doesn't have to be explained, it simply is the great pall that hangs
over the whole. The action of the movie then gets its poignancy and
becomes all the more refreshing as you see convergence and healing and
forgiveness take place under this shroud.</P>
<P>     "Cry" is a faithful remake of Alan Paton's great novel by the same
name. Rev. Stephen Kumalo, (a simple Zulu pastor given heroic
dimensions by the incomparable James Earl Jones) receives news that he
must go to the great and frightening city of Johannesburg to try to
rescue his sister and his son. He finds only tragedy. His sister is
reduced to the life of a prostitute and his son kills a man in a
botched robbery attempt.</P>
<P>     The fascinating thing of the movie is watching Kumalo put one
faithful foot after the other, never failing in his trust, always in
the scriptures or in prayer, looking to the Lord. Imagine a character
about whom a fellow pastor says, "There goes the only truly good man I
have ever known."</P>
<P>     Jones' portrayal of Kumalo is so good and moving he deserves the
big awards for the work. It is sad that he probably won't even be
noticed because of the failed economy of the thing.</P>
<P>     The great moments are the reconciliation moments between James
Jarvis (Richard Harris) a wealthy white racist landowner and Kumalo. As
the pious pastor and the supremacist farmer encounter each other, and
Kumalo tells Jarvis that it is his son who has killed Jarvis' boy, we
watch as recognition, hatred, and forgiveness are processed. That such
process can happen is our audacious hope in the face of our
post-apartheid, post-OJ, post million-man-march angst. This is a deeply
spiritual movie that  has come at just the right time. Too bad most
folks won't see it.</P>
