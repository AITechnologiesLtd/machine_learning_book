<P>Susan Granger's review of "THIS IS MY FATHER" (Sony Pictures Classics)</P>
<P>This Irish romantic drama is a uniquely personal collaboration
between first-time writer-director Paul Quinn and his brothers Aidan
Quinn ("Michael Collins," "Practical Magic") and Declan Quinn
(cinematographer on "Leaving Las Vegas," "One True Thing"). It's the
bittersweet story of a Chicago schoolteacher (James Caan) who travels
to Ireland to discover his roots and learns the sad, true "Romeo and
Juliet"-type tale of his mother and the father he never met. The
screenplay stemmed from a story the Quinns' Irish-born mother used to
tell about ill-fated lovers in her village. The couple's secret is
something the tight-lipped locals still refuse to discuss - 50 years
later. Told in flashback, Aidan Quinn plays Kieran, a shy tenant
farmer, who meets Fiona (Moya Farrelly), a lovely, free-spirited 17
year-old, and they fall in love. But her alcoholic mother, who owns
the farm on which Kieran works, disapproves because he's poor and a
bastard child.  Eventually, the community, mobilized by a tyrannical
priest (Stephen Rea), manages to separate them. The acting is
admirable with a stalwart supporting cast that includes John Cusack,
Colm Meaney, Brendan Gleeson, and Donal Donnelly.  The weakness of the
film is the contrived structure. Paul Quinn's tragic story-line is so
full of hackneyed interruptions that it loses its power - which is too
bad since the poetic imagery evokes a society smothering under the
weight of doomy superstition and inevitable tradition. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "This is My Father" is a gentle, moving 6. And
the family collaboration will continue as the Quinn brothers'
Ireland-based sister Marian is developing a script about four Dublin
girls.</P>
