<P> Forces of Nature (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Ben Affleck and Sandra
Bullock.</P>
<P> Sometimes we film critics can be a bit too smart for our own good.</P>
<P> We watch a few minutes of a movie, size up the characters and situations
and automatically assume we know what's going to transpire.</P>
<P> But then something strange and frightening happens, something that makes
going to the movies worthwhile - the filmmaker surprises us. He pulls the
cinematic rug out from under our feet and sends us sprawling on our
collective behinds.</P>
<P> Thus it is with "Forces of Nature," a comedy-road picture starring Ben
Affleck and Sandra Bullock.</P>
<P> He's the straight-arrow guy with the dull job - writing blurbs for book
covers.</P>
<P> She's the free spirit who has held every kind of job except rodeo clown.</P>
<P> They meet cute - he rescues her after their plane skids off the runway
during takeoff.</P>
<P> And they are forced to take a long journey together even though they are
incompatable opposites.</P>
<P> With all that, you literally connect the dots to the conclusion.
Or can you?</P>
<P> Screenwriter Marc Lawrence and director Bronwen Hughes lead you down that
garden path - with a few bumps - and then ...</P>
<P> Well, no more. You're going to have to see "Forces of Nature" to find out
the rest.</P>
<P> True, the characters are cliched and predictable, the situations familiar.
You know what is going to happen 10 minutes before it does.</P>
<P> The acting is simply by-the-numbers, for-the-paycheck. They don't seem to
be putting any effort into trying to breathe any credibility into their
characters.</P>
<P> Plus there's no chemistry. Affleck and Bullock merely seem to be spouting
lines at each other.  Both  have done better.</P>
<P> So, do yourself a favor. See the first 10 minutes of "Forces of Nature,"
then hang around the lobby for about an hour and a few minutes. Return to
see the last 10 minutes, go home and be satisfied.</P>
