<PRE>FAT GIRL
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Fit for a ghoul's night out, Fat Girl stands cast iron firm with the
simplistic, fatuous, built-in excuse that its woman director is baring
the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls.  Being a boy, I might
not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this
particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story.  Fair enough.  I'll
pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and Health Class 101 "this is a
no-no" dialogue when Older Teenage Boy coaxes Younger Teenage Girl to
let him fuck her up the ass, speaking variations on "It won't hurt!" for
a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes.  This is done almost
entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative
camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism.  They dare you to look away,
without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually
sound like children (they're mouthpieces for writer-director Catherine
Breillat's one-note clinical politics).</P>
<P>Rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal
change, Breillat (previously responsible for the unwatchable Romance)
wants to indulge in her hour of hate.  Life is pain, highness.  Get used
to it.  She'd find keen bedfellows in Neil LaBute and Todd Solondz,
other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or
honest.  For children, dealing with trauma and pain is complicated.  To
bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap.  These would-be
auteurs (more like hauteurs) haven't earned the right to display
suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth (as Mike Leigh
does throughout Naked and David Lynch in several key scenes of Blue
Velvet).  Of course, there I go again comparing her to all these
(better) male directors.  I don't care.  Gender be damned, she's
borderline inept.</P>
<P>Braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd (mortified
shock or compulsory applause will suffice), writer-director Catherine
Breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people. 
Don't be fooled.  This grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays
into passion may be quickly forgotten, remembered only as cold, boring,
philosophically arid, and incompetently photographed.  The hyperviolent
climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that I honestly
wondered whether Breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence.</P>
<P>Twelve years old, a bundle of dough with a sour pout, the superb Anaïs
Reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a
frumpy insouciance.  (Her character is also named Anaïs.)  Sitting at
the table morosely slurping down a banana split, her presence is
grounded and heartbreaking.  It's a pity Breillat never finds anything
for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook
sister, 15-year old Elena (Roxane Mesquida), for bringing a transitory
boyfriend home to their shared room.  In this summer cottage, Anaïs has
no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to Elena's
depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance.  The boy in question, a
smug Italian college kid named Fernando (Libero De Rienzo) is a real
piece of work, claiming that the experience is a declaration of love
while begging for a blowjob.</P>
<P>Anaïs doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents, who
join Elena in making fun of her hefty girth.  She finds pleasure in
wandering the beach alone, singing songs to herself, and swimming in the
pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour. 
Reboux commands the screen, but there's only so much a child actress can
do recounting pretentious monologues to herself.  If one is inspired to
rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie, at least
she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense
love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically
misguided.</P>
<P>This 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show, but Breillat
saves her nastiest poison for the very end.  On the long ride home
punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members, gigantic
trucks swerve by as the hour grows late.  Will mommy fall asleep at the
wheel?  Perhaps.  Or maybe there's something deadlier around the corner,
lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting Fat Girl.  What's more,
she might even like it.  With the intent of being unfair and
unpredictable, placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in
order to face up to impending adulthood, Breillat's extreme flourish of
sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt.  Fat
Girl is a bitter pill indeed.</P>
<P>Aka À ma soeur!  Screened at the 2001 New York Film Festival (feature
coming soon).</P>
