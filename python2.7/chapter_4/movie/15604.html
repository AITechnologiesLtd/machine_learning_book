<P>If you're going to make a two-hour Hollywood in-joke, why bother
releasing it to the general public?  If you're going to create a film
that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and People Who Know Woody
Allen, then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in
theaters?  While watching Celebrity, I realized that Allen had only
marginal interest in creating a story about real people.  What he really
wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited
self-deprecation.  Celebrity is yet another film in which Allen tells a
story about himself, living in a world that he's familiar with, dealing
with people like the ones he actually knows.</P>
<P>Allen recruited poor Kenneth Branagh to bumble through this picture, in
an imitation of Allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film
more.  Branagh plays Lee Simon, a journalist-turned-screenwriter who
divorces his wife, Robin (Judy Davis), shacks up with some hot women
(Famke Janssen, Charlize Theron, Winona Ryder), and goes about trying to
get big stars (Melanie Griffith, Leonardo DiCaprio) to read his script
about an armored car robbery.  The usual elements of recent Allen films
are all here, including the sexual insecurity of the main character,
lots of self-loathing women, and a tiring continuum of episodes that are
only loosely related to one another.  </P>
<P>Unless you work in the film industry or know Woody Allen personally,
it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in Celebrity. 
Aside from all the in-jokes, the story falls far short of compelling,
and the characters are all empty and lifeless.  Branagh proves once
again that he's a superb performer, nailing his imitation of Allen
flawlessly.  The problem is that he's the same character Allen always
plays, a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch.  I
mean, come on, how many times have you seen this guy? -- he hates his
work, and he can't be satisfied by any one woman, and, at the end of the
movie, nothing has been solved.  He brings all of his problems upon
himself (crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio, and other
such stunts), so it's pretty hard to care about him.  In addition, isn't
Allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him?  I know
he is, but he didn't do it in Celebrity.</P>
<P>The vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not
recaptured in the supporting performances.  Davis, playing the same
woman with low self-esteem that she played in Deconstructing Harry, has
a few touching moments, but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type
that fills the rest of the movie.  Some of the actresses are saved
because of their beauty -- Theron and Ryder, especially -- but they're
not likable people.  Only Famke Janssen, as a book editor interested in
Simon's new novel, has any life.  The men in the picture don't do much
better -- Joe Mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries Robin,
while DiCaprio, as a Christian Slater/Johnny Depp-type spoiled young
actor, is funny but disengaging.</P>
<P>What's really insulting about Celebrity is how dull and standard its
"themes" are.  Allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie
about the way "normal" people look at celebrities.  The main problem
with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify,
Simon, is not a "normal" guy -- he's just as entrenched in the Hollywood
image as the rest of the characters.  The other problem is that the
image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view
the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic, interesting
characters; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring
dialogue.  In addition, Allen decides he needs a scene in which the
theme is expressed explicitly (Robin, in this scene, says something
like, "It's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we
celebrate!").  </P>
<P>Celebrity is arguably Allen's biggest misfire to date.  It does have a
few good scenes -- Theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of
funny, and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the
film shown us a character or two.  But Celebrity is a failure at the
core, unless Allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about
himself and his friends.  If he wanted to make his audience feel like
they were on the outside of a big joke, then he succeeded in that.  I,
for one, don't enjoy feeling like an outsider.  </P>
