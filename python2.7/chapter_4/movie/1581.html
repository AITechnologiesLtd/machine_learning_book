<PRE>                                   RUSH
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>117 min., R, Drama, 1992
Director: Lili Fini Zanuck
Cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jason Patric, Sam Elliott, Max Perlich,
      Gregg Allman, Tomy Frank, William Sadler, Special K. McCray</P>
<P>     Undercover narcotics cop Jason Patric has to take on a partner.  He
picks new cadet Jennifer Jason Leigh.  They are put out on the streets
to catch drug dealer Gregg Allman.  While investigating, they find
themselves becoming addicted to drugs.</P>
<P>     I was going to see RUSH in the theaters the weekend it opened, but
it opened the same weekend as THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.  I went to
see that instead and was going to see RUSH the next weekend.  The next
weekend RUSH had already closed so now I have seen it on video and
because of the lack of reviews on it when it came out, I decided to
write one.  RUSH is the best narcotics film that I have seen since
DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  On a scale of zero to five, I give the film a five.
RUSH is rated R for explicit language, adult situations, and graphic
violence.</P>
<P>     The acting in the film is great.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of
her best performances in her career.  Jason Patric does a much better
job than usual.  His acting could have been improved a little, but he
still did a great job.  Max Perlich's character I liked least in the
film, but it was not because of Perlich's acting, it was just the
character.  This film is not heavy on action at all, it is mostly drama
(which is misleading from some of the advertisements for the film, so be
forewarned).</P>
<P>     The story is written extremely well.  It kept my interest
throughout and didn't fall into many Hollywood cliches (although there
was a slight problem at the ending in this respect).  The film shows the
gritty downside to being a undercover narcotics officer, and because of
how well it does this, it makes the film excellent viewing.  I think the
thing that drowned this film at the box office was that it is not a
traditional Hollywood film, so it wasn't able to find the audience that
it needed.  It also most likely got left in the dust with films like THE
HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE and BASIC INSTINCT out.  Now that it is on
video I think that it will find the audience that it deserves.</P>
<P>     If you have not yet seen this film, I strongly urge you to rent it.
It is definitely worth what ever price you pay and will provide you with
almost two hours of pure enjoyment (but be prepared to be sad in some
parts).</P>
