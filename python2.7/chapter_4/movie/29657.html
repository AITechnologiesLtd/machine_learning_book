<PRE>ZOOLANDER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Having a poke at the fashion industry (and, more specifically, its
preening portfolio of male models) doesn't exactly take a degree in rocket
science but Ben Stiller takes a stab at it anyway in "Zoolander," his
latest turn behind the camera.  It's obvious from the turgid Bond-ian
opening that something is amiss, and you quickly wonder just how long
Stiller, the put-upon star of "Meet the Parents" and the occasional
director of such films as "Reality Bites" and "The Cable Guy," can drag
this catwalk spectacle out.</P>
<PRE>        Not long it seems.</PRE>
<P>        Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the toast of the fashion world and, as the
film opens, is up for Male Model of the Year for an unprecedented fourth
time (he's won three years in a row).  Apart from being terribly
good-looking (his words not theirs), Derek has perfected The Look.  He
calls one of its several manifestations Blue Steel, an edgy glance to
camera, eyebrows tight, lips pursed in a half-kiss, half-smile.  It's a
look that can be seen all over town--on billboards, on magazine covers,
everywhere.  Le Tigre is another one (it's exactly the same look).  He's
working on a new one--Magnum--but after nine years it's still not perfected.</P>
<P>        The only threat to Derek's throne is a blue-eyed blond supermodel named
Hansel.  Played by Owen Wilson (from "Shanghai Noon"; he also played
opposite Stiller in "Meet the Parents"), Hansel is every bit as
handsome--and intellectually impaired--as his rival.  These two pretty
dimwits go at in on the runway and just about every fashion world cliché
gets trampled on in the process.  There's also a plot to kill the prime
minister of Malaysia!</P>
<P>        Stiller must be a popular guy in Hollywood these days because his film is
populated with a veritable Who's Who of television and movie talent.  Many
of these, like David Duchovny, David Bowie, and Winona Ryder, show up for
brief scenes and disappear soon after and some (like Gary Shandling and
Vince Vaughn) don't even get a speaking part.  But they clearly wanted to
be in Ben's picture.  I can understand that: Stiller's a terrifically funny
guy (and I mean that most sincerely: he's the *only* reason to ever rent
"Mystery Men"!).</P>
<P>        So how come "Zoolander" misses the mark?  Perhaps its subject matter is
simply too obvious and the jokes simply not funny enough.  If you're going
to take such an easy target you have to do something special with it but
Stiller, who co-wrote the movie with Drake Sather and John Hamburg based on
a VH-1/Vogue Fashion Awards character from five years ago, never really
moves the humor a notch above silly.  There are certainly chuckles to be
found here--it's hard watching anyone, let alone Stiller, who seems to have
a natural and uncanny aptitude for physical comedy, posing and posturing
and prancing around in silly outfits to Frankie Goes to Hollywood without
cracking a smile--but "Zoolander" never pushes the envelope, never touches
on inspired.  It's frivolous and not much more.</P>
<P>        Co-starring Will Ferrell as a poodle-coiffed designer named Mugatu, Milla
Jovovich as his butch henchwoman, Christine Taylor (still a dead ringer for
"The Brady Bunch"'s Marcia) as the love interest and, oh, Ben's Dad Jerry,
"Zoolander" is another one of those "Saturday Night Live"-styled sketches
dragged out in perpetuity.  The most disappointing thing about Stiller's
film, however, is that all it appears to be saying is that male models
don't seem to have a lot between the ears.  There.  I just saved you eight
bucks.</P>
