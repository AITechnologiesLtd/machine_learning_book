<PRE>>From Here To Eternity
Director: Fred Zinneman
Starring: Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra,
Deborah Kerr, Ernest Borgnine
Running Time: 129 Min
Drama/B&W</PRE>
<P>The fifties provided some of the greatest films in the history of cinema. New
ideas were developed, new themes explored. Anti and post-war feelings ran
high in Hollywood, and, as a result, films like From Here To Eternity were
made. This Oscar winning picture has ranked among the greatest films ever
made, and with good reason.</P>
<P>>From Here To Eternity takes a hard look at the American Army during World War
II. Corrupt officers, rebellious privates, and an emotionally unstable
Seargent are the focus of this cinematic masterpiece. Mostly, it chronicles a
brief period in the lives of Private Pruit (Clift) and Seargent Warden
(Lancaster), their loves and their sense of duty and honor. </P>
<P>This picture offers filmmaking excellence at every turn. Each main actor
gives the performance of his or her career, particularly Clift, Lancaster,
Sinatra and Reed. (The latter two both won supporting Oscars for thier work
in the film.) Clift is masterful as Pruit, and after viewing this film, (or
re-viewing it, if it has been a while) one cannot imagine anyone else in the
role. He portrays his character with such depth and subtle emotion that a
film about his life prior to where the film picks it up would be thoroughly
engrossing.</P>
<P>Zinneman brings together all the elements of the film brilliantly. His edits
between scenes of Warden and Pruit courting their respective loves are
flawless. In one sequence, he dissolves the crashing waves of one cathartic
episode between Lancaster and Kerr into the rippling smoke of Clift's
cigarette as he opens up for the first time to Donna Reed. </P>
<P>As all the men grow gradually restless on the base, subtle visuals warning of
the attack on Pearl Harbor creep into the frame. Lancaster leans against the
wall while on the telephone, for the first time making us aware of any
time-related element; the calendar shows December 6th. Shortly thereafter, he
moves along a boardwalk , pausing in front of a directional marker, showing,
amongst other things, a sign reading "Pearl Harbor 8m". And on the morning of
the strike, a clock looms in the background, clearly showing ten minutes to
eight, the first bomb hits seconds later. The attack sequence includes
authentic war footage that blends well with the staged action.</P>
<P>This 8 Oscar motion picture helped define the filmmaking of the fifties. It
manages to express anti-war, and in many cases anti-military sentiment while
never allowing us a moment away from a military man. Daniel Taradash won a
well deserved award for his brilliant screenplay. He has each main character
starving for release from what they claim to be their one true love, the
Army. While Warden becomes involved with his superior's wife, Pruit is
falling for a woman who is paid to keep men company in a private club. Each
man picks an emotionally dangerous (and in some respects career-threatening)
situation to break the drudgery of their military lives. The dialogue is
realistic and involving, and each character speaks to us from an emotional
level.</P>
<P>>From Here To Eternity should be viewed by anyone with a respect for fantastic
filmmaking. It begs for a repeat viewing from those who havn't seen it in
ages, and it needs to be seen by anyone who has never had the pleasure. </P>
<P>Four out of Four stars
