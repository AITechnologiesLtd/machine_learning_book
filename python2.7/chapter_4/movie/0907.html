<PRE>                                 THE GRIFTERS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A lot of impressive names cooperated to
     create a surprisingly unimpressive film noir crime story.
     This film pulls its punches by throwing in absurdities at the
     wrong moment and has at least one surprisingly vicious scene.
     Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     A "grifter" is a con-man (nobody calls them "con-persons"), someone who
makes a living by fraud.  There are little cons and big cons.  A small con
will net pocket change and maybe a busted jaw.  A big con can net in the
millions and can get you killed.  Con men have been portrayed as likable in
THE FLIM FLAM MAN and THE STING.  They are seen with a kind of dark awe in
HOUSE OF GAMES.  Perhaps the most realistic view and by far one of the
dirtiest is in THE GRIFTERS, anew film with a superb pedigree that still
disappoints.  What is the pedigree?  It was a novel by Jim Thompson, a
crime-story writer who is only now, after his death, reaching his greatest
popularity.  The film adaptation of his AFTER DARK, MY SWEET is also in
current release.  Thompson also occasionally did screen work, co-scripting
one of the great films of all time, Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY.  Thompson's
GRIFTERS was adapted for the screen by Donald Westlake, himself a popular
crime novelist and author of books such as BANK SHOT.  The film was produced
by Martin Scorsese, who directed film noir crime films such as MEAN STREETS
and TAXI DRIVER, and directed by Stephen Frears, who also directed MY
BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE, SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID, and DANGEROUS LIAISONS.  As
close as it would be possible to have a spectacular film noir film, this is
it.  Still, this turns out to be just an adequate crime story, little more.</P>
<P>     The film concerns three grifters.  First there is 25-year-old Roy
Dillon (played limply by John Cusack).  Then there is his 39-year-old mother
Lily Dillon (played by the oddly mis-cast Anjelica Huston).  Unusually mis-
castings have a pretty person cast where someone grittier is needed.  Here
it may be the reverse.  Lily looks old enough to be Roy's mother.  The story
calls for her to be Roy's mother without looking it.  She is supposed to
look young and attractive, and while Ms. Huston really is the right age for
the role--she was born in 1952--she looks too old for the role and dressing
her in a sexy dress and stiletto heels does not do it.  The third vertex of
this dark triangle is Myra (played by Annette Bening), a bouncy young
grifter with a background for big grifts.  Often her bounces are out of her
clothes and onto a bed, particularly when big money is involved.  She wants
to partner up with Roy in more ways than one, but she and Lily are just too
similar and know too much about each other to get along.</P>
<P>     (I will try to avoid spoilers in what follows but there will be minor
spoilers.)</P>
<P>     What is wrong with this story?  Why is this only an adequate crime
story?  First, the plotting is less complex than you would expect.  You have
three devious characters and one would expect a really devious plot, but it
fails to materialize.  There are no big surprises in the plotting.  The
viewer never really feels grifted by the script.  Second, parts of this film
really do not make sense.  The climax of the film is contrived and if it is
not a physical impossibility, it is a very strong physical improbability.
In another incident, a bullet is fired and the police conclusion about the
incident seems completely inconsistent with what would have been the
trajectory of the bullet.  It is almost comical to imagine the incident as
the police must be picturing it to create the required trajectory.  While
the previous problem in physics is probably from the novel, the trajectory
problem seems to be Frears not thinking out the scene ahead of time and
could have been avoided.</P>
<P>     This is not a bad film, it just fails to  materialize into a very good
one.  The scenes that should carry the dramatic impact lose it because of
small absurdities.  In my opinion, this film has been over-rated.  It would
have made a decent black-and-white in the 1940s and it still is just about
that good.  My rating is +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
