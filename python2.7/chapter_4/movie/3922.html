<PRE>                                 THE NET
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     Although THE NET sells itself as a hip thriller and master of the
Internet, it is really just warmed over soup. It has none of the charm
or eye-popping wonder of JUMPIN' JACK FLASH, by which even the ignorant
among us were held in thrall to the mystery that unfolded on the then
unfamiliar monitor.</P>
<P>     We wait longingly to be pulled into the excitement, to care about
the people and the cause, but director Irwin Winkler cannot make a
thriller of a script full of holes. Midway, we know we've been taken.
It's just a recycled chase film with Cyberspace aspirations. The
filmmakers are telling us that something diabolically clever is going
on on-screen, but we are unworthy of knowing the details.</P>
<P>     Maybe it's not quite that bad. Sandra Bullock makes a fine heroine
of Angela, a computer expert whose specialty is fixing other people's
systems. She's a solid presence to be trusted, a vulnerable person we
can root for. Somewhere out there, in a clever program called "Mozart's
Ghost," she tangles with "The Iceman," a cold, smart hacker who stays
one step ahead of Angela throughout the confusion.</P>
<P>     The Iceman, a.k.a. Jack Devlin, is an old-fashioned stalker with
newfangled weapons. The battlefield is familiar:  the open sea, dark
stair wells, a crowded convention floor with a villain on the loose.
The centerpiece, of course, is the endangered woman. Instead of the
secret codes or microfilms of yore, it's a disk that she guards.</P>
<P>     Jack wants that disk, and to get it, he erases Angela's identity
both on the computer and in the real world. It's a good premise, the
worst extension of our fears of the computer world.  During all this we
begin to understand that national security is somehow just as
endangered as Angela. Bring us in, Irwin Winkler!  But he doesn't. The
stakes are high, but what are they?</P>
<P>     When an audience isn't made part of the game, everything on-screen
turns dull. This is a flat and lazy movie. Can you believe you will see
yet another car approach a yawning drawbridge, another chase through a
whirling merry-go-ground?</P>
<P>     Watching Angela order pizza by computer while she solves software
dilemmas to a good musical score is a promising beginning. But Jack,
while properly scary in his evil, is a stalker whose footsteps we fear
without knowing why he hates our heroine. Sandra Bullock and Jeremy
Northam are let down badly by their scriptwriters and director, who set
them adrift in the debris of an undefined plot.</P>
<P>     Although there is periodic suspense, how can we be really scared
when we don't understand the enemy?  The unfrocking of the mastermind
in the final frames carries no punch because we never wondered who he
was in the first place. By now you must be asking about the cause of
all the murder and mayhem. What was on that crucial disk?  We still
don't know, and that's the problem.</P>
