<P>  Ireland is magical place. To tourists, at least, the country is
a verdant paradise whose misty climate yields beautiful
complexions on this earth's most beautiful women. No
wonder, then, that while one out of six Americans is of Irish
descent, more than fifty percent (a rough guess) of its
Hollywood actors might claim the Emerald Isle as their
ancestral homeland.</P>
<P>   But like the azure and gorgeous islands of the Caribbean,
the country is flawed by poverty.  Currently Ireland has a
twenty percent unemployment rate, while most of those lucky
enough to have kissed the Blarney Stone and found jobs are
not about to find themselves ever among the Fortune 500. 
But poverty, in rare instances, can give way to fame and
fortune.  Take Frank McCourt, for example.  He turned his
dirt-poor, abused background in a veritable pig sty into a
cash cow for himself.  His book, "'Tis," is currently the
number one New York Times best-seller and the story of his
earlier days, "Angela's Ashes," made the same list in 1996.
Why so?  After all, most of the world's people are poor--dirt
poor when compared to middle-class Americans--and a fair
number of these destitute folks have risen by their bootstraps. 
So what puts McCourt's books over the top?  I'd say the
writing.  When he learned at the age of 15 that he could
make his words dance--from the time he began writing
threatening letters for a Limerick moneylender--he was on his
way to shucking the bicycle he had been using as a deliverer
of telegrams, squeezed together enough money (literally by
hook and crook), and took off for the United States to escape
his indigence.</P>
<P>   Alan Parker's filmed version follows the highlights of the
1996 autobiography, giving the audience at least a taste of
just about every dramatic occurrence of the volume.  Andrew
Bennett's periodic narration fills us in to details which could
not be effectively dramatized while at the same time giving us
an encounter with McCourt's way with words.  We're on our
way into the life of a man from age five to age fifteen, a life
that is alternately bleak and fun-filled, with incidents both
morose and humorous.  Michael Seresin's camera lens is
bathed in light green not so much to symbolize the lushness
of Ireland but to signify the dreary, rain-soaked misery of the
poor sections of Limerick where most of the story is filmed.</P>
<P>   Young Frank (Joe Breen), the kid whose adorable, freckle-
faced mug is on the ads for the film, did not have to wait long
for tragedy to hit his family.  When he was five years old he
witnessed the deaths of one brother and one sister, attending
a burial ceremony that was financed by the standard church-
sponsored giver of charity in the town.  His family is poor not
so much because of the numbers of brothers and sisters he
has but because Ireland as a whole was suffering from the
bad times of the 1930s and Frank's dad (Robert Carlyle) was
using the meager money he received on the dole to support
the Guinness family.  The McCourts trekked from Brooklyn to Limerick,
perhaps to escape the poverty they faced in the Williamsburg
section, only to land in an Ireland which could not grant them
so much as a lavatory in the hall.  Much is made of the way
the neighbors would use the drainpipe outside the McCourt
shack to pour their slop buckets, which emitted an odor which
one tenant advised would require the use of gas masks
during the warm weather.  The "lobby" of the building was
permanently under water, the three-member welfare board
would show their contempt for the family's pleas in the
presence of scores of other applicants, and all the teachers
save one would take pleasure in slapping the hands of any
boys who did not know that Eamon de Valera and Michael
Collins were the greatest men who ever lived.  </P>
<P>   Frank McCourt's poverty was apparently worse than that of
the other kids in the school.  In one instance he had to wear
shoes so broken-down and glued together that the entire
population of young pupils roared with laughter.  When Frank
would return to his home, life was no better, as the people in
his family on the side of his mother Angela (Emily Watson)
showed their contempt for the Northern Ireland background of
Frank's dad.  </P>
<P>   Home, Church, School and Government failed the
McCourts, though much of the humor in the movie comes
from the confessions that the 10-year-old Frank (Ciaran
Owens) and the 15-year-old boy (Michael Legge) give in
church.  When Frank reaches the mature age of 15 he enjoys
his first pint, has his first brief affair with an older girl afflicted
with consumption, and takes the big step of returning alone to
America while his mother continues prostituting herself to the
building's landlord.  His dad is permanently abroad in
England despite his statement that he wouldn't give that
country "the steam off my piss."</P>
<P>   The difference between this successfully adapted version
of "Angela's Ashes" and other movies that center on
extended progeny like the highly marketed "Magnolia" is that
the former always feels as though it is dealing with real
people suffering real problems while almost everything about
"Magnolia" is contrived.  Watching the film, you gain a greater
appreciation of America, a land which during the 30s and 40s
is glorified by the most scholarly of Frank's teacher as a
Shangri-La.  There is even a mock Statue of Liberty atop one
of the buildings that reminds us of a similar effigy held aloft
on one majestic day in Beijing's Tienanmen Square.  We get
more of a sense of why so many people from so many
foreign lands have come to America's shores, not only for
economic opportunity but for a sense of freedom from the
taunts of people whose races and religions and lifestyles are
different from their own.  Nowhere in the U.S. do we witness
the scandalous friction between Catholics and Protestants
suggested in this film, and presumably even the poorest
people with roofs over their heads have lavatories available
to them.  "Angela's Ashes" is a gem for the sort of audience
that needs no fast-cutting and no contrived conflicts, but a
real story about real people with real problems.  Is this the
sort of film that Hollywood studios like Paramount and
Universal should continue supporting?</P>
