<P>Making the jump from television series to major American motion picture
is a timeless and storied art mastered by few directors and filmmakers.
At first glance, the transition might not seem nearly as difficult as it
is, but upon closer examination it becomes apparent that the differences
between the two media are large enough to cause significant problems.
The episodic fallback of TV - that is, if it doesn't happen this week,
it can always happen next week - is not present; and directors who have
become used to directing forty-two-minute segments must suddenly deal
with at least ninety and sometimes upwards of 120 minutes of footage.
THE AVENGERS, a spinoff of the popular 1960's British show of the same
name, is neither the first nor the last to fail at making the jump; if
anything, its failure to come together was imminent enough. </P>
<P>Everyone involved here has seen better days, including Director Jeremiah
Chechik. His last big-screen feature, DIABOLIQUE, was a suspenseful and
engaging mystery thriller. Here, his work approaches comic book
territory in an ignorant fashion similar to that of the last two BATMAN
features. The characters are larger than life - in a bad sense - and are
never quite on the audience's level. All three principals are played by
A-list names, but each of the three have seen better days. Connery's
work here is uncharacteristically drab, and not since 1996's THE ROCK
has he been much fun. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, too, are fine for
the roles apart but fail to start much in the way of romantic chemistry
together. </P>
<P>If anything, the movie is fun to watch for several reasons, although you
may have trouble convincing a friend to see the movie with you. Even
though Connery is rather drab, it's been over two years since the
infamous Brit has been on the scene; any dialogue he speaks is
invariably fun to listen to. Also, the movie's one bit of vulgar
language comes both from an unlikely character and at a horribly
unlikely moment; it's over and done so fast that you might not believe
your ears. Finally, in typical comic book fashion, the bad guys are
surly, hulking fellows with third-grade vocabularies or women in tight
catsuits. Both elicit attention from the audience, for varying reasons
and lengths of time. </P>
<P>But any ground made there is lost in the terribly convoluted and
laborious plot that THE AVENGERS sports. John Steed (Fiennes) and Emma
Peel (Thurman) are suave and debonaire secret agents, charged with
finding the cause in a recent sabotage of a British defense mechanism
called Prospero. Prospero, it seems, has the ability to create a weather
"shield" around the British Isles should the Union Jack come under
siege. In the wrong hands (August de Wynter, played by Connery), though,
the controllable weather turns into an extortion plan. De Wynter will
bombard the isles with typhoons and lightning unless paid an appropriate
sum. Several questions are left completely or partially unanswered
throughout the movie, including an Emma Peel clone. Overall, THE
AVENGERS is too goofy to be much fun; and with luck its box office
returns will be nil, sparing us of a sequel.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "THE AVENGERS": 1.5 stars - a below average movie.</P>
