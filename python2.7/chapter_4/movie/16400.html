Reviewed January 20, 1999.</P>
<P>Every great once in a while, a mainstream, big-budget studio picture 
will come along and miraculously restore your faith in Hollywood, due to 
its ingeniously fresh ideas and the courage to not stick with the 
practicalities of any certain genre. After viewing the mind-numbing 
"Virus," I immediately saw "In Dreams," directed by Neil Jordan (1992's 
"The Crying Game" and 1994's "Interview With the Vampire"), which is one 
of the most consistently disturbing, surprising, and visually beautiful 
motion pictures I have seen this decade.</P>
<P>In the eerily gorgeous opening sequence, we are informed that in the 
'60s the town of Northfield was completely flooded out to make way for a 
reservoir as we are shown the now 30-year-old ghost town that a group of 
forensic investigators are exploring underwater. Soon afterwards, we 
discover that they are searching for a little girl who was recently 
abducted by a serial killer. We then meet Claire Cooper (Annette 
Bening), a generally satisfied woman living in New England with her 
husband (Aidan Quinn), who flies 747s for a living, and young daughter, 
Rebecca (Katie Sagona), who is anxiously preparing for her school play 
of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." For a long time, Claire has been 
having a recurring dream about the missing girl, whom she sees in an 
apple orchard being led away by a person with red hair. She has reason 
to believe that she may, actually, hold the key to the child's 
disappearance until the murdered body of the girl is found nowhere near 
an apple orchard. Since "In Dreams" is so completely unpredictable and 
pleasing from beginning to end, I will have to tread carefully 
concerning what happens next so as not to give away any important plot 
points. Ultimately, a tragedy occurs involving Claire, and as she 
gradually becomes more and more haunted by the killer whom she thinks 
has found a way into her brain, and her dreams, which do hold the 
answers to what will happen in the future, the people around her, 
including her psychiatrist (Stephen Rea), start to believe that she is 
going out of her mind.</P>
<P>Like slasher films, the tried-and-true "serial killer" movie has been 
done to death in the last two decades, but it took a marvelous film like 
"In Dreams" to wondrously rejuvenate new life into the well-worn genre. 
So entirely imaginative and original this film is, I almost wasn't sure 
how to react while watching it. For a person who sees most every film 
that is released, whether it be in the theater or on video, it is easy 
for their senses to be deadened with all of the recycled junk that is 
made these days, but "In Dreams" is the complete polar opposite, with 
enough ingenuity and inventiveness for five movies. Not only that, but 
the film is one of the few I have seen in many years that I could 
actually say is frightening.</P>
<P>The cast in "In Dreams" is uniformly great, particularly Annette Bening, 
who is able to gain our outright sympathy despite her inevitable demise 
into madness. Bening has sparkled before, most notably in 1995's "The 
American President," but this is a new kind of role for her and she may 
very well give her best performance to date here. When Robert Downey Jr. 
finally shows up late in the picture, he comes off as one of the most 
believably menacing villains in memory with his almost "dead," monotone 
speech pattern and ill temper, to say the least.</P>
<P>It may only be the third week in January but I can already firmly state 
that there will not be a superior example of cinematography all year. 
Seldom before has a director of photography shown me such unforgettable 
and devastatingly ominous images as Darius Khonji ("Seven," "The City of 
Lost Children") does in this film. Every single representation is 
brought to glorious light, and some of the best examples would be the 
apple orchard; the underwater ghost town; the school play; and the 
Carlton Hotel. I could easily go on and on, going into great depth about 
these marvelous sights, and others, but I do not want to spoil the 
experience by giving away the smallest detail. For the whole 103-minute 
running time of "In Dreams," I was in a state of awe at everything I was 
seeing onscreen, and then utterly shocked by how little I could predict 
of what was going to happen. One particularly brilliant and intricately 
constructed sequence involves the same thing occurring to two different 
people in two different time periods, with the stories being seamlessly 
intercut with each other.</P>
<P>It is not too often that a film is released that actually has so many 
wonderful ideas, and it is an even rarer occurrence that these ideas are 
actually carried through all the way to the end. There are simply too 
many films to count that have gotten my hopes up, only to crush them 
during the conclusion, but "In Dreams" only got better, with a climax 
that I could never have foretold but that left me with a satisfied and 
unsettled feeling. For once, here is a film that does not condescend to 
its audience in any way, nor does it try to sugarcoat the dark subject 
matter, and as far as director Neil Jordan goes, this is his most 
accomplished piece of work yet. Almost always a film, at the least, does 
not live up to its trailer, which usually makes a picture look better 
than it actually is, but "In Dreams" also lived up to this great 
challenge. On its opening weekend, I was saddened to see that "In 
Dreams" only made about $4.6 million, and was well behind such Hollywood 
"flukes" as "Varsity Blues," "Patch Adams," and "Virus," since this film 
is infinitely more intelligent and creative than all of those films 
combined. "In Dreams" is a nightmarish, extraordinarily harrowing 
experience, and although only January, it is sure to remain one of the 
year's best films.</P>
