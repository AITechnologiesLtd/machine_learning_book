<P>     Sometimes the term "high concept" doesn't do a film justice.  Critics
are partly to blame, since we use the term perjoratively to refer to
studios' tendency to mix and match stars or previously successful film
plots to create easy-to-sell, easy-to-digest packages.  That certainly
doesn't describe THE TRUMAN SHOW, though the premise is about as high
concept as they come:  a 29-year-old man named Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)
gradually becomes aware that his entire life has been the subject of a
carefully controlled, 24-hour-a-day documentary/soap opera called "The
Truman Show," the most popular program in television history.  No, there's
nothing easy to digest about THE TRUMAN SHOW, which is exactly what makes
it so brilliant.  Masterfully conceived and executed, as thought-provoking
as it is hilarious, THE TRUMAN SHOW is everything studio film-making
should be but almost never is.</P>
<P>     It would be easy enough to praise the film to the skies simply for
creating its world so seamlessly.  Truman's fictional home-town of
Seahaven is brilliantly created by production designer Dennis Gassner as a
Disneyland-clean approximation of a small Florida community.  Unique
visual perspectives capture the way thousands of cameras pry into every
moment of Truman's life, from inside his car radio to behind his bathroom 
mirror. The film scores may of its best comic hits with running gags
about product placements in the commercial-free show -- Truman's
alarmingly cheery wife Meryl (Laura Linney) bringing home a new kitchen
tool; his best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) showing up with a six-pack of
beer any time there's trouble; two men who consistently position Truman
in front of an advertising poster on the street every time they meet.  For
nearly 45 minutes director Peter Weir permits only isolated intrusions
from the "real world" reacions of viewers, wrapping the viewer in the
inescapable "reality" in which Truman lives.</P>
<P>     The emotional content behind that premise makes THE TRUMAN SHOW far
more than a clever exercise in style.  Jim Carrey's performance as Truman
is deceptively complex, because he's playing a character who often behaves
with the forced good nature of a sit-come character.  Behind that facade,
however, is a man with inner life repeatedly thwarted by the "plot" of
"The Truman Show."  His childhood dreams of exploring are re-programmed
with childhood trauma so he'll never want to leave his sound stage
community; his one true love (Natscha McElhone), the extra who tries to
tell him the truth about his life, is yanked away from him, leaving him to
reconstruct her from magazine photos.  Truman is like a child under the
thumb of a domineering parent, which adds depth to the character of
Christof (Ed Harris), the show's creator and director.  In small moments
we see Christof behaving with the concern and tenderness of a father, but
it's a twisted and controlling love.  Though he sincerely believes he has
created a better world for Truman, he can't overcome the determination of
his "son" to create his own destiny.</P>
<P>     Before it begins to appear that THE TRUMAN SHOW is a touch-feely
triumph of the spirit story complete with swelling strings, I should note
that Weir and writer Andrew Niccol (GATTACA) come at the material from a
subversive and satirical angle.  As much as it is about Truman himself,
THE TRUMAN SHOW is also about the phenomenon of television viewership, and
more specifically about the phenomenon of blaming the media for giving
the people what they want.  The irony in the film's conclusion, as Truman
tries to escape from his staged life, comes from the same viewers who
happily watched his confinement cheering for his freedom, seemingly
oblivious to the role they played in his plight.  THE TRUMAN SHOW
recognizes that we are a nation of voyeurs who jeer programmers for
pandering to our voyeuristic nature.  The film's most memorable moment may
be its final scene, where a heroic finale is twisted with a knowing nod to
the fact that there will always be an audience for the next "Truman Show."
If this is the stuff of high concept, then it's the kind which finally
puts the emphasis on the "high."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 harried Trumans:  10.</PRE>
