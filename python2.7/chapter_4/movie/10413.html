<PRE>                             MOUSE HUNT 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
          1 :-(  for the mouse that is mightier than the sword</PRE>
<P>Starring: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, and Christopher Walken.
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin. Producers: Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig, and Bruce
Cohen. Director: Gore Verbinski.</P>
<P>This is a mouse and this is a house, and this is about as funny as the
movie gets. In this unnecessary epic tale of two none-too bright
brothers come to stake their claims on a 10 million house, they must
first boot the illegal tenant a mouse, into the snow. If you like movies
where grown men continually make idiots of themselves, then this movie
is for you. There are enough HOME ALONE scenes in this movie to make all
McCauley Culken wanna-bes, happy little boys.</P>
<P>The mouse doesn't speak a word of English, but has an impeccable sense
of timing and undeniable good sense of humour. Foiling the greedy
brothers with every twist of traps and turn of cheese, it outwits the
dimwit brothers, inflicting hell on all concerned. This rising star of
the animal kingdom is not by any means as talented as BABE, but still
encapsulates intelligence, wit and cheek in its tiny body. Judging from
the fickleness of Hollywood contracts, it is likely that more that two
dozen mice were dumped from the set because they were either getting too
old, too ugly or just plain pregnant. Isn't the going settlement 7
million for all pregnant stars unduly discharged? How I wish I was a
pregnant mouse.</P>
<P>Taking the passenger seats in this roller coaster comedy are the Smuntz
brothers Nathan Lane and Lee Evans. Lane from THE BIRDCAGE once again
shows us his comedic talents as he is beaten and battered to death by a
mouse. Hard to believe, but I guess it takes more than just contrived
acting to convince the audience that a mouse has just beaten you up – so
full marks to Lane for lowering himself to the task. There is also a
delightful appearance from Christopher Walken as the pest control
extraordinare - even he the master of villainous guises falls prey to
the mightier mouse.</P>
<P>So this new offering from SKG is not as funny as it had hoped. Diverting
enough entertainment for the holiday period, but the material is as
intelligent as handing a mouse a script, letting it chew it up before
releasing it in a house to cause mayhem on the world. Happier hunting
next time SKG, this is not the big cheese that everyone will take the
bait for.</P>
