<PRE>                      THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     The fun of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is to figure out why a
badly written book that has now become a decent, if implausible, movie
has captured the imaginations of millions of Americans for the last
three years.</P>
<P>     The answer can only be that all who read or see it are projecting
a deep piece of their emotional lives into the story.  Robert James
Waller's style is irrelevant; what he did, it seems, is create a blank
page for the collective fantasy.  THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is an
invitation to consider what might have been, permission to think about
what was missed or what was lost.  As Robert Kincaid and Francesca
Johnson, Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep become the vessels for the
inner lives of their audience.</P>
<P>     After overcoming some awful overacting in the opening scene by
Victor Slezak as Francesca's son, Michael, they go on to play out a
gentle, tender affair that is rooted in decency.  With her family away
at a four-day farm show, Francesca's fires are kindled by Robert, a
National Geographic photographer enticed by the bridges of the small
Midwestern farm town.  Forget the faint likelihood of Meryl Streep as a
farm wife or Clint Eastwood as an unattached lover who is free to ask
her to run away with him.  It's O.K. this time; they are merely our
surrogates in this dream.</P>
<P>     "How sad it is," Francesca says, "to leave this earth without your
children ever knowing who you were."  You can feel the audience melt
into sadness.  And over the whole looms the probability that this
concrete realization of the universal need for connection will
evaporate, because "the minute we leave this place, everything will
change."</P>
<P>     Eastwood and Streep play in gentle understatement, where the
question, "Would you like some iced tea?" carries all the loneliness of
their lives.  It is a story about falling in love far more than about
acting out lust, and it cries out the sadness that so much love has to
take place in secrecy.</P>
<P>     The movie propels itself slowly with a lot of meaningful staring
and long silences while Francesca decides whether she can abandon an
entire life to start a new one. "When a woman marries and has children,
love begins and love stops," she says with a clear grasp of her "life
of details."  When her family returns to show her their triumphs, the
life she leads for others stares her full in the face.</P>
<P>     It is not a stretch to say that romantic love is short-lived
inside or out of marriage.  Whatever wrongful, sad, or transcendent form
it later takes, the initial period of discovery and passion is a joy
that lodges in the soul.  Carrying it off with a lovely, gentle
chemistry, Eastwood and Streep invite us to reinvent our lives.  They
touch the need in the collective unconscious to connect with another
human being.  That bad book has come a long way.</P>
