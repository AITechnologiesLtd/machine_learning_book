<P>We have been very blessed this summer. It all started with Star Wars Episode 1:
The Phantom Menace. Despite what you thought of the film, it was still a motion
picture experience we will never forget. Then, we saw Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me, which turned out to be better then the original. Then, we saw
the end of Stanley Kubrick's great career. And in recent weeks, we have seen
the Indie sensation, The Blair Witch Project and also the sharp comedy,
Bowfinger. And last, but certainly not least, The Sixth Sense. It is very
comparable to The Blair Witch Project in the fact that they both keep you
interested until the end, and then shock you with very haunting and chilling
endings. They are both great films and very worthy of their four star ratings,
but I would have to give a slight edge to The Blair Witch Project, only due to
the fact that Witch's characters are a little stronger and The Sixth Sense goes
slightly too long, but is still great, nonetheless.</P>
<P>The premise is that Bruce Willis is a child psychologist in Philadelphia. The
film starts with Malcolme Crowe (Bruce Willis) winning an award for his work.
Crowe and his wife go to celebrate, but they are interrupted by an old patient
who broke into their home, played by Donnie Wahlberg. He shoots Crowe and the
film moves on to next Fall. Crowe takes a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Joel
Osment), who displays the same simptoms of Vincent Gray (Wahlberg). Crowe wants
to help Sear, to make up for his failure with Gray.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is excellent in this film. He is the prototypical Hollywood actor.
He can do action, as shown in the Die Hard trilogy. And he can also do serious
acting, and he displays that trait in The Sixth Sense. He is completely
believable, which is needed in this sort of film. The premise not exactly
something you hear about every day, so each actor had to have a sense of
believability. And Willis does.</P>
<P>However, compared to Haley Joel Osment, Willis is trash. Osment gives a great
performance as Cole Sear. He is able to display such great amounts of emotional
depth despite his young age. He gives a better performance than I have seen
from other veteran actors. I had heard the hype after the release of The Sixth
Sense that Osment deserved an Oscar nomination. I did not believe it...Until
now, that is. He got such a demanding role, and is able to outshine everyone
else in the film with a terrific performance. And his career can only go up
from here. Some of you may remember him as Forrest Gump Jr. from Forrest Gump.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is solid and basically just feed off the performances of
Osment and Willis. The reason this film is so good is that it does not burden
you with too many subplots. The main plot is, of course, trying to solve the
mystery of what is bothering Cole. The only other subplots are the relationship
between Malcome and his wife, and the relationship between Cole and his mother.
It is simple, straightforward, despite being so complex and interesting.</P>
<P>Overall, The Sixth Sense is this summer's must-see. Just like The Blair Witch
Project it is cheap and interesting. Also like The Blair Witch Project it is
not as scary as you may think, but character interaction and depth make up for
it in both cases. Expect to see Haley Joel Osment and maybe even Bruce Willis
at the Oscars. The only thing holding those two men (and children) from making
acceptance speeches is their summer release. But, their performances are so
strong the voting committee should still be thinking about them come Oscar
Season. And when you start talking Oscars, you know you have just seen a good
film.</P>
