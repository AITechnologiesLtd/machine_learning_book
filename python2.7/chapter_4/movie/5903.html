<PRE>                              JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years 
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted. 
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details 
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     This weekend I saw JURASSIC PARK.  I would give the dinos a ****
rating as I never thought they were models or simulations and I will
never forgot the awe inspiring sounds they made.  As for the actors,
director and especially the script, I would give them a * rating.
Overall I give the movie a *** rating and wish the dinosaurs would have
eaten all of the people except for say a narrator in the first 5
minutes of the show.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, if they had created people I cared about, well
then I would have preferred them to live and interacted with the dinos.
Since I did not care if the people lived or died, the movie never
scared me unlike Aliens (****) which scared the daylights out of me.</P>
<P>     Now, what really bothered me in JURASSIC PARK were the
stereotypes.  We learned that complex systems are created by single
programmers who are obese, live on candy bars, can single handed write
2 million lines of code, are exploited by evil managers, and are ready
to kill everyone to make their fortune.  Doesn't sound like any of my
friends.</P>
<P>     Like all good Hollywood produced movies with business people in
them we again learn that they are out to make a PROFIT (boo, hiss ...).
Making a profit we are reminded means that you must put your workers in
physical jeopardy, underpay them, and most of all rape the ecohsystem.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
