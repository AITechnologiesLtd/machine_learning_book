<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>For the past few years, most movies set during World War II have been 
more about the mentality and morals of war than about simple military 
adventure and heroics. Even the last great submarine movie, "The Hunt For 
Red October," was as much a character study of Sean Connery's Captain 
Marko Ramius as it was a Tom Clancy actioner. "U-571" bucks this trend, 
hearkening back to the simple but exciting Saturday matinee flicks which 
were so popular half a century ago.</P>
<P>The plot here is straightforward, existing mainly as an excuse for 
deep-sea dramatics. A British destroyer has crippled a German U-boat, 
the U-571. The Allies are aware that the submarine is equipped with an 
Enigma device -- the key to unlocking Nazi ciphers, and possibly to 
winning the War. An American sub is sent out to reconnoitre with U-571, 
poising as a German supply ship. The American troops are to seize the 
vessel, capture the crew, and bring the Enigma back to their ship. All 
this has to be done without the Nazis getting suspicious, because if they 
find out the Allies have the Enigma, they'll just change their codes and all
will be for naught.</P>
<P>The mission, led by young up-and-comer Executive Officer Lieutenant 
Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), goes smoothly at first. Then the 
American sub gets torpedoed, killing most of its crew except for the 
U-571 boarding party. Trapped on the damaged German submarine, Tyler and 
his remaining men have to find their way back to Allied territory before 
they're discovered by the Nazis.</P>
<P>In terms of being sheer popcorn fare, "U-571" does a pretty good job. 
Although the film takes too long to get going, things heat up nicely once 
the Americans are trapped on board the U-boat, and the tension keeps 
building from there. Particularly exciting is a lengthy sequence in which 
the sub is being depth-bombed by a Nazi ship. Having devised a desperate 
plan for survival, Tyler orders his crew to take the dilapidated vessel 
deeper than it should go even under normal operating conditions. The 
explosions get nearer and nearer; the groaning of the bulkheads grows 
constantly louder. It's an engrossing piece of cinema.</P>
<P>But other plot developments are more routine. For instance, in the 
aftermath of the explosion of their ship, the Americans find the Nazi 
captain of the U-571 (Thomas Kretschmann), still manacled after his initial 
capture, struggling to stay afloat. In an act of mercy, Tyler has him 
pulled out of the water and chained up in the engine room. I was counting 
the minutes until the captain betrayed the Americans, and my expectations 
proved correct on not one but two occasions. A lot of the movie feels 
like this: standard action/military scenes transposed onto the submarine 
setting.</P>
<P>"U-571's" biggest deficiencies, though, lie in its almost total lack of 
characterisation. Part of what makes other war movies, like "Saving 
Private Ryan," so good is that each of the soldiers involved are 
portrayed with depth and feeling. They might not have a lot of screen 
time, but they feel like real people with real lives nonetheless.</P>
<P>The same cannot be said of the cast of "U-571", who prove to be a 
faceless, unmemorable bunch. Even the main stars play cookie-cutter 
characters. Take McConaughey's Andrew Tyler, for example. At the start of 
the movie, he argues with his commanding officer, Mike Dahlgren (Bill 
Paxton) about whether he's ready for his own command. Dahlgren doesn't 
believe he is, and explains why. By the end of "U-571", surprise 
surprise, Tyler has learned exactly those lessons Dahlgren had described. 
You could almost check them off a list as they come up. Tyler is just a 
standard military action hero, and what attempt there is to flesh him out 
comes across as transparent and uninspired, like the above. McConaughey 
does a decent enough job as the heroic lead, but to propel it, "U-571" 
needs its lead to be more interesting than that.</P>
<P>The other headliners are similar non-entities. Harvey Keitel plays the 
Chief as if he'd just stepped out of any one of a hundred similar movies. 
He's an old sea dog who hands out spoonfuls of advice every few scenes on 
cue. Jon Bon Jovi, in his acting debut, is passable but forgettable as 
Tyler's best friend, Pete Emmett. Paxton is surprisingly lacking in 
passion or involvement as Dahlgren.</P>
<P>At least "U-571" looks good. Despite the limited choices of location and 
camera angles, director (and co-writer) Jonathan Mostow keeps our eyes 
glued on the screen. There are some nice shots, for instance, where the 
camera actually follows the submarine as it dives beneath the waves. On 
the other hand, one thing Mostow seems to attempt with success is to 
convey a sense of claustrophobia in the leaky submarine. Characters sweat 
and look about nervously, and water drips from every corner. But the feeling
that those metal walls are closing about them -- just barely keeping out 
the crushing ocean waves -- simply isn't there.</P>
<P>As light entertainment, you could certainly do worse than "U-571". It's 
fun and exciting, and every now and then might even set your pulse racing 
a little faster. But ultimately, as a big-budget update of those old 
postwar action films, Mostow has borrowed a few plot elements and 
characters too many. And in the end, that's what sinks "U-571".</P>
