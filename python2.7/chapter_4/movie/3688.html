<PRE>                        THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     As one of the four or five people who actually did not read Robert
James Waller's hugely popular novel, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, I
can't answer the "was it better than the book" question.  I can tell
you that the film adaptation, starring Clint Eastwood (who also
directs) and Meryl Streep, is a very moving, thought provoking story
that deals with the themes of love and choiceless choices.</P>
<P>     Eastwood plays Robert Kincaid, a photographer assigned by National
Geographic to shoot the covered bridges of Madison County, Iowa.  Meryl
Streep is Francesca Johnson, a wife and mother of two who is home alone
while her husband and children are at the Illinois state fair.  Robert
shows up at her house, lost, and she quickly finds herself intrigued by
this polite, solitary man-of-the-world.  After she spends some time
with Robert, showing him the bridges and inviting him for dinner,
Francesca begins to discover passion and romance, two elements that are
painfully missing from her adequate but dull life.  The romance turns
to a love affair and as the end of the four days draws closer,
Francesca must choose between Robert and her family, a new life filled
with excitement or her duty to the life that she already chose.</P>
<P>     Eastwood, with a superb screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, has
created a unique, romantic story that is more haunting than it is
sentimental.  There is an incredible feeling of emotional truth in
this film which essentially eliminates the fourth wall (the term for
that imaginary barrier between us and the what is up on screen) and
allows us to feel as if we were flies on the wall, watching a real
relationship unfold.  Cinematographer Jack N. Green, editor Joel Cox,
composer Lennie Niehaus (who all worked on Eastwood's Oscar winning
UNFORGIVEN) and production designer Jeannine Oppewall help Eastwood
create such an enveloping environment that the we are completely
engulfed into the picture.</P>
<P>     For those of you who are still skeptical about Eastwood acting
without a gun in hand, don't be.  His Kincaid character combines his
powerful presence with a deep sensitivity that was hinted at but not
seen in his previous work.</P>
<P>     As far as Streep's performance is concerned, why don't we just
give her the Oscar now?  Her Italian accent is perfect (big surprise
there) and her use of non-verbal looks and gestures brings a depth to
her character that cannot be written in any screenplay.  There is no
doubt about it, there are many great actors and actresses working today
but Streep is in a class by herself.</P>
<P>     THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY will stay with you long after you
leave the theater.  It forces us to not only think about the film's
characters, but of our own lives, choices and consequences as well.</P>
