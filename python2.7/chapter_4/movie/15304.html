<P>Why is it that whenever Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins team up in a movie,
the film ends up being a saccharine Harlequin romance novel? It sounds
weird, doesn't it? Granted, the characters that Pitt and Hopkins play are
never romantically linked (that would be too weird). But for some strange
reason, this trait has been a core aspect of their two collaborations.</P>
<P>"Legends of the Fall" was nothing more than a tawdry, melodramatic paperback
romance in film form. Now comes "Meet Joe Black", a completely unrealistic
romantic fantasy that tries to manipulate our emotions as opposed to
actually challenging them.</P>
<P>Loosely based on the Fredric March classic "Death Takes A Holiday", "Meet
Joe Black" has a unique premise. Corporate mogul William Parrish (Anthony
Hopkins) is about to celebrate his 65th birthday. But a couple of days prior
to the elegant bash being thrown by his eldest daughter, Parrish is visited
by none other than Death himself (Brad Pitt). Using the body of a recently
deceased man, Death wishes to take a break from his normal duties and be
given a tour of life on earth. After being guided by Parrish for a brief
time, Death will take him into the afterlife after his birthday celebration.</P>
<P>Assuming the name Joe Black, Death becomes Parrish's shadow, following him
into virtually every area of his life. But conveniently, he takes enough
breaks from this partnership to strike up a love affair with Parrish's
forlorn youngest daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). It is a romance complete
lacking in chemistry or motivation as they fall in love almost
instantaneously without even knowing anything about each other. They just
"connect". This may appeal to an idealistic teenager, but for the average
adult it may prove unsatisfying to see a woman fall in love with a guy whose
greatest passion is peanut butter. If the reasoning is "But it's Brad
Pitt!", then that is a truly shallow and meaningless reason indeed.</P>
<P>Running at just a hair under three hours, "Meet Joe Black" long overstays
its welcome. Scenes go on far past the point of which they should end.
Schmaltzy lingering looks and lengthy dramatic pauses are present in
virtually every scene. This is such a quiet film, one where you could hear a
pin drop about every two minutes. The pacing plods along ever so slowly,
unlike any film that I've ever seen before. You could trim about a
half-an-hour off of the film's length by simply making the dialogue and
action tighter.  But director Martin Brest wallows in pregnant pauses, ones
that suck the life out of the story, the characters, and eventually the
viewer.</P>
<P>I mean, how many times do we have to cut back and forth between two
characters "reacting" to one another before another word is eventually said?
Must they deeply contemplate everything that they say? This is easily Brest'
s worst film. If you want to see his best, rent the engaging and powerful
"Scent of a Woman".</P>
<P>The script wants so badly to be about ideas. It yearns to provoke thought
about death, life, and what we should value. But for the most part we are
bludgeoned with speech after speech that simply waxes poetic about life and
love. These diatribes are based in the ideal, but are rarely tested by
issues of reality. Because of this, much of the film comes off as preachy
instead of challenging.</P>
<P>Most of this enlightenment is communicated through Death of course, or at
least when it's convenient for him to do so. Joe Black is a contradictory
enigma who is all-knowing and wise in one scene, then simple and naïve the
next. In this film, Death is the most tender and sensitive entity that one
could imagine. This New Age characterization of Death as simply being
misunderstood may be appealing to some, but I had a hard time believing that
the Grim Reaper didn't have a dark side.</P>
<P>Most of the performances are annoying and one-dimensional. As Death, Brad
Pitt is uncharismatic and stilted. Early on there is a scene where he
discovers the unique taste of peanut butter. According to his dialogue, he
seems to be quite taken with it. But his inappropriate understated manner
simply says, "Huh, that's nice." For peanut butter being something that he
can't seem to get enough of, he emotes little (if any) excitement about it.</P>
<P>This example is characteristic of Pitt's entire performance. It makes sense
for him to be in this zombie-like trance at the beginning. But to see no
change in his emotional state for the entire film simply doesn't make sense.
He says that his experiences are changing him, but they seem to have no
affect on his countenance or personality. Brad Pitt has yet to live up to
the promise that was shown in 1995 when he was nominated for his supporting
turn in "12 Monkeys", as well as delivering the best performance of his
career as the naïve police detective in "Seven".</P>
<P>Claire Forlani is unimpressive in her debut as a leading ingenue. If she has
range as an actress, you certainly don't see it here. Like Pitt's
characterization, Forlani's performance of Susan is a one-note portrayal
that stays the same from beginning to end. This character reeks of pandering
to a female audience. Susan is shy and vulnerable, prone to cry at the drop
of a hat. She is a soft-spoken waif just waiting to be swept off of her
feet. Forlani never balances Susan's vulnerability with any sense of
strength, unintentionally creating a character that comes off as weak and
borderline co-dependent.</P>
<P>One look from Pitt's blue eyes (that at times hide behind his golden bangs)
and she's a goner. This may make some women swoon, but it certainly does not
equate substance or depth in the characterization of Susan Parrish.</P>
<P>The first scene in which she meets Pitt's character is embarrassingly
"scripted". This good-looking blonde just happens to hit on her and, in the
period of five minutes, expresses his innermost feelings about how love
should be. This is, I am led to believe, every young woman's dream. Too bad
it's something that will never happen. The best kind of fantasy has some
basis of reality because it gives the illusion that the fantasy might
actually be possible. But even though this fantasy is set in reality, it has
no basis in it.</P>
<P>Jake Weber is burdened with the duty of playing the bad guy. As Drew, Weber
plays the young hotshot climbing the corporate ladder. The story begins with
him having both William Parrish's ear as well as the affections of his
daughter. But as the film progresses, we see him for the cut-throat selfish
tycoon that he really is. If William Parrish is supposed to be such a shrewd
businessman, how does a jerk like Drew pull the wool over his eyes for so
long? Characters like Drew are formulaic plot devices that create
inconsistencies in the characters that choose to associate with them. There
isn't a shred of humanity in Drew; he is simply an unscrupulous evil
character who has no business being in a film that aspires to be mature.</P>
<P>The picture is visually lush in both its art direction and cinematography,
but at times too lush. The love scene in particular is overly beautified as
it looks like a perfume or lingerie commercial. The soft golden light shines
off of our two lovers as they strike sensual poses for the camera. These
constructed shots belong in a magazine ad or on a billboard, but are out of
place in a dramatic film.</P>
<P>Thomas Newman's music score is beautiful, albeit excessive. Particularly at
the films end when we are assaulted with multiple orchestral crescendos that
are supposed to really make us cry. This music bombards us as characters
either contemplate or cry. Then a short exchange occurs between two people,
immediately followed by more sweeping woodwinds and strings. Of the many
adjectives one could use to describe the use of music in "Meet Joe Black",
subtlety isn't one of them.</P>
<P>In a film so tediously boring, Anthony Hopkins provides the one jolt of
life. His William Parrish seems to be the only character with emotional
levels. At times he can be withdrawn and mysterious, but he also has his
moments of frustration and explosive anger.</P>
<P>He is also the only character that actually expresses challenging ideas.
Just when I was about to throw-up after yet another feel-good platitude,
Parrish chimed in with a statement that actually made me think. In a film
with few bright spots, Hopkins's performance stands out as the brightest.</P>
<P>The other actor worthy of praise is Jeffrey Tambor (TV's "The Larry Sanders
Show") who plays Quince, William's son-in-law and business partner. Quince
is gentle and loyal, but never weak. Though not a person who is prone to be
confrontational, Quince never lacks conviction. Tambor is to be credited for
giving more depth to his character than was provided him by the script.</P>
<P>This film fails in one key area. Until the very end, the only person who
knows of Joe Black's true identity is William Parrish. As a result, the film
sidesteps a conflict that could have been truly dramatic and intriguing.
Ponder for a moment with me, if you will. Imagine if, say, at the beginning
of the film's final hour, Susan discovers that Joe is Death. Think of the
potential complication that this would pose. The man she loves is the same
man who has come to take her father away from her. This would have created a
very challenging personal struggle for all three characters involved.
Instead, by keeping Joe's identity hidden, Susan is not challenged in any
way, leaving us to sappy expressions of love and romance that have no basis
of substance or motivation.</P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black" wants to have its cake and eat it to. It takes the heavy
and complicated subject of death and tells a fable where virtually every
plot line (save one crucial story element) is tied up ever so nicely with
the ribbon of audience satisfaction. The film gives us virtually everything
we "want". William Parrish and Joe Black are the only ones who know that he
is about to die. But somehow, virtually every character has a moment with
Parrish that ends up being a deathbed confessional and expression of love.
The only problem is that they have no idea he is on his deathbed. So why,
all of a sudden, do they finally feel the need to pour out their soul? I can
believe it coming from Parrish, he knows what's about to happen. But from
everyone else it seems horribly forced. These people are living on an
exhalted emotional and spiritual plain the likes of which I have never seen.</P>
<P>The film doesn't have the courage to challenge us with the thought that, if
we're not careful, those that we love may pass on before we have the chance
of expressing all that we really feel. Had Brest not been so concerned with
making us happy, he would have been more successful in communicating the
themes that he was hoping to address. But instead of being given something
to think about, we are appeased with the relief that everything worked out
in the end. When you choose to tackle the reality of death in a story, I
think you cheat the subject matter by having everything end so conveniently.</P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black" may very well be the oddest film released in 1998. It is a
film that is guilty of (what I consider to be) virtually every artistic
crime known to cinema. And yet for some truly odd reason, for as bloated and
indulgent as Martin Brest's film is, I never found myself losing interest.
Don't get me wrong; aside from Hopkins and Tambor, my interest wasn't
sustained because the film was good. I think what kept me in it was how
uniquely awful it was. I've never seen bad filmmaking quite like this
before. Dare I say that Meet Joe Black, in regards to bad filmmaking, is
revolutionary. I found a perverse entertainment in discovering brand new
ways to make a film bad. For me, this may be a singular appeasement. But for
the public at large, you're best to steer clear of this boring mess.</P>
