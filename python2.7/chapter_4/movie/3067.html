<PRE>                       MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1994)
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A remake of a classic holiday film
     adds a few touches that the story did not need and
     basically just opens the story to a generation who won't
     watch black and white.  There are far worse remakes, but
     isn't that faint praise?  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There are basically two reasons to remake a film.  One reason is
that movie theaters need something to thread into their projectors.
Here the urge is often to try to get the product made as quickly as
possible and to use as the blueprint a film that has already proven to
be an audience pleaser.  One can only hope that the filmmaker will
treat the original material with respect, particularly if the original
is a well-liked film.  The other reason for remaking a film is that
sometimes a filmmaker can discover a new slant on an old story and can
bring something fresh to the story.  And these reasons are in large
part in conflict since the first requires speed, the second slows down
the process.</P>
<P>     The new MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET feels like it was made for both
reasons.  The holiday season is coming and those projectors are hungry
to be fed.  What does the new version add?  Primarily what it adds is
color.  The original has become a great children's film that only
adults will watch.  Why?  Because it is real, real old, from the days
before people knew that movies need color, dude.  The choice seems to
be to colorize, to remake, or to just stop telling the story to
children.  Then I saw this film with absolutely the wrong audience, a
collection of film fans who obviously would have grown up with the
original and knew not to equate monochrome with bad filmmaking.  To
much of that audience this film was a purely redundant remake.</P>
<P>     I suppose I feel much the same way.  But I do admit it generally
did treat the material with a degree of respect.  So often films for
children have gunplay or people kicking other people or attempted
rapes, etc., ad nauseum.  But in this film, besides an attempted
corporate takeover by some shadowy bad guys, which admittedly I could
have done without, this is a likable and a faithful retelling.</P>
<P>     Kriss Kringle (played by Sir Richard Attenborough) is back on 34th
Street.  This time he is not in Macy's Department Store but in a
foundering store called Cole's.  (Macy's reportedly wanted no part ofa
remake that would claim they were in financial trouble.  Other stores
were anxious but none on 34th Street.)  Kriss is the best department
store Santa Claus that any store could have, with just one drawback.
Kriss actually thinks that he is Santa Claus.  And what is more he is
able to convince others of his insanity.  One of the people he would
like to convince is the store's hard-nosed special projects director,
Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Perkins), and her wide-eyed daughter Susan
(Mara Wilson).  But who does nor know the plot of MIRACLE ON 34TH
STREET, one of the perennial holiday classics.</P>
<P>     Kriss is played by Sir Richard Attenborough, formerly of JURASSIC
PARK.  He is still trying to give children something real, but this
time around it is something that won't bite them.  Where Edmund Gwen
was smiling and pleasant, Sir Richard genuinely radiates joy.  His
short beard is a bit of a problem, particularly since young Susan
claims he looks like all the pictures of Santa Claus, but otherwise he
is more satisfying in the role by objective standards.  Mara Wilson
plays young Susan, the wide-eyed premature realist.  Wilson is not the
beautiful child that Natalie Wood was, but does seem to show an
intelligence far beyond her seven years of age.  Elizabeth Perkins and
Dylan McDermott play Dorey Walker and her suitor Bryan Bedford.  Each
know they have to out-act their predecessor in the previous film and
probably do.</P>
<P>     I do not remember the original giving much explanation why the
mother has her attitudes on the danger of living in fantasy.  This
version gives a fairly thin explanation, but at least it is there.  In
some ways it strengthens the new version, but the explanation is alsoa
bit downbeat for a children's film.  The happy climax of the film
trades the original's piles of mail for crowds of people and a much
better legal argument.  Strictly speaking, the happy ending of the
court case is far less contrived in this version, not that it will be
as satisfying to youngsters.</P>
<P>     It is hard to know exactly how to rate a remake.  Do you pretend
you never saw the original?  If so, then this is a fairly good film.
But, if like most people, you have seen the original, there is not a
whole lot new to offer.  Overall, I suppose I will rate it from the
latter point of view and give this a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
