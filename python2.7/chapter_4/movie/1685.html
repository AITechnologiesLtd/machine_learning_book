<PRE>                                  CHAPLIN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A very long overdue cinematic tribute
     to one of the great screen comics of all time.  CHAPLIN may
     spend too little time on some chapters of Chaplin's life and
     too much time on others, but it still manages to be funny
     where it needs to be and also manages some historic sweep.
     Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     In 1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein to see a private
screening of Chaplin's new CITY LIGHTS.  When passersby cheered the two men,
Chaplin turned to Einstein and said, "The people are applauding you because
none of them understands you and applauding me because everybody understands
me."  Getting an understanding of a good, simple man was Richard
Attenborough's goal in CHAPLIN much as it was in his GANDHI.  CHAPLIN is, of
course, a long overdue cinematic tribute to the man most easily pointed to
as the greatest screen comic of all time.  In 144 minutes Attenborough
attempts to cover the entire career of Chaplin from about age four to age
eighty-three.  Eighty is a lot to cover. This leads to some problems with
pacing in which some periods are covered much too quickly and others, less
interesting, are shown in too much detail.</P>
<P>     The biography is told mostly in flashback that opens with the Chaplin
family's grinding poverty in London at the end of the 19th Century.
Charlie's mother supports the two of them and Charlie's older brother by a
failing career singing in music halls.  When she is no longer young enough
to please an audience, Charlie finds he has some talent in front of an
audience, but not enough talent to earn what it would take to keep his
family together, nor enough to keep himself out of the workhouse.  In his
suffering and despair the film makes only too clear the roots of Chaplin's
bittersweet comedy.  The film tracks his music hall career, his first love,
and his trip to America to try to prosper.  It is, perhaps, a weakness of
the screenplay by William Boyd, Bryan Forbes, and William Goldman that
Chaplin is so incredibly understandable and so obviously a product of this
early existence.  His efforts to ease suffering and his womanizing all seem
to come from attempts to recapture what little was good in his youth and to
help others avoid the suffering he had experienced.</P>
<P>     The scene shifts to America with Dan Aykroyd playing an extremely
vulgar Mack Sennett.  There Chaplin invents his tramp character.  (The film
takes some liberties here.  The tramp actually first showed up in a humorous
documentary about a children's auto race.  Supposedly a funny-looking
observer keeps walking in front of the camera.  Within two years that funny
little pest would be one of the most famous people in the world.) After all
that Charlie has been through it would be nice to see how he reacts as
success starts coming to him.  What should have been the most exciting part
of the film was covered in two or three scenes in which Chaplin goes from
being a clever new comic to "the most famous man in the world."</P>
<P>     Now scandalously rich, as perhaps the screen's first real star and
certainly the first superstar, Charlie tries to make everything that went
wrong in his youth now go right, only to find that dream impossible.  The
film traces the rest of his career, his many marriages, and his friendship
with Douglas Fairbanks (whose natural flamboyance actor Kevin Kline can only
barely reflect).  Particularly interesting is the discussion over how to
make the transition to sound and why Chaplin insisted on making what were
essentially silent films well into the sound era.  Also we see why he made
THE GREAT DICTATOR and why he insisted it would be the final film for his
tramp.  Chaplin's conflict with J. Edgar Hoover also gets attention.</P>
<P>     Attenborough's Chaplin is every bit as tragic as the character he
played.  Robert Downey, Jr., plays him as a man of terrible self-doubts, a
man who can have a room full of admiring fans and if one drunk does not like
him, he will fall into depression.  He is a man who had many dreams and of
them the only one that came true was his wish for success.</P>
<P>     CHAPLIN is one of those films where major stars are satisfied with
small roles just to part of the tribute.  Among them are Anthony Hopkins,
Penelope Ann Miller, James Woods, and Robert Stephens.  Geraldine Chaplin
plays her own grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.  Downey is surprisingly
satisfying as Chaplin.  One does not really expect Downey to make Chaplin's
slapstick funny for a 1990s audience.  Downey appears to be fully up to the
physical demands of Chaplin's humor and somehow manages to make silent film
gags still very funny.  In make-up he really looks like Chaplin's tramp.
(Of course, people have different ideas of exactly what the tramp looks
like.  Once when Chaplin was in Monte Carlo they were having a Charlie
Chaplin look-a-like contest.  He entered the contest incognito but was only
able to cop third place.)  Playing an older Chaplin, however, Downey's
make-up lets him down.  Also, a segment of the film shot in the style of a
Keystone Cops film does not work well.</P>
<P>     It is very difficult in judging a tribute film to separate the quality
of the film itself from the appropriateness of the tribute.  If one likes
what Malcolm X or Gandhi stood for, it is difficult not to like their
biographical films more for that reason.  However, even if it is just Robert
Downey, Jr., playing Chaplin, he can kick a bully with a panache and a class
that Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Segal can barely even dream of.  With
that warning about my subjectivity, I will rate this one a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
