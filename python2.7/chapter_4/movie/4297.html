<PRE>                       ACE VENTURA 2: WHEN NATURE CALLS
                       A film review by Melissa Martin
                        Copyright 1995 Melissa Martin</PRE>
<P>     If critics don't hate this movie with every bone in their body, I
will be stunned. At times, this inane piece of drivel is even worsely
written than DUMB AND DUMBER ... and funny as hell.</P>
<P>     There is no plot to this film. The pseudo-plot exists apart from
the scenes on film, never really having a lot of impact on the viewer's
experience. But what story does exist is cliched beyond belief.
Basically, Ace (Jim Carrey) has to find a white bat that is sacred to
two tribes of African aboriginals before they go to war.  Meanwhile,
he's up to his old Ace tricks.</P>
<P>     There is only one reason to see this film... Jim Carrey. Some may
be (and rightly so) disgusted by the fact that the general public
craves Jim Carrey so, but in this film he is hilarious. Nothing new in
the Carrey department, same wayy-too-overstated-enunciation, same
rubber eyebrows.  But he's funny. Perhaps his moronic excuse for
quality comedy appeals to the eight-year-old in me, but Carrey never
failed to put me into tears of laughter.</P>
<P>     The other characters consist of a Traditional Villain, who is
not portrayed interestingly or originally in any way whatsoever, a
Traditional Sidekick, who is too dopey to be truly likable, a
Traditional Beautiful Seductress, who was actually surprisingly
enjoyable, and a Traditional Flustered General, played with a yawning
performance.</P>
<P>     The animals are nicely used, especially the adorable monkey and
the raven. Far less of the animals is seen than might be expected from
all the hype surrounding them.</P>
<P>     Pleasantly enough, there is considerably less sexual innuendo in
this installment of ACE than the first (although there are still
gratuitous references). It's more of a kid's film than the first, which
frankly just disgusted me.</P>
<P>     I wouldn't suggest seeing this film unless you're either really
bored or really crave that goofy humor. If you don't look for any
glimmer of intelligence in the writing or acting, you'll have a blast.
But if you're hoping for anything at all meaningful, you're in the
wrong department. I for one laughed till I gagged, and so did everyone
else in the audience.</P>
<P>     PARENTAL NOTE : There are only two expletives (Ace says 'damn'
twice, no biggie), but many not-so-subtle references made to genitalia
and sex (including one blatant scene where Ace is caught masturbating).
There are two full-nudity scenes, but all that is shown are bare
buttocks (in the Ace nude, it seems like there should be more showing,
but there isn't).</P>
<P>ACE VENTURA - WHEN NATURE CALLS: B+, or ***.5 stars</P>
