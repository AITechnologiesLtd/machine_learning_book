<P>   Move over Jim Carrey.  Lauren Ambrose may not have the
star attraction that you enjoy, but while you played only two
personalities (sorry, me and myself add up to only one), the
pert Lauren Ambrose turns in three, maybe more, in the
kitschy Charles-Busch scripted "Psycho Beach Party."  Based
on the hit off-Broadway play by the master of camp and
successfully adapted to the big screen, "Psycho Beach Party"
is not only about a naive kid so tired of being one of the only
two people actually to watch a drive-in movie that she is
determined to break out into real womanhood.  No more "one
of the guys" for Florence Forrest, who is dubbed Chicklet by
the surfers who adopt her.  This time it's personal, and the
person she changes into every now and then is about as
tough as Jim Carrey's Hank and in a way even more
entertaining.</P>
<P>   Like the character she is ever so loosely based on, Joanne
Woodward in Nunnally Johnson's 1957 psychological feature
"The Three Faces of Eve," Chicklet is three characters in one
small bod just as the movie itself combines four genres--
some Hitchcockian suspense particularly when the killer is
following his final would-be victim up a ladder; the Beach
Blanket Bingo-Gidget Goes Hawaiian kitsch; the slasher flicks
that have been parodied to death but not with the original
style shown here; and a genre that could be called Charles
Busch's own, transvestite buffoonery.  (Busch shows that he
can act as campy as he can write with the most comical role,
that of police captain Monica Stark, who eventually solves the
case and goes off into the woods with one of the Malibu
Beach Adonises that director Robert Lee King trots out.)</P>
<P>   King takes breaks from the murders by developing the characters
that Chicklet runs into during her struggle to become a real
woman.  Most irritating is The Great Kanaka (Thomas
Gibson), who is the movie's Big Kahuna in a way, a guy who
seems trapped not only in the search for the big wave but in
the France of the great playwright Moliere: he speaks
perpetually in rhymes.  Florence is spending the season not
only with her mother (Beth Broderick), who insists that she
does every night what every good woman does (needlepoint),
and with a Swedish exchange student, Lars (Matt Keeslar). 
Florence is to make the big play for the heart of surfer drop-
out Star Cat (Nicholas Brendon) during the movie's climactic
celebration, a luau attended by all the youthful characters of
the film.</P>
<P>   Aside from putting across some of the cool lines, featuring
non-sequiturs like "Some people are born to die" (uttered in a
50's style diner with pink-cushioned seats), Miller and Busch
trash political correctness by featuring a mean cripple that
would be the envy of Fellini and a movie star (Kimberly
Davies) whose specialty is slasher films--where she plays a
Marilyn Monroe-like bombshell but with three heads.    </P>
<P>   This is the sort of movie that even today's superstars might
love to slum around in. The performers have fun without
letting on with so much as a wink to the audience--and the
audience should pick up on their merriment by getting with
the spirit of the story.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
