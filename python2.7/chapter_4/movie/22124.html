<PRE>                                                     The Green Mile</PRE>
<P>"The Green Mile" (which is based on the Stephen King series titled Green Mile)
is one of those films that you get so involved with, that you find yourself
releasing emotions, as if you were right there with Tom Hanks and company. It's
times like these that you know the film is a powerful experience.
   The story basically has 2 sections. The first half shows what life is like
in this such prison, and what the guards do on a regular basis, while the
second half focuses on the mysterious John Coffey (Michael Duncan). In the
first half we are shown the dreadful electric chair (known as Old Sparky) , the
cellmates, the mouse 9Mr. Jingles) the prison guards: Paul Edgecomb (Tom
Hanks), Brutus (David Morse), Percy (Doug Hutchison) , etc., and the tall but
peculiar John Coffey. Apparently he was charged with killing two young girls,
but we have reasons to believe he is innocent. We see that he possesses a power
to heal those who are in pain, and use that power in other situations. He seems
as harmless as Mr. Jingles, but you will have to see it to find out.
   This is by far the most riveting emotional experience since Saving Private
Ryan. Like I stated before, we are just so engrossed with the characters and
situations, that you feel as if you were there. It's attention to detail during
crucial moments in the film kept you on the edge of your seat, because the
characters were written so incredibly well. It's as if it were a deranged
fantasy that you are apart of. Only Stephen King could think of such a thing,
and of course he did. He is truly a talented author. I only wish he would
create more stupendous novels, that are as good on screen.
   Unfortunately however, I have a few minor complaints. The film was a bit
predictable and at times formulaic. It wasn't very complex, but it really
didn't mater that much because everything else flowed smoothly.
   The acting is top notch. Once again Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the
finest actors in the business today. I've never seen an actor who is constantly
putting all of his effort into his role film after film. It's good to see that
some actors do not sell out, simply because a film has a big budget and is a
guaranteed success. Same goes with the rest of the cast. Doug Hutchinson played
a nasty punk who we want desperately to punch. David Morse too was a good
supporting actor to Hanks, but the biggest surprise was Michael Duncan. He was
virtually unknown up until Green Mile, but I'm sure he will get noticed now.
He''s similar to Ving Rhames, only he hasn't really proven his acting ability
as of yet. I could definitely see him as a James Bond villain though. He's very
big and quite strong.
   Director Frank Darabont strikes again. His first and last film (The
Shawshank Redemption) was an absolute masterpiece. The characters were
intriguing and the story was very creative. I didn't know what was going to
happen. Very mysterious. The Green Mile is far from exceeding the quality of
Shawshank Redemption, because of it's lack of pizzazz and because they work on
a different level. Another aspect of the movie that people disregard is the
length. I personally had no problem with the time. I was never bored and always
interested. I guess those with short attention spans have trouble with the lack
of action. That's their loss.
   The Green Mile is by far one of the best films of the year. It's engrossing,
dazzling and a powerful experience. It's everything a solid film should be and
more. A must see.</P>
