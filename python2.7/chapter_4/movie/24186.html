Erin Brockovich (7/10)</PRE>
<P>In Erin Brockovich, Julia Roberts takes the title role of an outwardly
trashy single mother who takes a menial job in a small law firm and,
despite her lack of legal training or experience, bluffs her way into
investigating the apparent connection between chemical discharges from a
power plant and the health problems experienced by families living
nearby. Like The Insider, the film purports to tell a recent true story
of corporations whose attempts to cover up their illegal activities are
foiled by determined individuals.</P>
<P>Director Steven Soderbergh is effective but unobtrusive and lets
Susannah Grant's script and the central performances carry the film. As
the foul-mouthed Brockovich, who desperately tries to provide for her
young family while finding a new kind of fulfilment in her
investigation, Julia Roberts has a meatier and tougher role than her
usual fluff. She handles it all very well, while still making the most
of any opportunity to display that smile and those legs. With Erin
Brockovich, Soderbergh has probably given Julia Roberts the kind of
boost he gave George Clooney's stalled career in Out of Sight.</P>
<P>Romantic interest is provided by Erin's biker neighbour George. I had to
wonder whether the real George could possibly have been as warm,
generous and understanding as he is portrayed on screen. As William
Goldman points out in his book Adventures in the Screen Trade, writing
screenplays based on real events and characters is plagued by the
problem that reality does not necessarily make convincing drama -
sometimes real life is just too corny to be believable. Erin Brockovich
is pretty corny, but maybe so is life. When movie stars play characters
based on real people, there is always the suspicion that the actors are
considerably better-looking than the people they're playing (Bonnie and
Clyde were no Beatty and Dunaway) but the real Erin Brockovich has a
cameo in the film as a waitress and she genuinely is a very attractive
woman, so maybe George really was as wonderful as shown here and this
whole rags-to-riches fairy tale in which the bad guys get their
comeuppance is a faithful adaptation of what actually happened.</P>
<P>Erin Brockovich tells a truly remarkable story. As a piece of filmed
drama, though, it's efficient but unexceptional.</P>
