<P>     I can't believe I actually sat through this movie.  Sometimes
there is a terrible price to be paid for attempting to be comprehensive
in one's reviews.</P>
<P>     Mitch (Shane McDermott) is a California beach bum:  the only
things he cares about in life are catching waves, getting a tan, and
roller blading.  One day, his parents move to Australia and Mitch has
to go stay with his cousin (Seth Green) in Cincinnati.  While there, he
manages to incur the wrath of just about every bully in school, while
capturing the affection of Nikki (Brittney Powell).  But, of course,
everything turns out all right when Mitch's incredible roller blade
skills help his school win the big race.</P>
<PRE>     Geez.  After that load of hogwash, is anyone still reading this
review?</PRE>
<P>     AIRBORNE is one of the most air-headed, poorly-conceived,
ineptly-executed motion pictures I have ever had the displeasure of
enduring.  By the list of stars involved in the production, you can
tell the kind of "talent" the film makers were able to attract.  Truly
marquee names.  Who hasn't heard of Shane McDermott?  Or Seth Green?
Surely these are household names.</P>
<P>     Before the tone of this review gets too nasty, let me take a
paragraph to catalogue all the good points, minor or otherwise, that
can be found during the course of the one-hour thirty-one minute
running time....</P>
<PRE>     Sorry, but I can't think of any.  Oh well.  C'est la vie.  Now
onto the negatives.  I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.</PRE>
<P>     To put it mildly, the plot leaves something to be desired.
Actually, except for those occasions when it descends into obviousness,
it doesn't make any sense.  I'm still trying to figure out where the
roller blading came from when most of the film split its sports-related
scenes between hockey and surfboarding.</P>
<P>     The acting is a clinic on how not to tackle motion picture roles.
I disliked the character of Mitch so much (primarily because of the
smirking twit that played him) that I kept wishing someone would crack
him over the head with a heavy, blunt object.  Or stab him.  Or shoot
him.  Or do something--anything--to shut him up.  Where's one of
those gun-toting characters from TRUE ROMANCE when you need them?  And
this guy is supposed to be the hero.</P>
<P>     The direction isn't any better than the acting, but I suppose the
two are interrelated.  The people behind the cameras did an adequate
job photographing the climactic roller-blading race (which, by the way,
goes on for far too long), but could someone please explain to me why
they insisted on shooting nearly every outdoor scene through an amber
filter?</P>
<P>     For anyone who saw this movie while yet unaware of its horrifying
potential for stealing money and time, you have my condolences.  For
those who stubbornly proceed while knowing the awful truth, you deserve
what you get.  Don't expect any sympathy from me if you're arrested
while trying to burn the film or kill the projectionist.</P>
<PRE>You have been warned.</PRE>
