<PRE>                         THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     Well-crafted, well-acted, and utterly bogus, Frank Darabont's
feel-good prison movie represents a creepy height of denial, escapism
and easy sentimentality, dodging every real issue of crime and
punishment with a hopelessly gimmicky, shamelessly manipulative story.</P>
<P>     Read a paper and see how an epidemic of underclass neglect and
crime has produced a boom in prison construction, an army of brown and
black prisoners, and a profusion of elect-me-I'll-lock-em-up crime
bills.  Comes now a movie (adapted from a Stephen King novella) from
another, simpler planet.</P>
<P>     Set between the forties and the sixties, its protagonist is a
banker named Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins), unjustly (he says) accused of
killing his wife and her lover, who befriends the voice-over narrator
Red (Morgan Freeman, doing a Mr. Bojangles turn), one of the two or
three non-white men in a gangless, generic New England joint called
Shawshank.</P>
<P>     Conflict is provided by three tediously one-note heavies whose
parts have been written with magic marker: a brutal stinker of a guard
captain (Clancy Brown) a hypocritical stinker of a warden (Bob Gunton),
and a sexually assaultive stinker of a prisoner.  Our hearts go in the
warmer as we watch the cultured, plucky Defresne win the hearts and
minds of his benighted fellow inmates by improving the library or, in
one sequence broadcasting a Mozart duet on the PA while Freeman's voice
tells us, voice-over, just how moving it is.</P>
<P>     The denouement is a "surprise" that is telegraphed, faxed, mailed,
messengered and smoke-signaled at least an hour in advance; one that is
so thunderingly obvious that even the most guarded reference would give
it away.  The film does have the virtue of putting the wonderful James
Whitmore (playing an old con) back in front of the camera; one of many
excellent performances in the film: that's not enough.</P>
