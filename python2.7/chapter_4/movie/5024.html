<P>     Almost everything that was true of 1993's NIGHTMARE BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS holds for 1996's JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH.  Based (rather 
faithfully) on Roald Dahl's children's story, this movie uses a 
combination of live-action sequences and stop-motion animation to tell 
the tale of a lonely boy, James (Paul Terry), who finds love during a 
bizarre, transatlantic voyage in the innards of a gargantuan peach.  His 
companions on the journey are a grasshopper, a centipede, a spider, an 
earthworm, a glow worm, and a ladybug.  In the hands of Henry Selick, 
who directed NIGHTMARE, this weird story has been transformed into a 
playful, visually arresting experience with more than a few allusions to 
THE WIZARD OF OZ.</P>
<P>     In this case, the destination isn't Oz, but New York City, which, 
as envisioned by Selick, is a magical, ethereal place.  The story takes 
place during an era when the Empire State Building is the world's 
tallest building, and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH becomes the second movie 
to place an overgrown object at its pinnacle.  Between England (where 
the story begins, with James suffering under the repressive thumbs of 
two ogre-like aunts) and New York, the peach, which is propelled by a 
flock of harnessed birds, has an ocean splashdown and takes a detour to 
frozen northern reaches.</P>
<P>     Obviously, the primary reason to see JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is 
for its visual splendor.  Selick's stop-motion animation is, in its own 
way, as impressive as the technological marvels of TOY STORY.  JAMES' 
creatures, which include insects, skeletons, birds, and a large-headed 
boy, are wonderfully exaggerated, but never grotesque.  The live-action 
sequences, which comprise over one-third of the running length, are 
filmed on intentionally-overstated sets that contribute to a surreal 
atmosphere not unlike the one visited by Jeunet and Caro in DELICATESSAN 
and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN.  Only when real actors and animated 
characters interact does the visual chicanery slip up.</P>
<P>     Of course, all but the youngest children (who could be frightened 
by certain scenes) will be delighted by the film, and, as was true of 
NIGHTMARE, the script is written to succeed on more than one level.  
There are some deliciously wicked lines that few youngsters will get.  
This crisp dialogue is delivered by the likes of Susan Sarandon (the 
spider), Simon Callow (the grasshopper), David Thewlis (the earthworm), 
and Richard Dreyfuss (the centipede), actors with effective vocal 
presences.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the film makers have decided to include several 
completely forgettable musical numbers penned by Randy Newman.  Not only 
are these totally superfluous, but there are times when they hurt the 
film's pacing.  I'd like to know who made the decision that every Disney 
animated film, no matter who's doing the animation, has to have a share 
of songs.  </P>
<P>     Dorothy, accompanied by a dog, a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a 
Cowardly Lion, followed the yellow brick road.  James, along with a pack 
of oversized bugs, follows his dreams.  Both reach their destinations, 
and, once there, discover that it's what they learned on the trip that 
really matters.  In the final analysis, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is 
undemanding entertainment with a subtle message.  While the film isn't 
quite as accomplished as a TOY STORY or a BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, it's 
still worth a trip to the theater, especially for those who enjoy things 
that are a little unconventional.</P>
