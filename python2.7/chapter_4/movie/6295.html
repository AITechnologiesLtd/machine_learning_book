                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<P>The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey (1988) 92m.</P>
<P>New Zealand director Vincent Ward had some difficulty getting this,
his second feature, off the ground despite critical acclaim for his
debut VIGIL.  Story is seen through the eyes of Griffin (Hamish
McFarlane, who does too much earnest yelling for my liking), a boy
living in an isolated, snowbound village in 14th-century Cumbria.  His
older brother Connor (Bruce Lyons) has just returned home to bring
news of the plague decimating the surrounding lands.  Fearing the
wrath of God, an expedition is sent from the village to place, by way
of an offering, a cross atop a church on `the far side of the Earth'
(New Zealand).  Griffin claims he has already seen the journey (if not
lived it) and serves as the party's navigator - although what he is
navigating is not only space but also time and consciousness. </P>
<P>Ward jumps the gap of six hundred years and the distance of half a
planet assuredly, but his unfixed narrative, interrupted by
repetitious flashbacks (which, since Griffin is using them to map
their future path, are simultaneously flashforwards), is less
comfortable.  This is a film based on an idea: Ward has a beginning
and an ending, but no strong narrative meat in the middle.  The
party's odyssey is over before it can reach the epic quality of a true
odyssey.  THE NAVIGATOR does not concern itself much with the spirit
of adventure (which would serve this particular story well) but
instead sticks to the more appropriately medieval doom-laden concerns
of God, death, and prophecy.  I'm glad at least that Ward didn't turn
his time-travel story into the kind of culture-shock cliche that
depends almost entirely on anachronism gags.  I also like the way he
keeps the nameless city (ostensibly Auckland) deserted and empty of
all activity save that of the machines and vehicles that prowl the
shadows like nocturnal scavengers.  His approach reinforces the notion
that everything Griffin is seeing is a dream (it's like an ultra-sober
WIZARD OF OZ - it's even bookended with black and white sequences and
features a journey to a magical city), but what prevents us from
dismissing his story as imaginary is the accuracy of his visions.
Griffin sees highways, television, a submarine, and even a glimpse of
a second potential apocalypse - the 20th century's nuclear update of
the plague.  This is Ward's nod to New Zealand's strong anti-nuclear
stance at the time, one which did not find favor with the US military
and caused much public debate.</P>
<P>Film has ambition and imagination, but still appears incomplete.  You
might come out of this feeling that something is lacking.  But you
have to admire Ward for sticking to his vision and producing something
other than the black comedies and urban/rural `social' dramas that had
the NZ film industry in a stranglehold.  His keen visual eye and deft
smoke-and-mirrors approach proves that a real director can still make
a class act out of a modest budget. </P>
