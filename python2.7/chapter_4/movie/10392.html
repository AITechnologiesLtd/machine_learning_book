<P>The Ice Storm is that rare thing among the films disgorged each year
from the United States: it is genuinely well-made. There are many things
to like about it and some things which will leave the seasoned viewer in
awe. Aong them are the razor-sharp photography aware of its own
symbolism; the unpretty psycho-sexual verisimilitude; the beautifully
detailed interiors of houses, conveying a strong nostalgia for a time -
the seventies - when people did not so much lack a sense of style as
'suffer from style to a paralysing extent' (a useful judgement on the
70s I read recently in an art magazine).</P>
<P>The story concerns two neighbouring professional families in the
north-east of the United States, the Hoods and the Carvers. The eldest
son of one family, a beautiful and dreamy, uncertain boy of perhaps
fourteen, is killed at the climax of the film and his death is clearly a
punishment brought upon the adulterous and self-absorbed parents of the
respective houses. The fact that this terrible event is the crux of the
film suggests to me that Ang Lee is less interested in post-sixties
infidelity as a theme (it's been done before, as Kevin Kline would
remember well) than in the idea of the difficulty of socialising
children in an amoral culture. This raises questions in turn about the
possibility of 'growing up' at all in such a culture: bad behaviour
spans the generations easily and makes them hard to tell apart. Parents
in the film are adolescents encased in the ungainly shells of their own
authority. They lumber about suffused with the bitterness of having
missed the main chance romantically, which is the key to their
adolescent optimism regarding the possibilities of delight contained in
sex. </P>
<P>The adults' extramarital foolings-about are not half so poignant as
their inability to give direction or, it seems, comfort to their
children. The boys - and one girl, played by Nina Ricci with her white
face, dark-circled eyes and scarlet, unsatisfied mouth - muddle through
their desires in scenes that are gothic in their uncanniness. This
disturbance comes about by setting human behaviours that are essential
and pre-cultural in the glamorous, soothing domestic interiors of
American modernity and the grey-white starkness of the Connecticut
landscape in late autumn. Whenever the teenagers come together in this
film, it is like discovering the thing that we know must be true but
will not admit is true. Ang Lee seems to be pursuing something akin to
the humourist P J O'Rourke's stipulation that for true horror we need a
clash of homeliness and frank atavism: 'It has to be Mom eating snakes
in the rec room.' The film stirs in its audience the anxiety that the
pan of experience, exotic sets and decor notwithstanding, must be
shallow indeed for these confrontations, upsets and refusals to feel so
familiar, for their acid to cut so deeply. And yet the chief delight of
the film is its delivery to us of privileged access to the players'
mostly grim sexual adventures. No-one in the ensemble, least of all any
of the youths, seems to mind being exposed utterly to us.</P>
<P>The plot evenly divides the time we spend with the parents and the time
we spend with their offspring. We are invited both to laugh drily with
the adults who like one another so little and to quiver with the
adolescents who never seem far from biting one another with the urgency
of erotic need. But the problem, of course, is that moving from one
group to another is like trekking back and forth across the wintry wood
that is shown several times to separate the neighbouring houses. The
idea of a gulf between the generations is best shown when Wendy Hood,
flustered by the entreaties of next-door neighbour Mikey Carver,
collects herself afterward in a gesture of sexual bullying: she entices
Mikey's younger brother, Sandy, who adores her, into a show-and-tell of
genitalia. Sandy agrees, and they crowd together into the gleaming
Carver bathroom. But face to face, it is too much for Sandy who, 
hyperventilating with anxiety, suddenly rejects the terms of the game
with a cry of confused horror. We are shown with brutal economy that
neither child is child enough to play such a game without cost. The
moment is not comical; it is ugly in the feeling it generates of
innocence having been trashed for no gain. The Ice Storm is serious
about sex in a way American cinema almost never is, for its moralism
never attempts to fool us with the absurdity of suggesting that we could
succeed in avoiding 'bad' or 'coercive' sex: the suffering and anomie is
built into the driving need. Banished in disgrace by Sigourney Weaver's
halter-necked temptress after her misplaced power-play, Wendy stomps
home. Kevin Kline, in the character of Ben Hood, the genially interested
buffoon that he remains for much of the story, meets her on the stairs
and asks her what she has done today. 'Nothing', she says, as any
teenager might. It, like much of the film, is a beautifully managed
exercise in suspending the audience between two utterly divergent points
of view, showing the cold distances that lie underneath one roof.</P>
<P>The director Ang Lee, if not just the author of the novel that provided
the film's narrative, has a keen sense of the rupture between mind and
body that occurs at puberty. You could say that this rupture is the
moment of being initiated into the ordeal of the civilised West. We have
no external signs for it (or only inauthentic ones), and our parents
seem unable to prepare us for it, but it is a transition one must make
in order to be an adult in the West. Maturity in our culture is a
willingness to make instruments of our bodies, to become comfortable
with a life of 'self-actualisation' and its curious internalisation of
the master-slave relation (a good idea of Baudrillard's, not mine).
There is a finely-photographed metaphor for the rupture in the shot of
Mikey, the dreamy, non-earthed elder son of the Carvers, wobbling at the
end of a diving board slicked in wet ice, testing it for bounce above an
emptied swimming pool in the wind and freezing rain of the ice storm.</P>
<P>Earlier we have seen Mikey and Wendy kiss one another passionately in
this desolate pit, as it fills with dead leaves. Mikey desires her
desperately, the film makes it clear, but he seems also to be suspicious
of bodies and the corruption that goes on inside them, even if it is
only rot at the level of the molecule. Smelling, he reads to his class
from a homework sheet, is really like tasting, in that to smell
something is to 'eat' the molecule that creates the odour. So, he
concludes, think twice about what is happening when you smell another
person's shit . On the night of the storm, Mikey tells Sandy that he is
going out into the freezing air because the cold kills off all smells,
and the air, being free of these molecules, is 'clean'. We know
immediately that this sweet-natured, quietly morbid youth is going to
die. </P>
<P>Many details glint appealingly among the heavy works of the larger
themes in The Ice Storm. For the long familiarity of siblings, there is
Wendy's often absent elder brother, Paul, whose train ride from home to
a friend's place and back frames the story, seeing at once that his
younger sister has nabbed a record from his collection by a tell-tale
scratch that makes the needle jump in a certain place as she plays it.
For the staleness of nuptial bliss, there are the buffeting waves of a
water bed which threaten to toss its occupants on the floor when one
sits on it, in a revenge of creature comforts bought in gayer, sillier
times. For the horror of a dead son that Mikey's mother must confront on
the morning after the storm, there is no confrontation at all: Sigourney
Weaver's long elegant face only emerges from sleep in close-up, to the
hoarse, nightmare-indistinct sound of her husband weeping at the other
end of the house.</P>
<P>Daring ellipsis is one of the marks of a masterly director (think of
the totally elided, because completely predictable, court case of the
young murderer in Kieslowski's A Short Film About Killing), and it is
pleasing when it occurs not only for its economy but because of its
complicty with the audience. Lee is not going to bludgeon us with the
obvious; instead, recurrently in The Ice Storm, there are breath-taking
turns; turn after turn. There is a turn in the playing out of Mikey's
death, but the most haunting of all is at another point altogether, and
its nature I will spare you. It terminates the film in such a
devastating way because of its surprise - not an intrusive or jarring
one, since it only magnifies the point being made, but a sheerly formal
beauty of a turn, like the appearance of the pressed flower in the last
seconds of Kiarostami's Where is My Friend's House - lifting and
breaking the heart. </P>
<P>Why more fuss has not been made over The Ice Storm baffles me. I can
only assume that the American public has been brutalised by Hollywood,
and cannot assimilate the complexity and precision of Lee's work. A
palate scorched daily by jalapeno peppers will not recognise a
translucent burgundy: such tastes will need time and training to
acquire. Until then know only that this film is evidence of just how
fine American cinema could become - if it wanted to.</P>
