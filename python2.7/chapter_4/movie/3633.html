                     A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     With a style and tone reminiscent of Ang Lee's two most recent 
films (THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN), Mina Shum's debut 
feature, DOUBLE HAPPINESS, chronicles the tribulations of one Chinese-
Canadian young woman as she struggles to develop her own identity in a 
family where her parents are bound by traditions she views as outdated 
and short-sighted.   </P>
<P>     The comic tone of DOUBLE HAPPINESS has a unique flavor.  Shum is 
clearly interested in making her points through laughter rather than 
tears.  The film opens by introducing us to the protagonist, an 
unmarried twenty-ish woman named Jade, as she delivers a short monologue 
about what it was like being raised in her family.  "I grew up wondering 
why we couldn't be the Brady Bunch," she confides, later adding that the 
Bradys never needed subtitles.  During the course of the film, Jade 
isn't the only one who speaks directly to the camera.  Among others, her 
grandmother, father, and a fen shwei master (a sort of soothsayer) are 
all given similar opportunities. </P>
<P>     Jade, as played by actress Sandra Oh, is a wonderful character:  
likable, bubbly, optimistic, funny, and -- most important of all -- 
believable.  She's the kind of person worth building a movie around, and 
that's exactly what has happened here.  There are several subplots going 
on, but this is ultimately Jade's story.  It tells of her growing 
dissatisfaction with her parents' restrictive rules, her desire to date 
non-Chinese men, her attempts to break into acting (a profession scorned 
by her parents), and her reluctance to hurt a mother and father she 
loves dearly.  In the end, these wants become incompatible.   </P>
<P>     Like many of the best comedies, this one is funny because it deals 
with the realities of life and the human condition -- circumstances and 
situations that everyone can relate to, regardless of ethnic heritage.  
DOUBLE HAPPINESS is often as insightful as the most serious motion 
pictures, only it chooses a lighter tone to impart its message.  There 
are moments of silliness here, as well, but they're not so extreme or 
out-of-place that they confuse the movie's primary itent. </P>
<P>     What Mina Shum has achieved here is impressive for a first-time 
film maker.  DOUBLE HAPPINESS has the look and feel of a seasoned 
director's work.  It uses techniques rarely embraced by novices (such as 
unusual camera angles to advance the narrative), and the script is 
filmed with a delicacy of touch that makes the humor all the more 
effective.  This is truly a wonderful motion picture, and an unexpected 
find. </P>
