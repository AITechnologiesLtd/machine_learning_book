'Ever After'</PRE>
<PRE>by Simon Calloway</PRE>
<P>Cast: Drew Barrymore; Anjelica Huston; Dougray Scott</P>
<P>DVD Widescreen 2.35:1/Trailer/Dolby 5.1/Language Selection</P>
<P> When I was a kid and my parents brought me to the movies, I saw a film by
Disney called Cinderella.  I never fully understood why kids liked this
particular cartoon.  I found it annoying and boring, even for a cartoon, with
the magic pumpkin and talking mice simply uninteresting. But, I was never a
Disney-type kid.</P>
<P> Now, when I heard Drew Barrymore would be starring in a live action story of
Cinderella, not produced by Disney, I thought, It could be interesting.  And
Anjelica Huston as the wicked stepmother? I'm there.</P>
<P> Little did I know, I have found my new favorite movie.  Ever After is an
enchanting, lovely adaptation of the silly Disney cartoon.  It is told through
different versus, such as Cinderella's name being Danielle, and the magic
pumpkin and mice have taken a hike (thank God!).  This is one of the reasons
Ever After works.</P>
<P> Since you know the story, I will not waste the time to tell it.  I will tell,
however, that the story takes different turns, resulting in very (crowd)
pleasing excitment.  Barrymore is just perfect for the role of Danielle, while
Huston is, of course, chillingly excellent as the evil stepmom.  This is her
film, so to speak.  She steals all her scenes, although Barrymore has a certain
sparkle that makes you want to just watch her and nothing else. </P>
<P> Do yourself a favor and see this film.  It will restore your faith in movies.</P>
