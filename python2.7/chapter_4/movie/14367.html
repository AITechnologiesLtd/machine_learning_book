<P>Rounders, if you haven't heard, is a film about people who play poker
for a living.  It involves a lot of illegal gambling, and much of it
takes place in casinos.  As we were driving out of the theater, my
friend noted that it was impressive that director John Dahl managed to
make a film about gambling interesting to people who live in a gambling
town.  I've lived in Reno my entire life, and one of the misconceptions
most people have is that casinos are everywhere, and that locals know
everything there is to know about gambling.  Apparently, my friend has
this opinion as well.</P>
<P>The fact is, most locals I know spend less than two dollars per year
gambling.  I, myself, have spent 55 cents over the course of my entire
life.  Nobody knows anything about gambling.  It's a mystery unless you
*work* in a casino.  That's why gambling is so fascinating to everyone,
including Renoites.  Sure, we ignore it for the most part, but that
doesn't mean we don't find it interesting.  As I understand it, most
people find gambling immensely interesting.  That's probably why
Rounders is likely to be a big hit -- it successfully delves into things
that most of us have never seen.  It also makes gambling seem hugely
appealing, a trait no gambling film I've ever watched has had.</P>
<P>Of course, it's more specific than "gambling" -- it takes us deep into
the world of professional poker, where people bet their entire life
savings on one hand.  It tells the story of true card sharks -- the
poker professionals who don't rely on luck, but on skill -- knowing what
cards everyone has, and knowing how to read body language.  The film
stars the ultra-popular Matt Damon as Mike McDermott, a law school
student who, at the beginning of the film, loses everything he has in
one poker game; his opponent is a crazy Russian known as KGB (John
Malkovitch).</P>
<P>He vows never to go back to the game.  He gets a "real" job driving a
truck, and moves in with his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol).  Everything
is going great until Mike's best friend, Worm (Edward Norton), is
released from jail.  Worm is, of course, a pro poker player, not to
mention an incredibly pushy guy:  he drags Mike back into the poker
underworld, and soon Mike has dropped everything, including school and
his girlfriend.  Then, predictably, Mike is put into a position in which
he must vouch for Worm -- it's then up to him to pay for all of Worm's
debts.</P>
<P>Okay, so a lot of this sounds pretty familiar.  Rounders is a smooth,
likable movie, but it is dreadfully predictable (and often strangely
contrived).  Of course Mike is going to get back into poker.  Of course
Worm is going to get himself into trouble.  Of course Mike's going to
end up "vouching for the wrong guy" (who, incidentally, is his best
friend).  And, of course, there is going to be one final showdown with
KGB.  I could see the gears turning in David Levien's and Brian
Koppelman's script as they force the events to end up just as they
began.  Interestingly, the predictability didn't bother me as I watched
the film.  Dahl (The Last Seduction, Unforgettable) does such a sharp
job directing that I can't imagine not falling prey to its charming
qualities.</P>
<P>It's probably the way he films the scenes, and the way he uses his
actors.  Dahl doesn't use a lot of camera tricks, but his camera is
always moving, panning and circling around the numerous poker tables. 
The film is ridiculously entertaining, and many of the scenes provide
solid belly laughs:  my favorite scene has all of the film's main
characters (all of whom are poker pros) sitting at a table in the Taj
Mahal, waiting for tourists to come up and waste their money.  It's such
a well-done scene; the reactions of the numerous neophytes losing their
cash is particularly good.</P>
<P>The screenplay is good in its details, and provides a lot of strong
characters for a magical cast.  Damon, unlike many of his peers, is
actually a gifted actor -- he handles the emotional ups and downs with
ease.  (My only concern is that after this film and his last two, Good
Will Hunting and The Rainmaker, he's going to be typecast as the
know-it-all with an attitude.)  Norton, on the other hand, turns in a
performance vastly different from all of his previous (does this guy
have range or what?).  He's a strong screen presence, and great fun to
watch.  John Malkovitch has a lot of fun with his role, and though his
Russian accent isn't perfect, it's interesting to see Malkovitch without
that strange voice of his.  Supporting performances from Famke Janssen,
John Turturro, and particularly Martin Landau (as Mike's professor) are
all very good.</P>
<P>I didn't much like the film's end, because none of the subplots end
with satisfaction.  The girlfriend subplot whimpers to a close, and the
relationship between Mike and Worm -- which is the film's central
conflict -- also concludes anticlimactically.  Overall, though, I didn't
mind the flaws:  Rounders is an absorbing and amusing picture to sit
through.  And, as my friend pointed out, it will even interest the 1
million people who live in cities with gambling.  John Dahl and his
array of actors have managed to take us all somewhere that we haven't
been before by explaining the way poker really works.  It just makes me
want to go out and blow thirty thousand dollars.</P>
