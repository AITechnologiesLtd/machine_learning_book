<PRE>                                  BEFORE SUNRISE
                       A film review by Jules N. Binoculas
                        Copyright 1995 Jules N. Binoculas</PRE>
<P>     When Irish author James Joyce (1882-1941) chose to immortalize his
first meeting with his wife Nora, he wrote ULYSSES, a dictionary-sized
comic parody of Homer's ancient epic ODYSSEY--compressing the account
of the 20-year wanderings of Odysseus into *one single day* in
Dublin--preserving for world history, a menagerie of stray thoughts and
actions from June 16, 1904.</P>
<P>     Shortly thereafter, Joyce left Ireland with his then-to-be
lifelong companion (and wrote all of his works in Italy, Paris, and
Zurich)--vowing never to return to his homeland.</P>
<P>     When Texas-bred Director Richard Linklater made his third film,
BEFORE SUNRISE--about the events in a single-night's romance in
Vienna--guess which date he chose to dramatize.  And why not?  If it
didn't make any money, he'd be in good company.</P>
<P>     There's a scene in Linklater's first film, SLACKER, where a
character called PRODDER, reads from ULYSSES while inducing another man
to throw a typewriter into a stream to cleanse himself from a woman's
adultery:</P>
<P>     "... If he had smiled, why would he have smiled?  To reflect that
each one who enters imagines himself to be the first ... last, only, and
alone...."</P>
<P>     In SLACKER and BEFORE SUNRISE, Linklater steals from literature to
be cute.  He realizes that transplanted cerebral ironies must be kept
on ice to keep from spoiling--but he knows how to serve them fresh
before they curdle.  As one male protagonist points out (quoting
another of Linklater's favorite philosophers): "All answers must be
found in the attempt."</P>
<P>     Once the director sells the idea that anything is possible--when
everything is permitted--he's off to the races.</P>
<P>     The races, however, turn out to be a partially disjointed
quasi-enchanting escapade between two attractive, perceptive, and
ingenuous travelers on their way to somewhere else.</P>
<P>     Linklater drops so many cinematic and literary dollops into his
stories, he risks putting his audience into mythic insulin shock.  Yet
miraculously, BEFORE SUNRISE is a nutritious entertainment: when all is
said (and little done), you're ready to visit a bookstore, call your
travel agent, and share your favorite libation with the next person who
excites you.  Life could be worse.</P>
<P>     In SLACKER, the camera mirrored the queasy conscience of the
audience, following dozens of superficially developed geeks in fuzzy
epiphanies of mere drifting through lives with no future.  So, if a
"Slacker" is *all talk and no walk*, then "Before Sunrisers" are
*mostly walk and endless talk*.  But this talk is pleasantly
contagious.</P>
<P>     Like Homer, Linklater follows characters through dead-end episodes
in strange places; and like Joyce, he bathes them in radiantly
incidental banalities.  But even a near-perfect night with someone new
isn't always perfect: we're perpetually waiting for these whimsical,
rambling, under-written souls to settle into more precise psychological
subtext.</P>
<P>     Yet, the viewer-friendly story never implodes, using informal
inflections to trace a tenuous path around weird, pathetic, and
ordinary locals on an ordinary night in Vienna.</P>
<P>     Technically, the camera perspectives are inconsistent, but somehow
interesting--dog-eared with low-budget technical flaws, redeemed with
laid-back rhythms.</P>
<P>     Despite its relentless emphasis on pure surface reality, BEFORE
SUNRISE lingers resonantly in the mind--a curiously satisfying
moment-to-moment adventure, peopled with uncertainty and
awkwardness--signifying nothing-in-particular.  But, that's the point.
In the words of yet another nameless philosopher recruited for
SLACKER:  "... my loves, what are they now?  But the more pain grows,
the more this instinct for life somehow asserts itself."</P>
<P>     Following boldly in the large footprints of his mentors,
Mr. Linklater coolly alchemizes his literary conceits into a minor
masterpiece of the mundane.</P>
