<PRE>                                CINDERELLA
                       A film review by Adrian Preston
                        Copyright 1996 Adrian Preston</PRE>
<P>The Brothers Grimm's fairy tales were a mish-mash of folk tales from around
the world. Revisionists to the last, the Grimms traveled widely, collected
tales and rewrote them to portray a Grimm version of the current socio-moral
climate. Hans Christian Anderson did exactly the same thing. Rumplestiltskin
is a prime example, the original version ( a Nordic folk tale I believe, but
I could be wrong. ) had the heroine as a scheming shrew, who used her beauty 
to ensnare Rumplestiltskin into falling deeply in love with her, and who came 
to a very sticky end after she betrayed him and he snatched her first-born 
child away. The version we all know from childhood changes the focus of the 
story completely, so the ugly, un-socially-acceptible Rumplestilskin becomes 
the bogeyman. Revisionism in action.</P>
<P>The reason I'm mentioning this is that it draws an astonishing parallel with
the Walt Disney of today, Pocahontas being the absolute definitive in this
respect. However, Cinderella is the Walt Disney of the past and is Disney at
it's best.</P>
<P>The plot is simple: Cinderella's father dies, and she becomes a char-lady to
her evil stepmother and two ugly sisters. Meeting a woman who claims to be
her fairy godmother and transforms her into a vision of beauty, she attends
the Prince's ball. The Prince falls deeply in love, but because 
Cinderella must leave at midnight, he only has a glass slipper with which
to find her. A search ensues, Cinderella is found, they are married and
live happily ever after. O.K., nothing earth shattering there, but Disney
have managed to take all their stock effects and tie them into a lovely
unified whole around the simple storyline.</P>
<P>As far as the plot goes ( we were talking about revisionism remember ), some
liberties are taken. In the original fairy tale, the two ugly sisters managed
to fit their feet into the glass slippers by cutting their toes and heels off,
and were only discovered because of the blood seeping out. At the end of the
story, the stepmother and sisters as punishment had their eyes put out, and 
their tongues cut off, and were made to wander the streets as beggars. But
really, you can't blame Disney for ommitting these little things. I doubt
that an animated image of two women mutilating their feet would appeal
to the younger audience. :)</P>
<P>The songs are simple and kept to a minimum. The comic relief characters
( the mice and the fairy-godmother ) are well-used througout the film
and are tied in well with the plot, and the villain of the piece, the
evil stepmother exudes a delicious air of evil. The weakest characters
surprisingly are the ugly sisters, who are rather underutilised, and
could have been depicted as more comic-evil than as they are portrayed, which
is vindictive-nasty. One of the main criticisms one can make of
the early Disney films is that the heroines were rather bland and ineffectual,
witness Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty. With Cinderella, Disney give us
a much more rounded character as a heroine, and the film hangs together
around her, rather than the supporting characters.</P>
<P>The animation, as usual is excellent. Cinderella I suppose is a early to mid 
Disney piece, and is all clean lines and subtle shades, where the animative 
focus is on the characters rather than the background. It lacks both the 
realism of earlier and recent Disney work and the minimalism of mid-period,
and is a sort of halfway-house between the two. It works though, and works
very well. As personal preference goes, it is probably my favourite of the
animation styles Disney have tinkered with so far.</P>
<P>Anyway, my son loves the film and so do I. (Probably for different reasons,
I've always held a bit of a flame for Cinderella.) and I award the film:</P>
<PRE>**** (four stars) out of five.</PRE>
