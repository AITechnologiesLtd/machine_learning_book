A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Peter Weir</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Andrew Niccol</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone,
and Ed Harris</P>
<P>Ingredients: Unsuspecting suburban guy, Hollywood director</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In the island town of Seahaven, insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey) is a Joe everyman who seems to have everything a typical guy
could reasonably want. He lives in a sunny upper middle class suburb
reminiscent of the idyllic Hollywood version of the late 1950s. He's
married to a pretty nurse named Meryl (Laura Linney). He's got a blue
collar beer buddy named Marlon (Noah Emmerich) whom he has supposedly
been best friends with all his life.  </P>
<P>But there are cracks in this bright, picture perfect, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER
neighborhood. For example, near Truman's home, a pedestrian carrying
flowers, a Volkswagon car, and a person on a bicycle are circling around
the block in an infinite loop. And why, during an argument between
Truman and his wife, does Meryl suddenly pick up a jar of Mocococoa
chocolate and do a product placement ad? One day, from out of a clear
blue sky, a big mysterious Hollywood stage light inexplicably drops and
breaks as Truman is walking down the street. Truman begins to look
closely at things and soon stumbles onto the fact that all is not as it
seems. The result is an excellent comedy/adventure.</P>
<P>Will the slightly paranoid Truman want to escape the perfect and
comfortable illusion of life at Seahaven?</P>
<P>Opinion:
When critics give a movie the highest rating of four stars, folks in my
neighborhood suspect that the film is either overrated, or that someone
paid off the movie critic (in order to jumpstart a stronger opening
weekend for an otherwise lame film). The question is, is THE TRUMAN SHOW
as good as the hype says it is? </P>
<P>Getting straight to the point: Yes! THE TRUMAN SHOW is well written,
well cast, well performed and excellently filmed. TRUMAN is funny both
in the goofy physical sense, and in terms of inside jokes and sardonic
wit. As a plus, aside from being an engaging adventure, THE TRUMAN SHOW
is relevant to modern issues. The film manages to be funny, touching,
and meaningful at the same time.</P>
<P>THE TRUMAN SHOW is not a Disneyesque kids comedy (small children would
probably not understand it). Rather than playing a hyperactive comedian,
Jim Carrey steals the show with his performance as a sweet ordinary guy
who discovers, with some comic paranoia, the ultimate fakeness of his
world. To his credit (and director Peter Weir's), Carrey never hams it
up or overacts. He keeps it subtle, and as a result, succeeds
brilliantly. For example, Truman tries at various times to communicate
with his wife; she interrupts the conversations to espouse the virtues
of such items as brand name potato peelers and lawn mowers, and; he
looks at her quizzically, his face slowly revealing hilarious,
increasing paranoia.</P>
<P>For TV trivia fans, TRUMAN serves up a fun assortment of inside pop
references. It throws little jibes at 101 DALMATIONS, FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN, the Doublemint Gum twins, and dozens of other little goodies.
Even the names are rife with symbolism: Truman Burbank (true man,
suburb, bank); Meryl (Blond actress); Seahaven (sea, haven). My favorite
is Ed Harris playing the egotistical (he wears a little French beret)
island movie director Christof. This is a parody of contemporary
European artist Christo, who in 1983 surrounded some islands near
Florida with 6.5 million square feet of pink polypropylene.</P>
<P>Finally, THE TRUMAN SHOW offers an intriguing thought. At one point
Truman discovers that TV 'reality' is in fact a doctored creation. We
crack jokes about an American President we've never met; we cry over a
princess we've never met; we exult over the victories of a sports hero
we've never met; we fume over a foreign dictator we've never met. That's
the nature of our own information age reality - -  a reality where
carefully spun and tailored script characters and dramas are felt as
keenly as life at hand, and are accepted as real and normal behavior by
young children.</P>
<P>THE TRUMAN SHOW is a brilliant piece of writing by scriptwriter Andrew
Niccol. I highly recommend this film, and it is probably no exaggeration
to say that THE TRUMAN SHOW is one of the most important movies of the
1990s decade if not the century.</P>
