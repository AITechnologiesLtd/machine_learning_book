<PRE>                              BROADWAY BOUND
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>106 min., not rated, Drama/Comedy, 1992
Director: Paul Bogart
Cast: Anne Bancroft, Hume Cronyn, Corey Parker,
      Jonathan Silverman, Jerry Orbach, Michele Lee</P>
<P>     BROADWAY BOUND takes place in Brighton Beach, New York in 1948.
Brothers Corey Parker and Jonathan Silverman are working on a sketch
that they think might get them into television writing.  Michele Lee,
Parker's aunt, tries to convince Hume Cronyn, Parker's grandfather, to
move to Florida with his wife.  Cronyn doesn't want to because he likes
it on Brighton Beach.  Anne Bancroft (Parker's mother) and Jerry
Orbach's (Parker's father) marriage is threatened by their frequent
arguments.</P>
<P>     BROADWAY BOUND was written for television by Neil Simon based on
his play.  It is a sequel to Simon's earlier play BRIGHTON BEACH
MEMOIRS, which was made into a movie in 1986.  Jonathan Silverman was
Eugene in the movie version of BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS.  In BROADWAY
BOUND, Jonathan Silverman plays Stan, Eugene's older brother.  BROADWAY
BOUND continues the story from BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS, which was set in
the 1930's.</P>
<P>     I found BROADWAY BOUND to be both a funny and touching film.  Like
most of Neil Simon's plays, BROADWAY BOUND has dramatic roots.  The
family is in danger of being broken up.  The sons are trying to get into
television comedy writing which at times gets them all stressed out.
The parents are having problems living together and are constantly
fighting.  This causes a conflict with the boys too, because they are
aware of the fighting but aren't supposed to talk about it.  The
grandfather's wife, who the grandfather hasn't lived with for years, has
to move to Florida because she can't take the cold winters and one of
his daughters wants him to go down to live with his wife because his
daughter thinks that he is getting too old for cold winters too.  But
yet, though out the film there are comedy bits thrown in such that they
don't take away from the dramatic part of the film but provide a relief
so that the drama doesn't get too heavy and bog you down.</P>
<P>     BROADWAY BOUND is heavier on the drama than BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS
was and a little bit lighter on the comedy.  I definitely recommend
BROADWAY BOUND for any fan of Neil Simon or anybody who saw BRIGHTON
BEACH MEMOIRS and liked it.  This would probably not be the best film
for someone who easily gets depressed because there are some very sad
scenes in the film.  On a scale of zero to five, I give BROADWAY BOUND a
four.  BROADWAY BOUND is made-for-television, ABC to be specific, so it
doesn't contain anything objectionable.  Because it is made-for-
television, if you missed it, you will either have to wait for it to be
repeated, find a friend who taped it, or watch to see if it comes to
video in several months.</P>
<P>     BROADWAY BOUND is one of those films that is written so well you
actually start believing that the people in it are real.  In fact, this
film may be semi-autobiographical since BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS was
semi-autobiographical.  Because the characters are so believable, I
found my self feeling sorry for one of them when something went wrong
and happy when something went right.  That is one of the things that
made me like this movie.</P>
