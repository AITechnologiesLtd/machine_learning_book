A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jonathan Frakes</PRE>
<P>Written by: Rich Berman and Michael Piller</P>
<P>Starring: Patrick Stewart, Donna Murphy, Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes,
Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden, F. Murray
Abraham</P>
<P>Ingredients: Forced displacement of ethnic minorities, idealistic
starship captain</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
An idyllic planet has rings around it that emit mysterious metaphasic
radiation, creating an anti-aging effect similar to that of the fabled
Fountain of Youth. In order to covet this valuable resource for
themselves, the greedy United Federation of Planets and their ally the
mysterious Ru'afo of the Son'a race (F. Murray Abraham) try to forcibly
relocate the planet's inhabitants: 600 peaceful Ba'ku villagers, who
have renounced technology and don't wish to be relocated. </P>
<P>Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the Federation starship
USS Enterprise decide that forced relocation of minorities is an immoral
violation of the Prime Directive (the law preventing the Federation from
interfering with the development of other societies). They side with the
villagers and lead an insurrection against Ru'afo's forces.</P>
<P>In the subplot, Picard falls in love with Anij, a Ba'ku woman who is
over 300 years old. </P>
<P>Opinion:
In 1962 racism in America was so rampant that George Wallace won his
governorship supporting the separation of Whites from non-Whites. Only
about three years later came Gene Rodenberry's space adventure series
Star Trek - - a disguised method for 1960s people to examine their own
attitudes towards war, racism and international cooperation.
Roddenberry's Star Trek was not so much about the future as it was about
current issues and moral dilemmas. Advocating a more multicultural
society, it helped shape America.</P>
<P>Like its 1960s predecessor, STAR TREK: INSURRECTION has a strong moral
tint to it: questioning whether the greater good of the majority (the
Federation) outweighs the needs of the minority (the Ba'ku). This
agonizing question, which has plagued humanity for centuries, is decided
in about 5 minutes by the Enterprise crew. Then they have a short,
bloodless war, where a child must predictably run back to look for his
beloved lost pet despite an avalanche of falling rocks. And in the
aftermath, the heroes ride off into the sunset without regard to how
future conflicts over the metaphasic resource might occur or be
prevented; or how their use of technology has affected the villagers
whose culture has vowed to renounce technology; or the politics of
disobeying Federation military orders. </P>
<P>STAR TREK: INSURRECTION clocks in at about an hour and 43 minutes.
Somewhat escapist, the film leaves the juicy, formidable questions
unanswered. But it is still plenty enjoyable in the way that TV episodes
are: nice, neat, and sanitized. After an intriguing beginning, there is
no shortage of action in the second half to keep Trekkies and
non-Trekkies satisfied.</P>
