<PRE>                               KNIGHT MOVES
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., R, Suspense/Mystery, 1993
Director: Carl Schenkel
Cast: Christopher Lambert, Diane Lane, Tom Skerritt, Daniel Baldwin,
      Charles Bailey-Gates, Alex Diakun</P>
<P>     Christopher Lambert is a Grandmaster chess competitor.  While the
competition is going on, a serial killer starts killing females, and
Lambert is the only suspect that Tom Skerritt, the police chief, has.
The killer starts playing a game with Lambert to see if Lambert can
catch the killer before the game is over.  Skerritt and his partner
Daniel Baldwin have psychiatrist Diane Lane called in to investigate
Lambert to see if he is doing the killings.</P>
<P>     KNIGHT MOVES is an excellent suspense film that I suggest that you
see soon, because I don't think that it will be in the theaters for
long, even though it was released this weekend.  I think that KNIGHT
MOVES is worth full admission price and is a must see.  On a scale of
zero to five, I give KNIGHT MOVES a five.  KNIGHT MOVES is rated R for
explicit language, female nudity, adult situations, and graphic
violence.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film is excellent.  Christopher Lambert
(HIGHLANDER, GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF TARZAN LORD OF THE APES) is very
good.  Diane Lane (CHAPLIN, NATIONAL LAMPOON GOES TO THE MOVIES) is the
reason that I went to see this film.  I am a fan of her work, and I am
pleased to say that she is excellent.  Tom Skerritt (POISON IVY [1992
version], WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE) is the other reason to see
this film.  He is usually a great actor and this film is no exception.
Daniel Baldwin gives a good performance.</P>
<P>     KNIGHT MOVES is very well written and quite suspenseful.  This film
is not very gory, so those of you with weak stomachs won't be bothered
if you see this film.  The director, Carl Schenkel does a wonderful job
of creating a suspenseful atmosphere in this film.</P>
<P>     I especially enjoyed how the beginning credits of the film were
done.  They created an air of mystery, right from the beginning.  I also
thought that doing them in black and white probably enhanced the effect.</P>
