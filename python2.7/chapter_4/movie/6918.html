<PRE>                            BEVERLY HILLS NINJA
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) ** out of ***** - Cast:Chris Farley, Nicollette
Sheridan, Chris Rock. Writers:Mark Feldberg and Mitch Klebanoff. Director:
Dennis Dugan.</P>
<P>Director Dugan's previous film "Happy Gilmore" was basically a one-joke film,
but with bite to it thanks to Adam Sandler and the on-the-edge character
that he played. "Beverly Hills Ninja" is also a one-joke film, but the joke
is presented in the first minute of the film and then is beaten to death for
another 90 minutes.</P>
<P>Chris Farley ("Tommy Boy") again plays a big klutz, thankfully he knows his
range and won't try to stretch beyond his abilities. This time out he's an
orphan who was discovered by a group of ninjas who take him into their care
and raise him according to their ways. They believe him to be "The Great
White Ninja", an ancient legend of the ninja. One day, all the ninjas go out
on a mission and leave him behind, because he's so inept. While causing mass
destruction just hanging around at his home, a damsel in distress (Sheridan)
comes to hire a ninja. (Boy, this really seems ridiculous as I write it, and
you know they didn't pitch any of the actual story to the studio. I'm sure
all they said was "It's Chris Farley as a clumsy ninja! Huh? How about that?
100 million easy!").</P>
<P>Well, Sheridan's appearance causes Farley to follow her to Beverly Hills,
California (Get it? Beverly Hills Ninja? It's funny!). Once there, it's
another "fish-out-of-water" story of sorts, as Farley gets to discover all
the wonders of America (basically just hotels and strip clubs). He meets up
with a bellboy (Rock, in an annoying performance) and they search for
whatever it is that is supposed to be going on at this point. All I can tell
you is that Chris Farley gets hurt a lot, and that's supposed to be funny.</P>
<P>"Beverly Hills Ninja" (along with last year's "Black Sheep") proves why
"Tommy Boy" worked as a comedy. "Tommy Boy" was funny because Farley is doing
his schtick, but someone is there to make fun of it. That's what's funny,
making fun of the idiot. Here, Farley does his schtick, and that's it.
Farley's antics, by themselves, are just not funny. His character is nothing
but yet another rip-off of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau character, but
without one ounce of intelligence.</P>
