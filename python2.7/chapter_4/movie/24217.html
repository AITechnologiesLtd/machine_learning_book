<PRE>The Omega Code (1999)
Rating: 1.0 stars out of 5.0 stars</PRE>
<P>Cast: Casper Van Dien, Michael York, Michael Ironside, Catherine
Oxenberg, William Hootkins 
Written by: Stephen Blinn and Hollis Barton  
Directed by: Robert Marcarelli 
Running Time: 99 minutes </P>
<P>Preposterous religious action film (produced by the Trinity Broadcasting
Network) about a code hidden within the text of the Bible that when
deciphered will lead to the end of the world (nice of those Bible
authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh?). 
Michael York plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets
out to become God on Earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies, while
Casper Van Dien (terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a
result) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him. </P>
<P>Michael Ironside (great as always, despite the silly film surrounding
him) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to Michael York's
character.  Here's some subtle character development you may have missed
pertaining to Ironside's character.  Now despite the fact that we see
him murder a man in the opening scene, the filmmakers aren't quite sure
if their audience will understand that he is evil.  How do they fix
that?  Make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one
in the film who smokes!  There are lots of ominous shots of Michael
Ironside smoking... oooooo scary.  But even that wasn't enough for the
filmmakers apparently, as they later have to infer that Ironside's
character is gay!  It comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense. </P>
<P>My main problem with this film is that, despite the silly story (which
could have been pulled off... anything can be made believable if
executed correctly), the events of the film aren't shown with any sense
of urgency or importance.  For example, at one point York's character is
declared chancellor of the world or something, and we see one brief,
cheesy news report about it.  The movie keeps telling us that the
apocalypse is coming, but it never seems that way.  There's no "world
reaction" to anything. </P>
<P>The Omega Code is available on DVD from Goodtimes Home Video.  It
contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and
includes the original theatrical trailer, a documentary on the making of
the film, production notes, and cast and crew information. </P>
<P>The documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good
(it looks as though it was made for broadcast on TBN), and it does a
comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and
crew (with the exception of Michael Ironside, unfortunately).  The best
thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed, they do an
excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they
do on a movie set.  Most documentaries tend to overlook this.  Doomsday
expert Hal Lindsey is even interviewed (you'll remember his documentary
from the 1970's called The Late Great Planet Earth, where Lindsey
speculated that Jimmy Carter might actually be the antichrist). </P>
<P>However, at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the
film managed to get on my bad side.  When interviewed they actually have
the nerve to say "Ever see Raiders of the Lost Ark?  Well, our film is
like that!"  No it isn't.  Not by a long shot.  [PG-13]</P>
