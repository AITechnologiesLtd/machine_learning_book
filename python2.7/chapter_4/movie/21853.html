<PRE>"The Truman Show"
Starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Natasha McElhone
Directed by Peter Weir
Written by Andrew Niccol
Grade: A</PRE>
<P>Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a man who lives in a perfect world with a
perfect job and a perfect wife.  Little does he know that his life is the
center of a 24 hour widely popular television show known as The Truman Show. He
is surrounded by actors in one huge dome studio and is constantly watched by a
variety of cameras, which are hidden throughout the city. </P>
<P>"The Truman Show" is a creative and enjoyable movie which is wonderfully acted
and directed.  Jim Carrey, known mostly for his rubber faced gags and his
talking rear end, takes a surprising and effective turn to drama as Truman,
similar to how Robin Williams has succeeded in the last decade.  Carrey is so
believable and likeable that you feel shame for his character and cheer him on
during the film.  He also uses humor to his advantage, making The Truman Show
even more entertaining.  </P>
<P>Ed Harris gives one of his best performances, as well, as the creator of The
Truman Show, who is extremely picky about using the right cameras, the right
actors, and the right scenery.  Harris adds a powerful god like appearance to
the movie as his obsession towards the show and Truman's life for over thirty
years makes him a creepy villain unlike the average "bad guy" of current
movies. </P>
<P>Peter Weir masterfully directs The Truman Show using unordinary camera angles
to emphasize that the cameras are watching Truman no matter where he goes. Weir
also creates a magnificent set from an elaborate city to a sea that never seems
to end. He cleverly displays advertisements in random places and errors of the
show's production ( a studio light falls from the sky) reminding the viewer
that it is live television and some faults will occur.  Throughout the movie he
asks the viewer whether the city should continue to entertain the world or  if
it should halt for the sake of one innocent, unknowing man.  The Truman Show is
not your ordinary movie. Its detailed 1984-ish plot, its powerful acting, and
its phenomenal directing make it one of the
best movies of the 1990's. </P>
