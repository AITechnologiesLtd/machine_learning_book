Bringing Out the Dead (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Nicolas Cage,
Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore. Written by
Paul Schrader. Directed by Martin Scorsese.</P>
<P> Even a mediocre Martin Scorsese film has some interesting moments.</P>
<P> And a few are interspersed in "Bringing Out the Dead" another trek down
the wet, dark and dangerous streets of New York.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, Scorsese has taken us down these streets before, most
notably in "Taxi Driver," to which "Bringing Out the Dead" is a distant
cousin.</P>
<P> Like that earlier classic, "Bringing Out the Dead" features a protagonist
who also narrates throughout, and who, while not a Travis Bickle-like
psychopath, shows an air of disgust toward the human refuse that floats
around him.</P>
<P> Frank Pierce, though, does not drive a taxi. His vehicle is an ambulance.
Pierce is an EMS paramedic. He's a burnt-out, hollowed-eye hulk of a man,
who wants to get a good night's sleep as well as chase away the ghosts of
the various people he treated but did not survive.</P>
<P> The most frequent specter is that of Rose, a young woman whose death
continually haunts Frank. Every face he sees reminds him of Rose. The guilt
weighs him down like an anchor.</P>
<P> One night, Frank meets Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), a one-time junkie,
after he takes her father - who has suffered a heart attack - to the
hospital.</P>
<P> He hopes by saving Mary's father that it will be his first step on the
road to redemption.</P>
<P> The problem with "Bringing Out the Dead," based on the novel by Joe
Connelly and adapted by the legendary Paul Schrader, is that the story
really doesn't go anywhere.</P>
<P> Cage gives a one-note performance. He merely stares out the ambulance
window with his hound-dog eyes, wishing he were anywhere but on the job.</P>
<P> Arquette is no better. She merely mopes about, worrying about her father,
commenting on how she hated the man, but - because of his heart attack -
wants to make things right with him.</P>
<P> As Frank's various partners, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore
are more types than real people. They are interchangeable foils for Frank's
various close encounters with the disenfranchised.</P>
<P> What keeps the film  from being a total loss is some of the dark humor
Schrader has invested in the script. To keep their sanity, the paramedics
drink, beat on their ambulances, use their own drugs and sometimes beat up
on the people they are paid to save.</P>
<P> These are men at the breaking point, who deal with human suffering every
day, who use any method they can devise to block out the misery surrounding
them.</P>
<P> "Bringing Out the Dead" is not as vicious or depressing as "Taxi Driver."
It does offer a ray of hope and redemption. Its New York is more of a
surreal nightmare rather than the hell on earth envisioned by Travis Bickle.</P>
<P> But in the end, "Bringing Out the Dead" falls flat. It lacks substance and
weight. Scorsese has given us a flashy picture show, nothing more.</P>
