<P>     HIDEAWAY, director Brett Leonard's adaptation of the novel by Dean 
R. Koontz, is about a man who is resuscitated after having crossed 
death's threshold.  Considering what happens after Hatch Harrison is 
reborn, it might have been better for everyone--both the characters in 
the film and those unfortunate souls in the audience--had he stayed 
dead.  In fact, this entire production should have been consigned to a 
very deep grave. </P>
<P>     Jeff Goldblum plays Hatch, a man with a more serious problem than 
his unorthodox, pulp-fiction like name.  After "dying" in a car crash, he 
is revived by a brilliant doctor (Alfred Molina), but since his return, 
he has started having all sorts of sick visions.  Apparently, he has 
brought something back with him from the other side, and now he has a 
bizarre symbiotic relationship with a serial killer.  Each can "see" 
through the other's eyes.  And the sicko has decided that Hatch's 
daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone) might make a tasty victim. </P>
<P>     If an excruciatingly bad ending can ruin a good movie, what can it 
do to a film that's already beyond redemption?  HIDEAWAY provides an 
emphatic answer to that question.  As the climax unfolds, with its deluge 
of computer-generated not-all-that-special effects, jaws are likely to 
drop--not at the wonder of the images, but at the mind-boggling 
stupidity of what's happening.  And don't be surprised if there are a few 
snickers, as well.   </P>
<P>     If nothing else, the concluding pyrotechnics roused me from the 
stupor the rest of the movie had put me into.  In this case, spending 
over one-hundred minutes with Jeff Goldblum and Christine Lahti becomes a 
trying experience, especially considering the moronic level of the plot.  
Lahti is adequate as the worried wife, but the normally-reliable Goldblum 
is unconvincing, never connecting with his character or the audience.  
And, based on the merit of her performance here, Alicia Silverstone (last 
seen terrorizing Cary Elwes in THE CRUSH) isn't ready for an Oscar 
nomination, either.   </P>
<P>     Early on, HIDEAWAY almost fools its audience, but it doesn't take 
long for us to realize that we're not watching a legitimate psychological 
thriller.  HIDEAWAY is pretty poor entertainment, and what starts out as 
a superficial trip into the occult ends with a pointless, overblown fight 
to the death.  "Overblown" is the key word here, because a pair of very 
special supernatural entities make cameo appearances.  I don't want to 
drop any names, but one of them was a lot more impressive handing 
Charlton Heston some tablets in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. </P>
<P>     I haven't read the book by Koontz upon which this material is based, 
but the author himself seems extremely put out by what appears on screen, 
having publicly stated the he finds it "astonishingly incoherent, filled 
with contradictions and moronic logic."  Not exactly a ringing 
endorsement.  And as for how Neal Jiminez (THE WATERDANCE) got mixed up 
in this--well, even the most promising writers have bad days.  
Hopefully, HIDEAWAY will go away ... fast. </P>
