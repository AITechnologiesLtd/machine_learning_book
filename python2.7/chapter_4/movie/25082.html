<P>No sooner do I lament the failure of imported Hong Kong superstars to match
their earlier work than I have to retract it.  (You can find the tirade in my
review of "Shanghai Noon").  Just when I least expected it, director John Woo
has given us a feast for the eyes in "Mission: Impossible 2."  It's been a 
long
wait, watching his American movies for hints of the action-master who directed
"The Killer" and "Hard Boiled."  Woo came to Hollywood to make 1993's "Hard
Target" and followed it with "Broken Arrow," "Face/Off," and a few made-for-TV
projects.  All of these movies show at least the fingerprints of Woo in
trademark moments like the hero leaping with two .45 automatics blazing, but
none of the movies reflected the Woo we knew from his Hong Kong works.  I did
not expect this situation to change with "M:I-2," the most-hyped movie of the
summer, because the studio pressure would likely be intense.  But I was wrong </P>
