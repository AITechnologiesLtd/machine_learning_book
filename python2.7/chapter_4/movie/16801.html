<P>The week after the release of 'Blast from the Past' (set partly in the 
early 1960's), 'October Sky' opened in American theaters.  Set around 
the time of the Sputnik launch, 'Sky' is the superior of the two films.</P>
<P>The opening shots establish the story in the town of Coalwood, West 
Virginia in October of 1957, scenes of Americana drifting by - a barber 
paused in his shaving of a patron, folks gathered in a diner, all 
listening to reports of the shot heard and seen around the world, the 
start of the space race.  The camera settles in a classroom of Big Creek 
High School, where Miss Riley (Laura Dern) tells her charges that the 
Russian launch is a milestone in history.  Some students are cynical, 
and later we hear one comment, "Let 'em have space.  We have rock 'n' 
roll!"</P>
<P>Seventeen year-old Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) loses himself in 
dreams of rockets after the townspeople are held spellbound by the 
actual satellite moving across the sky, disappearing behind a wooded 
mountain.  When Homer makes up his mind to find out all he can about 
rocketry, he enlists the help of the school nerd, Quentin (Chris Owen) 
and two old buddies, Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad 
Lindberg).  Their first attempt is a cylinder filled with bottle rocket 
powder, a contraption that takes out a goodly section of Mrs. Hickam's 
white picket fence.  What follows is the boys' determined efforts to rig 
and launch a workable missile.  John Hickam (Chris Cooper), manager of 
the town's industry, the Olga Coal Company, forbids anything related to 
rockets on company property.  So the foursome walks the eight miles to 
Snake Root, where they construct a pad on a massive slag pile.</P>
<P>A good deal of humor accrues when the launches fail again and again.  
The homemade rockets explode in various manners - before they leave the 
ground, a few feet in the air, or after a series of mis-aimed - and at 
times dangerous - short flights.  Of course the boys meet various 
obstacles, including continued resistance from Homer's dad, and a run-in 
with the police.  Will they succeed even in entering the regional 
science fair, an event that Miss Riley says may lead to the national 
fair, and on to possible college scholarships?  In other words, will the 
boys stumble upon a way out of a future of toil and black lung disease, 
of living in company houses in a town that exists, literally, to mine 
coal?</P>
<P>Director Joe Johnston and screenwriter Lewis Colick make good use of 
this theme of taking a shot at the American dream.  Their story moves 
logically, if a bit predictably, the boys meeting and outsmarting one 
problem after another.  Perhaps we believe in their successes so readily 
because we are told early about the true basis for the film.  Homer H. 
Hickam Jr. wrote the memoir 'Rocket Boys', and the historical tone set 
by the plot events serves to convince viewers of accuracy.</P>
<P>Tinged by nostalgia, the film shows us several sides of American life.  
We watch the boys grow through an important stage, one which pits them 
against the trials of young manhood.  Yes, it's a cliché when they try 
to get a leg-up on their way out of dreary futures, but their plights 
are all the more poignant because of the time: we ask ourselves if these 
conditions could have existed so recently.</P>
<P>A result of solid casting, the acting in the film is outstanding.  Laura 
Dern is the biggest name but has a smallish part.  Though her accent 
sounds like it comes from parts south of West Virginia, Dern is 
thoroughly convincing as a teacher gutsy enough to stand up to a 
principal who says, "We're here to give these boys an education, not 
false hopes."  Chris Cooper is a veteran character actor who plays John 
Hickam as a hard man. Our distance toward him changes continuously.  We 
dislike him when he busts a company machinist for helping Homer weld a 
steel washer onto a rocket;  we like him for his strange reveling at 
being good at what he does - knowing the mine like a man, and saving 
many men from crippling or fatal accidents.  Cooper plays well an 
average-looking man up thrown in against not only a tough job, but his 
son's vision of a life that doesn't include coal mining.</P>
<P>But Jake Gyllenhaal is the big discovery here.  This young man has no 
trouble pretending the camera isn't there.  His looks and mannerisms are 
thoroughly American - tough, independent, fun-loving.   He also carries 
scenes without overshadowing the actors around him.</P>
<P>The photography is mostly seamless, getting the job done without calling 
too much attention to itself.  There is a shot that lingers just too 
long on the maw of the mineshaft elevator - the hole down which the 
lives of Coalwood's men disappear.  Other scenes are edited masterfully, 
especially the montages of the boys' mishaps.  Long shots of rocket 
ascents inspire the proper awe.</P>
<P>The score is punctuated by period songs, early rock and roll standards 
that help set the mood even faster than the vintage sedans parked all 
over the streets.  Important scenes are frequently accompanied by a lone 
violin wavering between classical air and fiddle piece.</P>
<P>Why is 'October Sky' better than 'Blast from the Past'?  Their different 
natures would warrant a much longer review.  The main point of 
comparison is the handling of mid-century America.  'Blast from the 
Past' picks and chooses film clips about the Cuban missile crisis and 
sets that highlight early 60's interior decoration, all in service of a 
romantic comedy with big name players.  'October Sky' is a smaller film 
that shows slices of grittier realism, a vehicle that recalls a time 
filled both with prosperity and anxiety.  Although the last several 
minutes are filled with too many plot twists, and perhaps try too hard 
to avoid sentimentality, 'October Sky' is a strong addition to the canon 
of truly American tales.</P>
