<P>     At the beginning, Claude Chabrol's creepy, atmospheric thriller, LA 
CEREMONIE, looks like it's going to be another entry into the popular 
"stranger among us" genre.  And, while the film never completely frees 
itself from this label, it's everything that THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE 
CRADLE wasn't:  dire, tense, unpredictable, and, ultimately, satisfying.  
LA CEREMONIE isn't movie-making by numbers; it's the work of an adept 
director intent on using dialogue and tone to drive his story.</P>
<P>     LA CEREMONIE, based on the novel A JUDGMENT IN STONE by mystery 
writer Ruth Rendell, introduces us to Sophie (Sandrine Bonnaire), a 
humorless, efficient woman who has applied for the position of live-in 
maid for the rich Lelievres.  After a brief interview with Catherine 
Lelievre (Jacqueline Bisset), she's hired.  Several days later, she 
reports to work -- a large, isolated house in the French countryside -- 
and meets the rest of the family.  There's Georges (Jean-Pierre Cassel), 
the stern, erudite patriarch; Gilles (Valentin Merlet), the couple's 
son; and Melinda (Virginie Ledoyen), Georges' pretty daughter from a 
previous marriage, who stops by every once in a while when she has a 
break at college.  </P>
<P>     It's a lonely life for Sophie, who, lacking friends, throws herself 
wholeheartedly into her work.  At nights, she holes up in her room 
gazing glassy-eyed at TV game shows while the family chats away 
downstairs or watches DON GIOVANNI on their big-screen TV (with the 
audio hooked up to an expensive stereo system).  Eventually, Sophie 
makes a friend, but, as far as the Lelievres are concerned, it's the 
wrong friend.  Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert) is a gossipy postal clerk with 
a disturbed history who manipulates her way into Sophie's confidence.  
It's clear that she has a grudge against the Lelievres, but uncertain 
how far she's willing to go to settle the score.</P>
<P>     LA CEREMONIE succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is the 
expert way in which Chabrol develops the tension.  Scene after scene, he 
raises it almost imperceptibly, drawing us in through the slow-moving 
plot that gains momentum as it charges towards a devastating finale.  
There's also a sardonic, ironic quality to the film that is never more 
apparent than at the end, as the closing credits crawl over LA 
CEREMONIE's concluding images.</P>
<P>     One area where Chabrol meets with only limited success is in his 
approach to Sophie.  The problem is that, despite attempts to flesh her 
out, she never attains the multi-dimensionality necessary to make her 
real to the audience.  Even Sophie's struggles with her dark secret 
(she's illiterate and ashamed of it) don't do more than fill in a few 
blanks.  And it can be argued that Sandrine Bonnaire's icy performance 
is a little too distant, which only adds to the gulf between character 
and audience.  The rest of the cast is quite good, especially Virginie 
Ledoyen as the sympathetic Melinda and Isabelle Huppert as the scheming 
Jeanne.</P>
<P>     Chabrol takes a number of calculated shots at France's pampered 
upper class, showing rather graphically how offensive their attempts at 
sympathy can be.  What seems to Catherine and Georges like a genuine 
attempt to take an interest in bettering Sophie's life comes across to 
the object of their "kindness" as unwanted and condescending.  Of 
course, it doesn't help that Jeanne is always on hand, ready to apply 
the most unflattering interpretation to anything the family does.</P>
<P>     Those who have seen films like HEAVENLY CREATURES, FUN, and SISTER 
MY SISTER will recognize similar themes running through those films and 
this one:  two people influencing each other in such a manner that, 
together, they act in a way that neither would act alone.  Chabrol does 
not develop this scenario quite as well as the above mentioned films do, 
but LA CEREMONIE is invested with enough creepiness and skill that the 
payoff is worth enduring any rough spots along the way.</P>
