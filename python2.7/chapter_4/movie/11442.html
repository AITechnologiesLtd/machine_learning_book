<PRE>Mahler (1974) 115m. </PRE>
<P>Eighth and last of Ken Russell's composer biographies (I think its
safe enough to discount LISZTOMANIA), which I walked seven miles to
see as a teenager when it appeared in a one-off screening.  Film is
still as difficult to see nowadays, but undoubtedly of interest to
Russell fans.  Story recaps the life of Austrian Jew Gustav Mahler
(Robert Powell) while he takes one last Freudian train journey back to
Vienna with his wife Alma (Georgina Hale).  Film doesn't reach the
heights of other Russell opuses but is still more interesting than
most slick productions you'll see in the mainstream.  The main problem
with it is that Mahler himself isn't that interesting and doesn't lead
a particularly exceptional life.  Granted, he did find fame and
success as a conducter (and something of a monstre sacre) but the same
could be said about a novelist, and the idea of watching someone
writing a book for two hours doesn't appeal to me either.  Another
problem Russell has to contend with is Mahler's music - it doesn't
have the instant appeal of other composers he has handled, and is an
acquired taste to anyone unfamiliar with 20th century composition. 
Neither does it seem to choreograph well with Russell's images - it
doesn't inspire me to buy the soundtrack, anyway, which I presume is
part of the reason Russell wanted to make this film, i.e.  to pay
homage to an artist he admired while bringing his life and work to a
mass audience with the same pop sensibilities he would use the
following year in TOMMY.</P>
<P>Russell gives his film visual impetus to keep his audience watching -
apart from the framing device of the train, MAHLER is made up almost
wholly of dream sequences, fantasies, and offbeat set-pieces.  But it
all seems flat this time around.  Maybe that's because many of the
heavily symbolic, hallucinatory images are immediately followed by
postscripts in which the characters explain to each other what we have
just watched.  However, I can also see this as Russell's way of
defusing accusations that he is being pretentious.  The most jarring
of these sequences is Mahler's conversion to Catholicism, filmed as if
it were a silent comedy (Russell himself is a Catholic convert, which
may explain his interest in this part of Mahler's life).  As a
stand-alone sequence it's a lot of fun, but it looks like it was
dropped in from a different movie.  MAHLER's preponderance with
visuals also reminds us that Russell is more of a technical director
than an actor's director.  His characters all sound alike - it's
obviously Russell dialogue that they're speaking.  Hale, as Alma, has
to switch from petulant to sweet to hardened to despairing, while
Powell just looks like a gloomy guy in a hat.  The logic behind
Powell's saturnine performance is explained at the end, when we
discover he has tonsillitis (a precursor to his death shortly after),
but by then it's too late for us to really care.</P>
<P>Still, Russell has enthusiasm, and does well with a limited budget
(instead of filming in Europe he once again returned to his favorite
location, the Lake District).  Mahler's daughter Anna, who was 70 at
the time of film's release, gave Russell permission to make his
biography after initial reservations about what he'd done with
Tchaikovsky in THE MUSIC LOVERS.</P>
