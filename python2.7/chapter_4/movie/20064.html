<P>Leaving aside Orson Welles, nobody else has tackled Shakespeare in all its
guts and glory, and in the beauty of the language. Kenneth Branagh's
full-throttled, four-hour version of Hamlet is the exception, and a model for
others to follow. Too often "Hamlet's" text is truncated, eschewing some of the
relationships and complex themes for simple emotions. Mel Gibson looks like a
wimp in the 1990 film version by Franco Zeffirelli; this new "Hamlet" will
leave you cheering and weeping with delight at Kenneth Branagh's bravura
performance. </P>
<P>Branagh ("Henry V") stars as the virile Prince Hamlet who is torn by the
unexpectedly quick marriage of his mother, Gertrude (Julie Christie), to the
callous, manipulative Claudius (a scene-stealing Derek Jacobi), who is stealing
the throne of Denmark. What gets Hamlet to the boiling point of madness and
despair is that he is told by his associates that Claudius murdered Hamlet's
father - this is told in an eerie sequence by the ghost of Hamlet's father
(Bard veteran Brian Blessed). When Hamlet becomes aware of this, he becomes
anxious, jealous, manipulative, depressed, vengeful, and...yes, murderous. He
also has a lost love whom he pines for, Ophelia (Kate Winslet), but he can
never bring himself to admit his love to her, or do anything about his father's
death - he's a coward in denial. His cowardice becomes more evident when he's
continually walking through his palace becoming overbearing and obviously
theatrical - this Hamlet thinks nothing of insulting everyone, including
staging a play for Claudius where a prince's father is killed alarmingly the
same way as Claudius had killed Hamlet's father! Hamlet gradually becomes more
overbearing, and even cheerful, devilish. It is no wonder that Ophelia is
understandably confused by Hamlet's behavior, she becomes crazy herself. </P>
<P>Kenneth Branagh is the perfect actor to play the bleached blonde, virile Hamlet
- he successfully brings all the character's emotions to life in a performance
I will never forget. It is outstanding how he makes us, the audience, unable to
keep up with his fast-talking rhythms and plans, but it is clear that his
madness and arrogance is leading to a path of doom - his lack of restraint
within himself is his own undoing. Derek Jacobi is simply marvelous as the
scheming Claudius - at times, he seems more dashing and in control than Hamlet,
yet it is noteworthy how Jacobi manages to mask Claudius's villainy and bring a
sense of sympathy. A round of applause must go to the return of Julie Christie
to the big screen - her Gertrude is the maternal, emotional force who tries to
heal Hamlet (I might add that Christie is at the appropriate age to play
Gertrude when comparing to the youthful Glenn Close in the Zeffirelli version).
Major pluses also go to Jack Lemmon as the doleful Marcellus, and the haunting
expressiveness of Rufus Selwell as Prince Fortrinbas who eventually brings the
throne to its knees. Kate Winslet ("Sense and Sensibility") is the ideal
Ophelia; beautiful, sad, sexy, and madly insane.</P>
<P>Despite the great performances, there are some that are superfluous at best. I
would have preferred other actors playing the First Gravedigger (Billy Crystal)
and Osric (Robin Williams) - they distract us from the genuine power of the
play and makes us feel as if we entered a Saturday Night Live special. Gerard
Depardieu's walk-on bit as Reynaldo also feels unnecessary. </P>
<P>These are minor complaints for what is a superbly crafted work of art by
Branagh. Serving as director as well, he makes the play into a visionary
landscape of both the internal and external workings of Hamlet's mind. The
vastness of the palace; the nocturnal bluish moors; the wintry scenery; the
dazzling sword duels; Rufus's army marching symmetrically into the palace; and
the moment when Hamlet tells his famous "To be or not to be" speech - these
scenes, and many more, are beautifully realized by Branagh and cinematographer
Alex Thomson.         Branagh's first film was Shakespeare's "Henry V," a powerful,
stirring film that made me want to join Henry in his battles. Since then,
Branagh has fashioned a wonderful body of work ("Dead Again," "Peter's
Friends," "Much Ado About Nothing"), and he continues to amaze. This vivid,
breathtaking "Hamlet" finally gives Shakespeare and Branagh the respect they
both deserve.</P>
