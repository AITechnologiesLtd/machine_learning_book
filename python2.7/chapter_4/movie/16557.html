<PRE>Simply Irresistible (1999)
Reviewed by Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (of4)
Directed by Mark Tarlov
Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Sean Patrick Flanery, Patricia 
Clarkson, Dylan Baker</PRE>
<P>Simply Irresistible tries really hard to recapture the feel of an old-
fashioned romantic fantasy. In fact, it tries too hard. The film 
wants to be soft, cuddly, and loveable, and succeeds only in being 
incredibly stupid. I'm usually kind to this sort of film, especially 
when there is a wonderfully charming lead performance such as Sarah 
Michelle Gellar delivers here. Unfortunately, her performance is 
comppletely wasted since the film does not provide her with a leading 
man that is a tenth as interesting as she is.</P>
<P>Gellar stars as Amanda, a chef at her small family restaraunt that is 
going out of business. One reason is that she can't cook very well at 
all. One day some guy gives her a crab (I'm not making this up), and 
all of a sudden crazy things begin to happen such as her food 
actually tasting great. People start flocking to her restaraunt and 
she has a hard time keeping up with all the customers.</P>
<P>Sean Patrick Flanery is an upper class businessman who is planning on 
opening his own restaraunt. He stops by Amanda's one day and is 
entranced by the food, eventhough his girlfriend breaks up with him 
at the same time. Amanda is instantly attracted to him and they begin 
to fall for one another. This is helped by the magic of the food, 
which creates a thick vanilla fog, and has them floating off the 
ground.</P>
<P>Flanery's character is one of the most confusing leading men in a 
romantic comedy in quite some time. At first he loves the fact that 
they are rolling around kissing in the vanilla fog. When they start 
to float, it's too much for him. He claims that he wants to be in 
control of his own destiny, and refuses to be with her alone again. 
Whenever she tries to get near him, he shouts at her and calls her a 
witch, like he's in Salem or something. What the hell is this guy's 
problem? Who wouldn't want to roll around and kiss Sarah Michelle 
Gellar in thick vanilla fog? Who wouldn't want to be holding her as 
the two of you float off the ground? It doesn't help that Flanery has 
absolutely zero charisma. His character annoyed me so much at times I 
had to look away from the screen.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, the only other interesting performance comes from 
Patricia Clarkson, as Flanery's assistant. I very much disliked her 
annoyingly mannered performance in High Art. But here she strips away 
all the extra baggage and allows her natural personality to come 
through. I found her to be rather charming in a classy, sophisticated 
way. Clarkson and Gellar do their best to make this featherweight 
film palatable, but they receive very little help. </P>
<P>The film does have some nice photography. They sure got the look of a 
old-fashioned romance right. But the most important thing in any 
romance is chemistry, and despite Gellar's best efforts, there is 
none to speak of. Other than some nice photography and two fine 
performances, Simply Irresistible offers nothing for even the least 
discriminating of viewers.</P>
