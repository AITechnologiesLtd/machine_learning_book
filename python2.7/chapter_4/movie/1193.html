<PRE>                                THE PRINCE OF TIDES
                                    [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Andrew Chia-Tso Ku
                        Copyright 1991 Andrew Chia-Tso Ku</PRE>
<P>     Earlier this week, there was a screening of THE PRINCE OF TIDES on
campus.  I may be accused of being a dutiful cog in Columbia's marketing
plans, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  This is a well crafted,
big-star "mature" romance of the sort that has become increasingly rare
in the youth-dominated movie market.  It features a remarkably
full-bodied performance by Nick Nolte, who is in every scene (except for
flash-backs).  Nolte is one of those actors who do consistently
excellent and subtle work movie after movie (I'd include Gene Hackman
and Jeff Bridges in this category) and consequently have been taken for
granted.  This movie will probably go a long way towards bringing him
the attention he deserves.  He delivers the sort of juicy performance
that will probably be remembered when award time rolls around.</P>
<P>     Before going any further, I should mention that I have *not* yet
read Pat Conroy's novel, but apparently from press releases, Conroy is
very happy with the movie (he co-wrote the script).</P>
<P>     This is the second movie Barbra Streisand has directed and THE
PRINCE OF TIDES clearly establishes her as one of the most thoughtful
and meticulous directors working in the confines of the populist
Hollywood style.  The story unfolds at a comfortable pace and the tired
cliches inherent in this genre (I'll get to them later) are overcome by
the emotional honesty and conviction that she and her A-list cast
(including Kate Nelligan, Blythe Danner, Melinda Dillon, Jeroen Krabbe)
and especially Nolte invest in their roles.  (I would have liked more
of Melinda Dillon -- she's basically a plot device to set the narrative
in motion -- but in the paltry few minutes she's allotted, she does
wonders.)  Streisand herself gives a muted performance in the less showy
role of Nolte's quasi-psychiatrist and lover (nevertheless, it's a cut
above  Ingrid Bergman's impersonation of a psychologist in SPELLBOUND);
appropriately, Streisand keeps her "persona" in check.</P>
<P>     It's smart of Columbia Pictures to be previewing THE PRINCE OF
TIDES this weekend: the movie, which should have the broad audience
appeal of other domestic dramas like TERMS OF ENDEARMENT or ORDINARY
PEOPLE, probably needs word of mouth to attract audiences beyond
Streisand's usual constituency.</P>
<P>Plot-related criticisms follow.  (spoilers)!</P>
<P>     In general, I thought the movie suffered a bit from
overexplicitness.  The abusive/psycho-sexual goings on between the young
Tom and his parents were very uncomfortable to watch and the penultimate
flashback (the gang rape) was almost unbearable (although I realize that
that was partly the point) and having Nolte relate *some* of those
scenes to Streisand would have been just as effective.  The presentation
of the flashbacks (and their content) felt exceedingly reminiscent of
NUTS.  The use of narration was handled fairly skillfully, but at times
it seemed redundant or gumshoe-y (and at the end was laughable:
"Lowenstein, Lowenstein....")</P>
<P>     I found the scenes of pastoral bliss near the end of the movie too
protracted; I wonder if it was a bow to audience expectations or a
chance for Streisand to photograph herself in soft focus.  And I could
have done without the subplot involving Streisand's son.  Having to win
over a rebellious adolescent has become such a cliche in movies and
television that I'm pretty sick of them.  Nolte's good humor helped me
through those scenes (Streisand's son is competent but not spectacular
in the role).  Finally, I thought Streisand's conception of her
character was too rosy.  Except for choosing a bastard of a husband,
this woman is *perfect*!</P>
<P>     All in all, THE PRINCE OF_ IDES is very satisfying and enjoyable;
I hope Streisand gets some credit for getting it made (and made so
well).  For guys whose SOs are trying to get them to go, there are far
worse ways of spending two hours :-)</P>
