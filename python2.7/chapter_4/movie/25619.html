<PRE>Welcome to Strike Football
The Replacements</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A formulaic, root for the underdogs, football, feel good film that feels
good. Late in the season the Washington Sentinels hire on "The Replacements"
to fill the swelled helmets of the pro's picketing for larger bottom lines.
Gene Hackman comes out of retirement to hand-pick and coach this team of
misfits which include: a sumo wrestler, a convict, one over enthusiastic
SWAT cop, a deaf guy, a coupla gangsta body-guards, a soccer player and
Shane Falco (Keanu), the coulda-been that never-was.</P>
<P>Hackman throws for the heart and so does the film. It's just plain good fun,
good solid dialogue peppered with plenty of grins, and a lot of football
action.</P>
<P>Especially well done, the breaking of the picket line scene where our motley
crew watches as their heroes mock and taunt them, a lunchroom scene where
the boys bicker over race, and the opening sequence with Keanu underwater
scraping barnacles from boats. He comes across an old football trophy in the
muck and tosses a submerged pass while Lit rocks on, "If I could get another
chance I'd put it in a ziploc bag and keep it in my pocket."</P>
<P>Hackman: "You know what separates the winners from the losers?"
Reeves: "Yeah, the score."</P>
<P>Langton: "You get that bruise from the game or the fight afterwards?"
Reeves: "I'm not sure, it all kind of blurs into one big beating."</P>
<P>The only drawback ... a cheer squad made up of lap-dancers. Oh, they have
their moment, but the film never really explains why the cheer squad needed
replacements also - did the regular's strike as well?</P>
<P>Anyway ... Good music, good acting, good heart. One satisfied viewer
cheered, "Finally, a good guy film!" I'd add, "That everyone can enjoy."</P>
