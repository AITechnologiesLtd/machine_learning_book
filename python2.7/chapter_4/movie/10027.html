A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Francis Ford Coppola</PRE>
<P>Written by: 
Francis Ford Coppola, adapted from the novel by John Grisham</P>
<P>Starring: 
Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, and Danny Glover</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
neophyte lawyer, legal situations, corrupt insurance company,</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who
must juggle three legal situations at the same time. Rudy's girlfriend
is attacked by her violent husband; Rudy's elderly landlady wants to
arrange her will so that her children are excluded, and; the family of
Rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that
wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant. Rudy is new to being a lawyer
and is thoroughly outgunned, but luckily he is aided by a sleazy
ambulance chaser (Danny Devito) who has failed the bar exam six times as
well as by the kindly presiding judge (Danny Glover). Jon Voight plays
Leo F. Drummond, the intimidating and arrogant leader of the
all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to
oppose justice. Will Rudy defeat Leo? Will he enjoy being a lawyer?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
The good news is that this movie has a happy ending, and it features a
guy trying to do the right thing. Director Francis Ford Coppola does
this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie. In the
typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on
solving it, and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives
turn up before the good guy wins (after lots of gripping courtroom
drama). However, Coppola's movie is deliberately more low key. 'The
Rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young Rudy as he gets
emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side
characters. In the background Rudy's voice narrates his feelings and
makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general. Two
factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be. First,
Rudy's time is split juggling three cases, rather than concentrating on
a single high-stakes case. Also, Rudy's use of voice narration in place
of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge. The end result
is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win, and Rudy
narrates his way into coming of age.</P>
