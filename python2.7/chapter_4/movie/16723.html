<P>I've never seen a more blistering hatred of a PROVEN movie star, Academy
award winning motion picture director/producer and fine actor than I
have of Kevin Costner.  Before 'Message in a Bottle' was released, some
showed their unprofessional bias by saying things like: "This film has
Kevin Costner in it, and therefore it will be bad".  Many have attacked
Costner unfairly and have been dedicated to ruining his career since he
went against the establishment with director Oliver Stone in making
1991's 'JFK'.  That was probably Costner's last truly great film and
while 'The Bodyguard' and 'Tin Cup' were successful hits for Costner,
they were forgettable movies and can't compare to his 'Bull Durham',
'Field of Dreams' and 'Dances With Wolves' days.</P>
<P>'Message in a Bottle' works for one very big reason: it's tasteful.  In
an adult romantic drama, there is little or no noticeable swearing, no
villains and a bedroom love scene that is the most tasteful I've seen in
years.  You can take anyone to see it from your girlfriend/boyfriend to
your mother or grandmother.  These factors alone don't make for a good
film but in addition to these qualities, 'Message in a Bottle' creates
characters that you care about.  I felt by the end of the picture, that
it was a bit too talky and perhaps that made for a disappointing overall
presentation, but it's one of those films that you have to watch until
the very end before you realize what an absorbing and lightly flowing
film it really is.</P>
<P>Robin Wright Penn plays a Chicago journalist named Theresa Osborne who
finds, literally, a message in a bottle on the beach one day and the
writing is a two page love letter to a woman named Catherine and through
good investigative journalism tactics, Theresa tracks the origins of the
note to a man living in North Carolina named Garret Blake (Kevin
Costner).  Catherine was Garret's wife.  Now deceased, we learn that
Garret wrote the letter and threw it into the ocean, intending for no
one to find it, let alone read it.  Theresa and Garret start a romance
that leads farther than either one of them anticipated and Theresa's
motivation for seeking out Garret and telling him the truth of why she's
with him becomes more and more difficult for her after she falls in love
with him.  Garret refinishes boats and builds them from scratch for a
living and lives with his likable but sad sack father Dodge (Paul
Newman).  Dodge knows he's capable of being the definition of what is
called an 'old fart' but he avoids this knowing that he needs his son as
much as his son needs him.  Both men are widowers and equally feel the
loss of a daughter in law and a mother as much as they do the women they
were closest to in life.</P>
<P>One of the disappointments in the film is that many notable and talented
actors are once again wasted to a certain degree.  There is Garret's
former brother in law (John Savage), who, along with the rest of his
family, blames Garret for his sister's death.  Back at the Chicago
newspaper, Theresa's colleagues in print are Robbie Coltrane and Illeana
Douglas who never really develop into anything more than caricatures.  I
suppose, in fairness, there really isn't much you can do with these
characters without taking away the impact of the main character's
destinies.</P>
<P>There is a description of Costner's character made by Newman in the
film.  In regards to losing his wife, the father says of his son to
Penn:  "It's like he's been hit by a truck and is only half alive".
Costner plays his role very well and his character reminded me a lot of
William Hurt's character from 1988's 'The Accidental Tourist' when
Hurt's character lost his son in a violent crime.</P>
<P>'Message in a Bottle' is written by Gerald DiPego based on the novel of
the same name by Nicholas Sparks and is directed by Luis Mandoki.  Luis
Mandoki takes a very simplified but powerful form of direction in hand
to make this film and while the film is somewhat predictable in it's
last half hour, it still is a good film using input from a talented cast
(I would argue led by Newman) and a story that will require plenty of
handkerchiefs that theatres should be required to pass out as you leave
the theatre.</P>
