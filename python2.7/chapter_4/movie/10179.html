<PRE>KIDS (1995)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Larry Clark
Writer: Harmony Korine
Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Pierce</PRE>
<P>I think I like the ideals behind Larry Clark's "Kids" more than the
actual movie.  Being amongst the generation that Clark is compaining
about (actually more like bitching), I can first hand say that my
generation is rude, self-absorbed, uncautionary, and that we mostly feel
invincible most of the time.  We do drugs, drink a lot, and have tons of
sex, sometimes unprotected (condoms being a global franchise instead of
a means of real protection these days).  What Larry Clark does is
totally overexaggerate the problem, hinting it as apocalyptic, offering
no solution and no hope.  It's a boring, uncomfortable, one-dimensional
film.</P>
<P>"Kids" has no real plot, which is okay, except one small one: Jennie
(Chloe Sevigny, who apparently goes to the same college as I do) finds
out she is HIV-positive, despite having had relations with only one guy:
Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), a slack-jawed schmuck of a kid who talks like
he's mentally retarded...yet is still the resident Cassanova.  So she
goes around the Big Apple, going to people's houses, attending parties,
etc, in hopes of finding him and telling him before he beds someone
else.</P>
<P>The film is filled with scenes of young teenagers having sex, fooling
around, drinking, doing lot of drugs, stealing, beating innocent men to
near-death with skateboards, swimming in underwear, talking casually
about sex (and how condoms make your penis shrink), and all that.  It's
filled completely with this stuff, and there is no one out there who's
the voice of reason, hope, or even common sense.  Even the girl who
seems intelligent, and who's parents' strictness with her might have
paid off, is easily seduced by the moronic Telly, and gives up her
virginity way too easily for someone she's structured to be.  And Jennie
is stupid enough to "accidentally" take something which prohibits her
from moving quickly enough to stop Telly from sleeping with more
chicks.  The things the kids do in this movie are as plot devices, not
really because they're that way.</P>
<P>Sure, some parts are very good.  I liked Chloe Sevigny as a whole. 
She's really the only very good part of it, acting wonderfully, and
showing a lot of stored-up emotion.  I liked some of the other
actresses, and even the script sounds kind of real now and then.  A lot
of the time, though, it sounds so fake and fabricated that any
"grittiness" it tries to present is lost.  I also liked how the scene
where Telly is screwing his last girl for the evening (there are two in
the same day), it felt scarier than the first one since you knew that he
was HIV-positive, and this innocent little virgin was contracting it as
well.</P>
<P>But that's about all that's good about this film.  It's view on the
subject is completely naive and never backed-up.  Larry Clark, who has
done photographs of kids in the city, claims to know exactly what kids
these days are like.  He thinks that they're all overly-precocious,
naive, and just plain stupid.  He needs to go back and do some more
research.  He has taken a problem with the world, tried to sell it by
overexaggerating it, and slaps on a weak story.  Larry wants this to be
a satire.</P>
<P>But what Larry forgets is that a weak story can take away from the
message.  A strong story, on the other hand, can be constructed in such
a way that it backs up the story well, as in such cases as Kubrick's
masterpieces "Dr. Strangelove" and "A Clockwork Orange," which are two
of the best examples on how to make a satire.</P>
<P>Not only is the film un-focused, naive, and weak, but it also never
really identifies or explores the problem.  Is it that the kids are
having too much sex?  That they think they're invincible?  And if so,
why is that?  Are they're parents uncaring?  Were they raised by bad
role models on television?  We do see a scene dealing with a parent
who's main problem is she's breat-feeding in front of two horny teenage
boys.  But it never really explores anything into the problem(s) dealing
with kids.  It remains totally one-sided on the topic, and all of the
characters are crap since Larry Clark has nothing but sophomoric
pretention towards them.</P>
<P>The ending is pretty good, albeit very contrived.  There is a part which
is tossed in JUST so this can happen, kind of weakening the effect.</P>
<P>"Kids" has been critically acclaimed by some, and pissed on by others
(including myself).  It's been called "a masterpiece," " a wake-up call
to the world," and even received two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert. 
But unlike most of the haters of this film, I was not offended by the
fact that teenagers were shown having sex, doing drugs, drinking, etc. 
I would never give a film a bad rating for such superficial reasons as
that.  To me, as a part of the generation Larry is blasting, I think
it's a very flawed film.  If I were to construct a "gritty satire on the
decadence of the youth in America," I'd probably do it a lot
differently.  </P>
<P>Larry Clark, however, has constructed it in an un-focused, and
completely ignorant fashion.  It's uncomfortable to watch in the worst
way, and unentertaining in the most annoying way.  The film has good
intentions, but good intentions does not a good film make.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **</PRE>
