<PRE>A cheerity case. Not!
Bring It On</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Well, surprisingly, there are a lot of things to like about this film. I say
"surprisingly" because I am not a member of the 14-year-old female,
apparent-target audience and yet, I must admit - I had a good time!</P>
<P>Here's why: great pace, good direction (all the actors look good), great
acting by Dunst (as  always), with costars also hoppin', funny script, some
nice cheer action (You know, cheer action is quite impressive in slow mo.
The aerial stuff is phenomenal, would have liked more.), abrasively
enjoyable toothbrushing sequence (like none other I've seen - have I seen
one?), Jesse Bradford's guitar reply to a surprise visit by Dunst, and his
goofy song for her, "I can't stand your cheerleading squad, but I like your
pom poms."</P>
<P>It's pretty much the high school team formula with boyfriend off at college
premise that makes a few (perhaps not breakthrough fresh), but nonetheless
respectable twists. Dunst plays the new cheerleading captain whose worst
nightmare comes true - her squad's routines aren't all original! She teams
up with new rocker from the city to keep the crew psyched and ready for the
cheer championships in Florida.</P>
<P>Here are a couple of the tongue-in-cheek lines that kept this audience
smiling and laughing:</P>
<P>Bradford encouraging his punkster sister to go for the cheer thing, "You get
to yell like you care about something."</P>
<P>Dunst, "This is not a democracy - it's a cheerocracy." Upset members
respond, "And you're not a cheerleader you're a cheertator!"</P>
<P>Also done nicely, not unlike the way cheerleaders might be thought to play
second fiddle to football teams, in this film these roles are reversed; the
jocks are almost a second thought - impotent, bullies at best.</P>
<P>Improvements? Sure, though the militant-cheerographer bit was a good idea
and made this crowd laugh, I felt a better cast actor could have really
rocked the place. Also, Eliza Dushku is introduced into the group as a
leather-wearing/gymnast, sadly, we never see her talents in the competition.
A lull at half-time stunts the awesome momentum created from the start. And
lastly, the film might have benefited from deeper relationships among the
characters (most are playful), instead the mood is kept light from beginning
to end, save for an almost heartfelt moment between Dunst and rival captain
of the Compton team, Gabrielle Union.</P>
<P>Overall, Hurrah for this little film, it's a good time. A strong B+.</P>
