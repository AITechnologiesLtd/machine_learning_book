Review Excerpt:
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
by Joe Barlow

<P>With our first glimpse of Bedford Falls, the idyllic, snow-kissed
setting of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, we know something is
amiss. It's Christmas Eve, but there's no joy in the air--only a sense
of tension and foreboding. There are voices in the night; from every
home we hear the prayers of townsfolk, requesting salvation for one of
their own--George Bailey, the beloved secretary of the town's Savings
and Loan office. His name is chanted like a mantra, hovering on the
lips of every resident.  "Please, Lord," they plead, "help George
Bailey." </P>
<P>Bailey (James Stewart) is a man whose life hasn't turned out the way
he envisioned it. He's no longer the wide-eyed boy who dreamed of
travel, exploration, and--most importantly--making a difference in the
world; now in his late twenties, he's deeply entrenched in a job he
despises. George is kind to everyone, a trait responsible for his
current predicament. He simply can't say no. To anyone. For any
reason. He loans money to friends when he can barely afford to buy
clothes for his children. He finds himself deaf in one ear after
risking his life to save his brother from drowning. He abandons his
dream of going to college when his father's business needs him.
Everyone, it seems, owes at least a portion of their well-being to
George's selflessness.</P>
