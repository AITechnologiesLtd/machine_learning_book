<PRE>                             SECRETS AND LIES
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     While there are some similarities between SECRET AND LIES and the
recent A FAMILY THING, each stands on its own and approaches their
stories from different angles.   In the latter, a sixty-something
white man (Robert Duvall) discovers that the woman he thought was his
mother and who has just died is not his real mother.  He sets out to
find the blood-family he never knew or had heard about.  He discovers
they are black, with a half-brother played by James Earl Jones.</P>
<P>     SECRETS AND LIES, on the other hand, is about Hortense (Marianne
Jean- Baptiste) a young black woman who is an optometrist in London.
She knows the parents with whom she has been living until they died
were her adoptive parent, not her "real" parents.    When she gets a
sudden urge to learn about her real mother she is given the files the
adoption agency  has on her..   When she finds her mother, who is
white, the mother, Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn) is shocked and
disbelieving until Hortense comes up wiith enough detail to convince
her that they are, indeed, mother and daughter.</P>
<P>     While Hortense and Cynthia take a liking to each other, there is
the rest of the family who have  to be wooed.   Cynthia has another
daughter, Roxanne, (Claire Rushbrook) and how will she take the news
that she has a black half-sister?</P>
<PRE>     The film is very touching, and  well acted, so that you are left
with the hope that all will turn out well in the end.   At least, that
was my wish.   Go see it.</PRE>
