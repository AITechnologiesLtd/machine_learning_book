<PRE>IN SHORT: Been there done that.</PRE>
<P>It's never a good sign when a movie reveals almost all there is to know
in its trailer or teevee spot. So, this CrankyCritic® review comes to
you guest hosted by Alex Trebek</P>
<P>Cranky: I'll take "Deja Vu" for $400, Alex.
Alex: The answer is: Busted for a murder she didn't commit, an innocent
runs from the law
Cranky: What is The Fugitive?
Alex: No, I'm sorry. "She" is the catch. The category is "deja vu"</P>
<P>Cranky: OK, then, same category for $800
Alex: The answer is: "Tommy Lee Jones hot on the trail of a Fugitive"
Cranky: Ah, you're not gonna fool me this time. What is U.S. Marshals?
Alex: Nope. Sorry. The answer to both questions is, well how about this,
Double Jeopardy!</P>
<P>Which, had the producers gone the low budget route and cast Priscilla
Presley and Mike Farrell, could have been sold as a Lifetime Exclusive
Movie under the title -- "I Killed My Husband . . . And Then He Stole My
Baby!"</P>
<P>Sentenced to jail for a gruesome murder she swears she didn't commit,
rich young thing Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) is obsessed with finding
her young son, who has disappeared with the best friend into whose care
he had been placed. When she tracks this pair down, to a new identity in
a new city, she makes the awful discovery that her husband isn't dead!
Since authorities don't want to hear it (they've heard it all before,
don'tcha know) Libby heeds the sage advice of another ex-lawyer, also
imprisoned for murder: "You've killed him once. You were convicted. They
can't try you again for the same crime so, bide your time..."</P>
<P>That's a twist on the Fifth Amendment with reasoning that I'm sure any
lawyer out there could take apart in a second. It doesn't get in the way
of the story (unlike the problems I had with last year's <a
href="<A HREF="http://www.crankycritic.com/archive98/asimpleplan.html">A">http://www.crankycritic.com/archive98/asimpleplan.html">A</A> Simple
Plan</a>), a neat package whose loose ends are neatly tied up before the
by the book heart tugging ending. Release on parole after six years,
Libby is ensconced in a halfway house, under the eye of depressed ex-law
professor turned parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) who has
also lost a child to a thieving ex-spouse. Driven by the need to find
her son, Libby will eventually break parole and Travis will follow. You
get a cross country chase, at least one near death escape, an
interesting story twist that Edgar Allen Poe probably dreamed and forgot
a hundred years ago and a cute boy with a fuzzy mop top. Nothing you
haven't seen before. With A-list stars to keep your attention, Double
Jeopardy is a perfectly average way to pass the time, but it isn't
gripping and thrilling storytelling. Blink twice and you'll see it on
the rental racks.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Double Jeopardy, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Only the star names kick this thing into rental range.</P>
