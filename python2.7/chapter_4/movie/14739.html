<P>John Frankenheimer's films are always perplexing.  They have a sharp yet
ordinary look to them and they still manage to entertain highly.
Frankenheimer's (and Frank Sinatra's) 'The Manchurian Candidate' from
1962 is perhaps the best espionage thriller ever made and
Frankenheimer's work as director on other films such as 'Birdman of
Alcatraz' (1962), 'Grand Prix' (1966), the disappointing but well
meaning 'The French Connection II' (1975) and 'Black Sunday' (1977) have
put him in an important light in the chapters of film history.
Frankenheimer doesn't always like to use a lot of music in his films
because his gripping plot lines can sing a different tune.</P>
<P>'Ronin' is a film that makes Robert De Niro look great.  His character
is an enigma and De Niro plays it exactly that way.  We assume that he
is or has been some sort of covert operator earlier in his life who is
now working in Europe with a group of others in the same business who
are all of different nationalities.  There is the Frenchman (Jean Reno)
who De Niro strikes up an off beat friendship with.  An Irish woman
(Natascha McElhone) and her companion (Jonathan Pryce), an ex-KGB
computer whiz (Stellan Skarsgard), a weapons specialist (Sean Bean) and
the group's driver (Skipp Sudduth).</P>
<P>They're all working together to obtain a mysterious steel suitcase which
contains something worth killing for and before its sold to a group of
high bidding Russians, the attempts to get it make for the film's best
action sequences.  The film's beginning and first half hour are
extremely simple and Frankenheimer turns the heat up slowly, comparable
to watching a pot of water boil on your stove.  Slow but worth the
wait.  The rhythm the film has is genuine in all its clever little
tidbits as the little things in this film truly count as much as the big
things do.</P>
<P>Exquisite European photography is the setting as Paris is the film's
central focus for the story and Frankenheimer uses his camera like a
bullet at times and stretches every action sequence's tension out to its
fullest extent.</P>
<P>De Niro's early work in the movies looked extremely low-key.  His
performances in 'The Godfather Part II' (1974) and 'Taxi Driver' (1976)
had De Niro doing a lot of method acting without a lot of emotion in his
roles, sort of like Gary Cooper.  Both of those actors and their subtle
ways actually had great strength.  Certainly, those roles were much
different than De Niro's roles in 'The King of Comedy' (1983) and 'Cape
Fear' (1991) where De Niro never did let up with those "in your face"
type of performances. 'Ronin' is vintage De Niro.  A film where De Niro
can give a good, low-key performance while giving the rest of the cast
their fair share of the spotlight and a film where director John
Frankenheimer can still exhibit his style as one of film's best
espionage directors.  A style that along with De Niro's, works for all
generations.</P>
