<PRE>THE DEEP END (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
September 21st, 2001</PRE>
<P>I was stunned after seeing "The Deep End." Here is a film noir story with the
machinations of the thriller genre but all wrapped in ivory silk, as if any and
all cliches that could occur are withheld in the service of melancholia. This is
noir that is not really bleak and a thriller that looks for behavioral
characteristics to thrill us, all told with an absorbing sense of serenity that
distinguishes it from most other thrillers. </P>
<P>The film begins with a jeep arriving at some undisclosed nightclub in Reno. A
tall, lanky, red-headed woman warns a sleazy guy to stay away from her son. We
are unaware of what the situation is but we know he represents sleaze and we
know she is a worrisome mother. It turns out the mother's son, Beau (Jonathan
Tucker), is having a homosexual affair with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), the sleazy
guy at the nightclub who owes a huge gambling debt. Beau's mother, Margaret
(Tilda Swinton), wants him to stay away from Darby since all he represents is
trouble. When Darby makes an unscheduled visit at their house in Lake Tahoe,
Beau pleads with him to keep away. Darby will keep if Margaret pays him $5,000.
A fight ensues resulting in the accidental death of Darby. The next day,
Margaret finds the body and thus, the film's moral center takes over in an
unusual, lyrical manner. </P>
<P>I will not say much more except that this serenely modest thriller is different
from most Hitchcock thrillers in that usually the protagonist and the audience
is aware of information that no one else is aware of. In this case, we know the
truth behind the accidental death of Darby that no one else in the movie knows.
Not even the seedy man from Reno ("E.R.'s" Goran Visnjic) who demands money to
keep his mouth shut from what might be a potential murder. And Margaret does her
best to keep calm and hide Darby's body. She wants to protect her son, her
father-in-law, and her other son and daughter from the evils of the world,
notably Reno. </P>
<P>Tilda Swinton is clearly the star of "The Deep End," imbuing the screen with a
vitality and strength that is breathtaking to witness. I have only seen her in
one other film, the magnificent "Orlando," but her performance here makes me
want to pursue her earlier work. Perhaps even more so than Cate Blanchett,
Swinton has a sense of authority as the doting, respectful mother that dominates
the screen. It is no accident that the number of closeups in the film enhance
her strong, magnetic presence. Interestingly, Swinton's Margaret seems to barely
take notice of her children except for Beau - it is a family life where the
father-in-law is more concerned about her than anyone else (including her unseen
husband who is a Navy officer). </P>
<P>"The Deep End" is directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel III, who previously
collaborated on "Suture." They have an uncanny eye for detail and savor
appropriately breathless cinematic moments that never disrupt the pace or
momentum. I found the shot of Swinton underwater while looking for car keys from
Darby's body positively thrilling and unnerving to watch. Also look closely at
framed shots of Swinton, usually seen from windows or from other obstructions
(one extreme example is a fish-eyed lens shot reflected in a drop of water).
Water and glass are prominently featured whenever Swinton's Margaret appears on
screen and it nicely balances with the Lake Tahoe setting - prominent yet
unassuming. </P>
<P>"The Deep End" is occasionally melodramatic towards the end and climaxes sooner
than it should have. Still,  a magnificent central performance by Swinton, not
to mention an understated cast and a hauntingly lyrical tone that switches from
engaging thriller to a heart-rending love story, more than makes up for it.</P>
