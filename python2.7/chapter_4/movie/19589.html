<P>        Back in the 1790s, Ann Radcliffe, the most popular author of Gothic
fiction during its heyday, proposed a distinction between horror and
terror.  "Terror and horror," she wrote, "are so far opposite, that the
first expands the soul, and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life;
the other contracts, freezes, and nearly annihilates them."  In other
words, horror offends the senses, and terror exalts them; horror is cheap
thrills, terror is sublime.</P>
<P>        On the basis of RING, a Japanese movie which could be a working
model for Radcliffe's definition of terror, I'm inclined to agree.  For
ninety-plus minutes, it builds suspense and (of course) terror through
insinuation and understatement and measured pacing.  It is not graphic or
violent, but it nonetheless manages to be intensely scarifying.</P>
<P>        The premise: a mysterious video has been linked to a number of
deaths in Tokyo.  Rumour has it that those who see the video receive a
phone call moments later informing them that they have exactly a week to
live.  Asakawa, a journalist and single mother, investigates, finds the
video, and (because we need a plot) watches it.  She receives a phone call.
And the screw begins to turn ...</P>
<P>        Despite the modern trappings, RING is very much inspired by classic
ghost stories, and uses the same simple storytelling methods.  It gains our
interest by presenting us with sympathetic, everyday characters,
principally Asakawa (Matsushima Nanako) and her ex-husband (Hiroyuki
Sanada), whom she enlists to help her after receiving the fateful phone
call.  It involves a ghost who haunts our mortal realm because she has been
sinned against and cannot rest in peace.  It develops thematic links
between the past and present by having both strands include neglected
children.  It uses needless details--like a ride on a fishing boat across a
tempest-tossed sea--to intensify the mood of foreboding.  If Wilkie Collins
or M.R. James (or their Japanese counterparts) were alive now, they might
write such a tale.</P>
<P>        While the narrative is, for the most part, quiet and unhurried,
composed in the serene static Japanese style familiar from Ozu and
Mizoguchi onward, it is occasionally punctuated by brief disruptive
moments: flashes of images from the video or from the past, accompanied by
a harsh ominous score.  As is the case in the films of Takeshi Kitano,
whose contemplative storylines are interrupted by short bursts of extreme
violence, the contrast is potent and compelling.  There are other nice
touches, too, like the captions telling us which day it is, counting down
the time Asakawa has left--and matter-of-factly cranking up the tension.</P>
<P>        The video itself, shown early in the movie, proves to be perhaps
the freakiest paranormal moment seen on screen since the climax of THE
KINGDOM I.  It is a brief montage of enigmatic, blurry video footage, with
weird sounds in the background.  It reveals nothing at all, but conveys a
powerful sense of wrongness.  Although director Hideo Nakata's methods are
elsewhere straightforward--albeit effective--the composition of the video
is inspired.  Sections of it are shown repeatedly, but it becomes no less
eerie or estranging.</P>
<P>        The entire film could be construed as the set-up for one "money"
scene, in which a much-anticipated confrontation finally takes place,
although not in the expected manner.  Because the film is so well crafted,
this "money" scene delivers exactly what it is supposed to: chilling
terror.  Yes, that's a cliché, but it was literally true in my case--I had
shivers going up and down my spine like a parade was passing over my grave.
And in a tense moment earlier in the film, an unexpected development
elicited plenty of curt breathless screams from the audience.  RING was a
smash hit throughout South-East Asia, and based on the reaction at its
North American premiere, it's not hard to see why: it plays its audience
masterfully, regardless of their language.  In the grand scheme of things,
it may not be a great or important movie, but it is a near-perfect example
of its kind.  It understands the simplest rule of terror: the longer you
make them wait, the bigger and better the pay-off will be.</P>
