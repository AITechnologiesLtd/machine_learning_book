<PRE>                          THE DEEP END 
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper 
    CAPSULE: Tilda Swinton stars as a mother who tries to hide the 
    death of her son's male lover and in the process gets herself 
    involved in a web of blackmail and deceit.  Swinton gives a 
    very good performance, but her character is more like a cork 
    in water buffeted by the force of those around her than a 
    person who takes action.  The film is tense but not entirely 
    satisfying.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4) </PRE>
<P>For any thriller to work fully there are two real requirements. 
The viewer has to have some emotional investment in the 
characters, particularly the main character, and the characters 
have to make choices that will affect the outcome of the story. 
If we do not care what happens to the main character we might as 
well be watching pieces on a chessboard.  If the people in the 
story do not make judgments and choices then they might as well be 
on a thrill ride at an amusement park following its inevitable 
track.  They just ride through the various dangers they face.  In 
THE DEEP END we are given reason to empathize with Margaret Hall 
(played by Tilda Swinton), but after the first half-hour or so she 
is mostly doing just what she has to do.  While other characters 
are complex and at times do the unexpected, once we know Margaret 
well enough to care for her, we also know the choices that she 
will make.  And by never doing anything unexpected she loses much 
of her interest value.  The film is almost a morality tale. 
Having made a bad choice at the beginning, this long chain of 
events is what she has earned for herself. </P>
<P>Margaret Hall lives with her family in an idyllic existence in a 
nice house on Lake Tahoe.  Her son Beau (Jonathan Tucker) is a 
promising music student making applications to various colleges. 
Margaret's one wish is to protect Beau from the clutches of a male 
lover whom she is sure just wants to use her son.  After a 
clandestine assignation between the two Margaret finds the lover 
dead.  Without telling anyone she decides to hide the body so her 
son will not be implicated in the investigation.  This leaves her 
prey to blackmail and a horrific chain of events. </P>
<P>Swinton is known mostly for roles of women who have foregone 
anything like a "normal" lifestyle.  Somehow her unusual, almost 
albino, looks lead to unusual roles.  In ORLANDO she plays her 
best known role, an immortal who at one point for no obvious 
reason spontaneously changes gender from male to female. 
Frequently she plays women of power.  It is a little odd seeing 
her play a housewife who at least starts out somewhat typical.  Of 
course not long into the movie she is juggling her life as a 
housewife with her secret life dealing with blackmailers.  The man 
who has contacted her for hush money also shows sides to his 
personality we would not expect. </P>
<P>This is the second screen adaptation of the 1947 novel THE BLANK 
WALL by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding.  The first was the 1949 film THE 
RECKLESS MOMENT with James Mason and Joan Bennett directed by Max 
Ophuls.  Ophuls chose to use actors who would be familiar to 
audiences, hence making it a glossier production.  The team of 
Scott McGehee and David Siegal who have been writing and directing 
thrillers since 1993's SUTURE.  Here again they wrote and 
directed.  They chose to use generally less familiar actors than 
the previous version.  Only Swinton and character actor Peter 
Donat were even vaguely familiar to me. </P>
<P>THE DEEP END is a well-acted story of a woman who makes one 
mistake and then faces some fairly harrowing consequences.  I rate 
it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
