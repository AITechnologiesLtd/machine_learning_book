<PRE>                                EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY gives new meaning to the phrase, "leave your
brain at the door."  Although it's silly and fun, EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY is
also mindless, unoriginal, and altogether forgettable.</P>
<P>        The movie arose from the twisted mind of July Brown, the singer and
video star who's responsible for such classic tunes as "The Homecoming
Queen Has a Gun" and "I Like My Men Big and Stupid."  Brown co-wrote EARTH
GIRLS ARE EASY, which takes its name from one of her songs.</P>
<P>        Geena Davis stars as a manicurist from the Valley who catches her
fiance in bed with another woman.  The next day as she's sulking and
sunbathing, a space ship inhabited by three furry and sex-starved aliens
crash lands in her swimming pool.  The aliens, who look kind of like teddy
bears, quickly learn English by watching television--isn't that original?
Davis initially panics in reaction to her unusual house-guests, but then
she comes to her senses and takes them to the "Curl Up & Dye" beauty salon
for electrolysis.  With their fur removed, we can finally recognize the
three aliens as Jeff Goldblum and comedians Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans.
The movie depicts their fish-out-of-water misadventures, which include an
interplanetary love story between Goldblum and Davis.</P>
<P>        EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY is consistently entertaining and engaging.
Director Julian Temple, who's best known for rock videos and the film
ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, has created a colorful and fast-moving film.  Geena
Davis' talents are well suited to her weird and eccentric, yet sympathetic,
character.  July Brown is extremely appealing in her supporting role as
Davis' air-headed, fun-loving, and boy-crazy boss; she's especially
hilarious in a musical scene at the beach in which she extolls the virtues
of being a dizzy blonde.  And Carrey, Wayans, and Goldblum make the most of
their one-dimensional roles.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY is too much like a TV sitcom.
The movie's slapstick comedy is reminiscent of shows like "Laverne &
Shirley."  Like most TV sitcoms, EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY is formulaic and
doesn't contain an ounce of originality.  But even so, the movie does
provide a few moments of inspired comedy, such as its satirical barbs at
valley girls.  Most of the time, however, EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY seems like
nothing more than one long July Brown video.  The movie is full of musical
dance numbers which don't advance the story.</P>
<P>        So while EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY is perfect if you're looking for some
harmless and disposable entertainment, it won't give you much food for
thought.  By the end of the closing credits, EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY will have
already slipped from memory.</P>
