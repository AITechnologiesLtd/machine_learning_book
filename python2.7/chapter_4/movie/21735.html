<P>   The Bond series has as much stamina on the screen as its
eponymous hero has in bedrooms from Baku to Borneo. 
Face it: we're addicted to Ian Fleming's character and have
allowed him to get us to come 19 times to his pictures over
the past 37 years.  In the final note of "The World Is Not
Enough," we get the message "James Bond Will Return."
Trust him.  The series faces just one danger, and that hazard
is the opposite of the one that many viewers will point out,
i.e. that we're getting tired of the same ol' same ol'.  To the
contrary. Like our beloved dogs and cats who favor routine in
their lives, we enjoy returning to 007 just as we take to meat
loaf and mashed potatoes.  Bond is comfort food.  We know
what to expect and we savor the experience.  No: the real
danger is that the series, notwithstanding the formula, has of
late been veering from its usual trajectory, imitating the other
action-adventure movies which have co-opted the British
agent.  In the past, we've been delighted by what makes
Bond special--his appeal to all women, villainous and
virtuous alike, confirming that fair maid is ne'er won by
political correctness; the fancy gadgets such as the boats that
turn into planes, the autos sporting a dazzling array of
options, the wrist watch that shoots up wires for its wearer to
climb out of danger--given him by the old, reliable Q, still
played by the dependable Desmond Llewelyn.  Given the
advent of such agitated pix as "Con Air," "Executive
Decision," "Lethal Weapon" and the Jerry Bruckheimer
assortment including "Top Gun" and "The Rock," we need
007 to be different while he remains the same.  We attend
Cubby Broccoli's productions because we want to hear, over
and over, "Shaken, not stirred," and "My name is Bond;
James Bond."  These rituals are still in evidence with the
current release, but with all the noise that happily envelops
us, the explosions that down nasty choppers and crack
sinister oil pipelines, and the exotic locations in Northern
Spain, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, we're on familiar turf.  "The
World is Not Enough" is not different enough from the
universe of action-adventure movies that bring in the fans not
only in America but throughout the free world.</P>
<P>   In his dealings with the women, Christmas Jones (Denise
Richards) and Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), James Bond
(Pierce Brosnan) eschews some of the political correctness
he was saddled with in "Tomorrow Never Dies."  Instead, he
takes on a new physical vulnerability, a dislocated collar bone
that he acquires in a 30-foot fall--happily not one that
influences his chief preoccupation, in which he indulges with
the physician giving him a clean bill of health, Dr. Molly
Warmflash (Serena Scott Thomas).  Indeed the very opening
scene, the longest such introduction in the Bond series, is the
best largely because writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and
Bruce Feirstein give 007 some clever double-entendres and
puns, particularly political ones that the young 'uns may not
catch.  Especially biting is Bond's flippant parlance with a
Swiss banker that recalls the recent brouhaha over that
country's noncompliance with debts owed to Holocaust
survivors and their families.  "If you can't trust a Swiss
banker, who can you trust?" he counsels.  (The opening
sequence, in Bilbao, Spain, makes use of the new
Guggenheim Museum there, and Bond has gone to the area
to pick up some money recovered from a murdered agent.)  </P>
<P>   From a tense boat race on the Thames that could rival any
car-chase scene in John Frankenheimer's "Ronin," Bond
travels imperceptibly (without luggage and with an apparently
hidden array of $2,000 suits) to the Caspian Sea, taking in
the tawdry scenery of the Azerbaijan oil fields and the beauty
of the St. Sophia Mosque spotted through the mist from the
waters of Istanbul.  His principal enemy is an anarchist known
as Renard (Robert Carlyle), who is soon to die from a bullet
lodged in his brain that is traveling through the medula
oblongata.  (The doctor who failed in his attempt to remove it
was executed.)  Since Renard feels no pain, he
becomes one of Bond's strongest opponents, and therein lies
one of the cleverest concepts of this latest entry.  Renard
is determined for reasons made almost clear in the story line
to blow up the city of Istanbul with a nuclear device, while the
lovely Elektra--who may or may not be his accomplice--keeps
the good guys guessing and provides a formidable match for
the British agent.</P>
<P>   Except for the dialogue in the opening scene, most of the
colloquy is mere filler between episodes of frantic activity--on
speedboats, in submarines, in a balloon, and on the ski trail. 
Michael Apted does not treat any of this agitated movement
in a particularly elegant style, leaving us to enjoy principally
the game of guessing Elektra's true motivations, the loyalty of
caviar-loving businessman Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie
Coltraine), the unusual plight of M (Judi Dench) who becomes
quite directly involved in the scheme, and the comic support
of John Cleese in a cameo role. Denise Richards is
overwhelmingly outmatched by Sophie Marceau, the former's
bearing as stiff as an oil pipeline, while Ms. Marceau, though
notably sexier in William Nicholson's sudsy "Firelight," steals
the scenes she's in.</P>
<P>    The title of the movie comes from James Bond's family
motto , orbis non sufficit, which surfaced in his 1969 film "On
Her Majesty's Secret Service."  In this case, the slogan
becomes apropos as Bond is advised that he could have
received the world if only he sold out and joined the
conspirators.  As for Pierce Brosnan himself, one of the
world's handsomest men has settled in nicely to the role and
this time shows that he can really act.  Given the reality that
we can't expect a great deal of originality in the action
sequences, what we need is a lot more sparkling dialogue:
More double entendres, and especially, more contemporary
send-ups of the absurdities of the current world's politics, as
shown so adeptly in this film's opening sequence.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 128 minutes.  (C) 1999
