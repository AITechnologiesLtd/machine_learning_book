<PRE>                                    ALICE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     Every year, just as winter peaks and begins to peter out into a
sloppy mess, Woody Allen redeems this most cheerless of seasons with a
new movie.  This year he gives us ALICE, which stars Mia Farrow and in
which Allen himself does not appear.  But, of course, Allen need hardly
appear physically in a Woody Allen film for his presence to dominate and
inform every scene.  His major presence in ALICE is that Mia Farrow has
begun to speak her lines exactly as Allen does, even to the point where
it becomes somewhat distracting.</P>
<P>     The title character, played brilliantly by Farrow, is a modern,
upper-crust, neurosis-ridden Manhattanite interpretation of the Lewis
Carrol Alice.  Farrow's Alice takes Chinese herbs with a lot more
various effects that the old "one side makes you taller" routine of the
Caterpillar.  The herbalist/acupuncturist is played by Keye Luke, who
long ago and in a different world was, I believe, No.  1 Son in the the
Charlie Chan series.  Everywhere Alice goes there are looking glasses in
background.  This Alice is an innocent on the cusp of discovering
herself.</P>
<P>     Her husband is a cold, patronizing, and treacherous William Hurt.
Her lover is Joe Mantegna.  Mantegna's performance is particularly good,
being the only actor in the movie who has chance of stealing the lead
from Farrow.  Julie Kavner, Bernadette Peters, and Cybil Shepherd have
minor roles; the wealth of Allen is staggering if he can afford to
underuse such major character actors as Kavner (who is also appearing
AWAKENINGS currently) and Peters (who has never had a good movie, but
for whom hope springs eternal).  </P>
<P>     Gwen Verdon, who was the fabulous dancer/singer who starred as 
Lola in DAMN YANKEES long time passing (remember "Whatever  Lola Wants,
Lola Gets (and, Little Man, Lola Wants You)"?),  appears as Alice's
mother, who had a short career in the movies  before she drank herself
to death with Margaritas ("But,  darling, you know I never could resist
anything with salt on  the rim.").</P>
<P>     Allen, by the way, does us all a major service when he finds and
uses some otherwise nearly forgotten of star of other years.  In NEW
YORK STORIES, the woman who played his mother was the original voice of
Betty Boop, for example.</P>
<P>     (I read this last week a description of Hurt grabbing Mantegna and
dancing around in a circle yelling "We're going to do a Woody, we're
going to do a Woody!")</P>
<P>     Too much praise for Farrow's accomplishment is not possible.  She
brings a guileless honesty to her role, a deadpan serious to the hijinks
and fantasy that makes them all the more delightful.  In many ways,
ALICE marks Farrow's emergence as a major film actor.</P>
<P>     Another reliable feature of Allen films is the music.  Allen is
well-known to be a major, major jazz aficionado, who, like Mantegna's
character, Joe, plays the sax and who has a record collection that is
reliably described as fantastic.  The sound track of ALICE features some
well chosen selections from such a collection, including "Alice Blue
Gown" and that one about Old Chinatown.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, I do not think the movie per se is as good as its
performers.  The fantasy elements are handled well, but my own class
prejudices are such that I have trouble being too sympathetic toward
upper-class angst.  My prejudices aside, the ending of the film is
horribly, disfiguringly hurried and left me with a very unsatisfied
feeling.</P>
<P>     Briefly, I have to say that ALICE is major Farrow, but minor Allen.
But then, as others have remarked, a second-rate Allen movie is better
than just about anyone else's first-rate movie.</P>
