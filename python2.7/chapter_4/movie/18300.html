<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 and a half stars</P>
<P>If you fart-ass around all your life, it seems, you will be led to
greater things.  At least, that's what happens in A Night at the
Roxbury, a comedy of errors that was a big one to begin with.  There was
barely enough material here to maintain a five minute skit, let alone a
ninety minute feature that bumbles, stumbles and fumbles through its
running time. If you're akin to this type of silly, silly humor, the
film might be goofy enough to warrant a sitting - but otherwise, I'd
advise everybody to stay well clear of this tiresome piece of humdrum
filmmaking.  In defense of the film, I can honestly say that I did enjoy
it, before the ridiculously unintelligent characters became irritating,
and before the script became boring and problematic.  Trouble is, that
happened about fifteen minutes in.</P>
<P>The Butabi brothers - Steve (Will Ferrel) and Doug (Chris Kattan) - are
the coolest disco regulars around.  At least, they think they are.
Steve and Doug spend most of their nights waiting outside of nightclubs,
fantasizing that one day they might run their own club.  One night they
are particularly frustrated for not being allowed inside the prestigious
'The Roxbury,' - the number one spot in Los Angeles - and it becomes
their ultimate mission to get inside the building and party-hardy.
After a lucky mishap, Steve and Doug find themselves dancing in the
bright lights of The Roxbury, with two women (Elisa Donovan and Gigi
Rice) who mistake them for high rollers.  The story plods along, and
Steve gets caught in a marriage he doesn't really want to commit to, and
Doug becomes even greater a social outcast.</P>
<P>The acting by Saturday Night Live regulars Will Ferrel and Chris Kattan
is predictably awful; the only time they appeal is amongst the bright
and blurring lights of discos.  Granted, there is not much they could
have done with their irritatingly simplistic dialogue.  Most prominent
in the film's many flaws is its script, which succeeds in creating two
daft characters who appear as foreigners even in their own environments.
What it doesn't do is make their wacky adventures very interesting.
Unlike the colorful escapist film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the
world in A Night at the Roxbury doesn't offer Steve and Doug enough
obstacles to encounter.   That makes the film's jokes rely almost
entirely on dialogue, which is rarely funny.  To give you an example of
the type of humor A Night at Roxbury generates, I'll close with a short
conversation between the two main characters:</P>
<P>Doug: You can take our car, and you can take our keys, but you cannot
take away our dreams!
Steve: Yeah, because we're sleeping when we have them!</P>
