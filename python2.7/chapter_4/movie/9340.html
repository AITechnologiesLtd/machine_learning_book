<PRE>MOST WANTED (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Keenen Ivory Wayans is a man of many talents.  He is known mostly for his
comedic talents though, remember In Living Color?  With Most Wanted Wayans
tries his hands at writing an action film and at becoming an action hero.
After seeing Most Wanted I would suggest that Wayans stick with what he
does best, and that is comedy.</P>
<P>Most Wanted follows Sgt. James Dunn (Wayans).  Dunn, a Marine, was
imprisoned because he killed his superior.  A covert operations group led
by General Adam Woodward (Jon Voight) takes Dunn from prison and he is
enlisted as part of an operation to kill a prominent businessman.  The
First Lady is killed instead and it seems that Dunn is the patsy for this
operation.  The only evidence that can save Dunn is a video taken by a Dr.
Victoria Constantini (Jillian Hennessy).  Dunn finds Constantini, through a
rather ludicrous way, and together they run from the conspiracy that worked
to kill the First Lady.</P>
<P>As the film goes on and Dunn continues to escape the grips of both
authorities and the conspiracy the more ludicrous the movie becomes.  The
problem with Most Wanted is that it tries to build a large conspiracy
behind what happened to the First Lady.  If built right it could have been
a very interesting addition to the film.  As it stands the story behind the
conspiracy is better left untold.  Along with the ludicrous story line come
really bad lines.  The script is definitely not the strong point of the
film, but in Most Wanted just about everything is not the strong point of
the film.</P>
<P>My suggestion for the filmmakers would have been less exposition and more
action.  When a script as unbelievable as this needs lots of action to keep
the audience from stopping to think about how unbelievable the script is.
The filmmakers of Most Wanted didn't do this and the lulls between action
sequences leave a lot of time for the audience to regain their disbelief.</P>
<P>Most Wanted is a ludicrously bad film all around.  The action sequences are
mediocre but not worth the movie ticket price, even during matinee.  Most
Wanted is definitely a movie to skip.</P>
