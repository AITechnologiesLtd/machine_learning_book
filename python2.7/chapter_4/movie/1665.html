<PRE>                                  AMANTES
                         (American title: LOVERS)
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>105 min., R, Drama, 1991, In Spanish with English subtitles
Director: Vincente Aranda
Cast: Victoria Abril, Jorge Sanz, Maribel Verdu, Enrique Cerro,   
      Mabel Escano, Alicia Agut</P>
<P>     Ex-soldier Jorge Sanz moves into the town where his girlfriend
Maribel Verdu lives.  As soon as he gets a job and money, they will get
married.  Sanz rents a room from Victoria Abril.  She seduces him, and
Sanz finds that he is falling out of love with Verdu, and into love with
Abril.</P>
<P>     AMANTES is a rather sad film and is based on a true story.   I
don't recommend this film for everybody, although if it comes to a
theater near you for a cheap enough rate, you might be interested in
going to see it.  If the film sounds interesting to you from the review
I have written, I suggest that you do attempt to see this film at a
theater as I don't know if it will ever be released on video cassette.
On a scale of zero to five, I give AMANTES a four.  AMANTES is rated R
for strong sexual content, explicit language, adult situations, brief
female nudity, and brief male nudity.</P>
<P>     The actors/actresses in this film do a very good job.   Victoria
Abril is excellent as Jorge Sanz's landlady.  She is seductive, yet you
can see the evil behind what she does.  Jorge Sanz is great as the poor
man who is deeply in love with Maribel Verdu.  As he gets to know
Victoria Abril he starts to fall in love with her; or is it just the
sexual things that she does with him?  Maribel Verdu is excellent as
Jorge Sanz's girlfriend who sees herself losing him.  She has to convert
to Victoria Abril's tactics if she wants to keep Jorge Sanz for herself.</P>
<P>     This film reminded me a lot of the Pamela Smart case that happened
in New Hampshire last year.  It is almost the exact story, except
instead of a husband, the third person is a girlfriend.  The film is
quite well written.  The end of the film is rushed and a little
confusing.  There are a few slow spots, and I vaguely remember one place
that moved along too quickly, but other than that I don't remember any
problems with the writing.  The film presented the material rather well,
not making it too depressing, especially considering the content.
However, at some points, especially towards the end, the film does get
depressing.</P>
