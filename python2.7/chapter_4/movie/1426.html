<PRE>                            A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is a film directed by Penny Marshall, from a
screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.  It stars Geena Davis,
Lori Petty, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Megan Cavanaugh.
Rated PG for mature humor.</P>
<P>     A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is a funny, warm movie about a nearly
forgotten moment in U.S.  professional sports.  It is also less than it
could have been and backs off from having the kind of impact that Geena
Davis' last movie, THELMA AND LOUISE, had.  What's here is fine, but it
is only the surface of what should be a great story, rich and
reverberant beyond the limited significance of the story per se.</P>
<P>     Penny Marshall, the director of BIG and AWAKENINGS (as well as
JUMPIN' JACK FLASH, but that's a different story), backed off the larger
meaning of the story in its latter part, when the story focuses on the
relationship of the two sister-players, played by Davis and Lori Petty.
The predictable story plays itself out with lots of emotion and
schmaltz, like any self-respecting baseball picture, in the Big Game at
the end.  But up until the story shifted into this phase, Marshall had
done a pretty good job of expanding the story to make some telling
points about the sexism of the times, about racism (in a brief and
memorable scene involving a black woman with a fierce pitching arm and a
fiercer face, knowing that two barriers were keeping her out of pro
ball), the personal price war exacts, and the bravery and strength of
individuals in the face of oppressions of all kinds.</P>
<P>     It is, however, the actors that really make LEAGUE the success that
is.  The secondary parts are filled by some primary talent.  Jon Lovitz
as the baseball scout steals every one of the few scenes he's in with
his dry, tough wit.  Megan Cavanaugh as the homely, downtrodden slugger
is hilarious and not a little heartbreaking; this is the what the world
does to such people, and you have to cheer them when they learn to fight
back.</P>
<P>     Madonna as "All-the-way" Mae Mordabito is completely charming; it's
a made-to-order part, but what makes it and her good is not her "bosoms"
(as in "What if my bosoms, you know, fall out?"  To which Rosie
O'Donnell replies "You think there ain't no man in America what ain't
seen your bosoms?")  is Mae's friendships first with Doris Murphy
(O'Donnell), then with the player she teaches to read with the help of a
dirty paperback; it's these friendships that make us take a interest in
this ex-taxi dancer.</P>
<P>     O'Donnell herself walks away with her scenes, leaving Madonna in
the dust.  O'Donnell is feisty, fierce, loyal, and full of energy as the
third base player.</P>
<P>     But, of course, the greatest scene stealer is Geena Davis who
towers over the rest of the cast figuratively and literally.  The woman
who plays the older Dottie, by the way, looks like a very tall version
of the Beav's mom, Barbara Billingsley, which is a little unnerving.
Davis plays Dottie Hinson, the best player in the All-American Girls
Baseball League, the only one who says she does not love baseball.  But
she's competitive and while she's a player she plays as the game is
meant to be played.  Davis is strong and straight; she looks right with
dirt on her face, she looks right spitting tobacco.  She's a believable
leader, and her role in redeeming Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks, is
entirely credible.  And the scene with her husband (Bill Pullman) is
nicely underplayed and breathlessly exciting.  It is pleasurable to
watch her every scene in this movie.</P>
<P>     Lori Petty plays her sister Kit.  Kit's the interesting one in
terms of having problems to work through.  Kit is jealous and feeling
under the shadow of her big sister.  She may come off as a little
petulant, perhaps not entirely sympathetic.  And whether she honestly
earns her place in the sun at the end in an open question that movie
posits without following up on.</P>
<P>     Tom Hanks plays a washed up, self-pitying, alcoholic ex-great who
is reduced to "managing" the Rockford Peaches.  He's a mess and it's
great fun to see Tom who has gotten entirely too much mileage out of
being cute being very uncute here and still be engaging and very funny.
He has a couple of scenes, including one consisting of him holding in
his anger, which are well worth the price of your ticket.  Hanks as
Dugan is a charmer, but it is also a character that is built up and then
dropped, much as Cavanaugh and Petty are, all in the interest of going
for the laughs and the tears.</P>
<P>     There is some sentiment in LEAGUE, scenes that made the tears
stream down my face.  The ending recreates the inauguration of the
Women's Baseball exhibit at Cooperstown, an event that saw the
beginnings of the film itself -- Marshall attended the ceremony and
interviewed some of the living veterans of the AAGPGL before she decided
to go with LEAGUE -- an event, I say, that may charm and move you or
make you squirm depending on your tolerance for sentiment.  But the
older versions of the players are a fine and interesting group of women,
and I found their presence refreshing and uplifting.</P>
<P>     I recommend A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN to you, recommend it
enthusiastically and wholeheartedly.  You can even play full price and
get your money's worth.  It is, I think, the best general-release,
Hollywood movie I've seen this summer.</P>
