Director: Alan Cohn
Screenplay: Michael Traeger; Mike White<HR>If you're a college student who prefers a nice beer-and-bong bash over 
last-minute cramming for your calculus test, "Dead Man on Campus" might 
be just the film to clear the haze from your head. Amongst the canny 
pleasures of this entertaining summer surprise, a message is lightly 
pounded out that could cause a few lost students to mend their ways -- 
provided, of course, that they see the movie's moral through the 
sometimes-dark, sometimes-lowbrow and often very funny comedy 
surrounding it. Sure, "Dead Man on Campus" has its share of assorted 
flaws, but give Michael Traeger and Mike White's fairly clever 
screenplay and the unbelievably lively cast credit for allowing you to 
happily overlook them. Believe it or not, this youth-oriented, 
MTV-produced flick actually delivers the goods.</P>
<P>The movie spins its story around a widely-known urban legend of sorts -- 
should your roommate kill himself during the semester, you'll get 
automatic straight-As for the grief and trauma. This "dead man's clause" 
(as it's called here) is spelled out in the charter -- yeah, right -- of 
the prestigious Daleman University, and it becomes the only way for 
mismatched freshmen dormies Josh (Tom Everett Scott), a diligent 
straight-arrow on scholarship, and Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), a 
blue-blooded, careless party boy, to stay in school once the former is 
lead astray by the latter. They begin a campus-wide search for the most 
suicidal person at Daleman, planning to move him in and push him over 
the edge as soon as possible. You know, so his death won't entirely be 
in vain.</P>
<P>"Dead Man" takes about half of its 92-minute running time before Josh 
and Cooper narrow their focus to a trio of fragile students and start 
the auditioning process. In a lesser film, waiting around for this to 
happen might have been painful postponement, but Scott and Gosselaar 
turn their typical odd couple pairing into something special for the 
stretch. Scott, whose ultra-charismatic work in "That Thing You Do!" is 
still one of this decade's most engaging debuts, is a joy to watch, 
gleaming with appeal in every scene. On the other hand, "Dead Man on 
Campus" could very well be Gosselaar's breakthrough. Here, he proves his 
acting chops go beyond his "Saved by the Bell" upbringing, and has a lot 
of fun with the debonair, jaunty Cooper. Love how he uses a martini 
shaker as a subtle comedic prop.</P>
<P>That's not to say the set-up couldn't have been prodded along at a 
faster clip, but, thanks to the antics of this harried pair, it is quite 
amusing. The following passages are even better, largely because of the 
potentially self-destructive candidates whom Josh and Cooper get to know 
and hate. Each one is a basket case in their own right, but newcomer 
Lochlyn Munro's perpetually-horny frat boy Cliff is easily the best -- 
and the scariest -- of the bunch. Munro's work here is one of those 
rare, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink performances that never grates, 
gets tired or works against him; his couch-humping scene and reaction 
when a lady friend catches her hair on fire are coarse delights, 
probably worth the price of admission alone.</P>
<P>The often pitch-black humor unfortunately gives way to a too-pat finale 
that cries out for a fiendish rewrite; it's nice, but niceness is one 
area this movie should have steered clear of. A romantic subplot between 
Josh and a pretty coed (Poppy Montgomery) provides the film with one of 
its most memorable moments -- repeated dialogue when Scott returns from 
an all-night bedroom romp -- but never really goes anywhere despite the 
two actors' sweet chemistry. Yet even miscellaneous imperfection is 
forgivable when the movie in question provides a good time, and such is 
the silly case here. "Dead Man on Campus" is by no means a classic or 
even remotely classy, but as crude little college flicks go, it pulls a 
solid grade-point-average without committing many crimes.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"My guess is that African-Americans will be offended by the movie, and 
whites will be embarrassed. The movie will bring us all together, I 
imagine, in paralyzing boredom." -- Roger Ebert on "B.A.P.S."</P>
