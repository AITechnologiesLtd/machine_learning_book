<PRE>                                 BOB ROBERTS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BOB ROBERTS is a film directed and written by Tim Robbins and
produced by Fred Murray.  It stars Tim Robbins, Gore Vidal, Giancarlo
Esposito, Ray Wise, Alan Rickman.  It is rated R for mature themes.</P>
<P>     BOB ROBERTS is Tim Robbins's nearly perfect debut as a
writer-director-star.  The debut takes the form of a devastating,
mock-documentary satire of new-right politics, a satire inspired by the
rise of David Duke.  Robbins has acknowledged THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984)
as his primary inspiration.  Like SPINAL TAP, BOB ROBERTS begins with
the music industry, but the new film quickly leaves most of that behind
as it takes up and develops a chronicle of a too-true-to-be-funny
Pennsylvania senatorial campaign.  Roberts is a Young Conservatives'
version of Bob Dylan, a folksinger who trades foreign currencies between
gigs and whose songs praise getting rich and denounce the poor and
disadvantaged as the enemy.  His opponent is a patrician veteran, played
wisely and humorously by Gore Vidal (he improvised some of his own
dialog), an old-fashioned liberal who is cynical about the political
process even while remaining passionate about his vision of government
and the American spirit.  The campaign takes place in the months before
the outbreak of the Gulf War.</P>
<P>     The comparison with Dylan is explicit in Roberts's album cover art
and music videos, but with titles like "The Times They Are A-Changin'
Back" and "This Land Is Made For Me."  A lot of people, especially young
whites from privileged classes, are shown idolizing Roberts, but some
other folks see through him.  His slipperiness and his uncanny ability
to defang his attackers is only a hint of his dark determination to win.</P>
<P>     Even darker is the presence of an eminence grise played by Alan
Rickman, a shadowy backer with even more shadowy connections to the CIA
and the savings-and-loan scandal.  Rickman is excellent in his
single-minded and frightening grimness.</P>
<P>     Giancarlo Esposito plays with growing hysteria and fatalism the
persistent investigative reporter for the counterculture press.  His
performance merges seamlessly with Jean Lepine's cinema-verite-style
camerawork to create a convincing illusion of a sensational story
unfolding before us.</P>
<P>     Other performers of note include Susan Sarandon, James Spader, and
Pamela Reed, who wittily play news-anchors down to the last blow-dried
hair.</P>
<P>     But, of course, it is Tim Robbins who carries the movie and the
day.  Fresh from the triumph of THE PLAYER.  He has created a funny
black comedy, a convincing character study, and a first-rate
political/paranoia conspiracy movie.  The aim as well as the
accomplishment goes far beyond that of SPINAL TAP.  I was intensely
impressed by the pacing of the story, as we move from Life Styles of the
Rich and Politically Ambitious narrated by a British documentary maker
through increasingly disturbing questions about the goals and methods of
the Roberts campaign until we end in a morass of the worst sort.  Yet
never does Robbins allow the documentary conventions to slip (like ZELIG
and unlike CITIZEN KANE).  The only time we see Roberts "off-camera" is
when he is tricked into thinking the all-seeing red eye was off.  It
means that the film has to exploit irony to a degree seldom seen in an
American film.  Alternate points of view come through talking heads, not
through dramatic situations, generally.  And Robbins, himself, has to
put in a less strenuous acting job and can glide largely on his natural
charm, thus taking some of the pressure off him as writer and director,
to say nothing of composing and performing Roberts's horrible songs.</P>
<P>     I simply cannot recommend BOB ROBERTS too highly to you.  It is
original, fully realized, entertaining, smart, and chilling.  Pay what
you must but see it.</P>
