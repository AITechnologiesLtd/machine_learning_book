<PRE>"Valentine"</PRE>
<P>Valentines Day is usually a holiday of romance and love. But, not this
year, it isn't. When the delivery of a threatening Valentine card is
followed by a brutal murder of a young med student, her friends soon learn
that someone from their past is stalking them all in "Valentine."</P>
<P>Been there. Seen that. This pretty much sums up the 90+ minutes you'll
spend if you decide to waste your hard earned dollars on a ticket for
"Valentine." Director Jamie Blanks ("Urban Legends") and a battery of
writers bring the adaptation of Tom Savage's novel to the screen in a
pretty production that is all good looks and absolutely no substance.</P>
<P>The story rehashes the horror genre in an unoriginal and uninvolving way
that simply marks its time and body count until the muddled and silly
ending. This is a shame since the production values deserve to be in a much
better film. Every horror movie cliché - cheap jump-out-of-the-dark scares,
the mandatory masked/faceless killer,
go-into-the-dark-room-and-see-what-made-that-noise, pretty victims - are
used frequently but to little good effect.</P>
<P>In the movie's prologue, a school dance for teens is marred by an incident
involving the school dork, Jeremy Melton (Joel Palmer), and one of his
female classmates. Jeremy is accused of molesting the girl and is sent to
reform school. Years later, one of the girls who made fun of Jeremy,
Shelley (Katherine Heigl), receives a death threat Valentine's card and is
soon the victim of a brutal murder at the hands of a butcher
knife-wielding, cherub-masked killer.</P>
<P>Soon, Shelley's friends begin to fall victim to more Valentines and
violence as, one by one, they are slain in a variety of ways, from bow and
arrow to electrocution to bludgeoning with a steam iron. The body count
steadily rises as the killer stalks and kills, one by one, each of the
friends until only one, Kate (Marley Shelton), is left to face the
murderer.</P>
<P>Movie slight of hand and the expectation of audience acceptance of any and
all illogic are the fodder that drives "Valentine." The ambiguity of the
killer - the threatening cards are invariably signed "JM" - leads us to
believe that young Jeremy is the culprit. Along the way, misleads and
maguffins prevail as the storytellers try a shell game to keep us guessing
just who the killer is. Unfortunately, they only kept me guessing for the
first 20 minutes. After that, I marked time until proved correct, in the
end. This certainly takes the thrill out of "thriller."</P>
<P>The unfortunate cast is populated with a bevy of pretty young women who
provide the victim pool with candidates for the escalating body count. TV's
"Angel," David Boreanaz, is ostensibly the film's star, what with being top
billed and everything. But, the actor wanders through his role looking as
if he's in the wrong movie. Denise Ricahards, on the heels of being a Bond
girl, seems to have made a very bad career choice as just another slasher
victim. The rest are pretty and bland. Jessica Capshaw gets the most
mileage as the formerly fat girl who bears a grudge against her prettier
friends.</P>
<P>As I said, the production is far superior to the story, with stylish
photography by Rick Bota giving things a slick look. Set design, too, by
Stephen Gaeghan, lends a terrific appearance with some inventive sets,
including a video art gallery that is visual eye candy. Too bad the rest of
the film fails to meet the production standards. Helmer Blanks should
rethink his dedication to the horror genre.</P>
<PRE>I give "Valentine" a D+.</PRE>
