<PRE>                                    PRIMAL FEAR
                       A film review by Alex Christensen
                        Copyright 1996 Alex Christensen</PRE>
<PRE>Solid thriller, one too many twists</PRE>
<P>3 of 4 stars; solid but not exceptional
The pitch: "It'll be like _The_Firm_ meets _American_Gigolo_!"</P>
<P>        What can you expect from a legal thriller? Well, if you go by the 
John Grisham-genre standard, not much courtroom action at all. I enjoyed 
_The_Firm_, _The_Pelican_Brief_ (which not many people know is a sequel to 
_All_the_President's_Men_ with Denzel Washington in the Redford role and 
Julia Roberts in the Dustin Hoffman role), and _The_Client_, but there is 
something distinctly anti-lawyer about them. Maybe it is because Grisham 
was fed up with lawyers during his career as one, maybe he is just 
matching the national mood. His heroes are always new to the legal system 
and forced through events to "take it on," of course, always triumphing 
in the end.  The plots are tight and have explosions and fights and danger.
        Not to complain too much, but _Primal_Fear_ is certainly not a 
well-plotted movie. The pacing, the acting, the mood, are all sustained, 
but the actual events of the story may leave you feeling used and a bit 
deceived yourself. The ending is such that I hesitate to call it a 
"thriller," but I think in the end the hokey final moments are not enough 
to spoil what turns out to be a quite entertaining ride.
        _Primal_Fear_ is a different kind of thriller. There is very little 
idealism except that which is actually generated during the film. That 
is, instead of a hero on a white horse in the Tom Cruise/Julia 
Roberts/Susan Sarandon role, we have Richard Gere, steeped in corruption 
from the beginning, not innocent of the ways in which justice is 
administered, who somehow finds a way to redeem himself. Most of the 
action takes place between two people in small, enclosed spaces, or in 
the courtroom. Somehow, director Gregory Hoblit manages to sustain the 
audience's interest anyhow, often stunningly.
        A lot of the criticism of Richard Gere is that he always plays 
the same character. He is basically a "hair actor" like Michael 
Douglas--once you see his hairstyle, you know all the intricacies of his 
character. I disagree with this assessment of Gere. Anyone who has seen 
Mike Figgis's _Internal_Affairs_ knows that Gere is capable of real depth. 
And yet, in _First_Knight_, _Sommersby_, _Pretty_Woman_, and others, Gere 
has only given us blandly good-looking heroes without a trace of realism. 
Which is odd, because when Gere is good, he is pretty damn good. In 
_Primal_Fear_, he is pretty damn good.
        His character is Martin Vail, a defense attorney who sees a shot 
at the really big time when an altar boy is accused of killing the 
archbishop of Chicago. He offers to defend the accused killer, Aaron 
Stampler (Edward Norton), pro bono. This involves him in an actually not 
very complicated web of intrigue and deceit which gradually unwinds itself.
        The fun of the film is all in the rhythm and the interaction of 
the characters. Unfortunately, even with a high-powered cast including 
Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, Andre Braugher, John Mahoney, and Maura 
Tierney, there are really only two characters in _Primal_Fear_: Gere's Vail 
and first-time film actor Norton's Stampler. So they have to sustain a 
lot. Fortunately, both are up to the task.
        Gere plays Vail as a character who acts completely despicably, 
always scrambling for advantage. And he enjoys being as slick as he is. 
And yet, there is an underlying optimism, if not idealism, that give the 
portrayal depth. This performance is really very well modulated and 
manages to capture something about Vail that makes you believe in him.
        And as Gere said of Edward Norton, he "is emerging as one of the 
monster actors of our time." After only one film? Yep. Without giving 
away too much of the plot, the demands of the character of Aaron Stampler 
are extraordinary. Yet, even though you can see the cliched ending coming 
a mile away, you still believe absolutely in Aaron Stampler. Without 
Norton, the movie wouldn't even sustain itself as long as it does. 
Essentially, Norton found himself, as an actor, having to play a 
character who is a great actor. The sophistication and layers of his 
performance suggest that he is already miles ahead of most first-time 
actors, and promise a great career ahead of him. It is very early for 
Oscar talk, but I think it is not overstepping to say that so far, Norton 
has given one of the strongest supporting performances of the year.
        Overall, there is something about _Primal_Fear_ that is a bit too 
easy, a bit too shadily manipulative--but leaving the theater, you are not 
that upset about it. You have seen, after all, some great actors playing 
some pretty good roles with absolutely perfect pitch. And you even kind 
of get sucked in to the story, even though you know you probably shouldn't.
        As an old guy coming out of the theater where I work said after 
seeing the film, "I don't trust you; I don't trust nobody."</P>
