<PRE>                      THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4)   Lost World: Jurassic Park is the epitome of
American mainstream action movies. Spielberg has been through this
routine so many times that it has become second nature. He is a master
at what he does. It's not that he makes it look easy, it's that he
makes it seamless. One doesn't notice the acting or the editing or the
music; instead, we get caught up in the story and hold on to our
seats.</P>
<P>For the six of you on the planet who didn't see Jurassic Park, a
scientist, John Hammond, found a way to bring dinosaurs back to life by
cloning ancient DNA.  The dinosaurs were bred and raised as exhibits
for a brand-new safari park. At the park's premiere, the dinosaurs ran
amok and killed lots of people.</P>
<P>At the beginning of Lost World, we learn that those dinosaurs were
destroyed, but that other dinosaurs on another island survived. Now,
naturalists are going to the island to study dinosaur behavior and
"adventurers" are going back for fun and profit. Ian Malcolm, a
mathematician who survived Jurassic Park, is going to the island to
save his girlfriend (Dr. Sarah Harding, played by Julianne Moore).</P>
<P>But really, what does plot matter when you have an excellent summer
action movie with cool special effects?</P>
<P>Spielberg said something like, "Last time we invented the instrument.
This time we learned how to play it." That's a very apt summary of Lost
World. In Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs were treated with a sense of
awe: their mere existence (both on film and in the film) was enough.
The first time we see them, the characters spend a few moments staring
at the brachiosaurs. They didn't really have to do anything because we
hadn't seen them before.This time, Spielberg gets to the dinosaur
scenes more quickly and spends less time introducing them.  This allows
for more screen time devoted to seeing them doing cool stuff, like
eating people.</P>
<P>There are new dinosaurs in this movie. The little "compys" attack in
little hops, jumps, and nips. But because of their sheer numbers they
are almost more frightening than the big Tyrannosaurus Rexes. There are
two T. Rexes this time, along with a little baby one. And of course the
velociraptors are back (though not as prominently featured as last
time).</P>
<P>There is also an excellent action sequence that involves a T. Rex
pushing an occupied bus over a cliff. The sequence lasts several
minutes, and the tension never lets up.</P>
<P>Another sequence shows the dinosaurs on the run from the hunters. In
perhaps the most amazing shot, the camera follows a motorcycle through
the legs of a running dinosaur.</P>
<P>For the six of you on the planet who are going to this movie to see the
characters, they were alright. The big game hunter Roland Tembo (played
impatiently by Pete Postlethwaite -- don't you just love saying that
name?) was hard not to like.  Goldblum played the same character as
last time, a little flatly, but he was given some good lines. His
daughter was likeably headstrong without being a "tomboy." That she was
a different race and that the movie didn't apologize for it or explain
it away was a nice bow to color blindness (reminiscent of the casting
of Kenneth Branagh and Denzel Washington in Much Ado about Nothing).</P>
<P>A few little jokes are hidden in the movie near the end. Japanese
businessmen run away from the rampaging monster in a wry little quote
from Godzilla. A pedestrian who gets eaten is played by David Koepp,
the screenwriter. In another quick shot, we see two posters in a video
store: one for a Robin Williams version of Jack and the Beanstalk (the
last movie from Williams, a friend of Spielberg, was called Jack), and
a Schwarzenegger version of Shakspeare's King Lear.</P>
<P>A friend of mine said that there was too much King Kong/Godzilla going
on at the end, and she's right that it didn't really fit with the rest
of the movie, but it seems to be part of the action genre to throw in a
little tongue-in-cheek humor here and there. Keep that in mind, and you
won't have to roll your eyes at the humor.</P>
<P>It's hard to imagine anyone not knowing what they're getting into when
they go see Lost World. So since you're not expecting artful costumes,
insightful dialog, or careful exploration of themes, I can safely
recommend this movie as another great summer escape.</P>
