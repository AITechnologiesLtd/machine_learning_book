<PRE>THE ICE STORM (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Ang Lee
Writer: James Schamus (from the novel by Ron Moody)
Starring: Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, Jamie Sheridan,
Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd, David
Krumholtz, Katie Holmes, Henry Czerny, Michael Cumpsty, Glenn Fitzgerald</P>
<P>Sometimes in life, the role models we grow up with are as confused as we
are.  Such is the case in Ang Lee's newest film since "Sense and
Sensibility:" "The Ice Storm."  All the people in this film are
immature, but that's just because even the parents have no one to rely
on for help, what being the time of Watergate and the sexual
revolution.  "The Ice Storm" brings us an atmospheric, moody, and
entertaining little morality play which never gets preachy or even
boring.</P>
<P>"The Ice Storm" choses its time and place to be around Thanksgiving in
1973, and in suburban Connecticut.  Here we meet two families: the Hoods
and the Carvers.  Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is married to Elena (Joan
Allen), but is having an affair with Janie Carver (Sigourney Weaver),
though there is no passion except for that of sexual.  It seems that Ben
is ignoring his wife for Janie, who is ignoring and also being ignored
by her workaholic husband, George (Jamie Sheridan, who played the devil
in "The Stand" mini-series).</P>
<P>This all rubs off on the kids of each family, who are growing up being
raised by confused parents, and of course, with Nixon lying out his ass
on the television.  Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci) is not only very
anti-Nixon and very political in her thinking, but is very sexually
precocious, as she is experimenting with the confused and near-silent
Mikey Carver (none other than Elijah Wood, who made this after his
performance in "Flipper," I think).  Of course, Mikey's younger brother,
Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd, who was in Jodie Foster's "Little Man Tate"),
lusts after Wendy in the worst way (staring at her butt crack in band
practice, pitifully trying to talk to her, etc).</P>
<P>The other Hood kid is Paul (Tobey Maguire, who's in Woody Allen's next
flick, "Deconstructing Harry"), who is enrolled at a classy prep school
where he lusts after the intelligent Libbets (Katie Holmes).  Paul is
basically the protagonist, as everything is seen through his eyes, even
if he is reminiscing about something which he was detached from.  He's
also a symbol of parental uncaring, as his parents have shipped him off
to a far-away school, and never see him.  His relationship with everyone
but Wendy is damn near silent (he has an awkwardly hysterical scene with
Ben in the car-ride from the train-ride towards the middle).</P>
<P>The film views the parents with a negative light, as they are often
giant hypocrites, and totally immature.  Everyone seems to want to live
without any responsibilities, even Elena, who almost seems like a
martyr, but her character is much deeper than that.  She has a part
where she re-enacts what her daughter does - riding a bike, and
shoplifting.  But the shoplifting, of course, is hardly as sucessful as
it is when Wendy does it, thus the adults cannot be as wreckless as the
kids are.</P>
<P>But in the same vein, the kids cannot be as immature as the parents
are.  Wendy is constantly fooling around with the two Carver kids, and
sometimes with bad results.  Her "I'll show you mine if you show me
yours" game is caught by Janie (who gives a greatly hysterical and
satirical speech to her), while she is later caught fooling around with
Mikey by someone (in a great scene where she puts on a Nixon mask).</P>
<P>The film is highly satirical of both though.  The parents are in a
confusing time, therefore are not totally to blame.  The film is
intelligent enough to not pass all the blame onto them anyway, but
contribute it to the way the world was at the time.  Nixon is being
investigated for Watergate, the sexual revolution is going on...it's
just not a good time.  Everyone is confused, and we see the result of
all this with a tear-jerking tragedy at the end that almost had me
weeping, if I wasn't in a theater.</P>
<P>Like "Boogie Nights," "The Ice Storm" feels exactly like the time it has
chosen to take place in.  We get the full feel of the 70s, with all the
fashion, the waterbeds, the key parties, etc.  Ang Lee choses very
little actual 70s music (I heard some Jim Croce and Harry Nilsson), but
the film feels exactly like the 70s were.  So kudos to whomever did the
research.</P>
<P>The acting is also amazing, with several people standing out for
possible Oscar contenders.  Kevin Kline is predictably brilliant, giving
a wonderful dramatic performance with total human feeling.  The scene in
the car with his son is a prime example of him trying to be a good
parent but failing because he's human and doesn't actually know his son
anymore.  Joan Allen, who might be seeing her third consecutive Oscar
nomination, is also brilliant, creating a full person out of someone who
could just be a shallow character.  Sigourney Weaver also constructs a
multi-layered performance, especially at a scene where she tells Ben why
she ditched him one day when they were about to screw.  Jamie Sheridan
has a very little part, but he's still awesome, especially at the end,
and in a scene which consists of what has to be the shortest sex scene
in cinematic history...well, since that one in "Booty Call."</P>
<P>The kid actors are also amazing.  Tobey Maguire has a very small part,
but still rocks.  Adam Hann-Byrd is just amazing as the younger brother,
and Elijah Wood even gives a great performance.  Hopefully his career
will perk back up after this one (I'm talking about Elijah).  </P>
<P>The best performance, though, goes to Christina Ricci, who finally gets
a chance to shine in a role which is complex, and more human.  Sure,
she's always great (her Wednesday Addams is classic), but here she
actually gets to do human drama.  She has a kind of Lolita-esque draw to
her, and she just gives a mesmerizing performance among everybody else. 
Of course, no one actor steals the show, which makes this one of the
best ensemble films of the year.</P>
<P>Ang Lee has created a pure masterpiece here, and what may be the best
film I've seen all year (along with "Boogie Nights").  If he doesn't get
nominated for an Oscar this year, there's really something wrong,
because "The Ice Storm" is a wonderful film, handled with the utmost
delicacy to every human detail.  Like "Boogie Nights," I was blown away
by this film, but in far more different and emotional way.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
