                       A film review by Graeme Huggan
                        Copyright 1996 Graeme Huggan</PRE>
<P> Carry on Matron is the last great Carry-on film in my opinion. Made in
1972, it still features most of the regulars of this genre. Sid James 
plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills 
from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit,
Kenneth Williams is Sir Bernard Cutting, head of the hospital but also a
hypochondriac, Hattie Jacques re-takes her role as Matron, and Charles
Hawtrey is the psychiatrist Dr.Goode. 
 The jokes come in fast and so do the laughs, with humorous antics 
between the Matron and Sir Bernard. This time, Williams is after Matron
(Jacques) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting 
Dr.Goode. The doctor (Hawtrey) is sworn to secrecy:-
  "I assure you, that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and 
 straight out of the other!"
Bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself. 
 There are great cameos from Joan Sims, an expectant mother who is many 
weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene, and from Kenneth 
Connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work (at the 
railway station).
 Sid James' gang including Cyril his son (Kenneth Cope) try to find out 
where the pills are by getting Cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in 
at the nurses home. He has to share a room with Nurse Ball (Barbara 
Windsor) and she soon sees through him!
 The film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with 
panic ensuing. 
 There are good performances by Hattie Jacques as the Matron, however her 
character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 
'Matron's'. Williams is, as usual, on top form, but Sid James isn't given 
a very good part in this movie and I would forgive anyone to forget that 
he was in the movie at all. The same does not go for Charles Hawtrey, for 
although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has 
scarce screen time, he seems to steal every scene he is in. 
 By not making use of Sid James and Barbara Windsor's talent to full 
effect, the film seems to flounder, but it certainly makes up for it with 
it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters. This film is 
genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored! </P>
<PRE> My rating:- 4 out of 5 stars.</PRE>
