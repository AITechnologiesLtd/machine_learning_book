<PRE>                            THE BASKETBALL DIARIES
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Directed by Scott Kalvert
Based on the memoir by Jim Carroll
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Bruno Kirby, Lorraine Bracco, Mark Wahlberg</P>
<P>     The motion picture camera just loves some people.  Leonardo
DiCaprio is one such person.  Put him in a scene, any scene, and he
becomes the center of attention.  You have to go back to James Dean or
the young Robert DeNiro to find somebody that had such an easy rappore
with the big screen.  In his first top-billed role, Leonardo DiCaprio
has come to the forefront of young American actors.</P>
<P>     Mark Wahlberg, the artist formerly known as Marky Mark, proves
himself to be a good character actor.  He catches a gritty, streetwise
flavor that lends a sorely needed sense of authenticity to THE
BASKETBALL DIARIES.  Wahlberg might have found his niche is punky tough
guy roles.  No doubt, he will be artfully reprising this kind of
character for years to come.</P>
<P>     Juliette Lewis is a more versatile actor.  She risks falling into
typecasting by doing another version of the white trash character that
she has done in her last several films.  These performances, along with
fine work by Bruno Kirby and Ernie Hudson are a few of the reasons to
see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES.  Unfortunately, the reasons not to see the
film are a much longer and more convincing list.</P>
<P>     Jim Carroll's classic novel of coming of age in the 1960s is
transposed into the 1990s.  All of the flavor of Carroll's novel gets
lost among a series of anachronisms.  One character finds a beat-up
revolver, and this makes him a tough guy on the street.  Much more
powerful weapons have been common for years among ever younger
criminals.  The teenagers get high on furniture polish, when in the
1990s real drugs are readily available everywhere in New York.  Current
urban problems like crack and AIDS are not mentioned in the film.  A
major scene takes place in a subway bathroom, when subway bathrooms
have been shuttered for over a decade.  Even the whole sense of the
young white Catholic schoolboys going around New York in his school
uniform has vanished through waves of white flight to the suburbs.  If
the story needed to be updated, a better job needed to be done.  It
seems as if the film makers were simply too cheap to paint over the
graffiti and rent the old cars for the street scenes.  Relocating the
story from the middle class north of Manhattan to the seedy Lower East
Side also didn't add anything more to the story except a bunch of
cliches.</P>
<P>     Those complaints aside, some of which perhaps would only annoy
native New Yorkers, the film stumbles badly in its overall structure.
Jim Carroll's book is a series of loosely related incidents.  The film
makers change it into a linear anti-drug story that is not really
faithful to the books irreverent and wistful tone.  Beautifully funny
scenes of teenagers causing trouble become turgid episodes in REEFER
MADNESS like anti-heroin cautionary tale.  A judgmental Reagan era
just-say-no feeling has been injected into the aimless and amoral
goings on of Carroll's life.  Anybody that saw the German film
CRISTIANE F. has seen this all before.</P>
<P>     Director Scott Kalvert's experience as a rock video director is
evident in a few disjointed scenes.  Narrative elements become filler
between psychedelic montages set to alternative rock music.  A scene of
a burning basketball hoop is a great image, but it seems forced into
the story just to create a good rock video effect.  Some of the music
comes from Jim Carroll's own band.  These images will probably wind up
in rock videos that will be better than the film.  The sound track album
is by far better than the film too.</P>
<P>    A better attempt at adapting an unadaptable novel about street
life in New York was done with LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN featuring
Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Martin Scorcese's MEAN STREETS also creates a
much more coherent and authentic urban vision, using much of the same
cut-to-the-beat technique.  For an anti-drug film that manages to be
good cinema, Otto Preminger's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM is still tops
in the genre.</P>
