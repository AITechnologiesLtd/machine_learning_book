<P>It may take a second viewing to see if `Fight Club' makes any
sense at all, but first-time writer Jim Uhls (adapting Chuck
Palahniuk's novel) has fashioned a sardonic, darkly funny script,
and David Fincher keeps the film involving at every turn.</P>
<P>Another reason why `Fight Club' works so well is the forceful
performance of Edward Norton. He first caught the public's eye as a
schizophrenic choirboy in `Primal Fear', and garnered his second
Oscar nomination last year for the powerful `American History
X'. Norton can carry a film with the best of them, and `Fight
Club' might just make him a star.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt is charismatic in as Tyler, showing that he belongs in
Fincher's films (he starred in `Seven') rather than in
melodramatic trash like `Seven Years In Tibet' and `Meet Joe
Black'. Helena (`Wings Of The Dove') Bonham Carter's
faux-American accent wasn't believable, but the choice to cast her
was an interesting one.</P>
<P>The opinions on `Fight Club' will differ from person to person,
but my conclusion is that the film is an unsettling, freakish
experience, but it will reward those who choose to accept it. It'll
be interesting to watch `Fight Club' in 30 years and see how it
stands the test of time, because it brings up issues that may be
important sooner than we think. To quote the tagline for this
year's `Minus Man', `conversation usually follows.'</P>
