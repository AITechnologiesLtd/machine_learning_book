<P>STATE AND MAIN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (<A HREF="mailto:bill@filmfreakcentral.net">bill@filmfreakcentral.net</A>)</P>
<P>starring Alec Baldwin, Charles Durning, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy
written and directed by David Mamet</P>
<P>I've always found it odd that movies about moviemaking tend to come from 
young directors, who haven't any perspective on the profession yet. To 
point the camera back at Hollywood at all is an exercise in 
self-indulgence, but the results are generally more satisfying when it's an 
old hand behind that camera. (Every year at the Toronto International Film 
Festival, I must sit through two or three debut films that are about the 
biz, and none of them ever hold a candle to Robert Altman's career abstract 
The Player.) Playwright, script doctor and highbrow filmmaker David Mamet 
skewers the pre-production stage of big-budget features in his latest 
motion picture State and Main, and while it's more insightful than most of 
its kin about the screenwriter's place in the food chain (no surprise 
there), I can't help but think its last line, "Cue the dead horse," should 
have been the first, because Mamet beats one from the get-go.</P>
<P>The setting for this screwball-ish comedy is a Vermont hamlet in which "The 
Old Mill" will soon be shot--though not before the project is renamed: 
turns out the town's old mill, the very reason they set up shop there, 
burned down decades ago. (Like many of State and Main's ironies, this plot 
development hopes we were born yesterday; that the film's title setting 
would be overlooked during the initial location scout is maddeningly 
illogical.) The start date is also threatened by one star's (Alec Baldwin) 
paedophilic fling and another's (Sarah Jessica Parker) refusal to perform a 
nude scene; in the meantime, a local woman (Rebecca Pidgeon) becomes muse 
to the insecure screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a theatre vet. 
Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, vacillates between robotic and just plain terrible, 
as always--she has the glassy-eyed stare of someone being fed her lines 
off-screen. Aside from nepotism, Mamet is guilty of leaving several story 
strands flapping in the breeze, and I can't believe that his years of 
experience with such ripe targets as Brian DePalma amounted to this. In the 
end, State and Main so much resembles the cinema-obsessed work regularly 
generated by naive film school graduates that it might be more prudent to 
call it brilliant parody. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and
