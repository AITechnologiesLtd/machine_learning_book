<P>The Castle is not another quirky local comedy.  Rather it is a
genuinely funny and touchingly honest tale that is firmly rooted in
the typical Australian spirit of mate ship and barracking for the
underdog, themes that it shares with the criminally ignored Mr
Reliable.</P>
<P> The first big screen outing for the creators of tv's
Frontline, the popular current affairs satire that has successfully
blended razor sharp humour and biting satire with a format that is
close to straight drama, The Castle is a real winner.  While not quite
as sharply written as Frontline, this simple yet affecting and amusing
comedy taps into readily recognisable and endearing characters, who
are brilliantly created and richly detailed.</P>
<P>The Kerrigans are a typical working class family who enjoy the
simple pleasures of life.  Their modest little home in the northern
suburbs of Melbourne is filled with warmth, humour and love, even if
it does back up to the adjoining runway on the nearby airport.  They
also enjoy the serenity of their small lake side holiday home in
Bonnie Doon, even though it is located beneath high voltage power
cables.  Tow truck driver Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) is the head
of this close knit family of honest battlers, a simple optimist and
philosopher who is constantly full of praise and makes every one in
the family feel important and worthwhile.  Even their wayward jail
bird son Wayne (Wayne Hope) is still considered an important part of
this nuclear family.</P>
<P>When Darryl is served notice that his house is to be
compulsorily acquired to allow for airport extensions he goes in to
fight.  Every man's home is his castle, but for the Kerrigans their
quarter acre block is much more, as their family home is full of
memories and rich resonant echoes of their past, emotional ties that
no amount of money or compensation can replace.  Darryl is not too
sure how to fight for his house, but he knows that it is not right
that anyone can just legally take away a man's home, and although he
suffers some early setbacks in the courts, he is not about to give up.
We see events unfold from the rather naive perspective of Dale
Kerrigan (tv veteran Stephen Curry), the youngest son who idolises his
father and who doesn't always comprehend the intricate machinations of
the complex legal struggle.</P>
<P>In the wrong hands this material could have gone terribly
wrong, and it would have been so easy to laugh at the Kerrigans and
their naive optimism and simple view of life.  But such is the
strength, intelligence and compassion in the marvellous script from
writers and co-creators Jane Kennedy, Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and
Rob Sitch (who also directs) that the Kerrigans become an endearing
lot, and audiences laugh with them and share in their struggle.  We
empathise with the family and their plight and we thrill as they
somewhat foolishly take on greedy developers over a principle.</P>
<P>Much of the film's charm comes from the casting, which is well
nigh perfect, and the natural performances from veteran actors who
were enthusiastically encouraged to improvise and explore their
characters more fully.  Caton (best known for his role as Uncle Harry
in tv's long running soap The Sullivans) is perfectly cast as Darryl,
and he gives a generous and warm performance, maintaining a subtle
balance of understated humour and quiet strength.  Tiriel Mora is
marvellous as Dennis Denuto, the small time lawyer and family friend
who finds himself out of his depth when dealing with the complexities
of constitutional law and high powered corporate lawyers in silk
suits, and he brings dishevelled charm and earthy humour to the film
in a scene stealing performance.  Veteran Charles (Bud) Tingwell, an
old favourite who found a whole new audience through his
collaborations with the film's writers on The Late Show, brings
dignity and intelligence to his role as Lawrence Hamilton, the retired
QC who takes the Kerrigan's fight all the way to the High Court.
         While the emotionally draining Shine is taking Australian
films to the world and reaping richly deserved accolades, this more
modest local production is easily one of the best films produced by
the local industry in quite some time.  The Castle is a simple yet
honest and topical story that audiences can relate easily to, and it
succeeds beautifully through an assured mix of sheer charm, humour and
enthusiasm.</P>
