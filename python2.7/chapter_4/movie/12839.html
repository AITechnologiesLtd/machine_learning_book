<P>One of Kyle McLachlan's earlier cinematic features, this movie has had
an obvious influence on such films as THE TERMINATOR (8/10), SPECIES
(7/10) and the more recent, FALLEN with Denzel Washington.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A science-fiction picture set in modern times, this thriller follows
the exploits of an "entity" from outer space, who likes to inhabit
human bodies, use them up until they are completely worn out, and then
switch over to the next available receptacle. FBI agent (McLachlan) and
local top cop (Nouri) are charged with the capture of this "thing"
before it's too late.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This fast-paced, urban equivalent of THE THING (8/10), checks in on all
cylinders for ultra-violence (God knows how many people died in this
movie), action and an overall rock 'n roll attitude. Then again, how
can you go wrong with an "alien" that likes the Ferraris, guns, heavy
metal music and sexy girls ?! Granted, the plot isn't the most
elaborate of tales (alien bad, find alien, kill alien), but I can
honestly say that I was never once bored during the viewing of this
entire picture.</P>
<P>I wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like car chases, murders,
and bland acting, but for all the rest of you out there, those who
enjoy putting away their brains every now and again, sitting back,
slamming back some salsa'd nachos, and relishing in the cheeze some
call film... have a blast !! </P>
<P>Two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this
gore-fest. The opening sequence is one of the most rockin' scenes to
open any action movie, and the subsequent extra-terrestrial
"transformation" is another eye-catcher. Even the late 80's special
effects were okay. Followed by THE HIDDEN II in 1994.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts:  
This film was Kyle MacLachlan's first non-David Lynch foray into the
world of feature films. His first two movie appearances were in Lynch's
wretched DUNE (4/10) and the sensational BLUE VELVET (8.5/10)<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
