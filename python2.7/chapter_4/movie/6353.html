<PRE>                        THE USUAL SUSPECTS
                    A film review by Joe Clark
                     Copyright 1996 Joe Clark</PRE>
<P>Collar enough Hollywood B-list actors for a single picture-- Gabriel
Byrne, Kevin Spacey, and a very greasy Stephen Baldwin, among others--
and boom, you've got a gestalt. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects sets
something of a high-water mark for the crime-gone-wrong genre and
rivals Pulp Fiction for moxie. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie's
unrelentingly intelligent, multi-layered storyline is so intricate
that to tell you anything about the plot would set the rest of the
story unraveling. (Truly.)</P>
<P>So let's talk about subtext. This is a blood-stained but strangely
sexless guy movie. I counted all of four female characters, but they
barely surface amid the main cast's riptide of uneasy male
camaraderie. This is the '90s, so of course a palpable homo friction
is part of the weave; while it ain't homoerotic per se, it is
homo-interesting, with only one "fag" epithet to sock you in the eye.</P>
<P>Still, hyper-leftist cinephiles obsessed with the Holy Trinity of
minority representation ("in the name of the Gender, the Race, and the
Sexual Orientation") will have their hands full grappling with the
film's portrayal of disability: It's every bit as nuanced and depraved
as the disabled character himself. The Usual Suspects is exciting,
daring, and gripping, but it's also the most feverishly anti-crip
movie of the last 20 years, a fact I was almost enraptured enough to
forgive. Almost.</P>
