Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>The original "Babe," came out of left field in 1995, surprising 
everybody with its charming story and original animal characters, and 
eventually led to being nominated for several Academy Awards, including 
Best Picture. I suspect, "Babe: Pig in the City," the first sequel to 
that picture, will have no such luck.</P>
<P>Starting off where the first film ended, Babe (voice by E.G. Daily), an 
intelligent, caring pig, and Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) return home 
after winning the Sheepdog contest. After Farmer Hoggett gets into an 
accident and is bed-ridden, and the farm becomes in danger of 
foreclosure, Hoggett's wife (Magda Szubanski) decides to take Babe to a 
faraway fair in hopes of winning the prize money. On their way there, 
however, she is suspected of being a drug smuggler at the airport, and 
finds herself and Babe stranded in a large, fantasy-like city, where 
looking out the window of their hotel, you can see the Eiffel Tower, the 
Statue of Liberty, the Hollywood sign, etc.</P>
<P>"Babe: Pig in the City," is in the style of "Babe," with three little 
mice introducing the different sections of the film with chapter names, 
and with the same storybook narrator. But, for some reason, director 
George Miller decided to evade this film with a preoccupation of 
sadness, death, and destruction. Its G-rating is a joke because of its 
darkness, but that is not really my problem with the film, since all of 
the best family pictures, like 1939's "The Wizard of Oz," and 1971's 
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," have a wicked side. My 
objection is that it does not merily deal with these elements, but it 
dwells in it. Although there is comedy, most of it sinks under its own 
weight because of its somberness.</P>
<P>One of the most innovative ideas of, "Babe: Pig in the City," is that 
the city is not a certain place, but a mixture of every city in the 
world. Because of this, it was a huge letdown that the film did not 
venture out into the different places, but was set almost entirely in a 
hotel. For a film that cost $80-million to make, I think the makers got 
jipped, although the animals, with their mouths moving when they talked, 
was more seamless and real-looking than the first film.</P>
<P>"Babe: Pig in the City," is mostly a joyless sequel to the joyful 
original. James Cromwell obviously was just cashing a paycheck, since he 
only had three scenes and about three lines. Magda Szubanski was sweet 
as Wife Hoggett, but too often was the butt of the jokes. And I liked 
Mary Stein as the hotel manager and secret animal lover. The climax was 
nicely done and exciting, for the most part, and I liked the chimpanzee 
characters, but it simply felt like a missed opportunity to explore the 
unusual, but visually gorgeous city. The film is more action-oriented, 
rather than filled with the warmth of its predecessor. With all of the 
dark going-ons in "Babe: Pig in the City," at the end, it felt like Babe 
wasn't so innocent anymore.</P>
