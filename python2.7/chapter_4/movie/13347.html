<PRE>          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Louis Malle's films have always been about the interaction between two, or
more, characters.  DAMAGE is not any different at all.</P>
<P>It would be very easy to call Louis Malle, the quintessential film  director
one can study in academic circles.  DAMAGE is another fine example of what
the art of directing is all about.  Nicely tied moments, and a cohesive
story.  Made even more so, by the actions of the director.  Malle, despite
his American connections  ( married to Candace Bergen ), has never lost his
feel for directing something, and is ( and will ) be remembered for it for a
long time  to come.</P>
<P>DAMAGE is the story of an English diplomat that is on the verge of becoming
a prime minister, but his ability to get his job done has met an enemy.  It
is his 'double', or his other personality.  And for his indiscretion, he
loses his whole life.  Society can be cruel, but then so can the
individuals, be they the Stephens intertwined in their chances of success,
or Anna, whose life seems to be a series of tragic incidents she happens to
bring to a close everytime.  While Stephens  sees and understands that he
can not continue what he is doing, Anna is engaged to his son, he still does
it.  And it costs him
his own son.  And social position.</P>
<P>As the film closes, the older Stephens is admiring a picture of Anna on his
wall.  He observes that he saw Anna once more, but she didn't  see him.  She
had had a child with the Frenchman that helped her
before.  And that he had lost her special feeling.  The wildness.</P>
<P>I suppose that there are a couple of things this fine film would like  to
make us all see.  why is it that the impossible is always so attractive, so
clear, so desirable -- and yet, so utterly destructive.  Or is
it, as the credits suggest, that woman, while strong to pursue her desires,
is still weak -- just like any man -- when it comes to drawing a line, or to
stop.</P>
<P>Louis Malle's best strength has always been centered on the characters he
works with, and their inner strength, or inability to work with it.  And
their interplay in the face of disaster.  The ones that show
the weaker and emotional sides, generally fail.  The son is the example
here.  society manages to hurt, or damage, the rest.</P>
<P>Carefully shot, with beautiful musical passage strewn throughout, this film
is slow, but it is attractive, with excellent acting throughout, and it
manages to keep us wondering where it will all lead.  But while
Stephens is still stuck in a time warp, has everyone else gained, or lost.?</P>
<P>Excellently directed with very intricate and delicate dialogue exchanges.
Tender when it needs to be.  Sexual when it needs to be ( the angles are
faster, and the style cuts faster ).  This film is one of those that is sad,
but it is a triumph of tenderness about one side of our nature, which has a
tendency to hurt us in this modern day and age.  Is it us, or is it the
social mold that has done us wrong.?  Anna is having the same problem on
another scale.</P>
