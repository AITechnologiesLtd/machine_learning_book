<P>     In the supremely entertaining BATMAN FOREVER, director Joel
Schumacher serves up *story*.  Five stories, actually, as if he's
anxious to dispel the myth/truth that a BATMAN movie can only be about
atmosphere.  Working from a strong script that emphasizes the *humor*
of Gotham City, the veteran director presents a colorful grab bag of
"scarred psychoses."</P>
<P>     There's the Riddler (Jim Carrey), a nerdy scientist who's invented
a device to "read men's minds."  He's in cahoots with Two-Face (Tommy
Lee Jones), the scarred ex-District Attorney who is Gotham's villain du
jour.  Back at Stately Wayne Manor, the Big Guy (Val Kilmer, replacing
Michael Keaton) is thinking about retiring the cape, while his ward,
Dick Greyson (Chris O'Donnell), is itching to play dress-up.  And,
chasing everyone listed above, is a pin-up psychologist (Nicole Kidman)
who's on hand to diagnose dreams and reaffirm the lead character's
heterosexuality.</P>
<P>     Each character in BATMAN FOREVER gets their own story, which is
fair enough.  Unfortunately, only two of those stories really work.
The Riddler's is the most fun, with Jim Carrey in fine form as the
disgruntled Wayne Enterprises employee who wants his *own* revenge.
His Riddler is the life of the party, though we could stand to see more
of what his invention does.  The other fun one is Chris O'Donnell as
Robin.  He's the human side of BATMAN FOREVER, and he brings a fresh
vitality to a series that's always in danger of taking itself too
seriously.  He even gets to joyride in the Batmobile, though no one
bothers to explains why said vehicle has *two* tail fins in certain
scenes, instead of one.</P>
<P>     Val Kilmer makes an intriguing Caped Crusader, but he plays his
part too straight.  There's no edge to his character--nothing to
distinguish the fact that *he's* Batman.  He may be sturdier than his
predecessor, but, frankly, he's a bit of a bore as he spends the entire
film brooding over whether or not to be Batman.  To cowl, or not to
cowl?  (Here is where huge chunks of the story seem to be missing.
Bruce Wayne seeks help for his dreams, but we're never shown the scene
where he's supposedly "cured."  We see him *after* the fact, but the
scripted explanation involving a diary and a giant bat (!) has been
dropped.  Why?)</P>
<P>     There's enough energy around Kilmer to compensate for his flat
Bat, though, even if said superhero functions more like James Bond in a
cape than the Dark Knight detective of the comic books.  Case in point:
the unnecessary romance between Kilmer and Kidman.  They barely have
any screen time together!  Like most of the story, their "love
triangle" isn't given enough room to breathe.  For super-battles, quick
quick is fine; for romance it's a bust.</P>
<P>     Academy Award winner Tommy Lee Jones plays the other villain,
Harvey "Two-Face" Dent.  He's obsessed with justice, but he raves too
much for us to believe him.  The actor also gets quite a few good
lines, though much of his dialogue is muted, as if someone decided that
the audience would only laugh at Jim Carrey.  The jokes on
them--however broadly he's played, Two Face is still more amusing than
the one-dimensional Riddler.</P>
<P>     If this second villain seems to get lost in the shuffle, it's
because Two-Face is introduced immediately, with no background or
context for the audience.  The director must be counting on the
viewer's presold knowledge of the characters; something that isn't true
if you haven't been reading your Happy Meal.  The credits are rolled
over his bank robbery sequence, and it's a lousy to way to start a
movie.  It's too abrupt. They should've kept the originally scripted
opening scene of Two-Face's escape from Arkham Asylum.</P>
<P>     In fact, there are several places in BATMAN FOREVER where footage
seems to be missing.  Was Schumacher under pressure from Warner to
bring the film in under two hours?  The movie is missing about ten to
fifteen minutes of extra footage--small (or not so small) pieces that
could go a long way to explaining some of the action.  What exactly
does Batman's "sonar suit" do, for example?  The order of some scenes
could also be questioned.  For example, the director interrupts a
montage of Riddler robberies to show young Master Dick drying his
clothes like Jackie Chan.  It's a great a bit, but out of place at that
point in the film.</P>
<P>     BATMAN FOREVER is certainly more fun than the first films, due in
no small part to the numerous nods to the TV series.  The characters
spend more time joking than fighting, while the director lightens
nearly every scene with a skewered camera angle or two.  Holy homage!
There's also a ton of clever details, ranging from a beefcake shot of
the Bat Butt to a creatively coifed character affectionately titled
"Dr. Burton."  Catch some of these on the third and fourth viewing.</P>
<P>     The technical credits are all very good.  The art direction is
impeccable, with superb sets, costumes, and makeup.  The special
effects are good to very good--and rely a little too heavily on
the computer-generated sort, if you ask me.  The music is by Elliott
Goldenthal, who replaces Danny Elfman.  He's written a fine, loud score
that never once breaks into the familiar refrain of "na na na na na na
na na, BATMAN!"</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  The breeziest of the three movies, BATMAN FOREVER comes  
              the closest to reconciling the Dark Knight of the first 
              films with the Camped Crusader of the TV show.  It's a 
              brilliant mix, compressed way too tightly into it's 
              121-minute running time.  Recut, please, and let us see 
              the whole thing.
