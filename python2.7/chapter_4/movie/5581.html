<PRE>MY, HOW BIG YOUR GUNS ARE</PRE>
<P>Well I guess it's that time of the year again. The one time of the year
where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even *try* writing
a script that has more dialogue than explosions. It's also the best
time for the handful of existing bigtime Hollywood Mr Action Heroes to
dust off their miniscule vocabularies, pull on their black vests and
charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become
memorable catchphrases. In America they call this time  "summer" and
it happens once every year. And maybe it's the exposure to all that
nasty sun that does it, but in the process normally weak, insipid lines
like "Consider this a divorce," "Hasta la vista, baby," and "You're the
disease. I'm the cure" actually
 do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of
biblical proverbs. This is not entirely a bad thing, of course.</P>
<P>What am I talking about? I'm talking about the summer "blockbusters,"
the "action thrillers," the "this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know-
everyone's-going-to-go" explosions, gas threats, flying saucers, and
special effects.  In the rash of "my, what big guns you have, but wait!
mine are bigger" movies, there are also the usual
boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies (or whale, whatever), and
*this* year, the odd crop of "save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment-
threats" offerings. I'm talking about the three BATMANS, the SPEEDS,
the TERMINATORS, etc.  This year I'm talking about TWISTER,
INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE ARRIVAL, THE ROCK, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, and of
course, ERASER.</P>
<P>Here in Singapore, as our local movie critics like to whine, we seem to
get the pick of the crop of "my explosion is more real-looking than
yours" movies, but nothing else. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE opened in our
theatres almost as soon as it did in the US. The same goes for ERASER,
which is unfortunate for Arnold Schwarzenegger because  coming so soon
after what Time magazine recently called "Mission: Unavoidable"
 (on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz), ERASER seems
like a cheaper, less thoughtful imitation. That's saying a lot, because
MI the movie was already a cheap, thoughtless imitation of its TV
originator of the '60s/'70s.  <p> In ERASER, Arnie is a US federal
marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their
lives in danger. He does this by destroying all evidence of their
present existence and re-situating them with new identities. His new
case is Lee Cullen, played by Vanessa Williams who, unlike all the
other scumbags he's ever relocated, is "an actual, real life honest
person." Because she's so good, and has such nice legs, Arnold spends
the whole movie trying to protect her, and only uses the opening movie
sequence to save Robert Pastorelli from *his* killers. Lee obtains
evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is
secretly selling sophisticated, black-market arms to people with
foreign accents and stringy hair. Of course, as the formula goes, her
revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it
because heck, there are people in high places who will go down with
this, because yes, this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the
world (that is, America) since Watergate.</P>
<P>In protecting Lee, Arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil Robert
Deguerin, nicely played by James Caan, and ends up having to prove that
he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to
making sure Lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new,
green guns his enemies all have.  It's around this time that people in
the theatre with me starting humming the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE theme,
because Arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building
to run a disk.</P>
<P>I guess I should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in
this movie is so antsy about. It's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing
which fires aluminium missiles, and which can see through walls. It has
some sort of X-ray vision, so its user can target the victim's heart
even from great distances. Despite this, which I figure is a pretty
cool feature in a gun (though I'm certainly no expert), however,
Arnold, whose own heart is targeted a number of times, *never* goes
flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like
all the others who get shot by this gun. Instead he outruns and
outsmarts his trackers each time, giving eery and ironic resonance to
that TERMINATOR line that practically made him famous: "I'll be back."</P>
<P>Like everyone else in the theater, I left the movie feeling that the
trailers had duped me, because they made me want to watch this movie
voluntarily. Although there is a *lot* of violence in this movie, not
to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators, I
recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic
mindless action to get over the weirdness of FARGO or the hangover
effect of LEAVING LAS VEGAS.</P>
