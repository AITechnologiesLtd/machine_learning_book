<PRE>                                BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Nizam U.  Ahmed
                        Copyright 1995 Nizam U.  Ahmed</PRE>
<PRE>The Making of BATMAN FOREVER: A Play</PRE>
<PRE>Cast of characters:        Al, a mild-mannered studio exec
                        Bob, a superior studio exec</PRE>
<PRE>Act 1 Scene 1: A meeting</PRE>
<PRE>Bob:        I called you in here today for one reason, son.
Al:        What's that sir?
Bob:        Our plans for an infinite series of blockbuster money-spinners
        is in jeopardy!
Al:        You mean ... the Batman franchise?
Bob:        Exactly!  And you know who is behind it?
Al:        The public ... getting fed up with the same tired old formula
        perhaps?
Bob:        WHAT?
Al:        (Gulp) Erm ... sorry, I mean the film-makers, naturally.  They
        do their best to reduce a film's appeal to merely the intelligent
        and thoughtful, don't they?
Bob:        That's better ...  And who is the prime mover behind this
        attempt at bringing ... the "A" word ... into our money-spinning
        franchise?
Al:        The "A" word?  You mean artistry?
Bob:        DON'T SAY THAT WORD!
Al:        I'm sorry sir!  It's Mr.  Burton, surely?  A guaranteed happy,
        smiley kids film, turned into a dark, brooding nightmare piece?
Bob:        (smiles) I see great things for you boy ... 
Al:        And as for the sequel-
Bob:        Don't talk to me about that sequel!  We've probably lost $20m in
        revenue for Batman 3 'cos of that movie.  I mean, what could be
        guaranteed to turn kids off more than a film about 3 demented
        freaks running around with personality disorders ... 
Al:        Not forgetting the fact that McDonalds didn't want to plug it
        on the side of their milkshakes ... 
Bob:        You've got it in one!  We must make sure the new Batman appeals
        to the youngest possible audience - McDonalds must support us!
Al:        So we should drop Tim Burton ... replace him with more of a
        "team player"?
Bob:        I was thinking perhaps Joel Schumacher ... 
Al:        I completely agree sir!  Someone we can contro- communicate
        with.  And the cast?
Bob:        Think "big stars."
Al:        But shouldn't we think up a story first?
Bob:        Forget the story!  We just need lots of running around, loud
        bangs, vivid colours ...  Stars!  Jim Carrey!  Tommy Lee Jones!
Al:        But they wouldn't gel.
Bob:        PARDON?
Al:        Nothing.  You were saying, big stars ... 
Bob:        Sex appeal ...  Nicole Kidman.  New feminist angle ... make her
        a shrink!  Yes ... and Robin!  We can hype up his appearance in
        the press releases.
Al:        Shouldn't we work on a script now?
Bob:        Give it to one of our lowly writers, tell 'em to knock it up in
        an hour.  It's not important, we want to get the kids!
Al:        But the parents, boss!  They want something they can watch with
        their kids.
Bob:        Okay.  Keep the dark visuals.  Maybe ol' Mr. Burton was onto
        something there ... but I want bright day-glo colours everywhere!
Al:         You got it.  I'll get to work right away sir.  Anything else?
Bob:        Never forget, why are we making this movie?
Al:        $ CHING $ !
Bob:        You'll go far son ... </PRE>
