<P>One of the characters in Judy Berlin describes a movie he is planning to make.
It's going to be about the town he grew up in, and it's not going to have a
plot. All of the people, their actions, and all of the things in the town will
make up the movie, and they will be interesting just because they exist in real
life. Quite an ambitious plan for a film. It's what director Eric Mendelsohn
does with his marvelous little black and white movie. Plotlines are very loose
in Judy Berlin, and indeed the characters actions are sometimes meaningless,
but they are always interesting. The entire movie is so surreal that it will
captivate you, and might even make you think. </P>
<P>On the day of a solar eclipse, Judy Berlin (Edie Falco from The Sopranos) a
geeky, but goodhearted woman with braces is planning to leave for Los Angeles
to became an actress. She meets old high school crush David Gold (Aaron
Harnick) and the two spend the day looking back and forward at the past,
present, and future. David's mother Alice (the late Madeline Khan in her last
performance) roams her home street with her housekeeper pretending to be an
astronaut during the eclipse. Judy's mother Sue (Barbara Barrie) is a preschool
teacher watching the eclipse with her students, earlier she is frightened by a
former sweet old teacher who is losing her memory. She also seems interested in
David's father Arthur, even though he's married. All of the character's are in
some way related, and their plights (whether large or small) make for one of
the most fascinating, entertaining, and best pictures of the year. While others
will dislike the movie, possibly because it isn't really about anything, (and
they're right), I really felt drawn to the situation.</P>
<P>The superb screenplay written by director Mendelsohn really propels this movie.
It captures those strange moments of life when you're on your edge, or someone
surprises you, and finds humor in them. David discovers a different old friend
that hasn't changed since high school, and Alice visits a woman across the
street who claims she called her in an angry rage, but she doesn't remember a
thing. Both Berlins are gentle and vulnerable, indeed the movie seems sprinkled
with some type of sweetness that is almost nonexistent in modern day film. The
fact that Judy Berlin is a very small, and a (most likely) narrow audience
movie, will put it in few theaters. The Shooting Gallery adopted it as it's
opening film in their annual festival, but the movie isn't likely to get any
more of a release. Hopefully video will be a place for this movie to blossom.
It's really a shame though. The black and white is more suited for the big
screen. The contrast of colors in the images (attempted or not) is striking, a
large group of stills from the film would make a stunning collection of black
and white photography. Every one of the actors does a marvelous job, there is
so much talent in the performers, that it's just one of the many reasons to see
this movie two or three times. An honestly endearing film that transports us to
a mix between a real and fantasy world. I can't quite explain it, but this
movie struck such a chord with me that I'm ready to name it one of the best
pictures in several years. This movie about nothing, is certainly something.
Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail said, "All of these little nothings have meant more
to me than all the somethings before." If she were describing this movie, she
would be very, very right.</P>
