<P>William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>After watching the first hour of Baz Luhrmann's
Shakespeare-meets-the-20th-century take on the Bard's most celebrated
romance, I was tempted to dismiss it as a complete disaster, one of the
worst of the year.  The main problem can be illustrated by the opening five
minutes.  Following a reading of the opening narration ("In fair Verona...")
by a newscaster, we are treated to a quick-cut montage setting up the scene
(Shakespeare meets MTV).  We then have the opening Montague-Capulet
confrontation, set at a gas station, with each new character introduced with
a freeze frame and an on-screen ID (Shakespeare meets Trainspotting).  Then
bullets start to fly, and we see John Leguizamo (just awful as Juliet's
cousin Tybalt) flying through the air in slow-mo with guns blazing
(Shakespeare meets John Woo).  In short, Luhrmann tries much to hard to push
the '90s angle, so hard that the story is crushed by all the stylistic
weight.  And without the story to guide it, this first half decomposes into
flamboyant, campy excess, complete with a drag musical number (Shakespeare
meets To Wong Foo) at the costume ball where Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio,
solid) and Juliet (an exceptional Claire Danes, the only one of the young
Americans who makes the Elizabethan speech sound natural) meet, and a
revamped, pool-drenched balcony scene between the two young lovers that is
nothing short of a travesty--a shame since DiCaprio and Danes have such a
charming rapport.</P>
<P>But about midway through the film, something odd happened.
Luhrmann, it seems, decided to rein in a horse that was completely out of
control, and lets Shakespeare's tale tell itself without shoving the
contemporary setting down the audience's throat--the visual style isn't
quite as chaotic, and gone is the painfully forced slapstick.  Luhrmann and
co-scripter Craig Pearce do take a few small yet pivotal deviations from the
original text (most notably in the final scene), but  they mostly work. The
result is a '90s-accessible yet respectful adaptation of the final half, and
it does manage to achieve a level of poignancy, though not as strong as
Franco Zeffirelli's  more traditional 1968 version.  However, as well-done
as the second half is, it can't erase that horrible opening hour.  Moreover,
it just shows how impressive and groundbreaking the film would have been if
the entire picture had been like the second half--making William
Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet more  disappointing.<HR></P>
