<P>   Coincidentally, Univeral has released two movies at the
same time dealing with the theme of injustice toward
members of minority groups.  One is "Snow Falling on
Cedars," in which a Japanese-American is on trial for the
murder of a white man.  The other is "The Hurricane," in
which an African-American is found guilty of murder and
incarcerated for nineteen years.  To plagiarize a paragraph
from my own "Cedars" review....When O.J. Simpson was
found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, critics
of the jury system and of lawyers' tactics were quick to
pounce on the verdict.  Given the racial makeup of the jury
and the defense team's alleged playing of the race card,
cynics and detractors in general were quick to say that the
decision was based not on the evidence but on the
willingness of minority jurors to free an African-American
simply because of his race.  What we all know, though, is
that the situation has almost always been the reverse: jurors
have been prone to find innocent people guilty if the
defendants were members of minority groups. </P>
<P>   Rubin "Hurricane" Carter is a perfect example of a man
convicted by a jury that was swayed by a prosecution team
suffused with racial prejudice.  That point is made
convincingly enough in the film's most cynically humorous
line.  When two patrolmen pull over a car carrying the title
character (Denzel Washington) on his way home, one
remarks, "We're looking for two Negroes in a white car."
Responds Carter, "Any two will do?"  Norman Jewison's
biopic is a dramatization of a major segment of the life of a
Paterson, New Jersey prizefighter who had defeated Emile
Griffith in 1963 to become the welterweight champion of the
world.  </P>
<P>   Like many who take up boxing as a way to enter the
middle class, Carter came from a back of poverty and was in
trouble with the police since he had stabbed a prominent
white man in self-defense.  From the time he was arrested
and sent to a juvenile home, he was pursued by a modern
Javert, Police Lieutenant Della Pesce--described as a bulldog
with glasses (Dan Hedaya)--determined to frame Carter for a
triple murder he did not commit.  </P>
<P>   The film is as high-minded as similar works like "Chariots
of Fire" and, like the football film "Any Given Sunday" which
was released just days before its opening, gives the audience
a taste of the legalized violence which is part and parcel of
contact sports.  Unfortunately, although director Norman
Jewison utilizes the usual tricks of the trade such as frequent
flashbacks, the story is told in a conventional manner more
suited to HBO television than to the big screen.  Featuring an
impressive performance by the always reliable Denzel
Washington (who lost 40 pounds for the role), "The
Hurricane" is a feel-good movie with a razzle-dazzle ending
that could conceivable bring an audience to its feet at the
conclusion.  But Jewison brings little imagination to his
dramatization, turning the story into a disappointingly straight
bad cop-good victim yarn.</P>
<P>    Jewison splits his camera into two segments: one deals
with the struggle that The Hurricane undergoes to transcend
his boyhood days as a victim of a racially biased judicial
system that sent him away and motivated him to turn his
body into a weapon.  The other focuses on a Brooklyn-raised
teen, Lesa Martin (Vicellous Shannon) whom the local school
system was unable to reach and who is now living in Toronto
with three unusual white people who had observed his
intelligence and are tutoring him--Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger),
Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (the British actor, John
Hannah).  Finding Carter's memoirs, "The 16th Round," at a
library sale, Lesra is inspired and becomes bent on
communicating with the prisoner and doing what he can to
get the man freed.</P>
<P>   Norman Jewison comes prepared for a movie like this one,
having directed "In the Heat of the Night" in 1967, a crime
thriller with racial overtones.  That story of a redneck
southern sheriff who accepts the help of a black detective to
solve a murder seems tougher, more atmospheric, with more
cinematic effects that his current offering.  Though Carter
was not exonerated for the crime but rather freed because 
a federal judge (Rod Steiger) found the case tainted by
racial bigotry, Jewsion makes the man a saint.  The picture
is all too solemn, the somewhat fictionalized epistolary
exchange  between Carter and the unconvincing Lesra
dragging the tale down to terminal solmenity.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 125 minutes.  (C) 1999
