<P>Doctor Dolittle should have become a proctologist. Then he'd have 
been better prepared for the unrelenting onslaught of scatological humor 
in this crappy comedy. There's nothing wrong with a gross-out 
joke and "Doctor Dolittle" has quite a few funny ones, but the film's 
unrelenting barrage of butt, rectal and poop humor quickly becomes 
tiresome, and eventually flat-out annoying. Is this really the best these 
guys could do with the concept?</P>
<P>Related to Hugh Lofting's children stories and the 1967 Rex Harrison 
film in name only, this "Doctor Dolittle" begins with a pup (Ellen 
Degeneres) explaining to young John Dolittle that dogs sniff each others 
rears as a way of saying hello. When the boy emulates the behavior and 
takes a whiff of the new minister's ass, it's off to the pound for Ellen, 
while John's father (Ozzie Davis) calls in an exorcist to rid the boy of 
his ability to talk to the animals.</P>
<P>Cut to the present, where the adult John (Eddie Murphy) is a successful 
doctor so caught up in his work that he neglects his family. Although his 
partners are excited that their thriving practice is about to be snapped 
up by an HMO, John has lost his enthusiasm for practicing medicine. 
Things change when he whacks his head in an auto mishap and his gift 
returns. To his amazement, John hears the dog he struck call him 
"bonehead." </P>
<P>Of course, John and Lucky (Norm Macdonald), the recovering mutt, 
become pals. Soon after, the doc treats a wounded owl and word spreads 
through the animal kingdom about the doctor who can talk with the animals.
 John adjusts to the situation and finds his love of healing renewed, 
although his co-workers and family fear he's lost his mind. </P>
<P>That's certainly a sturdy enough framework for a comedy, had the writers 
stretched their imaginations a bit. If you take a couple minutes right 
now, I guarantee you'll come up with at least a dozen gags more inventive 
than those that appear in this film. After viewing "Doctor Dolittle," 
it's easy to imagine the producers strapping writers Nat Mauldin and 
Larry Levin in chairs facing a wall covered with photos of various 
animals' posteriors and saying "Create!" From pigeon poop gags to a long 
scene involving the retrieval of a thermometer from Lucky's rectum, it's 
obvious that Mauldin and Levin spent considerable time sniffing butts in 
preparation for their work.</P>
<P>Despite the repetitive theme, a number of the jokes are funny and several 
of the actor's providing the animal voices do fine work. Norm 
Macdonald is quite likable as the sarcastic Lucky. If only he had been 
this engaging in "Dirty Work," his own recent comedy misfire. Garry 
Shandling and Julie Kavner are funny as squabbling pigeons and 
Albert Brooks contributes a sympathetic performance as a sick tiger. 
Look for quick, but cute, voice work from Paul Reubens as a raccoon, 
and Gilbert Gottfried as an obsessive-compulsive dog. On the other side 
of the coin, Chris Rock is just loud and irritating as a guinea pig with 
attitude.</P>
<P>And then there's Eddie Murphy. In a lapse of judgment more annoying 
than the potty-humor fixation, Murphy is cast in a role where he has 
little to do but react, wasting the actor's comedic skills. Noticing that 
their star has nothing to do, the desperate writers insert a mawkish 
subplot in order to give Eddie the chance to deliver a heartfelt speech 
or two. It doesn't help.</P>
<P>Despite a few good scenes, "Doctor Dolittle" is a drag, a phenomenal 
waste of a good concept and a talented actor. How did such a misfire 
occur? My theory is that someone told the writers that they should 
create a film like "that charming comedy about a pig." Then, in doing 
research, they made the fatal mistake of studying "Porky's" instead of 
"Babe."</P>
