<P>     Richard Linklater, the creator of SLACKERS and DAZED AND CONFUSED, 
has succeeded where many before him have failed--in fashioning a 
modern-day romance that is both original and enthralling.  BEFORE SUNRISE 
is nothing short of movie magic, and the kind of film that deserves to be 
remembered one long year from now when 1996's Oscar nominations are 
handed out. </P>
<P>     Even the best romantic comedy/dramas tend to be formula-driven, 
frequently relying more upon actor chemistry than plot.  Surprises are 
about as foreign to this genre as a pacifist hero is to a shoot-'em-up.  
Somewhere along the way, a storyteller originated the basic love story 
structure.  Film makers have religiously followed this roadmap, rarely 
taking more than an occasional minor detour.  With BEFORE SUNRISE, 
however, Linklater not only travels an entirely different route, but 
heads for a new destination. </P>
<P>     Frankly, this is not the sort of film one usually expects to find in 
multiplexes.  In fact, if it weren't in English, it might be possible to 
mistake this for the work of someone like Eric Rohmer.  The plentiful and 
varied dialogue has a richness that few screenplays manage to capture.  
Most of BEFORE SUNRISE is talking.  The characters touch on subjects 
ranging from language and reincarnation to sexuality and cable access 
shows. </P>
<P>     Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train traveling 
through Europe.  His destination is Vienna, where a flight back to 
America awaits him the next morning.  She's on her way to Paris, where 
she starts classes at the Sorbonne next week.  From their first moment of 
eye contact, they're drawn to each other.  They share a meal in the 
lounge car, savoring the conversation more than the food, and when they 
arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to disembark with him and keep 
him company wandering the streets until the time comes for his plane to 
depart.  Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance. </P>
<P>     One of the first things to notice about BEFORE SUNRISE is how 
completely natural it all seems.  Credit both director Linklater and his 
two leads.  The rapport between Jesse and Celine is so lacking in 
artifice that at times the viewer feels like a voyeur.  We are privy to 
everything, including the sort of "unimportant" dialogue that most films 
shy away from.  Here, its inclusion is just one of many fresh elements. </P>
<P>     Hawke (the American grunge actor who starred opposite Winona Ryder 
in REALITY BITES) and Delpy (the French actress from EUROPA EUROPA, 
WHITE, and KILLING ZOE) are nothing short of perfect.  For this film to 
work, they have a threefold task:  embrace their characters, attract each 
other, and connect with the audience.  Needless to say, all are 
accomplished flawlessly.  From the first stolen glance, there's never any 
question about their chemistry, and it takes no more time for the 
audience to be enraptured by Jesse and Celine than it does for them to 
fall for each other. </P>
<P>     BEFORE SUNRISE is about life, romance, and love.  It magnifies the 
little things, paying scrupulous attention to the subtleties and 
mannerisms of body language.  There's one scene where Jesse has to 
restrain himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and 
another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where the characters 
nervously avoid eye contact. </P>
<P>     This film is an amalgamation of such memorable scenes, yet, as they 
saying goes, the whole is more than a sum of its parts.  Questions about 
fate and the transitory nature of relationships are raised, then left 
open for the audience to ponder.  There are moments of unforced humor, 
and times of bittersweet poignancy.  BEFORE SUNRISE speaks as much to the 
mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a 
responsive chord--a rare and special accomplishment for any motion 
picture. </P>
