<P>     Blame it on the Olympics.  No distributor wants to risk opening 
anything good this week, because they figure everyone's home watching 
synchronized swimming and beach volleyball from down under.  NBC, 
meanwhile, is taking a ratings beating.  Where is everybody?  Abducted 
by aliens?</P>
<P>     Fox Searchlight's sacrificial lamb is a relatively inoffensive bit 
of derivative fluff called "Woman On Top", starring Penelope Cruz ("All 
About My Mother") as Isabella, a Brazilian chef with motion sickness.  
She gets nauseous when she's riding or being ridden; for everything from 
cars to sex she has to be in the driver's seat.</P>
<P>     When her husband Toninho (Murilo Benicio) craves the missionary 
position, she catches him in flagrante delictu, and promptly decamps for 
San Francisco.  She bunks in with her old transvestite friend Monica 
(Harold Perrineau Jr.), and solicits the sea goddess (by phone) to cast 
a spell to remove the cheating bastard from her affections.  She lands a 
cooking show on San Francisco TV.  People fall in love with her.  
Toninho comes to Frisco to get her back.  Nobody cares.  Her show goes 
national, but the creeps from network mess with the formula.  
Hum-de-ho-de-hum.</P>
<P>     The story is full of moments that reveal a careless attitude toward 
the material and the audience.  When Isabella walks down the street in 
San Francisco, men follow her like cats after a fish, but only once; the 
rest of the time they pretty much leave her alone.  When Monica 
accompanies her to the beach for an offering to the sea goddess he 
carries a dog, but there's no dog at their apartment.  When Isabella 
runs after Toninho and gets sick because she had to take the elevator, 
she is foiled because he's turning the corner by the time she reaches 
the street.  Everybody speaks English with a Brazilian accent.</P>
<P>     "Woman On Top" is a by-the-numbers attempt at a "Like Water for 
Chocolate" confection of cookery and magic realism that comes out more 
like last year's half-baked Sarah Michelle Gellar culinary vehicle, 
"Simply Irresistible".  The screenplay is a first try by Vera Blasi, who 
was a film student when she wrote it, but director Fina Torres 
("Celestial Clockwork") has no such excuse.  They seem to be under the 
delusion that by calling something magic you make it magical.   The 
movie tries to survive on the wattage of Cruz's considerable appeal, but 
it's just not considerable enough.  It does get some lift from a lively 
and knowing drag performance from Harold Perrineau Jr. (Mercutio in 
"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"), and it gets plenty of help from 
Luis Bacalov's wonderful Bossa Nova soundtrack featuring various 
Brazilian artists.  But its charm never rises above the calculated level 
of the gift shop at Disney World.</P>
