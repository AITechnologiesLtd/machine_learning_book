<P>     Consider how mainstream movies depict violence.  Bodies are chopped
up, blown apart, and torn to pieces.  Blood and gore flow as freely as
water.  Films like INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE are awash in a crimson
tide, and no one thinks twice about it.  Then along comes a film like
CLEAN, SHAVEN, where nothing is gratuitous, and suddenly viewers are
shocked.  HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER provoked a similar response,
for the same reasons.</P>
<P>     There's no denying that the film is disturbing, at times profoundly
so.  One scene in particular resulted in more than half the audience
wincing, turning away, or leaving.  Often, it's the simplest, most
realistic forms of violence, when portrayed in such a vivid manner, that
cause the stomach to churn.  During CLEAN, SHAVEN's screening at the 1994
Sundance Film Festival, a member of the audience fainted.  As a result of
this single, thirty second sequence, which film maker Lodge Kerrigan
refused to edit out, this movie took nearly eighteen months to acquire a
distributor.</P>
<P>     Peter Winter (Peter Greene) is a schizophrenic, and CLEAN, SHAVEN
introduces us to his world, where paranoid delusions intermingle with
reality.  Through the use of viewpoint photography and stark, unusual
images, we are brought into Peter's mind.  It's not a pleasant place to
be.  Upon occasion, movies like to present a protagonist who straddles
the line of sanity, but CLEAN, SHAVEN shows no such ambiguity.  Peter is
clinically insane.  (One psychiatrist at the screening I attended
described this as "the best portrayal of untreated schizophrenia ever
[presented] on film.")</P>
<P>     The story, which develops largely without dialogue, follows Peter's
quest to locate his young daughter Nicole (Jennifer MacDonald).  Having
been institutionalized for the last several years, Peter has had no
contact with Nicole, who had been living with her grandmother.  Now, she
has been adopted, and he is determined to find her.  His intentions are
profoundly unclear, and he is already under suspicion of having brutally
murdered another young girl.  A detective (Robert Albert) is on his
trail, closing in while gathering evidence.</P>
<P>     In many ways, CLEAN, SHAVEN is an incredible cinematic experience,
but it will neither entertain nor appeal to a "typical" movie-goer.
Writer/director Kerrigan is aware of this, but was unwilling to change a
frame of the final cut.  His vision, which took more than two years to
commit to film, remains intact.  And, frankly, without the controversial
scene, the character study would be incomplete.</P>
<P>     As was true of Michael Rooker in the title role of HENRY, so Peter
Greene is hauntingly convincing as CLEAN, SHAVEN's off-balance lead.
Whether scrubbing his skin with steel wool, cutting into his scalp with a
scissor, curled into a ball fighting against a flashback, or hiding from
his own reflection, Greene has a perfect sense of Peter.  The other
actors are all competent, but their work pales in comparison to this
singular performance.</P>
<P>     It's always difficult to rate a film that, while powerful and well
made, is an exercise in endurance.  There are those--even among the
art-film crowd--who will find this picture unbearable.  Theaters will
warn of its graphic content.  Viewers will endlessly debate all the
unanswered questions posed within.  But no one who sits through this film
is likely to forget it.  CLEAN, SHAVEN is one of those rare movies that
leaves an indelible imprint on anyone still watching as the closing
credits roll.</P>
