<P>I was born in 1975 - the same year, I've been told, that the KISS
legend began. Being a mere zero years old at the time, I had trouble
really appreciating their makeup and pyrotechnics and platform snake
boots. So I am not of the KISS generation. Sure, I know a few people
my age who had KISS lunch boxes when they were little, but I'm not
sure how they knew about them. My most vivid KISS memory is of the
time they decided to take off the makeup. So like much of '70s pop
culture, what little I know about KISS comes through beach towels and
trading cards and beat up plastic dolls at antique malls.</P>
<P>But I still loved DETROIT ROCK CITY, the new comedy about four stoned
teenagers in 1978 overcoming great opposition to see KISS play live in
Detroit.  As far as my born-too-late-to-really-be-sure eyes can tell,
the opening credits are the most accurate cinematic depiction to date
of the appeal of '70s pop culture. Vivid closeups of merchandise and
publicity stills take you on an epic rollercoaster ride through the
land of Fonz and Hulk. Newspaper articles and fuzzy radio reports
document the larger than life, comic book iconography of KISS. The
time and place are set, and the movie never falters or steps out of
character. You are in 1978, and you understand KISS.</P>
<P>Crucial to the movie's success is its dedication to the attitudes of
archaic teen genres of the past. This is more like ROCK N ROLL HIGH
SCHOOL than anything after FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH. It seems odd
that Paul Bartel doesn't make an appearance. From beginning to end,
the characters find over-the-top ways to outrage the authorities, or
to fulfill revenge fantasies.  Girl's restrooms are defiled, lifelong
crushes are consummated, bullies and car thieves are defeated or
attacked by dogs.  Modern teen movies often contain preposterous
stick-it-to-the-man scenarios, and they don't work. Take, for example,
the scene in SHE'S ALL THAT where Freddy Prinze, Jr. just has to ask
and two bullies eat pubic-hair pizza in front of the whole school. In
the context of a modern teen film, these scenes are embarrassing -
they clash with reality on about 17 different levels. Do the
filmmakers know how ludicrous these situations are? It doesn't seem
like it.  They seem to be trying to make something that modern teens
can relate to.  DETROIT ROCK CITY, though, takes a postmodernist
approach, so you know that it's supposed to be absurd when Eddie
Furlong, performing for middle aged women at a strip club, fills an
entire beer pitcher with vomit and manages to arouse the crowd
anyway. And you can laugh at the fantasy fulfillment of Furlong (who,
by the way, still has cheese in his hair from an earlier incident)
then being paid to have sex with erotic thriller queen Shannon Tweed.
A word about vomit: because of the aforementioned scene, clueless
critics will no doubt describe the humor as "grossout" and compare it
to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and AMERICAN PIE. But this is just one
disgusting gag in the context of a deeply funny movie. It doesn't come
across as a set-piece which other scenes are building toward or pale
in comparison to. It also has a precedent in the work of director Adam
Rifkin. In the obscure and underrated black comedy gem THE DARK
BACKWARD, one of Bill Paxton's many vile hobbies is showing off to
women by eating disgusting combinations rotten food.  A lot of the
humor also comes from the stylistic indulgences, beginning right off
the bat with an electric guitar version of the New Line Cinema
fanfare.  Rifkin loads the movie with goofy camera movements and
absurd period details (like Stretch Armstrong being used as a
weapon). Also of note is the score by J. Peter Robinson, which
attempts to elevate a scene of burning KISS tickets to the level of
unspeakable tragedy.  This is by far Rifkin's most masterful
directorial work to date. He crafts what could be limp material for
maximum laugh power. The tone of the pre-credits sequence reminds me
of the Drew Barrymore opening in SCREAM. The scene involves the mother
of one of the KISS-loving protagonists, played to perfection by Lynn
Shaye (who was indelibly burned upon my memory in KINGPIN when she
asked Woody Harrelson, "What is it about great sex that makes me have
to crap?"). Home alone at night, she pours herself a drink, lights a
cigarette, and chooses a Carpenter's record to put on and kick back in
her recliner. The atmosphere is tense, but Shaye doesn't get attacked
by a slasher - instead she's attacked by the quasi-outrageous rock 'n
roll of KISS, whose record apparently was hidden inside the
Carpenters' sleeve.  Shaye's character is the primary villain of the
piece, destroying the kids' tickets and dogging their quest every step
of the way, even leading a Mothers Against the Music of KISS
rally. The satanic threat of KISS seems quaint and silly by today's
standards, so the outrage they cause is almost cute. As a result,
DETROIT ROCK CITY joins SOUTH PARK and SUMMER OF SAM as this summer's
accidentally topical films after the censorial hysteria caused by the
Columbine high school shootings.  The large cast is uniformly
great. Sam Huntington is particularly likeable as Shaye's hapless son,
who is emasculated by being forced to wear brand new K-Mart clothes to
school. There are also small supporting roles for Natasha Lyonne and
Melanie Lynskey (the less famous HEAVENLY CREATURE, but the one
everyone likes the best).</P>
<P>I think part of the reason these characters are likable is the same
reason they're funny: they worship KISS. It's obviously corny and it
gets a lot of laughs on that level, but it's also something that can
be easily related to. I think most interesting people have had
something like KISS at some time in their life. For me it's KISS
label-mates Parliament, for some people it might be a TV show or a
movie star. You can almost join in their very genuine enthusiasm when
they scream and jump up and down and high five each other as they take
an elevator up to a radio station thinking their going to collect KISS
tickets. And you can also laugh knowingly as they go back down
ticketless, their shoulders slumped, the elevator music blaring, "If
you like pina colada…"</P>
<P>This is a really well made movie. I'm a big fan of THE DARK BACKWARD,
and I also really liked MOUSEHUNT (which Rifkin wrote). But I'm still
surprised what a solid movie this is. I think it's the best comedy of
the summer. I can only imagine what a blast it would be if I happened
to have grown up a KISS fan.</P>
