<PRE>America's Sweethearts (2001)

<P>"Word of advice: when you hit formica, stop."</P>
<P>Starring Billy Crystal, John Cusack, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, Stanley Tucci, Alan Arkin,
Christopher Walken. Directed by Joe Roth. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>America's Sweethearts is what happens when satire gets
lazy. We've seen this before, and recently; Scream 3
was plagued by the same demon. It's a twist worthy of
O'Henry when a satire becomes exactly what it's
satirizing. It can also be interesting, as in Mel
Brooks's better films, but in this case it's messy and
dull. The film exhibits not a delicious sense of
irony, but obtuseness.</P>
<P>Pity, because Joe Roth's romantic comedy/would-be
Hollywood spoof hits the exact right note with its
opening sequence, a montage of scenes from films
starring Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison
(Catherine Zeta-Jones), "America's Sweethearts." It's
perfect because, though exagerrated, it bears an
uncanny resemblance to actual movies, tripe like Sweet
November, The Bachelor, etc, etc. The films in the
montage were hits, but now the real-life couple has
undergone a bitter break-up and the fans are
despondent.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, they also have a held-over movie coming
out, a time travel drama cleverly entitled "Time Over
Time." The director (Christopher Walken), an
Oscar-winner, but so eccentric that he purchased the
unabomber's shack and uses it as his editing room, is
holding his work hostage until the press junket, when
he will show it for the first time. It's up to big
shot publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) to get
both Eddie and Gwen to the junket and, when there,
make the press forget about the fact that they haven't
seen the actual movie.</P>
<P>Eddie is now at a phoney-baloney self-help resort
somewhere in the mountains, with mystic guru Alan
Arkin raising his self-esteem by spouting lines like
"life is a cookie." Gwen, who initiated the break-up,
is sulking at home with her sister/slave Kiki (Julia
Roberts), who has lost a lot of weight. What does her
losing weight have to do with the plot? Well, she has
to be thin so that Eddie can fall in love with her.
Duh.</P>
<P>There's good stuff in the first half of America's
Sweethearts, including some good Billy Crystal lines
and unexpectedly sharp jabs at the inner workings of
Hollywood. Then, it becomes some of the sloppiest
big-budget filmmaking I have ever seen. The script is
just all over the map, with a tonal shift
approximately every other scene. The payoff, which
comes when we finally get to see the mystery movie, is
a complete failure, a decent idea that the filmmakers
ruined, making it far less incisive than they
apparently think it is.</P>
<P>At that point, though, the movie isn't terribly
concerned about being incisive. It had long
degenerated into one of the lame romances it was
parodying just 40 minutes earlier, with movie-star
Eddie falling in love with regular-gal Kiki. Think
Notting Hill, only reversed and much less interesting.</P>
<P>I hate movies that gather an amazing cast and then
waste it, intent on giving the audience what they
think it wants to see those A-list actors do. I don't
particularly care whether John and Julia fall for each
other, especially not if the film itself doesn't care.
I was hoping for sharp satire and biting wit, but
America's Sweethearts starts out well and then wimps
out. </P>
