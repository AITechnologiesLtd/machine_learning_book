<PRE>                             PAY IT FORWARD
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     The very idea behind Pay It Forward -- that when someone does an
enormous good deed for you should pay it "forward" to three other,
unsuspecting persons -- requires what is described in the film as "an
extreme act of faith in the goodness of people."</P>
<P>     It's safe to say that your enjoyment of the film is bound by this
same rule.  Dyed-in-the-wool film critics like myself have been down
this road once or twice before, and the enormous leap of faith it takes
to convince oneself that, deep down, even "bad" people are good makes me
want to reach for my DVD of A Clockwork Orange.</P>
<P>     In a nutshell, Pay It Forward essentially gives us a new spin on
the age-old pyramid scheme, this time with an altruistic streak.  The
brainchild of young Trevor McKinney (The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel
Osment), the PIF scheme is hatched when his 7th grade Social Studies
teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) challenges the class to come up
with a plan "to change the world."  While it might have been a good idea
to start by trying to fix up his alcoholic, working-two-jobs,
not-quite-a-hussie-but-almost mom (Helen Hunt), Trevor figures he really
can change the world with his plan.</P>
<P>     Trevor launches Pay It Forward with gusto, helping out a homeless
junkie (James Cavaziel), some kid who keeps getting beat up at school,
and even branching into matchmaking as he tries to set up the
burn-scarred and embittered Mr. Simonet with Trevor's trollop of a
mother.</P>
<P>     It's at this point that we begin to wonder: Is Pay It Forward meant
to be a love story?  Well, no.  Actually, it's a full-blown soap opera,
complete with rank alcoholism, spousal and child abuse, drug addiction,
suicide, homelessness, and everything else you get in the genre except a
murderous evil twin.  As you might expect, the picture is positively
drowning in sentiment, to the point where it gets almost sickening.</P>
<P>     The real driver for all this mushiness is that the film is
extremely talky and, for lack of a better word, preachy.  Moments of
greatness are punctuated by one soliloquy after another.  Sadly, this is
a truly excellent story that is told with exceptionally poor ability. 
Set in Vegas, Pay It Forward could easily have had the power of a film
like its brother-in-setting, Leaving Las Vegas, which utilized the harsh
dichotomy between bright, glitzy lights and the baseness of the human
condition perpetually on display there to drive its message home.  But
it doesn't.  Pay It Forward takes the PG-13 way out and muddles itself
as a film for the entire family to watch, to bond over, and to learn a
thing or two about life.</P>
<P>     To its credit, we do learn that thing or two about life from the
strong moral backbone of Pay It Forward, notably the importance of
taking action instead of just talking about doing something good.  As a
message movie, the film is competent, and indeed it probably will play
well to teen audiences if they can sit through all the blah-blah-blah
chattiness.  But really, is it the best idea to give us the one-two
acting punch of both Jon Bon Jovi and Angie Dickenson to drive the point
home?  Even Spacey and Hunt feel like they're trying karmically to
redeem themselves for the misanthropy on display in (the far superior)
American Beauty and As Good As It Gets.  (For which, of course, each won
an Academy Award, respectively.)</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Pay It Forward will be 2000's take on Forrest Gump. 
Like Gump, Forward is utterly manipulative, a
feel-so-good-you-have-to-cry movie that will divide audiences into two
camps: one that is swept away by the earnestness and emotion of the
story, and one that simply can't stand the sappiness.</P>
<PRE>     For what it's worth, I managed to fall prey to neither side.</PRE>
