<P>     Even though it's being marketed as a romantic comedy, SOMETHING TO 
TALK ABOUT is really concerned with the relationships of two generations 
of fathers and daughters.  This ordinary motion picture doesn't break 
any new ground as it compares and contrasts the interactions between 
Grace (Julia Roberts) and her domineering father, Wyle (Robert Duvall), 
with those of her daughter, Caroline (Hayle Hull), and her husband, 
Eddie (Dennis Quaid).  To add something of a little more interest, 
marital infidelity is thrown into the mix.  This forms the basis for a 
romance by presenting an excuse for Eddie to focus his efforts on 
winning Grace back. </P>
<P>     All this action takes place against the backdrop of a grand prix 
horse jumping contest, the inclusion of which doesn't generate the same 
kind of audience interest that a more glamorous sporting event (like 
figure skating) might.  Most of the horse-related stuff is either 
superfluous, boring, or both.  Equestrians might disagree, but they're 
likely to be in the minority. </P>
<P>     One of the more obvious drawbacks to SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT is 
that lead actress Roberts has lost the sparkle she exhibited in such 
hits as PRETTY WOMAN and SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.  Here, she's flat, 
frequently eclipsed by the fiery, feisty performance of Kyra Sedgewick, 
who plays Grace's sharp-tongued sister, Emma Rae.  Roberts' scenes with 
Quaid sputter when they should sizzle.  There's only one sequence -- an 
inspired dance number -- when these two generate any sparks, and it 
doesn't last nearly long enough. </P>
<P>     The film tries to develop a three-dimensional Grace by exploring 
her relationships with her mother (Gena Rowlands), father, sister, 
daughter, and philandering husband.  The problem is that none of these 
interactions turn out to be particularly interesting.  Dramatically, 
they are tired retreads of similar things done better in other movies.  
At least there are a few funny-to-hilarious moments that save this film 
from being a complete waste of time.   </P>
<P>     Robert Duvall does far from his best job here.  His is basically a 
"mail it in" performance, but, considering the script he's working from, 
it's no wonder.  SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT is weary -- every ounce of 
energy and originality has long since been wrung out of this formula, 
and the "twist" of having the leads already married doesn't do much to 
spice up things.  Ultimately, this "something" turns out to be nothing 
much at all. </P>
