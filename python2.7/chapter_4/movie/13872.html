<P>Susan Granger's review of "RETURN TO PARADISE" (Polygram Pictures)</P>
<P>         This intensely involving drama presents a stunning moral
dilemma. The story begins with three twenty-something American men
cavorting carelessly in sun-drenched Malaysia, enjoying the rum,
girls, and cheap hash. Originally strangers who met while touring
Asia, they've spent a month in paradise, free from responsibilities
and inhibitions. When their vacation ends, two head back to
Manhattan while the third decides to remain inPenang as a "Save the
Orangutans" volunteer. Skip ahead two years - and a lawyer (Anne
Heche) tracks the New Yorkers down. One (Vince Vaughn) is working as
a limousine driver, while the other (David Conrad) is a structural
engineer, engaged to be married. She tells them that their buddy (Jo=
aquin Phoenix) has been in jail for the past two years after their
discarded and forgotten hash was discovered in a trash barrel. Under
Malaysian law, the stash was large enough to qualify him as a drug
dealer, a crime for which there is a mandatory death sentence. All
three are culpable buthe will be executed in eight days unless the
pair return to Malaysia, confess their responsibility, and volunteer
to join him in serving out a stiff prison term. Meanwhile, the media
threatens to break the story, further jeopardizing an already
precarious situation. The crisis-of-consciencetheme is superbly
developed by writers Bruce Robinson & Wesley Strick and realized by
director Joseph Ruben. Anne Heche is the hot-wire here. Her waifish
sensuality sparkles yet she never loses her downright determined
edge. She is a stunning actress. Vince Vaughn and David Conrad wrestle
with cynicism and decency, while Joaquin Phoenix delicately etches
the sensitive idealist. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Return to Paradise" is a powerful, compelling 9, provoking the
question: What would you do in similar circumstances?</P>
