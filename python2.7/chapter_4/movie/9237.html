<PRE>                    THE TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS</PRE>
<P>The most relevant, thoughtful, provocative and timely film so far
this year, TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS will give you something to think
about long after you have left the theater.  Based on a play by
Jonathan Tolin, this wonderful film is at once controversial and
entertaining. . . controversial only because the moviegoer is
forced into asking himself/herself, What should have been done?
There are no easy answers.</P>
<P>Walter Gold (The lovable actor, director, writer Garry Marshall)
and his wife, Phyllis (the equally famous Faye Dunaway) are the
parents of Suzanne (Jennifer Beals) and David (Brendan Fraser).
Although David is gay, his family has long ago made peace with
themselves about his homosexuality; in short, he is their dear son
and they love and accept him and his lifestyle.</P>
<P>The loving family is made further happy with the announcement by
Jennifer and her husband, Rob (Jon Tenney) who is a geneticist,
that Walter and Phyllis Gold will soon be grandparents. After a
series of tests to reveal sex, birth defects, etc. are performed
on the baby, there is good news and bad news.  The good news is
that the baby has no inherited illnesses; the bad news is that the
baby is carrying a gene which is found in 90% of gay men. The
chances are very great that the child, a male, will grow up gay.
As of this writing, there has been no medical breakthrough that
reveals a specific "gay gene."    However, for purposes of the
movie, it fits in perfectly.</P>
<P>What to do?  Do they opt to continue with the pregnancy and have a
child who will suffer the same hurts that David has had to endure
in growing up?  (How about that some of the hurts may have been
caused by the parents until they could "adjust?") Or should they
in the best interests of their potential son (of course!) abort
the pregnancy?</P>
<P>When David learns that there is that problem of the child being
gay and that there is abortion under discussion . . . but by no
means a final decision . . . he is hurt and furious, asking his
parents, "Would you have wanted an abortion if you had known I was
going to be gay?"</P>
<P>This is a "liberal" family but even families that are liberal and
loving find that there are always tough decisions in life . . .
and the Golds are now having the biggest they have ever had to
face.</P>
<P>Among others in the cast are Sean O'Brien, John Schlesinger and
Rosie O'Donnell.</P>
<PRE>A terrific film.</PRE>
