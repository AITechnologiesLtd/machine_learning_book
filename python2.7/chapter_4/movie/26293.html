<P>   What does a 14-year-old think of every other minute of his
day? School?  Ha.  Sports?  Yes, every alternate minute. 
You guessed it.  Sex.  One of the great ironies of our
civilization is that the subject most important to adolescents is
ignored or repressed by their parents, or at least this was
true during the boring ol' 1950s before the old music died to
be replaced by Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" and later
by the more hardened forms of rock music.  Jean
Doumanian, who had produced small, amusing movies in the
recent past such as "Small Time Crooks" and "Sweet and
Lowdown" carries on her interest in the modest things of life
by hooking by with a semi-autobiographical tale by Marshall
Karp ("Everything's Relative") who teams up with Jason
Alexander as the director of "Just Looking."</P>
<P>   This is a diminutive movie that could have barely fit on an
old 19 inch TV tube or on an off-Broadway stage but despite
its attributes appears lost on the big screen.  Nor can too
many adolescents in this everything-goes age relate to the
story unless they consider it camp and get some chuckles out
of the way that a Pleasantville community in Queens, New
York goes about its love and work.  </P>
<P>   Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is at the yarn's center, an
appealing young Jewish kid with the buzz cut common to the
decade who despises his butcher stepfather Polinsky
(Richard V. Licata) so much that he becomes a vegetarian at
the nightly dinner table.  Nor does he go for the edict of his
newly-married mom, Sylvia (Patti LuPone) to send him from
his tenement-style apartment house in the Bronx to the
"country" borough of Queens during his fourteenth summer to
live with his aunt Norma (Ilana Levine) and her Italian-
American husband Phil (Peter Onorati).  Making friends with
John (Joseph Franquinha), he immediately joins John's sex
club, which is dominated by the prescient teen Alice (Amy
Braverman) and her shy but curious friend Barbara (Allie
Spiro-Winn).  Since the girls are Catholic, they insist that they
do not "do it" but boy, do they love to talk about sex.  When
Lenny meets the fetching 20-something Hedy (Gretchen Mol),
he falls for her and devotes the season to trying to discover
her "doing it" with her doctor boy friend, Flynn (John Bolger).</P>
<P>   The best aspect of the film is its fifties ambience, one
which in Jason Alexander's vision is just like the stereotyped
view of the era mined by "Pleasantville."  While performing
sex is just a dream for the teen boys, some of the more
liberated adults such as the lovely Hedy indulge freely
(though in my own view as one who came of age during this
period, one didn't go all the way until marriage).   Ryan
Merriman is the sort of kid that any parent would enjoy: cute,
curious, appealing in every way, willing to work hard,
socialize freely, and absorb the lessons taught to him by his
parents, his relatives, his friends and his love interest.  In
short, "Just Looking" bears looking at if you keep your
expectations narrow and do not expect the screen to be
splashed by the likes of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi in
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</P>
