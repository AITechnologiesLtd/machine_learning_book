<P>PLOT:
Jesse James, his brother Frank and a few of their cousins (better known as the
Younger boys) comprise a gang of outlaws who rob banks, shoot guns and give to
the poor. They don't want people's farms being taken over by greedy railroad
folk and they don't mind killing a few people in their pursuit of that goal. Now
yipee-ka-yay mother...well, something like that.  </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A harmless little movie. This film isn't out to hurt anybody. It stars a bunch
of unknowns, a few up-and-comers, a couple of has-beens and plenty of gunpowder,
and asks that you sit down, relax and not expect much from it. If you go in with
that attitude, you will likely be satisfied. Why? Well, the film offers you a
little bit of fun, a little bit of action and a whole lotta nothing. If you're
not interested in an original story...this might be for you. If you're not
interested in getting attached to characters, caring when they die, smiling when
they live...this might be for you. And if you're not interested in feeling
tension, getting swept up by energy or being surprised by anything that happens
in a movie...well, this might be for you. On the positive tip, the film offers
authenticity, a charismatic lead, a great looking babe, a few funny moments, a
nice camaraderie between the band of outlaws, at least two cool gunfight
sequences and not much thinking required. On the downside, the story is pretty
flimsy, the editing and pacing could not be any faster or less engaging, the
deaths and the ending are wrapped up way too quickly and the dialogue is some of
the worst that I've heard in any movie all year.</P>
<P>But then again, I was laughing through most it because it was so contrived, and
actually enjoying it, despite it being for the wrong reason. Does that count or
make any sense? Anyway, my personal favorite line was when one of the James
brothers started shooting up a train and someone asked Timothy Dalton what all
the noise was, and he snapped back, "Revenge!" Hehehehe...had me cwacking up, I
tell you. Which reminds me, James Bond is friggin' hilarious in this movie. He
seems to be playing a character in another movie altogether, hamming it up at
every turn, and following one of the strangest arcs that I've seen in any
character in quite some time (make up your mind, you bastard!). There are also a
couple of complete throwaway roles given to Kathy Bates (and if you look
closely, you can actually see her "cashing her paycheck" for this movie in one
of the bank scenes...seriously...check it out!), as well as Ronny Cox, who
respectively prove that nobody can deliver this awful dialogue and make it sound
genuine.</P>
<P>But you're not gonna see this movie for the characters and the dialogue anyway,
right? I mean, you're going to see it for the action, the gunfights, maybe even
the T&A, right? (okay, so maybe that last one was just me...there is none, btw).
Well, in that respect, the film does offer a few interesting shootouts, a couple
of nice stunts and dare I say...a charismatic performance from Colin Farrell
(oh, have you heard...this guy's going places!). So once again I find myself
stuck in the middle (copyright 1992 Mr. Blonde) of my recommendation meter. On
the one hand, the film offers a few entertaining moments, including some laughs
and decent gunplay, but on the other hand, the dialogue blows, the supposed
"romance" is bogus and the film moves faster than a speeding bullet (but without
letting you catch up!). I'm sooo confused...! Actually, I'd recommend that you
check it out on video where you might just enjoy it for the fluffy western that
it is.</P>
