<PRE>FLED (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Kevin Hooks
Writer: Preston A. Whitmore II
Starring: Laurence Fishburne, Stephen Baldwin, Will Patton, Salma Hayek,
Robert John Burke, Robert Hooks, Victor Rivers, David Dukes, Brittney
Powell, Bill Belamy, Ru Paul</P>
<P>What's the coolest thing about these little "Free Weekends" of premium
channels like "HBO," "Cinemax," and all those other ones is that you get
to see (usually) uncut films for free that you would never pay more than
a quarter to see.  I watched "Fled" mainly because I knew it wouldn't be
great at all, but might offer some kind of entertainment.  I was sorta
right.</P>
<P>"Fled" is basically your run-of-the-mill cheapo action pic which
features two guys feuding with one another and running from the law and
the mafia (either italian, russian, or cuban - this time it's the
latter), using cliches from films you've seen way before and liked way
better, and ends in the two guys becoming friends at the end after
defeating the main villain, although being belligerent friends.  Yes, I
told you the whole story, but you've seen it before anyway.</P>
<P>What makes "Fled" just a little bit different is that it kind of
embraces the cliches it uses.  Like "Scream" it rips off films, and just
gets off on that, as one of the two protagonists says "Didn't you see
[place film name here]?" after each rip-off.  But, of course, there's no
reason for this other than to be cute and kinda witty, which it is, but
that doesn't mean it's a good film.  But we do get references from "The
Fugitive" to "Deliverance," and even a pretty funny final reference
which is even funnier if you know the filmography of Fishburne.</P>
<P>In fact, the plot of "Fled," at least in the first half hour or so, is
inescapibly reminiscent of the film classic "The Defiant Ones," where
Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier were escaped convicts handcuffed
together.  The two guys in this are, again, black and white, and are
played by the suave Laurence Fishburne (named Piper) and the kinda dorky
but trying to be cool twentieth Baldwin brother, Stephen (named Dodge -
love these names), and are again escaped convicts, but unfortunately are
de-chained about 40 minutes or so in the film, right about the time the
film becomes redundant and boring.</P>
<P>As the film goes on, we learn of conspiracies on top of conspiracies on
top of more conspiracies, as well as some police corruption, and a
couple cops connection to the cuban mafia.  The film tries to unfold in
a cool manner, with twists in the story coming about because all the
truth is witheld at first, but they instead feel cheap instead of great
like they did in, say, "L.A. Confidential" (why am I mentioning this
film in THIS review?!).  For instance: we never know why Dodge is in,
but we find out he's a computer hacker, and he hacked 25 million bucks
from some people who want it back.  Funny: I thought Stephen Baldwin
looked like a hacker too!</P>
<P>In these kinds of films, we have to get the obligatory chicks for each
of these guys, and we do: one who is not really necessary but
interestingly played, and one who is boring but at leasy she's topless. 
Salma Hayek (who reportedly hated doing the nudity in "Desperado") plays
the former, and, as I said, does it pretty well, although she's not
really essential or anything.  And the second one (played by Brittney
Powel) is even less essential, needed just for some nudity.</P>
<P>The film has lots of action sequences, which range from fun to boring
and redundant, as it is a chase movie (yea).  Director Kevin Hooks
("Passenger 57") creates every action scene to be a shock, but I swear
you can smell each one coming 10 minutes away.  There's one of these
every couple minutes, and the final one, which is small compared to all
the others, seems extremely anti-climactic.  They're not very well done
either, never realy garnering any excitement, but occasionally prompting
a snicker.  John Woo Hooks is not.</P>
<P>Fishburne does give a pretty commanding performance though (big shock
there), while Baldwin sinckers occasionally, but never really garners
any likability for his role.  I mean, what's he doing playing a hacker? 
Hayek is pretty okay, while the other chick is boring and pretty un-sexy
for a stripper (another fault: a hacker dating a stripper).  Will Patton
is pretty good though, even though he has way too many horrific lines
("when you spit into the wind...it may come back!" or something like
that).  And we get some distracting cameos from Bill Belamy and Ru Paul,
I guess added for cuteness as well.</P>
<P>Bottom line: "Fled" is semi-entertaining, and won't you to watch it, but
it's too boring to pay to see.  But even if it's for free, you still
have to waste about an hour and a half of your life watching it.</P>
