<PRE>American Pie</PRE>
<P>This movie is pretty much an updating of _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_. If
you haven't seen _Fast Times_, the plot goes something like this: teenagers
think about having and sometimes have sex. Just as today's world is faster
paced than that of the dawn of the 80's, so is _American Pie_ faster than
_Fast Times_. While the latter covers several months time, _American Pie_
covers less than one month. Still, it is a very busy month, packed with
pathetic teenage behavior the likes of which I have never seen. That is the
problem with most teenage movies; the characters are either unbelievably
slick (_10 Things I Hate About You_) or unbelievably pathetic. I can think
of only two movies that have really got it right and been great movies:
_Fast Times_ and _Dazed and Confused_. Still, if you take this movie for
what it is, a pleasant sex comedy with an attractive young cast. I am happy
to report that this movie contains some excellent nudity, although I am sad
to say that it was of the designated nudist type (one actress was singled
out to be naked). Something tells me that the sale of those little video
cameras that hook up to your computer is about to go through the roof. By
the way, while the movie bills itself as having outrageous humor, it falls
short. The movie is generally funny and some scenes are down right
hilarious, but, compared to _There's Something About Mary_, there is nothing
outrageous. Don't let that discourage you. There is plenty of raunchy humor,
just don't expect it to warp your fragile little mind.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Good</PRE>
<P>Ratings go like this: Abominable, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, and
Perfect. As you might guess, most movies are Fair to Good. Very few movies
are either Abominable or Perfect.
