A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Ronnie Yu</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Don Mancini</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Possessed plastic dolls in love, plastic dolls having sex</P>
<P>Starring: Jennifer Tilly, Voice of Brad Dourif, Katherine Heigl, Nick
Stabile, John Ritter</P>
<P>Synopsis:
This is the fourth film in the CHUCKY series, which debuted in the late
1980s. Basically, Chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk
because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer. In BRIDE OF
CHUCKY, Chucky's longtime girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) dies and
her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo. Dolls Tiffany
and Chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in New
Jersey, where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans. The dolls
stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple, so
in the side plot, the couple suspects each other of being a murderer. </P>
<P>Opinion:
BRIDE OF CHUCKY is an attempt at horror with humor, but doesn't succeed.
Somehow, Chucky moaning about mid life crisis, and how he should have
gotten married does not make for a very scary Chucky. And Tiffany
harping about mid life crisis, and how she should have gotten married
does not make for a very scary Tiffany. The suspenseless BRIDE OF CHUCKY
relies mostly on Jennifer Tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the
first half, and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second
half. The best that can be said about BRIDE OF CHUCKY is that it is
sarcastic.</P>
