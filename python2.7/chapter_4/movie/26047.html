<P>   Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") aims to hook us
with his "Bait," but only the hungriest are going to bite. 
Those who do fall prey will find the meal less than fulfilling
but you can bet your last worm that they'll probably go back
for more and more and more in years to come.  Not that
"Bait" lacks entertainment value, if you can't get enough car
crashes, explosions, feats of derring-do and the lure of
intermittent comic touches from a guy who has racked up
heady box-office figures in urban markets.  But ultimately this
"Bait" is, as its title gives away, just another decoy that'll take
you away from more substantial fare in other waters.</P>
<P>   The narrative is motivated by gold, 42 million dollars' worth-
-though I can't imagine how the bandits expect to fence the
bars.  Judging by the fees my dentist charges for a root
canal, I'm sure he could take half the stash, but who's going
to spring for the other 21 mil?  But that's not Fuqua's concern
nor does it distress scripters Andrew Scheinman ("North"), 
Adam Scheinman ("Mickey Blue Eyes") and Tony Gilroy
("Armageddon"), who probably rely on the animators and
editors and photographers and Roberto Fiumano who mans
the Rotoscoper--and oh, yes, Doug Sloan, the horse
wrangler-- to provide eye candy where suspense would be
nicer and a solid rap track including Derrick Fitzgerald's
"Back in Deez Streetz" and Ice Cube's "24 Mo Hours" to cue
us that somethin' is about to go down.</P>
<P>   The opening scene is best, however hackneyed, ironically
cross cutting a robbery of the nation's most secure room
which houses the gold with the attempted burglary of a
couple of buckets of prawns from the kitchen of a Brooklyn
restaurant.  (The prawns have nothing to do with the title of
the movie, but comedian Jamie Foxx can get mighty witty
each time he explains to fellow mobsters and cops alike that
prawns are not the same as shrimp.  In other words, he's a
big-time robber after all.)  When Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx)
is easily captured and imprisoned, he gets a cryptic message
from his heart-challenged, gold-digging cellmate (Robert
Pastorelli)--something about the Bronx Zoo and there's-no-
place-like-home--that makes the successful computer-hacking
bandit at large, Bristol(Doug Hutchison) suspect that Sanders
knows the location of the loot.  Aware that small-time crook
Sanders could be used to capture Bristol--who had
senselessly executed to bound-and-gagged guards at the
Gold Reserve--Sanders is knocked unconscious at the orders
of Treasury Department chief investigator Edgar Clenteen
(David Morse), implanted with a tracking device, and set free. 
Clenteen has no regard for the life of the small-timer, stating
"you know what happens to bait," and since the killer thinks
that Sanders knows something when he actually does not,
Sanders can be in for some deep quandaries.</P>
<P>   "Bait" is part-comic, part romantic-sentimental, and mostly
a plain-ol' cop movie, succeeding best whenever the
generally humorless David Morse is on the screen and least
when Jamie Foxx is using his motormouth demeanor to make
up with his girl friend, Lisa (Kimberly Elise), who had recently
given birth to Sanders' son.  Some clutter is provided by a
subplot involving Sanders' brother Stevie (Mike Epps), who
does some stolen goods trafficking, and whose underworld
work leads Sanders into problems with a couple of idiot
mobsters.</P>
<P>   The Toronto and New York photography by Tobias
Schleissler ("The Guilty") and production design by Peter
Jamison ("Carrie 2") are convincing enough, especially when
complemented by Edward Bell's editing--at its best in an
extended scene at a race track that finds Alvin Sanders
jockeying for position against a field of better contenders. 
Though the movie should ideally be oceanic in suspense, this
pedestrian "Bait" gets no fish out of water.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 118 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
