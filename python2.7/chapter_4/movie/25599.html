<PRE>Hollow Man (2000)</PRE>
<P>This summer offering from director Paul Verhoeven (STARSHIP TROOPERS, 
ROBOCOP) is a science fiction thriller that blends an old story with very 
new special effects.  At its best, HOLLOW MAN highlights all of the unsavory 
implications of invisibility; at its worst, it panders to some of the baser 
requirements of modern movie-goers.</P>
<P>H.G. Wells' novel THE INVISIBLE MAN is invoked continuously in HOLLOW MAN.  
The story is by Gary Scott Thompson, the screenplay by Thompson and Andrew 
W. Marlowe.  But Wellsian influence is what really drives the story.  What 
happens when a scientific genius (in this update it's Sebastian Caine, 
played by Kevin Bacon) creates the means by which to make himself invisible? 
  Caine goes through the whole routine, only what he's after is cracking the 
key to becoming visible again.  When his team of brilliant assistants helps 
him bring back to visibility a large primate (gorilla), Caine volunteers 
himself as the first human to be injected with the top-secret serum that 
will make him unseen.</P>
<P>Thinking back to Wells' story, viewers will remember Claude Rains' character 
going crazy after becoming invisible.  Caine does the same.  In fact, the 
filmmakers add a good deal of foreshadowing to get us to believe Caine is 
capable of doing what he does in the final acts of the story.  One problem 
is that Caine is somewhat of a creep to begin with: he has been jilted by 
his right-hand colleague Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue), and he flashes 
several signs of jealousy when he learns she has another man.  So we don't 
really feel close to Caine at any time.  Here's a paradox – viewers would be 
struck by the tragedy of the grotesque downfall of a man they admired, but 
perhaps for the purposes of modern thrillers, it is better to despise the 
fallen hero from the start.  Of course when Caine discovers the identity of 
Dr. Foster's new lover, he slides even more deeply into a dark envy followed 
by a plummet into psychotic behavior.</P>
<P>Here's the rub.  Watching, I was bothered not so much by my lack of empathy 
for Caine – it is easier, after all, to hate a non-human bogeyman, which the 
insane scientist clearly becomes, by turns ghost-like and grotesque.  What 
struck me was the pattern the story follows: think of any hard-to-kill 
monster from the last twenty years of cinema.  HOLLOW MAN could be traced 
even to one film, Ridley Scott's ALIEN, with Caine as the critter and Shue 
as Ripley.  I'm afraid not even the slick effects can offset the sour taste 
of derivative storyline.</P>
<P>One thing that could have added comic relief to HOLLOW MAN is more harmless 
pranks.  Couldn't Caine have cavorted around out in the world like Rains did 
when he terrorized the townspeople?  Here we witness simple terrorizing and 
worse.  (This does not include little touches on the hair and Caine's moving 
around Foster's can of Coca-Cola.)  The last word is that the film's outlook 
on humanity is bleak: one of the researchers announces early, assuming a 
God-like voice, that the project is doomed, the scientists cursed tampering 
with Creation.</P>
<P>The story does do a nice job of exposing the implications of invisibility, 
though.  The characters on Caine's team display constant paranoia and 
finally, dread.  This invisible fiend even has an advantage over a housefly, 
which cannot see the hand about to squash it.</P>
<P>The coolest aspect of the film is the effects, which receive at least equal 
billing with the human stars.  But here's a question posed by contemporary 
bio-ethicists everywhere: `Just because we can, does that mean we should?'  
Just because effects far-outdistance the reality of the effects of movies 
years ago, it doesn't mean the movies are any better.  Plainly, the film 
relies too heavily on computer-assisted magic.</P>
<P>The acting is as good as the story permits it to be.  Kevin Bacon is one of 
our finest actors, but he should probably talk with Tom Hanks about gaining 
a knack for spotting just the right script.  Bacon is capable of showing 
more humanity than he is allowed to show here.  Caine seems an egomaniacal, 
brooding jerk.  Elisabeth Shue (whose name appears first at film's start, by 
the way) is very capable here, too, though she has to repeat too many times 
that there were reasons she broke up with Caine – what they are is a 
mystery, however.</P>
<P>In the theater I was reminded that American viewers get what they want.  No 
lecture here, but for my tastes, HOLLOW MAN shows too much violence, and 
even exhibits partially nude women being abused by Caine.  Sure, the ending 
is pleasing if typical, but ultimately it's the kind of film that does not 
make you feel very good over spending the time to watch it.</P>
