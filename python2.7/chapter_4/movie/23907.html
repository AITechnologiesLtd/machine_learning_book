<P>_Ready_to_Rumble_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>Professional wrestling has long suffered the criticism that it caters to
the most lowbrow audience with its barely organized displays of violence.
 But as low as wrestling goes, rarely does it plunge to the crass depths
explored by the wrestling-themed comedy _Ready_to_Rumble_, which goes out
of its way to prove that tastelessness does not equal comic inspiration.</P>
<P>To their credit, writer Steven Brill and director Brian Robbins satisfy
their crudest instincts in the film's early stages, which concerns
fanatical World Championship Wrestling (as opposed to World Wrestling
Federation) fans Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean's (Scott Caan) search
for their hero, dethroned and disgraced wrestling champion Jimmy King
(Oliver Platt).  Gordie and Sean work in sanitation--namely, the cleaning
of portapotties--so leave it to Brill and Robbins to not leave any raw
sewage joke uncovered.  They even go the extra mile, venturing beyond
mere jokes about excrement and flatulence into the territory of crab
lice.  Prefer cheap slapstick over bodily function humor?  Worry you
not--the film's opening "match" set in a convenience store is but the
first in a very long line of brutal fights unsuccessfully played for
laughs.</P>
<P>_Ready_to_Rumble_ is rated PG-13, and it provides ample ammunition for
the argument that the MPAA ratings board is extremely lenient when it
comes to violence.  Very little blood is shed in _Rumble_, but many
severe beatings are suffered by a number of characters, including a
"Nitro Girl" cheerleader named Sasha (Rose McGowan) at the hands of her
"boyfriend" Gordie.  While there is no doubt as to the less-than-serious
intent, there is nothing particularly cartoonish about the execution:
those are real kicks and punches being thrown, and genuine body slams and
other wrestling maneuvers being performed.  While being inundated with so
much brutality for such a long while, it's impossible to stop lightly
giggling (which is the most any of the mayhem will induce) and start
cringing.</P>
<P>While such poor content makes it mighty tempting to walk out of the
auditorium and never return, I remained curiously fascinated for a couple
of reasons.  First, the film is so audacious in its stupidity I had a
masochistic urge to see just how low it would go.  Second, I was taken
aback by the actors, who displayed some admirable conviction in their
work--a fact made more admirable by the questionable nature of their
material.  Gordie and Sean do find "the King" and help him mount a
comeback, and the uphill struggle back to glory is given some
surprising--and wholly undeserved--resonance by Platt.  And though
they're called on to do nothing more than play obnoxious jackasses for
the entire run time, there's also no question that Arquette and Caan
succeed in fulfilling that requirement.</P>
<P>In the world of professional wrestling, the World Championship Wrestling
organization is widely regarded as being a bit more tasteful and--dare I
say it--classy than its raunchier (and more popular) rival, the World
Wrestling Federation.  I guess the WCW higher-ups figures that if they
can't beat 'em, join 'em, for the big screen commercial that is
_Ready_to_Rumble_ just proves that the WCW can sink to the same lows in
taste, albeit in a more spectacular, big-screen fashion.</P>
