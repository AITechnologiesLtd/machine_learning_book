<P>It's ironic that I watched this Warren Beatty political comedy just when the
rumors of the actor actually running for the Democratic nomination for
President in the year 2000 are beating about.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A suicidal political candidate decides to hire someone to assassinate him a
few days before his election race ends, and takes his knowledge of this
fact, to tell people exactly what's on his mind, no matter how crude or out
of line it may be. He also seems to take on an African-American spirit, and
surprising to everyone, including himself, people actually begin to respect
his newfound honesty.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An okay movie with plenty of insightful commentary on the state of American
politics today, the plight of the poor and African-Americans in today's
society, and all the unwritten political rules that we should all be aware
of by now. Having said that, I thought that only some of the scenes in this
film were genuinely funny, I did NOT appreciate the "rap character" that
Bulworth's persona would take on from time to time (It just didn't feel
right to me), and thought there was just too much focus on only one aspect
of American political injustice (i.e. Is Compton the biggest issue out
there?). Beatty and surprisingly, Berry, pulled in some neat performances,
and the soundtrack was pretty cool, but I thought that the film just
oscillated between too many genres, comedy, drama, romance, political, to
satisfy any one completely. On a high note, Oliver Platt delivered one of
his best performances ever, with a great rendition of the ultimate sleazy,
hypocritical sidekick who changes his opinion on anything in a second, as
long as it pleases the populace. All in all, a thoroughly original script,
performed with some good actors, but Beatty's unbelievable "rap character"
and the somewhat unfocused direction of the script, left me somewhat
detached.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Plenty of cameos in this film: George Hamilton, who is mentioned in the
script as someone that Bulworth resembles, Jan Carl from Entertainment
Tonight, talk show host Larry King, playing himself as usual, out-of-work
actor, William Baldwin, as Bulworth's opponent in the race, and director
Paul Mazursky.
Look for the movie marquee in one of the black neighborhoods that shows a
double-bill of SUPERFLY and BLACULA.
Actress Halle Berry was the first runner-up in the 1986 Miss USA pageant.
She was also named Miss Ohio in 1986, and Miss Teen All American in 1985.
She was married to baseball player David Justice for about three years.
Oliver Platt's dad, Nicholas Platt, is an ex-ambassador to Pakistan, Zambia,
& the Phillipines. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major
in Drama in 1983 from Tufts University.</P>
