<P>WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
Warner Bros. / 1:26 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, sexual/crude humor, comic 
violence)
Cast: Leslie Nielsen; Richard Crenna; Kelly Le Brock; Melinda McGraw; 
Michael York; Aaron Pearl; Sandra Bernhard 
Director: Pat Proft 
Screenplay: Pat Proft<HR>There are those of us who think of Leslie Nielsen as the bumbling, 
hapless straight man from the hysterical "Naked Gun" films, crack an 
immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's 
committed himself to starring in since. The wavering movie spoofs, 
however, are less forgivable. To be fair, "Wrongfully Accused," the 
send-up in question and Nielsen's third parody since the last "Gun," 
isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his "Dracula: Dead and Loving 
It" or "Spy Hard," which is a mighty good thing. Nielsen is still in 
tip-top comedic form, able as ever to deadpan his way through even the 
most horrible puns, but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his 
talents instead of relying on them, and he needs one very soon. </P>
<P>"Wrongfully Accused" meshes together the premises of "The Fugitive" and 
"Patriot Games," casting its always game star as Ryan Harrison (get 
it?), a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married 
temptress (Kelly Le Brock). She, however, sets Harrison up to take the 
rap for the murder of her husband (Michael York) - a crime actually 
committed by a one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed man (Aaron Pearl). 
Harrison is arrested, found guilty and sentenced to death, but escapes 
from a prison bus, of course, and then is pursued by a determined U.S. 
marshal named Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna, unnecessarily riffing off of 
Tommy Lee Jones' already smirky Oscar-winning role). There's also a 
mystery brunette (Melinda McGraw) and an assassination subplot involving 
the U.N. Secretary General, but like any of it matters. </P>
<P>"Wrongfully Accused" gets off to an assured start, with an in-concert 
Nielsen, touted "Lord of the Violin" by bare-chested posters, pulling a 
Jimi Hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh 
in front of the stage. Nice touch. Most of the scenes that follow, 
however, never top the opener. (Hysterical exceptions: the Mentos and 
"Baywatch" goofs.) Movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal 
rate, but most are empty. When a giant snake lunges onto the screen and 
snatches a cast member a la "Anaconda" or baseball players disappear 
into a "Field of Dreams"-esque cornfield, there's really nothing to 
laugh at. Other moments, like an interlude in a fishing shop, are so 
unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at. </P>
<P>There seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here, so 
it's possible that director/writer Pat Proft, by bombarding the viewer 
with a careless mixture of the two, guarantees something is sure to 
stick. And what does stick sticks well, particularly the jabs at genre 
conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue, what 
those "Naked Gun"s (which Proft collaborated on) did great; these bits 
are so on-target that they allow you to remember "Wrongfully Accused" as 
an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure. The 
movie might have been cursed to begin with, opening fast on the heels of 
"Mafia!", from Proft colleague Jim Abrahams, and "BASEketball," from 
Proft colleague David Zucker, but it's a strong possibility that nobody 
is going to be accusing "Wrongfully Accused" of being Nielsen's 
funniest.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
