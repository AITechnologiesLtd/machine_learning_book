<P>   There's a popular belief that America's psychos hang out in
big cities where they can hide their craziness amid millions of
people who seem not to notice anything, while pleasantly
eccentric people inhabit the cute little towns and villages of
the country--especially those in the south.  For all his
reputation as a non-conformist, long-time director Robert
Altman is not one to challenge this homespun conviction.  In
his considerable output, he has shown us the craziness of big
cities in "The Player," a black comedy featuring a paranoid
young movie executive (played by Tim Robbins) who is
threatened by a disgruntled screenwriter--until he takes the
law into his own hands.  This biting examination of greed and
power in a cosmopolitan ambiance was countered by his
magnum opus, "Nashville," vignettes of twenty-four people
who are in involved in a political rally in the country-music
capital of the world--far from Tinseltown's variety of wheeling
and dealing.</P>
<P>   With his latest work, "Cookie's Fortune," the director
appears to be pulling inward, affording us an entertaining but
only mildly amusing comedy of the sort that playwright Beth
Henley made famous with her greater flamboyance.  Here,
Altman focuses on neither a megalopolis nor a noted
southern city but rather on a fairly nondescript town of Holly
Spring, Mississippi, territory upon which the armies of North
and South marched almost a century and half back but
otherwise just a convenient spot to work out a comedy of
manners from Anne Rapp's insular screenplay.  A movie
which could be taken as a fantasy by Northern Americans on
what the rural south must still be like, "Cookie's Fortune" can
be decoded as a gentle spoof on the zaniness that the rest of
us think exists down there, particularly if the rest of us have
read too much Tennessee Williams.</P>
<P>   Altman typically trots out a variety of characters, each
unique, so that the viewer could not possibly go away form
one of his works confusing one with another.  In "Cookie's
Fortune," the central focus is on Camille Dixon (Glenn Close),
a combination of Tennessee Williams' Blanche Dubois and
Alexandra Del Lago--a grande dame who appears to live in
the antebellum days of gentleman callers and the unequivocal
need to keep up appearances.  Her younger sister, Cora
Duvall (Julianne Moore), lives across town and, often
appearing slow and lacking confidence, she bends to the will
of her older sibling.  Emma Duvall (Liv Tyler), who is
allegedly Cora's 18-year-old daughter, is the favorite relative
of the bizarre title character, Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal),
who has lived alone in a well-appointed house since the
death some years back of her gun-collecting husband, Buck. 
But the aging Cookie reserves the major part of her affection
for the town's most benevolent resident, Willis Richland
(Charles S. Dutton), who frequently pilfers bottles of Wild
Turkey bourbon from the local bar only to return the bottles
secretly, new and filled, when he is able to buy them.  Willis,
whose love for catfish enchiladas competes with his passion
for the bottle, looks out for Cookie's welfare and is particularly
concerned when the old lady appears to be "losing it."</P>
<P>   Altman, who was born and brought up in Missouri, has an
obvious affection for his characters and if he confers
idiosyncratic behaviors on them, he does so only to set each
apart from the others as an archetype of a disappearing way
of life in America.  Lacking untoward animosity toward
anyone, he casts most of his barbs against the pretentious
Camille, who is so intent on upholding the honor of her family
that when she finds her aunt Cookie lying dead on her bed
from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, she takes steps to cover
up the transgression.  Informing her sister Cora only crazies 
commit suicide, certainly no one in her family, she eats the
suicide note, makes the death appear to be the result of a
robbery, and causes more trouble than she imagined when
Willis is arrested for the crime, detained, and questioned by
both the town's only lawyer Jack Palmer (Donald Moffat) and
an ambitious investigator, Otis Tucker (Courtney B. Vance).</P>
<P>   Altman declines as usual to focus the camera for long
periods on one character or scene. We are made privy to a
the down-home jailhouse cell which presents defendant, his
good friend, his arresting officer, and his lawyer competing
together in a game of scrabble.  Our attention then shifts to a
quick roll in the hay between young Emma Duvall and Jason
Brown (Chris O'Donnell), a sheriff whose prowess in the sack
is undoubtedly more graceful than his bumbling conduct as a
police officer.  </P>
<P>   Glenn Close plays well according to type as a domineering,
garish patrician who directs the church play "Salome" with the
same imperious spirit with which she dictates to her younger
sister.  Charles Dutton is the real catch as the friendly, wholly
unpretentious citizen who asks little more of life than a bottle
of bourbon, a plate of catfish, and the company of some of
the good people of the whimsical town.  The story cries out,
however, for the off-the-wall zaniness of Beth Henley's
comedy "The Miss Firecracker Contest," likewise a Southern
Gothic but with broader humor, more suspense and conflict,
and much larger-than-life characters.</P>
