<P>The Long Kiss Goodnight
Directed by Geena Davis' husband.  Starring Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.
Cameo by Larry King. Reviewed by Michael A. Turton.  Dissed by everybody.</P>
<P>In the tradition of _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes_, sailing the course set
by _Cutthroat Island_, comes _The Long Kiss Goodnight_, a movie so bad it is
absolutely enjoyable. Laugh yourself silly over this disaster which scores a
perfect "0" in every category -- plot, acting, directing, editing, you name
it, all bad.  Of course, if you take movies at all seriously, you may not
like this bomb.</P>
<P>The idea (I won't use the word 'story') behind TLKG is that a plain
schoolteacher and single mother named Samantha Caine, who is suffering from
amnesia, is really a government assassin who is suffering an episode of
madness, hiding inside a fake identity, apparently to escape the burdens of
killing.  A (hugely predictable) car accident and a smack on the head bring
forth the old identity.  As Samantha Caine goes in search of her past in the
company of a private detective she has employed, Mitch (Samuel L. Jackson)
she happens to resurface just when her (unnamed) old agency is staging a fake
terrorist attack on the town of Niagara Falls (code named Operation
Honeymoon) to drum up support for funding in Congress.        The result is a
blizzard of ever more impossible and incredible events until the mind reaches
a state wherein the critical faculty ceases to operate in a serious mode and
laughter is the only possible response.</P>
<P>How to sum up TLKG in a single sentence? Suffice to say: in what other flick
can you hear the phrase "blithering idiot" uttered with complete earnestness?
I can't say when the last time was I enjoyed a movie so much.  There were
places where I laughed myself to tears.</P>
<P>Foremost among the movie's galaxy of failure is the acting.  Except for a
strong performance from the newcomer playing the urbanely psychotic Timothy
and Samuel L. Jackson, whose emotional outbursts seem like the flailing of a
man drowning in quicksand, everyone in TLKG has clearly studied at the Wooden
Indian Academy of Self-Expression.  The smirking, leaden delivery of Geena
Davis would drive Trek's Data mad with envy.  The professor who trained her
is a gem of bad acting working with an awful script, a cornucopia of pompous
nonsense poured out at lightspeed.</P>
<P>Plot and script meanwhile are a miracle of self-conscious silliness.  Bad
line follows bad line in orderly procession as though saved up for the
occasion (although here and there a good line pops out like a struggling hand
poking through the surface of a swamp).  The plot is a crystalline derivative
of everything that is objectionable about Hollywood, including the obligatory
self-sacrificing former jailbird who sustains serious injury in saving Our
Hero, the daughter who begs mom not to give up, the urbane psycho, the
nervous government officials in a rogue agency, the nice but stupid boyfriend
as well as the mandatory guns with endless ammo and characters who perform
superhuman feats of strength with various parts of the body out of
commission. Of course, it takes place at Christmas.  Of course nobody dies at
the end and all families are reconstituted.  Of course there is only one
black man, who is of course a former jailbird and divorced.  Being a
Minority, he of course is endowed with Primitive Wisdom which enables
Samantha to recognize her True self.</P>
<P>As if cliches weren't bad enough, implausibilities and continuity failures
abound.  How does a woman with no past get hired as a schoolteacher? What
happened to the man who was trapped in the burning car when Samantha has her
accident? Why do the government agents choose to make a hit on Samantha by
using automatic weapons in the middle of a crowded train station?  How did
Samantha and Mitch get out of the phone company after taking everyone there
hostage? Where are they at the end?  I could go on in this vein, but I'm sure
the reader gets the picture.</P>
<P>The directing and editing are in no way inferior to the acting, plot and
script.  Characters constantly undergo dimensional shift as they reposition
themselves in badly-edited shots.  Some shots are visually incomprehensible,
especially the scene of Samantha lying in the snow with the dead deer.        The
action in this movie must be seen to not be believed. My personal favorite:
while sitting in a chair, Mitch is blown out of a second-story window in an
explosion, blown through a neon sign, lands in a tree, falls into a snowbank,
and gets up immediately to throw a knife through an attacker's throat.        All
in a day's work for our hero.</P>
<P>There's no question that this could have been a great movie.  Under another
director's tutelage Davis might actually have been able to pull off an action
hero, but she lacks real bite.        Her sluttishness is an obvious act, her
menace comes off as mere irritation.  The potentially compelling conflict
between her submerged identity and her assumed one could have been
interesting, but comes off as cliched.        The fake terrorist attack was a
tactic contemplated to undermine Castro in the '60s, but there is no link
here to real government policies, so the government agents are purely stick
figures.  One yearns for the energy and dark genius of a Tim Burton.</P>
<P>The most fascinating question is: what idiot funded this clunker?  I suppose
"profound lack of judgement" must have become a job requirement for suits
these days.  0 out of 5: don't see, don't rent, don't even watch the trailer.</P>
