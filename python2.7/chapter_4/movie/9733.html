<PRE>THE WINGS OF THE DOVE</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ***1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Miramax / 1:41 / 1997 / R (sex, brief nudity, adult themes)
Cast: Helena Bonham Carter; Linus Roache; Alison Elliott; Charlotte Rampling; 
Elizabeth McGovern; Michael Gambon; Alex Jennings 
Director: Iain Softley 
Screenplay: Hossein Amini </P>
<P>Fast on the heels of October's "Washington Square" comes "The Wings of the 
Dove," another Henry James-based tale that glamorously showcases the 19th- 
and 20th-century author's brilliance in creating robust characters. "Square" 
and "Dove" are James' second and third adaptations to hit theaters in less 
than a year -- couple last December's opulent but uneven "The Portrait of a 
Lady" with these two dazzlers and you've got enough arty appeal to crown 
James as *the* dead literary author of the moment. (He takes the crown from 
Jane Austen, as 1995 through 1996 saw the hot streak of "Persuasion," 
"Clueless," "Sense and Sensibility" and "Emma.") </P>
<P>In bringing "Wings" to a contemporary screen, director Iain Softley and 
screenwriter Hossein Amine have changed a few details, like pushing the 
story's setting ahead a decade into 1910. But the film still boasts an 
anti-heroine for its lead role, spirited free-thinker Kate Croy (Helena 
Bonham Carter). Following the death of her mother, Kate moves in with her 
financially loaded Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling) and is quickly inducted 
into the upper rungs of high London society. But Kate is lustily involved 
with journalist Merton Densher ("Preist"'s Linus Roache), a commoner who 
doesn't comply with her aunt's elitist ideals. Kate wants to be with Merton, 
but requires the wealth of Maude's upscale offerings to care for her 
impoverished father. </P>
<P>Into this complicated picture comes American heiress Millie Theale (Alison 
Elliott), who fast becomes close friends with Kate and even accompanies her 
and Merton on a trip to Venice. But under Kate's civil exterior lies a 
diabolical scheme -- upon learning that Millie is stricken with an eventually 
terminal disease, Kate leads her to believe a relationship with Merton is 
possible. He'll seduce her, she'll die and leave her fortune to him. Millie's 
money will be able to solve all of Kate's problems, but the plan comes with a 
high price. </P>
<P>The narrative employs most of Henry James' usual focuses (wealth, social 
status, etc.), so anyone familiar with his literature or films or melodrama 
in general will probably be able to anticipate "The Wings of the Dove"'s 
downer of an outcome. The predictably tragic story arc, however, is 
overshadowed by superb technical credits. The production design and 
cinematography are tops. Director of photography Eduardo Serra's camera 
captures palazzos and gondolas in all of their old-time extravagance, and the 
steamy, rain-soaked clinches between Kate and Merton will induce swooning 
among more romantic audience members. </P>
<P>"The Wings of the Dove"'s cast and characters are its two most laudable 
assets. Carter, Roache and Elliott are never cheap enough to do one-note 
riffs on any of Amine's strongly-scripted roles. Period piece veteran Carter 
("A Room With a View," "Howards End" and the Mel Gibson "Hamlet") plays Kate 
as both a manipulative and sympathetic force -- it's a difficult combination 
to bring to an already-difficult part, but she aces it. The other two leads 
aren't quite what they seem either; Roache's Merton is smarter and more 
passionate than his hesitant, easily-influenced guise, and Millie is far from 
brittle -- she's nobody's victim. As played by the feisty Elliott ("The 
Spitfire Grill"), the latter is also a sunny scene-stealer. </P>
<P>Director Jane Campion infused her Portrait of a Lady with surreal ostentation 
that occasionally doused its potency. Softley ("Hackers" and "Backbeat") 
renders "The Wings of the Dove" in a much more straightforward manner -- 
delivering his best film yet -- and although it's not as polished as 
"Washington Square," it's still beautiful and moving. And perhaps it's no 
coincidence that "Wings" and "Washington" are playing simultaneously -- 
they'd be quite a lovely afternoon double bill, and make one look forward to 
James' next screen venture with dizzy anticipation. </P>
