<P>     This over-praised ensemble drama that thinks it's an epic, set in
the skin flick industry of late seventies L.A., ostensibly stars Mark
Wahlberg (TRAVELLER, FEAR) as a troubled teen whose "natural endowment"
attracts the attention of a renowned pornographer and, soon enough, has
him plunging little-headfirst into the increasingly intoxicating world
of sex, drugs, and disco.  No, it's not the year's best movie-- not by a
13-inch long shot-- but it *is* frank, funny, and surprisingly poignant.
(And, at times, quite exciting, with several exceptionally energized
sequences, such as an explosive cocaine heist that happens late in the
film.) The big dick problem of BOOGIE NIGHTS is an abruptly unfocused
narrative, signaled in the second hour by an out-of-the-blue turn by
Wahlberg's character.  After he throws a hissy fit, we wander about for
a good hour, never sure of which character we're following or why.
Things *do* improve in the final reel, however, when writer/director
Paul Thomas Anderson (HARD EIGHT) scares several of the characters
straight with three separate (and shocking) instances of violence.
Still, with so many other accomplishments all under one roof-- camera
work, set design, soundtrack, etc.-- this has gotta be an easy movie to
overrate.  BTW, how many of those TOUCH OF EVIL takes did P.T. pull off,
anyway?  With Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Don
Cheadle, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, and, in one of his best roles in
years, Burt Reynolds.</P>
