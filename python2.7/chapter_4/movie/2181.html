<P>Perhaps the clearest evidence of the dearth of original ideas in 
Hollywood is the constant need to regurgitate old, worn-out television 
series.  While there is an occasional exception to this rule (STAR TREK 
being an illustration), the endless plundering of old programs is proof 
that it's easier to rely on something tried-but-true than to attempt 
something new.  THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, following in the wake of the 
unfortunate revival of THE ADDAMS FAMILY, is an example of something that 
should have stayed in re-runs.</P>
<P>When Jed Clampett (Jim Varney) discovers oil on his Arkansas property, he 
becomes a very rich man.  Wanting to make his daughter Elly May (Erika 
Eleniak) into a "sophisticated woman", he decides to move the clan to 
Beverly Hills.  There, in a place filled with strange and unusual 
customs, he is greeted by the fawning bank manager in charge of his 
billion dollars (Dabney Coleman) and the assistant manager, Miss Hathaway 
(Lily Tomlin).  When Jed expresses a desire to re-marry, everyone gets 
involved in the matchmaking, but the woman who emerges as the leading 
candidate to be the next Mrs. Clampett is actually a scheming fortune-
hunter (Lea Thompson).</P>
<P>Those who loved the television series (which served as light comedy, at 
best) will probably be pleased by the motion picture, which stays rigidly 
faithful to the spirit of its predecessor.  This is a farce, pure and 
simple, with all the depth and intelligence (or lack thereof) that marked 
TV's THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.  In fact, the most clever moment of the 
movie comes when Miss Hathaway, searching for a private investigator, is 
sent to the offices of Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebson).  Ebson, as many 
viewers will doubtless recall, was responsible not only for creating the 
role of Jones, but also portrayed the original Jed Clampett.</P>
<P>Those sitting through this film will experience a few guffaws and 
chuckles, but much of the humor is surprisingly unfunny.  There's some 
serviceable slapstick, and a couple of amusing moments made possible by 
the country-meets-city mentality (such as the Clampetts mistaking obscene 
hand gestures for a "Californy greeting"), but these pretty much vanish 
by the end of the first thirty minutes.  After that, it's a long and 
uninspired wait for the end-credits (which are shown over various out-
takes and "bloopers").  </P>
<P>The producers of THE FUGITIVE knew what they were doing when they 
accomplished their TV-to-movie transformation:  give the audience 
something fresh.  The idea worked, as proven by generally-favorable 
reviews and a high box-office gross.  THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES disdains 
this method, however, and suffers greatly because of it.  If I want to 
see ninety minutes of the television series, I'll sit at home and watch 
three back-to-back episodes.</P>
<P>While the storyline may be dull, and the jokes lacking in humor, at least 
the casting is on-the-money.  None of the performances are examples of 
great acting, but for the movie that they've been placed in, the actors 
are perfect.  Jim Varney is no Buddy Ebson, but he gives the new Jed 
Clampett a certain air of dignity not expected from a guy who's most 
famous line is "Hey Vern!"  Erika Eleniak, although probably cast for 
attributes other than her acting skill, gives a decent (and somewhat 
airheaded) rendition of Elly May.  Cloris Leachman is perfect as Granny.  </P>
<P>I was among those unimpressed by director Penelope Spheeris' previous 
effort, the overly-smug WAYNE'S WORLD (another television-derivative).  
This time, however, the few sparks of originality shown there are mostly 
absent.  Most of the attempts at irreverent parody ring false.</P>
<P>My advice is to wait and see this version of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES the 
same way that you've seen all that's gone before - on the small screen.  
And let's hope that when the closing song chimes in with the familiar 
"Y'all come back now, hear?", it's not a reference to a sequel.  </P>
