<PRE>PARANOYING</PRE>
<PRE>ARLINGTON ROAD
Directed by Mark Pellington
Screenplay by Ehren Kruger
With Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins
UA South     R    117 min.</PRE>
<P>     Whether or not "Arlington Road" slips in beneath your tolerance
radar screen depends on a variety of factors -- how much you like
improbable action/adventure, how much of a stickler you are for
plausibility, how much coincidence you can stand, how much umbrage you
take at having your intelligence insulted, that sort of thing.  On the
plus side, it's pretty well-acted, with some good fast-paced suspense
sequences.  On the minus side, it's a ridiculous, sloppy piece of
junk.</P>
<P>The movie was ready for release last year but was held off
because of public sensitivity about the very similar Oklahoma City
bombing, and then derailed again earlier this year by the Columbine
shootings.  It finally saw a window of opportunity between spasms of
American violence and got its opening.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a widower teaching a course
about terrorism at a Washington university.  He doesn't seem to have
any other classes, or much else to do besides cope with his withdrawn
son (Spencer Treat Clark) and girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis), and
brood in his dark house about his deceased wife, an FBI agent who was
killed in a botched Ruby Ridge-type raid.  Until, that is, he meets
the neighbors.  Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack)
are what God had in mind when He created the Midwest.  But Michael,
with precious little to go on beyond Oliver's pudding face and
porridge-bowl haircut, begins to suspect that his Ozzie-and-Harriet
neighbors are really Mr. and Mrs. Tim McVeigh.  He can't convince
anybody -- not Brooke (who leaves the room every time he mentions his
late wife), not his wife's old FBI colleague (Robert Gossett).</P>
<P>A premise of the movie is that Americans would rather feel safe
than get to the bottom of things, and once we've arrested somebody in
a terrorist case we don't even want to think about far-reaching
conspiracies.  The core idea on which this exercise in paranoia is
constructed is an intriguing one, but so much of Ehren Kruger's
screenplay turns on the most far-fetched coincidences and
improbabilities that it stumbles over itself like a drunk in an
earthquake.  It's the kind of movie you come out of with a laundry
list of protests, and then keep thinking of more on the way home.  It
fails Alfred Hitchcock's cheese sandwich test -- if a thriller is
successful, you won't think about its holes until you've had time to
get home and are making a cheese sandwich.</P>
<P>The ending toward which the movie drives us (with depressing
literalness) is a nice twist, but getting there isn't much fun, and
again we're asked to swallow plot devices that require people to act
unerringly in very specific and highly unlikely ways.  If my plan for
blowing up a federal building depended on such unpredictable behavior,
I doubt I could get any respectable terrorist organization this side
of the Mississippi to back it.</P>
<P>Bridges and Robbins are good, but show-stealing honors go to the
wonderful Joan Cusack, whose smile will never strike you as quite so
innocent and goofy again.</P>
