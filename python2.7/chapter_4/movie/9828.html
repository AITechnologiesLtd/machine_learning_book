<PRE>THE JACKAL (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Jackal is the longest two hours I've spent in a theatre in recent
memory. I'm not sure what to call this movie. It could be a thriller, but
it doesn't thrill. It could be an action film, but there's not enough action.</P>
<P>The Jackal is an assassin that nobody can identify. As one FBI agent
reports, they don't even know if The Jackal really exists. The movie
follows two stories in parallel; one follows a group of good guys who are
trying to protect a government official against The Jackal. On this team is
the Deputy Director of the FBI, Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier), Major
Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora), and an IRA sharpshooter Declan Mulqueen
(Richard Gere). It is this story line is the one that is lacking and slows
the movie to a grinding halt. The other story line follows The Jackal
himself. This is the more interesting story line, and like in Heat, this
story line made me cheer for the bad guy more than I did for the good guys.
Bruce Willis seems to be having a great deal of fun portraying a bad guy.
And though his character is the master of disguise, no matter what disguise
Willis dons, he's still Bruce Willis. That's OK though, this part of the
film was fun.</P>
<P>The Jackal, next to being a master of disguise, is a man of gadgets. He's a
high-tech guy who uses the Internet to conduct illegal business, he uses a
cell phone, and his high-tech weapon is remote controlled from his
notebook. With all of this under his belt though, The Jackal did some
pretty stupid things during the film. I won't spoil it, but the character
of The Jackal conflicted with itself.</P>
<P>Chuck Pfarrer (Hard Target) who scripted this version of the 1973 The Day
of The Jackal builds up the story slowly and the pay-off is just not there.
The script is too predictable. I sat through the film mentally predicted
what would happen next, and not to my surprise, I was always right. The
script also takes huge skips in logic and the pace of the film gives the
audience too much time to find these skips of logic.</P>
<P>The action in the film, whatever there was, was flat and bland. The part
that I loved and made me chuckle, though wasn't supposed to, was during an
action sequence where Gere's Mulqueen is forced to hug a light post, he
sure does grimace well. At least with Pfarrer's Hard Target script there
was John Woo at the helm and the action was enough to pull that film out of
the hole (it had two things going against it, one was the weak script and
the second was Jean-Claude Van Damme). In The Jackal though Michael
Canton-Jones is unable to find anyway of pulling this film out of the hole.</P>
<P>Not everything is bad; there are some good things about this film. First
off, Willis is a joy to watch. Many people wonder why people -- like myself
-- like this guy, I think it's just because he is fun to watch, especially
during this film. The second thing I liked was the opening credits with its
SE7EN-like title sequence and music. Poitier does a great job with his part
and is the only person on the good guys' team that is likeable.</P>
<P>The Jackal is a slow moving predictable film that doesn't have the pay-off
to have an audience wade through its two hours. Though Willis is very
enjoyable, his story is only half of the film and the other half of the
film you'll just be saying to yourself, "Get back to The Jackal, these guys
are boring." Skip The Jackal, it's not worth the two hours spent in the
theatre.</P>
