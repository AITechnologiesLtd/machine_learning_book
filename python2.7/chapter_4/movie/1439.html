<PRE>                            A STRANGER AMONG US
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Yes, it's pretty much what the
     television ads make it look like.  Melanie Griffith stars in
     a plot not unlike that of WITNESS, but with Hasidic Jews.  Of
     course, it is not often we see the Hasidic community in film.
     And Sidney Lumet keeps the film consistently intriguing and
     often on a philosophical level.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     At first look A STRANGER AMONG US looks a trifle too formulaic to be a
Sydney Lumet film.  Lumet's films are usually hard-hitting and very
original.  Just a few of his films are TWELVE ANGRY MEN; FAIL SAFE; the
superb, intense film THE PAWNBROKER; THE ANDERSON TAPES; MURDER ON THE
ORIENT EXPRESS; DOG DAY AFTERNOON; and NETWORK.  This does not sound like
the kind of director who would make a retread of WITNESS.  But that is
certainly how the television ads make this film look.  It looks like WITNESS
retold, but set among the Hasidic Jews of New York City.  Is that what A
STRANGER AMONG US is?  Well, yes and no.  Yes to the extent that it
certainly is a murder mystery that will take a police detective into a
totally alien culture from what she--in this case she--has known.  And she
does learn to respect that culture.  It even has many of the faults of
WITNESS.  It is about a lot of things, like violence and sex, that members
of the community would try to avoid.  And at the same time it idealizes that
community (and doing both at the same time *could* be viewed as hypocrisy).
On the other hand, Orthodox Jews are a major and important of the culture of
New York City, like Chinese and Blacks and many others, but how often do
they show up in major films?  How many films take the audience into this
community?  The only other film that comes to mind is Jeremy Kagan's THE
CHOSEN.</P>
<P>     Police Detective Emily Eden (played by Melanie Griffith) is having
second thoughts about her life.  By being too much of a "cowboy" and not
following proper procedures, she just got her partner and current lover
stabbed and nearly killed.  She feels guilt about that and at the same time
she is dissatisfied with her life in general.  She is given a light
assignment.  She is to investigate the disappearance of an Hasidic diamond
cutter who may have run off with some diamonds.  Visiting the family of the
missing man at first gives her the discomfort of sticking out with her short
sleeves, her short skirt, and her profanity.  However, the investigation
becomes a murder case that she must move into the Hasidic community to
investigate.</P>
<P>     At this point in the plot it becomes clear that the real story is about
how Eden sees and interfaces with the community.  The actual mystery plot
may account for about half an hour and is not the main thrust of the film.
Instead we see conflicts of values and Eden's growing understanding of and
respect for the Hasidim.  Her lifestyle as seen by the Hasidim has been the
victory of freedom over values.  She sees theirs as the victory of values
over freedom.  She also will have a close relationship with Ariel (played by
Eric Thal), a young scholar destined to be the leader of the community.</P>
<P>     In some ways this film could have been handled much better.  There is
some spectacular photography of New York City.  But once inside the Jewish
community every indoor scene is shot in annoying sepia tones.  At times the
sepia filter frustratingly obscures detail in the sets.  It gives an
artificial and uncomfortable feel to the film.  Perhaps the Hasidic life is
over-idealized.  Everyone seems to be friendly and gets along with each
other.  It is possible that in a lifestyle this rigid there is less
possibility for conflict, but whether that reflects reality or not I do not
know.  The mystery aspect of the story is just not given much time in the
script.  It is a little too simple and perhaps written a little sloppily.</P>
<P>     Still, A STRANGER AMONG US offers a view into a culture rarely shown in
films.  The background is the whole show.  I give it a high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
