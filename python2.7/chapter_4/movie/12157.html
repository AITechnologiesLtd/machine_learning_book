<PRE>HE GOT GAME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     HE GOT GAME, writer and director Spike Lee's indictment of the
pressure put on young athletes, starts with a beautifully choreographed
homage to the sheer joy of shooting hoops.  Filmed in slow motion by
Malik Hassan Sayeed, the camera caresses the ball in golden sunshine as
it spins high in the air on its way to the basket.  The players, who
live in poor environments in the country and in the ghetto, give it
their all even though most of them are playing solo.</P>
<P>     Easily the most striking choice Lee made for the film was that of
the score.  Heavy doses of Aaron Copeland music dominate the handsomely
photographed picture with smaller doses of rap music to contrast with
the classical.  Long after viewers have forgotten the storyline they'll
remember the film's sounds and sights.</P>
<P>     HE GOT GAME tells the story of the "Jesus of Coney Island."  In a
monotone performance lacking much depth, real-life basketball star Ray
Allen plays Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one high school basketball
prospect in the nation.  With ESPN covering his personal life
reverentially as befits a sports god, the kid seems to have it all.
("Jesus is the best thing to happen to the game since tennis shoes,"
effuses one coach.)  And what he doesn't have people want to give to
him, albeit most of it illegally and with strings attached.  Jesus, who
appears at first as honest as his namesake, turns down all of the
lucrative, under-the-table offers.</P>
<P>     Slowly and deliberately the story makes us realize that there are
many rewards, from sex to "loans," that Jesus is more than happy to
accept as compensation.  This Jesus is tempted but isn't always strong
enough to refuse.</P>
<PRE>     What the young star lacks are many true friends.  From his uncle to</PRE>
<P>his girlfriend, the people around him are there for a piece of the
action.  They care about Jesus' money, but little for him as a person,
which only heightens his feeling of isolation.  (When Jesus asks for a
brother to be his agent, a fast-talking Italian-American, with a stable
of expensive racing cars to tempt him, offers a simple piece of advice:
"When making a business decision, the only color that matters is
green.")</P>
<P>     The movie's best performance is delivered by Denzel Washington in
the complex role of Jesus' father, Jake, who has killed his wife and now</P>
<P>languishes in prison until the governor releases him for a week.  The
condition for his brief time on the outside is that Jake must convince
Jesus to agree to go to the governor's alma mater, Big State.  If Jesus
signs with Big State, the governor will try to get Jake's sentenced
reduced.</P>
<P>     Since Jake killed his mother, the ever-cynical Jesus wants nothing
to do with him.  And he orders his sister, who lives in their apartment,</P>
<P>not to speak to their father, whom he considers just another "stranger."</P>
<P>Who is paying for their apartment and their expenses is one of the
questions that the story raises.</P>
<P>     Washington, playing a poor African-American rather than the well
educated, middle-class one that he normally plays, makes Jake into a
believably complicated individual, a likeable guy but one with many
faults.  One of the subplots has him helping an abused prostitute,
played by Milla Jovovich from FIFTH ELEMENT, who lives in the room next
to his in a fleabag hotel.  In flashbacks we see him drunk and verbally
abusing his young son on the basketball court.</P>
<P>     The movie has several problems other than Ray Allen's limited
acting ability.  The story has too many minor characters, including John</P>
<P>Turturro as a coach who uses prayer, multimedia glitz, and free girls to</P>
<P>attract Jesus to his college.  The film's female characters, with the
exception of Jesus' younger sister, exist only for sexual gratification
or temptation.</P>
<P>     Concluding with the same sense of magic with which it began, the
film manages to take the cliche of the big game that ends most sports
movies and give it a whole new spin.</P>
<P>     HE GOT GAME runs too long at 2:11.  It is rated R for sex, nudity,
violence, profanity, and brief drug usage and would be fine for older
teenagers.</P>
