<P>Tea With Mussolini is something of a romanticised memoir of
director Franco Zeffirelli's early life growing up in Florence during
the 1930's and the reign of Mussolini.</P>
<P>The scorpioni were a group of eccentric, expatriate English
ladies living in Florence, largely oblivious to the gathering clouds
of war.  Lady Hester Random (Maggie Smith), the widow of a former
ambassador, is the unofficial leader of this group, who keep alight
the flame of empire and carry the torch of tradition.  In 1935, Mary
Wallace (Joan Plowright), the secretary to a local clothing merchant,
introduces her employer's illegitimate son Luca into this circle.</P>
<P>Luca, fetchingly played by Charlie Lucas and Baird Wallace, is
a thinly disguised, fictional version of the young Zeffirelli.  These
remarkable women take time out to educate the young Luca in fine arts,
Shakespeare, and English, and help shape the boy into the man that he
would eventually become.  Caught between two cultures, Luca comes of
age during the war when he helps the ladies, who were eventually
interned in the nearby walled city of San Gimignano.</P>
<P>Tea With Mussolini is easily Zeffirelli's most personal movie
to date.  With plenty of humour and compassion, the film lovingly
explores those early forces that shaped his love of arts and
literature, which adds a remarkable personal resonance to the tale.
The film spans some ten years, and the narrative occasionally seems to
lack focus.</P>
<P>John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole, brings a touch of sardonic
humour and quaint touches of English eccentricity to the script.  The
dialogue crackles with some witty repartee and wonderfully acerbic
asides, which the superb cast deliver with relish.</P>
<P>Zeffirelli has assembled a superlative cast of fine English
actresses and Oscar winners, and their classy performances enrich the
film.  Smith is superb as the imperious and haughty Lady Hester, while
the always reliable Plowright brings compassion and understanding to
her role.  Judi Dench is fine as Arabella, the eccentric bohemian
artist Arabella, while Cher delivers her best performance for some
time as the flamboyant, vulgar but generous Elsa, an American
entertainer who unexpectedly proves to be the saviour of the group.
Newcomer Wallace, who apparently bears a striking similarity to the
young Zeffirelli, is wonderfully appealing as the teenage Luca, even
though his accent sometimes wavers.</P>
<P>This remarkable tale of courage is also something of a homage
to the beauty and rich history of Florence itself.  Oscar winning
cinematographer David Watkin (Out Of Africa, etc) captures the
beautiful Tuscan landscape, and he imbues the film with a gorgeous,
glossy visual surface.</P>
