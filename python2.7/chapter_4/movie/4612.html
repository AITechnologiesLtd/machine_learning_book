<P>     Perhaps with eleven more orangutans, DUNSTON CHECKS IN might have 
come up to the quality level of TWELVE MONKEYS.  As it is, however, this 
movie is like a bad episode of FAWLTY TOWERS -- minus Basil Fawlty.  
Everything here will be familiar to fans of the '70s British comedy:  
boorish, insulting hotel guests; strange goings-on behind closed doors; 
the dominating wife of the hotel owner making life miserable for the 
employees; and a mysterious hotel inspector hanging around incognito.  
Yet without the antics of John Cleese to lend a manic edge to the 
proceedings, the humor level is way down.  </P>
<P>     There isn't much of a story.  The minimal plot exists exclusively 
to get the orangutan Dunston (played by "Sam") into as many odd, 
potentially-comic circumstances as possible.  Sometimes, these generate 
laughs (although not full-bellied ones); more often, they're greeted 
stone-faced by the audience.  I suspect younger viewers will find 
DUNSTON CHECKS IN a great deal funnier than older ones, but that's not 
surprising when you consider that the script seems to have been written 
with seven-year olds in mind.</P>
<P>     The Majestic Hotel, overseen by the pushy Mrs. Dubrow (Faye 
Dunaway), the owner's wife, is one of Manhattan's five-star venues.  
When word gets out that a hotel guide is about to create a "six-star" 
category, and that an inspector may soon be coming to the Majestic, the 
manager (Jason Alexander) has to be on the constant lookout.  But that's 
not all he has to worry about.  His youngest son, Kyle (Eric Lloyd), 
claims that there's a monkey loose in the hotel.  The animal controller 
(Paul Reubens) brought in to solve the problem turns out to be gun-
crazy.  Room 812 is burgled.  And one incredibly obnoxious guest (Rupert 
Everett) is doing his best to make life hell for everyone working at the 
Majestic.</P>
<P>     The best parts of this film are, by far, the ones that feature Sam, 
who easily outacts the human cast.  The orangutan is fun to watch in the 
way most screen animals are (remember Clyde in Clint Eastwood's EVERY 
WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE and ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN?), but such limited 
amusement value doesn't justify a feature film.  If nothing else, 
however, director Ken Kwapis shows that he knows how to focus on the 
orangutan (although it is pretty obvious when animatronics are used).  
Actors Jason Alexander (from TV's SEINFELD) and Faye Dunaway appear to 
be going through the motions.  Paul Reubens (once known as Pee Wee 
Herman) and Rupert Everett have a scene or two worth a chuckle, but 
that's hardly a reasonable payoff for going so far over-the-top.  </P>
<P>     DUNSTON CHECKS IN is marginal entertainment (at best) for the 
under-12 crowd.  More mature viewers will find the lame plot and dumb 
jokes increasingly irritating as the film plods onward.  Considering 
this movie alongside FOUR ROOMS, it's looking like a bad time for the 
motion picture hotel business.   </P>
