<PRE>Phantoms</PRE>
<P>Starring Ben Affleck, Joanna Going, Rose McGowan, Liev Schrieber</P>
<P>"Phantoms" is based on a novel by Dean Koontz, one of my favorite authors.
In fact, I read the book about the same time I heard a movie was going to
be made, and loved it.  It was with this knowledge that I went into
"Phantoms" expecting a kick-ass horror flick.  Unfortunately, I was very
disappointed.</P>
<P>The movie isn't all that dissimiliar from the book, which isn't surprising
considering Koontz also wrote the screenplay.  The premise is simple:  A
young doctor and her sister enter the small town of Snowfield only to
discover that the entire population is either dead or missing.  With the
help of a few surviving police officers, they set out to discover what
happened to the town.  Peter O'Toole shows up a bit later to assist our
protagonists, as he is a reporter who may or may not know what it is that
they're dealing with.</P>
<P>You would think that a movie with a plot as relatively simple as that
would be a fast-paced horror/mystery.  But, with a director like Joe
Chappelle, you'd be wrong.  Chappelle, who's last film was "Halloween 6"
(arguably the worst of the series), hasn't the faintest idea how to direct
a full-length motion picture.  He ruins nearly every scene with multiple
point-of-view shots, super-fast editing, and shoddy camerawork.  He seems
to be under the false impression that fast editing and camera movements
equals a fast-pace.  All that does is disorient the viewer and confuse the
storyline.  Perhaps under the direction of a more experience director,
"Phantoms" would have been the excellent film I had hoped for.</P>
<P>The fault certainly doesn't lie with Koontz, who has crafted a superb
companion piece to his excellent novel.  Nor does it lie with the young
cast who attempt to make the best out of a bad situation.  Well, everyone
except Affleck, who seems rather out of place as the tough-as-nails
sheriff.  Affleck is an excellent actor (see "Good Will Hunting" for
proof), but, as Dirty Harry might say, "a man's got to know his
limitations". </P>
<P>"Phantoms" had the potential to be a great horror film, but unfortunately,
it was saddled with a truly incompetent director.  Let's hope that the
next Koontz novel to make it to the big screen isn't helmed by a
third-rate, wannabe-auteur with delusions of grandeur.</P>
