<P>Following the sneak preview of "Erin Brockovich," I listened to a couple
of young men discussing the movie. While agreeing that the film was very
good, they mocked the notion of Julia Roberts playing a down-on-her-luck
working-class woman. As the two prattled on, I fought the urge to
interrupt their conversation and dramatically intone, "Please, don't
hate her because she's beautiful!"</P>
<P>"Erin Brockovich" is an enormously rewarding tale of a real life hero
and Julia Roberts does terrific work in the title role. Renowned
independent film director Steven Soderbergh ("sex, lies and videotape")
has crafted a mainstream film with a realistic feel that manages to
present disturbing facts in a crowd-pleasing fashion without
compromising the integrity of its source material. He also provides
Julia Roberts the best forum for her acting abilities to date. As
Brockovich, an acerbic twice-divorced mother of three, she hits a grand
slam with a vibrant performance crackling with authenticity.</P>
<P>After coming out the loser in a "can't miss" lawsuit over a car
accident, Brockovich badgers her rumpled lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert
Finney), into giving her a job as a legal assistant. Her coworkers
detest her foul mouth and brash manners, not to mention her insistence
on wearing outrageously sexy outfits more appropriate to a biker bar
than a law office. While her presentation style is abrasive at best,
Brockovich proves to be a fiercely effective employee.</P>
<P>Uncovering some paperwork that just doesn't make sense, Brockovich
visits a tiny California desert town to check out the incongruities. She
learns that a Pacific Gas & Electric plant has been involved in a quiet
campaign to buy off the locals, paying their medical bills and offering
modest sums to purchase their homes. The residents are grateful to the
"caring" corporation, until Brockovich discovers that the area water is
tainted with a toxic chromium rust inhibitor. The chemicals, which the
utility told the people was "good for them," is the likely cause of a
laundry list of horrific medical conditions affecting the haggard
townspeople.</P>
<P>Brockovich takes this information to Masry, who gradually realizes he is
dealing with a lawsuit of potentially historic proportions. The tired
lawyer, in the sunset of his career, is appropriately concerned that he
may lack the resources and energy to take on a corporate giant. But
nonstop badgering from Brockovich results in his reluctant acceptance of
the David versus Goliath case.</P>
<P>If this sounds a lot like 1998's "A Civil Action," it is, but with a
crucial difference in approach. Where "A Civil Action" followed lawyers
and showcased courtroom dramatics, "Erin Brockovich" remains focused on
the people whose lives were devastated by corporate neglect. We watch
Brockovich as she travels from home to home, trying to build and
maintain hope with families beaten down by their various physical
ailments.</P>
<P>But the film is not a downer. By keeping the amazing Brockovich front
and center, Soderbergh gives us a production as entertaining as it is
poignant. Brockovich has a hell of a mouth on her and is given to
gloriously acidic speeches and tart one-liners. But she doesn't know
when to stop and the fiery woman often turns out to her own worst enemy.
Brockovich also is well aware of her good looks and uses sexy clothing
and push-up bras to open doors that would remain closed to most. Roberts
is spectacular in the role, creating a wonderfully three-dimensional
character.</P>
<P>Incidentally, the real Erin Brockovich makes a brief appearance as a
put-upon waitress who offers the fictional Brockovich a bit of advice.
Watch her eyes and listen to her line delivery, and you'll see that
Roberts had a dynamic role model to work from.</P>
<P>Albert Finney proves a grand match to Roberts' lightning and thunder,
reacting magnificently to her take-no-prisoners approach. What a delight
it is to see the veteran actor studying his young charge with
expressions that simultaneously reflect his delight in her impudence and
fear that Ms. Mouth will screw things up.</P>
<P>Aaron Eckhart, lead viper in the indie hit "In the Company of Men" and
self absorbed schlub in "Your Friends and Neighbors," transforms himself
yet again as a good-hearted biker who becomes Brockovich's boyfriend,
only to find himself relegated to being little more than a live-in
baby-sitter as Brockovich grows obsessed with her crusade. Eckhart is
excellent and his role is a welcome reversal on the countless
stand-by-your-man neglected females in other films.</P>
<P>In addition to his obvious rapport with the cast, Soderbergh handles
this big story with great technical skill as well, deliberately
overexposing the desert town scenes and using hand-held cameras to give
personal moments a home-movie intimacy. And, to his credit, he tells the
complex legal tale clearly with, miracle of miracles, only one very
short courtroom scene.</P>
<P>At times, the production becomes overly glib, but even that minor
failing somehow fits, given the style of the main character. "Erin
Brockovich" is the first truly satisfying film of 2000, an inspiring and
terrifically entertaining tale of tenacity and triumph. Don't miss this
one.</P>
