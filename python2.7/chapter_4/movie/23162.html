<PRE>Pitch Black
A film review by Max Messier
Filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Mama, could you leave the hall light on tonight?</P>
<P>One thing I love to see in a film is definition of character without the
need for a windy, Oscar speech or the death of a loved one that prompts
an "emotional release."  The only genre that gives you that type of
character is the Western.  The Western is littered with good men with
bad hearts and bad men who struggle for a clean conscious.  The words of
these men carry a heavy emotional burden and clearly define and expose
the true nature of the person.  Pitch Black is one of the best films I
have seen in a very long time, and it carves its roots from the essence
of a Western, providing amazing clarity with a direct narrative prose.</P>
<P>>From the moment the lights dim, the audience is thrown into an emotional
situation where innocent people go to `meet their maker' and survival is
their first instinct.  In those first moments, Pitch Black wraps its
hands around your neck and never lets go.  To wit: A passenger spaceship
carrying 40 people hits some type of space debris and crash lands on a
barren, desert plant with only 7 people walking away.  The survivors
include a convicted murder with infrared lenses for eyes, a marshal with
a hidden agenda, a selfish pilot focused on saving her own ass, a
religious leader with three followers, and various odds and ends of
characters.  The three suns shine brightly on the planet's surface, and
the hodgepodge of survivors form a loose collation to survive.  The only
problem is that something is hiding in the shadows, waiting for them in
the dark.</P>
<P>This simple plot lets the script take shape and lets the characters
develop and define their own prerogatives.  With amazing cinematography
that resembles the work of the David O. Russell film Three Kings,
director David Twohy gives the planet a barren, washed-out look, and all
of the interiors of the wrecked ship a cool metallic tinge.  One of main
elements that gives the film such a film grip on the senses in the
presence of Vin Diesel, currently seen in the new film Boiler Room and
from last year's Saving Private Ryan.  His cool, somewhat haunting prose
littered with poignant words reminds you of the gunslinger who has
killed one too many people and has lost touch with the human race: A man
of honor who provides the main catalyst for defining his fellow
characters' personal attributes and motivations.</P>
<P>By underexposing the terror that lies in wait for the survivors, the
feelings of suspense and claustrophobia are astonishing.  What lies
beyond the circle of light?  What lies beyond the light bears a strong
resemblance to the aliens designed by Geiger and the movements of the
creatures mimic those of the raptors of Jurassic Park.  But Twohy lets
us also `see' through the eyes of the aliens and take part in the hunt
for food.  (The concept was first employed in the Schwartzenegger
vehicle from the eighties, Predator.)</P>
<P>The most attractive element of Pitch Black is how beautiful the
cinematography is, while developing a real sense of an alien world.  You
can almost feel the heat from the ground and the dizziness of the
humidity in the air.  The mish-mash of B-actors pull together some
terrific acting, and no loose ends of the storyline are left hanging in
the lurch.  It's pretty amazing when you realize this script came from
the guys that wrote the riveting drama, The Birds II: Land's End.</P>
<P>For the ride of your life (or at least just two hours of mayhem), Pitch
Black will leave you with the sudden urgency to leave the hall light on
when you climb into bed that night.  But it's a lot scarier to not know
what's in the dark, waiting for you to turn the corner.  Wes Craven and
John Carpenter taught us that a long time ago.</P>
