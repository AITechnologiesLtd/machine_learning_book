<PRE>                             MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Out-and-out begging for an Oscar might have been more dignified than
the brazen performance by Richard Dreyfuss in the title role of MR.
HOLLAND'S OPUS.  Here, Dreyfuss makes his bid for Oscar number two (he won
in 1977 for THE GOODBYE GIRL), and given the fare Hollywood has seen fit
to throw us this year, I'll be surprised if he doesn't win.</P>
<P>     Mr. Holland is, of all things, a lowly high school band teacher, and
the film follows 30 years of his life, from 1965 to the present.  Mr.
Holland, in his first year of teaching, finds himself turning into that
very thing which he detests, a dry and boring instructor who isn't getting
through to the kids, so he decides to make a few changes in his teaching
style to get the students involved and interested.  Using all manner of
unorthodox teaching methods, Mr. Holland eventually breaks through and
becomes the darling of John F. Kennedy High School, and we see the
profound effect he really does have on a number of his students.</P>
<P>     The film is something akin to a series of vignettes, each profiling
Mr. Holland's relationship with one student or another, most notably the
driven yet apparently talentless Gertrude (Alicia Witt, who appears all
too briefly) and vocal ingenue Rowena.  All the while, Mr. Holland's own
life seems to play second chair to his teaching.  His own symphony goes
virtually ignored, as does his family:  his wife, Iris (Glenne Headly),
and his deaf son, Cole.</P>
<P>     MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS treats us to the transformation of the students
without relying too much on the corny antics that similar films tend
toward.  Rather, the movie is filled with genuine, tearjerking emotion
despite its often rambling 2 1/2 hour length, and we are constantly
entertained by a number of moving performances of classic tunes and modern
ones.  The one over-the-top element of the picture is, of course,
Dreyfuss, whose performance culminates in the singing of a heartfelt yet
nearly unbearable rendition of John Lennon's "Beautiful Boy," dedicated to
his estranged son.  But you've gotta give him points for trying.</P>
<P>     The integration of political messages and stock footage into the film
is a bit distracting, as it is used to set the time frame and little
more.  But if you can get past this and let yourself slip into the web
that Dreyfuss manages to weave, you'll find a heart of sincerity in this
lazy, free-flowing, and only sometimes obvious picture.  Be sure to bring
a hanky.</P>
