<P>AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS (2001). 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Roberts,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, Billy Crystal, Stanley Tucci, Hank Azaria,
Christopher Walken, Alan Arkin and Seth Green. Written by Crystal and Peter
Tolan. Music by James Newton Howard. Directed by Joe Roth. Approx. 110 minutes.
Rated PG-13. </P>
<P>With an all-star cast and a script that keeps the laughs coming almost
continuously, Americaí's Sweethearts is a delight. </P>
<P>This Joe Roth-directed comedy mixes farce, satire, physical humor and romance to
create a winning feature that will keep you chuckling. </P>
<P>The story is simple: An estranged movie-star couple must come together for a
press junket weekend to promote their 10th and final film pairing. Along the
way, they bring their emotional baggage, resentments and hostilities. </P>
<PRE>Oh, and one of them falls in love. </PRE>
<P>America's Sweethearts has an old-fashioned quality despite some raunchy humor.
It's a distant cousin to the screwball comedies of the 1930s and '40s. Some of
the more outrageous moments are reminiscent of those zany Preston Sturges movies
from the early '40s such as Sullivan's Travels. </P>
<P>Sweethearts has a sweetheart of a cast, headed by Julia Roberts and featuring
Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, Billy Crystal (who also co-wrote the script
and produced the film), Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci, Alan Arkin and Christopher
Walken. </P>
<P>The movie is filled with little gems, from Tucci's maniacally frustrated studio
head describing to veteran press agent Lee Phillips (Crystal) why Senor Wences
was the only true show biz genius, to Cusack's Eddie Thomas and Phillips taking
a bow above the junketís press corps after Eddie nearly falls from the hotel
roof in what the press perceives as a suicide attempt. </P>
<P>Some nice one-liners also abound. When Eddie shows up alone at the hotel, he is
asked about the whereabouts of his entourage. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. "I'm
my own entourage," he responds. </P>
<P>Performances sparkle throughout America's Sweethearts. Zeta-Jones is cruelly
funny as the pampered, spoiled, self-centered movie star who treats every minor
inconvenience as a cataclysmic disaster. </P>
<P>Cusack's Eddie, while more grounded in reality, practices some New Age
mumbo-jumbo to help remain centered. But he also flashes his movie star ego at
times, worrying about grosses and the trajectory of his career. </P>
<P>Roberts is the comedy's heart. She plays Kiki, Gwen's sister and assistant. Her
movie-star sibling treats her more like a go-fer than a sister. She uses love
and sisterly devotion to wheedle Kiki into catering to her every whim. </P>
<P>And it seems she has been doing this her entire life. Kiki reminds her that in
high school when Gwen wanted to break up with a boyfriend, she'd send Kiki to
break the bad news. "I wound up being the most hated girl in school," Kiki tells
her oblivious sibling. </P>
<P>To make matters more complicated, Kiki is in love with Eddie and believes Gwen
treated him badly. </P>
<P>Crystal is connivingly convincing as the always-thinking press agent who sees
every misstep or accident as an opportunity as a movie promotion. </P>
<P>Walken, looking like a Woodstock burn-out case, is hilariously weird as the
director who brings his singular vision to the movie he was supposed to have
shot. </P>
<P>Veteran Arkin turns in a sly appearance as Eddie's therapist who spouts Eastern
bromides that sound sage, but really make no sense at all. </P>
<P>The movie's only major misstep is in Azaria's portrayal of Hector, Gwen's
Spanish lover. His characterization comes close to being an offensive stereotype
of Latino machismo as he seems only to be concerned about his 
reputation as a lover and the size of his penis. </P>
<P>America's Sweethearts is a honey or a comedy, a movie you'd want to cuddle up
with. It's warm and cute as well as satirical and sharp. </P>
<P>Plus, you get to see Julia Roberts in a fat suit. Who could ask for anything
more! </P>
