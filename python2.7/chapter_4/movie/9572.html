<PRE>IN & OUT
-a review by Bill Chambers
** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>starring Kevin Kline, Matt Dillon, Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck
screenplay by Paul Rudnick
directed by Frank Oz</P>
<PRE>In & Out passes for satire in 1997.</PRE>
<P>Kline stars as Howard Brackett, a dedicated high school teacher
engaged to the lovely Emily (Cusack). One of his past students,
Cameron Drake (Dillon), is up for an Academy Award, for a film about a
homosexual army soldier titled "To Serve and Protect". Brackett is
happy as a clam, until Drake wins and outs his favourite teacher
before the world. Over the next three days, Brackett has to decide
whether or not to deny the charge and carry on a charade by marrying
his fiancee, or take the advice of gay newscaster Selleck, and jump
from the closet.</P>
<P>Rudnick, an openly gay screenwriter, is frequently a razor sharp wit,
and no character, straight or gay, is spared. Take supermodel Shalom
Harlow (an Oshawa, Ontario, Canada native, and once a schoolmate of
mine!), who, as Drake's waif-girlfriend, doesn't want to leave her
house at one point because she still has to "shower and vomit." Or
Wilfred Brimley, as Brackett's father, who loves his son
unconditionally, even if he "got drunk, climbed the clock tower with a
shotgun and took out the whole town." But amusing as it is--there are
a great many belly laughs--the picture feels curiously cold, and the
mechanics of the plot curiously manufactured, as if it were a bad
script with a good dialogue doctor.  The Oscar ceremony is virtually
laughless, if only because it's the most off-target recreation of the
event this side of The Bodyguard. I realize that realism may not have
been the goal of this sequence, but aren't imitations and impressions
funnier when they're dead-on?</P>
<P>Kevin Kline is terrific, as always; Dillon's character starts out
bitingly mean--is he doing Brad Pitt?--and then goes disappointingly
soft. Selleck is good--Magnum P.I. fans everywhere will no doubt be
shocked by a certain standout scene--in a TV-ready sort of
way. Director Oz, who has in his lifetime voiced Fozzie Bear, Yoda,
and directed the brilliant Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, has a good sense
of pace, and his comic timing is often spot-on, but he lacks the edge
to make a truly cynical movie, and so the proceedings are best
described as wishy-washy.</P>
