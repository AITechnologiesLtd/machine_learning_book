Touch of Evil (1958)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 85</PRE>
<P>"Touch of Evil" is an excellent movie.  It is also one of
Universal Studio's strangest films from the 1950s.  It is
dark, lurid, and weird.</P>
<P>Charlton Heston plays a high-ranking Mexican law officer.
He is on his honeymoon with Janet Leigh.  On the American
side of the border with Mexico, a car explodes.  Heston
becomes involved in the case, to the annoyance of local
police celebrity Orson Welles (who also directed the film
and wrote the screenplay).  Heston accuses Welles of
framing a Mexican for the bombing.  Further complicating
matters, the Grande family has a grudge against Heston
for imprisoning their kingpin.  The Grande family seeks
revenge against Heston through Leigh, who has almost as
bad a time here as she would in "Psycho" two years later.</P>
<P>Heston's intense acting style suits his character well.
He is determined to seek justice, first for the framed
accused, then against Welles, then for his wife Leigh.</P>
<P>Welles just looks awful.  Corpulent, unshaven, slurring,
limping and corrupt, he is grossly overweight.  He is
practically worshipped by his fellow officers.  His
"game leg" gives him "hunches" which always prove correct.
This does not keep him from planting evidence to support
his hunches.  Welles' character grows increasingly
unstable throughout the movie.  This inconsistency does
not harm the film, however, but increases its tension.</P>
<P>Marlene Dietrich has a few scenes as the owner of a...
well, some kind of non-respectable establishment.  Her
only customer is Welles.  She may represent Death.</P>
<P>Dennis Weaver plays a hotel "night manager".  His character 
is so weird and quirky, it would never be credible in a
conventional film.  But "Touch of Evil" is not conventional,
and he fits right in.  His trademark expression is,
"If they think I'm gonna do that, they've got another
thing coming!"</P>
<P>"Touch of Evil" must be seen to be believed, and it
is remarkable that it is a 1958 product of Universal.
You would think some studio mogul would see it and say,
'What is the audience?  Who would go to see this film?
There's no love interest.  It's not a comedy or a drama.
It's not really even a mystery!'  I guess "film noir"
has claimed it, and we can only be thankful for its
existence.</P>
