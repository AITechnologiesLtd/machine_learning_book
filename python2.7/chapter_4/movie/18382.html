<P>        There are some movies you don't actually have to watch to know what 
happens. There are some movies that are so standard, so cliche, so unoriginal 
they don't take much mental energy to pitch, produce and sell to the public. 
And in keeping with movies like this, which `The Mummy' is a perfect example 
of, us critics don't have to do much in the lines of reviewing them because 
the public, the film studios and us critics ourselves already know what we're 
going to say, it's just kind of a formality to sit down at a computer and 
push the letters on the keyboard in the proper sequence.</P>
<PRE>        I figure if the filmmakers are going to go to recycle the same 
material over and over, why can't I do the same with my review?</PRE>
<P>        So here's some quotes from reviews of other movies. I trust my 
readers are smart enough to figure out what I'm trying to say... I'll meet 
you at the end of the review while I go grab a beer.</P>
<P>        `From the title alone... doesn't sound too appealing because it's so 
generic and boring. It's the epitome of a sci-fi title, and not surprisingly, 
this is the epitome of a sci-fi movie. It... tries to use both intelligent 
reasoning and barbaric violence to solve problems - guess which method 
dominates?' - review of `Alien.'</P>
<P>        `Getting an audience's attention right from the beginning plays a 
major role in how today's films work. We want to have something exciting to 
watch, not a slow build-up of a story (God forbid!), and this film plays 
right into the mainstream's hands. The opening sequence uses mystery, comedy, 
and action simultaneously to give a sneak preview of the level of the 
in-your-face energy the film has,' - review of `Armageddon.'</P>
<P>        `It's clear the film doesn't want to waste time on reality and thus 
the attempt to establish plausibility (the most minimal amount necessary) 
comes across as a half-assed effort. Supporting characters and shady 
sup-plots are introduced, but as is the case with films made up of a large 
cast of characters, only a handful have any real significance... There's a 
fine line separating homage from plagiarism...,' - review of `Godzilla' (1998)</P>
<P>        `... this story is fine and the film does a good job in creating a 
suspenseful mood since we seem to be the only ones who can see the obvious. 
Horror stories thrive on this kind of element, so when the evil things happen 
we can say to the naysayers, "Told you so." However, the manner in which the 
film actually breaks down the plot and uses this element is quite 
exploitative,' - review of `The Exorcist.'</P>
<P>        `Unfortunately, as is the case with most modern thrillers, once the 
film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence, the cliches and 
action sequences take over,' - review of `The Jackal.'</P>
<P>        `Most of the film is a bad rip-off of the "Indiana Jones" films and 
just about every sci-fi movie and comic book ever. We get a lot of rhetoric 
that seems to justify all the unnecessary violence and bizarre storyline and 
mythology, but just considering the basic elements, it's too stupid to take 
seriously,' - review of `Stargate.'</P>
<P>        `The last act... seems like the world really will come to an end and 
yet none of the characters seem worried about it... The script conviently 
provides for the massive special effects disaster imagery it promises and a 
climatic resolution, but still fails to work even as eye candy as it's very 
unconvincing and ends much too quickly,' - review of `Deep Impact.'</P>
<P>        `There isn't much going for... other than its special effects and 
production design (which are excellent, I'll have to admit it), but that 
doesn't make up for the mediocre story. Maybe if it had been scripted with 
more wit, it would be worth getting excited over,' - review of `Aliens.'</P>
<P>        But seriously folks, what it all comes down to is that `The Mummy' 
tries to be funny and intense at the same time and it just doesn't happen. 
It's hard to find the intense and suspenseful elements intense and 
suspenseful when you already know what's going to happen. It's good they 
throw in the comedy to keep us laughing when there's no action or adventure 
going on, but why not through in the comedy during the supposed adventure 
elements? What we end up with is clashing moods which cancel each other out 
and all we're left with is people running around and special effects. We 
could watch `Waterworld' for that.</P>
