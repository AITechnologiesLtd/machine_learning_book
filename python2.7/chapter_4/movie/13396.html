<P>Perhaps the first movie I remember in which a double takes the place of a
bad leader and does good things for his people was The Prisoner of Zenda.
Since then there have been many such substitutions on the screen. That's
what Moon Over Parador does too. It's not the most original of ideas, but
then the film makes no bones about the fact that it keeps dippily dipping
into the past, putting old wines into not-so-new bottles. Sometimes it even
shouts this, sometimes it's a passing mention, sometimes it leaves the
recognition entirely up to the public .</P>
<P>MOP is remarkably low-key, even quiet, given its context. Although it's  a
farce, it does not suffer from the frantic tempo or actors' hysterics and
raucousness than can spoil many a comedy, not to mention farces.</P>
<P>The plot is blessedly straightforward and unpretentious. An American movie
crew has just wrapped up shooting in Parador City, the capital of a Latin
American banana dictatorship (Parador means "inn" in Spanish). One of the
cast is Jack Noah (Richard Dreyfuss). His first allegiance is to the New
York stage. He is very much the New York thespian.</P>
<P>Bizarre American retiree Jonathan Winters talks him into staying around
for the Carnival. Jack looks a great deal like Simms, the country's
military dictator. He  also does a good imitation of him. Boozer-wencher
Simms, has a heart attack in his limousine, where he dies in the arms of
Roberto Strausmann (Raul Julia), head of the secret police and the regime's
grey eminence. Strausmann, who is in cahoots with  the " 14  families" that
oppress the people, fears that too sudden an announcement of the Leader's
demise could result in chaos and revolution. He makes Jack one of those
offers one  cannot refuse: to impersonate  Simms.</P>
<P>Jack is nimble, Jack is quick, and before you can say Jack Robinson, the
impostor has made himself up like Simms and is fooling everybody. Well,
almost everyone.The members of Simms' household are not taken in, but they
too have a stake in  keeping up the masquerade.</P>
<P>Not only playing, but being Simms becomes the part of Jack's life. He
thrives in it, even embellishes it. When Sonia Braga, as Madonna (sic), the
late dictator's Numero Uno mistress, transfers her affections to the
impersonator, no work and all play make Jack a bright boy. He stays on and
on, makes gradual changes in the land, replaces the national anthem's
melody (O Tannenbaum) with that of Besa Me Mucho ; leads "his" people in TV
weight-loss exercises; takes other drastic measures to help the poor
before staging cannily his return to New York. (Although the movie is set
in Parador, New York is very much present, as a framing device and with its
theatre as Jack's standard by which everything is evaluated. All this is
cleverly done, with good insights).</P>
<P>To expect substance, deep intentions or  ideas in this movie is to be
looking for something quite different from what Mazursky and Capetanos had
in mind.The filmmakers are interested only in gentle farce, not in
three-dimensionality. Moon is far closer to the Marx Brothers' anarchic
nonsense (and Woody Allen's Bananas) than to Frank Capra 's constructive
comedies. The focal point is not the story, but the one-man show by
Dreyfuss, and its comical trimmings.</P>
<P>Dreyfuss is as amazingly good as he has been in the last many years. On the
face of it, Jack is the picture's most outlandish type, yet in  some ways
he is the most credible, since he doesn't let you forget that first and
last he is an actor submerged in his craft, insecure, avid for pats on the
back and reassuring applause. He joins the roster of other movie
impersonators, especially people like Jack Benny and Mel Brooks who, in the
two versions of To Be Or Not To Be  ham it up because their models are
already hams.  Director Mazursky himself is in the movie, as   Simms'
mother, a la Charley's Aunt.</P>
<P>But there's a difference: as soon as Dreyfuss assumes the role of Simms, he
becomes entirely confident, simultaneously laid-back, self-mocking and
eager. It's much harder to do than it sounds, or for that matter, than it
looks. Ask any non-envious professional.</P>
<P>MOP creates no characters and does not intend to. Most of its people remain
in the background, save for Raul Julia who delivers an amusingly
mock-sinister performance--but even he is there primarily to propel
Dreyfuss along. Sonia Braga is no more than cake-frosting. Jonathan Winters
does some excellent small shticks which deride the U.S. presence in Latin
America, something that is also implied by the Anglo-Saxon name of Dictator
Simms. But, again, forget about the political satire: what we have is
caricature used for the needs of the story, carrying no weight of its own.</P>
<P>It is rich in comic inventions and fresh bits of business. It is also a
compendium of in-jokes and in-references to current events and older
movies. Like the French New Wave filmmakers who influenced him enormously,
Mazursky throws in with abandon a cornucopia of allusions .
The very title of the film parodies the 1941 Betty Grable vehicle Moon Over
Miami, a semi-musical with switched identities. There's ironic-nostalgic
use of the flashback structure of so many 1940s movies, as MOO opens with
Jack back in New York recounting his Parador adventure. The name of
Paraguay's then-dictator General Stroessner becomes Straussmann (Raul
Julia), which additionally stresses the Germans or Nazis in Latin America.
"Round up the usual suspects,"the famous line from Casablanca is used.
There's a starry-eyed comparison of that movie's finale with Moon's. The
sets imitate indirectly the Technicolor exotic-resort movies of Mazursky's
youth. And much more.</P>
<P>This comedy is so determinedly a fantasy that I doubt it could offend
Hispanic sensibilities. Oddly, the peak of its planned illogicality is not
immediately apparent. You may get distracted by the broad shenanigans  and
forget that Dreyfuss-Simms speaks Spanish-accented English  throughout,
when, even by the elastic norms of farce, he should be speaking Spanish.
You can't get more unrealistic than this.</P>
<P>There's a  very funny  morsel where Jack, about to board a helicopter,
gestures to the reporters in the patented smiling, helpless "I can't hear
over this din" way of Ronald Reagan.The public got this one when the movie
came out, but how many new generations will catch on later? It will be as
in many of the other gags, which, back in 1988, were there for older
memories. How many people knew then or know now "Besame Mucho," the songs
from "The Man of La Mancha," the fact that "Tannenbaum" is a Teutonic song
? Paul Mazursky, who was 58 when the film was released, may have
overestimated the  potential complicity of his public.Then again, he might
have relying on the younger audience's satisfaction with the general
outline of the movie, and on the older people's enhanced comprehension.
It's a risky strategy which bespeaks more of Mazursky as a nostalgic
film-buff than as a calculating businessman.</P>
<P>At 105 minutes, MOP could just be a tad too long for those who don't get
immersed in the spirit of its details, which, in their eyes, can make the
film falter and some jokes strain a bit in its latter parts. For myyself
and other spectators the diffusion is an asset. (My own small objection is
the  gratuitous intrusion of Sammy Davis, Jr. whose singing is not exactly
a joy). Yet even unpruned, this is still a splendidly entertaining
movie-movie. It is a bright Moon.</P>
<P>It was shot entirely in Brazil. Production values are high. Maurice Jarre's
score is agreeable, though some moments sounded to me like a paraphrase of
the Delerue music in Jules And Jim. Parador looks lovely. Between its
tourist beauties at poolside and the promiscuous locals it would be a great
place for social diseases.</P>
