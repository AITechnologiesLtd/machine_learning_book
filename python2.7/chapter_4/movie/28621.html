<P>   Some years back a New Yorker named Bernhard Goetz was
surrounded in a subway car by four young men armed with
screwdrivers.  They encircled him, though I don't believe they
had produced weapons, and demanded money.  Goetz
surprised them by pulling out a small pistol, putting a round into
each of the muggers.  While one was on the floor, he pumped yet
another round into him, saying, "You don't look too bad...have
another."  Goetz is white and the young men are black.  The black
community in New York almost unanimously condemned the
action while perhaps a majority of whites thought he was justified
in shooting the bullies.</P>
<P>   Should Goetz have followed the protocol advised by the New
York City police department, quickly handing over his cash to
avoid greater violence?  Or, just how far should we go in dealing
with bullies--people who browbeat others, often with no real
motive, just to demonstrate their power?   Pretty darn far,
according to seven teens who inhabit the story of "Bully," based
on a true story made into a novel by Jim Schutze from a murder
that took place in 1993.  The titled bully of the story in which
actual names are used, Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl), is not the
sweetest fella around though in fact he may be no worse than any
of the four screwdriver-carrying muggers who had a strange
encounter with Bernhard Goetz.  Unlike the hapless four, Bobby
has things going for him.  His dad is supportive, giving him tough
love and encouraging him to go to college and then into a family
business.  His best friend Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro), on the
other hand, is a high-school dropout who spends his days riding
around in convertibles, smoking weed, dropping acid, and
probably resents the better future that Bobby seems to have in
store.  Having received one hard punch in the nose too much
from the excitable Bobby (after putting a minor dent in the latter's
car), he asks his girl Lisa Connelly (Rachel Miner) for advice.  "Kill
him," is the reply--two words that echo from the recent high-school
killings in Columbine, Colorado, the Matthew Sheppard case, and
even I suppose from Japan where a knife-wielding psycho slashed
several elementary school youngsters to death.</P>
<P>   Movie buffs will immediately pick up the Larry Clark signature,
which is scrawled all over this harrowing movie.  Clark, whose
astonishing filmmaking debut  "Kids" in 1995 gazed at a group of
skateboarding, aimless teens in New York City centering on a
young man with a knack for deflowering virgins, moved to the
actual South Florida suburb that was the locus of the actual story. 
Once again Clark uses the cinema verite style to give the step-by-
step account the feeling of reality, in one case watching his
cameraman Steve Gainer encircle a row of plotting post-
pubescents so repeatedly that some of the audience couldn't be
blamed for acquring a sudden case of vertigo worse than what
they experienced while watching "The Blair Witch Project."  While
you can dodge the giddy feeling by closing your eyes at that point,
you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen for the
remainder of the agonizing work, which not only graphically
illustrates the murder at a 'gator-filled Florida swamp to which the
unwitting victim is driven but focuses close-up on the promiscuous
sex engaged in by comely adolescents, some of whom would not
be out of place in a Calvin Klein ad.  </P>
<P>   Clark is intent on eliciting a psychological study as well to a
killing that appears virtually without motive--given the alternative
that the victims of Bobby's bullying to enjoin his teasing by simply
talking to him, in a group if need be.  Most alarming is the case of
Lisa who seems like a quiet enough person when we first meet
her, in fact speechless when together with her own best pal Ali
Willis (Bijou Phillips)--allowing Ali to do all the flirting with Marty
and Bobby.  A suburban girl, bored almost to the point of
caricature, she goads the man she believes she loves ("I would do
anything for you, Marty") into plotting the assassination partly
because Bobby at times appears to threaten her relationship with
her lover-boy but mainly, I think, because she gets an almost
orgasmic charge from playing the Iago role.  Watch this fine
young actress as a smile crosses her face from time to time just
as she is expressing her hatred of Mr. Kent.</P>
<P>   The rest of the teens, played largely by performers who may just
make a name for themselves as did Chloe Sevigny from her role
in "Kids," perform admirably as well.  Brad Renfro is a pudgy
Marty who becomes surprisingly aggressive when given the
chance to play Brutus, and Leo Fitzpatrick as "Hitman" takes
charge for the first time after having convinced the gang falsely
that he was an actual mafia killer.</P>
<P>   The sex scenes are among the most graphic ever displayed on
the commercial screen which is why, if the movie gets a NC-17
rating, the very youngsters who should see this film as a warning
may not be able to.  Perhaps the film will remind you of your own
adolescence, a time that your hormones raced and you did some
naughty things without the slightest regard for consequences--
only to feel intense regret and even to point an accusatory finger
to your best buddy if such an action would alleviate your guilt. 
The director has made excellent use of Zachary Long and Roger
Pullis's challenging screenplay--which itself was adopted from Jim
Schutze's novel, handing us once again a hardhitting, realistic
and even didactic drama.  Bully for Larry Clark.</P>
