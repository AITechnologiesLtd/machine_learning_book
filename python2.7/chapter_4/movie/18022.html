<PRE>Deep Impact (1998)
* * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"Deep Impact", disaster-season-twin to the wretched "Armageddon", is an
absorbing enough movie when it unfolds in front of you.  But when it's over,
its seams (and there are a lot of them) bulk huge.</P>
<P>I'll be fair.  Instead of becoming the comedic macho-porn action-movie cliche
that "Armageddon" sunk to, "Deep Impact" tries to deal realistically with the
possibility of global annihilation.  It falls short, I suspect, because there
are far too many times that we are reminded, however quietly, that we are only
watching a movie.</P>
<P>"Deep Impact" opens with young Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) peeking at the
heavens through his telescope.        There's something up there which doesn't seem
to register on the charts, and it takes professional astronomer Marcus Wolf
(Charles Martin Smith) to figure out it's a comet on a collision course for
Earth.        He rushes out the door of the observatory with his data disk in his
hand, and then gets himself killed in a crash with a semi.  Right off the bat
this told me the movie is not above using cheap plot devices to build
suspense.</P>
<P>No matter.  The movie skips ahead a year, into Plot Thread Two.  Not-so-
intrepid reporter Jenny *Lerner* (get it?) stumbles across a scandal involving
a Presidential cabinet member and what she believes to be a mistress
named "Ellie".  Lerner is played by Tea Leone as someone who only seems to be
about 66% there. Later on, when she's an MSNBC anchor, she's so wooden and
lifeless I was waiting for a cane to come from offscreen and yank her out of
the chair.</P>
<P>Of course, the scandal is not the news about "Ellie", but "E.L.E.", or an
Extinction Level Event -- the aforementioned comet plowing into the earth and
decimating life as we know it.  In a nice little scene, President Beck (Morgan
Freeman) confronts Lerner about the news and forces her to balance her own ego
against the welfare of billions.  In a movie where a lot of things are not
terribly convincing, Freeman is completely convincing as the President, even
when he is mouthing platitudes like, "Life will go on; we will prevail," with
all the certainty of a man who doesn't want to get caught with his britches
down.</P>
<P>When the news finally breaks, the President unveils a plan to send a space
probe to the comet and blow it to pieces with nukes (gee, where have we heard
that plan before?).  This is, of course, Plot Thread Three.  The probe, named
the Messiah, is piloted by "the last man to walk on the moon", astronaut
Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall).  There's a moment where Tanner seems to be
at odds with his crew -- "They're not afraid of death -- just looking bad on
TV" --        but nothing much is made of it; I suspect either the film or the
script was originally much longer, and many of the emotional subtexts for
such scenes is missing.</P>
<P>This seems to be the heart of the problem with the movie: it doesn't convince
us that the planet is really at stake.  Sure, there's panic and looting and
people boarding up their windows.  There's a truly jaw-dropping (unfaked) shot
of an interstate highway crammed with refugees.  At least we don't get the
obligatory shots of the wild-eyed street-corner preacher with the sign reading
THE END IS NIGH.</P>
<P>But... somehow... there's an additional emotional level to all of this that
seems to be missing.  The script tries to make up for it rather ham-handedly
through some synthetic heart-tugs.  One is Lerner's estranged parents, and
another -- so unconvincing it almost sinks the movie singlehandedly -- is Leo
and his girlfriend, a plot thread which starts well but rapdily degenerates
into something out of "For The Love of Benji", with kids scrambling tearfully
through the wilderness on mopeds.</P>
<P>When disaster finally strikes, the movie's messages are even more confused.
Are we supposed to sit aghast at the destruction, or point at the screen and
go, "Oo, cool!  They blew away the Brookyn Bridge!"  The effects show at the
end belies the movie's intentions -- not because it's there, but because it
doesn't know how to show what's going on except in terms of shopworn disaster-
movie cliches -- people pointing, screaming, running, buildings falling over,
etc.  What emotional involvement we've built with the movie is tossed in favor
of a money shot; a CGI-driven End Times Porn.  And then we get the conclusion,
in which the filmmakers cleverly cheat the story and pull not one but two
endings out of their hat.</P>
<P>What would have worked here?  I'm not sure.  Part of the problem is the movie
is an uneasy alliance of two stories -- serious studies of human beings faced
with hopeless situations like "The Day After" or "The Sacrifice", and
spectacle- effects movies like, yes, "Armageddon".  Somewhere along the line
they should have just picked one track and stuck with it to the bitter end.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong.  This isn't a bad movie.  It's professional-looking,
relatively well-acted, and fast-moving (courtesy of Mimi Leder's fluid
direction).  I guess the big problem is that "Armageddon" makes it look like a
masterpiece, when it just isn't.</P>
