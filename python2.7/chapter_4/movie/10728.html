<PRE>                           Great Expectations</PRE>
<P>It was indeed with great expectation that I looked forward to seeing
this newest version of Dickens' classic story.    In the past there
have been several films that with varying success tried to capture
that great work.  52 years ago, with a great cast consisting in part
of John Mills, Alec Guiness, Valerie Hobson, and Jean Simmons, David
Lean directed perhaps the best of all..   In 1988, BBC did an
admirable TV version.  A year later, there was an excellent
mini-series made in Britain that starred Anthony Hopkins, Jean
Simmons, John Rhys-Davies, Ray McAnally,  and Kim Thompson, directed
by Kevin O'Connor.  Pretty much of a disaster was the 1983 animated
version directed by Jean Tych. ThE 1987 GREAT EXPECTATIONS ---THE
UNTOLD STORY was the worst of all.</P>
<P> We come now to this new attempt..   Perhaps taking a cue from the
modern Romeo and Juliet of 2 years ago,  the well-known producer Art
Linson decided to make an updated GREAT EXPECTATIONS.  A big
mistake.    Too many changes had to be made in the plot so that it
no longer resembled the Dickens work. Despite that the credits list
"Based On The Charles Dickens classic" or words to that effect,.
Dickens would have been horrified with the result.</P>
<P> Perhaps the only element common to both the book and the current
film scripted by Mitch Glazer,  is that both rely on the themes of
trying to obtain respect, the aspect of coincidence, and wanting
things one could not have.   While the Dickens story is very much
concerned with the conflict between the rich and the poor, the
commoner and the aristocracy, Glazer opted to delete that part
"because it didn't have to be about that at all."    Really?!?</P>
<P>As screenwriter Glazer did not want to do a literal remake of the
novel (Then why use the book's name?  Why say "based on the book by
Dickens?)  he even changed the names of all the characters except
for Estella.   One of the charms of reading  Dickens  is  the unique
names he gave his characters.  Glazer did not think "Magwitch" and
"Miss Haversham" were suitable names for this version.</P>
<P> The story, you will recall, is of an 8-year-old, Finn Bell
becoming a man (Ethan Hawke), his life being changed by three
people.    They are convict Lustig (Robert De Niro) and Ms. Dinsmoor
(Anne Bancroft) and Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow.)</P>
<P> When the young Finn (Jeremy James Kissner) meets the beautiful
Estella (Raquel Beaudene), they are both 10-years-old.   Ms.
Dinsmoor warns Finnegan that Estella will break his heart and even
if he is warned, he will pay no heed.  And that is what happens.
She runs off with someone else; he turns to painting and becomes
famous.   The film ends in a corny and unbelievable scene.</P>
<P> De Niro is the one redeeming feature.  Others in the cast include
Hank Azaria, Chris Cooper, Josh Mostel, Kim Dickens.</P>
<PRE>                    Directed by Alfonso Cuaron.</PRE>
