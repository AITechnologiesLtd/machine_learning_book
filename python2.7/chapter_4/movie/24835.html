<PRE>Mission Impossible II (2000)</PRE>
<P>Watching John Woo's Mission Impossible II, I took note of a good deal of the 
fascinating images and remembered again why visual texts are taking the 
place of written ones.  These violent shots are so well choreographed and 
slick that it is hard not to feast on them as if they were the most tempting 
of junk foods.  The scenes of chasing and fighting in this film are nearly 
as ballet-like as many scenes in The Matrix;  as a matter of fact, in an odd 
nod, the hero and villain in MI2 actually go airborne, their bodies 
colliding like those of Neo and his nemesis.</P>
<P>What this is leading up to is not a lecture but an observation:  a picture 
is not worth a thousand words; it is not worth even one.</P>
<P>What's the foundation to this argument?  We are discussing entertainment 
here.  And the images in modern action flicks move too quickly to digest and 
assimilate while we are watching the flick in the theater for probably the 
first and only time.  There are even gaping holes in the exposition: what is 
the IMF agency and what are Ethan Hunt's incentives to be such a big part of 
it?  Does he have a personal life, and what else does he do for relaxation 
beside the extremest of extreme sports?  Clearly the only scenes of 
character development are the briefest of glimpses of personalities, and all 
of these come second to the all-important fast pace of the plot.</P>
<P>Director John Woo and screenwriter Robert Towne include some nice variations 
on the premise of the old television series.  This time Hunt sees and hears 
about his mission from a pair of high-tech sunglasses, which he pitches away 
just as they `self-destruct.'  Recruiting a key member of his team for the 
mission is very difficult as well.  Hunt's boss Swanbeck (played by Anthony 
Hopkins) has stipulated that it must be the expert thief (but non-spy) Nyah 
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  What they are after is the ruthless thieves 
who have stolen the anti-virus for a synthetic monster bug.  Led by sometime 
IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), these men have murdered hundreds of 
people by crashing a jetliner in the Rockies.  The setup for Hunt and Nyah 
is that they must find out and steal back whatever they can.</P>
<P>Tom Cruise is the co-star of this film.  The other star is the action.  
Cruise's Ethan Hunt is even more polished and buffed than he was in Brian 
DePalma's Mission Impossible.  Cruise's acting is not really different than 
his previous films.  He gets better at it the more times he tries it, but 
the man's range is not wide; he mostly reacts.  What makes his performance 
strong here is his physicality: leaps and kicks and last-second recoveries 
that are a pleasure to watch. Again, thanks to Woo, Cruise has been told 
exactly what to do, and the magic men of dubbing and editing and special 
effects do the rest.</P>
<P>One dimension of  Hunt's character that viewers find endearing is his 
compassion.  Whereas the agent-gone-evil Sean Ambrose takes lives with 
impunity, Hunt hesitates `to harm a hair on a security guard's head.'  For 
putting a value on human life, Hunt acts ironically, beating up on enough of 
Ambrose's men to qualify him as a one-man army.  A cool aspect of Cruise's 
acrobatics is his dead-on marksmanship, his bullets finding their mark even 
when they are fired at the last millisecond, Hunt's body in mid-flip, upside 
down or just off the ground.</P>
<P>The other star?  This stuff is purely eye-candy, as impossible in real life 
as any James Bond stunt.  But when we see Ethan Hunt on his motorcycle, 
jumping and flying down a ramp and through the traces of flame left by an 
enemy's destroyed car, we are enrapt.  Simple fight scenes now require 
expertise in martial arts, and often it's like watching an aggressive dance 
in which the combatants come off the floor without bruises or even 
exhaustion.  Why can't we see at least one tooth being spat out of a bloody 
mouth?</P>
<P>As Nyah Nordoff-Hall, the professional thief, Thandie Newton plays it a 
little too simply.  After initial stubbornness and even an attack (by car) 
on Hunt, Nyah quickly goes down to Hunt's charm, and she smiles widely 
whenever he holds her in his arms.  Newton does, however, show spurts of 
very solid acting.</P>
<P>A motif we hear early – from the scientist who created the monster virus – 
is that for every hero, there has to be a villain, and this is clever not 
just because it is self-reflexive.  The sentiment calls up what we hold as 
important values in people: namely, Ethan Hunt's loyalty versus Sean 
Ambrose's betrayal.  Dougray Scott is very good at playing this baddie.  He 
adopts such nonchalance that we hate him without effort.  In a particularly 
suspenseful sequence, Ambrose anticipates Hunt's moves and motivations, 
attempting to thwart Hunt's destruction of the virus.  In a quietly menacing 
performance, Scott leads us to the inevitable confrontation between the two 
super-spies.  (One small problem I may as well mention here is that Ambrose 
-- as well as the movie -- employs too many uncannily accurate masks.)</P>
<P>Ving Rhames is back as the techie, Luther Stickell.  His is purely a support 
role, as he sits in the van with the computers, or fires shoulder-held 
rockets from a chopper piloted by an Australian helper, Billy.  Rhames is 
not given many lines, but his appearance is still authoritative and sure.</P>
<P>The score is mostly transparent.  There are some nice modernizations of the 
Mission: Impossible theme song.  But it's hard to tell if Hans Zimmer 
arranged them or composed variations, along with the original music.</P>
<P>I came out of the theater last night pleased with what I had seen.  But the 
more I think about it, the more I notice the dumbing down of movies.  
Anthony Hopkins must have noticed it when he had to read the line, `Her 
criminal record will be expunged, wiped out.'  This is just a small example 
of a lack of subtlety that, snowballing, will create outright insults to the 
intelligence.  Like books, movies come in various types; let's call them 
heavy watching and light watching.  What we are demanding from Hollywood is 
a large number of light watches – since this is late May, the equivalent of 
fluffy novels that can be read under a beach umbrella, books that require 
little if any real thought.  This is fine, of course.  It's just that I 
don't like a steady diet of junk.</P>
