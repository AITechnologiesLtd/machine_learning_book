<P>"The movies are so rarely great art, that if we can't
appreciate great trash, there is little reason for us to go"
- Pauline Kael</P>
<P>I don't entirely agree with Ms. Kael's pessimistic view, but it is 
the proper frame of mind when viewing something like Roger Kumble's 
Cruel Intentions. The film is a modern day version of Dangerous 
Liasons with upper class high school kids filling in for the main 
characters. While it's certainly no great peice of cinema, it's 
enormously entertaining.</P>
<P>Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) and Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) are 
stepsiblings who control the masses at their high school with their 
seductive wickedness. One day Sebastian reads a magazine article by 
the school headmaster's daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon) 
proclaiming how she is a virgin and plans to wait until marriage. 
Katherine bets him that he can't seduce her. If she wins, she gets 
his speedster. If he wins, he gets to have his way with her. Thus 
begins the sleazy games of sexual manipulation.</P>
<P>Kathryn tries to get revenge against a new student named Cecile, who 
stole her boyfriend away over summer break. She promises Cecile's 
momthat she will look after her goody two shoes daughter and keep her 
out of trouble. What she really does is attempt to turn her into a 
tramp and send incriminating evidence of it to her mother. Meanwhile, 
Sebastian begins to make his moves on Annette, but soon learns that 
she will not be a simple conquest. As played by Reese Witherspoon, 
she is more than resourceful and intelligent, and mere pick up lines 
or false gestures won't do the trick.</P>
<P>What I particularly liked was how the filmmakers didn't try to hide 
the film's trashy nature. Director Roger Kumble is a talented 
craftsman and he is smart enough not to underestimate his audience. 
Many films similar to Cruel Intentions have been made, but they were 
made without any real effort. The material here is executed so 
expertly it rises to a level of sophisticated sleaze.</P>
<P>Ryan Phillippe is a fine actor who brings the right amount of 
sexuality and vulnerability to his role. We must be able to beleive 
he could seduce all these women, and we also must buy the scenes in 
the 2nd half of the film where he begins to fall for Annette. 
Phillippe is able to pull both of these off perfectly. Even better is 
Reese Witherspoon, perhaps the most talented young actress working in 
Hollywood. She
balances innocent charm with sensuality. Another actress could be 
annoying in this role, but Reese is perfect. She makes it beleivable 
that her character would fall under Sebastian's spell without 
allowing her character to look like a moron in the process. And Sarah 
Michelle Gellar has a great time playing the evil wicked queen of her 
school who tries defend her innocent reputation while
manipulating the student body at the same time. </P>
<P>The technical credits are also superb. Special kudos to the art 
direction team for their view of the large, stylish homes in which 
these spoiled kids wage their battle of conquest. The films moves 
along at a brisk pace thanks to timely editing and a first-rate music 
score. I'm not sure I like the ending very much, but it works fine on 
it's own terms. I won't deny that the final shot is just perfect.</P>
