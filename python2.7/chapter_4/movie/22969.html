<P>JUDY BERLIN a film review by Athan Bezaitis.  Copyright filmcritic.com
2000</P>
<P>JUDY BERLIN has the unmistakable characteristics of a Woody Allen film
(though it's not one).  Its cerebral humor, rash characters, and
ensemble cast are gelled with a very Allenesque theme: that life has
simply passed by the small, predominantly Jewish community of Babylon,
Long Island.  First time director Eric Mendelsohn, who reportedly worked
with Allen on several films, shoots in black and white, and effectively
paints a dreary reality for the people of the small suburb.</P>
<P>As the story goes, it is the second day of school and the fall is in
full swing.  David Gold (Aaron Harnick) has returned to his parent's
home after spending time working in the film business in California.  He
runs into old high school classmate Judy Berlin (Edie Falco - from HBO's
Oz and The Sopranos), an outspoken yet dimwitted aspiring actress on her
way to Hollywood that very evening.  The story follows their respective
families as Judy and David spend the day reminiscing while a solar
eclipse darkens the town.</P>
<P>The real substance of the film lies in its characters and the stellar
cast.  Barbara Barrie (PRIVATE BENJAMIN) plays Sue Berlin, Judy's
mother, a stern schoolteacher who wears her problems in her forcefully
stoic face.  Madeline Kahn (YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN) is Alice Gold, a
recovering alcoholic who has alienated her son David and her husband
Arthur (Bob Dishy).  Best known for her comedic roles, Kahn (recently
deceased) puts on an Oscar-worthy performance as a mother who has
awakened from a mysterious slumber caused by the eclipse, discovering
she is an embittered housewife with a dismal existence.  Her portrayal
exudes a sad sincerity with her nasal voice and methodical stroll, but
manages to stay light and funny as Kahn weaves her magic.  Finally,
Julie Kavner (best known for her voice as Marge Simpson) adds an extra
dose of laughter into the mix with some great one-liners.</P>
<P>Worthy of much praise is Mendelsohn, who manages to twist an average
suburban town into a strange and majestic place filled with dark and
unexpected imagery.  The film is definitely "artsy" and heavily
symbol-laden via the eclipse and the setting in "Babylon," a stark
contrast from the thriving Biblical polis.</P>
<P>Despite its endearing qualities, the film has its flaws, especially the
blaring harpsichord score, which serves as musical interlude.  Also, I
found the character of Judy Berlin to be too unbelievable -- everything
from her zaniness to the railroad-looking "adult braces" she was
wearing.</P>
<P>Overall, the film is a score for Mendelsohn, who should get plenty of
opportunity to establish himself as tour de force director in Hollywood.</P>
