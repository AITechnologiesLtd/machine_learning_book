<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Cost of Living is a modern noir film that does not use the familiar plot
devices of that genre as it usually is used, instead devoting the entire
film to studying one character and her reactions to being on the run.
Her name is Billie (Falco). She is a loner, scam artist, drifter,
taciturn, independent woman, who is dressed biker-style. It is the type
of role usually played by a man. The film might be about trying to find
oneself, or about why you are going to a fishing village if you're not
interested in fishing. The most profound line said by anyone in the film
is said by Edie Falco: "Things are not always what they seem- Ben!"</P>
<P>We learn whatever it is that we are going to learn about her through her
actions. She dumps her motorcycle over a cliff into the water. Meets a
guy who says he knows her from a Texas town, who claims they met when it
was hailing. She tells him that he's mistaken. Somehow she gets a car
(probably steals it) and through working a scam gets a fake auto
license. She then checks into a motel and stashes four thousand dollars
under the rug. Her main antagonist is a scruffy fisherman, Ben
(Villemaire), who has a foul-mouth and treats women like dirt. He
smashes into her with his pickup truck and ends up having sex with her,
tieing her to the steering wheel of her car, where she remains all
night. They form a love-hate relationship.</P>
<P>When she returns to her motel room, the money's gone. She blames Ben.
Goes to a diner, eats like a horse and befriends the waitress (Caitlin
Clarke) into letting her skip out without paying. There's also a lonely
mechanic, a friend of Ben,  named Ted, who has a crush on her, but is
too awkward to ever say the things that would stir a lady's heart. A
mysterious biker comes to the fishing village looking for her, aptly
describing her tattoo. He says she's his wife.</P>
<P>The action takes place in an impoverished fishing village. The dialogue
is muted. The film yearns to be a story about how impossible it is to be
free in today's world and how everything one does hurts. It's different
in mood and scope than the usual type of introspective film. The film
hinges on Falco's performance. I didn't buy it, so I failed to find the
film engrossing. She seemed to be acting too hard to look as if she was
loose and free. At the end of the film, we don't know too much more
about her than we did at the beginning of the film. If you are looking
for possible plusses in this hip neo-noir film, it might be in the
director's visualizations. At least, this indie is original and is not
the usual rip off you see of late.</P>
<P>It should be noted it won Studio Prize for Best Feature Film in New
Visions Section at the 1997 AFI/Los Angeles Film Festival. It should
also be noted that I had trouble reading the opening credits. They
were unclear on the video I watched. But what remained more unclear to
me, was what this film was about. It was not a paricularly pleasant
film to watch, and the violence in it, seemed misplaced. I had no feel
for those in the film, therefore seeing the violence was much like
reading a newspaper account of a tragedy occurring to strangers.</P>
