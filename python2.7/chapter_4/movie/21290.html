<P>IN SHORT: Perfectly average one joke pony.</P>
<P>Cranky had such a wretched day today that all I wanted was an average
popcorn lightweight flick to make him giggle and make him forget all the
crap that had rained down on him all day long. Three to Tango looked to
be the film that I hoped for, a teevee type comedy with stars I happen
to like.</P>
<P>Be careful what you wish for 'cuz when you get it, it may prove to be
far from enough. Using innuendo, double entendre and overheard
conversations as a driving force for a story of mistaken sexual identity
may work on paper, but it doesn't come off much better than any smarmy
teevee sitcom on Fox (which isn't responsible for this flick). Mix
briskly with as much below the belt humor as you can dream up and it
lays out like this:</P>
<P>Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are up
and coming architects (as in please give me this job 'cuz we don't want
to be designing toilets) in the Windy City. They are in fierce
competition with another firm for a $90 million dollar contract to build
a cultural center. The man in charge, zillionaire Charles Newman (Dylan
McDermott) keeps a hot piece on the side, professional glassblower Amy
Post (Neve Campbell). Believing Oscar to be gay, Charles enlists Oscar's
unwilling aid to keep tabs on his babe who he fears may fall back into
the arms of former beau, and professional football, player Kevin
Cartwright (Cylk Cozart). Why does Charles believe the very straight
Oscar to be swishy? See paragraph above.</P>
<P>Oscar and Amy fall at first sight After a long night's talk, and what
feels like half an hour of pratfalls and slapstick gags, all the lovely
first overtures that befit true love leave the pair apart. After which
lover-boy tells girl-on-the side that potential-new-boyfriend prefers
the Other Side of the Force. From there on in its an escalating
masquerade as word gets out, the newspapers out straight-man and a gay
pride professional organization named him Man of the Year.</P>
<P>Gee, what's Oscar to do? On one hand, a $90 million dollar contract. On
the other, a woman who is untouchable in almost every sense of the word,
but not to his (or her) heart. I wanted a lightweight comedy. I got a
lightweight comedy, with more variations on "is he or isn't he" than I
could ever imagine. But, then again, I thought Double Jeopardy was only
fit for teevee and it's been number one at the box office for a month.
So what the hell do I know?</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Three to Tango, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Three to Tango is probably an OK dateflick if there's absolutely nothing
else of interest to you. It's a curl up and rent flick by this boy.</P>
<PRE>And, no, I'm not.</PRE>
