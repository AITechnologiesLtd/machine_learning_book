<P>     After opening exclusively in New York in late November 1994, the
new Alan Rudolph film, MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is
beginning to get a wider, if somewhat restricted, distribution, and has
opened here in Toronto during the Xmas weekend.</P>
<P>     Filmed in Montreal, MRS. PARKER is a loosely biographical film
dealing with the writer Dorothy Parker, who entertained America in the
1920s  with her sharp tongue and witticisms, and her follies with what
became known as the Algonquin Round Table, a group of friends and
colleagues who would dine daily at the Algonquin in New York and trade
verbal barbs and amused chatterings.  This group would encompass some
of the most influential figures on American culture of their time.</P>
<P>     If you're looking for an upbeat feel-good comedy, this is likely a
film you would want to stay away from.  As Dorothy Parker's life is
revealed through a series of flashbacks, swapping between her youth and
her old age, it is revealed that behind her banter and sly wit lay
sorrow, despair, self-consciousness and perpetual depression.  We
cringe in the audience as we watch Parker desperately enter futile
relationship after relationship, thus perpetuating the cycle of her
misery, and we morosely watch the elderly Parker, a shadow of her
former self, react with regret and grief on actions unfulfilled and
love unconsummated.</P>
<P>     The young ensemble cast is very solid in MRS. PARKER in their
limited roles, but the three major characters featured in the film are
Dorothy Parker (Leigh), Robert Benchley (Scott), and Charles MacArthur
(Broderick).  Broderick is fine as one of Parker's loves, and Campbell
Scott is outstanding in a potential break-out performance as Parker's
confidant and soulmate--physically, in this film he mildly resembles a
dapper Patrick Bergen--but by and large, this film is a vehicle for
Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is in virtually every scene.</P>
<P>     Much has been said in the press and the newsgroups about how
Leigh's rendition of Parker's slurred, grating voice has rendered much
of her dialogue incomprehensible, but honestly, I did not encounter
this problem at all.  It may be a function of the theatre speakers and
background noise (i.e., viewers talking) that may compound the difficulty
for some, but in general her words are understandable, if mildly
challenging.  In any case, her version sounds so true to the original
that one must give her points for trying.</P>
<P>     Dorothy Parker, as depicted in this film, is a well-suited entry
in Leigh's catalog of downbeat, dark, and quirky characters, and while
she is capable in the role, it is a mild disappointment that, save for
the inflection, she did not stretch much further for it.  Many of
Leigh's own characteristic performance ticks can be seen in the film,
but it may due to the character's lack of range in the screenplay that
this becomes obvious.  Nonetheless, Leigh will probably get serious
Oscar consideration, since this is one of very few high-profile
dominant female roles of the year, and her other work has been
critically accepted.</P>
<P>     MRS. PARKER suffers from some significant pacing problems and at
times seems too choppy and uneven.  The film lurches between the two
timelines, and while what's depicted on-screen is done well, it only
gives the audience a voyeuristic glance into scenes from Parker's life,
and doesn't flesh out the characters sufficiently.  The conclusion of
the film seems to come rather abruptly, and some scenes in the movie
tend to be a bit overlong in bringing their significance to point.  The
humour is a hit-and-miss affair; some points are roaringly funny, while
other jabs provide nary a chuckle.  The costumes (by John Hay) and
production design (by Francois Seguin) are first rate, and the period
score, though appropriate, is slightly overprominent and becomes
grating at times.</P>
<P>     Though the screenplay could have probably undergone a bit more
revision, it is nonetheless very effective in its ultimate portrayal of
Parker as a tragic figure.  While those with no familiarity or interest
in Dorothy Parker may be disenchanted, the combination of this
unfortunate soul in American history with an excellent ensemble cast
makes MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE a haunting little film.  On
my four-star scale, I give this a two-and-a-half.</P>
<P>Note:  There is one scene that is shown after the credits have begun to
       roll, so one may want to remain for that scene to complete before
       leaving.  Incidentally, Leigh's half-sister, Mina Badie, has a
       minor speaking part in this film.</P>
