<PRE>                                 SHADOWLANDS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger, Edward Hardwicke,
           Joseph Mazzello.
Screenplay:  William Nicholson.
Director:  Richard Attenborough.</P>
<P>     If Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger aren't careful, they're likely
to knock themselves out of contention for Academy Award nominations by
doing too much excellent work in one year.  Hopkins has received
much-deserved accolades and several critics' awards for his role in THE
REMAINS OF THE DAY, while Winger has been nominated for a Golden Globe
for her performance in A DANGEROUS WOMAN.  Now the two talented actors
are paired in Richard Attenborough's SHADOWLANDS, and the result is
stunning.  This moving, intelligent love story provides Winger with her
best role in a decade, and Hopkins with a chance to add the second best
male performance of 1993 to a resume which already includes the best.</P>
<P>     SHADOWLANDS, adapted by William Nicholson from his own fact-based
stage play, focuses on renowned English author and scholar C. S. Lewis
(Hopkins), known by his friends as Jack.  It is 1952, and Jack is
living an orderly, sheltered life as an Oxford don and sharing a house
with his brother Warnie (Edward Hardwicke).  Into this life walks Joy
Davidman Gresham (Winger), a brash American poet who has been
corresponding with Jack.  Her honesty immediately captures Jack's
fancy, and the two strike up a close friendship.  When Joy and her son
(Joseph Mazzello) relocate to London after Joy's divorce, that
friendship becomes a marriage of convenience, which in turn becomes a
chance for Jack to experience a love which his fears had always denied
him.</P>
<P>     This is the second time SHADOWLANDS has been committed to film
(the first in 1985 with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom in the leads),
but this version is certain to become definitive.  Nicholson's play is
a winner, and he has written a sparkling adaptation.  The verbal
sparring between Lewis and Joy is wonderful, the best this year not
written by William Shakespeare.  It's the kind of love story Hollywood
just doesn't turn out all that often, a simple but affecting
examination of the ability of love to transform, and to make life's
pain bearable.  Lewis himself wrote about the experience in the
philosophical work A GRIEF OBSERVED, and that is the tone SHADOWLANDS
adopts:  introspective and restrained, yet still deeply felt.  The
score by John Fenton is non-intrusive, and some of the film's most
potent emotional moments are almost completely silent.  It's an
extremely deft piece of filmmaking by Attenborough, a director best
known for epics like GANDHI but equally skilled at personal moments.</P>
<P>     And it doesn't hurt that his two leads give Oscar-worthy
performances.  Anthony Hopkins' Jack Lewis begins much like his Stevens
the butler from REMAINS, a reserved and guarded man blind to his own
feelings; this time, however, he gets to undergo a real
transformation.  He laughs, he cries, he even finds himself completely
flustered by room service.  Once again Hopkins demonstrates the rare
ability to act with his entire body, turning an aborted wave to a
departing cab into a rich visual text.  However, SHADOWLANDS would have
come up short if Joy had not been equally well-handled, and Debra
Winger proves well up to the challenge.  Winger sparkles as she prods
and tests Jack, refusing to let him rest in his self-imposed cocoon.
There is strength, intelligence, savage wit and deep emotion in her
performance, and she somehow manages to steal scenes from one of the
finest screen actors in the world.  Winger has been seen far too
infrequently in recent years, but it would appear SHADOWLANDS is likely
to correct that oversight.</P>
<P>     SHADOWLANDS was well on its way to being a "10" before it lost
steam in the last half hour.  The third act drags on some, and a late
scene in which a glycerine teardrop dangles in physics-defying fashion
from Joseph Mazzello's eye pushed by cynic button.  Still, SHADOWLANDS
ranks among the best films of 1993, artistic and profoundly emotional.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shadowlands:  9.</PRE>
