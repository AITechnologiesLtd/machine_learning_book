<P>The characters in "Down to You" are stupid, all right, but at least they're 
more convincingly ALIVE than most young folks in American movies. These are 
college-age kids in a cutesy romantic comedy who screw, drink, smoke tobacco 
and pot, are familiar with music that came out before the invention of the 
CD, and have detailed discussions about pornography. None of this is 
presented as risque, as it was in "American Pie" -- it's seen as normal.</P>
<P>That's refreshing. The rest of the movie is pretty lame. Freddie Prinze Jr, 
from last summer's teen romance "She's All That", plays the guy, Al. Julia 
Stiles, from last summer's teen romance "10 Things I Hate About You", plays 
the girl, Imogen. They fall in love, break up, and fall in love again. The 
end.</P>
<P>The vices of the characters and texture of the atmosphere make "Down to You" 
watchable -- I know that kids from the USA aren't as hard-edged as youngsters 
from this side of the pond, but surely they can't be the bland, non-alcoholic 
virgins that most teen flicks make them out to be. The downside of the movie 
is the way it frames its story in retrospect, with embarrassing 
direct-to-camera interview-style dissections of what's going on onscreen, and 
a voice-over narration that treats a typical Hollywood love story as 
something Really Important. Woody Allen can get away with that, because his 
screenplays offer witty insights and entertaining self-obsession. Here it's 
gimmicky and annoying.</P>
<P>What I will remember about seeing the film is that the group of young girls 
in front of me thought I was Freddie Prinze Jr. Every time a close-up of the 
star filled the screen, one of them would turn around, make eye contact with 
me, then shoot round again, whispering "It's him, it's him!" to another. When 
his name appeared in the end credits, a couple of them said it to themselves, 
as if making a mental note. I dimmed the lights when I got home, and checked 
my reflection in the mirror, and yeah, I can sort of see a resemblance. 
Similar cheekbones, similar hair (on that day), et cetera. But I don't look 
like him all that much, really, and I hope the girls didn't see me in the 
light. I wouldn't want to spoil their illusion.</P>
