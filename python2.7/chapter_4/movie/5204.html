<PRE>                             PACIFIC HEIGHTS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        With PACIFIC HEIGHTS, screenwriter Daniel Pyne has shot himself in
the foot by destroying a promising premise with two frustratingly idiotic
characters.  Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine play a cute (but fatally
dumb) couple who buy a decrepit Victorian house in Pacific Heights and sink
all of their savings into restoring it.  However, the only way they can
afford their dream house, which is located in San Francisco's ritziest
neighborhood, is to rent out the rooms on the ground floor.  A devious con
man (Michael Keaton) maneuvers his way into one of the apartments and sets
into motion a fiendish plot to ruin their lives, their home, and their
credit rating.</P>
<P>        PACIFIC HEIGHTS blows its chance to be a stirring and compelling
psychological thriller.  Keaton, playing a frighteningly sinister
sociopath, holds up his end of the deal with a penetrating performance.
Guilty of excessively self-conscious direction, director John Schlesinger
lets the movie slip away from him.  He doesn't receive any help from Pyne's
hopelessly inept screenplay.  Griffith and ESPECIALLY Modine are so
excruciatingly stupid that you quickly lose all sympathy for them, even
though their predicament is tragic.  It gets to the point where you even
root against them.  The young couple makes one mistake after another and
blindly walks into traps that you can see from miles away.  If the
protagonists showed even a shred of intelligence, Keaton's scheme would
collapse like a house of straw in a tornado.  PACIFIC HEIGHTS is a
resounding disappointment.</P>
