<P>         In the world of director Oliver Stone, a slap sounds like a
crack of thunder and a tackle like a building being imploded.
High-decibel jams by DMX, Moby and Kid Rock underscore almost
everything. The camera constantly jerks and weaves, frantically trying
to determine where the action is.</P>
<P> The screen is cluttered with overlapping images and double
exposures. And, to be heard at all, dialogue must be shouted. That's
what you get -- for a full three hours -- in "Any Given Sunday," Stone's
tribute to the seamy institution we call professional football.</P>
<P> It's a movie designed to bruise the eyes and ears, which it
does, thanks to Stone's sheer force of will and a team of editors that
turn even the most mundane moments into sonic and visual cacophony. When
coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino, making up for his restrained performance
in "The Insider" by bellowing and howling at every opportunity) tries to
reason with headstrong young quarterback Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx), the
conversation is intercut with shots of storm clouds gathering, bits of
grainy black-and-white football films and clips of Charlton Heston in
"Ben Hur."
Take away the bravado and flashiness, however, and "Sunday" reveals
itself as a surprisingly conventional drama plagued with many of the
same problems that have burdened Stone's other work.</P>
<P> Again, he teaches us there are three kinds of women: the
heartless, scheming harpy, a la Daryl Hannah in "Wall Street"
(represented here by Cameron Diaz as Miami Sharks owner Christina
Pagniacci); the worn-out nag, along the lines of Sissy Spacek in "JFK"
(in this case, it's Ann-Margret as Christina's bitter, cocktail-swilling
mom); and the eager prostitute/groupie who lurks on the sidelines,
waiting to ambush her man when his defenses are down (too many examples
to note). The only exception in the film is a cipher named Vanessa (Lela
Rochon), who steadfastly stands by Beaman until he becomes a star, then
jumps off the gravy train and disappears from the story.</P>
<P> The men here don't fare much better, since Stone and co-author
John Logan have written them as concepts rather than as characters.
D'Amato is the die-hard veteran struggling to hold on to his place in a
changing world and to secure a place for his buddy Jack "Cap" Rooney
(Dennis Quaid), an aging quarterback whose body and spirit are rapidly
deteriorating. Beaman starts off as a bright-eyed kid from a religious
home, then turns almost immediately into a fatuous egotist who gives
self-adoring interviews and records an awful rap CD.</P>
<P> Lightening up the high-pressure atmosphere a bit are John C.
McGinley as a desperate-to-be-hip sportscaster and James Woods as
Harvey, a devious team orthopedist who's all too happy to pump up the
players with painkillers in the name of the game. "What the hell's next?
" Harvey groans, as he adds up the various injuries incurred by the
Sharks during one tumultuous game. "Stigmata?"</P>
<P> The conflicts and crises that erupt when these people are
thrown together against a background of politics, lucrative endorsement
deals, free drugs and expensive call girls are mostly what you'd expect,
and although Stone and Logan's melodrama reeks with in-your-face style
(D'Amato and Christina are always telling people to "pump up the
volume," and Stone cheerfully complies), it's definitely on the shallow
side. When pressed to say what has changed football from an all-American
game into the sleazy business it is today, Stone feebly points a finger
at television as the culprit, then wriggles away from the question. His
explanation for Christina's strident show-me-the-money attitude is even
lamer: It turns out her late daddy always wanted a son, so she's done
her best to deny her femininity.</P>
<P> Despite such lazy scripting and two-dimensional characters,
"Sunday" is often engrossing nonetheless, simply because Stone is too
much of a showman to put on a second-rate circus. Much of the action on
the field is spectacularly staged and brilliantly cut together, and the
volatile match-up of Diaz and Pacino makes the fights between Christina
and D'Amato exciting to follow.</P>
<P> The one thing all the flamboyance can't cover up is the story's
complete lack of any emotional impact whatsoever. In Stone's domain,
anything that's not loud, bright, fast or flashy never gets into the
game. This is an arena for gladiators, and mere human beings belong on
the bench. James Sanford</P>
