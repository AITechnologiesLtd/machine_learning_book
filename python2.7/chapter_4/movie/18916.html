<P>(Dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film is also known by the English title "Days and Nights in
the Forest".</P>
<P>Trying to escape the pressures of their daily lives, four young men
embark on a vacation to the rural forest. They are unsure what to
expect, but they are eager to be able to focus on their adventure
into the unknown. The leader of the group is Ashim (Soumitra
Chatterjee). Sanjoy (Subhendu Chatterjee) is a docile office worker
who rarely stands up or takes risks. It is not that he is a coward,
but rather he always plays it safe. The ill-tempered Hari (Samit
Bhanja) was recently jilted by his girlfriend, and as a result has
some open issues to resolve. Finally, there is Shekhar (Robi Ghosh)
who is self-confident and earnest, but often so much so that he is
comical. The journey into the unknown of the forest unintentionally
becomes a journey of self-discovery, as the decisions they make and
the lessons they learn will change them.</P>
<P>The first decision they must make is in their accommodations. Being
carefree young men, they have neglected to make any plans. The come
across a rest house that suits their needs, but since they have not
made reservations, they must bribe the caretaker in order to stay
there. The caretaker knows he is risking his job, but his wife is
ill and so he is in desperate need of the money. At the rural tavern,
they stop for a drink, and encounter some of the people of the forest.
They particularly notice the women who have no taboos about drinking
in public like the women of the city would. Hari in particular is
drawn to one of them, Duli (Simi Garewal), whose untamed quality
enhances her appeal. The other men are more interested in the two
obviously civilized women they chance to see walking near their
bungalow one day. After following them to their cottage, they find
that the women are also visitors to the forest. Aparna (Sharmila
Tagore) is a strong, self-assured young woman who is staying in the
vacation house with her father and widowed sister-in-law, Jaya
(Kaberi Bose). What begins as casual social interaction between the
men and the women eventually becomes more serious as they come to
understand each other better. Although the men's interests often
lead to funny, awkward situations, there are serious issues just
beneath the surface.</P>
<P>Although it might appear to be a familiar premise, Satyajit Ray
takes the story (written by Sunil Ganguli) and fashions an
engrossing film. It is obvious that as the men enter the unknown
surroundings and encounter new people, their reactions will be
reflections of their own character. This is not a new approach, but
what makes the story powerful is the unpredictability of the
narrative, and the development of the characters. None of the
characters are be slotted into a stereotype for easy digestion, and
the eventual turn of events are not telegraphed. From an early point,
the viewer gets immersed in the characters. Just as the characters
stumble around to make sense of their situations, the viewer closely
follows their actions. The most engaging episodes are when the men
interact with the women, and the contortions they go through in
their potentially romantic pursuits. Since a primary component of
the story is this interaction, and because there is not a matching
number (four men versus three women), it is clear that the story
progression will not be a simplistic pairing off into couples.</P>
<P>The situations presented to the men are varied, and as the story
progresses they become more serious and dramatic. However, the
narrative keeps from becoming overly tense by the timely and
effective use of humor. One particular scene involves the men being
caught in an embarrassing position when the women unexpected drop
by while they are bathing at a well. The structure of the comedy is
simple and pure, and although the setup may sound stereotypical,
the flawless execution makes it a particularly hilarious moment.</P>
<P>Of the four young men, Shekhar is the only character whose inner
self is not examined. His heightened earnestness makes him a comic
character, but Ghosh plays him perfectly so he does not become
glaringly exaggerated. Striking this balance make it the standout
performance. The other characters have differing degrees of
complexity, but they are all handled well.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This is both a powerful and entertaining film.
There is both intense drama and light comedy. The story focuses
on the many characters and develops them fully.</P>
