<P>     1988's WINGS OF DESIRE was an excellent example of a true "art
film," with the medium of cinema used as a canvas by a director (Wim
Wenders, in this case).  WINGS OF DESIRE was a provocative, evocative
look at life, love, and humanity that was at times spiritually
elevating and at others pretentious and silly.  At the conclusion of
the movie, we were promised a sequel, but it has taken six years for
the next chapter, FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! to begin creeping its away across
U.S. screens.</P>
<P>     As FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! opens, Cassiel (Otto Sander) is still an
angel, gazing down on humanity in the company of the equally celestial
Raphaela (Nastassja Kinski).  He doesn't keep his wings for long,
however, as he allows himself to become human to save the life of a
girl who has fallen from a high-rise balcony.  Cassiel is quickly
reunited with former angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz), who now has a family
and is running a pizza parlor.  But the transition from immortal to
human isn't as easy for Cassiel as it was for his friend, and he soon
becomes involved with an underworld kingpin (Horst Buchholz).
Meanwhile, a mysterious entity by the name of Emit Flesti (Willem
Dafoe--spell the character's name backwards) stalks Cassiel.</P>
<P>     FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! begins very much as WINGS OF DESIRE did, with a
pair of angels watching the lives of various mortals.  Whereas this
portion of the first movie made up the bulk of the running time, in the
sequel, it's merely a prologue.  Before the first half-hour is up,
Cassiel has become human and we're watching as he struggles to
comprehend what has happened to him.</P>
<P>     As Wings was Damiel's story, so FARAWAY is Cassiel's.  This is not
the light, mystical romance of its predecessor, but a somewhat muddled
narrative that ends up resembling an offbeat action/adventure movie.
It's still a film about issues--humanity, the soul, time, and
Nazism--but it lacks many of the "art" aspect of WINGS, relying more on
straightforward storytelling.</P>
<P>     There's a lot about the climactic struggle that doesn't work.
Even though we aren't given a heavy dose of Hollywood-type violence,
the sequence seems wrong not only for the film, but for the series as a
whole.  Anyone watching the beginning of Wings will find it difficult
to come to grips with this as the story's culmination.</P>
<P>     The cast is excellent.  It's nice to see Bruno Ganz and Solveig
Dommartin (Marion) together again, although their importance is greatly
reduced from Wings.  Obviously, Otto Sander has the most difficult
role, and he carries it out impeccably.  Peter Falk is back as a
somewhat satirized version of himself, and Lou Reed and Mikhail
Gorbachev make cameos.  Horst Buchholz plays his role as the
American-type gangster with relish, and Willem Dafoe is suitably creepy
in an ambiguous, and largely unexplained, part.</P>
<P>     Even though this movie is in many ways more straightforward than
the original, it is still likely to appeal only to a select audience.
Mr. Wenders has intentionally taken FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! down a
different path from WINGS OF DESIRE.  The characters are the same, but
the circumstances are often vastly different, as are the methods of
storytelling.  In some cases, the changes are right on the
mark--there's no need to re-hash what's already been done--but there
are other occasions when Mr. Wenders comes dangerously close to
self-parody.</P>
<P>     About the only thing I can say regarding a recommendation is that
a viewing of WINGS OF DESIRE is almost mandatory before seeing FARAWAY,
SO CLOSE!  Going into this film without the background of its
predecessor will leave a movie-goer adrift and confused.  On the other
hand, sitting through WINGS OF DESIRE doesn't guarantee enjoyment of
the sequel (in fact, many fans of the first will probably be sorely
disappointed by the turn that this script takes), but going cold into
FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! will almost certainly lead to a negative
experience.</P>
