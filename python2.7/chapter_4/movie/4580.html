<PRE>                             LEAVING LAS VEGAS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A prostitute and an alcoholic have a
          relationship in the short time while the alcoholic
          intentionally drinks himself to death.  The story
          is downbeat, but it is also a moving study of the
          both love and self-destruction.  There is more than
          a little of the George/Lenny relationship of OF
          MICE AND MEN in this story.  Stand-out performances
          by Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue make this one
          of the better films this year.  Rating: low +3 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     LEAVING LAS VEGAS is about people on the margins of society.  That
has been done before in films like BARFLY, but it perhaps has never
been done as well as in this film.</P>
<P>     Ben Sanderson (Nicholas Cage) has gone from being a film executive
who drinks too much to a drunk who cannot do anything for a living or
even to save his own life.  Alcohol has replaced his wife, his son, and
now his job.  So he has decided to treat his alcoholism as a fatal
disease, has literally burned the remnant of his previous life behind
him, and has gone to Las Vegas to die in a spree of drinking and
possibly some high living.  Almost immediately on arriving he runs into
(almost literally) prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue).  When he sees her
again he hires her but chooses to just talk, telling her his plan to
drink himself to death.  Seeing that he needs care and desperately
needing someone to care about she strikes up a relationship,
overlooking his indifference.  The one ground rule they set is that
neither will try to reform the other.  In a year with many films about
relationships, this is one of the most unique.  At times they relate as
lovers, friends, mother and child, prostitute and pimp, nurse and dying
patient.  Rare is the film where we see so many aspects of a
relationship, or so many different sorts of love.  Why Sera is even
interested in the heartache of falling in love with a man committing
slow-motion suicide is the enigma at the heart of this film.</P>
<P>     Stylistically the film is well-handled although perhaps a bit
slow-paced for some viewers, though those viewers would be unlikely to
come to this film in any case.  One false style move is to have Sera's
character developed by having her open her heart to her analyst.  It is
becoming too easy and too much a cliche to have people in disreputable
professions able to open up only to their analysts like the prostitute
in KLUTE and the hired killer in DIARY OF A HIT MAN.  One indulgence
director Mike Figgis allows himself is cameo roles with familiar
people.  It is something of a tribute to this film but also a
distraction that people like Bob Rafelson and Lou Rawls would agree to
do cameos.  Julian Sand also is present in a small role as Sera's
bizarre Latvian pimp.</P>
<P>     This is a film that does not pull its punches about the lives of
either prostitutes or terminal alcoholics.  The dialogue is often
raunchy and watching Cage's character deteriorate is not an uplifting
experience.  This is an adult film both in the usual sense and for the
fact it is aimed at a thinking, mature audience.  I put off seeing it
for a long time because this is just not the kind of film I generally
want to see.  In spite of that I was impressed sufficiently that it
will inevitably be on my top ten of the year list, probably high.  I
give it a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
