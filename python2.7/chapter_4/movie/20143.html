<P>         One of the perks you can get if you're a highly successful
screenwriter is the freedom to direct your own little vanity
productions. If, for example, you're Kevin Williamson, the creator of
the enormously profitable "Scream" films and the highly successful
"Dawson's Creek," you might even be able to take an old script out of
the closet, dust it off and sell it to Dimension Films.
         That's exactly how "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" came to be. Unfortunately,
the downside of having so much creative license is that you might wind
up putting something on the screen that in no way compares with your
best work. "Tingle" is just such a picture.</P>
<P> The movie has already been a subject of controversy in light of
the Columbine shootings last spring -- Dimension was forced to alter the
original title "Killing Mrs. Tingle" and shelve some TV ads that made
light of alcoholism -- but the film itself is essentially rather tame
and bland. Viewers expecting a bloody black comedy won't find it here.</P>
<P> What they'll get instead is a stellar performance from Helen
Mirren as Mrs. Tingle, a vicious history teacher who rules her classroom
-- and the entire school, it seems -- with an iron fist and withering
sarcasm. Mirren singlehandedly rescues the project from being pointless
nonsense; this brilliant actress can communicate more with a twitch of a
lip or a well-timed flick of her eyelashes than anyone else in the cast
can with pages of dialogue.</P>
<P> Katie Holmes (of "Creek" fame) plays Leigh Ann, a would-be
valedictorian whose chances of getting much-needed scholarships hinge on
her grade from Tingle. But despite having prepared as a final project an
elaborate diary of an accused witch in 17th-century Salem, Leigh Ann
finds Tingle is impossible to impress. In fact, Tingle despises Leigh
Ann and jumps at the chance to implicate her in a cheating scandal.</P>
<P> In the hopes of setting things right, Leigh Ann and friends Jo
Lynn (Marisa Coughlan) and Luke (Barry Watson) pay a visit to Tingle's
home one night. Unexpected complications ensue, and therein hangs the
rest of the plot.</P>
<P> For a movie that spends much time discussing and defining
"irony," "Tingle" doesn't have many twists to offer. Nor has Williamson
brought along the quirkiness that made "Scream" and "Scream 2" so much
fun. Almost everything in "Tingle" is predictable, from Tingle's uptight
wardrobe to Leigh Ann's long-suffering waitress-mom (Lesley Ann Warren)
to the sight of a long and winding staircase just waiting for someone to
fall down it. Even the musical score, which combines bits of the Wicked
Witch's theme from "The Wizard of Oz" and Bernard Herrmann's "Psycho,"
is overly obvious.</P>
<P> Though Holmes, in garish eye makeup, tries valiantly to turn
Leigh Ann into someone worth caring about, she's defeated by the script,
which constantly forces supposedly smart people to do ridiculous things.
As the stereotypical hunk and ditz, Watson and Coughlan barely squeak
by.
         Aside from Mirren, the only other cast member to make an impression is
former teen queen Molly Ringwald, who shows up as an office clerk
recruited as a substitute in Tingle's classroom. The improbable sight of
Ringwald teaching school is certain to make anyone over 30 feel every
bit their age. James Sanford</P>
