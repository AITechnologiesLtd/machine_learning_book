<P>If you've read Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery," you know the 
woman can spin a tale.  Her 1959 novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is the 
basis for Jan De Bont's film, a mostly successful adaptation with 
state-of-the-art special effects and even some of the psychology handed down 
from Jackson's disturbing narrative.</P>
<P>The opening sequence brings us into the apartment and the life of Eleanor 
Vance (Lili Taylor), an early middle-aged woman whose mother has just died.  
Eleanor had cared for the woman for the last several years, and Eleanor's 
sister, her husband and bratty son are now making sure Eleanor gets the 
short end of the stick.  She will inherit her mother's old Gremlin 
automobile, and get evicted from the apartment.  Because she has not much to 
lose, Eleanor decides to take a break of sorts, and after a telephone 
solicitation, decides to take part in a study of sleep disorders.</P>
<P>Dr. Jeffrey Marrow - an excellent name - is running the study.  Marrow (Liam 
Neeson) is in fact a behavioral scientist seeking to assemble a controlled 
study group, for the purpose of examining his subjects' reactions to fear.  
That his actions are unethical doesn't motivate him to inform the sleep 
deprived trio of the true nature of the study.  He says, "You don't tell the 
rats they're really in a maze."</P>
<P>Thus we sit through the convention of the group assembling at a remote 
country house - Hill House - the estate of the textile magnate Hugh Crane.  
The three insomniacs arrive separately, a nice way for director De Bont to 
characterize them.  After Eleanor is shown to her room by the mysterious, 
taciturn wife of the caretaker, we meet the second of the group, Theo 
(Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Then Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) comes in, and we 
get to see more of the house.  Although this exposition goes rather slowly 
for modern audiences, it is backed up well by the old house itself.  In 
reality a school in England, the mansion seems to be overdecorated in every 
room, gothic touches and rococo flares everywhere.  Eleanor's bedroom has 
the feel of a deconsecrated chapel, filigreed trim leaking from the ceilings 
and walls.  A definite motif is the statues of children, their carved 
likenesses covering mantels throughout the house.  Marrow later explains 
that the builder of the house was childless, his wife having had many 
stillborn children before her suicide.</P>
<P>Where does the haunting come in?  Well, the interesting premise is that Dr. 
Marrow believes he is witnessing fictions and myths latent in the 
imaginations of his subjects.  Let their minds work in the night, he 
figures, and they will fall victim to fears they themselves haven woven.  So 
it is not until far into Eleanor's ordeals with the supernatural that Marrow 
begins to lend any credence to her behaviors.</P>
<P>It turns out of course that the long-dead Crane took a terrible secret to 
his grave, a secret still kept prisoner in the house.  The rest of the 
narrative follows Eleanor's quest to expose the momentous truth and to free 
the restless souls held captive.</P>
<P>The biggest performance here is Lili Taylor's.  This actress casts an 
amazing emotive truth upon her expressions, shedding tears or grimacing or 
acting blankly shocked, just this side of insanity.  An Academy Award 
nomination for Best Supporting Actress might be in order here.</P>
<P>Catherine Zeta-Jones does a nice job in a rather different role for her.  
Here Theodora is full of zest and guts, a switch-hitting and aggressive 
female who dares you to tell her she dresses sluttishly.  (At only one point 
does Zeta-Jones' Scottish accent, unfamiliar to most American movie-goers, 
slip through, when she shouts in anger at Dr. Marrow for his scientific 
remoteness.)  Theo makes for a nice contrast with the plainer Eleanor, 
without seeming superior.  And she's a great foil for Owen Wilson's 
fast-talking, rather hypochondriacal Luke.  Wilson lends the most comic 
relief to the story, appearing sometimes like a spacey clown;  nevertheless, 
he is protective of Eleanor when she begins to make claims about the 
horrendous history of the house.</P>
<P>Always reliable, Liam Neeson has a way in this film of making his presence 
strong yet quiet.  He's the doctor in charge of the study, watching from the 
background and recording his observations on a mini-recorder that Eleanor 
actually finds and plays once.  But Neeson is also careful not to overact, 
especially during one sequence in which he convinces his superior that it is 
necessary to set up the study by keeping the subjects in ignorance.  After a 
few more movies, Neeson will have the reputation of being as consistent and 
reliable as the best actors in the history of film.  Traces of slight brogue 
are just enough to fascinate American fans, giving the big man an edge over 
actors with more familiar dialects.</P>
<P>The bottom line is that "The Haunting" is solid but not outstanding.  Three 
stars out of four, a B+ -- whatever your rating, the film will supply you 
with some nifty visual thrills, and best of all, some delicious 
psychological ones.  Long after her death, Shirley Jackson is still an 
American writer with a talent for the fright-tale.</P>
