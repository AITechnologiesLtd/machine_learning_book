<P>Combining beautiful people in glorious, exotic locales with a lurid
tale of duplicity and murder, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is the big
screen equivalent of the thick paperback thrillers so popular with
vacationers. Like most of those novels, the film is also a bit
overstuffed, but that's easy to forgive. With this well-acted,
wonderfully textured work, director Anthony Minghella ("The English
Patient") has crafted a wicked psychological study that would do
Hitchcock proud.</P>
<P>Based on the 1955 novel by Patricia Highsmith, the film centers on
Thomas Ripley (Matt Damon), an ambitious, facile young man who envies
the lush lifestyle of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), an American
expatriate lolling around Italy with his girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow), so much that he decides to take over his identity… by any
means necessary.</P>
<P>Tom Ripley's fractured journey begins in New York City, when
industrialist Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) mistakes the
impoverished young piano player for a classmate of his wayward son. He
offers to fund Tom on a trip to convince Dickie to return home.</P>
<P>Ripley soon finds himself in a wonderland of beaches, villas, trendy
clubs and an air of privilege. In short order, he ingratiates himself
with the handsome, charismatic Dickie, furthering the bonding process
by revealing his "mission" to the urbane layabout. Now operating as a
"double agent," Tom writes encouraging letters to the senior
Greenleaf, while spending the father's money knocking about the
country with his son.</P>
<P>All is well until the relationship begins to fray. Dickie tends to aim
his full attention toward the latest arrival to his social circle,
giving scant time to those who have been around longer. Ripley soon
finds that he is no longer the flavor of the day. Rather than an
intriguing newcomer, he is now perceived as a hanger-on. As if this
isn't bad enough, Dickie reacts negatively to Tom's quasi-erotic
advances. While on an out-of-town holiday with Dickie, the calculating
young Ripley strikes out. His plan is to lay low in various Italian
cities, using forged letters and his skills as a mimic to co-opt
Dickie's identity. The scheme is clearly a house of cards, but then
again, Tom Ripley is a very resourceful man.</P>
<P>In Patricia Highsmith's novel (the first of a series of books on the
character), Ripley is a flat-out sociopath. A large part of the
story's twisted pleasure comes from seeing life through the eyes of
this coldly efficient shark. Minghella changes the tone by giving Tom
a bit of a conscience. He also plays up Ripley's sexuality. While it
was established in the book that Tom was at least bisexual, if not
entirely gay, his sexual orientation was almost irrelevant. People
were just a means to an end and their gender meant little to this
self-absorbed acquisition machine. While I understand why Minghella
felt the need to make the changes, I still prefer Ripley in his
undiluted asexual mode.</P>
<P>But thanks to the immense skills of Matt Damon, the altered Ripley
still works. To emphasize the class differences between Tom and
Dickie, Minghella wanted Damon to initially appear pale and
scrawny. Accordingly, Damon dropped 30+ pounds and stayed in the
shadows. His efforts were successful. When Tom first meets Dickie and
Marge, turning up on the beach in an ill-fitting Speedo, he looks
underfed, out of place and remarkably exposed. Anyone who dismissed
Matt Damon as just another Hollywood pretty boy will learn better here
- Damon is the genuine article; an accomplished actor who will do
whatever it takes to make his character credible. He is extraordinary,
deftly playing his wholesome good looks against an ever-darkening
persona in one of the year's best performances.</P>
<P>Jude Law is his match as the magnetic Dickie Greenleaf. He totally
captures the spirit of the character; a tempestuous, supremely
confident dilettante who perceives himself as the real thing. It's
easy to understand why Marge and Tom would be drawn to this smoldering
young firebrand. While Gwyneth Paltrow has far less to do, she acquits
herself nicely as Marge, who is far more assertive here than in the
book.</P>
<P>Anthony Minghella does a masterful job with his exceptional cast and
stunning Italian locations, creating an alluring sense of bohemian
abandon. After watching the film, I was ready to hop the next plane to
Italy and hang out with these people, even if it meant maneuvering
around the dangerous Mr. Ripley. Minghella uses the radiant settings
to maximum effect - the darkest moment of the story takes place in
bright sunlight, which makes its impact even stronger.</P>
<P>While the mechanics of the film's last act play better in the book
than onscreen, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" still packs a considerable
punch. At two hours and 20 minutes, the film is a bit longer than it
needs to be, but Anthony Minghella's sprawling creation remains one of
the most captivating, and chilling, character studies to come along in
quite a while. So skillful and seductive is the portrayal of Tom
Ripley that you find yourself hoping he'll get away with his
crimes. Now that's truly disturbing.</P>
