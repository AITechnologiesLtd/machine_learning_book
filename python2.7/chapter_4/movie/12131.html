                    "AMERICAN POP" (USA, 1980)
                 A Film Review by James Kendrick
                         ** (out of ****)<HR></PRE>
<P>Director: Ralph Bakshi || Screenplay: Ronnie Kern || Voices: Gene
Borkan (Izzy), Frank DeKova (Crisco), Ben Frommer (Nicky
Palumbo), Jerry Holland (Louie), Roz Kelly (Eva Tanguay), Amy
Levitt (Nancy), Jeffrey Lippa (Zalmie), Lisa Jane Persky (Bella),
Elsa Raven (Hannele), Richard Singer (Benny), Marya Small
(Frankie), Leonard Stone (Leo), Eric Taslitz (Little Pete), Ron
Thompson (Tony) || MPAA Rating: R<HR></P>
<P>"American Pop," Ralph Bakshi's animated generational history of
twentieth century American music, is an epic without scope. In
just over an hour and a half, it follows the paths of four
generations of fathers and sons, starting with their immigration
from czarist Russia, and taking them through the speakeasies of
Prohibition, the beatnik rhythms of the fifties, the drug-addled
sixties, and right into the New Wave era of the early eighties.</P>
<P>Any one of these segments, properly and thoroughly explored,
might have made an interesting film. Unfortunately, the way
screenwriter Ronnie Kern has it set up, "American Pop" is like a
tease - every time it starts engaging the viewer, it quickly
shifts gears and heads into a new decade, leaving the previous
developments all but forgotten.</P>
<P>The movie opens in Russia in 1907, when the family leaves the
violence of that country for the hope of America, symbolized by
Ellis Island. The first generation father starts out working in
vaudeville; but eventually he gets caught up in the Mafia's
dealings during Prohibition, and winds up in jail. The second
father is a quiet, masterful piano player who goes to World War
II and is killed by the Nazis while sitting at a piano.</P>
<P>The third father, Tony (voiced by Ron Thompson), is given the
deepest treatment. He is a rebellious young man who is awestruck
when he hears a beatnik reading from Allen Ginsberg's infamous
poem, "Howl." He travels across the U.S. - stopping long enough
in Kansas to father an illegitimate child via a one-night stand
with a waitress in a cornfield - before delving headfirst into
the rampantly hedonistic music scene of San Francisco in the
mid-sixties. There, he hooks up with a band obviously patterned
after Jefferson Airplane, where he writes songs and does a lot of
drugs.</P>
<P>But soon enough, the drug culture that spawned his success chews
Tony up and spits him out, leaving him alone with his son, Little
Pete (voiced by Eric Taslitz), who has managed to find him in
California. After the film's most effective dramatic scene
between a father and a son, Tony ends up deserting Little Pete.
Pete then grows up to be a cocaine dealer in the late seventies,
and eventually makes his way to stadium-filling stardom as a
full-fledged rock star, after wowing some of his drug clients by
pounding out Bob Seger's "Night Moves" on the piano (it's one of
several instances where the film has fictional characters writing
and performing actual songs as if they were their own).</P>
<P>If a single theme emerges from "American Pop," it's a lack of
paternal guidance resulting in profound unhappiness and loss of
identity. All four generations of fathers and sons have conflicts
in their relationships, and none of their lives end on an upbeat
note. One lands in jail; one dies violently in war; one is never
seen again after deserting his son; and although that final son
is last seen standing triumphantly on stage, it's not hard to
surmise that the drugs and fame will soon take their toll on him
as well.</P>
<P>This was surely Bakshi's intention, considering how essentially
downbeat and provoking most of his films have been. Bakshi
emerged in the early seventies as a kind of anti-Walt Disney by
introducing pimps and hookers and drug pushers into a mainstream
animated landscape that had previously been home only to the
likes Bambi and Snow White. One of Bakshi's earlier films, the
racially-charged "Coonskin" (1975)- which was later re-titled
"Streetfight" to avoid racist accusations - was a deliberate and
hilarious parody of Disney's "Song of the South."</P>
<P>Unlike that film, "American Pop" just isn't acerbic enough. The
tone is ultimately depressing, but Bakshi wraps it up in bright
colors and a pounding soundtrack of rock classics from Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and Bob Seger (in
fact, it was the battle over the ancillary video rights to use
this music that kept the film off video shelves for so long). The
movie is a downer that doesn't have the sense to at least be
thought-provoking or shocking; it's just too plain for its own
good.</P>
<P>Maybe it's because "American Pop" is so steadfastly serious and
determined to rush through its eighty years of music-laden
history, that there's never a chance to crack a smile, either
on-screen or off. Bakshi's earlier animated films, including
"Coonskin" and his autobiographical "Heavy Traffic" (1973), dealt
with harsh social reality, but they were loaded with shocks,
jolts, and plenty of raw-edged humor. It gave those films life
and vitality, and "American Pop" displays none of that.</P>
<P>Technically, "American Pop" is one of Bakshi's more even-handed
efforts. His tendency is to mix too many styles and palettes,
including live action, animation, and still drawings, which
caused such ugly messes as "Wizards" (1977) and the awful ending
of "Lord of the Rings" (1978). "American Pop" maintains a
consistent visual style, but animation purists will be horrified
at the obvious rotoscoping throughout the film (For those who
don't know, rotoscoping is the practice of filming the movie
live-action, and then tracing the action into animation.)</P>
<P>Depending on one's point-of-view, rotoscoping is either a method
of achieving additional realism with ink and paper, or it is an
unforgivable bastardization of the animation process. I tend to
lean more toward the latter, because it seems pointless and
inartistic to deny the animators so much creativity. With the
action already on celluloid, all they do is trace the characters
and put them against expansive backdrops that would have cost
much more to film live. Much of it is probably due to money,
since Bakshi obviously didn't have the budget afforded a typical
Disney film. This is most obvious in large scenes filled with
many people - instead of having layers of animated people moving
about and creating a sense of motion and life, he simply pans
across a single, static drawing to establish the location. It
gets the job done, but it's a shortcut nonetheless.</P>
<P>However, "American Pop's" fundamental flaw is more basic than
technical merits or dramatic structure: simply put, there is
nothing about either the subject matter or its cinematic
treatment that in any way suggests it is best served through
animation. Nothing about the film couldn't have been done better
with live actors. For almost two decades, Bakshi waged a virtual
one-man fight to prove that animation was just as viable a medium
for telling mature, adult stories as live-action. If "American
Pop" proves anything, it's that some subjects are best left to
flesh and blood.</P>
