<P>   If you have a problem that's wearing you down and you're
looking for relief, there are two ways to get it from the
movies.  One: Choose an escapist movie, say, something in
the Jerry Bruckheimer or Brian De Palma vein, and you'll be
swept away in the clatter and imagery of action, adventure
and suspense.  Two:  Choose the opposite, a movie that's
brutally realistic (such as one written or directed by Ingmar
Bergman), one that can force you to confront your problem
head-on instead of trying to flee from it.  From the looks of
the lines at the box office, the first is more popular: but
avoidance is a temporary solution.  A better resolution is
possible if you face your situation directly by watching others
deal with similar dilemmas.  </P>
<P>   What's a typical difficulty?  Marriage, of course.  While 90%
of all people in America get married at some time, 50% of
them end up in divorce court.  Can we assume that the other
50% do not lead lives of boundless cheer?  Surely.  If you're
one of this latter group you're wondering whether to put up
with the hardships and say nothing, try to work things out, or
to seek a lover on the side.  You're now in the same boat as
the central character of Ingmar Bergman's latest work,
"Private Confessions."  Bergman, perhaps the most personal
of directors, this time takes a back seat to Liv Ullmann whose
direction gives the story a profoundly woman's touch.  Shot
by Sven Nykvist, the movie could almost be entitled "Anna,"
since Pernilla August, who performs in the role of that
principal figure, is in virtually every scene.  </P>
<P>   "Private Confessions" defies the usual rules of the movie
game and of the Bergman style itself.  It is low on imaginative
imagery, it displays few if any symbols, it is not "opened up"
but rather more like a photographed play (it was, after all
made for TV), and it zeroes in on just three individuals rather
than painting an elaborate portrait of family life.  "Private
Confessions" is therefore unlike Bergman's "Fanny and
Alexander," which is lavish display of extensive family ties;
the Swedish filmmaker's "Wild Strawberries," which abounds
in religious imagery; and "The Seventh Seal," which is a
morbid study of death with a host of Biblical references. Nor
does the film's theme flourish with originality.  Women and
men have betrayed one another on film almost since the birth
of cinema.</P>
<P>   Despite its violation of the rules of the game, it works, and
works beautifully, principally because of an outstanding
performance by Ms. August as a matronly woman of about
thirty-six years of age who is married to a decent enough
fellow, but is unhappy.  After spending some time alone with
a younger man, Tomas Egerman (Thomas Hanzon), she
carries on an affair with him, hiding the details from her
husband Henrik (Samuel Froler).  When Uncle Jacob (Max
von Sydow), her spiritual adviser, urges Anna to tell the
absolute truth to Henrik, she rebels, as expected.  She does
not want to hurt her husband or threaten her relationship with
her two children, unsatisfactory though her marriage may be. 
Eventually she does narrate all to Henrik, feels guilty, and
expresses her willingness to leave him everything--house,
children, reputation.  Because so much of the rich, sensitive
and compassionate dialogue is spoken in a normal, unhurried
way, the moments of anger and anguish strike us as
exceptionally intense.</P>
<P>   The story is really a fictionalized account of Ingmar
Bergman's own relationship with his troubled parents; his
severe, God-fearing father and his fitful mother, whose
anguish made his own childhood little better than hell.  He
manipulates his usual themes of death (in revealing Uncle
Jacob's imminent demise), of loneliness (of all the principal
characters), and of religion (by situation all three men as
practitioners of Lutheran professions).  The sequence of
scenes, essentially five private conversations or confessions,
is an interesting one.  We see Anna at first telling all to her
uncle, then to her husband.  We flash back to her relationship
with the younger Tomas, and toward the end of the picture
we're back eighteen years to Anna's naive days in high
school.  The actors perform exquisitely and sensitively: Max
von Sydow exudes severity and compassion alike, August
shows her defenses and her pain in equal measure, Thomas
Hanzon his character's stiffness and insecurity, and Samuel
Froler the husband's agony and anger alike.  "Private
Confessions" uses a simple--dare we say soap-opera--format
to express compassion, affliction, and redemption delicately
and strikingly.</P>
