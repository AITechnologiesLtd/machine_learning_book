<P>BELOVED (M).  
(Touchstone/Buena Vista International)
Director: Jonathan Demme
Stars: Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly Elise,
Lisa Gay Hamilton, Irma P Hall, Albert Hall, Beah Richards, Kessia
Kordelle, Jude Ciccolella, Jason Robards, Tracey Walter
Running time: 172 minutes.</P>
<P>In hindsight, maybe it wasn't such a good idea for Oprah
Winfrey to give up her day job.  America's queen of daytime television
talk shows has quit the small screen to establish a new career in
movies with Beloved, her first feature film since the memorable The
Colour Purple 14 years ago.  Based on Toni Morrison's acclaimed 1987
novel, Beloved has been something of a labour of love for Winfrey, who
has nurtured the project for over a decade.  However, this
disappointing film should have been much more powerful, especially
given the time and effort spent on refining and developing it.</P>
<P>The film tells of the hardships confronting former slaves as
they try to come to terms with their freedom and the costly legacy of
their recent blood soaked past.  This is rich territory we have
explored before, most notably in the epic tv series Roots.  Beloved is
an unsatisfactory and occasionally unfathomable mix of history, family
drama, horror, mysticism, and unexplained magic that fails to leave
such a lasting impression.</P>
<P>Set in the mid-1870's, the film centres around Sethe
(Winfrey), a former slave haunted by her past and the soul destroying
sacrifices she had to make to ensure her own survival.  Sethe lives in
the old family house on the outskirts of Cincinnati and is slowly
coming to terms with her independence.  She is shunned by most of the
townsfolk, for reasons that we only slowly learn about.  The scars of
the past also affect her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise, from Set It
Off, etc), who is reluctant to leave the house.</P>
<P>The healing process begins with the arrival of two very
different people.  Paul D (Danny Glover) is a former slave and family
friend, who re-enters Sethe's life after 18 years.  He brings
happiness and love back into Sethe's life, until even her unassuaged
guilt proves too much.  The other catalyst is Beloved (Thandie Newton,
from Flirting, etc), a scarred and twisted young woman of mysterious
origins, whose presence in the house becomes both threatening and
unnerving.</P>
<P>This is the first film from Oscar winning director Jonathan
Demme (The Silence Of The Lambs, etc) since 1993's Philadelphia.
Although he handles the material with restraint, except for a couple
of notable exceptions, his direction seems to lack a strong focus.
It's almost as if he lacks the same depth of passion and commitment to
the story as Winfrey and most of the production crew.  Three writers,
including Richard LaGravenese (The Bridges Of Madison County, etc) and
Adam Brooks (Practical Magic, etc) have shaped this multi-layered
story, but there are still a number of problems with the narrative
structure.  Despite its lengthy running time, there is a suggestion
that many characters and scenes were sacrificed on the cutting room
floor.  Veterans Jason Robards and Tracey Walter (who both appeared in
Demme's Philadelphia) are wasted in small, wordless roles.</P>
<P>Brief, sepia toned flashbacks provides glimpses of some of the
horrors endured by the slaves in America's south before the Civil War.
Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is superb, and Rachel Portman's score,
which draws heavily on Afro-American chants, is also evocative.</P>
<P>Winfrey runs the gamut of emotions here, and her complex
performance provides the film with much of its emotional depth.
Glover is understated in a role that never really goes anywhere.
Newton is superb, and delivers an emotionally and physically demanding
performance as the childlike Beloved.</P>
<P>Despite its rich source material and its fine production
credentials, Beloved is a huge disappointment, and doesn't really
endear itself to audiences.</P>
