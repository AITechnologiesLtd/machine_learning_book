<P>In the 1993 "Grumpy Old Men,"  John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon ) 
and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau ) were small-town, retired 
Minnesotans -- respectively a  widowed Swede and a divorced 
Jew -- who had been feuding friends and neighbors since 1938. 
The film was an unworthy, dull descendant of "The Odd Couple," 
jerkily built,  minimally salvaged by  traces of comedic 
talent  in the Lemmon-Matthau pair.</P>
<P>I  was not anxious to see the sequel "Grumpier Old Men", but  
I did, partly as a reaction to the flood of three-hour long, 
tush-taxing and grump-making movies.  Surprisingly, it turned 
out to be pretty enjoyable, all the more so since remakes are 
usually much inferior to their originals.  </P>
<P>In "Grumpier," John now happily married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) 
for six months, still lives next door to Max. Max is a lonely, 
ultra-messy bachelor whose companionship consists of three 
television sets that edify him about the world through 
programs like "Geraldo." He still has John's fishing 
companionship. The old antagonism has lessened but still 
smolders -- still quite irrationally. Insults, put-downs, 
deprecation and physical tricks are very much alive. In 
addition to this  Neil Simon-ish rapport, there is a kind of 
Three Stooges behavior. </P>
<P>There is no third  stooge. On the periphery is the colorless 
affair of Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollack) who wants to marry 
Max's daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), the divorced mother of 
a little girl. Peripheral too, though colorful,  is 95-year 
old Grandpa Gustafson (Burgess Meredith). </P>
<P>>From Palermo, Sicily, Maria ,the cousin of  a local  nicknamed 
"Spaghetti" Ragetti, moves to   town. In  needless overkill of 
plotting,  she has been unlucky in five marriages. Her old 
mother comes along. Ann Guilbert plays her convincingly as an 
Italian, though her rapid going from ignorance of English to 
relative fluency is too much.</P>
<P>The ladies now own  a former bait shop by the lake, want to 
transform the place into an Italian "ristorante romantico."  
The John-Max odd couple, fearing that this will affect the 
fishing, resort  to childish tricks and pranks to sabotage the 
project.</P>
<P>Max's  initial irritation about Maria telegraphs in large writ 
that it will be transformed into romance and badly-needed 
matrimony. Other complications, including  a break between 
John and Ariel and another between Melanie and Jacob, are also 
signaled from afar as merely passing impediments. </P>
<P>The film's structure is of episodes tied together by gags, 
jokes and repartees. These are overall better than in "Grumpy 
Old Men." Both movies have the same writer and composer, 
otherwise the crews are different. ( Howard Deutch who has 
been closely associated with John Hughes has also directed  
"Pretty In Pink,"" Some Kind Of Wonderful," "The Great 
Outdoors," "Article 99, ""Getting Even With Dad.") </P>
<P>Silvestri's music humorously underlines the story with 
familiar renditions of old songs.  "I'll Be Glad When You're 
Dead, You Rascal You" is gratifyingly served in its entirety 
with the opening credits."That's Amore"; "Hit the Road, Jack" 
and others follow. </P>
<P>Among the funnier highlights, Matthau in love has his truck 
seat "refinished in  authentic imitation leather." (Historical 
Note: The original ads, years ago, said "genuine imitation 
leatherette"). He gets "jewelry" for Loren and in what struck 
me as the movie's funniest bit, explains: "It's a cubic 
zirconium. I got it from the Home Shopping Network." </P>
<P>A running gag has Matthau videotaping (with unlikely skills) 
neighbor Lemmon posing  nude for sculptress Ann-Margret's 
remake of Rodin's "The Thinker." There is also a good, 
cartoonish dog-chasing-cat , mayhem-producing sequence topped 
by the humans squabbling while now the animals sit together in 
friendship and watch. The tone is kept light except, close to 
the end, for some pathos about Grandpa and some sentimentality 
that you see coming for miles about a legendary fish tracked 
for 20 years and finally caught. </P>
<P>Most importantly, there is Sophia Loren. She wears her 61 
years with grace and not much disguise. She does her flimsy 
part with wit, warmth and grace.  Her appeal and sexiness go 
beyond the obvious (her bust, her walk). They involve her 
eyes, the way she smiles, reacts and speaks. On the other 
hand, the film  overstresses the ages of  Matthau (75) and 
Lemmon (70), the  close-ups of jowls and watery eyes, the 
shuffling gait.  </P>
<P>Ann-Margret (age 54 in 1995) and the rest of the cast strictly 
provide support, padding or decoration. The movie is slight, 
unambitious and  forgettable, but as short-term or instant 
gratification, it does nicely.  </P>
