<PRE>`Analyze This' – A Comedy in Need of Some Therapy
by Homer Yen
(c)1999</PRE>
<P>If I've learned anything from watching movies with a Mafia element in
it, it's that the big bosses never have it easy.  They're constantly
being assailed by gunfire, busy plotting out their next crimes, and
always being chased by the law.  It's enough to give the toughest boss
a panic attack.  </P>
<P>Even kingpin Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is not immune to the pressures
of his job.  He is the head of a powerful mob family who strikes fear
in those who dare to cross him.  Though he is tough, he begins to lose
control of his ability to command others.  Among other things, he's
beginning to have trouble bringing himself to kill people (a vital Mob
job requirement).  If others find out about Vitti's inadequacy, he'll
be targeted for sure.  He needs to quickly find a psychologist to help
him out.  The therapist that unluckily finds his way into Vitti's life
is Dr. Sobol (Billy Crystal).  Meeting Vitti couldn't come at a worse
time in his life.  He is about to marry his fiancée (Lisa Kudrow) and
wants as little to go wrong as possible.  But Vitti doesn't take no
for an answer (Vitti funnily says that he only hears ‘no' when his
victims are whimpering for mercy), and Sobol begins to try to help him
resolve his personal problems against his better judgment.  But it's
not going to be easy helping Vitti become a well-adjusted gangster. 
And from that point on, an uneasy but sometimes droll friendship
begins to develop.</P>
<P>There seems to be lots of potential comedy in this kind of setup. 
DeNiro has played the tough mob boss many times over, and Crystal is a
funny guy when he has the right material.  But the material here
doesn't really let any of these two gifted performers shine.  On the
one hand, there is the slapstick comedy using Crystal's likeable
demeanor against DeNiro's stone-faced, tough-guy persona.  But most of
the comedy seemed subdued and reduced to mini-skits.  DeNiro's a good
sport as he satires his past Mob roles by, for example, crying during
touching commercials.  But I felt that Kudrow's role was no different
than watching Phoebe with an attitude (on Friends).  The comedy never
makes it past the lightweight status because the dialogue focuses too
much on one-liners, and it didn't seem like there was any thought to a
scene's setup other than letting Crystal and DeNiro square off against
one another.  The other strange thing was that at points, the movie
tries to take itself too seriously such as when Crystal begins to
unravel the root of the problem or at the end when the film seemingly
gives up on its premise by showcasing a bizarrely timed hail of
gunfire.  It seemed as if someone just picked this ending out of a
hat.  These kinds of scenes made the film seem uneven.  </P>
<P>`Analyze This' had some cute moments and some clever ideas.  There are
moments that are droll and other moments that seem to last a bit too
long.  DeNiro does carry himself well, but there's not enough here to
put his teeth into.  Even at 106 minutes, the film seemed a bit long. 
If you analyze this, you'll probably come up with the same conclusions.</P>
