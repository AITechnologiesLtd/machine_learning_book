<P>PLOT:
A thief who gets caught breaking into the house of a billionaire =
consequently gets his own ring stolen by the same man whose house he =
broke into. The robber then decides to make it his mission in life to =
get the ring back. Hilarity is supposed to ensue...=20</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Here's a movie that's just not very funny, entertaining, interesting or =
original in any way, shape or form. It's definitely not the worst movie =
that I've ever seen, in fact, it's probably not even the worst movie =
that I've seen this year (that honor is still holding firm at HEADS OVER =
HEELS), but it's one of those movies which has you coming out of the =
theatre and wondering why it was ever made in the first place. I mean, =
if it wasn't for the talent associated to the film (and boy, are there =
ever a lot of characters in this flick!), I wouldn't be surprised if =
this movie had gone straight-to-video. There just isn't much going on in =
here. Oh sure, maybe I'm a little jaded because I've seen my share of =
great comedies, but then again, haven't we all? Sure, we have. This one =
just feels like a retread of a retread of an idea that worked in a few =
good movies years ago, crunched through the generic meat-grinder =
numbered "Screenplay 101", packed with clich=E9 after clich=E9, =
ultimately resulting in little more than a couple of chuckles, a =
mediocre story-line and a lot of dead silence. Of course, comedies have =
always been subjective in nature and to be honest, there were quite a =
few people laughing their heads off during my screening (unless they =
were high, of course...yeah, yeah, that's it!), but keep in mind that =
these folks hadn't exactly "paid" to see the movie either. I was =
particularly un-entertained by the obvious setups to many of the "jokes" =
in this movie, like the one that has Lawrence blinking when he told a =
lie (hardy-har-har!) and a sign language translator woman who continued =
to translate certain curse words that DeVito (and then later, Lawrence) =
spurt out. Hahaha. Me crackie uppie.</P>
<P>I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the "right mood" for this simple =
rehash of a film. The sad part about it all is that it really could have =
been something. Anybody who's seen TIN MEN or WHAT ABOUT BOB? knows that =
comedies based on guys vowing revenge on one another could definitely =
add up to some pretty funny times, but this one just blew it. Lawrence =
doesn't really offer much of his usual hilarity and DeVito seems to =
telegraph his role in while cashing his paycheck at the bank. And =
everybody else, well, they all just came across as obvious "filler" with =
little more to do than to stand around and play along with the goofiness =
happening around them. Granted, Larry Miller is always funny and he's =
probably the only person who comes off "okay" from this movie, but how's =
about getting more than three lines in your next film, Larry...you've =
got talent, dammit! And William Fichtner, a man who completely stole the =
show in 1999's GO, sort of works as an obviously gay detective here, but =
despite his character being fun to look at, not much laughs came from =
him either. Yeah, sure I smirked every now and then, but put me in any =
movie and I'm bound to do that anyway. Sorry fellas, this whole movie =
just felt like it was written over a weekend and shot over a week. A dud =
across the board.</P>
