<P>   Did you ever see two people in love, folks who looks as though
they were made for each other, and you said, "This is a match
made in heaven"?  Sure you have.  Now think.  Do you really
believe this, because if you think a sec about it, you're saying that
the meeting of this happy couple is not an accident at all, not a
coincidence, but was destined by a higher power.  Could be, could
be.  This could be idle speculation or a bull session you engage in
while on a lunch break during your sophomore year in college, but
not in the hands of the unpredictable Tom Tykwer, whose visually
arresting and stylish "Run, Lola Run," about a woman who has 20
minutes to raise 100,000 marks to save her boyfriend from
mobsters brought far more than the usual arthouse denizens to the
theaters in '98.  If style outstripped substance in that fast-paced
work, the reverse is true in Tykwer's current gem. "The Princess
and the Warrior" is a rumination about love, dealing thematically
with the question of whether fate or coincidence brings people
together, the attraction of opposites, and the sometimes thin line
between psychosis and sanity.  With only a single, brief scene--
one of cars moving rapidly from the view of a camera stationed on
a roof--that reminds us "Run, Lola, Run," "The Princess and the
Warrior," or in the more alliterative German, "Der Krieger und die
Kaiserin," is a potent testament to the healing power of love.</P>
<P>   Featuring Tykwer's favorite actress, Franka Potente in the role of
Sissi, "Princess" hones in the shy, twenty-something nurse in the
psychiatric facility of a medium-sized German town.  Sissi was
actually born in the institution, as her mother was also on the staff,
and Sissi apparently knows little about love.  One day she is hit by
a truck and, while lying motionless and short of breath under the
wheels, she is saved by Bodo (Benno Furmann), who uses his
army training to restore her breathing and quickly disappears. 
Little does Sissi know that the accident was a result of Bodo's
being chased after a small-town robbery he botched or that he and
his brother Walter (Joachim Krol) are small-time crooks who plan
to make one big haul and leave the country.  When Sissi heals
after two months in the hospital,she is determined to find her savior
not so much to thank him but to fulfill what she believes to be her
destiny: to affiliate herself for the long term with this heroic
gentleman--except that Bodo, fighting vigorously against his own
feelings, wants nothing to do with her.</P>
<P>   As the plot unfolds we learn more about why Bodo acts not such
coldly toward the pursuing woman (who is not at all unattractive)
but literally throws her out on at least two occasions when she has
chased after him.  In fact, on of the great merits of this picture is
that unlike a Hollywood director who signals us from almost the
start about its characters, virtually telling us whom to like and
whom to hiss, Tywker takes his time to let his audience get to
know the people.  "The Princess and the Warrior" does not outlast
its 130-minute length.</P>
<P>   Unlike popcorn movies such as "Swordfish" which are intent on
providing nice-sized explosions from the start and upping the ante
until the conclusion, "Princess" surprises us by sudden reversals. 
A session of group therapy in the hospital is followed by a violent
outburst of a patient responding to a voice in his head.  An
extended period of talk and meditation is followed by an
explosively violent scene involving a frenzied bank robbery, the
violence making its impression by its very contrast with the
unobtrusive and the dormant.  The surreal conclusion is a
reflection on life, on how our existence could have been different if
only chance happenings occurred which might have caused major
changes in our entire development.</P>
<P>   Tykwer is well served by Johnny Kilmek and Reinhold Heil's
astonishing good and appropriate music while Frank Griebe's
camera gives us a good image of the touristic German town of
Wuppertal, with its steep hills and slopes, a place eminently suited
to people who want to hide out from the world.  Tom Tykwer
obviously believes in the power of love to heal and restore our
vitality, but happily eschews the insipidly sentimental ways that
Hollywood regularly chooses to make that all-important point.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 130 minutes.  (C)2001,
