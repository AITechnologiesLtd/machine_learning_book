LADY IN THE BOX
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In Christian Otjen's film noir, LADY IN THE BOX, Jerry (Darren Burrows, 
"Northern Exposure") has a problem.  He just earned $500 from a stranger 
named Doug (Mark Sheppard) for dumping a trunk into the lake.  When 
Jerry gets back to his apartment, he finds blood stains everywhere and 
hair with scalp attached on his kitchen floor.  Since his girlfriend is 
nowhere to be found, you can guess what he assumes was in the heavy 
trunk.  After all, the movie isn't titled BRICKS IN THE BOX.</P>
<P>The fear on Jerry's face is palpable.  His best friend Chris (Robert 
Knepper) points out how dumb Jerry was, since the newspapers have been 
full of stories about two recently murdered young women.  Confirming 
Jerry's fears, Doug comes back with some frightening demands.  From 
there, it's one twist and turn after another.  The performances by the 
three guys are quite good, but the story suffers from having been told 
so often.  One key revelation is too easily guessed, and the movie has 
trouble with its last act.  The final twist, however, is devilishly fun.</P>
<P>LADY IN THE BOX runs 1:44.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
violence and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
