<P>     The lives of tortured artists have always made for fascinating film
fare.  From AMADEUS to MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE, dramatic re-
creations of the often-frenzied, always-tormented lives of "great" men
and women have captivated audiences.  Since genius is often synonymous
with self-destruction, it should come as no surprise that director
Agnieszka Holland's presentation of the relationship between two 19th
century poets is overflowing with grimness, grief, and anger.  Yet, even
though we never feel much sympathy for either Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo
DiCaprio) or Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis), the material is nevertheless
strangely compelling.</P>
<P>     TOTAL ECLIPSE opens in 1871 as established poet Verlaine invites
the wild 16-year old Rimbaud to live with him.  The youth, who possesses
a keen intellect but little regard for conventional etiquette, astounds
his host while simultaneously horrifying Verlaine's young, pregnant
wife, Mathilde (Romane Bohringer).  Soon, with his promises of intense
experiences and new insights into life, Rimbaud seduces Verlaine from
his family.  The two men, now sexual partners as well as friends, bounce
from Paris to Brussels to London, arguing about the existence of love
and whether indeed "the only unbearable thing is that nothing is
unbearable."</P>
<P>     The story related in TOTAL ECLIPSE is ambitious.  What transpired
between Verlaine and Rimbaud more than one-hundred years ago has
influenced poetry since, but has never been dramatized for the screen
until now.  The relationship is complex, encompassing just about every
emotion from love to hate--a profoundly unhealthy attraction that
poisons not only the lives of the two principals, but that of everyone
who has contact with them.  What befalls the Verlaines' marriage is only
the first tragedy.</P>
<P>     As scripted by Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIAISONS,
CARRINGTON), the presentation of Verlaine and Rimbaud's story is
erratic.  At times, it's absorbing--almost hypnotic--but those
stretches don't last.  There are other sequences when the film becomes
ponderous and pretentious, and where over-the-top acting blunts dramatic
impact.  The narrative also has a tendency to jump from year-to-year and
place-to-place.  As far as the characters are concerned, they're
interesting only when they're together.  During the overlong denouement,
when the poets are separated, the proceedings become a little dull.</P>
<P>     The performances by the two leads are as uneven as the story
itself.  DiCaprio (THE BASKETBALL DIARIES) and Thewlis (NAKED) both have
moments when they truly shine--the latter as a pathetic man questing
for something to re-ignite his inspiration and the former as a cruel,
torn youth who sees human society as a hypocritical, ugly place.  On the
other hand, each also has scenes where they overact the material
(imagine them crawling around barking like dogs).  Cesar-winning French
actress Romane Bohringer (SAVAGE NIGHTS) is a model of solid, consistent
acting, making the most of limited screen time.</P>
<P>     Despite its flaws, TOTAL ECLIPSE is the kind of movie that stirs
thoughts and ruminations about the nature of genius, the true meaning of
art, and the unfailing capacity of great people to destroy themselves
and others.  Holland has not matched the success of two of her previous
films--EUROPA EUROPA and OLIVIER OLIVIER--but this picture is still
a respectable examination of a fascinating historical relationship.</P>
