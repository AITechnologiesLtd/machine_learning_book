<P>Director Richard Attenborough is a master of detailed story telling.
The Academy Award winning producer and director of 'Gandhi' (1982)
tells the story of famed American writer Ernest Hemingway (Chris
O'Donnell) and his romantic encounters during World War I with a Red
Cross nurse (Sandra Bullock).  Based on the book 'Hemingway In Love and
War' by Henry S. Villard, James Nagel and Mackenzie Astin, this movie
develops its characters very well as we come to know their
personalities and overall human qualities.  O'Donnell is bravely
spirited as Hemingway and Bullock has a keen sense of duty and maturity
in her role as the caring nurse as she is several years older than
Hemingway and this movie is based on a true story.  Unfortunately, this
picture has some very big flaws such as neglecting the presence of its
supporting players which has plagued Attenborough throughout his
directorial career.  His 1992 film 'Chaplin' was a very entertaining
and deep biography about the life of Charles (Charlie) Chaplin played
by Robert Downey Jr. but Attenborough failed to develop the supporting
players such as Douglas Fairbanks (Kevin Kline) and Mary Pickford
(Maria Pitillo) both of whom helped Chaplin establish United Artists
along with the pioneering film director D.W.  Griffith in 1919.  Even
the character of legendary FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (Kevin Dunn)
could have been played better with coaching and script changes
influenced by Attenborough.  'In Love and War' is basically a two
character story when it should really have involved its supporting
players better.  It also suffers from a tedious pace and a lackluster
use of music score which enhances most romantic sagas.  It is an
exceptional visual experience as the landscapes of Italy and Canada
serve as the film's location points and are very well photographed.
This film is suited to audiences of extreme literary taste and
dedicated lovers of film romance.  Others beware!</P>
