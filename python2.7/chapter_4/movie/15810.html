<PRE>Review:        LITTLE VOICE</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor
                With Jane Horrocks as Little Voice</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Mark Herman</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>Jane Horrocks, who stars as L.V. or `Little Voice', is unknown to most
filmgoers but this movie wouldn't have been the same without her.  It was
written specifically for her and her ability to duplicate the incredible
voices of various singing legends.</P>
<P>L.V. lives with her mother, Mari Hoff, played by Brenda Blethyn, in rooms
over their former record store.  Music had been her father's love and when
he died, the store, his records and memories were all that remained.  The
mother longs for romance and excitement.  She's not ready to be a weeping
widow.   She is attracted to a man, Ray Say, who is a talent agent of
sorts, portrayed by Michael Caine.  He puts up a flashy front while hoping
to find that one performer who will establish him and make him rich.</P>
<P>A telephone installer named George [Philip Jackson] and his assistant,
Billy  [Ewan McGregor] meet the mother and daughter while connecting a new
phone line.  The lecherous and married George is hoping for a quick
interlude with  Mari but Billy is attracted to the taciturn L.V.  He is
the silent type who raises homing pigeons on the rooftop and who lacks the
wherewithal to pursue L.V.</P>
<P>One night when Ray overhears L.V., alone in her room, singing in a loud
voice reminiscent of Judy Garland, he knows that he's finally found his
star, his meal ticket.</P>
<P>It isn't easy convincing L.V. to agree to sing in front of a live
audience.  The circumstances of the appearance and what follow are what
make this a truly memorable film.  There are numerous classic songs that
the older generation will appreciate.  They include: The Man That Got
Away, Hey, Big Spender,  Lover Boy, Get Happy, and many others.  </P>
<P>The three leads all give Oscar winning performances.  Hopefully, they'll
be nominated.  Brenda Blethyn is just tawdry enough as a love-hungry but
vulnerable older woman.  Michael Caine totally conveys the depths of this
likeable/unlikable usurious man.   Jane Horrocks is in a class by herself.</P>
<P>Mr. Boo [Jim Broadbent], the club owner where L.V. performs is another
little person  clinging to his pseudo-importance.  Annette Badland as
Sadie, the Hoff's neighbor across the street, delivers a small but classic
role.</P>
<PRE>I give this a solid A.    </PRE>
