<PRE>Ulee's Gold (1997)</PRE>
<P>In a summer with movies filled with explosions, chases, and stunts, it is
interesting to see a movie centered around a quiet beekeeper who faces an
equal amount of danger with grace and patience. </P>
<P>Peter Fonda might have gone down in film history best known for being
Henry Fonda's son and having been in a film that influenced a generation
(Easy Rider); but now he will have made an indellible impression on
anybody who sees Ulee's Gold. Fonda has mentioned in interviews that
he emulated his father when preparing for this role. </P>
<P>Ulysses Jackson spends his days and years as he always has; living in
central Florida, looking after his bees and keeping his family business
within the family. Ulee is raising two granddaughters--Casey and Penny.
Their father Jimmy is in jail and their mother, Helen, has left them to do
God only knows what in Orlando.</P>
<P>Life is humming along as it needs to until the sins of the son are visited
on the father as well as the rest of the clan. Ulysses winds up leaving
his bees at the most crucial time of the season when he is asked to go
retrieve Helen (Christine Dunford) from Orlando, where Eddie and
Ferris--two criminal associates of Jimmy's--have loaded her up on drugs,
or have taken advantage of her condition, and have discovered that Ulee
can find something they want. They make it clear that they will do harm to
the family if he doesn't comply. </P>
<P>Of course, all of this is a red herring. Much like The 39 Steps, Ulee
learns that no man is an island. Ulee is forced to realize that sometimes,
you need to accept help, and help others. Shut down since his wife
Penelope has died, Ulee finds that he is going to have to trust someone,
and that someone is his tenant Connie Hope (Patricia Richardson), a doctor
who helps detox his daughter-in-law. Even while a dangerous situation
exists, Ulee continues his backbreaking labors, but gets help from his
granddaughters and even his daughter-in-law, slowly, one by one</P>
<P>Great performances are turned out by all. It was great to see Patricia
Richardson do something beyond the limitations of her role as Tim Allen's
wife on Home Improvement. Especially wonderful is Vanessa Zima as the
younger granddaughter, Penny. An rather wonderful scene is her description
to her mother of how the bees are sometimes scared and fly off, and have
to be brought back. Watch for it.</P>
<P>The movie makes some wonderful use of dissolves and jump cuts; they really
accentuate the monotony and continuity of the life Ulee leads in swampy
rural Florida. If the film has any fault, it is sparing the expenses on
sound. Some dialogue seems to get lost between regional dialect and/or
mumbling. Other than that, writer/director Victor Nunez.</P>
<P>P.S.: You get two extra points if you can think of a classical story in
which Ulysses must leave the stalwart Penelope to help find the lost
Helen.</P>
