<P>     Rarely has any film so accurately and effectively captured the 
essence of a human being -- the look, the feel, the mannerisms, the 
vocal inflections.  Benoit Jacquot's A SINGLE GIRL isn't a typical 
motion picture in any sense.  Narrative is curtailed in favor of pure 
character development, and the result is akin to suspending your own 
life for ninety minutes and spending that time living in someone else's 
skin.  It's extremely unusual for a director, actress, and writer to 
bring an audience into such a close rapport with a character. </P>
<P>     A SINGLE GIRL shows us seventy-five ordinary minutes in the life of 
Valerie (Virginie Ledoyen), a young woman who's beginning a new job as a 
room service waitress at a Paris hotel.  She's four weeks pregnant, and 
has just informed her boyfriend, Remi (Benoit Magimel).  Her life is at 
a watershed:  does she continue in a strained relationship with him that 
may lead to discord and abandonment, or does she make a clean break now 
and attempt to raise the baby on her own?  This is the question that 
preys upon her mind as she gets to know her co-workers and experiences 
the ups and downs of the morning room service rush. </P>
<P>     Not once in seventy-five minutes does Jacquot's film transition 
away from Valerie or jump forward in time.  It is strictly 
chronological, presenting a minute in real time as a minute in screen 
action.  The camera follows Valerie's every move, no matter how mundane.  
She's shown walking down streets and through the halls of the hotel, 
riding elevators, and stealing a moment for a quick smoke.  She's not 
just in every scene, she's in practically every frame. </P>
<P>     Yet, even though the voyeuristic perspective of the camera allows 
us intimate access to Valerie's thoughts and actions, it is not 
invasive, nor is it interested in exploitation.  For example, during a 
scene when she changes her clothes in a locker room, the camera cuts to 
her face, passing up the opportunity to peer at her topless body.  This 
scene clearly indicates what the director's motives are (and aren't) in 
telling this particular story in this manner. </P>
<P>     The quiet, intense realism of Virginie Ledoyen's (the daughter in 
LA CEREMONIE) performance is one of the paramount reasons for A SINGLE 
GIRL's unqualified success.  Not only does Ledoyen have a pleasant 
countenance for the camera to dote upon longingly, but she's a shrewd 
actress who understands the importance of details in making the 
character real.  There are numerous occasions when we understand 
Valerie's mindset and intentions as a result of some subtle action:  a 
gesture, an expression, or a mannerism.  Yes, Ledoyen is beautiful, but 
it's her aptitude, not her comeliness, that draws us in. </P>
<P>     A SINGLE GIRL concludes with a fifteen minute epilogue that takes 
place some three years after the bulk of the film.  It's a nice addition 
that offers a sense of closure to the story and answers many of the 
questions that couldn't have been resolved had Jacquot decided to 
restrict the entire movie to one time-frame.  The Valerie we meet in 
this future segment is a more mature, secure woman, but much of the same 
tempestuousness and obstinacy are still evident.  It's a credit to 
everyone involved that the growth and change of several years can be 
conveyed in such a relatively short sequence. </P>
<P>     When a character study fails, it is, more often than not, because 
the audience never really connects with the film's protagonist.  This is 
a flaw that never plagues A SINGLE GIRL, because Jacquot bends all of 
his film making talents to forging a deep link.  As a result, even 
though nothing much happens during the course of the movie (Valerie 
spends over half the running time wandering around the inside of a 
hotel), this is a thoroughly engrossing motion picture.  This is one 
single girl I wouldn't mind spending more time with. </P>
