<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A great low-budget heist film noir. In a remote part of Utah a gang robs a train
heading for San Francisco with $10,000 million in gold. They overcome the train
by blocking it, then using tear gas to overcome the motorman, and while wearing
white stockings to cover their faces they remove the gold mint onto their truck.</P>
<P>The gang members are: Eddie, the college educated leader and brains behind the
operation who is pulling off his first job; Skeets, who just got released from
jail and is despondent because his wife died, as he now plans to take his
teenage son to Rio to live in luxury; Frankie, a race car driver barred from
racing for life because he failed to follow the track rules during a race;
Commando, a happy-go-lucky bachelor who works as a stuntman; and Roly a regular
truck driver with a chewing gum habit. </P>
<P>The plan is to travel in three different trucks: a furniture moving van, a truck
carrying coffee, and a chemical tanker. They are separated by thirty minute
intervals, with the gold split in each truck and hidden, as they plan to reach
Los Angeles and melt the gold into the fenders of the three cars they purchased
under false names. They will then load them onto a boat they will board to take
them to Lisbon. </P>
<P>Roly leaves first carrying the furniture, but he panics at a roadblock when the
cop spots he hasn't turned off his police radio on his truck. He's killed when
he tries to make a run for it. The next truck loaded with coffee, driven by
Commando and Skeets, is nailed at the weighing station. Commando had just killed
a gas attendant in Nevada when he dropped his gun and panicked by killing the
old man. Eddie and Frankie get a close call at the weighing station but they are
the only ones to reach LA. Fran, Eddie's girlfriend, meets them at a foundry
where they melt down the gold and put it into the car bumpers and chrome. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph. </P>
<P>The next morning, on their way to the boat, they get into a fender bender on the
crowded freeway as a woman driver gawking at a traffic accident rams them and
when the police try to separate the cars the chrome becomes loose revealing the
gold. Frankie is shot trying to draw his gun; Eddie gets crushed to death trying
to jump off the overpass onto a passing truck; and, Fran gets captured trying to
run away. </P>
<P>The gang is shown to be a bunch of losers who foul up a great plan by their bad
luck, insecurities, and their plan being too complicated for them to handle
despite how marvelously it was planned out. Perennial losers in filmdom, Elisha
Cook, Jr. and 
Stafford Repp, fit right in to this plot. It made for a very entertaining film.</P>
