<P>     What starts out as a short trip into family entertainment ends up 
as an interminable, dead-end journey that's likely to have both kids and 
adults asking the question, "When are we going to get there?"  This is 
the longest-seeming chase movie since Charlie Sheen fled the police in 
1993's THE CHASE, but it's not nearly as amusing.  Ninety minutes stuck 
in a minivan with Tom Arnold, David Paymer, and five annoying kids is 
not my idea of a fun time at the movies.  And, if for some reason you 
decide to see CARPOOL, it probably won't be yours, either.</P>
<P>     Things might have been okay if this film had gone someplace, 
anyplace, but it stalls early, then coasts through an hour of minimally-
amusing material before screeching to an amazingly improbable stop.  The 
humor is too feeble to overcome the repetitive lethargy of the formulaic 
storyline.  Sure, it's fun to see a few cars careening around inside a 
mall, but do we really need to endure fifteen minutes of such filler?</P>
<P>     CARPOOL introduces us to Daniel Miller (David Paymer), one of the 
most anal retentive ad men in the world.  He's so obsessed with being 
punctual that he sets his watch ahead ten minutes.  How he managed to 
marry a beautiful wife and take enough time off to have two kids are 
mysteries the script doesn't address.  On the morning of his big 
presentation at work, his wife is ill, so, despite all his worries about 
being late, he has to drive the carpool.  One-by-one, he picks up his 
five passengers, but, because nobody had breakfast, Daniel has to stop 
at the local supermarket to buy some donuts.  While he's waiting in the 
checkout line, he becomes involved in a stick up.  Soon, he's being held 
hostage by Franklin Laszlo (Tom Arnold), an innocent customer who is 
mistakenly identified as the robber.  With Daniel and his five young 
charges in tow, Franklin makes his getaway.</P>
<P>     As things develop, it turns out that the kids like Franklin, the 
"nice bad man", better than Daniel, the workaholic good guy.  So, during 
the course of their flight from a couple of incompetent cops (Kim Coates 
and Rhea Perlman), Franklin and Daniel bond, and the repressed father 
learns to let loose and have fun.  By the end, he's actually trying to 
help Franklin avoid the police and a jail sentence.  If you're 
interested in seeing just how far some movies will flaunt logic and 
believability in order to attain the happiest possible ending, CARPOOL 
would make a good case study.</P>
<P>     Tom Arnold brings a likable, off-the-wall enthusiasm to his role, 
blunting the more abrasive edges of his usual screen personality to 
present someone whom children will find appealing.  In fact, Arnold's 
performance is the only enjoyable aspect of this production.  David 
Paymer is adequate as the stiff-as-a-board Daniel -- this is the kind of 
role he's played more than once.  Rhea Perlman and Kim Coates, who are 
supposed to be contemporary keystone cops, are more irritating than 
funny.  And all of the child performers could use a few years of acting 
school.</P>
<P>     A handful of CARPOOL's jokes work, but, basically, this is just the 
latest in a long line of dumb motion pictures thrown out in an attempt 
to sucker in families.  It's an offensive movie -- not as a result of 
salacious or violent content, but because it takes for granted a 
fundamental lack of audience intelligence.  Neither children nor their 
parents are quite as stupid as the film makers think they are, and, 
despite the promise of the accompanying Loony Toons cartoon, "Superior 
Duck", it's likely that CARPOOL is headed for a deserved box-office 
wreck.</P>
