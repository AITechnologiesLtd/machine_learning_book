<PRE>The Other Sister (1999)
*
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>Some subjects never get a fair shake in the movies.  Mental retardation is
one: offhand, I can only think of two movies that had retarded characters who
were entirely convincing and human.  "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" and
"Dominick and Eugene" were both wonderful movies regardless of their subject
matter.</P>
<P>Maybe that's the heart of the problem.        "The Other Sister" would be a
dreadful movie even if the retarded characters were Nobel laurelates.  It's
overlong (130 minutes), overplotted, tedious, contrived, and absolutely
agonizing to endure -- especially if your understanding of mental retardation
goes beyond TV movies-of-the-week.</P>
<P>In the film, Juliette Lewis plays Carla, a retarded girl of 18 who has spent
most of her youth in an institution for the mentally handicapped.  She now
wants to go back home and train to be a veterinarian, but her mother (Diane
Keaton), as is always the case in movies like this, is opposed to her
daughter doing anything that doesn't fulfill the label of "retarded person". 
The father (Tom Skerritt) is all for it, of course.  It wouldn't be a movie
without conflict, but the conflict here is fake.</P>
<P>Carla eventually enrolls in a local polytechnical school and meets up with
Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), who is also retarded, and whose job seems to consist
of unstopping the brass instruments in the school band after they've been
pelted with marshmallows during football games.  Yes.  Why are they
interested in each other at all, retardation aside?  A more honest movie
would not need to use manufactured scenes, like the cringe-inducing one where
they puzzle over "The Joy of Sex", to make them comprehensible as a couple.</P>
<P>The movie also commits the cardinal sin so common to movies like this, where
retardation is used as a gimmick and not taken seriously.  In one scene, Danny
gets drunk (under circumstances which any bartender or seasoned drinker would
find ludicrous) and delivers a speech that is so obviously not his own words,
but the screenwriter speaking through him.  How's about that?  The movie not
only doesn't bother to give us convincing characters who are retarded -- it
doesn't even allow them freedom of speech!</P>
<P>I know a fair number of retarded people.  Most of them resent being
condescended to; they are not "cute", not "quaint", not "funny", and certainly
not insensitive to callousness.  They are also, alas, not as sitcom-witty as
the folks in "The Other Sister", but that's life: nobody in real life talks
like a sitcom (and if you do, see a doctor).</P>
<P>The director, Garry Marshall, has Ribisi and Lewis act retarded by having
them garble half their lines and walk funny.  Does he know anyone who is
retarded? Dd they really think that the lameness of the performances would be
overcome by everyone's good intentions?  Didn't anyone realize how contrived
and phony this story was, before it was put on the rails?  Evidently not. 
"The Other Sister" (even the title is virtually inexplicable) is going to be
stuck in my craw for a long time as one of the worst movies of 1999.</P>
