<P>     Most films about con artists treat the Big Con as the only reason the
story exists; once it's clear who's been had and who's done the having,
it's time to strike the set and call it a wrap.  Not so for TRAVELLER, a
frisky and well-crafted drama which takes the time to develop its
characters and its atmosphere.  Bill Paxton (who also produced) stars as
Bokky, a member of an intensely insular band of small-time grifters
descended from the Travellers of Ireland.  Bokky's simple, solitary life
running short cons through the Carolinas is complicated by two coinciding
events: the arrival of Pat O'Hara (Mark Wahlberg), the son of an outcast
Traveller who wants to return to the fold, and Bokky's romantic interest
in a single mother named Jean (Julianna Margulies) who falls for one of
his scams.  </P>
<P>     Bokky becomes Pat's mentor in the family business, creating plenty of
entertaining opportunities for the audience to watch the development of
their cons.  Screenwriter Jim McGlynn wisely avoids turning those scenes
into the foundation of TRAVELLER, instead allowing them to act as comic
flavoring for a nicely observed character study.  Paxton, Wahlberg,
Margulies and James Gammon (as a veteran con man who tries to pull Bokky
into one of his schemes) all turn in solid performances, with Paxton and
Margulies showing a particular chemistry in their sexy scenes together.
The actors make TRAVELLER consistently interesting to watch while McGlynn
and director Jack Green (the gifted cinematographer of UNFORGIVEN and THE
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, making his directing debut) slowly explore
their relationships.</P>
<P>     And there are plenty of relationships to explore.  One of TRAVELLER's
most noticeable short-comings is that it feels crowded with characters and
sub-plots:  the medical problems of Jean's daughter, Pat's flirtation with
the daughter of the Travellers' leader, the appearance of vengeance-minded 
Romany gypsies.  These tangents push the film's most unique element -- the
culture of the Travellers -- into the background; the production notes
provide more sense of who the Travellers are than the film itself.  As the
climax of the film turns into a violent hostage drama, TRAVELLER begins to
feel rather generic, as though its unique spirit has been compromised for
manufactured conflict.  Still, there is plenty to like about TRAVELLER,
from its casually confident pacing to its evocative soundtrack of blues
and country classics.  Thanks to rich characterizations and a strong cast,
this is one story of con men in which the "men" are more important than
the "con."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 kings of the road:  7.</PRE>
