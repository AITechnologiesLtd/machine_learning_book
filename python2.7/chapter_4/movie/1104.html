<PRE>                                DOC HOLLYWOOD
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     DOC HOLLYWOOD is a movie directed by Michael Caton-Jones.  The
screenplay is by Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, and Daniel Pyne, based
on the book "What? ... Dead Again?" by Neil B. Shulman, M.D.  It
stars Michael J. Fox, Julie Warner, David Odgen Stiers, Woody Harelson,
and Bridget Fonda.  Rated PG-13, for mature humor and brief nudity.</P>
<P>     DOC HOLLYWOOD is being called by the local newspaper critics
Southern Exposure; apparently the plot is virtually identical to the
current hit TV series "Northern Exposure."  You tell me, since I live in
a TV-free zone (as I like to mention from time to time), but it does
sound remarkably similar.  A young, hot doc on his way to major bucks
instead gets stranded in a looney-bin hick town.  In Fox's case, the
town is Grady, S.C., (admirably played by Micanopy, Fla.), a town
apparently as TV-free as my own living room.  The fantasy nature of DOC
HOLLYWOOD is most evident in the lack of TV or radio or newspapers or
anything else that might connect the loonies of Grady, "The Squash
Capital of the South," "the buckle on the Bible Belt," with the outside
world.  Once Fox misses the freeway access, he and we are in a Twilight
Zone episode, and if you find yourself looking for a pre-cancerous Rod
Serling to smoulder out from behind a porch post saying "For your
consideration," you are on the correct wavelength.</P>
<P>     It's also a little hard to accept Fox as a hotshot, since the only
reason we're given to accept his status as a major surgical talent is
his show-room perfect 1956 Porsche.  On the other hand, Fox is cute,
effortlessly funny, energetic, and entertaining.  (And I note with some
pleasure that neither disease nor accident nor violence is necessary to 
change this snotty, heartless, little prick into a real mensch -- unlike
THE DOCTOR or REGARDING HENRY.)</P>
<P>     Other cast members are well chosen.  Bridget Fonda is the mayor's
daughter, who will do anything to get to L.A.; her performance has a
kind of Fifties ambience to it -- sexy, innocent, open, devious -- and I
find myself liking her a lot.  The mayor is David Ogden Stiers, to whom
the years since the end of M*A*S*H have not been particularly kind, but
who is still capable of a kind of all-out, pedal-to-the-metal
performance.  Julie Warner is very attractive; the first we see of her
is a skinny dipping scene that is probably more than a trifle
gratuitous; it just doesn't make sense dramatically, but as an excuse
for showcasing her beautiful breasts and nates I'm sure many of the
audience felt it worked.  Woody Harelson puts in an interesting
performance as the insurance man who wants to sign up Warner for a life
policy; he also gets off a major funny at the expense of Ted Danson, his
co-star on "Cheers," as I understand it.</P>
<P>     The movie also has a couple of amusing cameos: the director plays
the maitre d'hotel in a Beverly Hills beanery and the head of the
plastic-surgery that Fox wants a job at turns out to be an uncredited
and entirely appropriate choice.  This is not quite the secret as the
ROBIN HOOD cameo, but I can stand not spoiling for you.</P>
<P>     Caton-Jones, the director also of MEMPHIS BELLE, seems quite
comfortable with his Southern locale, despite his own Scottish
nationality.  Unfortunately, the scriptwriters were less than original
overall.  They did manage to come up with a few scenes that really
worked, such as the ultra-romantic scene of Fox and Warner dancing at
the town squash festival, and the tone of the movie in general light,
harmless, and it moves along at a fairly good clip.  It's a little too
long, a little too predictable, a little unmotivated here and there, but
it still manages to provides some entertainment.  And right now in the
dog days of summer releases, that's a lot.</P>
<P>     I recommend DOC HOLLYWOOD to a tolerant viewer who's looking for
some late summer entertainment.  But pay matinee prices, that's all it's
worth, but it is worth that much.</P>
