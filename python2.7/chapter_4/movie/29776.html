<P>PLOT:
In the mid-19th century, thousands of peasants are being used and abused by the
tyrannical leader of Zhejing, a province in Eastern China. One man (no, not a
monkey) decides to take matters into his own hands by masking his identity and
kicking a lot of bad guy ass. He also steals from the rich and gives to the
poor. But another master fighter has now been hired to bring him to justice (and
to find him, for that matter- who is this Iron Monkey?) Lots of chop-chopping
later...we're breathless. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
What more can I say other than...a whole lotta ass-kickin' fun! And coming from
the dude who choreographed THE MATRIX and the CROUCHING TIGER fight sequences,
what else did we expect, right? Yuen Wo Ping directed this movie back in 1993,
and now Miramax Films and Quentin Tarantino are bringing it back to the big
screen for all the "new" kung-fu movie fans to behold. Is it worth seeing?
Ooooooh, yeah! Especially if you were one of those people who was entranced by
the action scenes in CROUCHING TIGER last year, because this film has a lot of
that and well...a whole lot more of that! It's basically all about the fight
scenes and they do not disappoint. Stunt work like you wouldn't believe, people
flying through the air, kicking each other while falling off rooftops, punching
tables into others, crushing furniture into dust, using every and any means
possible to defeat the enemy. Very creative stuff and very fun to watch, that
is...if you like that kind of thing. The story here isn't the poetic, epic or
romantic one that CROUCHING was, so anyone looking for that kind of vibe, will
likely be disappointed. This movie is basically all about kicking a lot of
kung-fu butt and if you're into that, and don't mind watching it over and over
again, then this movie is just for you. The story is "okay" for the most part,
the IRON MONKEY character is basically like a Chinese version of ZORRO or ROBIN
HOOD, fighting for the poor and all that jazz, and it shouldn't be too difficult
to keep up with the basic plotline ("who is Iron Monkey? We must stop him!").
Although, I suppose that the subtitles might piss some people off, but I didn't
have much of a problem with it.</P>
<P>There are also a lot of different kinds of fights in this movie, a couple of
which include a woman at their center and another one with a kid crunching
bones. I personally could have done without each of the fighters chiming in with
the name of their specific combat stance as they were fighting, but maybe that's
just me. The film also has a few funny moments, like the cooking scene and
another one in which two of the film's lead characters dress up like politicians
and ham it up. But in the beginning, in the end and in the middle of all the
rest of this film, lies a whole lotta punchin', kickin', swingin', proddin',
shovin', jammin' and iron monkeyin', and that's what will keep your eyes open
for the film's quick 90 minute runtime. And just when you think that you've had
enough of the movie's elaborate fight sequences, they finish off with one of the
most amazing action scenes that I have seen in some time. Three men stand atop
poles, with fires flaming on all around them, and proceed to punch, kick and
jump at and over one another for minutes on end. This sequence will leave you
speechless and had me rubbing my eyes over and over again, to make sure that I
wasn't dreaming. Truly spectacular. But this film is not for everyone. It's very
cartoonish, a little cheesy, is packed with action (although there are very few
real deaths (if any?)) and doesn't really give you a lot of meat in which to
grind your mind. But then again, why bother with an intricate plotline when you
can see a man fighting another man with his sleeve?!? Yeah man...it's in
film...see for yourself!</P>
<P>PS: The character of the young kid in this movie is named Wong Fei-Hong, a
real-life, turn-of-the-century martial artist and patriot. He is the same
character as an adult in the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA flicks (in that sense,
this film is like a prequel to that series) and Jackie Chan's DRUNKEN MASTER
movies. And even though very little was known about the real Wong Fei-Hong's
childhood, many legends were told, which is what drew writer Tsui Hark to write
this tale of the IRON MONKEY.</P>
