<P>Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of The Truman Show, one of the
most popular TV shows on the planet. People around the world watch
Truman's life as an insurance executive in the coastal town of Seahaven.
Although Truman is a popular member of  the community, he is the only
one who isn't paid to live there - because everyone else is an actor.
Thousands of strategically-placed cameras follow Truman's every move, as
he interacts with hundreds of people who are following the orders of a
TV director, high in the sky.</P>
<P>This massive conspiracy was conceived decades ago, when Truman was
chosen from several unwanted babies. Adopted by a corporation, Truman
became the object of a fantastic experiment to televise an entire life
-- the ultimate reality show. There's no script for Truman, but everyone
else in town has a role to play, while only some have speaking parts.
Others just play "extras," pretending to be about their lives, providing
a natural traffic for Truman's world.</P>
<P>The deception is most cruel in that his wife (Laura Linney), his best
friend (Noah Emmerich), and his parents are not only acting their
affection, but they are subtly steering Truman in his choices. From
childhood, his wanderlust was pooh-poohed by those around him, and the
customized media that he sees is styled to induce fear of travel. As a
teenager, he was attracted to the wrong girl - an "extra." The producers
whisked her (Natascha McElhone) away, so that he would marry Meryl. </P>
<P>But that incident and others left Truman confused. In a 24-hour
production day, many things could go wrong, and incidents build up. We
see a few overt miscues, and Truman is awakened from his non-questioning
complaisance.  His new awareness and his canny attempt to get to the
truth makes for an exciting story.</P>
<P>This is the perfect role for Jim Carrey, especially at this stage of his
career. His comedy genius has charmed millions of ticket-buyers, but
there is a handsome leading man hiding in there. We know it, but he
is a rare talent, and we don't want to lose him like we lost Spielberg.
The Cable Guy showed us that our fears were well founded, but Truman
provides the perfect vehicle. Carrey is still permitted to amuse us with
little fantasy scenes that Truman has in front of his bathroom mirror. I
doubt that any were scripted.</P>
<P>Delivering this transitional gem is reason enough to praise director
Peter Weir (Witness). The material speaks so clearly that I doubt he had
any trouble reigning in Jim's wild ways. Ed Harris is stuck with the
non-role of Cristof, director of the Truman Show. Dennis Hopper bailed,
and Ed replaced him, but  maybe Dennis had the right idea. The
Uber-director and the constructed dome/studio seemed like plot devices.
Their artificiality was in stark contrast to Carrey's beautifully
natural performance.
Waytogo, Jim!</P>
