<PRE>SAVING SILVERMAN
----------------</PRE>
<P>Long time buddies and Neil Diamond tribute band members Wayne (Steve Zahn,
"Happy, Texas") and J.D. (Jack Black, "High Fidelity") watch in horror
as third mate Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs, "American Pie") disappears under 
the thumb of his new fiance Judith, (Amanda Peet, "The Whole Nine Yards") a
controlling psychiatrist.  They're doubly troubled when the return of Darren's 
'one and only love' Sandy Perkins (Amanda Detmer, "Final Destination") returns 
to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in Darren's devotion to Judith.
There's only one thing Wayne and J.D. can think of doing - they kidnap
Judith and fake her death in "Saving Silverman."</P>
<P>Written by Hank Nelken and Greg DePaul after seeing a friend engaged to
the wrong woman, "Saving Silverman" is directed by 'hit comedy director'
Dennis Dugan of such films as "Big Daddy," " Brain Donors" and "Problem
Child."  It's a dismal, third-rate Farrelly Brothers rip off that
attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having Darren's
love interest come from a family of circus freaks AND be about to become
a nun.  Gross out gags include a visualization of Darren getting butt cheek
implants.</P>
<P>"Saving Silverman" is almost saved by stars Zahn and Black.  These two are so
comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods.
They're in "Animal House" mode while the rest of the film trawls along and
comes up empty.  Jason Biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of
having been cast in the smash hit "American Pie."  Peet shows some physical
moves but no flair for comedy here while Detmer slaps a brave, sweet smile
onto her face and soldiers through.  R. Lee Ermey ("Full Metal Jacket") is
one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic ex-football coach.
Neil Diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens
the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards.</P>
