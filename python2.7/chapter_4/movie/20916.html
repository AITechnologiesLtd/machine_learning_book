<PRE>20 Dates (R) * 1/2
Starring Myles Berkowitz, Elizabeth Wagner 
Directed by Myles Berkowitz
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There are so many people that live their lives wanting to become a filmmaker or
do something in the film related business. Every year they enter our nation's
film schools with the high hopes that they too may one day make a movie that
will be loved and adored by millions, then make a billion dollars, earn
themselves a lifelong career, and start dating a supermodel. But seriously, how
often does this type of thing really happen? 20 Dates is supposed to be a movie
about a guy that goes on twenty different dates in LA and secretly films them
to show what real life dating is like. However, I actually found the film to be
much more of the man's quest to make his first ever Hollywood movie.</P>
<P>Myles Berkowitz is an aspiring filmmaker who's come up with a brilliant idea.
He's going to film 20 dates with 20 different women to see what dating and love
is really like, instead of what we are usually shown in the movies. His first
problem is funding, on what are supposedly secretly taped conversations Myles
and Elie Samaha, who's forking over the $60,000 to make the picture will only
do it if he can hire actresses to go out with him. Myles sees this as trying to
kill his artistic vision, but he's the producer so sooner or later he will have
to agree.</P>
<P>As the film (and a restraining order from a woman who didn't want to be filmed)
go by Elie wants more nudity and more sex in the film and refuses to fund it
unless Tia Carrere is in the picture. This troubles Myles because he's just
met, Elizabeth, he's crazy for her and she seems to be marraige material. So
Myles faces a choice, should he finish the dates and start his movie career, or
should he stay with possibly the only woman that he will ever truly love?
Yawn...</P>
<P>For trying to be edgy and interesting, and being unlike regular love stories,
this film certainly is what's it's trying not to be. None of the dates Myles
takes out are all that interesting and as for Myles himself, he's so god dang
self-involved that I hated him at about the 10 minute point. An interesting
concept with a bad result, 20 Dates gets * 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Strong language, brief images of strippers in strip clubs, and
lots of talk about putting sex and nudity into the picture make up the most
worrysome content. Good Age: 14 & Up</P>
