<P>In 1993, a group of young independent filmmakers submitted a black and
white short film titled, BOTTLE ROCKET for consideration at the 1994
Sundance Film Festival. It was accepted. There, the short film caught the
eye of Texas-based screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson. Two years later, we have
the feature-length version of the same film produced by James L. Brooks.
This is every struggling filmmaker's dream.</P>
<P>BOTTLE ROCKET, dubbed as "Reservoir Geeks", is one of the funniest and
most originally written films I've seen in a long while. We follow Anthony
played by Luke Wilson who is just getting out of a voluntary hospital for
what he describes as 'exhaustion'. From there he re-teams with Dignan and
Bob, his two old friends. I really would hate to ruin a single scene if
you haven't watched this film yet. All I will tell you is that nothing
leads where you'd expect it, the characters are simple, charming and
wonderful to watch, and the film has a great little ending that will leave
you with a smile on your face (and maybe some sympathy in your heart).</P>
<P>The film was written by its director, Wes Anderson and by Owen Wilson who
plays the character, Dignan. These guys bring to the screen a film-sense
all their own. The characters were certainly written to play for laughs,
but each is portrayed honestly and we almost begin to respect them for how
simply they approach their lives. There is also a great last line that
gives us a sense of closure--that things have come full circle. I'd like
to see this film up for Best Original Screenplay. It won't be.</P>
<P>The film was directed in the same manner by which it was written, which is
to say, it presents the visual imagery under the same mindset that
produced the dialogue. Half of what you laugh at in this film comes from
visual cues expressed by the director, Wes Anderson. He knows what his
actors are capable of and how to send an idea about a scene through use of
the camera, shot selection and editing. His film is kinetic, it feels
alive. Also, he has composed an ending sequence for this film that will be
in my memory forever. I was actually a little moved by it.</P>
<P>Every single person in this film was casted perfectly, perhaps because the
characters were written for them. If you think about the fact that three
brothers and a few friends (excluding James Caan) comprise the cast, it is
even more impressive. They really have to be seen to be believed. But
then, the writing lends itself to the character quirks that make them seem
more human. My favorite line happens when Future Man has been making fun
of Dignan's jumpsuit. Anthony tries to cheer him up by saying, "Don't
worry about it, Dignan. Did you see what he was wearing?"  And Dignan
replies sheepishly, "Yeah. It was pretty cool."</P>
<P>In closing, if you enjoy films such as THE HUDSUCKER PROXY or RAISING
ARIZONA, you will love BOTTLE ROCKET. And the choice of title is pretty
interesting, too. The idea of a bottle rocket--it's something vivacious
and alive, and prone to violence, but the thing is really relatively
harmless. This describes Dignan perfectly. You've got to see it. </P>
