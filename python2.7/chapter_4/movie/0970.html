<PRE>                             DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Find out where Southern Californians go
     when they die.  Albert Brooks's life-after-death comedy is
     charming and fun, but sidesteps substance.  Rating: low +1.</P>
<P>     Albert Brooks writes, directs, and stars in subtle little comedies
about human foibles.  He has a good feel for small characters and a good ear
for dialogue.  His MODERN ROMANCE has him wooing a beautiful woman with whom
he is unable to get along.  His LOST IN AMERICA has him quitting a good job
in a fit of pique and then going out in an RV to discover a real America
that is not what he thought it was.  Each gives a hint what he thinks life
is about, but it is open to some interpretation.  In DEFENDING YOUR LIFE he
turns to fantasy so instead of hinting he can come right out and state his
values.</P>
<P>     A Brooksian character, Daniel, dies on his birthday and finds himself
in a very Californian view of an afterlife.  In Judgment City he is given a
hearing to defend his life and the way that he has led it.  At stake is
whether he will attain a higher plane in the next life or not.  Rather than
just hint at his values, the way Brooks as screenwriter did in previous
films, he now can posit a heavenly host who can say, "This is the standard
by which you will be judged."  And his standard comes down to "Be brave."
If you do not insist on the salary you think you deserve, if you do not take
a chance on your investments, if you do not have sex with someone when you
want it, it will be held against you in Brooks's afterlife.  Ethics count
for nothing.  Helping others if not done in a spectacular feat of courage
counts for nothing.  Courage is what counts.  What could have been a view
into Brooks's personal philosophy suffers greatly from the apparent
shallowness of that philosophy.</P>
<P>     At heart then, the film misses a chance to be about something profound
and instead is just another film like L. A. STORY and SCENES FROM A MALL
about California values.  This particular vision of Limbo-adjusted-for-
Californians is a vision of what Brooks thinks his contemporaries would like
in an afterlife.  It is garish hotels and gourmet food.  You can eat as much
as you like without worrying about calories, cholesterol, or capacity.
During the day you have hearings on your integrity as a person, then at
night you can go hear a comic or see what you were in previous lives in a
sort of upscale convention center.</P>
<P>     Brooks's character meets and falls in love with the perfect woman,
Julia (played by Meryl Streep).  She is easy-going and affable and was a
hero in her previous life.  Julia is not so much a woman as a walking good
example.  She is sailing through judgment while Daniel is having serious
problems with a strident prosecutor (played by Lee Grant) and an enigmatic
and strange attorney played by Rip Torn.</P>
<P>     DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is diverting, but the ending is weak and the
philosophy is shallow.  I rate it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
