Vampire$ by John Steakley. Running time: 107 minutes. Rated R (for

<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Vampires have been shown in movies through the years as blood-sucking
demons that prowl the night looking for a snack. The film's have ranged
from very good (Bram Stoker's Dracula) to just awful (Once Bitten).
Recently though, vampires have been very big. "Buffy, the Vampire
Slayer" is a huge TV hit and Blade did a bang-up job at the box office.
Now the most liked horror director has put his touch on the genre.</P>
<P>John Carpenter's Vampires is about Jack Crow (James Woods) who along
with a group of a dozen or so hunt down vampire nests. They use a
variety of automatic weapons (but they have to use a wooden stake also)
to beat up the vampires. They then use a pulley system to drag the vamps
into daylight which causes them to explode in a big fiery mess.</P>
<P>Jack Crow is your typical nonhero character. Carpenter has used this
character before in Escape from New York and Escape from L.A.. Crow is
so much like Kurt Russell's character in those two movies it makes you
wonder if Carpenter is losing originality. The only addition to the
character is that now he sounds like a Howard Stern wannabe. He drinks,
he swears, and he makes inappropriate conversations with priests.</P>
<P>After a tough day of work Crow and his team party at a nearby motel.
They are interrupted by a vampire named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), who
can't be hurt by automatic weapons or stakes, who brutally murders the
group. The only surviving members of the massacre are Crow, his right
hand man Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), and a hooker named Katrinia (Sheryl
Lee) who just happened to be at the party.</P>
<P>After Crow consults with his church "sponsors" who pay for the
destruction of the vampires, he finds out that Valek was the first
vampire ever. He plans to find a black cross and when he finds it he
will be able to create a new race of super vampires which can walk the
day. Katrinia, while at the party, was bitten by Valek before he took
out the rest of the group. She has 2 days before the vampire 'virus'
overcomes her. In these 2 days she is able to have a physic link with
Valek and is able to see what he sees. Crow and Montayo use this to stop
the evil vampire from destroying the world.</P>
<P>John Carpenter is one of the most well liked director's in the
horror/sci-fi/action genre. He has made such classics as Halloween and
The Thing (not 1951 version). His 70s and 80s collection of films have
developed a huge following by fans of the genre. Then the 90s came
around and his movies
went into the toilet. No J.C. film in the 90s has been worthwhile.
Vampires is quite a bit better than most of his productions of this
decade but that's not saying much.</P>
<P>What Carpenter was known for is the horror classic Halloween. In that
movie he relied heavily on tense music (which he almost always creates
himself) and wonderfully made scenes to the scare the heck out of
everyone. Although Halloween is a violent movie with a pretty high body
count, the film didn't rely on gore to create scary situations. Vampires
believes that if we see a vampire knock a priest's head off with bloody
results we are going to be scared. This is not true.</P>
<P>Another major complaint I have with the film though is the villain.
Valek just isn't that good of a villain. He's your tired old character
who is indestructible and will stop at nothing to rid the world of good
guys. He vanishes from the screen many times in this movie for 15
minutes sometimes. Then when he reappears he just kills a church member
who is in his way (seen mostly through psychic images in Katrinia's
mind) and then disappears.</P>
<P>Of course Vampires isn't all bad. Woods does a good job as the anti-hero
and will no doubt be well liked by Carpenter fans. The vampire hunting
sequences (which are suprisingly short and far apart) are cool. They are
brutal fights with machine guns firing everywhere and vampires erupting
in fire. Scenes of Crow burying his dead group members are great. I can
just barely recommend this movie to fans of John Carpenter or of violent
action/horror movies.</P>
<P>Vampires, had it been done more originally, could have been a great
horror film and one of Carpenter's best. But it is currently just a
mixed bag of a movie that supplies some quick small thrills and is
easily forgotten.</P>
