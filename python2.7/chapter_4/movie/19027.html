<P>Starring Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave. Rated R.</P>
<P>Not too many people know who James Whale is, but it's a safe bet that a
good chunk of them have seen his movies. If we are to believe the semi-
biographical Gods and Monsters, Whale would have wanted it to be that
way. This is an insightful, haunting exploration of the last days of the
Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein director, and it is notable for
introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a Hollywood
movie.</P>
<P>Gods and Monsters has no interest in being a biopic of Whale's life
because it tracks only the final few days of his life, and it's probably
a better movie for it. It's focus is on Whale's (Ian McKellen)
untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener Clayton Boone
(Brendan Fraser). It begins with Whale (a fairly talented artist, aside
from being a director) asking Boone to "sit for him," (pose for a
portrait). At first, Boone doesn't realize that Whale is gay and grows
fascinated with the old man. When he does discover Whale's sexual
orientation from his dedicated and protective maid (Lynn Redgrave), he
is frightened, refusing to sit for the guy. But he comes back, only to
storm out again, disgusted with Whale's "locker room talk." Boone
returns yet another time, after Whale promises to tone down the
aforementioned "locker room talk," and finds their platonic relationship
to be strengthening.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental
attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago. His ailment leads to
desperation and depression, which build to the point where he is forced
to ask Boone for an incredulously big favor.</P>
<P>What is perhaps most sensational about Gods and Monsters is Brendan
Fraser's bravura performance; up until seeing this film I intensely
disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he
is in (Blast From the Past, for example). I was surprised how expressive
an actor he proved himself to be here. This is impressive because his
character's dialogue is minimal, with McKellan doing most of the
talking. That requires Fraser to act through body language; a difficult
skill to master, but something he proves capable of doing well.</P>
<P>This is not to ignore McKellan's Oscar nominated turn. He earned that
nomination with his touching performance here (although, at the risk of
sounding like a philistine, I would have chosen his performance as the
Nazi in Apt Pupil for the nomination); an understated, compelling gem.</P>
<P>Whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the Hollywood
horror genre, and he thought Hollywood to be the equivalent of a
battlefield. He rejoiced in being free from it, only reluctantly going
to receptions with fellow movie people. In the end, perhaps, it is what
killed him: the memories of Hollywood and war blending together to form
a living nightmare.
