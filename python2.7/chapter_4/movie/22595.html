<PRE>AMERICAN BEAUTY (M).  
(Dreamworks/UIP)
Director: Sam Mendes
Stars: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Mena 
Suvari, Wes Bentley, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Scott Bakula,
Sam Robards
Running time: 122 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Yet another biting satire that savagely deconstructs the
notion of wholesome family values in the heartland of American
suburbia.  As an exploration of dysfunctional families, the erosion of
family values and the souring of the American dream, American Beauty
is a fascinating and insightful character driven piece that explores
similar territory to films like The Ice Storm and the recent
Happiness.  However, this is a far more enjoyable film than Happiness,
with which it shares a number of thematic similarities.  Although
there is a nasty edge to this ironically titled comedy, there is also
a strong vein of irreverent humour and compassion running throughout.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey is superbly droll and bitingly acerbic as Lester
Burnham, a middle aged man who is suffering burn out.  He is bored
with his life and his marriage to the ambitious, shrewish, neurotic
and sarcastic Carolyn (Annette Bening).  But then he becomes attracted
towards Angela (Mena Suvari, recently seen in American Pie, etc), the
shallow, self-centred cheerleader, who is also the best friend of his
teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch).</P>
<P>Apathy soon gives way to a new enthusiasm for life that
confuses his family.  He quits his job as a sales executive with a
media company, wrangles a hefty $60,000 pay out, and sets about
changing his life.  Meanwhile Carolyn, a real estate agent, is
sexually attracted towards her rival (Peter Gallagher).  Adding to the
combustible mix are the Burnum's new neighbours, a homophobic retired
Marine (Chris Cooper), his mousy and withdrawn wife (Allison Janney)
and his enigmatic son Ricky (Wes Bentley), who obsessively captures
his surroundings on video.  It seems rather ironic that only the gay
couple (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards) who live next door may be the
only characters in this film who are truly happy with their lot.</P>
<P>Even the lesser characters are deftly observed in this
incisive, cutting and beautifully nuanced script from Alan Ball, a
veteran of television sitcoms (Cybill, etc).  The performances
throughout are uniformly impressive, and Oscar nominations seem
assured.  Spacey delivers easily his best screen performance for
years, and he brings a pathos and honesty to his character that is
perversely endearing.  Bening revels in her richly drawn character,
bringing an exuberant quality and a nicely hysterical edge to her
bitchiness and selfishness.</P>
<P>American Beauty is the first feature film from noted British
theatre director Sam Mendes, and he develops a superb rapport with his
ensemble cast and a great understanding into the complexities and
insecurities of the characters.  He brings an outsider's eye to this
bleak, edgy view of suburbia, and turns the camera into a scalpel,
with almost surgical precision.  Veteran cinematographer Conrad L Hall
brilliantly charts the gradually darkening tone of the film, from the
bright colours that characterise the deceptively sedate opening scenes
through to the grittier, more oppressive tones that mark the grim
finale.</P>
<P>American Beauty is a raw, uncompromising and archly cynical
view of contemporary America that should not be missed.</P>
