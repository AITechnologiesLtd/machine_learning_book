<PRE>EARTHQUAKE (1974)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Mark Robson
Writers: George Fox and Mario Puzo
Starring: Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Genieveve
Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gartner, Lorne Green, Victoria
Principal, Lloyd Nolan, Barry Sullivan, John Richardson, Donald Moffat,
Walter Matthau</P>
<P>I looked at the "Internet Movie Database"'s awards section for this
film, and found that THIS was nominated for a Golden Globe for "Best
Picture (Drama)."  Anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this:
this is the WORST of the "great" disaster films, and that's not really
saying a lot for this film.</P>
<P>"Earthquake" is basically notable because it originally included some
theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured. 
On video, it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of
different characters (the disaster film requisite), then brings them
together in the struggle against the big disaster.  While this worked
in, say, "The Towering Inferno," it doesn't here for one single reason:
we don't care about any of the characters.</P>
<P>The film gives us Charlton Heston (in one of many crap 70s films he
made, including "Skyjacked" and that classic, "Soylent Green") as a rich
man married to Ava Gardner, who is having a little affair with a young
single mom (Genieveve Bujold); a renegade police officer on suspension
(George Kennedy, in his least humored performance); in the second
weirdest subplot, a motorcycle stuntman (Richard Roundtree, right after
his "Shaft" thing) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that
goes upside down (yea, snore); and the weirdest subplot: a military
man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom Victoria
Principal, and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of
his hair (!!!).</P>
<P>In smaller subplots, there's a pointless bit about people who are flying
OVER L.A. (the city in the film, by the way), one who's playing cards
and married to a boring non-acting husband (you think this one can go
nowhere?  guess again.  he gets interested in the final frames); there's
Genieveve Bujold's moron son, who has a little adventure with wires; and
for some much-needed comedy, there's Walter Matthau (billed as Walter
Mutha.... - the only laugh in the film), as a wild drunkard, who's big
moment is a dance he does at a critical time.</P>
<P>As for the actual "earthquake," it's rather a let-down.  There's a full
hour of character-setups, none of which is interesting, then about 10
minutes of shaking, crumbling, and a bit where a house almost falls on
Bujold (narrowly missing).  This film needed that whole theatre-shaking:
they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored.</P>
<P>There's little suspense following the quake, although this film tries
for it.  There's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building,
the wires with the kid, and the movement of people who are all injured. 
But none of these are all-too suspenseful.  The finale with the
Heston/Gardner/Bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin
bit, which brings out a big let-down.  And there's no real finale.  Even
"Volcano" ended nicely, and that movie REALLY sucked.</P>
<P>Not only is it hokey, but you don't care about any character.  Who cares
if Heston dies?  Who cares if he choses Bujold or Gardner (although I
would have chosen Gardner, mainly on the basis that she can actually
act)?  Who cares if Richard Roundtree makes money on his stupid
"stunt?"  Who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires? 
And who cares about that whole plane spiel?</P>
<P>If anything, "Earthquake" is worth a viewing for the same reason "Glen
or Glenda?" is.  I mean, I laughed at this more than I did at "Bio
Dome."  But that's another story (and review).  In short, "Earthquake"
gives disaster pics a bad name.</P>
