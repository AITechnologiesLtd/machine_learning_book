<PRE>O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?
--------------------------</PRE>
<P>Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney, "Three Kings") takes his ball and
chain mates Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, "The Thin Red Line") and Pete
(John Turturro, "Rounders") on an escape from a 1930s Mississippi hard 
labor camp.  The three embark upon an adventurous road trip in a race against
time as Everett's gold is buried in an area slated to be flooded by the
Tennessee Valley Authority in Joel and Ethan Coen's "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?"</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>The Coen brothers excel at recreating American film genres and styles.
The ambitious "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" bears more than a passing
resemblance to its namesake, Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels"
(it was the name of the serious film comedy director John L. Sullivan 
(Joel McRea) wanted to make in that film before he discovered the value
of comedy).</P>
<P>The threesome are immediately in hot water when Pete's cousin, whom they
went to for shelter, turns them in.  ('Damn, we're in a tight spot!'
pronounces Everett.)  Menancing Sheriff Cooley (Daniel
Von Bargen, "The General's Daughter") and his pack of bloodhounds is
never far behind them from this point on.  After stealing a car, they
pick up a black blues guitarist, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King),
hitchhiking at crossroads in the middle of nowhere after selling his soul 
to the devil.  After a brief interlude where Delmar and Pete get baptized
they're cutting a record at a remote radio outpost as the Soggy Bottom
Boys.  Unbeknownst to them, their record climbs the charts as they
cross paths with Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco, "Summer of Sam"),
lose Pete to a trio of river Sirens (Delmar's convinced they've turned
him into a toad), get beaten and robbed by a maniacal bible salesman,
Big Dan Teague (Coens' vet John Goodman), and rescue Tommy from the Ku
Klux Klan in a scene straight out of the "Wizard of Oz!"  Then there's
the film's double climax as Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning)
challenges rival Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall, "The Deep End of the Ocean")
at a political rally while Everett attempts to woo back his wife Penny 
(Holly Hunter) followed by the final showdown with Sheriff Cooley.</P>
<P>The film is surreally funny, featuring oddball Coen humor such as Baby
Face Nelson shooting at cattle ('Oh George, not the livestock!' wails
Delmar) and Everett's constant search for his brand of hair pomade (Dapper
Dan's).  While it doesn't reach the heights of the Coens' very best
("Fargo," "Millers Crossing," "Blood Simple") because of its meandering
ways, it's a solid middle effort with charm to spare.</P>
<P>George Clooney channels the comedic charm of Clark Gable in a stylized,
yet pitch perfect performance.  Preening in a mirror or issuing the goofiest
of dance moves as a Soggy Bottom, Clooney fits into the Coen brothers' brand
of comedy like a custom tailored suit.  Tim Blake Nelson, known more for
his writing/directing skills behind the camera ("Eye of God"), is sweetly
stupid as the trusting, animal loving Delmar (butterflies are always drawn
to this character).  John Turturro is the high strung, manic member of the
threesome.  Of the supporting players, Stephen Root (TV's "Newsradio") gets
some mileage out of a brief appearance as a blind radio station manager
while Durning blusters and flusters as Pappy O'Daniel with his two yes
men and lookalike son Junior (Del Pentecost).  Other cast members mostly
go through the motions.</P>
<P>The film is beautifully shot in a golden glow by the Coens' frequent
cinematographer Roger Deakins ("Fargo").  T Bone Burnett provides the
authentically antique sounding music.</P>
