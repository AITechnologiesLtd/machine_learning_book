<P>     A lesson in short-term benefit vs. long-term detriment, courtesy of
screenwriters Ron Bass and Terry McMillan:  in the course of adapting
McMillan's novel HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK, the pair make a decision
which gives the first half a real kick, then kicks the second half into
oblivion.  The heroine of the title is Stella Payne (Angela Bassett), a
40-year-old San Francisco investment banker with a gorgeous house, an
11-year-old son (Michael J. Pagan), an ex-husband and no man in her life.
Itching for a change of pace while her son is visiting his father, Stella
calls up her New York-based best pal Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) and
suggests a week-long vacation in Jamaica.  Stella expects little more than
an uncomplicated island holiday, but instead finds complications galore
when she falls for 20-year-old Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), and he in
turn falls for her.</P>
<P>     The significant change involves Stella's companion on her Jamaican
adventure.  In McMillan's novel, Delilah does not join Stella on her trip;
in fact, Stella's life-long best friend is nearly two years dead.  Adding
Delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the second-chance romance
story line, particularly with Goldberg in the role.  Sure, Goldberg is
doing little more than an extended funky-sassy Miss Thang riff, but she's
always fun to watch, timing her salacious or sarcastic comments
impeccably.  Initially, it looks like a brilliant idea to give the staid
Stella a free-spirited foil.  Instead of the novel's hyper-introspective
first person narrative, STELLA on screen offers a bit more interplay, and
a bit more fun.</P>
<P>     So much for the short-term benefit.  The problem, as it turns out, is
that Delilah is phased out of the story fairly early on, leaving an energy
vacuum for Regina King (as Stella's hopelessly irresponsible sister) to
fill with only moderate success.  We're left with Stella fussing and
fretting over the age difference between her and Winston, and we're left
with a lot more questions regarding why Stella does what she does.
Delilah's absence in the novel becomes part of Stella's loneliness,
helping explain both her initial attraction to anyone who would fill the
void, and her doubts over how serious the relationship could possibly be.
As talented and forceful an actor as Angela Bassett can be, she plays
Stella with too much exuberant confidence.  Delilah's influence is
pervasive as the relationship blossoms; the bump-n-grind Stella we see in
Jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting
any of it back.</P>
<P>     The combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief
proves fatal in the film's final 45 minutes, when it becomes a genuine
butt-numbing ordeal.  The story simply has nowhere left to go but around
in circles:  there's some relationship talk, a bit of romance, tense
moments, and more relationship talk, all of it surrounding a relationship
with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving.  Newcomer Taye Diggs,
doing a barely serviceable Jamaican accent, has all the boyish charm the
role needs with about a tenth of the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom it
requires.  That leaves a whole lot of grating will-they-or-won't-they
vacillation over a pairing that, on screen, doesn't make much sense.  </P>
<P>     Bass and McMillan seemed to realize that the very internalized
nature of HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK required something different to
work as a film.  The big change they made had it heading in the right
direction, but it only emphasized how truly un-cinematic the rest of the
story could be.  Whoopi Goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery,
but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an
hour or so.  She also makes the rest of the film look like it's about a
different kind of groove:  the run-out groove.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 groove things:  4.</PRE>
