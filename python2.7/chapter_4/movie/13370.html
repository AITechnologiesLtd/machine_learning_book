<PRE>THE BOYS</PRE>
<PRE>Australia, 1997</PRE>
<PRE>Rated MA in Australia </PRE>
<PRE>Cast: David Wenham, Toni Collette, Lynette Curran, John Polson, Anthony
Hayes.                </PRE>
<PRE>Director: Rowan Woods        </PRE>
<P>Producers: Robert Connolly, Douglas Cummins, John Maynard, David Wenham        </P>
<P>Writers: Gordon Graham  (play),  Stephen Sewell</P>
<P>This is a disturbing and riveting movie. It opens with Brett Sprague
(Wenham) being released from jail and is picked up by one of his brothers,
Stevie (Hayes).  It's not long before we find out that Brett  is  the
alpha-male of this little pack. </P>
<P>Almost immediately we leap forward in time 18 hours. Hints abound that
something bad, very bad, has happened. Police radios crackle.  Brett and
his two brothers have been arrested.  A brief glimpse of something
unspeakable.</P>
<P>Then, just as quickly,  we fade back to the 'present' as Brett arrives home
to the domestic non-bliss of his mother's house. The characters are
introduced: Brett's other brother Glenn (Polson), Brett's girlfriend,
Michelle (Collette). His mum Sandra (Curren, the wonderful Betty in
"Bliss"). Stevie's little girl lost (and pregnant and unloved) 'girlfriend'
Nola. Tensions are building up inside the house.  Brett seems to have a
tranquil venom about him - calm on the surface, but the snake is in their.</P>
<P>What is disturbing is that we - as viewers - know from almost the opening
credits that something terrible is going to happen. We are shown the
aftermath in assorted flash-forwards: Brett burning clothes in the back
yard, Brett and brothers in jail etc. </P>
<P>These hints are interleaved with the story of the day of Brett's return
home. We see a family in trouble. The brothers just laze around, drinking
beer and seeing who is the biggest loser. Nola talks about escaping this
slow motion prison. Michelle taunts Brett. Brett taunts and accuses
everybody.  And poor Mum tries to hold it all together by cooking up a nice
Welcome Home dinner.</P>
<P>The intensity builds up as we flip back between the 'now' and even further
forward in time (sentencing, trial). But the audience is never told -
during these future bites - who the victim was or even what the crime was.
Is it the poor, sweet mother? The moping Nola?  The defiant Michelle?  The
man who put Brett in jail in the first place?  The 'now' story leaves
enough threads open so that it could be any of them. It is inevitable, this
evil. And there is nothing we can do but sit there in the dark cinema and
wait for it.</P>
<P>Wenham is outstanding in the lead role. His Brett has a quiet, brewing
evilness such that he dominates nearly every scene he is in.  Most of the
film takes place inside the house, indeed the film is based upon a play.
There is virtually no music on the soundtrack. </P>
<P>The performance of David Wenham alone makes this film worth seeing. Add in
very good supporting roles, direction, editing, production and script…and
the mix is distressing and challenging. At a running time of a crisp 82
minutes, your time won't be wasted. 4.5 out of 5.</P>
<P>(The film seems to have had a 2nd wind here. Wenham is enjoying the lead
role in a hugely successful TV series "Sea Change", which started on TV
after "The Boys" had been released.  I first saw "The Boys" about 2 months
ago. I saw it again today and there were a lot more people in the audience
this time around.  In " Sea Change" Wenham shows his versatility by playing
 very much an anti-Brett role: the romantic lead - a gentle, kind, good
bloke. Hopefully both will hit your shores soon)</P>
