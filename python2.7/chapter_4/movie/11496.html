<P>U.S. MARSHALS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****) 
Warner Bros. / 2:13 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, violence)
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones; Wesley Snipes; Robert Downey, Jr.; Joe Pantoliano; Kate 
Nelligan; Irene Jacob; Daniel Roebuck; Tom Wood; Latanya Richardson 
Director: Stuart Baird 
Screenplay: John Pogue <HR>Spin-offs are usually relegated to television, but appear to be the only 
alternative when it comes time to make a sequel to a blockbuster movie and one 
of its principal stars doesn't seem to be interested -- and simply cannot be 
replaced. Such is the case with "U.S. Marshals," a chaser to 1993's box office 
behemoth "The Fugitive" that chronicles the further adventures of the titular 
law enforcement team who pursued Harrison Ford's wrongly-accused death row 
escapee. This film doesn't have Harrison Ford. Nor does it have the one-armed 
man, the simple, intelligent storyline or the amazing level of white-knuckle 
tension. If "The Fugitive" set the standard for remaking TV shows for the big 
screen, "Marshals" makes a strong argument for leaving spin-offs to the small 
one. </P>
<P>As the unstoppable, cocksure Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard, Tommy Lee 
Jones reprises the his role from the first movie. This time around, Gerard and 
his team of tagalongs (including Joe Pantoliano and Latanya Richardson) are on 
the trail of a completely different fugitive -- a mysterious ex-Marine Special 
Forces and -CIA operative named Sheridan (Wesley Snipes), on the run after 
somebody frames him for the murders of two Secret Service attaches who were 
trying to crack a Chinese spy ring within the United Nations. Also on Gerard's 
side as he trails Sheridan from the muddy banks of the Ohio River to the chaotic 
streets of New York City is smug, smart Federal Agent John Royce (Robert Downey, 
Jr.). Gerard doesn't completely trust Royce, and possibly for good reason. </P>
<P>Many of "U.S. Marshals"' problems lie within the character of Sheridan -- even 
Snipes' noble demeanor can't hide the fact that he's horribly developed. We 
cared about Harrison Ford's "Fugitive" everyman because we believed in and 
identified with him. Ford had to use instinct, medical know-how and even blind 
luck to uncover the conspiracy against him; he was, quite simply, no action 
hero. Snipes, on the other hand, is -- thanks to his assassin background, he's a 
fighter, a weapons expert and a pro with surveillance equipment. It's just no 
fun rooting for him. That gives a lot of the later action sequences an empty, 
lifeless feel, however well-staged they may be. Compared to "The Fugitive"'s 
richly satisfying four-course dinner, "U.S. Marshals" is half-eaten, day-old, 
microwaved leftovers. </P>
<P>At least Jones' Gerard is still fascinating. His presence deems the film 
watchable even in its many weak passages. Take, for example, the completely 
unnecessary opening sequence that only serves as a way to get cat and mouse 
acquainted down the road. Here, Gerard and company, hidden under various 
disguises, stakeout the home of a wanted criminal who, when caught, will be put 
on the same prisoner transport plane as Sheridan. It's useless stuff that could 
have made the two-and-a-quarter hours "Marshals" tighter by being cut, but Jones 
is a droll delight to watch in any situation. And that prisoner transport plane 
ride, by the way, is the movie's best visceral asset. Director Stuart Baird 
knows a thing or two about in-flight tension -- his 1996 thriller "Executive 
Decision" was an unjustly underrated sweat-popper. </P>
<P>One of the smaller crimes "U.S. Marshals" commits is casting luminous French 
actress Irene Jacob ("Red") in a throwaway role as Sheridan's Starbucks waitress 
girlfriend, but misusing time and talent is something the movie does best. To 
its middling credit, "U.S. Marshals" provides a few decent bangs for the buck, 
an occasionally witty one-liner and a chance for Jones to strut his 
Oscar-winning stuff all over again, but that's about it. A lot of the film is 
spent watching boring people do boring things -- it's too dull to be much fun. 
Don't go expecting another "Fugitive" or you'll find that "U.S. Marshals" is 
decidedly unarresting. <HR>© 1997 Jamie Peck
