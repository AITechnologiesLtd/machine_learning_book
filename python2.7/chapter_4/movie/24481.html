<PRE>          Some ideas are best left undeveloped.</PRE>
<P>  Take, for example, the notion of reviving Edgar Rice
Burroughs' Tarzan in the last days of the 20th century. John and Bo
Derek tried it in 1981, and the result was ``Tarzan the Ape Man,'' one
of the most abominable films of the '80s.</P>
<P>  In 1984, director Hugh Hudson attempted to put a new twist
on the Tarzan legend with his lavish ``Greystoke: The Legend of
Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,'' and came up with an epic as cumbersome and
confused as its title.</P>
<P>  At least those films had artistic pretensions, misguided
though they might have been. The cheap ``Tarzan and the Lost City,''
which comes to us through the courtesy of something called Village
Roadshow Pictures, is pure cheese - and it stinks like Limburger.</P>
<P>  ``Lost City'' offers as Tarzan the chiseled Casper Van Dien,
who proves again as he did in ``Starship Troopers'' he's less a
leading man than a leading mannequin. Any expression beyond a sullen
pout seems to take an extraordinary amount of concentration and
physical exertion on Van Dien's part; his infrequent attempts at
smiles are the stuff nightmares are made of.</P>
<P>  Jane March, best known for proving she's allergic to
clothing of any kind in ``The Lover'' and ``Color of Night,'' plays
Jane as a prissy crab.  Early in the film, Tarzan - shortly before his
scheduled wedding to Jane - has a vision that causes him to
contemplate leaving his new residence in England to make a brief
return to Africa. Jane practically bursts her corset: ``This wedding
will proceed as planned, or not at all!'' she screeches.  ``Go back to
your jungle!''</P>
<P>  Ever the obedient one, Tarzan scurries home, just in time to
find a band of fortune-seekers ransacking the old neighborhood in
search of the key to the lost city of Opar. Since everyone who's ever
looked for Opar has wound up dead, it's conceivable that Tarzan could
have simply waited for the villains to meet their maker. But that
wouldn't have made for a very long movie, so Tarzan attempts to thwart
their quest himself, with the help of a contrite Jane and some of the
phoniest-looking apes since ``Congo.''</P>
<P>  ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' serves up with a straight face
the kinds of scenes ``George of the Jungle'' lampooned, complete with
an egotistical villain (Steve Waddington) who bears an eerie
resemblance to James Cameron, and scores of politically incorrect
natives who jabber lines like ``No animal talk like that! May be
demon!'' and are helpless without Tarzan's protection.</P>
<P>  The photography is washed-out and grimy throughout, and the
visual effects are downright appalling, particularly a giant cobra
that guards the gates of Opar. The fabled ``lost city'' looks like
it's made of carelessly painted plywood and cardboard.</P>
<P>  The only curiosity in ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' stems
from Tarzan's wardrobe choices: He often wears an unbuttoned,
long-sleeved white shirt with his traditional loincloth. Perhaps this
is a conscious choice by the filmmakers to show us the hero's divided
loyalties between civilization and the jungle. Or perhaps Van Dien had
some unsightly acne on his back and needed something to cover it
up. The world may never know.</P>
