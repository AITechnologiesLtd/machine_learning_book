<PRE>NEXT FRIDAY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>Stupidity reigns supreme in Steve Carr's NEXT FRIDAY, starring Ice Cube
and written by Ice Cube and D.J. Pooh.  Filled with repugnant racial and
sexist stereotypes, the film is an instant candidate for the worst film
of the year.</P>
<P>Craig Jones (Ice Cube) is visiting the big new house of his Uncle Elroy
(Don Curry), who left the 'hood for the 'burbs after winning a
million-dollar lottery.  His uncle's next-door neighbors are a
drug-dealing Chicano family.  Most of the characters in the movie appear
to have IQs somewhere in the double digits, and the acting doesn't even
rise to the level of what you might find in a low-rent comedy club.</P>
<P>The plot is well hidden, not that you'll care.  The movie relies on
gross humor with the film's ongoing joke revolving around the stench
from Craig's father, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon).  In the opening
sequence, a tiny dog has a world-class bowel movement.  Mr. Jones falls
backward into the fecal matter but doesn't even change his clothes
afterwards.  Instead, he takes along an aerosol can of air-freshener
that he sprays wherever he goes.</P>
<P>Uncle Elroy has a swimming pool and a spa in his backyard.  The pool has
only a few inches of dirty rainwater in it and some beat-up, old lawn
chairs.  He explains that people in the 'hood can't swim so there was no
point in filling it.  The spa, on the other hand, is full and has a
used, purple condom floating in it.</P>
<P>The women, with one notable exception, Karla (Lisa Rodriguez), are all
referred to as bitches and 'hos (whores) and treated accordingly.  One
man claims that his woman can smell junk sweets from miles away.  The
fatness of various characters' buttocks is a prime topic of conversation
in the story.</P>
<P>Throughout it all, the baby-faced Ice Cube manages to be likable in a
film that never is.  "I can't wait to get back home," his character says
at the end.  And neither could I.</P>
<P>NEXT FRIDAY runs about 1:30.  It is rated R for strong language, drug
use and sexual content.  The film might be considered acceptable for
older teens, but I'd hate to see anybody wasting their time watching
this movie.</P>
