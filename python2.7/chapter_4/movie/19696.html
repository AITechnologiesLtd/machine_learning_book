<P>A common criticism of Stanley Kubrick's work is that he is cold, calculated,
unfeeling and detached. Most of these charges are unwarranted - he is not aloof
but merely observing events as they unfold and doing so with an intellectually
emotional distance while involving the audience. "Eyes Wide Shut," the late
director's last work, is strangely more emotional and less distant than his
last couple of films, and it is a return to the intimacy between people that he
explored so masterfully in "Barry Lyndon." </P>
<P>The film opens with a shot of a woman, Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman), entering
a room and removing her black dress from a distance. The shot is so perfect and
beautiful that it establishes Kubrick's theme immediately - we can observe
sexuality but from a distance. As it turns out, Alice is married to Dr. Bill
Hartford (Tom Cruise) and he will not acknowledge her presence or her looks by
looking at her - his eyes are wide shut. She asks: "How do I look?" He
responds: "You look fine" while adjusting his bow tie. She says: "You are not
even looking." </P>
<P>A moment later, they are leaving their daughter with a babysitter as they go to
a garish, ostentatious Christmas party given by their good friend, Victor
Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). Bill ends up wooing two women at the party and coming
very close to a threesome affair. Alice drinks and dances with a charming
Hungarian playboy who seduces her with talk about "The Art of Love," galleries
and paintings. Both are interrupted or prevent themselves from indulging in
carnivorous sex. Bill is interrupted by Victor's secretary, and Alice excuses
herself and insists that a wedding ring makes all the difference. </P>
<P>Bill and Alice arrive home, and she alarmingly senses that Bill may have slept
with the two voluptuous beauties. Bill says he wouldn't and knows she would
never commit adultery. Alice is angry and confesses that she came close to
walking away from her future family life for a sailor. Bill leaves the house,
confused and upset and engages in an evening of missed sexual opportunities -
all the while he fantasizes Alice's supposed infatuation with a sailor. </P>
<P>"Eyes Wide Shut" may sound like any other sexual mystery potboiler but coming
from Stanley Kubrick, you know it will not be. And it isn't at all, nor should
it be erroneously considered soft-core pornography (similar charges pervaded
Atom Egoyan's "Exotica"). It is about the allure of sex, the possibility of
sexual encounter - in other words, this film is all foreplay and circumstance.
Save for a masked orgy sequence, there are no sex scenes in Kubrick's latest
odyssey. We are briefly shown a sexually charged and erotic scene where Alice
and Bill are kissing and fondling each other while she stares at the mirror
accompanied by Chris Isaak's great song, "Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing." That's
about as close to eroticism as the film gets. </P>
<P>It is indeed an odyssey - it is a journey into Bill's fears and insecurities
about Alice's sexual fantasies. During two days and nights, he finds himself in
one sexual encounter after another. From a sweet prostitute named Domino to the
aforementioned masked orgy to a Lolita-like underage girl in bras and panties
(Leelee Sobieski) to a dead patient's daughter who flirts with him to am
excited hotel desk clerk to a homophobic gang, and so on. Meanwhile, we get
black-and-white images of Alice's romp in the hay.</P>
<P>Based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Traumnovelle," "Eyes Wide Shut" is a fascinating
film because it is so voyeuristic - it could easily have been helmed by a
talented artist like Roman Polanski. In fact, there are correlations between
this film and Polanski's superb "Bitter Moon" - the presentation of sex and its
hidden pleasures to the protagonist as played by Hugh Grant mirror Bill's.
There is also a strong similarity to the over-the-top yet frighteningly real
"L'Enfer" by famed director Claude Chabrol which also dealt with jealousy and
sexual frustration. </P>
<P>>From the opening frame to the last, I was completely mesmerized and involved by
"Eyes Wide Shut." Every shot is beautifully realized, composed and brilliantly
photographed. We see lots of brightly and dimly lit Christmas trees, references
to what lies "where the rainbow ends," sexual mind games and deceit at every
turn of events, nude paintings obscured by characters (echoes of "A Clockwork
Orange"), slightly canted angles to delineate tension and perhaps frustration -
everything in some form or another refers to sex in some way. Kubrick has never
shown sex, and the less we see the more we are compelled by the dreamlike
quality of the film's journey into the heart of darkness - the realization that
jealousy in a marriage is inevitable and perhaps necessary. </P>
<P>"Eyes Wide Shut" also has a wonderful cast. Tom Cruise eschews his trademark
boyish smile (except for the opening scenes) for long stares usually at a low
angle (A Kubrick motif). His slow descent into anger is thrilling to watch, and
one of his most quixotic moments of his career is when he confronts his friend
Ziegler and discovers the true nature behind his own adventurous and nocturnal
activities. </P>
<P>Nicole Kidman has become a first-rate actress, and her mood swings are
something to behold. I also liked her laughing fit at Bill's remarks that he
would not sleep with his patients - when was the last time that a character
laughed at Tom Cruise? Her final moment of realization about their marriage is
stunning - this woman should be nominated for an Oscar. </P>
<P>Also worth mentioning is Sydney Pollack's quietly decadent millionaire
character Ziegler - he is more fierce and yet just as restrained as he was in
"Tootsie" or "Husbands and Wives." Vinessa Shaw displays a sweetness and
sexiness not often seen on the silver screen, and she plays a prostitute! Rade
Serbedzija ("Before the Rain") has one of the sole moments of comic relief as
the owner of the Rainbow, a costume shop, who asks the good doctor for advice
about his balding spot. Todd Field is also engaging as the piano player Nick
Nightingale who plays blindfolded at some musical events. </P>
<P>If I have one or two gripes about Kubrick's long, difficult and splendid film,
it is the abrupt ending and the inclusion of a character that would have been
better omitted or replaced by another actor. The ending is optimistic (a rarity
in any of his films) but somehow feels rushed. Still, this is among the late
master's finest films, preferable to the pretensions of "The Shining" or "Full
Metal Jacket." "Eyes Wide Shut" easily stands among such giants as "A Clockwork
Orange," "Paths of Glory" or "2001." It is a bizarre, strangely moving and
enlightening film guaranteed to provoke as much controversy as any of his other
works. Stanley, you may be gone, but we are glad you came back with one of the
best films of your career. </P>
