<PRE>"When Brendan Met Trudy"</PRE>
<P>Brendan (Peter McDonald) is a Dublin high school teacher that loves music
and movies, but hates teaching. When an extraordinary young woman named
Trudy (Flora Montgomery) enters his life, he soon learns that there is more
to living than Bogart and Brahms in "When Brendan Met Trudy."</P>
<P>The movie begins a la "Sunset Boulevard" with a body lying motionless in
the gutter and a voice over explaining how he, Brendan, could arrive at
such a nadir of life. As the story unfolds and more film references are
mentioned and shown, we begin to understand that our hero is a tormented
individual who is in desperate need of a change. His profession, teaching
history and English at a Dublin high school, is unfulfilling, to say the
least, and he seeks solace in his movies and his passion for song. This
changes when Trudy enters the picture.</P>
<P>Trudy, Brendan learns, is a professional burglar and he, at first, is
energized by the excitement of her crimes. Things are looking up for the
teacher until he makes a big mistake and introduces his new girlfriend to
his family, especially Nuala (Pauline McLynn), the sister from hell.
Brendan succumbs to family pressure and, soon after, he and Trudy are no
longer an item. This is when he ends up in the gutter, shown in the
beginning of the film, pretending to have been hit by a car in a vain cry
for sympathy from Trudy. It takes an act of selfless bravery, later, by
Brendan to impress Trudy and she agrees to take him back - if he helps her
rob Nuala's home. The excitement of the deed drives Brendan to an even
grander criminal plan - steal all of the hated computers from his school.
But, things go awry and Trudy ends up in jail, shielding Brendan from
arrest.</P>
<P> When Trudy is sentenced to two years in prison, Brendan mopes around,
guilt-ridden and lonely over his loss of love. Even the heroes in his
movies, his only comfort in the past, seem to mock him for letting the love
of his life take the rap for him. He musters the courage to visit Trudy in
prison and finds she has forgiven him. He unabashedly breaks out in a song
that is both joy and redemption.</P>
<P>"When Brendan Met Trudy" is a nice idea for a film, but is less than it
could be in the hands of first time feature director Kieron J. Walsh. The
helmer hales from advertising and TV and it shows in the two-dimensional
nature of the story and its protagonists. The tale focuses on Brendan and
his passion for film and music is an integral part of his makeup. Peter
McDonald doesn't take us far below the surface of the feckless Brendan, but
the offbeat love story, music and film references are entertaining.</P>
<P>Flora Montgomery has the harder role as the self-assured, criminally minded
Trudy. Her toughness opposite Brendan's milquetoast character is supposed
to be a turning of the tables with the couple reversing conventional roles
of tough guy, subservient gal. Trudy is too bubbly to come across as a
tough-as-nails thief, but Montgomery does her best to breathe life into her
role.</P>
<P>There is little going on to distract the viewer from the central story.
Wacky and weird family members make up the background, but they, too, fail
to come across as real people, though Brendan's speak-her-mind mom (Marie
Mullen) gets some shock value out of her foul-mouthed judgements.</P>
<P>"When Brendan Met Trudy" tries to be a romantic comedy with the leads
reversing conventional roles. There isn't a firm enough hand behind the
camera to control the bland script by Roddy Doyle. As such, it moves along
OK and has some kitschy film references with snippets of such classics as
"The Quiet Man," "Africa Queen," "The Producers" and more but fails to
satisfy the film buff in me. I give it a C.</P>
