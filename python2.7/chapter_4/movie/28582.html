<PRE>"The Fast and the Furious" - Start Your Engines!
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Guys, here's a movie especially for you.  And if
you're still simmering over the fact that you were
forced to accompany your girlfriend to the endlessly
sad "English Patient" or some other unrelenting
tearjerker, here's a chance for you to exact some
payback.  </P>
<P>"The Fast and the Furious" is a movie that is fueled
with adrenaline and testosterone.  The men brim with
bravado and hubris, the women are beautiful and tough,
the soundtrack blares hard alternative rock music, the
supercharged cars are hot, and the racing sequences
are, well...fast and furious.  It's racing sequences
are so intense that after you leave the theatre,
you'll be tempted to drive 90 MPH out of the parking
lot, fit your engine with nitrous oxide boosters, and
then race against an oncoming locomotive through a
railroad crossing.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around the efforts of agent Brian
(Paul Walker) and the FBI to crack a brazen,
truck-hijacking ring.  These taut hijacking sequences
feature gang members that execute precision driving
techniques to surround and board an 18-wheeler at
highway speeds.  We feel an innate thrill as we watch
these stunts.  </P>
<P>Investigators feel that the mastermind is Dom (Vin
Diesel), an intimidating and streetwise racer who
advises his disciples, "It don't matter whether you
win by an inch or a mile - winning's winning." 
Currently, there isn't sufficient evidence to make any
arrests, and the ringleader could be anyone within the
racing underworld, including Dom's nemesis, Johnny
Tran (Rick Yune) who commands an Asian gang with whom
he competes for turf, respect, and cars. </P>
<P>The police story, however, takes a backseat to a more
interesting facet: the street racing subculture
predicated on speed and brotherhood.  One particular
scene, a wild street race between Dom and three
competitors, ably encapsulates the allure of being
involved with this dangerous activity.  Within this
population of car enthusiasts, having a souped-up
machine commands respect from your peers and the
attraction of girls.  But, as one racer notes, "it's
not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your
car."  </P>
<P>Dozens of cars then converge on to an ad hoc strip of
road somewhere in the outskirts of Los Angeles. Cars
line its sides to prevent non-racers from entering the
course.  We see the racial cliques that root for their
particular driver as they compete for cash and pink
slips.  A follower listens to the police scanner and
barks out status reports.  And when the police finally
come, the multitude of cars scatter like cockroaches
away from light.</P>
<P>While the story holds our attention, it's the racing
sequences that provide the most thrills.  These scenes
are edited seamlessly and allow us to embrace the feel
of incredibly high speeds and the rush from street
racing's inherent dangers.  A botched attempt to
hijack an 18-wheeler and an edge-of-your-seat race
against a freight train were especially riveting.  Sit
down and buckle up.  It's going to be a wild ride.</P>
