<P>   When people are not engaged in some activity that
requires concentration, they talk.  We're social animals, intent
on exchanging information on people, things and ideas, and
usually that's cool, but sometimes not.  We sometimes
forget the perfectly cogent adage that if you have nothing
good to say about someone, don't say anything.  Director
David Guggenheim attempts to validate that expression by
putting Gregory Poirier's story "Gossip" on the big screen, an
engrossing tale adapted into a taut screenplay by Poirier
himself.  </P>
<P>   The story takes place on a college campus that's not like
the place I attended back in the Jurassic Age. Students live
in lavish apartments decorated with drinking areas that would
be the envy of bartenders at the Oak Room of the Plaza
Hotel.  Each co-ed is more beautiful than the next one.  The
guys are budding Brad Pitts and know how to put their
elbows on the bar, and the young dancers could have fit right
in at Studio 54.  Though only one professor's class is on
display, that of a communications instructor (played by
acclaimed monologuist Eric Bogosian), the teacher apparently
knows the names of all of the 150-odd students in his lecture
hall and has the use of video equipment that puts images on
a big screen in front of the group.  Going to a hip school like
this is not enough for some, though.  </P>
<P>   What sorts of people need more stimulation?  Simply
these: The college houses at least three characters who are
vicious enough to spread nasty stories about the campus, so
that if you're the sort who goes to the movies only if you've
got someone to root for, this one is not for you.  "Gossip" is
about as sentimental as Roger Kumble's "Cruel Intentions"
highlighting performers whose physical advantages and
outward charm belie their downright mean-spiritedness.</P>
<P>   We get an idea of the love that one of the students has for
prevarication when Derrick (James Marsden), who is sharing
drinks at a party with his roommates Travis (Norman Reedus)
and Cathy Jones (Lena Headey), tells the bartender that
Travis is the son of a famous rock musician.  Soon after that
Derrick has picked someone up, escorting the inebriated
woman to the bathroom as she is about to throw up. 
Accidentally witnessing the gorgeous, fabulously wealthy but
equally plastered Naomi (Kate Hudson) making out with a
guy named Beau (Joshua Jackson), he spreads the
falsehood that Beau had raped Naomi just after she passed
out.  This gossip leads to disastrous consequences for poor
Beau. </P>
<P>   Director Guggenheim takes us through the ramifications of
the slander, inserting a fair degree of surprising twists to a
story in which unlikely coincidences drive a preposterous plot. 
But never mind that.  We're at the movies and we're skilled at
suspending disbelief.  After all, despite the implausibilities,
this picture has quite a bit going for it including handsome
young actors, a college campus at which high school seniors
would kill to study, at least one flamboyant professor who
fashions a splendid object lesson for his Communications
class, and a whole scenario that the targeted twenty-
something audience can latch onto.  As an actor, Marsden
doesn't have the charisma needed for a guy who sets his
campus on fire.  But Reedus is a natural as the money-
challenged dude dependent on the kindness of his rich friend,
and Headey comes across with enough intensity to juggle her
coexistence and conflicts with two male roommates.  In a
small role, Edward James Olmos is effective as a detective
who never cracks a smile and who could scare even a
classroom of overactive junior high kids enough to be able to
teach them something.  </P>
<P>   A movie like this is like "The Insider."  After you've seen
what Jeffrey Wigand goes through in Michael Mann's 1999
film--the odious lies of the seven tobacco giants out to smear
him and the not-so-hidden message that smoking is bad--
you probably convince yourself to quit your own habit.  What
do you do as soon as you leave the theater?  Right.  You
light up.  Same here.  You watch as the consequences of
malicious gossip taking hold, the knot twisting gradually and
inevitably around the necks of the perpetrators, and you're
sure you will never again spread spiteful rumors.  Until
tomorrow.</P>
