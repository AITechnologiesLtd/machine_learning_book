<P>    Dammit. It's been over two weeks since I saw `American Pie' (and almost a 
month since it was actually released) and I'm just now sitting down to write 
this review. In `filmcriticworld' - to let a review go a fews days later than 
the date the film was released is an eternity. </P>
<P>Anyway, I'd been thinking long and hard about how to review this film and 
it became clear to me after a while that it would be a difficult review to 
write. If you've been following my reviews this summer you'll notice I've 
been experimenting with style and I guess this would be another good test 
case. </P>
<P>So, I dedicate this review to one of my best friends, Matt Perreault, who 
I've known since sixth grade and have been able to talk to and relate to on 
just about any and all subject matters. The problem is the guy is 200 miles 
away in Boston and I haven't seen or talked to him in a while despite 
repeated phone calls and e-mails. Maybe this review - a hypothetical 
conversation Matt and I might have about this film - will get him to 
respond...
CHAD: What's up?
MATT: Nothing. What're you doing?
C: I'm trying to figure out how to write my review of `American Pie.'
M: I didn't see it, is it good? What's it about?
C: Yeah, it's really good. It's got like everything in it. It's like raunchy 
in some parts and sweet in others and throughout the whole thing you get that 
feeling that the dudes that made the movie grew up on the same movies and TV 
shows that we liked. I sensed a strong John Hughes inspiration here because 
they show teenage kids for what they really are and what they really act 
like. They're not just a bunch of sex-crazed maniacs.
M: That's what the commercials and the previews make it look like. They make 
it look like some kind of `Porky's' or something for the ‘90s.
C: Well, actually, there is that kind of sleazy feeling during some parts. 
Some of it looks like they're making the movie purposely for horny teenage 
boys cuz of all the sexual innuedo, but it's like, REALISTIC sexual innuedo. 
The guys in this movie - they're actually realistic teenagers. I mean, 
they're all in their senior year and they make a pact to lose their virginity 
by graduation. That's pretty original right there because I think Hollywood 
assumes all kids lose their viriginity at like age 14 or something. It 
actually acknowledges the fact that, hey, it's pretty fricking hard to get 
sex when you're a kid. But the actual plot is about them trying to keep this 
pact and like encourage the other guy and by the end when it doesn't look 
like they're going to keep the pact they all start to blame each other for 
not keeping the pact.
M: Sounds like that `Seinfeld' where Jerry and George made a pact to get 
married and then George got pissed that Jerry reneged on it.
C: Yeah it's kinda like that. There's some other subtle Seinfeldian things 
going on here, but it's more geared towards teens so it doesn't try to be too 
super highbrow comedy about little things. I mean, it's a sex comedy.
M: Yeah. So what's the plot about?
C: Well it's mostly about this kid Jim (Biggs) who's in this clique that's 
not at the highest social rung on the high school clique ladder, but it's 
pretty high up. Jim's kind of a quiet, sorta goofy guy. He's a lot like one 
of those characters you'd see on a sitcom, especially like something on one 
of those ABC TGIF shows or something... only in an R-rated movie.
M: Okay.
C: Anyway, so Jim has three best friends: Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Klein) and 
Finch (Thomas) who also fit that kind of sitcom-esque, 
sorta-cliche/sorta-real kind of personality. Like Kevin is the sensitive guy 
in a long-term relationship with this hot chick named Vickie (Tara Reid, 
who's a helluva lot different than the chick she played in `The Big 
Lebowski'). He keeps thinking they're gonna do it because they've been going 
out for a few months and it's just like the law of dating ya know? Him and Oz 
make fun of Jim because he's never been to third base and that's where that 
pie joke comes from (and the title of the movie). There's a good joke when 
they tell him that and he says `McDonald's or homemade?'
M: <laughs>
C: And that Finch guy is like this really dorky guy who's just kind of 
friends with these other guys. He's like if Niles Crane (from TV's `Frasier') 
was a kid in the ‘90s. He drinks mocha chino at school and he refuses to use 
the school's bathrooms (oh they exploit that for a Faralley-brothers type gag 
that's really funny even though you're totally grossed out and winching the 
whole time). After they all make the pact he suddenly gets this reputation 
for being like a total stud and that he has like, uh.. ya know... like... a 
big schlong.
M: How does that happen?
C: Well, that's one of the movie's many surprises. It's better to find out 
for yourself.
M: So what happens, is it like they all try to seduce chicks or something?
C: Sort of. I mean, Kevin already has a girlfriend to work on and Oz, who's 
like a total jock and sort of a mimbo, a lot like the character Chris Klien 
played in `Election,' well he decides to fake being really sensitive and he 
joins a singing group to try to start with a clean slate so the girls there 
won't know what he's really like. And then it turns out that he's not just 
faking being sensitive and sweet and stuff, he actually is. There's this 
really good subplot where he meets this cute blonde girl who you think he's 
going to just seduce and use and all that, but they end up being a really 
good couple. They have a few fights but they have some good talks and stuff 
too. That's kind of where you notice the John Hughes-type themes and dialogue 
going on.
M: Yeah whatever happened to John Hughes? He should make more movies like 
`Breakfast Club' and `Ferris Bueller' again. All he does now is like these 
gay Disney kids' movies.
C: Yeah I know. But anyway I'm getting off track. So a lot of the movie is 
about the four guys and their quests to do it. But a lot of stuff happens 
along the way. Like there's a few scenes where Jim's dad keeps coming in and 
talking to him about sex and masturbation and stuff. It's really funny 
because the dad just says it so non-chalently and you can tell it's an 
uncomfortable subject for him. He's like `Jim, I want to talk about 
masturbation... It's like banging a tennis ball against a brick wall - which 
can be fun, but it's not a game. What you want is a partner to return the 
ball. Do you want a partner Jim?'
M: <laughs> I can't imaging having a conversation with my dad like that. Is 
there any cheesy subplots going on, like does someone get knocked up or get 
AIDS or something ?
C: No, but I think they should have delt with those issues. But then again, 
this is a mainstream comedy movie so they're going to get realistic and 
stuff. I mean, that's what the afterschool specials are for. Still, they do 
take it pretty seriously. There's this one conversation Vickie has with her 
friend and she asks if it hurts. I can't remember any movie where a girl even 
remotely hinted at the possibility that sex might not be completely 
pleasurable ya know? I talked to a lot of girls and they say it does hurt the 
first few times. I can't imagine THAT hurting.
M: So is the whole movie about sex?
C: I wouldn't say it like that. It's more like an honest coming-of-age story 
of kids in the ‘90s and what they think about sex. It's more about the hope 
of getting it than the act itself. There's a lot of taboo stuff going on 
during it all too, like this secret book that Kevin's brother tells him about 
which says how to give a girl oral sex where they actually enjoy it. There's 
a funny scene with that in which the chick screams out `I'm coming' and she 
doesn't mean for supper!
M: <laughs> That IS pretty raunchy, but that sounds really funny though.
C: There's a lot of other parts like that, that should be offensive and 
stuff, but they just weren't to me, like a beer cup full of semen and this 
part where this madd hot chick gets naked in Jim's bedroom and... well.. it's 
like almost porn at one point, but it's really funny. I saw it with some 
girls and I was totally surprised they didn't find that disgusting or 
offensive or anything.
M: So, it sounds like you're saying it's like a guy's comedy that girls will 
like too. And you're sure it doesn't get too sappy or corny or anything? I 
mean, it's gotta have some cheesiness if it's going to get girls to like it.
C: Yeah sorta. There's no one specific aspect I'd say is like that, but it's 
there. But it didn't bother me. I laughed a helluva lot and it's just a 
really good and a witty script and it's easy to relate to and everything.
