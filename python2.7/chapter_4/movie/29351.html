<PRE>"Bubble Boy"</PRE>
<P>Jimmy Livingston (Jake Gyllenhaal) was born without immunities and, when he
was released from the hospital at age four, his mom (Swoozie Kurtz)
spirited him home in a protective, antiseptic bubble. Since then she has
been his mommy and muse and has shielded the germ-imperiled boy from the
dangers of the world - especially the "little slut" (mom's words) next
door, Chloe (Marley Shelton). Despite mom's objections Jimmy falls in love
with pretty, sweet Chloe and when she decides to marry another in Niagara
Falls, he creates a portable bubble and hits the road to find her in
"Bubble Boy."</P>
<P>Words that come to mind after watching "Bubble Boy" are politically
incorrect, subversive and anarchistic. Considering that this film springs
from the loins of parent company, Disney, I am amazed that it even got
released. The flick pokes fun at religion, motherhood, cults, freaks,
masturbation, immune systems (AIDS?) and more. But, my amazement is a good
thing, though, when it comes to a comedy that has the gonads to thumb its
nose in the face of convention. Because of this subversion, though, the
movie may suffer at the box office. I hope not.</P>
<P>For all his mother's interference and his plight of being without normal
immunities, Jimmy is a normal, well-adjusted young guy with needs, desires
and interests commensurate with almost any American teenager. He plays rock
music on his guitar and has a very normal interest in the newly moved in
girl next door, Chloe. That he lives in a sterile, habitrail-style
environment and his mom still reads him bedtime stories (although her
fairytales always end with the hero leaving his protective environment and
dying) don't deter him from ordinary emotions. He and Chloe become best
friends, but, without the ability to have physical contact, she soon starts
dating a rock star wannabe, Mark (Dave Sheridan), and, eventually, decides
to marry the sleazy guy - in Niagara Falls, thousands of miles away from
Jimmy's home in Palmdale, CA.</P>
<P>With the impromptu wedding only days away, Jimmy makes the life-threatening
decision to leave his safe, sterile habitat and go find Chloe to declare
his love. Being an intelligent, capable young guy, he builds himself a
portable bubble and hits the road. His adventure begins at a bus stop in
the middle of nowhere run by a less than friendly, deadpan attendant (Zach
Galifianakis). He is given a ride on a bus with the logo "Bright and Shiny"
(read "Up With People") only to be thrown out when he innocently calls his
generic looking companions (all named Todd and Lorraine) a cult. (Super
male model Fabio makes a cameo appearance as their leader.) From there he
meets and helps a surly biker named Slim (Danny Trejo) with a flat tire.
("Patches?" says Slim. "I could use some stinking patches!" in homage to
"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.") Jimmy's adventures continue as he
slowly treks across the land and he teams up with the members of a circus
freak show led by a nasty little guy named Dr. Phreak (Vern Troyer). An
East Indian (Brian George) driving an ice cream and curry van gives B-Boy a
ride and his faith is sorely tested, to gross out effect. Meanwhile, his
overly protective mom and his dad also hit the road in search of their
wayward boy, crossing the same paths as their son.</P>
<P>There has been a lot of flack over the shots that "Bubble Boy" takes at the
various targets and sacred cows of our society. Religion, whether it be
Christianity, the Hindu faith or Judaism, is fired upon frequently and with
verve in the script by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. This alone seems to
offend troves of people. I guess some individuals have a problem with
politically incorrect satire. The use of circus freaks is being construed
as mean spirited, but these misshapen folk are good and caring (and, yes,
funny) characters, much the same way Alfred Hitchcock depicted them in
"Saboteur" (1942). Of course, no one gave Hitch any grief, but the present,
politically correct world we live in takes offense over showing others less
fortunate.</P>
<P>Jake Gyllenhaal ("October Sky") is dead on as the title boy and, with his
dramatic rather than comedic background, anchors the comedy with an earnest
stalwartness that, say, someone like Brendan Fraser may not have conveyed.
Jimmy is resourceful, capable and kind and so in love with Chloe (a
charming performance by pretty Marley Shelton) that he'll risk his very
life just to hold her. It's a sweet perf in a goofy, coming of age road
movie. Swoozie Kurtz is near evil as Jimmy's dominant mom, but the veteran
actress gives her character a caring personality, if only when it comes to
her son. The plethora of character actors filling out the roles of the wild
and wacky people Jimmy meets do yeoman's work and help contribute to the
subversive comedy. You might recognize a face or two with vet Danny Trejo
("Con Air") and Verne Troyer (Mini Me in "Austin Powers 2") doing their
bit.</P>
<P>Commercial director Blair Hayes makes his debut and keeps the pace brisk
but not hurried. Running about 90 minutes, it's the right length, to my
mind, for a screwball comedy and "Bubble Boy" exerts its right to satire
very well. Maybe I'm just thick skinned but I was not the least bit
offended by the offbeat humor, which pushes the envelope of good taste. I
think it walked the line admirably well for a lightweight summer comedy. I
guess it's all a matter of how you look at things. If you're the kind of
person offended by a film like "Bubble Boy" just say no and go see
something else. I, personally, like anarchy and give it a B-.</P>
