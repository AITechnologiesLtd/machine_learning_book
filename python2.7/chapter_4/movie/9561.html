<P>     By the time Dennis Quaid, the ostensible star of SWITCHBACK, makes
his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark, you may find yourself
wondering why he bothered.  After all, writer/director Jeb Stuart has
already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines.  The first
finds Amarillo, Texas sheriff Buck Olmstead (R. Lee Ermey) facing a
hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is
discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction.  As Olmstead begins his
investigation, we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects.
Lane Dixon (Jared Leto) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker; Bob Goodall
(Danny Glover) is the jovial motorist who offers Lane a ride from Texas to
his Utah destination.  All the necessary conflicts seem to be in place --
the internal struggle of Olmstead over the clash between good politics and
good police work, and the external struggle as one of the two travelers
eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist.</P>
<P>     But then Quaid shows up as grimly determined FBI agent Frank
LaCrosse.  LaCrosse is certain that the Amarillo murders are the work of a
serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years.  He's not
supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the Bureau, they've
got their man -- but LaCrosse has a very important reason for believing
otherwise.  Two months earlier, LaCrosse's own son was kidnapped by the
killer, and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere.  LaCrosse knows his
killer's work, and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere
trying to continue their game.</P>
<P>     It wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with SWITCHBACK
to Quaid's presence, but it's a pretty good place to start.  There's a
reason LaCrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its
vital center:  as a dramatic actor, Dennis Quaid possesses exactly one
facial expression and one vocal intonation.  We can tell LaCrosse is
determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed, sourpuss pucker;
we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an Eastwood-esque
rasp.  A more flexible performer might have given weight to the character,
pulling the audience into his haunted intensity, making SWITCHBACK _his_
film.  Quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated.  It's tough to
become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like
all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes.</P>
<P>     Even without Quaid, it doesn't appear that SWITCHBACK would have
stayed on course.  The early scenes between Leto and Glover have a lively
energy, building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his
gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat.  Unfortunately, Stuart tips
his hand far too early in the game, both through the pitch of the
individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal.  Once the
mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched, the interaction between
Leto and Glover becomes stale and predictable.</P>
<P>     In fact, "stale and predictable" describes the direction that
SWITCHBACK takes in general, falling back on far-too-common Hollywood
devices like cats jumping out of nowhere, a climactic fistfight on board a
freight train, and edgy law enforcement agents.  It's too bad Stuart
wasn't willing to spend more time with Sheriff Olmstead, far and away the
most interesting and appealing character in the film.  Played with
atypical restraint by R. Lee Ermey, he's a wonderful, unconventional hero
who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on
his convictions.  A film focusing on the Olmstead would have signaled a
film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling.
Instead, Stuart places his trust in a "name" star who can't carry the
material.  Maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in
the script, the one where the grimly determined FBI agent wanders onto the
scene to muck up a perfectly good story.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 trains in vain:  4.</PRE>
