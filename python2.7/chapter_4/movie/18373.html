<P>PLOT:
Based on the wildly popular "Jerry Springer" TV show, this movie follows the
lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on
the infamous program. One posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be
featured in the "I slept with my stepfather" segment, and the other is based
on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted "dog"
boyfriend.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The truth is that if I didn't have a day job, I would probably watch the
real "Jerry Springer" show every day. I find it quite entertaining, despite
its complete lack of redeeming value. Having said that, the show itself is
outrageous, funny, and always filled with goofy surprises, as opposed to
this film which features no laughs (is this a comedy or a drama?),
uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes, and a
contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way. I never thought I would
utter the word boring in the same sentence as Jerry Springer, but this film
is an absolute yawn-fest, despite offering various scenes featuring
simulated blowjobs, lesbians, T&A and TV violence (who would've guessed
that?).</P>
<P>I wish they would have either A) made this movie much, much funnier, or B)
turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why
people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of
embarrassment. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though screenwriter Jon
Bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real "Jerry Springer"
reruns to complete his script, leaving us with a boring film, featuring no
laughs, one-dimensional characters, and no fun whatsoever.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Jerry Springer used to be the Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. For this film, he
won the 1999 Razzie Award for Worst New Star, tied with Joe Esterhas from AN
ALAN SMITHEE FILM: BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN.</P>
