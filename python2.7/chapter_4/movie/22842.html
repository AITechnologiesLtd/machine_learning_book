<P>Errol Morris' work is unmistakable.  The celebrated documentary
filmmaker blends familiar music, extreme close-ups and slow-motion shots
that fluctuate between polished color and rich black-and-white as Morris
focuses his lens on slightly deranged yet exceptionally passionate
subjects.  In Mr. Death, Morris (Fast, Cheap and Out of Control) selects
a Massachusetts engineer to plunk down in front of his camera.</P>
<P>Of course Fred Leuchter, Jr. isn't your average engineer from New
England.  He's an expert in the construction of execution equipment.
Leuchter is all for the death penalty, but is sickened by torturous
executions caused by antiquated equipment that could potentially result
in unnecessary grief for both the prisoner and any witnesses present at
the execution.  He's helped build a better electric chair for the
Tennessee State Prison, created a lethal injection system for New
Jersey, and designed a new helmet for the North Carolina electric chair
(the previous model was still younger than Jesse Helms).</P>
<P>It's easy to get wrapped up in Leuchter's enthusiasm for his
profession.  He takes his work very seriously, a fact that becomes
evident as he describes the delicately emotional relationship between
prison guards and death-row inmates.  And it only takes Leuchter about
sixty seconds to sum up this connection, compared to the three-plus-hour
message delivered by the unwieldy film The Green Mile.  It's this kind
of efficiency that drove the chain-smoking caffeine addict to the top of
his game.</P>
<P>But a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes can also warp your
sensibility, as exhibited when Mr. Death switches focus from Leuchter's
work background to a criminal trial in Toronto during the late ‘80s.
Revisionist Historian Ernst Zundel, accused of publishing false
statements (a crime in Canada) concerning the denial of the Holocaust,
contracted Leuchter to examine forensic evidence from the eastern
European concentration camps and gas chambers to prove his innocence.
Despite the fact that Zundel was a well-known neo-Nazi and the publisher
of a book called "The Hitler We Loved and Why,' Leuchter eagerly jumps
at the opportunity to step into the limelight, figuring that the trial
could be the crowning achievement of his career.  What he doesn't expect
is vocational execution, hence the lengthy title of the film.</P>
<P>Morris is in top form here, once again taking subject matter that I
would equate with watching paint peel and turning it into an
almost-riveting ninety-minute film.  His ability to lay out the story of
his subject is second-to-none and – thanks to cinematographer Robert
Richardson (Snow Falling on Cedars) – also beautifully photographed.
Morris effectively splits the film in halves, with the first
establishing Leuchter as a harmless nerd and the second showing that
evil can illuminate from the most unexpected sources.</P>
<P>1:30 – PG-13 for mild adult language and a scene depicting the execution
of an elephant</P>
