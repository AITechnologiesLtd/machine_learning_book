<PRE>                                    YOU SO CRAZY
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<P>     Martin Lawrence wants to be heard.  But the comedian's
black-and-blue banter only goes so far in this concert film from the
star of TV's "Martin."</P>
<P>     When he's raging on such social ills as racism, Lawrence lacks the
fire to be believable.  Remember how angry Richard Pryor used to get on
this stuff?  Martin's methods are also less impressive--the comedian
follows up pleas for racial harmony with racial jokes.  Does he think
he's making racial-joke jokes?</P>
<P>     But when Martin gets blue, he beats his betters hands down.  YOU
SO CRAZY is unrated for a reason and, as his status as persona non
grata on "Saturday Night Live" can attest, Lawrence's off-color comedy
could drain anyone's color.  The finale, which includes topics that
will go unmentioned here, is a tour de force of tastelessness that
should be delved with discretion.</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  Is he funny?  Some of the time.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
