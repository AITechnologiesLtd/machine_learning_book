<PRE>                        THE GINGERBREAD MAN 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             3 :-( :-( :-( for Grisham's worst told tale yet</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidtz, Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah,
Robert Duvall, Tom Berenger, Famke Janssen, Jesse James, Mae Whitman
Director: Robert Altman
Producer: Jeremy Tannenbaum
Screenplay: "Al Hayes" (Robert Altman) based on an original story by
John Grisham</P>
<P>The first thing that struck me about this movie, was how amateurish it
felt. Maybe, this was the intent of the usually brilliant Robert Altman,
who I am surprised decided to cash in on this potentially commercial,
John Grisham product. Well, why not, if Ford Coppola saw fit to direct
THE RAINMAKER?</P>
<P>This isn't your standard Grisham courtroom drama. Gone are the usual
features of the incredibly corrupt industrial forces vs. the severely
disadvantaged individual, with a lawyer carrying a conscience thrown
somewhere in between. Also gone, are some strong Grisham's tendencies to
highlight moralistic issues.</P>
<P>Sadly so, because this movie has ended up becoming melodramatic trash,
more in consistency with Sidney Sheldon or Jackie Collins, but lacking
the bitchy edge. What we have is a sleazy lawyer (Kenneth Branagh), who
ends up in bed with a mysterious waitress (Embeth Davidzt), living in
fear of her lunatic father (Robert Duvall). The movie hits an all time
low, when a mostly grumpy, whiney Branagh loses all self control when
his kids get kidnap. I guess there is a moral here, somewhere, if you
sleep around expect to get more than just you're fair share of STD's.</P>
<P>As already mentioned, Branagh is painful to watch when not reciting
Shakespeare. Daryl Hannah acts as an assistant lawyer, but it takes more
than her pair of glasses to make her role intelligent. Robert Downey Jr,
is once again stoned, etc. Duvall is genuinely crazed, whilst Davidzt
mopes, and Tom Berenger has very little screen time.</P>
<P>A most disappointing tale, with little relevance to the children's story
on which it is based, except for the fact that Davidzt got nightmares
when Duval told her the story when she was a kid.</P>
