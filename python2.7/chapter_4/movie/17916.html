<PRE>_SLC_Punk!_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Structurally speaking, James Merendino's portrait of Stevo (Matthew
Lillard) and Bob (Michael Goorjian), two young punk rockers in 1985 Salt
Lake City, is a complete mess.  Blue-haired Stevo is the narrator; he often
directly addressing the camera and is prone to abandoning points and plots
in midstream in favor of random tangents that almost always never return to
their point of origin.  The chaotic result is unquestionably hard to follow
at times, but that seems to be the point; though this hyperactive
storytelling style, Merendino captures the anarchic spirit that is, as
Stevo eloquently explains at length at various points, the essence of the
punk movement.</P>
<P>Still, with so much--or, depending on how one looks at it, so
_little_--going on, _SLC_Punk!_ would be all sound and fury without a
strong center, and the film does have one in Lillard.  It would have been
easy for him to coast by on pure attitude and ebullience, but Lillard
invests the role of Stevo with genuine humanity, which is essential for the
climactic moment where he inevitably comes of age.  Lillard is supported
well by the able troupe playing the many secondary characters that pass
through the film.  Particularly memorable is Til Schweiger as a
quick-tempered drug dealer; on the other hand, notably underused as Stevo
and Bob's ladies' man buddy Eddie is Adam Pascal, in whose footsteps I will
someday follow as Roger Davis in the musical _Rent_.</P>
