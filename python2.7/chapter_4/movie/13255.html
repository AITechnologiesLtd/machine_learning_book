<PRE>                          DOCTOR DOLITTLE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                      1 :-) for the talking animals</PRE>
<P>Directed by Betty Thomas.
Cast Eddie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff, Kristen
Wilson, Jeffrey Tambor
Written by Hugh Lofting, Nat Mauldin, Larry Levin</P>
<P>There's probably one thing that annoys me more than a rude, verbose,
hyperactive Eddie Murphy, and that would be – smart-mouthed, lip
malleable, talking animals. So, I had every reason to dislike this movie
from the outset, but instead I decided to sit back and re-evaluate my
life. After momentarily journeying to the depths of my soul and
relieving myself of the hate I bore for the ones named Murphy and
talking animals, I decided to enjoy the holiday spirit of the movie.</P>
<P>This movie is great for the kids. They love animals and they love
animals that talk, even more. Eddie is well behaved, and if I had to
choose between watching him as a smart mouthed BEVERLY HILLS COP, or as
a disillusioned MD who can talk to animals – MD wins hands down. The
animals are o.k. Yes they generate great one liners, with style and
human expression thanks to Jim Henson and co.</P>
<P>In the opening credits of the movie, it is stated that the movie is
based on Hugh Lofting's children's books of the same name. To clarify
this further, I will say that they are only very, very, very loosely
based on the novels. In fact the only thing vaguely resembling Lofting's
characters is the name Dolittle and of course the talking animals.</P>
<P>The plot is simple. Dolittle (Murphy) has the gift of talking to
animals. A gift that he has repressed since childhood, and only recently
been awoken since hitting a stray dog with his car. After this, the
Doctor mostly psychologically counsels animals about their bowel habits,
sex life and numerous psychiatric disorders. By keeping the plot simple,
and the focus on the talking animals and away from Eddie Murphy, the
children will remain delighted and 20th Century Fox has another
potential box office hit on their hands.</P>
