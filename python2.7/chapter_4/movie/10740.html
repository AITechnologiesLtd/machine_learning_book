<P>        I had trouble watching LONE STAR (1996), but it was through no
fault of the movie.  Rather, I discovered that I've been conditioned by
Hollywood to expect a more-or-less direct line between the introduction of
the conflict and the resolution of that conflict.</P>
<P>        But LONE STAR doesn't take a direct line from beginning to end.  It
meanders.  John Sayles doesn't want to just tell you the story of a
skeleton dug up in the desert; he wants to give you a slice of life of the
town in which the story takes place.  And he does so masterfully.</P>
<P>        The primary plot involves Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper) trying
to unravel the mystery of a skeleton found buried in the desert near
Frontera, Texas.  The skeleton is that of Charlie Wade (Kris
Kristofferson), a brutal and corrupt Sheriff of the same county who
disappeared over 30 years ago.  The disappearance happened the same night
Wade was threatened by a new deputy, Buddy Deeds (Matthew MacConaughey),
who refused to partake of the Sheriff's corrupt activities.  Buddy then
went on to become a wildly popular Sheriff in his own right, and Sam lives
under the long shadow cast by his father.</P>
<P>        Intermingled with the main story arc are several subplots.  A young
Mexican worker attempts to get his relatives illegally across the border; a
by-the-book Colonel of a nearby Army base attempts to come to grips with
the fact that his estranged father lives in Frontera; a shooting at a
nearby bar leads the Colonel to increase the frequency of random drug
tests, which may put a young private at risk.  These stories and more are
weaved skillfully into the fabric of the movie, and many are never
resolved.  In the hands of a lesser writer/director, these segments would
be distracting.  Sayles, however, manages to give them purpose despite
their irrelevancy to the central plot, and we find ourselves engrossed in
the lives of this small Texas border town.</P>
<P>        Solid acting is seen throughout the movie.  Kristofferson exudes
malignancy as the corrupt Wade.  Frances McDormand makes a brief but
wonderful appearance as Sam Deeds' "tightly-wound," football-crazed
ex-wife.  And Cooper is perfectly understated as the
not-quite-sure-of-himself Sheriff, trying to escape his father's legendary
status.</P>
<P>        To be fair, there are some flaws in the movie.  For instance, as
the payoff was building to its climax, I found myself thinking "If Buddy
Deeds *did* kill Charlie Wade, I'm going to be disappointed because it was
so obviously him.  And if he didn't, I'm going to be disappointed because
it's so obviously him that it *couldn't* be him."  A more subtle approach
could have heightened the mystery (and thus the enjoyment of the movie)
that much more.</P>
<P>        Also, the cutaways between the present and the past are done
seamlessly.  Instead of a fade, or other traditional flashback sequences,
the camera simply pans across the scene.  When the pan starts, the action
is in one time frame, and when it ends, the action is in another.  While
this was a novelty at first, I confess to being distracted by it later in
the movie.</P>
<P>        Finally, throughout the movie, Sam Deeds' desire to prove that his
father was a murderer seems completely out of proportion to any indications
of Buddy Deeds' personality.  Buddy Deeds seems to be a genuinely honest
and caring man, well deserving of his reputation.  Aside from the
resentment at having a legend for a father, we're given no motivation for
Sam's exceptionally hostile attitude towards Buddy, and I found myself
increasingly confused by this hostility as the movie progressed.</P>
<P>        But these are ultimately minor points.  The movie is well worth
watching, and I highly recommend it.  Especially to those folks like myself
who need to wean ourselves away from more conventional Hollywood fare.</P>
