<P>Director Luc Besson decided to give the lead role of Joan of Arc to a lesser
known actress named Milla Jovovich, a woman probably best known for her part
in Besson's own ode to science-fiction called THE FIFTH ELEMENT. A balsy
move on his part, especially when you consider the big budget of this movie,
but one which we could all respect, considering the director's obvious
support for unproven talent. Oops, did I say "obvious support for unproven
talent"...I meant, obvious support for his wife! They were a married couple
during the filming of this movie, but separated soon thereafter. Oh
well...on to the review.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Young, religious, carefree French girl turns into a confident, focused young
adult who feels the hand of God leading her into battle with the English in
the early 1400s. After confronting the soon-to-be King of France with her
visions from above, he allows her to fight his war and reap the rewards
thereof. Soon thereafter, Joan is left to waddle with the voices inside her
head whose divinity suddenly come into question.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Stylish, overlong, uneven, ambitious battle drama features some excellent
fight sequences, good performances by all involved (except Dustin Hoffman as
Dustin Hoffman in a robe) and a lagging third act which essentially turns
the story of a heroine fighting the battle of the good, into a psychological
drama about whether or not Joan was just cooky! This film starts off slow
with Besson spending too much time on Joan's revelations, while drowning us
with his usual panache for the stylish shots. Unlike others, I personally
didn't mind the modernization of this tale and actually started enjoying
myself once Joan led her willing army into battle. I was however torn
between how I should feel about Joan as Besson presents her to us as a
strong-minded, confident, fighter woman while allowing his lead actress to
portray her as a constantly teary-eyed, confused, schitzo with a supposed
plan. I wanted to feel for her, but eventually, I just lost any compassion
for her within all the confusion of her character.</P>
<P>Mrs. JoBlo disagreed with me and wholeheartedly enjoyed this film. She
thought the character of Joan was shown in all her strengths and weaknesses,
lending a stronger credibility to her persona. I did not see that. I wished
that Besson would have stuck to one story line in this picture, instead of
forcing us to withstand his own interpretation of what might've happened, in
that, Joan might just have been a psychologically disturbed woman with a
penchant for the grandiose. The film basically just ran too long for me with
the last act dragging the whole show to a standstill. Were they just voices
in her head? Will they allow her to confess her sins? Whatever. Seemed like
another movie altogether. I think I'm being harder on this picture because I
truly was enjoying its middle half with a female heroine strong enough in
her will to kick any Hollywood bullcrap action star in the balls and walk
away with her head up high. Jovovich also played her part very well,
considering the struggles within herself that Besson's script needed her to
portray. I personally would rather not have seen so much of her schitzo
side, which I believed to take away from the film's momentum, and would have
cut about thirty minutes from its length, but all in all, some cool battle
scenes, a hip but confusing lead character, great direction and just too
much esoteric psycho-babbling.</P>
<P>Some may like it for its battles and dislike its conscience-grinding
moments, others may like its head games and dislike its fight scenes. If
you're lucky, you'll like them both, but if you're not lucky, well...this
movie just ain't for you.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Luc Besson's formative years were spent following his parents,
scuba diving instructors, around the world. His early life was entirely
aquatic, which explains his 1988 film LE GRAND BLEU, dedicated to the deep
blue sea. Word on the street is that he wrote the draft scripts for that
film and THE FIFTH ELEMENT during his days in high school. Ironically, he
planned on becoming a marine biologist specializing in dolphins until a
diving accident at the age of seventeen rendered him unable to dive any
longer. He then got into film, and the rest as they say, is history.
Milla Jovovich's middle name is Natasha. She was born in Kiev, Ukraine and
started modeling when she was only nine years old. She is also a singer and
was married and divorced at the age of eighteen to actor Shawn Andrews, her
co-star in 1993's DAZED AND CONFUSED.
Actress Faye Dunaway was married to Peter Wolf, member of the J. Geils Band,
from 1975 to 1979.
Co-screenwriter Andrew Birkin also plays a role in this film as Talbot.</P>
