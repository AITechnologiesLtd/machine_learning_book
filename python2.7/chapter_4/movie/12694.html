<PRE>Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"Moderation In All Things" is the unofficial motto of the United States. From
our Puritan founding to the doorway of the 21st century, virtue is to be found
through clear thinking and clean living. Extravagance is not only imprudent,
it's a sin.</P>
<P>There's a different opinion held by some seekers for truth. They believe that
to truly see, you must escape the consensus reality overlay imposed by
society. They point to the theory that reaching altered states of
consciousness is a need hard-wired in the human biology. One of the first
inventions of the early nomadic tribes was the discovery that drinking
fermented honey resulted in a different reality. Around the same time, they
found that ingesting certain plants revealed a new point of view. Children
achieve the change by twirling rapidly in circles. Even animals indulge in
alcoholic rotten fruit.</P>
<P>Mankind has a long history of shamanistic oracles leading their people
through insights gained from drug-induced journeys. Poets, artists and others
given to intemperance live on the fringes on society, often shunned by the
mainstream, but just as often looked to as a source of insight. Frequently
these people are demented, occasionally enlightened and sometimes both.</P>
<P>"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom," writes William Blake.
Journalistic shaman Hunter S. Thompson puts it another way: "When the going
gets weird, the weird turn pro." It doesn't get any weirder than Las Vegas in
the early seventies.</P>
<P>The film is based on his 1971 classic novel of gonzo journalism. Supposedly
reporting on an off-road race, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr.
Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) -- thinly disguised Thompson and associate Oscar
"Zeta" Acosta, a noted Chicano lawyer -- are actually in search of the
American dream. Loading the trunk of their rented Caddy convertible with every
known (and some unknown) drug, they head through the desert for the city of dreams.</P>
<P>Discussing the plot of this movie is pointless. In fact the plot itself is
pointless. Thompson's style of writing was to ingest as many mind-altering
substances as possible and write about his experiences. That many of those
experiences existed only in his head makes it impossible to tell what really
happened. And it doesn't matter. This is one man's extremely unique point of
view. If you're looking for a coherent storyline, this isn't it.</P>
<P>As Duke and Gonzo stumble through Las Vegas, their vision is wild and
incoherent. Lounge lizards morph into real reptiles. The carpet melts and
flows up the wall. The noted attorney sits fully clothed in a bathtub filled
with water, grapefruit rinds and assorted garbage and waving a 10-inch hunting
knife at his friend who is defending himself with a shower curtain.</P>
<P>The film is certainly not for everyone. It's bound for many Worst Of 98 lists
and just as likely to turn up on Bests inventories. For the first several
minutes, I thought it was remarkably insipid, but then either the film or I
changed and it became a ride through the absurd. For the first time in a long
while, I found myself laughing out loud in a movie theater. But my companion
hated the film.</P>
<P>This may be the most authentic depiction of the hallucinogenic drug
experience ever captured on film...or so I've been told. Several of the scenes
are accurate and hilarious at the same time. When Gonzo is trapped on a
revolving bar moving about one mile per hour and afraid to step off, some of
the audience was rolling in laughter while others were walking out.</P>
<P>There is a poignant moment when Thompson gazes west out of his hotel window
and talks about the hopes of the hippies who were sure that they could
transform America into a land of peace and freedom. He explains that if you
look hard enough you can see the high water mark where the wave crested and
rolled back. If there is a time of lucid truth in the film, this is it.</P>
<P>It's always a delight when one of Hollywood's pretty boys transforms into a
talented actor. Depp is marvelous as Thompson, reeling and darting from wall
to wall attempting to escape killer bats. Although he is smaller than the real
journalist and comes across as considerably less dangerous than the hulking
gun-toting out of control writer, his depiction works.</P>
<P>The other actors are equally up to task. Peppered with cameos by the real
Thompson, Ellen Barkin (in a disturbing diner scene), Penn Jillette and many
others, the film is a "spot the actor" game. A few episodes don't work. Gary
Busey as the cop who pulls Duke over is unimpressive and the scene (one of the
few not from the book) turns into a waste of time. The two-hour length could
do with a bit of trimming.</P>
<P>The weakest link among the actors is Del Toro. As frantic and irrational as
he is, my memory of the book's Dr. Gonzo is as even more menacing and over the
top. He's not bad, just not as on-target as possible.</P>
<P>Thompson is the anti-Nancy Reagan: his attitude towards drugs is obviously
"Just say yes". It's amazing that this film got made in today's social climate
and may die a rapid death at the boxoffice.</P>
<P>When we look back at our historic forefathers, it's tempting to remember them
as questing for freedom and forget that they were mostly criminals and
outcasts. While I'm not sure I would want Hunter Thompson as a neighbor, he
has something to say. If only we could figure out what it is.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more
disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both "Fear And Loathing" and
"Godzilla" in the same evening.)</P>
