<PRE>                              HOUSEHOLD SAINTS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This tale of Magical Realism in post-
     WWII Little Italy tells the story of how a modern saint came
     to be born and how she lived.  That plot could have been
     saccharine but tales of neighborhood life and different
     people's reactions to Teresa actually make this film a very
     watchable fantasy.  Rating:  +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     If a miracle happened today, would we believe it?  Would we explain it
away?  How would people react?  That is the theme of Nancy Savoca's
HOUSEHOLD SAINTS.  The story is about two generations of a family and takes
place over twenty-one years or so.  To aid in the suspension of disbelief
the story is told in flashback as a neighborhood legend by an old Italian
couple.  The inner story starts around 1949, taking place in New York's
Little Italy.  Joseph Santangelo (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) wins
Catherine Falconetti (Tracey Ullman) in a game of pinochle.  But winning
turns out to be one thing and collecting something else.  It seems unlikely
that these people would be married this way, but it seems the hand of some
sort of fate is pushing them onward.  The story dwells on their problems of
home life: Joseph's superstitious mother (Judith Malina) hates her
daughter-in-law; Catherine's brother is bewitched and obsessed by Puccini's
MADAME BUTTERFLY and devotes his life to getting a wife who Japanese or
Chinese--a distinction of which he in unaware.  Yet all of this seems
directed toward getting Teresa Santangelo born or forming her saintly
character.  As a young girl (Rachael Bella; older she is played by homely
but angelic Lili Taylor) she sees John Brahm's THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF
FATIMA and decides to devote her life to being like the saint in that film.
The film then follows the first eighteen years of the life of the woman who
may or may not be a saint.</P>
<P>     This is a slow and atmospheric film that takes a long time to develop
its story, but getting to the main story is as interesting as being there.
There are details of life in Little Italy told with a sort of magical
realism.  In humorous contrast to films that focus in on the details of
sumptuous meals, here we see the meal that an inexperienced Catherine makes
under protest.  In spite of the best intentions inexperience dominates and
for once an Italian meal on screen looks less than totally appetizing.</P>
<P>     Perhaps central to the story is the examination of three kinds of faith
represented by three generations of Santangelo women.  For Teresa's
grandmother faith seems entwined with the dark superstitions of the old
country.  Catherine found faith later in life, frightened into it by her
mother-in-law, and her faith is thin.  Teresa's faith is innocent and pure
and it is spurred by mystical visions perhaps from neurosis induced by her
upbringing, or perhaps they are genuine miraculous events.  And each woman
responds to life differently--each somewhat strangely--based on her own
brand of faith.</P>
<P>     While I am personally skeptical about the existence of true saints, I
found that if I went with the flow and thought of this as a fantasy film,
there was more than enough to keep me interested here both in an exploration
into a religious viewpoint and as a window onto the community in Little
Italy.  My rating would be a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
