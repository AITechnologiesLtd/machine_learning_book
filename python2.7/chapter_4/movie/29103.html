<P>_Jurassic_Park_III_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        For an installment of one of the most lucrative screen franchises in
history, _Jurassic_Park_III_ arrives on screens with a curious lack of hype, at
least compared to some other so-called "blockbusters" this summer.  Sure,
_Jurassic_Park_ and _The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park_ director Steven Spielberg
now only gets an executive producer credit this time around, and the
less-marquee-friendly Joe Johnston handles the helming chores here.  The bottom
line, however, is that the film is another go-round of a formula that has proven
wildly successful more than once: humans + island + dinosaurs.  Could it be that
Universal knows something that we don't, anticipating that moviegoers have tired
of prehistoric predators?  Whether or not that may be true before _JPIII_'s
release, it could very well be the case after audiences see this  installment,
easily the least satisfying of the series.</P>
<P>        Before it goes terribly wrong, however, _Jurassic_Park_III_ actually
gets a number of things right.  The reintroduction to Sam Neill's Dr. Alan
Grant, who was absent in _The_Lost_World_, is handled quite briskly by Johnston
and the writing crew (the three scribes receiving screen credit are Peter
Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor--the latter two best known for their
Oscar-nominated _Election_ work), as is the basic plot thread stringing together
the dino scenes.  Ex-spouses Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Téa
Leoni) convince Dr. Grant  to accompany them on a flight over dino-populated
Isla Sorna.  Of course, such a foolish trip goes awry when a plane crash leaves
them stranded and alone to fend for themselves against the usual suspects--the
velociraptor, the mighty T-rex--and some newcomers to the _Jurassic_ mythos:
notably, the winged, meat-eating pteranodon and the more-ferocious-than-T-rex
spinosaurus.</P>
<P>        To Johnston's credit, _JPIII_ moves at a snappier pace than the previous
two films; the streamlined plot allows for a steady stream of dino set pieces
with minimal interruption.  Unfortunately, the attempts to build character and
drama during the non-action interludes are predictable and uninvolving.  Paul
and Amanda grow closer while searching for their son Eric (Trevor Morgan), who
is lost on the island; a key "twist" involving Grant's younger associate Billy
Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) can be seen coming a mile away.  Certainly not
helping the credibility of the drama is the truly wretched performance of Leoni,
who accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of out-overacting the first
film's Laura Dern (who makes a return cameo).  The big dramatic showcase for
Leoni is a bring-down-the-house moment in the worst way; it goes down as one of
the comic highlights (or lowlights, depending on how you look at it) of the
cinema year.</P>
<P>        Thank goodness a dinosaur pops in at frequent enough intervals to get
Leoni and everyone else to shut up and simply start running for their lives. 
Johnston stages a couple of standout action sequences, particularly the first
spinosaurus scene, involving the wrecked fuselage of the plane; and a set piece
involving a nest of hungry pteranodons.  Effective action sequences such as
these appear to build the film toward a grand finish--one that never comes.  Say
what one will about _The_Lost_World_  and its rather controversial third act
twist, one cannot say that the film didn't build up to a big payoff.  The same
cannot be said of _JPIII_, which reportedly began filming without an ending in
place--and does that fact ever show.  Not only is the wrap-up an anticlimax of
mammoth proportions, it then devolves into overdone and downright ridiculous
hokum.</P>
<P>        _Jurassic_Park_III_ is a reasonable enough thrill ride for a good
portion of its shockingly lean 90-minute run time (as opposed to the
two-hour-plus sizes of the Spielberg installments), but like any thrill ride,
it's ultimately only as good as the feeling it leaves the audience--and the
rather startling way in which the film deflates is enough to ensure that for
most viewers, this third trip will be the least charming.</P>
