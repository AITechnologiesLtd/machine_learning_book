<PRE>U-571 </PRE>
<P>The story tells of the United States' efforts to crack Nazi U-boats' 
communication codes during World War
II. To do so they must get an encoding device off a Nazi submarine without 
the rest of the German army
knowing they've done so. </P>
<P>Matthew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andy Tyler, a sub-under-assistant Naval 
officer who thinks he could be
a leader and gets his wish when his crew's mission to get the encoder is 
botched and all hell breaks loose. </P>
<P>The film presents an interesting and original plot when Tyler and his crew 
are stuck in a German sub and
must fight off another German sub and a destroyer ship while their own boat 
is falling apart. </P>
<P>The action sequences are interesting at first but wear out quickly after the 
same scenarios keep repeating
and the individual conflicts and problems within the sub become so 
predictable and just plain fake. A good
premise hurt by poor direction. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
