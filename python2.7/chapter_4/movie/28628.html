<PRE>"Cats & Dogs" – They're Smarter Than We Think
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Thinking about dogs, this image comes to mind.  Our
stately friend plays with your child in the backyard,
happy to chase balls and sticks.  He sits on a
windowsill to bark at strangers and mailmen.  He roams
the neighborhood and marks his territory.  However, in
the cleverly presented family film, "Cats & Dogs," we
learn that these animals are not just family pets that
run happily through idyllic, suburban yards.  Most of
their actions revolve around reconnaissance.  And what
are they on the lookout for?  The answer is cats, who
grow continually resentful that dogs are man's best
friend and not them.</P>
<P>It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and only the
strongest species can claim their spot next to humans.
 Cats and dogs have been locked in a never-ending
struggle since time immemorial.  So intense are their
military tactics that dogs work from a secret base at
the center of the earth with technology that rivals
the headquarters of any James Bond film and, perhaps,
even the Pentagon.  Cats are equally well-equipped. 
In some of the wackier sequences, ninja cats come
prowling along with night vision goggles while another
evil feline spy coughs up hairballs that hide grenades
and other devices.</P>
<P>The current battlefield involves the Brody house.  The
father (Jeff Goldblum) is an eccentric scientist who
is on the verge of a major breakthrough.  If
successful, he could eradicate allergic reaction to
dogs.  This is very threatening for cats who visualize
more dog lovers in the world as a result.  The evil
cat, Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes), has a
nefarious plan of his own.  Steal the formula, alter
its composition, and then use it to make humans
deathly allergic to dogs.  </P>
<P>Assigned to guard the Brody home is Lou (voiced by
Tobey Maguire), a cute beagle puppy guaranteed to
elicit several 'awws' from the audience.  Lou actually
winds up there as a result of a mix-up.  Yet despite
his inexperience, Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), a
regal shepherd dog and weathered secret agent, quickly
brings him up to speed.  For much of the film, these
two and other various dog agents fend off increasingly
ambitious encroachments by the cats.</P>
<P>Also of note are the special effects.  The animals
bear expressions that are incredibly human and the
lips move in perfect unison to the words being spoken.
 To bring this film to life, state-of-the-art
techniques combine real animals with puppets and
computer-generated effects.  The realism is
impressive.</P>
<P>You may see these common house pets and think that
spying dogs and scheming cats are absurd.  But if you
think about it, dogs would make great agents.  With
their acute hearing, heightened senses, speed, and
bravery, dogs could accomplish many unique tasks. 
It's also easy to picture Mr. Tinkles as the
supervillain.  I am reminded of a movie villain named
Blofeld (a recurring nemesis of early James Bond
films) who always held this type of cat in his lap. 
Maybe this cat will succeed where Blofeld failed.  Mr.
Tinkles has a deadpan, capricious demeanor and is as
demented as he is funny.</P>
<P>A better family film along this genre is "Spy Kids." 
That film had more energy.  However, children will
love the talking animals and adults should find enough
humor to keep them from getting bored throughout the
87-minute running time.  Like cats and dogs, this film
is nice to have around.</P>
