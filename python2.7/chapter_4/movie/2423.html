<PRE>                                REALITY BITES
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofolo,
           Steve Zahn.
Screenplay:  Helen Childress.
Director:  Ben Stiller.</PRE>
<P>     In print and television interviews, everyone associated with
REALITY BITES has been trying desperately to convince potential viewers
that it's not a "Generation X" movie, but just a simple romantic
comedy.</P>
<PRE>     Yeah.  Right.</PRE>
<P>     REALITY BITES follows SLACKER; SINGLES; and BODIES, REST & MOTION
in the sweepstakes to most accurately capture the 20-something
zeitgeist, but I found it more reminiscent of star Winona Ryder's
breakthrough film HEATHERS.  While REALITY BITES does include some very
funny moments and finely observed insight, it also tends to reduce its
central characters to a collection of kitschy bon mots.</P>
<P>     Ryder stars in REALITY BITES as Lelaina Pierce, a recent college
grad living in Houston.  Lelaina, an aspiring filmmaker, works as an
intern at a local morning talk show while filming a documentary about
herself and her closest friends:  acerbic roommate Vickie (Janeane
Garofolo), a clerk at the Gap; cynical grunge musician Troy (Ethan
Hawke); and in-the-closet gay Sammy (Steve Zahn).  Tensions begin when
Troy loses his job and moves in with Lelaina and Vickie, then heighten
when Lelaina begins dating Michael (Ben Stiller), an executive for
MTV-clone In Your Face TV.  Their relationship forces Troy to deal with
his feelings for Lelaina, and about responsibility in general.
Meanwhile, Vicke faces an HIV test, and Sammy considers coming out to
his parents.</P>
<P>     REALITY BITES is strongest on the level of details and the number
of individual laughs of recognition they provide.  I will admit to
participating in a group sing-along of "Conjunction Junction" like
these characters, and to playing games based on sit-com episodes.
Screenwriter Helen Childress, all of 23 years old, realizes that the
common thread binding her chronological peers is 1970s schlock culture,
and the disillusionment born of watching their parents conspicuously
credit consume them out of a bright future.  Vickie is perhaps the most
recognizable type to me; I know a few people who cover their walls with
old music posters and beg for you to turn up bad power pop songs with
memories of junior high school dances.  More so than SINGLES, REALITY
BITES identifies the sense of ideological drift that characterizes
Americans in their mid-20s, but without the moody self-importance of
BODIES, REST & MOTION.</P>
<P>     This is not to say that Childress doesn't also give in to easy
stereotypes.  Every parent in REALITY BITES is characterized by a
cartoonish materialism, and becomes an easy target for blame.  Lelaina
never develops a distinct personality, instead becoming a
representation of the job traumas of the generation.  The romantic
triangle doesn't have quite the impact it could have had because as
attractive as Ryder is, she doesn't seem nearly as interesting as, say,
Vickie.  Troy is an even more problematic character, a first class
self-absorbed jerk who philosophizes in bastardized advertising
jingles.  The transformation Childress tries to foist off on us is far
too contrived, and she seems too willing to let Troy's attitude stand
as an acceptable response to the world he perceives.  Fortunately, they
are somewhat balanced by two delightful supporting performances.  Comic
Janeane Garofolo (TV's THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW) is hysterical as Vickie,
displaying a natural timing which makes the most mundane lines funny.
Director Ben Stiller is charming as Lelaina's perpetually flustered
suitor, and should be congratulated for risking the hesitating delivery
which makes his character appear very real.</P>
<P>     I have to note that I was extremely disappointed by the ending of
REALITY BITES, but that may say more about me than about the film.
While there are numerous character stumbles, overall I felt the tone
was on target, and I laughed a lot.  REALITY BITES off a bit more than
it can chew, but it all goes down eventually.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Big Gulps:  7.</PRE>
