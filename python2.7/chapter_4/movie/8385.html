<P>     Well, once again, a summer movie has surprised me.  This time, it's
AIR FORCE ONE, which is the long-sit of the season that *I* didn't see
coming.  As the trailers have trumpeted for the last six months, Har-
rison Ford plays President Ass Kicker, a Chief Executive who has to make
like Kurt Russell making like Steven Seagal making like Bruce Willis,
when *his* plane is hijacked by Russian loyalists.  (The Commander in
Chief is hurried into the escape pod, but chooses to hang around, be-
cause his wife and daughter are still aboard and, friends, that's one
family you just don't go messin' with.) Director Wolfgang Petersen (IN
THE LINE OF FIRE, DAS BOOT) is a bonafide master of claustrophobic com-
bat, I'll give him that.  We're always aware of the bad guys, no matter
what curtain they're hiding behind.  (Is the President's 747 really that
big on the inside?) And, with the help of visual effects supervisor
Richard Edlund, Petersen also pulls off a couple of breathtaking aerial
sequences.  (An aborted landing at Ramstein Air Base is an early show
stopper.  Cool crash trucks, too.)</P>
<P>     The problem-- well, one of them-- is that Petersen serves up a few
too many crises.  Three too many, to be exact.  Sure, the action, when
it finally gets rockin' and rolling, is a welcome relief to a talky
first hour.  But do we really need to wrap with attacking fighters *and*
an aerial rescue *and* one last, lurking bad guy?  Sigh.  The ending
also boasts the weakest special effects in the movie, including some
obviously computer-generated water wonders.  (All of which, like the
rest of the scenes, are accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's head-pounding
score.  Please pass the aspirin.) Another big botch is the choice of
villains.  Really, the motives of the terrorists-- whose soft-spoken
leader (Gary Oldman) seeks the release of an imprisoned general-- are as
patriotic as any American character in the movie.  They've just chosen a
more violent means to their end.  (Well, almost.  As Oldman's character
takes pains to point out, the United States is quite fond of murder when
it comes to protecting *their* interests.  And "snap" goes another bad
guy's neck.) All in all, AIR FORCE ONE gives a convincing illusion of
being the most believable and ably constructed of the summer stock.
Watch with your eyes open, however, and you might agree that it's just
one more dumb, loud blockbuster. </P>
