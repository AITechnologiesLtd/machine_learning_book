<PRE>THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE
--------------------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) has it all.  He's an amateur golf 
champion whose girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), is the
beautiful daughter of Savannah's wealthiest man.  However Junuh is so
traumatized by his experiences in WWI, he returns to Savannah a broken
man.  He makes no attempt to see Adele, preferring to play cards in a
shack on his estate and drink to forget.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Adele has lost her father and is on the brink of losing his
last creation, the Krewe Island golf resort, because of the depression.  
She sells all she has to come up with a $10,000 golf exhibition prize and
charms the era's two (real life) greatest golfers, ladies man Walter Hagen 
(Bruce McGill, "The Insider") and Ivy League grand slammer Bobby Jones (Joel 
Gretsch, TV's "The Bold and the Beautiful") to compete, but Savannah 
demands one of their own play.  Young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief,
Jack Lemmon in present day), the story's narrator, proposes Junuh and
bicycles off to deliver him.</P>
<P>Junuh declines Hardy, but goes out to swing a few anyway.  Out of the darkness
arrives a stranger, Bagger Vance (Will Smith), who offers to caddy for
Junuh for $5 guaranteed.  Bagger has a way of talking Junuh back into his
game and soon Savannah is gripped in a home town media frenzy.</P>
<P>"The Legend of Bagger Vance" is a signature Robert Redford film, evoking
his starring turn in "The Natural" and the nostalgic glow of his own
"A River Runs Through It."  Golf is used as a metaphor for life as Bagger
advises Junuh and his young protege Hardy 'you can't win the game, you can
only play the game,' and 'find your place in the field - you need to find
your swing - get out of its way and let it find you.'</P>
<P>The cast is generally fine.  Smith holds back, speaking softly, letting
his words form a whisper cloud around Junuh's head.  His non philosophical
comments lend the film most of its humor.  It's a confident performance.
Damon is OK, if unexceptional as the conflicted Junuh, although he does
have a real shining moment when he explains to Hardy why he drinks.  Theron's
mostly decorative, with a Southern accent that wavers in and out.  </P>
<P>Character actor Bruce McGill is fun as the lusty Walter Hagen.  His golfing
style, where severe missteps are countered with brilliant catchup maneuvers,
is fun to watch, particularly when he's sizing up his next move, barefoot
in water wielding his ever present smoke.  Even better is Joel Gretsch as
the amazingly talented Bobby Jones.  It's Gretsch, not Damon, who's the real
Redford Golden boy standin.  He creates an elegant, upstanding athlete.
Young Moncrief has a wide-eyed face and displays real enthusiasm for the
game of golf and hero worship of Junuh.</P>
<P>Redford really involves us in the two day 36 hole game, visualizing the act
of focus and creating suspense in the outcome.  Unfortunately his present
day bookending of the tale with Jack Lemmon recalls the similarly poor
use of the device in "Saving Private Ryan."  The central romance is
underbaked as well, mostly because we're not given enough background on
why Adele remained single for a decade.  The script rather lamely has
them declare their attraction as 'dancing well together.' </P>
<P>Production and costume design are first rate.  Several scenes set at the 
resort recall the period flashbacks of "The Shining."</P>
<P>If you can invest in the mysticism of Will Smith's supernatural Caddy (the 
only black man apparently admitted into Krewe Island's locker room) and the 
old-fashioned storyteling/filmmaking on display here, you may be surprised 
at the rewards to be found.  Cynical filmgoers should avoid this one.</P>
