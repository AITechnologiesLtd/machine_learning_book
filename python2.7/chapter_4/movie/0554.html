                              MIRACLE MILE
                       A film review by Than Nguyen
                        Copyright 1989 Than Nguyen</PRE>
<P>     I liked MIRACLE MILE even though the concept of the movie isn't
particularly original.  The main character, Harry Washello, has  just met the
woman of his dreams while wandering through a museum at the LaBrea Tar Pits.
He's a trumpet player, a self-professed Glen Miller wannabee, who looks sort of
sweet and honest like John Boy from the  Waltons.  Julie's a waitress, an
"old-fashioned girl" who lives with her grandmother; she also promises to
"screw his eyeballs blue" on their first date.  Fine.  So they have the hots
for each other.  "Big deal!"  you say.</P>
<P>     Their hot date doesn't go as planned.  Harry inadvertently answers a phone
call meant for someone else.  The caller is a young soldier stationed in a
missile silo in North Dakota.  He had meant to call his  father to say goodbye.
You see...The BOMB is coming.</P>
<P>     Harry is stunned.  He can't be sure if the phone call was real or if it
was a prank.  I couldn't tell either.  Throughout the movie, I kept changing
my mind as the situations became more frantic.  "Oh s**t! it's real."
"Sigh...it's not real.", etc.   Now that I have had some time to mull over it,
I'd say that the suspense is reminiscent of AFTER HOURS.</P>
<P>     The movie did raise some questions.  What if an ordinary person, someone
I'd trust, tells me that the BOMBS are flying *now* and that I have 50 minutes
'til I'm vaporized.  Would I be more likely to believe it if I heard it from a
clean cut man in a suit as opposed to a disheveled homeless person?  And if
the BOMB really is coming, what should a responsible adult do?  Will I regret
not doing the things I really want to do but never had the time for?</P>
<P>     MIRACLE MILE doesn't have the clinical horror of THE WAR GAME (the BBC
production) or the goofiness of THE ATOMIC CAFE, but I did feel that I got my
money's worth out of it and I would recommend it to my friends.  Oh...and don't
see it alone.  I think you'd want to have a friend along to talk about the
movie afterwards, over your favorite-dessert-which-you-have-been-avoiding.</P>
