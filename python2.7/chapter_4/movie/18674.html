<PRE>The President's Analyst (1967)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 64</PRE>
<P>Perhaps this purportedly hilarious satire was
never that funny, even in 1967.  But there are
positive things to say about "The President's
Analyst".  James Coburn does well in the lead
role, the sets and cinematography are good,
and there's plenty of action.</P>
<P>Dr. Sidney Shaefer (Coburn) has been selected
to be the President's psychiatrist.  At first,
Shaefer is pleased with his important position.
But he soon tires of being at the President's
beck and call.  He is constantly tailed by
'FBR' and 'CEA' agents.  Worse, the unpleasant
'FBR' chief has separated him from his girlfriend
(Joan Delaney) because he 'talks in his sleep'.</P>
<P>Shaefer decides to flee.  But having been privy
to Presiential secrets, he becomes a kidnapping
target for Russian spies, and thus an assassination
target for American spies.  Much silliness follows,
including Shaefer joining a hippie rock band led
by Barry Maguire, and an assault on the insidious
telephone monopoly.</P>
<P>There is much cartoonish violence in this satire.
Many fiendish agents meet their maker.  Violence
does not bother me in films when it is necessary
or when its consequences (i.e. suffering) are shown.
But in "The President's Analyst" the shootings,
stabbings, stranglings, etc. are solely intended
to be humorous, and not ironical or repressive.</P>
<P>The biggest surprise in "The President's Analyst"
is that the Russians, represented by their top spy
Kropotkin (Severn Darden), are the good guys.
The 'FBR' and 'CEA' agents prefer Shaefer dead,
except for Don Masters (Godfrey Cambridge), who
wants Shaefer to return as his personal analyst.
The second surprise is that when Coburn wears a
hippie wig he looks a lot like Neil Young.
Also, Will Geer looks like Colonel Sanders, but
this is not as surprising.</P>
