<P>STEVE MARTIN SHINES BUT SGT.BILKO FAILS TO IMPRESS</P>
<P>Based on the popular 50's sitcom, SGT. BILKO follows the string of 
old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever. Remember THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE or 
THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES released sometime back? (BRADY BUNCH was a 
moderate hit in in the US while HILLBILLIES flopped). I do not really 
know whether the Hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just 
being plain lazy, but the TV-conversion-movies are hitting our screens 
like wildfire, sad to say, with mixed success. Such movies are mostly 
targeted at US viewers since they are usually followings of such series 
over there and the larger the following, the more likely the sitcom will 
be made into a movie. SGT. BILKO (frankly, I have not seen any its 
original TV version), even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen 
STEVE MARTIN and DAN AKROYD; failed to entertain.   </P>
<P>Sgt. Ernest Bilko is the man behind the motor pool (place of vehicle 
storage and repair) of Fort Baxter. Though totally unskilled in the field 
of work that he is supposed to be in charge of, he has an almost 
superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities; 
from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-D pools. Though 
materialistic in mind, Bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the 
lives of the men of Fort Baxter, providing them with some form of real 
recreation within the camp and the people love him for that. Colonel Hall 
runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' 
state, Bilko has managed to hide his operation, though nearly every 
living person in the fort knows about it. Bilko's state of ascent is 
suddenly under-fire when the Pentagon sends Major Thorn, a tough cookie 
on army regulations, to check on the progress on the $70 million 
Hovertank project, a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds. 
To add to his problems, Thorn is determined to bring Bilko down in 
retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by Bilko during their younger 
army days. </P>
<P>Director Jonathan Lynn, who directed MY COUSIN VINNY (In which Marisa 
Tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress) managed to pull SGT. 
BILKO through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of 
laughter, but that is about it. There are really not enough 
laughter-packed-moments in SGT. BILKO to fully entertain the average 
movie-goer. Still, Steve Martin's Sgt. Bilko is played with finesse and 
full-force by the renowned comedian. Without him, SGT. BILKO would have 
just fell flat on its face. SGT. BILKO did moderately well in the US box 
office early this year but I doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the 
world.   </P>
<P>The current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a 
blessing in disguise, really; at least it will force Hollywood to re-think 
any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at 
the very least approach those ideas with more creativity.</P>
<P>Unless you are a fan of the TV-series or love to watch Steve Martin in 
action, you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the 
local theatres. I'm sure there are better ones around.</P>
