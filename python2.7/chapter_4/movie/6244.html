                      The Secret Agent (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>THE SECRET AGENT gives new meaning to the thriller genre.  Here is a
tense, taut, thrill-a-minute tour through Soho, London in 1886 with a
spy, Anarchists and Nihilists, including  Robin Williams in a
non-credited role, who walks around with a hand grenade.   Terrorism,
such as we recently experienced in Oklahoma, is not something new.
Hold onto your seat!</P>
<P>Verloc (Bob Hoskins) is both a secret agent and a spy for Russia.
His job is to provoke the dissidents into explosive action while he
pretends to be one of them   When the Russian Embassy decides he is
not doing enough to earn the money they are paying him, they order him
to plant a bomb which will be blamed on the Anarchists.   But things
do not work out as planned, do they?</P>
<P>Verloc has been living nicely on the money he receives as a spy-
provocateur.  He has a young wife, Winnie, (Patricia Arquette)  who
married him so she could take care of her brother, Stevie (Christian
Bale) a somewhat retarded young man who lives with Winnie and Verloc.</P>
<P>While the anarchists complain about government interference in their
lives, they are not men of action and so they are permitted  to engage
in soap-boxing.  But the man known as "The Professor" (George
Spelvin) is a nihilist seeking to destroy everything.   He wants to
invent the perfect explosive. All hell breaks loose in the Verloc
household when Verloc attempts to plant the bomb.</P>
<P>Patricia Arquette will surely be nominated for an Oscar for the
brilliance of her portrayal of Winnie.  Bob Hoskins is his usual
underplayed self and here as the spy he is perfect.   This then is a
thriller you will not want to miss.</P>
