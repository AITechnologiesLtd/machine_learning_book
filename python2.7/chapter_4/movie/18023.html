<P>Note: This review may include elements that are possible spoilers; if 
you haven't seen the film yet, and plan to, read with caution.</P>
<P>Acclaimed independent director Todd Solondz is not, and I repeat not, a 
fluke. Since making the criminally overlooked 1989 gem, "Fear, Anxiety, 
and Depression" and the brilliant, uncompromising 1996 "Welcome to the 
Dollhouse," Solondz has proven that he has a very distinct and 
on-the-mark way of coming up with original characters set against the 
backdrop of dire, seriously downbeat stories, and then, somehow, is able 
to make them funny. Not a one-liner sort of funny, but the sort of funny 
that comes from wonderously accurate situations in which comedy 
naturally shines through, even as we are suffering along with the people 
on-screen. Solondz's latest film, "Happiness," which is now available on 
video and DVD after a controversial but much-heralded run in theaters 
(its original distributor, Universal, dropped the film after being 
scared off with the dark subject matter, only for the indie company, 
Good Machine Productions, to graciously snap it up). And after finally 
seeing the film, I have two comments concerning this: (1) words fail me 
to think that Universal can snub this masterful piece of work, but then 
release such "award winners" as the horror joke-fest, "Bride of Chucky," 
and the schmaltzy, embarrassingly sentimental, "Patch Adams"; and (2) 
why exactly did this film recieve an initial NC-17 rating, only to drop 
it and go unrated? Sure, the material that is dealt with reaches into 
the darkest depths of human nature, but not even a miniscule second of 
it is in any way exploitative, and the two infamous ejaculation scenes 
aren't even as graphically displayed as in 1998's R-rated box-office 
hit, "There's Something About Mary." I guess since "...Mary" reached for 
the lowest-common-denominator, while "Happiness" dealt with its 
characters and situations truthfully, the MPAA didn't know how to react 
to something so intelligent. </P>
<P>In true Altmanesque style, a 'la "Nashville" and "Short Cuts," 
"Happiness" interweaves several different stories together into a 
perfectly-woven tapestry that is admittedly quite ironic, since the 
title of the film is the farthest possible feeling away that any of the 
miserable characters presented here could be. The picture centers on 
three New Jersey-based sisters and the people around them, all of which 
have their definite problems and eccentricities. Joy Jordan (Jane Adams) 
is the youngest of the three, a recently-turned thirty-year-old who 
still lives at her parent's home, writes songs and plays the guitar in 
her spare time, seems destined to get involved in loser guys, and is 
told early on by her sister, Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), that everyone 
always thought she would be a failure. Trish, the oldest sister, is a 
joyful housewife and mother of three who naively does not know that her 
psychiatrist husband, Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), is secretly a 
pedophile who often buys children's magazines to get off on them and 
seems to be headed down a path of destruction. And finally, the third 
sister, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), is a much-admired writer who is 
growing bored of her artificial and aimless relationships with men and 
believes that her own writing is terrible. Two of her poems, entitled 
"Rape at 11" and "Rape at 12," lead her to ultimately wish that she had
 been raped as a child, simply so she could be authentic. Helen becomes 
intrigued one day when she recieves an anonymous obscene phone call that 
is actually coming from her nerdy, insecure, and overweight neighbor, 
Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who randomly chooses numbers in the 
phone book and calls the women up, only to spit out sexual and verbal 
threats upon them. </P>
<P>As you can already see, the peoples' lives that inhabit "Happiness" 
certainly aren't made up of sugar and spice and everything nice, and 
many of the depressed or unusual characters haven't even been mentioned, 
including the Jordan sisters' parents, Mona and Lenny (Louise Lasser and 
Ben Gazzara), who are getting separated after forty years of marriage; 
Bill and Trish's 11-year-old son, Billy (Rufus Read), who has recently 
become concerned that he hasn't been able to "cum" yet; another neighbor 
of Allen's, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), an obese, lonely woman who is 
harboring a dark secret of her own concerning the death of the apartment 
buiding's doorman; an angry possible suitor (Jon Lovitz) of Joy's who 
practically snaps her in half with crushingly mean-spirited words after 
she breaks up with him; and another one of Joy's troubled romances, Vlad 
(Jared Harris), who is a Russian taxi driver and thief.</P>
<P>Todd Solondz's "Happiness" is one of the most startlingly courageous and 
assured films of 1998, a movie that takes these wide variety of 
off-centered character, all of which could have easily been transformed 
into caricatures, but instead, treats them honestly and openly as 
(severely) flawed, but strangely likable human beings, some of which you 
may find yourself surprisingly sharing characteristics with as the film 
presses on. "Happiness" is filled to bursting with incredibly harsh and 
painful emotions, but as is standard with Solondz, much of it is 
downright hilarious as well, and intentionally so. It wouldn't be too 
great of a shock to actually find youself ashamed at almost inexplicably 
laughing at certain very human situations, as well as the characters 
themselves. After only three films, it is obvious that Solondz is one of 
the masters of flawlessly intermingling both pitch-black comedy and 
heartbreaking drama, sometimes at the very same moment.</P>
<P>Because of the fine line the film is constantly walking on between 
realism and ludicrousness, it was vital that the screenplay, by Solondz, 
and the many performances not be merely adequate, and they aren't. The 
writing is particularly effective because of the facile way that it 
moves from one group of characters to the next, and then back again, all 
the while constantly coming up with fresh, stirring, humorous, and 
devastating situations. In the one previously mentioned scene that is 
obviously so emotionally damaging for Joy, Trish tells her the truth 
about how everyone feels negatively about her path in life, foolishly 
unaware that words really do hurt.</P>
<P>In the acting department, "Happiness" has acquired several well-known 
actors (but not overly so) as well as some first-timers in a starring 
role. Jane Adams, whom has previously been seen in such small roles as 
1995's "Father of the Bride II" and 1998's "Music From Another Room," is 
the one truly kind character, as Joy, and Adams brings out all of her 
appropriate emotions, including the confusion that she feels for what 
she wants to do in her life. Joy loves playing the guitar and writing 
songs, but is hesitant to show them to anyone, and moves from one job 
(as a telephone operator) to another (a teacher for distrusting foreign 
refugees!). One very funny scene, due to the so-genuine-it's-scary way 
that the characters react, occurs when another worker at the telephone 
job dies, but when she tells one of her co-workers (Molly Shannon) all 
about him, a budding conversation erupts around the office as everyone 
else tries to figure out who he was, even though he worked with all of 
them for a whole year. </P>
<P>As Trish, Stevenson is perfect as the unsuspecting wife and mother who 
"has it all," even though she is clueless to her husband's very serious 
and criminal problem. In perhaps the best performance in the film, Dylan 
Baker is remarkable and sincere as the chronic child-molesting Bill, and 
what is even more astounding is how much we are able to sympathize and 
care about him, even after we watch him in one disturbing, nerve-racking 
scene, drug his whole family and his son's playmate at a sleepover, just 
so he can have his way with the young child. The brutally honest 
relationship between Bill and his son, Billy, is also highly 
confounding, since they are able to speak to each other with such 
unabashed frankness, and about the most personal things imaginable.</P>
<P>Philip Seymour Hoffman is amusing as the rather pathetic and shy Allen, 
as his main hobby, we find, is simply making obscene phone calls. 
Clearly, he has terminally low self-esteem, so when he finally rings up 
Helen who, in response, calls him back with *69 and tells him to call 
her again some other time, he doesn't know how to respond. His 
blossoming romance with his neighbor, Kristina, is one of the more 
touching elements in the film. As played poignantly by Camryn Manheim 
(TV's "The Practice"), Kristina keeps coming over to talk to Allen 
because she likes him, but he thoughtlessly ignores her, even though she 
is exactly what he has been looking for all along: a loving, caring 
relationship.</P>
<P>Also of special notice is Lara Flynn Boyle as the third sister, Helen. 
Boyle has always been an actress I've kept my eye on, and she deserves 
more challenging and satisfying work, such as this film. Louise Lasser 
is a hoot as the sisters' aging mother, a sarcastic, precarious woman 
who, in one of the funniest scenes, spots her husband's possible 
mistress walking down the street and immediately begins to aim her car 
right for her, only to pull out of it at the last minute and wave to her 
as she passes by. Jon Lovitz also makes quite an impression in the 
attention-getting opening scene, especially since he is playing someone 
so unlike any other character I've seen him portray.</P>
<P>Although it's almost foolish to compare such two recently great films, 
"Happiness" does not quite reach the overall height of Solondz's 
masterpiece, "Welcome to the Dollhouse," but nor should it have to. With 
this latest motion picture, Solondz has taken a gigantic risk, and with 
so many characters, it's inevitable that a few moments would feel 
marginally uneven. At a sizable running time of 140 minutes, the film is 
never, ever boring and the time flies by. If Solondz had failed with 
this film, it would have been damaging to his career because of the many 
chances that are taken, but he grandly succeeds in almost everything he 
has set out to do. Yes, most of the characters are outlandish, at times 
dangerous, people that you wouldn't really want to meet, but what 
Solondz has done is taken these extreme characters to bring us a 
portrait of lonely, seemingly meaningless lives that most likely stand 
for our own. No one in "Happiness" is actually happy, but they 
persistently strive to be just that. God, don't we all?</P>
