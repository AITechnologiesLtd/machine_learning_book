<PRE>POST COITUM
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Post Coitum is an unusual film about human sexual relations - both
because it's told completely from the woman's perspective and because
it shows graphically but always tastefully the heat of passion.</P>
<P>     Starting with a close-up of a cat with a serious case of heat,
director Brigitte Rouan cuts to a scene of herself - she's also the
star - alone in bed in a similar fit of heat.  The remarkably frank
story by Santiago Amigorena, Jean-Louis Richard, Brigitte Rouan and Guy
Zylberstein studies the impact of an affair by a middle-aged married
woman, Diane Clovier (Rouan), a successful publisher who nurtures her
authors like their mother.</P>
<P>     Diane has a wonderful husband, a successful trial lawyer named
Phillipe (Patrick Chesnais), and two lovely young teenage sons.  Diane
is a good "mum," who likes playing soccer with her boys in the park.
With her everywoman looks - attractive but nothing special - Rouan is
the perfect choice for the part.</P>
<P>     Into her life one day walks a young hunk named Emilio Pessi,
played with animal instincts by a suave and sexy Boris Terral who, with
his long curly hair and deep eyes, would attract any woman's attention.
Emilio tells her he is a "plumber," a "hydraulic engineer for the Third
World" to be precise.</P>
<P>     Soon they are locked in the throws - and I do mean throws - of
passion.  Most movies about adultery have a quick tryst and then the
character spends the rest of the movie in anguish.  POST COITUM, on the
other hand, doesn't pull any punches in showing the joy of the affair.
When the movie turns tragic, Rouan the director should have retained
better control of Rouan the actor, but in the protagonist's downfall,
as in her ecstasy, her emotions are quite palpable.</P>
<P>     The movie is encumbered with two needless side-plots.  One
involves a murderer whom Phillipe is defending, and another is about an
author suffering from second-book syndrome.  Eliminating both would
have made for a cleaner narrative.</P>
<P>     "Absolute passion is a tragedy," Phillipe says in a practice
summation to the jury about a case of an elderly murderer.  His speech
is filled with double meanings.  If someone had defended Diane's
actions, they might argue that she loved too much and none too wisely.</P>
<P>     POST COITUM runs 1:37.  The movie is in French with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would probably get an R for nudity,
graphic sex, and profanity.  The movie is not appropriate for
teenagers.</P>
