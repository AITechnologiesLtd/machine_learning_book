Originally Released December 12, 1997</PRE>

<PRE>* * * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>SCREAM 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of
horror movie sequels quite well. During a film-class discussion, Windsor
College students articulate what these inevitable laws are, and why sequels
never live up to the originals. A few rare exceptions are noted, but they left
out one . . . SCREAM 2!</P>
<P>1996's surprise horror blockbuster SCREAM became an instant hit and developed
an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in America!
A sequel was unavoidable, but luckily the re-teaming of writer Kevin
Williamson and director Wes Craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost
entertainment. In fact, at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the
adorning fans of SCREAM, I would say that SCREAM 2 might even be the better
film!</P>
<P>Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the sinuous heroine who survived a series of
murders in Woodsboro, CA in the original SCREAM, is now two years older and
off to college, majoring in theater. Meanwhile, TV journalist Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox), who covered the murders in the first film, has since written a
book about the dreadful events; a book titled "Stab", which has been developed
into a major motion picture. As SCREAM 2 opens, a crowd of overzealous
teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "Stab",
and before long, a young couple are butchered to death, unnoticed in the midst
of hysteria. This marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown
"copycat" sets out to repeat what's been done . . . and finish what hasn't!</P>
<P>Of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the
first film, and yes, movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological
outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of
gorgeous twenty year olds, but this *is* a sequel, and without deviating from
the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies.
This is in large part due to Williamson's deliciously written script, which
will easily leave you satisfied. As much as the film condemns the use of
cliches, it is riddled with them, but it is done so effectively, and with
skillful direction by Craven, that you're not bound to complain. I will note,
however, that the "whodunit?" did wind up being the first person I suspected,
but believe me, I kept changing my mind as I tried to stay one ahead of the
movie.</P>
<P>All the actors outdo themselves here. We're not talking Oscar performances,
but Cambell, Cox, David Arquette as Dewey Riley, and Jamie Kennedy as Randy
all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last
outing. The characters remain true to their roots, and yet show a clear sign
of development over the last two years. We can see how the events in the first
film has affected them, but we don't lose any of the luster that made them
such a delight to watch in the first place.</P>
<P>The nice thing about SCREAM 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's
predecessor. It's a natural, smooth, and believable (as far as horror films
go) transition from film to film. We skip two years, but there doesn't seem to
be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks. It flows so well
that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book (long chapters,
eh?) than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces. While main characters
are usually the only connection in sequels, SCREAM 2's entire plot structure
correlates *completely* with the first, making for immediate fondness and
absorption.</P>
<P>As I said before, SCREAM 2 easily lives up to, if not surpassing, it's
precursor. The only reason SCREAM will likely be hailed above SCREAM 2 is
because it was the first. This doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique,
whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel, it just means that SCREAM
will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's
sought-after qualities. If ever a film followed it's original so well, it
would be SCREAM 2, and it makes this a definite must-see for all those
unbridled SCREAM fans out there.</P>
<P>SCREAM 2 fits snugly alongside SCREAM, and will hopefully receive as many high
remarks. It would top off the series quite well, if it weren't for the fact
that two movies don't really make a series. It's unlikely to assume that a
SCREAM 3 won't appear in the next few years, but if they do decide to turn
this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy, let's hope they can keep up
the fantastic work. Like they say, don't mess with perfection . . . but when a
money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed, who's gonna listen?</P>
