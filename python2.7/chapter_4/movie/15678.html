Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>"Home Fries," has been wrongfully sentenced to a misleading ad campaign 
which makes the film look like a simple, sweet love story. But, on the 
other hand, I can also understand the marketer's decision, since, "Home 
Fries," is actually a dark comedy involving deception and murder, with a 
romance stuck in between. In some ways, it felt like a PG-13 version of 
another new, and far superior, film that was released on the same exact 
day, "Very Bad Things."</P>
<P>The first sign that this would not be your usual romance came in the 
first five minutes, in which a middle-aged man (Chris Ellis) is 
terrorized at night by a helicopter, and is scared to death. The people 
in the plane, we find out, are the man's sons, sympathetic Dorian (Luke 
Wilson) and bad-tempered Angus (Jake Busey), who only meant to frighten 
him a little because their domineering mother (Catherine O'Hara) wanted 
to seek revenge on him due to him having an affair. While in the 
helicopter, Dorian and Angus hear voices over their head phones, and 
suspect that someone might have heard the murder. After narrowing down 
the possible people it could be, they find out the voice was coming from 
Sally (Drew Barrymore), a sweet-natured young woman pregnant with Dorian 
and Angus' father's baby, who works at the Burger Matic, a fast-food 
restaurant. Dorian is forced to get a job there to figure out who the 
witness was, but in the process, begins to fall in love with Sally, even 
though his mother and brother want her dead!</P>
<P>As you can see, "Home Fries," is anything but an ordinary romance, but 
instead, a wicked, offbeat comedy, with a few action scenes sprinkled in 
for good (or bad) measure. Although I appreciate the fact that director 
Dean Parisot and screenwriter Vince Gilligan were trying to make an 
original film, it simply doesn't work.</P>
<P>The heart of the film does, in fact, come from the blossoming romance 
between Barrymore and Wilson (also dating in real life), and I liked all 
of their scenes together a whole lot. As always, Barrymore is radiant 
throughout, managing to develop a three-dimensional, likable character 
with an underwritten role. Wilson, who is actually the main character, 
is engaging and every match for Barrymore. Also lending support is 
O'Hara, who could have easily played one-note throughout, but chose 
instead to not just make her character a cliched villainess. Meanwhile, 
Shelley Duvall, as Sally's mother, was amusing, but not given enough 
screen time.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, for every good performance and delightful, well-written 
scene, there would be a large amount of off-the-wall material that did 
not work at all. It was as if two very different films had been 
forcefully molded into one. A climactic helicopter chase was annoying 
and failed to salvage my last remaining hope for the movie.</P>
<P>Perhaps my biggest overall problem with, "Home Fries," was that it felt 
as if it had been heavily edited prior to its release. When the end 
credits began to roll, I was surprised, since I was expecting at least 
another fifiteen minutes. The film felt rushed, and all of the 
relationship remained open-ended and unsolved. The character 
development, although I liked what they had of it, was also 
unsatisfactory. In the case of, "Home Fries," more would have most 
certainly been more.</P>
