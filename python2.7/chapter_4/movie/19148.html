<P>   The ayatollahs, the Saddamites, and the French
nationalists can holler from the rooftops all they want about
the influence of American culture on their traditional values. 
Ultimately these spokesmen will not prevail.  From at least
1945, when the Yanks captured the hearts and minds of
Europeans with their generous offerings of chewing gum to
war-torn youngsters, American culture has triumphed big
time.  In the Far East, for example, tensions between the
majority ethnic Chinese and Malaysians in the Malaysian city
of Singapore led to a pact granting Singapore the full status
of an independent country in 1965.  But the nationalism of
Singapore's largely Chinese population did not stop that small
nation from copying and maintaining Western culture from
Burger King to the English language itself.  In fact in director
Glen Goei's semi-autobiographical movie "That's the Way I
Like It"--which gets the title from one of the songs on the
soundtrack--the characters speak English 95% of the time
using the local Malay and Chinese dialects only occasionally
with no rhyme or reason.  In the director's words, the story
"captures my own journey from an Asian culture to a Western
one," the action taking place in the year 1977.</P>
<P>   During the year that the Son of Sam was creating mayhem
in New York City, forcing people in some neighborhoods to
lock their doors and avoid city streets at night, the folks in
Singapore had other ideas.  While New York was suffering
from feverish heat during that summer, a large percentage of
young Singaporean people were suffering from a fever of
their own--their passion for disco music and dance and their
appetite for the style of John Travolta as shown in his
groundbreaking "Saturday Night Fever."  Though the
government of Singapore--like many ruling forces throughout
the world today--may have made every effort to hold on to
traditional values, the death of Bruce Lee led the young to
search for a new hero.  Travolta was their man and at least
one film featuring a Western dancer with an all-purpose
southern accent captured the notice of sizable audiences of
young people.  The lead character (Dominic Pace) steps out
of his movie in a touch of magic realism to become a
guardian angel to one Ah Hock.</P>
<P>   Ah Hock (Adrian Pang) is a young man who would not
have dreamed of being taken in by the dance.  A 20-
something guy with a dead-end supermarket job, a provincial
family, and a vivid imagination, hangs out at night with a
typical bunch, including Hock's childhood friend Ah Mei
(Madeline Tan).  They bowl, they brag, they act in much the
way young adults behave almost everywhere.  Hock's life
turns around when, inspired by the Travolta-like hero of the
movie, he and Mei take dance lessons, later to enter a
competition whose prize money could allow him to buy the
motorcycle of his dreams.  When the beautiful Julie (Anna
Belle Francis) becomes attracted to Hock, Julie's rich and
abusive boy friend Richard (Pierre Png) becomes enraged
and takes steps to break up the budding romance.</P>
<P>   In a subplot that further shows the freedoms that these
Singaporeans are reaching for, Hock's 21-year-old brother,
Leslie (Caleb Goh) shocks his family by expressing his desire
for a sex change operation, which wholly alienates the lad's
father while delighting his pulp fiction-addicted kid sister.</P>
<P>   In writing and directing the film, Goei was obviously
inspired in part by "Saturday Night Fever," but a good deal of
his stimulus comes from the Australian cinema, particularly
from the movie "Strictly Ballroom."  In Baz Luhrmann's 1992
entry, a young ballroom dancer outrages his mother and the
establishment by insisting on dancing his own provocative
steps.  He takes on a homely partner who blossoms under
his guidance.  By contrast, Hock appears to break his
partner's heart by ditching her for a more sophisticated and
accomplished dancer, thereby inciting violence against
himself.  </P>
<P>   By the conclusion of "That's the Way I Like It," young Hock
comes to regret his lack of ethics and good common sense,
demonstrating his born-again ways in a remarkable show of
altruism.  The film challenges credibility by its view that a
fellow with no interest in anything besides bowling, stacking
cans in a supermarket, and dreaming of taking the place of
Bruce Lee, could even think of entering a major nationwide
competition with only a few weeks of lessons.  Yet Adrian
Pang convinces us that the experience of entering the contest
has transfigured him from an unambitious wastrel frequently
late to his dead-end job to a celebrity who learns the meaning
of love and commitment.  </P>
<P>  Since Pang is not a professional dancer, the movie features
abrupt editing (also an attribute of "Saturday Night Fever")
and the scenes of violence are particularly unconvincing--as
though the performers had to pull their punches at a
performance on a live stage.  A slight film throughout, "That's
the Way I Like It" may lack the charm of Masayuki Suo's
"Shall We Dance?"  but profiles a dynamic, if familiar,
soundtrack, with the repeated, obligatory rendering of the
Gibbs' "Staying Alive."  Brian Breheny's photography barely
exploits the city-state's topography, his camera concentrating
on indoor locations like Hock's household, a bowling alley,
and a disco.  Should any viewer be tempted to travel to
Singapore, the film may dissuade him: what we see of that
major port is little more than a modern metropolis devoid of
Far Eastern exoticism.</P>
