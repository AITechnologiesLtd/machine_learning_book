<P>To George Orwell, an aspidistra was a sign of a bourgeois household.  
In this film derived from Orwell's (partly autobiographicl) novel, when 
George Comstock, played by Richard E Grant, is handed an aspidistra by 
his landlady in a seedy shared house in London, he knows that he has 
not left his bourgeois roots behind.</P>
<P>Orwell's novel forms the basis for this likeable romantic comedy.  It 
traces the fortunes of an advertising copywriter who, attracted by the 
idea of life as an impoverished artist, gives up his job in the hope of 
becoming a poet.  The film looks wonderful, and takes its 1930s look 
from the magnificent art deco office where the central character is 
employed at the start.  And the dialogue moves at a good pace, even if 
the social satire is neither as relevant nor as pointed as it would 
have been in Orwell's time.</P>
<P>Richard E Grant plays opposite Helena Bonham Carter, as his girlfriend 
Rosemary - who also works within the same advertising business.  The 
dynamic between the two principal characters is well portrayed - though 
at times one wonders why they bothered to stay in contact at all...  
The transition between affluent London and the slums of Lambeth also 
comes across well.  And while to contemporary Londoners such a contrast 
looks implausible, in the 1930s there was little gentrification around 
areas such as Lambeth.</P>
<P>'Keep the Aspidistra Flying' was criticised, as an opening film for the 
London Film Festival, for being insuffuciently bold an innovative.  But 
it remains an enjoyable and well-made and fine-looking film.</P>
