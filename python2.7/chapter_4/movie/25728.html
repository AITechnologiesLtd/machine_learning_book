<P>    "Animal Factory" looks like a hard-boiled prison drama--
and that it is--but what makes it different from every other
jailhouse story including Frank Darabont's "The Shawshank
Redemption" is that it explores the nature of mentoring. 
Mentors, of course, are people who take other under their
wing, explaining the culture of organizations such as 
businesses to the neophytes, and going to bat for the new
guys to advance the careers of their followers.  Why are
some of us willing to do this?  The least altruistic reason is
that the boss assigns someone to do this job, to show the
ropes to a new worker.  On the other hand, the Online Film
Critics Society maintains an exciting mentoring program in
which volunteer critics look over the reviews of new
applicants and show them how to improve their writing so that
they can be admitted to the fold.  This ranks as the most
unselfish kind of service. </P>
<P>   Now then: why should a hardened criminal in his late
forties show an interest in a handsome guy of about 25 from
a rich family who is sentenced to a tough institution in an
election year for possession of a large quantity of marijuana? 
To get points for an upcoming probation hearing?  Possibly. 
But I know what you're thinking.  The older fellow wants to
turn the callow youth into a punk, meaning in prison
vocabulary a guy who permits sexual favors in return for
protection and a kindly shoulder.  Is that what motivates Earl
Copen (Willem Dafoe) to take  special notice of a new kid,
Ron Decker (Edward Furlong) while some more sinister-
looking guys in the jail have their eye on Decker as well? 
That is perhaps what director Steve Buscemi wants us to
think. That's the most logical assumption and you couldn't be
blamed for holding the view.</P>
<P>   "Animal Factory" is gritty, as you might expect since it
comes across as hardly a country club reformatory for
stockbrokers who trade illegally on specialized knowledge.
Yet Buscemi has made a picture more believable than did
Frank Darabont in '94 when he told the tale of a
straight-arrow guy who is railroaded for a double murder and
sent to prison for life in the late 1940s.  Where Darabont's
drama is an overlong 142 minutes, Buscemi's is a just-right
94, and where "Shawshank" is predictable, "Animal Factory"
surprises.</P>
<P>   The prison which is the scene of frequent stabbings, work
stoppages, rapes, and countless rounds of convict politicking
and scheming is called Eastern State and is actually filmed
by Phil Parment outside Philadelphia at Holmsburg State
prison and at a nearby house of detention.  In the story, we
find that Decker has spent two weeks in the correctional
facility with hopes for an early parole thanks to his rich dad's
(John Heard) manuevers, but when he could use a couple of
favors such as a ticket to the prison show, he is introduced to
Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), who is looked up to as the de
facto leader of the convicts.  Because Copen has no ulterior
motive in taking the kid on--he simply had developed a liking
for the lad--he gradually, without pressure, explains the
ropes, among which is the advice that the word "inmate" is
out.  The prison population like to call themselves "convicts." 
Why?  Who knows.  That's just the culture.  When Decker is
ultimately threatened by the large and menacing Buck Rowan
(Tom Arnold), who approaches the frail young man in the
bathroom demanding that Decker be his punk, Copen is
called on to take the needed action.  </P>
<P>   The serious consequences that follow, including a stringent
penalty thrown on poor Decker by an unsympathetic judge,
turns the 25-year-old onto the road leading to hardened
criminality--making yet another mockery of the idea that our
penitentiaries are correctional facilities.  </P>
<P>   Buscemi's movie is in no way a highly commercial,
frequently hysterical and calculated melodrama such as "The
Shawshank Redemption" or "Midnight Express," and that is to
its credit.  Rejecting the standard Hollywood path, Buscemi
gives the impression at times that he's making a docu-drama,
portraying the real story of prison life but without the deadly
talking-heads routine of conventional documentaries.  We get
the impression that whatever we see actually goes on behind
stone walls--the transvestite Jan the Actress (Mickey Rourke)
who, surprisingly, is not bothered by the goons; the
separation of blacks and whites, occasionally yielding to
outright race riots; the sporadic stabbings in the prison yard
that lead to lockups and to the dumping of suspects into
solitary; the sharing of HIV-infected needles by the dopers in
the jail who are able to get heroin smuggled in with the
cooperation of friendly or indifferent guards.  </P>
<P>   Despite the violence, this is not the sort of movie that
would have even the most sensitive person in the audience
turning away from the screen with one possible exception,
one portrayed in stomach-churning fury by Copen in his
attempt to avoid transfer to a different institution.  The
chemistry between Dafoe and Furlong is this indie's most
valuable offering, an even more important and touching one
than the portrayals of the boredom and brutality that regularly
touch the lives of these unfortunate people.  Buscemi gets
good ensemble work from these veteran actors, who work at
the low end of the pay scale to put out this minimal-budget
movie in just 29 days.</P>
