<PRE>SPHERE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>I've read all but one of Michael Crichton's books (The Great Train Robbery)
and seen all but three of his book-to-film adaptations (The Great Train
Robbery, The Andromeda Strain, and Congo).  Of the Crichton books that I've
read, Sphere is my favourite.  So, as you might have guessed, I was really
looking forward to seeing how well the movie adaptation of Sphere turned out.</P>
<P>Sphere is an early Crichton book.  It's also one of his best books.  Though
all of his books are interesting and include interesting ideas, some of
them don't take full advantage of the ideas presented.  And of those, the
movie adaptations always come out worse than the books.  Sure, the book
Jurassic Park had a good idea and a good director behind it, but as a movie
it was completely wrong.  It was cut down to a shallow and somewhat boring
movie that drove people to the theatres because of its amazing sound and
special effects.  The Lost World was a weak book, which created an even
weaker movie.  Disclosure and Rising Sun had some good ideas and came out
OK onscreen.  Sphere makes it almost unscathed from book to screen.</P>
<P>Sphere is written in a way that it is hard to give a synopsis of the story
without giving away crucial plot points.  So, I'll work my way around the
plot points.  Sphere follows Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman, this
characters name is Norman Johnson in the book) a psychologist who wrote a
paper for the Bush administration about policies and procedures if ever an
alien species were to come to Earth.  In his paper, the Goodman Paper,
Norman outlines a group of individuals who would form a team that would
meet with the aliens.  That included himself, a biochemist (Sharon Stone),
a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), and an astrophysicist (Liev  Schieber).</P>
<P>What we find out is that there has been an apparent spaceship crash in the
middle of the Pacific and this team of experts is gathered together to
greet whatever is on the ship.  But, the twist is that the ship has been
underwater for almost 300 years.  We also find out that Norman wrote the
Goodman Paper not as a serious paper but to earn some extra cash.  "Whoever
reads government documents?"  Norman tries to explain.</P>
<P>Like all other Crichton books and movies, Sphere is both entertaining and
somewhat educational.  But, let's not put too much emphasis on the latter.
Sphere though is highly entertaining and the first half of the film is
captivating.  The latter half of the film gets a little water logged and we
kind of slush through it.  It is not as bad as it sounds though.</P>
<P>Barry Levinson directs Sphere and with Sphere Levinson has two movies on
the market right now both of them starring Dustin Hoffman.  The other film
is Wag the Dog, which is a smarter and stronger film than Sphere.  Levinson
has a style in his films that is hard to describe.  The style is quick with
flashy cuts during dialogue, but it's hard to nail down.  It is a
fascinating style.  Levinson is able to keep the film moving along at a
fast pace and keep the scares coming.  Most of the scares are more
psychological than the type where something jumps out at you. </P>
<P>The script by Stephan Hauser and Paul Attanasio is tight and follows
closely to the book.  But, don't go for a bathroom break or to get food,
you'll miss a lot if you do.  The script is a bit tighter than it should
be, squeezing in a lot of material.  The script doesn't take itself all too
seriously at all times.  There is a high level of humor running through the
script to ease some of the tensions brought on by Levinson's direction.  </P>
<P>With all book-to-movie conversions there are going to be cuts from the book
to the script.  And there are many cuts from the book to the script for
Sphere.  Though many are not important, there are some interesting things
that were cut which I would have liked to see in the film.  Some of them
include the form fitting chairs, more of the interior of the spaceship, and
the huge battle with the monster.  My only big complaint is that there are
too many unanswered questions left after the movie is over (and this goes
for the book also).  I would have like to have more explanation of what
happened and how things happened.</P>
<P>Performances are all strong.  I originally thought that the casting was a
bit strange; come on Dustin Hoffman in another action movie?  He looked
highly uneasy in Outbreak can he really pull this one off?  Hoffman does
well in Sphere.  Sharon Stone was another that I doubted, but her
performance is strong also.  I loved her new short haircut.  Nice.  The
only one that I thought was cast perfectly was Samuel L. Jackson.  The part
of Harry Adams was custom made for Samuel L. Jackson.</P>
<P>The obvious comparison for Sphere, at first, is a comparison to James
Cameron's The Abyss.  But, as you find out after the first few minutes of
Sphere is that the two movies are far apart.  Cameron's The Abyss has a
stronger story with more fleshed out characters and better underwater
cinematography.  In comparison Sphere's characters are not one dimensional,
but they are also not as well written as Cameron's Bud and Lindsey.  And
the underwater cinematography in Sphere is a bit more murky and hard to
make out than The Abyss.</P>
<P>There are some things to keep in mind when viewing Sphere.  In the early
scenes of the movie look for Huey Lewis as the helicopter pilot.  I thought
he looked familiar but couldn't put a finger on it.  Sphere also continues
with Hollywood's obsession with minorities being killed off first.  This
time it's Queen Latifah (Set It Off) getting the ax first.</P>
<P>To date Sphere is the best movie adaptation of a Crichton book.  And since
it is my favourite Crichton book, I'm happy that it is such a good
conversion.  One more thing that was left out and I thought should have
been in the movie was the little twist at the end of the book.  This twist
made the book more enjoyable than the film.  If you like Crichton's
writing, especially his early stuff, then Sphere will be a good choice for
you.  Don't Miss Sphere at the theatres.  This is a fun film that will keep
you at the edge of your seat for the entire running length.</P>
