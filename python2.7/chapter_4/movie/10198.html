<P>I've often wondered how silly actors feel when they narrate a movie. You know,
that voice over that explains everything going on right before your eyes -
either cluing you in on the things you can't see, catching up on all the
preliminary events, or just plain making sure you understand the scene in case
the director can't cut it. I just can't imagine standing at a microphone and
trying to *sound* like the character just talking, and not like I'm reading or
acting. At least with animated movies you can get into the character, but with
a simple narration, you're stuck.</P>
<P>Getting back to the actual movie at hand, PLAYING GOD starts off with David
Duchovny's voice catching us up on his character Eugene Sands' life. In an
extremely laid back Duchovny tone, we come to realize that Eugene is an ex-
doctor whose license was taken away when a patient died at his hands during
surgery. Doesn't this happen once in a while? Yes, but it just so happens that
Eugene was under the influence of narcotics at the time. Ahhh, now you see.</P>
<P>Duchovny rambles on as we watch his character entering an underground club in
search of synthetic heroin. It seems that the tragic event hasn't changed
Eugene's life for the better. Eugene still isn't satisfied with such natural
highs as perfecting a hook shot or bench pressing five more pounds than he did
the week before, and his idea of a snack, as an adult, is no longer cookies
and milk, but rather heroin and milk. Skip the Hershey's chocolate syrup - get
Kurt Cobain on the phone!</P>
<P>As Eugene drinks it up at a bar, we watch two thugs working their way thru the
raving, dimly-lit bodies on the dance floor, their hands lingering on the
insides of their sportscoats. Do you think they could have guns in there? Oh
geez! Well, before you have time to answer that, they pull out their semi-
automatics and pump a few rounds into some poor bastard standing right next to
Eugene. Unfortunately, because of all the underground dealings going on around
this club, nobody will dial 911. In a quick balancing act of morals versus
possible judicial consequences, Eugene falls to the ground and plays MacGyver
after ten years in medical school. He saves the guy's life using a plastic
water bottle to somehow prevent a collapsed lung from being fatal. Three
cheers for Dr. MacGyver, and three hallelujahs for Evian!</P>
<P>Time passes, and little happens in the life of Eugene. We listen to his voice
over recounting the renewed sensation of saving someone's life. He sounds like
a private investigator in some cheesy movie, using flippant metaphors and
analogies such as comparing playing doctor again to a prisoner spending one
day in the sun, making the prison seem so much more bleak. Kicking back with a
dose of heroin, Eugene falls into a deep sleep/trance providing an excellent
opportunity for a flashback to the events that *threw* Eugene from grace. We
watch as a drugged up Dr. Sands kills an already dying woman, but we soon
escape his mind trip to watch as two punks (not the thugs from before), kidnap
the unconscious doctor-no.</P>
<P>Eugene is taken to a beach-side property and introduced to Raymond Blossom, a
fraud catering criminal played by Timothy Hutton. Raymond ends up befriending
Eugene in a very unusual way and Eugene becomes an unofficial mob doc, getting
paid ten grand for every body he works on. Yes - every (space) body. But the
question of legalities still haunt Eugene, not to mention the quirkiness of
the criminals he's almost unwillingly getting so involved with. It seems the
one he wants to get involved with most, Raymond's girlfriend Claire (Angelina
Jolie), is the only one that seems to hate him.</P>
<P>PLAYING GOD is really more of a light-psychological thriller/action pic that
delves into the explication that every little thing you do, whether it seem
important or not, could affect your life in major ways. To be perfectly
honest, this mumbo-jumbo wasn't at all what I found to be worthwhile about
this film. Neither was the great acting . . . of course there wasn't much of
that to begin with. What did make this film worthwhile was it's quirky,
lighthearted yet philosophical approach to an otherwise run-of-the-mill
psychological action flick. Can you say that ten times fast?</P>
<P>There was nothing of high merit in this film, but I was able to sit back and
kill brain cells in a dark theater without getting bored, and that's pretty
good. It starts off a little slow and with a slight insinuation of a
potentially campy film, but it just gets better the longer you watch. Duchovny
is kind of fun even if he is drier than Death Valley. Hutton doesn't do too
bad, but is more noticeable for looking incredibly like Kevin Kline than for
his acting. Jolie is ok for being so underdeveloped, but I didn't complain
that I had to look at her.</P>
<P>In the end, PLAYING GOD doesn't deserve a lot, but it's fun. It's main flaw
would actually be how many plot holes and unresolved (or even never fully
developed) events and characters it has. This one ties up with many loose
ends. In other words, I'd rather hold Glad Ziplock Freezer bags above my head
than this movie, but I still think it's worth checking out when it hits home
video.</P>
