<P>Directed by Roland Emmerich. Screenplay by Robert Rodat. Starring Mel

2000.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I find it amusing that one of the previews before "The Patriot" was for 
"The Hollow Man". That title so accurately sums up this picture: hollow. 
It's been a long time since a movie tried so hard to involve me 
emotionally, and fail so miserably. Don't get me wrong -- "The Patriot" 
looks great, and is broadly entertaining. But much of its almost 
three-hour running time is wasted on flimsy characters and tedious 
retreads masquerading as emotional high points. For once, I wish the 
filmmakers had just been trying to make a summer action pic.</P>
<P>Comparisons with star Mel Gibson's last historical epic, 1995's 
"Braveheart", are perhaps inevitable. Both movies feature Gibson as the 
leader of a band of insurgents against oppressive British rule. There he 
was trying to free Scotland, here it is the American colonies during the 
Revolutionary War. The death of Gibson's wife and ultra-realistic battle 
scenes figure prominently in both pictures. But "Braveheart" stirred a 
raw, genuine response from me. "The Patriot" clearly strives for the same 
sort of impact, but never achieves it. Is it just that I've become more 
cynical in the five years between the two films? Perhaps. But I think 
it's more than that.</P>
<P>"Braveheart", you see, featured real characters. Gibson's William Wallace 
was a compelling hero, and his fate left me both shattered and uplifted. 
Benjamin Martin in "The Patriot" is just Gibson on autopilot. He's not 
poorly-acted, but he's all window dressing with nothing underneath. I 
believed in William Wallace; I can't say the same for Benjamin Martin. 
The same criticism can be levied at Heath Ledger, who plays Ben's eldest 
son Christian. Ledger spends the whole movie mumbling listlessly, like he 
didn't realise rehearsal was over.</P>
<P>For a movie about family to work, we must be convinced of the bonds 
between them, no matter how strained, but "The Patriot" never forges 
those bonds. Indeed, so tepid is the interaction amongst the castmembers 
that it feels almost as if they each filmed their scenes individually, so 
that they could be composited electronically in post-production. Most 
unfortunate is the lack of chemistry between the two stars -- Gibson and 
Ledger feel more like passing acquaintances than father and son.</P>
<P>There is a good story underlying "The Patriot", if only it were in 
service to a better film. Benjamin is a veteran of the French-Indian War, 
but now preaches dialogue instead of combat. Against his father's wishes, 
Christian runs off to join the continental army. When the War of 
Independence comes as close as the Martins' South Carolina fields, Ben 
elects to care for the wounded on both sides, which happens to include 
Christian. But the brutal British Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) has 
the Martin homestead burned anyway, and Christian is arrested for 
carrying colonial dispatches. When another of the Martin sons intervenes, 
Tavington shoots him dead.</P>
<P>This spurs Benjamin into action. Accompanied by two more sons, he 
ambushes and slaughters the British contingent bringing Christian back to 
their camp. That night, one son tells him he's glad he killed British 
soldiers. Here was a perfect opportunity to examine the effects of war on 
the young. But no, the movie passes it by, instead confining itself to 
safe territory well-trod by other movies. Judging from "The Patriot", 
pretty much the only negative ramifications of war are that men have to 
leave home for long spells, and sometimes they never come back. Well, duh.</P>
<P>Things go downhill from there. There are obligatory romances, one each 
for Christian and Benjamin. Christian's at least benefits from involving 
a somewhat charismatic paramour, Anne (Lisa Brenner). Benjamin, however, 
is shoehorned into an unconvincing attraction to his dead wife's sister 
(Joely Richardson). There is no spark between them, and the whole thing 
happens only because the movie demands it. Cliche after cliche is paraded 
across the screen: The bad guy who's not quite dead yet. The token black 
soldier. When a recalcitrant Benjamin is assigned to recruit civilians 
for a militia, the locals demur, until Anne gives a stirring speech. A 
pause and then... you guessed it, one by one all the naysayers stand in 
support of Ben.</P>
<P>The villains of "The Patriot" fare no better than the heroes. Isaacs' 
Tavington has no motivation, and no characterisation beyond "he's mean". 
Tavington was a real person, and his wicked depiction here has drawn the 
wrath of the city of Liverpool, which considers him a hero. Liverpudlians 
needn't worry: I doubt anyone could believe this portrayal is accurate, 
because no real person is so utterly devoid of personality. Tavington's 
superior is General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson), who is at least useful 
for comic relief -- although much of the humor here is so banal, it's 
barely worth a groan. When Benjamin's militia blows up a British supply
ship during a party at Cornwallis' estate, one dim-witted aristocrat
ecstatically exclaims, "Fireworks!"</P>
<P>It is when "The Patriot" concentrates on the war that it finally kicks 
into high gear. Director Roland Emmerich does the movie no favours by 
filming many of the battle scenes with a tedious, mechanical style (close 
up of American soldier, wide shot, close up of British soldier, wide 
shot, repeat), but the realism and intensity of the combat overcomes 
this, especially in the exciting final clash. Every now and then, 
Robert Rodat's script shows a spark of creativity, or at least reuses old 
ideas in entertaining ways -- look at what becomes of Cornwallis' dogs, 
for example. And the beautiful period detail is a major attraction, with 
the whole movie looking as though it was lifted from a Leutze painting.</P>
<P>But "The Patriot" is ultimately a disappointment -- although, given that 
Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin masterminded "Independence Day" and 
the 1998 "Godzilla", two films with the most grotesque 
budget-to-intelligence ratios in recent history, maybe that's actually 
not such a bad thing. This is "Braveheart" lite: great fighting sequences 
trapped in a shallow narrative.</P>
<P>And why, if the movie spans five years, do the Martin children never age 
a day?</P>
