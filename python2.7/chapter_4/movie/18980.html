<PRE>                         LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL 1997
                     A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
      4 out of 5 for a quirky holcaust drama that touches the heart</PRE>
<P>Cast: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Sergio
Bustric, Horst Buchholz.
Screenplay: Robert Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami.
Producers: Elda Ferri and Gianluigi Braschi.
Director: Roberto Benigni</P>
<P>Don't let the following quirks of this review, fool you into believing
that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love. But one
can see the humour of Roberto Benigni when you see that …</P>
<P>Life is beautiful, even though I'm a short, ugly looking man with an
obnoxious laugh. Life is beautiful even though I haven't amounted to
much in life, except working out the finer intricacies of waitering. I'm
a lucky sort of a guy, especially when a beautiful woman strips away my
venner of superficiality to find a new age,sensitive guy with the
biggest heart in the entire world underneath - Life is Beautiful! I'm a
Jew, but Life can still be beautiful. The Nazis put me in a
concentration camp, but Life is still beautiful. I love my son very much
and that's what matters, and that's what makes Life beautiful. My
ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a
concentration camp is somewhat beautiful? I get shot for my efforts and
the woman I love, but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing
- so by Jove don't give me any crap about it!</P>
<P>By far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves
every nomination and award that it has achieved. Well done, there should
be more film directors and actors like you Roberto Benigni.</P>
