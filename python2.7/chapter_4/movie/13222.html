<P>Amidst a rather noisy summer of asteroids, aliens, and masked Mexican
bandits comes this rather unassuming gem about money, love, and mo'
money. Written by Scott Frank (HEAVEN'S PRISONERS) in a quirky,
ultra-hip style and laced with a retro-cool soundtrack, there's more
than enough story and sizzile here to go around for all of the other
summer movies. Marked by one critic to be the only summer film with sex
in it (the closest competitor being THE X-FILES' one half-kiss), the
character love story provides plenty of depth and excitement for an
original concept. </P>
<P>It stars George Clooney (THE PEACEMAKER) as Jack Foley, a notorious but
aging bank robber who gets nailed making a getaway from a stickup. In
the slammer, he uses some Latino friends to make his daring escape,
shortly thereafter reuniting with his best friend Buddy (Ving Rhames,
CON AIR). The only thing that limits the escape from being perfect is
the coincidental presence of a Federal marshal named Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez, U-TURN). From here, the story takes off into Jack and
Buddy's plan to heist a large sum of uncut diamonds from a source they
had heard about in a previous incarceration together. Their characters
are immediately likeable, in the glorified sort of way that most
good-guy bank robbers are; if anything, Jack and Buddy are present day
versions of THE NEWTON BOYS. </P>
<P>The acting is of a superb quality here. George Clooney redeems himself
for his last three films, all of which were stinkers, by giving a
toned-down performance. It works out for the better, as though he's
almost more relaxed in a less flamboyant role. Ving Rhames is similarly
pleasurable, and almost every line he says comes out with some degree of
humor due to his low, gravelly voice and stoic facial expressions.
Jennifer Lopez is sensual as ever, lending an eroticism to the crime
caper story. The other supporting roles are just as solid (Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina, and the stupefying Steve Zahn), and there's even a few
bizarre cameos - Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances
in the middle and end, respectively. </P>
<P>There's no doubt that OUT OF SIGHT will be a hit with genre fans,
although it's questionable as to how large that fan base is. Anyone
who's not in tune with the retro-hipness atmophere that the movie exudes
is going to feel, understandably, that the film is too off-the-wall to
be appreciated. On the other hand, those who are of a PULP FICTION
nature will see a product like this as top-of-the-line material,
something that can't be missed for a true follower. On the whole,
there's nothing that can't be enjoyed, and it may simply be too crass or
crude for some types.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "OUT OF SIGHT": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
