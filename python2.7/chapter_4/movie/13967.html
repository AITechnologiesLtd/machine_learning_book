<PRE>Review:        Mafia</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>Mafia is touted as another in the Naked Gun/Airplane genre.  It tries, but
it doesn't quite make it.  It's a takeoff of the Godfather series, Casino,
Goodfellas, and Forrest Gump!</P>
<P>Jerry Mohr is the lead character, the good  son who is destined to head
the family business.   Lloyd Bridges, in his final film role, plays the
godfather.  He actually seems spryer than his stunt doubles.</P>
<P>The main fun in these parodies is looking for all the little things, such
as a ship named IL Pacino.  Personally, I don't see anything funny about
"Rocks 1_".  I was trying to think of some of the clever things to list
here, but the problem is, I can't remember any.  Oh, yeah, there are
references to O.J.Simpson, Lyle Menandez and other "names".  And there are
some funny sight gags, but in all it is a disappointment.  I had hoped for
more.  The only way that I'd watch this again is if it's on free TV, late
at night, and I can't sleep.</P>
<PRE>I give it a D+.</PRE>
<PRE>See you at the movies.</PRE>
