<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Picture a product assembly line going through the motions day in and day
out and you pretty much have the same definition of a movie formula.
You know what I'm talking about.  A movie that you've seen over and over
again done with a different idea that frankly, it could be conceived by
a journalism student in his first year of study.</P>
<P>'Desperate Measures' was in trouble when the first ads hit the media
comparing it to such films as 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' and for
heaven's sake, 'The Silence of the Lambs'?  Not even close, I'm sorry to
say.  Like all films reviewed, I always keep an open mind because the
talents of Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia are far above average and the
film's director, Barbet Schroeder ('Reversal of Fortune', 'Single White
Female') is pretty good at what he does as well.</P>
<P>There's nothing wrong with using repetition to make a point.  Gene
Siskel (of Siskel & Ebert fame) is always talking about how motion
picture technology is at an all time high while good motion picture
screenplays are at an all time low.  How right he is.  He mentions this
often and speaking for myself, 'Desperate Measures' is just another
example of this.</P>
<P>Set in the beautiful city of San Francisco (I've always wanted to live
there or close by), 'Desperate Measures' stars Michael Keaton as a
convicted killer who has one redeeming quality he doesn't know about.
Upon an illegal infiltration of an FBI database, a San Francisco cop
(Andy Garcia) finds that Keaton is the only hope he has in saving his 9
year old son who has leukemia.  It seems that Keaton is a compatible
donor for a bone marrow transplant that will save the youngster's life
and Garcia is determined in getting Keaton to agree to the procedure.
Keaton refuses at first but has a change of heart later in the film.
Keaton's real motive?  Planning and executing his escape, of course.
His attempt is pretty impressive and the film starts off in a very
promising manner but then the picture hits a brick wall.</P>
<P>It languishes in becoming an action, chase and pursuit picture in the
final process.  However, I hesitate to call 'Desperate Measures' a bad
film.  It isn't.  It is only mildly disappointing because Michael
Keaton's portrait of evil is very impressive and while not always
plausible, the film keeps you watching with constant interest.  I place
this film in the fast food category of motion pictures along with many
other that may at first taste good but aren't good for you.</P>
<P>Andy Garcia has a gritty style of acting well suited in playing the part
of a loving father who will risk his career, his safety and his life to
save his son's life.  Not much chemistry between the two leads but a
good 180 degree portrayal on the part of both actors is worthy of
honorable mention.</P>
<P>Director Barbet Schroeder's interpretation of the script leaves little
room for the director's improvisation, something many directors do quite
well, injecting their own sub text, finale or scenario timed at exactly
the right moment that makes a movie memorable.  David Klass' screenplay
could have used much more creative input from Schroeder, the cast and
other members of the creative process because in the final analysis,
writing is a motion picture's brain.  The director is the heart and this
film has a both of these in medium supply.</P>
