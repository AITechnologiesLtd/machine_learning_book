Susan Granger's review of "TRUE CRIME" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>         Clint Eastwood's an insightful director and an often
underestimated actor but he needs a more believable story to work with
than "True Crime" - along with a more appealing character to
play. He's a cynical, amoral reporter on the Oakland "Tribune" who
can't keep his pants zipped. In the first scene and in the final
scene, he's hitting on 23 year-old girls. In between, he's wallowing
in a muckraking melodrama about a noble black man (Isiah Washington)
who's bravely facing execution on Death Row in San Quentin for killing
a pregnant white convenience store clerk. The guy's obviously not
guilty and Eastwood - who was given the story as a last-minute fill-in
- is determined to prove his innocence within a 12-hour span to get a
reprieve before the warden can administer the lethal injection. It's
far-fetched but he finds exonerating evidence, plus a witness, that
the cops, lawyers, and other reporters haven't unearthed over six
years. Meanwhile, he's boffing the wife of the city editor (Dennis
Leary) and bantering with the editor-in-chief (James Woods). Actually,
the scenes in which Eastwood and Woods trade sardonic zingers are the
best in the film. Several extraneous characters are just irritating -
like a foul-mouthed panhandler and a pontificating prison
minister. There are also the Eastwood family players - remember how he
featured his daughter Alison as a singer in "Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil"?  This time, his former girl-friend, Frances Fisher,
plays an attorney; his current wife, Dina Ruiz, is a TV reporter
(since she is in real-life, it's not a stretch); and his love-child
with Fisher cavorts as his daughter (she's adorable).  On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "True Crime" is a trite, contrived, tedious
4. It's a crime of excess, filled with people with whom you'd never
want to spend one hour, much less two.</P>
