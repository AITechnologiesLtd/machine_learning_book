<P>         Two kinds of movies wind up spending a lot of time on a studio
shelf: pictures that are so offbeat or unusual they give Hollywood's
marketing gurus sleepless nights, or films that are so wretched the
producers are ashamed to let them out.</P>
<P> "The 13th Warrior" has been killing time in the vault at
Touchstone Pictures for two years, and not because it's an unappreciated
work of art. In fact, director John McTiernan reportedly washed his
hands of the movie after run-ins with Michael Crichton, whose novel
"Eaters of the Dead" was the basis for "Warrior," and seeing the
finished product, there's no mystery as to why McTiernan doesn't want to
be associated with it. Some cinematic fiascos at least provide a few
unintentional laughs; "Warrior" is simply a mess.</P>
<P> It does, however, offer the sight of Antonio Banderas (in
eyeliner, no less) struggling to portray an Arab soldier, which must be
one of the most curious casting choices since Demi Moore played a
Puritan. In the proper role, Banderas can be a superb actor, as
evidenced by his films with director Pedro Almodovar, such as "Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!". But
since making a much ballyhooed move to America in the early 1990s,
Banderas has missed more frequently than he's hit. This turkey won't
help balance the scale.</P>
<P> The released version of "Warrior" must have been considerably
shorter than what McTiernan originally intended, since the movie opens
with a hasty narrated sequence explaining how our hero Ahmed (Banderas)
was banished to the northlands after taking a fancy to the caliph's
woman. One might also assume preview audiences were baffled by certain
segments of the film since voice-overs are constantly telling us what's
happening at any given time.</P>
<P> For example, when Ahmed's party is chased by bandits who
suddenly retreat at the sight of a Viking ship, someone cries out "Look!
They are going! They are leaving!" over a shot of the cowards riding
away. Later, Ahmed pulls off the bearskin mask of a fallen enemy and
sees a human face underneath the fur. "It's a man, it's a man, it's a
man," he says, just to make sure we understand.</P>
<P>At the same time, the screenplay by William Wisher and Warren
Lewis does a pitiful job of establishing any sort of credibility in the
basic situation or of creating any characters worth paying attention to.
When Ahmed and his new Norsemen pals decide to take on the "terror that
has no name," a band of cannibalistic underground dwellers who are
terrorizing a settlement, no one is likely to care whether or not they
succeed. The good guys seem almost as uncouth and unappealing as the
flesh-eaters.</P>
<P> The meant-to-be-rousing battles in "Warrior" are constantly
sabotaged by having been shot in medium close-up (so that we can't see
much of anything except torsos) with a hand-held camera that always
seems to miss the real action. Though a lot of heads and limbs go flying
in the course of the film, the fights are so chaotic and murky even the
gore is a bore. James Sanford</P>
