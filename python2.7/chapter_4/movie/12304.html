<P>Depending on your preference, critics have debated for quite awhile now
on what exactly Spike Lee's masterpiece is.  Perhaps he hasn't made it
yet but in my opinion he has.  It is without a doubt 1989's 'Do the
Right Thing'.  As much as I admired 'Malcolm X' from 1992, I found it to
be too long, too preachy and a film not to be understood by everyone but
it is still a landmark film from a historical perspective.  'Do the
Right Thing' was one of the best films from 1989 and should have
received a Best Picture nomination in place of the manipulative 'Dead
Poet's Society' and 'Do the Right Thing' is on the American Film
Institute's list as a nominee to be included as one of the top 100
movies in the first century of film (1896-1996).  The honor is scheduled
to be held sometime in June.</P>
<P>'Do the Right Thing', 'Malcolm X' and Lee's 1996 sleeper 'Get on the
Bus' all made my top 10 list in their respective years and another
stellar effort as writer and director is put forward by Lee in 'He Got
Game'.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington is Jake Shuttlesworth, a convict in Attica's maximum
security penitentiary, serving what is believed to be a 21 year sentence
after being convicted of murder in the accidental death of his wife in a
domestic dispute involving their young son, Jesus.  Yes, that is their
son's name, Jesus, pronounced the same way as the biblical figure but
Jesus is actually named after another basketball player with the same
name.  After a unique opening showing slow motion basketball drills by
young people all over the United States, the story opens at Attica where
the warden (Ned Beatty), has a meeting with Jake.  He tells Jake that
his son Jesus is the number one prospect in the entire U.S. and that if
Jake can convince his son to play basketball at the governor's old
school, that an early release for Jake may be possible.  Jake has served
six years and tells the warden he has 15 left.  Jake agrees and is
escorted by two state chaperones who keep tabs on Jake using an
electronically monitored homing device strapped to his ankle and rules
of protocol are strictly enforced in contacting them while he is out of
the slammer.  Jake then meets with his son after his daughter takes him
back home.  The son is played by real NBA player Ray Allen who does a
good job but who shouldn't quit his day job.</P>
<P>What struck me as being overtly professional is the way the film doesn't
try to throw too much at the audience and overwhelm them with all the
trappings of college life.  The seduction of money, cars, women and
other forms of pampering are not overbearing in the film as Lee makes
his point and then moves to another scene before we, the audience, can
get too angry at the degrading lengths to which schools will go to
secure a player and possibly destroy them with underhanded corruption.
Is there any other kind?  Also, Lee makes certain that the father/son
relationship never comes to a complete formation from a sentimental
stand point and this is an admirable quality which keeps the film from
becoming pretentious.  Be forewarned that 'He Got Game' is extremely
adult oriented and really isn't a film you can take your mother to see.
Regardless of that, it works as social commentary, entertainment and is
a film that makes its high moments believable and at times tragic.  It
maintains a smooth and even flow from start to finish.</P>
