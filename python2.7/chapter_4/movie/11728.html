<P>³Das Boot² (Director¹s Cut)
West German, 1981 - In German with English subtitles
210 minutes (3 hours 30 minutes)
Rated R (for language,  brief nudity, and mild violence)
Director: Wolfgang Petersen
Writer: Wolfgang Petersen (based on Lothar-Guenther Buchheim¹s novel)
Cast:     Jurgen Prochnow (Captain) - Herbert Gronemeyer (Correspondent Werner)
     Klaus Wennemann (Cheif) - Hubertus Bengsch (1st Lieutenant)</P>
<P>     ³Das Boot² is a thrilling war film about a German U-boat during the
last stages of World War II.  The painstaking life of a young,
inexperienced crew aboard a tiny submarine is presented expertly by
director Wolfgang Petersen (In The Line of Fire, Air Force One).  From
merry banter and numbing boredom, to incredible excitement and total panic,
all of the emotions of what it must¹ve been like to be cramped up in one of
those small submarines is thoroughly explored.</P>
<P>     The plot is rather straight-forward.  A war-weary captain (Prochnow)
leads his fresh crew on a dangerous sea mission that could be their last. 
The captain has little faith in his Nazi superiors and seems to follow
their orders simply for the old thrill of the action, rather than the
ideology of the war.  This is obvious in many early scenes where he is seen
frowning at his 1st Lieutenant¹s (Bengsch) stiff, Nazi protocol.</P>
<P>     A naive naval correspondent named Werner (Gronemeyer) provides a
central character to the story, and we see the events unfold from his point
of view.  From the opening scenes of a night-before party with drunken
officers, to the terrifying danger of later undersea dogfights, it is
through Werner¹s eyes that we gauge the effects of the war.</P>
<P>     The fact that the setting is a German submarine (instead of a British
or American boat) is one of the interesting things about the film.  When
all is said and done, you realize that it doesn¹t matter what country is
fighting for what cause, these are all young men going off to a strange
land (or sea) to fight, and very likely die.  To these men it seems nothing
more than a job, not a profound purpose, that drives them to survive.  At
least that¹s the way it¹s looked at in this film.</P>
<P>     The battle scenes are as intense as they come; ³The Hunt for Red
October¹s² got nothing on this.  Mainly because of the technology of World
War II submarines, it was much easier to get killed than to survive.  It
makes all the more effective those long, silent pauses of waiting and
floating in the blackness of sea, waiting to see if that British Destroyer
is coming back around to drop a depth charge.  But the captain is amazed at
the durability of his U-boat, and seems hungry to test it again and again.</P>
<P>     ³Das Boot² works on just about every level.  The acting is top-notch
across the board, even in the smaller roles like Klaus Wennemann as the
Chief Engineer.  The undubbed director¹s cut is really the only way to see
the film.  The subtitles are done fairly well and the German language lends
a special significance when the young German soldiers are heard singing a
British song; this effect would be lost if the film were seen entirely in
English.  </P>
<P>     Jost Vacano¹s cinematography is also magnificent.  This is one of the
most skillfully photographed films you will ever see.  How the camera moves
so smoothly and captures all that it does in a 10 by 150 foot submarine is
a mystery to me.  How it makes it so aesthetically pleasing in that
environment is an even bigger mystery.  If there is a flaw to this film
it¹s the music.  The composition is adequate and it¹s used well, but I felt
that real strings would¹ve added so much more than synthesizers imitating
real strings. Although music can augment a film so profoundly, it doesn¹t
take away too much here.  At any rate, it¹s a tiny flaw in a giant
masterpiece.</P>
