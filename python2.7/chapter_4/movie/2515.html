<P>     SERIAL MOM is a failed satire that isn't especially amusing.  From
director John Waters, whose list of credits (including POLYESTER,
HAIRSPRAY, and CRYBABY) are decidedly non-mainstream, this is an
attempt to savage the perfect American family by revealing some
unsavory truths about Mom.  While the idea sounds fertile, the
execution is uneven, and the laugh-provoking comedy sporadic at best.</P>
<P>     When you're around Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner), you'd better
watch what you say and do.  An ill-advised word about her dentist
husband (Sam Waterston) could get you a knife in the belly.  Failure to
rewind a rented video tape is a no-no, as is making derogatory remarks
about the movie-watching habits of her son (Matthew Lillard).  Don't
even consider standing up her daughter (Ricki Lake) on a date.  And
whatever happens, don't wear white shoes after Labor Day.  You see,
even though Beverly is the June Cleaver sort of mother on the surface,
scratch a little deeper and you'll discover a cold-blooded, calculating
murderess.</P>
<P>     One of the film's major flaws is its handling of the main
premise.  SERIAL MOM self-consciously and clumsily establishes
Beverly's homicidal tendencies.  Too little time and effort is spent
setting her up as a representation of the middle-class ideal, and the
early parodies of suburbia (a ripe enough target) are poorly-realized,
not to mention lacking in originality.  For the revelations about
Beverly to cause more than a momentary smirk, the set up has to be
stronger.</P>
<P>     There are exceptions, of course, but most of the humor in SERIAL
MOM is too forced to be funny.  To its detriment, the movie keeps
trying, but the jokes rarely click, and Turner's performance is a
little too automated to be effective.  Even in parodies, it's necessary
to have some character identification.  Here, there is none.</P>
<P>     The best part comes during the last twenty minutes, when the
film's observations on society's love of scandal and violence are
scathingly on-target.  In this case, Waters' vision is perfect, and
the result is the only worthwhile portion of an otherwise-dreary
movie.</P>
<P>     Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, and Matthew Lillard are solid in
supporting roles.  Director Waters has peppered the movie with an
interesting slate of cameos, including Traci Lords, Suzanne Somers, and
Patricia Hearst.</P>
<P>     Regardless of how good SERIAL MOM's concept sounds in print (and
how delightfully-offbeat the previews and TV ads look), the resultant
product is disjointed and disappointing.  It's easy to forgive faults
in a picture like this if it delivers enough laughs or presents
something inventive, but neither of those qualities is in evidence.
Ultimately, SERIAL MOM is deserving of the same fate as any of
Beverly's victims: a quick death.</P>
