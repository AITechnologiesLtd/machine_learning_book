<PRE>                                  SOAPDISH
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     SOAPDISH was sneaked here last night.  It's a very sharp satire of
soap operas.  If you need a silly movie and just want to laugh for 90
minutes, you can't do much better than SOAPDISH.  I hadn't laughed so
much at a movie in a long time.</P>
<P>     In SOAPDISH, Sally Field plays an hyperactive, aging ingenue,
Whoopi Goldberg reprises her wise woman from Ghost, Robert Downey Jr.
plays a young producer torn in about fifteen different directions, and
Cathy Moriarty steals the show as Montana, a vixenish actress who plays
a nurse.  Garry Marshall (normally the director of movies like Pretty
Woman) does an amusing turn as "the man from upstairs," the network
executive in charge of daytime programming.  There are lots of surprises
in this movie, and probably most of them don't hold up to much scrutiny,
but what-the-hell.  The movie goes to truly ridiculous lengths about how
silly soaps are, and how neurotic most people involved with soaps are.
You may need to have been a soap fan at one point in your life to truly
appreciate this movie, but I suspect if you liked the soap opera stuff
in TOOTSIE, you'll enjoy SOAPDISH.</P>
<PRE>     This movie is also a 7 on the Chuck scale.</PRE>
