<P>I am a movie critic; that much is obvious. But moreso, I consider
myself a movie lover.  Sometimes, in an awful movie, my friends will
beg me to leave the theatre halfway through the film. But I always
stay, hoping that a good ending can save the otherwise horrible
movie. But two-thirds of the way through the painfully bad The Mummy,
I realized there was no hope, and my more-than-willing friend and I
left the theatre then and there.</P>
<P>We walked through the campus of UCLA at midnight, and talked to the
fans waiting in line to get tickets to the new "Star Wars" movie. We
watched "L.A. Confidential" with them and waited for a cab. When we
got in the cab, the driver asked, "So, what did you do tonight?"  "We
saw a bad movie," I answered.  "The Mummy?" he asked. He explained
that the night before he had driven home people who felt as if they
witnessed a disaster by watching the movie. Enough said.</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser, whom I was just beginning to like, stars as Rick
O'Connell, a foreign soldier fighting in 1920's Egypt. He is fighting
for the lost city of Hammenabtra, known as the city of the dead. Many
years before, a man (Arnold Vosloo) had been mummified with a powerful
curse that would infect anyone who came into contact with him.</P>
<P>Anyway, Rick, a librarian named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her
brother (John Hannah), go back to Hammenabtra to find ancient artifacts
worth millions. What they end up doing is waking the mummy, and trying
to stop him.</P>
<P>Going through all the problems of The Mummy would waste a lot of
precious time, so I'll just point out something that really pissed me
off. Director Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) calls his film a "sweeping,
desert epic", and he is so visually derivative of The English Patient
in a couple scenes that I almost wanted to scream. If only Sommers
could have made his plot and characters a litle bit more like the
characters in The English Patient...</P>
<P>Universal Pictures is supposedly in need of a hit after notable flops
like Babe: Pig In The City, Meet Joe Black, and EdTV, but I think that
bad word of mouth will cut The Mummy off after a large opening
weekend. The film should do little to hamper Brendan Fraser's rising
stardom, but I'd like to see him choose more good roles like Gods and
Monsters or School Ties.</P>
<P>I feel as if I've wasted to much time on this review when I only need
to prove one point: The Mummy is crap on a reel.</P>
