<P>Varsity Blues is neither a good film nor a bad one, but rather a 
mediocre production that had the potential to be far better, but could 
have slipped even lower as well. In some areas it was masterful, and 
other were equivalently pathetic to put it frankly. The outcome is 
interesting, odd and unique, but not necessarily worth the trip unless 
you are a teenage James Van Der Beek heartthrob or have some other 
obsession with one of the cult aspects of this film.</P>
<P>In a small town in Texas high school football is a way of life. It is 
the heritage, it is the society, and it is the community's favorite 
topic. Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) has coached the high school squad since 
his current team's parents were playing. Over that time he has brought 
home 2 state titles and 22 division titles. Grasped by immortality, he 
can do no wrong.</P>
<P>Leading this year's squad is quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) and 
lineman Billy Bob, (Ron Lester) who, as you can figure out early on, is 
a stereotype right out of a Jeff Foxworthy book. Then, as only Hollywood 
would have it, through corruption, illegal drinking, and a whole lot of 
other stuff that ATF doesn't like, Billy Bob misses a block and Lance 
goes down. Of course, this is where our hero enters. Jonathan Moxon 
seems about as perfect you can get, a scholarship to Brown, a great 
girlfriend, and a steady life. But all that must change when he becomes 
the starting quarterback of a football team that is a way of life.</P>
<P>Varsity Blues tries to explore several proven aspects of film making by 
putting them all together into one film. Parts of the film resemble such 
child favorites as Angels in the Outfield and others with a fairy tale 
plot and overly predictable ending. But much of the film is about sex, 
drinking, and life in strip bars; thus making it a far cry from kiddy 
material. I suppose the goal is to settle on a teenage audience 
somewhere in-between, but I have reservations as to just how anyone 
could sit through these 90 minutes of contrast and be truly entertained. </P>
<P>One saving grace, however, is the acting. Jon Voight is absolutely 
stellar and offers a reminder to the world that he is one of the most 
underrated actors in Hollywood. In his freshman performance, James Van 
Der Beek is great as well. He seems to step beyond the typical teenage 
role and gives his part some meaning that few others could add to the 
film. And most of the supporting cast fairs well also, but nothing 
brilliant will come out of a bunch people playing drunk high school 
students.</P>
<P>Overall, this film does have it's moments of glory, but they are matched 
with shame. The plot isn't very original, but the combination of plots 
within is an unprecedented theory. However, I get the feeling that there 
is a good reason why no one had dared to do so before: it just doesn't 
work. So, although I tip my cap to the acting, I just don't see a 
quality film here.</P>
