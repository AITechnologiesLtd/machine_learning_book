<PRE>"The Mummy Returns" </PRE>
<P>It has been eight years since our favorite legionnaire Rick O'Connell 
(Brendan Fraser) and beautiful Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) battled 
against a 3000-year old nemesis named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo.) Now, it's 
1933 and deep within the bowels of the British Museum of London an ancient 
terror is about to be released on the unsuspecting world in "The Mummy 
Returns." </P>
<P>When "The Mummy," loosely based on the 1932 classic starring Boris Karloff, 
opened in 1999 it was to record breaking box office numbers. Eventually 
racking up over $400-mil worldwide, it is the 31st highest grossing film, 
ever. So, you didn't expect a sequel? </P>
<P>And, quite a sequel it is. Writer/director Stephen Sommers paid close 
attention to what worked and didn't in the first flick and honed it into a 
well-paced, sometimes funny, sometimes exciting, and always good looking, 
action adventure tale. </P>
<P>Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz get the chance to develop, more fully, 
their characters from the '99 film. Rick O'Connell used to be an 
independent-minded adventurer who only had himself to care about. Now, he's 
a husband and a father and has a whole new set of responsibilities, but he 
still has the heart and soul of a swashbuckler. Fraser melds the two sides 
of Rick together with a skill and charm that I've grown to appreciate in 
the actor. Rachel Weisz gets to be an action heroine a la "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon," as she goes toe-to-toe with her old nemesis, Anck-Su-Namun 
(Patricia Velasquez). Weisz handles the action stuff well and plays Evelyn 
as smart, capable and every bit as venturesome as Rick. </P>
<P>There are other familiar faces from the first film with Arnold Vosloo 
reprising his role as the ferocious Imhotep, who wants to take over the 
world and still has the hots for Anck-Su-Namun. Oded Fehr is, once again, 
the stoic Ardeth Bay, a proud member of the Medjai, defender of the 
righteous and enemy of Imhotep. Both characters are more symbol than 
anything else. John Hannah is back as Evelyn's sniveling, high-maintenance 
brother Jonathan. </P>
<P>Some new faces show up, too, with young Freddie Boath playing Rick and 
Evelyn's son, Alex. At first, the kid comes across as too cute. Oh, boy, I 
thought, another pretty, precocious child actor. But, Boath hangs in there 
and, as the story progresses, you begin to like the boy. Comic relief is 
provided on a couple of fronts with the evil Lock-Nah (Adewale 
Akinnuoye-Agbaje) determined to personally kill Alex and thwarted, by the 
boy, every time. Shaun Parkes provides both comedy and heroism as the owner 
of Magic Carpet Airways, a company that eschews conventional airplanes in 
favor of Izzy's homemade "dirigible." WWF champion Dwayne "The Rock" 
Johnson makes his "acting" debut as the Scorpion King who sold his soul to 
Anubis, but the incredible physical presence of the wrestling star is 
really relegated to special effects in the big finale. </P>
<P>Of course, the reason most of us want to see "The Mummy Returns" is for the 
anticipated kick-ass F/X and they are in ample quantity here. The 
computer-generated images are used throughout, from the big battle scenes 
with a cast of thousands of CG creatures, like the dog-headed warriors of 
the dark lord, Anubis. There are lots of killer mummy effects, including 
hundreds of pygmy mummies that decimate the numbers of the bad guys. These 
little fellers have a distinctly spooky quality about them. </P>
<P>The production is lavishly handled on all accounts. Veteran lenser Adrian 
Biddle gives the same quality look to the film that he provided for the 
first. When the action shifts from Egypt to London, the colors change from 
golden, warm hues to dark, colder colors. Costume and production 
effectively capture the 30's period details. There is a goodly influence 
from such groundbreaking adventures as "Raiders of the Lost Ark," 
"Gremlins" and "Around the World in 80 Days." </P>
<P>"The Mummy Returns" is a full 2+ hours long but is so evenly paced and well 
told that you don't even notice the time. It's fun and full of adventure 
and has enough F/X to satisfy the most jaded action fan. I give it a B. </P>
