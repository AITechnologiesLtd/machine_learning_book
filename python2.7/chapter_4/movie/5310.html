<PRE>                          THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is a western starring Sharon 
Stone and Gene Hackman. Should've been called THE NUDE AND 
THE OLD. That last sentence, of course, is an example of the dangers 
of insensitive stereotyping, because we now know Stone actually 
can carry a film without taking her shirt off and Hackman, of course, 
has always been able to carry films fully-clothed (thankfully). This 
movie is a decent showcase for both of them as well as WHAT'S 
EATING GILBERT GRAPE star Leonardo DeCaprio.</P>
<P>        What the movie isn't a decent showcase for is good directing. 
Every "high noon" cliche in the book is brought out for THE QUICK 
AND THE DEAD, including rapid-fire closeups of all the characters 
and recurring shots of the town clock. (I'm also sure I saw a 
tumbleweed blow by on more than one occasion.) The writing 
also isn't the best, as when tough cowboy -- make that 
cowperson -- Sharon Stone arrives in town and is hit on by 
a tough guy:</P>
<PRE>        TOUGH GUY: You're purty.
        SHARON: You're not.
        TOUGH GUY: I need a woman.
        SHARON: You n, Sharon. Here's another 
exchange, coming about one minute after the "bath" sequence, 
when Sharon is talking to the shoe shine boy.</PRE>
<PRE>        SHOE SHINE BOY (pointing to Hackman): See him? 
He gets fifty cents of every dollar in this town.
        SHARON: And what does the town get?
        SHOE SHINE BOY: It gets to live.</PRE>
<P>        And we get to laugh at the ludicrous dialogue. Another 
area of fault is the plot. The nature of the premise dictates a thin, 
predictable plot. Even the "twist"of the ending you can see riding 
into town a mile away. The plot has a group of gunfighters entering 
a contest, where people square off in gunfighting competitions one 
by one, until only one is left alive to collect the $123,456 prize. We 
know from the get-go who the last two contestants will be, and 
even who the last four will be. Still, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD 
for the most part contains original entertainment from time-tested 
(and tit-tested) Hollywood performers.</P>
