<PRE>                              DANGEROUS MINDS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The Movie Critic at LARGE in me found a lot wrong with 
this movie, but the idiot moviegoer in me liked it anyway. It was 
predictable, shallow and uneven, but I like that Michelle Pfeiffer, even 
if she was horribly miscast in the role of a tough teacher who wins 
over a class of gangstas. DANGEROUS MINDS never goes into the 
deep, poignant drama you'd expect, but instead has a lot of humorous 
and manufactured "touching" moments, which the idiot moviegoer fell 
for hook, line and sinker.</P>
<P>        Michelle Pfeiffer arrives for her new job teaching an English 
class for "special" students to find out they're not the geniuses she 
hoped they'd be but rather the exact same class from SISTER ACT 2 
(Or didn't you notice?) of aspiring rappers, pregnant girls and sleepers, 
a real public high school cross-section.</P>
<P>        Still, she determines to make them learn by taking them all to 
the amusement park (What better place to learn about Shakespeare, 
right? "Forsooth! Methinks I see The Nauseator up ahead forwith. I 
will tame the savage beast or spew out chasms of chunder for a 
fortnight in the attempt! Zounds!") and giving out candy bars to 
students with correct answers. No teacher I've ever had has gone that 
far to encourage learning, although my third grade teacher used to buy 
those packages of stale wafer-thin butter cookies that come in boxes of 
300 and sit in the factory until all hint of freshness and taste is sucked 
out, then sit on the supermarket shelf another few months and years 
until some woman on a teacher's salary comes in and decides she's 
gonna get her kids to learn even if it means spending that 99 cents on 
the 300 cookies. And it worked because, hey, we were kids, what did 
we know?</P>
<P>        So slowly Pfeiffer's students warm up to the bribes and get 
high on learning (higher learning, right? Wrong! Different movie!), as 
we all knew they would. And then, about three-fourths of the way 
through, when it seems like all is going right for Michelle and her 
young charges, we get the age-old contrived conflict, just as we knew 
we would. Here, one of the students is needlessly axed just to further 
the plot and teach a valuable lesson--always remember to knock. If 
you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. If you 
haven't, that leaves the other option.</P>
<P>        Surely from reading this review, you see the myriad flaws 
both with DANGEROUS MINDS and my writing (I'm asking you to 
ignore the flaws in the writing.), but perhaps you'll see the movie 
anyway and fall prey, as I did, to the false sentiment and manufactured 
poignancy. I saw right through many other recent bad dramas along 
these lines (WITH HONORS, THE PROFESSIONAL) but 
DANGEROUS MINDS somehow got to me. I guess it's dangerous to 
let a movie like that get into your mind, but oh well.</P>
