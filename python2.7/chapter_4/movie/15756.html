<P>Some people feel the need to do something more than once (i.e. Gus Van Sant
with Psycho).  Some people feel the need to re-unite actors (i.e. Edward
Burns). Some people feel the need to re-hash a plot (take your pick of any
number of movies).  But only a select few can pull it off.
Nora Ephron, Tom Hanks, and Meg Ryan have graduated into that select cadre
with You've Got Mail.
The plot is a carbon-copy of Sleepless in Seattle, their earlier
collaboration: a man and a woman are completely in love with one another
without ever having direct contact in a romantic sense.  In Sleepless in
Seattle, it was a radio broadcast late at night that turned Meg Ryan on to
Tom Hanks.  In You've Got Mail, we have fully entered the electronic world
and this time the two meet in an AOL over 30 chatroom.  The two of them
begin corresponding via the electronic medium while hashing it out in real
life.  Tom Hanks is Joe Fox, book mogul and owner of the new Fox Books
superstore in the Upper West Side.  Meg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly, your average
Upper West Side indepdent bookstore owner challenging the conglomerates
springing up around her.
If you've seen Sleepless in Seattle, you already know where this will end
up.  In fact, it ends up just about where every other one of these romantic
comedies ends up: the boy gets the girl.  Along the way there's the radical
difference (and the differences, I remind you, are all that matter
nowadays), that the two people in love are fully using the electronic
medium: not to mention committing Internet infidelity at the same time (Tom
Hanks cheating on Parker Posey, Meg Ryan cheating on Greg Kinnear).  If that
wasn't enough to make it different, this one adds in the nice aspect of
character development.
All of us who care -- smart people, movie critics, patrons of romances
rather than action films -- will be much more pleased that we finally see a
movie where the characters are cared about and not you equation romances.
We can actually fall in love along with them.  In this aspect, because of
the fact that the two main characters are seen both inside and outside of
the context of their romance, it actually far surpasses Sleepless in
Seattle, which, to be honest, was somewhat lacking.
So, all you romantic comedy fans, go ahead and stop by the local multiplex
and get your mail.  You may just be surprised what it says.</P>
