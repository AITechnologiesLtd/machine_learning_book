<P>     Pity poor Eliza (Hope Davis).  On the surface, her family seems 
normal.  She lives with her husband, Luis (Stanley Tucci), in a nice, 
Long Island home only a short distance from her parents' house.  Under 
that roof are her mom, Rita (Anne Meara), dad, Jim (Pat McNamara), 
sister, Jo (Parker Posey), and her sister's SO, Carl (Liev Schreiber).  
When Eliza discovers incriminating evidence indicating that Luis could 
be cheating on her, she is bundled into the car by the rest of her 
family for a sleuthing day trip to New York City.  By the time night 
falls, Eliza will probably wish she had stayed in bed.</P>
<P>     THE DAYTRIPPERS, from first time director Greg Mattola, starts out 
as a droll comedy about a group of oddball characters forced by 
circumstances to spend a day together, but finishes as a slightly 
overbearing drama about relationships in crisis.  The change in tone 
from playful to somber, which takes place about three-quarters of the 
way through, is jarring.  The melodrama that follows, while adequate to 
wrap up the story, isn't nearly as effective as the offbeat comedy that 
persists for most of the running length.</P>
<P>     Leaving out the final act, which includes a lot of bickering, 
anger, and one "shocking" revelation, THE DAYTRIPPERS satirizes a 
suburban family's trip into a big city.  Of course, they're there on a 
mission -- to spy on Eliza's husband.  They hang around outside the 
possible address of his mistress, waiting.  When he finally appears and 
jumps in a cab, the chase is on.  Unfortunately, a red light immediately 
intervenes, resulting in "the world's shortest car chase."  Undaunted, 
however, Rita leaps out of the car to follow her son-in-law on foot, or, 
as Jo puts it, "My mom suddenly turns into Wesley Snipes."  </P>
<P>     Of course, it's not all fun and games.  There are hidden tensions 
in the various relationships, many of which eventually spill into the 
open.  The problem with THE DAYTRIPPERS is that, once the drama shifts 
into high gear, Mattola forgets about the lighter side of things.  More 
humor in the final twenty minutes would have made the climactic 
sequences fit better with the rest of the film.</P>
<P>     The actors all do fine jobs.  Hope Davis, who bears a striking 
resemblance to the better-known Julie Delpy, shows aptitude for both 
comedy and drama.  Anne Meara, unsurprisingly, is much better at the 
former than the latter.  Parker Posey (PARTY GIRL) is delightful as the 
impish Jo, and Liev Schreiber is effective as her put-upon boyfriend.  
Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott have smaller roles.</P>
<P>     THE DAYTRIPPERS is at its best using parody to paint an incisively 
humorous picture of a modern American family.  We see here just how 
dysfunctional the typical nuclear family can be, and that "family 
values" aren't always the solution.  Even though THE DAYTRIPPERS is 
played primarily for laughs, there's a lot of truth lurking beneath the 
comic exterior.  The message comes across to anyone who wants to listen:  
preserving the family is about fostering communication, not mouthing 
platitudes.  Unfortunately, that's something that the film makers 
understand far better than most politicians.</P>
