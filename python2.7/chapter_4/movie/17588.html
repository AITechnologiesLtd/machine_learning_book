<P>As a viewer who is intensely devoted to the sci-fi/action genre of
film, it's difficult for me to separate myself from the genre to write a
review from a purely objective standpoint.  It's also hard when the film
is as astonishingly good as The Matrix.  The problem in this case is
that the film, which has been written and directed by the Wachowski
brothers (Bound), is a marvel in just about every way a film like this
can be.  Where do I begin?  Do I start by praising the truly amazing
visual image that the Wachowskis have brought to the screen?  Should I
first mention the story, which pays homage to numerous other stories
while still managing to create its own world?  Do I rave about the
characters and the dialogue?  </P>
<P>A frequent complaint about films like this is that they're all vacuous
eye candy.  The Matrix is pretty, but it's not vacuous:  in addition to
having made one of the most visually stunning pictures of all time (yes,
of all time), the Wachowskis have created a story that matches those
visuals in every way.  It's not a lopsided production like so many
action thrillers tend to be.  No, The Matrix is a thriller with a heart,
a science fiction epic with real people and conflicts at the center of
it.  True, it has the feel and posture of a comic book, but that's not a
bad thing:  The Matrix takes a familiar formula and builds upon it,
resulting in an exhilarating and invigorating cinematic experience. 
It's also the first movie I've ever watched that made me want to fasten
an imaginary seatbelt.</P>
<P>Another problem with writing this review is that I really can't say
anything specific about the film.  Part of the experience comes from
seeing it with your own eyes.  I can't accurately convey what I've seen
in words.  So I'll begin with the premise:  Keanu Reeves plays Tom
Anderson, a computer programmer by day, and a computer hacker by night
(his hacker alias is Neo, and he's mostly referred to as such).  Towards
the opening of the film, Neo is contacted by a strange woman named
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Trinity piques Neo's interest by mentioning
the Matrix.  "What is the Matrix?" he asks.  She says that the answer
lies with Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  Neo meets Morpheus, and the
journey into his question ensues.</P>
<P>All of this takes about twenty minutes.  The film goes on for two more
hours, but I can't tell you what happens.  All I can say is that when
Neo sees the Matrix, he vomits.  I can't even discuss the other
characters in the film and why they're significant, just because doing
so would give away crucial elements.  One of the things I liked most
about The Matrix is that, before seeing it, I thought I had it figured
out.  But the Wachowskis showed me things that I didn't imagine.  The
story has all the necessary elements for success.  Neo, for instance, is
a likable main character.  He has no personal history, but that's the
point of the film.  Reeves, though inappropriate in any production of
Shakespeare, is more than adequate here.  There's not a moment during
which he doesn't look woefully confused, and that's exactly what this
character needs.</P>
<P>The film is also saturated with colorful supporting characters. 
Fishburne and Moss make a strong pair of protagonists; Fishburne
effortlessly makes every word sound very important, while Moss is strong
as the female lead.  Character actor Joe Pantoliano has a juicy role as
Cipher, one of Morpheus' sidekicks.  Australian actor Hugo Weaving gives
a scene-stealing performance as Agent Smith, one of the antagonists
whose intentions are part of the big secret.  All of these great
characters are placed at the center of a familiar formula.  The
originality comes in the details, which the Wachowskis have worked out
with amazing precision:  I dare any viewer to find a significant plot
hole in The Matrix.  If you do, then you're too picky.  The film works
because the story will hold your interest into and beyond the action
scenes.</P>
<P>Honestly, though, you're going to be concentrating on those action
scenes when they're going.  I've never seen cinematography or special
effects like this; I've never seen such flawless use of slow-motion and
computer-generated images.  The Wachowskis have a better eye for a shot
than nearly any modern director I can think of.  Their crowning
achievement is in the last thirty minutes, and involves a helicopter and
a lot of bullets in slow-motion.  I'm going to go out on a limb here: 
this is the best action sequence ever committed to celluloid.  When it
was over, my heart was racing and I was short of breath.  And I'm not
exaggerating.  If The Matrix doesn't get your attention, then you need
your pulse checked.</P>
<P>The film isn't perfect; the main characters are often forced to kill a
lot of people, and I would have liked to see them address the moral
issues behind mass murder.  And some of the background information
reminded me a little too much of similar films.  I only mention these
things to prove that I am capable of looking at the film objectively. 
It's not likely that they'll hinder anyone's enjoyment of the picture.</P>
<P>So, here's a pop quiz for anyone planning to create an entry into the
sci-fi genre:  What's more important -- style or substance?  The
Wachowskis have created perhaps the best science fiction film of the
90s, and they did so by balancing style and substance.  Like all the
great films of the genre -- including Metropolis, 2001:  A Space
Odyssey, and The Terminator -- The Matrix will show you images you've
never seen before, and it will make you care by telling a good story. 
You don't have to be a sci-fi junkie to recognize the skill here.  The
Matrix is the kind of film that gives fans of the genre a burst of
hope:  there are still filmmakers out there who know how to use special
effects to tell a story.   </P>
