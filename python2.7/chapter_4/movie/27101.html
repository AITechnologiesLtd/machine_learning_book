VERTICAL LIMIT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>For viewers who think movies should be more like plotless IMAX films, 
director Martin Campbell provides a feast for your eyes in the 35mm 
motion picture, VERTICAL LIMIT.  Your brain will likely feel starved, 
but your thumbs will get lots of exercise as you twiddle them waiting 
for the inevitable disaster to strike so that the story can finally get 
some traction.  </P>
<P>The producers should get their money back from writers Robert King 
(CUTTHROAT ISLAND) and Terry Hayes (PAYBACK) since the script is 
laughably weak.  Characters are killed off before we ever get to know 
them enough to care about their demise.  Their rapid deaths, of course, 
are done so that we can have as many dramatic incidents as possible.  
You don't go "wow" during an IMAX film for the dialog.  You do so when 
the IMAX movie makes you experience some vicarious moment of terror.  
Easily, the most ridiculous part of VERTICAL LIMIT is the proclivity of 
the characters to die for the greater good.  For most people, the idea 
of suicide as a way to help someone else isn't something they could do 
easily or ever.</P>
<P>After an opening reminiscent of the opening sequence of MISSION: 
IMPOSSIBLE II, the movie cuts to 3 years later when Peter and Annie 
Garrett (Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney), brother and sister climbers, 
are in the Himalayas.  Except for their displays of physical strength, 
neither O'Donnell nor Tunney gives much to their parts.  This isn't a 
movie that stands up to much logical examination.  Several of the film's 
sequences, while impressive, appear quite impossible.</P>
<P>The only real acting of any merit in the movie comes from Scott Glenn, 
as toeless, recluse Montgomery Wick.  Labeled a "lunatic" by some, Wick 
has spent the last four years climbing K2 alone, while looking for the 
body of his dead wife.  Wick is the only climber in the story who can 
scale K2's extreme heights without ever being out of breath.  
Surprisingly, only once does any climber, certainly not the 
indefatigable Wick, resort to using bottled oxygen.</P>
<P>Bill Paxton, as Elliot Vaughn, plays a megalomaniac, clearly patterned 
after Richard Branson of the Virgin Atlantic fortune.  One assumes, 
however, that Branson would not be willing to kill people in his search 
for thrills and for his own greater glory.  Although Paxton appears to 
be having fun, he delivers one of his weakest performances.  </P>
<P>After hosting "the highest party in the world," Elliot is off on an 
assault on K2 with Annie as a member of his team.  The party looks like 
a drinking scene from a generic teen comedy.  Gosh, isn't mountain 
climbing fun?  The story even includes a pair of Australian stoner dude 
brothers, who like to sun themselves in the buff, but who are really 
K2-capable climbers.  </P>
<P>Peter, deciding that Elliot has chosen the wrong time of day to begin 
the climb, asks Annie, "What does the mountain say?"  It's that kind of 
script.</P>
<P>My personal favorite among the many ridiculous aspects of the movie is 
its ability to telegraph key twists with absolute precision.  Carefully 
choosing a day in which their bank of computers has determined that it 
is 82% likely to have good weather, Elliot and company start their climb 
in glorious sunshine.  Without any computers whatsoever, exactly what do 
you calculate would be the chance that a storm will come out of nowhere?  
100%?</P>
<P>With its sweeping music and sometimes stunning cinematography, the film 
does have its rewards.  But if you're looking solely for visual thrills, 
go for a real IMAX film, not an ersatz substitute.</P>
<P>VERTICAL LIMIT runs a long 2:06.  It is rated PG-13 for intense 
life/death situations and brief strong language and would be fine for 
kids around 12 and up.</P>
