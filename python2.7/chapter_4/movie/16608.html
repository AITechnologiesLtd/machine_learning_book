A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Mark Tarlov</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Judith Roberts</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients: Love, magic food</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flanery</P>
<P>Synopsis:
SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is a lighthearted romantic comedy about the magic of
two people getting together in New York. Beautiful young Amanda (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) has inherited a tiny, quaint, corner restaurant which
has been in the family for 70 years. But she's a terrible cook and the
business is foundering. Miraculously Amanda's luck takes a turn for the
better, and she's suddenly turning out culinary masterpieces that
literally cast magical spells on the people who eat them: desserts that
make people turn giddy and fall passionately in love or appetizers that
cause tears of joy. Amanda meets a dapper but commitment-phobic young
hunk named Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery). Will the romantic magic hold?
Will the two soulmates get together in the end despite a few misgivings
and misunderstandings?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Magical food and magical romance? SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is a warm and
delectable Valentines Day charmer about the fun, coincidence and
enchantment of meeting someone special. You can probably guess the main
outlines of any comedy about romantically destined soulmates, but in the
case of SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE it's delicious watching it happen, and the
sweet story leaves you with a happy melting feeling at the end. Bring
your significant other. Happy eating.</P>
