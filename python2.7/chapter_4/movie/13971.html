<PRE>Injustice from "The Avengers"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Let me first get this out of the way.  I am deeply surprised at how a
film that has such a pleasingly inspired look and a cast of superb
actors can amount to such a summer dud.  There are plenty of things that
are wrong with this movie.  For example, before entering the theatre, I
noticed a synopsis of the movie sent from the movie studio which was
posted by the ticket counter.  It says that John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), who are British super agents, were
investigating the murder of three other agents.  The odd thing was that
there were no such murders, the synopsis was completely wrong.</P>
<P>If you've seen any James Bond film, then you're already familiar with
the plot here.  British agents meet up with a deranged fanatic that is
bent on ruling the world. The villain, in a nice twist from his days as
the original James Bond, is Sean Connery playing evil aristocrat, Sir
August deWynter.  He formerly worked for the government and was one of
the instrumental scientists in developing the Prospero project, which
allowed a person to control weather.  If the worlds' leaders do not bow
down to him, he'll unleash Mother Nature.  And why is the filthy rich
deWynter doing this?  To perpetuate some philosophical dream?  As an act
of vengeance?  No.  Believe it or not, the answer is because he wants
MORE money.  He truly must be deranged.  Obviously, no thought went into
his motivations.</P>
<P>Much of this film seems bereft of thought and coherence.  Additionally,
we really feel nothing for the intrepid agents.  Valuing tea time almost
as greatly as saving the world, their demeanors come across as being so
nonchalant that it dampens any attempt to inject some energy into the
movie.  Indeed, there is this plastic-lawn-ornament sort of feeling that
wafts through the movie. </P>
<P>I have a feeling that this movie was written by a very creative person
and a second-rate writer who, during the course of developing this
movie, never met.  Each was responsible for developing a certain aspect
of the film, and they decided to brush aside any continuity problems.
"The Avengers" is actually a slick-looking piece and offered some unique
sequences such as a climatic battle between Peel and an evil henchman
atop a series of high wires and an amusing chase sequence where the
agents are being pursued by mechanized giant wasps with machine guns in
their stingers.  And there was some great comic touches such as when we
see a high-level meeting among the bad guys who all must wear giant,
brightly colored teddy bear suits to hide their identities.  But even
this kind of costuming and the elaborate sets can't disguise the fact
that this is a poorly developed project.</P>
