SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: John Madden</PRE>
<P>Writers: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard</P>
<P>Starring: Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, 
Ben Affleck, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, 
Rupert Everett</P>
<P>It's been awhile since we've had a truly great rethinking of the works 
of an artist known primarily for uniting and then splitting up a woman 
named Juliet and a man named Romeo...about three years, if I'm correct 
(that would point out that I am referring to none other than "Richard 
III," Richard Loncraine and Ian McKellen's wonderfully naughty 
adaptation-cum-daring-melodrama). But it's been, oh, three decades at 
least since we've had the last real retooling of the master's work 
("Richard III" more or less played the narrative straight through), and 
that's not counting the mediocre film version - of course, I'm referring 
to "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead," the legendary piece of wit 
from Tom Stoppard that is almost as cheerfully absurdist as, oh, 
"Waiting for Godot." Apparently he didn't get enough from that play, and 
needed to show us once again exactly how much he knows about the man and 
his subsequent work.</P>
<P>That being, "Shakespeare in Love," the egg that has since hatched from 
his mammoth-sized cranium, as well as that of Marc Norman (who came up 
with the actual plot), is no "RAGAD," but hey how the hell could it be. 
It's lighter. More cheerful. More accessible. Only slightly less 
engaging. Entertaining as all hell. In fact, in a year when even the 
biggest blockbusters can't lift you off your seat and put a big fat 
grimace across your face, it's refreshing to see a movie so witty and 
wonderfully passionate as this, and surprising to find that even if you 
can't name more than two of his plays ("Romeo and Juliet" and "Hamlet" 
notwithstanding), you can still find that this 
love-story-cum-backstage-pass-cum-witty-rethinking-of-the-life-of-a-certa
in-playwright-cum-costume-drama-cum-flat-out-comedy to be almost as 
pleasing as I or anyone else who actually enjoys the Bard does (not that 
I'm being priggish about it). Because Stoppard, even in "RAGAD," doesn't 
merely show off his knowledge of the Bard's work, but demonstrates it as 
well, and forms his plays/scripts so that even if you're not sure of the 
source material, you can still follow along fine (although it doesn't 
hurt to know what he's talking about, just to get some more of the 
jokes).</P>
<P>And he makes sure that the characters it's about are not just 
recreations from a previous much better play, but actual fresh 
realizations so the story is not stale and so it's easy to be drawn in. 
After all, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, presented so briefly in the 
play, were reintroduced by Stoppard as a variation on the Laurel and 
Hardy mold, a feuding pair of friends who aren't only likable and 
sympathetic because their fate is so obvious, but also because they're 
such great characters. Stoppard does a similar thing with the way he 
recreates Shakespeare. Thought of mostly as a prissy, maybe even 
pretentious artist, the way Shakespeare is presented here is a wonderful 
example of wit: thin, even (as I've been told) devastatingly attractive, 
and, best of all, a hack, he speaks in a whirlwind of aphorisms and 
metaphors, just trying to get his emotions out (a friend, after a short 
speech he's given, says "Enough of that; talk prose."). When we first 
meet him, he's a local London playwright, estranged from his wife, 
selling mere ideas to theatre-owners in hopes of advances and money per 
page he writes, constantly living under the glow of a certain other 
playwright, the then-more notable Christopher Marlow (Rupert Everett, a 
wonderful in-joke here, eh?). Under the employment of Philip Henslowe 
(Geoffrey Rush, in full over-the-top mode here, with a funny mustache 
and a medium-pitched, hilarious speaking voice that screams "rat"), he 
is currently laboring over this new play, aptly-titled "Romeo and Ethel, 
the Pirate's Daughter").</P>
<P>Everything explodes when, during a rehearsal, an actor reads from a play 
of his (the film finds him after early successes, like "Titus 
Andronicus," and before his later masterpieces, like, oh, "Hamlet"), and 
does it with such passion and gusto that he must get his name. But lo 
and behold, it's actually a woman, one Viola de Lessups (Gwyneth 
Paltrow), an attractive aristocrat's daughter, bethrothed to a pompous 
ass of a nobleman (Colin Firth, always on hand to be the asswhole who 
wrecks a lovely romance, like he was in "The English Patient"). The two 
meet again, her no longer in disguise, at a dance, and hit it off 
immeadiately. Once Viola has been cast as Romeo and has revealed her 
true identity to Shakespeare, the two launch into a series of passionate 
love scenes, and she quickly becomes his darling muse. As they make 
love, with the aid of her fellow nurse (Imelda Staunton), his banal play 
(written to make sure that it has pirates and a dog, as Henslowe points 
out) turns into the greatest love story of all time, and just as those 
two were lovers without any hope of a good finale, these two take 
delight in the fact that their relationship as well is doomed from the 
get-go, that she will eventually have to reclaim her social position, 
and he his, but in the meantime, they carry on such a passionate affair 
that it sparkles all the energy in him to write one of his first great 
plays, at least the one that will get him better jobs in the future.</P>
<P>But there's more to the film than just making light of Shakespeare's 
early career and his background for writing such passionate plays: the 
film is basically your traditional Shakespearean play, or at least a 
great carbon copy of such. It has true love, villainy, unexpected 
deaths, vicious twists, character manipulation, bawdy humor, social 
commentary, inside jokes about the times and even itself, and, the most 
classic Shakespearean entity: crossdressing, and not just great 
crossdressing, convincing crossdressing, where people actually buy that 
the gender is what it seems to be. It even has hilarious connections to 
the final form of "Romeo and Juliet" (imagine, if you will, a balcony 
scene culminating in a great fall and a chase by dogs). And it's all 
done in a witty, hilarious way that may have passed as mid-level 
Shakespeare, because Stoppard and Norman know exactly what they're doing 
(and so, I guess, does the other writer, Marc Norman). He knows what's 
funny, and what is also appealing. He crafts not only great lead 
characters, but also memorable supporting characters, like that of Hugh 
Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), the local moneylender, first seen buring the 
feet of Henslowe, who owes him money, and later seen cherishing the fact 
that he has a role in the final production of the play (even if it is as 
the apothecry). His delight in playing the role is such a sweetly funny 
thing to behold that it gives the film another layer of joy.</P>
<P>But there's much more. I just basically loved almost everything in this 
movie. I loved how it knew its subject backwards and forwards and knew 
how to present it in a witty and entertaining way (it even drolly gives 
a brief nod to Will Kemp, one of the more famous Elizabethan actors). I 
loved how the play was constructed and made so that Shakespeare could 
easily move from a forgettable work to an unforgettable one. I loved all 
the performances, especially Joseph Fiennes, so forgettable in 
"Elizabeth," and here so hilariously witty and charming; and even 
especially Judi Dench, playing an older, more knowledgable Queen 
Elizabeth, who steals all the three scenes she's in (an aside to Viola's 
fiance is just fantastic). For the first time, Gwyneth Paltrow measures 
up to her claim to fame (read: I finally respect her). And I even liked 
Ben Affleck (playing haughty actor Ned Alleyen, who is told that the 
play is titled "Mercutio" so that he doesn't fuck up the play).</P>
<P>But most of all, I loved how the center relationship is so full of life 
and vitality that we don't for one second doubt it's sincerity (a friend 
of mine did point out that when one is in love, one doesn't feel like 
doing work - not so: famous composer Leos Janacek was noted as doing the 
best work of his entire life when conducting a passionate affair, with a 
woman who happened to be half his age...and if it works for him, it 
could've worked for Shakespeare). And we feel for them so that even 
though we know that it's a cursed one from the beginning (like the way 
we know that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are going to die at the end of 
either of the plays they're in), we can't help but feel a huge loss when 
it actually comes around. It's magnificent direction (by John Madden) 
and beautiful look (which looks genuinely Elizabethan) only help to add 
to the overall impact of the film, but by the end, this is just another 
story of a man who appears to be great but is actually as hopeless lost 
and hopelessly romantic as the rest of us. Like us all, we see the great 
Shakespeare as a local hack, trying to find the muse that will pull him 
out of his prison, and when this happens, it's like a beautiful 
awakening. So is the film. Who else could have possibly made even the 
lowest artist feel better about themselves by downgrading Shakespeare 
and not succumb to the wrath of purists everywhere than Tom Stoppard? 
Just a great man, even if his one attempt at directing was a little 
weak. Norman too.</P>
