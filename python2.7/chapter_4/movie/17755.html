<PRE>`Go' Ahead
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>It's 3AM.  Do you know where your children are?  Well-hidden and tucked
beneath the cosmopolitan Los Angeles landscape exists a breed of
youngsters who do what they can to scrape by for their survival.  They
roam within deteriorating communities awash in the neon lights of porn
shops and the blue and red blinking lights of passing police cars.  For
some, like Ronna and Claire, they are underpaid checkout girls at the
local supermarket within their much-in-need-of beautification
neighborhood.  Their friend includes Simon, who is a small time drug
dealer.  Their hardened childhoods have made them street smart,
resourceful, and desperate.  Kids like this don't think, they just do. 
They just go.</P>
<P>`Go' is an off-centered comedy that employs quirky sex and violence in
an environment filled with drugs, rave dances, and strange
conversations about pop culture.   There are three scenarios that
illustrate how a simple decision puts them on a path that will cause
their already unfocused lives to spin further out of control.  The
first one focuses on Ronna (Sarah Polley).  She is facing eviction, and
unless she can generate rent money in a night, she'll be thrown out. 
Her plan involves Simon's drug distributor.  But she can't anticipate
the situation that she's walking into.  Her situation is made worse by
her accomplice who is tripping out on a powerful hallucinogen during
the height of the problem.</P>
<P>The second story features Simon, who is a young, brash, and libidinous
teenager on his first trip to Las Vegas.  His wide-eyed curiosity is
bound to get him into a lot of trouble.  For example, accompanied by
his friend to a topless bar, he is warned not to get a bottle of
champagne (a very expensive invitation for a private lap dance), which
he naturally does.  Their situation also spins out of control, and as
they make their escape, another friend being filled in on the details
exclaims, `you mean you stole a car, shot a bouncer and had sex with
two girls at the same time?'  There's another story that focuses on two
men.  Their vignette revolves around elements of gayness and a humorous
poke at the multi-level marketing structure of Amway, but their
inclusion into the overall story line is to show that even responsible
adults can get themselves into bizarre situations where their may be no
way out.  </P>
<P>The film's structure involves an interlocking timeline, where we
revisit certain scenes more than once.  When we do, we'll be revisiting
the same time period through the eyes of a different person.  All of
these varied stories cleverly converge.  This is certainly a
well-structured movie.  I liked the depiction of the drug euphoria,
which was like being underwater where sights and sounds are severely
distorted.  I'm not condoning drug use, but did enjoy the stylish
visualization, depicted as a wild Macarena-like sequence in the produce
section of a supermarket and a telepathic cat.   There are many offbeat
characters that lend energy to this film.  I also liked how these kids'
lives were symbolized and the general atmosphere of the film.  When the
frenzied activities of the previous night finally ends, the next thing
that they want to is only as clear as the cover of the morning fog. 
But these kids are scrappy, and they'll find a way to survive.</P>
