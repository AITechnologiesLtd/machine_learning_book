<P>LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE, THE (AMANTS DU PONT-NEUF) (director/writer: Leos
Carax; cinematographer: Jean-Yves Escoffier; cast: Juliette Binoche
(Michèle  Stalens), Denis Lavant (Alex), Klaus-Michael Gruber (Hans),
1991-France)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Leos Carax's inspiration for this film was Jean Vigo's masterpiece
"L'Atalante" (1934). This becomes very evident by the film's end, as the
love story concludes with a note of romanticism on a barge heading out
to the Atlantic. This modern lyrical film, is a love story about the
homeless who live on the oldest and most famous bridge in Paris, the
Pont-Neuf, which is in a high rent area where the only other group that
could afford to live in the area are the very rich. The film starts out
looking as if it is going to be a documentary, but it slowly builds into
a study of three people who come to live there as homeless souls and
then builds into a fantastically intense love story. The lovers live
outside in the debris of the Pont-Neuf (the bridge was closed for
repairs in 1989). The lovers had nothing in the way of possessions and
had to live only for their feelings for one another. There is nothing
pretty about these characters or endearing about the situation they are
in, and it has a frighteningly real look to it.</P>
<P>This high-budget fantasy film is directed by Leos Carax (Boy Meets
Girl/Bad Blood); it is one of the most costly French films ever made. It
cost roughly $28 million to make this film about the homeless. Carax
built a monumental set in the South of France countryside that
duplicated Pont-Neuf and its environment, which is where most of the
loot was spent.</P>
<P>A street-person, a drunk, and a drug addict, Alex (Denis Lavant), has
passed out on the road, and his leg gets run over. When he limps back to
his usual resting spot under the bridge, he finds a young woman, Michèle
(Juliette Binoche), who is wearing an eye patch and is sleeping in his
usual spot. His partner, an older bum, Hans (Klaus-Michael Gruber),
takes an immediate dislike to her and tells her to get lost she can't
sleep here. He tells her a woman will only get raped or beaten up here,
it only a place for bums like Alex and me. It turns out that she is an
artist and is rapidly losing her eyesight. She is also suffering from a
heartache over a lover; afraid that she will never see again she has run
away from her comfortable former existence, wishing to just stay here
and draw some last portraits and see a famous museum picture before
going blind.</P>
<P>The story is a quiet one, an imitation of the life and sounds of all the
things happening in their surroundings. We hear gun fire, a cello
played, see snow fall on Christmas Eve, see a stunning fireworks show on
Bastille Day, and get a feel for the subway passages the way the
vagrants view them. It is not a story where we are going to find out
much about these three, just enough so that we have a little feel of how
they came to be there. The skinheaded Alex is a panhandler, a petty
thief, and a street theater performer: doing fire-eating and gymnastic
routines to earn some money. Hans was a night watchman for thirty years
and when his family went to pieces, he became a bum.</P>
<P>What this reckless film is about (it is reckless because it is not about
logical people), is something that can't easily be explained because it
is a poetical vision about those who have gone over the line of sanity.
It is about those who will survive only through a miracle, the good will
of others, or through continuing to lead the foolish life they are
leading and not retreating from their folly. This film is visual cinema,
dialogue is not that relevant. We observe the madness of their lives and
how love is so difficult to comprehend but is the only thing that is out
there that can't be taken away from them, that it becomes the rationale
of the film. This could have been made as a silent film, it could be
viewed like Murnau's "Sunrise," as the disenfranchised view the bright
lights of a modern urban city  for how it might corrupt those who live
there.</P>
<P>One of the problems that held up production was that the producer died.
That was followed by the breakup of the director with his lover, who
happened to be the star of the film, Juliette Binoche ("The English
Patient"/ "Blue"/ "Damage"). In the meantime, while the film stopped
shooting, she had a few breakthrough roles and could have gone to make
more glamorous films at higher pay, but she felt committed to this
project and did finish the film. It took three years for the film to be
made and then some considerable more time to get a U.S. release date
(reportedly because the producers charged exorbitant fees for its
release, in the hope of making up for the high production costs).
Commercially the film bombed, but critically it received many great
reviews. There were also quite a few negative ones, and the one from
Vincent Canby in the N.Y. Times really hurt. It delayed the release date
in America. The ones who hated this film, seemed to really hate it.</P>
<P>I appreciated the film, finding it to be slow-moving but a startling and
compelling film, that had a unique way of influencing my sensibilities
through its images. Not quite a masterpiece, but a film that made my
heart go out to its lovers.</P>
