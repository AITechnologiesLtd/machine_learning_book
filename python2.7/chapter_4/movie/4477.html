<PRE>                           THE JETSONS: THE MOVIE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Recently, I was one of the chaperons for my four year old boy's
preschool when they went to see JETSONS: THE MOVIE.  The movie was
unique in that it is the only children's movie I know that shows adults
at their jobs.  Most kids' stories have adults in them that seem to be
independently wealthy in that they never go to work or they work at
some unknown and unshown place.</P>
<P>     What really bothered me about the movie was the stereotypes it
showed the kids about what it means to have a job and what capitalism
is all about.  In the movie, the family has a life of easy with every
gadget possible, i.e., a high and comfortable standard of living.  This
was obtained solely from George Jetson's salary.</P>
<P>     Now what did he do to earn this salary?  He had to fight traffic
to get to work but once there he had a single job - to push a button
one time at the start of the day and then he slept, BUT he was not
happy because he always feared his evil boss would show up and actually
make him do something.  The movie made you hate such a terrible and
inconsiderate boss.</P>
<P>     Guess what else this evil boss has in mind?  He is interested in
making a profit (gasp!), and moreover, his board of directors are even
demanding he turn a profit.  The movie then teaches children how this
profit thing is accomplished.  The boss does this by exploiting his
workers (as an example of this, he promotes George to VP but does not
give him a raise) and by destroying the ecosystem of some unknown
endangered species.</P>
<P>     In the end, the boss learns the evil of his ways and agrees to
feather bedding to make up for it.  He takes on hundreds of workers
(the unknown endangered species) and agrees to hire all of them to run
his plant.  This is a plant that was so automated that one person ran
it before.  Somehow this all means he will get "fair" profits and
everyone will be happy.  A great economics lesson.</P>
<P>     In the end the children have learned that capitalism is all about
spoiling the ecosystem and exploiting workers.  This sure makes them
want to grow up to become entrepreneurs and build healthy businesses.
Sad.</P>
<P>     JETSONS: THE MOVIE is rated G and runs less an hour and a half.
I give the movie * 1/2 as they had about 10-15 minutes worth of cleaver
ideas and fun gadgets - certainly not enough for a full-length movie.
I suspect, on the other hand, that little ones will not realize or care
that they are being brainwashed and will think the movie is a fun
little diversion.  Mine did.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
