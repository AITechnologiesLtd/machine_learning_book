<P>Saving Private Ryan Produced by Mutual Film Company / Mark Gordon Productions

Reiben), Tom Sizemore Sergeant Horvath),  Barry Pepper (Private Jackson) Vin

(Private Jackson), Jeremy Davies (Corporal Upham), and Matt Damon (Private
Ryan).        Runtime: 170.  Reviewed by Michael Turton.  ** out of *****.</P>
<P>Weighed down by tired plot lines and Spielberg's reliance on formulas,
_Saving Private Ryan_ is  a mediocre film which nods in the direction of
realism before descending into an abyss of cliches.</P>
<P>There ought to be a law against Steven Spielberg making movies about truly
serious topics.  Spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished,
formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to
make a perfect story.  But for a topic of such weight as combat in the second
world war (or the Holocaust) this technique backfires, for it creates
coherent, comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size,
complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken.        In this way
Spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films.</P>
<P>_Saving Private Ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on
a "PR mission" to pull a young man, Ryan (whose three other brothers were
just killed in fighting elsewhere) out of combat on the Normandy front just
after D-Day.  Ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night
before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers.  The
search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of World
War II combat in France.</P>
<P>There's no denying Spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great
war movie.  The equipment, uniforms and weapons are superbly done.  The
opening sequence, in which Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his men onto
Omaha Beach, is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually
capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat. 
Another pleasing aspect of the film is Spielberg's brave depiction of scenes
largely unknown to American audiences, such as the shooting of prisoners by
Allied soldiers, the banality of death in combat, the routine foul-ups in the
execution of the war, and the cynicism of the troops.  The technical side of
the film is peerless, as always.  The camera work is magnificent, the pacing
perfect, the sets convincing, the directing without flaw.  Hanks will no
doubt be nominated for an Oscar for his performance, which was utterly
convincing, and the supporting cast was excellent, though Ted Danson seems a
mite out of place as a paratroop colonel.</P>
<P>Yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face
because realism is not something which can be represented  by single
instances or events.  It has to thoroughly permeate the context at every
level of the film, or the story fails to convince. Throughout the movie
Spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds
produced by modern mechanized devices (exception: men are shown burning to
death with relative frequency).  For example, we see only one man with guts
spilled out on the ground.  Here and there men lose limbs; in one scene
Miller is pulling a man to safety, there's an explosion, and Miller looks
back to see he is only pulling half a man.  But the rest of the corpses are
remarkably intact.  There are no shoes with only feet in them, no limbs
scattered everywhere, no torsos without limbs, no charred corpses, and most
importantly, all corpses have heads (in fairness there are a smattering of
wicked head wounds).  The relentless dehumanization of the war, in which even
corpses failed to retain any indentity, is soft-pedaled in the film. 
Ultimately, _Saving Private Ryan_ bows to both Hollywood convention and the
unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death
in war.  Rather than saying _Saving Private Ryan_ is "realistic," it would be
better to describe it as "having realistic moments."</P>
<P>Another aspect of the "Hollywoodization" of the war is the lack of realistic
dialogue and in particular, the lack of swearing.  Anyone familiar with the
literature on the behavior of the men during the war, such as Fussell's
superb _Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War_ (which
has an extensive discussion on swearing), knows that the troops swore
fluently and without letup.  "Who is this Private Ryan that we have to die
for him?" asks one infantrymen in the group of eight.  Rendered in wartime
demotic, that should have been expressed as "Who is this little pecker that
we have to get our dicks shot off for him?" or some variant thereof. 
Conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "F" word, and
largely about (the search for) food and sex.  This is all the more
inexplicable because the movie already had an "R" rating due to violence, so
swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film.</P>
<P>However, the most troubling aspect of the film is the Spielbergization of the
topic.        The most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not
emotionally wrenching enough for Steven Spielberg.  He cannot just cede
control to the material; he has to be bigger than it.  As if afraid to let
the viewer find their own (perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear)
emotional foothold in the material, Spielberg has to package it in Hallmark
moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had: the opening and
closing scenes of Ryan and his family in the war cemetary (reminscent of the
closing scene from _Schindler's List), the saccharine exchange between Ryan
and his wife at the close (every bit as bad as Schindler's monologue about
how his car, tiepin or ring could have saved another Jew), quotes from
Abraham Lincoln and Emerson, Captain Miller's last words to Private Ryan, and
an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the
movie comes back to kill the Captain.  That particular subplot is so hokey,
so predictable, it nigh on ruins the film.</P>
<P>Nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness,
stupidity and  waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who
actually fought in combat (imagine if Miller had been killed by friendly fire
or collateral damage).        Because of its failure to mine deeply into the
terrible realities of World War II, _Saving Private Ryan_ can only pan for
small truths in the shallows.  2 stars out of 5.</P>
