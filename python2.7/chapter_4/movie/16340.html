<PRE>Exercise Caution When Crossing `The Thin Red Line'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>One of the first images that we see in this film is of a crocodile
maneuvering itself into the murky waters as it lies in wait for it's
next meal.  It is a killing machine that preys mercilessly upon
unsuspecting victims.  In another scene, we see an idyllic island
village.  Children are playing innocently among themselves while the
adults carry out their daily chores practically oblivious to the
war-ravaged world that exists only a few miles away.  This is a
society that reflects Man's best nature.  But the nature of paradise
that we all hope to experience is always being challenged.  Desire,
vengeance, anger, and other ‘urges' constantly push us further away
from Eden and into the same realm of the crocodile.  Soldiers, I
suppose, may struggle the most with this fragile balance between
protecting the goodness of society and killing others to reach that
goal.  How do they contain their ‘urges'?  How do they stay true to
themselves?  `The Thin Red Line' looks at this issue several times
over against the backdrop of World War II.</P>
<P>The film introduces several characters who all have their personal
struggles.  Among them are Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col.
Tall (Nick Nolte).  Staros is a lawyer by trade and has seen too many
of his friends die in his arms during the many campaigns with which he
has been involved.  He has a soft heart, and will do whatever he can
to protect those under his command.  Tall, however, is a man that has
been preparing for war for the last fifteen years.  Now that he
finally has his chance, he yearns to make an impact, even if it means
sacrificing many lives during an ill-planned campaign to overtake an
enemy stronghold.  He barks out orders with his gritty voice and
challenges his often-weary troops to rise up to the occasion.  Staros
takes exception to his zealousness and hesitates to execute Tall's
commands.  Other characters include Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) who is an
optimist that wants to find paradise; Capt. Gaff (John Cusack) who
doesn't like the prospect of being promoted; and Sgt. Welsh (Sean
Penn) whose soul has become irreparably cynical.</P>
<P>This film certainly doesn't play like a conventional war film.  A good
portion of the film focuses on the soldiers' thoughts about the
starkness of reality while scenes of their personal Eden flash back
and forth like some Nature channel montage.  As an entertainment
seeker, it would be difficult for me to recommend this film.  One
thing was that it was very frustrating trying to distinguish among the
many characters - especially when they're all covered with grime, dirt
and blood.  Character development didn't seem to be a high priority. 
In addition, many of the characters seemed to randomly appear and then
disappear.  There lacked a sense of consistency and it was hard to
become attached to any of the players.  Additionally, the movie is
just over 3 hours long, which makes sitting through this philosophical
exercise very difficult.  In fact, after the showing, many of the
patrons left with a somewhat bewildered or puzzled look on their
faces.  I suppose that they expected a more traditional kind of war
film, but got something completely different.  If you're hoping for a
film about war and it's potentially terrific conflicts, you can expect
and uphill battle.</P>
