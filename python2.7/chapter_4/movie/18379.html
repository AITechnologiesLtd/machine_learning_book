IN THE LINE OF DUTY: THE TWILIGHT MURDERS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>IN THE LINE OF DUTY is the critically praised series of
television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that
claimed lives of law enforcement officers in USA. THE
TWILIGHT MURDERS, another one from the series, is dealing
with the case of Gordon Kahl (played by Rod Steiger), old
farmer from North Dakota who would rather spend a year in
prison than pay taxes to the despised U.S. government. After
being released, he still refuses to pay taxes and the
warrant is issued for his arrest. When the U.S. marshals
come to arrest him, it turns out that Kahl isn't alone. Many
poor farmers in rural Northwest share his extremist
anti-government beliefs, and the routine operation turns
into shootout that would leave federal officers that. That
brings FBI on the scene, and Agent Mayberly (Michael Gross)
is supervising the manhunt. However, his efforts seem
fruitless, since Kahl still has many supporters, some of
them even in the local law enforcement.</P>
<P>After BETRAYED, 1988 thriller by Costa Gavras, Hollywood
mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing
extremism in the American Northwest, and that remained so
until Oklahoma City bombing, when media hype brought
right-wingers back into spotlight. Until that time, only the
television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to
that phenomenon. Unfortunately, THE TWILIGHT MURDERS is
still routine and formulaic television film, that uses
sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of
originality in the script. Sometimes, like many American TV
movies, it creates drama where drama shouldn't be. On the
other hand, film is steadily directed by Dick Lowry, and Rod
Steiger does good job potraying Gordon Kahl. On the other
hand, Michael Gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his
interaction with some of the actors is terrible. However,
film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and
political issues, so hour and half spent in front of the
screen shouldn't be the total waste of time.</P>
