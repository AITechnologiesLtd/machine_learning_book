<P>_Mission:_Impossible_II_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Brevity, it seems, is but a side benefit of Paramount's insistence that
_Mission:_Impossible II_ (as the film is called in its main title
sequence) be referred to by its promotional title, _M:I-2_.  The shorter
title is a better fit for the John Woo-directed big-budget follow-up to
the smash 1996 TV spinoff, for it never quite feels like a
_Mission:_Impossible_ film.  For that matter, it also never completely
feels like a John Woo film.  Fortunately, the strange middle ground
_M:I-2_ achieves proves to be more than enough to satisfy anyone looking
for a jolt of summer movie action.</P>
<P>However, it takes a while for that jolt to kick in.  Woo is one of the
best, if not the absolute best, directors of action films working today,
and that's not necessarily because inventive ways of choreographing and
editing gunfights (though that does play a large part).  His best films,
in particular those he made in his native Hong Kong, were also just as
much concerned about the larger emotional and psychological issues in the
story.  His masterpiece, 1989's _The_Killer_ (which he also wrote),
centered around a hitman's attempt at redemption; his best American film,
1997's _Face/Off_ (which he didn't write--but certainly felt written
especially for him) explored the common Woo theme of duality by having
two men on opposite sides of the law swap faces and identities.</P>
<P>By contrast, _Mission: Impossible_ is a spy caper, and by design it is
more concerned with the nuts-and-bolts of convoluted espionage plots than
anything about the characters.  So in _M:I-2_'s plot-establishing first
two-thirds, Woo obviously doesn't have his heart in it, and the plodding
pace is nowhere near the consistently rapid pulse Brian DePalma gave the
first film.  There are no big shootout set pieces for Woo to strut his
stuff, so he is made to have whatever fun he can with a stylish but
largely by-the-book car chase between our hero, Impossible Mission Force
agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (a ravishing Thandie
Newton), a sexy thief.  Hunt is ordered by his nameless superior (an
unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit her for a mission to recover a
deadly virus stolen by rogue agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).</P>
<P>Cruise, who also produced, took the criticisms of the first
_Mission:_Impossible_'s labyrinthine plot to heart, hence the simple plot
that can be succinctly summarized by the above sentence.  As such,
_M:I-2_ is much easier to follow than its predecessor, but it is also
less in the spirit of the original concept of the show.  Contrary to one
of the film's best lines in the film (delivered by Hopkins' character),
the retrieval-of-the-virus assignment is more "mission difficult" than
"mission impossible."  As ridiculously complex as the first film's story
was, it made for a more engrossing and convincing spy yarn.</P>
<P>Perhaps this was a concession to Woo and his style, for scripter Robert
Towne also makes some attempt at a more intimate subplot, building a love
triangle between Hunt, Nyah, and Ambrose.  But it's not particularly
well-developed, for I never detected much of a sincere connection between
Nyah and her former love Ambrose, robbing this element of the story of
any tension or suspense.  Chalk up this weakness to Woo as well, for he
skews the balance by effectively using his natural visual flair toward
establishing the link between Hunt and Nyah, whose portrayers are nicely
matched.</P>
<P>So far, not so good, and just when one is ready to completely dismiss
_Mission:_Impossible II_, at the end of the second act Towne's script
finally plops Hunt in the middle of an impossible situation and gives Woo
for the chance he'd been waiting for the entire film.  With the
bullets--as well as many people--flying about a laboratory in a
spectacular shootout, everyone involved in the production appears to be
galvanized: all the cast members (especially Cruise, who clearly gives
his all) and, above all, Woo himself.  This sequence is classic Woo in
every way; not only is the gunplay exciting and strangely beautiful to
behold, there are also the broad, operatic emotional strokes that lend
weight to the pyrotechnics.  (However, one of Cruise's big lines is a
near-laughable, almost word-for-word duplication of Daniel Day-Lewis'
signature declaration in _The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_.)</P>
<P>Once you get Woo started, there's no stopping him, and the final 40
minutes of _M:I-2_ is far and away the most electrifying action
filmmaking one is likely to see on the big screen this year. 
Everything--from the slow-mo shots of near-balletic fight moves to the
omnipresent flying birds--one expects from a John Woo action film finally
arrives, and he does not disappoint, and not just in an action
standpoint.  The underwhelming story resolves itself in a satisfying way;
however, it is somewhat hampered by the problem that plagued the end of
_Face/Off_: signs that point toward a more complex--and typically
Woo--close are erased by an overwhelming sunniness.</P>
<P>While Woo defies the odds and performs a spectacular rescue of _M:I-2_
in its final third, it's clear that, for all his brilliance, he simply is
not the filmmaker best suited to this franchise's constricting formula. 
_M:I-2_ ultimately delivers the goods and is certain to be a huge hit,
and one hopes that with the new doors opened by it, Woo will return to
writing his own material, a key factor to his finest films--one of which
_M:I-2_, while ending up quite good in its own right, certainly won't be
mistaken for.  </P>
