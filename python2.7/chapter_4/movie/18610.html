<P>        The Thirteenth Floor is a bland, obligatory exercise in genre
film-making.  If I hadn't recently watched The Matrix and Open Your Eyes
-- both of which are similar but far superior -- I might have been a
little nicer to this picture.  Craig Bierko makes an adequate hero as
Douglas Hall, the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation
who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss (Armin
Mueller-Stahl).  Everything that was subtle and smart about the
previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one, and
characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and
refuse to communicate on any realistic level.  The acting is okay, but
the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of, and
features a script (co-penned by director Josef Rusnak) loaded with
cliches and stock characters.  There are individual scenes and ideas
that work -- I like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but
none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree. 
Producer Roland Emmerich, based on this and his previous directorial
efforts, seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in
mediocre science-fiction.</P>
