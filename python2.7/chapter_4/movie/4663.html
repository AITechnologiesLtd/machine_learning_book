<PRE>                        FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963) ***</PRE>
<P>        This second movie in the James Bond series is better than the 
first, DR. NO, but still not quite as good as GOLDFINGER, the third. 
FROM RUSSIA is notable, though, in that it's the only Sean Connery 
Bond film where Bond gets it on with four different women, including 
two gypsy women at the same time. Now that's a man with a license 
for more than just killing.</P>
<P>        This time, the race is on to see who will get ahold of a new 
decryption technology--the good guys (British intelligence) or the bad 
guys (SPECTRE). SPECTRE gets the jump on 007 by sending him 
one of their own, a beautiful Russian woman who claims to have 
defected from the KGB. She doesn't even know she's working for 
SPECTRE (that's how clever those guys are) and she's convinced she'll 
be doing Mother Russia a great service by giving Bond false 
information. She ends up giving Bond a lot more--and falling in love 
with him as a result.</P>
<P>        FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE moves more slowly than most 
of the later Bond movies, but is still definitely entertaining, and meets 
the quota of chases, explosions, shootouts, belly dancers, cat fights and 
other degrading depictions of women. How James Bond manages to 
sleep with all those women and still not catch every sexually 
transmitted disease under the sun is beyond me. Maybe it helps to stay 
away from female characters named Colonel Klapp.</P>
