<P>A gorgeous-looking but uneven twist on Robin Hood, Plunkett & Macleane
reunites two Trainspotting stars as criminals that rob from the rich,
but keep the wealth for themselves rather than passing it along to the
poor. The promising directorial debut from music video director Jake
Scott brings to mind Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet – another pic that
modernized (to an extent) a period piece. The script is a bit of a mess,
but the film's astonishing look is more than enough to offset any story
problems.</P>
<P>Set in 1748 London, the film opens with Captain James Macleane (Jonny
Lee Miller, Hackers) en route to debtor's prison. His stagecoach crashes
with another and, while crouching in the darkness, Macleane witnesses
two shadowy figures rob the passengers. One crook swallows a giant red
jewel after being shot by the approaching authorities. As he lies there
slowly dying, the lawmen press his wound in an attempt to procure the
name of his accomplice. The wounded criminal doesn't finger his friend
and Macleane watches as he is put out of his misery.</P>
<P>Several days later, the on-the-lam Macleane watches the outlaw's funeral
from a distance and returns that night to dig up the body and fish the
jewel out of the cadaver. But his grave-robbing is interrupted by the
dead man's partner, who has returned to lay claim to the jewel. His name
is Plunkett (Robert Carlyle, Ravenous) and, with his gun to Macleane's
head, Plunkett makes him delve into the corpse's innards in a very
disgusting-looking and sounding scene. They eventually surrender as
authorities surround them and Plunkett swallows the oft-eaten jewel for
safe keeping.</P>
<P>In New Gate Prison, we discover that Macleane is formerly of wealth but
ended up in tattered clothes because of monstrous gambling debts.
Plunkett approaches him with a plan – use the jewel to buy their way out
of the clink and, once freed, join forces to rob the rich. Macleane
agrees, but the two must wait until Plunkett passes their bauble, which
eventually hits the metal pan with a satisfying "clang."</P>
<P>The plan includes reestablishing Macleane as a "gentleman" in local
society as he stakes out the ritziest parties in town in an attempt to
learn the most vulnerable rich folk to rob. He loses money gambling at
these parties only to promise "I'll get ii back," which he does – and
then some – as he and Plunkett hijack the mark's stagecoach on the way
home. Macleane will even go so far as to copulate with disgusting
richies and at one point gets a bad case of "the pox," an early venereal
disease. Later, the men disrupt the heifer's wedding, robbing its
opulent guests during a fantastic fireworks display in this
great-looking scene.</P>
<P>As their escapades continue, their notoriety rises, as well as their
reward for capture. Plunkett and Macleane even knock over an important
figurehead in local government, who happens to be escorting his lovely
young niece (Liv Tyler, Cookie's Fortune) for whom Macleane fall. Of
interesting note, this is Tyler's second period piece that features
characters drawing at ten paces. The other is the upcoming Ralph Fiennes
film Onegin.</P>
<P>The picture's modern twist includes piercing, prominent cursing,
widespread gambling and the use of modern music, which is a bit
distracting at first, but as the film continues you realize that it's
better than the typical harpsichord crap that would ordinarily accompany
a frocky period piece like this. Critics will probably laugh this film
off, but its fantastic looks – especially the nighttime robbery scenes –
appear to be equal to that of the upcoming Sleepy Hollow (at least from
what I've seen from the trailer). The hodgepodge script comes from five
writers and the movie was filmed in three locations - London, Prague and
Spain.</P>
<P>1:33 –  for some strong violence, sexuality and language</P>
