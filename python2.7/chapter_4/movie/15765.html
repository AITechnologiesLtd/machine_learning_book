<P>     Mighty Joe Young gives the most noteworthy performance in MIGHTY JOE
YOUNG, which is only to be expected.  After all, like the dinosaurs in
JURASSIC PARK or the tornados in TWISTER (another film in which Bill
Paxton is upstaged by a special effect), the big ape is the only reason
anyone might want to see the film.  In this big-budget remake of the 1949
ersatz KING KONG, a combination of monkey suit, computer animation and
electronics replace Ray Harryhausen stop-motion to provide a more
versatile range of emotion.  The goal was a sympathetic simian, a 15-foot
ton o' love you couldn't help but cheer for.</P>
<P>     All evidence suggests that making Joe a crowd-pleasing character was
all anyone involved in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG cared about -- and they couldn't
even get _that_ right.  They begin by making him an orphan, his mother
killed by poachers in Africa on the same night that anthropologist Dr.
Ruth Young (Linda Purl) leaves her own daughter an orphan trying to save
the apes.  Twelve years later, American zoologist Gregg O'Hara (Bill
Paxton) comes to Africa to investigate legends of a giant ape, and
discovers Joe to be real -- and his caretaker, Dr. Young's daughter Jill
(Charlize Theron), to be beautiful.  O'Hara offers Joe protection at a Los
Angeles nature preserve, but danger lurks in the person of Strasser (Rade
Sherbedgia), the killer of Joe and Jill's parents who has both dollar
signs and vengeance on his mind.</P>
<P>     MIGHTY JOE YOUNG can only work on a story level if Joe is not a
monster but a sensitive, misunderstood stranger in a strange land, like a
hirsute E. T.  Unfortunately, there is not a shred of internal logic to 
Joe's personality.  At times, he's a big playful kid; at other times, for
no apparent reason other than a cheap laugh, he's a super-intelligent
beast who shakes his head ironically and escapes from pursuers with
cleverly-executed diversionary tactics.  One minute he's looking at O'Hara
as an enemy and a rival for Jill's affection, and the next he's holding
O'Hara's hand like they're old pals.  Even Joe's situational sense of
morality makes it hard to care about him, as he dispatches villains with
the kind of ruthlessness you'd expect of James Bond, not the furry hero of
a Disney movie.  Joe's not a character -- he's a contrivance, manipulated
by technicians for whatever tone suits the needs of the moment.</P>
<P>     That leaves the human characters, and oh what a scary mistake that
turns out to be.  Charlize Theron is a tremendously appealing actress, but
she's instantly ridiculous traipsing around the jungle in a designer
coiffure; Bill Paxton fares little better as the earnest, bland hero you
expect at any moment will scold the villain with "he's in it for the
money, not the science."  They get to wander together in a couple of
canned romantic interludes so absurd you'll want to shoot yourself in the
thigh with a tranquilizer dart.  The rest of the cast consists of 
obligatory types (the Intransigent Authority Figure, the Henchman, etc.)
and obligatory cameos from the original (Terry Moore and Ray Harryhausen
himself), all standing around waiting for Joe to go on his action-packed
climactic rampage.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of viewers to whom none of this will matter in the
slightest, provided MIGHTY JOE YOUNG delivers its share of family
adventure.  In fact, it works sporadically on that level, with a couple of
lively chases and some whoop-it-up destruction on Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm just not sure what kids will make of the violence Joe inflicts on
innocent bystanders, or his streak of homicidal vigilantism.  It's telling
that the film has to put a child in jeopardy in the final ten minutes to
make Joe's noble heart evident, and have the child plead for the ape's
well-being with a wide-eyed "Is Joe gonna be all right?"  All the
film-makers needed to do for MIGHTY JOE YOUNG to work on a basic level was
make it easy to root for Joe.  Instead, the only character that matters --
in a Disney film, no less -- is an unstable, ill-defined murderer.  Say it
ain't so, Joe...say it ain't so.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 meet Joe blecchhs:  3.</PRE>
