<P>     For approximately five minutes, the computer-animated DINOSAUR is
undeniably spectacular. The story creeps up without dialogue, following
the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled, abandoned nest
across an astonishing primeval landscape. Creatures of the water nudge the
leathery ovum along in lakes teeming with life; creatures of the air carry
it over plateaus and through verdant valleys. Seven years removed from the
revolutionary screen creations of JURASSIC PARK, I didn't think it would
be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the
imagination, but it happens in DINOSAUR nonetheless. With its entirely
visual storytelling, DINOSAUR's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing
prospect: an introduction to a lost world as quietly, primally engrossing
as Kubrick's "dawn of man" prologue to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.</P>
<PRE>     And then a cute little simian opens its stupid mouth.</PRE>
<P>     I knew going into DINOSAUR that it was a Disney film aimed at kids,
so I can't say I was expecting anything more profound than the story it
ultimately provided. That didn't make its presence any less disappointing. 
That story follows an Iguanodon named Aladar (voiced by D. B. Sweeney),
orphaned in true Disney protagonist fashion after hatching from the
aforementioned egg to a family of primitive Lemurs. He lives happily with
his adopted mother Plio (Alfre Woodard), grandfather Yar (Ossie Davis) and
brother Zini (Max Casella) until a meteor shower wreaks havoc on the
lemur's habitat. Aladar and his family find themselves back in the realm
of the dinosaurs, joined with a herd migrating across a decimated
landscape in hopes of finding their nesting ground spared from the
meteors' destruction.</P>
<P>     Along the way, of course, conflicts develop. The Aladar clan
befriends and helps a pair of geriatric dinos -- Brachiosaur Baylene (Joan
Plowright) and Styrachosaur Eema (Della Reese) -- much to the
consternation of the herd's proto-Darwinian Iguanodon leader Kron (Samuel
E. Wright, erstwhile Sebastian from THE LITTLE MERMAID). Aladar,
previously isolated from any others of his kind, swoons over Kron's
sweet-natured sister Neera (Julianna Margulies), further provoking Kron's
wrath. There are confrontations with a pack of hungry Velociraptors and
with a pair of equally hungry Carnotaurs (think T. rex, only with even
worse dispositions and devilish horns). There are close calls, narrow
escapes and grand battles.</P>
<P>     Yaaaaaaawwn. Disney's animated features have generally been pretty
formulaic, so it's no shock to discover that DINOSAUR features a
by-the-numbers script. This variation, however, is so relentlessly somber
and dreary that there's nothing left but formula. The personalities of the
principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired
that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small
feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate
post-apocalyptic scenery. Even the minor characters like Zini and Eema --
those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't
inject any life into the film. In recent Disney films, the musical numbers
have come off as purely obligatory, but I found myself pleading for a
snappy tune to breathe some life into the film. It's hard to imagine what
young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production, and even
harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake. </P>
<P>     There's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of
DINOSAUR is extraordinary, mixing the computerized cast with some
real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell
where reality and hard drive overlap. Apparently, however, co-director
Ralph Zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than
he was for the limp 1993 animated feature WE'RE BACK! That film seemed
rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's Jurassic juggernaut. 
This one misses its opportunity to step out of the Spielbergian shadow,
gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces. That's a
sad end to a film that begins with so much promise. Of course no one would
risk millions on DINOSAUR without anthropomorphized animals. Better to
recycle Disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor,
its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction.</P>
