<PRE>                              STEEL MAGNOLIAS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        STEEL MAGNOLIAS must have been a casting director's wet dream!  Try
this on for size: Sally Fields, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Daryl
Hannah, Dolly Parton, and Julia Roberts all together in one movie.
Collectively, these actresses have so much charisma that STEEL MAGNOLIAS
manages to escape without serious injury from a potentially fatal case of
tear-jerking.</P>
<P>        The movie clicks thanks to the warm camaraderie between the cast
members.  The story revolves around Roberts as a diabetic who decides to
risk her life by getting pregnant.  Fields is Roberts' over-protective
mother in a flashy role which requires the actress to pour on the pathos.
MacLaine is a riot as a cranky eccentric who claims to have been in a bad
mood for 40 years.  Dukakis is the fun-loving widow who enjoys exchanging
insults with MacLaine.  They all hang out and gossip at Dolly Parton's
beauty salon.</P>
<P>        The actresses are working with an exceptionally clever script,
which contains some of the year's funniest one-liners.  In fact, Gene
Siskel has dismissed the film as "Southern Belles doing stand-up."  But
when you're rolling in the aisles, who cares if the dialogue is
unrealistic?  Robert Harling's script revels in the absurd idiosyncrasies
of life in a small town.</P>
<P>        STEEL MAGNOLIAS is a movie of minor miracles, not the least of
which is a shockingly good performance by Daryl Hannah, who is usually my
least favorite actress on the planet.  Hannah plays the new girl in town,
and her schizophrenic character starts out as a timid nerd with funny
glasses and evolves into a kooky, born-again, religious fanatic with funny
glasses.  Maybe Hollywood executives will now finally realize that they've
been miscasting Hannah all these years.  Forget the glamor roles; give this
babe the weirdo parts!</P>
<P>        Regrettably, Hannah and her "sisters" are merely caricatures.  You
don't know them intimately, and consequently, the dramatic moments just
don't ring true.  The tear-jerking gets completely out of hand during the
climactic funeral scene: the emotions seem forced as Fields alternates
between gushing tears and hysterical laughter.  Fortunately, the movie's
comic undercurrent resurfaces just in time to rescue us from the jaws of
melodrama.</P>
