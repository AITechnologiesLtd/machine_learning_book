<P>     Take a deep breath and prepare to suspend your disbelief, because
in bringing us this summer's first (and probably only) pure action
film, Jean-Claude Van Damme and John Woo have given new meaning to the
word "preposterous."</P>
<P>     Chance Boudreaux (Van Damme) is a down-on-his-luck ex-merchant
marine who got blacklisted after dumping a drug-smuggling captain
overboard.  Now, he's forced to eek out a living doing whatever odd
jobs he can find on the docks and streets of New Orleans.  One day, he
spies a lady in distress (Yancy Butler) and, using his rather
impressive kick-boxing techniques, rescues her from a gang of would-be
muggers (and rapists?).  In return, she offers him a job:  help her
find her father, a homeless vet who has disappeared.  What Natasha and
Chance's search turns up, however, turns out to be a dark and deadly
secret that makes them the prey in a vicious cat-and-mouse game run by
the evil and ruthless Fouchon (Lance Henriksen).</P>
<P>     HARD TARGET is, in essence, an example of the victory of style
over substance.  When it comes to the "typical" criteria by which a
film is judged, this movie fails badly.  Its characters are
poorly-developed, the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity, and the
acting, at best, is well over-the-top.  Nevertheless, on the most
basic, visceral level, the film succeeds.</P>
<P>     Those who went to LAST ACTION HERO and left disappointed because
they expected a straight action film, will likely accord redemption to
the summer of '93 because of HARD TARGET.  Albeit with a thinner plot,
this is the kind of no-holds-barred chase, fight, and shoot-out picture
that has become a Schwarzenegger staple.  Van Damme has an accent, the
charisma, the physique, and the lack of acting skills.  Really, unless
you're paying the check, it's hard to tell the difference.</P>
<P>     At the helm of HARD TARGET is John Woo, who is
internationally-known for not pulling punches when it comes to violence
(the two films he is best known for are THE KILLER and HARD BOILED).
Indeed, he doesn't merely direct this movie, he choreographs it,
turning simple fight sequences into ballets of bloodshed.  It's
compelling, albeit a little disconcerting, to see violence so lovingly
and carefully photographed.  HARD TARGET isn't some hack job--a lot of
effort went into crafting the picture.  Snipped and put back together
to avoid an NC-17, the film still offers a lot of mayhem and murder.
It would have been interesting to see the cut that represented Woo's
initial vision.</P>
<P>     There is perhaps a little too much slow-motion photography, and
the score, while capturing the flavor of Louisiana, often becomes
intrusive.  Early in the film, it seems that every time we're treated
to a shot of Van Damme, he's walking towards us in slow-motion with his
overcoat flapping in the breeze while an unnecessary blast of music
blares from the theater speakers.</P>
<P>     The first half of the film occasionally slows up for some silly
exposition, but by the mid-point, the hunt is underway, and it's all
action from there.  If, by five minutes into the movie, you haven't put
your brain into park, this is going to seem like an utterly ridiculous
effort.  Those who are willing to get into the spirit are in for a
roller-coaster ride directed by a master and acted by someone who knows
how to kick higher than most people can jump.</P>
<P>     I'm not going to say much about the plot, because it's far too
contrived to be worth mentioning.  Suffice it to say that if the
success of HARD TARGET depended on it, the movie would be sunk.  Even
for the action-oriented film-goer, there are a few moments too hard to
swallow (where's the "S" on Van Damme's chest?).  If nothing else,
they're good for comic relief which, fortunately (or should I say
"hopefully") seems to be Woo's intent.</P>
<P>     Lance Henriksen enjoys himself immensely.  He's fun to watch, but
he goes so far over-the-top that I'm not sure it would be justified to
call what he does a "performance".  Regardless, he provides an
excellent and much-needed counterpoint to Van Damme's ho-hum
delivery.  The hero, after all, is good with his kicks and punches, but
not his lines.  Yancy Butler does a poor job, even considering the
company she keeps.  Someone who can make Van Damme look like a drama
school graduate really needs to take some acting lessons (although,
admittedly, there's a scene with a snake where she's fantastic).  And
couldn't they have gotten someone a little more lively than Wilford
Brimley for Chance's lunatic uncle?</P>
<P>     Anyway, you pretty much get the idea.  Without the elegant
technique of John Woo, HARD TARGET could have been a real dud.  It is
not a good alternative to more intelligent thrillers such as IN THE
LINE OF FIRE and THE FUGITIVE, but that's not the market it's aimed
at.  However, those that enter a darkened theater showing this film
with a reasonable idea of what they're getting themselves into, are
likely to emerge satisfied.</P>
