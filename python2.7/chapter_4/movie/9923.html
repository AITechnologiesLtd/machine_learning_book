<PRE>THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE   </PRE>
<PRE> By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Warner Bros./ Regency Enterprises
 Director:  Mon Amiel
 Writer:  Robert Farrar, Howard Franklin
 Cast: Bill Murray, Peter Gallagher, Joanne Whalley,
Richard Wilson</PRE>
<P>   If "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is "Gone with
the Wind" on mescaline, then "The Man Who Knew Too Little"
might be called "Austin Powers" on Seconal.  "The Man Who
Knew Too Little" is embraced by the camp-spy subgenre of
film, a category so broad that it includes not only the usual
suspects like 007 but even allegedly serious cloak-and-dagger
tales like "The Jackal," which are so overblown that they
traverse the boundary into spoof.</P>
<P>   The major plus of "The Man Who Knew Too Little" is Bill
Murray, one of the funniest comedians around, a man who
has carved a special niche by understated humor.  Rejecting
the flamboyance of a Mike Myers, Murray evokes laughs
largely by playing the guy without a clue, an innocent who is
not so much dumb as he is unaware.  While his current movie
is a drawn-out, one-joke affair based on Murray's
obliviousness, the funniest scene--one which will be
appreciated by those in his mostly youthful audience who
have traveled to other countries--occurs near the beginning. 
When Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray), a Blockbuster Video
salesclerk from Des Moines, Iowa, arrives at a London airport,
he chats up the man at passport control as though the
bureaucrat were an old friend.  "Charming accent--are you
from around here?" he asks naively, in a barrage of
commentary that results in his being the agent's only
customer of the day.</P>
<P>   After that scene, it's pretty much downhill as Ritchie
proceeds from event to incident.  The single-joke concept
begins when Ritchie shows up by surprise at the London
home of his very successful brother James (Peter Gallagher)
on the very day that James is to make a presentation before
a group of German executives.  Eager to get the bumpkin out
of his way at least until the evening is over, James buys
Ritchie a ticket to a Performance Theater event, in which the
patron interacts with the performers at a murder mystery,
improvising his own dialogue.  When Ritchie answers a pay
phone call giving him an assignment, he thinks it's part of the
game and plays along, involving himself unwittingly in a plot
by British and Russian agents who are planting a bomb at a
state dinner in order to sabotage the signing of a peace treaty
between Britain and Russia.</P>
<P>   Taken from a novel by Robert Farrar who, along with
Howard Franklin has adapted the story to the screen, "The
Man Who Knew Too Little" is directed as a laid-back piece by
Jon Amiel--with thoroughly restrained buffoonery.  If the
humor is British, it is not of the Monty Python variety--even
the usually hilarious Alfred Molina is toned down in the role of
Boris the butcher, a guy who appears too gentle to have
decapitated one of his victims.  </P>
<P>   If the airport scene is the unwitting comic highlight of the
film, the physical comedy reaches its peak with a merely
whimsical Russian dance which finds Mr. Murray imitating the
steps of the professional troupe which surrounds him,
providing entertainment for the diplomats who are about to
initial the new treaty.  While Murray is at his best in roles
involving his simply responding to the provocations of others,
"The Man Who Knew Too Little" needs to cut its supporting
actors more rope.  They are people who lampoon too little.
Rated PG.  Running Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
