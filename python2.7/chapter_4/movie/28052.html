Exit Wounds (2001) 1 star out of 4. Starring Steven Seagal, DMX, Isaiah
Washington, Jill Hennessy, Michael Jai White, Anthony Anderson, Bill
Duke and Bruce McGill. Screenplay by Ed Horowitz and Richard D'Ovidio.
Based on a novel by John Westermann. Directed by Andrzej Barttkowiak.
Rated R.</P>
<P> If you have low or no expectations when going to see Exit Wounds, then
you wonít be disappointed.</P>
<P> Keep in mind, it stars Steven Seagal, which means there is little
acting, but lots of explosions, vehicular mayhem, thousands of rounds of
ammunition spent and a body count that dwarfs the Civil War.</P>
<P> In this outing, Seagal is Orin Boyd, a Detroit cop. And guess what?
Heís a loose cannon, a lone wolf, ìThe Lone Ranger.î Yep, heís the
clichéd cop who doesnít play by the rules.</P>
<P> Exit Wounds is a confusing mess dealing with heroin and crooked cops.
Along the way, of course, the requisite amount of double crosses occur.</P>
<P> But it is easy to tell whoís on which side of the law merely by
checking the cast list. Supporting Seagal are DMX, Isaiah Washington,
Jill Hennessy, Michael Jai White, Bill Duke and Bruce McGill.</P>
<P> To show the caliber of this movie, Tom Arnold tags along as the comedy
relief.</P>
<P> Nothing that happens in Exit Wounds is unexpected. It is as if
scriptwriters Ed Horowitz and Richard DíOvidio fed the story parameters
into a computer and it spit out a script.</P>
<P> Overall, Exit Wounds is schlock, B-movie escapism. Go in expecting
nothing and you wonít be disappointed.</P>
