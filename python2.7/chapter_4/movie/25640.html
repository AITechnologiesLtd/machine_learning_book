<PRE>Big Momma's House </PRE>
<P>Martin Lawrence stars as an FBI agent who must go undercover as a 350-pound 
southern woman in order
to catch an escaped bank robber by watching over the criminal's ex-lover (the 
woman's grand daughter). </P>
<P>Another typical mainstream comedy that uses some shock humor, wacky slapstick 
and rapid-fire dialogue.
Lawrence is actually likable here, he seems so relaxed and confident in drag. 
The story is practically
irrelevant since it has so little to do with what actually goes on during the 
film. It's just Lawrence being
funny in any way he can and for the most part it works. What's more, the film 
actually has some heart to it
and doesn't come off as totally cheesy. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B </PRE>
