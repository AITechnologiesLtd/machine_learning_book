<PRE>Stir Of Echoes **</PRE>
<P>rated R
Artisan Entertainment
99 minutes
starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Ileana Douglas, Liza Weil, Kevin
Dunn, Conor O'Farrell, Jenny Morrison, Zachary David Cope
based on the novel "A Stir Of Echoes" by Richard Matheson
written and directed by David Koepp</P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" is still racking up the dough at the box office, and
already we have a cheap rip off of it. However, David Koepp's "Stir Of
Echoes" doesn't fail merely because of its $250 million shadow. "Stir
Of Echoes" fails because it's a poor effort by everyone involved.</P>
<P>Well, David Koepp has scripted some of the major blockbusters of all
time ("Jurassic Park", "Men In Black") and from what I've heard, his
directorial debut, "The Trigger Effect", was a fine, if underrated,
film. But "Stir Of Echoes", adapted from the cult classic novel by
Richard Matheson, takes none of the risks that the overrated "Sixth
Sense" does.</P>
<P>Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is an "ordinary" construction worker in
Chicago who writes music in his spare time. He has a fine relationship
with his wife, Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and his quiet son Jake (Zachary
David Cope). But one night, his sister in law (Ileana Douglas), an
amateur hypnotist, hypnotizes him at his request. The hypnosis sends
him on a downward spiral, and she opens up parts of his mind that were
closed before.</P>
<P>Tom starts to see things; quick flashes of dead bodies, fingers
falling off, and other stuff like that. His son calmly assures him
that everything will be alright, and it is then that Tom realizes that
Jake sees these things, and he speaks with them too. What are these
things? Dead people, of course. Little boys in movies never "see dead
people", right? Uh-huh.</P>
<P>Coincidentally, it turns out that these dead people are merely trying
to communicate something to someone in the real world. Tom and Jake's
"mission" is to help a dead girl named Samantha (Jenny Morrison) get
in touch with her family (her sister is played by Liza Weil, the
amazing young actress from "Whatever") so that they can figure out why
she has been "missing" for the past few months.</P>
<P>At the start, the setup isn't that bad, but then, the filmmakers
decide to have the film self destruct in five seconds. And self
destruct it does. "Stir Of Echoes" turns from promising thriller to B
horror movie pulp. Kevin Bacon's Tom becomes some sort of a madman and
the film spins wildly out of control.</P>
<P>"Stir Of Echoes" may look and sound like "The Sixth Sense", but it
feels like a spoof. Kevin Bacon is gritty and tough as nails, but he
just doesn't cut it as a leading man. I hate to bash child actors, but
Zachary David Cope has none of Haley Joel ("Sixth Sense") Osment's
guts, and neither does the film itself.</P>
<P>I know it's unfair to compare the two films, since "Stir Of Echoes"
was probably made before "Sixth Sense", but when you see movies with
such similar plotlines, it's hard to resist. "Stir Of Echoes" is
watchable most of the time, but David Koepp seems to have learned a
little too much from the disaster movies he's used to writing. He
directs this low budget film as if it's an action extravaganza,
especially during the wildly preposterous ending.</P>
<P>While "Sixth Sense" at least made its conflict believable, "Stir Of
Echoes" just seems to be along for the ride. Instead of being scary,
it's just downright disturbing. Towards the end, the film becomes
laughably bad, which is fun in an "Evil Dead" kind of way, but when
Kevin Bacon and his son start digging in their backyard because a
movie screen told him to, I have to draw the line. I'm giving "Stir Of
Echoes" an undeserving two stars, but only because I may have enjoyed
it more had I seen it a couple months ago. How sad.</P>
