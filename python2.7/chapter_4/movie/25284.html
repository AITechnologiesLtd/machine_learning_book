<PRE>"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" -- The
Original Show Had More Charm, Dahlink
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Somewhere in the back of my mind, in a rarely visited
location where cartoon characters that I have grown to
love but am now too old to remember, there resides a
flying squirrel and a likably dimwitted moose.  Known
as Rocky and Bullwinkle, their show was a crudely
drawn but lively post-Cold War adventure that pitted
these two against the evil machinations of three
scoundrels named Boris Badinov, Natasha, and their
fearless leader named Fearless Leader.  There was a
charming quirkiness to their episodes, which were
brutally inane and featured sharp puns and rapid-fire
humor.  It possessed a shallowness that was just right
for Saturday morning mindless fare.</P>
<P>It's now three decades later.  Rocky hasn't flown in
years.  Bullwinkle laments about the disappearing
woodlands throughout his home of Frostbite Falls.  And
our three villains are trapped in an endless cycle of
reruns.  But in the world of cartoons, anything is
possible.  Fearless Leader literally reaches out to a
hungry movie executive to ink a movie deal.  Suddenly,
the three of them emerge as flesh-and-blood people
(Jason Alexander as Boris, Renee Russo as Natasha, and
Robert DeNiro as Fearless Leader).  Free of their
two-dimensional cartoon world and from Rocky and
Bullwinkle, they now see an opportunity to hatch their
latest plan to rule the world.</P>
<P>Fearless Leader and his band begin to build a
television cable empire called RBTV (Really Bad
Television).  It will be filled with programs that are
so bad that the viewing audience will be turned into
zombies susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  The
public will be told go out and vote in Fearless Leader
as the new President in the next election.  This is a
plan worthy of Pinky and the Brain (you know, one is a
genius and the other's insane).</P>
<P>Out to stop them is FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper
Perabo) who is a soft, squishy, lovey-dovey,
idealistic kind of gal.  She enlists the help of Rocky
(voiced, as in the original, by June Foray) and
Bullwinkle (voiced by Keith Scott), and together, they
try to save the world.  Their travels are filled with
absurd occurrences and pun-filled banter.  At one
point when the three are being approached by a group
of security guards, Sympathy yells, "we've got to get
out of here," to which Bullwinkle says, "OK, let's go
to a commercial!"  We see signs that point out places
such as the Crimea River, and we pay a visit to
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wossamotta U.   All of this
silliness is fine up to a certain point, which is
about the first 20 minutes.  However, the novelty soon
wears thin.</P>
<P>Give credit, though, to the live cast members and all
of the cameos who deliver over-the-top acting to lend
to its cartoonish personality.  Especially good is
DeNiro who seemed to be having endless fun as Fearless
Leader.  He speaks with an almost-impenetrable accent
and even takes a turn at parodying the "you looking at
me" line made famous from his role in "Taxi Driver." </P>
<P>Alas, "Rocky and Bullwinkle" just doesn't give even
the inner child in us enough to sustain an 85-minute
film.  The story just doesn't go anywhere and we start
to wonder if we're watching one of Fearless Leader's
RBTV programs.  There's a scene in this film that
pretty much sums up the film's viewing experience.  At
Wossamotta U., students are protesting during a speech
given by Bullwinkle.  However, his speech is so inane
that students find that they had nothing to object to.
 It's equally loony yet insipid, hollow yet harmless.</P>
