<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Several months ago, I received a note from one of my movie sage
   friends advising me to keep an eye out for Don Roos' feature film
   debut, THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.  "It's your type of film," he cryptically
   advised without elaborating further, leaving me to wonder exactly
   what this comment implied about the film, and moreover, about my
   perceived tastes in general.  As the film completed its festival
   circuit and began to roll out in limited release, I solicited further
   opinions from trusted friends in New York and Los Angeles, who all
   agreed it was a worthwhile watch.</P>
<P>   So I found myself settling expectantly into a theatre seat at a
   recent screening of the film, and it didn't take long -- oh, about
   five minutes -- for me to see their point: I relished the wicked
   black comedy that opened THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, which sees our lead
   character preparing for a somber funeral appearance by tweaking at
   her nipples through the fabric of her dress, followed by paying her
   final respects to the deceased by tossing her lit cigarette, rocks,
   and everything else on hand at the lowered casket.</P>
<P>   Our lead character is Dedee Truitt (a blonde Christina Ricci), the
   most deliciously vile antiheroine in an American film since Laura
   Dern's title character in Alexander Payne's CITIZEN RUTH.  This
   cheerfully nasty sixteen-year old doubles as both protagonist and
   self-conscious narrator (her knowing voice-overs freely admit she's
   aware that she's in a movie), and after trashing her late
   stepfather's funeral, Dedee runs away from her Louisiana home to
   impose herself on her estranged, much-older half-brother Bill (Martin
   Donovan), who leads an unassuming life as a schoolteacher.  Bill,
   who's the sort of low-key person that checks rude washroom graffiti
   for grammatical errors, is openly gay (or "homo", as Dedee puts it),
   and lives with a handsome young man named Matt (Ivan Sergei) in a
   spacious house left by Bill's previous companion, Tom (or "the dead
   guy", as Dedee puts it -- yup, she's a little sweetheart), who passed
   away from AIDS.  Tom's spinster sister, Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), who
   obviously carries a torch for Bill, teaches at the same school and
   frequently drops in on the proceedings.  Surely enough, Dedee soon
   wreaks havoc in this sleepy Indiana suburb by bullying the
   simple-minded Matt into bedding her, announcing her pregnancy, and
   promptly absconding with Bill's life savings, Matt, and Tom's ashes,
   sending Bill and Lucia in hot pursuit.</P>
<P>   Mr. Roos, a veteran screenwriter whose credits feature strong female
   characters in films such as SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (Bridget Fonda and
   Jennifer Jason Leigh), LOVE FIELD (Michelle Pfeiffer's
   Oscar-nominated turn), and BOYS ON THE SIDE (Drew Barrymore, Whoopi
   Goldberg and Mary-Louis Parker), predictably has a sure hand with his
   fascinating female characters in his directorial debut, but the
   film's sketchier male characters are much less interesting.  Dedee is
   a wonderfully awful creature -- the film suffers during the often
   too-long periods when she's offscreen -- and Lucia is imbued with an
   observant, lashing tongue and a semblance of actual character
   complexity; none of the men are nearly as compelling.</P>
<P>   The great strength of THE OPPOSITE OF SEX are the terrific nasty
   one-liners which freely zing back and forth, mostly from the mouths
   of its two major female characters, although everybody gets into the
   act to some degree.  The film's screenplay doesn't play it safe; it
   offends with utter abandon, and many of the barbs are such
   perfectly-timed, wicked little gems that one gets the feeling that
   Mr. Roos has been accumulating these clever rejoinders and memorable
   witticisms for just the opportune occasion.  Many of the lines are
   so funny that it comes as a bit of a shame that the film's plot isn't
   as sharp, particularly the final third which lacks the flair and bite
   of the opening reels and builds to a conclusion which seems unearned.
   The film is at its best during its opening half, unspooling as an
   acerbic, pitch black comic romp.</P>
<P>   Gleefully rotten, unapologetically rude and self-absorbed, moonfaced
   Ms. Ricci has already assembled a sizable list of similarly sarcastic
   characters in her filmography, and she's perfectly cast here in the
   showy role of bitchy sexpot Dedee.  Also impressive is Ms. Kudrow,
   who continues to emerge as an interesting actress and demonstrates
   great comic timing in a more deadpan role.  Her feature film
   performances over the past few years has been consistently more
   unique and skilled than any of her FRIENDS castmates.</P>
<P>   One of the more interesting aspects of THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is its
   propensity to deconstruct itself via Dedee's cynical, mocking
   narration.  "If you think I'm just plucky and scrappy and all I need
   is love, you're in over your head," she warns at the outset.  It's an
   odd narrative approach which, while occasionally grating, is often
   refreshing.  Consider her voice-over accompanying the film's
   obligatory Sad Montage, which invariably takes place at about the
   midpoint of a given movie, and in this case features a forlorn Bill
   mournfully brooding, stopping only to wistfully sniff at his lover's
   T-shirt.  Traditionally hokey stuff, to be sure -- but as Dedee
   points out, it's better than showing Bill paying his bills.</P>
