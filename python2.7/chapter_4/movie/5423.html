<PRE>                                  SHOWGIRLS
                       A film review by Jeffrey Haber
                        Copyright 1996 Jeffrey Haber</PRE>
<PRE>     * (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>     "Showgirls" is the first big-budget, big-studio film to receive an
NC-17 rating.  And its release last year came at a time when Senator 
Bob Dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for
promoting sex and violence.  But if "Showgirls" is any indication of
Hollywood's future, the folks in Washington should focus their attack
on a more dangerous threat to American values--bad moviemaking.</P>
<P>     "Showgirls" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the Las Vegas strip
scene, and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter.
Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas, who collaborated on 
another shock-value project, 1992's "Basic Instinct," follow the plight
of a young woman (teen TV star Elizabeth Berkley) determined to make a 
name for herself as a topless dancer.  It's a hackneyed premise to begin
with, so not surprisingly, all of the stock characters are trucked out.
There's the Demanding Producer.  The Loyal Friend.  The Bitchy Competitor.
Lest I forget the Scummy Club Owner.</P>
<P>     Of course, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline
is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade
of full-frontal nudity.  Unfortunately, "Showgirls" doesn't satisfy in this
department.  Verhoeven's slam-bang, in-your-face style of direction proves
neither arousing nor erotic.  To make matters worse, you'll be forced to 
sit through the movie's clothed scenes, which don't cover up for laughable
acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history.</P>
<P>     Verhoeven and Ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground, but
if it's adult entertainment you want, stay home and watch the Playboy Channel.
You'll be the wiser for it.</P>
