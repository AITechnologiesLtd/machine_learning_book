<PRE>Instinct: people in the mist</PRE>
<P>In comic books, when you go live with the animals for a couple of years you
come back a super-hero; in Instinct, that's half the case: 'Ape-man' Dr.
Ethan Powell (silverback Anthony Hopkins) does come back from the Rwandan
jungle with 'super' powers---an animal ferocity--but, as he's in the land of
men now, society locks him up in a maximum-security prison. Caging the beast
is what civilization's all about, after all. Of course, however, behind bars
is exactly where we like to see Anthony Hopkins, too, simply on the
off-chance that we might get a repeat performance of his Hannibal Lecter
role. And we're not wholly disappointed: to a certain extent, there is some
repetition going on--some of the quid pro quo we know and need--but it's not
so much Silence of the Lambs-derived as it is simply a staple of the
psychiatrist (interviewer, etc) / patient dynamic, as it's been hammered out
in movies like Dead Man Walking, True Crime, or, getting out of maximum
security for a moment, Good Will Hunting and Sixth Sense.</P>
<P>Perhaps most vital to that dynamic, too, is the 'surprise' reversal--that
the doctor's really the patient here, that the patient knows more than the
doctor, has whatever that doctor's been desperately needing. In Instinct,
that doctor is Theo Calder ('Calder' as in caldera, volcanic, intense; Cuba
Gooding, Jr.), a young, ambitious psychiatrist who sets himself the task of
playing Doolittle to the Ape-man--getting Powell to break his Kong-like
silence and talk, talk, talk. It can't be easy, though. Not only does Calder
have to feel his way through Powell's various mental defenses, he also has
to keep one hand free to fend off the prison bureaucracy, which doesn't
really care who gets healed, so long as precious order is maintained. If
this were a crime-movie, the warden and co. would be the police department,
doing everything in their power to keep the honest detective from solving
his case.</P>
<P>As far as set-up goes, all this is fine so far, but the thing with Instinct
is that it never really gets past the set-up stage, never really establishes
some problem that can be somehow resolved at the end of two hours. Which of
course makes it all feel pretty muddled. And yes, Calder's mission to get
Powell to talk is likely meant to be that problem, but A) Powell starts
talking so soon; and B) as far as problems go, this one feels suspiciously
not so much integral to the narrative as integral to the 'movie,' which is
to say Calder's mission becomes simply a contrivance to get Powell's story
on-screen. It is, however--and in spite of the sappy music--a touching story
(Connery's Medicine Man morphing into a latterday Tarzan), but too, if
you've ever seen Bambi you know how these idyllic flashbacks have to end. In
addition, Instinct does have some nice Kurtz-stuff going on, with Powell
leading Calder deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness, but it kind of
gets muted by the Free Willy stuff that eventually comes into play
(releasing the 'animal' back into the wild, etc). And the high points, as
you expect and pay for, are of course everytime Powell goes Ape. Yes,
Hannibal Lecter would likely eat Powell's liver with fava beans, but still,
and in spite of his initial sideshow attraction, Powell is another good
Hopkins performance, if only because he never goes Greystoke--never roars
and sniffs the ladies--and thus Instinct, while occasionally muddled, is
still watchable. And if the Bambi scene doesn't get to you, check your
humanity, you may be running a little low.</P>
