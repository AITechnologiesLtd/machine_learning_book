<PRE>                          WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Some movies are not what they seem to be.  WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY
(CHACUN CHERCHE SON CHAT) is one such film.  Although on the surface it
is a mystery about the search for a lost feline, in reality, it has
only marginal sympathy for the missing animal.  The story, written and
directed by Cedric Klapisch, uses the disappearance as a ruse to take
the viewers on a neighborhood tour of Paris.</P>
<P>     Klapisch's storytelling style borrows heavily from the great Eric
Rohmer, whose last picture released in the United States was the
beautiful, episodic RENDEZVOUS IN PARIS.  Klapisch has mastered the
form of a Rohmer film, but lacks Rohmer's gift for the narrative.
Klapisch's plot has the same wide variety of characters, but Rohmer's
are more compelling.</P>
<P>     As the story starts, a young Parisian named Chloe has a
predicament.  She is going on vacation and needs someone to look after
her cat, Gris-Gris, while she is away.  Garance Clavel plays Chloe with
such big, soulful eyes that it is hard to see how anyone would turn her
down.</P>
<P>     Chloe lives in the apartment of a gay man named Michel, played
rather insufferably by Olivier Py.  Although Michel claims to be her
friend, he says she should just put the cat in a bag and abandon it
somewhere.  (In a film nominally about cats there are several such
cruel references to them.)  Michel will do nothing to help the animal
that has been living under his roof.</P>
<P>     Chloe finds an old woman who keeps cats and who would be happy to
look after hers as well.  In fact, the old woman prefers cats to men.
"Men have let me down, but animals, never.  Never!" says Madame Renee,
played by local resident and non-actress Renee Le Calm as a feisty old
woman in her eighties.</P>
<P>     After a vacation concisely summarized by a five second shot of her
in the ocean, Chloe returns to find that Madame Renee no longer has her
cat.  A window was accidentally left open, and Gris-Gris has
disappeared.</P>
<P>     This early plot device of a truant cat launches the body of the
story.  Chloe enlists a host of local residents in her search.  The men
scour the small streets of Paris with her, and a network of older women
form a telephone chain to communicate the results of their search.
Easily the best visual in the show has the camera flitting back and
forth from one rooftop to the next as the old women plan their watch
with military precision.  The scene is reminiscent of the one in which
the cat is trailed in THAT DARN CAT.</P>
<P>     Soon, however, the cat becomes less and less important.  The story
gets wrapped up in all of the relationships that Chloe establishes with
her neighbors.</P>
<P>     A subplot deals with the destruction of the old Paris to make way
for the new.  A building is shown being demolished, and half of the
people seem to be in the process of being evicted from their
apartments.</P>
<P>     If, like I, you are able to guess the resolution of the missing
cat mystery, it will not detract from the story.  The movie's interest
lies strictly in the people Chloe meets.  Rohmer could have found her
some more interesting ones, but the ones she does run into possess a
certain charm.</P>
<P>     WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY runs 1:36.  It is rated R for profanity and an
explicit sexual scene.  (The Parisians in the film seem to smoke, drink
and breathe in about equal proportions.)  The picture would be fine for
mature teenagers.  I give this delicate film thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
