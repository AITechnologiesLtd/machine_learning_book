<P>Plot: Philosophy student Kathleen Conklin is bitten by and transformed 
into a vampire. As she succumbs to the vampiric urges she comes to 
understand that the vampire is really a mirror of the cruelty and 
violence that is at the heart of human nature.</P>
<P>The concept of the vampire was inherited into Western popular culture 
via Bram Stoker's `Dracula'. As a result of Stoker's legacy the vampire 
has always been rooted in Christian concepts of good and evil with the 
vampire representing an animal sexuality hidden beneath the decorum of 
mannered society being despatched by confident men who stride a resolute 
line between science and religion. The cinematic vampire was popularized 
by the Bela Lugosi ‘Dracula' in 1931 and the hundreds of vampire films 
that have followed since have almost all fallen into this symbolic 
resonance. But in the 1970s and 80s the vampire film began to abandon 
classical notions of good and evil. Firstly it was the tacit recognition 
of films like ‘Count Yorga, Vampire' (1970), `Dracula A.D. 1972' (1972), 
`Blacula' (1972) and `Love at First Bite' (1979) that the Victorian 
trappings of the vampire film only had limited potential and that the 
vampire in cape and dinner-suit cut a rather absurd, unthreatening 
figure when brought into the present.</P>
<P>In the 1980s and beyond, the vampire film began to implicitly accept the 
death of the traditional reason and religion vs bestial nature dualism. 
But ironically instead of dying out the vampire film began to flourish 
more than ever before. The resulting films could be thrown into three 
rough categories - those which overtly spoofed and parodied the 
traditional vampire (the likes of ‘Dracula: Dead and Loving It', `I 
Bought a Vampire Motorcycle', `Vampire Trailer Park') or conducted 
generic pastiches (ie vampire cop show - tv's `Forever Knight', vampire 
getaway film - `From Dusk Till Dawn', vampire mafia - `Innocent Blood'). 
Or else those films which dragged the vampire into the modern world and 
transformed the character into a kind of badass punk - `The Lost Boys', 
`Near Dark', `Blade'. And thirdly those which inverted the metaphors of 
Bram Stoker about sexual repression to turn vampirism into a kind of 
dark, sensual forbidden romance - the `Graveyard Shift' films, `Bram 
Stoker's Dracula', `To Die For', `The Nosferatu Diaries: Embrace of the 
Vampire'.</P>
<P>The rarest among the new vampire films have been those which have sought 
to reinvent and question the metaphors of vampirism. The first film to 
try this was ‘Incense for the Damned' aka `Bloodsuckers' (1969) which 
ambitiously tried to develop vampirism as a metaphor for sexual 
impotency.  But the film that really succeeded here was the exceptional 
`Martin' (1976) which pared all classical mythology away with rather 
startling effect - contrasting a pallid and weak bloodsucker up against 
his family who insisted with absurdly cruel inappropriateness on 
classical religious symbolism. Other notable examples might be the 
German film ‘Jonathan' (1970) which transformed vampirism into a 
metaphor for Nazism and feudalism and the underrated ‘Interview with the 
Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles' (1994) which conducted an elegant 
vampiric existential quest with the hero setting out with the question 
if he is not evil, what then is the purpose of his condition.</P>
<P>`The Addiction' is another of these rare attempts at re-evaluation. The 
film was directed by Abel Ferrara, who has made the likes of `Driller 
Killer' (1979), `Ms. 45' (1980), `Bad Lieutenant' (1992) and `Body 
Snatchers' (1993). Throughout almost all of Ferrara and his writing 
partner Nicholas St John's work lie twin themes - a fascination with the 
darkest depths that the human soul is capable of scouring and the belief 
in the redemptive power of Catholicism. These twin fascinations find 
their most potent expression in `Bad Lieutenant' - a muck-scouring 
excoriation of human degradation that eventually finds Catholic 
redemption in the forgiving of a killer. And in some ways `The 
Addiction' is almost like a reiteration of `Bad Lieutenant'  with Lili 
Taylor's vampire philosophy doctorate in the place of Harvey Keitel's 
drugged-out, woebegone cop,  conducting in philosophical terms the same 
descent into all that is vile before finding its salvation.</P>
<P>`The Addiction' has a tendency to make one feel like they are being hit 
over the head by the collected works of Western nihilist philosophy. The 
film quotes Sartre and Kierkegaard and engages in debates about 
determinism and redemption through guilt while Ferrara-regular 
Christopher Walken turns up as a vampire who sees himself as an avatar 
of Nietzschean meta-morality. It is quite the weightiest film that one 
has seen in some time. But at the same time Ferrara and St John turn it 
into an extraordinary meditation on human nature and its fundamental 
predisposition toward evil. They see the vampire as a complex metaphor 
for an evil that is endemic to human nature. "The old saying that `Those 
who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it' is a lie," 
meditates Taylor. "The real question is what can be done to stop the 
blight spreading." The film bombards one with images of Me Lei and the 
Holocaust - in the opening scene alone Taylor exits a Holocaust museum 
and debates what the point is of convicting political leaders of war 
crimes when war crimes are crimes of mass guilt. The complexity of this 
metaphor leads to some startling reinventions of classical vampire 
mythology - the vampire cannot stand to look in a mirror because mirrors 
reflect the raw, exposed face of evil; the reason they are undead is 
because evil cannot die. Ferrera also offers up some strikingly modern 
images of vampirism - in one scene Taylor shooting up blood with a 
syringe like an addict. Although after conducting such an extraordinary 
and gloomily bleak excavation of the human condition, Taylor and 
Ferrara's acceptance of the redeeming power of Catholicism at the end 
seems a little glib and even cursory.</P>
<P>In the end it is not the best of Ferrara's films. The philosophical 
heaviness of it stands in the way of easy entertainment value and some 
corner-cutting lower-budget values are apparent at times. But what 
cannot be denied is that it is a powerful and complex reworking of the 
central metaphors of vampirism. Compare it to `Nadja' which was released 
only a few months after `The Addiction'. Both are very similar films - 
both are shot in black-and-white and both feature a predatory female 
vampire stalking the modern world.  But whereas `Nadja' was merely 
content with conducting a stylistic pastiche of `Dracula's Daughter' 
(1936), `The Addiction' tackles the challenge of mounting an entire 
philosophical reconception of vampirism.</P>
