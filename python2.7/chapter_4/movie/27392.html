<P>   I have a pal, real nice fellow (call him Pete), who could
easily pass for the all-American guy except that he's pro-Fidel
Castro...thinks everything in Cuba would be just swell except
that the American embargo keeps that island nation
oppressed.  During the election campaign just passed, I
asked him how he could justify Castro's remaining in power
without opposition for the past forty-one years, reaching fpr
Queen Victoria's record and for the tenure of some pharaoh
or other while in our democracy we have elections every two
years, four years, six years. He replied that the U.S. has a
government just as permanent as Fidel's and what's more
this immutable power structure is far more reaching and
undemocratic than anything you can find in Havana.  Invoking
former President Eisenhower who warned against the
military-industrial complex, he insists that all 281 million of
our residents are under the heel of the mega-corporations,
who control most important aspects of our lives to say
nothing of keeping the politicians dancing to their tune.  Is it
any wonder that Pete loved Peter Howitt's movie "AntiTrust"? 
For "AntiTrust" (one of those titles with a double meaning, as
in "whom can you trust" and "hey that business of yours has
squashed all competition") is a warning to all of us that the 
corporate structure in the United States is going to control our
lives more than ever by dominating all aspects of
communication.  And what's more, a single company is going
to do this without the help of any rivals.</P>
<P>   If this scenario brings to mind the recent action of the
Justice Department against the giant Microsoft corporation
led by Bill Gates; and if Tim Robbins, who performs in the
role of Gary Winston, head of the cutthroat company NURV,
makes you think that we're already too late to head the
communications giant off at the pass--then Howitt, giving
scripter Howard Franklin's a taut, fast-paced and youthful
evocation of an information-age message monopolizer, is on
the money.  Despite some occasionally stiff acting and just a
smidgen of laughable dialogue, "AntiTrust" succeeds in
making its portentous meaning more than reasonably
entertaining.  While the danger sometimes facing the world of
computer geeks is not original--Irwin Winkler's 1995 movie
"The Net" featuring Sandra Bullock as a mousy computer
whiz whose identity is deleted by a group of weirdos more
interested in a disc than in discotheques--"AntiTrust" is the
first film that has ever represented sesame seeds as a
murder weapon.</P>
<P>   The movie centers on Milo (Ryan Philippe), a 23-year-old
man so brilliant that NURV's CEO Gary Winston (Tim
Robbins) counts on him to deliver a satellite-communications
breakthrough ahead of the competition.  He is given just
forty-two days to accomplish the task, which signals to us
that "AntiTrust" is going to have its characters racing against
the clock--which they do not just once or twice during the
film's 108 minutes.  Best friend Teddy (Yee Jee Tso) is angry
that Milo has even accepted a job with NURV and not
because of envy: Teddy opposes the corporate giant's
hegemony over so many aspects of communication because
he is idealistic enough to believe that human knowledge
belongs to all of us--it should be free--and Teddy remains in
the proverbial garage pounding out programs in his attempt
to break a code and deliver an information-age Shangri-La to
the world.  As Milo becomes suspicious of his boss' intentions
and methods and begins to realize that billionaire Gary
Winston may have bought off people in the Justice
Department and even placed a spy in his own home, he puts
his life in danger by working overtime to establish proof of his
impressions.</P>
<P>   Ryan Philippe looks "hot"--as the women in the critics'
audience seem to feel, or so I gather from the looks on their
faces. When not hititng the keyboard, the young thesp casts
sexy glances at his girl friend Alice (Claire Forlani) and flirts
with a strangely diffident coworker Lisa (Rachael Leigh Cook). 
Philippe turns in a convincing peerformance as a kid who
looks as though he's just started shaving but whose
cybergeek activities help him to save the world from a
corporate behemoth.  Tim Robbins is even better, given his
need to show us that his agenda as head of a Microsoft-style
business is in an ethical gray zone (if you can dismiss an
occasional murder ordered at his behest).  While he is
certainly rich enough to retire to his yacht and take things
easy, he gets his kicks from manipulating people and binary
numbers; donating millions of dollars to art museums and
thousands of computers to eager schoolchildren but also
engaging in nefarious plots to be the first to perform a major
communications breakthrough.  </P>
<P>   If the plot often seems to be as predictable as a computer
going about its tasks without making a single surprising
calculation, the movie itself adds up to an diverting vehicle. 
With pulsating music like "Son of Sam" and "Nietzsche"
pumping up the action and some cool effects by Metrolight
Studios spinning numbers across the screen, "AntiTrust" has
enough suspense and cybertalk and sesame seeds to allow
us to suspend disbelief, and could conceivably make Newt
Gingrich and Malcolm Forbes question the ethics of
capitalism for a couple of hours or so.</P>
