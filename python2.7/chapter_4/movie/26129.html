<PRE>                            THE ART OF AMÁLIA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I don't know Fado from Fabian, but I do know what makes a good
documentary.  Regardless of how flattering your opinion is of legendary
Portuguese singer Amália Rodrigues, you owe it to yourself to separate
her talents from the movie that documents them, because the film clearly
doesn't do her justice.</P>
<P>     The Art of Amália starts with promise, with ex-Talking Head David
Byrne waxing earnestly about when he first heard Rodrigues's music.  But
the film abruptly detours after that one minute, becoming a strictly
linear monologue telling the story her life.  The picture is more boring
than a history textbook.  Why?  Because little in Amália's life was or
is extraordinary.  We wander, year by year, from her early days as a
nightclub singer to her career in cinema to more singing to the many
awards she's won and finally... to more singing.  And poof, the story is
over.  Ready for The Madonna Story, anyone?</P>
<P>     If you think I'm just a naysayer, consider a film like Theremin: An
Electronic Odyssey, which documented the life of a musician but did it
with style, despite the fact that the audience had never heard of the
man.  Amália was never kidnapped in her sleep.  Amália was not in the
KGB.  Nothing much happened in her life that's film-worthy at all. 
Amália sang and she sang a lot.  And while she was very good at it, that
doesn't mean it makes a great film.</P>
<P>     Then again, neither do slow zooms on newspaper clippings,
advertisements bearing her name, and still photographs, plus interviews
with some of the most poorly-spoken people ever to grace the screen. 
The production values are nonexistent.  The narration is banal and
obvious.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, even big fans of Amália are going to be disappointed
with The Art of Amália, the sole bright spot being her Fado music, which
is heartfelt and tears at the soul.  Some 60 songs are rendered by her,
in whole or in part, throughout the 90-minute film, and they're
certainly pleasing to the ears... provided you're tuning out the rest of
the picture.</P>
