<P>The obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie
is to acquire continued profits. The rationale is sound, but in many
cases of this and recent years, the sequel is a shoddy product that's
exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is. Last year's SPEED 2
and SCREAM 2, as well as this year's SPECIES II have all been products
that have been decisively less than satisfactory. In some cases, a
sequel can even discredit its predecessor, as with the latest
neo-slasher flick, I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Whatever
uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when
paired with this abominable thriller. </P>
<P>Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.)
are back from the original to star in I STILL KNOW, reprising their
roles in typical fashion. Julie and Ray experience a rather predictable
falling-out at the beginning of the movie, leaving the door wide open
for newcomer Will Benson (Matthew Settle). Will and Julie hit it off,
and along with friends Karla (Brandy Norwood) and Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer),
the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the
tropics. Unfortunately, things aren't so peachy once they arrive, and
with a regularity you could set your watch by, the infamous fisherman
(Muse Watson) is back with his hook. It's another bloody showdown,
complete with cliffhanger ending. </P>
<P>There's not much that's original about I STILL KNOW, and with the market
saturated by Gen-X thrillers like this one, it's unlikely that I STILL
KNOW will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel. For
die-hard fans of the genre, this will be required viewing material, but
the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the
original I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. The aura of thrillerism
surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera
work, but rather a tense, string-based score and manipulative editing.
The man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around
when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from
being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments. </P>
<P>Much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point. The
whole reason the plot exists - Julie and Karla must guess the capital of
Brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead
giveaway, lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing
problem. And, whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in
the first movie, it's almost a given here, which changes the dynamic of
the movie drastically. Three or four teens run automatically from a man
in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "the killer." They're
almost used to it, and the performances show it - not Hewitt, nor
Prinze, nor Brandy, nor Phifer give a decent show. And so, in the end,
it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new
supporting cast. God help us.</P>
