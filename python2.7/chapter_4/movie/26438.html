"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>It's been 27 years since The Exorcist forever changed the nation's
perception of pea soup.  The film, which was nominated for 10 Oscars,
including Best Picture, Best Director and three acting roles (it won for
sound and screenplay), allegedly caused some people to flee theatres in
a horrified panic.  But since its theatrical release in 1973, The
Exorcist has only been seen via badly edited TV versions and fading,
crusty old copies of the videotape.  The fact that the film spawned two
lousy sequels (one from The General's John Boorman, and one from The
Exorcist's author and screenwriter William Peter Blatty) didn't help
either.</P>
<P>Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, The Exorcist has been
restored with a cleaned-up picture, completely overhauled sound and
about a dozen additional minutes that didn't appear in the original
version (although some were on a recently released DVD).  But one
lingering question remains – will viewers today be as affected by the
film as they were back in 1973?</P>
<P>The answer is probably not.  The screening I attended was plagued with
mocking laughter and people leaving out of sheer boredom.  I should
mention that the screening was sponsored by a local `modern rock'
station, and most of the crowd was made up of young men and women that
have been weaned on a steady diet of slasher flicks that prominently
feature a grisly murder before the opening credits roll.</P>
<P>What these little douche bags don't understand is that you don't need a
high body count, gallons of fake blood and things making you jump every
five minutes to make a suspenseful film.  In fact, that's the alluring
part of The Exorcist.  Director William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement)
paces the film so slowly, the ending almost becomes a reward in
patience.</P>
<P>Just take the opening scene, where Friedkin takes a brief, five-page
epilogue from the book and audaciously transforms it into a 12-minute
segment that has little to do with the rest of the film.  In it, we are
introduced to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow, Snow Falling on Cedars) an
elderly priest on an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.  He finds a
creepy idol (not unlike the one Greg had in The Brady Bunch's
multi-episode Hawaiian vacation) and begins to shake uncontrollably
while reaching for both the drink and his nitroglycerine pills.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, movie star Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, Requiem For a Dream)
and her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are temporarily living
in Georgetown while Chris shoots a film.  They rent a lovely home
(complete with a staff of three), but their lives are interrupted by a
demonic spirit that decides to take up residence in young Regan.
Thinking there is something physically wrong with her daughter, Chris
drags Regan to a bunch of clueless doctors that run a lot of pointless
tests before sending her off to a shrink.  It's really funny to watch
the doctors whip out cigarettes while they give cheesy explanations for
Regan's odd behavior (Ritalin is their treatment).  They blow smoke in
Chris' face while they blow smoke up her ass.</P>
<P>Looking for alternatives to medications and asylums, Chris turns to
Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, Rudy), a Jesuit priest and
psychiatrist struggling with his faith after the death of his mother.
Damian's freaky nightmare montage of his dead mother emerging from the
subway entrance is one of the best ever.</P>
<P>Friedkin takes his time developing the characters, which makes the
ending that much more emotional for the viewer.  It's over 30 minutes
before anything makes you jump, 45 before anything remotely supernatural
occurs, and an hour has passed before the real hijinks start.  The
spooky events are spaced far apart and grow more disturbing as the film
progresses.  You begin to dread each time Chris runs up the stairs and
into Regan's room.</P>
<P>Purportedly based on true events, The Exorcist was adapted from Blatty's
best-selling 1971 novel.  The film's acting, especially from Blair and
first-timer Miller, are fantastic.  At that year's Academy Awards, the
14-year-old Blair lost to 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal (Paper Moon).  The
redone sound is marvelous.  You can even hear the aquarium in Regan's
room, which is kind of exciting because you can barely tell she has an
aquarium in the tape at your local video store.</P>
<P>2:15 – R for adult language and violence</P>
