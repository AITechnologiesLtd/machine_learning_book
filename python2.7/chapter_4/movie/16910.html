<PRE>A REVIEW OF "OCTOBER SKY"
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>Pure honesty and boyish enthusiasm are two traits that far too
many films in this decade don't care to embrace. As a result,
recurring criticisms of countless pictures is that they're not
believable, they're unlikable, or the whole project is just plain
stupid. With all the mega-movies about disaster and imminent
death (which seems to automatically require a $50 million budget
for the outrageous special effects alone), the proverbial 'Little
Movie That Could' is often overwhelmed and forgotten by the
ticket buyers.</P>
<P>So, here comes "October Sky" with its message of dedication,
love, and hope. It's a good movie, and I don't mean that to
provide a bland analysis. I mean "good" in the sense that it's
got a good heart with wonderful intentions. There's no real
villain here or some higher goal to destroy people or things.
Sure, it has some special effects, but this is one time where
they help the story along, instead of dominating the dog-eared
script. Not once do you sit in the theatre mulling over how the
folks at Industrial Light and Magic did this or that. You're too
busy engrossed in the lives of the small town and its coal miner
mentalities.</P>
<P>Based on the book, "Rocket Boys" by Homer H. Hickam Jr., "October
Sky" chronicles the day-to-day hardships of Coalwood, West
Virginia. It's the fall in 1957 and Russia has just launched
"Sputnik" into orbit. Young nobody Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal,
who is earnest and well-cast) seems to be floating through life
until he sees the satellite shooting by their small community up
in the sky. He's captivated with the idea of getting into space
and rockets become his full-time passion. He and his chums, Roy
Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), make friends
with the town geek, Quentin (Chris Owen). The four boys
enthusiastically study and learn and fail in their attempts to
get a rocket to successfully shoot off into the wild blue yonder.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Homer's father, John (Chris Cooper), runs the town's
coal mine. Mining is his life and he thinks it should be Homer's
life, too. The obvious conflict is father vs. son, but it's also
about the desire to shoot for the heavens and keep out of the
ugly pit of hell--up vs. down. Now, that's not to say that John
Hickam is the devil. He's a hard man, but a good man. He treats
most people right, but he's tough on his family, especially the
passionate Homer. John is sternly against his son's hobby (or is
it an obsession?) and pushes him to get into the mining business.
After being blamed for a forest fire caused by a "rocket", their
equipment is confiscated and they are forced to stop
experimenting. Glumly, they accept their fate and temporarily
quit.</P>
<P>Homer never gives up on his dreams, though, even when he has to
fill in for his father on the job. After John saves the lives of
a dozen men (but nearly loses his eye and his life), he's laid up
for a few weeks. Homer realizes his obligation to the family and
goes to work in the coal mines. He doesn't like it, but he's a
natural miner. Meanwhile, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), the boys' high
school teacher, continues to inspire them (particularly Homer) to
do something great with their lives. She wants them to enter the
National Science Fair and is only satisfied when they do. Because
this is based on a true story, it has a positive ending with some
bittersweet aspects, too.</P>
<P>In the middle, this film loses its focus on Homer's rocketeering
efforts and gets into the family conflicts. Near the end, as the
miners strike and the town looks to be crumbling, family tensions
increase until everything blows. While those scenes are
necessary, the film's strength is in its laugh-out-loud humour,
warmth, and ingenuity of the boys and their rockets. Ironically,
I softly criticize the filmmakers for forgetting about the rocket
exploits, yet these family scenes were the ones I could best
understand. Still, it's not easy to watch a story of a boy and
his father who cannot relate and don't get along because that's
my story, too.</P>
<P>Director Joe Johnston has made a fine film here--better than
"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids", for instance, which was also a sweet
movie about families and technology. Johnston uses the technical
aspects well in conjunction with the story in "October Sky". One
of the most important facets is the support for the "Rocket Boys"
by the entire community as they willingly help the boys out in a
heartfelt, but honest way. This film is not sappy or manipulative
and it's bound to bring a tear to the eye at the resolution,
especially if you can relate to these people like I can. Rockets
and mines are the metaphors. Love, forgiveness, and hope are the
messages. When "October Sky" isn't entertaining you, it's
touching you.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Producer Charles Gordon also produced "Field Of
Dreams", a movie with a very strong element of father/son forgiveness 
and acceptness.</P>
<PRE>This film gets a 9/10.</PRE>
