<PRE>The Truman Show (1998)</PRE>
<P><A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Truman+Show,+The+">http://us.imdb.com/Title?Truman+Show,+The+</A>(1998)</P>
<P>This has been the finest movie that I have seen in a while.  I walked
into the theater with the praise for the movie ringing in my ears. "4
Stars!"  "Excellent...Drama becomes Carrey!" "Brilliant!"...</P>
<PRE>The praise is well deserved.</PRE>
<P>The movie follows Truman Burbank (Carrey) on his very own television
show - The Truman Show.  However, Truman doesn't know that it's a show
- he lives it unaware, as an audience of millions watches.  Truman
lives beneath a great dome - the largest soundstage ever constructed
(complete with 5000+ cameras) The entire operation is controlled by
Christof (Ed Harris), the director, from the "moon" - or what looks
like the moon to Truman.</P>
<P>The entire purpose of the setup is so that Truman can lead a "normal
life" - the life that Christof has planned for him.  Sure, bad things
happen to Truman, but he always bounces back.  Christof always assures
that.</P>
<P>Truman begins to question his world when things malfunction on the
inside.  He begins to ask questions about the nature of life and what
is real.  The movie follows his quest to find the answers.</P>
<P>The closest feeling that I can associate to this movie is the one I
felt after seeing Forrest Gump for the first time (actually, after
every time I see Gump.)  Harris is strangely father-like in his role.
He genuinely seems to love Truman as a son, yet he has to punish him
to get the ratings.  Some of the most powerful scenes are those where
Christof has to work against Truman.  Harris comes across genuine and
very human.</P>
<P>Carrey is beautiful in his role.  It almost seems as if it were meant
for him and only him.  You quickly forget his slapstick roles in "Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Dumb and Dumber."  He reminded me of Tom
Hanks to a certain extent - they both have the same sincerity around
them.  Carrey lays off the slapstick in the film almost entirely, and
if you don't expect it, you will miss it. (A gratification to some
people.)  Carrey also tugs at the viewer's heartstrings.  Remember
Robin Williams in "Dead Poet's Society"?  Carrey has the same effect
on the viewer.</P>
<P>Overall this film was the most excellent one I have seen this year.
As said earlier, it brings memories of "Forrest Gump" - the story of a
simple man trying to get the most out of life.</P>
<PRE>My rating out of 10: 10.</PRE>
