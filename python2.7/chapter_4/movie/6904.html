<PRE>                             RIDING THE RAILS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "I ain't got a dime," says the opening song.  "I don't what to
do."  It is the time of the Great Depression and over a quarter of a
million teenagers are riding the rails.  Even with movies such as
William A. Wellman's WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD (1933) trying to scare them,
the teenagers are leaving home in larger and larger numbers to hop a
freight to anywhere.  Some kids go for economic reasons and others
purely for adventure.  The show even has one man, now 72, who still
spends time every year riding the rails.  He enjoys it so much he never
wants to give it up.</P>
<P>     RIDING THE RAILS is a polished and moving feature length
documentary by Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell.  I saw it at San Jose's
Cinequest film festival, and it is so powerful that I will never forget
it.  The documentary's strength comes from the interviews with the now
grownup teenagers from that era.  These talking heads are black and
white, male and female.  Their tales are full of poignancy and
excitement.  I found myself feeling sorry for them and envious at the
same time.</P>
<P>     One man describes how his father came home one day and cried for
the first time in his life.  Sobbing he told his family simply, "I lost
my job."  The boy got depressed and left home the next day.</P>
<P>     Interspersed with the interviews in color are old black and white
films of the Depression.  Taken together, they may move you to tears
and at the same time you may be smitten by the desire for such an
adventure yourself.  Although there are numerous dangers hopping
freights from hunger to injury to jail, the camaraderie of the period
was electric.  One kid, the son of a wealthy doctor, left home for the
exhilaration of the experience.</P>
<P>     "It was a combination of my unhappiness at home with my desire to
roam that led to my hoboing," explains one of the men.  Or as another
one put it, "It's dangerous, that's why it's fun."</P>
<P>     The film is filled with songs from the Depression, most of which
I had never heard and all of which I found touching.  Still, it is the
words that have the most impact.  As one says, "It was a time when a
man could get killed for the shoes he wore, no matter what shape they
were in."</P>
<P>     RIDING THE RAILS runs 1:11.  It is not rated but would be PG for
the themes.  It would be fine for any kid interested.  I recommend the
film to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
