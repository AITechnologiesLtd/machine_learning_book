<PRE>THE WOOD (M).  
(MTV/Paramount/UIP)
Director: Rick Famuyiwa
Stars: Taye Diggs, Omar Epps, Richard T Jones, Sean nelson, Duane Finley, 
Trent Cameron, Malinda 
Williams, De'Aundre Bonds, Sanna Lathan Tamala Jones
Running time: 109 minutes.</PRE>
<P>This dull, tedious and relentlessly bland
semi-autobiographical coming of age comedy is characterised by wooden
performances, wooden direction and a leaden script.</P>
<P>Set in the middle class Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood
(affectionately known as "the Wood" by its residents) in the
mid-1980's, the film follows the friendship between three black
youths.  The film opens in the present, with the imminent wedding of
Roland (Taye Diggs).  But with only a couple of hours before the
ceremony, Roland has disappeared, and it falls to his two best friends
Mike (Omar Epps, from Higher Learning, etc) and Slim (Richard T Jones,
from Kiss The Girls, etc) to find him and get him to the church on
time.</P>
<P>This is the cue for some flashback sequences recalling their
first meeting at school and some key events in their enduring
friendship.  We follow the young Mike (played by Fresh's Sean Nelson),
Slim (Duane Finley, making his feature film debut) and Roland (Trent
Cameron, also making his debut) through school, the senior prom, a
comic hold-up, and the embarrassment of their first sexual experience.
In a sequence that seems like a tasteless cross between Porky's and
the recent American Pie, the three make a pact to try and lose their
virginity within a month, with money riding on the outcome.  We also
follow the slowly developing romance between Mike and Alicia (Malinda
Williams) from its awkward beginnings, and learn why the couple
eventually went their separate ways.
 </P>
<P>However, there are few insightful moments or cathartic
experiences to make this semi- autobiographical tale worth telling.
Even though it is a film about the experience of contemporary black
youth, The Wood fails the basic test of all good coming of age films.
Nostalgic films are supposed to evoke memories and a sense of shared
experiences that resonate with audiences of all backgrounds and
persuasions, but The Wood fails to arouse any such emotional response.
The film lacks any warmth, humour, or insight, and we feel little
empathy for these boys in the wood.</P>
<P>First time writer/director Rick Famuyiwa sets up a number of
potentially interesting ideas, but fails to satisfactorily develop
them or follow through.  The Wood has nothing of interest to say, and
takes nearly two hours in which to say it.  In fact, it makes the
recent tedious How Stella Got Her Groove Back seem like a masterpiece
by comparison.  The Wood should come with its own subtitles so that
audiences can understand the peculiar jive talk of the characters!
Famuyiwa even resorts to the horribly clichéd technique of having
one character directly address the camera during the opening scenes,
but somehow this clumsy device is mysteriously dropped by the
climactic wedding sequence.  For me, the best part of this awful film
came when it unexpectedly broke down during the preview screening.  At
first, the dialogue was out of synch, making the film look like one of
those old badly dubbed Bruce Lee films of the mid-'70's.  Then the
screen mercifully faded to black (so to speak) for a few minutes.
Unfortunately, the problem was rectified and The Wood plodded on for
another interminable 80 minutes.</P>
<P>Even without these technical glitches, The Wood would have to
rank as one of the worst films of the year!</P>
