<PRE>Review: The Third Miracle</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Ed Harris, Anne Heche, and Armin
        Mueller-Stahl.
        Directed by Agnieszka Holland.
        Based on the novel by Richard Vetere.</PRE>
<P>Ed Harris is a priest who is not sure he believes in God.  Heâ€™s
even less sure that he wants to be a priest anymore.  He seems
the perfect skeptic for debunking a miraculous bleeding statue
of the Virgin Mary.  A least his bishop thinks so.  The Church
hierarchy takes a dim view of these things, and in truth thereâ€™s
something desperately depressing about the parishionersâ€™
uncritical eagerness to believe.  Set in Chicago in the 1970s,
these are people who go to church every Sunday and beat their
kids the rest of the week  The bishop lives in a mansion and
talks like a corporate manager.  Which, of course, he is. 
Harrisâ€™ priest in the guy in the middle.</P>
<P>If thereâ€™s one word that sums up this movie, that word is
unsentimental.  The Church is convincingly portrayed as a
hard-nosed institution, part corporate board room and part
military barracks.  Spontaneous religious faith takes the form
of a pimp crossing himself or a junkie raising his eyes to
heaven to give thanks for a dollar bill.  Father Frank could pass
for Raymond Chandlerâ€™s detective Philip Marlowe, walking
the mean streets of the city in pursuit of the truth-- God knows
why, for all the good it will do either him or anyone else.  He is
driven to follow his conscience, and following his conscience
will likely make him miserable.</P>
<P>Enter Roxanna (Heche), the adult daughter of the woman who
is up for sainthood (the aforementioned statue is supposedly
bleeding the deceased womanâ€™s blood).  Itâ€™s bad enough having
a mother whoâ€™s literally a saint; add having been abandoned by
her at age sixteen while she went off to serve God and the
Church, and youâ€™ve got one embittered young woman. 
Roxanna and Frank have a lot in common, as they discover
after initially bristling at each other.  They become drinking
partners, and well on their way to becoming involved. 
Roxanna is as tough as brass; sheâ€™s had a lot of pain in her life
but she doesnâ€™t expect anyone to cry tears for her.  Just like
Frank.  So the last thing Frank wants to do is hurt her. Problem
is, heâ€™s still a priest.  Doing the right thing is impossibly
complicated.  (In the theater where I saw this movie, there
were two little old ladies sitting behind me.  During the scene
where Harris and Heche are kissing, and slowly sinking to the
floor in her bedroom, the two old dears where whispering â€œno,
no!â€? just as I was thinking, â€œyes, yes!â€?)</P>
<P>I wonâ€™t reveal which of us got our wish.</P>
