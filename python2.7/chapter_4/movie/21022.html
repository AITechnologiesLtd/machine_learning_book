<P>The soldiers of Three Kings have taken their cue from movies about
Vietnam. (Fitting, since the media-saturated Gulf War became a pop
entertainment.) While driving through a long, flat Iraqi desert (in a
Humvee with a Bart Simpson hood ornament), one of the men under
Special Forces Sgt. Maj. Archie Gates' (who's steering) command
requests a Beach Boys tune. These men want their Apocalypse Now
moment, only instead of surfing, they bop to the music and skeet shoot
out the back of the vehicle, armed with automatic rifles. </P>
<P>Our three kings (okay, four) are good fighters, but they don't
necessarily take Operation Desert Storm seriously-it's a reprieve from
their hellish day jobs. They are Gates, new father Sgt. Troy Barlow
(Wahlberg), Sgt. Chief Elgin (Cube), and Pvt. Conrad Vig (music video
director Jonze). At story's start, President Bush has declared a
ceasefire, and American troops are tying up loose ends. Barlow, Elgin,
and Vig discover during a round up of Iraqi captives an "ass-map" that
points to a bunker filled with gold bullion. </P>
<P>Gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation; he
proposes-demands-that Barlow, Elgin, and Vig join him on a treasure
hunt. Ditching his escort, a relentless reporter named Adriana Cruz
(Nora Dunn), is easy. So is finding the treasure, until the four men
realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in Iraq: Saddam's men
are threatening the dictator's detractors (citizens of his own
country) with violence. </P>
<P>When Gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck, ready
to loot, the unarmed rebels want help. (Bush encouraged them to rise
up against the government, but provided no military support for such
cause.) Gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war
mission, and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck. The
situation could go off without a hitch: the former enemies bear no
grudges. But the money hungry Gates has a conscience, and when one
female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these Americans
have left the scene, he orders Barlow, Elgin and Vig to open fire on
the surrounding Arab forces. The result: Barlow is kidnapped, and the
filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than
they ever did during wartime. </P>
<P>Barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking
device. His interrogator lost his family to the bombs, and he wants
Barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child. (He does, in
chilling, lasting images.) I liked these scenes best, because the
political became personal. It's one thing to champion the plight of
thousands; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a
crib. Russell has shocked us before: his first film, Spanking the
Monkey, is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother. (It's
great.) His second, Flirting With Disaster, features a character who
has an armpit fetish. One could argue that it's easier to make an
audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions, though;
Russell disturbs us in Three Kings by being no-nonsense about the
violence. When Barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home,
Russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead
of THX bombast. </P>
<P>Three Kings is Russell's first visually arresting picture.
Stylistically, it stands apart from other war dramas. Newton Thomas
Sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely
grainy, which is, of course, entirely appropriate. One practically
breaks out in sweat staring at the screen. (A friend enthusiastically
added, "It's like having sand in your eyes.") This also helps to blur
the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the Persian
Gulf facade. (Three Kings was shot in Arizona, California, and
Mexico.) Russell throws plenty at Sigel's camera for it to observe-as
was the case with Russell's previous efforts, the most absurd moments
are also the film's most realistic, even the most poignant. (We watch
a bullet puncture an organ from the inside.) </P>
<P>If anything, Three Kings settles down and stops surprising us. Its
climax is pure Hollywood, no doubt the answer to why a major studio
felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded Russell.
Subsequently, the characters become more cartoonish-Barlow's
post-torture revelry felt phony, and Chief, a strong presence in the
first third, fails to escape the
God-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power cliché-so
much for Cube avoiding token status. (The Arab players, on the other
hand, duck stereotype.) Clooney, too, transforms into a blandly heroic
protestor-marching with the rebels, I waited for him to shout, "Let my
people go!" Hayseed Vig notwithstanding, the protagonists are very
intelligent, and self-serving, too; I had a glimmer of hope, based on
Russell's filmography, that our antiheroes would revert to their
greedy selves at some juncture. (It's not spoiling much to write
that.)</P>
<P>Then again, what historical importance would such nastiness serve?
(There's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of Kuwait's
oil-infested waters.) Russell offers the masses a primer on the
oft-dismissed Gulf conflict, and pulled off a neat trick: a war tale
full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared. If
he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally
significant, he succeeded. With flair.</P>
