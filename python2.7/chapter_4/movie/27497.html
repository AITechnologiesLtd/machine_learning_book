<PRE>THE HOUSE OF MIRTH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>The truth is out there.  And the truth is that THE X-FILES's actress 
Gillian Anderson is badly miscast as Lily Bart, the central character in 
Terence Davies's THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, based on Edith Wharton's novel of 
early 1900s manners.  "She is herself with few people only," Lawrence 
Selden (Eric Stoltz) says of Lily.  Who these few people might be is 
unclear since Anderson shows almost no variation in her acting, reading 
her lines with little emotion.</P>
<P>The movie is sometimes fairly enjoyable in spite of the lead rather than 
because of her.  The credit belongs mainly to the script, whose 
delicious thoughts are worth savoring ("Where does dignity end and 
rectitude begin."  "Men have minds like moral flypaper.").  </P>
<P>Several members of the supporting cast also deserve credit.  Lily, who 
has a predilection for gambling and married men, turns to Gus Trenor 
(Dan Aykroyd), a married man who "invests" her money for her, giving 
Lily a handsome return.  A boisterous Aykroyd puts some drive into a 
movie that keeps slipping into neutral.  Anthony LaPaglia plays Sim 
Rosedale, an outspoken man who is the equivalent of today's dot-com 
millionaire.  Rosedale views marriage like a stock investment, and he'd 
like to make a little IPO with Lily.</P>
<P>Best of all, however, is Laura Linney (YOU CAN COUNT ON ME and THE 
TRUMAN SHOW) as Lily's friend and foe, Bertha Dorset.  While hers is 
only a small part, Linney proves how much stronger the film could have 
been had she had the part of Lily.   When Bertha stings Lily with, "A 
married man should not have the burden of being seen alone with a single 
woman," one can just imagine how much more effective Linney would have 
been as the star of the production.   </P>
<P>Although Glasgow stands in for New York, the sets and the costumes are 
authentic looking and sumptuous.  The sound, however, is jarringly dull.  
More music and a heightened use of background sounds would have given 
the film less of a flat feeling.</P>
<P>Sam Goldwyn once remarked, "Why should people go out and pay to see bad 
movies when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing?"  
And why go to the theater to watch mediocre Masterpiece Theater when you 
can see good Masterpiece Theater on television?</P>
<P>THE HOUSE OF MIRTH runs a long 2:25.  It is rated PG for thematic 
material.  Although there is nothing in it to offend anyone of any age, 
the picture offers little to interest kids under 13.</P>
