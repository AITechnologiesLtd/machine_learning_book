<PRE>Pearl Harbor (2001)</PRE>
<P>Just in time for Memorial Day Weekend of 2001, producers Jerry Bruckheimer 
and Michael Bay have brought out PEARL HARBOR, their treatment of the sneak 
attack with which the Japanese military – according to one of their own 
admirals – "awakened the sleeping giant" of the United States.</P>
<P>It was the final catalyst that brought our country into the complicated 
global skirmish of the Second World War, which had been raging for more than 
two years across different continents.  Needless to say, the attack on 
December 7, 1941, and the events surrounding it, would be difficult topics 
for any filmmaker.  That director Michael Bay succeeds in many dimensions is 
most commendable;  but the film is not the epic he has tried to engineer.</P>
<P>The opening scenes show a couple of tow-headed American boys in Tennessee in 
1923, playing war in a dusty plane parked in a barn.  We don't discover why 
this plane is abandoned when viable aviation had been around only ten years 
or so (could a plane get so dusty if it were used just five years before, in 
the Great War?).  A charming little opening, the action has little Rafe 
McCawley (played as an adult by Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (played later 
by Josh Hartnett) accidentally begin a take-off in a real plane, the crop 
duster belonging to Rafe's dad.  Characterization kicks in when Danny's 
father starts to whup his little boy, and Rafe conks the offender with a 
board – from here on, Rafe is Danny's guardian, a role we know will be 
tested in the future.</P>
<P>Skip ahead to 1940-41, when the boys are young men and aspiring pilots for 
the Army Air Corps.  In several of the scenes Bay and screenwriter Randall 
Wallace sketch their characters as likable and vibrant, but the rather 
slow-paced romance that develops between Rafe and Navy nurse Evelyn Johnson 
(Kate Beckinsdale) bogs down the story.  Only the interesting historical 
background redeems the story in the first hour or so.  We follow Rafe in his 
odyssey with the squadron of American pilots who flew with the British 
against the German Air Force – before any American declaration of war.  We 
watch a few human interest plots develop out on Oahu, at the base at Pearl 
Harbor.  Hawaii was thought to be a safe and distant outpost. But the 
Japanese Empire was pursuing their own military and industrial agendas, 
putting them on a collision course with the Pacific fleet of the United 
States.</P>
<P>When Rafe returns from his harrowing journey, his best friend has taken his 
girl, an old but still striking twist of events.  Yes, there is turmoil 
among the three young and passionate people; but the attack that shook the 
world interrupts the love triangle, and provides us with very exciting 
action.</P>
<P>I was hoping that the film would take all necessary steps to preserve the 
dignity of all of the Americans who died in the raid, and all those who 
survived it.  For the most part, this dignity comes out intact.  Part of the 
hype surrounding this huge movie event, as a matter of fact, has been 
involvement with survivors, veterans now around 80 who are educating younger 
generations through interviews and television specials.  In one scene, 
Colonel Jimmy Dolittle, the flying ace of the First World War who is now 
leading a raid on Tokyo, comments that victory will be ours.  When he points 
to Rafe and Danny, we know that he is speaking of the entire generation of 
solid Americans who would exert whatever efforts required to defeat the Axis 
powers.</P>
<P>You have to hand it to Michael Bay.  He knows what patriotic chords to 
strike, what heartstrings to pluck.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most affecting moments come when President Roosevelt, himself an 
icon to our eyes, reflects the iconography of the times.  Jon Voight is very 
credible as the President (save for the foam padding lining his neck); when 
he delivers the ingenious rhetoric of Roosevelt and his policymakers ("Tell 
that to the Marines…") and especially when he struggles out of his 
wheelchair to argue a point, we sit enrapt and tingling with patriotism.  
Fortunately, Bay does not linger on sepia-tinted scenes of yesteryear, as he 
did in ARMAGEDDON, in which we were made to watch men sitting around 
traditional barber shops, listening to the radio, or children running 
through dust motes and past a mural of JFK still visible on clapboard stores 
40 years after his election.  Thank goodness this tone of mindless jingoism 
does not come through in PEARL.</P>
<P>Many of the shots remind us that Michael Bay got his chops directing videos 
that riveted the interest of MTV fans.  At times the pace is frantic; in one 
sequence during the main attack, viewers are assaulted with at least 30 
different shots in one minute.  It is always a challenge to watch such a 
series of images;  with any text that moves so quickly, the viewer must 
spend enormous energy just to make sense of the events.  More viewings would 
be needed to notice the finer points of composition and detail.</P>
<P>The images are remarkable, though.  In this new look at the attack, computer 
generation is used very well.  Seeing such a large portion of the U.S. 
Pacific fleet at anchor inspires awe.  It's a great recreation of the ships, 
and some of the best battle footage has the camera zooming straight through 
the strafing and bombing, the battleships exploding all around.  Still, we 
see a fuzziness about the bottom of the shots, as if we are watching 
animated paintings of the conflict, perhaps an artist's grim and smoky 
depiction for the cover of a paperback novel.  Dog fights are also 
supercharged by computer generated images.  Tracers zip and scream 
everywhere, adding to the furor of the new war.  No doubt many of the Zeros 
are digital replicas – but their sheer numbers are astounding (Japanese 
Commander Fuchida attacked with over 350 planes, and lost 29 to ground fire 
and a small pack of American pilots who managed to get aloft).  It's hard to 
tell which explosions are enhanced, but the gore of the casualties lends 
realism in many scenes.  At times Bay blurs the picture to simulate the 
chaos created by the carnage.  We watch Evelyn and her fellow nurses 
scramble around the once-empty base hospital, now packed with panic-and 
pain-stricken soldiers and sailors.  These shots are effectively crafted and 
arranged to evoke the mood of sudden tragedy.</P>
<P>Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett both deliver good performances.  Their acting 
is transparent, and their brotherly relationship causes us to realize that 
they will go on as brothers despite loving the same woman.  These actors do 
all that is asked of them, though some of it is telegraphed too early for my 
tastes; I got the bitter taste of predictability early, like a penny touched 
to the tongue.</P>
<P>Kate Beckinsdale does fine in filling her role; she is sufficiently at a 
loss when she discovers she must choose between the men she loves.  An 
engaging subplot develops with Evelyn and her fellow nurses, and we are 
moved when the larger conflict encroaches upon their lives.  A small rub: 
the long and flowing hairstyles of some of these women are laughable in a 
hospital setting.</P>
<P>Tom Sizemore and Dan Ackroyd are underused, as a gruff plane mechanic and a 
code-breaking specialist, respectively.  Wonderful character actors, they 
are.  The same can't be said of Alec Baldwin, a good actor given lines full 
of platitudes and feel-good bravado: thanks to the script, his Dolittle is a 
cardboard commanding officer of the type that Baldwin might himself mock on 
a future "Saturday Night Live."</P>
<P>It was very heartening to look around the theater and spot viewers of 
various ages.  Early summer movies hoping to become blockbusters usually try 
to attract teenagers, a key to financial success at the box office.  But I 
spotted several watchers who were children on that fateful Sunday morning of 
the actual attack. I can imagine the film will be used in middle and high 
school history classes, though the long running time would probably result 
in only scenes being shown.  In any case, the PG-13 rating is warranted 
because of combat violence and language, with one love scene in which there 
is no nudity.</P>
<P>PEARL HARBOR falls short of epic status, though it does honor the  men and 
women represented by these actors.  Of course visual tribute is paid to the 
generation who lived through Pearl Harbor – in the devastating scenes of the 
battleships and other vessels buckled and sunk by torpedoes, in underwater 
shots of sailors and an American flag riddled with holes.  The real 
Battleship Arizona appears at the end, its big guns encrusted with rust and 
plant life.  In our image-conscious world, all of these shots helps to 
memorialize Americans who sacrificed their hearts and lives; but perhaps the 
best homage is paid through reminding young viewers about the identity of 
Americans, through reviving the history that helped to shape the world we 
live in every day.</P>
