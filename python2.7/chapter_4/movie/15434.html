<P>Spanish films are finally settling in as an important part of the art world,
usually having to play second banana to either an Italian, French or English
film.  But at least, when the films do not like a Spanish piece of fluff,
they are beginning to shape up as a nice breed of work, even if, so far, it
seems to be centered around one actress, whose
work is beginning to be noticed.  Victoria Abril has helped put her
country's films back on the map, a bit on a sabbatical since the late master
LUIS BUNUEL, who single handedly made sure we knew there was much more to
Spain than Generalissimo  Franco, even though the government was not about
to say anything about the film, so they could sweep their distaste for
arguments with the church.</P>
<P>If anything, if Pedro Almodovar and Carlos Saura are an indication, the film
industry has finally succeeded in Spain, to the point where the church is no
longer a divisive factor of the public by deciding a film is bad, and the
public flocking to go see it.  Were these church leaders intelligent, they
would have embraced the artists and public, and set themselves up well
 even financially ) for the next century or two.  But old ideas die hard....
and the divinity  plays have not improved.....</P>
<P>Amidst a country, like Italy, where the Christian church has such a  large
influence, film is thriving.  While it exposes a side of people, which Luis
Bunuel himself was already discussing in very large detail, although he made
a point of showing up his opponents,
these films have begun to gain a life of their own, and probably say more
about the actual population of the area, than it does about their ideas.  As
in Bunuel, the ideas and the realities are not quite the same thing, and the
opposite sides can have disastrous impacts on individuals.  If this helps
people learn, then the church  has found its destroyer.</P>
<P>AMANTES, is a story of dualities, and specially in the mind of a man, who
can not decide between his love for a woman, and his desire to be involved
with someone more innocent, but who can't satisfy him despite her true love
and care for him.  And the resolution he has  to make involves a bit of a
plot to get rid of the innocent girl, who
has in the end, finally recognized that she does not want to live, since her
only dream is dead.  And in front a church, she allows for her lover to help
her commit suicide.</P>
<P>The whole film is based on a true story, and the outcome of the events,  and
while it creates a wonderful screen tale, with very good actors carrying it,
it is the subtlety of the situation, and the teetering edge that it lives in
that keeps the film going.</P>
<P>Victoria Abril is very good, and as in at least two of her previous films,
has no qualms about her sexuality or sensual involvement in her roles, and
portrays another depth for an actress which is not readily found.  As such,
it also shows the potential of a new
style of film making, which in the future will incorporated what is today
called pornography, into an art form.  There are moments which are not quite
for everyone, surrounded by the gypsy love songs about sex, and while a bit
surrealistic to see it portrayed in a film, it does bring out another set of
feelings in the people involved.  And the innocent girl, lacked this kind of
open-ness. And while she is willing to learn, it also appears that she is
destined to fail.  She is not free from herself, as the lover has become
with her body.  However, it is also this freedom which brings about the
fateful deed, and the eventual destruction of the romantic relationship.</P>
<PRE>REALLY GOOD FILM
NOT FOR THE MEEK, OR THE SEXUALLY INHIBITED.
THE FILM IS BLUNT, Spanish style.</PRE>
