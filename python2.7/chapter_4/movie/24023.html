<P>     I'm not sure which would be more depressing -- if the makers of RULES
OF ENGAGEMENT were simply exploiting soldiers for a gung-ho patriotic
courtroom drama, or if they actually believed they were doing justice to
the complexities of warfare. The former would be a fairly typical case of
Hollywood opportunism, a predictable but nonetheless annoying reduction of
tangled moral issues to simple flag-waving absolutes. The latter would
indicate good intentions gone horribly awry in the execution. You can
figure out everything you need to know about how RULES OF ENGAGEMENT will
approach its Marine characters from the tag line on the poster, set 
against a shot of Samuel L. Jackson carrying a young boy to safety: "A
hero should never have to stand alone."</P>
<P>     From the set-up, there's reason to hope for and expect something
more. A prologue set in 1968 Vietnam introduces us to Marines Terry
Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), brothers
in arms connected for life when Childers helps save a wounded Hodges'
life during battle. Flash forward 28 years, where both men are colonels,
but Childers is a commander while Hodges is about to retire after three
decades of military law desk work. But its Hodges' turn to come to
Childers' rescue after a mission at the American embassy in Yemen goes
sour, resulting in the deaths of 83 people including women and children. 
Though Childers insists he was responding to gunfire from the protesters,
he faces a court-martial for murder when evidence suggests he ordered the
attack on civilians without provocation. It's up to Hodges, as Childers'
defense attorney, to save his career.</P>
<P>     That's fertile ground to explore the split-second life-and-death
decisions involved in combat, including the possibility that good soldiers
can still make bad decisions based on emotional reaction. We see in the
Vietnam prologue that Childers is capable of resorting to extreme acts
under extreme circumstances, leading to reasonable questions about his
mental state, and the mental state of any military commander. Did the
gunfire to which Childers responded actually come from the jeering crowd
below, instead of just from the rooftop snipers above? Is Childers a
hot-head willing to commit murder to save his men? Are such means
justified by the ends of saving the lives of fellow soldiers? Is there
anything as black-and-white as the notion of a hero where warfare is
concerned?</P>
<P>     I refer you again to that tag line for the answer to the final
question, and by extension every other question the film could have
raised. For you see, there is no question about whether or not Childers
responded appropriately; there's videotape evidence to prove that he did.
There's also a nasty National Security Advisor (Bruce Greenwood) to hide
and eventually destroy that videotape evidence, creating an easy villain
when a much more interesting villain would have been the chaos of combat
itself. The painfully drawn-out courtroom sequences might have been a
place for exploring issues of how hair-splitting rules of engagement are
interpreted when the bullets are flying. Instead, they're a place to
conclude that Hodges is even a worse lawyer than he self-deprecatingly
calls himself, since he never bothers to check the embassy building for
the angle of entry of bullet holes.</P>
<P>     Jones and Jackson are, of course, talented actors whose intensity
makes it easier to watch everything they do. It's simply obvious from the
first moments of RULES OF ENGAGEMENT that they're not playing characters.
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is about as thoroughly plot-driven as movies get,
filled to its two hour-plus rim with action, exposition and testimony.
It's too busy being a melodrama to worry about ambiguity or nuance of
character, too busy appealing to viewers eager to root for Our Boys
against the Bureaucracy. In fact, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is so enamored with
its own sense of doing justice to military men that it ends with the kind
of postscript captions usually associated with fact-based films, just to
let you know that those weasels in suits eventually got theirs. Heroes
will never have to stand alone. Not as long as there are simple-minded
crowd-pleasers like RULES OF ENGAGEMENT to stand up for the idea that
heroes are always right.</P>
