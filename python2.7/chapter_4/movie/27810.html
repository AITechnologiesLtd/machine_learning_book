LANSDOWN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"I don't just do stupid things," Hector (Chris Baran) tells his 
girlfriend, Jessica (Jesse Schein).  "I think about them first."  In the 
comedy LANSDOWN, a very promising first effort by writer/director Tom 
Zuber and his first-time cast and crew, Hector doesn't think long 
enough.  Hired, along with his buddies Benny (Marc Krinsky) and Gendhi 
(Patrick Louis), to kill a roofer, they kill the wrong roofer.  It turns 
out that not just any roofer will do.</P>
<P>The trouble starts when lawyer Jake Jorgenson (Paul Shields) puts out a 
contract on roofer Pat (Chris Stewart), who has been nailing Jake's 
wife, Lexi (Jennifer Carlson).  The inside joke is that director Zuber 
is himself trained as a lawyer.  He met other members of the crew in law 
school, where they decided that law might be a way to make money, but 
film was their passion.</P>
<P>The three guys, who get the contract from a sleazy intermediary named 
Gustaf (D.W. Warren), are exactly hit men material.  Up until their big 
assignment, they had been boosting radios and VCRs and even bungling the 
simple stuff.  The script, which has shades of Tarantino, is quite 
funny.  There is an undertone of seriousness as well, and the story 
would have been improved if they have developed that more.</P>
<P>The film's best scene has Hector trying to borrow Jessica's car, since 
his has dead bodies in the trunk.  Jessica, however, will hear nothing 
about his big problem until he listens to her first.  She doesn't think 
he pays enough attention to her.  As he is about to bust, he tries to 
listen to the petty aspects of her life.  The sharply written scene 
speaks volumes about the inability of men and women to communicate.  
Jessica wants to be heard; Hector wants to get to the point.</P>
<P>LANSDOWN runs a fast 1:20.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
violence and language.  The film would be acceptable for older 
teenagers.</P>
