<P>It's nice to know that the hollywood studio system can still come up with
a fine film, every now and again. I doubt if we'll see a better "big"
movie all year.</P>
<P>It would be a shame to discuss too much about the storyline here, because
so much of the drama depends on the carefully orchestrated flashbacks that
allow the characters, their conflicts, and their secrets to unfold. So
I'll tread very lightly.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington, charismatic as always, plays Nathanial Serling, an Army
colonel who is tormented by a deadly serious mistake he made during the
Gulf conflict. After the battle, he finds himself at the Pentagon,
assigned to investigate whether a posthumous Medal of Honor should be
awarded to Captain Karen Walden, a medevac chopper pilot, played with
gritty humanity by Meg Ryan in the many flashback scenes. Captain Walden
is the first woman to be considered for a combat medal, so the White House
(in light of the photo-op that will be created by hanging the medal around
the neck of the dead pilot's pretty young daughter in the Rose Garden) is
putting on extra pressure for a quick, positive decision. </P>
<P>At the same time, Colonel Serling continues to be pressured by the Army
brass to lie about the mistake he made during the war.  Serling feels,
without knowing completely why, that he must seek his redemption through
truth  -- he must unmask the facts of both incidents, despite the
pressures from above. But the truth about Captain Walden is hard to find,
and the truth about himself is hard to face. As time goes on, he is aided
in his quest by a clandestine relationship with a Washington Post
reporter, played with admirable restraint by Scott Glenn. Serling
eventually wins the conflict with his commanding officer: Full
investigation and disclosure are made, culminating in a scene that could
have been a Great Big Truly Awful Hollywood Climax in the hands of a less
skilled director. Instead, that moment was handled with equally admirable
restraint. </P>
<P>Among the many fine aspects of this film: The battle scenes are so
personal, so intimate, if you will, that I felt more deeply than ever how
War is Hell -- not because of massive battles and high-tech weaponry, but
because of the impossible responsibilities and poignant relationships in
the trenches. _Courage _ shows in close-up how battle is a soldier's
crucible. True "courage" is not an abstract ideal. Nor is it bravado.
Rather, it is a kind of integrity which underlies difficult, sometimes
sudden, often ambiguous real-life decisions.  Do you abandon a badly
wounded, inmmovable soldier when hasty retreat is probably the safest
recourse for the rest of your unit? Do you risk revealing your position to
the enemy if that might save the lives of others? </P>
<P>_Courage_ also explores the theme of a Woman in War, not a helpmate or
lover-in-waiting, ala classic war films, but a tough, exhausted, bleeding,
gun-toting combatant and squad leader. It examines how equal awards and
equal rank are not the same as equal respect and equal treatment.
Consider, for example, how an enlisted street-wise, hyper-male tough guy
might react to a female commanding officer in battle. </P>
<P>It is wonderful to experience the artful intertwining of the two
storylines. There is a symbiosis between Ryan's and Washington's
characters. He helps her by bringing to light the full dimensions of her
courage, and, because of his mission to reveal her story, she in effect
helps him reclaim his own courage. </P>
