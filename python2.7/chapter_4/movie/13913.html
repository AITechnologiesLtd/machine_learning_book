<PRE>Air Bud:  Golden Receiver (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<PRE>Where have all the G ratings gone?  </PRE>
<P>This summer has not offered the goods to kids under 13 or parents who 
enforce the ratings system.  For example, I couldn't take my 10 year-old 
daughter to DOCTOR DOLITTLE because of its PG-13 status.</P>
<P>But we went today to AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER, a rather unwieldy title 
but a decent film for kids.  And only the second theatrical release this 
summer, I believe, rated G.  (MULAN is the other.)</P>
<P>The sequel to last year's AIR BUD, this film expands upon the premise of 
a dog's prowess at basketball.  With a quick opening that does its job - 
moving fast and reinforcing Bud's craftiness and basketball expertise --  
the story unfolds easily and reintroduces us to Josh Framm (Kevin 
Zegers), now an eighth grader, and his mother Jackie (Cynthia 
Stevenson).  After a series of events that complicate the plot, we 
discover the family dog's amazing skill at catching a football.</P>
<P>The football motif is corny and fun;  it makes the viewer remember the 
type of film she is watching.  This is a kids' movie, and it's all right 
that a dog catches passes and eludes tacklers.  It's even all right that 
there is no objection whatever that Bud dresses in a cute quasi-uniform 
and scores touchdowns against other eighth-grades football teams.</P>
<P>The complications are what doesn't work so well.  </P>
<P>First, Gregory Harrison plays Patrick Sullivan, a handsome veterinarian 
who cares for Bud.  It's refreshing, by the way, that Bud likes him back 
- a turnaround from many family pets' uncanny instincts and hatred of a 
human character.  It's Josh who feels threatened when Patrick begins to 
date his mother.  Even though Josh is himself a personable adolescent 
and not an obnoxious stereotype of a teenager, he shows a sulking 
attitude when Patrick and Jackie grow close.  Why would a smart and 
supportive father figure turn off a boy like Josh?  Are a couple of 
shots of  Josh's deceased test-pilot father enough to make us believe 
Josh's motivation to act like he does?</P>
<P>Another subplot involves a sinister but comic Russian duo, played by 
Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti.  Their motive is greed when they set out 
to complete their circus of stolen animals with unique talents.  Dunn 
and Anzilotti prove solid caricature actors as they pursue Bud.  Their 
schemes and fates provide quite a few chuckles when the subplot surfaces 
now and again.  What is missing is the connective tissue.  In the first 
BUD, Josh came in contact with the baddie, who was the dog's original 
owner.  Here, however, the Framm family never even sees the Boris and 
Natasha clones.  Yes, the slapstick adds another funny dimension to the 
story, but by the end we feel as if an alarm were set but failed to go 
off.  Too many details, including a threat to fire the lovable football 
coach, come to naught.</P>
<P>Cynthia Stevenson turns in a credible performance as Jackie.  She brings 
a mousy, compassionate quality to Josh's mother.  The film, with its 
general audience rating, does not show much intimacy between Jackie and 
Patrick, but the actors convince us that a happy ending is possible.  As 
I stated before, it's the relationship between Josh and Patrick that is 
oddly bloodless.</P>
<P>The animal training deserves some mention.  Four big, feathery dogs were 
used to portray Bud, and the editing is slick and watchable.  Somehow 
this dog manages to catch everything thrown his way.  Even though we can 
tell the pigskin is half-inflated, the effect is cute.  And the pooch's 
uniform is precious:  white-painted, ancient leather helmet, smallish 
shoulder pads that make him look half bulldog, and blue jersey featuring 
"K 9."</P>
<P>The film gave me a few belly laughs, which is a sort of litmus test I 
apply to comedies.  Even though AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER is a B-film, 
it appeals to a G audience.  That and the laughter it provides are 
enough to earn our money at the box office.</P>
