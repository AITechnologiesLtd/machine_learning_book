Gomez; Frank Medrano; Kenneth Tsang; Danny Trejo

<P>Whether you love or hate "The Replacement Killers," you've got to respect 
it's running time -- at a slim hour-and-28-minutes, the film speeds by 
faster than the ammo discharged from star Chow Yun-Fat's endless supply of 
firearms. Unfortunately, "The Replacement Killers" also boasts more story 
and character holes than he puts in his opponents, a drawback that keeps the 
movie from being both truly enjoyable and involving. It's certainly nothing 
new to find a action movie riddled with flaws, but at least this one has a 
must-see attraction in its leading man -- Yun-Fat, a Hong Kong idol making 
his American debut here, radiates absolute cool. </P>
<P>He plays John Lee, an assassin with (yes, folks, say it with me) a heart of 
gold. Lee is hired by underworld kingpin Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang) to perform 
a hit in L.A. -- Wei's criminal son was killed in self-defense by stateside 
cop Stan Zedkov (Michael Rooker), and Wei would like Lee to shoot Zedkov's 
own seven-year-old in retaliation. Even though Wei will dispatch people to 
murder Lee's family if the job isn't completed, Lee just can't bring himself 
to pull the trigger. He then hooks up with a document-forger named Meg (Mira 
Sorvino), his only hope to get back to his home in time, and together they 
become marked targets from a new pair of professionals dispatched by Wei. </P>
<P>Director Antoine Fuqua, the man behind Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise" music 
video, does what he can with Ken Sanzel's paint-by-numbers script; in 
particular, he's got style to spare, and demonstrates it from the first 
scene on. The loud, humdinger action makes up a large part of the movie, 
turning everyday locations like car washes, parking garages and theaters 
into dangerous, violent places (and that last one's quite a doozy). "The 
Replacement Killers" doesn't waste much time between them, and thus is over 
with quickly. The film is a dazzler for the eyes and ears, and that's about 
it. </P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat, who learned English for the movie, has an undeniable screen 
presence. He's also a strong actor, and so it's puzzling -- and even 
disappointing -- that John Lee has few scenes where he can project emotional 
depth (could it be that Yun-Fat was still a little too stiff with his 
newly-acquired dialect?). Mira Sorvino offers game support as a sidekick and 
pseudo-romantic interest; she's given more to do than just tagalong, and 
ends up owning the movie's best scene and line ("Are you gonna put a bullet 
in your head now that our positions are reversed?"). The villains, however, 
are too underdeveloped or silly to be much fun, especially the replacement 
killers of the title; when they strut in slo-mo into an airport decked out 
in black leather, greasy hair, facial scars and nasty scowls, you wonder why 
customs doesn't just snatch them up right there. </P>
<P>While "The Replacement Killers" isn't challenging or even remotely 
thrilling, it sure isn't boring. Terrific visuals, a smooth color palette, a 
handful of strong sequences and the performances of Yun-Fat and Sorvino make 
the movie far from a dull sit. And that super-fast 88 minutes (you could fit 
two showings of this into one of "The Postman," and still have a couple 
seconds for a bathroom stop) earns "The Replacement Killers" a fraction of a 
star alone. The movie is a tiny blessing in disguise -- underneath the 
imperfect trappings lies a film that knows it's just about the ride and 
doesn't throw in any needless padding. When looking for a mild diversion, 
who could ask for anything more? </P>
