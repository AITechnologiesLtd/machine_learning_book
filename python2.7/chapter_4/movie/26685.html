<PRE>BEST IN SHOW
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>        "Best in class."  "More bark than bite."  "Christopher Guest's film
has gone to the dogs."  It would be all too easy to make these kinds of
obvious asides about "Best in Show," director Guest's latest mockumentary
(or dog-umentary--there's another one), but if the performer has learned
anything since his "Saturday Night Live" days it's the art of subtlety, and
"Best in Show" is far from being a droll exercise of owners who look like
their pets.  The film follows the pampered pooches and their persnickity
owners in competition at Philadelphia's Mayflower Dog Show intercut with
that mock-interview style which Guest does so well (see: "Waiting for
Guffman").  Going for the blue ribbon are the two left-footed Gerry Fleck
(co-writer Eugene Levy) and his wife Cookie (SCTV's Catherine O'Hara)--her
randy ex-boyfriends keep showing up; a bickering yuppie couple supercharged
on Starbucks (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) whose weimeraner holds
them in high contempt; Guest himself as Carolina fly fisherman Harlan
Pepper (his skills include ventriloquism and naming many varieties of
nut--peanut, pine nut, macadamia nut); a flamboyantly gay couple (Michael
McKean and John Michael Higgins) with their hyper-coiffed Shih Tzu; and,
rounding out the field, a win-at-all-costs lesbian handler and her lover
(Jane Lynch and Jennifer Coolidge).  Outside the ring these able performers
are given an additional boost by Ed Begley Jr. as a hotel proprietor, and
Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as, respectively, a doltish ringside
commentator and his despairing, stiff-upper lipped British counterpart.
Guest's attention to detail is uncanny and that makes the deadpan "Best in
Show" remarkably assured.  You could almost call it the best of its breed.</P>
