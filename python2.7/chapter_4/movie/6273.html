<P>     At least after seeing this movie, I understand where the title came 
from -- starting about thirty minutes into this interminable, unfunny 
feature, I began looking at my watch every few minutes and thinking, 
"Dear God, is this ever going to end?"  A sickeningly bad pastiche of 
much better pictures -- IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, 
and (believe it or not) SPARTACUS all leap to mind -- DEAR GOD is the 
worst excuse for a holiday film since Nora Ephron's hideous MIXED NUTS.</P>
<P>     I suppose it's understandable why Greg Kinnear accepted the lead in 
this film.  With SABRINA, he was bitten by the acting bug, so, when the 
opportunity arose to get not only a part in a major motion picture, but 
top billing, he grabbed it.  Kinnear plays Tom Turner, a small-time L.A. 
con artist who would rather dupe kind-hearted souls out of hard-earned 
money than get honest work himself.  His life of crime comes to an end, 
however, when he is arrested and sentenced to hold down a job for one 
year or face jail time.  His employer becomes the U.S. post office, 
where he's assigned to the "dead letter office" -- the place where 
unaddressed and unreturnable mail comes to die.</P>
<P>     One day, Tom opens a letter addressed to God (there are bins for 
Elvis, Santa Claus, and the Martians, too), and, through a series of 
contrivances too dumb to describe, he ends up surrendering his paycheck 
to a worthy cause.  His fellow workers, including a burned-out lawyer 
(Laurie Metcalf) and a mailman (Tim Conway) who "went postal" and bit a 
dog, find out about his unintentional good deed, and show interest in 
helping with the next one.  Tom wants no part of playing God, but, 
eventually, his desire to impress a pretty waitress (Maria Pitillo) gets 
the better of his cynicism, and he is suckered back into the miracle 
business.</P>
<P>     There's a lot wrong with this film, beginning with its sit-com 
situations and humor.  I have the feeling that anyone who spends endless 
hours staring at a television screen will be right at home watching DEAR 
GOD.  Even the faces will be familiar, since almost everyone in this 
movie is better known for small-screen roles.  There are cameos by the 
likes of Tony Danza, Erin Moran, Jack Klugman, and Rue Maclanahan.  Of 
the main actors, only Tim Conway is passably enjoyable.  Kinnear isn't 
very impressive, and Laurie Metcalf is downright bad -- some of her 
scenes caused me to wince.</P>
<P>     Director Garry Marshall, whose last disaster was the ill-advised 
EXIT TO EDEN, has managed to top that debacle for sheer awfulness.  DEAR 
GOD wavers between sickeningly sweet moralizing ("It's not easy getting 
off the ground."  "Faith isn't arrived at easily.") and moronic comedy.  
Even Marshall's attempts at parody fall flat.  His attempts to skewer 
the vacuous media coverage of high-profile trials is trite.  It has been 
done before, and much better.  Hasn't he heard of TO DIE FOR?</P>
<P>     Right-wingers who espouse "family values" will probably be 
delighted by the pap that passes for entertainment in DEAR GOD.  Maybe 
as soon as Bob Dole loses the election, he'll pay a visit to the local 
multiplex -- this is the kind of movie he can champion.  Hopefully, he's 
in a very small minority, because the last thing we need is a flood of 
DEAR GOD copycats.  It's just too bad dead movies can't be forgotten 
about and recycled the way dead letters can.</P>
