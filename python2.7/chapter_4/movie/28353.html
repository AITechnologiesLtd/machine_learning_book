<PRE>THE ANIMAL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Luke Greenfield's THE ANIMAL, starring Rob Schneider (DEUCE BIGALOW: 
MALE GIGOLO), is a comedic takeoff on the old Frankenstein legend.  The 
hilarious "kill the monster" ending, which is the only time the movie 
follows the traditional Frankenstein story, is one of only two good 
parts to the movie.  The other is an adorable Colleen Haskell from the 
original "Survivor" series, who plays Schneider's human love interest.  
As you watch her being delightful in a movie which is awful, you find 
yourself eagerly awaiting her next picture, which has to be better.  </P>
<P>The story, which is explained in detail in the movie's abysmal trailers, 
concerns Marvin Mange (Schneider), a loser of a man whose body is 
reconstituted out of animal parts after a car accident.  This causes him 
to have a never ending stream of animal urges.  Peeing around his 
restaurant table in order to mark his territory is one such animalistic 
behavior.  Another, in a Tom Green moment, has him masticating a worm so 
that a baby turkey vulture can peck the remains out of his mouth.  </P>
<P>Are you laughing yet?  You aren't?  Well, how about a man who sniffs 
other men's butts?  A man who lusts after every tail -- of whatever 
species -- in sight?  A man who barfs up hairballs?</P>
<PRE>Okay, I give up.  You aren't laughing.  </PRE>
<P>The movie's tagline nicely sums it up: "He wasn't much of a man. ... Now 
he's not much of an animal."  Well, this much can be said in THE 
ANIMAL's defense.  It isn't the worst movie of the week.  By a nose, it 
loses this dubious distinction to another juvenile comedy, WHAT'S THE 
WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? </P>
<P>THE ANIMAL runs, thankfully, only 1:23.  It is rated PG-13 for some 
crude and sexual humor and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and 
up.  </P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the picture just a single *.  He said it 
was plotless slapstick that had only a few funny moments.  </P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 1, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.  </P>
