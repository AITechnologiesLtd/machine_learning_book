<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>It sounded too good on paper.  One of my favorite directors, Barry
Levinson (Wag the Dog), re-teaming with one of my favorite writers, Paul
Attanasio (Quiz Show), to adapt a book by one of my favorite authors,
Michael Crichton (AirFrame).  They pulled it off with Disclosure and its
A-list stars, so why couldn't…no, why SHOULDN'T they be able to do it
again?</P>
<P>Well, I imagine the main reason is that the story is no good.  I never
read Sphere, but have it on good authority that it kinda sucked rocks.
Levinson and Attanasio probably polished this turd as well as they
could, and the end product is a dull rip-off of the superior films in
its genre.</P>
<P>One should have become suspicious when Levinson ordered the actors back
to shoot additional footage less than three weeks before the scheduled
release date.  I guess the reactions from the test screenings made the
executives at Warner Bros. a little antsy.  Who could blame them?  WB's
latest crop of box office bombs include The Postman, Mad City, The Man
Who Knew Too Little, Steel, Free Willy 3 and Fire Down Below.  By Jobe,
there should be people jumping out of windows!</P>
<P>Sphere opens with four `experts', a bio-chemist (Sharon Stone), a
mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), an astrophysicist (fat head Liev
Schreiber) and a shrink (Hoffman) joining a military leader (Peter
Coyote) to explore what is believed to be an ancient alien craft buried
beneath the floor of the Pacific Ocean.  Throw in rap star Queen Latifah
and performance artist Marga Gomez, and you've got yourself an eerie
preview of the next season of MTV's The Real World.  Seven strangers…
picked to live in a submarine…</P>
<P>After it kills off all of the people that don't receive billing above
its title, Sphere proceeds to `borrow' ideas from Alien, 2001, The
Thing, The Abyss and probably a bunch of other groundbreaking films that
I was too bored to notice.  Want to see a much better sci-fi film about
strangers unwillingly thrown together in a confined space?  Wait for
Cube, which will hopefully be released later this year.  Its budget was
about 2% of Sphere.  Literally.</P>
<P>The thing that is supposed to separate Sphere from silly films like Deep
Rising and Anaconda is that there really isn't a giant snake or angry
octopus to do battle with.  The real enemy is the imagination of the
characters.  Personally, I would have used my imagination to create a
world where I was the slave master and my harem included the entire
lineup of those Cover Girl commercials.  Instead, the characters
predictably and boringly turn against each other in individual fits of
distrust.</P>
<P>Levinson displays similar editing techniques to Homicide: Life on the
Streets by quickly replaying the actors dialogue from several different
camera angles.  He also lays the film out in titled chapters, which will
make it easy to `pause' and `pee' when you're watching the video, or to
get up and sneak out of the theater.</P>
