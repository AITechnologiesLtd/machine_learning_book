<PRE>Father and Sun Flares
Frequency</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Simply put, the best film of the year so far. We film reviewers see three or
four (or more) pictures a week, so you may not need any further convincing.
But if you do ... read on. And for those of you that trust this reviewer and
like surprises, stop reading and go see the film!</P>

<P>The sun's flares (nicely visually represented) spool upward (to the tune of
"Crimson and Clover") 93 million miles away from our spinning planet,
causing beautiful blue neon illuminations across the starry starry night
skies of a 1969 and 1999 New York city. These freak conditions cross
wavelengths with time, making the impossible possible as a 36 year old son
talks to his 40 year old (and currently deceased) father over an old H.A.M.
radio transceiver.</P>
<P>The father and son connections, which occur in the same room, but three
decades apart, are so thick and resonating you'll want the entire film to
remain focused on them. Though never leaving that relationship, "Frequency"
pitches a cops and homicide story to boot. Pay attention, toggles in time
are not always announced with convenient captions - which adds to the
allure, mystery, and off-kilter swirl.</P>
<P>A tasty fire motif simmers under whirling planet simulations that surface at
the right times and places to keep the perspective appropriately wide and
tilted. All elements merge in a constructive interference to create a
wonderfully eerie aura (or should I say aurora?) that will swell your chest
and dominate your breath, enlarging your nostrils, hardening your Adam's
apple and moistening your tear ducts. The woman beside me rolled back and
forth, alternately crying out, blowing her nose, laughing, and covering her
eyes like an infant.</P>
<P>I have only two contentions, both of which are minor and may actually have
good explanations (if you know ... send them in.) 1) Fire-triggered
sprinkler systems in a 1969 police station? 2) How did son John know the
specific choices in the moment prior to his father's death? (Btw, Jim
Caviezel is awesome.)</P>
<P>"Backdraft" plus "The Sixth Sense" equals "Frequency." I'd have titled it:
"A Matter of Time," "Father and Sun Flares," "The Same Wavelength,"
"Communication Hertz" or "Serial Killer and H.A.M." Hey, stop reading and go
see it!</P>
