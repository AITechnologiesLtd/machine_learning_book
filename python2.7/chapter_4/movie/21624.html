<P>_Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ (G) * 1/2</P>
<P>with _Pikachu:_The_Movie--Pikachu's_Vacation_ (G) *</P>
<P>The question when it comes to
_Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_, is not whether or not
it's any good (and, let it be known from the get-go, that it isn't).  The
question is just how much money it will make in what surely be a huge
opening weekend, for children across the country will undoubtedly make
their parents take them to this theatrical spinoff of the popular
animated TV series/trading card game.  The film could simply be a
_Pokémon_ screensaver projected onto the silver screen, and kids would
want to go anyway, regardless of any objections parents--or anyone
else--may have.</P>
<P>A _Pokémon_ screensaver is what the pre-feature short,
_Pikachu:_The_Movie--Pikachu's_Vacation_, sometimes resembles.  For the
uninitiated, Pokémon are "pocket monsters," little animals kept in "Poké
balls" and are pitted in battles against each other by their human
trainers.  The thin plot thread holding together the twenty minutes of
_Pikachu's_Vacation_ has the most popular Pokémon, the adorable
electrical-powered Pikachu, going to a retreat for Pokémon; the intent is
to study the creatures' behavior while in "a state of complete
relaxation."  Relaxation--to the point of drowsiness--is likely to be
felt by the adults in the audience during this "mini-movie," for nothing
of interest to anyone over 10 happens.  Pikachu and his fellow critters
get into all sorts of competitions and petty conflicts before working
together to get one out of a jam--literally: a Pokémon gets his head
stuck into a pipe, and the others collectively try to pull him out. 
Every so often, as a new Pokémon is trotted out, the screen fills with
its repeated image, not unlike a computer screensaver.  The only
difference is that I've seen screensavers that are better drawn and
animated, not to mention more entertaining to watch.</P>
<P>The jaunty tone takes a surprising turn to the dark side once
_Pikachu's_Vacation_ and _Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ begins.  The main feature
opens with a scene that seems to be torn from a much more mature animé,
with Mewtwo (voiced by Philip Bartlett), the most intelligent and
powerful Pokémon, murderous rebelling against the scientists who created
him.  Even the narration is strangely pretentious; the first lines spoken
are, "What is the meaning of life?  That is the question that human and
Pokémon alike have pondered for years."</P>
<P>But before long, it's familar Pokémon battle time as we meet our heroes
Ash (Veronica Taylor), Misty (Rachel Lillis), and Brock (Eric Stuart);
and their nemeses, Jessie (Lillis) and James (Stuart), a.k.a. Team
Rocket.  Ash, trainer to Pikachu and others, is invited to take part in a
big Pokémon tournament taking place at a remote island.  Little does he
and his fellow invitees are walking into a trap set up by Mewtwo, who
plans on proving his superior intelligence and strength as well as that
of his troop of Pokémon super-clones.  Naturally, this is just the first
step of a world domination plot by Mewtwo, who hates Pokémon as much, if
not more, than humans, for they allow themselves to be "enslaved."</P>
<P>Obviously, the makers of _Pokémon:_The_First_Movie_ are striving for 
something weightier than the daily cartoon show.  It's an admirable
ambition, to graft on a message while they have the kiddies' unfettered
attention.  What is questionable, however, is the choice of message.  The
tournament on Mewtwo's island becomes one huge free-for-all between the
Pokémon and their super-clones, and the trainers look on in horror at the
violent display.  One character even says something to the effect of,
"It's OK for them to battle, but NOT LIKE THIS!"  Excuse me, but I fail
to see any real difference between this battle and the ones the trainers
routinely stage, except that in this case, everyone's going at it all at
once.  It goes without saying that everything resolves itself in the end,
but what do our heroes learn?  Nothing, apparently, for it's back to
individual Pokémon battles as usual.</P>
<P>If _Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ had simply been a big
screen version of the cartoon show, it would have been better than the
overreaching, hypocritical mess that it is; why bother with a message if
it goes against what the show is, and then not even follow through with
it?  Children obviously will miss the point, as best summed up by my
7-year-old nephew's reaction after the screening.  While he said he liked
the film, he complained, "There wasn't even a winner."  Of course, one
side lesson of the film is that winning doesn't matter, but you try
explaining that to every child who walks into the theatre expecting, as
the ads and commercials promise, "the Pokémon match of all time."</P>
