<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A poignant, original, psychological drama-comedy depicting life among a
bunch of disorientated residents in Vancouver. It explores their
problems over loneliness, sexuality, and coping with life.</P>
<P>The film centers around four troubled individuals whose stories somehow
interconnect. It does a nice job of looking at their sexual perversions
and fantasies, and their bizarre attempts to relate with one another.
All of them were credible characters, seemingly, trapped by their sexual
dysfunctions.</P>
<P>Angie (Babz Chula) is a fiftysomething, chain-smoking dynamo, a drug
dealer of homegrown pot and a mother of a twentysomething son, Ethan
(Vincent), who along with his girlfriend Lila (Frida), lives with her.
Angie's mother (Abby) inconveniently visits and tries to make sense of
her daughter's life, while coping with her own ill health and
loneliness. Angie's main problem is that in her need to survive and be
independent, she can't open herself up to love.</P>
<P>David (Scholte) is a college student at Simon Fraser University, who has
some deep sexual problems, preventing him from pursuing a relationship
with his longtime girlfriend Rebecca. He has a relationship with Angie
whereby he gets his kicks when she spanks him. Angie has grown weary of
this and is trying to ditch the persistent younger man, who constantly
shows up in her house, even though he's not welcome their anymore. His
schoolwork also suffers because of his deep sexual problem. David is so
consumed by Angie, that he is prepared to destroy his life over her.</P>
<P>Nancy (Sivak) is a twentysomething bulimic woman who lives in the
basement apartment in Angie's house and suffers from a depressive
disorder, preferring to be alone rather than with others, where in order
to make herself feel good, she spends money she doesn't have by using
her credit cards to go on shopping sprees and misuses her $18,000
student-loan by spending it mostly on clothes. She is currently employed
in a grocery store and is in the process of filing for bankruptcy.
Nancy's life has gone under because of her shopping addiction and she is
left on her own to deal with it, receiving no professional psychological
help.</P>
<P>Tony (Ratner) is not a bad guy but he can't connect with others. He's a
short, lonely, young man, with a bit of a temper, who is working in a
lumber store. He is roommates with David, whom he can't connect with at
all. He is awkward around females, managing to say or do the wrong
thing, which repels them. He is obsessed with a checkout girl who
doesn't even notice him, even after he buys an expensive computer. He
gets Angie's number from a fellow worker, when he asks for someone he
can score some potent weed from. Angie coolly diverts his advances and
fixes him up with Nancy, which results in an unsuccessful date. Tony is
completely lost at how to find love in this city, escaping from reality
by getting stoned, and is so frustrated by his loneliness, that his last
resort is to go back to his hometown.</P>
<P>This is young Canadian film director Bruce Sweeney's (Live Bait) second
feature, which was supposedly influenced by his attending of a 1991
master class with British director Mike Leigh. He makes good use of
Leigh's improvisational way of shooting a film and has created a nifty
contemporary film, with frighteningly real sex scenes and recognizable
characters who have modern urban problems. The acting is subtle (Babz
Chula's performance is mesmorizing), while, the story, though not
reliant on plot, is emotionally strong, showing how all the individuals
are tangled up in knots. It was both a sad and funny picture, one that I
would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very
graphic, 'dirty' sexual scenes, that fit the story to a tee.</P>
