Antitrust (2001)  2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ryan Phillippe, Rachael
Leigh Cook, Claire Forlani, Tim Robbins, Douglas McFerran and Richard
Roundtree. Written by Howard Franklin. Directed by Peter Howitt.</P>
<P> Computer geeks take heart. You have been elevated in the cinematic
world to the level of dashing romantic hero, able to perform Bondian
derring-do, while keeping you wind-swept, but somewhat disheveled hair
perfectly coiffed.</P>
<P> Now you are the savior of the common man, the everyday computer user,
whom you are protecting from the big, bad nefarious computer designers
out to make millions off the latest technology, even if it means
committing murder.</P>
<P> My, how things have changed. A few years ago men such as Bill Gates
were admired, almost worshipped. They were the good guys who were making
our lives easier through their various innovations.</P>
<P> Today, they are the villains who rob, steal and kill in order to corner
the software marketplace.
Thus we now have Antitrust in which young hunk Ryan Phillippeís Milo is
a computer genius recruited out of college by a Gates-type named Gary
Winston (Tim Robbins), who needs the young manís expertise to help him
complete an ambitious project ó Synapse.</P>
<P> And what is Synapse? Merely a program that, using satellites, will link
every computer, TV screen, cell phone and any other electric gizmo and
gadget worldwide.</P>
<P> The entire affair sounds like silly hokum, and, to be truthful, it is.
But itís also fun, not something to be taken seriously as some dire
warning about the perils of computer technology or even about
monopolies.</P>
<P> The paranoids in the audience will have a field day with Antitrust.
Every time one of them turns on his or her computer screen, they will
begin looking over their respective shoulders.</P>
<P> The story, written by Howard Franklin, was inspired, according to
Antitrustís press kit, ìwith the personalities and machinations at the
core of the computer software industry. He was intrigued by the fiercely
competitive search for The Next Big Thing ... and ... the intense power
struggles between huge computer corporations and young geniuses in
garages who can potentially put the big guys out of business with one
great idea.î</P>
<P> Of course, Franklin merely used a traditional thriller plot
substituting software for the latest deadly weapon or miracle drug. But,
as I said, this is no cursory warning about the evils of the computer
software industry. Itís merely an amusement park ride with various
twists and turns to hold the audienceís attention.</P>
<P> Antitrust is a smooth, sleek little B-programmer with sharp
performances by Phillippe, Robbins, Rachael Leigh Cook and Claire
Forlani.</P>
<P> After viewing this movie, the status of computer geeks is moving up. So
guys, better brush up on those social skills, the chicks are going to be
banging down your doors.</P>
<P> Now, how about a movie in which a small-town film critic saves the
world ... Naw, no one would believe it.</P>
