<PRE>Heathers (1989) 102m.  </PRE>
<P>You'd think that a comedy about a topic as touchy as teenage suicide
would be box-office poison, but check this one out anyway. HEATHERS is
a cool, sharp, satire about a group of high school seniors who make
the discovery that you can be more popular dead than alive.  Winona
Ryder is Veronica,a satellite member of an exclusive tripartite
sorority in an Ohio high school.  Enter Christian Slater (in Jack
Nicholson mode) as JD - Jason Dean, a rebel without a conscience - who
sees more potential in Ryder than just another member of a school
clique.  The confusing relationship between Veronica and JD is what
sets events in motion: although Ryder is appalled at what he does, she
can't fully extricate herself from his schemes.  And what are those
schemes exactly?  Even JD doesn't seem to know ("Chaos is great!" he
exhorts) and his phony family life offers only the most rudimentary of
clues.  But the universe of HEATHERS is too out of kilter for us to
have any concerns about Slater's character - it's easier to simply
accept him as an agent of change who has breezed into town.  JD knows
he is fatally flawed (which probably explains his affinity with
Captain Ahab), involved as he is with an anarchic quest which no-one
apart from Veronica seems capable of understanding.  It comes as no
surprise that his preoccupation with murder and suicide (which are
both the same thing to him) escalates into a self-destructive climax.</P>
<P>Potentially offensive subject matter is defused right from film's
opening - if you're willing to believe that three girls all
coincidentally named Heather are running their campus then you'll go
along with the notion of death as just another cruel high school
prank.  The cast play every scene straight, regardless of its absurd
or unnerving context - but it's also this neutrality (i.e. neither
truly scary or laugh-out-loud funny) that leaves me wanting somehow. 
On the plus side it does have several quotable lines and a supporting
role by Shannen Doherty (who would reprise her Bad Girl on Campus role
in TV's BEVERLY HILLS 90210) as the second 'Heather' in the pecking
order.  Film's big fan following is a little disquieting when you
realize that two girls were poisoned by their fourteen year old 'best
friend' who was copying the murders she'd seen on screen.  It makes me
wonder how prominently the revenge element of the film features as an
attraction for its fans.</P>
