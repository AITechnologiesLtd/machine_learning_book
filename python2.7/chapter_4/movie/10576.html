<P>     While STAR KID isn't based on a comic book, it might as well be.  
However, unlike most superhero action movies, which aspire to be 
embraced by viewers of all ages, this feature is aimed at an exclusive 
sex and age group:  preteen boys.  But, while the picture is likely to 
appeal to many members of the target audience, those on the outside may 
be irritated by STAR KID's silly humor, flat characters, and juvenile 
writing.  When it comes to live-action comic books, this is uninspired 
fare.</P>
<P>     The basic premise of STAR KID (which was re-named from its more 
appropriate, original title, THE WARRIOR OF WAVERLY STREET) is that 12-
year old Spencer (Joseph Mazzello), a comic book-loving nerd, sees a 
spaceship crash-land near his house one night.  When he goes out to 
investigate, he discovers the "Phase I Assault Cybersuit," a living suit 
of armor that is designed to encase a humanoid host.  Once locked inside 
"Cy," Spencer has some fun using his newfound abilities to do things 
like torment the local bully and get some drive-through fast food.  But, 
with the arrival on Earth of a monstrous Broodwarrior, an enemy of the 
race that created Cy, the situation turns serious.</P>
<P>     As superhero stories go, this one has all the necessary elements:  
an underdog who emerges on top, an oddball friendship (in this case, a 
boy and his alien armor), a nasty villain, lots of neat powers for our 
intrepid protagonist, and a big, climactic battle.  Although competently 
brought to the screen by director Manny Coto (DR. GIGGLES), most of what 
goes on during STAR KID is strictly generic and by-the-book.  It's worth 
noting that, while the special effects aren't state of the art, they're 
pretty impressive considering the film's low budget.</P>
<P>     If you're looking for top-notch acting by "name" stars, this isn't 
the right movie.  The most impressive performance in STAR KID is given 
by a special effect (Cy).  Joseph Mazzello is adequate as Spencer, but 
his work here doesn't come close to his impressive turn in SHADOWLANDS; 
instead, it's more in line with his listless JURASSIC PARK output.  The 
other actors are adequate, and one or two of the faces may look vaguely 
familiar, but no one is likely to get another job based exclusively on 
their dubious accomplishments here.</P>
<P>     If the premise -- a human being gaining superpowers as a result of 
a special costume – sounds familiar, that could be because it was the 
idea behind last year's Shaquille O'Neal feature, STEEL.  However, while 
the basic plot is a retread, at least the dialogue transcends the level 
of nonstop, predictable clichés.  Although there's nothing in STAR KID 
that's likely to be mistaken for modern-day Shakespeare, surprisingly 
few of the lines are cringingly awful.  In fact, from time to time, the 
characters in this movie speak like real people.</P>
<P>     One thing that STAR KID has going for it is that it's rarely boring 
(although the repetitious climactic battle goes on for about 10 minutes 
too long).  That's because of the notoriously short attention span of 
the target audience.  Twenty years ago, I suppose I would have enjoyed 
this movie.  Since then, however, my tastes have matured, and now I 
demand a little more intelligence and sophistication than STAR KID 
offers.  Unless you're a boy between the ages of about 8 and 13, you're 
likely to find little of interest in this picture.</P>
