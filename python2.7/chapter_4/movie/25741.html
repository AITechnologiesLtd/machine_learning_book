<P>  Let's say you're one of the record number of visitors to New
York City this summer.  After hitting the usual spots, your
artsy friend takes you to the Museum of Modern Art--which
you shamefully enter despite the strike.  You spend three
hours looking at works of Kandinsky, Picasso, Magritte and
your feet are tired and your mind is a blur.  You go outside
and your friend suggests that you head right on uptown to the
Guggenheim after which you would finish the day at the
Museum of the American Indian.  What do you say? 
Something unprintable?  Of course.  This is not to say that
you're a boor.  You certainly did appreciate the colorful and
imaginative works that MoMA had to offer, but when the
colors blend into a shapeless rainbow, you've had enough
and want nothing more than to head across the street for a
burger, get a nap at the hotel, and then take in a Broadway
show that has a real story and not just a bunch of impressive
visuals.</P>
<P>   That's how I felt about "The Cell."  This sci-fi movie with
horror-genre undertones is a painter's palette of color and a
Jungian melange of dreamlike imagination.  Tom Foden's
production design, particularly of a glorified and dangerous
fish tank that can hold thousands of gallons of water and yet
empty out in eight seconds is a stunner.  April Napier's
costumes could get window space at New York trendiest
boutiques.  Paul Laufer's lensing captures the vastness of a
North African desert and the interior of a person's mind with
equal aplomb, and who better to helm the pot pourri than
music video director Tarsen Singh or to parade about the set
than Jennifer Lopez--whom "Variety" critic Emanuel Levy has
just called "the sexiest woman in Hollywood"?</P>
<P>   But alas, the weak spot is Mark Protosevich, the
screenwriter and co-producer of this lavish spectacle, as his
chronicle is swallowed by the ocular.  The tale does have
some suspense, particularly involving the race against the
clock to find a young and frightened woman who is trapped in
a fishbowl, the water about to rise above her head in a matter
of hours if she is not found by the dauntless men of the FBI. 
And as one of the scientists explains, even though the villain
is in an irreversible coma, the man could actually cause
bodily harm to the good guys who have entered his mind--I
guess in much the way you can have a nightmare and, not
realizing that you are simply dreaming, will wake up in a cold
sweat, teeth chattering, mind discombobulated.</P>
<P>   Inspired, perhaps, by such sci-fi movies as David
Cronenberg's "eXistenZ," in which a virtual reality game
designer gets trapped in one of her own games with a man
who is supposed to be protecting her; and Ken Russell's
1980 work, "Altered States," about a scientist who uses
himself as a guinea pig; "The Cell" opens enigmatically in a
stunning African desert as Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez)
rides a stately stallion while wrapped in a drop-dead white
costume as she proceeds toward a small boy, Edward Baines
(Colton James).  The real Baines is in a coma: she has
entered his schizophrenic mind to see what makes him tick
with the goal of helping him by this unique understanding.
The so-called synaptic-transfer machine that enables her to
do this was invented by Henry West (Dylan Baker), and
presided over by Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste). 
While this transpires, a far more gruesome scenario is being
enacted as serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio)
tortures and kills young women by dropping them into an
hidden underwater tank.  When Stargher is caught, comatose
as a result of a brain disease, FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince
Vaughn) runs the unconscious killer over to Henry West's lab
with the hope of discovering the location of the water tank. 
Stargher is the only one who knows this, and he is no longer
able to help.  There is one hope. Catherine must enter the
sick man's mind to see how he thinks, win his trust, and get
him to divulge the information before his latest victim, Julia
Hickson (Tara Subkoff), is drowned.</P>
<P>   The major part of the enterprise is taken up by Tarsem's
desire to impress the audience with his direction of some
startling scenes, astonishing even when compared to his
typical MTV work and designed to unnerve even the cynics
who have seen it all and have played the video games.  The
film would have been much better had Tarsem balanced his
visuals with more dialogue, not only psychological palaver but
political exchanges between Catherine and Peter.  Peter, for
example, explains that he had been a prosecutor who gave
up that career and became an FBI agent, disgusted when a
killer is freed on a technicality and proceeds to dismember a
new victim.  Catherine, by contrast, is what Peter might call a
bleeding-heart liberal, a woman who has extraordinary
empathy with the deviant and the sick and uses her gift to
bring them back to some degree of normality. </P>
<P>   Instead we are taken into a world that would please
painters like Heironymous Bosch, Magritte, Salvador Dali and
the like, a continuous array of startling imagery broken up
from time to time with breaks to the real world.  While the
optics are indeed bold and imaginative, they are overdone
and what's more, Vincent D'Onofrio--a terrific actor who
scared the pants off many a viewer as a psycho killer in
Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket"--is not at all frightening this time
around.  Instead he is almost laughable in his array of 
costumes and facial contortions, expressions of what is going
on in his sick mind which Catherine has entered.  Vince
Vaughn is convincing as an FBI agent who, considering his
hard-core conservative views of crime is surprisingly laid-back
and whose mellow tones mesh with the near-whispers of the
lovely Ms. Lopez.  </P>
<P>   If you're not overly concerned about narrative, "The Cell" is
worth seeing for its brazen visual concept, and for its
believable acting particularly by side roles performed by Jake
Weber as the straight-arrow FBI agent, Marianne Jean-
Baptiste as the wary but ultimately daring scientist, and
Gareth Williams as a monstrously abusive father.</P>
