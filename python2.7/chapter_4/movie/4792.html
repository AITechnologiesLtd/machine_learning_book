<PRE>                               THE BIRDCAGE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          It was way back in 1978 that La Cage Aux Folles, the
hilarious French film about homosexuals, the transvestite nightclub,
the owner, his partner (in more ways than one), first arrived here.
It was an instant critical and box office success.  That could only
mean one thing: a sequel.  Three years later that arrived but the
truism about sequels held and so that was an instant flop.  Since
everyone thinks "I can do anything better than you," another sequel
arrived 3 years later and it was an abomination.  That brings us to
today's version,  "The birdcage ."   directed by Mike Nichols and
oooh!. Vive la difference..</P>
<P>          Nichols'  version brings the story not merely up to date but
demonstrates the difference between the "family values."  rightwing
politicians are pushing and what the value of a family really is.
And Nichols' direction plus Elaine May's script are right on target.</P>
<P>          About the cast:  Everyone is exactly right; the casting is
perfect.  So much has been said and written about Robin Williams (who
here plays the father of a "straight" son) it is almost superfluous to
say more.  But in a couple of seconds he can take you from laughter to
tears and back.  Would that there were more fathers like Armand
Goldman, the gay father.</P>
<P>          In the most wonderful performance of a very successful
career in cinema, the one who got to me as the most brilliant was
Dianne Weist as Louise Keeley, the wife of the conservative Senator
(Gene Hackman) who are the parents of the lovely Barbara (Calista
Flockhart).  Special mention should be made, too, of Dan Futterman.
who plays Armand's loving, devoted son to his father and father's
partner,  Albert (Nathan Lane.)  Lane, who  is mostly known for his
work on the Broadway stage, is terrific.  The whole movie is
terrific.  Did I like it?  No, I loved it..</P>
