<P>_Soul_Survivors_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>        With its ripped-from-the-pages-of-_YM_ cast (Eliza Dushku, Wes Bentley,
Casey Affleck, and newcomer Melissa Sagemiller), at first glance
_Soul_Survivors_ looks just like the lot of teen-targeted horror films that have
infected screens the past five years.  However, those going in expecting the
usual slice-'n-dice will instead get something quite different.  But "different"
doesn't exactly mean "good," and this surprisingly sedate supernatural story
proves that point quite well.</P>
<P>        The focal foursome are introduced with a backstory knotty enough to fill
a season of _Dawson's_Creek_.  Sean and Cassie (Affleck and Sagemiller, who
perhaps not coincidentally has a Gwyneth-ish vibe about her) are in love, but
Cassie's ex Matt (Bentley), who also happens to be Sean's best friend, still
carries a torch.  Meanwhile, Cassie's freespirited best friend Annabel (Dushku),
who is apparently cozy with Matt, remains unaware--or at least pretends to
be--of his lingering romantic feelings for her buddy.  Got that?</P>
<P>        Actually, it doesn't matter, for one fateful night where Sean discovers
Cassie and Matt in a clinch becomes more dramatic when the quartet are involved
in an auto wreck.  The accident claims one of them, and while the other two
survivors appear to have escaped unscathed both mentally and physically, Cassie
is plagued by disturbing visions.  What is real?  What isn't?  Will you care?</P>
<P>        Not likely.  Between the accident scene and its conclusion,
_Soul_Survivors_ is an exercise in spinning wheels, a muddle of images, ideas,
and characters (such as Angela Featherstone's androgynous lesbian role) that
don't go anywhere, let alone make any sense.  Writer-director Steve Carpenter
was obviously going for a dream-like atmosphere, but even when taking such a
surreal bent, events should follow some sort of internal logic.  They don't
here; one scene has Cassie having a major row with a friend, and the next scene
has the friend cheering her on at a swim meet.  Cassie's visions are supposed to
instill horror, but would-be shocks such as a rather violent nosebleed and a
shot of blood going down a bath drain aren't exactly the stuff that nightmares
are made of.</P>
<P>        Artisan's much-publicized decision to recut the film from an R to a
PG-13 may have indeed diluted Carpenter's original vision, but when the
"meaning" behind _Soul_Survivors_ becomes clear, issues of explicitness become
moot.  That Carpenter didn't have the heart to come up with one halfway creepy
scene, even in PG-13 form, speaks of his true intent, which reveals itself to be
far more gooey and touchy-feely than one would have expected--and, hence, a lot
less fun.</P>
