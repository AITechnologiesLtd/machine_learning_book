<PRE>Snatch
a film review by Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>WHAT IT'S ABOUT: </PRE>
<P>Well, it's kinda hard to explain. It's centered around a collective circle of 
British gangsters who are all in one way or another trying to get their hands 
on a huge diamond the size of a peach. The movie jumps back and forth between 
four individual stories with their own subplots to bring it all together 
through excellent editing and direction. It's a macabre crime flick in the 
spirit of "Pulp Fiction," or "Get Shorty," but with that zany European twist 
to give it an original, fresh outlook. You're not really expected to follow 
the story to the letter since there's about a dozen main characters and the 
plot constantly twists and turns, the film is about the ride of it all. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>I haven't seen such a good mix of direction, editing and screenplay in quite 
a few years. It's such a welcomed change of pace compared to all the 
countless Quentin Tarantino wannabes (ahem - Christopher McQuarrie). </P>
<P>I really enjoyed how "Snatch" is a mix of so many different characters who 
are all connected in some way but don't really know it. I usually have a 
difficult time trying to keep track of an ensemble cast so director Guy 
Ritchie does us a favor by introducing all the characters at the beginning by 
telling you who they are and what role they play in the British criminal 
underground. No heavy taxing on the brain that way! </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>The British accents can often be indecipherable (and I don't just mean Brad 
Pitt's character). The actual story is quite a challenge to properly follow 
and the ending is a bit more violent and cliche than it needed to be. </P>
<PRE>OVERALL CRITIQUE: </PRE>
<P>Excellent performances by Pitt and the entire cast make the film a success. 
When you're making a crime movie that's supposed to be funny at times and 
deadly serious at other times you'd better have good actors who can pull off 
both comedy and drama smoothly. </P>
<P>I really enjoyed the editing and direction of the film, even if the story was 
a bit tricky. In fact, I can't help but think it was purposely written so 
complicated to make us THINK it's really a piece of brilliance. I mean, this 
is a crime movie at the core so often the action and sheer carnal violence 
are the driving forces. </P>
<P>So you want a rollercoaster ride at the movies? "Snatch" is just that, 
exciting, funny, suspenseful, always entertaining and creative as could be. 
Falls a little flat at the end but that's forgivable. Will very likely be on 
my top ten list for 2001 and is best movie of the year thus far. </P>
<PRE>RATING: ***1/2 (out of **** = good) </PRE>
