<P>_Vertical_Limit_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>With its dizzying depictions of courageous derring-do atop rugged
mountain peaks and perilously close to steep cliffs, the trailer to
Columbia's _Vertical_Limit_ has been leaving many a moviegoer
breathless... much like the teaser to the same studio's mountain climbing
actioner of seven years ago, _Cliffhanger_.  That's where the
similarities end.  _Cliffhanger_ was by no means a great film, but it was
an exciting thrill ride with no pretense whatsoever as to what it is and
what it should be.  The fact that the stars of _Vertical_Limit_ have gone
on record to say that they were attracted to the "relationships" in the
piece explains exactly how this film goes wrong--that and the name "Chris
O'Donnell" toplining the cast credits.</P>
<P>As displayed in _GoldenEye_ and _The_Mask_of_Zorro_, director Martin
Campbell knows how to stage a suspenseful action scene, and the action
sequences in _Vertical_Limit_ confirm his talent.  The first scene, in
which three climbers are left dangling on a single thin, quickly
unraveling cord, more than recalls the memorable open of _Cliffhanger_
and holds up fairly well in comparison.  In a later scene, a climber
makes a deadly slide down a snowy slope, narrowly avoiding a plunge off
of a cliff thanks to a fortuitously timed swing of a pickaxe.  Other
scenes involving the danger that can only come when you combine snow,
mountainous terrain, and canisters of nitroglycerin also generate
palpable, nail-biting tension.</P>
<P>The problem is that the visceral shocks are in the service of a script
that actually includes the stultifying line "There's not gonna be just
snow--there'll be ice and rock."  Those "relationships" that so enamored
the actors?  Number one: Peter Garrett (O'Donnell) and his sister, Annie
(Robin Tunney).  Following in the footsteps of their father, Annie is a
famous mountain climber; Peter was also a skilled in the activity, but he
gave it up following the incident that led to their father's death.  When
Annie and cohorts Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and wealthy adventure-seeker
Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) end up trapped in a crevasse while attempting
to scale K2, Peter must put his guilt and self-doubt aside and try to
rescue them.  Number two: Vaughn and Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn).  Wick
is a mysterious mountain-dwelling loner who bears a grudge against Vaughn
for reasons initially unknown; he joins Peter's rescue teamin hopes of
getting a chance to settle the score.  As if these relationships weren't
hackneyed enough (and to fulfill some unwritten requirement for
"romance"), there's the out-of-nowhere attraction that develops between
Peter and the fetching French-Canadian nurse (_GoldenEye_'s "good" Bond
girl, Izabella Scorupco) who tags along for the mission.</P>
<P>All the overplayed and underthought melodrama is rendered even more
ludicrous by the overly earnest cast.  Not even Glenn, sporting dirty,
stringy locks and one toeless foot, seems to have a grasp on how
ridiculous his character or the entire affair is.  Whether or not that
latter fact is lost on O'Donnell is anyone's guess.  One has to wonder
why Hollywood continues to cast this stiff block of boredom in headlining
roles; to call him "vanilla" is to give that savory flavor an undeserved
bad name.  His lazy, inexpressive performance here should prove to the
suits once and for all that this walking, talking rice cake incarnate
does not have what it takes to become a major star.  Similarly,
_Vertical_Limit_ overall does not have what it takes to deserve major
holiday hit status.</P>
