<P>Press Release:
--------------
     A favorite at this year's Seattle International Film Festival,
TWENTY BUCKS features an illustrious cast of characters who come into
contact with a particular $20 bill, from its withdrawal at a bank
machine through its inevitable demise.  The journey of the greenback
touches the lives of a struggling young writer (Elizabeth Shue); a
street-person obsessed with winning the lottery (Linda Hunt); a
blue-collar fiance (Brendan Fraser) about to marry the boss' daughter
(Sam Jenkins); a priest who runs a Bingo game (Spalding Gray); a kind,
fortune-telling grandmother (Gladys Knight); her young,
rap-singing-Craig Clairborne-wannabe grandson (Kamau Holloway); and two
ill fated hold-up thieves (Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buscemi).  To
some, the $20 bill brings power, to others a symbol for their dream.
As it weaves a path providing food for the hungry, evidence for murder,
inspiration for the working class, and a tip for a stripper, this
twenty bucks touches the lives of many people, and in some way, changes
the future of them all.</P>
<P>TV-Guide(tm)-Review 
------------------- 
     A twenty-dollar bill serves as a device to examine an unexpectedly
inter-connected group sf people.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     Yet again, a movie exploring an idea that I've wondered about ...
what happens to that $20 I just changed?  I had just assumed I'd never
see or some into contact with a particular $20 again.  Well, you've
heard of the expression ".. keeps showing up like a bad penny?"  Now
we've got a $20 bill instead of a penny.  Inflation I guess.</P>
<P>     Initially when the twenty showed up in the presence of someone I'd
already seen, I thought "Waita minit' here, do you expect me to believe
that?"  I put that aside and just decided to watch the movie.</P>
<P>     After the show, I realized that the implausible re-occurrence of
the $20 is what makes this movie work so well.  It gives you a chance
to identify with the characters.  With so many characters and
relatively short times with each, it is a real testimony to the
screenwriters that they were able to engage my feelings.  In particular
I'm thinking of the article-in-the-wallet scene (no spoiler, so siree)
between Emily and her mother.</P>
<P>     My favorite scenes are with Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buscemi as
thieves, followed closely the entire plot-line with the struggling
writer played by Elisabeth Shue.</P>
<P>     I went into this movie expecting to see a SLACKER-ish film with
lots of characters passing briefly on-screen, never to be seen or
thought of again.  And although SLACKER was an interesting film (taken
in moderation--I'm definitely OD'd at one willing and three captive
viewings) it was boring.  I didn't *care* about the characters.  There
wasn't much situational variety--generally one small group after
another being accosted by a ranting loon.  Instead, TWENTY BUCKS
delivered an interesting and engaging movie with "main characters" that
I cared about, and only the minor players serve to pass the buck. (I
just *HAD* to put that in here somewhere. Sorry. -tak)</P>
<P>     You may be tempted to get up and leave a little early (you can see
the end coming, as two characters almost literally walk off into the
sunset) but there *IS* another minute or so after the old fashioned
"The End" script where the fate of the twenty is revealed.</P>
<P>Technical Notes: 
-----------------
     I don't really like looking for technical stuff, it tends to get
in the way of me watching the film.  The technical stuff should operate
in the background for the most part.  And that's what happened with
TWENTY BUCKS--no obvious "film effects" to interrupt your immersion
in the story line.  Which was just fine by me.</P>
<P>Talk with ScreenWriter Leslie Bohem:
------------------------------------
     After the screening, the local promoter introduced the
screenwriter, Leslie Bohem.  He fielded questions from the more than
half-full theatre that remained to hear him.  His responses were
elaborate, frank and informative.  We stayed for about twenty minutes
before they had to clear the theatre for the regular programming.</P>
<P>     The script was originally written by Leslie's father, Endre Bohem,
in 1935 (possibly the longest film in development).  After it was
accepted it was rewritten ten more times during the two-to-three year
filming process.  Most of the rewrites were not of the main plot, but
better ways the twenty could move around.</P>
<P>     This is his first screenplay that has made it to the SilverScreen,
though he said he's written 35+ screenplays and was paid for 25 of
them.  He has other film credits. After some arm-twisting from the
audience, he said they were mostly stuff in the horror genre--NIGHTMARE
ON ELM STREET V (the one with the baby), and some others.  He joked
about liking to exploring the father-child relationship (which he does
quite a bit in TWENTY BUCKS).  He appeared sort of embarrassed that he
worked in that genre, though not because he regretted the work, it
seemed he didn't want us to hold it against him.</P>
<P>     The movie was produced on a smallish budget (he jokingly said
"... 1/3 the budget of DEMOLITION MAN ...").  He was amazed at the quality
of the actors they were able to attract.  "They all worked cheap."  Many
of the actors were particularly drawn to the roles, especially Linda
Hunt, who relished her role as the street-person.</P>
<P>     He had not seen RESERVOIR DOGS, nor did he have any real say in
the casting.  So the irony in Steve Buscemi's (Mr Pink, the
"professional") role is particularly good.</P>
<P>     Christopher Lloyd's thief character was written as being extremely
pragmatic, but Bohem was pleased that the character turned sinister as
well.</P>
<P>     The only scene that remained constant through the two-to-three
years of intensive rewrites was the thieving scene.  This scene is
Leslie's favorite and was written by Leslie over a twelve-hour period
and is essentially unchanged.</P>
<P>     Much of the film has real life incidents from the life of Leslie's
father and co-writer, Endre Bohem.  These include the immigration
story, the bubble-gum thing, and the story-in-the-wallet.</P>
<P>     In response to a question about gratuitous nudity in the bachelor
party scene, he said that he didn't remember if he'd written it in to
be gratuitous or not (but he has no qualms about telling us if he
did).  The scene was written primarily to show the embarrassment and
awkwardness of such activities.  He remembers writing mainly to show
one character's (Buddha) bluster turn to embarrassment when dealing
with the stripper alone.</P>
<P>     This movie only opens in selected areas (San Francisco, Seattle
and New York) so if you're lucky enough to live in these areas go see
this movie.  The local promoter and Leslie Bohem both indicated that
its wider distribution depends on good box office performance and
reviews.  It certainly has my blessing.</P>
