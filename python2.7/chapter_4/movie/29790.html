<P>   Don't you just hate going to the dentist?  Scripters Paul
Felopulos and David Atkins have conjured up one patient who
likes going so much that when she needs a root canal, she not
only looks forward to getting it treated but seeks out four
dentists before she allows any of them to do much with the
decayed molar.  Going to four dentists for the love of meeting
and talking with them? This has got to be a fictional character. 
To be fair, though, young Susan Ivey (Helena Bonham Carter)
has an ulterior motive.  She does not hesitate to seduce them, at
least digging her claws into DDS  Frank Sangster (Steve
Martin), but sex is not her ultimate objective.  Susan is a drug 
addict and dentists carry refrigerators full of chemicals from
novocaine to nitrous to injectable cocaine to demerol.  Susan is
clever enough to persuade the men with the drills to write
prescriptions, forges a higher amount, and off she goes 
to kill her pain.</P>
<P>   "Novocaine" is a dark comedy featuring one of our top comics,
Steve Martin, in a role not as sinister as the one he played in
David Mamet's marvelously written thriller "The Spanish
Prisoner" nor as flat-out hilarious as the dentist in Frank Oz's
"Little Shop of Horrors."  He's somewhere between, first shown
as a highly successful practitioner engaged to anal-compulsive
hygienist Jean Noble (Laura Dern) with Lynne Thigpen as his no-
nonsense but affectionate receptionist.  He becomes the victim of
a series of mishaps that ultimately finds him a suspect for
murder, a dilemma he could have avoided had he not
succumbed to the temptation in the form of an unstable,
conniving woman whose eroticism charms him because Susan is
the opposite of his compulsively neat and orderly fiancee.</P>
<P>   Though David Atkins's film is overplotted, with the director
juggling several conceits including sibling dysfunction.  Susan
has an incestuous thing going with her wastrel brother Duane
(Scott Caan) while Dr. Sangster feels an obligation to care for his
unsuccessful, envious, drug-and-drink addicted sib Harlan (Elias
Koteas).   "Novocaine" is frequently as giddy as a ride on
nitrous--which does not come close to dulling the pain felt by the
good doctor as his life takes on the decay for which rotting teeth
provide an apt metaphor.  </P>
<P>   Czech-born photographer Vilko Filac peppers the narrative with
x-ray shots of patients' teeth and entire heads, skeletal figures
lurid enough to scare the kids at Halloween while a non-intrusive,
effective score is provided by "Edward Scissorhands" musician
Steve Bartek.</P>
<P>   Atkins, whose script for "Arizona Dream" dealt with the loss of
the American Dream, plays winningly with a similar theme this
time around as well,  highlighting a person who has it all and yet
is vaguely dissatisfied and helps bring disaster upon himself
when his brain transfers to a position below his waist.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
