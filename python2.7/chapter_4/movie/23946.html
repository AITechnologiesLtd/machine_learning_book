<P>STIR OF ECHOES (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: David Koepp
Stars: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn, Zachary
David Cope, Jenny Morrison, Liza Weil, Chalon Williams
Running time: 99 minutes.</P>
<P>What have we here?  A cute young kid who can see dead people
and talk to ghosts?  But before you can scoff: "Shades of The Sixth
Sense", Stir Of Echoes pushes in another direction altogether.
Writer/director David Koepp, best known for his collaborations with
Brian De Palma (Mission Impossible and Snake Eyes, etc) and
screenplays for films like Jurassic Park, etc, turns this potentially
familiar and derivative material into an unnerving thriller about
murder and obsession.  Tom (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe, from Dream With The Fishes, etc) are a happy working class
couple who live in a nice neighbourhood in Chicago with their six year
old son Jake (newcomer Zachary David Cope), who seems to be sensitive
to the disturbing undercurrents of their house.  They are unaware that
Jake sees and talks to a ghostly girl who mysteriously appears in
their house.</P>
<P>Then, during a party, the sceptical Tom is hypnotised by his
sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas, playing yet another of those
marginal kooks that she does so well).  Unfortunately, Tom is left
with disturbing visions as a result of that experience, and becomes
obsessed with images of a young girl who apparently disappeared six
months earlier.  Lisa seems unable to reverse the effects of her
hypnotism.  Tom's behaviour becomes more erratic and driven, which
disturbs Maggie.</P>
<P>Rational explanations for Tom's post-hypnotic behaviour are a
little thin on the ground, which adds to the intense and chilling
development of suspense, but does little for the movie's credibility.
There is no real sense of mystery either, as more astute members of
the audience should probably be able to pick whodunit and what they
did well before the surprising revelations.</P>
<P>That Stir Of Echoes works so well and gradually draws the
audience into its web of suspense and unease is due largely to Koepp's
atmospheric direction.  Bacon's intense and volatile performance as
the single-minded and inexplicably driven Tom also suitably builds up
the air of uneasiness.  However, in an important role as the sensitive
kid, young Cope does not possess half the charisma or natural charm
and maturity that Haley Joel Osment brought to his similar role in The
Sixth Sense.  Inevitably, Stir Of Echoes will be, fairly or unfairly,
compared with the vastly superior The Sixth Sense, although this film
was made first.  Unlike that film though, this one doesn't have that
killer kick in the tail to make it memorable.</P>
