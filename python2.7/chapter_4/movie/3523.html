<PRE>                               PICTURE BRIDE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is a love story quite unlike others.  In 1918,
sixteen-year-old and beautiful Riyo (Youki Kudoh), an orphan is
coaxed into leaving Japan to marry a Japanese sugar cane worker in
Hawaii after an exchange of photos.  As we learn, both her parents
died some years ago of tuberculosis, a contagious disease.  Riyo's life
with her well-meaning aunt was miserable because the parents of her
schoolmates forbade their playing with her for fear of catching the
illness.  Going to Hawaii, far away from Japan, no one would know the
shame she had felt about her parents' illness.  Riyo, herself, is
healthy.</P>
<P>     Arriving at immigration in Hawaii, she is introduced to her
prospective husband who has paid her fare.   Royo looks at him and at
the photo and says, "There must be some mistake.  This is not the man
in the photo."  He, Matsuji (Akira Takayama), sheepishly explains that
it is indeed he but it was the most recent photo he could find.  He is
now 43.</P>
<P>     There is no turning back to Japan as Riyo does not have any
money.  Next day she is out in the cane fields working away with other
Japanese and Filipinas.  At the shack that is her home, she will not
allow her husband, Matsuji, to touch her.  She decides to work twice
as hard, save her money and return to Japan.  Things do not work out
that way.</P>
<P>     The film portrays the life of the sugar cane workers who were led
to believe they would one day return to their homeland ... but never
did; the "Simon Legree" on horseback with his whip, as he rides up and
down the furrows spurring on the workers.  And it tells about Riyo's
friendship with Kana (Tamlyn Tomita) another woman worker who shows her
how to do laundry for the workers, after her own day is done, so she
can save more money for the trip home that never happens.  Some 20,000
of these "picture brides" came from Japan, and many came from Korea and
Okinawa in the first twenty years of the 20th century.  Nevertheless,
this is a love story and a lovely one at that.</P>
<P>     Toshiro Mishune appears in a film about Samurai warriors that is
shown to the workers.</P>
<P>     Tamlyn Tomita appeared in THE JOY LUCK CLUB, KARATE KID II, and in
many TV shows.</P>
<P>     The film is approximately divided between spoken English and
Japanese with Japanese subtitles for the spoken Japanese.</P>
