<PRE>As Good As It Gets
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) Other people will tell you what's good about AS GOOD AS
IT GETS. They are not wrong, but too many people are putting this flawed
movie on their "ten best" lists, and I think a contrasting point of view
is deserved. </P>
<P>The dialogue written for Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt by Mark Andrus
and Brooks is funny and fresh. Nicholson is great as Melvin, the cross
between Archie Bunker, Ebenezer Scrooge, and WHAT ABOUT BOB. Hunt is
very good as Carol the waitress, who endures Melvin when nobody else
will. Greg Kinnear is alright as Simon, Melvin's gay artist neighbor
whose little doggy is a source of friction between them. </P>
<P>When Simon is hospitalized from a serious beating, Melvin is "suckered
in, set up, pushed around" into watching Simon's dog for him. The story
shows Melvin's slow and gradual redemption, starting with his affection
for the little dog. </P>
<P>Melvin shows real progress toward becoming a likeable human being,
developing friendships both with Carol and with Simon, but the movie
runs into problems toward the end. </P>
<P>The first sign of trouble comes when, after being paid the nicest
compliment of her life, Carol can't forgive Melvin a relatively small
slip of the tongue, even though she knows of his psychological handicap.
She storms out of the restaurant and into the arms of Simon. Simon SEEMS
to pose no sexual competition to Melvin, but his sensitivity proves
enough to satisfy Carol's needs. Carol and Simon realize they have
something good without Melvin. </P>
<P>If that scene is as true as it plays, then the movie should logically
end as a tragedy for our main character Melvin. But because the genre is
romantic comedy, things have to work out for Melvin, and that makes the
previous scene a manipulative lie. </P>
<P>What happens next is entirely too much will-they-or-won't-they. Since
the movie didn't end after Carol and Simon's night together, we know
that all the "tension" is a false attempt to pull on our heartstrings
one more time before the movie ends. It was a real disappointment after
an otherwise good movie. </P>
<P>Perhaps another way to summarize what's wrong with AS GOOD AS IT GETS is
to say that the movie treats its female lead as an object. Melvin has
spent the entire movie proving himself worthy of Carol's affections, and
she has even come to accept them, fully knowing his flaws. But because
the writers need to drag the story out another 20 minutes, they have
Carol reject Melvin once or twice. She is not acting as a human being,
she is acting as the fickle object of Melvin's affections, serving the
purposes of her writers, not of herself. </P>
<P>AS GOOD AS IT GETS reminds me of last year's JERRY MAGUIRE. Both are
heartwarming comedies about redemption, both are widely praised by
critics, but deep down, both are shallow and give too little freedom to
their characters, at the expense of manipulative, manufactured love
stories. 
This movie was a nice try: not quite perfect, but with lots of redeeming
qualities. Ordinarily I would recommend such a movie, but because this
movie has already gotten lots of praise - too much, in fact - I cannot.</P>
