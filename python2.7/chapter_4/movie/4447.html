<P>     The best poster art of 1995 is unquestionably the composite still
featured on ads for THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, showing a muscular
redheaded man purposefully rowing a boat across a sea peppered with
floating mines.  At the bow of the vessel, a younger girl, perhaps 10
years old, looks back over her shoulder almost balefully.  They're en
route to what looks like a cross between a mist-shrouded palace and an
oil rig, matte painted in sillhouette against the moonrise.  It's said
that a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one teases, offering
glimpses of a story that exists in the imagination, and is not
necessarily dependent on the "reality" established by the film it's
meant to promote.</P>
<P>     That picture isn't taken directly from the film, but it may as
well be.  Its evocative power is indicative of the real strengths of
the filmmaking duo of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.  These two
headstrong fantasists cut their teeth on music videos and television
commercials before settling in to make the much admired DELICATESSEN
(1991), a black European comedy about cannibalism.  Accordingly,
American audiences had their first real exposure to Jeunet and Caro
when art houses nationwide were blitzed with that film's trailer--a set
piece drawn straight from the movie itself, and involving the apparent
rhythms of lovemaking in an apartment building from hell and its impact
on everyday life in adjacent rooms.  To this day, even movie fans who
never saw the actual movie still harbor vivid memories of seeing the
brilliantly entertaining trailer to DELICATESSEN.</P>
<P>     That mastery of imagery and montage is what keeps Jeunet and
Caro's newest film from being a mere clutter of dazzling images.  CITY
OF LOST CHILDREN is something of a fable set in a city in either the
future or an alternate reality.  The movie has to do with a scientist
named Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who is aging prematurely because he
lacks the ability to dream.  Fighting to reverse the aging process, he
sends his blind minions out to kidnap the city's most potent
dreamers--the children--and bring them back so he can invade the
children's dreams and make them his own.  Circus strongman One (Ron
Perlman, the beefy guy from the posters) gets involved when his adopted
brother, little Denree (Joseph Lucien), is abducted by the Cyclops, who
see the world through one electronic eye and do Krank's bidding.
Events turn, and One teams up with the orphan Miette (Judith Vittet) on
a mission to invade Krank's laboratory and rescue his beloved brother.
The other characters in the laboratory include Krank's assistant, Miss
Bismuth (Mireille Mosse), a disembodied talking brain floating in a
fish tank (given witty, world- weary voice by Jean-Louis Trintignant),
and a battalion of clones (all of them played by Dominique Pinon).</P>
<P>     The actors are more than up to the challenge of breathing life
into the concept.  Perlman, a busy actor whose credits include THE NAME
OF THE ROSE, ROMEO IS BLEEDING, and last year's CRONOS, is entirely
credible as the simple strong man driven to his quest by love for a
child.  Daniel Emilfork's Krank is a bizarre yet pathetic creation, and
our distate for his persona is mitigated by our understanding of his
desperation (after all, we're the ones who paid money to visit someone
else's dream for an hour or two).  And whether it's Vittet playing an
orphan who's become wise and jaded beyond her years, or Lucien as the
toddler who's mostly unfazed by the pyrotechnics that have the other
kids screaming, the children here defy the Hollywood standard of
cinematic children who are by turns cutesy pies or obnoxious hams.
Since the children are the film's center, the metaphorical imaginative
core of a society that has perhaps forgotten the value of its dreams,
it's reassuring that the actors give unmannered performances that put
the histrionic antics of celebrity brats like Macauley Culkin in proper
perspective.</P>
<P>     Aided and abetted by Jean-Paul Gaultier's costuming, Caro's art
direction ensures that this city truly is something to behold, although
our visit is fragmented so that we have little opportunity to get a
sense for a whole environment.  For the most part, Caro and Jeunet
create their nightmare world by stacking their most striking visuals on
top of one another in a shot-by- shot montage that amplifies the
chaos.  But the real show-stoppers are the sequences that stretch the
film's tightly constrained sense of location while staying within the
episodic format (the best involves a spider's web, a shipwreck, and a
healthy sense of wonder), though even that doesn't shake the constant
feeling that we're watching master craftsmen at work, not peeking into
another universe.</P>
<P>     But when they work, oh boy, do they work.  Jeunet and Caro have a
keen sense of their characters, from the lead roles all the way down to
the bit parts, and the crucial dream sequences are marvelously surreal,
right down to the accompanying sound mix. (It's fitting that Sony is
releasing this one just before Christmas, because Santa figures in a
couple of the dreams, for better or for worse.) Angelo Badalamenti's
music is surprisingly effective throughout, and Miette's final
nightmare is nothing short of breathtaking.  The film contains a
remarkable number of digital effects shots, and indeed, is surprisingly
reliant on technical wizardry, whether it's allowing Pinon to play six
different parts on-screen at the same time, or enabling show- stopping
close-ups of Fleakins, the bug who offers up a flea's-eye view of the
world before shooting characters up with a strange poison.  The rich,
shadowy cinematography, which is a key part of the weirdness at work
here, is by Darius Khondji, who shot DELICATESSEN but also, probably
more famously, this year's Hollywood hit, SE7EN.</P>
<P>     But somewhere in the middle of all this, there's a story that
needs to be told, and the one here is just a little humdrum.  For all
its whacked-out creativity, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a bit short on
ideas for what to do with itself.  The dream thievery is reduced to a
child-in-peril excuse to get our obligatory hero into the laboratory,
and Krank's invasion of dreams isn't even fully distinguished from what
we might expect from a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.  And at the
climax, we're treated to a pretty rote escape-from-the-madman routine
that ends in a big explosion a la any number of American action
movies.  Would that a movie this wondrous weren't simultaneously so
formulaic.</P>
<P>     I'd hate to discourage any fan of the surreal from buying a
ticket, since it's a truly impressive piece of work.  Still, something
very important is missing.  It's all well and good to break out all the
wide-angle lenses, run amok with the set design, and frighten a few
children, but I do wish there was a little more light at the end of the
tunnel.  It seems that Jeunet and Caro are very satisfied with what
they have wrought, but it's hard to experience the film on a very
personal level, because we're never given the sense that anything real
is at stake, or that there's anything in the rather unpleasant world
presented to us that's really worth fighting for.  For all their
formidable skills, Jeunet & Caro need to balance all of the nightmare
and grimace with just a little bit of hope and magic.  I'm rooting for
them to deliver the goods next time -- but I'm not sure they have it in
them.</P>
<P>     Technical note: The credit scroll bears a designation that some
prints have been struck with digital sound, but the theater I was in
just turned the Dolby Stereo up to a full roar.  The almost deafening
volume was appropriate to the film, but the constant popping and
crackling from the Angelika's overloaded sound system was not.  Try to
see this one in a digital auditorium if you can.</P>
