<PRE>                      THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>                 Capsule: Erick Zonca's film tells the and
            moderately predictable story of two young women
            living a picaresque life together in a borrowed
            apartment.  Somewhat in the style of Truffaut's
            THE 400 BLOWS they live amorally, stealing
            where they can.  Their life is a hand to mouth
            existence with occasional relationships with
            men.  The portraits are well-etched, but the
            story is very low-key and overly long.  Rating:
            5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>            New York Critics: 13 positive, 1 negative, 2
            mixed</PRE>
<P>THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is basically a simple slice-of-life story told
at a leisurely pace.  Twenty-one year old Isa (Elodie Bouchez) comes to
the town of Lille in the north part of France to be near her boyfriend
only to find out he is out of the country working on a construction
job.  With no money and no place to live she barely makes enough to feed
herself by cutting pictures from magazines and turning them into
greeting cards and religious decorations which she sells on the street
claiming the proceeds are for charity.  She spends her time freeloading
and getting into trouble.  For a few weeks she lives without a home
begging from strangers.  During a stint in an abortive attempt at a job
in a sewing factory she befriends Marie (Natacha Regnier) and moves
into an apartment that Marie is looking after for Sandine, a comatose
woman that neither Iso nor Marie has actually met.  Marie feels little
gratitude to Sandine, but Isa feels some responsibility to their
unwitting benefactor and spends hours in the hospital reading to the
unconscious Sandine.  Isa and Marie meet and make friends with two
working class men, Fredo and Charly (Jo Prestia and Patrick Mercado),
who do security at concerts and work as club bouncers.  The two remain
only occasionally romantic friends.  But then Marie meets and gets
involved with Chris (Gregoire Colin), the attractive young owner of two
up-scale bars.  Isa does not think much of Chris and believes that Marie
is reaching beyond her station.  She is certain that Marie will only be
hurt in the end.</P>
<P>Though not nearly as disturbed as the woman returned from the dead she
plays in J'AIMERAIS PAS CREVER UN DIMANCHE, Bouchez plays Isa as punk
and sassy, yet with a sincere and caring core.  Isa lavishes hours of
care and attention on Sandine, but shies away from receiving any
gratitude for the effort.  Regnier plays Marie as a romantic in spite of
herself, lacking either in free will or sense.</P>
<P>Erick Zonca, who co-wrote the screenplay as well as directed, has given
us a detailed and three-dimensional picture of two very marginalized
women.  His Isa and Marie just get by, frequently by stealing, with very
little thought for the future.  They are not the most likable
characters, but they are probably much like women that can be found in
any city.  Zonca does not romanticize and makes little attempt to
excuse, but they are very believable and very real people.  One is
reminded both of THE 400 BLOWS in the earlier parts of the film and of
"La Boheme" later.  His deliberate pacing may well end up being more
frustrating in the US than in his native France.  And it would be one
thing if the pacing were used to add depth to the characters.
Frequently they are involved in some activity that tells us little
about their character beyond that Isa is not particularly fastidious
with her nail polish.</P>
<P>Overall there is really about a half-hour or perhaps an hour's worth of
story here spread thinly over 113 minutes.  While the title is not quite
as sarcastic and bitter as ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE, this is not a world
to which the viewer may want to contribute so much time.  I give the
film 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
