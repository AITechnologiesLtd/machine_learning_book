<PRE>                          THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER
                       A film review by Chris Palmer
                        Copyright 1990 Chris Palmer</PRE>
<P>     I went to see THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER this weekend and was totally
impressed by how wonderful the animation was.  In characterization and
plot tension, it wasn't up to the standards of THE LITTLE MERMAID, but
it was very funny and quite exciting.</P>
<P>     This movie was a showcase of almost every type of animation
possible.  Extensive use of multi-plane cameras, roto-scoping (Cody's
mother and the rangers), and, best of all, some amazing computer
animation.  By creating computer models of vehicles, buildings, and
backgrounds, the animators were allowed a greater degree of freedom.
With the exception of the opening scenes of Ayer's Rock, the
message-sent-around the world, and the New York flying scenes, all of
the computer animation was rotoscoped by the animators so there was no
discontinuity between the hand-drawn cels and the computer aided cells.
All you see is amazingly complex, full-perspective motion.  McLeach's
vehicle has to be seen to be believed.  Some computer animation was also
present in the short feature, "The Prince and the Pauper," notably the
snow (quite nice) and several shots of the King's wagon.</P>
<P>     I'm sorry if this has been a strictly technical review so far.
This is a very good children's movie, but I think anyone should enjoy
it.  However, if you are cynical or find too many faults in the plot,
you can always fall back on looking at the pretty pictures.</P>
<PRE>     Now, on to the movie itself...</PRE>
<P>     THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER is a sequel to THE RESCUERS (Duh).  It is
about a young Australian boy named Cody who is kidnapped by the evil
poacher, McLeach, who wants him to reveal where the nest of the giant
eagle is located.  Through the R.A.S.  (Rescuers Aid Society) network,
Cody's plight is relayed to New York and Bianca (Zsa Zsa Gabor) and
Bernard (Bob Newhart) are chosen to fly to Australia to rescue him.  Air
travel is courtesy of Wilbur (John Candy) an albatross (brother to
Orville of the first film).  Once in Australia, there are aided by
Jack?John?  (drat) (voice by Tristan Rogers), a cross between Crocodile
Dundee and Indiana Jones.  Along the way, they encounter many different
Australian animals, some animal-like and some characterized.</P>
<PRE>High Points:
        o The eagle, the flying scene brought tears to my eyes.
        o McLeach, his pet lizard, and his vehicle.
        o The animation in general (see above)
        o The scenery.  The Australian locations were a welcome relief
          from generic cartoon locations.  It gave the film a much
          stronger sense of reality.</PRE>
<PRE>Low Points:
        o Bianca and Bernard were OK, but they were probably the most
          boring characters in the film.
        o I liked the ending, but my nephew and several other children
          in the audience were left hanging a bit (no spoilers, but the
          movie doesn't show Cody's reunion with his mother or the
          release of some of McLeach's animals).</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (1..10):
        THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER     - 9
        "The Prince and the Pauper" - 10
