<PRE>I hate it when people talk at movies.</PRE>
<P>Usually, when audience members talk during a movie, it shows a fundamental
lack of disrespect to the moviemakers, the actors, and their fellow
patrons.  If they're talking about plot points they missed in the movie, it
shows that they're easily confused or just not paying attention.  If
they're talking about things other than the movie -- like where to go for
dinner afterward -- that's a sign that you're dealing with people who are
totally oblivious to their environment and to moviegoing etiquette.</P>
<P>I don't have any way to measure this, but I believe it's getting worse.  I
went to see Lawrence of Arabia last week at the Paramount Theater in Austin
(in 70mm format, the only way to go) and this woman behind me asked her
date what year the movie was set in... and he gave her a ten thousand word
masters thesis on World War I and the Triple Entente.  This intermixed with
a blow by blow account of the first ten minutes of the movie that she had
missed while standing in line to get popcorn.  He talked almost the whole
way through the movie... no mean feat when we're talking about a three-hour
movie.</P>
<P>I say that to say two things.  First, if you're the kind of person who
talks at movie theaters, you might want to consider renting movies instead,
so you can talk all you want without disturbing other people.</P>
<P>Second, Arlington Road has the best screenplay of the summer.  I know this
because during every slack moment in the second half of the movie, I could
hear everyone else in the theater whispering to each other, trying to keep
up with the twisty plot.  It wasn't individual voices as such, but a
general background buzz from bewildered people trying to figure out what
was coming next.</P>
<P>In this, possibly the dumbest summer in movie history, the summer of
Jar-Jar Binks, the summer dedicated to the glorification of the lowest
common denominator, Arlington Road is... Yes!  A Smart Movie!  Arlington
Road is not one of your artsy-fartsy Merchant Ivory films that you need a
degree in art history to appreciate, mind you, it's just a thriller... but
it's a smart thriller that stays two or three mental steps ahead of its
audience and never insults our intelligence by asking us to believe
anything really stupid.  The plot is simple enough -- a family of
terrorists move across the street from a terrorism expert, who gets
suspicious -- but the elaborations of that plot are deftly done.</P>
<P>For example, we know from the outset as an audience that the Tim Robbins
character is an evil terrorist.  We know this because movies about people
who have unfounded suspicions about their wacky neighbors don't do very
well.  We know this because of the credit sequence, which shows us
negatives of dogs and picket fences and crabgrass and lets us know that
evil lurks in the heart of suburbia.  And we know this because Robbins
plays his character with a featureless, dull exterior that proves that he's
hiding something.</P>
<P>But what makes Arlington Road so smart is that the Jeff Bridges character
doesn't know any of this stuff.  He's got his suspicions, but they're based
on next to nothing.  Bridges finds out, for example, that the Robbins
character is from St. Louis, where terrorists blew up that federal
building.  (Arlington Road pretends that the Murrah Building bombing took
place in St. Louis, but knows that we're smart enough to see through
this.)  Ipso facto, Robbins is a terrorist, right?  But Bridges can't make
anyone believe this but us.  There's one wrenching scene where he's trying
to explain things to Hope Davis (in the unappreciated girlfriend role), and
he's raving like a Class-A nutter, and she's holding him, and he can't stop
spouting off about how this guy next door is a terrorist.</P>
<P>Another sign of intelligence from Arlington Road is how it handles the
inherent insanity in the setup.  It makes sense, in a twisted, paranoid
sort of way, that the Bridges character would see terrorists everywhere,
but what would motivate the Robbins character to move right next door to
him?  (The housing shortage in DC isn't that bad, is it?)  Arlington Road
has an answer to this, one I won't share with you.</P>
<P>In fact, when you get right down to it, when you have a movie that's this
smart, with smart plot twists, there's not that much you can say about it
without spoiling the fun for everyone.  The minor things that help make the
movie work -- the pouty curve of Hope Davis's mouth, the perky smile of
Joan Cusack, the way the Robbins' two little girls look in plaid jumpers
while they bar the door to the house, the horrible things that happen to
Bridges's perfect hair during the course of the movie, Tim Robbins
lip-synching to the words of the Boy Scout oath --are great, but they're
secondary to the sinuous curve of the screenplay as it unwinds itself.</P>
<P>For all fans of Smart Movies, Arlington Road is as welcome as a tall glass
of lemonade during a heat wave, with smart performances, smart casting, and
smart directing complementing an exceptionally smart screenplay.  This...
yes!  is a movie to talk about.</P>
<PRE>(Just not in the theater while the movie is going on, please, and... HEY!
Put that cell phone down!  NOW!  People are trying to watch the movie, you
know...)
