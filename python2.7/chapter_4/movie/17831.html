<PRE>M (1931)
A film review by Steve Lipson</PRE>
<P>M: A warning against totalitarianism?</P>
<P>  Fritz Lang's M was made in 1931, in a Germany witnessing the rapid
growth of the Nazi party. When I first saw the movie, I took it to be
an ominous foreshadowing of the dangers of a totalitarian state, where
mob violence against undesirables is rampant and the authorities
ruthlessly put the supposed good of society over people's individual
freedoms. The incredibly bleak view of Berlin which Fritz Lang depicts
in the movie could let me see it no other way.  It was clear, at least
at first glance, that the audience was to react with disgust at the
oppressive tactics the police employ to catch the child murderer,
measures that make the city of Berlin a most unpleasant place to
live. I thought the movie perhaps may even have reflected Lang's
horror at the Nazi party--a disgust reflected in 1933 when, after
Goebbels offered to make him head of the German film industry, he
chose to flee the country instead.</P>
<P>  But my certainty of this interpretation as an accurate meaning of
the film began to change somewhat on second viewing. My earlier
attitude was in part shaped by my perception that the police's
high-handed and dictatorial tactics to investigate the murders were
getting nowhere, and that their obsessive search of one particular
house was barking up the wrong tree. But on second viewing, I changed
my mind and began to believe that the house they had under close
surveillance was in fact that of the killer (Peter Lorre). A check of
the Internet Movie Database character names confirmed that. Now,
suddenly, my original views of M as a warning against totalitarianism
came into question; after all, one could make the claim from the movie
that the police's oppressive tactics were effective and ultimately for
the good of society.</P>
<P>  My uncertainty as to M's meaning was heightened when I started to
think more of the creative forces behind the movie. Clearly, its
director Lang (whose mother was Jewish) held strongly anti-Nazi
views. But the screenplay of M was co-written by Lang's wife Thea von
Harbou, who herself was (or would become) a dedicated Nazi and would
divorce Lang over the matter. Thus, the question was raised in my mind
over whether it would be legitimate to believe a Nazi would have
written a story with anti-totalitarian overtones, as I had first
though M was.</P>
<P>  Maybe then the answer to my question ultimately has to do with the
different roles of the director and the screenwriter. Von Harbou may
well not have intended her original screenplay to reflect negatively
on the tactics of Nazism; thus, she portrayed the repressive methods
of the police as ultimately effective. But in handing in the
screenplay, she turned over control of the final direction of the
movie to the director; M as we have it now thus reflects Lang's, not
von Harbou's, ultimate vision. And by Lang's claustrophobic directing
and heavy use of shadows, he may have in fact intended to undercut the
message of the screenplay and make Berlin of the 1930's in fact to
seem ominously sinister and oppressive. For this reason, my initial
impression of the movie may have been correct: no matter what minor
points may cast the impression otherwise, Lang had succeeded--via the
overall tone and message of the movie--to make M a warning against the
totalitarianism into which Germany was threatening to descend.</P>
