<PRE>"The Way of the Gun" – Trigger Happy, Cocksure Smart
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>In many ways, "TWOTG" does for tough-guy movies what
LA Confidential did for police stories.  There's
savviness in its writing and a mature patience in
allowing the material to unfold.  But, I suppose, we
wouldn't expect less from Christopher McQuarrie, who
was responsible for giving us "The Usual Suspects". 
His writing talents are still in tact as he brings to
us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but
dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry.</P>
<P>The two goons are Parker and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillipe
and Benicio del Toro).  These two men show the
hardened wear of those who have always had it tough. 
Their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls
who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive. 
Given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime,
they'll always choose the latter.  Yet, they are
incredibly foolish planners.  Actually, these two
never really have a plan.  They just improvise along
the way, hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns
will take care of anything that they might have
overlooked.</P>
<P>Their next scheme, which they cook up about as fast as
a McDonald's burger, is to kidnap some surrogate
mother named Robin (Juliette Lewis) that was hired by
some well-to-do family.  If all goes well, they'll
receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on. 
What Parker and Longbaugh do not realize is that Robin
is carrying a baby for the Chidduck family, whose
patriarch is a feared crime boss.  Moreover, two
bodyguards (Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs) constantly
escort her.  These two protectors find an eerie sense
of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life
and death situations.  They would rather die than
fail; thus their bravado level is equally high.  But
it seems that the testosterone levels of Parker and
Longbaugh are a bit higher, and they employ some
unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the
kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of
slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways.</P>
<P>The next hour or so, we watch the Chidduck camp
regroup and assess their situation.  During this time,
additional plot lines come into play and more and more
details are revealed.   Because the Chidduck's can not
go to the police and because of the special
circumstances involving the kidnapping, we are
introduced to more characters that will help to
influence the outcome.  We discover that not everyone
in the Chidduck camp is loyal to the cause.  As a
result, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy, and
elements of betrayal and subterfuge.  The sepia-toned
atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to
a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings,
shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of
life and death situations that are about to occur.</P>
<P>The momentum and the coolness of the film, however,
begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes, which
featured an overly extended shootout where our two
desperados try to make their way off with the ransom
money.  You can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd
denouement.  In fact, you may admire this film more
than you like it.  Yet, for the most part, "The Way of
the Gun" stays on target.  It feels cool with its
elements of conspiracy and gunplay, and smart for its
invective dialogue and tough guy poetry.  </P>
