<PRE>                          MATILDA
               A film review by Steve Rhodes
                Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>        RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>             One of the great novelists of children's books is Roald Dahl.
        This Spring we got to see an animated movie of his JAMES AND THE GIANT
        PEACH and loved it.  We had a friend who leant us the book, and Jeffrey
        (age 7) and I spent many a wonderful night this summer reading it.
        With that in mind, we looked forward to a new movie, MATILDA, based on
        another of Dahl's books.</PRE>
<PRE>             MATILDA is a live action film with Danny DeVito as the producer,
        director, and one of the stars.  Between the two recent Dahl movies, it
        would be hard to pick my favorite.  Finally, I should point out that
        the best movie ever made from a Dahl book has to be 1971's WILLY WONKA
        AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  I think I have seen that movie at least a
        half dozen times.  I've got to write a review of it someday.</PRE>
<PRE>             In MATILDA, Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is born to the worst
        parents imaginable.  On the way out of the hospital, father and
        fraudulent used car salesman Harry (Danny DeVito) says of the hospital
        bill, "five thousand dollars!  I'm not going to pay it.  What are they
        going to do?  Repossess the child?"</PRE>
<PRE>             Since her father and her mother Zinnia (Rhea Perlman) leave her at
        home all day from age four on, she becomes independent and an
        exceptional reader.  Having only newspapers and magazines to read, she
        dares one night to interrupt the family's nightly rendezvous with their
        beloved television to ask a favor.  She asks her father for a book, and
        astonished, he demands, "A book.  Why do you want a book?"  She meekly
        answers, "to read," He sets her straight with, "there's nothing you can
        get from a book that you can't get from a television faster."</PRE>
<PRE>             Although the book interchange is extremely funny, I reflected on
        the fact that libraries are reducing their hours at the same time that
        the average family spends something like three to four hours a day
        watching television so people's actions are closer to Harry's than
        Matilda's.</PRE>
<PRE>             Her father is the boss.  When he gives her orders, he ridicules
        her with, "I'm smart; you're dumb.  I'm big; you're little.  And
        there's nothing you can do about it."  Soon she strikes back.  She puts
        super super glue on his hat so it will stick to his head and generally
        makes his life miserable.  Dahl is not your sweetness and light author.
        His characters have to learn to survive in a hostile world, and they do
        it with style, imagination, and cunning.</PRE>
<PRE>             Matilda gets sent to a school run by principal Agatha Trunchbull
        (Pam Ferris).  Trunchbull is a classic villain.  She looks, dresses,
        and walks like a Nazi commandant.  The principal and the parents are
        all done as near perfect parody.  The costumes by Jane Ruhm add
        immensely to their tacky and overbearing images.  The wide-angle
        camerawork by Cinematographer Stefan Czapsky is effective at
        accentuating the evil in Matilda's young life.</PRE>
<PRE>             Too often kid's shows go awry by not casting effective villains.
        Here Ferris is great as every kid's worst nightmare.  She gets some
        tough lines like, "Use the rod and beat the child, that is my motto."
        She tells the kids that, "My idea of a perfect school is one in which
        there are no children."  Her school's motto is, "If you are having fun,
        you are not learning."</PRE>
<PRE>             If Trunchbull gets angry at kids, she throws them out of the
        window.  In typical Dahl fashion, children so discharged manage to pick
        flowers for their wonderful and sensitive teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey
        (Embeth Davidtz).</PRE>
<PRE>             The star of show is the charming and marvelous child actress Mara
        Wilson.  You may have seen her strength and her screen presence before
        in 1993's MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET or 1992's MRS. DOUBTFIRE.  I hope she
        makes many more films.</PRE>
<PRE>             I liked all of the cast.  Beside the ones already mentioned, Paul
        Reubens, a. k. a., Pee Wee Herman, plays an FBI agent trying to bust
        Harry.  I do wish DeVito had not narrated the picture.  I found it too
        jarring having Harry out of character when he was the narrator.</PRE>
<PRE>             I loved the show from beginning to end.  I found myself clapping
        sometimes and then laughing out loud.  It has an infectiously happy
        ending.</PRE>
<PRE>             MATILDA runs a fast 1:33.  It is rated PG.  There are a few
        situations that might scare kids under 4 or 5, but the language is
        pretty mild, and there is no sex, nudity, or violence unless you count
        the cartoonish violence of kids being thrown out the window.  Jeffrey
        loves the show and gives it three thumbs up.  I recommend the movie to
        you and give it ***.  I almost gave it a little more.</PRE>
<PRE>        ______________________________________________________________________
        **** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
        ***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
        **   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
        *    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
        0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
