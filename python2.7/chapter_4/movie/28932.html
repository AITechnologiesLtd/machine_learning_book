<PRE>`Legally Blonde'  --  Blondes Do Have More Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Seldom are lighthearted comedies so smooth and
enjoyable to watch as `Legally Blonde,' a very
palatable comedy that is both cute and funny. 
Underneath its exterior of cutesy silliness, there is
inner beauty as well.  Don't let it's vapid look of
cluelessness fool you.  The film's heart and mind show
intelligence, warmth and a great deal of appeal.</P>
<P>So too does it's lead character, Elle Woods (Reese
Witherspoon), whose effervescent personality and sunny
disposition make her thoroughly likeable.  Alas,
because of her radiant blonde hair and her love for
all things pink, she is mistakenly assumed to be a
ditzy airhead.  Okay, she may be the spitting image of
a Barbie doll, a TOTALLY popular member of her
sorority (whose membership seems to require that you
are blonde, fit, and wear belly-button exposing
outfits), and considers fashion mag Cosmopolitan to be
her bible.  However, she has a 4.0 grade point
average, is brilliant when it comes to merchandising,
and is an aspiring fashion designer.</P>
<P>But that's not enough for her long-time beau and
selfish cad, Warner (Matthew Davis), who has just been
accepted to the prestigious Harvard School of Law.  `I
need someone serious,' he coldly says and then breaks
up with her.  From this moment on, she sets out on a
mission to prove that she is good enough for him, and
more importantly, that she can rise above the
fluffiness of her own lifestyle.  </P>
<P>She sacrifices the party life in favor of LSAT study
sessions and submits a hilarious video essay on why
she would make a great lawyer.  Witherspoon is
adorable and possesses a girl-next-door demeanor that
gives her an endearing charm.  We care about you!  We
feel for you!  You go girl!</P>
<P>Up to this point, smiles are a sure thing.  But it
gets even funnier once our determined freshman arrives
at Harvard.  The poor thing is just not prepared for
the rigors of academia.  Hollywood and Harvard just
don't mix and she quickly becomes the subject of
ridicule by both teachers and students alike.  While
everyone else brings laptops to class, she brings a
heart-shaped notebook with pink, feathery frills.  She
is immediately challenged by a catty coed (Selma
Blair) and has a difficult time gaining acceptance
among her other classmates.</P>
<P>But don't underestimate Elle, who has a mind as sharp
as a hairdresser's safety pin and a heart as big as
Texas.  She studies rigorously, and soon she's going
nose-to-nose with the snobbish elite over Socratic
principles of law.  She even garners a highly coveted
internship at a top firm where she assists in
defending a client in a celebrity murder case. 
Incredibly, the defendant is a former sorority sister,
and Elle's background allows her to have the
psychological insight that eludes the other lawyers.</P>
<P>Yet while she discovers new frontiers of determination
and develops a new sense of focus, she never forgets
about the virtues of friendship and helping others. 
This is brought forth in a cute side story involving
an aging manicurist who is still waiting to meet Mr.
Right.  Elle imparts a hilarious lesson on how to
attract guys by using a bend and snap motion.  She
possesses brains, beauty and a bubbly sense of humor. 
And `Legally Blonde' does too.</P>
