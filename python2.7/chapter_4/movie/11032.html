A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Barry Levinson</PRE>
<P>Written by: Kurt Wimmer, Stephan Hauser, Paul Attanasio (adapted from
the Michael Crichton novel) </P>
<P>Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Coyote,
Liev Schreiber</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Underwater habitat (research station), giant spacecraft, scientific
exploration team </PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
Psychologist Norman (Dustin Hoffman), biologist Beth (Sharon Stone),
mathematics whiz Harry (Samuel L. Jackson), astrophysicist Ted (Liev
Schreiber), and navy guy Barnes (Peter Coyote) are commissioned to stay
in an underwater research lab and explore a newly discovered giant space
shuttle that appears to have been sitting under the ocean for the last
300 years. Inside the craft the teams finds a gigantic mysterious golden
'sphere.' </P>
<P>Without warning, communications with the surface get cut off, while a
mysterious entity takes over the computer and prints cryptic messages
onto the screen. Then the nightmares of the team's members
systematically get turned into physical reality. For instance, phobias
about giant killer squids, sea snakes, and jellyfish come true. (Queen
Latifah plays a navy crewman aboard the research lab, who is the first
to feel the wrath of the killer jellyfish.) Will Norman and the team
figure out who is killing whom before they all die underwater, or will
they sit around and passively wait for events to happen?</P>
<P>Opinion:
There are good actors and actresses in this film, as well as some
special effects, but the story itself is disappointing. The main problem
with this movie is passive characters. </P>
<P>The characters aren't given any motivations or agendas. In a regular
movie, any character has a goal, the movie tosses in a dilemma, and the
character must overcome the dilemma during the course of the movie. But
in this movie, the team doesn't really 'do' anything. The characters
just lay around and passively wait for events to happen; they never even
take the offensive and counterattack. We the audience don't really care
what happens to the team because we don't know what their goals are, and
in what way the 'sphere' opposes them. At least two the main characters
visit inside the sphere and refuse to reveal any information about what
they saw. But throughout the film, and even at the end of the movie,
they never reveal why they acted that way, or what they had seen inside
the sphere, and why it was such a big secret. For the audience, all of
this adds up to an intuitive feeling of a contrived situation. </P>
<P>At unexpected times the music gets overly big and intense, and various
team members tell a lie or act insane - - but again, for no explainable
reason. We don't find out - - not even in the end - - who sent the
sphere, why it was sent, what exactly it is, and what its capabilities
are. Nor do we learn anything new about the team's members, even the
ones who acted strangely.</P>
