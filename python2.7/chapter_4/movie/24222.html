<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>FREQUENCY [Hoblit] -- Too contrived, with every key event so obviously
foreshadowed, to be either lucid, or enjoyed in the silliest context.
Actually, no, that's not right: in fact, the film's final suspense
sequence is to be enjoyed only in the silliest context. That said, the
whole project works best a thriller guided by baseball in the vein
of Summer Of Sam (which I haven't seen, actually), and the modern day
sequences pale in comparison to the older, despite Dennis Quaid's
stilted New York accent; most of it doesn't work (why does Hoblit have
to give a reason --the Northern Lights -- for their being able to
communicate?), but when it does it's a nailbiter (the aforementioned
final sequence in particular, with an odd, disjointed sense of fear and
unpredictably, albeit cut off by a laughable turnabout). Ironically,
though, it could've been a masterpiece if it hadn't a hint of the murder
mystery, and an actor other than Jim Caviezel in the lead role (though,
even he began to grow on me in the final reel). C+</P>
