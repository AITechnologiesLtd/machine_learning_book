<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For the Algerian-born French director Tony Gatlif, "Gadjo Dilo" is the
third in his gypsy trilogy. In 1994, Gatlif wrote and directed "Latcho
Drom," a musical documentary of gypsies performing in different
countries. "Mondo" told the story of an abandoned gypsy boy in France.</P>
<P>Gypsies have a reputation of being known as thieves and have suffered a
vast amount of prejudice because of their nomadic lifestyle and failure
to conform to the society where they live. Here, the director, himself a
Rom member, is in love with the gypsies -- their foibles and all -- and
plays a joke with their worldwide pejorative image by reversing the
things usually said about gypsies, and having the gypsies say them about
the foreigners.</P>
<P>The film has caught the gypsy mood and their persona: the gypsies here
have gold teeth, the women bathe together in the nude and talk about the
men in a frank sexual manner, the men drink a lot, play music with deep
feelings, curse on a regular basis, and are quick to smile and see the
humor in almost everything they do. This film lays the gypsy spirit on
thickly, as its infectuous story unfolds in a gypsy village somewhere in
rural Romania.</P>
<P>"Gadjo Dilo" opens with a young educated Parisian, Stephane (Romain
Duris), walking in torn boots, down an isolated desolate road covered
with snow and ice. He reaches a local village hotel at night, but he is
told it is too late for them to admit him. He's soon joined by an old
drunk man shouting by the town square: "May I die! May I rot!" and
lamenting the injustice of his son Adriani having just been sent to
prison, claiming that there is no justice for the gypsies. The old man
says his name is Izidor (Isidor Serban ) and that his finding Stephane
here is a sign of good luck. He makes the young man get drunk with him
as a sign of respect and starts to treat him as a surrogate son.</P>
<P>The next morning, in the gypsy village, some children discover Stephane
in Izidor's bed. They shout in excitement, "There's a great big gadjo
sleeping at our place!" "Gadjo Dilo," in the Gypsies' Romany language,
means "crazy stranger," which becomes a reference to the French youth
and the film's title.</P>
<P>It turns out that Stephane is an ethnomusicologist like his father,
interested in recording the gypsy music and is on a pilgrimage through
the rural Romanian countryside in search of the pure gypsy sound, in
particular, he seeks a singer - Nora Luca - whose voice is on an
audiotape of his late father and was his favorite singer. He comes
prepared for his research, with a tape-recording system and many
cassettes of the type of gypsy music he is looking for.</P>
<P>Stephane gets trapped in the village, as the old man refuses to let his
good luck Frenchman leave, despite the other gypsies calling for the
foreigner to get out -- that he is here only to steal their chickens.
There is a language problem and the only one in the village who speaks
French, an attractive but spirited young girl named Sabina (Rona
Hartner), who left a husband in Belgium, refuses to translate. Stephane
has a problem getting the old man to understand that he wants to meet
Nora Luca and that she is the main purpose for his travels. Instead, the
old man takes him into his house, gets the gypsy women to repair his
shoes like new, teaches him to speak like a gypsy, and tells him the
best gypsy music in the world is in this village.</P>
<P>When Stephane tries to clean up Izidor's place, in appreciation for his
hospitality, he is told by him: "Aren't you ashamed of yourself for
cleaning my house?" Some women, observing Stephane's dusting and
sweeping, mock him, laughingly saying that he's a faggot.</P>
<P>Sabina is considered by the villagers to be a slut because of what
happened in Belgium. When Stephane shows that he is attracted to her,
she shows disgust; she bites his hand when he tries to help her carry
wood back for the fire and she then raises her skirt mooning him. But,
despite that initial coldness, Stephane is soon making love to her in
the woods and running around naked with her.</P>
<P>As he's about to go back to Paris, the local townspeople react to
Adriani's release from prison and revenge killing of the town official
who had him arrested, by burning down the gypsy village and killing
Adriani and Izador. The question now becomes how and if Stephane and
Sabina will remain together and where, as he buries his gypsy recordings
knowing that he has not found a utopia. Whether he can return to French
society or feels liberated after living for months with the gypsies and
assimilating with them, becomes his dilemma. For the director, the
question becomes, how is it, whenever events turn bad, the gypsy
community is almost always made the scapegoat.</P>
<P>Gatlif succeeded in setting an evocative gypsy mood, touching on their
charms, highlighting their moving music, demonstrating the sheer joy in
their wedding ceremonies, and leaving a good taste in one's mouth about
the gypsy spirit to survive. Though the film doesn't tell a great story
but a conventional one, even with all the exotic atmosphere the film
exudes in, but it still holds one's interest throughout, as the moods
change and gypsy life takes a more dramatic turn.</P>
