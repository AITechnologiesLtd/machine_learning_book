<P>Bryan Singer made a big splash in 1995 with his surprising, 
critically-acclaimed, "The Usual Suspects," and after 
three years of hiatus, he is back with his sophomore effort, "Apt 
Pupil," based on a Stephen King novella, but I think his look has 
quickly run out.</P>
<P>The film is about an intelligent, but cold-hearted 16-year-old senior, 
Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) who becomes interested in the Holocaust after 
he studies it in school, and discovers that a Nazi from the 
concentration camps in WWII is living in his own hometown under an alias 
name. That man is Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), whom Todd blackmails, 
telling him that he will turn him into the police if he does not do as 
he says. As Kurt begins to tell him horrific stories of killing the Jews 
and his experiences in the camps, Todd begins to become obsessed with 
it, starts to slack off in school, in which he was previously at the top 
of his class, and begins to look more and more likely of being capable 
of murder himself.</P>
<P>"Apt Pupil," has an intriguing story, and there are a few suspenseful 
moments that pop up every once in a while, but it is at the screenplay 
level that the film fails. There is no attempt at all to develop any of 
the supporting characters, and so they all come off as being underused 
and one-dimensional. Even Todd's parents, played by Bruce Davison and 
Ann Dowd, only appear in one scene in the first half, and the film would 
have you believe that Todd is practically living at Kurt's house. Todd's 
friend (Joshua Jackson) is also a wasted character, as is his potential 
girlfriend (Heather McComb). And so, because of this, what we have is 
basically a two-character film, which would be okay if there hadn't been 
so many open-ended subplots.</P>
<P>Renfro and McKellen are nothing short of spectacular in the film. Renfro 
especially could not have been any better, and he is thoroughly 
believable throughout, although his character is completely unlikable. 
They both work well together, and the dialogue between them is often 
well-written.</P>
<P>One subplot that I did kind of like, even though it also was not 
developed very well, concerns Todd's guidance counselor at school (David 
Shwimmer), that at first does not seem to be of much importance to the 
story until the climactic moments. Schwimmer usually plays the same 
character ("Friends," "The Pallbearer"), but here he is completely 
different, and shows that he is capable of actually having a lot of 
range as an actor.</P>
<P>But with all things considered, "Apt Pupil" just isn't a very well 
thought-out picture. The screenplay obviously should have went through a 
few more drafts, and it also should have decided what type of genre it 
wanted to fall into. Did it want to be a psychological drama, or a 
horror movie (as some scenes would have you believe, including a 
senseless murder in the last act)? Singer proved he was a talented 
director with "The Usual Suspects," but "Apt Pupil" is a highly inferior 
film in almost every way. </P>
