<P>     A word of sympathy, first of all, for the marketing and publicity
people at Miramax Films. I guarantee you I would not want the job of
selling to the American public a film in which the character arc of the
protagonist is completed by performing an abortion. They'll avoid the
subject assiduously, of course, focusing instead on the idea that THE
CIDER HOUSE RULES is about a journey to self-awareness, about learning to
make complex choices, and so on, and et cetera, and yada yada, all of
which is even (more or less) true. It's also true that John Irving has no
qualms about being provocative, and that he's willing to cast performing
abortions in a quasi-heroic light if it serves the purpose of one of his
uniquely compassionate tales. </P>
<P>     THE CIDER HOUSE RULES isn't worth avoiding simply because of that one
thematic element ... nor, unfortunately, it is particularly worth seeking 
out. Once again delving into protagonists with atypical parental
circumstances, Irving (adapting his own novel) tells the story of an
orphan named Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire). Homer has lived his entire life
at St. Cloud's Orphanage in Maine, and now, as a young adult in 1943,
finds himself apprenticed to the orphanage's unconventional obstetrician
and caretaker Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Unsure of his own place in
the world, however, Homer decides to explore it. He leaves with Candy
Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) -- a young
couple who have come to St. Cloud's for Dr. Larch's illegal services --
eventually landing as a picker at Wally's family apple orchard. It is
there that Homer has experiences that broaden his horizons, from
encounters with romance to encounters with the grey areas of morality.</P>
<P>     The first half of THE CIDER HOUSE RULES walks an awkward tightrope
between edgy humanism and dangerous sentimentality. The relationship
between Larch and Homer is the focal point, a strange father-son
connection that gives two actors intriguing material to work with. Caine
is particularly good as Larch, playing devilish advocate regarding the
harsh realities of the world. That relationship, however, is played out in
a setting filled with adorable urchins, including one inquisitive but
doomed fellow who spends his days under an oxygen tent. Irving tries to
wink at the mawkishness (plenty of Dickensian references abound), but 
director Lasse Hallstrom spends a bit too much time lingering on the
orphans' upturned faces. For a story that's ultimately not about orphans,
the opening of THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is too much about orphans.</P>
<P>     What the story is about, ultimately, is Homer's progress towards
understanding life outside the orphanage. To that end, Tobey Maguire
proves to be a marvelous Homer Wells. His performance is a challenging mix
of innocence and experience; his face captures both a hard life and a life
lived in isolation. He's certainly the best choice for an Irving
protagonist since Robin Williams' Garp, but THE CIDER HOUSE RULES still
can't quite achieve Irving-style magic, even with Irving himself doing the
script honors. The narrative meanders appropriately between Homer's
relationship with Candy, his work with the apple-picking crew and life
back at the orphanage, yet the meandering just doesn't have that whimsical
sense of purpose that marks Irving's novels. </P>
<P>     It is most worth noting that THE CIDER HOUSE RULES on film packs 15
years of Homer's life into about a year and a half. There may be no better
evidence that Irving is a writer whose stories really need to be turned
into mini-series. The film does do a nice job conveying the theme that
"situational morality" need not be an epithet; indeed, this is may be one
of the most deeply radical concepts you'll see on film this year. It is
there you see a glimmer of the literary Irving, one of the glimmers you
can see in Maguire and Caine. Too often, though, those glimmers are
obscured by conventional filmmaking. Maybe those marketing folk don't have
such a tough job after all. In THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, you have to work a
little too hard to find Irving the provocateur.</P>
