<PRE>AMERICAN PIE 2
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The gang from American Pie is back in American Pie 2, or, I Still Know
What You Screwed Last Summer.  The immortal pie, of course, is gone, but
there are plenty of foreign objects and luscious ladies to occupy the
genitalia of the entire cast for a full hour and a half.</P>
<P>After reinventing the sex comedy in 1999's American Pie, AP2 had a high
bar to live up to, and miraculously, it has done so.  It actually
outdoes the original (by a mile) when it comes to juvenile and crude
humor.  And the sex gags... jeez, the dick jokes come rapid fire, one
every minute.  It ain't Woody Allen, but damn if it isn't utterly
hysterical.</P>
<P>Where Freddy Got Fingered failed, American Pie 2 succeeds admirably. 
It's silly and largely immature, but it's also original, clever, cheeky,
and has enough borderline sophistication to maintain plenty of appeal
for the adults in the audience.  (And parents, if I haven't made this
clear, this is a very adult movie, wholly unsuitable for any child you
don't want to end up as the town slut, male or female.)</P>
<P>Never mind the plot, which is an awkward construct of a bunch of
returning characters in search of a story.  And apparently they didn't
find one, so they just remade American Pie, only set one year later. 
This time out, the characters are coming home from their first year at
college, facing the same disillusionment they bore in high school.  To
find the meaning in all of it, the stars decide to rent a lakefront
beach house so opulent it might as well be the set for The Real World:
Michigan.</P>
<P>Aside from minor details, the rest of the plot is largely the same.  AP2
starts with another party at Stifler's, and it ends at another big
blowout bash.  Couples are formed and couples are broken.  Stifler's mom
makes the requisite appearance.  Jim's dad causes havoc.</P>
<P>Thanks to his tension-busting charisma, Seann William Scott's Stifler
has a greatly increased presence in the sequel, but all the girls except
for Alyson Hannigan's flute-toter have been practically cut out of the
film.  Tara Reid and Mena Suvari have arguably become the biggest
breakout stars from the original; they were obviously the busiest during
shooting and had to be disposed of conveniently for the sequel (Suvari's
character is shipped overseas for the summer in an awkward,
sitcom-feeling device).  No worry -- Reid and Suvari aren't funny
anyway.</P>
<P>The only thing that really interferes with the enjoyment of the movie is
that all of its stars have made so many bad knock-offs of American Pie
in the last two years that they've lost any sense of identity with the
characters that made them so original and endearing.  Chris Klein has
become a jokey caricature of himself -- from Say It Isn't So to Here on
Earth to Election (a great film, but basically the same character
again).  Ditto Jason Biggs, who played a wishy-washy loser in Loser and
Saving Silverman.  And Seann William Scott has turned into a generic
bozo in Evolution and Dude, Where's My Car?  Oddly, though, the biggest
stretch, which surprised me, is seeing Mena Suvari again playing an
innocent girl next door.  After films like American Beauty, she's broken
her own mold pretty permanently.</P>
<P>Of course, there's no hope searching for any kind of meaning in American
Pie 2.  Relying on the older brother of Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) to
once again show the kids the way, our heroes are just interested in
movin' on with their lives, because now that they're 19 years old, you
know, shouldn't there be some meaning in all of it?  And in full Pie
style, the answer is found... by throwing a beach party.</P>
<PRE>Damn, I wish I was a kid again.</PRE>
