<P>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
Anyone who saw last year's transcendent, action-packed "Run Lola Run" 
knows that German filmmaker Tom Tykwer is one of film's most exciting 
young auteurs. So it's a shame to note that excitement is what "Winter 
Sleepers", a film he made prior to "Lola" in 1997, is lacking most.</P>
<P>The film takes place in a German skiing village in the dead of winter. A 
pre-credit sequence introduces us to Rebecca (Floriane Daniel), a 
translator of romance novels, Marco (Heino Ferch), her ski-instructor 
boyfriend, Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem), a lonely nurse and fledgling 
actress, Rene (Ulrich Matthes), a lonely movie projectionist, and Theo 
(Josef Bierbichler), a farmer and loyal family man.</P>
<P>Being a Tom Tykwer film, "Winter Sleepers" is also an exploration of 
fate. One winter day, Rene steals a car belonging to Marco, and heads 
out on a slippery highway road. Theo is also driving down the road, with 
a horse in a trailer hitched onto his car. He is unaware that his young 
daughter is also in the trailer. When Theo swerves in order to not to 
crash into the projectionist in the stolen vehicle, his car and trailer 
flip over, leaving his daughter in critical condition. Theo is knocked 
unconscious, and Rene leaves the scene of the accident.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Rebecca and Marco are contemplating the seriousness of their 
relationship. Rebecca is interested in little more than sex, and Marco 
is having an affair with another woman. Nevertheless, they move in 
together.</P>
<P>Laura and Theo, both lonely and single, also begin a relationship. He 
goes to see her in an awful community production of "A Streetcar Named 
Desire", and gives her free tickets to visit the local cinema. Like most 
of the film's characters, Theo begins as a less-than-admirable 
character, but we learn to understand his pressures, and when the film 
ends, he is a different person.</P>
<P>For the most part, "Winter Sleepers" is the polar opposite of "Run Lola 
Run". While its often unfair to compare two different films, it must be 
taken into consideration that "Lola" is 80 minutes long and fast-paced, 
while "Winter" runs a whopping 124 minutes at a slow pace. The film 
plays like an amateur "Sweet Hereafter", without the poetic grace or 
fine acting.</P>
<P>"Winter Sleepers" does not come without its merits. The mountain 
cinematography, by Frank Griebe, is both breathtaking and unpretentious, 
and the techno score (co-written by Tykwer) often gives the proceedings 
a temporary jolt of energy that is missing from the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Though you wouldn't know it from watching "Winter Sleepers", Tom Tykwer 
is responsible for what might be a new wave of German filmmaking. The 
newest German films, such as "Lola" and Katja Von Garnier's "Bandits", 
are kinetic, highly stylized and more than a bit of fun. Compared to 
those films, "Winter Sleepers" seems to be in hibernation.</P>
