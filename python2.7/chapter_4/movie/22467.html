<P>     There are times when I'm watching a film and I just know it has
fallen victim the demon Expectations. Audiences expect certain things from
certain kind of films -- they expect love stories to end with a kiss, they
expect horror films to end with a jolt, they expect action films to end
with a big chase and/or a big explosion. The ebb and flow of traditional
narrative becomes part of the way people watch movies, and film-makers
know this. The familiarity is comforting; it makes it easy for people to
keep up. Scripts are structured not exactly to give the people what they
want, but to give them what they know -- which, for all practical
purposes, is the same thing.</P>
<P>     THE HURRICANE is a drama that follows a legal proceding, and it gives
the audience what they expect by ending with a verdict. It's also a
disappointing resolution for a story that's actually about so much more
than guilt or innocence. The subject is real-life boxer Rubin "Hurricane" 
Carter (Denzel Washington), a middleweight contender whose hard life takes
its hardest turn when he is convicted in a robbery/murder case and
sentenced to life in prison. Carter never stops insisting on his
innocence, however, and eventually turns his story into an autobiography
called _The Sixteenth Round_. That book finds its way into the hands of
Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon), an African-American teen learning at last
to read with the help of three Canadian social activist/guardians: Lisa
(Deborah Kara Unger), Terry (John Hannah) and Sam (Liev Schreiber). When
Lesra becomes convinced Carter has been wrongly accused, he enlists the
aid of "The Canadians" to free "The Hurricane" after nearly 20 years in
prison.</P>
<P>     The heart and soul of THE HURRICANE comes from the relationship
between Carter and Lesra, a relationship that begins as a pen pal
correspondence and climaxes with an emotional prison visit between the
two. Once THE HURRICANE finds that hook, it truly begins to soar. The
biographical background material, which had felt somewhat labored, starts
to flesh out a portrait of Carter's background of distrust of any force
outside himself. Denzel Washington, after a number of roles in which his
commanding presence was lost on mediocre material, turns Carter into a
character with a fascinating arc. After growing inward for years as a
defense mechanism, Carter finds himself in the dangerous position of
growing to care once again about life in the outside world. Watching him
overcome his initial suspicion of the Canadians' motives is intriguing;
watching him begin to collapse under the burden of hope is engrossing.</P>
<P>     That dynamic -- the tense relationships between Carter and those who
sought to help him, and how he responds to their efforts -- is what THE
HURRICANE is really about. Unfortunately, the script begins taking the
story into predictable, uninspired directions. The Canadians encounter
road blocks from reluctant would-be witnesses; they're harrassed by the
racist police detective (Dan Hedaya) who originally engineered the
frame-up. The investigation consistently suffers from a sense of
manufactured drama, as well as from the complete absence of character
development for the three Canadians (they've been compressed from nine
real-life individuals, so we can be thankful for small favors). It's
obvious we're heading for a showdown before the bench, and a series of
impassioned speeches about justice. And frankly, I didn't really care,
because I knew every minute spent on the details of the case was a minute
not spent exploring Carter as a character.</P>
<P>     There is far too much to like about Washington's performance -- and,
to give credit where it's due, about newcomer Shannon's performance as
well -- for THE HURRICANE not to be ultimately satisfying. The agonizing
sequence that finds Carter slowly losing his mind in solitary confinement
is a particular triumph; no other film has ever made the loneliness of
one's own thoughts seem like such a punishment. THE HURRICANE simply loses
focus on its strengths at times, wandering into familiar territory for its
emotional catharsis. In a sense, Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon deserve
kudos for finding a compelling perspective in fusing their two source
materials. It's hard not to wish that the film hadn't been more willing
to let the audience find that perspective as well.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hurricane forces:  7.</PRE>
