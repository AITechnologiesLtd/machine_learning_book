<PRE>                      SWEETY BARRETT (Ireland)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: In a remote Irish fishing village the village simpleton
comes into conflict with a corrupt and tyrannical policeman.  Nicely
filmed and well acted but the story is overly familiar and invites
comparison to SLING BLADE.  Rating:  7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Stephen Bradley
   - Mentally retarded circus performer is let go by the circus and
     must fend for himself.  He comes to live in a fishing village and
     makes friends with a young boy.  He is on a collision course with
     a corrupt policeman who rather than fighting the local crime
     actually directs it.
   - There is a lot of nice local feel to the film.
   - The story is a bit stereotypical and predictable.  Director is a
     first timer, however.
   - Good menacing performance by Liam Cunningham.
   - Rather appealing young Irish child.  Most of the characters are
     appealing, though showing a little more of life in the village
     might be a good idea.
   - It's a little hard to judge Barrett's intelligence level at times.
     He seems almost simple by choice.
   - Cruel jokes are played on Barrett by people of village.  He just
     tolerates them.
   - Seems like a big buildup to not very much of a climax.</P>
