<P>PLOT:
An American submarine is set out to sea after instability in Russia leads to
the possible threat of a nuclear attack. Nuclear devices aboard, the crew is
suddenly poised to launch the missiles after an emergency message advises of
an imminent Russian strike. Unfortunately, the last message received is cut
off halfway, so the crew is suddenly unsure of their mission. The Captain of
the ship believes that they should launch the missiles, while the XO thinks
they should wait for confirmation. Tensions rise and mutiny abounds.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Thrilling, entertaining, claustrophobic, interesting, tense, are only a few
of the words that I can use to describe this successful submarine thriller
solidly anchored by the superior performances from two of today's top actors
in the prime of their form, Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. Despite an
overload of technical terms, this film still managed to capture my attention
and interest with a plausible situation, credible actors (Mortensen rocks!),
an environment about which I knew very little and spitlets of comic relief.
The buildup of the film was also managed quite dramatically with a
burgeoning tension as it moved along at a rapid pace. Who would have thought
that a film set almost entirely in a submarine could capture my attention to
the point that it did? Credit goes to director Tony Scott for this
accomplishment and the effectiveness of the story.  This film is not about
action either, it's basically about being in a situation where two people
may be right, but a decision has to be made, and the fate of a billion
people may lie in its wake. Pretty tense, no?</P>
<P>All in all, this film is an excellent nacho-plate movie, waiting to be
enjoyed by groups of people who enjoy high-energy, macho thrillers brimming
in mood, excellent actors and a unique environment.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Gene Hackman's role was originally offered to Al Pacino.
Blink or you'll miss 'em roles: Pay close to attention to this film and you
will see actor Ryan Phillippe in his first motion picture role as Seaman
Grattam, Steve Zahn in one of his first roles as William Barnes and Rick
Schroder (?), that's right l'il Ricky Schroder, in one of his few screen
roles, as Lt. Paul Hellerman. Schroder's character has to follow one of the
grimmest orders in the entire film. Pay close attention. There is also an
uncredited cameo by Jason Robards at the end of this film.
Quentin Tarantino was an uncredited "polish" writer for this film, managing
to include such pop-fare as the whole "Silver Surfer" debate, and surely the
"Star Trek" references as well. Another Tarantino-ism can be found in the
character name "Russell Vossler" which is a reference to Rand Vossler, a
friend of Quentin's from his days working at the Video Archives video store.
Vossler was also used in PULP FICTION. It was one of the names on the
marquee of Bruce Willis' boxing match. Director Tony Scott once directed an
entire film out of Quentin's own script called TRUE ROMANCE (10/10). One of
my favorite films of all-time.
Other well-known screenwriters were also used to punch up the script
including Robert Towne and Steve Zaillian who also contributed key scenes,
including the "Von Clausewicz" scene having to do with the essential nature
of war, which Towne apparently added.
The name of the submarine in this film is the "Alabama". The University of
Alabama's football team is called "The Crimson Tide", and their coach's
nickname is "Bear", which is the name of the Alabama's captain's dog in this
film. Coincidence or major conspiracy?? :)
Among the many factual errors in this film, the Lippizane horses do have
some Spanish descent, but are essentially bred at the Austrian Imperial Stud
at Lippiza.</P>
