<P>     In Stephen Frears' THE VAN, unemployed Dubliners Bimbo Reeves (Donal
O'Kelly) and his pal Larry (Colm Meany) refurbish a run-down
fish-and-chips van and take it on the road, moving from place to place in
search of a productive place to do a little business for a short time.
Appropriately enough, that's the way THE VAN wanders along as a narrative.
The previous installments in author Roddy Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy --
Alan Parker's 1991 THE COMMITMENTS and Frears' own 1994 adaptation of THE
SNAPPER -- each provided an anchoring element for Doyle's humorous
episodes and colorful characters.  Instead of THE COMMITMENTS' energetic
musical numbers or THE SNAPPER's sweet father-daughter relationship, THE
VAN offers under-developed nods to the embarrassment of unemployment and
nationalist pride in the Irish World Cup team.  After about forty-five
minutes, Doyle and Frears settle into a routine of self-contained
anecdotes suitable for Reader's Digest's "All in a Day's Work."  One or
two at a time, it's amusing to take in such "Honey, you won't believe the
day I had" tales.  Over the course of an hour and a half, the anecdotes
grow a bit wearying.</P>
<P>     THE VAN is certainly the least effective of the three cinematic
Barrytown tales, yet it is still manages to provide some high-spirited
entertainment.  Most of the credit goes to Meany and O'Kelly, a pair of
appealing protagonists who lend a flustered enthusiasm to most of their
scenes.  The humor comes as much from reaction as it does from situation
in THE VAN, with Meany able to sell small moments like his very logical
reaction to a customer who comes up 10 pence short for his burger (Meany
takes a 10-pence bite before handing over the food).  When THE VAN does
pay off with a big laugh, it makes you realize that it might have been
great fun to watch these same characters in a more consistent story.
Instead, we have a cinematic snack truck, offering a few tasty bites
rather than a truly satisfying meal.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cooks au van:  5.</PRE>
