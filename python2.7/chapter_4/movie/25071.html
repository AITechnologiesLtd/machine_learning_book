<PRE>                           ME, MYSELF & IRENE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     After just missing Oscar gold with performances in The Truman Show
and Man in the Moon, Jim Carrey returns to the dramatic form for a third
bid at the little statue with a heart-rending performance as a victim of
split-personality disorder in the soulful drama Me, Myself & Irene.</P>
<P>     Yeah, and Adam Sandler is a gifted thespian.  With their
long-awaited follow-up to There's Something About Mary, the Farrelly
brothers return to their specialty -- gross-out shenanigans -- in this
equally funny entry into their oeuvre of perversion.</P>
<P>     The story involves the naïve and lovable Charlie (Carrey), a Rhode
Island state trooper who finds himself the whipping boy of the entire
state due to his welcome-mat demeanor.  Even children tell him to stick
it to himself.  And have I mentioned his new bride births triplets with
a black midget, running off with the father to leave Charlie to care for
the boys as his own?  No doubt about it, you're in Farrelly
brothers-land now...</P>
<P>     The story gets jump-started when Irene (Renée Zellweger) enters the
picture, and through a series of mishaps Irene and Charlie find
themselves on the run from a crooked golf course owner(!?) throughout
the northeast U.S.  And there's one other problem: Charlie has mentally
snapped, taking on a second personality of "Hank," Charlie's utter
opposite -- lover, fighter, and smooth-talker.</P>
<P>     Irene relies on two things to make itself the off-the-charts comedy
it truly is:  potty humor and the ability of Carrey to do pantomime
(mainly via beating himself up a la Fight Club).  And did I mention the
potty humor?  We're not talking fart-joke-as-afterthought.  We're
talking chicken-up-a-man's-butt as critical plot point.  We're talking
clear-the-theaters gross-out stuff... stuff that the Farrelly brothers
do so well it's better than poetry.</P>
<P>     Zellweger plays the straight (wo)man admirably well in the shadow
of Carrey's insane slapsticker.  If only the plot had been better -- or
rather, if only there had been a plot at all -- the movie might have
become a classic.  As it is, the film makes almost no sense at all,
having something to do with the aforementioned golf course and an
unnamed scandal therein, somehow peripherally involving Irene.  Mary was
clever.  Irene is just plain dumb.</P>
<P>     But no matter.  Irene is so easy on the eyes and on the funny bone
it practically begs for a sequel.  (Discerning viewers: Watch for cameos
by sports stars Anna Kournakova and Cam Neely, and a eye-popper from
late-night cable queen Shannon Whirry.)</P>
