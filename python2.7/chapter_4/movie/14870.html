<PRE>          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>It's hard to dislike this film.  It's also hard to say that it is a
masterpiece.  But it is easy to say that the film has a nice touch,
something that is endearing, and lovely, and is not a pushy political film,
or religious whatnot.  Slow at the start, but very vibrant and moving, and
enjoyable later. Bernardo is the David Lean of our time.</P>
<P>One can not help thinking that unlike many other religions, this story of
the Tibetan Buddhism monks, and their lineage, is a very interesting one.
Unlike many religions, their sacred ground has been taken away.  And they
have been forced to co-exist against tremendous odds, and have managed to
withstand a lot.  They still thrive, and will forever prove that having it
in the heart is more important than having a country for a home.  But above
all, they will teach something that most do not see.  They have learnt to be
flexible, and to be a part of other lives, and styles.  How these things
will develop in time, is really what this film is about.</P>
<P>The story is simple.  A monk, in Seattle, happens to come across a child
that appears to have all the indications that he is one of the incarnations
of the leader, who is dying.  And the monks, are excited enough to have to
try and bring this child to their temporary home, to see how the child will
behave next to the other candidates, and how things will develop.</P>
<P>The start of the film is awkward, and a bit slow, if not bland, which may
have been intentional.  Seattle is a modern city, with its modern
inhabitants, and its modern everything.  But it is STILL.  Nothing moves.
There is no action.  All is un-exciting.  The lifestyle appears to be
illusory, and not real.  The colors are bland.  And the two parents ( Chris
Isaac and Bridget Fonda ) are approached by one local monk, and eventually
they are introduced to a Lama, the high representative of the group.  The
child shows every notion that he is indeed a great candidate.  He is alive
and curious about the story of Buddha which the monk is telling him through
a few books.  And the story comes alive for us.  A great example of how our
minds can be ever so much more lively than the reality  surrounding us.</P>
<P>The monks finally convince the couple to allow the child to come to Tibet,
for a period of time, for all the monks to see him interacting with everyone
else.  And maybe some incidental training along the way, depending on how
the parents allow it.</P>
<P>The couple is having a hard time, their life is beginning to fall apart, and
Dean is losing his job, and has to figure out how to salvage it all into
another job.  Perfect time to take a breather. He decides to go to Bhutan
with the child.  And the film changes completely.  All of a sudden there is
breath, life, space, and time.  Everything moves.  The monks breathe and we
can hear them. The children play and we can enjoy it.  The story of Buddha
finishes and the new story takes over.</P>
<P>The child is placed with a couple of other candidates for lamahood, a young
boy and a small girl.  Unlike Jesse, Raju has a bit of the Hindu upper class
crust in him, and the little girl is very much brought up by the same class.
They were prepared for all this and are expected to fulfill that role.
Jesse is more independent, but also less manipulated.  He enjoys his
freedom. The father, in the meantime is just watching life all around him.
He has become a non-character, it seems, in search of himself. He is still t
he father, and never too far away, but he seems to have gained a trust and
faith that he didn't show before.</P>
<P>Jesse is indeed the apparent incarnation that the monks have been looking
for.  And he is treated and revered as such.  The little boy hardly
understands any of this, but he has an aptitude to connect with some of the
monks that is rather nice to watch. The father and son leave for Seattle,
and on the story continues. A few subtleties, which are un-important to the
life of the film are shown, but even the mother does not realize it.  Jesse
says that he can hear his new brother.  The mother does not know yet if it
is a boy or girl that she is carrying.  End of story.</P>
<P>The prettiest thing in this film, hands down, is the acting ( well unfair to
call it that, but ... ) of Sogyal Rinpoche, a renown Lama and emissary of
the Tibetan Buddhist movement.  His character, no matter how similar to his
own duties, is a treat to watch,
undoubtedly a pleasant person regardless.  He is gentle, never forceful,
respectful, and very lively to watch with the children. And he has mastered
the character's inner strength to lead himself into the Bardo layers as he
is in the final moments of his stay
in the earth.  The suggestion is that Jesse will be the one carrying on his
knowledge.</P>
<P>Another magnificent thing in this movie is RYUICHI SAKAMOTO's score for the
film.  Outstanding music, beautifully designed and blending into the colors
of the film, in some quiet and subtle ways that just slowly crop up, and
start to make you feel it
all.  Truly beautiful music.  Few soundtracks are written with such care,
and design in mind. One gets the feeling that the scenery was built to
match.</P>
<P>And the last great thing in this film, is the cinematography of Vittorio
Storaro.  There is some magic about the way this man colors a Bertolucci
film, but perhaps it is the director that helps design it all.  It is truly
beautiful to watch.</P>
<P>Chris Isaac is good.  Keanu Reeves as Siddartha is also good, even if many
people have had a hard time seeing an American actor in this kind of a role.
And the monks are extraordinary.  One could only hope that the Catholic
counterparts showed this much poise, character, and beauty.</P>
<PRE>Tremendous movie.</PRE>
