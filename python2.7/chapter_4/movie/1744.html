<PRE>                              STRICTLY BALLROOM
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>RATING = 10 (scale of 0 -> 10, 10 = must see)
Australian, (general distribution in Australia August 1992.)
No nudity, little profanity, no violence.</P>
<P>     Why would anyone want to go to a film about the cut-throat,
competitive world of ballroom dancing, that some critics might be
tempted to label as a cross between DIRTY DANCING and FLASHDANCE?</P>
<P>     If PRETTY WOMAN is your favorite film, go for the costumes, the
dancing and the terrific hairstyles.  If you lean towards THE PLAYER, go
see this film for the touching parable of growing up, and overcoming
repressive unquestioned "traditional values."  But most of all, go
because the film is a gift: a thoroughly Aussie maverick that kicks up
its heels at film-making conventions, and has some great comedy and
dancing to boot.</P>
<P>     The film's slight plot grew from a fifty-minute Australian stage
play, that started out as a student project at NIDA (National Institute
for the Dramatic Arts).  It toured Oz to great acclaim and won awards at
an international competition in Czechoslovakia.  The Aussie producers
were unable to convince overseas distributors of financiers to help fund
the film, so they turned to their own devices for fund-raising, and made
it "their way."</P>
<P>     Though lacking stars of any renown in North America, STRICTLY
BALLROOM is a thoroughly engaging film chock full of Oscar-worthy
supporting performances, terrific dancing, comedy drawn in brush strokes
broad enough to make Monty Python envious.  This film may be the
international launching pad for Paul Mercurio, a highly gifted
choreographer and lead dancer with a stream of hits in Oz.  (I had the
privilege to watch him dance live from front row seats in August, where
he sucked up the audience's attention like a black hole ... what 5 other
dancers in the company?)  With a young Tyrone Power's face on Marky
Mark's body, Mercurio is a candidate for the decade's next "poster boy"
role.</P>
<P>     The film's only disappointment (which won't affect Americans) is
that the camera isn't "kind" enough to Mercurio, and film stock flattens
much of his dynamic energy.  It's a shame that more of his brilliant
dance career wasn't shared by a world audience.  A chance to see
Mercurior perform live on stage is well worth whatever means it takes to
get "down under" to his next venue.</P>
<P>     The film is an uneven mix of visual and acting styles, but taken as
a whole, the film is reminiscent of the works of Swiss artist Paul Klee,
who according to the Encyclopedia Britannica "attempted through his own
highly inventive pictorial language to convey the essential spiritual
significance of things."  That wouldn't be a bad description of director
Baz Luhrmann's style.  From the deadpan seriousness of the love story to
the giddy Peter Max colored dance sequences and flashbacks, each scene
carries much more than meets the eye.</P>
<P>     Synopsis: Scott Hastings (Mercurio) appears to have it all: looks,
charm, and a shoe-in for the next Pan Pacific Grand Prix Champion.  He
shocks the Ballroom Federation's dictatorial director, and his lifetime
ballroom dancing parents (who missed their chance and are counting on
Scott...) by introducing some wild new steps in the rhumba competition.
Losing his partner of 15 years, Scott's only hope is to bring ugly
duckling Fran (Tara Morice) up to speed.  Along the rocky path to the
finals Scott learns a thing or too about love and loyalty from Fran, and
about "real" dancing from Fran's flamenco dancing immigrant father.</P>
<P>     Tara Morice brings sensitivity and charm to what could have been a
throw-away role.  Pat Thomson gives a world-class performance as the
bleached blond comet of a stage mother who'll stop at nothing to hitch
her son Scott to his rightful partner "Tina Sparkle" (instead of the
little "nothing" with the bad complexion.)  The rest of the cast lend
some flesh and substance to cartoon-like characters.</P>
<P>     Though on the surface, *very* Australian in it's fixation with
Ballroom Dancing and class structure, the film has a heart-felt message
for anyone who grew up to be something other than their parents
best-laid plans.  The "rebellion" carried out in dance steps will speak
to anyone who's had to put a lid on it at work, or in any other highly
compromising environment.  In spite of this, I fear for the film's
acceptance, in that much of it's satire may be misinterpreted, and the
broader comic icons will make easy targets for myopic critics who
collapse into comparisons on any film with vaguely familiar themes.</P>
<P>     Though it remains to be seen how American audiences will warm to
this quirky film, it's been picked up for distribution in 86 countries,
and was voted audience favorite at both the Toronto and Cannes film
festivals.  If the film accomplishes nothing more than exposing Paul
Mercurio to a wider audience (though so far he's a better dancer than
actor) the film will proved its worth on at least one level.</P>
<P>     While in Sydney recently, I was also able to visit the Powerhouse
museum and see an exhibit about the creation of the film.  Though
Americans might think some of the ballroom scenes are overblown
caricatures, Polaroids of actual events reveal the film to be visually
very true to its topic.  Some of the competition scenes were filmed on
the floor of the *real* Pan Pacific Ballroom Competition, which
ironically created an eerie sense of unreality.  (Also got a close up
look at the costumes, which are dynamite.)</P>
<P>     Local Australian critics interpreted STRICTLY BALLROOM as a coming
of age film for Australia, in which a more diverse population is
revealed to have more to offer than the stodgy Anglo values of countless
decades.  Even if you have trouble taking the love story between Mecurio
and Morice seriously, you'll still enjoy broad references to shameless
plugs for Coca Cola, and some smug camera angles that wink satirically
at DIRTY DANCING.  Though not the Hope Diamond, the film has enough
facets and catches enough light to make the nearly two-hour length seem
to fly by all too fast.</P>
<P>     To be distributed by MiraMax, look for openings in major cities
sometime in February/March.</P>
