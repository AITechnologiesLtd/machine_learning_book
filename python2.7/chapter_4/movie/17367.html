<PRE>The Stepford Teens?  </PRE>
<P>In this mildly diverting thriller, a group of troublesome
teens are tamed through brainwashing techniques developed by Cradle
Bay High School psychiatrist Dr Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood, from The
Sweet Hereafter, etc).  He has created a group of well behaved,
diligent students, known as the Blue Ribbons, who pursue excellence
both at school and within the community.  However, there is a fatal
flaw in his technique.  Every time one of these seemingly perfect
adolescents develops sexual urges, they go ballistic, erupting into
erratic and violent behaviour.  The town's sheriff covers up most of
the damage, while Caldicott soothes anxious parents with lots of
psycho-babble.</P>
<P>Steve Clark (James Marsden, from the mini-series Bella Mafia,
etc), the new kid in town, becomes suspicious of their unnervingly
docile behaviour and sets out to expose Caldicott's sinister
experiment.  He receives help from some fellow misfits, including the
paranoid geek Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl), the pigmentally challenged UV
(Chad E Donella), and the tomboyish Rachel (Katie Holmes, from the
popular tv soap Dawson's Creek).</P>
<P>Disturbing Behaviour's simple plot reads like an adolescent
version of Ira Levin's 70's thriller The Stepford Wives, with
judicious borrowings from other, far superior films (A Clockwork
Orange, Village Of the Damned, etc) thrown in for good measure.
Actually, it also reads like something from a novel by John Saul, a
best selling American horror writer whose unsettling, but formulaic,
thrillers are set in small, picturesque towns like Cradle Bay, and
primarily deal with troubled teens threatened by strange and sinister
events.</P>
<P>Screen writer Scott Rosenberg (Beautiful Girls and Things To
Do In Denver When You're Dead, etc) makes little attempt to disguise
his influences, but he lacks the flair and reverential, knowing style
that gun writer Kevin Williamson would have brought to the material.
The film obliquely raises the question of which is the more disturbing
behaviour - that of the teens, rebelling against authority and
struggling to establish their own identity, or the sinister
machinations of Caldicott to produce mindless robots, lacking any
sense of individuality, who systematically conform to an imposed code
of discipline?</P>
<P>First time feature director David Nutter hails from a
background on spooky tv series (The X Files, Millennium, etc), but he
fails to bring much tension or sense of unease to this film.  Nutter
brings virtually every cliché of the genre into play here, and the
film displays precious little originality or imagination, even down to
the soundtrack.  Even the obligatory sting in the tale reeks of
desperation, and lacks credibility.  The contemporary teen horror film
genre, which largely began with Scream, seems to have run its course
if this inferior, feeble effort is any indication.</P>
<P>The film will hold a modicum of appeal for its targeted
teenage audience, most of whom will be drawn by the presence of
Holmes.  Disturbing Behaviour features a cast of hunky new comers, who
work well within the limitations of a horribly clichéd script.
However, performances are not of great importance here.  Worst of all
is William Sadler (Die Hard 2, etc), whose horribly cheesy performance
as the school's janitor, who is not quite as simple as he seems, is
reminiscent of Billy Bob Thornton.</P>
<P>Disturbing Behaviour is mercifully brief, and, at a brisk 83
minutes, doesn't outstay its welcome.  Nonetheless, audiences would be
better off waiting for the far superior and more sophisticated teen
drama Cruel Intentions.  Catch this one on video if you must!
