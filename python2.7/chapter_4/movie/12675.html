<PRE>THE EX (1997)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix.  
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix.  </PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (out of five)  </PRE>
<P>Based on a novel by John Lutz.  
Screenplay by Larry Cohen and John Lutz.  
Directed by Mark L. Lester.  
Starring Yancy Butler, Suzy Amis, Nick Mancuso.  
Rated R (contains violence, nudity, and profanity)  87 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Easily-angered, chainsmoking architect David encounters his
homicidal first wife Diedre five years after their divorce.  Diedre easily
cons David's not-so-bright new wife Molly into believing she's a child
psychologist so that she can influence Molly and David's quick-tempered
son, Michael.  Diedre, at the same time, murders a bunch of people.  </P>
<P>Comments:  THE EX is a very bad movie.  I haven't seen a turkey of this
magnitude in quite a while.  I kept vacillating, however, between giving
THE EX one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor
(ultimately, I decided to split the difference and give it two stars).  </P>
<P>As summarized briefly in the synopsis, this is yet another
spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie.  I'm not sure how many
films have been produced since FATAL ATTRACTION which use this tired
storyline, but it seems like 10,000,000,000.  THE EX, however, though
following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre, differs
slightly from the norm in that, at least, it doesn't take itself too
seriously like so many other duds do (MALICIOUS and STALKED are two
examples which come to mind).  Those involved in the movie realize they're
in a turkey, apparently, and turn in hammy performances which compliment
the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script.  </P>
<P>THE EX's storyline, as I said, incorporates many cliches predominant in
films of its nature; however, the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable
that, after a while, the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in
the realm of the movie.  Diedre, David's first wife, kills and kills and
kills, for example, without ever having to worry about police
investigations and the like (it's not as though she's bright enough not to
leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime).  David and his new wife
Molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why Michael, their
son, has emotional problems, specifically his inability to control his
anger.  Though David smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at
people every other minute in the movie, the connection between him and his
son is not made.  Molly is easily swayed by Diedre into believing she's a
child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her
son.  Time and time again, things do not add up in this movie.  If a viewer
can't accept this fact, then he will definately not like THE EX.  If, on
the other hand, he can appreciate the movie for its campiness, then he'll
probably like it much better.  </P>
<P>I don't mean to necessarily suggest, however, that THE EX is a memorable
exercise in camp.  Even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle,
this movie isn't all that successful.  THE EX does have its moments,
though, almost all of which involve Yancy Butler (the psychotic Diedre) and
Nick Mancuso (David).  These two actors turn in decidedly hammy
performances which, oftentimes, elicit chuckles from the audience.  The
truly awful lines written for them help this humor along.  Butler gets the
larger portion of bad dialogue; every time her character kills someone, she
has a punchline that's unbelievably inane.  When she murders a tenant of an
apartment she wishes to use to spy on David, for example, Diedre whacks the
elderly lady with a crowbar and states "I'm so sorry, your lease is
terminated."  Or how about when Diedre takes out her therapist in another
ridiculous scene?  (Diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted, so
she decides to visit Diedre, alone, in her new apartment -- never
realizing, of course, that it's not her's.  Therapists typically are
catatonically brain-dead in these movies).  Having successfully snuffed the
woman out, Diedre looks at the body and says: "What was it that you always
said to me at the end of each session, Dr. Jones?  Oh, that's right.  'I'm
sorry, but your time is up!'"  This is what passes for humor in the film.
The audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan (the type of groan that
suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although
watching it they are).  Nick Mancuso's chainsmoking, nervous-wreck
character does not have the cheesy lines that Butler's character delivers,
but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic
relief.  In between drags off his cigarette, for instance, in one of the
movie's best scenes, David tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his
ex-wife is.  In exaggerated exasperation, he nearly shouts "the woman is a
cuckoo-bird!"  (Trust me, it is funny in context.)  </P>
<P>And so, the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion.  I
won't reveal the ending specifically (though anyone remotely familiar with
thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film
review), but I will say that THE EX has one of the biggest fire hazards
appearing recently in film.  Molly and David own a cabin that becomes
engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds!  Molly, at one point in
the film, not-so-brilliantly observes, after discovering Diedre has moved
into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them, that "she's
crazy."  You'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey.  I'd avoid
it unless it's on TV and you come across it.  If you do, you may want to
watch it, groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot, and feel good that
you didn't spend money renting it.  </P>
