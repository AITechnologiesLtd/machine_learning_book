<PRE>                                 THE EDGE</PRE>
<P>At last a thriller with a protagonist who could be a contestant on
Jeopardy.  That is billionaire Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins).
Charles thinks it is a wasted talent to know every kind of trivia;
nothing one can use in real life.</P>
<P>Real life is his wife, very much younger than he, the stunning
Mickey who is a model on a shoot in Alaska with Robert Green (Alec
Baldwin) the high fashion photographer;  her husband has been
invited to come along..  Green is in love with Mickey, as who could
resist her incredible smile?   When a new site for  the shoot is
needed, Robert, accompanied by Charles, take off by plane to scout
other locales.  The plane crashes in an Alaskan wilderness, and now
Charles and Robert have to depend on each other for survival. What
complicates matters is that Charles is certain his wife and Robert
have been having an affair.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Charles' knowledge of  trivia becomes the only thing
between living and dying.   There is little of which he is unable to
take advantage, from making fire to warding off a bear who is intent
on tracking them.  The question is, does Charles really want to save
Robert; another question is, would Robert kill Charles if there was
a chance to get back to civilization without him?   The two are as
unlike personalities as ever have been thrown together in a struggle
for life.     This is equally true of the acting styles of Hopkins
and Baldwin.   Add that the director chose a famous super-model to
portray a famous super-model and Macpherson came through very
nicely.</P>
<P>THE EDGE is a tensely fascinating thriller with two  men wary of
each other, a determined bear who does not care which of the two he
tears apart, the weather and the isolation of being lost and
probably never found.    Exceptional performance by Hopkins . . . as
always.</P>
