A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Robert Iscove</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Lee Fleming</PRE>
<P>Starring: Freddie Prinze, Jr, Rachael Leigh Cook</P>
<P>Synopsis:
High school heartthrob and top jock Zach Syler (Freddie Prinze, Jr.)
gets dumped by his girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for a
self-absorbed MTV-type actor. On the rebound, Zach says to a buddy
something like: "Without her hair and makeup, Taylor is just a C-minus
GPA with a wonder bra. I can turn any female nerd into the high school
prom queen." Soon enough a bet is made, and an introverted girl named
Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) is selected for the relationship with Zach
which will turn her into the prom queen. Of course, once the glasses
come off, Laney is cute. Will true romance blossom? Will unpopular Laney
turn out to be a gem? Will cute Zach fall in love with Laney and realize
he's not just conducting a cruel experiment?</P>
<PRE>Opinion:
Let me get something off my chest about today's teen movies before
discussing SHE'S ALL THAT.</PRE>
<P>These days many TV shows and movies targeted towards teenage audiences
invariably star sexually active 20-something actresses and actors
masquerading as kids. One extremely disturbing trend in Hollywood lately
is the Lolita syndrome where an adult has a sexual relationship with a
child. For example in the TV show DAWSON'S CREEK a female teacher has
sex with a male student. In SHE'S ALL THAT, Zach's high school
girlfriend Taylor is the sex object of an older, MTV-type male actor.
Similarly, there's a hint of Lolita in the scene when Zach is crowned
prom king, and an enthralled female teacher plants a slobbery kiss on
Zach's face (imagine if it were male teacher and a female kid). The
previews shown at the movie theater ten minutes before I watched SHE'S
ALL THAT advertised another "teen flick" about two teenagers plotting to
sexually manipulate a naive girl. I'm glad that many so called "teen
movies" have a PG-13 rating, because you don't want child audiences to
mistake fantasy for reality.</P>
<P>Hollywood is fantasy. And if I am to believe my eyes, behavior which is
statutory rape in real life is "cutting edge" in TV and movies routinely
targeted towards younger audiences. Adult supervision, and rating these
movies PG-13 might help ensure that, before being exposed to societal
standards that nonchalantly portray adults having sex with high school
children, the youngsters in the audience can tell fact from titillation.</P>
<P>SHE'S ALL THAT is predictable material, but done tastefully and
artistically executed. For example, as Taylor explains to Zach why she
is dumping him and reminisces about a summer beach party, instead of
just leaving it as dialogue, the scene changes to the beach party
itself. Both Taylor and Zach physically step into the party like
phantoms and examine it even though Zach was never at the party and it's
just Taylor's explanation.</P>
<P>SHE'S ALL THAT is a teen romance about two good kids with good behavior
who end up liking each other. I watched the movie in a theater full of
teens (mostly girls coming to ogle Freddie Prinze, Jr.), and they seemed
well satisfied with it.</P>
