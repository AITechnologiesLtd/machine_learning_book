Double Jeopardy</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Double Jeopardy" starts out rather rough and lifeless, not quite sure how
to set itself up for the real story. This is where Libby (Judd) is framed
(or did she really do it?) for the murder of her hubby Nick. She's quickly
herded off to prison where she spends six (or was it eight?) years in what
seems like 30 seconds. From there she's released to an institution for
parolees which is overseen by Tommy Lee. This is where the movie really
starts (so show up to the theater at least 30 minutes late).</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy gives Libby the right to blow Nick away (if he's still
alive) without worry of a second trial ("not true" says one real life lawyer
I've heard). Anyway (for the purposes of the film), we're left to wonder if
this sweet loving wife, would do it. But Libby is more interested in finding
her son. So she busts out of the parole halfway house and begins breaking
all kinds of laws. Which leads to two or three big action sequences. The
first making me painfully embarrassed for the filmmakers. The second being
very enjoyable and almost perfectly believable. At that moment I was willing
to change my mind about this picture. But an absurd cemetery scene near the
end buried any hopes of that.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee is awesome as always. Ashley Judd is unusually un-inspired, though
on occasion delivers a zinger. For example, when getting hit-on by some
unknowing male she responds, "Sure, I'd love to sit and chat with you, but
I've just got to call my parole officer first." The movie for the most part
is a hodgepodge of drama, action and even comedy. It just doesn't flow,
giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors.</P>
<P>The film would have benefited from a longer more in-depth prison experience,
during which we could have seen Judd learn all the tricks of the trade.
Tricks that would come in handy later. To do this, time could be taken away
from the frame job sequences. Or trash that whole section altogether (it's
simply not compelling, even if you don't know if she really killed him or
not). Start in prison, tell the frame-job story in flashbacks (if needed).
Kill and bury the cemetery scene. Develop Lee's conflicting motivation to
both arrest and assist Judd -- that's the most interesting aspect of the
film anyway.</P>
