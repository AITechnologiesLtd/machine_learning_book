<PRE>LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND (M).  
(Niche Pictures/Maverick Films)
Director: Richard Kwietniowski
Stars: John Hurt, Jason Priestley, Fiona Loewi, Sheila Hancock, Maury 
Chaykin
Running time: 93 minutes.</PRE>
<P>From first time writer/director Richard Kwietniowski comes
this droll, delightfully entertaining and dry fish out of water tale.
Based on Gilbert Adair's cult novel, long thought to be unfilmable,
Love And Death On Long Island is also a contemporary, lightweight
reworking of Death In Venice, albeit with a far more comic bent.</P>
<P>Giles De 'Ath (John Hurt) is a reclusive, high brow British
novelist, who disdains much of the technology of the twentieth
century.  His home is devoid of many of the devices that most of us
take for granted, and he still punches out his stories on an old
manual type writer.  "I'm a writer.  I write.  I don't process words,"
he says tartly in a rare radio interview.  But he is reluctantly
dragged into the twentieth century when he sees a dreadful American
teen movie by mistake.</P>
<P>One day when he accidentally locks himself out of his flat,
Giles wanders into the local multiplex, hoping to see an E M Forster
adaptation.  He wanders into the wrong cinema and instead finds
himself watching Hotpants College II, a dreadful adolescent comedy
that makes Porky's look sophisticated.  He is about to walk out when
he sees Ronnie Bostock (Beverley Hills 90210's Jason Priestley) in a
bit part.  He becomes obsessed with the handsome young actor.  Before
long, Giles is tracking down his earlier films, with equally dire
titles like Skid Marks and Tex Mex, and learning everything he can
about Bostock from reading teen magazines.</P>
<P>Eventually he makes an uncharacteristic decision, and flies
off to Long Island to try and track down Bostock.  It is the beginning
of a strange and unusual, but ultimately doomed, friendship between
the articulate and witty De 'Ath and the handsome but gormless Ronnie.
Giles also tries to prevent Ronnie from marrying his long time girl
friend Audrey (Fiona Loewi).</P>
<P>Love And Death is a poignant and comic fable about a
magnificent obsession.  But the film also explores the clash of
cultures - between the older generation and the young, between Britain
and America, and between the literary world and the shallow
pretensions of the movie industry.  There are some wonderful scenes as
De 'Ath comes to terms with the bewildering technology of the
twentieth century.  There is another hilarious scene when the
supercilious author wanders into a video store to check out some of
Bostock's previous works, much to the bemusement and glee of the
clerk.</P>
<P>But the film seems to come to an abrupt, almost unsatisfactory
conclusion, and it seems as though Kwietniowski had no idea how to
resolve this painfully doomed mismatch.</P>
<P>Hurt has made a career of playing eccentrics, and he is
magnificent here.  His usually pained expression works a treat, and
gives his least mannered performance for quite some time.  He seems to
revel in the sly, acerbic dialogue.  And while the pompous Giles finds
himself in some embarrassing situations, Hurt never allows him to
become a ridiculous figure.  Priestley's film career has not exactly
been a success, but he seems quite comfortable with his role as the
male bimbo, and enjoys this opportunity to send up his own image.</P>
