<P>The X-Men hold a special place in my heart. As a kid, I was there when they
made their debut in 1963. On the surface, the Marvel comic book bore quite a
resemblance to The Fantastic Four, another Stan Lee and Jack Kirby creation,
but the X-Men represented a crucial twist on the superhero concept. These
young people were mutants, treated with fear and hatred by mainstream
society just because they were different.</P>
<P>Such an inspired notion. In one fell swoop, Lee and Kirby gave the
disenfranchised a comic they could call their own. The X-Men were surrogates
for blacks, gays, alienated teens - any group who felt the sting of
stereotyping and societal intolerance. While Superman and the Fantastic Four
battled galactic overlords, the X-Men were busy fighting simply for their
right to be, and kicking major bigot ass when necessary.</P>
<P>Professor Charles Xavier, a wheelchair-bound telepath of enormous power,
served as teacher, father figure and group leader in his position as
headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Children, a haven for mutant
youth. Over the years, the series experienced major changes, including an
enormously successful reboot that replaced the original students with a more
ethnic and racially diverse group of mutants. Eventually, the X-Men
franchise split into a series of titles featuring so many characters that it
was virtually impossible to keep track of them all.</P>
<P>Twenty-seven years after their creation, the X-Men have finally made it to
the big screen, in what may well be the best cinematic superhero adaptation
to date. While director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") shifts
characters around and stumbles periodically, he has captured the essence of
the comic book. The core team makeup is different, featuring two of the
original group and three from the later days, but the magic remains the
same.</P>
<P>"X-Men" takes place in the near future, with ultra-conservative Senator
Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) campaigning for the Mutant Registration Act,
which would allow the government to keep tabs on any citizen with mutant
DNA. While Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) of the X-Men tries to reason with
the self-righteous politician at a Senate hearing, Professor Xavier (Patrick
Stewart) senses the presence of an old friend in the chamber. The mutant
known as Magneto (Ian McKellan) does not share the guarded optimism of
Xavier. A Holocaust survivor, Magneto sees the hearings as the first step
towards a genetic war, and the master of magnetism is ready to make a
preemptive strike.</P>
<P>The battle lines are drawn. Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants: the
shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), man-beast Sabretooth (Tyler
Mane) and Toad (Ray "Darth Maul" Park), an incredibly agile creature with a
tongue that would make Gene Simmons weep with envy, versus Xavier's A-Team:
Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots laser blasts from his eyes, weather
witch Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey, who has a major in telekinesis and
a minor in telepathy. Joining the trio are two newcomers: Rogue (Anna
Paquin), a teen who temporarily drains the life force from anyone she
touches, and Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), a skilled athlete with amazing
healing powers and retractable, razor sharp claws that spring from the top
of his hands.</P>
<P>Director Singer, working from David Hayter's efficient script, forwards the
plot while providing a wealth of treats for X-fans. While visiting the
school, which has a much larger population than the one in the comic, other
brief, but cleverly staged appearances. There are several in-jokes for
attentive viewers, and we see the beginning of the love triangle between
Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey.</P>
<P>While most superhero movies struggle for an epic feel, "X-Men" thankfully
sets its burners a bit lower, playing like a solid issue of a cinematic
comic book and taking the time to flesh out a few major characters. The
story revolves around Wolverine, with Aussie actor Hugh Jackson giving a
knockout performance as the Canuck loner (asked if it hurts when his claws
come out, he quietly answers "Every time."). Although the onscreen Rogue is
significantly different from her comic book counterpart, Anna Paquin
beautifully conveys the angst of a girl who cannot ever enjoy the touch of
another person. And, thanks to a heart-wrenching prologue, we see the
damaged child beneath Magneto's regal persona. As expected, Ian McKellen and
Patrick Stewart are wonderful, particularly during their scenes together.</P>
<P>Despite limited screen time, Famke Janssen firmly establishes Jean Grey as
one tough, smart cookie and, in James Marsden's hands, the smirking,
tight-assed Cyclops becomes the perfect foil for Wolverine's verbal barbs.
Unfortunately, Halle Berry's Storm receives no personal development. To make
matters worse, Berry is saddled with a chintzy white wig straight from the
Eva Gabor Woolworth's collection.</P>
<P>Other quibbles include Sabretooth's growl, which sounds too much like the
MGM lion. A synthesis of animal and human roars would have been more
effective. And, primarily due to extensive wire work, some of the action
segments are a bit stiff. But these are minor complaints. "X-Men" neatly
balances character interaction with grand battles, while never forgetting
the theme that made the series a pop classic. For this fan, the film was a
very pleasant surprise. I suspect that those unfamiliar with the comic book
will have quite the good time as well.</P>
