            - Danson & Culkin</PRE>
<P>     There's one really good scene in GETTING EVEN WITH DAD, the failed
father-and-son frolic starring odd couple Ted Danson and Macaulay
Culkin.  Danson plays Ray, a robber whose son (Culkin) stashed the
stash of dad's last haul.  Timmy will tell, but on one condition: if
father collects then son ain't staying.  (He knows the cops are close
and doesn't want dad to disappear.  He'd rather go back and live with
his aunt.)</P>
<P>     Said scene unfolds at a bus station.  Ray has just placed his boy
on a bus and, walking away, is trying to decide if he *really* wants
the cash over the kid.  The cops are watching, of course, and they'll
round-up Ray the moment he unlocks the locker containing the cache.</P>
<P>     The scene is great:  Danson steps from the bus, stops, and
thinks.  He looks back, pauses, and keeps walking.  Cut to Culkin,
looking sad.  Cut back to Danson, stopped again.  Thinking.  All while
the cops--and the audience--are watching.</P>
<P>     Forget the rest of the film-- this is one of those great, dopey
Hollywood moments when a character comes to life right before our
eyes.  We swoon to these simple emotions, shamelessly holding our
breath as we wait for Ray's decision.  Will he?  Won't he?  It's great
schmaltz and the very reason we go to the movies.</P>
<P>     Too bad that most of the audience will have either *left* or
fallen asleep by this time.</P>
<P>Hardly *anything* is worth watching in the first hour of GETTING EVEN
WITH DAD.  Danson is sincere and that's about it.  His glued-on
ponytail is more interesting than co-star Culkin, though, who
sleepwalks through his scenes.</P>
<P>     Sartain and Rubinek are mildly amusing as Ray's unaccomplished
accomplices. (One inspired moment has Tweedledumb and Tweedledumber
trying to rob a collection box.  Stay awake and hear Sartain yell
"Wow!  Nun!" to great effect.)  Glenne Headly is the strangest find--a
rookie cop who pathetically falls for Danson.  Ugh.</P>
<P>     Forget either the script or the direction.  Here's a film that
features two, count 'em two, musical montages *and* Macaulay Culkin
doing bad lipsynch.  Shudder. (Maybe the title is a secret stab at Kit
Culkin, who must be wondering why he consented to this slop.)</P>
<P>     The saving grace is that GETTING EVEN WITH DAD delivers a
well-intentioned message, as best exemplified in the aforementioned
scene.  Too bad the film sucks.</P>
