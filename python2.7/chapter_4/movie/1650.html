<PRE>                                  HERMAN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     HERMAN is a Norwegian film directed by Erik Gustavson, written by
Lars Saabye Christensen from his own novel.  It stars Anders Danielson
Lie, Frank Robert, Elisabeth Sand.  Unrated.  In Norwegian, with English
subtitles.</P>
<P>     HERMAN is that unlikeliest of films, a fresh coming-of-age story.
It is about an 11-year-old Oslo schoolboy, Herman (Anders Danielson
Lie), who is a rather withdrawn, runty kid, bullied at school and
misunderstood at home.  He lives in a vivid fantasy world that includes
a Norwegian-speaking Zorro and walking into traffic whilst pretending to
be blind.  His only friends are his ailing grandfather and a beer-soaked
neighbor who was once a gardener to the king and who has pretty vivid
fantasy life himself until it turns into a first-class case of the DTs.
Herman's already fragile world really unravels when his barber discovers
a bald patch on the child's head, the first symptoms of alopecia areata,
an incurable cosmetic disorder that will cause him to lose all his hair
in time.</P>
<P>     It is Herman's progressive reactions to his malady and his growing
baldness that mark his growth and maturity.  His alopecia is, on one
level, merely a symbol of the agonies and changes that we all go through
moving from childhood to adulthood.  But like all good symbols, this one
is vividly specific, as Herman moves through anger (at his fate and at
his parents who are at something of a loss to know how to handle
things), onto various strategies, disguises, and other forms of denial
and withdrawal, and ultimately landing on his feet in a charming act of
acceptance.</P>
<P>     Herman as played by Lie believably, ingratiatingly, and often
comically.  His performance is likable, light-hearted, and completely
natural.  He manages to make the unusual point that even a child in a
stable, functional, loving family can still have a childhood marked by
pain and insecurity, that growing up is hellish for all of us.  Herman
performs the more accustomed role, too, of deflating adult pretenses and
evasions, of finding the truth amidst the lies.</P>
<P>     This is a totally charming film and I recommend it highly.  It's
current run in Seattle (Metro Cinemas) is its U.S. premiere.  It's
being distributed by RKO Pictures.  If it comes to your area, do
yourself the favor of going.</P>
