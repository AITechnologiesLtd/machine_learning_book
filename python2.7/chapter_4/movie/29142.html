Fine Line release.115 minutes. Rated R.</P>
<P>Leigh and Cumming are a married couple. He is a Brit bisexual writer, she 
is an actress whose career is menaced. They have recently gotten back 
together after one year's separation. And to celebrate their sixth wedding 
anniversary, they invite several friends (or "friends"?)--all in showbiz in 
one way or another, plus, for "political" reasons, next-door neighbors whom 
they have never seen but with whom they have been having a fight about a 
too-barking dog. The party is at the couple's modern, to-die-for home in 
the Hollywood Hills.</P>
<P>Leigh is on my list of best performers. This movie confirms it. It matters 
little that the film's basic set-up is s not especially original. Once 
again we have motley people in a limited space. But, as in Lawrence 
Kasdan's "The Big Chill," the participants are not too motley, since the 
hosts and most of the guests are, and play, Hollywoodian professionals.</P>
<P>In the course of the evening, an above-average number of extant, new or 
possible relationships, of home as well as "trade" problems, are touched 
upon and/or catalyzed as relatively sane or quirky or fairly sane people 
interract. Much of this is due to the lessening of inhibitions courtesy of 
the drug Ecstasy.</P>
<P>The film has documentary authenticity. When the performances (acting, 
dialogue, behavior, etc.) do ring false, they are in fact "real-life false" 
since showbiz people almost always act no matter who, what or where they 
are. Conclusion: we get faithfulness off-stage, in private lives.  Their 
roles in this movie may or may not reflect personal experience, but even 
when they don't, they come from a milieu that the thespians, witers, 
directors, etc. are most familiar with.</P>
<P>It makes no difference to the audiences that certain parts or passages are 
improvised, or else pretend to be. The bottom line is convincing realism. 
If something looks or sounds phony, it is because it is that in life, when 
cameras are not running.</P>
<P>The movie has nothing that's radically fresh or unusual,  just as most 
people --including film-persons-- seldom offer anything new. But what you 
see and hear is very well done --notably its satires.</P>
<P>Unlike some other movies I have seen recentlly and that were shot in 
digital video with murky results, the video here is pretty close to the 
traditional celluloid. It could even fool you into non-awareness of the 
digital process.</P>
