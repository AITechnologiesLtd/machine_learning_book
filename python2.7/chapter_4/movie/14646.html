<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>One hears and reads opinions and statistics about Walt Disney Pictures.  
THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) was a watershed film, recharging the animation 
division.  THE LION KING (1994) grossed over $300 million.  The entries 
of the last two summers, however, disappointed both critics and Disney's 
money-counters.</P>
<P>There's no telling yet about MULAN'S box office, but for my money it's 
the best entry since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991).  </P>
<P>The legend on which the story is based is a masterful choice.  It avoids 
familiar, sexist lore;  it stresses the strengths and determination of a 
young heroine;  it even goes out of its way to avoid the formulaic 
treacle typical of Disney.</P>
<P>Though the narrative begins with action – a herd of Huns overrunning the 
Great Wall – it spends the next several minutes exposing and developing 
characters.  We meet minor figures like Mulan's grandmother, and the 
family dog "Little Brother," both of whom are used for comic relief.  
There is also a little cricket:  it's no Jiminy, but it does have a mute 
charm akin to the dog-like carpet's in ALADDIN.  But the character that 
casts his influence upon the rest of the film is Zhou, Mulan's father.</P>
<P>An aging, dignified and prayerful man, Zhou receives a conscription 
notice send by the Emperor .  One male from each family must fight the 
invading hordes.  Observing her father's ineffectual attempt to swing 
his long-closeted sword, Mulan makes the crucial decision of the film's 
premise.  She cuts off her hair, dons her father's armor, gallops off on 
her black stallion, Khan.  Zhou charges out of the house and falls in a 
rain puddle, horrified, of course, at his daughter's smashing of 
tradition and honor.  Voiced expertly by Soon-Tek Oh, Zhou appears again 
only briefly, at the far end of the tale;  but he proves to be a 
quick-forgiving father, causing many tears to spill, I am sure, from 
viewers' eyes.</P>
<P>Another laudable aspect of the film is that its characters are drawn 
consistently.  Way back when Snow White and her Prince moved with the 
grace of their human models, while the dwarves cavorted like the 
buffoonish caricatures they were, we witnessed the gap Disney pictures' 
animation style.  Look at Cinderella versus her step-sisters, even at 
Belle and her eccentric, barrel-like father.  No, the plain beauty of 
Mulan does not contrast strongly with the supporting roles.  Captain Li 
Shang (voice of B. D. Wong), Mulan's would-be love interest, does not 
differ strikingly from the other males in the story.  The Huns are an 
exception;  they are demonized through lack of development and through 
Neanderthal bulkiness.  Miguel Ferrer, in his role of Shan-Yu, creates 
the most velvety and threatening male voice since Robbie Benson's Beast.</P>
<P>MULAN is strongest in the story of its heroine's quest.  Although the 
film is too short to be considered picaresque in nature, we watch Mulan 
meet and conquer many obstacles, from training to rejection as a 
meddlesome female.  She is certainly a dynamic character, a strong woman 
who does not spend her time waiting to be rescued.  Instead, she 
conceives the rescue schemes.  </P>
<P>I find it remarkable that MULAN can be criticized as though it were a 
live-action drama.  I was so caught up in the exposition that, when 
Eddie Murphy's dragon, the strutting sidekick Mushu, appeared, I felt a 
disturbing change in tone.  Then I remembered the audience.  This was a 
kids' picture that adults could enjoy too.  Along with Mushu, I admired 
the portrayal of Mulan's ancestors.  George Takei does nicely as Number 
1 Ancestor.  He leads a cast of ghosts that tells us a great deal about 
Chinese tradition.  A film 88 minutes long cannot do justice to such a 
culture;  however, we spy customs, dress, art and even some musical cues 
that serve as a thorough short course on that time.</P>
<P>Watching some scenes in MULAN – specifically the ones aided by computer 
digitalization – I was reminded of the racing introduction of THE 
RESCUERS DOWN UNDER and the dancing scene of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  When 
Shan-Yu appeared atop a snow-covered hill,  the horizon high in the shot 
to show the immense width of the landscape, I experienced the awe 
induced usually by the cinematography of war epics.  And when the Hun 
leader and his legions of mounted warriors commenced to cascade down the 
snow-covered mountain, I felt the slight but pleasurable vertigo evoked 
by carefully-placed cameras.  This animation is indeed top-notch.</P>
<P>The music accomplishes the main task of songs that appear in musicals:  
their lyrics further the plot.  That's all.  The numbers are not bad, 
just unremarkable.  I doubt even the Stevie Wonder song that accompanies 
the credits will receive much play on the radio.  </P>
<P>In future viewings – my daughter has already asserted that we will 
purchase the video – I will try to spot the twisted humor of animators, 
jokes like "SEX" spelled out in the dust and blown leaves of THE LION 
KING.  The silliest gag I noticed is the casting of Harvey Fierstein as 
a macho soldier who asks, late in the film, if his dress makes him look 
fat!</P>
<P>Because of Fu Zhou and his loving relationship with his daughter, it was 
all the more pleasant to catch MULAN on Father's Day weekend, its 
opening date.  My family was thankful for a G-rated film as summer 
began.  I understand other studios have noticed the scarcity of good 
family entertainment too.  But with MULAN, the best of Disney is back.</P>
