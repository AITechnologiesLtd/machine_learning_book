<P>In the meantime, a Native American named Pike Dexter (Eric Schweig, who was
Daniel Day-Lewis' brother in The Last of the Mohicans), who runs the town's
general store, has developed an attraction to Henry.  Pike is asked to
deliver meals prepared by the Widow Thayer to Henry and Sam, but instead
find fancy recipes online and prepares delicious meals for the two men,
while making his dog eat the Widow's yucky grub.  Pike can't even make eye
contact with Henry, which mistakenly comes off as rude behavior.</P>
<P>Because all of this is happening in an extremely rural Montana town with a
population slightly larger than Mariah Carey's fan base, you'd expect there
to be some kind of anti-gay backlash, but there isn't.  In fact, most of the
citizens of Big Eden bend over backward to help Pike win over Henry (because
it's, like, so obvious Dean matches up better with the town's mayor).  Eden
is nothing more than a small-town gay love triangle with no antagonist and
very little conflict.</P>
<P>Then again, what do I know?  Eden has won oodles of awards from various gay
and lesbian festivals, but also took home the top two trophies at the
Cleveland fest, beating critically praised stuff like Memento, Amores
Perros, With a Friend Like Harry and The Circle.  Aside from the gay angle,
Eden is a formulaic mess.  Besides the breathtaking scenery and another
chance to see Louise Fletcher teamed up with a really tall Indian (a la One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Eden is only interesting for the fact its star
plays a character that's returning to his hometown...not unlike Gross'
former television co-star Ellen DeGeneres, whose new show is about the same
thing.</P>
<P>1:57 - PG-13 for some mature thematic material</P>
