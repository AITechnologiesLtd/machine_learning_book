<P>     About thirty minutes into DESPERATE REMEDIES, I finally asked
myself the question:  "What am I watching?"  Defying categorization,
this movie is just plain weird, and unlike anything else currently
playing in theaters.  DESPERATE REMEDIES is a grand melodrama that's
completely aware of its over-the-top tendencies (in fact, it revels in
them).  The production is pervaded by an ongoing sense of surrealism,
and seems unconcerned about whether anyone believes what's going on or
not.</P>
<P>     For the record, there is a story, and it's a fairly delightful
blend of double-dealing and backstabbing.  One wonders what this might
have been like had it been filmed straight, without the production
elements interfering with the general enjoyment of the movie.  The
closest thing I can come up with is DANGEROUS LIAISONS.</P>
<P>     Fresh off a boat on the coast of a 19th Century arm of the British
empire, Lawrence Hayes (Kevin Smith) finds his services requested by
the cool-but-beautiful Dorothea Brook (Jennifer Ward-Lealand).
Dorothea needs someone to marry her sister Rose to keep the girl away
from her opium-supplying boyfriend Fraser (Cliff Curtis).  In return
for Lawrence's agreement to become Rose's husband, Dorothea is willing
to grant him title to a substantial piece of property.  The deal is
sealed, but Lawrence has ulterior motives--he wants Dorothea, and
intends to take any opportunity to get close to her.  However, while
Dorothea is as attracted to Lawrence as he is to her, she will not give
up her lover Anne (Lisa Chappell), and is engaged to marry the local
bigwig politician William Poyser (Michael Hurst).  How all these
various relationships get untangled, then re-tangled again, is the
subject of DESPERATE REMEDIES.</P>
<P>     Essentially, this is an arty Harlequin Romance--with the twist
that it never takes itself seriously.  Or, rather, it takes itself so
seriously that it's plain that the directors are having fun with the
material.  Unfortunately, their amusement comes at the audience's
expense.  DESPERATE REMEDIES is not a particularly engaging motion
picture.  With its vividly-colorful settings and operatic score, this
movie has difficulty curbing its excesses, and this overblown, self-
conscious approach distances the audience.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that there aren't some clever moments.
Particularly memorable are instances where a comment about removing
Fraser is accompanied by scissors snipping a thread, and where time
running out is emphasized by the ticking of a watch.  In general,
however, all the perks in DESPERATE REMEDIES are visual or gimmicky in
nature.  When it comes to the story, this movie is more than a little
flat.</P>
