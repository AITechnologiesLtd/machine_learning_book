<PRE>Metroland **1/2</PRE>
<PRE>not rated
starring Christian Bale, Lee Ross, Emily Watson, Elsa Zylberstein
written by Adrian Hodges
based on the novel by Julian Barnes
directed by Philip Saville</PRE>
<P>"You should be able to have affairs. It will be good for our
marriage. And don't worry, I'll still do your laundry and wash the
dishes." In Philip Saville's METROLAND, those are the lines spoken to
Chris(Christian Bale), by his wife Marion(Emily Watson), in a
recurring dream of his.</P>
<P>Chris and Marion live in 1970's Eastwood, a small town in England in
an area dubbed Metroland.  They are young, married and have a small
child. One early morning, Chris recieves an unexpected phone call from
a rebellious, despicable old friend named Toni(Lee Ross).  Toni
invites himself over for lunch, and he seems amazed at the change that
Chris has gone through.  "You're living your parents' life," he tells
Chris. It is then that Chris remembers the past through flashbacks.</P>
<P>It turns out that Chris lived in the Metroland area as a child, only
to leave to Paris to further his career in photography. While working
at a diner, he meets Annick(Elsa Zylberstein), a beautiful young
French woman(who speaks English) and begins a lusty, sex-filled
relationship with her. But while taking photos in the park, he meets
Marion for the first time, and begins seeing her often(but just as
friends). But when Chris lets Annick know about Marion, his
woman-friend, she freaks out and moves out, and Chris and Marion take
their relationship to the next level.</P>
<P>But as the film skips back to the present, we see how Toni is pushing
Chris to be a wild child again and cheat on his wife. But Chris is a
very trustworthy man, and monogamy is one thing that he is very
careful about. The marital dilemmas between Chris and Marion are the
core of METROLAND, and the best thing about it. Chris is conflicted
whether his stable life in Metroland makes him happy, or merely
content.</P>
<P>For the most part, METROLAND is a slow, weak film, saved only by
occasional good dialogue and acting. But as Chris and Marion's
marriage is questioned, the film becomes much more fascinating,
perhaps because of Bale and Watson. Those expecting to see a lot of
the great Emily Watson will be disappointed, but METROLAND gives her a
chance to restrain herself, as she plays a character not nearly as
animated as her previous ones. VELVET GOLDMINE's Bale similarly holds
his own, but one can only leave METROLAND wishing someone had given
both actors a better movie. Nonetheless, some parts of METROLAND are
better than others, but don't expect another Oscar nomination for
Watson; at least not yet.</P>
