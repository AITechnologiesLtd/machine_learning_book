<P>It's hard to imagine a better political satire than Election, Alexander
Payne's intelligent and genius follow-up to his 1996 film, Citizen
Ruth.  True, it's a story about a high school election, starring Reese
Witherspoon presidential candidate Tracy Flick, and Matthew Broderick as
Mr. McAllister, the teacher who hates her most.  But Election serves not
just as an acerbic attack on high school politics, but as an attack on
politics in general (now I know what Hillary Clinton was like in high
school).  The film features four dead-on performances; Broderick and
Witherspoon are both show masterful comic timing, but also give their
characters depth.  Chris Klein is wonderful as Paul Metzler, the big,
stupid, lovable jock oaf who runs against Tracy; Jessica Campbell is
also great as Paul's laconic, lesbian sister.  But what really makes
Election such a funny, touching, brilliant blast of a film is Payne's
direction:  he observes these people with such immaculate objectivity
and seething irony that you can't help but like them all, even with
their flaws.  In short, Election is what satire is all about.</P>
