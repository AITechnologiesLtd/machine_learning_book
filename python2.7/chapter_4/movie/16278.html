<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>There are films that grab one's attention, and then there are films where
one just doesn't know if our attention is supposed to be gotten or not. Many
of these films fall into the artsy category, and tend to disappear and not
be
noticed for much of anything. But every now and then, a film comes by that
is actually pretty good, although as far as action goes, it doesn't make
the grade.</P>
<P>The period that the story takes place, has a complete theatre dedicated to
it, and its affectations. It is called Restoration Theatre, and it is very
difficult to do well, unless one is well versed in the manners and styles of
the age. The film takes its cue from the its settings, and never lets it go.
And this is rare in film making. One could easily fall for the sentimental
story, or the period's affectations and its silly ways.  Instead one keeps
finding out more about the time and what went on.</P>
<P>Unfortunately ( for the main character ) in the middle of all this, a story
is born and he has to live with it.</P>
<P>This is the story of the period, before it really is the story of a  certain
Meryvel, who does not care for his job and work in the medical  field. He
finds it boring, and not pleasing, not to mention that it ruins  much of his
social life. As it happens, he develops a new style of  healing based on his
intuition, and this gets him to the king's chambers.  Here he is asked to
cure one of the king's favorite pets, a dog.  And of  course, Meryvel, has
no idea what he did, but somehow his way ( not  bleeding the patient )
happens to help cure the animal which places  Meryvel in the king's favor.</P>
<P>As time goes by, the king decides to use Meryvel. He will marry him off  to
his mistress, with the agreement that he will not bother her, spend  time
with her, and so on. But there is a larger sub-plot, that will  eventually
change the course of the film from where it is to another  place. It is the
plague that is beginning to foster in London, and  Charles II has not
figured out how to deal with it. He was too worried  about his new city
instead of taking the advise of his inferiors to  create sewers and water
mains.</P>
<P>Meryvel, finds that he is attracted to the King's mistress, even if she  is
not interested in him at all. And a court painter is brought in to  paint
the lady, and he is held up so that Meryvel can try to convince  the
mistress. Alas, the painter is also one of the king's stool pigeons,  and
eventually the little story is found out, and Meryvel has to leave,  and
does.</P>
<P>He ends up in a Quaker convent, where his brother is the medic. But his
brother's ways are the old ones and his efficiency is not evident.  Meryvel
promptly suggests a few changes, and in the course of affecting  one of
them, he ends up meeting a woman that is there. She appears crazy,  but
apparently is not, and he does not see the point in bleeding any  patients.
Eventually they come together and she gets pregnant. This is not good for
the convent and they both have to leave. And they are both  in the middle of
the London plague. During the nasty birth, the child  is saved, but the
mother dies. And from here, the story takes on some  rather sad, and
different moods. All of a sudden, we do not see the  court life, we see the
street deaths, and the court falling apart as  well.</P>
<P>The rest I won't spoil for you... but suffice it to say that some  poetic
justice does come about, even though the court's style of  justice could be
thought to be rather boring, and not dependable...  but as Charles says,
it's the best he can do as long as he is king.  But Meryvel's reputation as
a doctor is restored, and he is now a
valuable member of society, and one that is important in the recovery  that
London will have to undergo.</P>
<P>Perhaps the very best thing about this film, is that we do not really know
who is who, and what parts they are playing. There are no credits  at the
beginning, and I find that this is great. It takes you directly into the
"play" and makes the statement that the situation and the  story is the
point, not the actors, and the people that created the  film, which, REALLY,
is the way it should be.</P>
<P>And later we find out that Sam Neill is the king, Robert Downey Jr. is
Meryvel, and that Meg Ryan is the crazy woman. Should one remember this
before hand, the effect may have not been the same. All the performances are
excellent, and the film seems to be really well focused on its themes.</P>
<P>Worth seeing. Beautiful film, and won a couple of Oscars, the costumes
being one of them.</P>
