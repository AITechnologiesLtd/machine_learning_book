<PRE>THE OTHERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>THE OTHERS, brilliantly written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar, is the
quietest movie of the year, with characters who rarely talk much above a whisper
and with background sounds that are only a couple of decibels higher than dead
silence.  But don't worry, you won't miss anything since you'll be on the edge
of your seat throughout the most spell-binding mystery since THE SIXTH SENSE. 
For the longest time, Amenábar keeps us unsure not only as to what actually is
happening but also as to what kind of mystery it is.  Perhaps it's a ghost
story.  But it could be a psychological drama.  Then again, it might be
something else entirely.  As you watch it, don't get cocky.  Even if you think
you have figured it out, you may be wrong in more ways than one.  As one
character remarks prophetically, "There are going to be some big surprises."</P>
<P>The central character in this fascinating thriller is Nicole Kidman in a great
and creepily intensive performance.  She, however, is constantly upstaged by two
amazing child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who are stunning and
chillingly effective.  This is reminiscent of the way that Haley Joel Osment
managed to outdo Bruce Willis in THE SIXTH SENSE.</P>
<P>The story, set towards the end of World War II, happens mainly inside a large,
fog covered manor house on the British island of Jersey.  Grace (Kidman) lives
there with her two children, Anne (Mann) and Nickolas (Bentley).  As the story
starts, Grace's husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston), is off fighting in the
war.  </P>
<P>The children have a severe disease that makes them unable to handle any sunlight
whatsoever.   Grace carefully instructs the new servants -- the last ones
disappeared without even bothering to collect their wages -- that all doors are
to be kept closed and locked and all curtains drawn.  Fionnula Flanagan, Eric
Sykes and Elaine Cassidy play the new servants.  Even in their minor roles, they
contribute immensely to enhancing the mystery.</P>
<P>Grace is a high-strung woman who is used to maintaining military-like control of
her household and her children.  The events that unfold completely shake her
confidence.  It starts off when the mischievous Anne begins to torment her young
brother, Nickolas.  Anne scares the wits out of Nickolas with tales of a kid
named Victor, whom she claims to see.  Needless to say, her mother tells her to
stop it.  And that is only the setup for this intriguing story.  That's all I am
going to tell you, which isn't much.  This much I can guarantee, as you keep
trying to guess where the story is headed, you will not be disappointed when it
gets there.  </P>
<P>THE OTHERS runs 1:44.  It is rated PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening
moments and would be fine for kids around 12 and up, depending entirely on how
well they can handle fear of the unknown.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 10, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters. </P>
