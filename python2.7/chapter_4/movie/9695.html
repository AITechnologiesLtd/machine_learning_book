<PRE>                           BOOGIE NIGHTS</PRE>
<P>During the seven years the movie covers (1977-1984), Los Angeles was
a busy place: pornographic films, drugs and disco were the rage.  It
was during those same years that one film maker of porno films made
an attempt to legitimatize the genre and raise it to respectability.
Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) is one such who gives it a try.   What
happens next is what this film is all about, the ups and downs of
all whom the pornographic industry touched.</P>
<P>BOOGIE NIGHTS, under the watchful eye of its 26-year old director,
contains frontal nudity; despite this, at no time is there a single
frame that can be thought of as erotic.  Quite a feat.</P>
<P>All the characters in that industry want to be loved.  All have an
astigmatic view of the genre and their part in it.  There is the
story's star who changes his acting name from a simple Eddie Adams
to Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), a name he feels is in keeping with
the kind of roles he plays, someone who can put on a simulated (and
not so simulated) act of making love any time he wishes.  He is
young and dashing and invincible, etc. etc. . . . or so he thinks.
Everyone loves him; he has more money than he ever dreamed existed
as well as women all around him.  What more could an innocent,
untalented, uneducated young man want?</P>
<P>As the industry grew, Jack Horner became a kind of father to everyone
around him.  At the same time he is well aware that Freud would have
had a ball with any of them; in some way they are all sick or
deficient but none can see it.   They think they are just as good
actors as in legitimate films.   In his role as the "father" and
film maker, Reynolds does a superb bit of underlaying.</P>
<P>Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) wants to be a star, to be adored and
never stops to consider what is necessary to give up in order to
achieve stardom in porno films.   Then there is Rollergirl (Heather
Graham) an innocent who all picture long moves on roller skates,
lacking the intelligence to see the idiocy of that.</P>
<P>There are many more characters in the film, each meticulously drawn
to show the era, the madness and finally the disillusionment.  Fine
acting helps make the film very real.  There is Don Cheadle who
keeps changing his wardrobe in attempts to find out who he is.  Little
Bill is played by William H Macy.</P>
<P>For one fleeting second during the period covered by the film, some
thought that the film industry and the public would finally realize
that porno films was a serious, real art form;  that never happened.</P>
<PRE>            Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.</PRE>
