<PRE>The Hustler (1961)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 92</PRE>
<P>Like so many classic black and white films
from the early 1960s, "The Hustler" is a
tense, brooding drama whose only humor is
ironic in nature.  "The Hustler" is an outstanding
film that explores the relationships between
talent and success, love and desperation,
and greed and evil.</P>
<P>Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler,
traveling from city to city with fellow con
Myron McCormick.  Certain that he is the best
pool player around, Felson challenges Minnesota
Fats (Jackie Gleason, in his best film role) and
loses.  Newman nurses his wounded pride with the
help of alcoholic cripple Piper Laurie, and is
forced to team up with creepy, manipulative gambler
George C. Scott in order to mount a comeback.
Murray Hamilton, best remembered as the Mayor
in "Jaws", plays a Southern aristocrat whose
confidence is as over-extended as Newman's.</P>
<P>Based on the Walter Tevis novel, "The Hustler" was
nominated for a mountain of Academy Awards: Best Picture,
Best Director (Robert Rossen), Best Actor (Newman),
Best Actress (Laurie), Best Supporting Actor
(Gleason, Scott), and Best Adapted Screenplay
(Sidney Carroll).  The film won Oscars for Best
B & W Cinematography (Eugen Shuftan) and for its
sets.</P>
<P>The strength of "The Hustler" comes from the
script, which gives the characters both depth and
great lines.  The story is filled with tension,
deriving not only from Felson's fortunes at pool,
but also from his shifting relationships with
Laurie, Scott and McCormick.  Newman and especially
Laurie are sympathetic characters, and it is
always uncertain whether Newman's skill at pool
can overcome his personal demons.</P>
