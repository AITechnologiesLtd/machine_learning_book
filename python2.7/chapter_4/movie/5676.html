<PRE>                               THE FRIGHTENERS
                       A film review by Jean Loiselle
                        Copyright 1996 Jean Loiselle</PRE>
<P>Ok, when I went to see Frighteners, I thought I'd get another movie where 
they're too busy putting special effect that they forget to put in a 
plot, like Twister. I was pretty surprised that it included some type of 
a plot. I am a big fan of comedy-fantasy-horror movies (like Army Of 
Darkness by Sam Raimi). I thought this movie would be more like a horror 
movie with some funny cliches like most horror-comedy movies. But 
actually, it was a lot like a supernatural thriller. While watching it, 
you'll ask yourself all the classic serial-killer questions like: Who did 
it? Who the hell is this guy?</P>
<P>The special effects are really cool but some are not for the weak at 
heart. One thing that I really disliked about this movie is that you keep 
asking yourselves questions about plot mistakes and such. For an hour and 
a half I kept wondering things like:
Where did that spirit get that cape and blade thingie?
What happens to the spirits when the Reaper "kills" them?
That one got me going for a long time...I found some stuff quite 
disturbing like the fact that people can avoid going to hell simply by 
not going in a light funnel.</P>
<P>Also, some spirits were just too dumb to remember they could FLY! Like 
the guy who's getting buried and needs help, why doesn't he just FLY OUT? 
HELLO?!?!?! You can FLY!!</P>
<P>All in all, it was pretty cool. The super indestructible hero (who dies 2 
times in the movie but always manages to come back to life) is played by 
Michael J Fox. He does his role well, but in some parts he just doesn't 
convince me.</P>
<P>So if you want to see a movie about a con-man shooting holy water from a 
water pistol, you know which movie to watch.</P>
