<PRE>           GOJIRA NI-SEN MIRENIAMU (a.k.a. GODZILLA 2000)
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: : This is the first Godzilla movie
          to get a wide American release since GODZILLA
          '85.  And it is no bargain.  The plot is poorly
          constructed and things happen for no apparent
          reason.  The effects are better than in the
          past, but still occasionally cheesy.  Godzilla
          has a new look that makes him resemble more a
          martial arts weapon than a giant dinosaur.
          Still this film is fun for Godzilla fans who
          rarely get a chance to see the big guy on the
          big screen.  Non-fans are unlikely find much to
          enjoy.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     What can I say?  For the sort of viewer who enjoys seeing two
men in rubber monster suits battle over a city that looks like
cardboard boxes, this might be the film for you.  I liked it.
Godzilla got to me at an early age and I am too old to become
objective about Godzilla films now.  As I said in the capsule, there
is not a lot done really well in this film, but it is a lot of fun
for people who like Godzilla films.  There is a certain thrill of
anticipation in seeing the Toho Films banner at the beginning.  Even
the best are crudely made and often a little incoherent, but they
are also a good time.  Non-fans can be assured that they will not be
much impressed by GODZILLA 2000 and can tune out of this review at
this point.</P>
<P>     Plot?  Well, truth be known, there is not a whole lot of plot.
Scientist Yuji Shinoda left the employ of the Japanese government
and formed the minuscule Godzilla Prediction Network, a startup that
predicts where and when Godzilla will show up and strike next.  Yuji
does the science and Yuji's ten-year-old daughter does the financial
work.  They are joined on a Godzilla hunt by Yuki Ichinose, a
photojournalist looking for a story.  Together they discover that
finding Godzilla can be a big mistake.</P>
<P>     At the same time some scientists have found an odd rock, 600
feet across, in the ocean of Japan.  Because it shows some
intriguing abnormalities they decide to bring the rock to the
surface where it can be studied, lifting it with floats.  Oddly the
rock seems more enthusiastic about reaching the surface than can be
explained as it rises up past the floats.  It then hangs over the
water and waits for sunshine to activate it.  It seems under the
stone shell is an alien craft that has been waiting 60 million years
to come back to life so it can complete its mission.  It would be
telling to say what its mission is, except that logical or not,
there will of course be another monster for Godzilla to fight.  (And
of course it will be just roughly Godzilla's height.  Godzilla never
has any fifty-foot monsters to fight.)</P>
<P>     Word on the street has been that the new film is intended to
come right after the original Godzilla film in its own new series.
That was true of the film we call GODZILLA '85, which did spawn its
own separate series of Godzilla films in the 1980s and 1990s.  (To
save confusion I will use American titles.)  That second series
repeated many of the same mistakes that the first series did, but it
was aimed at a higher level.  The rumor has been that like GODZILLA
'85 (and of course the film we call GIGANTIS, THE FIRE MONSTER),
GODZILLA 2000 is a direct successor to the original GODZILLA, KING
OF THE MONSTERS.  However, a cursory look at the film tells us this
is simply not true.  Godzilla died in the first film and all other
films are supposed to feature a second very similar Godzilla beast.
Yet in GODZILLA 2000, attacks by Godzilla are taken to be a periodic
phenomenon.  There is even a Godzilla Prediction Network.  At the
end of the film there is a comment about all of Godzilla's attacks
in the past have taught lessons.  None of this would make sense if
only the events of the first film and this one had taken place.  The
second series apparently ended with the death of the second Godzilla
and his replacement by his son, just reaching maturity.  Logically
it would make sense to say that the new Godzilla is really the son
from the second series.  But so much logic is probably more than the
series can reasonably be expected to bear.</P>
<P>     Godzilla is like James Bond.  His looks change but the
character himself is timeless.  His face had a very lumpy appearance
and buck teeth in the earliest film and then became more dinosaur-
like for KING KONG VRS. GODZILLA.  As the series became more
childish and aimed at younger children his features became rounder
and less frightening.  In the second series he looked a lot better
and consistent from to film, but just a bit rubbery.  His looks
never changed.  For GODZILLA 2000 again his looks have been modified
to please the younger set.  This time, however, it is a younger set
brought up on NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and FRIDAY THE 13TH.  The new
Godzilla has sharper teeth with four canines regularly spaced on
each side.  His back fins are more jagged, sharp, and vicious-
looking.  It looks like they crossed the traditional Godzilla with a
punk rocker.</P>
<P>     Toho Studios from the beginning did excellent work with labor-
intensive special effects.  But not every effects problem could be
solved with inexpensive labor.  Visually their films were always
very nice, but their special effects were not always very
convincing.  As time went by their visual effects got better.  This
film really represents a big jump in the quality of their effects.
There are many very nice images.  And what attracts people to a
Godzilla film has got to be the visuals.  It certainly is not the
writing.  Toho films can usually be counted on for nicely composed
scenes with good use of color.  Where possible in the new film
Godzilla is shown from a low angle to accentuate the height.  A low
angle camera was used in the first film and then abandoned for most
of the first series.  It was used sparingly in the second series.
Here again the camera creates an illusion of great size by shooting
upward, in fact he looks larger than he ever has before.  Several
new compositions of shots give this film a look that is unique for
the series.  For those who like to just stare in awe of the size the
mega-saurian, this is the film.</P>
<P>     The writing however, is not the best of the series and has some
strange touches.  There are some half-hearted attempts at humor that
seem thrown in as an after-thought.  There is one short sequence of
slapstick comedy, in this case almost literally slapstick, and it
seems like it belonged in another movie.  There are some allusions
to JURASSIC PARK, DR. STRANGELOVE, and perhaps a few other films.
(By the way, the film scene someone is watching on TV when we can
hear only the dialog is Morris Ankrum being interrogated by aliens
in EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS.  I wonder what film was used in the
Japanese-language version.)  I have never been quite able to make
out if the writing in these films is out of kilter or if it just
works better in Japanese.  But the final scene, like the writing in
several of the situations, just does not work.  It almost seems to
be rooting for Godzilla as he destroys Tokyo.</P>
<P>     The musical score by Takayuki Hattori is a little too polished
and Western for a Godzilla film.  Godzilla films usually have
Japanese military marches and brash brassy music.  Much of that feel
is missing here.  The film is released by Tristar who hopefully have
learned to leave Godzilla films to the experts after their own
attempt to make a Godzilla film ended up with something of a
monstrosity.  (Though rumor has it that their own attempt to make a
Godzilla film failed in large part because of constraints placed on
them by Toho executives.)</P>
<P>     Even for Godzilla fans, this could have been a better film.  It
is only mid-range in the quality of films in the second series.
Still as he approaches fifty years old, it is good to know the big
guy still looks good on the silver screen and in some ways better
than ever before.  I rate this GODZILLA 2000 a 6 on the 0 to 10
scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  It will be interesting
to see if its sequels will get an American theatrical release.</P>
