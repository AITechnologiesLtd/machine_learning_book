<PRE>                             GROSSE POINTE BLANK
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     John Cusack returns to film after a string of disappointments (CITY
HALL, MONEY FOR NOTHING) with... yet another disappointment!  GROSSE
POINTE BLANK is full of possibilities (a great hook, a sharp cast, and a
wry cynicism that is shamefully lacking from film these days) but comes
up short on all sides.  As Martin Blank, Cusack had the chance to
portray a hitman coming to terms with his own mortality on the eve of
his high school reunion.  And while he performs with characteristic
charm and sly sarcasm, as do his compatriots (including Joan Cusack,
Jeremy Piven, and the object of his affection Minnie Driver), it's the
blown opportunities for hit-it-home funniness that really make the whole
experience somewhat lackluster.  Apart from that, GROSSE POINTE BLANK is
really a poorly made movie on a technical level.  Editing,
cinematography, and continuity are all just plain bad, and together they
give the impression of an amateurish rush job, despite the fact that the
film is already dated (taking place in 1996).  Let's hope Romy and
Michele have more to offer next week....</P>
