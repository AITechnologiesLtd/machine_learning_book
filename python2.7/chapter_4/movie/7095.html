<P>     BROKEN ENGLISH deals with clashing cultures in New Zealand, "the 
bottom of the world."  There's an energy in this film, the first from 
director Gregor Nicholas, that demands to be noticed, but it's not 
enough to overcome the weaknesses of a predictably shallow, derivative 
script.  The only new ingredient in BROKEN ENGLISH's approach to racial 
intolerance and strife is that the tension is between immigrant 
Croatians and native Maoris.  The basic story, however, is familiar, and 
the characters aren't sufficiently well-developed to captivate an 
audience.</P>
<P>     A secondary aspect of BROKEN ENGLISH addresses a father's obsessive 
need to control the lives of his children.  Like SHINE's Peter Helfgott, 
Ivan (Rade Serbedzija) is determined to keep his family together at all 
costs, and is willing to use violence to thwart any non-Croatian who 
shows an interest in either of his daughters.  However, where Armin 
Mueller-Stahl was able to fashion a multi-dimensional portrait of a torn 
man, Ivan is a distressingly flat villain.  Early in the film, there are 
shades to his personality, but, as the story progresses, he becomes 
progressively more of a one-note character, and any grudging sympathy we 
might have for him is destroyed by the time we reach the overly 
melodramatic climax.</P>
<P>     The premise is not inherently unpromising, despite (or perhaps 
because of) certain similarities to that of ONCE WERE WARRIORS.  
Accompanied by his immediate family, Ivan has fled the battlefield of 
his native country, Croatia, to settle in Auckland.   There, he earns 
his living by growing and distributing marijuana.  His youngest 
daughter, Nina (Aleksandra Vujcic), falls in love with Eddie (Julian 
Arahanga), a Maori cook who works at the restaurant where she's a 
waitress.  Eventually, Nina moves away from home, but Ivan's disapproval 
of Eddie isn't the only reason.  In order to help a Chinese friend gain 
residency status, Nina (who is a citizen of New Zealand because her 
mother was born there) agrees to a marriage in name only.  Ultimately, 
Nina wants to integrate all aspects of her life into one cohesive whole, 
but her attempts to reconcile with Ivan lead to violence and grief.</P>
<P>     Nicholas doesn't offer anything revolutionary in his approach to 
warring cultures, and the story of two lovers defying tradition and 
family wishes is older than ROMEO AND JULIET.  In fact, the basic themes 
and framework of BROKEN ENGLISH have been explored more effectively in 
films like MISSISSIPPI MASALA and DOUBLE HAPPINESS.  Racial purity and 
isolation are the issues here.  Wanting his grandchildren to be full-
blooded Croatians,  Ivan despises the idea of interracial breeding.  
This is the kind of narrow-minded bigotry that begins race wars and 
leads to attempted genocides.</P>
<P>     The main actors turn in solid performances.  Veteran Rade 
Serbedzija, best-known to American audiences from BEFORE THE RAIN, is 
terrific at portraying rage, but somewhat less successful at conveying 
pain and loss.  The sensual Aleksandra Vujcic is surprisingly effective 
for a non-professional in her first role.  Julian Arahanga smolders as 
Eddie, and while he and Vujcic don't have perfect chemistry, they steam 
up the screen during one particularly hot sex scene.  Some of the 
supporting players (Marton Csokas, as Nina's brother, in particular) 
aren't impressive.  Temuera Morrison (the male lead from ONCE WERE 
WARRIORS) has a small part as Eddie's brother.</P>
<P>     BROKEN ENGLISH -- the title refers to the common language that 
immigrants must speak in order to communicate -- was filmed with a great 
deal of energy and color.  As absurd as the climax is, it's still 
peculiarly compelling, if only because there's so much raw violence and 
hatred percolating on-screen.  Unfortunately, the characters don't hold 
the same fascination as the visual and visceral elements, and, as a 
result, the trappings of BROKEN ENGLISH are almost more interesting than 
the actual story.  So, instead of being an equal to ONCE WERE WARRIORS, 
BROKEN ENGLISH is a faint, fleeting shadow.  </P>
