<PRE>Review:        The Governess</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Minnie Driver, TomWilkinson</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>Minnie Driver turns in another superb performance as the title character
in The Governess.  She portrays a Jewess in Victorian London who dreams of
love but, following the murder of her beloved father, she finds herself
"promised" as a wife.   Rather than marry this unwanted husband, she
places an ad in the newspaper looking for   employment.  In order to
accept a job as governess she pretends to be a gentile named Mary
Blackchurch.
At her new residence in Scotland she learns that the father of her charge
is a man of dreams who is working on a form of early photography.  It is
this quest that forms the major storyline.  Tom Wilkinson, who will be
remembered as the older member of the Full Monty troupe, portrays the
father.
In an opening scene, when a London prostitute bears her breast, you know
that there will be nudity in the film.  But, this is a true case of
artistic nudity, including full frontal nudity.  
The most memorable thing about the film, and there are many, is the
fantastic art direction.  That, combined with exquisite cinematography,
creates artistic portraits that become etched in your mind.  The wardrobe
is strikingly different, but totally fitting with the period.
There is something about this film that reminded me of "The Heiress" with
Olivia deHaviland. And, I think that you will find that there will be a
disagreement with your friends as to whether it is a happy or a sad
ending.  It's all in how you look at it.
This is an Art film in more ways than one, but it is also an excellent
study in life, religion, and love.  I hope that people recognize it for
what it is.  I will probably see it again.  I give it an B  because it did
move slowly in a couple of places.</P>
