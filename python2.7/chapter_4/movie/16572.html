<P>I don't like the concept of theatrical trailers:  they give the
audience unrealistic expectations.  More importantly, though, they tend
to mislead viewers.  This is the case with Payback, an intensely violent
and sarcastic film about a man who just isn't nice at all.  The previews
make Payback look like a piece of cynical fluff, in which Mel Gibson
struts around casting one-liners at his leisure, and occasionally
shooting bad guys in a goofy and trivial way.  The previews may get
people in the theater, but at least ten people at my screening left long
before the credits rolled.  So, consider my warning:  Payback is not a
lighthearted Friday night at the movies.  </P>
<P>With that said, I can admit that Payback is not a bad movie.  True, it
is very dark -- director/co-writer Brian Helgeland clearly has an
aversion to overhead lighting.  And it's often ridiculously violent;
aside from a several sadomasochistic sex segments, we get to see
numerous people undergo violent deaths from multiple angles.  And Mel
Gibson gets his feet crushed by a psycho with a framing hammer.  It's
never a pleasant film:  the characters are more reprehensible than
likable, and most of them enjoy inflicting pain on others.  There are
some funny parts, but it's not a funny film on the whole.  Payback is
well-made, but it left me feeling pretty drab.  </P>
<P>The film is based on a novel called The Hunter, which spawned the 1967
film Point Blank.  In Payback, Gibson plays a crook named Porter (don't
ask about his first name).  The film opens with Porter lying unconscious
on a table, as someone removes a couple of bullets from his back with a
pair of pliers.  "Not many people know what their life's worth," he says
in a voice-over.  "I do.  Seventy grand.  That's what they took from me,
and that's what I'm gonna get back."  That statement basically sums up
the entire film:  Porter does everything he can (and with as much
indifference as possible) to get his money back.</P>
<P>There are a lot of colorful characters we get to meet along the way;
the first one is Porter's wife (Deborah Kara Unger), a heroin addict. 
In a flashback, we learn that she betrayed her husband with the help of
a slimeball named Val (Gregg Henry).  In present time, Porter's main
target is Val, but when he learns that the money Val stole went to a
crime syndicate, Porter must travel higher up the ladder, and eventually
deal with the head guy (Kris Kristofferson).  Porter's love interest is
a prostitute (Maria Bello) with whom he has a seedy past.  Other actors
featured in prominent roles are James Coburn (as one of the many crime
bosses) and David Paymer (as a low-life associating with a couple of
crooked cops).</P>
<P>The rules you can use in detecting the fate of a character are as
follows:  1)  if female, she's a hooker or a drug addict, and will
usually end up beaten severely; 2) if male, he's a crime lord or a drug
dealer who will eventually betray Porter (if he hasn't already) and get
shot multiple times or blown to pieces with lots of explosives.  It's
not meant to be pleasant; it is, after all, a crime thriller about bad
people.  But when your "good" guy is the meanest of a group of really
mean dudes, you need to find his one good trait and exploit it.  That's
the main problem with Payback:  I was never given much of a reason to
like Porter.</P>
<P>The problem isn't in Gibson's performance; in fact, he's really quite
good, and plays the character stone-faced and without a glimpse of
sympathy.  He's a burn-out of the worst kind -- the kind who places no
value on human life.  The subplot with his girlfriend is clearly
intended to make him a little more human; Bello is effective in the
female role, but the relationship never really develops and therefore
doesn't resonate the way it needs to.  It's not that Porter is a
loathsome guy:  there are times when he'll win you over.  It's just the
rest of the time, when he simply shoots people because they're standing
in his way, when you'll think twice about really sympathizing with him
and his financial issues.</P>
<P>The preview does promise comedy, and I'll admit that there are a few
scenes that had me exploding with laughter.  One scene, near the
beginning, has Porter staring into a mirror, practicing his smile so he
can fit in with the rest of the human race.  The scene in which Porter
confronts Mr. Fairfax (the Coburn character) is truly hilarious,
especially when Fairfax finds out that Porter just wants $70,000. 
"Hell, my suits cost more than that!" he shouts as Porter makes his way
out.  There's a superb running joke that Porter keeps having to correct
people about the amount of money he wants (everyone thinks it's
$130,000).  And then there's the S&M subplot, featuring a surly Asian
prostitute (Lucy Alexis Liu) that is both hilarious and brutal.  </P>
<P>But when you're not laughing, you'll probably just be cringing from all
the violence the characters endure.  I read that the test screenings had
people saying the film was too dark, and that Helgeland walked away from
the project when the studio ordered that some scenes be re-shot.  I
can't imagine the picture being more dark than it is, but I suppose it's
also possible that Helgeland's original cut made Porter a more likable
guy.  And even though the theatrical trailers make the film look like an
exercise in action-comedy, the final version isn't a complete failure --
it has most of the right elements, and Helgeland does a great job with
style and tone.  But in a movie where the hero is more terrifying than
the bad guys, there better be a darn good reason to like him.  I gave up
trying about half way through.</P>
