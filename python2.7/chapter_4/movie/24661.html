<PRE>_The_Basket_ (PG) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Clean, proper, and brimming with good intentions, _The_Basket_ is one of
those films that people say "aren't made anymore."  That comment is only
partially true.  Films like _The_Basket_ indeed aren't made anymore--for
the big screen, at least, for this type of maudlin, medicinal family film
is a dime a dozen on the tube, where it belongs.</P>
<P>The title _The_Basket_ has a number of meanings.  First, it is the title
of a (fictional) German opera that newly-arrived schoolteacher Martin
Conlon (Peter Coyote) presents to his students in a small Washington
town, circa 1918.  The opera's twisting, mystical story soon captures the
imaginations of everyone in town, its plot developments being discussed
and dissected much like those of a modern day soap.  Second, it is a
reference to the other new thing that Conlon brings to the youth: the
game of basketball.</P>
<P>The round ball especially captures the interest of young Helmut Brink
(Robert Karl Burke).  Helmut and his older sister Brigitte (Amber
Willenborg) are orphaned German refugees, and with WWI raging--and one of
the local boys having returned from the warfront severely injured--the
two face prejudice from all around.  The anti-German sentiment also
extends to Conlon for teaching a work originating from America's enemy.
That already is enough plot for a feature film, but like an overstuffed
afterschool special that wants to be all things, _The_Basket_ doesn't
know where to quit.  Writers Rich Cowan (who also directed), Don Caron,
Frank Swoboda, and Tessa Swoboda throw in a "forbidden romance" between
Brigitte and a brother of the injured soldier, an intrigue subplot
involving Conlon's down-low dealings with shady characters, and a "big
game" sequence where Helmut gets his shot at hoops glory.  The obvious
intent is to give each character on the large canvas a chance to shine,
but the individual elements are undercooked on their own terms, yielding
less-than-satisfying payoffs.</P>
<P>The performances also don't feel quite formed.  Coyote is likable but
hampered by a strange accent.  Less strange but more distracting are the
German accents of Burke and Willenborg, which are just as awkward as
their overall performances.  Karen Allen, as the mother of the soldier,
makes the most significant impression, but her role is only a few lines
away from being a mere walk-on.</P>
<P>There's no denying that _The_Basket_ will foster warm feelings in its
audience; it's a nice film that addresses worthy subjects and does so in
a manner accessible to the entire family.  But in a time where "nice" is
often equated with "boring," the undistinctive, earnestly good-for-you
_The_Basket_ does nothing to alter that perception.</P>
