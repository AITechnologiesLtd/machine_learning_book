<P>_Central_Station_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>By all outward appearances, this Brazilian drama is a standard road
movie--and to a certain extent, it is.  Central Station in Rio is what
brings together the film's unlikely traveling duo: Dora (Fernanda
Montenegro), former schoolteacher, now letter-writer; and Josue (Vinicius
de Olveira), an orphaned 10-year-old boy, whose mother was one of the
Dora's customers before her untimely death.  The two set off on a rough
journey across the country to find Josue's long-lost father.</P>
<P>_Central_Station_'s travellers follow the beaten cinematic path, but the
film is made unusually compelling by the lead characters.  This is because
they are so recognizably human; neither Dora nor Josue are the most likable
of characters.  Dora is, at times, unbearably bitter; Josue is often
unnecessarily cruel to his de facto guardian, often ridiculing her haggard
appearance.  What keeps the audience involved in the plight of this prickly
pair are the actors.  de Olveira, a shoeshine boy who was discovered by
director Walter Salles after the boy asked him for change, is a remarkable
find, exuding the right balance of toughness and vulnerability.  The same
can be said, but to a greater degree, about Montenegro (who has been named
Best Actress of the year by both the National Board of Review and the Los
Angeles Film Critics Association); she rightfully sees Dora's bitter anger
as less a weariness with the world than with herself, a desperate,
self-destructive mechanism to keep the world even more distant than it
already is.  The nuances of Montenegro's work--and the film--are too subtle
to notice along the way, but by the film's poignant yet understated
conclusion, they are powerfully felt.</P>
