<P>     In 1992, Harvey Keitel took the title role in Abel Ferrara's BAD 
LIEUTENANT.  In CLOCKERS, three years later and once again again on the 
streets of New York City (Brooklyn, to be specific), he gets a chance to 
"redeem" himself.  This time, however, he's a good cop--not an icon of 
moral uprightness, but a man who sees the potential buried beneath all 
that is sordid, and who uses his position as an upholder of the law to 
dispense justice. </P>
<P>     Yet, despite his top billing, this is not primarily Keitel's story.  
Instead, the bulk of CLOCKERS focuses on young Ronald "Strike" Dunham, 
played with impressive intensity by newcomer Mekhi Phifer.  Uneducated-
but-streetwise, Strike is a low-level drug-dealer (a "clocker") and 
possibly a murderer.  His life revolves around a few simple truths:  his 
friendship with his father-figure mentor, Rodney (Delroy Lindo), the 
support he offers to his own young protege (Pee Wee Love), and his 
prized model train collection.  Strike follows Rodney's code:  don't 
snitch on your friends, pay off the cops to keep them happy, and never 
sample the drugs you deal.   </P>
<P>     The walls of Strike's life begin to crumble when Rodney asks him to 
eliminate a "problem."  Hours later, the night manager of Ahab's fast 
food is dead, shot four times, and Strike's brother Victor (Isaiah 
Washington) has confessed to the murder, even though he can't give a 
coherent account of what happened and no one on the streets thinks he 
did it.  It's up to Detective Rocco Klein (Keitel) and his partner (John 
Turturro) to uncover the truth, and the deeper they dig, the more they 
become convinced that Strike, not his brother, is guilty. </P>
<P>     The script, written by Richard Price and Spike Lee (and based upon 
Price's novel, which was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle 
Award), is less cliched than the average New York-based crime story.  
All of the characters--drug dealers and men in uniform--are given 
enough depth to circumvent stereotypes.  CLOCKERS is about people 
trapped by circumstances, and with all the ambivalent personalities, 
there are no "good guys" or "bad guys" in the traditional sense. </P>
<P>     That's not to say CLOCKERS isn't without problems.  The first hour 
is oddly paced and frequently confusing.  It takes half the movie for 
the characters to become familiar and for all the elements of the plot 
to fall into place.  Some of this may be the result of condensing the 
book while trying to retain as many characters and subplots as possible.  
Ultimately, CLOCKERS probably attempts too much, and ends up seeming 
overcrowded as a result. </P>
<P>     The effectiveness of the unusual style of cinematography is open to 
debate.  All sorts of photographic tricks are employed, from the use of 
hand-held cameras to slightly overexposing the film.  There's a fair 
balance between when these methods work and when they become 
distracting.  Certainly, however, CLOCKERS has a unique visual flair.  
In that, this is pure Spike Lee.   </P>
<P>     Although racism is only a subtle part of CLOCKERS, the movie 
nevertheless has a strong anti-racist theme.  This is most eloquently 
expressed when Rocco offers no verbal response to a key question:  Why 
would a white cop care about justice in a case of a black-on-black 
murder?  While some of CLOCKERS' characters may not understand this, the 
viewer does, and that's why Keitel's role, although tangential to the 
primary story, is crucial to the film's success.  Productions like BOYZ 
'N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY deliver their final blow through 
bloodshed.  While Lee doesn't shy away from violence, his methods are 
less straightforward.  Like 1994's FRESH, CLOCKERS uses unexpected 
narrative turns to accentuate the themes of lost innocence and 
uncultivated potential, and affirms that tragic melodrama is not a 
prerequisite for emotional impact. </P>
