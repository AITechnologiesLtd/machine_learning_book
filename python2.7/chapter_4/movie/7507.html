<PRE>                                    BREAKDOWN
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>Well...I must admit this movie definately lived up to my expectations,
but in a deferent way that I had hoped...</P>
<P>The movie begins with Kirk Russel and his wife Katholan Quinlan as
"rich" Bostonites trying to make a fresh start in California.
Mysteriously, theit car breaks down and they are left at the side of the
road.  A man it an 18-wheeler comes by and offeres a ride into town.
Kirk is skeptical but lets his wife go while he stays behind.
Eventually he fiqures out what was wrong and goes about finding his
wife.</P>
<P>Hmm...this is where the action stops and it's my duty to stop telling
you plot details....</P>
<P>This movie (as I said) did live up to my expectations.  It showed the
length that a man would go to save his wife.  But so much of the movie
involves him getting revenge that I think the movie loses a little
focus.  Thats not that big of a deal.  I just think that if not for that
the movie could have been better (although at already was great).</P>
