<P>American Beauty is a sitcom on the surface, but a remarkable social 
commentary laced with dark humor and thorough character development can 
be found just below. Kevin Spacey gives a performance, in what may be 
one of the great films of our time, that will surely garner him an 
Academy Award nomination.</P>
<P>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) lives an every-man life filled with 
misery. "Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser" he 
quips. His boss is about to give him the axe. His marriage to Carolyn 
(Annette Bening), a real estate agent, is just for show. His daughter, 
Jane (Thora Birch) is experiencing more that just the typical teenage 
resentment of her father, as she rightfully points out to him "You've 
barely even spoken to me for months."</P>
<P>Lester's answer is to make a drastic change in his lifestyle. He 
blackmails his boss out of nearly $60,000, buys the car that he has 
always wanted, develops a secret crush on his daughter's best friend, 
starts smoking dope, and gets a job that he truly enjoys: flipping 
burgers at a fast food restaurant.</P>
<P>Before long, Jane takes a liking to her new neighbor and classmate, 
Ricky (Wes Bentley), whose quiet and deeply observant habits test the 
attention span of Angela Hayes, Jane's best friend. As Jane and Ricky 
develop into a couple, Angela fades away into a world of infinite 
loneliness.</P>
<P>The role of Lester Burnham is an extraordinarily tough one. It exhibits 
feelings of pedophilia, obsession, and carelessness; just to name a few. 
Kevin Spacey does it all, thus creating a believable character and 
delivering an amazing performance that is one of the finest in memory. 
Annette Bening and the rest of the cast all do a sound job and play 
their parts credibly.</P>
<P>The title of the film is equally as thought provoking as its subjects. 
Is "American Beauty" a reference to the rose garden which Carolyn 
cherishes? Could it be Angela Hayes, the blond haired and blue eyed 
cheerleader that lives in constant fear or being ordinary? Most likely 
it is a reference to what director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball are 
trying to show is the impossible dream.</P>
<P>Two types of people will see this movie. One will see it as a humorous, 
out-of-the-ordinary sitcom. For them it is entertainment worth the price 
of admission. The other group will not only see those qualities, but the 
deep symbolic themes that lie between the lines. For them the two-hours 
will be priceless.</P>
