<P>     With a mostly female cast and a poetic title, it might be easy to 
assume that PARADISE ROAD is a 1997 version of Mike Newell's 
effervescent ENCHANTED APRIL.  However, apart from those stated 
similarities, there's little to connect the two films.  ENCHANTED APRIL 
brought the audience on a vacation along with a group of women.  
PARADISE ROAD takes us to a World War II concentration camp for Dutch 
and English-speaking women.  </P>
<P>     Most concentration camp stories are set in World War II's European 
theater, and deal with Hitler's attempted genocide of the Jewish race.  
PARADISE ROAD shifts the focus to the lesser-known, but no less 
inhumane, conditions in the Pacific.  Based on the memoirs of survivors, 
this movie peels away one more layer of the atrocities associated with 
the second World War.  Here, however, it's the Japanese, not the Nazis, 
who are the enemy.  And the means that the prisoners devise to lift 
their spirits are, to say the least, unique.  Yet, even though PARADISE 
ROAD is ultimately about the triumph over adversity, the script never 
forgets that for everyone who overcomes seemingly-impossible obstacles, 
there are many who stumble along the way, never to rise again.  PARADISE 
ROAD offers balance by not forgetting these victims.</P>
<P>     The film opens in February of 1942 on a night of dining and dancing 
at Singapore's Raffles Hotel.  It's a gala ball for soldiers stationed 
in the Pacific and their wives (or girlfriends).  The party breaks up 
when it's announced that the Japanese advance has pushed the Allies back 
and the city is about to fall.  While the men return to their units, the 
women evacuate, cramming aboard the "Prince Albert" for the boat trip 
back to Australia.  They are a mixed bunch of Australians, English, and 
Americans, and petty quarrels break out in the close quarters.  But 
these differences are all forgotten when Japanese planes attack and sink 
the ship.  The waterlogged and weary survivors come ashore on the 
Japanese-occupied island of Sumatra, where they are rounded up and 
thrown into a concentration camp.  There, over the course of the next 
three and one-half years, they fight to survive and not lose hope.  To 
this end, they form a "vocal orchestra" -- a chorus that astounds 
audiences of fellow prisoners by performing hummed renditions of the 
work of Mozart, Dvorak, and Holst.</P>
<P>     The exceptionally strong cast showcases American, British, and 
Australian actresses, all of whom show an astonishing willingness to 
appear in physically unflattering circumstances (no makeup, hair and 
skin caked with drying mud).  The conductor of the orchestra, Adrienne 
Pargiter, is played with grit and zeal by Glenn Close, and represents 
her best screen work in years.  Pauline Collins (SHIRLEY VALENTINE) is 
Margaret Drummond, a missionary who copies the orchestra's sheet music 
from memory.  Australian unknown Cate Blanchett essays Susan Macarthy, a 
timid nurse who finds her voice (in more ways than one) while in the 
camp.  Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennett in the recent BBC/A&E adaptation 
of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE), with her expressive eyes, is Rosemary Leighton-
Jones, a beautiful young woman who dreams of being reunited with her 
true love.  Frances McDormand, sporting an absurdly distracting accent, 
is the camp doctor.  And Elizabeth Spriggs (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY) 
portrays an old woman who cares more about her dog than herself.</P>
<P>     PARADISE ROAD is less a tearjerker than an honest examination of 
the bonds that are formed during extreme situations.  Although there are 
some heart-wrenching moments, and several scenes of potentially-
disturbing violence, the film never descends to the level of cheap 
melodrama.  Instead, it opts for something deeper and more meaningful by 
allowing us to follow a group of well-rounded characters on a journey 
with a strong spiritual component.  PARADISE ROAD not only pays tribute 
to the human will to live, but it is a testament to music's lasting 
power to heal and uplift. </P>
<P>     Ultimately, PARADISE ROAD isn't as deeply sad or depressing as a 
Holocaust film, for, although several characters do not survive the 
movie, the goal of the Japanese is punishment and humiliation, not 
genocide.  And, while one of PARADISE ROAD's themes is the barbarity of 
war, it manages to present its case without demonizing the Japanese 
(indeed, it goes to great pains to paint a few of them as sympathetic).  
Instead, the film succeeds by humanizing the kinds of survivors who are 
often pictured as wretched, faceless victims.  </P>
<P>     PARADISE ROAD owes its existence to writer/director Bruce 
Beresford, one of the most inconsistent film makers working today.  
Beresford's resume is all over the place, containing such highly-
acclaimed features as TENDER MERCIES and DRIVING MISS DAISY and such 
ruthlessly-panned entries as HER ALIBI and A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA.  With 
PARADISE ROAD, Beresford is once again at the pinnacle of his ability, 
and, with the help of a courageous and superlative cast, he has 
fashioned a powerful coda to the story of the Belalau concentration 
camp's vocal orchestra.</P>
