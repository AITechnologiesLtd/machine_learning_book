<P>When a red curtain opens and an orchestra conductor emerges to "direct"
the unmistakable 20th Century Fox theme music, we know we're in for
something different.  Really different.  Good different.</P>
<P>Filled with virtuoso special effects and spectacular song-and-dance
sequences, Baz Luhrmann's long-awaited Moulin Rouge makes every minute
of our collectively held breath worthwhile.  In fact, during its opening
hour, this critic found it hard to look away even for a second to jot
down a note, for fear of missing even a nuanced sparkle in the eye of
some French whore.</P>
<PRE>But enough about me.</PRE>
<P>Somewhere between a fairy tale and an episode of Sesame Street, sitting
on a strange line between history and fantasy, lies Moulin Rouge, a
vaguely familiar story about a love affair between a penniless writer
and a dying courtesan.  Set in Paris in the year 1900, in and around the
infamous Moulin Rouge -- a brothel/dancehall in the seediest part of
town -- the film quickly tosses us into a whirlwind of a story, windmill
included.</P>
<P>Christian (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Paris, eager to make his mark as a
writer.  No sooner does he begin to type than a band of bohemian poets
and actors literally fall in on him, including the crazed and diminutive
Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, acting on his knees).  Together they
hatch a plot to take a new musical across the street to the Moulin Rouge
in search of a backer for their thrilling new show.</P>
<P>Naturally, before midnight strikes, Christian has fallen in love with
the star of the Rouge, the "Sparking Diamond" Satine (Nicole Kidman),
while her boss, the maniacal Zidler (Jim Broadbent) looks on
disapprovingly.  The man with the money is the Duke of Worcester
(Richard Roxburgh), to whom everyone must suck up.  But it wouldn't be a
movie unless the Duke was also in love with Sabine -- and boy does he
have a mean streak....</P>
<P>Its plot is as old and trite as the most overdone of Greek tragedies,
but the fun of Moulin Rouge is all in its telling.  Far and away the
best part of the movie are the spectacular musical numbers performed by
some very good (not great) singers.  (All the actors did their own voice
work.)  When they simply talk, you'll find yourself drumming your
fingers, hoping the next number will come along soon.  And they always
do -- like a machine gun, some 19 performances appear in rapid
succession.</P>
<P>The songs are all contemporary numbers unknown to 1900's Paris.  While
the use of pop songs in period pieces has actually been a mainstay of
the musical since the 1940's, it's never been taken to the extremes of
Rouge.  A Knight's Tale tried this stunt only a few weeks ago, with
mixed results.  In Moulin Rouge, McGregor belts out "The Sound of Music"
in one scene, Broadbent vamps through "Like a Virgin" (yes, Jim
Broadbent), McGregor and Kidman duet memorably through a host of
love-themed songs while standing atop the elephant in which she lives
(yes, elephant), and the entire cast tangos to a Latin-infused version
of "Roxanne," with Jose Feliciano backing the group.  You won't even
realize Marilyn Manson is covering "Smells Like Teen Spirit."  A
Knight's Tale's "We Will Rock You" comes off as lame in comparison.  Put
simply, Moulin Rouge rocks.</P>
<P>The cast is uniformly superb.  Jim Broadbent appears larger than life
(and he is larger than life to begin with), while John Leguizamo is
astonishingly smaller than life... with a French lisp to boot ("the
Thpawk-leeeng Die-aaay-mon!" -- try it out loud).  Of course, this is
Kidman's and McGregor's movie, and when they're together on screen the
picture shines brighter than ever.  In fact, for their duets, Luhrmann
really cranks things up, laying on the dazzle and pouring his heart into
the movie.  The three of them form a remarkably apt trio.</P>
<P>Still, there's only so much of this anyone can take.  Moulin Rouge is a
movie that wears down the audience and its cast.  While it starts off as
an unmitigated five-star extravaganza, it eventually flags into mere
four-star territory as the film becomes repetitious and a bit slow
(heresy!).  Still, it's one of the best films of the year to date,
following Memento is the only award-caliber film released so far in
2001.</P>
<P>But forget all of that.  What you will have witnessed after seeing
Moulin Rouge is nothing short of the rebirth of the movie musical.  It
will certainly be a love-it-or-hate-it experience for moviegoers -- but
like they say, if you don't get it, you're just too old.  Way too old.</P>
<PRE>Dead, probably.</PRE>
