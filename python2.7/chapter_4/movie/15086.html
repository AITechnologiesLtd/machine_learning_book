<P>   Those who can, play. Those who can't, manage.  Those
who can't manage, become assistant managers.  In high
schools around the country, kids who want to be part of their
sports teams but just can't cut it become managers, often the
butt of jokes by members of the team and by fellow students
alike.  They're called everything from waterboy to stuff that's
unprintable in a family review.  But vengeance is theirs in
Frank Coraci's film, "The Waterboy," about a nerdy guy who
proves that he can hew wood, draw water, and throw a mean
tackle all at the same time.  The difference here is that the
waterboy is not a high-school kid but a 31-year-old who
appears mentally challenged but who, in reality, has been
kept out of school and away from girls by a backwater mama
who is afraid of being deserted by her little boy as she was
by her husband some time back.</P>
<P>   How good can a movie be if it centers on a waterboy? 
Well, maybe you've heard the statement that critics like to
throw around, "This movie is not resonant enough to be taken
seriously and not stupid enough to be funny."  No problem. 
This one really IS moronic enough to be entertaining and
could inspire the fabulously successfully IDT publications to
put out a "Dummies' Guide to Football."  Nope, it probably
would better meet the standard for "The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Football."  While lots of films have been dumbed
down so that the lowest common denominator among
moviegoers can enjoy (witness, for example, "A Night at the
Roxbury"), the folks who put this one out could not possibly
have THAT low an estimate of the audience, so we've got to
assume--in the words of its star, Adam Sandler, that "We're
just having fun and I hope everyone has fun right along with
us."  As one critic has said about the movie, "If you like the
Chris Farley stuff, and if you're one of Adam Sandler's
regular fan club, you'll have a rollicking good time.  If not,
stay away."</P>
<P>   While the talented Mr. Sandler had a more intelligent role
in "The Wedding Singer," this time he goes all out to be
Thoreauvian, paring away all the complexities of life and
becoming as simple as a human body can get.  As the
eponymous waterboy, Bobby Boucher, he speaks with a
stutter and is the perfect student of his backwater mother's
(Kathy Bates) homilies.  He has never been with another
woman, has no friends because (his mom insists) "he doesn't
have social graces" and gets his fulfillment by taking the job
of waterboy seriously enough to sterilize the H20 and to
check it repeatedly for Ph content.  His concern is not
appreciated by the jocks he serves on a college football
team.  They spit in the water at best, and at worst take turns
tackling him amid a flurry of insults, turning over the table on
which he so carefully tends to his product.  </P>
<P>   One day, infuriated by yet another affront to his dignity cast
at him by a member of the team, he dashes into the field
tackling the offender so viciously that Coach Klein (Henry
Winkler) puts him into a game, counsels him to visualize
people who have humiliated him in the past, and turns him
loose against some of the most brawny contenders south of
the Mason-Dixon line.  It's the sort of feel-good movie in
which games are won in the final seconds and women swoon
over their sportsman-heroes--in this case, the sexy, criminally
inclined Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk) pushes her man to
victory with a promise to introduce the 31-year-old to the
mysterious of love.</P>
<P>   Directed conventionally by Frank Coraci, the screenplay by
Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler has fun at the expense of the
deep south, portraying the Louisiana Bayou country as a
hillbilly heaven of snake-eaters and of folks with accents that
not even a southerner could understand.  Great fun is had at
the expense of Farmer Fran (Blake Clark), who cannot utter a
single understandable word and Mama Boucher (Kathy
Bates) as a grasping, lonely woman who covers up her
insecurities behind falsely fundamentalist religious
convictions.  Insisting that football (which she pronounces
"foosball") is just plain silly and out of bounds for her boy and
that Vicki Vallencourt is the Devil (she's on safer grounds
there), she keeps Bobby locked into arrested development for
her own selfish ends.  </P>
<P>   Henry Winkler turns in the best performance as the coach
who is afraid of the other team's trainer until Bobby imparts to
him the safe advice he received: to visualize the man you
fear as though he were a baby, a cocker spaniel, or a guy
who has mortified you in the past.  It's a toned-down
discharge of a role that the Fonz would have played as low
comedy back in the seventies.  Ms. Balk plays to type as the
low-life girl friend much as she was in the quite different film,
"American History X" in a movie whose quality is, well, as we
said, dependent on what you think of the Adam Sandler
genre.</P>
