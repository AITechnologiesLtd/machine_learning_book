<P>Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood For Love is kind of like the Harrison
Ford/Kristin Scott Thomas debacle Random Hearts, except there isn't a
plane crash and it's not nearly as sucky. The film is about two married
neighbors who forge a relationship and then learn their respective
spouses have been having an affair. In the Mood, which snagged the
Technical Grand Prize and Best Actor trophies at Cannes, as well as the
prestigious Five Award from the European equivalent of the Oscars, is
intricately paced and was largely improvised by Wong (Happy Together)
and his actors on the set.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1962, where fate brings two strangers together in a
cramped Hong Kong apartment building. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung, Happy
Together) is a newspaper editor who dreams of writing pulpy martial arts
serials, and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung, Chinese Box) is the assistant to
an executive of a large shipping company. The two characters meet when
they rent rooms from families who just happen to live next door to each
other.</P>
<P>Su's husband frequently travels to Japan for business, accompanied by
Chow's wife, who tells her husband she's working late, or spending time
with her sick mother. But neither Chow nor Su have a clue their partners
are being disloyal - that is, until they begin to develop their own
relationship. It begins with a glance as they cross paths both in the
tiny hallway leading to their apartments and on a dark stairway leading
to a noodle cart where the characters get lunch. It isn't until their
romance blossoms that Chow and Su learn of the irony of the relationship
shared by their spouses.</P>
<P>Their resolution to the situation is simultaneously anguished and
exquisite. The fact that these two characters are so likeable, coupled
with Wong's decision to never show them sharing a physical moment (he
shot a sex scene, but wisely left it on the cutting room floor) makes
the outcome of In the Mood as heartbreaking as anything you'll see on
the screen this year. Wong keeps thing subtly erotic by occasionally
having Chow and Su's hands brush together as they pass, trying to avoid
raising suspicion from their nosy, gossiping landlords, who have epic
Mahjong tournaments that last for days at a time.</P>
<P>Chow and Su's adulterous spouses are barely in the film, and when they
are, Wong opts to keep these characters hidden from viewers through
careful location of his camera. In fact, the writer/director gives In
the Mood more of a voyeuristic, fly-on-the-wall feel than any
reality-based television programming. Like Steven Soderbergh, Wong often
blocks off part of his shots with a door jam or some other inanimate
object, which, in addition to placing his camera at just the right angle
in a hallway or doorway, gives the film a cramped, cluttered look that
ads to the claustrophobic feeling that the two main characters must also
share. Actingwise, Leung and Cheung have never been better.</P>
<P>In the Mood is one of the most beautiful films I've ever had the
pleasure of seeing. Wong's previous pictures have all been gorgeous in
their own way, but never as elegant as here. His city is so dark and so
moody (hence the title), you'll think the sun has never risen in Hong
Kong. Wong's right-hand men - cinematographer Christopher Doyle (Liberty
Heights) and editor and costume/production designer William Chang, do an
unbelievably incredible job at making the film seem like the most
colorful, romantic dream you've ever had. If the shots of Cheung
gracefully swishing her lavish silk dresses through various surroundings
don't hypnotize you, then the repetitive use of a Spanish version of a
Nat King Cole song (and other period pop songs from the West) will be
sure to do the trick.</P>
<P>1:38 – PG for thematic elements and brief language</P>
