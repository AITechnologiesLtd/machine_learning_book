<PRE>GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The true test of a film is time. If a film can hold up through the passing
of years, then as more years pass the more great the film becomes.
Ghostbusters has stood the test of time. Producing a sequel and a cartoon
series.</P>
<P>Ghostbusters is about three offbeat scientists, Peter Venkman (Bill
Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), who
have just lost their university grant and are out on the street. What do
they do now? They pursue an idea that they can catch ghosts and retain them.</P>
<P>The movie follows the three and also Sigourney Weaver's character, Dana
Barrett. Woven in the movie are three plots. The main plot of the film is
the Ghostbusters trying to figure out why there are so many ghosts lately
in New York. The two subplots are the love story between Venkman and
Barrett. And the evil EPA man (William Antherton) trying to shutdown the
Ghostbusters.</P>
<P>The real joy of The Ghostbusters is the comic interaction between the three
(and later four) Ghostbusters. The well-written script by Dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis gives each character a distinct, sharp, and intelligent
personality. The other joy of the film is the incredible special effect by
Richard Edlund. Even now, over a decade since its release, the special
effects are impressive.</P>
<P>All actors give great performances. Bill Murray as Dr. Venkman is probably
my most favorite of the four Ghostbusters. Like always, Murray is off the
deep end in his performance, sometimes his performance seems almost
adlibbed. Dan Aykroyd gets one of his best and most memorable roles as Dr.
Stanz. His character is giddy and naive, which makes him very likeable.
Harold Ramis gives a performance that turns Dr. Spangler into the unlike
looking nerd. Ernie Hudson is not given enough time on screen, and I think
his character could have gotten more, his character brought the layman into
the Ghostbusters group. Sigourney Weaver does well in her role, but it is
her neighbor Louis Tully, played by Rick Moranis who does better. His nerd
accounting character is wonderfully funny and provides for a lot of laughs.</P>
<P>If you haven't seen The Ghostbusters, I highly recommend this film. Even if
you've seen it awhile ago, see it again. Director Ivan Reitman and
cinematographer László Kovács uses the width of the movie screen to its
fullest, often framing a shot from end to end. Watching The Ghostbusters in
Pan and Scan format takes away from the film. Definitely catch The
Ghostbusters in widescreen format, or you'll be missing out on a lot.
(Criterion offers The Ghostbusters in widescreen format on laserdisc). This
is a don't miss film.</P>
