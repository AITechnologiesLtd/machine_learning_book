<PRE>                                 RECKLESS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Even a fairy tale about Christmas has to have some continuity,
some explanation of the whats and whys of the story.  RECKLESS does not
seem to have any of that.</P>
<P>     The film opens Christmas Eve with Rachel (Mia Farrow) lying in bed
with her husband Tom (Tony Goldwyn), snuggling up to him and chattering
happily away.  Not being able to understand one word of what she was
saying I assumed it was the fault of the screening room's sound or I
had gone deaf. Luckily the explanation came soon when Tom tells Rachel
that he can no longer stand her giggling babbling and had put out a
contract on her to have her killed.  After the confession, he also
tells her that he took out a $100,000 insurance policy on her life.
That is the end of the understandable part of the film; the rest is a
hodgepodge that is the fault of the director, the screen writer and/or
the editor.  (Norman Ren, Craig Lucas, and Michael Berenbaum,
respectively.)</P>
<P>     Outside the house, the snow is piled high but when she opens the
window and climbs onto the sill, her husband gently but firmly shuts
the window on her so that she goes sliding down the snow-covered roof
and onto the ground ... unhurt, of course.  This is, after all, a
fairy tale.</P>
<P>     Later she is in a phone booth when she is approached by a Lloyd,
(Scott Glenn) who takes her to his home where she meets his wife, Pooty
(Mary-Louise Parker) who is in a wheel chair as she is a paraplegic
who, for good measure, is also a deaf mute.  That she talks and hears,
a bit later in the film, was not explained ... at least, not to me.</P>
<P>     One weird incident follows another without any rhyme or reason
that I could ascertain.  The press kit mentions Candide but Voltaire
would have a lot to say about that.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast includes Eileen Brennan, Giancarlo Esposito
and Stephen Dorf.</P>
<P>1 byte (because I am feeling generous.)</P>
<PRE>                        4 Bytes = Superb
                        3 Bytes = Too good to be missed.
                        2 Bytes = So so.
                        1 Byte  = Save your money.</PRE>
