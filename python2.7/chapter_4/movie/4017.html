<PRE>                                  BOMBAY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: While by Western standards this is
          not a great film, it towers above most films made
          for the Indian domestic market.  Western viewers
          who do not know the conventions of Indian domestic
          films may be puzzled by the combination of light
          comedy and serious political content, but will find
          the film rewarding nonetheless.  Rating: low +2 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The vast majority of Indian films are weak exploitation films
intended to entertain mass audiences, and rare is the film made for the
domestic Indian market that looks intelligently at a serious issue.
People in India usually do not go to the movie theater to be edified by
a film with serious meanings.  That is why a film like BOMBAY is so
unusual and is touring international film festivals.  It performs a
balancing act trying to please the entertainment audiences and at the
same time trying to be an indictment of the violence of the 1993
religious riots in Bombay.  Trying to do both, it is not altogether
successful at either.  There are nightmarish depictions of the riots
that presumably will bother the entertainment-oriented audience.
Still, in the examination of its real issues it betrays itself twice,
first in putting the serious themes so late in the film and then in
treating those themes overly simplistically.  To an American audience
it will seem that BOMBAY mixes 1990s violence with a simplified view of
the issues of racial intolerance much like the United States might have
had in the 1950s.  It does not look very deeply at the causes of the
religious differences for fear of appearing to take sides.  Instead, it
limits its message to saying simply that violence is wrong and whatever
the religious differences they are, rioting is not the way to resolve
them.  That is an important statement but not all that profound.
Effectively India has discovered the politically correct film.  One of
the film's reviewers called this India's SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The
comparison applies only if comparing BOMBAY to other Indian films.</P>
<P>     Our story starts like a classic "Romeo and Juliet" plot.  Young
Hindu boy Shekhar Misra (played by Aruind Swami) loves Muslim girl
Shaila Banu (Manisha Koirala).  He knows his family will never approve-
--his father does not like even Northern Hindus, much less Moslems--but
he goes ahead and courts her.  When his family objects too strongly he
flees to Bombay and sends for Banu.  Bombay initially represents the
anonymity and tolerance of a cosmopolitan city.  However, their love
has already caused a feud between the two families and it continues in
their absence.  While the plot takes a comic turn of the newlyweds
unable to find privacy to be together in Bombay, the reluctant
fathers-in-law escalate a feud.  This is all done with a light touch,
but soon the theme of intolerance will be handled more shockingly.  The
city of Bombay is about to be torn apart by riots, and the film will
get a good deal more serious.</P>
<P>     Western critics discussing BOMBAY find it odd that a light comedy
turns into an angry political indictment.  The original film was
probably an even stranger combination.  The version we are seeing is
reportedly cut down from a version in which there were also the
traditional love songs mixed in.  There are some light musical
interludes in what is being shown but not the popular songs that were
probably in the original.  It might be a mistake to attribute the
combination to the originality of writer and director Mani Ratnam.  It
is much more a convention of Indian domestic films that all films are
musicals and comedies.  As an example, KHAL-NAAIKAA, a remake of the
American horror film THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, was very close to
the original except for the seemingly incongruous injection of comedy
and musical sequences into the story.  But in spite of this, what does
come through is often moving, though at times not as subtle as a
Western viewer might like.  At times the action stops as a character
make speeches for tolerance.  But what other critics are finding fresh
and original is, in fact, a cultural difference and almost inevitable
in Indian domestic films.  Incidentally, I noted the credit included a
dance director in spite of the fact that there was no real dance in the
version we saw.</P>
<P>     The camera work for BOMBAY is a little showy.  Several simple
effects are used including slow-motion, scenes rushing past the camera,
and strobe effects as well as subjective hand-held camera shots.</P>
<P>     Also, the film might have been a bit better with a screen or two
at the beginning explaining the basis of the conflict and the name ofa
political group referenced in the film.  This would serve a double
purpose.  It would not only help foreign audiences understand the
conflict, it would also bind the film together by promising that there
will be serious political material coming up.  There certainly was some
question why, for example, the Moslems in the film are so opposed to a
particular temple to Ram being built.  While most of what goes on
becomes clear from context, most Western viewers could do with a few
notes.</P>
<P>     While the basic subject matter is contrived, this is certainly the
best Indian domestic film in years.  Rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
