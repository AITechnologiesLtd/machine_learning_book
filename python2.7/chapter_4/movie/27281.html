PSY (1992)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Until recently, police films were supposed to be in the
exclusive domain of cinematographies belonging to so-called
First World. Ethical dilemmas that make the backbone of
police films work only in environments that are supposed to
have at least basic framework of democracy, rule of law and
human rights. Naturally, East European countries during the
Cold War didn't exactly fit such criteria and in their movie
policemen in such films appeared only as protagonists in
standard crime mysteries. So, we actually had to wait for
the Communism to collapse to see East European films to deal
with the problems that haunt their law enforcement
personnel. One of such films is Polish drama PSY, directed
in 1992 by Wladyslaw Pasikowski. The film was one of the
most popular films in post-Communist Poland, spawning the
sequel made two years later.</P>
<P>PSY is rather unusual police drama because the policemen are
anything by ordinary. The protagonist is Franz Mauer (played
by Boguslaw Linda), former veteran of Communist Secret
Police. In the good old days he and his colleagues used to
live like kings - the regime provided them with numerous
privileges in exchange for their services. But times have
changed and the regime is now made out of people who used to
be Mauer's "clients". As a result, former secret police is
now downsized and filled with people more suitable for new
political masters - Maurer's best friend Olo (played by
Marek Kondrat) is thrown out of the force, while Maurer
himself is demoted to the regular police. Inability of the
old secret policemen to handle new circumstances is revealed
when routine car theft bust turns into bloody shootout in
which most of Maurer's crew die. Maurer decides to find the
responsible and takes help of young and idealistic rookie
Nowy (played by Cezary Paura). The investigation leads to
the well-organised ring of amphetamine smugglers, led by
former secret policeman Gross (played by Janusz Gajdos).
Maurer, being back-pedalled by his inimical and corrupt
superiors, must not only fight this ring alone, but one of
Gross' new recruits is his old friend Olo.</P>
<P>If PSY should be described with one word, that word is
"brutal". That brutality is, of course, most visible in the
large number of extremely violent scenes and naturalistic
quality of said violence which would probably turn off some
more sensitive segments of the audience. But the brutality
doesn't stop at that level - in the eyes of screenwriter and
director Pasikowski, naturalistic violence is just an
expression of equally brutal everyday reality of
post-Communist Poland. Pasikowski made this film three years
after the collapse of Communism, and in that time the newly
democratic country looked far away from reaching economic
and political standards of Western Europe. The end of
socialist economy brought unimaginable poverty to the
people, and many were forced to turn to crime in order to
survive; that later led to collapse of each and every
ethical norm and many Poles were guided in their life by
their most primordial and savage instincts. PSY is brutal
even to the protagonist, who is presented as corrupt,
primitive, violent and scruples individual who usually
treats their fellow men like garbage. PSY is actually film
without any positive character in usual Hollywood sense and
this represents something like a problem for Pasikowski;
since Maurer is not very different from the people he must
fight, he must be given the girlfriend in order to show his
kinder and gentler side. The subplot involving juvenile
delinquent Angela (played by Agnieska Jaskolka) is rather
routine and therefore needless; Linda and Jaskolka lack
chemistry and during the scenes when they are together we
can hardly wait for the film to start dealing with the real
subject. In the end, the whole idea of making Maurer more
humane is compromised in the brief scene that shows his
enemy, Gross, as kind and warm family man.</P>
<P>Today, when Poland more or less managed to overcome most of
the usual post- Communist difficulties, PSY is not as
effective as it was eight years ago. Pasikowski's picture of
Poland was simply too grim, and his speculations on near
future were not proven to be correct. According to the
experiences in most of post-Communist countries, former
secret policemen, instead of organising their own
all-powerful narco- Mafia, simply changed their masters and
former members of Nomenklatura found much easier and less
risky way for getting rich during the privatisation of
former state-owned companies. Pasikowski was perhaps trying
to hint some of those developments in the film, but PSY is
simply too short for that. Another problem for this film is
in references to the event in Polish Communist past, which
are hardly understandable for anyone outside Poland (except
perhaps viewers in other post-Communist countries, who can
probably recognise similar characters and situations).
Because of its brutality and rawness, PSY looks somewhat
unrefined, but such flaws are overcome with superb acting
and few scenes of black humour (especially visible in the
otherwise extremely naturalistic police shootout scene).
However, despite being far from perfect, PSY is memorable
viewing experience for anyone who can handle it, and
therefore it should be recommended for those who like to see
how East European filmmakers react to their post-Communist
reality.</P>
