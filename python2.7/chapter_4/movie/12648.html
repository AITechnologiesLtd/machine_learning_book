<P>     If I didn't know this was a documentary, I might easily mistake it 
for the latest feature offering from Woody Allen – that's how 
interchangeable the public personae of the director has become with that 
of the nebbish screen character he always portrays.  In WILD MAN BLUES, 
Allen plays himself, a role he has not previously attempted, at least 
not openly.  But this claustrophobic, neurotic artist bears more than a 
passing resemblance to the protagonist of DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.  Or of 
EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  Or of HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  Or…  Well, you get 
the picture.</P>
<P>     Ostensibly, the purpose of WILD MAN BLUES was to create a celluloid 
record of the whirlwind concert tour of Woody Allen and his New Orleans 
Jazz Band (18 European venues in 23 days).  Allen, who spent years 
nursing his passion for the clarinet at Michael's Pub in New York, 
finally decided to take the show on the road in 1996.  Oddly, as it 
turns out, the least interesting elements of the film are those that 
deal with Allen the musician, and the editing rarely allows us to hear 
more than scattered bits and pieces of a number of great jazz standards.  
Indeed, the most fascinating and illuminating aspect of WILD MAN BLUES 
is its ability to capture the essence of Allen's relationship with his 
then girlfriend (now wife), the "notorious" Soon-Yi Previn.  </P>
<P>     The Allen/Previn liaison, which has been much maligned in the 
United States and once provided daily fodder for tabloids and talk radio 
shows, is subtly explored throughout WILD MAN BLUES.  Director Barbara 
Kopple was provided "complete access," and she used it to capture many 
intimate details of the couple's interaction:  how they use separate 
bathrooms, how Previn foists an unwanted breakfast off on Allen, and how 
they have gradually become less reticent about public displays of 
affection.  The overall image is one of two people that, despite their 
age and cultural differences, are completely at ease with each another.  
There's a lot of affection, albeit without any sense of sexual 
attraction (at times, Allen looks to Previn for almost-maternal comfort 
and assurance).  And, if there's a leader in the relationship, it's 
clearly Previn, whose advice on both business and domestic matters is 
always heeded.</P>
<P>     WILD MAN BLUES is not a concert film, as is obvious from its 
frustratingly brief musical interludes (Kopple repeatedly truncates 
lively performances, including a great rendition of "Down by the 
Waterside"). Neither is it worshipful of its central figure (that was 
one of the chief failings of Jim Jarmusch's dull, lifeless look at Neil 
Young, YEAR OF THE HORSE).  Although Allen is not demonized, he is shown 
to be a deeply flawed human being who is aware of (most of) his numerous 
failings.  </P>
<P>     With two award-winning films under her belt (HARLAN COUNTY, USA and 
AMERICAN DREAM), Kopple has set herself up as one of the country's 
leading documentarians, so it's a little surprising to see her tackling 
such seemingly-light material.  And, although she does a decent job with 
what she has to work with, there's a limit to the variety available from 
following Woody, his sister, his girlfriend, and his fellow band members 
from Paris to Madrid to Geneva to Rome to London.  WILD MAN BLUES has a 
tendency to become repetitious, especially during the final forty 
minutes (although the brilliant closing scene, with Previn and Allen 
visiting his parents in New York, is irreplaceable).  This movie is for 
anyone who wants to learn a little more about the "real" Allen than what 
can be determined from the tabloids and interpolated from his numerous 
semi-autobiographical feature outings.</P>
