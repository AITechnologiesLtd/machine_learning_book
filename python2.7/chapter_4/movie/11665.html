Review: **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>In "The Sweet Hereafter," writer/director Atom Egoyan takes us beyond
the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living. He shows us how it
isn't dying that hurts, but rather the pain of living in the hereafter
of death, and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings.</P>
<P>On a cold winter day in a small, isolated town in British Columbia, a
school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen
lake, where it cracks through the ice and sinks. Fourteen children die,
and numerous others are hurt. For the residents of this small town, all
of whose children were on that bus, it is an earth-shattering event that
resolutely alters their lives. They have always relied on each other in
the past to deal with heartache and pain, but it seems that this tragedy
is more than they can handle.</P>
<P>Alberta and Risa Walker, who own a local motel and lost their child in
the accident, hire an attorney named Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) to
bring a lawsuit against someone, anyone for responsibility. The bus
driver, Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose), is a kindly woman who loved
the children and, although she lives with a burden of guilt, is not held
responsible for the accident. The bus seems to have simply slipped on
some ice, and there was nothing should could do to prevent it.</P>
<P>However, according to Stephens, there are no "accidents" in life, and
someone will pay for this tragedy, whether that be the manufacturer of
the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through. He goes through the
town, approaching the parents who have lost children, asking them to
join the class action suit and find vent for their anger. And, for his
work, Stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money.</P>
<P>However, it is immediately apparent that Stephens has little or no
interest in the money. He is driven by something else, something deeper
that he shares in common with the grieving parents. He has lost a child,
too, but not in the same manner. His daughter, Zoe (Caerthan Banks), who
once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite, has
been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years.
She calls him on an irregular basis, begging him for money, but refusing
to tell him what she needs it for. "I don't know who I'm taking to," he
tells her. In his mind, his daughter is dead.</P>
<P>The lawsuit is, to Stephens, not only a way to mend the town's pain, but
also his own. However, not everyone in town wants it to happen. Billy
Ansell (Bruce Greenwood), who was driving behind the bus when the
accident happened and lost two children, wants nothing to do with it. He
has already lost his wife, and he buries his grief in an affair with a
married woman. He doesn't want to talk about the accident, and he sees
the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds.
To him, the town should be able to take care of its own pain, and it
doesn't need outsiders like Stephens getting in the way.</P>
<P>Central to "The Sweet Hereafter" is the tale of Nicole Burnell (Sarah
Polley), a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident
turned her into "a wheelchair girl," as she puts it. Aside from
Stephens, Nicole is the most complex character in the film, and it is
she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will
turn out.</P>
<P>It is also her sad, haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack,
reading Robert Browning's poem about the Pied Piper, and how when he led
all the town's children away, one was left behind because he was
crippled. Obviously, Nicole is that child, and she feels somehow
betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in
the wreck.</P>
<P>Her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a
loving, but incestuous relationship with her father (Tom McCamus). There
is only one, fleeting scene that suggests this relationship, but it is
somehow tied into the final act of the film. Of all the storylines in
"The Sweet Hereafter," this is the most complicated and unresolved,
although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film.
Egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple
answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by
trying to neatly wrap it up.</P>
<P>What Egoyan has done in "The Sweet Hereafter" is really nothing short of
miraculous. In his adaptation of the novel by Russell Banks, he has made
a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law
and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss, and how
pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human
life.</P>
<P>Egoyan has always been a talented, but distant and cerebral filmmaker
whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold. "The Sweet Hereafter"
is quite the opposite; Egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work
brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion, and draw the
audience into the tragedy. "The Sweet Hereafter" seems to contain the
combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked.</P>
<P>The film is filled with beautiful, subtle performances from all the
actors, especially Ian Holm as the lawyer and Sarah Polley as the sad
child who was left behind. The beautiful, roving camerawork by Paul
Sarossy and the haunting, melodic musical score by Mychael Danna (both
previous Egoyan collaborators) give the film a visual and aural
cohesiveness with the thematic elements.</P>
<P>Like his earlier films, Egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that
form a blanketing whole. He works with time as a fluid substance,
shifting back and forth between the past, the distant past, and the
present with effortless ease. The actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen
until midway through the film, but by that time the event has built up
so much emotion that Egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic
detail, and still have it carry great, devastating weight.</P>
<P>Because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies, it is
astounding that Egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple,
direct terms. Certainly one of the best films of 1997, "The Sweet
Hereafter" is a deeply rewarding, mystifying, and ultimately human film.</P>
