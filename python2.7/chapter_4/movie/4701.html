<PRE>                      I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA (1988)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<P>     You might be wondering why I'm reviewing this movie. Well, I'm
1/16 black, you know... Would you believe 1/64? Either way, I've always
known every ghetto slang word before the general public and been able
to appreciate black humor. Maybe it's because I grew up in such a
dangerous neighborhood and graduated from a school populated by Lakeas,
Lakeishas, Laquidas, Larissas, Latonyas, La Toschas, Latieshas,
Latricheshas, La Wandas, and a guy named Boogie. I'm also one of the
only white guys I know who actually likes rap music. That probably
originates from years of low-riding cars with 1.21 jigowatt sound
systems blasting the music of various M.C.'s and Ice's, while driving
by my house at ten miles an hour while I was trying to sleep. Different
story.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, this was a hilarious movie from my standpoint.
Keenan Ivory Wayans may have struck out with 1995's detective parody A
LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME (which more than lived up to its name), but this
movie is right on target. It's a take-off of the SHAFT and BLACULA-type
movies of the 70's, but keeps one foot on the ground, unlike other
parody movies like HOT SHOTS and NAKED GUN, which retreat into their
own bizarre little worlds.</P>
<P>     I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA has its own alternate world, where gang
members get addicted to wearing too many gold chains and medallions,
but seems more like an actual movie with an actual story to tell
besides making us laugh. There are still a lot of funny digressions
from the plot--the Pimp of the Year pageant, Keenan on "Soul Train" and
the scene where Keenan's date begins taking off clothes and body parts
(one of the funniest movie scenes ever, methinks).</P>
<P>     Keenan plays a wimpy soldier who returns home to find his brother
dead and his family terrorized by crime boss Mr. Big and his henchmen
(Damon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison). Keenan solicits help from some
retired revolutionaries (including Isaac Hayes, Bernie Casey and
ex-football star Jim Brown) to take back the neigborhood.</P>
<P>     I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA is an all-around funny movie that spoofs
blaxploitation films indirectly, by speculating on what would happen
ten years after those movies were over. It works from beginning to end,
with more than a few memorable moments for black and white viewers
alike. My mom even liked this movie.  If that's not an endorsement, I
don't know what is.</P>
