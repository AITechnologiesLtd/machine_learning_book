<PRE>                              GATTACA 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
               3 cheery :-) :-) :-)  for the human spirit</PRE>
<P>Cast: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Loren Dean, Gore
Vidal, Ernest Borgnine Director: Andrew Niccol Producers: Danny DeVito,
Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher Screenplay: Andrew Niccol</P>
<P>There is no gene for the human spirit,
No gene to help brighten your day.
There is no gene that will carry you that extra mile,
No gene for carrying your dreams all the way.</P>
<P>After watching a film as sterile and polished as Gattaca, I'm kinda glad
my hair is a little dishevelled, my shirt a little wrinkled, my shoes in
need of polishing and I don't need a finger prick blood test everyday.
In an age where genetic engineering is used to eliminate "evils" like
heart disease, depression and other ill personality/physical traits,
only those near perfection are allowed the opportunities for success
available to all of us today.</P>
<P>There is something lacking about perfection when the creation is purely
man made. Without the imperfect traits of character and physical
disability, we would lack the personality and the will to improve
ourselves. Ever noticed that no one smiles in "Gattaca", no one laughs,
and nobody cries. It's as if emotion, one of the most important aspects
of being human has been erased with the re-sequencing of the DNA codes.
Sure I get depressed when I fail a task, and I get angry when something
goes wrong, but I can also laugh at my mistakes and forgive myself for
making them.</P>
<P>In the stylised world of "Gattaca" these issues are nicely illustrated.
Ethan Hawke is the imperfect being who shows us that character strengths
are more than a list of percentages or likelihood for success. Sure this
movie is a long sit, but it has enough good material and thought put
into it than most of the recycled crap churned out by Hollywood.</P>
