Rules of Engagement</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Deep in the thicket of the Vietnam War, anonymous bullets fly, ripping
through branches, streams, leaves, catching flesh as the digital frame
stutters bursting into red. This impressive, yet bloody sequence fixes the
history of Tommy Lee and Samuel L. as battle-bonded mates.</P>
<P>But it's a present day military action in Yemen that ties Samuel L. onto the
hot seat and Tommy in the extremely warm one just beside him. An unruly
crowd outside the US embassy prompts the passage of three choppers full of
Sam and his men to "baby-sit" on foreign turf. But when the poop hits the
fan, Sam risks life and limb to evacuate the ambassador and his family. At
the end of the day the streets are bloodied with dead women and children and
Sam stands alone at the end of the national security adviser's pointed
finger.</P>
<P>A military court-martial trial comprises the rest of the film. Samuel relies
on old buddy Tommy Lee to defend him against one of the militaries finest
prosecutors, Guy Pearce. Pierce is fierce, a bony Chihuahua with a New York
accent (though he's surprisingly a British born Aussie). Tommy reluctantly
takes on the case, and finding no strong leg to stand on, becomes
disillusioned concerning his best bud's innocence. I love this development.
We too, begin to doubt Jackson. But just as the tension mounts, bam, we (the
audience) are presented with a two-minute scene that spills the beans
concerning Sam's guilt/innocence. Why? No longer can we enjoy the delicately
difficult position Tommy Lee must endure, because though he is not privy to
our intelligence - somehow he seems to have resolved his internal conflict
along with us.</P>
<P>Still, Jones and Jackson are so rock hard, that it's impossible not to be
compelled to the proceedings. Recognition is due also, to the excellent
audio mixing. The sound on this film "Rules!" Unfortunately, the climax
comes and goes with less impact than nearly every other scene proceeding.
"Rules" picks up and turns around the "Few Good Men" story, putting Tommy
Lee in the position of defending the Jack Nicholson argument. In the end,
"Rules of Engagement," though shrapnel-ridden and faulted, still stands
proud.</P>
<P>(I ran into a couple of real live US Marines after the screening. FYI, They
were pleased with the film's portrayal of the military.)</P>
