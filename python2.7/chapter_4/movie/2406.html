<PRE>                        ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE
                       A film review by Mark Takacs

<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
    A wacky pet detective rescues a kidnapped dolphin.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is hired to find and return the kidnapped
Miami Dolphin's mascot, the dolphin Snowflake.  Zany antics abound as
Ace questions suspects, assists the police, researches, and romances.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     I didn't really *want* to like the movie, because it *looked*
stupid.  How funny can Jim Carrey be for 85 minutes?  His stuff's good
on five-minute skits, but I didn't think I could even remotely enjoy a
whole showcase movie.  I was wrong.  I ended up laughing a lot.</P>
<P>     Jim Carrey works all his famous bits--the cackling Popeye laugh,
his killer Captain James T. Kirk, and his physical humor.  Much of the
movie is funny because his exaggerated moves are so animated-comic-like
and, well, exaggerated.  He walks funny, he talks funny, and he makes
funny faces.  Doesn't sound funny, but he pulls it off.</P>
<P>     Tone Loc was surprisingly good as Ace's inside police contact.  He
didn't act like a rapper in a cameo, he just acted.  Check him out in
Disney's BLANK CHECK as well.  My opinion of him just keeps going up.</P>
<P>    Dan Marino should stick to making Isotoner commercials.  'Nuf said.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     Talking about it ACE VENTURA really doesn't do it justice though.
You'll just have to watch it and, when it's all over, see how much you
laughed.  I'm recommending this movie to my friends (as long as they
like Jim Carrey) and I think I'll even go with 'em again.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
 X  see several times (w/friends) as matinee
    see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
