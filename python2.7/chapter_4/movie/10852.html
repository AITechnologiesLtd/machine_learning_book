Rated R: Language, violence</P>
<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    When I first saw the trailer for Deep Rising, I rolled my eyes
because I could see, just from the quick scenes depicted in the preview,
that the film would be a genuinely thorough Alien rip-off with some
nifty special effects. I expected a boring, ho-hum film showcasing bad
acting and silly characters who go into contrived and non-scary
situations only to serve as cannon fodder to a giant tentacled monster.</P>
<P>    But it only took me two minutes to realize that writer/director
Stephen Sommers knows exactly what he's doing. Here is a film that
consciously rips off most of its ancestors (from Alien all the way up to
recent siblings like Anaconda); what makes it such a blast, why I
enjoyed every bit of it, is the simple fact that it makes fun of itself
and its own genre. The acting is great, the characters are interesting
(better than cannon fodder), the humor is fresh and funnier than in most
comedies, the violence is ridiculously graphic and gory, and the film is
just plain fun.</P>
<P>    Treat Williams plays John Finnegan, a boat-operator who, in the
beginning of the film, is taking a group of shady individuals (led by
Wes Studi) to do something that he knows nothing about (his business
motto is "If the cash is there, we do not care"). When John's engine man
Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor) goes snooping around and finds a bunch of
missiles, the bad guys make it clear that they are actually en route to
sink a cruise ship. As it turns out, the owner of the cruise ship, Nigel
Carlton (Anthony Heald), isn't making enough money, so they're going to
loot the ship and sink it so he can live off the insurance.</P>
<P>    Sounds easy enough, until some kind of enormous mutant
creature--with seemingly endless numbers of tentacles all of infinite
length--attacks the cruise ship and destroys everyone on board. At this
point, it is up to our heroes to save the day, not only against the
human bad guys, but from the water bad guys as well.</P>
<P>    Sure, we've seen all this before. You'll find very few of the scare
tactics in this film new. Some of the scenes will even remind you of
films you might have just seen (the jet ski sequences are just like the
ones in Hard Rain). This isn't to say that the film is totally useless
as a horror flick--Sommers dumps the violence and gore on the audience.
The action, too, is really exciting. Scenes towards the end of the film
in which the tentacles come racing down corridors at high speeds are
just a few of the numerous fun-filled moments that Deep Rising has to
offer. Nor does the film feel low-budget and campy--the creature, though
clearly digital, looks professional; and the cruise liner, shot only at
dark and in the rain (not every film can look like Titanic) is at least
convincing for the few seconds that we get to see it. Overall, the
visual presentation of Deep Rising is pretty standard, but good
nonetheless.</P>
<P>    But that's not why I like this movie. The heart of my enjoyment lies
in the characters, who are surprisingly well-drawn and interesting.
Williams is terrific in the main role; he has a kind of passive
aggressive attitude towards everything, but he's so likable and
appealing that I was rooting for him from the start. O'Connor, however,
has all the funniest lines in the film. (He turns to someone, wheezing,
and says, "Can you, like, *get* asthma?") Not only is he funny, but he's
well-written as a character, which is unheard of in a film like this.</P>
<P>    The bad guys too, though there are a few too many (most of them
truly are cannon fodder), are all at least given some sort of identity,
whether it be different accents or sexual habits. Several of the actors
stand out among the crowd, including Anthony Heald, Wes Studi, Famke
Janssen (who plays an interesting pick-pocket thief), and Djimon Hounsou
(who some viewers might remember as Cinque in Amistad).</P>
<P>    I just love totally silly movies like this. Sommers is a sharp
director--he wanted to make a creature flick, but instead of trying to
go serious and disturbing, he made this hilarious and wild film that
looks at itself and laughs. I couldn't have imagined laughing at a film
in which I see a room full of thousands of mutilated humans, corridors
splattered with guts and blood and skin, and live people with only
half-heads screaming post-mortem, but now I've seen one. Deep Rising
isn't for the faint of heart, but it is for those who are tired of the
same old horror film garbage.</P>
