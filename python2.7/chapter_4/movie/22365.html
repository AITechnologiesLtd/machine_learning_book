<P>Mathew Warchus's Simpatico is a realistic story of long-term guilt, 
deflected love, and puzzling role-reversal.  Unfortunately, it's also an 
exercise in ennui for the viewer.</P>
<P>Based on the play by Sam Shepard,  Simpatico starts by showing us the 
remains of the old friendship between Lyle Carter (Jeff Bridges) and Vinnie 
(Nick Nolte).  Vinnie calls Carter from a pay phone outside a Payless 
grocery store in California.  Carter, a millionaire horse breeder in 
Kentucky, drops his business and tells one of his secretaries to inform his 
wife he's leaving on important business.  While this plot is unfolding we 
view shots from twenty-odd years ago, of a young Vinnie and Carter 
celebrating a winner at the track.  We come to understand that it was this 
time of youth that generated the mistake the men are still regretting.  What 
we do know is that it involves photographs and their negatives, and that 
Vinnie offers to give them to Carter if Carter agrees to talk with Vinnie's 
girlfriend.</P>
<P>According to Vinnie, this woman (Cecilia, played by Catherine Keener) has 
filed harassment charges against him, and Carter's chore is to reason with 
her in an attempt to get the charges dropped.  This story is one of many 
lies, though, and while Carter is inside Cecilia'a apartment, Vinnie steals 
Carter's car and all of his things.  For some reason Carter has left his 
wallet in his car, but he does have his cell phone.</P>
<P>What follows is a story replete with the ramifications and wrong turns 
caused by youthful stupidity and middle-aged guilt.  In Kentucky, Vinnie 
visits the victim of the youthful scam, one Mr. Simms, whose name is now 
Ames (Albert Finney).  Meanwhile, Carter stays in Vinnie's hovel;  the best 
explanation we have that Carter doesn't fly back to his wife and mansion and 
soon-to-be-sold Triple Crown winner is that he likes the smell of alfalfa.  
He grew up in this area of California, and apparently decides to forsake the 
life of lies he has led.  Carter even dresses in Vinnie's clothes and visits 
the seedy bar Vinnie frequents.  It is an interesting switching of lives, 
though not quite plausible.</P>
<P>What happens with Cecilia?  It seems her relationship with Vinnie was only 
platonic anyway, but she ends up as Carter's agent, taking a lot of money to 
Simms/Ames in return for the negatives.  Later we meet Rosie (Sharon Stone), 
Carter's wife, who wonders why her husband isn't back home to celebrate the 
$30 million sale of Simpatico.  The staff of Carter's horse farm goes along 
with Carter's whim, covering for him, but what's a little shaky is that 
Carter seems serious in not returning to Kentucky.  There's an interesting 
scene between Vinnie and Rosie before Vinnie returns to California to find 
Carter, his doppelganger, crashed on the couch in a drunken heap.</P>
<P>What's very weird is that there is no actual scene between Carter and Rosie; 
  we see them talking on the phone and we see them as youths in the 
flashbacks.  Further, Vinnie and Cecilia never share a frame.  It is 
interesting, though, how we learn about them through their talk with others; 
but it is not very helpful in coaxing the viewers' sympathy.</P>
<P>The excellent cast all do a fine job.  Nolte has played this type of 
freeloader once too frequently, perhaps, but he is quite proficient.  It's 
fascinating trying to figure out his motivations.  Bridges also acts 
smoothly, though we are still not given adequate reason to believe he would 
forfeit his lifestyle so completely.  The surprise find here is Catherine 
Keener as the somewhat reserved Cecilia.  She acts off Bridges particularly 
well, stopping short of alarm at his odd antics.  Albert Finney is the only 
character to play himself in the flashbacks (the young Vinnie is Shawn 
Hatosy, the young Carter Liam Waite, the young Rosie Kimberly Williams).  As 
such, Finney does not visually convince us; and although he is among the 
very finest living actors, Finney's style is too inflated for the seedy 
tracer of equine bloodlines.  His Simms/Ames is lustful yet not quite 
despicable.</P>
<P>Mathew Warchus also penned the screenplay, and it seems at times that 
Shepard's lines still belong on the stage.  Some of the delivery is too 
portentous for the movies;  it's as if we need the in-person medium of live 
drama for the material to resonate properly.  The editing moves quickly 
enough through most of the narrative, and the flashbacks are nicely 
introduced - at times the older characters melt into their younger selves 
and we realize without obtrusive devices where we are.  But the flatness 
near the end results in a lack of satisfaction.</P>
<P>Simpatico is not a major work in the canon of modern film, but it is a 
strong study of the damage wrought by hidden secrets --  a theme not 
uncommon in the work of the actor/playwright Sam Shepard.  The film is rated 
R for language and glimpses of sordid sexuality.</P>
