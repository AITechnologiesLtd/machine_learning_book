<P>
Now that X-Files has apparently become a quirky romantic comedy, sort
of like an alien-network executive hybrid of the first season of
"Friends" and "Twilight Zone" (e.g., "in a very special episode,
because of lost time, Mulder forgets Scully's birthday..."), we have to
go elsewhere to get our grand conspiracy-paranoia fix.  Conveniently, I
was on a quest to see the Star Wars preview, and "Enemy of the State"
just seemed like the right kind of movie to have "Every Saga Has a
Beginning..." pop up beforehand.  Sadly, that particular movie theater
insisted on putting the premiere with the Brad Pitt-as-Deadhead movie
instead of making my life more convenient.  Sadly, too, the paranoia
fix just wasn't there:  low-grade stuff, not worthy of the better
conspiracy movies.</P>
<P>Comparisons between "Enemy of the State" and the superb Coppola film,
"The Conversation" are inevitable.  Both feature Gene Hackman as a
professional eavesdropper, both indulge in hidden cameras and listening
through tiny microphones as their central activity.  The new movie pays
homage to its predecessor in its spy-on-people-in-park sequence, for
that matter.</P>
<P>But the older film maintains a dark, forbidding atmosphere throughout.
There's a sense of dread.  It was released around the time of
Watergate, after all.  This new film has plenty of adrenaline scenes,
stunts that couldn't easily be staged in the 1970s, wild chases that
arguably should have made the evening news but somehow didn't.  It's
neat eye candy, but, beyond a few tossed off platitudes about watching
the watchers and all that, there's nothing there but stage smoke and
flashing lights.  One almost thinks this was deliberate.  In "The
Conversation" there's one last bit surveillance, one nasty, creepy
episode of eavesdropping at the end.  There's also a final flourish of
watching at the end of "Enemy", but it's a happy, jokey scene: Gene
Hackman is sending Will Smith his vacation pictures.  Will Smith is not
in the least freaked out by this intrusion.  I suppose that if friends
are watching you then it's really no problem at all.</P>
<P>Feelings of grand conspiracy are also notably absent in "Enemy".  The
bad guys are a rogue unit of the NSA, led by someone with a grudge
because he wasn't promoted to Deputy Secretary of Spy Satellites And
Men's Room Stalls, or something.  On the whole, the NSA doesn't come
off as evil, just misguided in an office or two: there's even a scene
where the NSA chief makes a point of law regarding his agencies
activities, and invoking a threat of prison time for people who might
have done bad things.  The apparatus, in this case, isn't evil; there
are merely evil men.  Quite clearly, we're no longer in the age of
Watergate, despite the current impeachment hubbub.</P>
<P>I think there's one other free floating film reference in "Enemy", this
time to the disappointing Wim Wenders's state surveillance film, "The
End of Violence".  Well, maybe, but that's how I thought of Gabriel
Byrne's cameo.</P>
<P>At least in the Wim Wenders's, the act of surveillance is supposed to
have a distancing, depersonalizing quality.  All the computer screens
allow you to watch the world but not be a part of it.  In "Enemy", the
film makers indulge in the late 1990s ops center fetish, where flashing
screens, militarily precise orders and commando tactics have a certain
testosterone-heavy flourish.  The implied attractiveness of this sort
of world undermines whatever pretense the film might have about
eavesdropping being a wrong thing.</P>
<P>A few random notes, to close things out.  I find it interesting that
the vast surveillance apparatus portrayed in the movie can't be used
to, say, find Scud missiles in the Iraqi desert.  Certainly, a Scud is
somewhat larger than Will Smith.  Maybe they've been able to exploit
more of that alien technology they have over in Area 51.  I only offer
that as a possibility.  As someone who works with computers all day, I
have to note that many of the computer screens portrayed in this movie
had typical Hollywood user interfaces: lots of cool looking data
scrolling by, little of it useful, all of it capable of producing mongo
eye strain.  Surely, the NSA must have a good vision care program.
Much of the surveillance footage in the opening credits, I think, has
appeared in various Fox specials, "When 7-11 Clerks Attack", or
something similar.  One may note that much of this surveillance is
courtesy of private entities, ranging from your local bank's ATM booth
to the usual 7-11 security cam, up to the almost ubiquitous Los Angeles
area news chopper.  Little of that footage was from government
entities.  Yes, the people who put the credits together wanted to send
us a message about surveillance being pervasive in our society.  Well,
maybe that's what they wanted to say.</P>
