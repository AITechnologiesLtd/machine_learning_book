<PRE>Tomorrow Never Dies
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) TOMORROW NEVER DIES is another link in the chain of
James Bond movies. It doesn't deviate too far from the formula, so if
you know your Bond, you know what you're getting. </P>
<P>The villain this time is media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who
wants his near-monopoly on news and information, to become a monopoly.
He plans to instigate a war between Britain and China, right in front of
his news cameras, using a stealth ship to fool their military forces.
Because he's scripting the war, his news reports can stay well ahead of
the competition. </P>
<P>James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is called in to examine possible links
between Carver and strange activity in the waters off China. China sends
Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), who becomes Bond's partner and counterpart. </P>
<P>Bond has encountered strong women before but none who have kicked as
much ass as Yeoh. Yeoh, who has worked in Hong Kong action movies, most
notably with Jackie Chan, is a great counterpart to Brosnan. She has a
scene where she singlehandedly takes out a squadron of bad guys. Bond
shows up in time to "save" her from the last villain, but we know who
really won the fight. Wai Lin's relationship with Bond is professional,
not sexual, which seems at first like a refreshing twist, but is really
a necessity: she couldn't sleep with 007 (in his own movie) and keep her
dignity as an equal. </P>
<P>Desmond Llewelyn makes his 16th appearance as Q, outlasting every other
Bond actor. He has the usual gadgets for "doublo sev'n," including, of
course, several car-mounted devices that are sure to make for some
excellent chase scenes. Judi Dench returns as the tough new M, making
sure that the men of the intelligence community don't do too much of
their thinking with their balls. </P>
<P>TOMORROW has all the ingredients that we've come to know and love in
Bond films: the sexy, sexist title sequences; the gadgets; the stunts;
and the big cavernous room with an army of bad guys in identical jump
suits. But this is also what holds it back. Nothing new makes this Bond
anything more than just a link in the chain. I enjoyed the movie, but it
won't go down in the Bond books as a classic. </P>
<P>If this film had been made ten years ago, it might have been more of an
achievement. But in this age of computer-generated special effects, some
excitement is lost. We know or are wise to suspect that some of the
stunts and gimmicks are more fake than they used to be. The days of a
"real" fistfight on the back of a jet are gone. But as the politics of
Bond have been updated, so too must the look be updated. </P>
<P>One thing hasn't changed though. "James Bond will return."</P>
