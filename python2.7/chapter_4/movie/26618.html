OUTBREAK
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>When people think about the eradication of human race, they
usually envision nuclear holocaust, sudden change of
climate, asteroids falling from the sky or similar
spectacular events. But history teaches us that the equally
deadly potential lies in tiny microscopic organisms -
viruses and bacteria able to practically wipe out entire
nations. Invention of antibiotics and progress of medical
science in the last century or so created illusion that the
infectious diseases are the thing of the past. That illusion
was shattered with the epidemic of AIDS in 1980s, and people
are now more willing to pay attention when media starts
reporting about various exotic ailments that happen to be
contagious, deadly and untreatable. Few of those ailments
are as scary as various forms of haemorrhagic fever -
extremely contagious viral infection that causes one of the
most unpleasant deaths imaginable. Probably the most
notorious among them is Ebola, disease which killed hundreds
of people in central regions of Africa five years ago. By
the unusual yet chilling coincidence, these events happened
roughly in the same time as the premiere of OUTBREAK, major
Hollywood feature film that dealt the effects of Ebola-like
outbreak on modern society.</P>
<P>The "protagonist" of this film is Motaba virus, strain from
Central Africa which is able to kill infected human in less
than 48 hours upon contagion. Despite not being airborne and
thus having limited contagion potentials, the strain is so
deadly that the two US Army experts in late 1960s would
rather firebomb the infected camp in Central African jungle
than allow infection to spread further. Some thirty years
later, Motaba again strikes Central Africa, but, as usual in
such circumstances, isolated villagers are dead before they
can spread the infection further. Unfortunately, monkeys can
carry the virus and one of them is caught and smuggled into
USA. Soon, the population of Cedar Creek, small town in
California, starts getting sick and dying like flies.
Colonel Sam Daniels (played by Dustin Hoffman), U.S. Army
top expert for infectious diseases disobeys the orders of
his superiors - General Billy Ford (played by Morgan
Freeman) and General Donald McClintock (played by Donald
Sutherland) - and flies to now quarantined Cedar Creek in
order to investigate the origin of mysterious plague. There
he meets his estranged wife Robby Keough (played by Rene
Russo) who investigates disease as the head of CDC team.
They start working together while the crisis escalates,
because the strain mutated into airborne form. While Daniels
and Keough struggle to find possible cure and thus stop the
epidemic from spreading to the rest of the nation,
McClintock offers simple but grim alternative - firebombing
the town and incinerating the virus together with all the
inhabitants.</P>
<P>OUTBREAK was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, German filmmaker
who enjoys reputation of one of the best craftsmen in modern
Hollywood. His talent is at display in this film, especially
in the way he paces film and turns screenplay by Laurence
Dworet and Robert Roy Pool into thought-provoking yet
exciting story. The same feeling of doom and helplessness
that marked DAS BOOT, Petersen's best known film, could be
sensed here too, but Petersen creates it through entirely
different methods. Events in the film happen at the rapid
pace, and the viewer could empathise with the protagonists
who see world literally falling apart before their eyes, in
the same way microscopic bug destroys the bodies of their
victims. Petersen is uncompromising in the portrayal of the
destructive effects of haemorrhagic fever - nobody is immune
from its devastating effect, people get infected and die
regardless of their race, religion, gender, age or whether
they are nice people or not (all illustrated with almost
comedic but chilling shots of virus travelling from one
unsuspecting host to another). What is even more chilling in
this film is the way epidemic destroys society indirectly -
human relations, even most basic must be severed, kindness
and compassion equals suicide, people must leave their loved
ones in order to survive and the only way to stop the
apocalypse is to use even less considerations and more
genocidal potential than the illness itself. Because of the
chillingly realistic and believable depiction of the
apocalypse that might wait around the corner turned OUTBREAK
was supposed to be one of the best disaster films ever made
in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Although Petersen managed
to overcome some unnecessary plot distractions in the
screenplay (marital problems of the protagonists), he
couldn't overcome certain realities of 1990s Hollywood. And
one of such realities is the unwritten rule that any film
with a budget over 50 million US$ must have obligatory happy
ending in order to satisfy the audience. So, in the last
third, film suddenly changes genre and general mood - what
was supposed to be dark, disturbing drama about conflict
between Humanity and Nature is suddenly turning into
light-hearted actionfest that feature conflict between Good
Guy (Dustin Hoffman not very comfortable and even less
believable as action hero) and Bad Guy (in the form of
Donald Sutherland who repeats his evil bureaucrat/officer
routine for the umpteenth time). Naturally, all notions of
credibility go down the toilet and the viewers' intelligence
is repeatedly insulted with the series of implausibilities -
while average R&D in real life pharmaceutical industry takes
years to create drugs, our hero manages to extract the
medicine in the matter of minutes, just to save his wife in
time; bomber crews, which are trained to exterminate
millions of innocent civillians without any remorse, are
simply talked into disobeying the direct order). That last
segment of OUTBREAK - flooded with cliches and cheap
sentimentality - is probably the one of the most
disappointing pieces of celluloid ever made in 1990s
Hollywood and it could serve as the perfect illustration of
the sad state of American film industry.</P>
<P>To be fair, even in this segment, Petersen handles the
action very well, and OUTBREAK in general looks like a
well-acted and well-crafted film. But, among the many missed
opportunities of 1990s Hollywood, this one is probably the
most bitter.</P>
