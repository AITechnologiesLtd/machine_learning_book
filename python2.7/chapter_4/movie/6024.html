<PRE>                             HEART LIKE A WHEEL
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        HEART LIKE A WHEEL isn't a great piece of B movie making, because 
it's striving for A status, but it's a terrific little flick nevertheless. 
Directed by Jonathan Kaplan, from a script by Ken Friedman, it tells a 
true story about three-time Top Fuel hot rod racing champion Shirley "Cha 
Cha" Muldowney and sticks to it in the old fashion way. (Though not 
rotting like Tony Curtis' JOHNNY DARK and not in any way as phony 
fashionable as John Frankenheimer's Sominex epic GRAND PRIX.) This is 
assured moviemaking, confident of winning you over. By the end, I almost 
cheered -- a reaction I'm told was common for evening showings. In rooting 
for underdog Muldowney, this picture is somewhat like MELVIN AND HOWARD -- 
with an ending you wish Melvin could have had. The best news of all is 
that HEART isn't just about racing or the women's lib propaganda inherent 
in it, it's also about the relationships between men striving to make it 
and the women they love who become better at what their men are striving 
for. Muldowney, at least in the picture, is one women in a man's world who 
men can admire -- even while using her. The theme isn't heavy duty 
provocative or sexist, but there are some potently provocative and sexist 
moments that pop up -- the realism of the moments startling and cogent. </P>
<P>        As Muldowney, Bonnie Bedelia's face isn't as strong as it might 
be; she's missing flesh in her cheeks and with a tiny mouth, she has an 
elongated, pinched chin that tends to make us think we're looking at a 
mannequin, particularly when she wears her helmet. She often looks like 
one of the harpies from the soaps -- Robin Strasser's Dorian on "One Life 
to Live." (Sometimes she resembles Peggy Ann Fleming.) But she doesn't act 
as if she's in a soap -- there's no fishwifery. She gives a fine reading, 
using her incomplete face and her eyes and voice as though she's 
constantly opining, especially when she confronts some competition for 
Beau Bridges' affections in a motel restaurant, or when she's on the phone 
talking to her ex-husband, or when, again on the phone, she's giving a 
radio sportscaster an interview. (It is during these phone scenes that her 
faces merges with her character.) To some there may be hints of the Streep 
method, but Bedelia, at times as calculated, doesn't produce any cold 
fronts. </P>
<P>        Beau Bridges as the famous hot rodder-womanizer Connie Kalitta 
does what Warren Beatty and Jack Nickolson haven't been able to -- 
realistically womanize his way into our suspicious hearts; the lies this 
character tells endears him to us. Flabbed out, unshaven, fingernails 
greased to the max, revelling in his puppy dog act, Bridges gives the most 
honest portrayal of a womanizer that's come out of Hollywood in years: 
every woman knows a man like this and many of them have loved him, and 
every man has had a buddy like him, if not wanting to be like him. What 
makes this performance so beautiful -- and ongoing even when he's not on 
the screen -- is that Bridges makes us understand why he does things 
without ever having to explain. We know why he attempts to beat Bedelia 
after she publicly disowns him (it's the only real act of feminist revenge 
in the picture and we understand that too). Bridges plays scenes that 
spring from our own lives; I couldn't detect a single false note 
throughout. Leo Rossi, as Shirley's ex, and a muscular version of Kevin 
Kline, is another slice of life: a man who doesn't want his wife to 
succeed all that much. When he calls her for money some years after their 
separation, it's a scene that might be ego-humiliating but it works -- 
there's heart and some valid level of pride in it. (Now that I think about 
it, this movie has more phone scenes than an average episode in a soap.)</P>
<P>        HEART LIKE A WHEEL works so well because there isn't any 
feminist-inspired humiliation in it -- an additive that would have been 
easy to mix in. You like everyone in this movie; and you like the movie 
immediately. Kaplan and Friedman don't waste time in establishing 
Muldowney's compulsion: at the beginning we see her as a child sitting on 
her drunken father's lap, behind the wheel of the car, zooming through the 
air. The thrill has been set. A few scenes later, now married, when 
Muldowney's husband agrees to a night time drag race, we watch as she 
stands in the middle of the highway mimicking her husband's shifting of 
gears. It's in her blood but not his and he loses. In the next race, she 
takes over and wins. The crowd cheers and she waves to acknowledge them. 
But it's really a wave of goodbye -- she's lost her heart to the wheel. 
It's when I lost mine, too. </P>
