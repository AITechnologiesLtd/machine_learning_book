<P>The 1970's were a time of passage for a lot of us. Cruising with our
friends, going out on our first date, and learning the ins and outs of
too many vices were all part of that passage. Not all of us experienced
the same things. But one thing that we all did have in common and that
was Rock and Roll. Cameron Crowe, the writer of the seminal teen comedy
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and Writer, Director of the charming "Say
Anything" and "Jerry McGuire", give us a touching and humorous peon to
youth, love, and most importantly music.</P>
<P>William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is an intelligent young man of 15.
Already in his senior year of High School (thanks to his mother's
skipping two grades, claiming the school system is too limiting). Elaine
Miller (Frances McDermont) is a college professor who is raising her
children on her own (William's father died when William was only 6).
Elaine's fear of modern society creates at atmosphere of repression
around the home, with drugs being the ultimate danger. This leads
William's sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel) to leave home with her
boyfriend for California. In an effort to expand her little brother's
horizons, she leaves him her album collection, giving him strict
instructions to listen to The Who's "Tommy" with a candle burning, "and
you'll see your future".</P>
<P>William becomes fascinated with the music. Being a gifted child, he
starts to write. Soon he is submitting articles to national magazines
which leads to his meeting famed Cream Magazine critic, Lester Bangs
(Philip Seymour Hoffman). Bangs burned on the industry's homogenization
of music. But he is taken by Williams's innocents and creativity, so
offers the young man an assignment. Interview Black Sabbath and write a
700-word article about the band. William is excited and nervous as his
Mother drives him to the concert. Unable to get past security, Williams
befriends Penny Lane (Kate Hudson); leader of the famed Band Aid troop
of fans (groupies that claimed not to have sex with the bands) and the
band Sweetwater.</P>
<P>Russel Hammond (Billy Crudup) is taken by the young man and gives the
boy a chance at a new gig, interviewing Sweetwater and travelling with
them on their latest tour. This leads to William being approached by
Rolling Stone Magazine to cover the tour and write an inside piece on
the band.</P>
<P>Cameron Crowe is one of the best writers of characters and character
interplay working today. While not having a poetic style like David
Mamet, Crowe's characters speak with a personality and believability
that seems unscripted. This naturalness is most appealing here. All of
the characters are finely drawn and believable in their behavior and
attitudes. And that same quality leads to some very funny and
heartbreaking moments.</P>
<P>Patrick Fugit, in his first film steals the picture with his wide eyed
innocent portrayal of William. His passion for the music and the shear
joy in which he follows the band are just infectous. This is one of the
best debuts by an actor in years. This is a young actor to watch.
Frances McDermont is vivaciously droll as Elaine Miller. So concerned
with her son's upbringing, she constantly reminds him of the dangers of
drugs, while urging him to read the works of Poe, Isben, and Goethe. She
is a strong willed woman who loves her children but refuses to stand in
the way of their future. This is McDermont's best performance since
"Fargo" and is as touching and funny.</P>
<P>Of course, the real showcase performances of the film belong to Billy
Crudup and Kate Hudson. Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond, guitarist for
the band Sweetwater is a young adult dealing with his own fame and his
growing dissatisfaction with his band. His performance is charmingly
naïve. Here is a man who would just as well be sitting with a beer at a
house party, as he would work on his career. His is a funny, touching
and completely believable realization. And Kate Hudson is absolutely
charming as the love interest Penny Lane. Her love affair with Russell
and her growing affection for William is just a joy to watch. Again, the
naivete of the character is the most notable quality here. Hudson
manages to make Penny Lane both a silly little girl, dreaming of love
and trips to Monaco and a woman who knows that this life style is only
transitory and that her real life lies elsewhere.</P>
<P>The other cast members are all equally fine. In fact, I can't think of
another recent film as perfectly cast and performed as this one this
year. Most notably are, Jason Lee as Jeff Bebe (Sweetwater's lead
singer), to the other members of Band Aid, Anna Panquin as Polexia
Aphrodisia and Faruza Balk as Sapphire are all wonderfully crafted
performances. These are just damn good character performances, and while
never really center stage always remain in the periphery of the film,
adding just the right subtle touches of character and depth to bring
this film its believability.</P>
<P>And foremost throughout the film is the music. The section of songs
ranging from Lou Reed's "Waiting for the Man" to Led Zeppelin's
"Tangerine" is just marvelously chosen, rivaling the soundtrack to
Stephen Feares' "High Fidelity".  And the score by Nancy Wilson (of the
70's group Heart) is equally enjoyable in both its simplicity and its
detail. Wilson also penned two songs for the fictional band, Sweetwater
that will make audiences everywhere searching for more material from
this group.</P>
<P>At the close of the movie, both William and his Family have reconciled
and have grown into adults. And the film will have an equally marvelous
effect on those who see it. A film steeped in charm, nostalgia and joy
for a time when innocents was both painful and blissful, and nothing to
be looked down upon. "Almost Famous" is one of this years best films.</P>
