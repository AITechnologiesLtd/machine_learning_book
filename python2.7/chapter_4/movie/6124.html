<P>     SWINGERS is the latest independent film success story.  Shot for 
approximately $250,000, the movie became the object of a bidding war.  
Miramax eventually secured the distribution rights, but only after 
agreeing to pay $5 million.  Director Doug Liman (who previously made a 
1994 movie called GETTING IN), producer Victor Simpkins, and 
writer/actor Jon Favreau were suddenly a lot more wealthy than they had 
ever expected to be.</P>
<P>     It's hard to understand why the film attracted so much attention.  
As Generation X comedies go, there's nothing remarkable about this one.  
It's basically the story of a twenty-something wannabe actor who, coming 
off a long-term relationship, has trouble meeting women.  There's a lot 
of male bonding going on here, and Quentin Tarantino's influence on the 
tone is apparent.  In short, this is familiar stuff that has been 
packaged slightly differently (and, considering the growing number of 
films borrowing from Tarantino's uniquely derivative style, the 
flavoring isn't all that unique).</P>
<P>     The central character is Mike (Jon Favreau), a New York native who 
moves to L.A. to pursue his acting career.  So far, he has managed to 
get a bit part in a movie and a job hosting an open mike night at a 
comedy club.  His trip west necessitated a breakup with his long-time 
girlfriend, and Mike misses her horribly.  Whenever he meets a girl, he 
inevitably starts telling her his "sad" story -- not a good way to start 
a potential romance.</P>
<P>     Mike has a "support group" of four male friends:  Trent (Vince 
Vaughn), Rob (Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn), and Charles (Alex 
Desert).  They decide to concentrate all their efforts on getting Mike 
some female companionship.  To that end, they drag him out of his tiny 
apartment and subject him to a trip to Las Vegas followed by stops at a 
number of parties and bars.  But Mike's dream girl continues to elude 
him.</P>
<P>     Even though the plot of SWINGERS could probably use an injection of 
originality, the script is littered with effective comedy.  In fact, 
several of the gags are sidesplitting.  One uses the JAWS theme to 
identify a predator at a party, another portrays a woman at a bar as a 
bunny, and a third has Mike wrestling with the problem of an answering 
machine message that cuts him off before he can leave his phone number.  
Then there's a hilariously bad jazz rendition of "Staying Alive" that 
will have SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER fans cringing.</P>
<P>     The film makers don't attempt to hide their infatuation with 
Tarantino, and elements of his style have wormed their way into the 
production.  Actor Vince Vaughn resembles the PULP FICTION director, 
both in terms of physical appearance and acting ability.  One of the 
characters has a RESERVOIR DOGS poster on his wall.  An argument about 
whether Tarantino borrowed from Scorsese provokes the comment that 
"everybody steals from everybody".  This is followed by a same-shot, 
same-angle, slo-mo recreation of the RESERVOIR DOGS opening with the 
characters of SWINGERS replacing Tarantino's unholy gang.</P>
<P>     The only actor to leave much of an impression is Jon Favreau, who 
does a good job emphasizing Mike's "everyman" quality.  Anyone (or at 
least any male) who has experienced romantic disappointment will relate 
to his situation.  His friends may not be the most sympathetic 
characters, but Mike's a likable guy.  The rest of the cast, with the 
exception of Heather Graham (who has a small role late in the film), is 
made up of largely-unfamiliar faces, none of whom displays much screen 
presence.</P>
<P>     Had SWINGERS been released five years ago, it would have been 
cutting-edge.  Even as recently as 1994, it would have been reasonably 
fresh.  But today, this kind of story -- a staple of low-budget features 
-- is getting awfully stale, and the injection of humor can't completely 
invigorate the proceedings.  SWINGERS is enjoyable in a shallow way, but 
there's nothing so special here that it warrants more than a cursory 
glance. </P>
