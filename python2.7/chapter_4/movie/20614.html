<PRE>JAKOB THE LIAR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Robin Williams's movies can be easily dichotomized into the brilliant
(AWAKENINGS and MRS. DOUBTFIRE) and the awful (FATHER'S DAY and PATCH
ADAMS).  JAKOB THE LIAR falls firmly into the latter category.</P>
<P>With an extremely underdeveloped script by the director, Peter
Kassovitz, the movie has maybe 10 minutes worth of ideas, which after
almost two hours it stretches way beyond the breaking point.  If it is
supposed to be a comedy, it's not a funny one, not even a laughably bad
one.  And, if Kassovitz intended to make a serious picture, then he
should have created characters that were more than stick figures.</P>
<P>The actors, who deliver uniformly bad performances, all fidget as if the
canteen on the set served only large mugs of strong coffee.  Watching
the actors cavort around is, frankly, rather embarrassing.  The movie is
one that will have you getting better acquainted with your watch.</P>
<P>The plot of the story is that Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) has a radio,
or so think his fellow members of the ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland.
Actually, Jakob only overheard a single broadcast on a radio belonging
to the Germans.  After that, he begins to make up news reports.
Sometimes he gets his stories all mixed up.  "Technically they're
retreating, but strategically they're advancing," he says of the Russian
soldiers that they hope will come soon to rescue them.</P>
<P>A non-religious Jew, Jakob says that "I know that we're the chosen
people; I just wish the Almighty had chosen someone else," repeating a
well-used line.  For his prevarication, he becomes known as Jakob the
Liar.</P>
<P>Some slightly whimsical music is about as funny as the movie ever gets.
The dialog for the serious parts is leaden ("Who knows more about human
relations than actors and barbers?" asks Alan Arkin's character.)</P>
<P>Overall, the story is so underdeveloped that it's almost inert.
Usually, when Robin Williams fails, it's with shamelessly schmaltzy
acting as in PATCH ADAMS.  This time he makes the mistake of offering
his viewers an almost lifeless character that makes passing the time
while waiting for the ending credits extremely tedious.  Let's hope that
next time will be one of his good movies.  He's due.  No -- we're due.</P>
<P>JAKOB THE LIAR runs a very long 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for violence
and disturbing images.  Think of the movie, with its scenes of graphic
torture, as an R.</P>
