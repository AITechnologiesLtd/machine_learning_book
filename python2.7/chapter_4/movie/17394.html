<P>Joseph Dorman's "Arguing the World" is a documentary study of the
careers of four celebrated Jewish intellectuals from immigrant working
class families who went to City College in the 1930s. While one of
them, Irving Howe, stayed more or less critical of American society,
the other three--Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer and Daniel
Bell--evolved from establishment liberalism in the 1950s to
neoconservativism in the Reagan era. I use the word career advisedly
in describing their paths. Perhaps the most honest account of what it
meant to belong to this group is found in Norman Podhoretz's "Making
It," where he admits that what motivated each shift in his political
or cultural affiliation was how it would it advance his career.</P>
<P>Although the film has almost zero value in conventional cinematic
terms, consisting mostly of talking heads, it has a powerful
cumulative effect as a psychological study. The skillfully conducted
interviews encourage the three neoconservatives to speak unguardedly
about their foibles and their ambitions. None makes the slightest
effort to prettify themselves. Howe serves as a counterpoint to the
other three, but even he does not come away unscathed. Although the
documentary does not come out and state it in as many words, the
conclusion it leaves you with is how all-powerful and ineluctable is
the tendency for American capitalism to subvert the critical impulse.</P>
<P>City College was a hothouse of radical politics in the 1930s and the
epicenter was the cafeteria which contained a number of alcoves where
different political tendencies would congregate. The Trotskyists and
anti-Stalinists could be found in alcove one. One anecdote reveals the
peculiar nature of the anti-Stalinist left at CCNY. One of the
regulars, who was gifted with a "foghorn voice," would hawk his
newspaper within earshot of the CP's alcove. He'd cry out, "Read all
about Stalin's murderous deeds" until one of the CP students would get
provoked into an argument with the ideological opponent. This is a
very sterile form of leftism that is obviously more geared to the head
than the heart. Polemics for the sake of polemics has marred the
Trotskyist movement since its inception. What the film reveals is that
the training the four received in the polemical art gave them the
skills they need to advance in the academic and journalistic
professions.</P>
<P>The film spends considerable time explaining the importance of
Partisan Review to their careers. Launched as a journal of the
political and cultural avant-garde, it became a place where
publication signified a certain level of achievement. In the late 30s
it was the sole voice for anti-Stalinist intellectuals and stood
against a well-entrenched universe of Popular Front publications and
institutions that defended the CP line. When the CP was in good graces
with the New Deal, getting published in such publications could open
doors in the larger world of journalism and the academy. After the
cold war started, the Partisan Review became much more useful
career-wise as the Soviet Union was turned into public enemy number
one.</P>
<P>For the three neoconservatives, publishing in Partisan Review served
as a springboard into academic careers. By the late 1940s all had shed
their radical beliefs and had gone to work for prestigious
universities. They admit that the post-WWII boom had a lot to do with
their political evolution. They never had it so good. For the first
time in their lives they could afford an automobile. Furthermore, the
hatred for "Stalinism" that they had cultivated in their youth had
helped to sharpen their skills as defenders of American foreign
policy. If one had a facile command of Stalin's crimes, there always
was a writing or speaking engagement on tap in the 1950s.</P>
<P>McCarthyism opened up a fault-line between the three and American
liberalism. Sneering at the civil liberties concerns of the liberal
establishment, they gave critical support to McCarthy. Nathan Glazer
admits in the film that their position was not "honorable" but,
shrugging his shoulders, questions whether any other position was
possible given their political evolution.</P>
<P>Nathan Glazer was hired by U. Cal-Berkeley, while Daniel Bell went to
work for Columbia. Both became enemies of the student radicalization.
While Glazer was opposed to the ban on political tabling on campus in
1964, he was even more opposed to the student sit-ins that were meant
to overturn the ban. Bell was on a professor's committee to end the
occupation of the administration building at Columbia in 1968. He was
puzzled by the refusal of the students to enter into a debate about
the role of the university. Both he and Glazer could not understand
that the student radicals of the 1960s had little interest in the sort
of scholastic wrangling that had marked their own undergraduate
political career.</P>
<P>Irving Howe had broken with this group in 1954 around the time he
launched Dissent Magazine. His intention was to promote a "democratic
socialism" which would retain the anti-Stalinist beliefs of his youth
while developing a critique of American society. He comes across as
tolerant of Bell and Glazer, while barely concealing his contempt for
Kristol who became strongly identified with the Reagan revolution.
What Howe shared with the other three was an inability to understand
the student radicalism of the 1960s. When he met Tom Hayden, then a
leader of SDS, he tried to get him to take a position on matters such
as the Moscow trials. Hayden found Howe's preoccupations irrelevant to
his own, which revolved around ending the war in Vietnam and racial
oppression. Beyond their ideological differences, Hayden found Howe's
style patronizing and offensively avuncular.</P>
<P>The thirties generation simply could not understand the 1960s. It was
by and large a rejection of the rigid categories that had been
established in the Stalin-Trotsky debate. After Marxism became an
attractive option for these 60s radicals, there was an unfortunate
tendency to gravitate to Marxist groups that still retained a lot of
the ideological baggage that people like Irving Howe were carrying.
Now that we have evolved past the sectarianism of the recent past, it
is useful to consider the more long-term challenge to independent,
radical critiques of American society which is embodied in the career
of the three neoconservatives.</P>
<P>In every other country in the world where there is a tradition of
Marxist thought, it is easier to make an affiliation with Marxism
either as an intellectual or an activist. The United States provides a
very hostile environment. Not only has it remained more prosperous, it
has also elevated rugged individualism to the level of a religion. The
average working person dreams of starting his own business, while the
left-wing journalist or academician is preoccupied with his career. As
"Arguing the World" reveals, when Marxism gets in the way of a career
move, it is excess baggage easily dumped overboard.</P>
<P>When the next upsurge of the radical movement takes place, one can
expect that the preoccupations of the CCNY crowd will have finally
been put to rest. Facilitating that will be the accomplished fact that
the Soviet Union no longer exists. Scraping away the barnacles of dead
dogmas is always a difficult task, but our job is easier now that the
institutional support for them has disappeared. Of course, there is
one last sect-cult that has to be confronted and that is belief in the
American free enterprise system itself.</P>
