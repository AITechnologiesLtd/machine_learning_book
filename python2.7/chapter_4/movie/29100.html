<PRE>_O_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Leave it to Hollywood to make a bold, challenging film for teens (and
adults) only to let it collect dust on a shelf as proposed release dates were
set, then scratched, many times over.  Such was the sad and unfair case with Tim
Blake Nelson's _O_, which original distributor Miramax seemed ready to consign
to direct-to-video oblivion after scuttling their final planned theatrical
release date in April 2001--three years after the film's production.  Luckily
for the film and audiences everywhere, Lions Gate came to the rescue of what is
by far the most successful modern-dress adaptation of a William Shakespeare
work--and the rare teen-targeted film to have something of real substance to
say.</P>
<P>        The "O" of the title is Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), the only black
student in a ritzy South Carolina prep school.  The star player of the
basketball team, Odin has the respect and love of his peers, not to mention the
team coach (Martin Sheen), who favors him over his own son, Hugo (Josh
Hartnett).  Bitter and jealous, Hugo sets out to destroy the too-trusting Odin
by planting seeds of doubt about his girlfriend Desi's (Julia Stiles) fidelity.</P>
<P>        Placing the Bard's _Othello_ in a modern high school context was a most
inspired idea on the part of director Nelson and screenwriter Brad Kaaya, for so
many elements in the original play so seamlessly translate to the charged
atmosphere and psychology of adolescence: the destructive rumors that are too
easily taken for truth (in a way, _O_ the cautionary tale last year's horrid
_Gossip_ wanted to be); the unspoken but ever-present prejudices; the selfish
pride; and--perhaps most crucially--the melodramatic tendency to blow petty
events and any resulting emotions into an out-of-proportion life-and-death
matter.  That last point in mind, the story's inevitable leap to violence is all
the more real--and hence more disturbing and deeply tragic.</P>
<P>        The emotional intimacy and intensity of the piece owes a huge debt to
the performers.  The charismatic Phifer is a perfect match for the charming and
(over)confident Odin; his natural likability makes his simmering jealousy and
rage that much more upsetting.  Before that happens, though, he forges a strong
rapport with the radiant Stiles; their early scenes have a genuine tenderness
that doesn't come off as sticky.  Delivering the breakthrough turn is Hartnett,
who wisely eschews the urge to overplay; his rather quiet, understated turn adds
to the menace of the character, not to mention it makes Odin's misguided but
unwavering faith in him easy to swallow.</P>
<P>        Nelson, however, deserves most of the credit for making a Shakespeare
play not only work but feel relevant in a contemporary context.  A part of that
success is definitely due to his and Kaaya's decision to not retain the
Shakespearean dialogue, which had such a distancing effect in Baz Luhrmann's
_Romeo_+_Juliet_ and Michael Almereyda's _Hamlet_.  It may not retain the Bard's
words, but _O_ works better than those films due to a fidelity of a different
kind: that to the spirit of original piece.  There's no blatant pandering to
youth (as in _R+J_'s quick-cut, MTV-ready eye candy) or contemporary audiences
in general (_Hamlet_'s aggressive push of modern settings and products, as in
the infamous Blockbuster Video-set "To be or not to be" scene).  _O_ is as
unflinchingly dark as its source material, and seeing the physically and
emotionally violent story play out--with little strain in believabilty--in the
here and now just makes it more unsettling.</P>
<P>        Miramax failed to see the big picture with _O_, zeroing in its violent
content without paying attention to context; as such, the film's release was
tabled countless times due to real-life instances of high school bloodshed. 
It's quite a sad statement on the movie industry that between '98 and now, a
number of youth-targeted films--be them of the horror, action, or even comedy
genres--that exploited violence as a means of stimulation have easily seen
release while a film that seriously deals with the issue and its aftereffects
has had to languish in limbo.  _O_ is the type of film that one should want to
release in the aftermath of a high school shooting: a film where the acts of
violence are shocking not because of graphic gore or sensationalism, but because
one can profoundly feel the lives being destroyed.</P>
