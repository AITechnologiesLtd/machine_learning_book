<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The world is a hostile place for Sam Peckinpah who in his first feature,
which is set in the Arizona around "Old Tucson" in the 1860s, has
created a very telling and powerful film, even though the director was
disturbed that studio honchos changed some scenes. It's a routine
revenge western but, nevertheless, has elements of the quirkiness
Peckinpah's films will later on become reknown for. Maureen O'Hara is
worried about what the town women of Gila City think of her ever since
she landed there without a husband and a son, and because of her
husband's death was forced to work in a dance hall saloon. Brian Keith,
"called Yellowleg," is a former Union sergeant who has become obsessed
with how he looks to others without his hat, as for the last 5 years he
has been tracking down the Confederate deserter who tried to scalp him
while drunk and left him badly scarred. Chill Wills is a deranged
monster who is being hunted by Keith, who dreams of getting enough gold
to get an empire, with him the general, in the barren land of the
Arizona frontier where he hopes to buy Indian slaves to work his land
and for them to fight in his army. Steve Cochran is a fancy dressing
ex-Confederate and current gunslinger who is Keith's rival. He is crime
partners with Chill and has the hots for Maureen.</P>
<P>The film opens as Keith will save Chill from being hung as a card cheat
and will lead him and his partner Cochrane to the next town, by telling
them the bank there is easy to rob.</P>
<P>In that backward frontier town of Gila, Maureen attends a church service
and hears the women say nasty things about her character behind her
back, but loud enough so that she can hear them.</P>
<P>Keith suffers from a shoulder wound that is so bad he can't fire his gun
accurately as he visits the town doctor, but he refuses an operation
because the doctor says it'll take a month to heal and he can't wait.</P>
<P>When some outlaws rob a store in town, Keith tries to stop them but by
accident kills the only one in the world Maureen loves, her young son.
Keith admits to her he did it, and when she insists that she wants to
bury her son with his father in the ghost town Siringo in order to prove
to all concerned that she had a husband, Keith offers to go with her
since the town is in the middle of hostile Apache territory.</P>
<P>Maureen wants nothing to do with him or his other deadly companions, but
they tag along anyway, making for an unlikely foursome. In one quirky
scene, a band of drunken Indians rides by with a stagecoach they
attacked, as the Indians parody that robbery.</P>
<P>The revenge motive is so strong for Keith, that he has trouble not
becoming an animal like Chill, as he tells Maureen he didn't kill him
yet because he wants him to die slowly when he scalps him. A slow
romance builds between Keith and Maureen, as she tells him she can
forgive him for what he has done and expects him to come to his senses
about Chill, saying she couldn't love a cold-blooded murderer.</P>
<P>This film is visually powerful in spots, as it overcomes its routine
theme with burning images of lust, greed, and hatred. Maureen sings the
film's theme song during the opening and closing credits.</P>
