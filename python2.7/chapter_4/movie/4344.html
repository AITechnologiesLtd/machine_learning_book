<PRE>                           THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1995 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     From the very start, with the Victorian calligraphy as the
background for the blooming flowers during the credits, to the first
scenes inside an opera house, with Gounod's "Faust" being performed, to
the next set of views touring a splendidly highbrow 1870s New York
mansion overflowing with a decor of velvet, art and stuffed mannequins
as people, viewers are gasping at the implausibility: Can this really
be a Martin Scorsese picture?  Based on Edith Wharton's 1921 Pulitzer
prize-winning novel about ill-conceived and hypocritical American
upper-class adoption of European sophistication, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
at first glances might seem the atmospheric product of James Ivory and
Ismail Merchant.  Hard to believe, but Scorsese equals them: made in
honor of one of his favorite movies THE HEIRESS, and designed by Dante
Ferretti, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE looks like a gilded age vision by
Luchino Visconti, John De Cuir or John Box, and there's an undeniable
resemblance to Ingmar Bergman's FANNY AND ALEXANDER.  Like Bergman's
feast, Scorsese's is so fancy and rich in detail--everything's splashed
as layouts from Architectural Digest and Gourmet magazines--that you
could get woozy and may have to hit the smelling salts.  (Because
Bergman packed in so much demonstrative warmth, some of us regretted
not taking along the Vivirin.)  But in perhaps the only touch of
modernity that Scorsese risks in this his most audacious movie is that
he allows the unrequited love between Wharton's soon-to-be-married
Newland Archer and the rumored-to-be-loose Countess Ellen Olenska to
not only sadden but also anger us.  This isn't just a story or picture
about stifling customs of denial or high society values; it's a story
and picture about our hypocrisy over values--relinquishing ourselves
to others' demands of imperatives we don't believe in.</P>
<P>     Though David Lean was first in bringing E. M. Forster to the
screen, with the pumped-up nothingness of A PASSAGE TO INDIA, most
viewers rightly believe that Ivory and Merchant have more successfully
brought the genteel sage to film in A ROOM WITH A VIEW, MAURICE and
HOWARDS END.  I've read in some national magazines that Scorsese's
among the first to bring Wharton to viewing audiences, but this isn't
so: the honorable ETHAN FROME was delivered three months prior, and
came and went in a flash.  (Maybe because Liam Neeson needed a co-star
with at least as much of passion.)  Wharton's THE OLD MAID was a 1935
award-winning play adapted by Zoe Atkins,and later a 1939 soaper
starring Bette Davis.  And deep into forgotten movie trivia is
Wharton's 1922 THE GLIMPSES OF THE MOON, made into a film that featured
dialogue titles by F.  Scott Fitzgerald, and there was a forgettable
stage version of AGE starring Katharine Cornell and Franchet Tone.  But
Scorsese picked the right Wharton material as his first foray into the
genre of American period piece: his two lovers are ruled by a snobbery
of class not too much unlike the sociopaths and goons who rule over
their victims in his charged-up modern Americana.  The central
difference, of course, is that there are no bloody corpses as
pornography, though one could argue the lavish spreads of settings and
food in AGE are rather porno-ish in their arbitrariness.  Yet that's
part of the appeal of Wharton: as much as she's criticizing the social
dictums by which her characters are forced to live, she's trapped them
in orgies of addicting lushness.  And Wharton herself more than most:
she was born into and lived the exceedingly pampered life of high
social class New York.  (Like Mark Twain before her and F.  Scott
Fitzgerald after, she did much of her writing in the comfort of her
bed.  Once, when she discovered that a hotel room bed did not face the
light, she flew into a "fit of hysterics.") She was both protege of and
 travelling companion to Henry James, who is the most obvious influence
on her as a writer: she picked up the exactitude of James's prose
style, as well as interlacing her narratives with biting commentary,
just as James did, especially in his THE BOSTONIANS, the seminal work
out of which THE AGE OF INNOCENCE might have sprung.  (Ironically,
James Ivory directed the movie version of the pungently observed
BOSTONIANS, and turned it into an undertaker's adaptation--all laid out
and ready for burial.)  Wharton, who was actually born in France and
was the first woman win a Pulitizer Prise and receive an honorary
degree from Yale, would perform readings, often at her chateau in
Hyeres, of her works-in-progress in front of James and French novelist
Paul Bourget, both of whom specialized in the psychological.</P>
<P>     The gamble for Scorsese is that he didn't give in to what the
movie audience is longing for--the coming together of Countess Olenska
and Newland Archer.  (Newbold is, by the way, Wharton's middle name.)
Had he done so, only the purists would have howled, because our
feelings of distrust for the dictates of others are blood-raw right
now.  That's why the conclusion gets to us in ways we're not prepared
for: we can feel the pain in what the two doomed lovers are forced not
to do--that there would be no real shame in flaunting disregard,
especially in that divorce was already legally sanctioned by the state
at the time.  Wharton's caution, one that Scorsese is surprisingly
subtle in delivering, is that the waste is even more hurting because
these lovers are conspired against to prevent what the conspirators
realize is much more than a flirtation.  Olenska and Archer become
victims to false propriety; they suspect it, the conspirators
definitely know it, and we are left to suffer it.  THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
is a march to folly, and in his only truly fine scenes, coming at a bon
voyage dinner and at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis, as Newland, forces us
to grieve for his loss, his own lack of courage.  The audience in the
theatre fell dead-silent as Newland, bracing himself with his cane as
if it's his only fortitude, makes his decision, and for seconds
afterwards no one moved.</P>
<P>     When casting was announced, no one assumed Daniel Day-Lewis was
wrong for the part of Archer, but there were rumblings about Michelle
Pfeiffer as Olenska and Winona Ryder as Archer's soon-to-be-wife May
Welland.  It's the snot in those who bitched: somehow the prestigious
Day-Lewis belongs in period costume, and Pfeiffer, despite being in
DANGEROUS LIAISONS, and Ryder, despite being in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
and LITTLE WOMEN, might not.  But the tables turned and it's Day-Lewis
who isn't quite suited for this story.  No one can call him bad, but
he's mostly unaffecting--until, of course, the ending.  He seems
disassembled--parts of him are there in a corner, weak and prissy and
always it seems on the verge of tears; parts of him seem disbelievingly
mansion-sized self-assured; parts of him simply don't make sense--like
defending Countess Olenska in the first third of the story and then
later denying himself the pleasures of his conquest.  (We're talking
about a 1870s New York City, which even then was a thriving metropolis,
so did no snob ever utilize the city's largeness as a cloak of
privacy?)  Some of his scenes with Pfeiffer bring to mind Jeremy Irons'
Charles Smithson in THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN.  Day-Lewis can be
all of many things, and all at once, because he's one of the few very
physically thin actors who imparts evolutionary credence; his frame has
the uncanny ability to transmogrify itself.  (In close-up, he's got a
jutting jaw that we can sometimes get lost in.)  Not yet the equivalent
of Olivier, he is the other side of the Atlantic's version of our
Dustin Hoffman.  But since MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE, wherein he's
indescribably right as a gay punker, he's become an icon of fakery.
The smart set's still raving about his Tomas in Philip Kaufman's THE
UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, in which he plays, of all things, a
sex-obsessed brain surgeon-turned-window washer.  He pours on the
illicit naughty boy charm so thickly that it would be understand ably
easy to assume he's sexy.  Not quite; he's a vacuum--using his brows
and the whites of his eyes and a day or two's growth of beard against
his dark skin and his slinkiness to project the image of sexuality.
Behind the facade is something limp: he's like a young Bradford
Dillman, with just a hint of a satyric Rip Torn--only beautified.  That
women peel off their clothes for him as soon as he bats his moody eyes
is fantasy, and it's charming in a feathery way, but what's missing is
the heat of his seductions--they're as cold as UNBEARABLE's
atmosphere.  (He confirms the maxim that sometimes sex is best when
it's confined to our imagination.)  Wearing a top hat and heavily
starched collars with more comic aplomb than any actor since Fred
Astaire, he was a scream in an unexpected take-off as E.M. in Forster's
own A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  (A minority view--no one I kno w agrees.)
While recognizing the torture in his greatness as Christy Brown in MY
LEFT FOOT, I'm simply not a good enough human being to have been able
to sit through its entirety.  Yet what I derived out of what I saw is
what has come to fore in Day-Lewis in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS and now
here in AGE.  He's endlessly posing, alternately a still life of agony
or an insufferable smoothie, dangerously self-satisfied with his own
reflection.  Though only the meteorologists earned their pay for
MOHICANS (and 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE: when have two movies in the
same year ever been so misty, foggy, cloudy, rainy, hazy?), Day-Lewis,
in long hair and plentiful goodness, reminds us of Jeffrey Hunter's
emblematic Christ in KING OF KINGS; he even resembles Hunter throughout
the picture.  It was during MOHICANS that I started to feel unsettled
about Day-Lewis, and the way in which Scorsese and cinematographer
Michael Ballhaus defer to him here in AGE--and it starts with the very
first shot of him--I don't think it's at all too early to consider
that, in what may be his "artistry," he's becoming the movies' most
accomplished con.  David Strathairn would have been my choice for
Newland.</P>
<P>     Scorsese admitted in interviews that he in fact did defer a bit to
Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer.  He mentioned that in the time between
leaving their dress rooms and arriving on set, a transformation had
occurred, that he began to believe his actors were the very parts they
were playing, that he began to speak to them in hushed Whartonian
tones.  If Day-Lewis wallows in it too much, Pfeiffer keeps her wits
about her and does to us what she didn't quite succeed in doing in
DANGEROUS LIAISONS--get us to believe she belongs in antique
melodrama.  Her voice is the key, I think: it has that slightly pitched
quality that happens to women of leisure, women who resign, though
maybe not privately accept, that they're chattel to be displayed as
pretty possessions.  Ten years ago, Meryl Streep would have played this
part but her voice, so theatrically calibrated, would have betrayed the
novelist.  (Even if unintentional, Pfeiffer honors Streep by pirating
Sarah Woodruff's curly do.)  Olenska has a bit of Wharton in her, in
that the novelist was likewise strapped by a loveless marriage, and in
Olenska is a homage to one of James' leading ladies in THE
BOSTONIANS--Verena, the young, red-haired feminist spitfire.  But
Pfeiffer borrows from neither: this is her own portrait of a woman
accepting defeat by convention and patronage.  It's a performance built
by mystery; there's no way for us to gauge her inner-feelings about the
events by which she's stoically forced into acquiescence.  (Only once
does the performance lose focus: in a living room, she's smoking but
the cigarette doesn't appear to be lit and when she exhales, no smoke
comes out.)  In DANGEROUS LIAISONS, as the sickly pale-faced Mme. de
Tourvel, enduring medicinal therapies rented from Ken Russell's THE
DEVILS, she seemed nearly out of her league against Glenn Close's
venomous Marquise.  Sublimely controlled as she dons her war paint,
Close out-Sondergaards Gale Sondergaard and not even John Malkovich's
devilishly puffed-up, wantonly vain Vicomte can altogether match her
merciless glaze.  (Wouldn't Close make a fab Madame Ming?)  Next to
John Gielgud, no performer has stolen scenes with more graceful
arrogance and confidence.  As a result, save for a scene or two,
Pfeiffer is just about thrown right out of the picture.  You begin to
feel a strange, unwarranted sympathy for her; you tend to want to
forget she's even in the picture.  She didn't have to do anything in
TEQUILA SUNRISE except look beautiful, and she does, and she gives her
lines a crisp, singular reading.  She did the same in MARRIED TO THE
MOB, aided by the funny Mercedes Ruehl.  Looking sensationally sexy in
THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS she does a terrific "My Funny Valentine," and
she sure knows how to rummage through her purse for and light up her
Parisian Opals and she does a great slip off her feet into Jeff
Bridges's arms as they're dancing to "Moonglow" on a hotel room
balcony.  (The semi-downer ending, though, makes us ask, "Why
bother?")  I had some sympathy for her in BATMAN RETURNS: in spite of
the trash the costumers put her in, and acknowledging that she has a
wicked whiplash, she's stuck in the horror of one unplayable scene
after another.  How she managed to keep her self-respect is beyond me.
(The most clever thing about that bumme r is the Queen's Coat that the
Penguin wears; when he's walking around the cemetery where his parents
are buried, he looks like something out of a novel by Dickens.)</P>
<P>     Out of Dickens as well, and crossed with Aunt Pittypat from GWTW,
Miriam Margolyes gives the audience its best laugh as moneybags Mrs.
Manson Mingott.  Unfortunately looking none too well, the late Alexis
Smith is New York's numero uno grand dame.  Had she been aided by the
right kind of and more sensitive makeup artist, she'd have passed for
Wharton.  (This small part quite a contrast to Miss Smith's last TV
role--as Rebecca's former school teacher who still has enough sexual
power to charge Sam's batteries in CHEERS.)  Chubby in the face, Mary
Beth Hurt is nearly unrecognizable as Mrs. Beaufort.  As her
philandering cad of a husband, Stuart Wilson could be doing a tribute
to Rod Steiger's Komarovsky from DOCTOR ZHIVAGO And it takes a while to
get our bearings and recognize him and remember when last we might have
seen him: as Major Clark, who impregnates Sarah Layton, in THE JEWEL IN
THE CROWN.  Last, but not least (because of the rest of the supporting
cast is very good), there's Winona Ryder.  The breathless May will only
succeed if Ryder can pull off the coup de theatre.  If we hate the
character for doing it, whether we know it's coming or not, then Ryder
can only be applauded.  The act is not only one of desperation, but the
pinnacle of despised entrapment.</P>
<P>     In MAUGHAM, biographer Ted Morgan writes that W. Somerset "was
exasperated by the rightness and exactness of everything Edith Wharton
said." He was particularly out of joint by her usage of the word "no,"
for he "had never heard a more frigid syllable of disapproval." Maugham
snarled, "Her manner was that of a woman to whom a man has made
proposals offensive to her modesty, but which good breeding tells her
it will be more dignified to ignore than to make a scene about."
Indeed, the very essence of Wharton as social prisoner and writer: she
was on the side of the expression of love and sex but never had much
guts to engage in either.  Perhaps Wharton was poisoned by her mother's
frigidity, which might also have helped make her the anti-feminist she
appeared to be, in that she opposed education of women for high
professions, didn't exercise her right to vote, nor bothered to invite
other women to social parties she threw.  Maybe she was further
poisoned by her supposed love affair with bisexual Morton Fullerton.
(A recent biographer suggests Wharton was both homophobic and
anti-Semitic, an d disapproved of such writers as Joyce and Lawrence;
one wonders if she was truly aware of Henry James' predilections.) It's
this Victorian vengeance in her writing that's regretful and sad--and
painful for audiences watching AGE:  she's compulsive about punishing
her fictional lovers.  (She punished them in ETHAN FROME, too.)
Scorsese caught this, but he didn't do it alone: TIME critic Jay Cocks
ferreted out the Wharton upbraidings and helped shape them into a
screenplay that not only envenoms denied passions but also exalts the
power of words.  This is what's surprisingly wonderful about the
movie:  in the past we've come to expect that we're going to get
short-changed when moviemakers bring the classics to screen--images
over words or vice versa, debatable truncation.  It's thrilling to not
only hear the text captured with this much respect, but to see the
images come close to matching the era is almost unnerving: included are
reel life versions of Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the
Island of La Grande Jatte" and winter scenes by Richard Hartmann and
Childe Hassam.  And there's a happy marriage of editing and text:
Thelma Schoonmaker (who gets her name plastered as an advertisement
within the movie) lays on montages of messages and invitations that
enhance the art of personal writing.  (Experts in communication
believed that on-line services might resurrect this art form; it turns
out that e-mail & uploads have degenerated into "it sucks" brevity.)
THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is so respectful of Wharton that her running
commentary is voiced over by Joanne Woodward, caught as if
parenthetical privacies whispered for our ears only.  The only damn
thing wrong with this feast is that after it ended, I felt like
sneaking into a Weight Watchers meeting.</P>
