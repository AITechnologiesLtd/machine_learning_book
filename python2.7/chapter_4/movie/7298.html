<P>     SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is an international thriller with a sci-fi
twist.  And, though that twist may be difficult for some folks to warm
up to, all the other essential ingredients are here to make a mystery
nifty:  a tough-as-nails heroine (Julia Ormond, who, even as an ice
queen, is still the Most Beautiful Woman in the World), a shady sup-
porting character-turned-love interest (Gabriel Byrne), a child in peril
(albeit, with distress shown in flashback), and the ever-extending
tentacles of a big, bad corporation.  Great location work, too, in both
Denmark and Greenland.  SMILLA is a bit butt-numbing toward the end, but
who won't be taken back a double decade by the sight of Richard Harris
out on an ice flow?  Anyone up for an ORCA revival?</P>
