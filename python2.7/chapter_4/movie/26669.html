<P>_Book_of_Shadows:_Blair_Witch_2_ (R) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Much like how _The_Exorcist_ begat _Exorcist_II:_The_Heretic_, last
year's shock success _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ has spawned a baffling and
altogether atrocious follow-up, _Book_of_Shadows:_Blair_Witch_2_.  Less a
sequel than an extremely loose spinoff--which has just about nothing to
do with either part of its title,  I might add--this film won't win over
the original's many detractors, and it is certain to incense the first's
cult of ardent supporters.</P>
<P>Director Joe Berlinger has described _Book_of_Shadows_ as an
"anti-sequel," and the premise he and writing collaborator Dick Beebe
(_BWP_ writers-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez only take an
executive producing credit here) does hold some potential for an
interesting deconstruction of not merely the first _Blair_Witch_, but the
pop culture phenomenon it created.  _BW2_ doesn't take place in the same
"universe" inhabited by the original's characters of Heather, Mike, and
Josh; it takes place in the world of the here and now--that is, a world
where _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ is a blockbuster movie that has sent
tourism soaring in the filming location of Burkittsville, Maryland.  The
film opens with a witty faux-documentary segment that succinctly covers
the media frenzy around the film and fans' obsession with all things
Blair.</P>
<P>Once the nominal plot kicks in after the credit roll, _BW2_ begins is
big downhill plunge.  Among the many _BWP_ fans who have flocked to those
familiar woods is the "Blair Witch Hunt" tour group: Jeff (Jeffrey
Donovan), the tour organizer and former mental patient; Erica (Erica
Leerhsen), a practicing Wiccan who wants debunk the negative perception
of her religion; Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner), a supernatural skeptic
who is writing a book on the Blair Witch myth with his pregnant believer
girlfriend Tristen (Tristen Skyler); and Kim (Kim Director), token Goth
chick.  They set up camp at the ruins of the house featured in _BWP_'s
finale, and after a night of hard drinking, everyone wakes up the next
morning to find all their video equipment destroyed--and their memory
similarly damaged; no one has any recollection of all that went on that
night, let alone falling asleep.  Perhaps holding the answers are their
mysteriously untouched videotapes, and the five retreat to Jeff's
abandoned warehouse home to study them.</P>
<P>Given that _The_Blair_Witch_Project_'s ambiguous, debatable ending was a
major reason for the film's cult status, it was perhaps a wise move on
the part of Berlinger and Beebe to not offer any explanation about what
exactly happened.  I don't think anyone goes into _Book_of_Shadows_
expecting to find any specific answers about the first film's doomed
trio, anyway; however, I'm sure the common expectation is for some
additional background on the Blair Witch.  Alas, what the audience gets
is a repetitive and incredibly tedious chain of events where the five
have strange hallucinations when not watching playback of their
videotapes.  A few oblique references are made to the Blair Witch legend,
but they will be largely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't done
extensive pre-viewing research at the Blair Witch website.  Unlike the
original film, where the expanded backstory works as an enhancement to a
stand-alone film, it's practically required reading if one wants to make
sense of whatever place _BW2_ has in the larger mythology--though even
Blair Witch fanatics may have difficulty sorting it all out as well.</P>
<P>But ties to the bigger Blair Witch picture are secondary to the casual
viewer, who simply wants to be scared.  Not only is there anything
remotely spooky to be found in _Book_of_Shadows_, no sense of suspense is
ever generated due to a self-defeating storytelling choice: flash
forwards.  In haphazardly jumping back and forth in time, Berlinger
indiscreetly gives away who exactly will survive and who will die, not to
mention the exact fate of these survivors; throughout the film he even
drops not-so-subtle hints--visual ones, no less--of what went down during
those missing hours.  With all its secrets and would-be shocks more than
telegraphed far in advance, there is a dull inevitability attached to
what should have been the film's "climactic" moments.</P>
<P>So, for most of _Book_of_Shadows_, one wonders what Berlinger's
intentions were, he clearly didn't set out to make the simple scary movie
everyone wants and expects.  The answer finally comes in the film's final
moments, which indeed reveals an aim "above" standard genre satisfaction:
to address the zeitgeist question of popular entertainment's connection
to real-life crime.  It's an admirable goal within the context of a
horror film, but there's a fine line between "ambitious" and
"pretentious."  By not offering anything fresh nor particularly
insightful on the subject, and without going about it in an entertaining
nor convincing way (the abysmal acting--or, rather, yelling--sends any
foundation in reality out the window), Berlinger and his empty
_Book_of_Shadows_ end up on the wrong side of that line.</P>
