<P>In The Faculty, little slimy aliens take over an entire school.  They
start with the football coach (Robert Patrick), and move their way
through the principal (Bebe Neuwirth), some of the teachers (Piper
Laurie, Daniel Von Bargen, Famke Janssen, Salma Hayek), and then move on
to the students.  So, naturally, it falls into the hands of our
protagonists to stop the alien invasion:  computer-nerd Casey (Elijah
Wood), tomboy Stokely (Clea DuVall), cool drug-dealing Zeke (Josh
Hartnett), football kid Stan (Shawn Hatosy), superficial cheerleader
Delilah (Jordana Brewster), and innocent Souther girl Marybeth (Laura
Harris).  Along the way, there are plenty of violent deaths and a whole
lot of movie references.  </P>
<P>I like writer Kevin Williamson's self-conscious horror films better
than most horror films.  They certainly overpower the numbing badness of
recent horror junk like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (although,
oddly enough, Williamson did write the original Summer flick) and
Disturbing Behavior.  He's clearly a man who has seen a lot of movies,
judging from the constant barrage of movie references through all of the
films that he's written (the Scream movies are basically 90-minute
movies references, actually).  The Faculty is sufficiently aware of its
own silliness to pass the time pleasantly.  It rather reminded me of
Deep Rising, which was similar in it's sci-fi/horror/comedy approach.</P>
<P>Some are calling The Faculty a science-fiction thriller, but it really
isn't.  I don't even think it attempts to be.  All of the science (the
silly explanations about how the aliens survive, for instance) is
intentionally dumb, and never tries to be serious (unlike Phantoms,
which came out earlier this year and takes itself entirely seriously). 
The Faculty is strictly a horror film, with some comedy thrown in for
good measure.  And it's not a great movie, but it's inoffensive and it
has some fun scenes.  Directed by Robert Rodriguez with the same kind of
visual flair that he's shown in previous films (even the terrible From
Dusk Till Dawn), The Faculty has the look and feel of an efficient
thriller, even though it is mostly played for laughs.  The giant digital
slugs that appear later in the film are nicely done, and most of the
violence dances skillfully between disgusting and funny.  </P>
<P>And funny it is; Williamson's dialogue is sharp, and I found myself
laughing often (Stokely's constant insults are very amusing).  The movie
is not played for scares very often; there are some exciting sequences
(the first scene, with Bebe Neuwirth running away from Robert Patrick,
is well-done), but mostly it's just for fun.  The actors are appealing,
especially young Elijah Wood (I'm glad he hasn't met the fate of other
child actors), and the film is just a lot of fun.  I think it might lift
from one too many horror films (The Thing, especially); Williamson still
hasn't proved to me that he can come up with something really original,
but the way he keeps reshaping the stuff we've seen is good enough for
now.</P>
