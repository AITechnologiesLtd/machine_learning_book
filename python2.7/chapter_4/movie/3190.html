                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Occasionally, a film will contain performances that are so strong
that they are able to help it to get past major problems.  NELL is a
good example of this.  The performances by Liam Neeson, Natasha
Richardson, and especially Jodie Foster make the film worth seeing
despite some major miscalculations with the story.</P>
<P>     The title character (Foster) is a young woman who grew up in an
isolated cabin in the woods.  Her mother had escaped from civilization
after being raped (Nell was conceived from the rape).  After the death
of the mother, Nell is discovered by a group that included country
doctor Jerry Lovell (Neeson).  Nell is totally unaccustomed to
strangers and speaks a language that only she understands.  After the
court gives Lovell thirty days to prove that Nell is capable of living
outside of a mental institution, he begins a determined effort to learn
to communicate with him.  The mental institution is represented by Dr.
Paula Olsen (Richardson) who also goes to the woods to observe Nell.</P>
<P>     By far, this film's greatest strength is Jodie Foster's
wonderfully nuanced performance in the title role.  Since the majority
of Nell's dialog is in an unfamiliar language, Foster is required to
convey virtually all of the character's thoughts and feelings through a
combination of body language, facial expressions, and vocal
inflection.  Just as the characters in the film need to struggle a bit
to understand what Nell is trying to express, her emotions need to
sometimes seem a bit opaque to the audience as well.  Foster is able to
strike this difficult balance.  As Drs. Lovell and Olsen are learning
more about the character, we too become aware of new nuances to
Foster's performance.  A second viewing of this film is probably
necessary to fully appreciate what Foster has accomplished.</P>
<P>     Some critics may be tempted to dismiss Foster's performance as a
flashy grab for an Oscar, but that isn't really fair.  Foster has
already proven herself to be one of the finest actors of her generation
(she won 2 Oscars in the last 5 years) so it seems genuinely believable
that she was primarily attracted by the pure challenge of this role.
Nell is a complex and fascinating character and Foster does a very
impressive job bringing her to life.</P>
<P>     In the shadow of Foster's performance, Neeson and Richardson may
not receive the recognition that they deserve for their work in this
film.  During most of the film, Neeson essentially serves as a stand-in
for the audience.  Neeson shows Dr. Lovell's constant search for a
better understanding of Nell's behavior while also standing back to
allow the audience to discover her secrets themselves. Neeson was
required to give a quiet, subtle, primarily reactive performance and he
plays it very well.</P>
<P>     Richardson also finds just the right note with her performance.
She plays a skeptic in the film who initially questions Nell's
intelligence and competence, but eventually is turned around through
her first-hand observations.  She manages to believably show this
initial skepticism while avoiding the temptation to allow the character
to become unlikable.  Her character grows through knowledge, but does
not undergo radical personality changes.</P>
<P>     In real life, Neeson and Richardson are husband and wife.  Their
obvious natural chemistry serves the film well when their characters
begin the inevitable romance.  The most interesting aspect of the
on-screen relationship is the basically >parental< relationship that
they form with Nell.  Just like a real-life parent/child relationship,
Drs. Lovell and Olsen both provide Nell with knowledge and learn from
her themselves.</P>
<P>     While the three lead performances are terrific, the script by
William Nicholson and Mark Handley (based on Handley's play
"Idoglossia") has some very serious problems.  To put it simply, the
film is overplotted.  When the film concentrates on the 2 doctors'
exploration of Nell's world and Nell's introduction to the civilized
world, the film is fascinating.  Unfortunately, Nicholson and Handley
insisted on adding artificial conflict.</P>
<P>     In a film that absolutely did not need a literal villain, they
added Richard Libertini as the head of the mental health institute.  He
plays a highly cliched bureaucrat who appears heartless in his efforts
to have Nell institutionalized.  His character is completely
one-dimensional and uninteresting.  This subplot takes over the last
part of the film with some unnecessary sequences with Nell committed to
the cold, unpleasant institution.  It finally leads to an absolutely
ludicrous courtroom finale.</P>
<P>     The film is also undermined by an unfortunate subplot involving a
group of country rednecks who try to terrorize Nell.  The film briefly
introduces the interesting idea of the press reaction to Nell's
existence, but that idea is left generally undeveloped (except as a
plot device in the mental institution subplot).</P>
<P>     The one other major mistake was the use of occasional flashbacks
that reveal to the audience the origins of Nell's language before the
characters in the film learn it.  This is information that would have
had more impact had it been revealed in a more subtle manner.  Taking
an omniscient view for this one plot element just doesn't work.</P>
<P>     Despite these mistakes, the parts of the film that do work are
very good.  If the script had jettisoned these unnecessary subplots, it
could have been quite a remarkable film.  I'm not familiar with
Handley's original play, but I tend to wonder if some of these extra
elements might have been added in an attempt to "open up" the story for
the screen.  The film's best elements seem like they would also work
well on the stage while the less successful parts probably would have
been even more blatantly out of place in a play.</P>
<P>     Visually, NELL is a >very< good looking film.  Director Michael
Apted and cinematographer Dante Spinotti use shadows and dark lighting
very effectively to establish mood and tone.  Much of the film takes
place at night, but it is never too dark for the audience to see what
is going on.  Spinotti widescreen photography includes many attractive
scenery shots, but never spends too much time dwelling on them.  The
film is further enhanced by Mark Isham's lively but unobtrusive score.</P>
<P>     NELL is a flawed film, but one that is very much worth seeing for
the wonderful leading performances.  With a tighter script it could
have been one of the year's best films.  In its final form, it is still
a very good one.</P>
