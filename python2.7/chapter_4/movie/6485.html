<P>     The presence of Jack Lemmon isn't the only reason why MY FELLOW 
AMERICANS could be dubbed GRUMPY EX-PRESIDENTS.  Here, with James Garner 
filling the Walter Matthau role (while Matthau was busy filming his own 
alternate take on THE ODD COUPLE, I'M NOT RAPPAPORT), the barbed, 
pseudo-hostile banter is familiar.  Ultimately, this is a buddy movie, 
and if you can't guess the outcome ten minutes into the film, you're 
just not familiar enough with the formula.</P>
<P>     What makes MY FELLOW AMERICANS watchable -- although there are 
times when it verges on not being so -- is the humor.  The screenplay is 
lame when it comes to action and drama, but a fair share of the comedy, 
though it may be bawdy and in poor taste, is actually funny.  No matter 
how tiresome you find the material, MY FELLOW AMERICANS is almost 
guaranteed to provoke a few, hearty laughs.  If only the framing story 
was better...</P>
<P>     It's a simple enough premise.  Jack Lemmon plays Republican ex-
President Kramer, who was voted out of office seven years ago after 
serving one term.  James Garner is Democrat ex-President Douglas, who 
succeeded Kramer, but, like him, only survived for four years in the 
White House.  Since their ouster from office, both men have been 
struggling to find things to do.  Kramer writes cookbooks and makes 
inspirational speeches for private corporations.  Douglas tries to pen 
his memoirs, but has more fun sleeping with his editor.  </P>
<P>     Dan Aykroyd plays the current Commander-in-Chief, Republican 
President Haney (Kramer's former Vice President).  When a scandal 
surrounding his administration gets out of control, Kramer and Douglas 
are unwittingly pulled into it.  Suddenly, these two life-long enemies 
are on the run together, with a crazed hitman (Everett McGill) on their 
trail.  Their goal:  locate and go public with information discrediting 
the current administration before they are eliminated.  Their trek takes 
them from the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina to Cleveland and 
Washington D.C.</P>
<P>     Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles, not that 
either is given particularly challenging material to work with.  Kramer 
is a feisty old man with a reputation as a conservative and a skinflint.  
Douglas, despite his advancing age, still lives up to his old nickname 
of the "Washington Love Machine."  At this advanced stage of his career, 
Lemmon keeps coming back to THE ODD COUPLE formula, and this is just 
another example.  What drags MY FELLOW AMERICANS down, however, isn't 
its reliance upon buddy movie conventions, but its failed attempts to 
inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into 
the story.  It's pleasant enough to watch Kramer and Douglas engage in 
verbal sparring matches (even though the dialogue isn't brilliant, the 
writers deserve credit for some good one-liners), but that enjoyment 
evaporates when we're forced to watch them jumping off of trains, 
galloping around on horseback, or reflecting on how they never made the 
difference they wanted to.  </P>
<P>     Since the film stays with Lemmon and Garner for the majority of its 
running length, no one else has much screen time.  In the case of Dan 
Aykroyd, that's probably a good thing, since his Haney isn't interesting 
or funny when he is around.  John Heard plays a bumbling Vice President 
who makes Dan Quayle look competent (listen for his pronunciation of the 
word "facade").  Sela Ward is a reporter seeking the truth behind the 
latest Washington scandal.  In full grandfather mode, Wilford Brimley 
takes on the part of the head of the Democratic National Party.  And 
Lauren Bacall has a cameo as Kramer's wife.</P>
<P>     MY FELLOW AMERICANS contains some political satire, but all of that 
material is weak and obligatory.  From an ideological point-of-view, 
both Republicans and Democrats take a beating, although neither party is 
as viciously skewered as it could (and perhaps should) have been.  MY 
FELLOW AMERICANS seems unwilling to take real chances, choosing instead 
to stick to the kind of gentle lampooning that will generate chuckles 
without risking offense.  There are times when I laughed, but, as a 
whole, this particular buddy film really isn't worth the price of 
admission.  Besides, if you want to see stupidity and silliness on a 
presidential scale, all you really have to do is turn on the news.</P>
