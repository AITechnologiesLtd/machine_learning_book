<P>     JEFFREY is a gay romantic comedy with a very impressive laugh-to-
running time ratio.  Written by ADDAMS FAMILY scribe Paul Rudnick (based on
his play of the same name), this film is about as eccentric and quirky as
they get.  Rudnick throws everything at the viewer except the kitchen sink,
and if he'd been able to find a way to get that in, he probably would have
included it.  And, despite all the mirth and mayhem, deep within JEFFREY's
core is a message everyone can relate to, regardless of their sexual
orientation.</P>
<P>     JEFFREY is politically incorrect and proud of it.  It dares to joke
about AIDS and poke fun at the closet gay tendencies of certain Catholic
priests.  It revels in stereotypes, using numerous supposedly
characteristic gay mannerisms and occupations, then turning them upside down
by revealing "real" people underneath.  In no small part due to a tremendous
performance by Patrick Stewart, one such caricature, an interior designer,
becomes someone we come to feel for.</P>
<P>     Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a sexually compulsive, young, gay man.  After
a number of bizarre in-bed experiences, he decides to give up sex cold
turkey.  It's not an easy decision to begin with, but it becomes almost
impossible when he meets Steve (Michael T. Weiss) at a gym.  Jeffrey is
immediately attracted to Steve, but his current celibate state makes a
relationship difficult.  However, Steve is patient, and it doesn't take long
before Jeffrey starts to weaken.  Then the bombshell is dropped -- Steve is
HIV+.  At first, Jeffrey says it doesn't matter, but he's lying, and the
moment he cancels a dinner date, Steve knows too.</P>
<P>     JEFFREY never attempts to simulate real life.  It's filled with asides
to the audience, strange interludes (including a faux game show and a
ghostly hospital encounter), and parodies of parodies.  One hilarious
segment has Sigourney Weaver playing "the nation's hottest post-modern
evangelist."  Another has Jeffrey talking frankly about sex to his mother
and father.  Then there's Nathan Lane as a randy priest who tries to seduce
Jeffrey before breaking into a chorus of "Everything's Coming Up Roses."  If
nothing else, Rudnick and director Christopher Ashley know how to keep the
audience off balance and in stitches.</P>
<P>     One of the real treats of JEFFREY is watching accomplished thespian
Patrick Stewart, who is in top form as Sterling, one of Jeffrey's best
friends.  Michael T. Weiss is equally strong as Steve, and Bryan Batt plays
Sterling's AIDS-infected lover, Darius, with the appropriate mix of charm
and ditziness.  Acting-wise, unfortunately, the weak link is lead Steven
Weber (from TV's WINGS), an actor with solid comic instincts, but who can't
handle drama.  This becomes a distinct liability as the film progresses,
because after the riotous first forty-five minutes, JEFFREY wanders into the
realm of the serious.  Weber's limitations become especially apparent when
he's placed in a dramatic scene opposite Stewart.</P>
<P>     You don't have to dig too deeply to find JEFFREY's simple message,
which is essentially the same as the one put forth by 1992's STRICTLY
BALLROOM: "A life lived in fear is a life half-lived."  The AIDS epidemic
has scared Jeffrey, and now he's not only hiding from his own sexuality, but
from life in general.  Darius, despite being mortally ill, describes Jeffrey
as the saddest person he's ever known and offers this advice: "Hate AIDS,
Jeffrey, not life."  Ultimately, this is the point of JEFFREY, and it's what
makes this film more than just a laugh-a-minute riot.</P>
