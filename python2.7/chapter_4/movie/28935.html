<P>If you think turning one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers into a romantic
comedy is a silly idea, just wait until you see how it shakes out on the
screen. Not only is the amateurish Head Over Heels based on a lame premise,
but its co-stars are supermodels, too. Have you ever seen a supermodel act?
There's a reason Cindy Crawford has been banned from appearing in feature
films.</P>
<P>Heels' voiceover opening introduces us to Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter,
Patch Adams), who moved from Podunk, Iowa to Manhattan, where she restores
Renaissance paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art with her lesbian
best friend (China Chow) and three elderly women who warn her of the dangers
of not having a personal life. Amanda has, like, the worst judgment in men
and stuff, catching her latest beau (Timothy Olyphant, Gone in 60 Seconds)
in bed with a lingerie model.</P>
<P>Even though she's completely written off the idea of finding the right guy,
Amanda falls for a handsome neighbor named Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.,
Boys and Girls), whose apartment is visible from her window. Amanda becomes
obsessed with Jim, trying to convince herself that he is flawed in one way
or another. When she witnesses an apparent murder in Jim's flat, nobody
believes her, and she starts her own investigation into Jim's surprising
life. Could it all be a big misunderstanding? What're you, retarded?</P>
<P>Instead of being laid up with a broken leg like Jimmy Stewart in Rear
Window, Amanda's handicap is her roommates. There are four of them, and
they're all super-tall, super-thin supermodels. In typical Hollywood
fashion, they're a predictable cross-section of what us normal folk assume
prowl the catwalk - a WASP (Shalom Harlow), an Aussie bumpkin (Sarah
O'Hare), a husky-voiced Russian (Ivana Milicevic) and an African-American
(Tomiko Fraser). They teach Amanda how to take advantage of men and give her
the obligatory makeover, even though she's better (and more healthy) looking
than any of them are.</P>
<P>Potter's Amanda is tongue-tied, clumsy and comes off as a less talented
Julia Roberts (with a bad blonde wig), or a more talented Christina
Applegate, depending on if she's whored up or not. There are worse people to
be compared to, I guess, but Potter looks so much like Roberts, it's almost
distracting. Prinze is too young and too goofy to be taking on roles like
this, but it is interesting to point out that, like Traffic's Javier
Rodriguez, his character has a hard-on for kids and baseball.  There's a
scene where Prinze punches someone in the face, but his wrist is as limp as
Ricky Martin's.</P>
<P>Most of the jokes in Heels' script (penned by a hodgepodge of four writers)
revolve around the fact that supermodels are shallow, which is hardly a
revelation. Director Mark S. Waters, who displayed a talent for successfully
handling dark comedy with The House of Yes, adds nothing to the weak script.
The Go-Go's song which shares the same name as the title seemed to be added
as an afterthought.</P>
<P>1:40 - PG-13 for sexual content, crude humor and language</P>
