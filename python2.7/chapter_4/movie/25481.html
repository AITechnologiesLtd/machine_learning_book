<P>In 1996 the world was introduced to a new version of the classic Jerry Lewis 
film "The Nutty Professor", the movie was a huge hit (almost $130m 
domestically) and continued Eddie Murphy's big hits. The movie was very good, 
very funny and quite sweet. When I first heard there was going to be a sequel 
I was a bit iffy on it, wondering how they would make a sequel to it. So we 
waited four long years to get a sequel to the beloved comedy, and it is here, 
even though it isn't as good as the original, and not many sequels are, its 
still a great way to contiune a great comedy series. </P>
<P>This time around Sherman Klump is happy, its a couple years later from the 
first film, and he has a new girlfriend, Denise Gains (played quite well by 
Janet Jackson). But the other side of Sherman, Buddy Love is bothering him, 
he keeps hearing him inside of him, he keeps saying and doing stuff Buddy 
would do, Sherman decides to get the strand of DNA that is inside of him that 
contains Buddy Love out, but with some distrous results, Buddy Love becomes 
his own seperate person, and goes off to try to make Sherman a dumb person. 
Because since Sherman put Buddy out of his blood stream, he lost an important 
part of himself, and is never going to be the same unless he has Buddy Love 
back inside of him. </P>
<P>The film has a side plot on it, but I will let you guys watch that yourself, 
so as not to spoil anything of the movie. This movie although Sherman is a 
big part of the film, this time his family is the main characters as well, 
providing alot of information about his family that in the first we really 
didn't get to know. We get to know the Klumps more than before, and know that 
they are more than just an overweight, farting family. They are sweet people 
who have troubles just like Sherman does, and at times we really feel for 
them. Eddie Murphy does a fantastic job of playing all these characters, in 
all he does six different characters and does them all justice. </P>
<P>Janet Jackson is another standout, in her second starring role on the big 
screen (her first being "Poetic Justice") she does justice to her character. 
Her and Eddie Murhpy have great chemistry on screen and make a cute, 
believable couple, they both bring their characters out to the fullest, and 
are at times very believable. Larry Miller who played the head of the college 
in the first returns, and as always gives a wonderfully comical performance 
with his character, and in one scene his character has a little run in with a 
hamster that is unbelievably funny, I almost died laughing. </P>
<P>The script was written by Steve Oderkerk, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz of the 
"American Pie" fame, and is quite cleverly witty and at times downright 
hilarious. There is a few downsides to the movie though, first of all the 
plot is a bit underdeveloped, it jumps around a lot from one plot the other 
and I said once in the movie "I'm confused", but it quickly developed a solid 
plot around 45 minutes into the movie. The movie also has alot of good points 
to it, first up is the acting which is fabulous as described above, second is 
the script which is well written, and third is the wonderul make up effects, 
which one an Oscar for the first film, they are very well made, and disguise 
Eddie Murphy in all his characters quite well. </P>
<P>Direction by Peter Segal is nice too, but his plot points are a bit jumbled, 
but besides that "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" is a film that will be 
enjoyed by fans of the original, and maybe if your not even a fan of the 
original, I think you will still like this sequel. Its a good sequel, that 
leaves the question open; "Is Nutty Professor III that far away"? </P>
