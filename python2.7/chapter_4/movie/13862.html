<P>The Chocolate War was my favourite book in high school-an expansion of
Catcher in the Rye's first chapters, or Dead Poet's Society with sharper
teeth, take your pick-so for years I feared the film version. Last week,
I hunkered down before the set to bite the bullet at last; no matter how
deviant the movie was, I could forever cling to the memory of that first
read in tenth grade. The opening moments of Gordon's movie (he played
the psycho-nerd in John Carpenter's weak Christine) put me at ease. This
1988 adaptation is not letter-faithful, but it does preserve the tone of
its source material.</P>
<P>Smith stars as Jerry Renault, the new kid at Trinity, an all-boys
Catholic school; he is fresh food for the Vigils, an underground student
organization whose sole purpose is to drive teachers and students batty
with complex practical jokes. Publicly represented by the snake-charming
Archie (Ward, née Langham, who played Phil the head writer on "The Larry
Sanders Show" and is barely recognizable here), the Vigils convince
Jerry to refuse participation in the school's annual fundraiser-a
chocolate sale-for ten days. At the end of his "mission," however, Jerry
continues to say "no," causing much consternation for terrible Brother
Leon (Glover), who reluctantly enlists the Vigils to help change Jerry's
mind. Jerry, you see, has become a rebellious symbol at the school;
overall sales have declined at a time when Trinity desperately needs the
extra funds.</P>
<P>THE CHOCOLATE WAR is extremely low budget, perhaps to Gordon's
advantage; often several chapters of the book are compressed into
spontaneous, poetic montages. At times, his camerawork and direction of
actors recalls the unpredictability of Cassavettes. Glover is pure
malevolence, and Ward is outstanding--Gordon's revision of the novel
wisely plants Archie at the forefront: Archie becomes a tragic figure
all his own, an insecure weasel as powerless as Jerry, really. Just as
we can't stop the inevitable death of our loved ones, we can't puppeteer
those around us, either. THE CHOCOLATE WAR's religious setting is
appropriate: by learning about God, perhaps the students and teachers
can learn to be God. (The boxes of the chocolates
even resemble bibles.) With this concept in mind, the movie's ending,
which is quite a departure from the book, is more dramatically
appropriate, logical, and truthful. And pitiful. Only Jerry is
problematic: his introversion on paper was somewhat painful to behold,
and his anti-conformity cathartic, but cinematically the character walks
a fine line between shy and dull.</P>
<P>With a new-wave soundtrack featuring the likes of Yaz and Peter Gabriel,
The Chocolate War is a hipper, meaner take on separate school life than
most like pictures. It's also a multi-layered film this short review
cannot do justice. I needn't have put off seeing it this long.</P>
