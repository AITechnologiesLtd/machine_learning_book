<P>Featuring, in cameos, John Travolta and George Clooney.</P>
<P>I will address the first question first.  Everyone ahs asked, how does The
Thin Red Line compare with the other epic war film of 1998, Saving  Private
Ryan.  I address it by saying this: they are not to be compared.  They are
too different to even be considered competitors.  Under my advisement, I
would recommend that you watch Saving Private Ryan and then The Thin Red
Line.  One will sack you with a visceral image of war, and the other will
give you a means to comprehend the massive onslaught of emotion the first
did without allowing you to forget.</P>
<P>The Thin Red Line follows C-for-"Charlie" company during the battle of
Guadacanal.  The reason the cast is as epic as the 6-hour-director's-cut
(the final movie is 3 hours) is that not one character is focused on much
more than any others.  All of them are given fairly equal screen time, with
a difference of perhaps ten or twenty minutes for a couple of people.</P>
<P>There are five people that are followed more than any other, and those would
be Capt. James "Bugger" Staros (Elias Koteas), First Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean
Penn), Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick Nolte), Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) and Pvt.
Witt (Jim Caviezel).  These five, consequently, are the primary narrators of
the story.  Not a single scene exists where one of them is not present.</P>
<P>To truly describe the complexity of The Thin Red Line, I would need an
academic paper.  This review, I will warn you now, will be insufficient.
The same is true of my review of Saving Private Ryan.</P>
<P>One thing to be honestly said about The Thin Red Line is that it is a film
of images.  From the horror of a dying bird shot by a stray bullet to the
beauty of a fern closing at a soldier's touch, The Thin Red Line rivals The
Sweet Hereafter in precious visual complexity.  As I called it shortly
after, The Thin Red Line is a poetry of images.</P>
<P>Another thing that you can honestly say is that The Thin Red Line is
uniquely contemplative.  In the pauses that come in the battle, both you and
the characters take time to reflect upon what you just saw.  You do not,
however, prepare yourself for what happens next.</P>
<P>The Thin Red Line may nab a couple of nominations that Saving Private Ryan
doesn't.  One is for Best Supporting Actor, which may very well go to Nick
Nolte for playing the career-motivated Lt. Col. Gordon Tall who, until he
has seen the death his armies inflict and receive firsthand, does not even
truly realize that men are dying.  Another possible nomination, although
someone with so few speaking lines will most likely not get it would be for
Best Supporting Actress, Miranda Otto.</P>
<P>Miranda Otto plays Marty Bell, the woman you see on the swing in the
commercials.  Wife of one of the two truly important characters, Private
Bell (Ben Chaplin) and Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), Miranda Otto gives a
heart-stopping performance as the wife of a soldier at war.</P>
<P>Private Bell gives a much better performance as the husband at war, down in
the grit and fighting it.  A former officer in the corps of engineers, he is
a demonstration of how the military command itself may well be the only
villain in this film.  He quit the corps of engineers to be with his wife,
only to be promised by the military that he would be drafted and he would
become an infantryman.  Lost in the dark, murders world of Guadacanal that
Terrance Malick so aptly shows, Private Bell is forced to moor himself to a
wife he cannot see in order to retain his sanity, to not cross the thin red
line.</P>
<P>The thin red line, as told according to James Jones, is the line between man
and beast.  It is the point where you cease to recognize a difference
between killing a human and killing an animal, and thus kill with the same
sociopathic lack of concern.</P>
<P>Private Bell and Private Witt are the only people that do not cross the thin
red line.  Everyone else, in the horror of battle, crosses at some time or
another.</P>
<P>The scene at which everyone but Bell and Witt cross is a perfectly filmed
attack on a Japanese hilltop encampment.  Lasting about the half the
duration as the recreation of D-Day in Saving Private Ryan, I would venture
that this scene is more effective.</P>
<P>This scene is set to music composed by Hanz Zimmer, music sure to score him
a nomination and, hopefully, the win for Best Original Score.  This music,
increasing steadily in both volume and tempo, sets the pace for both that
attack itself and the violence towards the victims.  Using that same mastery
of images that Malick displays through the entirety of the film, people are
placed as to show the sorrow of the moment much more than Saving Private
Ryan ever accomplished.</P>
<P>This scene greets you with the sight of a meditating soldier, who prays as
the world literally goes to hell around him.  It also shows a hospital's
patients being killed in mass of fury, in retaliation to the deaths during
the initial offensive.  The most striking item, however, is the image of a
private removing the teeth of dead Japanese, and contemplating removing the
teeth of a living one, for the purpose of their gold.  This, of course, was
used in Schindler's List to denote the inhuman nature of Nazis, and is
equally effective here.</P>
<P>Private Witt is the final statement in both the film and the review.  The
only person to retain all sanity through the film, Witt is a repeated AWOL
who returns to the company shortly before the battle.  A deeply religious
man, Witt is placed to counter Sean Penn, an atheist, but develops his own
character.  He has lived among the natives but, in the film's most powerful
statement, is not allowed to return when the battle is over.  He is Army.
He is American.  He is, in their eyes, death.</P>
<P>The film suffers one major pitfall that, until I wrote this review, I
thought was much more serious than it actually was.  After the hilltop is
taken there is a half-hour pause in the film.  Each line implies a fadeout,
and it is still an hour until it is given.  I realize now that this is the
point which allowed me, and should allow you, to analyze the intense two
hours you have just witnessed.</P>
<P>Oh, yes.  You haven't witnessed it yet.</P>
