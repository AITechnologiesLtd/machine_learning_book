<PRE>"Romeo Must Die"  -  Muddled Story Leaves Film
Critically Wounded
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>I want to share a strange experience with you that I
always seem to suffer whenever my friends and I visit
a Chinese restaurant for dinner.  We order four or
five different entrees.  The food is brought to our
table and placed upon a Lazy Susan (a circular
platform that revolves so that you can bring a dish
closer to you without having to reach across the
table).  I sample a portion from each of the entrees. 
Yet, no matter how much I sample, I never seem to be
able to satisfy my hunger.  Perhaps this empty feeling
arises because the dishes feature only chunks of
chicken, slivers of vegetables, and slices of beef. 
For my kind of appetite, however, I'd prefer something
meatier that I can take a knife and fork to.  </P>
<P>"Romeo Must Die" suffers in much the same way as my
Chinese dinners.  It incorporates several plots and
sub-plots that lack a noticeable meatiness.  The film
opens with the murder of a Chinese warlord's son. 
This incident starts a chain reaction of events.  His
brother, Han (Jet Li), comes to America in search of
his killer.  Meanwhile, the unsolved murder increases
tensions between the Chinese sect and the Black sect
that are in an ongoing power struggle.  As the movie
continues, there's also a component that revolves
around a shady real estate deal, a brush with the
virtues of honor and loyalty, and a desire for the
leader of the Black sect, Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo),
to make things right with his life and his two
children.</P>
<P>There is just too much going on.  The only constant is
that just about everyone carries a spare gun and seems
blinded by vengeance.  The story lines converge from
different angles and at different speeds in ways that
left a strange taste in my mouth.  Try eating Orange
Chicken and Beef in Oyster Sauce in the same bite, and
you'll know what I mean.  The result is a movie that
is sprinkled with jumbled ideas, generally flat
acting, and only slivers of a comprehensible plot.</P>
<P>Among the Asian stars that are starting to gain a
noticeable foothold with American audiences (in
addition to Jet Li, I am referring to action stars
Chow Yun-Fat of "The Replacement Killers" and Jackie
Chan of "Rumble in the Bronx"), Jet Li's persona isn't
as cool or hip as Chow's and is certainly more fierce
than that of Chan's.  Although Li has a boyish face
and a meek demeanor, when he coldly stares down an
opponent and angrily mutters "THAT was a mistake," you
can see his rage begin to swell as he tightens his lip
and tenses his muscles.  Some serious butt-kicking is
about to happen.  Jet Li performs several
well-choreographed scenes in which his gravity-defying
maneuvers (aided by special effects) are stunning.  He
pummels lesser opponents while suspended upside-down,
executes an array of acrobatic moves, and utilizes a
host of props-as-weapons such as belts, fire hoses and
even other humans.  Another interesting effect to
highlight the impact of Li's blows is that the film
cuts to an X-ray view of the human body to show the
internal damage that he inflicts.  But his subtle
style is drowned out by the seemingly endless hail of
gunfire and the bass-heavy, urban flavored soundtrack.</P>
<P>The film's one bright spot was actually one of the
second rate thugs (Maurice played by Anthony Anderson)
in the O'day camp.  He seemed like the only one who
was enjoying his role.  However, the film is just too
unfocused to offer any real value.  We can't associate
with any of the characters, we have a tough time
following the plot, and in the end, we are just hoping
that Jet Li's fighting makes up for the lulls (and it
does).  So now we've come to the end of the review,
and I open my fortune cookie.  It reads: Chunks,
slivers, and slices aren't enough to sustain "Romeo
Must Die."</P>
