<P>     How many different spins have their been on the "buddy film"?
>From THE ODD COUPLE to LETHAL WEAPON, it seems that just about
every angle on this subject has been covered.  Then along comes a movie
like GUARDING TESS that thinks it has a unique twist to this
tried-and-true theme.  However, an unusual pairing doesn't equate to a
noteworthy picture.</P>
<P>     Since the death her late husband the President, former First Lady
Tess Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine) has been living in a house in
Sommersville, Ohio, under the watchful eye of Secret Service agent Doug
Chesnick (Nicolas Cage) and his team of six men.  Just when Doug thinks
his term of duty is over, Tess requests that he return for another
three years, and what Tess wants, Tess gets.  So, against his will (his
alternative is the unemployment line), Doug remains in Sommersville,
where his already- brittle relationship with the aging widow turns into
an open contest of wills.</P>
<P>     DRIVING MISS DAISY did it much better, but there are some shared
themes between the 1989 Academy Award winning film and Hugh Wilson's
GUARDING TESS.  Both are about two mismatched people coming to know and
appreciate each other, and eventually realizing how important their
relationship is.  This, the central theme of every "buddy film," lies
at the core of GUARDING TESS.  Only the details surrounding it have
changed to fit the situation.</P>
<P>     The story is not especially original.  Mostly predictable,
GUARDING TESS is light on surprises, but that's a given for any film
that falls even loosely into a formula category.  Slow to start with,
the movie eventually slips into a flow, but the ending is burdened by a
poorly-reasoned and rather silly kidnapping subplot.  Don't think too
hard during this part, because a lot of what goes on doesn't make much
sense.</P>
<P>     The comedy is mostly low-key, and much of it works.  Coming from
writer/director Hugh Wilson, the man behind the original POLICE
ACADEMY, it's nice to find a motion picture whose laugh-to-joke ratio
is relatively high.  GUARDING TESS relies far more on verbal jousting
and body language than on slapstick and other ridiculous gags.</P>
<P>     Nicolas Cage carries the movie.  The energy and audience
involvement all come as a result of his engaging performance.  Normally
know for his manic on-screen antics, it's interesting to see Mr. Cage
play a restrained role.  The harnessed emotion is always there, just
beneath the surface, waiting to break free.</P>
<P>     Shirley MacLaine does a reasonable job as Tess, and holds her own
in scenes with her co-star, although her magnetism isn't as palpable as
his.  The rest of the cast, including such familiar names as Austin
Pendleton and James Rebhorn, provide fine supporting work.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, while GUARDING TESS is a genial comedy that provides a
reasonable ninety-five minutes' entertainment, it's sadly lacking in
originality.  There are a few good jokes, some nice chemistry between
the two leads, a little character development, and a little pathos, but
it all doesn't add up to very much.  The ingredients are there, but the
final product wasn't prepared to its best advantage.</P>
