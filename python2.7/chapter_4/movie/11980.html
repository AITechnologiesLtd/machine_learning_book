<PRE>MEN WITH GUNS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>John Sayles tackles his next subject in his new film Men With Guns.  The
trouble is, I'm not sure what his subject is...and I'm not sure he
knows, either.</P>
<P>Dr. Fuentes (Federico Luppi) is a city doctor in an unnamed Latin
American country.  His wife has recently died, and he is coping with the
issue of his legacy.  The one thing he has done which gives him the
greatest pride is a program he started to bring medicine to the Indians.
He taught several medical students and then sent them out to the Indian
villages in the mountains.  However, he hasn't heard from them, and so
he begins a quest to track them down.</P>
<P>The journey takes him into the remote regions of his country, where
people are tryannically ruled by Men With Guns:  be they soldiers,
guerrillas, or thieves. Along the way, he is joined by several fellow
travelers:  a parentless young boy (Dan Rivera Gonzalez), an outcast
soldier (Damian Delgado), a priest (Damian Alcazar), and a mute girl
(Tania Cruz).  They are all searching for something, yet none quite know
what it is.</P>
<P>With all of these characters searching for a common unnamed goal, the
film has a strong allegorical feel.  But what is the film trying to
represent?  The movie's message is clouded by its lack of specificity.
Is it yearning for simpler times?  Crying out against the use of
violence?  Deploring the conditions in Latin America?  Pointing out the
futility of altruism against chaos? All of the above?  None of the
above?  The movie is so vague and open to interpretation, the message
could be any or none of these. Somehow the message of the film seems as
pointless as the hero's quest.</P>
<P>Men With Guns is at its strongest during its flashback sequences.  The
appropriately haunting sections are more moving and tragic than the
central quest plotline.</P>
<P>Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody make a few brief, but amusing,
appearances as an American tourist couple who effortlessly bounce along
on a parallel journey to Dr. Fuentes, visiting ruins in a never-ending
search for atrocities.</P>
<P>Overall, watching the film, I get the feeling that Sayles was more
interested in creating the moods and textures involved in the film than
in telling any particular story.  The end result is detachedly
interesting, but could have been strung together to be a much more
interesting movie.</P>
