<PRE>                        THE LIMITS OF THERMAL TRAVELLING
                       A film review by Nicholas Parrott
                        Copyright 1995 Nicholas Parrott</PRE>
<P>(Mark Bender, USA 1995)
Welsh International Film Festival, Commodore Cinema Aberystwyth, 16/11/95</P>
<P>     Director Mark Bender was in town to introduce his new film, which
in his words "catalogues the weird sex lives of Americans."  Judging
from this movie it is not only their sex lives which are weird....</P>
<P>     The seriously moody Josh Mackintosh (David Jacob Ryder ) hits the
road believing he killed his wife in a domestic fight.  He ends up on
the Space Coast of Florida where he promptly meets and beds slapper
Angela Hayes.  Things turn weird when he starts receiving phone calls
from her deranged and estranged husband, Dennis (****). They then
become distinctly unpleasant when his wife, alive and kicking, and new
lover arrive in town seeking revenge.  There are twists a plenty in the
plot, not all of which can be revealed as this was a unique cut for the
festival, with the film about to be recut for general release.</P>
<P>     THE LIMITS OF THERMAL TRAVELLING is one weird movie over which the
influence of David Lynch (Director of Twin Peaks) hangs heavily.
Cleverly crafted camera work creates a mood of disorientation, and this
is set against a fast moving and sometimes difficult to follow plot.
Thankfully the film never gets as dark as much of Lynch's work and
maintains an ability both to surprise the audience and make them
laugh.  Star of the show has to be Dennis, Angela's spurned husband who
throughout the film maintains the fine balance between lucidity and
over the top craziness.</P>
