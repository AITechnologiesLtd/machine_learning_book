<PRE>                             GRUMPIER OLD MEN
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"Grumpier Old Men" is a an embarrassing effort to extend the
surprising success of the first installment. In a glaring
insensitivity to the ingredients of their own victory, the
producers have dropped the real star of their show:  the frozen
Minnesota winter. The ice and snow that controlled the residents
and propelled the jokes have been replaced by a summer landscape
that turns Minnesota into the most ordinary of suburbs.    
     In a continuing two-man war story, John (Jack Lemmon) and
Max (Walter Matthau) continue to nourish themselves on the
humiliation they inflict on each other. The first movie focused
on John's comic courtship of the merry widow Ariel (Ann-Margret);
the second opens with confirmation that all is well with their
unlikely marriage.  
     While the envious Max videotapes the scene from next door,
the adoring Ariel sculpts her naked husband as "The Thinker." 
Something has to be done about lonely Max. And so, with exactly
the same likelihood of Ann-Margret's moving to Minnesota, Sophia
Loren, as Maria Ragetti, drops into this dysfunctional town to
turn the boys' favorite bait shop into an Italian restaurant.
     A situation as silly as this must either be wrapped in charm
or buoyed by belly laughs. The first movie had a bit of both.
Although the collective talents of this cast could sustain any
major comedy, their combined efforts can't hoist this one beyond
boredom. They are stranded in a bad script.
     Unengaged, we are reduced to examining face-lifts, capped
teeth, and the general well-being of a group of aging stars. On
this level, Sophia Loren is an astonishing sight--still glorious
in every respect, trying with all her intelligence and flair to
lift her leaden lines. 
     In a charmless subplot to the war between friends, the odd
couple's son and daughter (Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak) are to
be married. Their gloomy romance, intended as a comic focus,
casts a pall for miles.  
     After some success the first time around with making Burgess
Meredith a dirty old man at 90 something, the producers inundate
him this time with flat jokes about cucumbers, salami, and a one
night stand with Sophia's mother, Francesca (Ann Guilbert.) 
Guilbert lightens things a little with her general nastiness. She
is indeed a grumpy old woman.
     Jack Lemmon can still immobilize us with the sadness in his
eyes; Matthau can still massage a line with his furrowed brow.
But they have been undermined by producers who thought they had
the golden formula and turned lazy in their success. At the very
least, they should have held onto that icebound landscape that
produced so many laughs. 
     Not one of the four principals is dotty enough to be
relegated to the silliness that Hollywood equates with old age.
It's painful to watch all this talent trying so hard to make
something of nothing. For this formula, even when it was fresh,
once was indeed enough.  </P>
