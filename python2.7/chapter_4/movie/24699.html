<PRE>Tom Greeny?
Road Trip</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Nope. Not Tom Greeny. Just greeny. Some people hate this guy, some people
love this guy. I happen to think he's pretty funny, but I don't like him.
However, none of this will effect how much you enjoy "Road Trip" because Tom
Green plays a minor role in the production.</P>
<P>And ninety percent of his role is not Tom Green material. Okay, there's the
rat in mouth trick - pretty darned funny, I laughed; and the kissing some
kid's mom on the lips part - funny, I'm not denying it. But all else is
scripted work that could have been done by any other actor - quite likely
better. Tom is best in an unscripted, unprompted environment. That doesn't
happen here, but it doesn't matter, because this film is not about Tom
Green. (Think I've made that point.)</P>
<P>It's about Josh (Breckin Meyer), he's had the same girlfriend/buddy since
first grade, but now that they've gone to separate colleges, he has reason
to believe she's cheating on him. So he does what any true friend would do,
he sleeps with a convenient babe, videos it and accidentally mails the tape
to his girl in Austin, Texas. Realizing his "I Love Lucy" blunder, he
gathers his friends and begs, burrows, steals his way to Texas to intercept
that package.</P>
<P>Okay, it's not the meatiest of plot lines - but I wasn't expecting one
anyway. I was expecting Tom Green, and/or comedy, both of which were absent,
tardy, or simply not paying attention.</P>
<P>The funniest scene finds Grampa in his pajamas with a Viagra-induced woody.
He's completely unembarrassed to greet the four college guests with his lil'
pal poppin' the tent, "What do you want me to do, cut it off?" It's very
funny actually.</P>
<P>Most of the acting is fine, but Seann William Scott's Jim-Carrey-wannabee
act is a bit grating. That and the fake bomb threat. I don't find that
humorous.</P>
<P>I've heard this film compared to "American Pie" ... sacrilege! In truth, you
could count the gut-busting scenes on one hand, and the chucklers on the
other and still have a finger or two left to do with as you please. (Don't
tell me I don't want to know).</P>
