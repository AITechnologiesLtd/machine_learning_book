<PRE>ENEMY OF THE STATE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>You're not paranoid if they're really after you.  That's the message of
Enemy of the State, the latest techno-thriller from director Tony Scott
who takes an exciting, if exaggerated, look at the lack of privacy in
our increasingly technological society.</P>
<P>Will Smith portrays Robert Clayton Dean, a DC lawyer who unexpectedly
becomes the target of intense scrutiny, when a former acquaintance
(Jason Lee) gives him possession of a tape desperately wanted by the
National Security Agency.</P>
<P>You see, the tape implicates NSA bureaucrat Reynolds (Jon Voight) in a
highly unethical and illegal activity.  So, he is bringing the full
technological power of "big brother government" to track down and
recover the tape, no matter whose civil liberties get violated.</P>
<P>So, when Robert finds himself under constant surveillance, the target of
a smear campaign in the press, in unexpected financial distress, and in
danger of losing his very life, there's only one person he can trust.
Brill (Gene Hackman) is a security expert hired, but never seen, by
Robert in the past.  But the secretive Brill may not want to get
involved.</P>
<P>Enemy of the State is stuffed to the gills with an ample supply of
technology and paranoia.  Sure, it exaggerates here and there, but it
shrewdly grounds all of its hyperbole in technological fact and jargon.
We're introduced to a hidden world...a surveillance state which exists
around us even now, but the average citizen is oblivious to the
countless electronic eyes upon him.</P>
<P>The bad guys in the film aren't completely evil (well...okay, Jon Voight
is evil...but the rest are simple bureaucrats and technogeeks just doing
their job).  In fact, some of the most sympathetic characters in the
film are a few of those technogeeks.  However, the message of the film
is that the sum of all these earnest governmental workers "just doing
their job" add up to a powerful weapon in the hands of an ambitious
bureaucrat (like Voight).</P>
<P>Will Smith once again proves an amiable lead.  Taken by itself, the role
of Robert Clayton Dean is a little bland.  But Smith's charisma shines
through, and makes Dean a character worth rooting for.</P>
<P>Gene Hackman is, as usual, a welcome presence.  The surveillance
atmosphere of Enemy of the State favorably compares to The Conversation
(also featuring Hackman), though the latter is easily a better film.
Hackman's shrewd paranoia enlivens the film just when it begins to drag
in its second half.  So what if his character makes a few
out-of-character mistakes...it's a pleasure just to watch Hackman chew
on this meaty role.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is, unfortunately, coincidence-driven.  If a
certain sequence of events didn't happen in just the right order and
just the right time, there'd be no movie.  Luckily the action sequences
have enough energy that you can ignore the manufactured plot and still
have a good time.  But a truly sharp thriller should be able to combine
both plot and action.</P>
<P>Enemy of the State is a fun film to watch, even though it doesn't have
as much substance as it initially seems.  Still, you might think twice
the next time you spy a surveillance camera glaring your way.</P>
