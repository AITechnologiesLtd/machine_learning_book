<PRE>                                KAMA SUTRA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Let's be honest.  There are some movies that don't need to be
made.  With movies able to show almost any sexual behavior known, is
there any longer any reason for one of those pseudo-instructional films
on sex?  In the 1960s that was a popular way to get sex and nudity past
the censors, but today our movies are quite explicit, too explicit some
will undoubtedly argue.</P>
<P>     Respected director Mira Nair (SALAAM BOMBAY! and MISSISSIPPI
MASALA) takes us back to sixteenth century India for a fictionalized
tale using the "Kama Sutra of Vatsayana" as the guidebook.  In one of
the most pedantic shows in some time, characters read from the
instructions on sex and love with complete seriousness and devotion,
but it is dry as reading the phone book.  Okay, maybe as lively as the
dictionary.</P>
<P>     Looking something like an aerobics class, the teachers in KAMA
SUTRA read to groups of women students the precise way to caress the
toes.  (There is precious little actual sex or nudity in the movie
although there is some.  Just like in the old risque pictures, more is
promised than delivered.  The script titillates while insulting the
audience's intelligence.)</P>
<P>     Because the last Indian film I saw, JAYA GANGA, was such an
unexpected delight, I naively went to KAMA SUTRA with positive
expectations.  Within 15 minutes of arrival, however, I was already
checking my watch.</P>
<P>     KAMA SUTRA's rich sets by Mark Friedberg, gorgeous cinematography
by Declan Quinn, and elegant red and gold costumes by Eduardo Castro
are the only reasons to see the picture.  But, as people rarely buy
Playboy to read the articles, the only possible reason people would
stay to see all of KAMA SUTRA is to wait for another brief glimpse of
flesh.  (Well, there are those of us who are critics who feel compelled
to stay, but the temptation to leave is almost irresistible with this
class, I mean picture.)</P>
<P>     To the extent that this pointless story has a plot it can be
summarized thus.  The King (Naveen Andrews) marries a woman named Tara
(Sarita Choudhury).  Having a wandering eye, he first has an affair
with Maya (Indira Varma), who is in Tara's entourage.  Maya, in turn,
falls for the stone mason Jai (Ramon Tikaram).  You can guess whom Jai
will end up sculpting and what trouble this will cause.</P>
<P>     The actresses are all lovely lasses who look like their last job
was a photo shoot for Vogue.  The men are hunks who look like they have
been posing for the covers of those romance novels known as
bodice-rippers.  No genuine acting is in evidence.</P>
<P>     The dialog by Helena Kriel and Mira Nair sounds as if it could
have been written on a lark by a bunch of freshmen taking their first
college English class.  ("One day you are your father's property," says
the king to his new queen.  "One day you are your husband's property.
It must be difficult.")</P>
<P>     As I sat trying to endure the film, I tried to pass the time by
figuring out which film KAMA SUTRA most reminded me of.  The first that
came to mind was I AM CURIOUS (YELLOW) from 1967.  Finally, I decided
KAMA SUTRA was closest to EVITA.  Both KAMA SUTRA and EVITA are lovely
for the eyes to behold but have few other redeeming qualities.</P>
<P>     If you want an erotic film, KAMA SUTRA isn't it.  If you are
searching for a meaningful experience at the cinema, KAMA SUTRA will
not supply it.  If you want a movie with depth, this isn't it.  If you
want romance, try THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The only possible motivation
for paying your hard earned cash to see this picture is if you like
being teased and hearing someone reading passages from obscure and
didactic manuals on sexuality.</P>
<P>     "Some things don't make sense immediately," cautions the Kama
Sutra teacher in the film to her eager female pupils.  And then some
movies never do.  Whatever your reason for going to this film, I
suspect you will leave disappointed and perhaps angry that this
filmmaker has wasted your time with such drivel.</P>
<P>     KAMA SUTRA runs an incredibly long 2:00.  It is in English.  It
is rated R for full frontal nudity, sex, drug usage, and gratuitous
violence.  I see no reason for your teenagers to see this movie, but
if they do, they should be mature.  I recommend you avoid this
meaningless film.  I give it a single * only for the technical aspects
of the production.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
