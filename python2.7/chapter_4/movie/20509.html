<P>Susan Granger's review of "FOR LOVE OF THE GAME" (Universal Pictures)</P>
<P>It's Kevin Costner's third time at bat with a baseball movie
("Bull Durham," "Field of Dreams") and, once again, he's got a real
winner in this romantic sports drama. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a
aging Detroit Tigers pitching ace who's caught in a personal and
professional dilemma as he pitches what may be his finest - and last -
game at New York's Yankee Stadium. He's 40 years old, arm-weary and
aching, and he's just discovered that the Tigers have been sold and
the new owners plan to trade him. Plus, his long-time girl-friend,
Kelly Preston, is about to leave him, reasoning: "You don't need
me. You and the ball and the diamond - you're perfect together." As
his buddy/catcher (John C. Reilly) says, "Billy, this ain't your day."
During the game, as he pitches to different hitters, Billy replays -
in flashback - the vignettes that led up to this pivotal moment in his
19-year career. Based on Michael Shaara's novel from which the
contrived, predictable plot was lifted, Dana Stevens has written a
character-driven, well-crafted, if overly serious, screenplay, and
director Sam Raimi ("A Simple Plan") smoothly blends nostalgia with
suspenseful action. His intricate meshing of crisp sound and intense
silence is superb. Kevin Costner is heart-wrenching, imbuing Chapel
with texture and intensity, giving one of the best performances of his
career.  Unfortunately, his pairing with Preston totally lacks
chemistry - and Preston's character is frustratingly underwritten and
indecisive - but young Jena Malone, as her funky daughter, is vibrant
and impressive. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "For Love of
the Game" is a relentlessly entertaining, All-American 8. On a
personal note, I'm not a baseball fan - but I was on the edge of my
seat, ready to cheer out loud during the final inning.</P>
