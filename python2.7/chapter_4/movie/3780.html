                       A film review by James Meek

<P>     PARTY GIRL is the kind of movie that brings out the kitschy
adjective thesaurus in me:  It's a swanky flourish of a movie that
grooves its way into your heart.</P>
<P>     Parker Posey, as Mary, is the driving force behind the movie.
Without her, the film would be a fairly run-of-the-mill Happening Scene
movie about glammy people in New York.  Without Posey, in fact, the
movie would be downright dull.  Posey, however, incarnates a wonderful
screen charisma.  Not only does she have great gams, slightly pouty
lips, and a killer jawline (reminiscent of Ione Skye), but she's got
capital-P Pizzazz!  She's the life of the party, the belle of the ball,
the hostess with the mostest.</P>
<P>     You might remember Posey from DAZED AND CONFUSED, the film from a
couple of summers ago about high school in the '70's.  That film
featured a large, diverse cast, but Posey still stood out (more so than
Milla Jovovich, who had a larger but less inhabited part) as a sadistic
senior princess putting freshwomen through their paces.  PARTY GIRL
puts Posey front and center, and she runs away with the movie.</P>
<P>     Part of Posey's charm is her complete ease in being the center of
attention, even when she's the only person in the room.  It's easy to
look like a sophisticated party queen, but Posey manages not to look as
foolish as mere mortals would while dancing in her kitchen, humming
Middle Eastern melodies while faux belly-dancing with a dishtowel.
It's quite a feat.  If PARTY GIRL does at all well, Posey should (she
deserves to) move into the on deck circle of Hollywood stardom.  Now
that Sandra Bullock's all but clinched the dream-girl-next-door
starring role position in Hollywood, Posey's poised to take Sandy's
empty slot in the lineup.</P>
<P>     Oh, yeah--the plot (such as it is).  Posey is Mary, a party girl
(hence the title) in New York who lives in a low-rent apartment but
wears a high-class wardrobe.  At the beginning of the film, Mary is
arrested for throwing an illegal party, and calls her godmother, Mrs.
Lindendorf (Sasha Von Scherler), her "only family," for bail and a
loan.  Her godmother is not pleased, of course, and to repay the loan
Mary takes a job under her godmother at the public library as a clerk
(Mrs. Lindendorf is a full-fledged librarian).  At first she breezes
through the position, not much caring, but when challenged decides to
master the Dewey Decimal System and become the best damn clerk she
can.</P>
<P>     There's also a love story between Mary and Omar, a falafel vendor
from Lebanon, and Mary's roommate's efforts to get hired as a DJ in a
really trendy club.  PARTY GIRL is only loosely about its plot,
however.  It doesn't even have nearly as much partying as you might
expect.  The film rises and sets with Posey's performance, so the
filmmakers are lucky (or were perceptive enough to see) that Posey's up
to the challenge.</P>
<P>     What sets Posey apart from just any actress in the role is her
ability to play a character most people (including herself) believe is
a low-density flibbertigibbet, while letting the audience see, in the
tilt of her head and the low-key intensity of her voice, that Mary's
not as dumb as she likes to project.  She manages to surprise herself
with her library talents, but not us.  We knew she had it in her,
because Posey let us see it all along.</P>
<P>Grade for the course: B (I'm changing to the ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY 
report-card summary method--it's much more satisfying)</P>
