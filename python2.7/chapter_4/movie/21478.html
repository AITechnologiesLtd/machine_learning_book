<P>Breakfast of Champions
Directed by:  Alan Rudolph
Starring: Bruce Willis, Albert Finney, Nick Nolte, Vicki Lewis,
Barbara Hershey, Glenne Headly, Lukas Haas, Omar Epps, Buck Henry,
Ken Campbell, Jake Johannsen
Running time:  110 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****</P>
<P>This film is based on the novel by Kurt Vonnegut.  Since Vonnegut's
novels don't have straightforward plots or easy to understand
characters, the movies made from them are complicated and not
exactly mainstream.  Which makes the appearance of so many big stars
in this film very surprising.</P>
<P>Fresh from his success in The Sixth Sense, a film in which
he rarely spoke above a whisper and had no action scenes, Willis comes
to a film where he is often shouting and engages in a lot of action.
But it still isn't a typical Willis movie.  There are no terrorists,
no bombs, no bad guys.  Instead, we have a town full of people who
are going mad.  Some have already gone there.  Dwayne Hoover (Willis)
is a successful car dealer whose family life is a shambles. His wife 
is clearly ill and popping pills. His son goes by the name of Bunny
and was a big disappointment at military school.  His mistress is
more interested in getting a chicken franchise than having sex.  His
sales manager (Nolte) is a secret cross dresser.  And coming to see 
them is Kilgore Trout, hack writer deemed genius by Elliot Rosewater.</P>
<P>The movie follows Hoover's search for the meaning life. A question
he hopes Trout can answer.  It does a good job of emulating the 
inchoate style of Vonnegut's books.  Willis and Nolte do a great 
job of portraying their psychologically damaged characters.  And
Albert Finney is exactly what I imagined Kilgore Trout to be.</P>
<P>I've seen some negative reviews of this movie and I think it is one
you will either love or hate.  I've also seen some people claim it 
is a ripoff of Brazil.  You can only reach that conclusion if you 
have never seen a movie other than Brazil.</P>
