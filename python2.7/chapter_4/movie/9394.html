<P>Playing God (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Buena Vista's press synopsis for Playing God labels the film "an intense
thriller," and never have publicity notes been more helpful: after watching
this aimless oddity, I could not get a handle what exactly the film is,
and, based on the mess onscreen, the filmmakers themselves did not seem to
have a clue, either.
        Playing God starts out like a thriller, with our hero, aimless junkie
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), performing some nifty impromptu surgery on a
shooting victim in a seedy L.A. nightclub.  That grisly scene is followed
by a more straight dramatic one, when we are offered a glimpse into
Eugene's troubled past: he was once a surgeon, but he was stripped of his
medical license after doing some fatal work on a patient while under the
influence of amphetamines.  Things then shift into a more comedic gear with
the entrance of counterfeiter Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who,
impressed with Eugene's spontaneous and skillful show of surgical savvy,
takes a reluctant Eugene under his wing as a highly-paid on-call doctor who
illegally "fixes" his criminal associates after they get themselves into
bloody mishaps.  And whenever Eugene's surgical gigs take center stage, the
film takes a more blackly comic route.
        When thriller-like double-crosses by Eugene, Raymond's girlfriend Claire
(Angelina Jolie), and an FBI agent (Michael Massee) come into the picture,
it becomes quite clear that no one involved in Playing God, much less
director Andy Wilson or writer Mark Haskell Smith, has a real grasp on what
exactly the film is all about.  Not only is the film's mood and flow of
events all over the map, but without any focused direction, all of the
players attack the material from wildly different angles.  Duchovny
maintains a Fox Mulder-type balance of deadpan sarcasm and seriousness
throughout; the pouty Jolie is stiffly earnest; and Massee and especially
Hutton seemed to have wandered in from the broad comedy next door.  I
suppose the original intent of Playing God was to be a neo-noir with a
gloss of postmodern hipness, something hinted at by Eugene's coolly
detached and "ironic," if pointless, voiceover narration.  But any
discernable intentions are lost in the swirl of clashing ideas and
sensibilities.
        "A game with no rules" reads the tagline for Playing God, which can best
be described as "a film with no rules": a peculiar star vehicle for X-Files
sensation Duchovny that meanders within the territory of comedy, drama,
thriller, and just about anything under the cinematic sun with very little
rhyme and no apparent reason at all.</P>
