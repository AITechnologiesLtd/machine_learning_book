<P> Election (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Matthew
Broderick, Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell.</P>
<P> One of the pleasures of movie reviewing is watching a film that arrives
unannounced and charms you with its humor and originality.</P>
<P> Such "sleepers" as "Fargo" and "The Full Monty" fit snugly into this
category. And now you can add "Election," an askewed look at the polemics
of high school politics.</P>
<P> Everyone of us knows a Tracy Flick. That's the student who always raises
his or her hand first, always knowing right answer; the one who cheerfully
organizes the car wash to raise the money to fund the prom, the one who is
destined to be student body president and lead the school to glory.</P>
<P> We all know a Tracy Flick - and most of us hated her - or him. OK, maybe
hate is too strong. Jealous, envious. We admired that student's ease and
self-confidence around others while cursing our own tongue-tied
inadequacies.</P>
<PRE> You know who you, er, we, are.</PRE>
<P> At George Washington Carver High School, Tracy Flick is the classic
overachiever, a bright, perky go-getter whose ambition is to be student
government president. And it looks like she will succeed, since she is
running unopposed.</P>
<P> Jim McAllister is a much beloved, veteran civics teacher at Carver. He has
been on the faculty for 12 years and has been recognized three times as
"Teacher of the Year."</P>
<P> And he decides that Tracy must be stopped. He sees her treating high
school as the first step in a lifelong career strategy that could take her
to unimaginable heights.</P>
<P>He also knows Tracy's dark secret. She had an affair with his best friend,
a teacher who lost his job after their romance became public.</P>
<P> So McAllister recruits Paul Metzger, a dim-witted, but nice, popular
football hero sidelined by an injury to run against her.</P>
<P> Paul is totally unfit for the job, completely in the dark about student
government, but McAllister convinces him that it's his civic duty to run.</P>
<P> The situation gets even wilder when Paul's younger sister, Tammy - seeking
revenge on the girlfriend who dumped her and began dating her brother -
enters the race on a platform of abolishing student government.</P>
<P> Soon life in and out of school begin spinning out of control for
McAllister as his plans go awry.</P>
<P> "Election" is a satirical joy, due mainly to the performances of Reese
Witherspoon as Tracy, Matthew Broderick as McAllister, Chris Klein as Paul
and, especially, Jessica Campbell as Tammy.</P>
<P> Witherspoon's Tracy is bubbly and gushing to the point of nausea. Her
Tracy is one of those students who treats others as if they were her serfs.
She may be all smiles and dimples on the outside, but underneath she rages
and burns with ambition and intolerance for those who do not live up to her
standards.</P>
<P> Broderick's deadpan performance is one of low-key desperation, as his
various plots to thwart Tracy continue to be upended.</P>
<P> Klein is sincere as the friendly doofus who, unlike Tracy, does not see
the election as a life-and-death struggle.</P>
<P> Campbell's Tammy is sarcastic and brutally honest. Her best moment comes
during the assembly where the candidates give their campaign speeches. She
rallies the students by pointing out the hyprocisy of the system and the
ineffectual role of student government, calling for its abolition.</P>
<P> What really sets "Election" apart is the voice-over narrations by the
various principals, especially when - at times - what they are saying is in
counterpoint to the action on the screen.</P>
<P> The script by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, based on a novel by Tom
Perrotta, could be seen as an allegory of our democratic process, but I'd
rather not be that pretentious.</P>
<P> I look at "Election" like that blind date that turned out to be the most
fabulous night of your life. It's a sharp, funny and entertaining movie
that will keep you laughing from the opening reel to the closing credits.</P>
