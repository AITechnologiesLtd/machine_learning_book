<P>Shanghai Noon is a paint by numbers picture done with finger-paints. There 
are no surprises as to where the paint is going and despite the pretty 
colors, it's far too messy to be considered good. In an attempt to replicate 
the previous success of Rush Hour, the writers have taken the "hero must 
travel to a strange land to save a kidnapped female" premise from the 
previous film and tried to shoehorn it into an Old West setting. In a sloppy 
attempt to disguise rehashed goods, an unsuccessful lampoon is made of 
Westerns. There are some amusing moments created through the sheer charisma 
of Jackie Chan, but overall, it's a feeble effort at displaying the skills 
of one of the premiere physical comedians in world cinema. The audience and 
Chan both deserve far better.</P>
<P>Like Rush Hour, Chan plays a hero who must rescue a kidnapped damsel in 
distress. In this case, he's a member of the Imperial Guard named Chon Wang 
sent to the Western territories of America, circa the late 1800s, to help 
deliver a ransom of 100,000 pieces of gold to a mission in Carson City, 
Nevada, and safely return Princess Pei Pei (Liu) to their homeland following 
her abduction by the traitorous Lo Fong. Following the cinematic tradition 
of buddy pictures, he meets up with Roy (Wilson), a bandit whom he first 
hates, then grudgingly befriends. The thin as onionskin premise just begs to 
be peppered with reams of whimsically staged displays of Chan's ballet-like 
fight scenes. It's a good fifteen minutes before Chan even remotely attempts 
a stunt. And when he does, it singularly unremarkable, involving a 
confrontation with some train-robbing bandits led by Roy. There is a bar 
fight midway through the film where Chan squirts from foe to foe, slippery 
as wet ice and a unique standoff between Chan wielding a horseshoe tied to a 
rope against armed combatants, but other than that, I'm hard pressed to view 
any of the other fights as especially unique to Chan. Anyone who's never 
seen martial arts films might be impressed, but I found myself greatly under 
whelmed.</P>
<P>Wang's partner Roy lends the movie an off-kilter skew with his surfer dude 
via the Old West mentality. Roy is an amiable bandit who is quixotically 
quirky in his approach to life. Although an acquired taste, is soft-spoken 
sarcasm and basic insecurity lends an interesting counterbalance to Wang's 
befuddled chivalry.</P>
<P>A cardboard cutout could have played the princess. As it stands, the fiery, 
charismatic Lucy Lui is criminally underused. How can we care about her fate 
when she is so severely underdeveloped a character? At least she fares 
better than Wang's American Indian bride (Brandon Merrill), who spends the 
entirely of the movie as a silent plot device, speaking only to deliver a 
trite, groan inducing punch-line at the end. Women tend to get short shrift 
in buddy films as window dressing, but these two aren't even given that 
common courtesy. It's a wonder women can even enjoy films of this type with 
their underlying misogynistic tone.</P>
<P>Amid the uninspired scenes are a few amusing nods to the classic western. At 
one point the men are hunted by Marshall Van Cleef (Berkeley), who looks 
more than passingly like Lee Van Cleef in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 
Roy has a Sundance Kid look about him that is played upon in a scene where 
the pair plans to bust through a wooden door, guns blazing, as in Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. A weaponless Wang fighting tomahawk wielding 
Indians puts an welcome, odd spin on the cowboys vs. Indians theme as the 
fight goes down with nary a six-shooter in sight, using foliage as weapons.</P>
<P>It's obvious this film exist as feel-good, striving merely to entertain, not 
educate or examinate, but that doesn't excuse some of the distracting 
cliches and plot holes. Midway throught the film, Wang is unknowingly 
married to an American Indian woman, who risks her life time and agains to 
save him, yet by film's end, she inexplicable swtiches allegiances, ignoring 
her wedding vows for another man. Wang, a man ruled by tradition, honor and 
principles, does the same. At one point Roy is left for dead, buried up to 
his neck in dirt, a vulture picking at his head. Next scene he's playing 
cards in a casino, no worse the wear. It's a Houdini escape that begs 
explaination. Why do Lo Fong and Van Cleef both think Roy and Wang have the 
gold? Was there a crucial scene cut explaining their fallacious thinking, 
seeing as how the gold never left the custody of the three other imperial 
guardsmen who were transporting the gold with Wang?</P>
<P>Buddy films rely on charisma to carry them through typically threadbare 
plotting. Wilson and Chan display an unusual, yet warm chemistry, but it 
simply isn't enough. They have fun with what they're given, but it's obvious 
both of their considerable talents are suffocated by Filmmaking for the 
Masses 101. It would have been nice to see both men's talent breath under 
more clever, knowing filmmaking.</P>
