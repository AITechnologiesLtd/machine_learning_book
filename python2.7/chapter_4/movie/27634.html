<P>PLOT:
A young lad who used to get crapped on by the girls in his junior high
class, is now older and stronger and apparently out to whack each and every
one of them heartbreakers. Or is it someone else just pretending to be the
nerdy ol' kid and slicing and dicing said victims up? Pretty cool premise,
huh? Read on.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Can a movie that starts off with a big-breasted girl in a tight tanktop
performing an autopsy be all that bad? Sadly...yes! And I generally love
watching these kinds of movies, you know, frivolous flicks with cheap
thrills and girls with big cans...but this movie just plain sucks. It's got
zero rhythm, almost no energy, no chemistry between anyone in the cast (were
they all there for the paycheck or what?), no scares (other than your
garden-variety "boo!" stuff), stale dialogue, unoriginal killings and worst
of all...and this hurts the most, boys and girls...no T&A! At least give us
a little T&A, man! Or at least some T!! (and I don't mean Tease, which is
one of the few things that this film does deliver well) Anyway, what else
can I tell you here? Oh yeah, the premise is good, I mean, I think we've all
thought of doing this at one point or another in our lifetimes, but the
execution, aaaaaah, the execution...just awful. Where is the suspense? Where
is the caring for any of the characters? (all of whom chime in on one
dimension) Where is the goddamn intelligence, people?! I mean, I know that
this is a slasher movie and you're supposed to suspend disbelief to a
certain extent, but man-o-man, allow me to share this one scene with you
all. There is a murderer on the loose, right? Everyone is scared witless,
right? Nobody knows who it is or where they'll strike next, right? So what's
the first thing that you would do during a party packed with a bunch of
people? Hmmmmm...now think hard...really? Would you, A) Stay close to others
B) Dance the night away...with others C) Go off to a dark room by yourself
and hang out in a hot tub? Hehehehe. Tough one, eh?</P>
<P>But there were many other problems with this movie as well. The "first
scene" kill, which has now become a custom in all teen slashers, sucked the
big one, and didn't offer anything original. The ending of the movie, which
I won't spoil here, was a little bit of a surprise, but left a million
questions unanswered. That Dorothy girl (Jessica Capshaw) only seemed to act
with her lips and teeth (does that count?), and that bothered me. Actually,
quite a few things bothered me, and when I end up noticing little things
like that in a movie, it can generally only mean one thing. Yeah, who woulda
figured that this movie would be, and I hate to say it... ...boring! It just
lacked. Lacked...lacked...lacked a lot! Sure, we get Denise Richards in a
bathing suit, acting like the ultra-queen-bitch like only she can do, but is
that enough for you to fork over your hard earned buckeroonies? Well, to
some, it might be, but even if you toss in the Katherine Heigl major
cleavage factor, the super "hotties" for the ladies and the ever-perky
Heather Graham look-a-like, the whole thing just doesn't add up to much.
Another wasted opportunity. The film had the potential to become something
interesting but somewhere along the line, it was crapped away entirely.
Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz were good, but they both seemed to belong
in another movie altogether. But are there still some really, really cheap
thrills to be had? Yeah, I guess...but nothing to write to mother about.</P>
<P>I only wish that the fervent intensity that went into successfully marketing
this film on the Internet had been shared with the actual making of the
movie. It might've turned into an entertaining, smart and original thriller,
but all that we're left with now, are pieces of a film that might've been...
Keep it moving, folks...nothing to see here. Oh yeah, and the soundtrack
also sucked!</P>
