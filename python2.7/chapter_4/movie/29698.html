<PRE>VA SAVOIR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Jacques Rivette's VA SAVOIR, which translates to WHO KNOWS?, would more aptly be
titled WHO CARES?  The minimal story concerns three couples who are barely in
love and who are mildly interested in others.  None of the characters are the
least bit compelling.  </P>
<P>All of the actors (Jeanne Balibar, Sergio Castellitto, Marianne Basler, Jacques
Bonnaffé, Hélène de Fougerolles and Bruno Todeschini) sleepwalk through their
parts, and the director takes forever -- over two and one half hours -- to say
almost nothing.  Besides the flimsy romantic angle, the story also concerns the
search for an unpublished eighteenth century play.  Finally, there is a play
within the movie that is -- one assumes -- supposed to be almost laughably bad. 
The irony is that the movie itself isn't much better.</P>
<P>"It can't go on like this," Camille (Jeanne Balibar) remarks about a half hour
into the movie.  Sadly, it does.  This much can be said in the movie's defense. 
At least its extremely bland trailer accurately represents the movie itself. 
You can't say that about many films.</P>
<P>VA SAVOIR runs 2:34.  The film is in French and Italian with English subtitles. 
It is rated PG-13 for "brief nudity" and would be acceptable for kids around 11
and up.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, October 12, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
