<P>REVIEW:  Great Expectations
by Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>If you're after a comparison between the classic Charles Dickens novel
Great Expectations and the new, modern day film version of the same
name then I'm afraid I can't give you one (simply because I haven't
read the book).  But I suspect that many of today's teenagers, who the
film is primarily targeted for, are in the same position as I was - no
great expectations, no novel to set the standards.</P>
<P>Generation X actors Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow have gelled
together on screen for a simple task: look hunky dory, sound like
bimbo's with intelligence.  They have succeeded very well on both
tasks.</P>
<P>Living in the small town of Florida, young lad Finn Bell (Ethan Hawke)
is asked to accompany the incredibly wealthy Ms. Nora Dinsmoor (Ann
Bancroft), a long time resident who lost her mind after a man left her
standing at the altar thirty years before.  Aged 8, Finn is
immediately attracted to Dinsmoor's 11 year old (and already stunning)
daughter Estella (Raquel Beaudene). Seizing the opportunity to share
some of her troubled wisdom, Dinsmoor warns: "She'll only break your
heart; it's a fact.  And even though I warn you, even though I
guarantee you that the girl will only hurt you terribly, you'll still
pursue her. Ain't love grand?"</P>
<P>Through emotional and sexual seduction, Estella's power over Finn
grows until their off and on relationship hits the boundaries of time
and location.  Now into adult hood, Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) moves to
New York after a rousing night with Finn (Ethan Hawke).  Years later,
a mystery benefactor suddenly requests Finn to showcase his talent for
drawing (of which was nothing more than a hobby) and make himself
known in the art world.  Off he goes to New York, and can you guess
who he bumps into?</P>
<P>The reunion of these two characters brings forth some rather
surprising results, and as the film begins to wrap up we are able to
appreciate the love story that has kept us interested all this time.</P>
<P>With a surprisingly dramatic climax, Great Expectations decides to
change its path of romance and love to a much more engaging finish
(even though this is only for a short time).  Sure - it's far from
perfect, but perfection isn't the name of the game - the film has a
sugary sweetness buried deep inside, which is eventually discovered
and appreciated.</P>
<P>The icy cold performance by Gwyneth Paltrow, and the puppy love role
that Ethan Hawke plays are quite obviously nothing special, but they
both look great together as a modern couple with a passion for
seduction.</P>
<P>Although Great Expectations may not be the most satisfying cinema
experience, it has more than enough bones in it's body to make it an
enjoyable feast of Generation X gibberish.</P>
<PRE>3 and a half stars out of 5
Good expectations are more than matched</PRE>
