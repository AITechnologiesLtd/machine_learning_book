BOUNCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In the romantic comedy and tragedy BOUNCE, Ben Affleck and Gwyneth 
Paltrow play Buddy and Abby, two lovers who are living mutual lies.  
Abby is a widow who hides behind claims to be a divorcee, and Buddy is a 
man with strong but secret bonds to Abby.  He "accidentally" meets her 
while trying to buy commercial real estate.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Don Roos, BOUNCE has none of the sharply written 
edginess of his last film, THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.  With a plot and tone 
vaguely reminiscent of RANDOM HEARTS, starring Harrison Ford and Kristin 
Scott Thomas, BOUNCE concerns two people affected by the aftermath of an 
airline disaster.</P>
<P>At a Chicago airport bar on a snowy night, Buddy meets Abby's husband, 
Greg (Tony Goldwyn).  Buddy generously gives Greg his Infinity Airlines 
ticket so that Greg can make it home to be with his son.  This last 
flight out that night ends in a cataclysmic fireball that kills everyone 
onboard.  An unrecognizable Jennifer Grey (DIRTY DANCING) plays the 
airline clerk who lets Greg on with Buddy's ticket.</P>
<P>Ironically, Buddy is an ad executive working on the Infinity Airlines 
account.  Full of guilt for not dying, he resents the airline's 
schmaltzy ad series, "We Remember," that memorializes the victims and 
honors their families.  Turning to booze to drown his sorrows, he hits 
bottom in a drunken stupor when he accepts an advertising award for the 
ad series.  "We crashed; we're humble; and we're ready to sell some 
tickets," he tells the stunned crowd in his acceptance speech before 
passing out on stage.</P>
<P>After some time in a rehab clinic, he looks up Abby, hoping to do 
something nice for her financially in order to atone for his perceived 
sins.  She turns out to be a nervous and ditzy real estate agent.  
Smoking badly, she explains that she is only doing it to cure her 
addiction to the anti-smoking gum that she got hooked on while trying to 
support a friend.  An unhappy type, Abby says things like, "if you grade 
on a curve, I'm happy," talking as much to herself as to others.</P>
<P>Buddy and Abby's awkward friendship and eventual love affair are 
pleasant enough but never particularly engaging.  Their first date is to 
a baseball game in which the large scoreboard displays the slogan, "Make 
some noise."  The actors would have served the audience better if they 
had heeded that advice.</P>
<P>Even if it isn't quite worth recommending, the film does have its 
moments, especially its funnier ones.  "Guys screw up," Abby's friend 
explains to her when she is about to give up on Buddy after learning his 
secret.  "It's in his manual, right after love your grill and leave sox 
on the floor."  But, when the movie tries to be a tear-jerker, it leaves 
you dry-eyed and feeling manipulated.</P>
<P>BOUNCE runs 1:46.  It is rated PG-13 for some language and sensuality 
and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
