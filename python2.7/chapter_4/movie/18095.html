<PRE>OPEN YOUR EYES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>The rich and incredibly handsome playboy César (Eduardo Noriega) has
been horribly disfigured in a car accident.</P>
<PRE>Or has he?</PRE>
<P>To make his nightmare worse, he's been accused of murdering his
ex-girlfriend, Nuria (Najwa Nimri), a sexual predator straight out of
FATAL ATTRACTION.  Not only does he believe that he didn't murder her,
he has recently been confused by her claims that she is really his new
girlfriend, Sofía.  He knows and loves Sofía (Penélope Cruz), and she
doesn't look anything like Nuria.  Even his best friend, Pelayo (Fele
Martínez from THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE), doesn't believe him.</P>
<P>It is even suggested that César isn't disfigured at all.  Perhaps, he's
told, he's like those anorexic teenage girls who just think they're fat.</P>
<P>Welcome to the Escher world of writer and director Alejandro Amenábar's
OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS), a movie that delights in playing tricks
with our minds.  Dreams within dreams within dreams are some of its more
straightforward stratagems.  More baroque is the layering of cryogenics
onto virtual reality in this MASK meets THE TRUMAN SHOW meets EXISTENZ.</P>
<P>As a purposely-confusing mind game of what's real and what's a mirage,
the story has an undeniable attraction.  Like trying to finish the
Sunday crossword puzzle before your spouse, you're likely to stay glued
to the screen.  But when it's over, you won't have much more to take
away than the puzzle's solution.  The characters act like disconnected
figures in a video game.  They run through their lines as fast as they
can but never connect with each other.</P>
<P>The screenplay uses sexually charged settings to establish the story and
then lets it get bogged down with long discussions between César and his
prison psychiatrist, Antonio (Chete Lera).  The latter character should
have been eliminated entirely.</P>
<P>With its richly textured music and its striking cinematography, the
movie is a feast for the ears and eyes.  As the story drags and turns
increasingly bizarre, its handsome production makes up for many of its
shortfalls.  Never a bad movie, it's more of a near miss, unlike the
other recent Spanish film, THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, which is
nearly perfect.  Both films play games with reality and time sequences.</P>
<P>César's experiences are just "one of those Candid Camera jokes,"
Antonio suggests.  Perhaps.</P>
<P>When they finally reveal the Big Secret in the end, you're liable to
just shake your head -- both because it's so ludicrous and because you
can easily and correctly write the epilogue.  The latter is so obvious
as to be trite.</P>
<P>OPEN YOUR EYES runs too long at 1:50.  The film is in rapid fire Spanish
with English subtitles.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, profanity and
violence and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
