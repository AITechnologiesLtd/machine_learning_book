<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Larry Cohen's auspicious debut film is a scathing black comedy set in
Beverly Hills. Cohen  uses his macabre pool setup as a symbolic meaning
for the social unrest and sweeping changes taking place in the country:
of smoking weed and interracial dating becoming more commonplace. There
seemed to be a break down in society and Cohen isn't interested in why
but in what is happening to the country.</P>
<P>Cohen admitted to being influenced by the playwright Joe Orton when he
wrote this film. A film that absurdly dramatizes the murky relationship
of a white middle-class couple living beyond their means in luxury and
the big black buck rapist/robber, who frightens the couple. But he lets
the suspense go to pieces and eases the heavy rape scene with social
comedy and gentrified manners. It is sordidly funny in spots and at
other times it just seems shrill and pretentious. There were too many
flat spots between the mesmerizing opening scene around the swimming
pool and the bleak finale in a sand dune, to make this quirky effort
work entirely. It seemed to be toying with the audience for its
acceptance or disapproval, more than anything else. Bone is a film
desperately trying to get under one's skin, but doesn't have enough
staying power to complete the job, except it leaves one with a lingering
feeling of being unduly provoked and still laughing about it. It fits
nicely into Cohen's concept of film as schlock art.</P>
<P>Middle-aged TV personality Bill (Duggan) is pitching his used-car lot in
the maddening tone snake-oil salesmen use to call attention to their
products. At home, he lounges around his Hollywood styled swimming pool,
as his disinterested wife, Bernadette (Van Patten), suddenly comes to
life when her husband tells her he just saw a rat in the swimming pool
drain. She insists he call the pool service, but he can't get them to
commit to a date. Soon a huge black man, with a disarming smile comes
ambling up to them by the swimming pool, and they think their pool
service reconsidered his request and sent a man over. They tell him
about the rat and he reaches down with his bare hands into the drainpipe
and pulls out a dead rat. They soon find out that he actually came to
rob them and rape her.</P>
<P>He threatens to rape and brutalize Bernadette if Bill doesn't return
from the bank with the full withdrawal of $5,000 from his bank
accountant by the bank's closing time. Cohen will split the screentime
with Bill and Bernadette at this point. Bill has already been exposed
for having secret financial dealings his wife doesn't know about and
faking his bankruptcy, which causes her to resent him more than she
already does.</P>
<P>Bill goes to the bank, but while there changes his mind about getting
the money, instead he hopes that his wife gets killed. While in the bank
he gets diverted by a ditsy young lady (Berlin) hustler, who takes him
back to her place for sex because he reminds her, by his smell, of a
dirty old man she met as a child in a movie theater showing "Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers", when she sneaked into the adult section
because the children's section was too noisy and he let her sit next to
him, pretending to the matron that he was her father, and while Howard
Keel was singing he pulled down her panties and fingered her.</P>
<P>The rapist (Kotto) goes by the name of Bone. When he goes to rape
Bernadette he stops just before he penetrates, which disappoints her.
She asks him what's wrong and the two start conversing and a real
relationship develops. The two think that they have something in common,
which leads them to have sex in a gentle way. They also find that her
husband has a life-insurance policy and they decide to kill him and
collect on the premium.</P>
<P>When the couple meet up with Bill again, the three try to decide their
fate. Bill tries to tempt them with an odd offer to spare his life.
While the couple try to decide if they want to stay together, or go
their separate ways, or just kill Bill.</P>
<P>Bone had its moments in the sun, but couldn't get out of its shadow in
time to say more than boo! What remains chewy about it, is the bizarre
psychology evoked. It is a film that will be pleasing to some much more
than it will be to others; it could be admired for its originality and
for its quirkiness, but there are others who might see it strictly as an
exploitive film. The film had moments when it was both terribly good and
terribly raunchy.</P>
