<PRE>                            A WALK IN THE CLOUDS
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Wow, what a surprise!  A WALK IN THE CLOUDS, starring Keanu Reeves
and directed by Alfonso Arau (LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE), is a magical
film with tremendous heart that offers a much needed change of pace for
summer movie-goers who are tired of Internet thrillers and over budget
action flicks.</P>
<P>     Set in Napa Valley, just after World War II, Reeves plays Paul
Sutton, an idealistic soldier who returns home only to find that what
he wants and what his less than faithful wife want are two separate
things.  A chocolate salesman before the war, Paul sets out for
Northern California with a suitcase and a box of sweets.  On the way,
he meets a beautiful, young woman, Victoria Aragon (Aitana
Sanchez-Gijon), who is pregnant and without a husband.  A tearful
Victoria tells Paul that she dreads returning to her father's vineyard
because he will "kill her."  Paul cannot believe she is serious but
Victoria stresses that her father is old fashioned and will not take
kindly to her not being married.</P>
<P>     Being the chivalrous type, Paul offers to act as her husband for a
day so that her father will not do anything rash.  As he spends more
time on the vineyard, Paul becomes seduced by Victoria's warmth and
beauty and he continues to stay, despite her father's protests.  What
follows is a charming story that emphasizes the importance of tending
to one's family, and of course, love.</P>
<P>     A WALK IN THE CLOUDS is filled with superb performances.  Reeves,
while he still has the taint of Bill and Ted, is restrained enough to
just let the picture sweep him along in all of its glory.  His lack of
range is more than compensated by his sheer likability.  Aitana
Sanchez-Gijon is enchanting as Victoria and plays her with a expert
mixture of strength and vulnerability.  Giancarlo Giannini portrays the
patriarch, Alberto Aragon with tremendous ferocity while adjusting
nicely for his few but crucial tender moments.  And of course, Anthony
Quinn once again gives a brilliant, eccentric performance as Don Pedro,
the grandfather who helps engineer Paul and Victoria's romance.</P>
<P>     Visually, A WALK IN THE CLOUDS is the most unique film of the
year.  Director Arau and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki give us one
dazzling image after another.  Lubezki should certainly be nominated
for his work on this picture as there is not a single frame that is not
special.  Production designer David Gropman has created a rich
environment for Arau to place his action.  The Aragon house, the
vineyard, are so alluring that I wished I could go visit.</P>
<P>     A fine script by Robert Mark Kamen, Mark Miller and Harvey
Weitzman and another superb score by Maurice Jarre (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,
DOCTOR ZHIVAGO) add the final touches to a truly special film.</P>
