<P>_Highlander:_Endgame_ (R) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>        I had never seen a _Highlander_ film nor an episode of its
spinoff television series in my life, so perhaps I'm not exactly not the
most qualified viewer to review the fourth and presumably (hopefully?)
final big screen installment of the cult sci-fi franchise.  However,
having little to no familiarity with the material perhaps makes me an
ideal person to review it--after all, part of an ongoing series shouldn't
only play to the converted.  But that, in a nutshell, is the problem with
_Endgame_.  If you're a fan, there could be something here to keep you
involved and maybe leave you satisfied.  But for newcomers, it's an
uphill battle to make sense of it all and just about impossible to care.</P>
<P>        _Endgame_ is a landmark film for the _Highlander_ faithful for it
brings together for the first time Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert),
the lead character of the features _Highlander_, the critically lambasted
_Highlander_2:_The_Quickening_, and misleadingly titled
_Highlander:_The_Final_Dimension_; and Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), the
star of the syndicated _Highlander_ television series.  As anyone can
deduce from the character names, Connor and Duncan are related, but
exactly how will only be clear to followers of the series.  A throwaway
line of exposition to spell out their relationship is never offered in
_Endgame_.  The film's poster says that they are brothers, and while the
two use the term "a brother" once or twice, the context suggests a more
figurative meaning (as in close friend) than a literal one.  This idea
supported by one flashback scene where we see the two's first meeting;
Connor has to introduce himself to Duncan by name.  If the two were true
brothers, shouldn't they know who the other is?  (OK, maybe they were
separated at birth, but no explanation is ever offered.)</P>
<P>        Maybe I'm dwelling a bit too long on that point, but that's just
about the only thing in _Endgame_ that commands any thought; the plot is
your basic good guys versus bad bit.  Duncan and Connor are Immortals,
but that doesn't mean they are indestructible; Immortals can be killed by
decapitation, and when one is killed, the slain's lifeforce is absorbed
by his or her killer (called a "quickening").  The baddie that Duncan and
Connor must do battle with Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne, criminally
overacting), the Immortal whose father was responsible for the death of
Connor's mother some four centuries ago.  But as is standard issue for
stories like this, Jacob--having well over 600 quickenings to his
credit--is far more powerful than Duncan and Connor combined.</P>
<P>        But this fairly simple story is muddled by the murky _Highlander_
mythos, which scripter Joel Soisson makes no effort to make accessible to
non-cultists.  There is some mumbo jumbo about the Watchers (who, as the
name implies, watch Immortals); every now and again a character or two
that perhaps would be recognizable to those familiar with the series pops
up.  So while non-fans can be superficially amused by director Douglas
Aarniokoski's fast-paced assemblage of basic set pieces--a swordfight
scene here, a gratuitous sex scene there--none of it really adds up to
anything of worth.</P>
<P>        _Highlander_ fans, of course, would argue otherwise.  The film's
numerous flashbacks, which show the heretofore unseen shared past of
Connor and Duncan, should alone be enough to get them worked up, while
the uninitiated will struggle to comprehend what the big deal is all
about.  _Highlander:_Endgame_ is a film made for the devotees, and I'm
sure I speak for everyone else when I say that I am more than happy to
simply let that select group have and keep it.</P>
