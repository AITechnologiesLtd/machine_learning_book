                                 TARZAN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Tarzan the Ape Man gets the Disney treatment this year.  For some
classic characters (Snow White, Bambi), the transition has been a
positive one.  For others (Pocahontas), it's been a disaster.
Thankfully, TARZAN is among the former group.</P>
<P>     The last time we saw Tarzan, he was saving a Lost City in the worst
film of 1998 (shockingly titled TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY).  The story is
a bit more traditional this time, with Tarzan adopted by gorillas after
his human parents are killed by a leopard.  When he grows up, a group of
British explorers stumble upon him, and after the `You Tarzan, me Jane'
exchange, the British bad guy, Clayton, decides he's going to take all
the gorillas back to Britain for sale.  Adventure ensues, along with a
love story and singing.</P>
<P>     For an animated Disney plot, it's considerably better than recent
fare.  In fact, it might be too good – the kids in our audience were
more often found cowering in the aisles than watching the picture from
their seats.  Be aware that TARZAN has its share of adult moments
(including a hanging, seen in shadow) – more than I'd thought
appropriate.  The animation is top-notch, of course, and most of that
will be wasted on the youngsters, too.</P>
<P>     TARZAN is also (thankfully--most thankfully) light on the musical
numbers.  There's only one song performed by the characters, when the
gorillas take over the human camp and do a rendition of `Stomp.'  The
rest of the music is all in the background, fairly well done by Phil
Collins.  Again, it's awfully nice to *not* have to put up with a diva
or two on the soundtrack.  Even the whole talking animals thing makes
sense this time: Tarzan can speak to them.  The other humans cannot.
Well done.</P>
<P>     As for the annoying sidekicks (voiced by Rosie O'Donnell and Wayne
Knight), I leave them for either your mirth or your displeasure.
Ultimately, this Disneyfied TARZAN ends up somewhere between THE LION
KING and HERCULES.  You can decide for yourself exactly where.</P>
