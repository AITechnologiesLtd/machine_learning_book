<P>_What_Dreams_May_Come_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is, in the most literal sense, a "dream movie," a
visionary exercise in the use of dreamlike imagery, which, in turn, helps
create a sublime romantic fantasy.  The centerpiece of the film is a
breathtaking tour of the afterlife, which is taken by one Chris Nielsen
(Robin Williams) after he dies in a car accident.  But while his spirit is
in heaven, Chris's soul remains with that of his soulmate, his emotionally
fragile wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), who had never fully recovered from
the years-ago deaths, also by car accident, of their two children.</P>
<P>_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is nothing short of a visual marvel.  Eugenio
Zanetti's production design, Eduardo Serra's cinematography, and the
spectacular special effects supervised by Ellen M. Somers paint a wildly
imaginative vision of the afterlife.  This is quite literally the case in
the scene where Chris first arrives in Heaven, which manifests itself in
the form of one of Annie's paintings.  It is perhaps the most visually
ambitious scene in a film overflowing with visual invention, with Chris
swimming in the still-wet paint and the backdrop remaining as
two-dimensional as any canvas.</P>
<P>But the film is much more than a showcase for the latest in filmmaking
technology.  As with his last film, 1993's astonishing
_Map_of_the_Human_Heart_, director Vincent Ward taps into the very core of
romantic yearning, coming up with an admittedly sappy but no less poignant
tale of true, pure love.  There are some powerful moments, most notably a
scene where Annie, in a fit of anger and grief, attempts to destroy a
painting which, unknown to her, Chris and his spiritual guide Albert (Cuba
Gooding Jr.) is inside.  Of course, moments like those are carried over the
top by the efforts of the actors.  Williams, as always, is effortlessly
likable, and he and Sciorra share a natural, magical chemistry.  One has no
trouble at all believing that these two are indeed soulmates, and,
consequently, has no trouble falling under the film's entrancing spell. </P>
