<PRE>                                 THE WAR
                       A film review by John Walker
                        Copyright 1995 John Walker</PRE>
<P>In brief: In a bizarre way, I like THE WAR a lot--but for something
     other folks don't seem to have noticed.  I think that's because
     there are two different movies here.  As *talk*, THE WAR is an
     anti-war message piece with supporting subplots; its message is,
     "War makes us crazy."</P>
<PRE>     But the heart of the film is its action.  And the message of the
     most of the *action* is, "You've got to learn what's worth
     fighting for."</PRE>
<P>     Most people seem to have noticed only the talk.  Which is
     strange--doesn't the *action* count?  It's as if even the
     film makers--director Jon Avnet and screenwriter Kathy McWorter,
     in particular--were unaware of the underlying message.</P>
<PRE>                             <<The story>></PRE>
<P>     It's 1970 in dirt-poor Juliette, Mississippi.  The center of THE
WAR is Stu Simmons (Elijah Wood).  But he is crowded around with family
members whose stories are major subplots, all interlocked.  The most
important is his father Stephen (Kevin Costner).  Stephen is a Viet Nam
veteran who couldn't hold a job after returning.  He's back with the
family again after being hospitalized for recurring nightmares.  One
strand in THE WAR is Stephen's interaction with his children and his
warning against the dangers of violence--that in war, we go crazy, we
do things we'll be ashamed of.</P>
<P>     While Stephen was in the Nam, the family lost their house to
termites and County condemnation.  Now they live in a tiny, sort of
squalid little cottage, not much better than a shack, with other
similar houses crammed together cheek-by-jowl.  Stu's mother Lois (Mare
Winningham) holds the family together working two jobs.</P>
<P>     There's also Stu's sister--the film's narrator--Lidia (Lexi
Randall).  If you've seen the trailers, you know that her theme is
racial harmony.  She accepts her two black friends, Elvadine (LaToya
Chisholm) and Amber (Charlette Julius), as equals, and stands up for
them against a segregation-minded summer-school teacher, Miss Strapford
(Christine Baranski).</P>
<P>     But the main theme is Stu--and his tree fort.  Lidia and her
friends have gotten the materials for it, and he'll build it with them
and his two friends, Chet (Adam Henderson) and Marsh (Brennan
Gallagher).  Unfortunately, the girls got the materials from the
junkyard of a local drunk, Mr. Lipnicki (Raynor Scheine), whose six
kids are apparently the local bullies and thugs.  When they find out,
we'll have The War for which THE WAR is named.</P>
<PRE>             <<Can you stand a tear-jerker with sermons?>></PRE>
<P>     If you've seen any reviews or previews, you should already know
whether THE WAR will likely turn you off.  If you can't stand sermons,
you're in trouble.</P>
<P>     The trailer shows that Miss Strapford has put the black kids in
the back.  And it gives us Lidia's sermon on the subject.  I have no
problem with a 12-year-old *feeling* the way Lidia did.  But (except
for the rustic grammar) being able to give that speech would mean that
momma and poppa were profs at the local college.  (The sermon-sensitive
can be reassured on one point, though: This is *not* a hate letter to
the South.  Miss Strapford is the only one who really drags race in,
and she's more dorky than malicious.)</P>
<P>     Costner, too, has lines that smack of college followed by years
writing editorials for the crusading small-town weekly newspaper
beloved of film makers in the 30s and 40s.  He's Will Rogers updated and
suspicious of violence in all forms.  He's the peaceable guy in the
western who saves the town from the bad guys.</P>
<P>     Momma doesn't have too many lines, but she could be a saint in
some 30s/40s film about farm workers or factory help.  She's the rock
of strength who's still thoroughly womanly.  It may be 1970, but mom
and dad remind me of Depression-era photos from the Farm Security
Administration.  And their speeches and sermons have attracted the most
attention.</P>
<P>     But *Stu* is the center of THE WAR.  And it's as if Stu's role was
written separately from those of the others.  Stu seems more real.
True, he's more rough-hewn eloquent than any 12-year-old I've ever
known.  True, he has major "speeches".  But they seem to arise out of
his character rather than out of a political tract.  He is saying what
he's feeling rather than informing others what they ought to feel or
do.</P>
<P>     The only other characters who struck me as real were the Lipnicki
kids.  (By the way, like Stu, *they don't give sermons*.)  It's like
McWorter had really seen something like this as a kid, and then years
later added in other characters and events to make the "meaning" clear.</P>
<PRE>                            <<The acting>></PRE>
<P>     Is the *acting* why I find Stu believable, but not the rest?  Wood
is just massively talented, after all.  He makes even his "speeches"
real and moving.  Maybe he just did a 12-year-old boy better than
Costner, Winningham, and Randall did their roles.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, I can't imagine *anyone* being able to handle some
of their lines without seeming preachy.  Take one of Stephen's comments
to Stu:</P>
<PRE>           I can't tell you never to fight.  But if you want to know
       what I think.  ....  I think the only thing that truly keeps
       people safe and happy is love.  And in the absence of love,
       there's nothing in this world worth fightin' for.</PRE>
<P>     In fact (if you're not sermon-allergic), Costner made even the
sermons seem real.  And at the end of a confrontation with Lipnicki, he
didn't even seem preachy.</P>
<P>     But I said there were two stories in THE WAR.  If the vocal one is
the sermons, what about the underlying one?</P>
<PRE>                        <<How do wars start?>></PRE>
<P>     Practically from word one, I was at a distance from THE WAR.
*Everyone* speaks Southern.  My background is small-town, but it's
small-town Rhode Island.  I haven't dealt with people with
"un-colleged" Southern accents since I was in the Navy.  (And they
didn't do sermons.)</P>
<P>     Maybe it was the slight culture shock that made me compare the
rules of my own kidhood with how things worked in THE WAR.  The
Lipnickis say Stu's trespassing on "their" land near the junkyard.  But
is it theirs?  Lidia says they're squatters even on the junkyard
itself.  And there's stuff in the junkyard from the Simmons's condemned
house.  Nonetheless, with Lidia is a thoroughly calculating kid, and
with her decision to heist stuff from the junkyard, she crossed a major
boundary.</P>
<P>     Suburbanization has been less destructive in Rhode Island than
elsewhere.  Even today, a "Private" or "No Trespassing" sign strikes me
as profoundly bad taste.  As a kid I went wherever I went, and so did
all the other kids.  But once someone put that sign up, it was to be
respected (or violated with only the greatest caution and suitable
guilt if caught).  People who put up such signs might be paranoid
jerks.  But it was *their* property.  That was that.</P>
<P>     So also junkyards.  It might be worthless trash, but it was
*their* worthless trash.  (Junkyards can still be still a *cause
celebre* back home--the owners are seen as the victims of new
suburbanites who want to drive out those who were there first.)</P>
<P>     Without much context, I mentioned the property-right proscriptions
of small-town Rhode Island to a friend.  He groaned.  It seemed rigid,
puritanical, unrealistic.</P>
<P>     But stop and think--if those rules had been observed, the War in
THE WAR would never have happened.</P>
<P>     Can we have an anti-war film that doesn't ask how wars *start*?
*The War* never gives a sermon about trespass, about turf battles,
about the ambiguities of squatters, about filching junk--but without
them, there would have been no film.</P>
<PRE>                         <<When do we fight?>></PRE>
<P>     Now, a story.  A friend in my Reserve unit was a pacifist.  (He'd
already been on active duty: real life has its paradoxes!)  He was in
college and working in a factory to pay bills.  There was this one guy
who just harassed him endlessly--I mean, a college kid, a pacifist,
why not?  So, finally, my friend decked him.  After that, the other guy
was his best friend at work!</P>
<P>     (Understanding the guy was an intellectual problem for my friend,
matching the moral problem he had with decking him.)</P>
<P>     I'll give no spoilers about THE WAR, but I'll say that we don't
get the tidy outcome my friend did.  Nonetheless, the usefulness --
even the *need*--of standing up and fighting for what's *yours* is an
absolutely essential element in THE WAR--for *both* Stu and the
Lipnickis.</P>
<P>     And the Lipnicki kids are sort of like that factory worker.
They're not necessarily bad kids; they're probably better than we might
expect them to be, considering their father.  They're thugs, sort of,
but are they really bullies?  We don't see them seeking smaller kids to
pick on; it's more that they run roughshod, that they go too far with a
grudge.</P>
<PRE>     How do you deal with them?  Stu had to decide.</PRE>
<PRE>                 <<Loose ends, unexplained decisions>></PRE>
<P>     THE WAR appears to be very deliberately written.  As *talk*, all
the threads are tied together; there are no loose ends.  Everything is
explained.  To which my response is a polite, "That's nice."</P>
<P>     But the *action*, the story about Stu and the Lipnicki kids is
*all* loose ends.  We don't know how it began.  We don't get a speech
from Stu explaining all his motives.  (Not that we need any.)  We don't
know how Stu and the Lipnickis viewed each other or their war
afterward.  We don't know what they "did with it".</P>
<P>     The underlying story is live and real.  It asks why we get into
messes with each other.  For me, it demands we ask whether dour
small-towners might have figured out a way to avoid a lot of nastiness.</P>
<P>     It also asks what we do when when people go too far.  Yes, it
intersects with the talk in warning that the violence is risky--don't
let it get out of hand.  (It might be interesting to consider whether
the *action* of THE WAR could serve as an allegory of U.S. involvement
in Viet Nam.)</P>
<P>     In any event, the story of the action isn't a sermon; it's a
challenge.  It doesn't come back with a clear answer.</P>
<PRE>     That's up to *us*.</PRE>
