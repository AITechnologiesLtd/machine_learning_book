<P>     Ouisa and Flan Kittredge (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland)
live and move in the upper echelons of New York society, enjoying the
fortunes gleaned from their business ventures--brokering art objects
for exceptional profit.  On a night when they're entertaining a South
African millionaire named Geoffrey (Ian McKellen), Paul (Will Smith)
enters their lives.  A con man from the streets of Boston, Paul is
looking for an easy mark, and finds it in the Kittredges and their rich
guest.  He sells them a story about being the son of actor Sydney
Poitier, cooks them dinner, and ends up being invited to spend the
night.  From that moment on, Paul becomes one thing to Flan--an
anecdote to tell friends, but something different and more important to
Ouisa--a mirror in which she can see the emptiness of her own
existence.</P>
<P>     Even if I hadn't known beforehand that SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
was adapted from a stage play, the script makes it obvious.  This is a
"talky" motion picture that splits its time between skewering the
vacuous lives of people like the Kittredges and examining the forces
that mould Paul into the person he becomes.  Chameleon-like, he is not
just an imposter, but a man who literally becomes the person he claims
to be--and during SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, he pretends to be a lot
of people.  However, there are certain elements of Paul's basic
nature--namely his homosexuality and insecurity--that follow him
regardless of which identity he dons.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is the best part of SIX DEGREES; it absolutely
sparkles with wit and intelligence.  Sometimes it gets a bit too
pretentious--the discussion between Paul, Ouisa, and Flan on
imagination is one such example--but overall it's a biting and
satirical indictment on those who possess ideals as high in the sky as
their social standing.  Paul may be the con-man, but it doesn't take
much insight to see that Ouisa and Flan are no more "real" than he is.</P>
<P>     The title SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION refers to the theory that
every man or woman is separated from any other man or woman by no more
than six people.  It's an appropriate title for the film, since the
themes of identity and relationships are integral to the plot.  Ouisa
makes a telling comment when she remarks that Paul has done more for
her in one evening than her children did in a lifetime.</P>
<P>     There are several hilarious moments, each of which requires
understanding of the characters and the author's motives.  Especially
memorable is a scene where various parents confront their collegiate
students, and we get to see just how silly are the ideals held dear by
the people inhabiting SIX DEGREES' world.</P>
<P>     For all that most of the movie is well-scripted and
crisply-directed (Fred Schepisi keeps things moving at an amazing
clip), the ending is a letdown.  Not only does it lack the depth and
sparkle of what came before, but its attempt to hammer home a message
already delivered seems unnecessary and tedious.  At best, Ouisa's
final decision is weakly motivated, and chimes a dissonant chord.</P>
<P>     Acting-wise, this is Stockard Channing's movie, and her
performance, a reprisal of the role she played on stage, is far above
that of any of her co-stars.  The only other player of note is Will
Smith, who shows that he can do more than the silly comedy of a weekly
television program.  Smith's Paul doesn't have the impact or strength
of personality of Channing's Ouisa, but he never gets lost in the
background.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION will succeed or fail for the
individual viewer based on their expectations and preferences.  This is
an "offbeat" movie, and its presentation of universal themes is far
from mainstream methods.  It has quite a bit to say, and gets most of
the messages across while entertaining the audience.  The greatest
fault of SIX DEGREES is assuming a level of intelligence throughout,
then abandoning that belief at the very end.</P>
