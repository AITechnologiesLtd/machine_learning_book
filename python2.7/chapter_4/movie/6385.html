<PRE>                                DAYLIGHT
               A film review by Christopher E. Meadows
                Copyright 1996 Christopher E. Meadows</PRE>
<PRE>[PG-13]
Directed by Rob Cohen; starring Sylvester Stallone
My rating: 8/10 (**** out of *****)</PRE>
<P>In _Daylight_, Sylvester Stallone breaks no new ground, cinematically
speaking, but he covers familiar territory quite well.</P>
<P>Yesterday, as I was going about my business in the university
bookstore, I noticed this stand with these _Daylight_ movie posters on
it.  I had never heard of the movie, so I stopped by to check it out.
It turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for
people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering.  So,
I shrugged, thought, "Hey, they probably won't give me the card
anyway, and I could always use a free movie," so I signed up.  All in
all, I don't think I got that bad of a deal, either.</P>
<P>Rob Cohen, who has previously brought us such films as _Dragon: The
Bruce Lee Story_ and, more recently, _Dragonheart_ (gee, I wonder if
he likes dragons for some reason?  You think?), now brings us a very
nicely executed disaster picture, with FX by Industrial Light and
Magic, about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy
tunnel between New York and New Jersey.</P>
<P>Sylvester Stallone plays Kit Latura, who is essentially a carbon copy
of the character he played in _Cliffhanger_: a paramedic on the outs
because he made a mistake that got people killed.  When the crisis
hits, he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon
himself to go in and get everybody out.  There are other similarities
to _Cliffhanger_, too; perhaps the only real difference is that
_Cliffhanger_ had a villain, where _Daylight_'s bad guy is Mother
Nature.  In fact, had the two movies been made in Hong Kong, this
might have been titled _Cliffhanger II_--it bears the same
relationship to that film that most HK film "sequels" do to their
predecessors.</P>
<P>The first half-hour of _Daylight_ is setup.  Subplots are woven, and
the mechanism of the disaster is assembled.  We meet all the important
people...toxic waste disposal truck drivers; a young, frustrated,
jilted, rejected playwright; a family struggling to stay together; an
older couple and their dog; a truckload of prisoners; an ad agency
executive; a tunnel police officer; Stallone; and others.  We watch
the trucks trundle toward their destination; we watch Stallone and so
many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons.  And
then, thirty minutes into the film, _BOOM_.  And it's a big one.</P>
<P>>From there on in, it's Sly Stallone to the rescue.  And rescue he
does, enduring batterings, beatings, falls, repeated immersion in
34-degree water, explosions, mud, rats, and constant setbacks, before
going on to save the day, Sly-style.  Again...there's nothing new
here.</P>
<P>And yet there doesn't need to be.  The fun of _Daylight_ is not in the
story but in the execution.  The special-effects are first-rate,
thanks to Industrial Light and Magic, and the ensemble cast works well
together.  Once the film hits its stride, it carries the viewer right
along to the finish, with very few jars along the way.</P>
