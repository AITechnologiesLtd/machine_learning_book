<PRE>KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Todd Holland
Writer: Charlie Peters (based on the book by Frank Parkin)
Starring: Richard Dreyfus, Jenna Elfman, Lily Tomlin, Natasha Lyonne,
Gregory Smith, Carl Michael Linder, David Ogden Stiers</P>
<P>"Krippendorf's Tribe" is a film that is funny some of the time, but for the
rest, we're left with a really weak one-note comedy which never goes
anywhere, and never enlightens past its outrageous premise.  It's a film
filled with some talented (and not-so-talented) actors who you can tell had
a good time making this film, but just because making a film is fun doesn't
mean the movie will be.  In the end, "Krippendorf's Tribe" is exactly what
was hinted at in the trailers: an occasionally witty film that never
reaches beyond its boundaries.</P>
<P>As you probably know from the trailers, "Krippendorf's Tribe" deals with
James Krippendorf (Richard Dreyfus), an anthropologist who was searching
for a lost tribe in New Guinea, but on his search his wife died, leaving
him to raise their three kids (played by Natasha Lyonne, Gregory Smith, and
Carl Michael Linder), and, of course, he didn't find the lost tribe.  His
days consist of him roaming around the house drearily and spewing out droll
one-liners (he picks up a carton of milk, reads the date, and says "April
3rd?!  I need a year!").</P>
<P>Unfortunately, his days of depressed slothness have rendered him ignorant
to the fact that he has to give a speech one night, and the day before
that, a perky assistant of his, Veronica Micelli (Jenna Elfman, from
"Dharma and Greg"), stops by, and tells him.  He tries to make up
something, but ends up lying through his teeth, naming the tribe
"Shelmikedmu," after his three kids names, and coming up with some bogus
practices, like the family unit is run by a single father.</P>
<P>But he needs proof.  So he begins filming false movies of rituals in his
back yard, using his three children, and, later on, including a drunken
Veronica, who, luckily for him, still has a crush on him.  Meanwhile, a
stuck-up colleague of his (Lily Tomlin) is out to prove him wrong, and
journeys with her assistant to New Guinea to track down the tribe herself. 
So James has to come up with even more lies to cover him, or he'll be going
to jail, or be sued, or, worse off, have his reputation tarnished.</P>
<P>Sounds funny?  I didn't think so either.  Most of the time, we get lame
jokes, and some really forced situations which we, the audience, are
expected to swallow.  The premise in itself does have some promise, though.
 In the hands of better filmmakers, this could have turned into something
that was brilliantly funny, maybe even a little satirical.  But this film
takes the easy way out: never really going anywhere that is interesting or
even intelligent, and never trying to go beyond what the trailers hint at. 
In fact, this film doesn't even really have an ending; it's almost a redo
of the beginning.</P>
<P>"Krippendorf's Tribe" is set up so that it moves in circles: we get a
problem set up, the problem apparently solved, then another problem set up.
 And James never changes at all.  This film is too lighthearted not to
bring him to a conclusion that perhaps his life is really not in the best
position, and maybe he should change it.  The only thing that changes is
his family's respect for him, but come on, how could they respect this guy?
 I mean, sure he's likable, but he's a baldfaced liar who never figures out
that lies are bringing him more and more dilemnas.  In fact, not only does
no one realize the error of their ways, but they get worse (one character
starts off being kinda likable, and ends up much worse off than she was
before).</P>
<P>It's too bad, because there are some geniuinely funny moments, mostly due
to the fact that the lead actors are actually good.  Just because it's a
bad comedy doesn't mean it doesn't have some good comic performances. 
Richard Dreyfus is not only a great actor, but a comic genius, and here we
get to see him doing what he does best: acting immensely stressed in
extremely tight situations.  He brings this film above what would be bad
comedy hell, and into something which we see just to see him.  He's
partnered up with Jenna Elfman, who's also a great comic actor in her own
respect, and the two have some really geniune comic chemistry.</P>
<P>Most of the supporting cast is wasted (most notably David Ogden Stiers, who
is brought in then suffled aside), but Lily Tomlin, though horribly
underwritten, is funny a couple times, and Natasha Lyonne, the narrating
daughter from "Everyone Says I Love You," hits the right notes as James
bitter daughter.</P>
<P>What's left is a film that I laughed at a couple times, but the rest of the
time was pretty cold towards.  If the film had gone somewhere other than in
circles, it may have been a good, fun comedy.  If it had expanded on its
themes, it may have even been a classic (I know that's a bit of a
stretch...).  But what we have is only marginally funny, and highly
forgettable.  But at least it has Richard Dreyfus, which was a start.</P>
