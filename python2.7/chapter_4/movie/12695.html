<PRE>Godzilla
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<P>* (out of ****)
In this re-make of the 1954 Japanese monster film, Godzilla is transformed
into a "Jurassic Park" copy who swims from the South Pacific to New York for
no real reason and trashes the town. Although some of the destruction is
entertaining for a while, it gets old fast. 
The film often makes no sense (a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in
subway tunnels), sports second-rate effects (the baby Godzillas seem to be one
computer effect multiplied on the screen), lame jokes (Mayor Ebert and his
assistant Gene are never funny), horrendous acting (even Matthew Broderick is
dull) and an unbelievable love story (why would anyone want to get back
together with Maria Pitillo's character?).</P>
<P>There are other elements of the film that fall flat, but going on would just
be a waste of good words.  Only for die-hard creature feature fans, this
might be fun if you could check your brain at the door. I couldn't.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more
disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both "Fear And Loathing" and
"Godzilla" in the same evening.)</P>
