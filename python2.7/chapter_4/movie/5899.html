<PRE>                                FISHER KING
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  0</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years 
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted. 
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details 
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     I would like to share with others that THE FISHER KING is on my
top of my worst movies of the year list.  Yes, I know the critics are
going gaga over it.</P>
<P>     I found the Jeff Bridges character to be a total loser.  His
character taught me nothing other than it is pretty awful spending a
lot of time with an alcoholic dead beat even if he is only on a movie
screen.</P>
<P>     I found Robin Williams's character somewhat better, but spending
hours a bum with a mental problem was not exactly terrific either.
Yes, I know I could use the politically correct term, "homeless", and
then I would have to view him reverentially.</P>
<P>     After an hour I walked out.  I only wish I had been smart enough
to do it sooner.  I found that the images, especially that of Jeff
Bridges, stayed with me for a while, and I did not like it.  He was
someone I wish I had never met.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
