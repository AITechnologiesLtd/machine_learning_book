<P>'CON AIR' EXHILARATES INTO A SLAM BANG EXAMPLE OF SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF</P>
<P>At first I thought 'Con Air' would be just another mindless action picture
filled with explosions, shootings, brawls and just about everything including
the kitchen sink but it has much more under the surface in its technique,
style and execution.  Although quite unbelievable at times it does use the
theory of suspension of disbelief quite well and is a satisfying way to spend
two hours in a movie theatre.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage stars as a military soldier whose training makes him a lethal
weapon and one night while defending his wife he killed a man in a drunken
brawl and was sentenced to eight years in prison.  The movie shows small
scenes pieced together of his life in prison over the opening credits mostly
and the movie then picks up upon his release from prison.  He is to be
transported by plane to his destination of freedom.  Unfortunately for him
the plane also contains some of the most dangerous, smartest and low life
criminals in the United States.  Their leader (John Malkovich) practically
steals the show and the prisoners take control of the plane and the rest is
pretty obvious.  </P>
<P>'Con Air' is extremely slick and well paced and has appropriate humour from
time to time.  The criminals make the movie's colourful observations known to
the audience and the three outstanding portraits aside from Malkovich come
from Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi and Nicolas Cage whose character is a nice
contrast and while he is a convicted criminal himself, he is the saving grace
in making the predatory criminals see that they aren't as invincible as they
think they are.</P>
<P>Cage is truly a gifted and smart performer whose risks in recent years in
choosing quirky and off beat roles have paid off handsomely and the icing on
the cake came with his Oscar win for Best Actor in 1995's 'Leaving Las
Vegas'.  'Con Air' is the kind of action film with good character development
and is not for the faint of heart but is for those who like their violent
action mixed with a sense of style and exhilarating stunts.</P>
