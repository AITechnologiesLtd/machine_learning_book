<P>Synopsis: Committed to an asylum, the Marquis de Sade (Rush) continues to 
publish pornographic literature, aided by young maid Madeleine (Winslet). 
Abbe Coulmier (Phoenix), who runs the hospital, disapproves of the 
stories, but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure. De Sade's craft 
and life are threatened when the Emperor dispatches Dr Royer-Collard 
(Michael Caine) to stop the Marquis' work, permanently.</P>
<P>Review: "Quills" is an exploration of the Marquis de Sade: his madness, 
his cruelty and his perversion, his obsession with sex in any form, no 
matter how obscene. But "Quills" also details the Marquis' determination: 
to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path, and to propagate his 
words to the masses. The extent to which de Sade is willing to go to 
practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements, as 
when de Sade scribes a story in his own blood, or narrates a tale via of a 
chain of fellow inmates, cell to cell. To provide a contrast with the 
Marquis, Wright involves him with two very different characters. One is 
the Abbe, a handsome, charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by 
his oath to God. The Abbe lusts for Madeleine, but it is the wizened 
Marquis who is able to have her. And then there is Royer-Collard, a 
hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the Marquis' motley 
creations. Rush is splendid as de Sade, utterly inhabiting the character. 
Kaufman's direction is fine, and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre 
humour to the grim proceedings. The plot itself is rather mundane and 
plays out unsurprisingly, but this is virtually unimportant. For two 
hours, "Quills" acquaints us with the Marquis de Sade -- and, more 
frightening still, allows us brief insight into his scatological soul.</P>
