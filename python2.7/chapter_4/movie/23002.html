<P>The best part of Scream 3 is Jenny McCarthy in a ditsy
Hollywood-actress role that is humorous to both the uneducated
movie-going rookie and the seasoned Hitchcock fan (there are
references to his work throughout the film that the trained eye should
have a relatively easy time catching). Then, within 15 minutes of the
movie starting she.d'oh! It's okay though, because the second best
part of the movie is good old Liev Schreiber. Then, before the opening
credits even get started his character.d'oh! The third best thing?
Well, I'll have to think about it.</P>
<P>Obviously, the film is a teenage slasher flick. Not only do respected
actors and attractive Playmates get butchered, but a head roles, a
fire engulfs and some other victims have their last supper Benihana
style. The production, which actually prides itself in being and
spoofing a cliche-filled horror flick also uses flickering candle
light, bullet-proof vests, nightmares and, who could forget, a finale
in the dark.</P>
<P>Those of you not already acquainted with Scream and Scream 2 will
likely find little more than confusion in the third and final
installment which neglects to thoroughly lay out its
background. Basically, a third Stab movie is being made based on our
protagonist, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the rest of the
gang's frightening adventures a few years back. Someone involved in
making the movie decides it is time to butcher Sidney and Co., but,
for artistic reasons of course, chooses to do it in the order that
they are terminated in the script. From there, it is all chaos,
scream, blood and (a?)  masked murderer. Confused? Then you either
need to take a couple of trips to Blockbuster or, more wisely, forget
that this movie even exists.</P>
<P>Since the film does enjoy its status as a popcorn horror flick, many
jokes are cracked at the genre. Just as in Scream 2, the rules of
engagement are explained by an expert on sequels and trilogies- never
mind that he died in the last movie. Hardcore fans of the Scream trio
anticipate this scene as some sort of a holy grail. That is all fine
and good, but, unlike in the previous works, our expert proves to be
wrong.</P>
<P>Horror junkies who are familiar with Hitchcock will find some nicely
tucked away jokes throughout Scream 3. Similarly, those familiar with
the underground success of Silent Bob and Jay will be pleasantly
surprised to see them cameo even though Kevin Smith isn't involved
with this movie.</P>
<P>Although the aforementioned cinema tidbits are stashed away throughout
the work, don't expect to find any deep meaning or social commentary
in your excavations. The movie does attempt to touch on family ties
and the psychology of a homicidal maniac, but things get just about as
deep as the knife in Jenny McCarthy's throat.</P>
<P>The movie also has some more minor faults that hardly help its case. A
fine example is when star Courtney Cox's hair grows about 16 inches in
three minutes. It is also interesting that obvious victims are always
abandoned by their bodyguards or the police right before they either
answer a scary phone call or meet their destiny.</P>
<P>The third best thing? Hmm. I got it! The establishing shot of the
movie: the famous Hollywood sign. Maybe that is some sort of
foreshadowing.</P>
