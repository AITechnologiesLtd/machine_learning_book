<PRE>HOLY MAN (Touchstone)
Directed by Stephen Herek</PRE>
<PRE>        "Holy Man" commits an unpardonable sin.</PRE>
<P> It offers up Eddie Murphy in his most endearing characterization in
years, then keeps him on the sidelines for what seems like ages. Forget the
placement of his name above the title; as he was in the infamous "Best
Defense," Murphy should have been billed in this picture as "Strategic Guest
Star."</P>
<P> He's also the only conceivable reason for anyone to sit through
"Holy Man," an otherwise cardboard comedy which spends far too much of its
running time giving us updates on the budding love affair between ambitious
TV producer Ricky (Jeff Goldblum, behaving like Woody Allen after a few
doses of Ecstacy) and media analyst Kate (Kelly Preston, whose stiff and
charmless performance guarantees she'll continue to be identified primarily
for her real-life role as Mrs. John Travolta). This will please the dozen or
so people nationwide who came to see Goldblum do his standard yammering and
yelping and will greatly frustrate the rest of us who'd rather watch Murphy
skewer the home-shopping craze.</P>
<P> "Holy Man" takes place in the high-pressure Good Buy Shopping
Network, where hard-up celebrities desperately try to unload useless
merchandise -- Betty White pitches an aphrodisiac perfume called Clam, James
Brown shills for the Soul Survivor System, etc. Ricky's job is on the line
after 27 consecutive months of unimpressive sales; Kate is hunting for
someone who can give the channel an identity.</P>
<P> Their prayers are answered when the enigmatic, soul-searching
wanderer G (Murphy) crashes the studio, letting viewers know the truth about
the lousy products GBSN touts; typical of their wares is an in-toilet bidet
called Lil' Squirt which dispenses "a refreshing kiss of mist" to the
derriere. G quickly becomes "the biggest thing to hit home-shopping since
the cubic zirconium," although why customers would purchase any of this junk
after G has shown its worthlessness is one of the many questions left unansw
ered by Tom Schulman's half-baked screenplay.</P>
<P> There's a terrific movie to be made about home-shopping and the
folks addicted to it, but "Holy Man" is not that film. Murphy's interactions
with GBSN salespeople like Florence Henderson are truly funny, and his
encounter with a terminally vain Morgan Fairchild would be hilarious had we
not seen it in the film's commercials.</P>
<P> Unfortunately Schulman decided to make these satiric swipes a
subplot, and the Murphy-less scenes with Kate and Ricky seem to drone on
interminably. Goldblum is irritatingly manic while Preston seems utterly
hollow; her smiles look like someone slapped a pair of wax lips on her face.
The only notable directorial touch provided by Stephen Herek is the ending
of every third or fourth scene with a long fade to black, which will make
programmers happy when "Holy Man" debuts on TV a couple of years from now.</P>
<P> After a serious career lull in the first half of the '90s, Murphy
seems unsure of his ability to carry a picture, playing second fiddle to
wise-cracking animals in "Doctor Dolittle" and hiding behind special-effects
in "The Nutty Professor." His winning performance here suggests it's time to
drop that modesty and take control of his projects again. Certainly "Holy
Man" would be infinitely easier to sit through if it had larger helpings of
its supposed star; how sadly fitting a movie that warns against believing in
advertising turns out to have been promoted deceptively.
