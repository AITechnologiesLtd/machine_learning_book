<PRE>LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR (1977)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Brooks
Writer: Richard Brooks (based on the novel by Judith Rossner)
Starring: Diane Keaton, Tuesday Weld, William Atherton, Richard Kiley,
Richard Gere, Alan Feinstein, Priscilla Pointer, LeVar Burton, Richard
Bright, Tom Berenger</P>
<P>It's obvious what Richard Brooks' intentions were for making "Looking for
Mr. Goodbar": he not only wanted to show how leading two lives ultimately
results in tragedy, but he also wanted to make a very unsubtle statement
against nightclubbing and sleeping with lots of men, an infamous pasttime
of the late 70s right up until the explosion of the AIDs virus. 
Unfortunately as a tale of two lives, it's too ridiculous, and as a
condemnation of promiscuous life styles, it's too preachy and ends all too
conveniently.</P>
<P>The film's real strength is in how it creates a certain kind of world from
a certain kind of perspective.  The entire structure and everything that
goes on is customized so that it fits that of the film's protagonist,
Theresa Dunn (Diane Keaton, the same year she won an Oscar for "Annie
Hall"), a young woman who by day is a first grade teacher of deaf kids, and
by night is out in the bars, picking up men, taking them back to her flat,
and having her way with them.</P>
<P>It's a proposterous situation because the two parts are just too different
from one another to be taken seriously, which is part of why we can't
totally be swayed by its message, at least in this way.  But what the film
lacks in literal substance it somewhat makes up in the way in which it's
presented.  "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" is an incredibly frustrating film to
watch because it is told entirely from her perspective, and as such we
often see some of her dreams and wishes.  Take for example the beginning
when we are introduced to her in the classroom learning about how to teach
young kids: she imagines everyone in class leaves and that she ends up
making out with her teacher (Alan Feinstein), but then we see that it was a
daydream, but in the next scene she is actually making love with her
teacher in his apartment after class.  What is real and what isn't, this
film often asks, and we can only answer a little bit later on.</P>
<P>What "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" feels like to the audience is being Theresa
watching herself and everything she feels and thinks, and then making a
critique about what was done.  In the beginning, Theresa lives at home and
feels suffocated by everyone around her, especially her ultra-Catholic
tyrant of a father, played with gusto by Richard Kiley.  As such, these
scenes feel claustrophobic and difficult to watch, and when the scene
shifts away from the house and her family, one feels like taking a breath
of fresh air, just like Theresa probably does.</P>
<P>Once moving out of her family's house, she moves into an apartment building
with her sister, Katherine (a glowing Tuesday Weld, who received an Oscar
nomination for her role), where she begins to bring various men home.  Over
the course of the film, there are only about five men we see her with, but
they constantly reappear, so much that we can barely keep recollection of
them, as Theresa no doubt does.  There's James (William Atherton), the
clean-cut all-around good guy who her father likes, but who does have a
darker side to him like all people.  Then there's Tony Lapanto (a pre-fame
Richard Gere), an overly-confident schmuck who decides to show up inside
her apartment whenever he decides he wants to boink her...or do a bizarre
ritual dance.</P>
<P>And of course, there's her job, which she gradually begins to ignore as the
film goes on.  Although being consumed with it when she first gets her job
towards the beginning, the more sex she has and drugs she takes, the less
interested in it she becomes, and it's obvious that a balancing act between
the two will not be had.</P>
<P>Every now and then we see her aforementioned sister, Katherine, who is
always at the opposite end of the poles than Theresa.  In the beginning,
she's partaking in drugs and group sex while Theresa keeps to her school
studies, but by the end, Katherine has cleaned herself up and started anew,
while Theresa has redefined herself as a druggie and sex addict.</P>
<P>The ending is, yes, a shock, but it's also cheap and ends only so that the
message of the film can be completed.  Though I must say that it is a much
imitated scene, having been stolen by films like "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk
With Me" and "The Doom Generation," though neither are as good as this is.</P>
<P>Still, "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" leaves the viewer wanted a little bit
more, perhaps because it promises to have more depth on the topics of
promiscuity and leading a double life.  Instead it come off all too
fable-like, and often intends to shock us more than it intends to say
something very meaningful.  But with a great performance from Diane Keaton
(who acts very human...and bares a lot more of herself than she normally
has, and she was even in the original cast of "Hair"), this film comes off
as one of those deeply flawed classics that you don't necessarily enjoy or
even like, but you never forget.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
