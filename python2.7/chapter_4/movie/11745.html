 Cast: Robert Carlyle, Juliet Aubrey</P>
<P>   The British have a way with working class comedies, with
Pater Cattaneo's "The Full Monty" getting the big Oscar
nomination along with movies far more titanic.  With "Go
Now," Michael Winterbottom--whose "Welcome to Sarajevo"
was one of last year's trenchant dramas of the tragedies of
war--displays his skill at evoking humor out of the most
wrenching circumstances.  "Go Now," named for one of the
songs on its notable soundtrack, deals with the dread disease
of multiple sclerosis but does not succumb to the banal
disease-of-the-week format.  Nor does it separate its
humorous sections from its tragic aspects.  Based on scripter
Paul Henry Powell's actual experience with the malady, "Go
Now" certainly has its somber moments, but humor informs
even the most melancholy viewpoints so effectively and in
such good taste that the movie does not dampen audience
mood nor does it mock the obviously serious implications of
the condition.  Anyone in the audience who has ever had his
or her happy life muffled by the sudden onslaught of
debilitating illness will relate strongly to this slice of an
athlete's vicissitudes.</P>
<P>   This is not to say that Mr. Winterbottom's vision is fully
realized.  The film's repetitiveness is distracting, particularly in
exhibiting a soccer coach's diatribes to a frequently inept
team and one character's insistence on feeding the same,
self-defeating line to women he is trying to bed.  For those in
the audience not born into the working classes of Britain's
hinterlands, subtitles would have been welcome.</P>
<P>   "Go Now" spends considerable time developing the milieu
of working-class society in Bristol, England, focusing on the
Scottish-born Nick Cameron (Robert Carlyle) and his
relationship with his peers on the soccer field and with a
woman, Karen Walker (Juliet Aubrey) whom he has begun
dating and who has moved in with him.  He has a satisfying
life as a plasterer during the week, kicking a football in
weekend competitions and taking the jibes of his teammates,
particularly those of his best pal Tony (James Nesbitt).  When
he begins seeing double and has trouble holding on to the
tools of his trade because of increasing numbness, he visits a
doctor and is given glasses.  Behind the scenes, however, the
physician tells his girl friend that Nick may have MS which, we
learn, sometimes spreads almost imperceptibly, sometimes
with paralyzing rapidity.  Unfortunately for Nick, his case
progresses rapidly so that toward the movie's conclusion, he
is using two canes to walk and can no longer work with his
hands.</P>
<P>   Though Karen is supportive, Nick predictably is irritated
from his infirmity and takes his problems out on her, insisting
that she leave him and find a better life elsewhere.  Though
Karen is pushed temporarily into the arms of her boss, she is
too much in love with Nick ultimately to betray him.</P>
<P>   As with his "Welcome to Sarajevo," Winterbottom does best
when he satirizes institutions of society.  Here, the director
takes pot shots at Britain's socialized medicine to great effect. 
The first doctor Nick sees refuses to tell him the dread
diagnosis, and as a result Nick gets into a minor accident with
his car and delays further treatment unnecessarily.  Worse,
one of the doctors eats a sandwich while speaking with him of
the illness, tells him his records got lost, and orders him not to
report back for further testing for four weeks.</P>
<P>   The sexual activity between Nick and Karen is as graphic
as it is great to see, giving new resonance to the term
"working stiff."  The director also includes several panoramas
of the winter bottoms of the men taking their hot showers.</P>
<P>   The chemistry between Carlyle and Aubrey is palpable,
Juliet Aubrey demonstrating the necessary working-class
roughness while Carlyle persuasively defines Nick's increasing
vulnerability.  The bonhomie of Nick's circle is also portrayed
well, his teammates shifting between continuing to treat Nick
as one of the guys and showing pity for the young man. 
Neither as wrenching as Winterbottom's "Jude the Obscure"
nor as realistic as his more recent "Welcome to Sarajevo,"
"Go Now" makes for involving theater with its dramatic
portrayal of some of Britain's little people,  Not Rated. 
Running Time: 88 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey
