<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A taut little suspense programmer. One that is very watchable, though
the twist in the plot is hardly believable. Tony Riccardi (Sydney
Tafler) is a professional killer, but his family thinks that he earns
his money as a rare stamp dealer. He is a loving husband to his wife
Maria (Blake), and an overbearing but generous older brother to Guiseppi
(John Hewer). Guiseppi lives with Tony and has paid for his expensive
violin and for his lessons, and supports him so he doesn't have to work
but can just devote his time to studying the violin. Tony promised his
mother when she died that he would look after his brother and make sure
that he became a concert violinist. All the bickering between the
brothers is over Tony trying to lead his brother's life for him. Tony's
girlfriend Helen is disappointed that he doesn't rebel against his
brother.</P>
<P>Inspector Carson of Scotland Yard (Howard) suspects Tony of a long list
of assassinations, but can't prove it. Tony always has the same alibi,
he's playing cards over at Charlie's bar.
Carson is resolved to get him, and states his philosophy regarding
criminals, is that anything is fair in trapping them.</P>
<P>The inspector gets his chance to follow his philosophy when a Mr.Tyler
is murdered outside a cafe wearing a camel's hair overcoat. He has the
bullet in him from the same gun used in the other assassinations, which
leads the inspector to believe that it is Tony who did the hit. As a
coincidence, Guiseppi is in the cafe wearing the same kind of coat and
is drunk because he is upset that his brother has arranged for a concert
in a prominent recital hall even though he is not ready to perform at
that level.</P>
<P>Foolishly risking his job, the inspector tells Tony that his brother was
shot in front of the cafe. He gambles that Tony will become so
distraught, that he will confess to the killing.</P>
<P>It's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily, but
he does... What this potboiler had going for it, was a nice look to its
B&W shots of the dark streets of London, and through Sydney Tafler's
melodramatic performance, it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded
taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and, though his
love for his brother was genuine, it was still misguided. Overall, the
"B" film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable
story to tell.</P>
