<PRE>                           THE LITTLE MERMAID
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Although the Disney conglomerate may be known more today for its
theme parks, the heart of the organization, even if no longer the
largest revenue generator, is the production of animated motion
pictures.  Once a year, Disney delights young and old alike with some
colorful fantasy.  And periodically, Disney spruces up one of its old
films, and rereleases the fresh print to the theaters.</P>
<P>     For those of us who missed seeing, or weren't even alive, when THE
LITTLE MERMAID was first released in 1989, Disney plans on giving us a
special opportunity to see it during a short theatrical run in the last
part of November.  Yes, the film is already available on video, but
nothing compares with the experience of seeing the lush visuals on the
big screen and hearing the wonderfully happy songs in a real theater.
Even if you've seen it before, it's well worth enjoying again.</P>
<P>     In Disney's recent films, comedic antics (ALADDIN), striking
images (THE LION KING), and serious messages (THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE
DAME) have dominated.  In contrast, THE LITTLE MERMAID harks back to a
simpler time when Disney made many films and cartoons in which the
story took a backseat to the music.  Although THE LITTLE MERMAID
explores many traditional themes, such as selling your soul to the
devil, it never takes itself too seriously, contenting itself with
being a feel-good musical.</P>
<P>     Musicals are only as good as the songs and the singers, and,
thanks to the Academy Award winning songs by Alan Menken and the film's
talented cast, THE LITTLE MERMAID never disappoints.  If you don't
leave the theater humming, then you'd better check the adjustment on
your hearing aid.  The film is so infectiously happy that the only
possible criticism could come from some Scrooge who found the music too
saccharine.</P>
<P>     The sweet teenage mermaid named Ariel, done with the lovely voice
of Jodi Benson, lives in the sea.  As in all Disney films, she has some
wisecracking friends, with the funniest being her guardian, a little
red crab named Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright).  Full of advice, he keeps
the show from ever dragging.  "Teenagers," he complains. "They think
they know everything.  You give them an inch; they swim all over you."
Sebastian and Ariel share most of the singing duties although just
about everyone seems to get a chance to sing a little.  Benson's voice
is like honey, and Wright's has the richness of a Caribbean lilt.</P>
<P>     Ariel's father, Triton (Kenneth Mars), like most fathers, tries to
protect his daughter against the dangers of the outside world.  In
their case, this means the land-based world populated by monsters known
as humans.  "Will you get your head out of the clouds and in the water
where it belongs," admonishes Sebastian, Triton's right-hand
crustacean.</P>
<P>     Ariel's difficulties begin when she rescues her prince
(Christopher Daniel Barnes) from a sinking ship.  Going topside is
strictly forbidden for all merfolk so she gets in trouble when her
father finds out.  As always, Sebastian steps in with his judgment,
saying that "somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor."</P>
<P>     All of this causes her to sell her soul and her voice to a fishy
devil, played by a large blue squid named Ursula (Pat Carroll).  Ursula
gives a mute Ariel three days on land to win a kiss from her Prince, or
Ariel will live forever in a hellish, briny deep.</P>
<P>     As the story transpires, we are treated to a long series of songs
including "Kiss the Girl" and "Under the Sea."  As our toes are tapping
-- careful not to make noise and disturb your fellow moviegoers -- the
animators dazzle us with their choice of colors.  Down below, the
palette is rich with the aquamarine colors of blues and greens with
Ariel's orangish red hair providing the perfect contrast.  The land is
differentiated by earth tones of peaches, browns, and golds.  And the
net result is a feast for the eyes and ears.</P>
<P>     THE LITTLE MERMAID runs just 1:22.  It is rated G with only
Ursula's sneer being anything that might trouble the youngest viewers.
My son Jeffrey's friend Kerry, both of them 8, said that she thought
the film was "great."  Jeffrey agreed and went on to mention "Under the
Sea" as his favorite song from the show.</P>
