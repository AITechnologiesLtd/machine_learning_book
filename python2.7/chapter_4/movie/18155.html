<PRE>FORTRESS (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In the mid-1980s, following the splendid debut in Hugh
Hudson's GREYSTOKE and relative success of first HIGHLANDER
film, it looked like Christopher Lambert's acting career
might go somewhere. But, it wasn't meant to be, which became
obvious following HIGHLANDER II. In this decade Christopher
Lambert became associated with films with low budgets and
even lower quality. Very often such films were science
fiction, which meant that the fans of that genre learned the
hard way what to evade anything starring Christopher
Lambert. Whether it was because of real lack of talent,
terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the
end result was almost always horrible. The same can be said
for FORTRESS, 1993 science fiction film directed by Stuart
Gordon, director who created cult following with his 1980s
horror gorefests like REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND.</P>
<P>The movie is set in 2018. For some undisclosed reason, USA
introduced strict population control and couples are barred
from having more than one child. Jake (Christopher Lambert)
and Karen Brennick (Lori Laughlin) broke that law and are
caught by authorities on the border. Sentenced to 31 years
in prison, they are both thrown into Fortress, privately
owned correctional facility, equiped with state-of-the-art
futuristic technology and run by computer called Zed.
Although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of
inmates' lives and make any escape impossible, prison
authorities often use violence. Jake survives many ordeals
and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when
he begins planing the escape. Such escape should become
necessity, because the warden Poe (Kurtwood Smith) begins
showing unhealthy interest in Karen.</P>
<P>After rather intriguing beginning and some interesting
special effects that depict the futuristic settings of
prison, this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity. The
reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into
whole series of prison movie clichés and situations that are
painfully predictable. By the time Brennick begins his
escape from Fortress, those situations not only begin to
look predictable, but utterly implausible too. Of course,
film never tried to explain why the country that lacks
resources to support its present population happens to spend
bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with
sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous
members of the society. The initially interesting plot is
done even more wrong by stereotyped characters, played by
not too interested or talented actors. Lori Laughlin,
although physically attractive, shows the acting ability of
sequoia. Kurtwood Smith as prison warden is rather
uninspired, capable of solid, yet forgettable performance.
Lambert's performance is also good, but even the bigger
talent couldn't help this film, destined to end in oblivion.</P>
