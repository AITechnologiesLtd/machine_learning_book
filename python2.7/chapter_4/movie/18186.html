<PRE>ENTANGLED (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the
videoshelves in the early 1990s came this French-Canadian
co-production by Max Fischer. The movie is set in Paris
where its hero, struggling American author David Mirkine
(Judd Nelson, at the time specialised in playing losers and
people at the edge of sanity) suffers a terrible writers
bloc. He manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic
relationship with beautiful model Anabelle (Laurence
Treill). Unfortunately, she hangs out in jet set circles,
which gradually makes Mirkine pathologically jealous. Her
connection with powerful David Caravan (Pierce Brosnan)
would make Mirkine step the line between reason and sanity
and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events.</P>
<P>Although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the
plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller, drama
would probably be more appropriate genre label. Pacing of
the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers, and those
patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a
long time between any interesting or significant
developments. Low budget also becomes painfully visible, and
physical attributes of Laurence Treill are the only thing
worth watching in this film. Unfortunately, this film has
too little of those supposedly erotic scenes, so those who
wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel
disappointed. Instead, they would have to settle with
pointless, slow scenes involving Nelson, Brosnan and
Laurence Treill's attempts of serious acting. All of those
definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's
precious time.</P>
