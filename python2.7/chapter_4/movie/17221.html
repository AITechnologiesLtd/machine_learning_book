<PRE>GODS AND MONSTERS (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Bill Condon
Writer: Bill Condon (based on the novel "Father of Frankenstein" by
Christopher Bram)
Starring: Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita
Davidovich, David Dukes, Kevin J. O'Connor, Mark Kiely, Jack Plotnick,
Rosalind Ayres, Jack Betts</P>
<P>Like "Deep Impact" and "Armageddon," "Antz" and "A Bug's Life," and
"Deep Rising" and "Virus," "Love and Death on Long Island" and "Gods and
Monsters" feel eerily like the exact same movie, released (or supposed
to be released) within months of eachother for extra effect.  The
former's a wonderfully droll piece of cinema, and a witty rethinking of
"Death in Venice"; the latter's a much-similar, much more serious
rethinking of the final days in the life of famous Hollywood director
James Whale (of the first two Frankenstein pics fame) that only borrows
from some of the elements of the former's source material (i.e. the
protagonist dies).  Both deal with an older man's love for a younger
man, but the former only dealt with it in terms of non-sexual love and
came off with clever bits of irony and whatnot (whatever it was, it was
damned entertaining), the latter has the protagonist being notoriously
gay, and his love for the younger man being that of the physical kind
only blossoming into the emotional kind.  Both films are still rather
similar, with the only other major difference being that it's the older
man as the celebrity this time, and, of course, that this one's far less
interesting nor successful as the other one.</P>
<P>I can only attribute this not to the film's lack of ambiguity in its
subject (though, for the record, the older man's love is still rather
ambiguous), but to other elements that seem to distract and hurt the
otherwise very good film that is "Gods and Monsters."  Most of the film
is a series of chats between Whale (played magnificently by Ian
McKellen) and his gardner/object of obsession, Clay Boone (Brendan
Fraser), where they exchange stories and respective thoughts, and all
this is incredibly interesting for being not much than long talky
scenes.  McKellen, white-haired and polished, and Boone, blockheaded but
surprisingly intelligent and understanding, share a very complex
relationship that is the heart and major strength of the film.  Starting
off as a mere obsession with Whale's perception of physical beauty (in a
way, Boone resembles the monster in his movies), we see their
relationship turn from physical love on the part of Boone to joint
respect from eachother and then to self-centered mooching, and it's all
done with a gentle screenwriting touch by the director himself, Bill
Condon.</P>
<P>It's most of everything else in the film that doesn't work as well as
the main section, ranging from partially sucessful to downright sloppy.
For example, much is made of Whale's bitterness over his failing health,
and the fact that his mind is slowly going, so every now and then, we
get flashbacks to memories, most of them traumatic, so we see that we
see that he cherishes what he will soon no longer have.  But these only
pop up sporadically, albeit nicely when they do, while we are also
subjected to melodramatic scenes where Whale is physically crippled by
his past or driven to unbridled anger at who he's talking to.  In a
silly scene towards the beginning, Whale is giving an interview to an
effeminate collegiate reporter wherein every question Whale answers
results in the removal of one article of the reporter's clothing when he
suddenly suffers a minor stroke.  Later on, he screams at Boone for
allowing him to uncover the wounds of the past.  Both scenes would
otherwise be fine, but they're handled in such an overly-dramatic tone
that they're downright silly and distracting from the overall quaintness
of the film.  Nothing's as silly, though, as the sloppy depth the film
tries for in terms of the Frankenstein-esque relationship between the
main characters, Whale being the doctor, Boone being the monster, and
Whale's german housemaid (Lynn Redgrave) being, oh, Igor.  And
gotinheimel, did it actually have to recreate a scene straight from
"Sunset Boulevard" and then culminate it with a maudlin final reel that
only makes the film's finale (Whale's suicide, also eerily from "Sunset
Boulevard") seem contrived when, of course, it damn well shouldn't.</P>
<P>When it's dealing with the Whale/Boone relationship, it's wonderfully
subtle and refreshingly interesting.  When it ventures away from it,
it's either too silly (the interview scene, for one) or too
over-the-top, particuarly when it comes to Boone's outside life, which
is so sloppily-conceived that it either had to be longer or cut out
completely (the final scene, in particular, reduces it to merely being
about how an everyday schmuck knew a famous member of Hollywood once
upon a time).  I wanted to see more about Whale, though, and maybe even
more about Boone, though the Whale bits interested so much more that
anytime it cut to Boone's outside life, I was merely waiting for them to
cut to Whale.  It'd be nice to see more of his past life, more
flashbacks, some more detail (his flashback to making "Bride of
Frankenstein" is wonderful, to say the least), though at least it gave
some more insight into watching his films (I'll probably never be able
to watch "Bride of..." again without thinking of it as a film about a
bunch of queens, or so they say).  But as such, none of it is as
well-documented as the scenes between the two of them - they don't seem
fake and contrived like other parts of the film, and if it had been more
about the two of them as a unit, and how they were able to find
something more to life by knowing eachother, I'd say it was one of the
best films of the year hands-down.</P>
<P>This is mostly due to great performances, though, by McKellen and
Fraser.  I, at least, have no doubt in the pure competence of McKellen -
he's one of the best actors working today (for more mainstream
audiences, he was the only truly good thing about "Apt Pupil," and
otherwise shoddy affair), and what's great about this performance is
that it's not merely a typical posh homosexual role, but that it's a
nuanced, sad, and deft performance - he makes Whale effortlessly
complex, so that we don't immediately notice what he's brought to his
role (in fact, along with Nolte and Hanks, I'd say that if the Academy
knows anything, they'll pick one of these three as the winner - all
three gave such subtle performances that you hardly knew they were
acting).  Fraser, shockingly enough, is excellent as well.  He makes
Boone a surprise - a pretty much intelligent working man who doesn't
succumb to cliches, and only seems minorly disturbed when he discovers,
halfway through the film, that the man he's been hanging around with is
gay.  I also liked how he killed off any suspicion about a potential
tryst between the two men - any such idea would be distracting to their
overall relationship (though, towards the end, the homoeroticism does
nearly reach the surface, and mistakingly so).</P>
<P>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that they had been given a better
script, one that was longer and dealt more with their outside
relationships, making their moments together even more poignant and even
more interesting.  As such, it feels just like the kind of film that is
overpraised while another one is dramatically underpraised.  This one
did have a better performance from the lead actor (though, for the
record, John Hurt is pretty damned close in his dramatic power to
McKellen), but the other one was far more subtler, and deepened the
relationship in an almost effortless fashion, all while retaining a
droll tone that was one of the film's biggest successes (best of all, it
never for a second felt smug and/or cheap).  The tone Condon has adapted
for this film is far more maudlin and even occasionally schizophrenic -
over-the-top funny, then subtly droll, then over-the-top dramatic - he
even tosses in a line from Whale about how the monsters are, *gasp*,
inside him - gimme a break (and what of Mr. Condon's direction?  Well,
it's mostly competent, but nothing too remarkable: a series of
alternating shots, occasionally laced with a distracting DePalma-esque
wide shot of a close-up/things in the distance, showing off the coveted
depth-of-field technique).  And throughout, I just kept on waiting for
the two actors to get together again and share a conversation once
again.  Pity some actors are forced to give great performances in films
that are only half-way wonderful.</P>
