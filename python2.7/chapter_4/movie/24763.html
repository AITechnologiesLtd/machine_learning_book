<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"From Here to Eternity" (1953) ***1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Fred Zinneman 
Written by Daniel Taradash </PRE>
<P>Starring Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Frank
Sinatra, Donna Reed, Deborah Kerr, Philip Ober,
and Ernest Borgnine </P>
<P>"We may seem all alike. We ain't all alike." Private
Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) tells his
newly found lover in the middle of a crowded Hawaiian
bar. Prewitt is representing men in society - how they
ostensibly are exactly the same, but in actuality are
as individual as can be.  The 1953 classic From Here
to Eternity dedicates its entire running time to
proving this quote, and with all of the interesting
male characters it introduces - it succeeds. From the
loner, to the alcoholic, to the adulterer, to the
torturer, to the gentleman, the only thing that links
these unique individuals is the military suit they
wear to work everyday. Living in the same vicinity
just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the
cooperation of these men seems infinitely more
difficult to them than fighting in the war. </P>
<P>Between these five central characters preparing for a
world war, a powerful emotional war takes place. And
when the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor
occurs starting World War II in America, it provides a
thunderous conclusion to this war. The film opens with
the arrival of the sensitive Prewitt, a former
professional bugle player and boxer for the army who
inexplicably wants to become a private. This is all
sounds perfect to Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober), a
man eager to become a major and finds the only way to
move up a rank is to have a winning boxing team. But
Prewitt has quit boxing and says there is nothing in
the world that will convince him to do so again. This
angers Holmes who has his officers, including Sergeant
Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster), train Prewitt
especially hard until he finally changes his mind. The
only soldier who supports Prewitt is Angelo Maggio
(Frank Sinatra), a man who knows all the hot spots in
town and regularly gets drunk for entertainment. So
drunk at times that it gets him an enemy named
Sergeant "Fatso" Judson (Ernest Borgnine) who swears
he will get Maggio one day. Meanwhile Sergeant Warden
is having an illicit affair with his Captain's
depressed and lonely wife (Deborah Kerr). </P>
<P>Did that just sound like an example of your everyday
soap opera? Yes, there are a lot of characters in From
Here to Eternity (in fact I left out Lorene (Donna
Reed), a woman Prewitt meets and falls in love with at
one of the clubs he stops by at). Do not be mistaken,
this movie is a soap opera, several things are
happening at the same time - but unlike something on
CBS at 2 P.M., the acting and directing in this movie
is amazing. Also despite the large cast, impressively
there isn't one confusing moment and the script, based
on the controversial novel by James Jones, ingeniously
connects everyone with everyone. By the end, there
will be a large collision.  </P>
<P>The mistake the film makes is that the female
characters stand in the way. The relationships between
Prewitt and Lorene, and Warden and the Captain's wife
Karen, are both unconvincing due to expedient set ups
by director Fred Zinneman. Just when you start to
believe that these people actually are beginning to
love each other, the movie is already ten steps ahead,
raising the possibility of marriage. Both love affairs
are so melodramatic and predictable that they hold
back the entire movie. </P>
<P>Winner of 8 Academy Awards in 1953 including Best
Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Donna Reed), and
Best Supporting Actor (Frank Sinatra), I was somewhat
shocked that Reed won. She just didn't amaze me as
much as other winners of the prestigious award (at
least she was better than Beatrice Straight in
Network). Sinatra, on the other hand, really surprised
me as Angelo Maggio. Simultaneously hilarious and
depressing, he single-handedly shifted this film's
status from good to classic. </P>
<P>Zinneman, to show his range, directed this movie just
before Oklahoma! and just after High Noon. He
skillfully hints at the upcoming Pearl Harbor attack
with newspaper articles, dates, and images scattered
everywhere that tease the audience and build up
suspense for the unavoidable incident. And when the
moment finally comes, the execution is satisfyingly
accurate.  You can tell this was a surprise attack by
men running back and forth for cover with just towels
on. </P>
<P>>From Here to Eternity revolves around a war yet to
happen. It looks at American society right before the
country's entry in the war; a quiet period compared to
the disorder that soon follows. But the beauty of the
film is that it is far from quiet. The emotional
dilemmas that these characters face is as powerful and
realistic as any battle sequence in a World War II
film such as Saving Private Ryan.</P>
