                                 (ANGLAGAARD)
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>In Swedish, with English subtitles
Starring:  Helena Bergstrom, Rikard Wolff, Sven Wolter.
Screenplay/Director:  Colin Nutley.</P>
<P>     When I think of Swedish films, comedy does not exactly spring to
mind.  The central figure is of course Ingmar Bergman, whose imagistic
and introspective works have given me a somewhat grim picture of
Swedish cinema, and of Sweden in general.  Now it appears that I must
change my perception.  The impetus for that change is HOUSE OF ANGELS,
a bright and lively comedy that takes on moral hypocrisy and
provincialism with delightful results.</P>
<P>     HOUSE OF ANGELS is set in a small Swedish farming village where
Erik Zander (Per Oscarsson), a reclusive landowner, has just passed
away.  Among the many citizens less than devastated by his passing is
Axel Flogfalt (Sven Wolter), a wealthy mill owner who covets the timber
on Erik's land.  He believes Erik has died without an heir, and that he
will be able to obtain the land when it goes up for public auction.
Enter Fanny (Helena Bergstrom), who arrives on a motorcycle with
leather-clad companion Zac (Rikard Wolff) and shocks the community by
announcing that she's Erik's granddaughter.  Fanny and Zac, flamboyant
Berlin cabaret performers, then take up residence on the Zander farm,
Anglagaard, much to the consternation of the town's stuffy populace.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Colin Nutley does a fantastic job of establishing
the hidden peccadillos of the town's citizens.  Before Erik's death, a
ghoulish Axel tells his son that he looks forward to the benefit he
stands to gain from the event.  Axel's nephew Per-Ove, who runs the
town grocery store, sits in the back room watching American porno films
between customers; his stock girl Eva is carrying on a roadside affair
with Axel's rakish son Morten.  The framework of these little sins
makes their response to Fanny's open sexuality and exuberance all the
more laughable.  Axel's uptight wife Ruth assumes that Zac must be a
drug user because of his appearance, and that the interlopers from the
big city will ruin their wholesome community.  Nutley crafts a tale
about a particular intolerance which transcends the particular and
addresses the universal foolishness of such narrow-mindedness.</P>
<P>     The film is at its best when it deals with the direct interactions
between Fanny and the town's citizens.  She slowly begins to win over
the more even-tempered folk, including the young priest Father Henning
and two shy elderly brothers.  The latter in particular is a hilarious
scene, as Fanny and Zac try to explain to the two perplexed men the
exact nature of their sometimes bawdy performances.  There is also an
intense but comic confrontation between Fanny and Ruth, where the
threatened matron ticks off the terrible vices Fanny will perpetrate on
the small town ("I've seen it all on TV!" she cries).  HOUSE OF ANGELS
is full of such scenes, and most of them sparkle.  Make special note of
the wonderful montage following Fanny's decision to give the town
gossips something *really* worth gossipping about.</P>
<P>     HOUSE OF ANGELS certainly isn't a perfect film.  Bergstrom is
lovely as Fanny, but she's not quite as fully developed a character as
she could be, especially concerning why she's so eager to stay at
Anglagaard.  The film also suffers from some choppy editing in the
final half hour, and singularly unimpressive translations in some of
the subtitles.  However, none of this should keep you away from HOUSE
OF ANGELS.  The photography of the Swedish countryside is beautiful,
and the interiors are almost as impressive.  It's also a film with a
fantastic ensemble cast; there truly is not a bad performance to be
found.  The most memorable for me:  Reine Brynolfsson as the
introverted Gottfrid, whom Fanny draws out of his shell into a warm
friendship.</P>
<P>     HOUSE OF ANGELS was an Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign
Language Film last year, and it appears to have been a richly deserved
honor.  It's reminiscent of Bill Forsyth's LOCAL HERO, with a slight
moralist twist.  It could take some searching to find it near you, but
it will be well worth the effort.</P>
<P>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 rounds of "Auld Lang Syne" (you'll
have to see it to understand):  9.</P>
