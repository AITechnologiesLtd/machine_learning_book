<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</P>
<P>Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) and Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) are two
manipulating upper class Manhattan teenagers, who agree to partake in a
wager of sexual contest.  Kathryn challenges Sebastian - who is known
for his sexual sleaziness - to seduce a pristine student named Annette
(Reese Witherspoon), who is incidentally a headmaster's daughter.  If
Sebastian loses, he has to hand over his 1956 Jaguar to Kathryn.  If he
wins, he gets to do Kathryn in the position of his choice.  But
Sebastian begins to fall in love with the gentle spirited Annette,
whilst Kathryn immerses herself in cocaine and meaningless
relationships.</P>
<P>Cruel Intentions has so many plot twists and turns that it is easy to
feel as manipulated as the film's characters, but for few of the right
reasons.  Although this film has a distinctly 90's touch - with
homosexuals, lesbian references, drug use, you name it - it rarely feels
fresh or original.  The central romance between Sebastian and Annette is
uninspired, with not even one scene portraying their emotions in an
insightful or mature manner.</P>
<P>The script has its ups and downs; the film's first half is considerably
better than its second, or at least a little more intriguing.  The
acting here does not contribute much to the production.  Sarah Michelle
Gellar quickly becomes little more than a passing joke - whilst there is
nothing particularly wrong with her performance, her dialogue is
ridiculously egotistical and cold.  Reese Witherspoon, however, gives a
sensuous and exciting presence.</P>
<P>Cruel Intentions is directed and edited with precision, and shifts
through its various subplots seamlessly.  The filmmakers have produced a
sharp and shifty piece, but one that fails to entice audiences or bring
them into the picture.  It has a lot of bickering, biting and
slandering, but little intrigue.   Furthermore, squeezing in a happy
ending is not just a bad choice - given the subject matter, it's also
painfully ironic.</P>
