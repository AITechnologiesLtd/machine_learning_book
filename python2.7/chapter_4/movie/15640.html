<P>I have probably seen John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, "Halloween," 
more times than any other film (the first time being when I was all of 
4-years-old), and it will always be the best horror film ever made, in 
my eyes. None of its six sequels (and counting) have been able to even 
remotely capture the style and brilliance of the original. I simply 
cannot imagine a genre picture being better than this one. </P>
<P>"Halloween," starts off with a prologue set in 1963, all done in an 
elaborate, one-take POV shot, in which 6-year-old Michael Myers grabs a 
butcher knife, makes his way upstairs, slips on a clown mask, and goes 
into his teenage sister's room and stabs her to death.</P>
<P>Switch to October 30th, 1978, Myers, now an adult, escapes from a mental 
hospital, returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, and on Halloween 
night, goes on a murder spree, singling out three friends, Laurie (Jamie 
Lee Curtis), Annie (Nancy Loomis), and Linda (P.J Soles), two of which 
are babysitting. Meanwhile, Michael Myers' psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis 
(Donald Pleasence), knows he will strike again, and goes searching for 
him.</P>
<P>John Carpenter's "Halloween," is the quintessential horror film, 
perfectly executed, atmospheric, suspenseful, and terrifying. Yes, it is 
a "slasher" movie, but I'd like to think that it is so good that it 
surpasses that dubious label. </P>
<P>There are many reasons why "Halloween," was and still is an effective 
film. One of the big reasons is Carpenter's clever use of the 
foregrounds and backgrounds of all of his shots. If you look really good 
at the backgrounds of all of the scenes, you will often see something 
lurking around, including Michael Myers himself. Many pictures have 
copied this approach, but none have been able to do it so successfully.</P>
<P>Another reason it is so enthralling is that the story is very, very 
simple, and is actually a sort of "slice-of-life" movie, when dealing 
with the teenage girls. There are no "big" scenes between them. Instead, 
it just sort of observes them in their normal life. It just happens to 
be while they are being stalked by a serial killer. In recent horror 
movies, there is always a mystery to who the killer is, and this 
90's-style approach is getting old fast, even though I am a big fan of 
"Scream," "I Know What You Did Last Summer," and "Urban Legend."</P>
<P>"Halloween" also has the most memorable music score I've ever listened 
to. Like 1960's "Psycho," the score, when heard, is always paired with 
this movie, and even those people who have never seen it probably can 
hum it. It's sort of like in, "Psycho." Many people remember the shower 
scene, even if they've never actually seen the movie.</P>
<P>Despite being a slasher film, "Halloween" surprisingly has next to no 
gore or on-screen violence. Because of this, it proves that horror 
pictures do not need to have graphic violence to be a scary experience 
(something 1981's highly inferior, "Halloween II," should have 
realized). </P>
<P>As most people know, this is the film that made Jamie Lee Curtis a star, 
not to mention being labeled a "Scream Queen," and this is actually one 
of her best performances, even though it was her feature debut. Donald 
Pleasence, who died in 1995 after making, "Halloween: The Curse of 
Michael Myers," also was linked to his role as Dr. Loomis more than any 
other in his life. P.J. Soles, as the promiscuous, big-mouthed Linda, is 
often very funny, and a standout. And Michael Myers...well...no slasher 
villain will ever be able to compare to him. </P>
<P>John Carpenter's "Halloween," is a nearly flawless thriller, but it is 
also simply a great motion picture. Period. It is everything a film in 
this genre should be: intelligent, stylish, and horrifying. "Halloween," 
is a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable experience. Watch it in a pitch black 
room while you're home alone one night, preferably on the namesake 
holiday. I dare you.</P>
