<PRE>                                 TOMMY BOY
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     After graduating from seven years of college with a D+ average,
Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) finds himself back in his hometown of
Sandusky, Ohio where a top job in his father's factory awaits him.
When Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) is struck by a fatal heart attack, the
family business falls in danger of being bought out by a rival.  It is
up to Tommy and Richard Hayden (David Spade), an uptight but efficient
company man, to keep Callahan Auto Parts from being cannibalized and
sending Tommy and the town of Sandusky to ruin.</P>
<P>     It has been a long time since "Saturday Night Live" produced a
big-screen star in the likes of a Bill Murray or Eddie Murphy.  Michael
Myers and Dana Carvey found success in the WAYNE'S WORLD series but
have never had a hit otherwise.  Chris Farley, however, may be a
different story.</P>
<P>     Large and likable, Farley has what it takes to carry a movie.
Whether he is struggling to change his clothes in an airplane lavatory
or demonstrating the advantages of auto parts by lighting model cars
on fire, his Tommy Boy is always fun to watch.  Add Farley's gift for
humor with his big-hearted sincerity and you have a comedian that
audiences will want to see more of.</P>
<P>     Spade is the opposite of Farley, deadpan and tiny, but he is
equally entertaining.  The two make an excellent team and if they can
find themselves a more substantial vehicle than this, a great comedy
might be born.</P>
<P>     Director Peter Segal (NAKED GUN 33-1/3) keeps the pace moving and
elevates the thin script by Fred Wolf and Bonnie and Terry Turner.  To
their credit, the filmmakers give Farley and Spade enough scenes to
allow them to shine but they waste time on unnecessary sub-plots
including one with Bo Derek and Rob Lowe as they try to steal away the
factory.</P>
<P>     TOMMY BOY is a mediocre movie but offers some good laughs because
of the talents of Farley and Spade.</P>
