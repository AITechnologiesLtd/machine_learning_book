<P>   If you have a way with words and you want to create a
book, a theater piece or a screenplay, you know the usual
advice.  Write what you know.  A great deal of the literature
and films we see are born from the real-life experiences of
their creators.  Even a sci-fi film like Michael
Anderson's"Logan's Run"--which deals with how each
citizen's life of unending pleasure in the twenty-third century
must end at age 30 with extinction--could have been inspired
by the scripter's difficulties finding a job once he had become
"overqualified" because of age.</P>
<P>   Most moviegoers are probably uninterested in how the 
lives of the screenwriters and directors influence their plots. 
That's for critics to debate.  But in the visually elegant
romantic comedy, "Shakespeare in Love," director John
Madden uses Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's screenplay
to involve us in the life of William Shakespeare, posing the
question, "How much of the Bard's own life is reflected in his
works?"  If you're a reasonably serious student of the great
Renaissance writer, you know that he depended less on his
own nature than on sources well-known to all from years and
centuries past.  In the greatest love story of them all,
Shakespeare lifted the theme from Arthur Brooke's poetic
"The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet," written thirty-
three years before the first production of "Romeo and Juliet." 
Does this mean that there's nothing in the play that came out
of the writer's own life?  Not at all.  According to the director
Madden's fanciful film, Shakepeare may have been quite
familiar with the Brooke text.  After all, he was trying
desperately to get some pages out of a new work called
"Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."  But he was
blocked.  He needed inspiration, and that encouragement
would come from a brief affair he would soon fall into.</P>
<P>   Now "Romeo and Juliet," first presented to an Elizabethan
audience in 1595, is a gender-bender which includes some
comedy (such as the scene in the fourth act dominated by
ribald musicians), a considerable allotment of tragedy, and a
very great deal of romance.  "Shakespeare in Love" similarly
reflects these genres but is dominated by comedy.  The title
character, played by Joseph Fiennes, proves that writer's
block is not a scourge of our own century alone.  He is
working on "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," but
nothing in his own life can inspire him to dash off even a
single page of poetry.  His purely physical needs are met by
the promiscuous Rosaline (Sandra Reinton) but he needs
something transcendent if he is to draft the greatest love
story ever told.  Neither the pressure of theater owner Philip
Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) nor the insistence of financier
Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) can stir his creative juices. 
When he sets eyes on the lovely and cultivated Viola De
Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), he is hooked and, fortunately,
the feelings are mutual.  Viola, however, has been
commanded by Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) to marry the
insistent gold-digger Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and to follow
him to his plantation in Virginia.</P>
<P>   When Lady Viola--who aspires to be an actor at a time that
women were not allowed on the stage--auditions for the role
of Romeo disguised as a man, there follows a series of
mistaken identities, free-for-all brawls, swordfights, and best
of all some passionate embraces between Bard and bedmate
that mirror the very themes of the play.  The words now flow
liberally from Shakespeare's quill.  For dialogue, the author
makes canny use of the everyday expressions he picks up
while walking through London streets, such as one orator's
political diatribe "A plague on both your houses" and another
citizen's comment on a theater building, "A rose by any other
name..."  If you believe the particulars of this movie, you'll
even see how Will was able to follow up his great play about
love with a lighter-than-air fable,"Twelfth Night," finding a lead
role for the object of his own great passion, Viola.</P>
<P>   The idea behind the film is a clever one indeed, showing
how art follows life, and is in addition a paeon to the power of
the theater (and by extension the cinema) to teach us the
real meaning of love.  Clever that the movie may be, it does
not come up to the usual standards of its co-writer, Tom
Stoppard, who has imparted to us far wittier take-offs on
Shakespeare such as "Dogg's hamlet," on James Joyce in
"Travesties," and has inundated us with verbal wit and
intellectual games in such plays as "Hapgood" (on double
agents and nuclear physics) and "After Magritte" (about the
elements of a Magritte painting such as umbrellas and
bowlers).  Much of the comedy is obvious and flat, as in the
slapstick scene involving the comical torture of Philip
Henslowe by Hugh Fennyman and Restoration comedy-like
scenes involving the licentious Rosaline with Tiley (Simon
Callow), who tries to close the theater upon learning that a
woman is on the stage.  Nor is Joseph Fiennes a match for
the radiant and highly talented Gwyneth Paltrow.  Fiennes
has distinguished himself in the role of Dudley in the
generally convoluted film "Elizabeth" but in a part that
demands the corporeal countenance and impassioned
demeanor of a great lover, he comes across as both
physically and temperamentally thin.  Not so Dame Judi
Dench, who follows up her distinguished portrayal of Queen
Victoria in John Madden's "Mrs. Brown" with a vibrant
portrayal of the Virgin Queen in her current role.</P>
<P>   "Shakespeare in Love" boasts an abundant gallery of
British thesps, including Antony Sher, Rupert Everett and
Simon Callow and also popular American stars such as Ben
Affleck and, of course, the L.A.-born Gwyneth Paltrow.  It 
has a 1990's sensibility, encompassing a session which
Shakespeare has on the couch with verbal intimacies timed
by an hourglass. The picture is stunningly photographed on 
location in Britain to reflect a late 16th Century motif.</P>
