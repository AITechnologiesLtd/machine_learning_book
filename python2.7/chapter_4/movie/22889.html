<P>'Hard Eight' and 'Boogie Nights'.  1996 and 1997 were good years for
director Paul Thomas Anderson.  Two films that established him as a hard
boiled and progressive film maker.  His influential style, that of a young
Robert Altman, was breath taking to behold.  Particularly 'Boogie Nights'.
A film which spanned six years and gave us an evenly balanced look at
several characterizations and the film knew where its high points and low
points were.  The decibel level was right on the money.  My, how things
change.  'Magnolia' is an over stuffed stinker that reeks with pretentious
situations and over written scenes of ulcerating ugliness.  It does this
from its opening scene and tries to explain that co-incidence and
unlikeliness are the most bizarre facts of life</P>
<P>The most depressing film I've ever seen is 1998's 'Affliction'.  Superb
acting from all (including James Coburn's Oscar win for Best Supporting
Actor) but the film had a strange and curious path of familiarity for many
families and the picture concentrated itself on the actions of only a few
major characters.  I said in my review that while being truthful, that
didn't seem to matter much because the overall purpose of film is to
entertain and I questioned the entertainment value of such a film and a
similarly depressing film from 1998 entitled 'A Simple Plan' which suffered
from the same fate and while  recommending that film, I like it less and
less the more I think about it.  I had to debate for almost a week and
finally gave 'Affliction' a marginal recommendation for its stain of genuine
emotional truth.</P>
<P>'Magnolia' also makes the mistake of trying to bombard the screen with too
much over the top material that it loses track of its entertainment value.
The film is like being grabbed by an octopus and pulled in so many
directions that you're exhausted after finally escaping, the equivalent of
leaving the theatre for movie goers.  Leaving 'Magnolia' is indeed an escape
rather than a departure.  The film's glib symmetry will be mistaken by some
as high powered drama but it suffers from an ending which goes against the
first rule of screen writing.  I call it the 'red herring' factor.  A final
scene that is out of left field with no warning given to the audience and is
a ridiculous and cheap way to end all it thinks its accomplished.</P>
<P>The story is an ensemble piece that shows the lives of about a dozen
characters, some of whom aren't worth mentioning because their scenes are so
one dimensional.  Senior to the film is Jason Robards, a dying man named
Earl Partridge who is trying to contact his long lost son Frank (Tom Cruise)
who has changed his last name to Mackey and wants nothing to do with the
dying spirit of his father after being contacted by Earl's home care worker
(Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Frank Mackey is a kind of manipulative
motivational speaker.  He tries to expand other men's horizons in the sexual
universe by telling them what sex really is and how to use it to get members
of the opposite gender to fall immediately for them.  His seminars come
complete with a spotlight, head set microphone and flashy wardrobe.  Some
good work here by Cruise, but I hope the members of the Academy don't give
him an Oscar for it.  If they do, it will be in part, a sympathy vote to
compensate Cruise for the ridiculous amount of time he spent making 'Eyes
Wide Shut'.  Sure, a great film in the end and one of the best of 1999 but a
film that could have been made in only a few months.  Earl Partridge is also
filled with regret for marrying an uncaring and unloving woman named Linda
(Julianne Moore).  A neurotic, maniacal female who hates her step son Frank.</P>
<P>Meet Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall).  He is the host of a game show where a
group of kids on one side, take on a group of adults on the other and all
the trappings of the game show world are explored in such a manner as to
leave the most foul taste in your mouth after it's all over.  Jimmy is dying
and only has a couple of months left to live and tries to make amends with
his wife (Melinda Dillon) and his drug addicted daughter (Melora Walters),
who is about to warm up to a police officer (John C. Reilly).  Then there is
the most boring of the stories involving a former child genius (William H.
Macy) as a loser who works at a job he is too overqualified for.  Was
William H. Macy trying to top himself by playing a loser similar to the one
he played in his Oscar nominated role in 'Fargo'.  You won't top that one,
Billy!</P>
<P>What is most shocking about 'Magnolia' is how it uses its music score.  The
music literally goes on for so long that it obliterates the senses and
doesn't know when to quit.  The audience I saw it with was stone faced
throughout its ridiculous running time of three hours and gasps of shock and
disbelief hit the auditorium during the unlikely climax.  What little there
is to rave about in some of the performances, notably Cruise and Reilly, is
drowned out by a protracted chemistry among its cast and is comparable to
having one of your teeth pulled without anesthetic and then needing all of
your teeth removed because your dentist fouled up.  In other words, the film
sets off a chain reaction of dreariness you won't recover from anytime soon
and you won't even care about its characters when it's all said and done.</P>
