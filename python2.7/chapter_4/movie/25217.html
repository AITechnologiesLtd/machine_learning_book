 Scary Movie (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen
Electra, Shannon Elizabeth, Anna Faris, Kurt Fuller, Cheri Oteri, Marlon
Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Regina Hall. Written by Phil Beauman, Jason
Friedberg, Buddy Johnson, Aaron Seltzer, Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans.
Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans. Rated R. Running time: about 88
minutes.</P>
<P> "Scary Movie" sets new highs in low comedy.</P>
<P> It is crude, vulgar and provides something to offend everyone - blacks,
women, teens, gays, lesbians, the mentally challenged, cops and
teachers.</P>
<P> "Scary Movie" also is the funniest movie of the year, a shameless,
unapologetic, savage spoof of teen slasher flicks such as "Scream," "I
Know What You Did Last Summer," their sequels and various rip-offs, as
well as a satiric tip of the cap to "The Sixth Sense," "The Blair Witch
Project" and "The Matrix."</P>
<P> Despite all its crassness, "Scary Movie" is a very smart and expertly
done burlesque, ranking with the likes of "Blazing Saddles," "Young
Frankenstein" and "Airplane."</P>
<P> Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, with the help of six screenwriters, has
created a movie that not only lampoons the genre's well-worn formulas,
but does so by reproducing the cinematic techniques familiar from those
films: the closeup of the hand reaching for the locked door, the
character who suddenly jumps into frame, the telephone unexpectedly
ringing, and so on.</P>
<P> Usually when you see six names in a writing credit, it means trouble;
the cliché about too many cooks is true, especially in screenwriting.
But "Scary Movie" is an exception. The movie has a cohesiveness and
single-minded focus that is maintained from opening reel to closing
credits - and beyond. (Viewer alert: Do not leave after the end credits,
there's more to see.)</P>
<P> This is one movie in which you cannot discuss the jokes. Most are too
tasteless, involving various sexual organs, bodily functions and fluids,
appliances and garden tools. Ironically, the nudity is held to a
minimum, and it's mostly male.</P>
<P> The cast consists basically of young, bland performers, the types you
usually find in such movies. The `Drew Barrymore cameo' role is played
by Carmen Electra as the flatulent Drew.</P>
<P> Also in the cast are Marlon and Shawn Wayans, as well as "Saturday
Night Live" regular Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm, doing a broad spoof
of Courtney Cox's "Scream" news reporter, Gail Weathers.</P>
<P> Oteri also figures in a wild salute to "The Blair Witch Project" that
will leave you reaching for a hankie and laughing until you hurt.</P>
<P> For a film buff such as myself, there is nothing as satisfying as a
top-notch sendup. And "Scary Movie" fits that description. I laughed
from beginning to end, not only at the jokes, but at the recognition of
the ambiance created by director Wayans.</P>
<P> "Scary Movie" is hilarious. Filmgoers without a sense of humor or who
are easily offended might as well stay home. This is not for you.</P>
<P> But for the rest of us who want to feel our bellies shake and we
guffaw, giggle and scream with delight, "Scary Movie" scores a
bulls-eye.</P>
<P> It's a gem, a small treasure, a bit tarnished as well as ribald,
scatological and unrefined. And the first chance I get, I'm going to
rush out and see it again. You'll want to do the same, I guarantee it.</P>
