<P>   In David Lean's 1957 blockbuster "The Bridge on the River
Kwai," a British colonel played by Alec Guinness builds a
bridge while held as POW by the Japanese in World War II. 
The bridge will greatly help the Japanese war effort by
enabling them to transport supplies and is therefore a prime
target of Japan's enemies.  When fellow prisoners played by
William Holden and Jack Hawkins plot to destroy the
overpass, Guinness perversely seeks to preserve it.  The
moral: if you create something and take great pride in your
workmanship, you will do anything, however self-destructive,
to keep it vital.  </P>
<P>   Like Guinness, another Alec (Baldwin) has created a
masterwork--a supercode for the United States National
Security Agency, a cryptogram considered so impenetrable
that he is praised mightily by his superiors and is a man on
his way up.  When a mere nine-year-old kid cracks the code,
an autistic boy no less, the obvious thing for its creator to do
would be to announce its defeat and scrap the failure.  But its
architect has become so bound up with his innovation that he
will not throw in the towel.  Instead, he resolves to eliminate
the "enemy" who has thwarted him and all individuals 
connected with that betrayer.  </P>
<P>   This is not to say that "Mercury Rising" approaches the
caliber of "The Bridge on the River Kwai" however similar the
theme.  David Lean's expansive drama is crammed with the
tension created by a psychological battle of wills, exploits the
stirring music of the Colonel Bogey march, and is conclusively
more believable given the fact that the lines were clearly
drawn between the opposing camps.  "Mercury Rising" is
involving enough as are all slickly-made thrillers with top-
drawer performers, but ultimately it's a by-the-numbers
paranoid thriller highlighting the struggle between opposing
forces within the U.S. government.  </P>
<P>   Released at about the time of two other "disease" movies--
"Niagara, Niagara" (La Tourette's Syndrome) and "Go Now"
(Muscular Sclerosis), "Mercury Rising" focuses on an autistic
nine-year-old, Simon (Mike Hughes), a diehard fan of
crossword and other puzzles, who inadvertently cracks the
supercode by intuiting a phone number buried on a page of
cryptography.  When two middle-level workers in the National
Security Agency report their taped conversation with the kid,
the code's designer, Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin), orders
his hit men to "erase the tape."  They catch his drift.  The rest
of the story combines buddy genre with road movie as
Kudrow and his lackeys go after young Simon, who is
protected by FBI special agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) and
Jeffries' one pal in the bureau, Tommy B. Jordan (Chi
McBride).</P>
<P>   Whether or not the viewers become mesmerized by an
ambulance chase, a dramatic rescue of the wandering kid on
railroad tracks, building roofs and dangerous Chicago
sidewalks, they will absorb some information about autism. 
As played out by young Miko Hughes who spent considerable
time studying the antics of youngsters afflicted with the severe
emotional disturbance, the disorder is characterized by an
inability to connect emotionally or even to look other people in
the eye, a repulsion of physical contact, and a craving for
routine.  When Simon comes home from his special school,
for example, he automatically heads for the jar of Swiss Miss
cocoa and, when preparing to drink it, repeats by rote his
mother's advice to sip the hot liquid slowly.  When touched by
a stranger, he wriggles and screams like a spoiled brat and
when playing with toys he is altogether absorbed in their
mechanics.  He displays one trait which is not uncommon
among people with his ailment: he is a savant--in his case
one who can automatically decode the most intricate of
cryptograms.</P>
<P>   Harold Becker, who directs the action, takes care to show
why agent Jeffries takes such an interest in the boy: when
acting as an undercover agent caught in a standoff between
bank robbers and the FBI, he begs the authorities to give him
a few more minutes to effect a surrender of the gunmen. 
When the authorities ignore him and rush the bank, they kill a
young, impressionable man of about the age of 19 who had
been influenced by the hardened adults, who was ready to
come out and surrender, a needless gunning down of a man
in his prime.  Other aspects of the story are less than
believable, principally the naming by the NSA of one particular
man whom the code is designed to protect--one Rashid
Halabi, an agent placed by the U.S. Government among
Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. Would the very careful
Kudrow have gratuitously given out this specific information? 
Yet another scene which is hard to swallow deals with Stacey
(Kim Dickens) who, having done a favor for a complete
stranger (Jeffries) by watching the kid for a few minutes in a
downtown shop, opens the door to him at 2 a.m. wearing only
a flimsy slip--even while thinking that the man's FBI
identification is a $5 certificate that anyone could forge.
Stacey's role, we might add, is a bit of an "in" joke.  In her
last movie, "The Zero Effect," she assumes the role of Gloria
Sullivan who lines up for a physical therapy session with a
suitcase by her side.  A private detective played by Bill
Pullman looks at the suitcase and determines her profession--
a paramedic.  In "Mercury Rising," Jeffries and Stacey meet
when the former "accidentally" trips over a very similar
suitcase in order to arrange an introduction.</P>
<P>   Mike Hughes joins the ranks of superior child actors, having
mastered the tics and gestures of autism, performing his role
with the prescience and expertise of a talented young man
indeed.  Alec Baldwin is underutilized: sporting his signature
pompadour and exuding his usual refinement he turns in a
conscientious performance as a guy who is intoxicated with
his success and determined to let no one stand in his way.  In
what is now the standard practice of Hollywood pictures, he is
reviled for his wealth: Willis has a ball knocking over an entire
section of the precious wines from Baldwin's well-stocked
cellar.</P>
<P>   The movie does not shirk from the extreme violence that
audiences have come to expect from the genre, but the car
chases, chopper rescues, U.S. government malcontents and
adorable kids are mixed together with no trace of an original
point of view. Rated R.  Running time: 130 minutes.  (C)
