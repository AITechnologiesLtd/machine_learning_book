<PRE>THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS (1970)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Arhur Hiller
Writer: Neil Simon
Starring: Jack Lemmon, Sandy Dennis, Billy Dee Williams, Carlos
Montalban, Anne Meara, Ron Carey</P>
<P>Films where everything possible goes wrong for the protagonists have to
be carefully constructed, because it can either be really, really funny;
moody; or just plain redundant.  "The Out-of-Towners" luckily lands in
the first spot, since it never stops being funny, especially with a
great script by Neil Simon and two Oscar-winners in the leads (Lemmon
for "Mister Roberts" and "Save the Tiger;" Dennis for "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?").</P>
<P>Lemmon and Dennis are a slightly neurotic suburban couple with a family,
a stationwagon, and him with a typical desk job.  He, however, has had a
chance to branch out, with an interview for a substantially
better-paying job in the heart of Manhattan, which is a big step for a
suburban family.  Lemmon is so ecstatic that he has planned everything
by hour.  He's built everything up so much that it's bound to falter.</P>
<P>Things go nicely until they're up in the plane and find out the plane
can't land because there has been a sudden transit strike.  Then the
plane is directed to Cincinatti, throwing the two off, and having them
run all over Cincinatti looking for a train.  This is only the beginning
of their problems.  By film's end, they will be robbed, rained on,
witness a robbery, have to spend a night in Central Park, robbed again,
be chased across a plain in Central Park by a cop on horseback, become
near deaf for an hour, and anything else imaginable.  The ending is
predictable, yet somehow satisfying.</P>
<P>The thing that elevates this is the acting and the script.  There are
almost hundreds of speaking parts, since they go all over the place, and
a couple cameos from people who would be somewhat noteworthy (the most
being Lando himself, Billy Dee Williams, as a lost-and-found clerk,
followed by Ricardo Montalban's brother, Carlos, who would star in Woody
Allen's "Bananas").  And every step is just as hilarious if not more
hilarious then the other.  I frequently found myself laughing
hysterically.</P>
<P>The acting is fantastic.  I mean, Lemmon and Dennis, how could either of
them not be fantastic?  Dennis takes what would just be a throwaway part
turned into a whiny part, and makes her likeable.  And Lemmon, king of
making whiners seem tolerable, is near perfect.</P>
<P>This isn't a great film, although it does show the underbelly of
Manhattan (which, if you think about it, IS Manhattan), but if you
really want to laugh hysterically at a film that never stops being
funny, I reccomend you check this one out.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
