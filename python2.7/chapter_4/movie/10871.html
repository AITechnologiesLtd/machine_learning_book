<P>     "I've always wanted to be in films," says dancer/choreographer Pablo
Veron at one point in THE TANGO LESSON, to which writer/director Sally
Potter replies "I've always wanted to be a dancer."  Well, both get their
chance in a grating feature-length self-indulgence disguised as a fanciful
romance.  Potter plays a film-maker named Sally, visiting Paris after
difficulties getting financing for her latest project (which is thoroughly
unbelievable, since the project in question involves the pure box office
gold of models dressed in primary colors pursued by a legless fashion
designer).  There she meets Veron, and convinces the dancer to teach her
the tango.  Along the way they sort of fall in love, dance, sort of break
up, dance some more, sort of get back together again, and dance a whole
lot more.</P>
<P>     Somewhere buried in this collection of dance sequences are a few
meditations on one's calling in life, the need to surrender control and
the connections between various art forms.  More power to you if you
manage to exhume them.  THE TANGO LESSON carries no emotional pull, since
both lead performers have the seasoned acting chops of...well, a director
and a dancer.  Some of the dance sequences are impressive, particularly
Veron's solo tap number in a kitchen, but the portentous and pretentious
flow of the narrative robs them of all joy -- imagine Gene Kelly directed
by Fellini, and you'll understand why THE TANGO LESSON is such a bizarre
experience.  Robby Muller's typically impressive black-and-white
cinematography only emphasizes that the film is an empty visual
exercise, a project so personal it can only leave the audience wondering
why in the world it should care.  Potter's spin on Fellini's 8-1/2 is
merely a moderately depressing record of the film-maker's mid-life crisis,
in which she attempts to assure the world that she could too be a
ballerina if she really wanted to.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 tangos up in blue:  4.</PRE>
