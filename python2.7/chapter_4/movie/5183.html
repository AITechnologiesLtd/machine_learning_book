<PRE>                               CYCLO (1996)
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1996 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>Vietnam, in the context of films, is usually associated with the 
proliferation of Vietnam war films.  But 'Cyclo', and the same director's 
earlier 'The Scent of Green Papaya', portray a very different view of 
Vietnam.  Tran Anh Hung's films concentrate on everyday life in Vietnam, 
before (in the case of 'Papaya'), and since (in the case of 'Cyclo') the 
war.</P>
<P>Both films share the same acute observation of the dynamics of a family. 
Both share the same slow, deliberate, development of their themes.  Where 
'Papaya' was a gentle chronicle of the development of a family, 'Cyclo' 
shows an altogether les pleasant side of life.  Its central character is 
the driver of a rickshaw taxi, who is innocent and well-meaning but is 
gradually drawn into petty crime and corruption.  In tha background, the 
contrasts between the affluent, the poor, and the sleazy in present-day 
Vietnam are brutally portrayed.  The sound of the motorcycle engine that 
powers the rickshaw, runs in the background almost continuously, and 
helps to convey the noisy, dusty, feel of a city in the far East.</P>
<P>Despite the film's gentle pace, its message is planted firmly in the 
viewers' minds.  There is some violence, but, more powerful than the 
violence, there are scenes where characters look on impassively, at the 
most cold-blooded treatment of others.  It doesn't make comfortable 
watching, but does record how easily people can be brutalised.  Vietnam 
is developing now as a destination for tourism, and a country on the edge 
of the affluent Pacific Rim.  Far as 'Cyclo' is from the stuff of 
mainstream cinema, it is a salutary reminder that Vietnam remains a 
troubled land.</P>
