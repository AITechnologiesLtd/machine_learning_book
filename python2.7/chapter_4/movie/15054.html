<PRE>PRACTICAL MAGIC (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>It's hard not to like Practical Magic. It has a talented cast, wonderful
music, and beautiful cinematography. The one thing that Practical Magic
doesn't have is a cohesive script to make all the good elements stick
together.</P>
<P>Practical Magic is like a witch's brew. To conjure up this brew, throw in
one part drama, one part whodunnit, two parts romance, and a sprinkle of
supernatural. This is the largest failure of Practical Magic. Once the
movie settles into a comfortable genre it jumps out and goes into another.
This is jarring for the audience and never gives the audience anything to
hang on to.</P>
<P>Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens are sisters. They
are from a long line of witches. The curse of the Owens women is that each
man they fall in love with will eventually die before his time. Sally and
Gillian are outcasts in their small town because their witch aunts (Dianne
Wiest and Stockard Channing) raised them both as witches.</P>
<P>There are a few subplots in Practical Magic. One talks about Sally's
children and husband. Another talks about a murder and an investigation
headed by an outsider, Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn). Then there is a story of
a lost soul, one of a romance between a sister and Hallet, and finally one
about the town's rejection of the Owens family. With all these subplots,
the story is quite unfocused. Though, it didn't have to be if the script
were smarter and the director sharper.</P>
<P>Aidan Quinn's was the one good performance that stood out. His lonely but
strong cop is the best of the characters in Practical Magic. His
performance is also the best. His character gets stuck in a sticky
situation when he falls in love with a witch that is probably a murderer. </P>
<P>Sandra Bullock does nothing new with her part. She continues to try to
regain what popularity she lost with her flop, Speed 2. Bullock brings back
her girl-next-door act making Practical Magic feel somewhat like a witch's
version of Hope Floats.</P>
<P>Nicole Kidman is good as the bad sister. Kidman just looks different in
Practical Magic. Her performance is slinky and snake-like. It was a pure
joy to watch Kidman onscreen.</P>
<P>The script by Robin Swicord and Akiva (Lost in Space and Batman and Robin)
Goldsman and Adam Brooks is an absolute mess. The script is based on Alice
Hoffman's book by the same name. Practical Magic just drips of Goldsman's
bad writing. In most cases, books are better than the movies made from
them. And in most cases screenwriters are smart enough to cut out some
subplots from books because of time restraints. Swicord, Goldsman, and
Brooks are not this smart. It feels as if they tried to squeeze every
subplot from the book into a two-hour script.</P>
<P>Practical Magic is nothing magical. Nor is it anything new. There is no
real target audience for Practical Magic because it drifts from one genre
to another. But it is somewhat entertaining. If you really want to see
Practical Magic, wait until it comes out on video.</P>
