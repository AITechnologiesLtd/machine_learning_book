<P>JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK (2001) / ** 1/2</P>
<P>Directed by Kevin Smith, from his screenplay. Starring Jason Mewes, Smith,
Ben Affleck. Running time: 104 minutes. Rated R for offensive language by
the MFCB. Reviewed on September 6th, 2001.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: Potheads Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) learn from their
friend Holden (Affleck) that their likenesses are being used in a new
feature film, based on a comic book created by Holden and his ex-partner,
Banky (Jason Lee). Determined to put a stop to the movie, Jay and Silent
Bob set out for Hollywood. En route, they befriend a monkey, encounter a
quartet of suspicious women -- including the lovely Justice (Shannon
Elizabeth) -- and run afoul of a hapless wildlife offer (Will Ferrell).</P>
<P>Review: "Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back" feels like a late-night wrap
party; it's a loud, fun, silly release. "Jay And Silent Bob" has none of
the keen ethical acuity of "Dogma" or "Chasing Amy", nor "Clerks"'s sly
social awareness; it's just a traditional road comedy, an excuse to put a 
bunch of Smith characters (and actors) back onto the screen one last time
and take a few more potshots at his favourite targets. The result, not
unexpectedly, is somewhat uneven, and exhibits a "Saturday Night
Live"-like ignorance of when a joke has outlived its usefulness. To a
degree, it's also a rather inaccessible movie: if you're unfamiliar with
earlier Smith flicks, the appearance of some actors in multiple roles may
be confusing. Similarly, if you've never heard of, say, the debate over
Greedo shooting first, much of the cinema-oriented humour may not be to  
your taste. That said, there are moments of brilliance, especially for  
Smith aficionados: the "Scooby Doo" and "Planet Of The Apes" pastiches  
are priceless, as is the scene in which the title characters provide wish
fulfillment for any long-suffering Usenetter. And "Jay And Silent Bob  
Strike Back" succeeds as a last hurrah for Smith's seminal creations: it
both celebrates the characters, and leaves us satisfied that their story
has now been told.</P>
