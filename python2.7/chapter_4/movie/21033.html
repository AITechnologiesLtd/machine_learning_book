<PRE>BANDITS
A film review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Athan Bezaitis 1999</PRE>
<P>Foreign films have a unique and powerful way of facing controversial
issues.  The most recent example comes from Germany, which has created
a movie so audacious in its statement of women's liberation, that it
makes the much-scrutinized themes of THELMA AND LOUISE feel like
child's play.  Despite subtitles, unfamiliar faces, and a somewhat
taboo motif, BANDITS is sure to have tremendous crossover appeal with
American audiences.</P>
<P>Directed by Katja von Garier,BANDITS chronicles four German fugitives
and their passion for rock n' roll as they attempt to evade the law
and flee the country. Their odyssey takes this all girls rock band
(hence The Bandits) from rehearsal at the prison church to performing
in front of thousands as they garner Mickey and Mallory-esque
attention through their adventures as outlaws on the run. Their
experiences and emotions are conveyed in their music, which serves as
a link between their depraved sense of humanity and newfound freedom.</P>
<P>The less you know about the film going into it the more enjoyable it
will be, so if you hear anyone talking about it, do yourself a favor
and cover your ears.</P>
<P>The cast is fabulous and the best part is that you've never seen these
actors in any other roles, unless of course, you're from Germany. How
often can you say that about an American film?  For all I knew it was
the German Sharon Stone and Tom Cruise on screen, but none of that
mattered because I was focusing solely upon characters rather than
well-publicized canned images.</P>
<P>Don't let the fact that this is a women's lib film deter you.  The
excellent soundtrack is all in English.  The cinematography and the
action are fantastic, and trust me when I say that the themes of
female autonomy are not at all overbearing and only add to the
nostalgia of the movie.</P>
<P>Find out which small theater in your neighborhood is playing this film
and check it out.  It's well worth the effort.</P>
