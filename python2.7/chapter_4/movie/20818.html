<P>   There's an old saying that if you put ten people of the
Jewish faith in a room and set them loose to discuss any
topic (law, religion, politics, you-name-it), you'll get eleven
opinions.  Contrary to the view of anti-Semites who haven't
the foggiest notion of this 5700-year-old culture, there is no
one Jewish ideology.  Even when the chips are down--as we
see in this movie directed by a man whose father spent time
as a captive in a work camp--the potential victims continue
arguing throughout about the proper method of escape from
the oppressors.  Yet underneath the surface, the people of
Radu Mihaileanu's film, "Train of Life," feel a keen simpatico
for one another, a fellowship that transcends their ideological
and practical variations.  If Mihaileanu's movie portrays the
Jews in the tradition of storytellers Sholom Aleichem and
Isaac Bashevis Singer as dolts, dunces and misguided
prophets, this is his wholly positive intention.  After all,
weren't the Nazis the ones who had a vision of a perfect
society, of all men and women thinking the same, acting 
identically, and bearing no flaws?  To any contemplative
person, such an order would be a nightmare. Think about
that.</P>
<P>   "Train of Life," an English-subtitled movie which features
French speaking actors performing in rural Romania, is told
from the point of view of an acknowledged fool, Shlomo
(played by the noted French actor Lionel Abelanski). 
Shlomo's tale is mythical, a fable, a fairy story of a part with
that large group of folklore designed to help make life
bearable for a people subjected to persecution for thousands
of years.  The story opens two years into World War II in a
shtetl, or village, inhabited by Jews--and by Christians who
appear not ill-disposed toward them but are instead
dependent on their business.  When Shlomo gets word that
Germans have invaded a nearby hamlet and are deporting
the Jews to camps, he races to tell the rabbi who at first is
disbelieving but who quickly senses the truth of the situation. 
The inhabitants get together to debate methods of escape
and though the group are varied and include a Communist
and a romantic pair who are envied by at least two would-be
suitors, the rabbi and council of wise men agree on a bold
plan.  They acquire a used train which they paint in bright
colors, assign half the males to dress in Nazi uniforms to play
the enemy, and all board pretending that they are a band of
Jews headed to the camps. In reality they are to proceed
through Rumania, to Russia, and ultimately to Palestine.</P>
<P>   One of the oddest road movies to hit the screen in ages,
"Train of Life" follows the band of hardy innocents as they run
into an assortment of adventures.  Each adventure could well
have been the basis of tragedy, but proceeding throughout in
a comic tone, Mihaileanu turns each exploit into a farcical
event.  Chief among these is a Hogan's Heroes specimen. 
When one of the travelers, a tailor, is captured by real Nazis,
Mordechai (Rufus), who is dressed as a high German officer,
heads directly into the German-occupied headquarters to talk
his way into getting the prisoner back, hinting to the
hauptsturmfurher (Robert Borremans) that the latter might be
suspected of having friendly feelings toward the captive.  How
he gets this commandant to supply the entire train with a
groaning board of food is worth the price of admission in
itself.</P>
<P>   "Train of Life," which beat "Shakespeare in Love" and
"Central Station" for the Italian Academy Award for best
foreign language film, is infused by its filmmaker with a great
deal of warmth for the Jewish victims of the Holocaust in
Rumania.  Amid the self-deprecatory humor, the fights, the
ideological squabbles, we are impressed by the tenacity of
the People of the Book who emerge from  abuse and tyranny 
using humor as their principal weapon of survival
against unspeakable acts of humiliation.  Fascist ideology is
shown as the humbug that it is when the stiff Germans are
contrasted with the imperfect, life-affirming people, who in
moments of greatest danger can dance wildly to the foot-
stomping beats of Klezmer music.  Though Robert Benigni,
originally offered the role of Shlomo the Fool, had to turn
down the proposal because of other commitments, one could
not have hoped for a more moving and joyous cast than the
one assembled here, a cast which allegedly included 8,000
Rumanians who served as extras.  </P>
<P>   "Train of Life" is not the first comic take on the Holocaust--
one which is not about to be unanimously accepted as kosher
by those who feel that the Shoah must be treated with utter
solemnity.  But if the Yiddish proverb is valid, "A gelechter
hertmen veiter vi a gevain," or, "Laughter is heard further
than weeping," "Train of Life" is all the more likely to help
keep the memory of the Holocaust alive.</P>
