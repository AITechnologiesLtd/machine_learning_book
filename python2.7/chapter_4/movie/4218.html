<PRE>                               GOLD DIGGERS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This was supposed to be an exciting adventure about two
thirteen-year-old girls who became close friends even though they
seemed to have nothing in common.  Instead, the "adventure" is quite
unexciting ... boring, in fact, thus wasting the talents of two fine
young actresses: Anna Chlumsky who appeared in MY GIRL and MY GIRL 2,
and Christina Ricci who was the unsmiling little girl in the ADDAMS
FAMILY, and CASPER.</P>
<P>     The story, in addition to lacking any excitement, is also on the
unbelievable side.  Jody (Anna) has a map of a nearby mountain that no
one believes has gold.  Miners have died years ago in an explosion and
since then everyone has forgotten or derided the idea that there might
be gold there.  But not our tomboyish Jody.  She entices city-bred Beth
(Christina) to go with her to explore the mysterious mountain.  They
use what looks like a boat that has been put together with chewing gum
and sail down the river, miles from home, although Beth has promised
her mother she would be home for dinner.  Fat chance.</P>
<PRE>     Did they find the gold?  You are allowed but one guess.</PRE>
<PRE>     Perhaps the very young (ages 7-10) may like it.</PRE>
<P>Directed by Kevin James Dobson and written by Barry Glasser.</P>
