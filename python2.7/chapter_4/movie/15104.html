<P>REVIEW: Velvet Goldmine
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>

Collette, Eddie Izzard, Emily Woof, Michael Feast
Director: Todd Haynes
Writers: Todd Haynes, James Lyons
Australian theatrical release date: November 5, 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 star</PRE>
<P>In the classic Trains Plains and Automobiles, Steve Martin gave the late
John Candy some valuable advice: "If you're going to tell a story, have
a point - it makes it so much more interesting for the listener!"  This
quote has never been truer than in Velvet Goldmine, a pointless and
apathetic examination of nothing in particular, and a lot of it.</P>
<P>Writer-director Todd Haynes has created a controversial and original
piece; one that doesn't rely so much on its main characters but rather
whom they might represent.  David Bowie, for example, bears a striking
resemblance to Velvet Goldmine's fictional protagonist, Brian Slade
(Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a bisexual flower power rock star. But this
isn't a character study, nor is it a study of contrasting eras and
social trends - all of which would have probably helped the film keep
its stride, had it managed to choose which one it wanted to focus on.</P>
<P>The complex narrative is set in two different eras: 1971-74, when Slade
fakes his own assassination during a concert, and ten years later, when
reporter Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) is asked to investigate what
happened to the former pop icon.  Arthur has deep familiarization with
Slade and his movement, having been affected emotionally and sexually by
his radical ethics.</P>
<P>Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks laughable in the title role, giving Slade a
pompous and wanky presence thanks to a weak screenplay and some
extravagant 70's costumes.  "I like boys…and I like girls," says the
actor, looking as stupid as the film itself. Any chance of examining
Slade's character is conveniently avoided, as Haynes seems much more
concerned with showcasing homosexual orgies rather than studying what
makes him kick.  As a result, I didn't understand or care about his
actions, as Slade comes across as a preying-on-school-boys bastard, and
nothing more.  The screenplay might have worked if Haynes had written
Slade as effectively bastardly as someone like Chad in Neil LaButes In
the Company of Men, but he reveals no level of talent that would allow
coherent writing to last for more than just a couple of minutes.</P>
<P>Adding insult to, well, insult, Velvet Goldmine attempts to link the
movements of its protagonist to the great Oscar Wilde, with dismal
results.  Since Todd Haynes has failed to create anything worthwhile
himself, he takes a couple of people who made successes of themselves,
and then tries to make the film successful.  If either actually cared
about this awful little film, David Bowe would sue, and Oscar Wilde
would turn in his grave.</P>
