<P>"No more shenanigans!!!" 
--- An exasperated Dean Chase (Ken Olfson), trying to shut down the
H.O.T.S. sorority in H.O.T.S. </P>
<P>H.O.T.S. features a group of shall we say "top heavy" college girls who,
after being rejected for membership in the prestigious Pi sorority at
Fairenville University, decide to get even by starting their own
sorority and stealing away every man on campus.  A heartwarming tale
indeed. </P>
<P>Quite surprisingly though, H.O.T.S. is a good natured, entertaining
little romp of a movie.  Sure there's nothing original here, as it
follows the 70's college T&A genre to the letter and then some
(concentrating heavily on the "T" portion of said genre), but so what? 
Now normally, the right-minded movie critic in me should be trashing
this film, calling it degrading to women and whatnot.  However, let me
point out that the movie was written by two women. </P>
<P>Let me also point out that this movie is just entertainingly goofy from
start to finish.  The girls in the cast, many of whom were Playboy
Playmates, are attractive in that 70s kind of way, and the performances
are so far over the top that you can't help but be entertained by them. 
And how could you not like a movie that features a topless skydiver
named Boom-Boom Bangs? </P>
<P>In addition to the main "plot" of seducing all the men on campus (which
while discussed, really doesn't happen that much in the film), there are
dozens of subplots, each one as charmingly absurd as the next.  For
example, the girls have to contend with two bumbling crooks who've
recently escaped from jail and are attempting to infiltrate the H.O.T.S.
house.  The crooks are trying to recover the stolen loot they stashed
there before they were incarcerated, and they make several "wacky"
attempts to enter the house. </P>
<P>In an odd plotline that ultimately ties into the previously mentioned
one, some of the guys from Fairenville University steal a rival school's
mascot, a huge black bear (animals are a running theme in H.O.T.S. by
the way, as the girls keep a live seal in their sorority house as a
mascot).  The bear manages to escape from the van it's in and ends up
taking a swim in the H.O.T.S. girls' swimming pool.  While swimming, the
bear gets a whiff of something and proceeds to climb a ladder to the top
of the H.O.T.S. house.  In the attic, the bear finds a bee hive and
enjoys some honey.  The bear then remains in the attic UNDETECTED FOR
DAYS until eventually foiling the bumbling crooks, as the money was
stashed in the attic.  Later, the bear flies a hot air balloon (don't
ask). </P>
<P>A couple of cast and crew members from H.O.T.S. of note: Donald Petrie
who plays "Doug" is now a successful director, scoring big with Grumpy
Old Men, one of my personal favorites.  Rowdy Herrington, who served as
an electrician, is also a successful director with films like Road House
and Striking Distance under his belt.  And Danny Bonaduce of course went
on to fight Geraldo Rivera (or was it Donny Osmond?  I forget...) on Pay
Per View. </P>
<P>But you don't care about any of that do you?  Nah, if you're interested
in this movie then you're interested in one thing: boobs.  Well, there
are boobs-a-plenty in H.O.T.S., as was the standard with this genre. 
They come early and often too... showers, wet T-shirt contests, and
there's a grand finale of boobery with a strip football game between the
H.O.T.S. girls and the Pi Sorority.  The members of the M.P.A.A. would
probably have heart attacks today trying to rate this film, as you just
don't see so many naked breasts in today's R-rated flicks.  [Editor's
note: For whatever reason, boobs is just a fun word to write.  Try it
yourself sometime.  Boobs, boobs...] </P>
<P>H.O.T.S. is available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  The disc
contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (and
is enhanced for 16x9 televisions), and includes the original theatrical
trailer.  The transfer for this film is better than you'd expect... the
images are crisp and clear and free of artifacts.  Give Anchor Bay a lot
of credit for continually restoring and releasing the smaller films out
there.  If you enjoy this type of campy fun, then this is a good disc to
add to your library.  [R]</P>
