<P>While a large audience may be expected to stream to
"Serendipity" with the view that this is the kind of movie we need
after the terrorist attack of September 11, I couldn't help thinking
of New Yorker magazine's critic David Denby's piece quoting
Dana Walden, president of 20th century Fox Television in the
October 1 issue, "A lot of people will be looking for blue skies and
escapist dramas and programs as an alternative to the realities
that all of us are dealing with now."  Denby states that this
amounts to a misreading of the moment, noting that even during
the Second World War "bland family entertainment attracted a lot
of movie-goers...but the early forties were also the time of highly
popular noir melodramas, Preston Sturges's boisterous
comedies, and Humphrey Bogart's emergence as a sardonic new
hero."  Nothing about "Serendipity" says "Preston Sturges."
Despite John de Borman's gorgeous views of upscale Manhattan
areas, particularly the upper East Side's Bloomingdale's coupled
with some surreal images of people in motion, Peter Chelsom's
film based on Marc Klein's script is cotton-candy-predictable, a
meet-cute romantic comedy derivative of classics like "The
Graduate" and even (though it's a stretch) "Miracle on 34th
Street."  While its saving grace is the lovely and elegant Kate
Beckinsale--who class-wise is in a different league than John
Cusack--the film's side roles are inhabited by the unappealing
Molly Shannon in the role of the prospective bride's best friend,
Jeremy Priven as the slightly obnoxious brother of the intended
groom, and a bevy of upper-middle class parents and friends of
the leads who seem to have come out of Mme. Tussaud's. 
Chelsom cannot even make good use of comic genius Eugene
Levy, so flat-out hilarious in "American Pie" and its sequel, who
this time plays a Bloomingdale's salesman fond of repeating ad
nauseum that customers must stand behind the line separating
the employees from the customers.</P>
<P>Were Kate Beckinsale in the role of an eccentric British
expatriate Sara just a tad less desirable, we might wonder why
John Cusack (playing the thirty-something Jonathan) would be
willing to play along with her hard-to-get machinations.  When the
two young people meet while competing to buy a pair of black
gloves featured on the rack at Bloomie's, they are attracted like
magnets, but despite a magical evening together at an ice-cream
parlor on E. 60th Street called Serendipity 3 and later blading on
the ice at Rockfeller Center, Sara insists that fate decide their
future.  She writes her name and phone number in a novel,
instructing Jonathan that she will sell the book and, if the
pleasant suitor should happen to find it in a used book store, he
may feel free to call her.  </P>
<P>This is the sort of movie that used to open up about
Christmastime before the year that December was reserved for
major Oscar contenders.  Indeed the sight of falling snow adds to
the romantic allure of the picture and could make the folks who
live in Southern Cal, Florida and Arizona a mite envious of their
East Coast countrymen.  The mood cast by Mr. de Borman's
lensing competes with Ms. Beckinsale herself for loveliness but
as a story, "Serendipity" is too calculating, too bereft of any
genuine accidents to be a fortuitous happening.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 91 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
