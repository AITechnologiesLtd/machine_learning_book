<P>   Whatever happened to the swinging bachelor and the
liberated, single female?  In writer-director Nicholas Barker's
new movie, the number of such persons in New York City is
zero, and to prove it writ small, he explores the lives of four
zeroes who are whining and depressed residents of the Big
Apple.  Each day they mix in with the city's lonely crowd and
each day they return to their pads bewildered and frustrated
with their inability to meet permanent partners.  Why are
these four, who are so motivated, nay, obsessed with the idea
of locating someone to share their lives, unable to connect? 
The answer lies not in their ages, though one is 54 years old,
but in their self-delusion, their inability to make necessary
changes in themselves, their hostility toward the opposite sex,
and perhaps even an unconscious desire to remain single.  In
a town of seven million people, it should not take one guy
fifteen years of advertising in the personals and hanging out
in bachelor classes like "Cooking for Singles" to find just one
other human being.</P>
<P>   "Unmade Beds" is a fictional documentary, and if that genre
sounds like an original, the movie indeed is an archetype. 
Originality is not always coincident with quality, and while
Barker's efforts--which apparently won him the audience
award at the 1997 Telluride Film Festival in Colorado--evoke
poignancy and at times hilarity, the story sinks in a sea of
redundance after the first forty minutes.  What's more, the
story could probably be better told on the stage, the director
dissolving time and space in the style that theater can do
best.</P>
<P>   About this oxymoron, "fictionalized documentary."  What
Barker did was to send a research team into the singles field,
each disguised as a guy or gal on the prowl.  They
interviewed hundreds of New Yorkers on the phone and with
camcorders, then chose four principals to be the center of the
narrative.  Treating these performers like subjects in a typical
psychological experiment, he told them that he was using
them for a feature and not a documentary, which would get
them to lower their defenses.  Based on extensive
interviewing, Barker scripted a movie which dramatizes the
flaws in the unhappy quartet.</P>
<P>   He first introduces Brneda Monte, once a lap dancer and
now the divorced mother of a teenager.  She insists that her
problem is not finding men but mining gold.  Like an earnest
CPA she sums up her plight: she takes in $2,000 per month
but spends $3,000.  She wants an older man with lots of cash
and little libido to finance her life, and as payback is willing to
toss him some sex, maybe three or four times a month. 
The other woman in the cast is Aimee Copp, who is 28, and
who is determined to marry at age 30.  (She does not say
what she will do if she does not achieve her goal, but let's not
imagine the potential damage she will inflict on herself.)  Her
trouble, she says, is that she is 225 pounds and that only big-
woman fetishists are interested in such a heavy package.</P>
<P>   Of the men, the more sympathetic is 40-year-old Michael
De Stefano, a nice-looking guy who works for the city
transportation department and who is dogged by comments
like "Why aren't you married" from people who, he thinks,
suspects that he is gay.  He claims to be searching for a wife
for 15 years, placing ads in the personals column of the New
York Press and attending singles functions--all to no avail. 
Fifty-four year old Mikey Russo likes movies, writes
screenplays, but is as unsuccessful in selling his stories as he
is in selling himself to women.</P>
<P>   From time to time director Barker, in a homage to Alfred
Hitchcock, takes a brief break from the intense personalities
to sneak looks through apartment windows, where New
Yorkers seem not to care a fig about privacy as they undress
and make love.</P>
<P>   The good news and bad news alike--depending on your
interpretation--is that you'll want to throw rocks and sticks at
the people on the screen.  They don't invite sympathy from
the audience.  Because of their flawed personalities and base
motivations, they rouse disgust from the viewers.  The best
example is Aimee, who bitches and whines to her girl friend at
every possible moment.  She admits that she has always had
a weight problem but says that her main man will just "have
to be OK" on that since she will weigh this much for the rest
of her life.  She has apparently not heard of the concept that
you can lose weight if you burn more calories than you
consume and seems to blame the gods for making her fat. 
She is a woman with no redeeming features, either physical
or personality-wise...well, maybe one, as she boasts: "I have
health benefits."  She considers herself better than guys she
dates who don't have this advantage.  She insists that she
has a good job as well, as she well may, given the fact that
she rides around the city in taxis and totes large bags from
Balducci's.</P>
<P>   Brenda Monte is also repugnant, but has the redeeming
value of humor.  Almost every word from her mouth summons
laughter from the audience. She thinks she wants a mate
not to fill up her lonely hours but simply to support her
financially.  She is the traditional gold-digger but doesn't have
the looks or the charm to succeed in that profession--though
she seems to attract males who want to show her their
penises.  "I get to see two dicks a day," or so she says.</P>
<P>   Mikey Russo is a liar and a ne'er-do-well who despite his
ordinary appearance insists that he will not date a "mutt." 
When he is stuck on a blind date with a mutt, he has a friend
beep him.  He then tells his date that he has an emergency
situation in the office and must leave forthwith.  Yet he, like
the others, has no idea why women are turned off on him. 
"I'm not cheap," he boasts, "Every woman who comes to my
apartment gets a new Oral B toothbrush."</P>
<P>   The last time audience members wanted to throw things at
the screen was at Neil LaBute's "In the Company of Men"
which featured a sleazeball's plan to dump on a vulnerable
female and ultimately on his own best friend.  That movie was
so good that it never wore out its welcome.  Nicholas Barker
should have quit while he was ahead, while his characters still
had some charm and an ability to tickle our funny bones. 
When we spent as much time with them as we would with a
date, we tend to become nauseated.</P>
