                               FAMILY BUSINESS
                       A film review by Robert Dorsett
                        Copyright 1989 Robert Dorsett</PRE>
<P>     FAMILY BUSINESS stars Sean Connery as an elderly burglar in New York.
Dustin Hoffman appears as his estranged son, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew 
Broderick as *his* son.</P>
<P>     The dynamics of the film are complicated.  Suffice it to say that
Connery's character is a professional burglar.  Hoffman's used to be one as
well, but  gave it up, in favor of "legitimate" business.  There is a conflict
between  father and son.  Broderick is portrayed as a smart kid who
mysteriously  drops out of a master's degree program--to "join the family
business."  His father isn't very happy about that, but his grandfather is
supportive.  The rest of the movie deals with a caper and the various conflicts
among the three men.</P>
<P>     This is a relatively serious movie, with good characterizations all
around.  It's the first "serious" film Connery's been in in a LONG time (he
tends to favor action/adventure films, which he invariably shines in).
Broderick is surprisingly good as the grandson.  Hoffman's well, Hoffman.
Everyone has a nasty side to himself: this isn't a gooey-feel-good Christmas
movie.</P>
<P>     Don't get the impression that this is another THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY.
(which was also a good movie)  It isn't.  </P>
<PRE>Rating: 8/10.</PRE>
