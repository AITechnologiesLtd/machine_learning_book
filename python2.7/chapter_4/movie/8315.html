<P>Scream
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1996, R, 111 minutes [1 hour, 51 minutes]
[horror]
starring: Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox (Gail Weathers), Skeet Ulrich
(Billy), Matthew Lillard (Stu), written by Kevin Williamson, produced by
Cathy Konrad, Cary Woods, directed by Wes Craven.</P>
<P>Of all the genres out there, horror is probably the most difficult to work
with in terms of making something really original (aren't they all about
stupid teenagers getting hacked up?). Given that, you'd think satirizing the
genre would be simple, but "Scream" disproves both of these ideas. It works
as a wholly original horror film by, ironically, blatantly admitting it's a
"Dead Teenager Movie" and exploiting itself.</P>
<P>The film opens in typical "slasher flick" style by depicting a girl (Drew
Barrymore) home alone on a Friday night getting ready to watch some "scary
videos" with her soon-to-be-arriving boyfriend. The phone rings and it's a
guy with a scary, but somehow charming voice. The two talk until the guy
sounds like a psychotic stalker and the mood becomes full of thick suspense
within a matter of minutes. Since this is a horror film you know what's going
to happen, but the script is so fluid and the scene shot with such
plausibility you can't help but be caught up in the tension of it all. It's a
90s take on countless bad scenes of such from the 70s and 80s and it works.</P>
<P>In fact, this is how the film works as a whole. The horror genre is pretty
much dead (no pun intended) as far as Hollywood is concerned, so what makes
the film appealing is the realistic way it deals with the plot of
masked-psycho-killer-on-the-loose-in-a-small-town. The main characters are
mostly teens who grew up on "Dead Teenager" movies and look back at them with
a more intelligent and mature manner. When they hear about the masked
murderer they can't believe what's happening because it's so much like a
movie but this time it's real (well, you know what I mean).</P>
<P>I'm afraid to describe any of the numerous details, even giving away the
basic plot might be too much of a spoiler. Basically, it's the story of a
girl named Sidney (Campbell) whose mother was raped and murdered a year ago,
and now the masked murderer who killed the girl in the beginning is after
her. Since this isn't a sequel to anything it's obvious the killer must be
someone right under our nose, but who could it be? </P>
<P>Williamson's script, as directed by Craven makes every character seem like a
suspect, not because they seem like they'd be a silent psychopath but because
they don't (it's always the last person you suspect eh?). One by one, main
and supporting characters are knocked off but done so in such close proximity
to each other (in terms of physical space and elapsed time) it's impossible
to tell who the killer is. </P>
<P>The only problem I had was the execution scenes where the characters always
manage to fight back and stall the killer, but of course trap themselves in
the process. Sometimes this seems just plain  cheesy (why does only Sidney
turn into a superhero but not the other victims?).</P>
<P>I'm not sure about the ending though. In one way you could say it follows
the logical conclusion of the film when it reveals the killer and their
motive, but in another way you could say it contradicts the entire premise by
doing so. I found the ending to be a bit more surrealistic and violent than
necessary. Maybe there shouldn't have been an ending at all, but since the
entire film exploits itself in leading up to the ending I guess it makes
sense.</P>
<P>"Scream" isn't a work of genius, but it's not a bad movie. Sometimes it
tries too hard to make for suspense, but it works as a whole by constantly
throwing plot twists and making us wonder what's going to happen next. When's
the last time a horror movie did that?</P>
