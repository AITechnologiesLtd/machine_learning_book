<PRE>I Walked with a Zombie (1943)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 89</PRE>
<P>Between 1942 and 1943, Jacques Tourneur directed
three cerebral horror films for RKO studios.
They were "Cat People", "I Walked with a Zombie",
and "The Leopard Man".  While ignored by the
Academy Awards, these films quickly developed
a strong reputation and a cult following.  While
"Cat People" is in the National Film Registry,
and is the more famous and commercially successful
film, "I Walked with a Zombie" may be Tourneur's
best effort.</P>
<P>The story has often been compared to "Jane Eyre",
but the film's mood is very different.  Young
nurse Betsy (Frances Dee) takes a position in
Haiti, where she lives on a sugar plantation
run by unhappy, quarrelling half-brothers
Wesley (James Ellison) and Paul (Tom Conway).
Her patient is Jessica (Christine Gordon),
Wesley's lovely wife who is now in a zombie-like
trance.  With 'modern' medicine unable to cure
her, Jessica is taken by Betsy to the local
witch doctor, whose voodoo cult seems to dominate
the Haiti culture.</P>
<P>The romance between naive Betsy and gloomy Wesley
isn't quite convincing.  But while the leads aren't
interesting, the supporting characters certainly
are.  Paul is a bitter alcoholic, still in love
with Jessica and resentful towards Wesley, whom
he blames for her catatonic state.  Edith Barrett
plays the mother of Paul and Wesley, and her
character has the habit of suddenly appearing
at the most unexpected moments.</P>
<P>The eerie Black & White cinematography is credited
to J. Roy Hunt, who must have seen this film as
a major change of pace.  Calypso singer Sir Lancelot
has a cameo singing a chilling song about the
plantation owners (he would also appear in "Curse
of the Cat People" the following year).</P>
