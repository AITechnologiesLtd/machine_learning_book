<P>Anaconda is a challenging film to review, since little of any
substance appears on the screen. It is an intensely silly
picture that could probably be adequately discussed during
screening, without missing anything vital. I say this with
some assurance, since several movie patrons appeared to be
doing just that while watching. In fact, Anaconda, I think,
invites exactly that reaction.</P>
<P>According to Variety (I think it was), the end of April is
basically dead-time for the movie box-office - what with
people feeling impoverished over their tax returns and
such. The cruelest month is also the most financially
depressing for the studios, and has, to all appearances,
leveled off films like Volcano and everything else wedged
into the gap before the advent of big summer blockbusters
like Jurassic Park II. Anaconda, however, squeezes
comfortably into the early spring time slot. This film is not
for the ambitious movie-goer out to treat his (or her) eyes to
a piece of cinematic brilliance. No, this film is for the
recently defrosted slacker with five bucks burning a hole in
his (or her) pocket!</P>
<P>Considered formally, the film only has two things to offer:</P>
<P>    1.The black guy (Danny) doesn't get killed first! In fact,
       he survives the whole picture relatively intact.
    2.The chick (Terri) doesn't twist her ankle at all!</P>
<P>Other than that, things are pretty much as you'd expect. A
pretty stereotypical documentary crew goes out on the
Amazon with a snooty, British presenter to film some
mysterious natives. In a setup arranged by their captain,
they pick up a Paraguayan ex-priest (Sarone) who's really in
it for the big snakes. He incapacitates the film crew's leader
(Steven) and leads the gang down the wrong tributary -
with horrendous results! That's pretty much it. Why the
setup? Who knows!</P>
<P>The centerpiece of this movie is not, in fact, the 40 foot
snake, but rather Jon Voight and his B movie acting. He
sneers, smirks, slimes, and slouches across the screen,
delivering his silly lines with real gusto, and all in that
stupid accent! No matter how bad, no scene or bit of
dialogue receives anything less than all the over-acting it
deserves. Opposite him, Jennifer Lopez does a creditable job
of maintaining an air of solemnity (without panic) and
keeping a straight face. To Llosa's credit, I suppose, the
movie focuses on the interaction between these two
characters, leaving the snake on the sidelines for most of
the time. (Except for one or two sequences, the anaconda
itself seems like little more than an "innertube with an
attitude." <-- Note obligatory reviewer's wisecrack!) To
speak truthfully, their interplay is reminiscent of that
between Brody and Quint in Jaws, although, of course, the
outcome is never in doubt. Still, these two performances do
carry this admittedly lightweight film to its wisely
not-long-in-coming conclusion. There is something
admirable in keeping your head when all about you are
having theirs barfed up by a giant computer graphic.</P>
<P>Insofar as there is one, I suppose the moral is that if you
have five bucks and a taste for the ridiculous, then
Anaconda may well be for you. If you are also one of those
people who is repulsed by snakes, so much the better - you
might actually get a kick out of the reptilian sideshow. But
remember, the real reptile is that Sarone guy! Frankly, I
don't think I'd trust him at all, even out for a little gopher
hunt. He probably knows where there are some "real" gophers....
