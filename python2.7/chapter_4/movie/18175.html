<P>Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:</P>
<PRE>ENTRAPMENT</PRE>
<P>Sean Connery is an old thief who steals simply for the love of it;
Catherine Zeta-Jones is the insurance agent who wants to bust him wide
open during the heist of a much-adored Chinese mask.  However, as the
movie unfolds, there's many twists and turns to endure, some of which
come across more as puzzling rather than smart.</P>
<P>Still, the movie's got a bit of eclectic zip, thanks mostly to the
onscreen performances by the classy Connery and the delectably sexy
Zeta-Jones.  Ving Rhames doesn't really do much as a side character,
however- it would've been fun to see more of him in the act.  The story
has holes, but, for the most part, delivers the goods, and the heist
scenes are decent espionage fun.</P>
<P>The movie seems to fall apart in its final few minutes with TOO many
twists for its own good, but credit director Jon Amiel for at least
giving believability for a run for its money and for choosing, for the
most part, two actors just right for the lead roles.</P>
<PRE>RATING: 6 (out of 10)</PRE>
