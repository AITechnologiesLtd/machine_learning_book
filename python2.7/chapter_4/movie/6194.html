<P>     MICHAEL COLLINS is a perfect project for a collaboration between Neil
Jordan and Liam Neeson, two artists whose projects tend to inspire
background articles.  Jordan had everyone talking about _not_ talking
about his 1992 sleeper hit THE CRYING GAME, then inspired controversy when
he cast Tom Cruise as the amoral immortal Lestat in INTERVIEW WITH THE
VAMPIRE; Neeson has stepped into the shoes of enigmatic historical figures
(SCHINDLER'S LIST) and national heroes (ROB ROY).  They are in familiar
territory then with MICHAEL COLLINS, which has drawn the expected fire for
glorifying an ostensible terrorist and for playing fast and loose with
history.  Unfortunately, that controversy is almost more compelling than
the film itself, which proves that hero worship and drama can make
uncomfortable companions.</P>
<P>     Neeson plays the title role of Michael Collins, who is among the many
Irish nationalists arrested in the wake of the failed 1916 Easter uprising
against the imperial British rule.  After two years in prison, Collins
emerges convinced that conventional warfare has no chance of defeating the
British.  The alternative is a guerrilla campaign of bombings and
assassinations of British government operatives, and that is exactly what
Collins and his friend Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn) undertake.  Though
violent and destructive, the program eventually brings the British to the
bargaining table, but the result could be even more violent and
destructive.  A compromise agreement which divides the nation physically
also divides the nation politically, as Irish Republic president Eamon De
Valera (Alan Rickman) leads opposition to the agreement against Collins
and a government which has exchanged an external battle for an internal
one.</P>
<P>     Neil Jordan (who also wrote the screenplay) is clearly going out of
his way to paint Collins as an extraordinary figure in Irish history, as
well as to rationalize his extremism.  "I hate them for making hate
necessary" Collins says in one of several scenes where Jordan makes his
soul-searching known to us, and it is only because Liam Neeson can sell
such a line that it doesn't inspire eye-rolling.  Neeson  has exactly the
charisma and physical presence to be convincing as a nigh-mythical figure
known as "The Big Fella," but he also conveys a moral uncertainty.  He
plays Collins with intelligence, conviction and sadness, and it is more
thanks to Neeson than it is to Jordan that Collins emerges as an
intriguing character, a man of action forced to make an uneasy transition
to man of peace.</P>
<P>     MICHAEL COLLINS is usually a solid piece of drama when it focuses on
the political, with Alan Rickman providing a complex counterpart to
Collins as the more politically calculating De Valera.  Jordan sometimes
over-reaches in his portrayal of the British as faceless villains,
notably in a scene where an armored car opens fire on the crowd at a rugby
match, but generally he is able to maintain a tense adversarial triangle
of Collins, De Valera and the British.  His other triangle, however, is a
perplexing mistake, and highlights how awkward MICHAEL COLLINS becomes
whenever Jordan tries to show us Collins' softer side.  There is a lovely
lass named Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts, improving on her MARY REILLY
brogue) who comes between Collins and Harry Boland, and perhaps the schism
is intended to foreshadow the civil strife to come.  Still, there is
little heat between Neeson and Roberts, and the relationship is not
developed in any appreciable way.  When Jordan juxtaposes a series of
political murders with an idyllic bedroom scene between Collins and Kitty
a la the baptism sequence in THE GODFATHER, the scenes do not complement
one another; every cut back to the budding romance is simply a
distraction.</P>
<P>     Even though MICHAEL COLLINS manages to avoid ever using two of the
most critical words in the Irish conflict -- "Catholic" and "Protestant"
-- it still provides a strong overview of the pivotal years when the Irish
rebels realized that fighting dirty was the only option left to them.  it
is a good looking film with several fine performances (including Neil
Jordan regular Stephen Rea as an informant for Collins inside the British
government), but I don't think it ever pretends to be an objective
history.  MICHAEL COLLINS is meant to be a monument to an important figure
in Irish lore, and it does a fine job of making him a monument.  It is
when it tries to make him a man that it inspires the only artistic
controversy it deserves.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Gael forces:  7.</PRE>
