<P>To best enjoy "The Muse," you need to get into the proper state of mind. 
First, forget the blurbs from quote whores proclaiming the film 
"hilarious" and "a laugh riot." It isn't. "Amusing," "pleasant" and 
"generally enjoyable" would be more appropriate terms. Second, lower your 
expectations. Because comedian-writer-actor-director Albert Brooks ("Lost 
in America," "Defending Your Life," "Mother") is held in such high regard,
 people tend to forget that while even the slightest of his films 
contains moments of comic genius, there are always numerous dead spots as 
well, even in the best of his works. And "The Muse" is not Albert Brooks 
at his best.    </P>
<P>Directed and co-written by Brooks, this shaggy dog story is more low-key 
than his usual offerings, with many flat stretches. Still, there are 
rewards here, notably jabs at Hollywood mentality; well-placed cameos 
from Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Wolfgang Puck and others; Sharon 
Stone's fizzy performance in the title role; and, as always, the 
satisfaction of watching Brooks do wonderfully slow burns as his 
exasperation grows, building inevitably to deliciously juvenile outbursts.</P>
<P>This time around, Albert plays Steven Phillips, a screenwriter with 17 
scripts and an Oscar nomination to his credit. After receiving a 
humanitarian award at a gala dinner, with his wife Laura (Andie 
MacDowell) and young daughters watching in pride, he goes into the studio 
the next morning, only to have his world crash around him. A smarmy 
junior executive casually informs Steven that he has lost his edge. Not 
only is the studio rejecting his current script, it has decided to 
release him from his three-picture deal. </P>
<P>In a panic, Steven races to the home of friend and fellow writer Jack 
Warrick (Jeff Bridges) for counsel. Moved by Steven's desperation, Jack 
confides the secret of his success. He is a client of Sarah (Sharon 
Stone), a genuine, daughter-of-Zeus Muse. Muses inspire creativity and 
Sarah is a hot commodity in the film community. After considerable 
badgering, Jack finally sets up a meeting between Steven and Sarah. In 
short order, Steven has his own Muse who lives up to her billing, but 
provides nonstop headaches along with inspiration. </P>
<P>The concept is solid enough, but the execution falters. After a juicy 
opening, the story meanders and the aimless feel is enervating. The witty 
vignettes that pop up every few minutes are welcome, but they also 
underline the weakness of the main plotline. </P>
<P>Part of the problem is Brooks himself. The comic actor always plays self-
absorbed, self-pitying types (his film persona is essentially the West 
Coast equivalent of Woody Allen, minus the creepiness), but his Steven 
Phillips appears haggard and speaks in pessimistic terms even when things 
are going well.</P>
<P>While Brooks' zeal seems muted, he still delivers a number of sharp one-
liners, particularly during his temper tantrums. Albert is a master at 
reacting to annoying characters, and he gets some world-class irritants 
here. He has some terrific exchanges with an oily Paramount exec (Mark 
Feuerstein) and a European partygoer (Mario Opinato) who twists the 
English language like a Bavarian pretzel.</P>
<P>There is a lot of old-fashioned shtick in "The Muse," as celebrities pop 
up for cameos tweaking their own images. "Titanic" director James Cameron 
has a cute bit and Martin Scorsese is a riot, babbling like a hyperactive 
loon about his insane concept for a "Raging Bull" remake. </P>
<P>Comic vignettes aside, it's the women who keep the film going. Andie 
MacDowell gives one of her most likable performances to date as Laura 
Phillips, who starts realizing her own potential while spending time with 
the Muse. As Sarah the Muse, Sharon Stone proves quite adept at comedy, 
deftly creating a character who is at once demanding and ditzy. Stone is 
clearly having the time of her life playing such an off-beat type, and 
her enthusiasm is most appreciated.</P>
<P>If only the film had as much energy as Stone. It starts off strong and 
has a clever ending, but oh, does the midsection ever sag. Were I a Muse, 
I'd have strongly suggested that Brooks and his longtime writing partner 
Monica Johnson do another draft or two, because even the languidly paced 
"Mother" looks perky compared to this. </P>
<P>After watching "The Muse," I'm reminded of the scene in which Steven is 
told that, while his script is serviceable, it lacks edge. That is 
exactly the trouble with this movie. "The Muse" is amusing, pleasant and 
generally enjoyable, which would be enough for most filmmakers, but from 
someone of Albert Brooks' caliber, we have a right to expect more.</P>
