<PRE>DO THE RIGHT THING (1989)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Spike Lee
Starring: Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, John Turturro,
Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Bill Nunn, Samuel L.
Jackson, Frank Vincent, Miguel Sandoval, Rick Aiello, John Savage,
Martin Lawrence</P>
<P>It's kind of weird watching 1989's "Do the Right Thing" in 1997, cheifly
because it still holds up today.  Racism and bigotry seem to rule this
country, and this is what the film seems to say.  But what's amazing
about this film, other than the fact that it does it so well, is that it
is not preachy for a single second.</P>
<P>"Do the Right Thing" takes place in Brooklyn on the hottest day of the
year.  We are presented to a tiny microcosm of life, featuring all sorts
of different races and cultures.  Most are black, like the protagonist
Mookie (writer/director Spike Lee), the militant hothead Buggin' Out
(Giancarlo Esposito), the Goliath-like Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), the
slightly senile old "Da Mayor" (Ossie Davis), and the witch-like Mother
Sister (Ruby Dee).</P>
<P>But into this giant melting pot, we also get some korean store owners, a
couple whites here and there, the white racist cops (Miguel Sandoval and
Rick Aiello), some hispanics (like Mookie's girlfriend Tina, played by
none other than Rosie Perez, in her film debut), and of course, the
italian pizzeria owners.</P>
<P>The whole center of the place seems to be the pizzeria, "Sal's Famous,"
headed by, well, Sal (Danny Aiello), and also by his two sons, Pino and
Vito (John Turturro and Richard Edson, respectively), the former being a
racist who is constantly bitching about moving to the italiant
neighborhoods, and explaining that black people like Eddie Murphy are
"more than black."  Also working there as a delivery boy is Mookie.</P>
<P>Observing the whole film is the 12-hour radio guy, Mister Senor Love
Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson, cast as "Sam Jackson), who is constantly
making comments, including a long speech on thanking basically every
single black celebrity (although I don't remember hearing Rick James'
name being mentioned).</P>
<P>The film plays like a pot of boiling water, eventually bursting and
spilling over for a shocking and brilliant climax, and only being
cleaned up a bit in the ending.  For the first hour or so, we get the
daily lives kind of thing, which is nothing short of fascinating and
completely entertaining.  It seems that in one way or another, everyone
is a bit of a bigot or racist.  Even the innocent white guy who
accidentally makes bike skid marks on Buggin' Out's new Jordans ruins
his innocence by saying that they shouldn't beat him up because he was
born in Brooklyn.</P>
<P>The ending, as I said is brilliant, but also seems to be a precursor for
the whole Rodney King riots.  Not that it incited it in anyway, but just
seemed to prophesize what would happen since America has never really
been comfortable with its giant melting pot of cultures.  What's
remarkable is that it doesn't take sides at this event, where a lesser
film would have.</P>
<P>"Do the Right Thing" acts as an observer of life, and presents it in the
most responsible way.  There's almost no way to remedy this huge
problem, and the film presents no real way of curing it, other than that
"we should all just get along" (they don't say it in this film, by the
way).  Even in 1997, it's the most accurate display of racism in
America.</P>
<P>This was the first Spike Lee film I saw (I know, I know...), and it was
absolutely amazing.  Lee has an amazing knack for dialogue, and has the
same kind of giddy use with the camera that people like Quentin
Tarantino and Martin Scorsese have.  He wonderfully balances a huge
ensemble cast, with some standout performances from himself, Danny
Aiello, Ossie Davis, John Turturro, and Giancarlo Esposito (as well as
cameos from John Savage and Frank Vincent), and presents a world that is
never boring.</P>
<P>Also, look for Martin Lawrence in an early role as one of the many
inhabitants of the little mircrocosm.</P>
<P>"Do the Right Thing" is a wonderfully engaging film, filled with
brilliant satire, and a strong observation about a tumor in America
which has been here since it was created.  It's one of the best films of
the 80s, as well as one of the most important.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
