<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A stagy remake of the Chester Morris film "Blind Alley" (39). This is a
tense hostage-gangster film set in the 1940s, so the hoods wear fedoras
and business suits. It seems more like a play than a film, and that is
not surprising since it was originally a play.</P>
<P>Dr. Andrew Collins (Cobb) is a police psychologist in an unnamed big
city and when a young kid is arrested, Collins takes an interest in his
case. He tells the arresting officer that he can help if the kid is
given psychiatric help instead of a jail sentence, and maybe he can be
prevented from being a career criminal. His bleeding-heart liberal
attitude is not thought of much at present but in this film it seems to
be the voice of reason, as if criminal behavior can be explained away by
a bad environment and by getting counseling when in trouble. But to
convince the doubting detective who arrested the rough kid, Collins
tells him, via flashback, the episode he had with the notorious gangster
Al Walker (Holden).</P>
<P>At the time, Collins was a psychology professor in a small-town
university near the Canadian border and he was entertaining guests in
his isolated lakeside cabin retreat with his wife Ruth (Maxwell), while
their young son Bobby (Hyatt) was asleep in his room. The guests are
stockbroker Frank Stevens (Graff) and his wife Laura (Jergens) and her
male companion, a writer named Owen (Dunne). They hear on the radio
about the jail escape of the dangerous hood Walker, who in his escape
kills two guards and the warden.</P>
<P>Walker's gang heads for Collins' weekend retreat as his loyal
girlfriend, Betty (Foch), arranged for someone to come there that night
for their getaway by boat. They figure to wait there with the professor,
until their friend arrives with the boat. The gang consists of Walker's
two henchmen, Mike (Kroeger) and Pete (Osterloh).</P>
<P>Taking the Collins' and their friends and their two servants hostage,
Holden snarls and Cobb intently stares at him as they curiously confront
each other. They are only interrupted by Fred Linder (Geray), who is a
next-door neighbor and a college colleague of Collins'. He has repaired
Cobb's hunting gun for their hunting trip tomorrow and comes over with
the rifle, when he's also taken hostage.</P>
<P>Walker is impressed with the shrink's cool behavior and the two start
talking in earnest when Betty tells the shrink about the recurrent dream
that Walker is having, one that frightens him and causes him trouble
sleeping. The shrink says he might be able to help, if Walker is honest
with him about the dream. The shrink figures that the dream holds the
key to what motivates Walker's criminal behavior. It's all pop
psychology, but the actors are so serious about it that it's amusing to
hear them say their lines with a straight face. The symbols of the dream
are translated to mean that Walker had his abusive father killed when he
was a young boy by betraying him to the police and that everyone he now
kills, is his father again. To believe this film, you must swallow that
the shrink in the few hours spent with Walker cured him of ever killing
again. When the police surround the cabin Walker can't pull the trigger,
and he and his gang are captured. So I guess the shrink knew what he was
doing!</P>
<P>This is pure Hollywood hokum. Though, it is well-acted and is watchable.</P>
