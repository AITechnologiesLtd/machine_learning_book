<PRE>THE FRENCH CONNECTION
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The French Connection puts the majority of contemporary action movies to
shame.  It proves how potentially smart this genre can be, and how dumb
recent action films really are.  Unlike many modern-day thrillers, this
film is an exciting, taut, and realistic portrayal of urban police life,
but it does not fill its running time with gratuitous violence, nonstop
profanity, and copious amounts of sex.  Character motivation and story
drive the film forward--not a needless excess of violent, antisocial
behavior.  It's a standout cinematic achievement that won five Academy
Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Gene Hackman),
Best Film Editing, and Best Writing.</P>
<P>Ernest Tidyman's story follows the adventures of two New York narcotics
cops, "Popeye" Doyle (Hackman), and his partner, Russo (Roy Scheider). 
They track a lead about a large drug delivery that develops into a plan
that could entirely destroy the marijuana trade between Paris and New
York.</P>
<P>The movie contains convincing, memorable action sequences.  In an
unexpected, timely scene, Doyle walks down the street when suddenly a
sniper hiding on top of his apartment opens fire.  The sniper misses and
hits an innocent bystander.  Doyle finds cover behind a tree.  More
pedestrians rush to care for the injured victim.  Doyle tells them to
run.  This sequence convinces us that the threat of the sniper is real,
which leads us to one of the most thrilling chase scenes in film
history.</P>
<P>Most modern action scenes involve massive gunfire from both the good and
the bad.  It's almost as if the bullets have read the screenplay,
hitting their targets only at the plot's discretion.  The French
Connection gives us convincing situations without the plot contrivances
and predictable shoot-outs.  The story flows smoothly because everything
that happens is character driven.</P>
<P>Recent action movies contain special effects that make The French
Connection look like child's play.  Nowadays, a film can contain
enormous explosions, amazing car chases and crashes, impressive computer
generated images, and enough gunfire to impress the Army.  But it's not
the special effects that make The French Connection a true classic, it's
the quality of the performances, the enticing direction by William
Friedkin, the brilliant editing, and the intensity and selectivity of
the action sequences.  Today's filmmakers can throw almost anything into
their movies, but there's one thing that they often forget that The
French Connection hits right on the nose: action itself doesn't drive a
story forward, character does.  In today's world, that's almost a
novelty.</P>
