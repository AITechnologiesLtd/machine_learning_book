<P>Susan Granger's review of "TOY STORY 2" (Walt Disney Pictures)</P>
<P>   Among our many blessings this Thanksgiving, let us be
thankful for the astonishing, fun-filled Toy Story 2, the best
animated comedy sequel ever made. This magical, incredibly inventive
mix of action and humor continues, right where it left off, with the
gang ready to play in Andy's bedroom. Only, when Andy goes off to
Cowboy Camp, Woody gets left behind and is kidnapped by the greedy
owner of Al's Toy Barn. It seems Woody's a highly valuable collectible
from a 1950s TV show called Woody's Roundup. At Al's place, Woody
meets another family from his illustrious past - Jessie, the cowgirl;
Bullseye, the horse; and Stinky Pete, the Prospector. But, back in
Andy's house, Buzz Lightyear has recruited Mr. Potato Head, Slinky
Dog, Rex and Hamm for a rescue mission. Can his pals find Woody before
Andy comes home? And, will Woody want to come back to Andy's bedroom
now that he's discovered he's a prized museum piece?</P>
<P>  The original Toy Story was an international sensation, the
third highest grossing animated film of all time - behind The Lion
King and Aladdin.  Originally planned as a direct-to-video release,
this adventurous sequel reunites the same creative team, including
Pixar's John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, along with Tom Hanks, Tim
Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and
Annie Potts. New voices are Wayne Knight, Kelsey Grammer and Joan
Cusack, plus Little Mermaid Jodi Benson as Barbie. Composer Randy
Newman's "You've Got a Friend in Me" is reprised, along with new songs
"Woody's Roundup" and "When She Loved Me," sung by Sarah McLachlan On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Toy Story 2 is another knockout
10. Don't miss it - or, as Buzz Lightyear would say: "To infinity and
beyond!"</P>
