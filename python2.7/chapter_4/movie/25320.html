<P> The X-Men are not your normal kind of super heroes.</P>
<P> No, not because they are mutants. In a sense all comic book heroes who
possess one extraordinary power or another is a mutant.</P>
<P> It's because these men and women are like us; they have issues, they
squabble and sometimes get on each other's nerves.</P>
<P> And that is one of the charms of "X-Men," the long-anticipated movie
adaptation of one of Marvel Comics most popular franchises.</P>
<P> "X-Men" is a story of tolerance vs. intolerance, with echoes reaching
back to the Nazis' `final solution.'</P>
<P>  "X-Men" is set in the undefined, not-too-distant future. There is a
growing concern and paranoia in the United States, led by demagogue Sen.
Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) about the threat from mutants, people who
are freaks of nature, scientific oddities. Kelly is pushing legislation
making it mandatory that these people be registered.</P>
<P> In the background, quietly opposing Kelly are two camps. One is led by
Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most powerful
telepath, who runs a school for `gifted' students where they are taught
to control their powers and use them for good.
Xavier fights to protect the very people who hate and fear him and his
kind.</P>
<P> The other faction is run by Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto (Ian
McKellen). His answer is, if you can't lick ‘em, join ‘em. He and his
evil Brotherhood of Mutants, devise a diabolical plan that would force
humanity to accept them.</P>
<P> Director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects," "Apt Pupil"), who co-wrote
the story with Tom DeSanto, as well as screenwriter David Hayter, have
created a balanced plot that is equal special effects-mutant-vs.-mutant
WWF, knock-down-drag-'em-out battles, coupled with a human element, as
these gifted people learn to cope and accept their strange powers.</P>
<P> First, a mini-scorecard for those unfamiliar with X-Men, so you can
learn the various players.</P>
<P> The good guys, those aligned with Professor X, include: Cyclops, whose
eyes emit powerful energy beams; Storm, who can manipulate the weather;
and Jean Gray, a telepath who also has telekinetic powers.</P>
<P> Joining them are Wolverine, the surly loner with adamantium claws and
amazing healing powers who would rather fight than talk, and Rogue, a
sensitive teen-age girl who can absorb the powers and memories of anyone
she touches.</P>
<P> Opposing them is Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants, which includes the
animalistic Sabertooth; the blue-skinned metamorph Mystique and the
far-jumping, tongue-lashing Toad.</P>
<P> "X-Men" features a wry sense of humor. As the X-Men move out dressed in
their black, all-leather uniforms for their final confrontation with
their foes, Wolverine asks if they really wear these clothes in public.
To which Cyclops replies, `What would you prefer, yellow Spandex?'</P>
<P> Then there's the throw-away scene at Professor X's school in which we
see a group of youngsters playing basketball. One young lad with super
speed continually passes the ball to himself, making an easy lay-up. An
off-screen voice protests: `Hey, no fair, no superpowers allowed.'
I
 t's moments like these that confirm that Singer and his writers have
gotten it right. There's is one of the best comic book adaptations since
Tim Burton's original "Batman" movie.</P>
<P> The "X-Men" cast: Stewart is wise, gentle and authoritative as the
fatherly leader of this band of outsiders.</P>
<P> Hugh Jackman, another Australian hunk in the Russell Crowe mode, is
tenacious, tough and a bit tender as the ferocious Wolverine.</P>
<P> James Marsden plays Cyclops with a cool nonchalance and a quick sense
of humor.</P>
<P> Halle Berry is beautiful and tough as the no-nonsense Storm, while the
lovely Famke Janssen displays a firmness, dedication and intelligence as
Jean Gray.</P>
<P> Oscar-winner Anna Paquin ("The Piano") is vulnerable and
psychologically scarred as the alienated and confused Rogue.</P>
<P> The movie's one drawback is that the villainous mutants are not as
fully developed as their heroic counterparts. Thus, Tyler Mane mainly
roars and rends as Sabertooth; Rebecca Romjin-Stamos shape shifts as
Mystique, while Ray Park as Toad, gets to cut a wisecrack or two.</P>
<P> Only Ian McKellen as Magneto is drawn with any depth. His contempt for
humanity is understandable. He does what he feels is necessary not for
any really evil purpose, but as a method of survival.</P>
<P> "X-Men" will prove to be a hit, opening the door for a sequel or two or
three. Despite my cynicism about sequels, I wouldn't mind watching the
future adventures of these interesting heroes, if the writing is as
intelligent and sharp as this introductory adventure.</P>
<P> You need not be a comic book aficionado to enjoy "X-Men." It features
great visuals, an appropriate Michael Kamen score, lots of action and -
most of all - very interesting characters.</P>
<P> "X-Men" creator Stan Lee should be proud. His concept has been
successfully transferred from printed page to big screen with very few
compromises.</P>
