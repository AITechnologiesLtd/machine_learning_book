<P>     Quite a few recent North American imports of Australian films have 
been mediocre, feel-good comedies like HOTEL DE LOVE, COSI, and LOVE AND 
OTHER CATASTROPHES.  CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION, the latest offering 
from down under, is superior to its tepid '97 predecessors in several 
ways.  Not only is it based on a fairly original premise, but the humor 
exhibits a distinct edge.  </P>
<P>     The film starts out much like STRICTLY BALLROOM, with a faux 
documentary format that lapses into a more traditional narrative version 
of storytelling.  This style persists throughout the entire film, with 
talking head commentary and "archival footage" occasionally interrupting 
the flow.  The most biting wit comes during these "interviews," and 
first-time writer/director Peter Duncan's atypical approach allows the 
movie to end with a recursive twist.</P>
<P>     CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION opens in 1951 Sydney, where die-hard 
communist Joan Fraser (Judy Davis) is drumming up support to defeat a 
ballot referendum that would outlaw the party.  Joan's mantra, which she 
utters at every possible opportunity, is taken directly from Marx:  
"From each according to his capacity to each according to his means."  
One of her fellow communists, a conventional fellow named Zachary Welch 
(Geoffrey Rush), proposes marriage, but Joan refuses, claiming that 
she's not in love with him.</P>
<P>     Every week, she writes a new letter to her hero, Joseph Stalin (F. 
Murray Abraham).  When the dictator finally gets around to reading her 
missives, he is so touched by her enthusiasm that he arranges for her to 
visit Moscow for the 1952 Communist Party Conference.  There, on the 
night that Stalin dies, she sleeps with both him and an 
Australian/Russian double agent (or perhaps triple agent) named David 
Hoyle.  Nine months later, when Joan is back in Sydney and married to 
Zachary, she gives birth to a baby boy.  But is the child, Joe Welch 
(played by Ben McIver as a youngster; Richard Roxburgh as an adult), the 
offspring of Stalin or Hoyle?  </P>
<P>     Smartly written and adroitly developed, CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION 
fires verbal and visual volleys at multiple bullseyes, from communism 
and Stalin to the news media and McDonalds.  Not all of the satirical 
jabs hit their mark, but there are so many of them that most of the 
misses go unnoticed.  And several that do work are just short of 
brilliant.  One of the more absurd scenes, which calls to mind Mel 
Brooks' "Springtime for Hitler" (from THE PRODUCERS), has Stalin singing 
and dancing to "I Get a Kick Out of You".  There's also a sequence that 
details a "macabre and barbaric" means of breaking a hunger strike:  
blow the scent of sizzling bacon into the cell of the striking prisoner.  </P>
<P>     One testament to the strength of Duncan's film is the cast he was 
able to assemble.  International star Judy Davis is in fine form as 
Joan.  Geoffrey Rush, who just won a Best Actor Academy Award for SHINE, 
plays her husband.  Sam Neill is a dashing, debonair spy.  Rachel 
Griffiths (MURIEL'S WEDDING) is a sexy constable.  And Richard Roxburgh, 
a relative unknown with impressive range, is Joe, the possible son-of-
Stalin.</P>
<P>     If there's an obvious fault with CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION, it's 
that there's very little subtlety.  Some of the satire is broader than 
seems necessary.  And many of the parallels between Joe and Stalin (such 
as the dark, vault-like office where both of them "hold court") are 
rather obvious.  Nevertheless, there's enough solidly entertaining, 
occasionally thought-provoking material in the film to make it worth a 
trip to the theater.  The barbs directed at the manner in which the 
media disseminates information, while not as vicious as those delivered 
by Gus Van Sant's TO DIE FOR, are among the movie's strengths, and the 
aspects of political parody are universally comprehensible.  CHILDREN OF 
THE REVOLUTION uses a fresh approach to take aim at a broad range of 
targets, and the result is both decisive and incisive.</P>
