<P>I was talking with one of my reformed slacker friends about the movie scene
in Austin, when the subject of Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till
Dawn) came up.  "He's a great guy," I was told.  "We were pretty good
friends when we were both living in Austin."</P>
<P>I asked, "Is it true that he got the money to film El Mariachi at
Pharmaco?"  Pharmaco, by the way, is (or was, they've renamed it) a
pharmaceutical research company that pays impoverished University of Texas
students to serve as guinea pigs in drug research.</P>
<PRE>"Oh, yeah.  That's how I met him."</PRE>
<P>If you know that story, you probably know the one about how Harvey Keitel
got hold of the script for Reservoir Dogs and gave Quentin Tarantino a hand
in finding the money to shoot the film with real actors instead of his
video-store pals.  Stories like these are to Generation X what the story of
Lana Turner getting discovered at the soda fountain were to an earlier
generation.  Being an independent film director/producer/writer is today
what being a movie star was to kids in the Forties, or what being a rock
star was to kids in the Sixties.  It is the coolest thing you could ever
hope to be.  (This side of playing quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, of
course.)</P>
<P>The real legend of The Blair Witch Project has nothing to do with what may
or may not be lurking in the Maryland woods.  It has to do with novice
filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, and how they turned a few
thousand dollars and a few thousand feet of 16mm footage into the
multimillion dollar blockbuster that's got everyone talking this summer.
The story's familiar to anyone who's caught any part of the tremendous buzz
about this movie; directors Myrick and Sanchez recruited three actors,
equipped them with cameras and sent them into the woods for eight days with
little more than a promise that it might get a little scary for them alone
out there.  Combine this utterly unconventional approach to moviemaking
with the unprecedented positive word-of-mouth that the movie received on
the festival circuit and on the Internet, and it's the sort of story that
would make any aspiring wannabe director sick with envy.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project itself isn't as compelling as the story of how the
movie was made, but it's not far behind.  It's a taut, scary horror
thriller, one of the best of an increasingly bad lot of 1999 movies.  (It's
a bit too early to tap as an Oscar contender, but one wishes Oscar would
have a Rookie of the Year category.)</P>
<P>It begins in the most matter-of-fact way possible, with the now-famous
caption:  "In October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the
woods near Burkittesville, Maryland. One year later, their footage was
found."  And that's it.  No fancy opening sequence, no list of casting
directors or assistant executive producers, nothing to break the
verisimilitude that all this footage was shot by three kids wandering
around in the forest. (Which most of it was.)</P>
<P>The three kids are Heather, Josh, and Mike, played by Heather Donahue, Josh
Leonard, and Mike Williams.  They've checked out a couple of cameras and an
audio recorder from school, and they're on their way to the town of
Burkittesville (formerly Blair, we're told) to shoot some location scenes
for a documentary on the local legend, whatever it is.  One of the movie's
little conceits is that the trio carries two cameras for two different
purposes.  The actual scenes that they're going to use in the documentary
are shot in black-and-white on a 16mm movie camera.  They're also carrying
along some sort of color camcorder that they mostly use to goof off with.
So, the footage of Heather speaking to the camera in the town graveyard is
in black-and-white, and the footage of the cast relaxing in the
authentically cheesy motel room afterward is in color.</P>
<P>This conceit defines the look of the movie in three important ways.  First,
film from the two cameras is interwoven together, so the movie switches
back and forth from B&W to color more often than the shuttle bus that runs
between Kansas and Oz.  Since both cameras are hand-held most of the time,
the whole movie is herky- jerky enough to cause motion sickness in some
viewers.  And since cameras need light to operate, there are a lot of
scenes that take place either in total blackness or in the eerie glow of a
flashlight.</P>
<P>But the look of the movie isn't what you'll remember, isn't what will keep
you up until the wee hours of the morning.  The hyperbole about The Blair
Witch Project being the scariest movie ever aside, this is a movie that
will scare you.  It may not scare you sitting in the theater.  (Myself, I
didn't think I was all that scared, although it was comforting to have an
aisle seat just in case things got a little too scary.)  But there are
scenes that will stick in your memory, that will haunt you at odd moments
when you're alone in your car or trying to get to sleep or when you hear a
strange noise in the middle of the night.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project does not rely on surprise or gore, the two
mainstays of the Hollywood slasher movie.  Instead, it uses the rules of
the campfire ghost story.  Myrick and Sanchez know that fear is contagious,
and they scare their actors silly, knowing that they will transmit the fear
to each other and to the audience.  They also know that they don't need to
show a lot of really scary stuff in the movie, just set up a scary
situation and let the mind fill in the blanks.  (Next time you get the
chance to tell a ghost story at a campfire out in the woods to a group of
kids that hasn't seen the movie, tell the story of the Blair Witch and see
what happens.)</P>
<P>But The Blair Witch Project is more than just a spooky ghost story, thanks
to the work of actors Heather, Mike, and Josh.  There are some drawbacks to
their performance.  They're a bunch of Generation X twits, for one thing.
They wear plaid flannel shirts and whine and moan a lot.  Like Tarantino
characters, they seem to have only two modes of conversation, obscenity and
pop culture references.  ("Did you ever see Deliverance?" one of them asks
as they make their way into the woods.)</P>
<P>They're highly dependent on emotion.  As they wander through the woods with
only a compass, trying to figure out which direction civilization lies, one
of them asks, "How does east feel?"  The ordeal of being lost in the woods
drains them emotionally to the point that they have to stop walking and
have a good cry every once in a while.  (I kept imagining what would happen
if you placed the squad from Saving Private Ryan in a similar situation,
after Normandy, seeing piles of rocks and twigs might not be so bad.)</P>
<P>But these are minor quibbles.  The cast does a great, intense, powerful
job.  There's an unfakable genuineness and sincerity to their
performances.  We're not just being told that they're cold and hungry and
scared, we feel it along with them (the hungry part, especially, given how
much popcorn costs these days).   Their slow, linear descent into the
nether world of psychological disintegration is much scarier than the
things that go bump in the night.</P>
<P>Donahue is outstanding, taking a part that could have been nothing more
than a Jamie Lee Curtis scream queen role and taking it to the next level.
The movie's signature scene is hers, and her brittle, tense, unblinking
delivery will stay with you.  So will the last scenes of the movie, filmed
in this, um... well... place.... with this stuff everywhere... and... well,
I could describe it, but you'll want to see it for yourself without me
spoiling it.</P>
<P>One of the best things about The Blair Witch Project is that even though we
know (or think we know) that Josh, Heather and Mike are doomed, we're still
rooting for them all the way, hoping that they'll find their car and get
back home so Josh can call his girlfriend and so Heather can to turn in the
camera equipment on time.  And as we root for them, we're also rooting for
Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the young geniuses who started with
nothing but managed to spin straw (and twigs, and rocks, and slime) into
gold.  Box office aside, the real success of The Blair Witch Project will
be the hope and inspiration it will give to the next generation of
filmmakers, actors, and screenwriters seeking to become the coolest thing
you can ever hope to be.</P>

<P>"So how does a conservative movie reviewer, who doesn't want to spoil
the movie, write a review? The same way he takes the lamb chop from
rottweiller -- carefully. Another way is to fill two-thirds of the
column with irrelevant woolgathering about other topics so that you
only have room for a paragraph for the real review."  -- Jonah Goldberg</P>
