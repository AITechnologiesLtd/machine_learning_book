"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>It seems there are three routes a film can take if said picture is a
whimsical, ninety-minute comedy set in the British Isles.  There's the
Full Monty course, which leads to critical acclaim, multiple Oscar
nominations and a healthy box office take.  There's the Waking Ned
Devine path, which results in mixed reviews but fantastic audience
response and strong word of mouth.  And, of course, there is least
desirable road previously traveled by The Matchmaker, which was widely
panned and even more widely unseen.</P>
<P>The Closer You Get has elements of each of these films – it's produced
by Monty's Uberto Pasolini, set in a wee Irish town like Devine, and its
romantic theme is similar to that of The Matchmaker.  And like the other
three, Closer's story is an unbelievably lightweight but somewhat
charming fable.  But in terms of overall execution, the picture ends up
taking the unfortunate route of The Matchmaker. It's not bad, but the
film definitely seems amateurish (it's the first for director Aileen
Ritchie and screenwriter William Ivory).</P>
<P>Set in the Irish coastal town of Donegal, Closer is narrated by a
teenager named Sean (Sean McDonagh, in his film debut).  A dead-ringer
for American Pie's Jason Biggs (he even asks a friend what sex feels
like, but doesn't actually assault any pastries), Sean tells the viewers
how tired he is of taking the rowboat into town, drinking at the pub and
then rowing home every night.  His repetitive exploits mimic the daily
grind of every other single man in Donegal, including butcher Kieran
O'Donnell (Ian Hart, The End of the Affair), sheep farmer Ian O'Donnell
(Sean McGinley, The General) and rubber-valve fetishist Ollie (Pat
Shortt).</P>
<P>One night, these lads cook up a crazy, alcohol-fueled idea – place a
personal ad in the Miami Herald and entice hot American babes to
accompany them to their town's annual St. Martha's Day dance, and
presumably much, much more (read: hot Irish luvin').  Their crass ad
targets fit and trim women between the ages of twenty and twenty-one who
seek outdoorsmen with an ample supply of meats and fish.  Basically,
they have a better chance of find a winning lottery ticket in the hand
of a local dead man.</P>
<P>When the women in Donegal learn of the men's scheme, they become
understandably upset, but that doesn't stop the chaps from venturing
into previously unknown realms of hygiene, haircuts, fitness and heavy
oyster consumption.  Of course, at the end, most of the men predictably
end up paired with local gals, despite their wish for broads from
abroad.  Toward Closer's end, a character explains that `Sometimes the
closer you get to something, the further away it seems.'  I think the
driver's side mirror on my car imparts the same sort of wisdom.</P>
<P>The whole thing plays out like an extra-long episode of television's
Emmy Award-winning Northern Exposure, with its far-fetched plot and a
zany cast of isolated small-town irregulars.  Like NX, characters
include `the woman that runs the grocery store/post office' (Ruth
McCabe, Circle of Friends), `the cute local girl' (Cathleen Bradley, in
her film debut), `the guy that runs the business where everyone hangs
out' (Ewan Stewart, Titanic), and even `the guy with the leather jacket
and long black hair' (Pat Laffan).</P>
<P>Speaking of hair, Hart is almost unrecognizable (again…I'm not even sure
what he's supposed to look like at this point) and has a strange, floppy
hair-do like Gary Oldman from The Fifth Element.  Then, to prepare for
the onslaught of American beauties, Hart's Kieran bleaches his locks,
which makes him look like a cross between Oldman and rock ‘n' roll ghoul
Johnny Winter.  Even though this butcher runs around singing the
Bernstein/Sondheim hit `America' and is constantly readjusting his meats
(the bits in his pants, not in his shop's display case), you know he's a
perfect match for his lovely co-worker Siobhan (Bradley).  The ending is
even more predictable than Rachel Portman's (recent Oscar nominee for
The Cider House Rules) repetitive score.</P>
<P>1:30 - PG-13 for adult language and some sexual content</P>
