<P>     SCARY MOVIE's least obvious joke -- and this is a film that never met
an obvious joke it wasn't willing to beat to a slow, bloody death -- is
its title. SCREAM, one of the 1990s horror films that inspired this genre
parody, went into production with the working title of ... SCARY MOVIE. 
SCARY MOVIE, on the other hand, went into production with the working
title SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST HALLOWEEN. That title may have
rolled off the tongue slightly easier than that of Shawn and Marlon
Wayans' previous genre parody, DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE
DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD, but that ain't saying much. These
particular members of the Wayans clan seem singularly fond of spelling out
not just the general type of film they're sending up, but each and every
individual film they're going to acknowledge within that send-up.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure whether the entire concept of scattershot genre parody
is beyond my appreciation at this point, or whether SCARY MOVIE simply
made me feel like that was the case. I do know that it ended up making me
cringe more often than it made me laugh. The set-up involves a group of
high school students reacting to the murder of one of their classmates
(Carmen Electra). Virginal heroine Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) wonders
whether the killing may be related to an accident the previous year, in
which Cindy and several friends hit a pedestrian in their car and disposed
of the body. Her friends pooh-pooh the idea, but one by one they begin
dying terrible deaths with very familiar m.o.'s. Who will be next? Cindy's
sexually frustrated boyfriend Bobby (Jon Abrahams)? Her best friends
Brenda (Regina Hall) and Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth), and their boyfriends
Ray (Shawn Wayans) and Greg (Lochlyn Munro)? Or maybe Buffy's "slow" 
brother and honorary deputy Doofy (Dave Sheridan).</P>
<P>     As much as SCARY MOVIE owes to the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team in its
basic structure, it may owe even more to the Farrelly brothers. Simply
put, this is as breathtakingly crude and tasteless a film as you'll see
without going into the curtained-off area of your local video store. It's
not that some of the crude sight gags aren't funny; a few of them are 
worth big embarrassed chuckles. Unfortunately, far more are either lazy or
get really old really fast. SCARY MOVIE boasts not one, not two, but three
flatulence jokes, in addition to not one, not two, not three, etc. but at
least half a dozen oral sex jokes. And that's saying nothing of the entire
GLAAD protest's worth of cheap sexual orientation gags. I suspect the
Wayans Brothers know their audience well enough to know that nothing will
get the guffaws going better than an effeminate football player, or a
butch girls' gym teacher, or a forest of overgrown pubic hair. I also know
I've rarely felt as pandered to for so little playful pay-off.</P>
<P>     When the Wayans' finally do turn their attention to gags with
specific reference points -- the SCREAM trilogy, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST
SUMMER, even an improbable nod to THE USUAL SUSPECTS -- their batting
average doesn't improve much. Inevitably at least a few gags are going to
hit, most of which involve the pre-title attack on Electra. Others are
seemingly obligatory swipes at already-tired targets like THE SIXTH
SENSE's "I see dead people" line, TITANIC's "king of the world" line, 
Heather's confession in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the ubiquitous
"Wassup" guys from the Budweiser ads. There's rarely any confusion over
the source of any referential gag, because director Keenen Ivory Wayans
will usually let a scene run on for two or three minutes of set-up before
ever getting to the punch line. A film like this has to jab and move,
letting its gags stand or fall without someone pointing to them and
shouting, "Hey, isn't _that_ funny?"</P>
<P>     Before SCARY MOVIE's release, several critics wondered aloud how it
could satirize a film that was itself a satire of other films. The
premise wasn't entirely accurate, since SCREAM was always a horror film
itself, albeit a deconstruction of horror films within the genre. SCARY
MOVIE's problem isn't that it tries to do things SCREAM already did
better, but that it's not funny enough often enough. Perhaps if more of
the humor had hovered around the margins (like the labels on a restroom
condom machine) instead of over-staying its welcome (like the fate of a
talkative movie theater patron), SCARY MOVIE could have felt less like a
marketing hook in search of some actual comedy. It doesn't take much
creativity or wit to nudge an audience with pop culture references. It
just takes naming your film something obvious like SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT
I DID LAST HALLOWEEN.</P>
