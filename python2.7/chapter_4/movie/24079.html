<P>_Black_and_White_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>_Ghost_Dog:_The_Way_of_the_Samurai_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Earlier this week, the _Los_Angeles_Times_ ran a story on how "hip-hop
aesthetic" has moved beyond the traditional cinematic barriers of urban
crime movies and into the work of established white filmmakers, as seen
in two films, _Black_and_White_ and _Ghost_Dog:_The_Way_of_the_Samurai_. 
Aside from that shared sensibility, however, the two films could not be
more different--in intent and quality.</P>
<P>The trailers for James Toback's _Black_and_White_ make it look like a
run-of-the-mill 'hood drama, but Toback has a deeper concern in mind.  As
the title suggests, his film wants to explore the relations between
blacks and whites, namely the influence of hip-hop culture on white
youths--this issue in addition to telling a crime story as a hook.  His
intention is noble, but it's in Toback's execution that he manages to
fail in everything he sets out to do.</P>
<P>Toback makes a fundamental miscalculation in his exploration of
hip-hop-influenced white kids.  While he does stick with a fairly large
core of characters (played by Bijou Phillips, William Lee Scott, Elijah
Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, and Eddie K. Thomas) as they are followed by a
filmmaker (Brooke Shields) doing a documentary on the subject, the focus
of this group is narrow.  The two characters that are given the most
attention--the ones played by Phillips, Scott, and Thomas--are from
wealthy families, and while they say otherwise, it's too easy to read
their embrace of hip-hop culture as an act of rebellion against their
strict parents.  Where are the hip-hop-loving white kids from
lower-income families, the ones who can best relate to rap's common theme
of the ghetto life?</P>
<P>Toback has slightly better luck with the more traditional
cops-and-crooks plot thread, which served as the main selling point in
the trailer.  A college hoops star (Allan Houston of the New York Knicks)
gets caught accepting a bribe to throw a game, and the only way he can
get himself off the hook is to rat out a childhood friend (Power), a
gangsta with aspirations in rap music.  Ben Stiller, as the police
detective on the case, gives the story a manic urgency that it would not
otherwise have, for the inexperience of two other key players--Houston
and Claudia Schiffer, who plays his girlfriend--shows up too clearly on
the screen.  But better performances would not be able to offset the
story's unsatisfying resolution.</P>
<P>Similarly, some smaller pleasures to be found in _Black_and_White_
cannot justify the excess baggage that comes with them.  The
much-discussed, and indeed memorable, mid-film scene between Robert
Downey Jr. (playing Shields' gay husband) and Mike Tyson (playing
himself) isn't worth having to sit through Downey's indulgent theatrics
the rest of the way--especially in the woeful climactic scene between him
and an even worse Shields.  Throwaway cameos, from everyone from Method
Man to Brett Ratner, provide fleeting interest but don't add much to the
mix aside from clutter--which contributes to how one most easily
remembers _Black_and_White_ as being: a mess.</P>
<P>The plot of Jim Jarmusch's _Ghost_Dog_ could easily be ripped from a
standard urban crime film: a hitman (Forest Whitaker, superbly subtle)
working for the mob has his employer turn on him when a hit goes awry. 
But this being a Jarmusch film, there has to be an idiosyncratic twist,
and here it is the hitman's philosophy of living by the code of the
samurai.  Instead of being a quirky gimmick, this character trait
enhances the film, turning what could be an average pulpy yarn into
something at once more solemn and exciting to watch: a poetic meditation
on mortality and honor that delivers the action and suspense of any good
gangster film--all set to a moody rap score (by RZA).  </P>
<P>Unlike _Black_and_White_, which is content to adhere to hip-hop's common
perception--that is, being brash and in-your-face--_Ghost_Dog_ is more
interested in exploring the additional possibilities of the aesthetic's
use.  While that alone doesn't make Jarmusch's film more effective, it
certainly is a major reason why.</P>
