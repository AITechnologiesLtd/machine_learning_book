<P>Synopsis: In the midst of the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Sheen) is 
ordered to travel upriver into Cambodia in search of Colonel Walter Kurtz 
(Brando), who went AWOL and fled into the jungle. En route, Willard is 
witness to many of the horrors the war has wrought upon the countryside, 
and upon the men and women brought in to wage it.</P>
<P>Review: Few movies are so shattering as "Apocalypse Now". It tells of a
journey up a river, but in reality it is a journey into the very heart of 
madness. Each stop is more evidence of this: a colonel obsessed with 
surfing, an attack on the boat not with gunfire but with arrows and 
spears, a final American outpost manned by soldiers long since descended 
into insanity. And it all ends with Kurtz, raising a kingdom of the mad in 
the midst of the jungle, who does not just recognise the insanity of war, 
is not just a victim of it, but who thrives upon it. Sheen and Brando are 
outstanding. One plays a steely professional, the other a philosophical 
monomaniac, but both are crazy in their own way. "Apocalypse Now Redux" 
extends the lengthy film by about forty minutes, if anything accentuating 
the dreamlike atmosphere of the narrative. Some new scenes work, like a 
delirious second encounter with the Playboy bunnies and extra commentary 
by Kurtz. But the longest new segment, set at a French plantation house, 
jars us out of the rhythm of the story; even the hypnotic incidental music 
becomes trite and inappropriate. When I first saw "Apocalypse Now", I was 
unsure whether I truly liked it, but my appreciation for Coppola's triumph 
has only increased in the intervening years. "Redux" is not a stronger 
film, but it is a no less effective and mesmerising cinematic experience.</P>
