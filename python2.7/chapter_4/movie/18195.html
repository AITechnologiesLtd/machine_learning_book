<P>_William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_ (PG-13) ***</P>
<P>The assembled talents of an all-star cast are exploited most delightfully
in Michael Hoffman's adaptation of
_William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_.   While as sunny and
sweet as the Bard's original romantic comedy of errors, this update isn't
always dreamy, but its classic romantic spell should leave moviegoers
swooning.</P>
<P>The "dream" of the title is actually one very real night in the forest
where lovers are star-crossed, criss-crossed, or just plain made cross,
thanks to the magical machinations of Oberon (Rupert Everett), the King of
Fairies; and his impish right-hand sprite, Puck (Stanley Tucci).  Into the
forest that night come the hopelessly besotted Lysander (Dominic West) and
Hermia (Anna Friel), the latter of whom is lovelessly betrothed to
Demetrius (Christian Bale), who, in turn, is pursued, however clumsily, by
the unloved-by-anyone Helena (Calista Flockhart).  A few drops of a
flower's magical juice later, and a bewildered Helena finds herself the
object of desire for both Demetrius and Lysander, leaving Hermia by the
wayside.  The juice is indeed loose, for also falling under its power is
Oberon's wife Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes enamored of an
ass--literally and figuratively.  His apt name is Nick Bottom (Kevin
Kline), a pompous ham of an actor who is transformed into a
half-man/half-donkey monstrosity by a playful Puck.</P>
<P>This section, being the part that gives the play its title, is the focal
point of the play and the film, but, strangely enough, it's also the part
that works the least well in the film.  Of course, it has nothing to do
with the parent text; Shakespeare's timeless barbs (mostly delivered by a
comically cruel Lysander to a disbelieving Hermia) would never lose their
edge in any translation. Neither are the actors at fault; they are all up
to the Shakespearean task.  The biggest revelation is Flockhart, who
displays exquisite comic timing as the very un-Ally Helena.  What is at
fault, is Hoffman's staging, or, rather, his stage.  This entire second act
was filmed on a soundstage, and it shows: the backdrops are flat; the same
tree sets are recycled over and over again; and--most distracting of
all--it's ridiculously overlit (it may be midsummer, but it still is
_night_).  A certain level of unreality should be brought to this
section--we are dealing with fairies and man-asses here--but it's one thing
to be unreal (as in a fantasy) and entirely another to appear artificial
(as in synthetic).</P>
<P>Hoffman has better luck with other directorial choices.  Most notable is
his change of setting from ancient Greece to 19th Century Italy, and this
adds a fresh new dimension to the material: fresh locations, fresh costumes
(no tights!), and, most notably, the advent of the bicycle, which adds some
needed movement to static scenes.  Hoffman also doesn't force fake British
accents upon his non-Brit stars (Pfeiffer, Flockhart, Kline, Tucci, David
Strathairn, and Sophie Marceau), sparing them and the audience a Kevin
Costner-as-Robin Hood-type embarrassment that would only distract from the
poetry of Shakespeare's words.</P>
<P>It is the timeless appeal of those words, the impassioned performances,
and a bring-down-the-house third act (in which Bottom and his inept troupe
of actors put on a hilariously disastrous play) that make this
high-spirited, if a bit overlong (115 minutes), production live up to its
title: a dream indeed--not without its fuzzy areas, but on the whole "a
most rare vision."  (opens May 14)</P>
