<P>It could have been a summer hit; perhaps the beginning of a
much-needed franchise for Universal Pictures. The
superheroes-without-superpowers storyline seemed to appeal to all of
us underachieving Americans. So where did "Mystery Men" go wrong? In
my opinion, at almost every turn. "Mystery Men" is the story of 7
self-made-heroes out to fight supervillain Cassanova
Frankenstein(Geoffrey Rush) in order to get back their real superhero,
Captain Amazing(Greg Kinnear). The film is supposed to be a mockery of
comic-book action franchises, but the jokes just aren't funny at
all. The only real high-notes in an "all-star" cast(which includes
Paul Reubens a.k.a Pee Wee Herman) are Ben Stiller and Janeane
Garofalo, who each have the talent to make any line into a sardonic,
cynical catchphrase. While the film's basic idea sounds like fun,
"Mystery Men" is actually somewhat of a bore thanks to Neil Cuthbert's
one-note script and Kinka Usher's wannabe-hip-and-stylish
direction. Even as a comedy sketch, there wouldn't be much to "Mystery
Men", so why torture us with a feature film? "Mystery Men" also
disappointed at the box office, so thankfully, no sequel is being
planned.</P>
