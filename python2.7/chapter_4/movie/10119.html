<PRE>Scream 2 (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Rushed into production mere months after the release of the blockbuster
original, Scream 2 appears, in theory, to be no different than the quickie
slasher sequels it lampoons.  But Wes Craven's smart, self-referential
Scream was unlike any other splatterfest, and now that film has developed
into a most intriguing and unconventional horror franchise with the release
of this followup--an exciting and wonderfully witty romp that manages to
add some luster to the much-maligned concept of "sequel."</P>
<P>Scream 2 is an even more satiric film than its predecessor, and this tone
is established quickly with the opening scene.  Windsor College students
Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett) and Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend a sneak
preview of the new horror movie Stab, which, as it turns out, is based on
the Windsboro, California murder spree depicted in the original film.  So
we see a hilariously letter-perfect recreation of Scream's now-classic
prologue, with a short-wigged Heather Graham assuming Drew Barrymore's role
as a Jiffy Pop-making blonde being terrorized over the phone by a
movie-obsessed psycho.  The restaging of the scene in and of itself would
be sufficiently satiric for most writers, but screenwriter Kevin Williamson
(who also penned the original) goes the extra mile, having Maureen vocally
mock its conventions ("Star-69 his ass!").  As smart and fun as Scream was,
it certainly had its share of cheesy aspects, and it is refreshing--not to
mention surprising and brave--to see Williamson and Craven poke fun at
their original film to such mercilessly hilarious effect.  This
movie-based-on-the-first-movie-within-its-sequel conceit, which is
revisited sporadically throughout the film (a highlight is Owen Wilson's
dead-on impresonation of Skeet Ulrich's slacker "cool" in a later scene),
perfectly embodies Scream 2's overall attitude--self-aware and more than
willing to make fun of itself.</P>
<P>Two years have passed since the Woodsboro murders, and heroine Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a theatre major at Windsor, and film geek
Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) is--natch--a film student there (you would
think he would be rejected, given his extensive qualifications).  Yet while
the scenery and atmosphere around her are different, her luck is not, and
before long she once again finds herself stalked by a killer in a screaming
ghoul costume.  Soon reentering the picture are ever-vain tabloid TV
reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who is even more of an egomaniac
after writing a bestseller on the murders (upon which Stab is based); and
ever-dopey Dewey Riley (David Arquette), now-former Woodsboro deputy, who
comes to Windsor to offer Sidney some support.  The rest of Scream 2's
story has been a closely guarded secret, and Dimension Films has gone so
far as to issue a letter urging press to not divulge too many plot
developments.  After seeing the film, it is easy to understand why.  While
the film does settle into a none-too-surprising slasher rhythm, Williamson
cooks up a few surprising plot twists, intelligently incorporating
references to the original to propel the sequel's storyline.  Also, true to
"the rules" of a sequel, he and Craven cook up some elaborately inventive
suspense scenes that set the audience on edge.</P>
<P>As effective as the new scare scenes are, there is no shock sequence in
Scream 2 that matches the original film's chilling prologue, but that is of
little consequence when its humorous side--what makes the Scream movies so
special--is stronger than ever.  Amid all the carnage and screaming,
Williamson and Craven's wit is as sharp as ever, giving dim Dewey overdone
"cool" theme music (directly lifted from Hans Zimmer's score for John Woo's
Broken Arrow) and throwing in barbs at everything from pop culture fixtures
like Sandra Bullock and TV's Friends to "issues" such as the influence of
violent movies and African-Americans' traditional non-presence in horror
movies.  But, of course, the most recurring topic is that of movie sequels.
 Simply bashing them (which the film does to ample degree) is easy, but
Williamson and Craven are a bit more ambitious--attacking their inherent
cheesiness while at the same time embracing it, steering events in some
quintessentially "only in a sequel" turns with tongue planted firmly in cheek.</P>
<P>An ongoing discussion in Scream 2 revolves around whether or not there
has been a movie sequel that is superior to the original.  I would not be
surprised if in Scream 3 (which is all but a foregone conclusion at this
point), we hear the fresh, funny, and frightening Scream 2 mentioned as
proof in the positive.</P>
