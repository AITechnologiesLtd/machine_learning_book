<P>     THE LONG DAY CLOSES is a film that takes several months in the
life of Bud (Leigh McCormack), a twelve year old boy growing up in 1956
Liverpool, and gives us a series of glimpses into some of the most
ordinary, everyday moments that occur.  This is a movie without plot
and with precious little characterization.  It moves along at a snail's
pace, progressively losing more and more of the audience as it becomes
apparent that absolutely nothing is going to happen.</P>
<P>     THE LONG DAY CLOSES is very much the visual equivalent of a verse
or a poem: beautiful images, but no narrative (that's not to imply
that poems often don't have deeper meanings).  This movie is a visual
feast and a cinematographer's dream, but for the average movie-goer,
eighty-three minutes of odd camera-angles and interesting shots is too
much.</P>
<P>     The audience at the showing I attended numbered about twenty at
the start of the film.  By the end, it was down to about fifteen.
Personally, I don't think the movie was bad enough to walk out on, but
I can understand why those who left did so.  Movies can survive without
coherent stories if they have solid, three-dimensional characters.  THE
LONG DAY CLOSES has neither and, as a result, ends up being an
overly-long bore.  Numerous opportunities for character development are
left dangling, and we're forced to watch a bunch of people we never get
to feel for.  Even Bud, who's in nearly every scene, is flat and
uninteresting.</P>
<P>     Supposedly, Terence Davies has filmed his childhood memories.
That's an interesting notion, and in the context of the movie, it's
easy to see how this could be the case- a great deal of attention is
paid to the smallest details.  Unfortunately, except in unusual
circumstances, the mundane recollections of a person aren't the kinds
of cinematic gems designed to captivate an audience.  There are a few
incidents in THE LONG DAY CLOSES that briefly caught my attention, but
they couldn't hold it.  On those rare occasions when the film managed
to strike a responsive chord within me, it let the opportunity slip
away.  Then it was back to staring at meaningless images on the screen
again.</P>
<P>     I can't recommend THE LONG DAY CLOSES to any but the most devout
art film students and die-hard lovers of unusual cinematography.  For
anyone else that happens to see this movie, they will likely find the
title a fitting one.  After getting out of the theater, it will
certainly seem like it's been a long day.</P>
