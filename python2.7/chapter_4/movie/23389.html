<P>   The 16th Century French writer Henri Estienne once said
"Dieu mesure le froid a la brebis tondue," which translates
as "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."  Similarly,
Mahatma Gandhi insisted in the last century that God
reserves a special spot in His heart for the untouchables,
whom he called harijan--children of God.  Does the
Almighty really retain a special rank for those who through
no fault of their own suffer great misfortune?  That notion
is tested severely in Majid Majidi's "Color or Paradise," a
cinematically glorious, emotionally heartwrenching film that
deserves the accolades it garnered at the New York and
Toronto film festivals.  Majidi follows up on his big box
office success "Children of Heaven," his 1997 tale of a
young boy trying to replace his sister's pink shoes, a movie
showing the importance of family and honor which became
Iran's first Oscar contender for Best Foreign Language
film.  His current work centers like that one on an eight-
year-old boy--this time on one who cannot yet believe that
he is one of God's chosen.  Blind since birth, young
Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani) attends a school for the
sightless in Tehran, but when the three-months' summer
vacation begins, he rightly suspects that his father,
Hashem (Hossein Mahjoub), would like to discard him.</P>
<P>   Majidi is not unlike Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the French
philosopher who in his "Emile" extolled children as
creatures of nature, uncorrupted by the complexities of the
world including its politics, hatreds, and other evils.  Early
on, we wonder though about Mohammad.  As he awaits
his father, he wanders about the school grounds, hissing
away a cat and even throwing a rock to scare the feline
animal away for good.  But we see why.  Using his acute
sense of hearing (presumably one of God's ways of
tempering the handicap of sightlessness), Mohammad
feels about the ground until he discovers a young chick
that had fallen out of his nest.  Climbing a tree with great
difficulty, he lovingly replaces the bird in his home.</P>
<P>   Majidi's attention shifts regularly from the boy to his
father, a self-pitying, middle-aged coal worker in northern
Iran who lives with his aging mother and his two young,
cheerful daughters.  At one point during a rainstorm, he
whimpers and cries out to Granny (Salime Feizi),
wondering about the very existence of God--who has made
him a widower and has given him a handicapped son.  We
discover later on that Hashem's dilemma is not that he is
unable to take care of the boy but that the child's existence
could threaten his proposed marriage to a much younger
woman (Masoomeh Zeinati), whose own father looks to a
future in which his daughter would be burdened with the
care of an old and sickly husband.</P>
<P>   Mohammad, then, despite his blindness and his
desolation at the thought that nobody loves him because of
his condition, lives in a happier world than his father. 
Attuned to nature, Mohammad joyfully witnesses the
sounds of woodpeckers in the forest chipping away at
trees in much the way that the local blind carpenter
(Morteza Fatemi) sculpts with his wood.  He glories in the
song of the seagulls which dart about among the rapids of
the starkly beautiful hilltops of the northern countryside
while his grandma, who shares the simplicity of rural life,
returns a trapped fish to deeper waters just as her
grandson had saved the life of a little bird.</P>
<P>   While Majidi's 1997 "Children of Heaven" was filmed
exclusively in Tehran, the writer-director opens us to the
glories of nature in his present work, featuring the rushing
rapids of the local river, the mist that forms among the
many hills, the land which seems removed by centuries
from the dust and traffic and commerce of the capital city. 
The final moment is a quiet blockbuster, if you will,
vindicating the story that leads up to a striking image. 
"Color of Paradise" lets us know in this painfully exquisite
labor of love that we may doubt God's existence from time
to time given the many tragedies that befall us, but when
the chips are down, we know that He is with us.</P>
