<P>People are suckers for foreign accents. It doesn't matter what someone is
saying, as long as they have that accent, people will listen until the cows
come home. For that reason alone, THE MATCHMAKER captivates us, but were it
just another small town middle America flick, the small but bewitching amount
of magic this film possesses would be completely lost.</P>
<P>Janeane Garofalo takes on her usual cynical persona, this time as Marcy
Tizard, campaign aide for dim-witted senator, John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders).
It's re-election time and McGlory is behind, so in an attempt to garner some
votes out of good human interest, McGlory sends Marcy to Ireland to track down
some McGlory ancestry. Absolutely anything but delighted, Marcy travels
overseas to the remote Irish town of Ballinagra. It just so happens that Marcy
is arriving smack dab in the middle of the annual Matchmaker Festival, where
the local cupid, an older gentlemen by the name of Dermot (Milo O'Shea), uses
his knack for diagnosing compatibility to put together the singles of the
town.</P>
<P>The festival becomes a distraction for Marcy, who's already having a hard
enough time with the transition from Boston to a town functioning on
simplicity. Her aggravation is only enhanced by her slightly-larger-than-a-
closet hotel room and the annoying Sean (David O'Hara), a writer who resides a
few rooms down the hall, helps himself to Marcy's bathtub, and owns a luggage
desecrating dog. Despite the inaugural friction, Dermot sees real potential
between Marcy and Sean and begins a plot to put them together, especially when
motivated by his main competitor's doubts (and handsome wager).</P>
<P>For being a romantic comedy, there sure is a low amount of romance. It's not
that watching the characters interact isn't fun, but there seems to be a
deprived sense of development *between* the characters. Everyone is charming,
especially O'Shea as Dermot, but nobody is introduced beyond their initial
stages. We don't really get to know any of the characters better by the end.
We don't really see them go thru much of a change, and, unfortunately for this
film, that's what stories are all about. Even Garofalo, whom I highly admire
as one of my favorite modern female actresses, seems a bit dispassionate about
her appearance here.</P>
<P>This is a film that will be loved because, like Ballinagra, it's simplistic
and sincere almost to a point of naivety. But even though the charm is thick,
it's spread on a bit thin. To give some credit, there a few things that do
make THE MATCHMAKER watchable: a better than average soundtrack, some
beautiful Irish landscapes, and, of course, those cute little accents.</P>
