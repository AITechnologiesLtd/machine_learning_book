<P>Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso, a goateed, unethical book dealer who
specializes in finding rare books for wealthy collectors (the kind of books not
available online at Amazon.com). One particular collector, Boris Balkan (Frank
Langella), requests Dean's help in locating two existing copies of "The Nine
Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows," a guide on how to conjure the spirit of
Satan, reportedly written by Satan himself. But Satan could not have written
three different copies of the same book, now could he? Dean's job is to
authenticate the other existing copies, and to determine if Balkan's is the
real deal. At first hesitant, Dean decides to travel to New York, Paris and
Portugal on his search. He encounters twin booksellers, a feisty widow (Lena
Olin), a stringent baroness in a wheelchair (Barbara Jefford), and an
aristocrat who plays the violin (Jack Taylor) and lays out all his precious
books on the floor of his living room. Naturally there are mysterious deaths
along the way, and there is a mysterious woman, identified in the credits as
the Girl, with piercing green eyes (Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's wife) who
happens to appear wherever Dean goes. </P>
<P>"The Ninth Gate" has a smoothly refined, exquisitely moody feel to it, thanks
to the amber, murky tones in the cinematography. Every scene in the film feels
as if there are mysterious forces within waiting to be uncovered, and the pages
of the books evoke an elusiveness in Dean's close introspection of every single
detail - you just sense he will find something which may lead nowhere. That is
Polanski's gift as a storyteller, letting minute details flourish in our mind
but we must be quick to catch them. I like the way he makes us focus on the
Girl when she first appears at Balkan's lecture, he tilts the camera down to
show that her legs barely touch the floor where she sits. The other neat touch,
though incidental in theory, is when Balkan shows Dean his collection of books
guarded by glass doors where the password to open them is 666. I also found it
interesting that Dean never sees the Girl floating in the air whenever chaos
ensues. </P>
<P>In the past, Polanski's atmosphere, mood and implicit horror always lead to a
dramatic, shocking finale, as in "Repulsion" or "Rosemary's Baby." This time,
the film sort of ends but in such an abrupt, wanting fashion that we wonder why
he went through the whole expense of involving us in the first place. To add
insult to injury, the film's final half-hour is submerged in absolute ridicule,
including a laughable Satanic ceremony, Langella yelling and screaming while
chanting to Satan, and a gratuitous sex scene that would make Hugh Hefner
chuckle with derisive laughter. </P>
<P>I still enjoyed "Ninth Gate" overall but it is more of an exercise in style
than substance, and Polanski does not take the film as seriously as he should
have. It is as if he wanted to revisit the themes of "Rosemary's Baby" and
decided to end it all in a "Fearless Vampire Killers" mode. A guilty pleasure
for us, and probably for Roman as well.</P>
