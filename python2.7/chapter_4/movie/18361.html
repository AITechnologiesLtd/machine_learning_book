<PRE>LIFE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The pairing seems ideal.  Putting Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence
together sounds like a perfect comedy teaming.  Toss in a high-concept
gimmick and plenty of old age makeup and you get Life, a bland movie
that may not be a prison term, but falls well short of its potential.</P>
<P>When the film opens, in 1930's New York, the pair haven't met and would
seem the unlikeliest of friends.  Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) is a thief
and con-artist with dreams of one day owning a nightclub:  Ray's Boom
Boom Room. Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) is a debt-ridden accountant
who has landed a new job and a beautiful girlfriend.  Things are looking
up, until Claude and Ray both run afoul of local gangster, Spanky (Rick
James).</P>
<P>The pair are given one chance to redeem themselves:  they are to make a
quick trip down to Mississippi to collect some bootleg moonshine. But,
things don't go as planned down South...and Ray and Claude somehow find
themselves sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.</P>
<P>Luckily, the two find themselves assigned to one of the comfiest hard
labor camps in Mississippi (or at least it seems that way onscreen). The
cell-free camp includes the friendliest bunch of murderers you're likely
to see, and plenty of rest and relaxation time (most of which is spent
playing baseball).  Anyone who tries to leave gets shot (except Ray and
Claude on their multiple escape attempts, of course), but the prison is
so cozy, why would anyone dream of leaving? If you get the idea that
Life offers a simplified view of incarceration, you would be correct.</P>
<P>The other inmates at the prison (including Obba Babatunde, Bernie Mac,
Miguel A. Nunez Jr, and Bokeem Woodbine) are meant to be colorful and
interesting, but not enough time is spent with any of them.  We never
learn their stories, and they all end up as mere generic convicts.</P>
<P>The entire film seems to be structured around one idea:  Eddie Murphy
and Martin Lawrence grow old together in prison.  Pile on the latex
aging makeup, and who cares about the lead-up material?  The problem is,
since from the film's opening we know the two spend their entire lives
imprisoned, there's no real point to any of the intervening scenes.
They'll never escape...they'll never die...so why not just skip to the
old age scenes and get on with it?</P>
<P>When Martin and Lawrence are on a roll, they come up with some pretty
funny stuff.  Unfortunately, most of the film is spent rehashing tired
old prison jokes, and the pair are rarely able to cut loose.</P>
<P>There's enough material here for about half a movie, and Life simply
repetitiously stretches it out to the full term.  As a video, this film
may fit the crime, but it isn't worth a sentence at your local theater.</P>
