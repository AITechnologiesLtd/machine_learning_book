THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So you're looking for an erotic knife-throwing movie?  I thought so.  </P>
<P>But, had you considered one about a knife thrower who is willing to do 
it blind in order to pump up the crowd?  If so, then Patrice Leconte's 
THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE (LA FILLE SUR LE PONT) is just the picture for 
you.</P>
<P>Chief among its delights are Serge Frydman's sharp and witty script and 
the sexually charged performance by Vanessa Paradis as the film's 
eponymous lead, Adele.  With pixyish good looks and large gaps between 
her teeth, Paradis appears less like a movie star than every man's wish 
for his girl next door.</P>
<P>Shot in an oversaturated black and white that manages to obscure the 
subtitles of some of the best sections of dialog, the movie is a fairy 
tale for adults.  The depressed damsel in distress is about to jump off 
of a bridge until she is rescued by a mysterious stranger, Gabor (Daniel 
Auteuil).</P>
<P>Adele explains that she is like flypaper in that she picks up all of the 
crud.  She is also a highly sexed 21-year-old, who tells about her love 
life in an extremely long opening monologue.  Watching nothing but a 
large talking head for the first 10 minutes of a story will try most 
viewers' patience.</P>
<P>Gabor, it turns out, spends his time hanging out on bridges and rooftops 
in order to recruit women.  No, he is not a pimp.  He is a middle-age 
knife thrower.  "Past the age of 40, knife throwing becomes sporadic," 
he explains to Adele, hence he tries to find women to work with him who 
have nothing to lose.  And being on the verge of suicide is certainly 
proof of a lack of belief in the future.</P>
<P>Adele admits that she has a weak right eye, which Gabor sees as an 
attribute.  "Eyes don't matter," he tells her.  "See less.  Fear less."</P>
<P>What she does see is men, all except Gabor that is.  "Boys attract me 
like beautiful clothes," she confesses.  "I always want to try them on."  
Since her first gig is at a circus, this presents a wonderful 
opportunity to try out sex with none other than a professional 
contortionist.</P>
<P>The movie is never better than when she's strapped to the board, 
withering in ecstasy and moaning with every knife strike.  As magical, 
exotic and erotic as these scenes are, they are too few and far between.  
The movie begins to end fairly predictably and then has the bad sense of 
timing not to stop but to keep going for yet another, equally 
predictable ending.  THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE, which is already a 
reasonably short film, would be improved dramatically by being much 
shorter still.  Fairy tales work best when they don't overstay their 
welcome.</P>
<P>THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE runs 1:32.  It is in French with English 
subtitles.  It is rated R for some sexuality and would be acceptable for 
most teenagers.</P>
