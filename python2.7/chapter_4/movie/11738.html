A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Richard Linklater</PRE>
<P>Written by: Richard Linklater, Clark Lee Walker, and Claude Stanush
based on a book by Claude Stanush</P>
<P>Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Julianna Margulies, Ethan Hawke, Dwight
Yoakam, Skeet Ulrich, Vincent D'Onofrio</P>
<P>Ingredients: Four bank robber brothers in the Roaring 1920s farm belt</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In the Roaring '20s - - the era of prohibition, gangsters, and bank
robberies - - four country brothers (called the Newton boys) and their
partner Mr. Glasscock rob over 80 banks in the American farm belt
between 1919 and 1924. Meanwhile leader of the brothers Willis Newton
(Matthew McConaughey) romances a store clerk named Louise (Julianna
Margulies). Finally, when a business deal goes sour, the NEWTON BOYS rob
a postal train instead of a bank, and the Feds soon come nosing around.
What will happen?</P>
<P>THE NEWTON BOYS is based on the true story of the Newton family, four
young guns who were real life bank robbers in the 1920s. In fact, the
credits of THE NEWTON BOYS contains a Johnny Carson interview with
80-something former bank robber Joe Newton - - the youngest brother - -
who describes his younger days as 'crazy.' In real life the Newton boys
blew up safes at night when nobody was around, and they also refused to
shoot anybody throughout their entire criminal careers. But they were
successful as thieves, and they lived to tell about it.</P>
<P>Opinion:
THE NEWTON BOYS is not an action movie, but perhaps that's just as well,
given the material: the real life Newtons never shot anybody and did
their work when nobody was around. The film takes us from heist to heist
in a wandering, traveling fashion, with nothing really driving the plot,
and not much development of character, almost like a light dramatic
chronicle. </P>
<P>In the 'screen hunk' department, this film has plenty: Matthew
McConaughey plays older brother Will; Ethan Hawke is Jess; Skeet Ulrich
is youngest brother Joe, and Vincent D'Onofrio is brawny Dock. They get
to wear a lot of classy suits, vests, and hats. And they drive
great-looking vintage wheels. </P>
<P>As far as the script is concerned, McConaughey gets the lion's share of
lines, and does a good job with them. Unfortunately the other brothers
are not much more than interchangeable scenery. Ethan Hawke hams it up a
little bit by strumming the ukulele and swilling whiskey, but these are
mere gestures. Similarly Julianna Margulies does the best she can
possibly do given her small role. THE NEWTON BOYS is slow-paced light
fare focusing mostly on older brother Willis. It's like a meandering
documentary without a narrator, where the silent narrator is main star
McConaughey.</P>
