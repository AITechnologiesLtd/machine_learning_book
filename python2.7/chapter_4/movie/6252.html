<P>     I'm not sure what it is that inspired the highly respected Merchant
Ivory production team to turn from fiction to biography, but I wish they
would drop it already.  For years, director James Ivory, producer Ismail
Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala turned out exceptionally
well-crafted adaptations of novels commonly held to be too difficult to
film:  A ROOM WITH A VIEW, HOWARDS END, THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  Then last
year they made JEFFERSON IN PARIS, a study of Thomas Jefferson in which
Nick Nolte looked as bored in the title role as the audience must have
been watching him.  SURVIVING PICASSO is not nearly as paralyzingly dull,
but it demonstrates once again that real people seem to elude Ivory and
company.</P>
<P>     Frequent Merchant Ivory collaborator Anthony Hopkins stars as
celebrated artist Pablo Picasso, who is a living legend in his 60s when
the film opens in occupied Paris in 1943.  Picasso is all too aware of his
own celebrity, and uses it to seduce impressionable young women like
aspiring artist Francoise Gilot (Natascha McElhone).  Francoise becomes
his lover and the mother of two of his children, despite knowledge of the
previous lovers Picasso has taken in and abandoned like Marie-Therese
(Susannah Harker) and Dora (Julianne Moore), to say nothing of his wife
Olga (Jane Lapotaire).  Francoise believes it will be different with her,
but eventually discovers that Picasso uses far more than he loves.</P>
<P>     SURVIVING PICASSO is a particularly frustrating piece of work because
you can see what it is Ivory was trying to do.  Francoise is introduced
early as a strong-willed woman who risks the wrath of her domineering
father (Bob Peck) when she decides to pursue her artistic career, setting
up a conflict between Francoise and Picasso in which he has greater
difficulty reducing her to yet another of his weeping conquests.
McElhone, a newcomer with piercing eyes, brings out the intelligence in
Francoise, but she becomes a distressingly passive character, even more so
when she becomes a narrator for flashbacks.  Her unique personality has
little chance to emerge, and even seems to be contradicted directly by a
voice-over near the end in which Francoise notes that Picasso "made me
strong."  It is a baffling conclusion, since she seems infinitely stronger
before their relationship begins.</P>
<P>     Picasso himself is similarly enigmatic, played by Anthony Hopkins as
an egomanical bon vivant, turning his fame into a method for making people
feel insignificant, and honored merely to be in his presence.  Ivory and
Jhabvala do a fine job of showing us the effect of Picasso's behavior on
those around him, but they are much less effective at showing us the man
himself.  It does not help that we are never able to see Picasso's own
work to reflect his personality (his estate did not allow them to be
used), making his art little more than a footnote to SURVIVING PICASSO.
The film-makers remain distant, showing us bits and pieces of Picasso's
life, like a speech to a Communist Party conference, without connecting
them to the man he became.  We are never allowed inside the passionate
artist; Hopkins is technically proficient, wandering accent
notwithstanding, but his is a role which seems designed to be observed
rather than understood.</P>
<P>     You can always count on a Merchant Ivory film to look splendid, and
there is superb work once again from cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts
and production designer Lucianna Arrighi.  It is a beautiful environment
they have created for this story, but the characters in that environment
are disappointing.  There are several moments in SURVIVING PICASSO which
inspire a curiosity about this fascinating man, notably his rivalry
with contemporary Henri Matisse (Joss Ackland), but there is always the
nagging sense, as there was in JEFFERSON IN PARIS, that Ivory doesn't
really have a point of view.  His biographies are safe, almost documentary
detailings of events in an individual's life which do not add up to a
story.  Picasso and Jefferson were both fascinating historical figures
with private and public lives full of contradictions, and they should have
made for great drama.  Ivory simply seems too respectful of his subjects,
content to lay out events like they might appear in a history text without
much in the way of interpretation.  The irony is that he has been able to
take far more internalized fictional characters, like THE REMAINS OF THE
DAY's James Stevens, and make them extraordinarily vivid.  He has not
shown the same facility with bringing life to characters who actually
lived.</P>
