<PRE>ANGELA'S ASHES</PRE>
<PRE> Cigarettes.</PRE>
<P> The title: Angela's Ashes refers to cigarettes and not cremation.  If
someone had told me this before I had entered the film, I might have
enjoyed it more than I did.  Then again, if someone had told me about
the rest of the film, I might have asked for a final cigarette before
going in to Angela's Ashes.</P>
<P> Such is the price of not reading your press packet.</P>
<P> Angela's Ashes is Alan Parker's adaptation of Frank McCourt's
Pulitzer-Prize-Winning book.  Like most Pulitzer-Prize-winners and their
film adaptations, the adjective "long" is a good way to describe the
movie.  Despite having a shorter time than the three-hour Magnolia
(Angela's Ashes clocks in at two-and-a-half), Angela's Ashes feels much
more drawn out.</P>
<P> Angela's Ashes, unlike most films that never have a resolution, does
not feel like it is going nowhere fast.  It feels like it is going
nowhere very slowly.  Coming out of the theatre, that is the basic
impression that I lifted off of the film.  In the beginning, McCourt
claims that "Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the Irish
miserable childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic
childhood."  The rest of the movie attempts to drill in this point.</P>
<P> While it is drilling in this point, the film also attempts to tackle
(but never knocks down) such issues as prostitution, alcoholism, and the
Catholic Church.  I saw it, in fact, at a special screening for critics
and Catholic clergy.  The film takes on classically Irish and local
topics, and has its actors adopt a thick Irish accent (as if Emily
Watson and Robert Carlyle didn't have thick enough accents already.).
The script is thick with colloquialisms.</P>
<P> Despite a wonderful managing of the struggles of making an American
film about the Irish, the film does a terrible mismanaging of its plot.
The film is very unfocused, jumping from topic to topic and never having
a resolution along any lines that the film accentuates.</P>
<P> To its strong credit, I found that Angela's Ashes is able to push my
emotional buttons.  This is not to say I liked the film.  It is to say
that Emily Watson delivers an outstanding performance, Robert Carlyle
does his usual work (that is, an exceptional job), and Michael Legee
plays Frank McCourt to a tear-jerking (almost) T.  John Williams helps
everyone out with a score that, devoid of which, the film could not have
survived.  Also, a degree of religious humor helps the film's pacing.</P>
<P> I must admit that this is a film that I believe only Irish Catholics
can enjoy.  It is so regional and so tied in with Catholicism that it
shuns the outsider.  Since I am neither Irish nor Catholic I wouldn't
really know, but the Irish Catholic audience seemed to enjoy it, and
since the film has little else to its credit, that has to be the
explanation.</P>
<P> It has to be, because without local support and acting and music, the
film can't stand on its own two emaciated legs.</P>
