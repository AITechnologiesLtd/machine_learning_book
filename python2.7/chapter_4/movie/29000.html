<P>"How do you know when you're finished making love?" -Jackson Pollock to a 
LIFE Magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting</P>
<P>Jackson Pollock's "making love" quote is famous, but in practically the 
same breath, he said a more constructive thing, "It's like looking at a bed 
of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means." It took him sixteen 
words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed: equate God and 
abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to 
the point of resentment by the concept. The biopic _Pollock_, actor Ed 
Harris' directorial debut, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts 
Pollock's creations as part of the order of things, and should similarly 
disarm haters of fine art.</P>
<P>Arguably more than any other living actor, Harris, who also plays 
_Pollock_, embodies the archetypal Working Stiff, and his blue-collar 
demystification of Pollock's labour-intensive art, both as performer and 
director, makes for unpretentious cinema. (From what I know of Harris, he, 
like Pollock, was not born gifted or lucky; instead, a strong work ethic is 
the seed of his success.) Granted, it's possible that _Pollock_ will 
alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "purpose" of 
Pollock's splatter series: the common thread between them is a lack of 
editorializing. The movie _Pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent 
exchanges dotted by tantrums, but the motivations are left to our own 
perceptions. And it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film, as 
illustrated by a disheartening conclusion.</P>
<P>_Pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle 
against personal demons (alcoholism, depression, and the general attendant 
miseries of an artist) while finding a place of subconscious expression. A 
brief introduction to Pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting 
accosted by a fellow New York artist, Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden, 
awarded a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this brilliant portrayal), who 
works from the outside-in, pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush. 
In a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining 
studios, she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas, grilling 
him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says, "You paint 
the fucking thing," and leaves in a huff. By the time they wed, she has 
become his de facto manager; it is form marrying function and chaos 
marrying discipline, a most harmonious collision. (Krasner denies him a 
baby, indicating that it would upset the balance.)</P>
<P>Such a union is destined to implode, and I hope I'm not ruining the 
_Pollock_ experience by saying that it does. While it is never depicted as 
a very romantic matrimony to start--Pollock and wife channel their passions 
elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several 
years, and it comes down to Krasner suffering one of Pollock's conniptions 
too many: "You are killing me! You are killing me! You are killing me!" 
(Aside: Harris' own wife, Amy Madigan, is unrecognizable and exceptional as 
gallery diva Peggy Guggenheim.) Pollock himself moves on to dalliances with 
younger women like Ruth Klingman (the scorching Jennifer Connelly), hoping, 
one supposes, to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth.</P>
<P>I love Jackson Pollock's stuff and I am enamoured of Harris' _Pollock_ as 
well. It's scrappy and observant; no coincidence that its minor failings 
are the occasional invasive flourish, such as Jeff Beal's hummable but no 
less lamentable score--I can't imagine that Pollock, or anyone, would paint 
to this music, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing 
the images. One of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment 
of Hans Namuth shooting that famous Pollock footage in East Hampton, Long 
Island; the mounting tension is almost comic, as Namuth keeps interrupting 
Pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break. A more 
seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists 
or mediums are created equal.</P>
