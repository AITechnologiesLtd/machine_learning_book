<P>Want to know what drives me to do my job as an entertainment critic?
[Trust me: it ain't the money].  Well, you've come to the right place.
If WILD WILD WEST was the impetus for me to co-found 3BlackChicks Review
with my partner The Diva, then for me, HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE is the
inspiration that keeps me going on.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE, a self-financed, semi-autobiographical film by writer
and director Robert Townsend, tells the story of Bobby Taylor
(Townsend), an inspiring actor struggling to make it in show business
while maintaining his dignity and self-respect.  This is hard to do, as
he's surrounded by crab-in-a-barrel coworkers (Keenen Ivory Wayans,
Ludie Washington) to the left of him, and exploitative idiot TV
executives (Eugene R. Glazer, Lisa Mende, Dom Irrera), to the right.
Bobby is stuck in the middle with a strong support system, including
girlfriend Lydia (Anne-Marie Johnson), younger brother Stevie (Craigus
R. Johnson), their grandmother (the late Helen Martin) - and a healthy
imagination.  One in which he sees himself not as a jive talkin'
knucklehead or a thug, as the rest of Hollywood sees him - but as a film
noir detective, or Shakespearean thesp, or action hero.  You know: just
like any old actor.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I have a lot of love in my heart for this film, on so many levels.  I
admire Robert Townsend for having the fortitude to do the film in the
first place, mostly on his own dime, enlisting a huge group of fellow
actors, comedians, and other struggling artists, to help him make HS a
reality (listing them all here would take way too much space; I
encourage you to check out the IMDB listing for complete cast credits).
I remember watching interviews in which he talked about financing HS on
maxed-out credit cards - back in the days when that kind of thing was
fairly rare - and thought it was the coolest thing in the world to
believe in something so strongly that you would put yourself in
potential debt to keep it going.  That lesson wasn't been lost on me, to
this day.</P>
<P>But mostly, I love HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE because, even after 14 years, and a
bit of progress on the Black Folk In Hollywood front, I find it still
relevant; and more importantly, still *funny*.  As with another old
favorite of mine, BLAZING SADDLES, there are certain lines that never
fail to Take Me Back as soon as I hear them:</P>
<P>  -"He killeded my brutha! I *loveded* my brutha!"
  -"I'm making Winky Dinky Dog hoecakes...'cause hoes gotta eat, too!"
  -"We need you to be a little more 'Black'.  You know: stick your
    ass out, buck your eyes...you know how they do."</P>
<P>But Townsend and his writers don't rely on one-liners to carry the day,
no sirree; intermixed with the "serious" moral theme that drives the
story, Townsend sprinkled daydream sketches throughout HOLLYWOOD
SHUFFLE, skits in which castmembers played various multiple parts.  I
compare these rough skits to SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE when it was still
funny, or MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS...N' The Hood.</P>
<P>Townsend, who polished up some of the sketches from this film and used
them in his series of skit comedy specials on HBO [who could forget "The
Bold, The Black, and The Beautiful"?  Not me!], successfully
collaborated with Keenen Ivory Wayans on those specials as well as in
this movie.  I want to point out two sketches in particular: "Noir
Detective", which leads to the funniest bit I've ever seen this
particular Wayans brother do, in the person of Jerry Curl Johnson; and
obviously, "Speed & Tyrone: Sneakin' In The Movies".  Once you see the
latter skit, you'll have a taste of 3BC Flava.</P>
<P>HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE isn't the kind of movie everyone will Get; if it seems
dated, I think that's because some people are convinced that We *Have*
Overcome, and should Get On With It.  I'm not quite there yet.  From the
looks of things, We've just traded jive talkin' superfly pimps and hoes,
for trash talkin' gangstas and babymamas.  Yeah, progress.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<P>The Black Factor is abundantly clear throughout HS; let's go for the
White Factor instead.</P>
<P>I won't waste my time here browbeating well-meaning Whites into
submission.  I won't pile more guilt onto those fatcat con men who are
part of the Power Structure Oppressing Black Hollywood, or wonder why so
many of those Blaxploitation TV shows had Jewish writers.  And while I"m
not doing stuff, I won't I take to task those House Kneegrows who
continue to stick out their ass and buck their eyes for a non-feeling,
non-thinking Electronic Massa.  No, my sole purpose here is to wonder
exactly how lost some White Folk will be, hearing strange concepts like
"jheri curl", "light-skinned Blacks don't make good crooks" (and its
natural extension, the "paperbag test"), "crabs-in-a-barrel", and such.</P>
<P>On the real, it brings to mind a heartfelt email one of my readers sent,
asking me if I thought Spike Lee was at all concerned with whether White
viewers will understand the message in his movies.  Hell, Robert
Townsend isn't seen as an Angry Black Man to those who might make such
references - and I wonder if White viewers will understand *Townsend's*
message any better.</P>
<P>I'd make it easier by providing a "Bammer's Blactionary" here, but I've
long since retired that twist, sorry.  I think ya betta ask somebody.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I've been grumbling for awhile now that I couldn't find HOLLYWOOD
SHUFFLE on DVD at Netflix; but I just did a cursory search and it's
there (I screened a VHS version).  Now that I know that it can be
purchased, Amazon here I come!</P>
<P>HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE (rating: greenlight):
My new goal is to catch up to Robert Townsend, and shake his hand.
After all, he's partially responsible for "3BlackChicks Review"; and one
of these days, I plan on telling him so.</P>
