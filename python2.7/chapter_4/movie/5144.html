<P>     Franco Zeffirelli adapts Charlotte Bronte and the result is a
starchy, slow-moving soap opera that, depending upon your sense and
sensibility about these things, will leave you either swooning or sick
to your stomach.  The plot revolves around a homely governess (Charlotte
Gainsbourg) and her adventures in a gothic mansion full of secrets and
other surprises.  (That mansion is great, BTW.  I half-expected to see
Uncle Fester scurrying by in the background.) Zeffirelli's film has an
EYRE of cheesiness about it; from the sweeping music-accompanied scene
changes, to the self-important dialogue delivery, done so slowly that
you can almost count to ten between each line.  (Unlike, say, those
Austen adaptations, which are far from trashy.) The international cast
is quite a treat.  Ms. Gainsbourg is all neck, William Hurt is very
good, and Joan Plowright, fresh the deadly duo of MR. WRONG and THE
SCARLET LETTER, is her usual smiling self.  Other familiar faces include
Anna Paquin, Amanda Root, Fiona Shaw, and, even, Elle MacPherson.  The
audience that I saw this with applauded at the end, but were they happy
at the outcome, or just happy that it was over?</P>
