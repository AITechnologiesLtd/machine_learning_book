A Mark Sandrich film, "Top Hat".
Starring Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Erik Rhodes, Helen Broderick, Edward
Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Lucille Ball
Rating: ****</P>
<P>Top Hat, a superb Astaire-Rogers musical of the 30s is pretty damn hard to
resist. I recently saw it on video and reveled in the singing and dancing,
wonderful music and glorious acting. It's a sublime film, a real bliss-out.
I'm suprised that with revivals of old films pouring in as they are,
hollywood executives haven't came around to musicals, and in particular,
Astaire and Rogers musicals. The sets are really teriffic, and I can tell
that a big screen viewing would be in order. For now we can to make do
re-watching this just plain wonderful  gloriously realized old-fashioned
film on video. My enthusiam is un-limited. Why? Sure, it's terrific fun to
watch and sure, the acting is great and sure it's just...well...a great
film, but why are you so enthusiastic? Because Top Hat sets standards for
itself, says it will live up to those standards and does. That may seem
like a silly reason to give a film a great review, but it's not really;
Batman And Robin ( for example ) said it was going to be slick big spirited
fun with terrific F/X. It wasn't. It fell flat on it's face as soon as the
credits were over. What makes a great movie? Ambition, fun and high
standards mixed well, with a dollop of talent. Top Hat has all those
things, which is why it is such a classic and deserves to be. It's a
reccemonded rental.</P>
<P>Top Hat runs 1:37, and every minute is heaven. It is not rated but would be
a solid G and is totally appropriate for everyone. It's good family
viewing. See it. Because of it's sense of good solid fun and slick
performances, plus great music and the fact that it is really well made I
am giving it all big ****. See it.          </P>
