<PRE>HE GOT GAME</PRE>
<P>Release Date: May 1, 1998
Starring: Denzel Washington, Ray Allen, Rosario Dawson, Milla Jovovich,
Hill Harper, Zelda Harris, Jennifer Esposito, Bill Nunn, Ned Beatty
Directed by: Spike Lee
Distributed by: Buena Vista Pictures
MPAA Rating: R (sexuality, nudity, language, violence including a
beating) </P>
<P>The genre of "basketball dramas" is indeed a narrow one, and very few
films fit the bill. Sports movies in general are hard to make, and most
gravitate towards family or comedy genres. It's good to see, then, that
Director Spike Lee has chosen to focus his movie away from the game
itself and towards the powerful character relationships that make this
movie the so very enjoyable product that it is. Here, basketball as a
sport is used only as an underlying and omnipresent motivation for the
entire cast, and the movie's players are stronger because of it. HE GOT
GAME is by far the most watchable, enjoyable, and well made film yet for
1998. </P>
<P>The quandary that becomes the plot is an interesting one: Jake
Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) is a convicted murderer who is given a
mission from the state governor. If Jake can convince his son Jesus (Ray
Allen), the nation's number one high school basketball prospect, to play
for the guv's alma mater, then the governor will shorten Jake's sentence
considerably. Jake, who's looking at another fifteen years, jumps at the
chance - but it won't be easy for him. Jesus has already been scouted
and contacted by every major university with a basketball program, and
has even been offered a chance to skip college and make the jump
straight to a lucrative career in the pros. To top it off, Jake only has
a week until the deadline set by the NCAA for all athletes to declare
their intentions. </P>
<P>As the movie progresses, Lee introduces a great deal of animosity
between Jake and Jesus, which only hinder's Jake's cause. Neither of the
two actors here are particularly strong, but they are realistic, which
makes their conflict believable and solid. The drama that plays out
between them becomes surprisingly deep and very dynamic: the movie
follows not one but two different stories that are very critical to each
other's believability. Lee masterfully helms the dual picture, creating
atmosphere by including some inspiring moments of photography (he uses
camera tricks similar to those in NIXON - varying speeds, angles,
lighting, and pacing). The picture is topped off by a fantastically
dynamic score, mixing the brass oriented strains of Aaron Copland's
music with the steady beat of Public Enemy. Written by Lee as well, the
script oscillates between moments of affable humor and solemn drama. </P>
<P>The audience can get very in touch with this movie. Unlike most movies
which use the foregone edge of pop culture to seduce the teenage and
Generation X demographics, the existence of it in HE GOT GAME is so
inbred with the movie that it does not detract from the film's value.
Jesus, as he is being scouted, is drawn and repulsed by the moral
excesses of drugs, alcohol, sex, money, and other forms of materialism -
all illegal in some way. The movie touches on human emotions that are
deep in scope, as well as pop culture issues which are limited in
vision. HE GOT GAME is, as mentioned, a dynamic experience as well as
enjoyable and worthwhile one - and will most likely be among the top
films of 1998.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "HE GOT GAME": 3.5 stars - a great movie.</P>
