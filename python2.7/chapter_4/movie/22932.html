<P>Similar to the release of Scream, I was skeptical about how good this movie
would turn out. As this sequel so blatantly proves through its horror - buff
college students, sequels are never better than the original. In fact, they
could not only be terrible, but they could also make a viewer doubtful of how
good the first one was. Scream 2 is certainly not better than Scream because it
lacks the perfect setting from the original. The teenagers living in your
traditional suburban neighborhood who attend your classic chaotic house parties
is a horror movie's dream setting. In Scream 2, the surviving kids from the
first one have grown up and now are attending a larger college. However, they
are still being attacked by a mysterious murderer in a "ghost face" mask. The
question is: who is the killer? Most of the characters have matured and now
share a stronger connection with adults living in the same town as them. The
maturity is what Scream 2 should have avoided. The fact that the kids were
nothing but "stoned dudes" in the first film made it so funny. The only real
contact the kids had to the adult world in Scream, besides the cops, was their
authoritative principal (the ubiquitous Henry Winkler) who didn't really care
about any of his students' safety. This is what was so funny about Scream, it
had your stereotypical trouble-maker teens and your basic adult who harshly
reminds these kids to behave. This is something we've seen many times before at
the theaters and can now laugh at how embarrassingly bad it is in this parody
of a horror movie.  In Scream 2, the only real adult introduced, besides cops
and reporters, is main character Sydney's drama teacher (David Warner). They
share a few pointless bonding scenes together that show that these once no good
kids are now respectable young adults. Who wants respectable young adults to be
your main characters? Not me. </P>
<P>Now that the kids have grown up and hold more responsibilities, the jokes just
aren't as funny as the original. The only amusing sections are when Randy
(Jamie Kennedy) recites the rules of a sequel; there are more deaths, they are
bloodier, and anyone can be a suspect, and even these parts seem tacked on and
unnecessary to the plot. I thought screenwriter Kevin Williamson could have
added more lines about how black characters never survive in the sequel. He had
the perfect opportunity with a cameraman (Duane Martin who shines in every
scene that he is in) but unfortunately is underused. The fact that the sequel
has a lot more violence could have diminished its script from completely
shining. Williamson has the potential of a witty screenwriter but whenever he
seemed to launch a grand punch line, an outburst of violence suddenly
interrupted his train of thought. When thought over a number of times, it could
be possible that Williamson made a dissatisfactory script on purpose to prove
that sequels are always worse. Intentionally bad or not, the script is still
overwhelmingly disappointing.</P>
<P>Wes Craven still makes Scream 2 a pleasing attempt. The violence that he uses
may hurt the script, but it is still incredibly intense, particularly a scene
involving a police car crash. The film never drags on, its quick pace, very
similar to that of Scream, never hits a bump in the road allowing for
edge-of-your-seat action throughout. </P>
<P>Scream 2 is a decent film placed at the middle of the Scream trilogy. Those
looking for mindless violence will find it, however those looking for a clever
script like the first one, may be let down.  </P>
