<P>   "I am a queen.  I have five children.  I have a home"  So
declares Jadzia Pzoniak (Lena Olin), the matriarch of a large
Polish-American family in Detroit, to which her not-so-secret
lover, Roman (Rade Serbedzija) retorts, "If you're a queen,
why are you here?"  Why indeed? After all, the Detroit
community photographed so well looks almost like the idyllic
Florida location of Peter Weir's "The Truman Story".  The
townspeople are simple, hardworking ethnics.  The members
of the extended Pzoniak family include a baker, two office
cleaners, and a cop.  The church, which dominates the
landscape, casts a forbidding gaze about the working-class
community as though to insure at least a patina of family
stability, celibacy for the young and unmarried, and innocence
for all.</P>
<P>   Novice writer-director Theresa Connelly punctures the
sylvan scenario through a roundelay of vignettes that reveal
the illusory nature of community.  Jadzia looks for love
because she married Bolek Pzoniak (Gabriel Byrne) not for
love but for obligation: hers was a shotgun wedding which
produced five healthy children, at least one of them is
destined to repeat the miscalculation of the matriarch.</P>
<P>   Connelly's "A Polish Wedding" tries to do for the Polish
culture living in America what John Patrick Shanley
accomplished for Italian-Americans in "Moonstruck."  Shanley,
an experienced playwright whose well-received film evoked its
tone through the influence of moonlight, involved a great
number of hilarious moments and madcap dialogue (as when
during the course of a family dinner Olympia Dukakis tells her
father-in-law "Feed one more bite of my food to your dogs,
old man, and I'll kick you 'til you're dead!").  Though
Connelly's film highlights the tense relationships among
parents, in-laws and children who try to carve out happiness
under the roof of their modest wooden home, the writer lacks
Shanley's edge.  Of the grudges the characters feel for others
in "A Polish Wedding," none is evoked by such rollicking
circumstances as that felt in "Moonstruck" by Nicolas Cage
toward Danny Aiello when Aiello made Cage look the wrong
way while slicing some bread and Cage lost his hand as a
result.</P>
<P>  That said, "A Polish Wedding" does have good ensemble
performances by some talented, quirky actors, with Gabriel
Byrne in the role of the laid-back baker who is aware of his
wife's nocturnal goings-on and simply sighs with resignation
and despondency;  Lena Olin as the sexy mom who meets
her lover in full military uniform, pretending frequent a meeting
of the Polish Ladies' Auxiliary; and Clair Danes as the
teenager, her mother's daughter, who climbs through windows
to meet her boyfriend like Alice progressing through the
looking glass in search of magic.</P>
<P>   Connelly is more eager to establish a nostalgic tone, to re-
create an American community that could have been found in
the 1930s or 1940s, than she is in advancing a plot.  To do
this she relies heavily on Luis Bacalov's Fellini-esque music
track and on a series of vignettes rather than a tightly-woven
narrative.  She sets up a flirtatious romance between young
Chala (Claire Danes) and a young cop who gets her
pregnant, Russell (Adam Trese), and as in most romantic
movies puts enough obstacles in their path to delay the
inevitable Polish wedding of the title.  Despite the fairy-tale
atmosphere of the entire story, credibility is created through
the remarkable similarity in appearance and behavior of
Jadzia and her daughter, the audience becoming as involved
with one liaison as with the other.  Given that the Pzoniak's
married son Ziggy's (Daniel Lapaine) baby cries constantly,
and that daughter-in-law Sofie (Mimi Avital) suffered a painful
birth, Sofie is determined to avoid having more children--
which sets up increasing frustration for grandchild-loving
Jadzia.</P>
<P>   The appealing actors take us through a few laughable
moments from time to time, particularly one in which the
entire Pzoniak family marches on the home of the man who
impregnated Chala, ultimately forcing him to marry in much
the way that Jadzia herself entered into a coerced union with
her unhappy husband, Bolek.  Yet this is not the tale of a
dysfunctional family but of one which has resigned itself to a
life of brief, joyful assignations only to recognize by the final
curtain that Dan Quayle may have been right.</P>
