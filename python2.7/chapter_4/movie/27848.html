<P>Comedy, Fable, Story...these three words best describe the delectable 
"Chocolat", the new film directed by Lasse Hollstrom (1999's The Cider House 
Rules). There are films out in the world that are just great, but not worthy 
of Oscar Nominations. In 1999 "The Cider House Rules" took the world by 
surprise and received an Oscar Nomination, of course even being a fantastic 
movie, it wasn't a movie that needed an Oscar Nominator. In 2000 "Chocolat" 
was nominated for Best Picture, and unfairly as well for still being a good 
movie, it isn't Oscar Material.</P>
<P>The film starts with a prologue of a voice-over of a woman, telling about a 
small village in France. This is a peaceful, humble village where all the 
people go to church every Sunday, they all keep their streets clean, and 
their children all go to a nice school. One Sunday the North wind brought in 
a chill, but also a surprise, for two new people are moving into this small 
French Village. Vianne Rooter (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter Anouk 
Rocher (Victoire Thivisiol) open up a Chocolate shop in this town, and take 
it by surprise. For Vianne herself puts special ingredients in her chocolat, 
for such things as sexuality, moodiness, or insomnia. Much despised by the 
townfolk, especially by the mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), they try 
to run them out of the village, but of course Vianne stands up for herself 
and tries to prove that she is not a bad person, but just a different one. </P>
<P>The movie's underlying tone is that of a good message, there are a lot of 
stereotypes in the film, and the character of Vianne tries to stop that in 
this town. A feeling of warm and fuzzy overcomes the viewer as the end 
credits go up, and you are left with a smile on your face and a thought in 
your head. Lasse Hollstrom's direction is very nicely done, especially in the 
opening sequence with a nice CGI effect of a camera drop in on the town 
(which for being described as very small, it actually good size). </P>
<P>The characters are very nicely portrayed by many well-known faces. First up 
is the French Actress Juliette Binoche (who is nominated for an Oscar for her 
role, and deservedly so), she is a very beautiful and graceful actress who 
brings out the best of her character. Dame Judi Dench (who is also nominated 
for an Oscar) for her role as the cranky landlord of Vianne. Two well known 
American actors are also involved in this project. Carrie Anne-Moss of "The 
Matrix" fame, does a great job playing the uptight character of Caroline 
Claimont (who we find out some interesting tidbits about), and the misplaced 
character of Roux (played well by Johnny Depp) the pirate type man who almost 
brings the town to a stop.</P>
<P>"Chocolat" is based on the novel by Joanne Harris, and is written for the 
screen by Robert Nelson Jacobs. His script is well written, with some clever 
and witty dialogue that actually had me laughing out loud a couple of times. 
This isn't your type of comedy where your going to be bent over laughing, but 
a nice, sweet little comedy where a smile comes over your face and even a 
laugh here and there.</P>
<P>Even with these good things, "Chocolat" suffers it's share of bad things as 
well. Besides being somewhat predictable, the characters especially that of 
Roux are needless, and really just cliched. In my opinion, the film would 
have been better without him. Also a sequence in which I got so mad I almost 
left, and then it just turned around of course just messing with our 
feelings. It may sound like I am ragging on this movie, but believe me I'm 
not, just a few flaws the movie has. In the end, "Chocolat" is a rewarding 
experience that I could watch many times, and never get tired of.</P>
