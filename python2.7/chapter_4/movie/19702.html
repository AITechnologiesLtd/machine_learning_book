<P>The Baby Dance (1998) (made for TV)
director: Jane Anderson
starring: Laura Dern, Stockard Channing, Peter Riegert, Richard Lineback</P>
<P>To sum things up quickly, The Baby Dance is a great movie.  With Laura Dern
nominated for a Golden Globe and Stockard Channing nominated for a Golden
Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild award all because of their performances,
how could it not?</P>
<P>The story revolves around Channing, who along with her husband, are a
well-off couple trying to have a family.  Several unsuccessful attempts have
put them in the adoption process.  Dern, a rather poor, married, mother of
four, is yet again pregnant and who, along with her husband, realize they
don't have the money to raise another child.  They live in a trailer with no
air conditioning, drive an old and constantly breaking down truck, and are
willing to put the baby up for adoption.</P>
<P>The struggles mount as Channing, who is willing to pay for a new air
conditioner and medical expenses, finds that her money is being spent to fix
the truck, pay Dern's mother's bills and other non-baby related expenses.
The adoption comes close to being called off, but Channing really wants the
baby so she pulls through.</P>
<P>When the baby is finally born, a complication during the birthing gives rise
to the chance that permanent brain damage might have occurred.  Do they take
the baby or does Dern keep it?  Watch the movie and see.</P>
<P>The photography is great and even the supporting cast put on believable
performances.  The movie holds it own during it's 95 minutes and keeps you
interested in what's going on, even if it is a little uneventful at times.
This is one movie where you pause to go get a drink instead of just letting
it play.</P>
<PRE>My rating: ***1/2 of ****.</PRE>
