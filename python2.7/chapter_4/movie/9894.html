<PRE>NOTHING TO LOSE (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Steve Oedekerk
Starring: Tim Robbins, Martin Lawrence, John C. McGinley, Giancarlo
Esposito, Kelly Preston, Michael McKean, Rebecca Gayheart, Steve
Oedekerk</P>
<P>For four days at the crap college theatre, where you can see mainstream
films with bad quality for a mere buck 25 (with college id, of course),
they were playing a "surprise movie."  Could it be perhaps a new movie,
or maybe an upcoming film?  Or maybe a popular classic, like "Star
Wars?"  Welp, I got there and it turns out to be none other
than..."Nothing To Lose."  Since I had hiked across campus to find out
what it was and perhaps see it, those were my exact sentiments on
whether I was going to see it or not.</P>
<P>"Nothing To Lose," as the previews stated, is a comedy about racial
unity, robbery, vengeance, and suicidal tendencies.  It has a nice
little gimmick that at least got a little smirk across my face:
sucessful white boy named Nick (Tim Robbins) finds his wife (Kelly
Preston) is cheating on him with his boss (Michael McKean), so he goes
out in his big car, is carjacked by "T" for Terence (Martin Lawrence),
and he figures he has nothing to lose, so he hits the accelerator, and
the two end up being partners in crime.</P>
<P>The premise might be really shallow and all, but it's at least a nice
idea for a good old comedy.  And with serious actor Tim Robbins playing
off of hyperkinetic comic actor Martin Lawrence, you could tell that
this little odd couple would make up for any poorness the script could
possibly posess.  But while I was right on both counts, there's
something missing from the big picture.  Sure, I was laughing, but I
still left feeling like this was just an "ok" movie.</P>
<P>Where's the problem in this?  Well, for starters, the whole suplot of
the two other robbers (John C. McGinley and Giancarlo Esposito) is so
unfunny and weak.  I mean, it has its moments (I actually laughed when
all of them were cursing at eachother for a full minute), but it's just
a poor excuse to get them in more trouble (and extend the length of the
film).  Most of the jokes in this section of the film are cheap, and
unfunny...and it doesn't help that McGinley and Espostio are horrible in
their roles (both CAN act, but not here, strangely).</P>
<P>And the whole adultery gimmick has a really horrible pay-off at the end,
which just exhumes cheapness.  It's just another example of a film
pulling its punches at the last moment, too afraid to go for an original
ending which might not be satisfying to a programmed mass audience.  You
have to see it to believe how dumb it is.  And a little fling Nick has
with a person at his work (Rebecca Gayheart, who was on "90210" for a
while as Luke Perry's girlfriend - I bet you're all wondering how I know
this - oh, and she was the "Noxzema Girl" for a while) is nothing short
of cheap and moronic.</P>
<P>But perhaps the chief problem is with the writing and direction of Steve
Oedekerk (who did the second "Ace Ventura" film, which I still refuse to
see unless I can see it for free).  The film has a totally outrageous
premise, and the film isn't outrageous enough.  As I said, it pulls many
punches, but that's only part of it.  The writing isn't funny enough,
the scenes aren't as wildly shot as they should be, and the storyline
doesn't go as beserk as it should.  Of course, it could be me.</P>
<P>The two leads, on the other hand, are very funny.  Robbins and Lawrence
would probably never be caught in the same movie other than this one,
and they actually posess some good chemistry.  Robbins has done comedy
before (although no one saw it: "The Hudsucker Proxy"), and here he's
hysterical.  He has a way of being extremely likable witout
overshadowing his partner, which is kinda hard since it's Martin
Lawrence, of the now-defunct "Martin."  I've never really been a huge
fan of Lawrence, but I have to say he was hilarious in this one. 
They're the best thing of this film.</P>
<P>Kelly Preston and Michael McKean show up in the beginning and end in
very under-written parts, though Preston and Robbins have some scenes
where they have some great chemistry.  Poor Michael McKean, though. 
He's a funny guy (need I remind anyone of "This is Spinal Tap?"), but
the 90s have been very cruel to him (save "The Brady Bunch Movie"). 
He's always getting very unfunny parts where he tries his best, and
here's another example.</P>
<P>"Nothing to Lose" is funny and all, but it's not really worth going out
of your way to see.  If you can see it for cheap and with very little
physical movement, go for it.  But you're not going to come out enriched
or anything.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
