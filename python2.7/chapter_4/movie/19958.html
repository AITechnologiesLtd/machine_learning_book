<PRE>The Siege (1998)
* * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"The Siege" does the one thing in a movie that I find inexcusable: it
stacks its deck.  Meaning that it is contrived to have an easy way out
of a problem where there isn't one.  Instead of taking their very
interesting basic idea and following it through to its logical
conclusion, the filmmakers cheated.  They gave us an easy, disposable
bad guy where there should not have been one.</P>
<P>The film's premise is if nothing else timely.  It features Denzel
Washington as an FBI agent who grapples with the presence of a set of
terrorist cells in New York City.  These guys mean business: they thumb
their nose at negotiations, blowing up a bus midway through what looks
like a possible end of a standoff.  They want the release of an Iraqi
cleric, kidnapped covertly by the U.S. and being held in secret by the
army.</P>
<P>Denzel almost immediately runs into "Elise" (Annette Bening), a CIA
operative who either knows a lot more or a lot less than she actually
does, and the two of them engage in a very tough-minded tug of war over
possible leads and sources of information.  The scenes between them are
sharp and convincing; someone did their homework about how the
Palestinians wind up being the middlemen in everyone's intelligence
game.  Bening in particular is very good, always smiling when she
shouldn't.</P>
<P>But then the movie begins to step wrong with the introduction of
General Deveraux (Bruce Willis), who is brought in when martial law is
invoked, and proceeds to set up internment centers for suspected
terrorists.  The parallels are obvious: they're trying to invoke the
same sense of shame as when the U.S. interred Japanese- and German-
Americans.  But it doesn't work this time, because the movie attempts
to switch tracks on us and have the Willis character be the obvious
villain: Get rid of him and the story's over, and in fact that's more
or less what happens.</P>
<P>Why did this annoy me?  Because it's dishonest: if the movie had simply
been a procedural along the lines of "The Peacemaker", it would have
been a more than passable thriller.  But instead it mixes its
messages.  The Willis character is supposed to be, I guess, a warning
about how America is often its own worst enemy, but that gets buried by
the lockstep plotting that demands he be an off-the-shelf bad guy.</P>
<P>There's a lot of good things in the movie.  They're just short-
circuited.  Tony Shalhoub, for instance, is fine as a Palestinian-
American FBI agent, but the movie tries to force points when his son is
thrown in the internment centers.  And I mentioned Bening, and
Washington is always watchable, even in a movie like this, and there's
plenty of glossy-looking photography and production design.  But by the
fatally rushed ending, I couldn't concede that all this did much more
than make a deeply flawed movie into a merely bearable two hours.</P>
