<PRE>Metro (1997)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Better-than-average actioner with Eddie Murphy *not* doing a
reprise of Axel Foley. Still doesn't quite leave the ground, though.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy isn't exactly breaking new ground with METRO, an action picture
in which he plays a fast-moving police negotiator, but he does make the
movie an enjoyable experience. He is several megawatts less cranky than the
shrill and unpleasant Axel Foley, for starters.</P>
<P>Murphy's character lives and works in San Francisco. He knows his job well,
and doesn't believe that everyone he negotiates with deserves a SWAT bullet
through the head. But if it comes to that... well, that may be part of the
reason he goes to the racetrack and bets like crazy. He's a weird cross
between Can-Do Man and a walking deathwish. He does have a ladyfriend, and
the time they have on screen is engaging and funny (and judging from the
repartee, mostly unscripted).</P>
<P>Murphy runs afoul of a very nasty and cold-blooded diamond thief (played
with torrents of venom and grease by Michael Wincott), and quickly earns
himself an enemy. In a remarkable scene, Wincott takes over a posh
jewelers', and Murphy goes to talk him down. The two of them engage in a
fencing match of wits that's almost worth seeing the movie for -- and then
erupts into an incredibly violent and drawn-out chase that tears across most
of San Francisco. Both characters taunt each other savagely in scenes that
feel like they come from another movie, they're so ugly and angry.</P>
<P>The movie's schizophrenia is subtle, but it's there. On the one hand, there
are the *really* smart touches, like the way the whole hostage scene is
built, or the aforementioned mental cruelty between the two leads. On the
other hand, there are a gutload of criminally manipulative moments, like the
one where Murphy's ladyfriend is being stalked by bad theme music. Taken as
a whole, METRO's relatively entertaining, but anyone who picks too hard at
the movie is going to be disappointed. It's another disposable stop on the
trolley car of Murphy's career.</P>
