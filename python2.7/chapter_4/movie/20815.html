<P>  Double Jeopardy (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee
Jones and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Bereford</P>
<P> "Double Jeopardy" is a straightforward, no-frills, guilty-pleasure movie.</P>
<P> It's a simple programmer, meant only to kill some time.</P>
<P> This revenge drama offers no bells or whistles, no twists, turns or
surprises.</P>
<P> Everything about it is predictable and preordained.</P>
<P> Basically, what "Double Jeopardy" consists of is a chase. A wife, wrongly
imprisoned for killing her husband, is paroled after serving six years,
then sets out to find her conniving spouse (who isn't really dead, of
course) and her son.</P>
<P> Explanations are few and far between, and this is such a silly story that
you don't even care about the plot holes. For example, how did hubby get
off the sailboat? And whose blood was that all over the boat? And why
wasn't all the blood found on the boat checked to see if it matched that of
Nick Parsons (Bruce Greenwood), the husband Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) was
supposed to have killed?</P>
<P> Because if any of that had been accomplished, there would have been no movie.</P>
<P> "Double Jeopardy" is a movie short on details but long on action. After
being paroled, Libby immediately breaks parole to begin her quest.</P>
<P> Now searching for her is her parole officer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones).</P>
<P> Of course, by film's end, he comes to believe her story of being framed.</P>
<P> Nice scenery and locations, including Washington state and New Orleans,
are the main attractions here.</P>
<P> Judd is adequate as the outraged spouse seeking justice, while Jones
doesn't seem to be working too hard as Lehman. Actually, he seems to be
doing an imitation of his Sam Gerard character from "The Fugitive" and
"U.S. Marshals."</P>
<P> Director Bruce Beresford, who helmed the Academy Award-winning "Driving
Miss Daisy," is too good a filmmaker to just punch the clock. He keeps
"Double Jeopardy" moving, not allowing the audience to think about all the
preposterous situations and incongruities that are rife throughout.</P>
<P> "Double Jeopardy" is merely a fun diversion. It's workmanlike and is only
there to entertain. If you keep your expectations grounded, you won't be
disappointed.</P>
