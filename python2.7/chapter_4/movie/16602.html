Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Some day soon, I'm going to put together a list of the most over-used
premises in film history, the ones which describe the entire story arc in
a single sentence.  It will include such classics as "Mismatched Buddy
Cops Gradually Become Friends While Blowing a City to Shrapnel" (recently
seen in RUSH HOUR), "Workaholic Learns Through Tragedy and/or Wacky
Misadventures to Appreciate His/Her Family" (recently seen in ONE TRUE
THING).  To be fair, and to recognize that certain plots become canonical
for valid thematic reasons, I'll even try to note examples of each that
managed to add a spark of originality.</P>
<P>     CENTRAL STATION takes one marvelously constructed character and uses
her to put just enough of a twist on one of those well-known 
single-sentence stories:  "Jaded Older Character Learns Important Lessons
When Forced to Care for a Child."  The jaded older character is Dora
Teixera (Fernanda Montenegro), a retired schoolteacher who supplements her
meager income by writing letters for the many illiterate individuals who
pass through Rio de Janeiro's train depot.  One of Dora's customers is a
woman who writes to the absentee father of her 9-year-old son Josue
(Vinicius de Oliveira).  When the woman is hit by a bus, leaving Josue a
homeless orphan, Dora's first instinct is to sell him to an adoption
broker.  Instead, she decides to deliver both the letter and the boy in
person, setting off with Josue on a difficult journey to Brazil's rural
northeast.</P>
<P>     Such stories usually begin with characters that are crusty but
identifiably loveable, making the journey little more than a waiting game
until the resident adorable tyke trims off the crust.  Dora, on the other
hand, is a fairly grim piece of work.  Our initial image of her as a
kindly educated woman helping out the pobrecitos gives way to an image of
bitterness and cynicism, as we see her arbitrarily shred or hide away
letters she decides are not worth sending.  Fernanda Montenegro uses her
wonderfully weathered face to create Dora as a grandmotherly con artist,
and not the kind of devilishly adorable con artist justified in most films
by the fact that he or she steals Robin Hood-like from the rich.  Dora
steals from the poor because she feels contempt for them and for the 
foolish optimism they express in their letters and their prayers.</P>
<P>     What we gradually learn is that Dora's contempt is really a
manifestation of her own insecurities, her inability to maintain
relationships, and her issues with the father who abandoned her as a
child.  It's eventually obvious that CENTRAL STATION is about Dora's quest
for her own father more than it is about her quest for Josue's father, but
that's exactly what gives the familiar story more thematic weight.  The
cute bonding moments between Dora and Josue are few and far between,
allowing director Walter Salles to concentrate on the fact that the
journey changes Dora more than the child does.  Montenegro's performance
brings an edge even to moments like her clumsy attempts to show affection
to a truck driver (Othon Bastos).  For most of the film, her anti-social
personality feels completely genuine, not in the least like a device for
an uplifting conclusion.</P>
<P>     Inevitably, though, CENTRAL STATION has got to reach its uplifting
conclusion.  Dora will see a light of optimism, both for herself and for
Josue, and move on to live a more fulfilled life.  And it is only when
that happens that CENTRAL STATION feels false, even though the change is
necessary in order for it to be dramatically satisfying.  Montenegro is a
deft enough actress to limit the burden of schmaltz, but she can't change
the fact that the script tells her that, by God, she's going to learn
Important Lessons.  CENTRAL STATION is still a good film, satisfying for 
three-quarters of its length as a character study.  There's just no way
it can escape completely the conventions of its single-sentence story.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 station identifications:  7.</PRE>
