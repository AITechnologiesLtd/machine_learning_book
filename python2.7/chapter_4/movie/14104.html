<P>   The great English librettist W.S. Gilbert once said that
things are seldom what they seem. Writer-director Stanley
Tucci seconds the concept with "The Imposters"--a free-
flowing, farcical account of the adventures of two hapless,
starving actors who must play different roles just to survive. 
Presumably inspired by the Marx Brothers' greatest comedy,
"A Night at the Opera," "The Imposters" is a pale parody of
counterfeit characters, a film which looks wildly improvised
rather than deeply thought out but a picture in which the cast
seem to be having the time of their lives.  Stanley Tucci now
makes his presence felt as director, writer, and co-producer
as well as one of our funniest actors.  In a picture being
released at about the same time as this one, "The Alarmist,"
he is at his satirical best as a con artist who steals from the
very houses he services.  In "The Imposters," however, he
performs in the role of a merely timid, out-of-work actor who
alternates between schemes to scrounge up some food and a
desperate flight from a silly man whose anger he has
provoked.  He is teamed up with Oliver Platt, as his good
friend and similarly unemployed actor, with whom he plots his
narrow escape until the two ultimately emerge as heroes. 
"The Imposters" is not a coherent picture but more a dim
series of vignettes, each involving a passenger or two on a
luxury cruise to Paris, each entourage bearing its own
agenda.  Like Arthur (Oliver Platt) and Maurice (Stanley
Tucci), the passengers on the ship are often other than what
they seem, some ardent revolutionaries plotting terrorism,
others depressed to the point of suicide, and still others
seemingly normal but actually deposed monarchs.  As in "A
Night at the Opera," the action takes place in pre-World War
Two times, an age before transatlantic airlines took a large
chunk from the business of long-distance cruising.</P>
<P>   The difference between illusion and reality is portrayed
early on as Maurice and Arthur, apparently strangers who are
sipping espresso in a restaurant by a lake, become involved
in a violent argument.  Soon after one appears to stab the
other to death while surrounded by a crowd of gaping
spectators, we become privy to their game. They are
rehearsing scenes from a play to keep their on their toes for
future auditions, and they do not hesitate to use their thespian
charms to finagle food from unsuspecting merchants.  The
funniest scene, in fact, comes not after they have boarded a
cruise ship to escape from a stage actor they've enraged but
early on as they botch a plan to lift a few boxes of pastries
from a gullible baker (David Lipman).</P>
<P>   Having insulted performer Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina)
who does a substandard job in portraying "Hamlet," they are
pursued by the thesp who will stop at nothing short of killing
the two offenders.  Stowing away on a ship bound from New
York harbor to Paris, they soon disguise themselves as
stewards who run into a series of escapades involving a
motley group of passengers.  They eavsdrop on an attempt
by head steward Meistrich to pursue his love for his female
counterpart Lily (Lili Taylor).  Hiding under a bed, Maurice
overhears a plot by the first mate (Tony Shalhoub) to blow up
the boat and its "bourgeois" passengers.  They sit in on an
awful vocal concert by entertainer Happy Frank (Steve
Buscemi) who, having just been divorced is intent on suicide. 
Disguised as a married couple with Maurice dressed in drag,
they are aggressively pursued by a bisexual Scot named
Sparks (Billy Connolly).</P>
<P>   In "A Night at the Opera," every scene worked, but in "The
Imposters," only a few spectacles catch fire.  A shipboard
romance between the depressive Emily (Hope Davis) and the
suicidal Happy Franks is both funny and touching, while the
carrying out of the First Mate's revolutionary plan is just plain
silly.  Best of all is Campbell Scott as the precise Teuton
frustrated by his inability to get anywhere with Lily--who is in
love with the handsome young cohort of actor Jeremy Burtom,
Marco (Matt McGrath). On the whole, though, "The Imposters"
looks more like a rough sketch for a series of vaudevillian
skits than a well-planned conception.</P>
