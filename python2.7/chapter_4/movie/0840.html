<PRE>                                    AVALON
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1990 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     AVALON is the third in Barry Levinson's Baltimore trilogy, which
began with DINER and continued with TIN MEN.  What links the three
movies is setting (Baltimore), time (late 40's to early 60's), and
feeling (love, compassion, sadness, nostalgia, &c).</P>
<P>     They are very personal films and in some ways AVALON is the most
personal of them all.  The title is the name of a street in the
row-house neighborhoods of working-class Baltimore.  And a ball room.
(And maybe all that Arthurian stuff lurking in the background.  Now I
once lived on Santa Catalina Island and Avalon brings up memories of a
slightly different for me, but that's my movie, ain't it?)</P>
<P>     AVALON is one those multigenerational movies that jumps a lot of
decades, jumbles up a lot of characters, and is often a disorganized
mess.  Fortunately, in this case, Levinson uses several devices to hold
the movie together, even though it is still too long and unfocused.  One
device is the narrative focus, which is primarily the character of Sam
Kripinsky, who "came to America in 1914."  It was the most beautiful
place" he had ever seen (to quote Sam's oft-repeated story.  Sam goes
from a young man in the prime of his youth all the way through a
semi-senile oldster waiting to die.  Sam is played by Armin
Stahl-Mueller and brilliantly; his wife is wonderful and hilarious Joan
Plowright, who was the major delight in another movie this year as the
mother-in-law of the philanderer whom everyone is out to kill (can't
dredge it up, sorry!).</P>
<P>     Another device for unity is the return through the decades to those
most American of holidays, the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.  The
changing face of America is clearest is the changing faces of these
holidays.  And it's pretty sad, I must say.</P>
<P>     The third device is TV.  Once the first TV set is turned on, there
is a set in every room, it seems, these play out their lives in.</P>
<P>     This is a sweet, powerful movie about who we Americans are and how
we got this fucked up.</P>
