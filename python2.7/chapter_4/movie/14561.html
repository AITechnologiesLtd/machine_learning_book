<P>Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>The Ronin were a group of shamed samurai in feudal Japan who sold their
services after the death of their slain master.  With _Ronin_ (**1/2),
director John Frankenheimer and writers J.D. Zeik and Richard Weisz
attempt a modern-day take on the concept, but whatever historical
comparison they intended to make seems to have been lost in all the noise
and spectacle of what is an otherwise enjoyable distraction of a movie. </P>
<P>The Ronin in this tale are a group of mercenaries who have been assembled
to retrieve a silver suitcase somewhere in France.  The operatives are
strangers to each other and to their employer, and don't even know the
contents of the case they are chasing after.  This premise is intriguing,
but the movie quickly reveals itself for the high-class escapist junk
we've already seen in umpteen James Bond movies.</P>
<P>To make up for the deficits in character and plotting, Frankenheimer
throws in some excellent high-speed car chases, arguably the best thing
about the movie. The labyrinthine streets of France become the world's
biggest Hot Wheels Playset, complete with statuesque roundabouts, loopy
turns, and of course, bins full of seafood for the smashing. These
sequences, showcasing grand cityscapes and killer mountain roads, are
deftly executed adrenaline rushes, at least worthy of your local
second-run theater's admission price. </P>
<P>It is to Robert DeNiro's credit that he is able to block our view of the
derivative story line on his own for about half an hour before we begin to
suspect something is afoot. As the shadowy soldier-of-fortune Sam, DeNiro
is charismatic and cool, able to assault someone with something as simple
as a strategically-placed cup of coffee.  By necessity and by design, Sam
assumes the role as the group's strategist, uniting the ragtag bunch into
a competent team.</P>
<P>The other Ronin are not quite as well-drawn.  Natascha McElhone (_The
Truman Show_), as a former terrorist, is the next most interesting member
of the group, displaying a dichotomy of toughness and sensitivity.  Actors
Sean Bean(_Goldeneye_) and Jean Reno (_The Professional_) fill out the
rest of the team with vivid, if routine, performances.  As their icy
nemeses, fine thespians Jonathan Pryce and Stellan Skarsgard seem to serve
no purpose except to stuff the roster with more actors with foreign
accents.  The film stifles the acting skills of most of its talent, then
commits the unforgivable offense of asking the audience to sit back and
accept the characters' lack of knowable motivation or sympathizability.</P>
<P>The writers have gone through the conceit of making their story as layered
as possible, but alas, the facade is all too transparent.  "Intelligent" 
appears to have been confused with "incomprehensible," as _Ronin_ jumps
from one scene to the next without quite making clear what was so
important about the scene before. The questions pile up, only to be wiped
away cleanly by another exhilarating car chase which literally kills off
those loose ends.  A warning to the unsuspecting movie-goer: any attempt
to sort out who is loyal to whom in this story may cause severe cerebral
hemorrhage.  Don't think.  Just wait for the car chases. </P>
<P>Rather than give us too little opportunity for introspection (as is the
case in many modern films), _Ronin_ gives us too much, so that the overall
scheme of the film resembles nothing so much as a box bull of blank jigsaw
puzzle pieces. </P>
