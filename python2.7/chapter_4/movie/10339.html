<PRE>Dead End (1937)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 86</PRE>
<P>"Dead End" is an excellent adaptation of the Broadway play
about the troubled lives of the poor in New York City.</P>
<P>"Dead End" weaves three story lines.  The most important
features a gang of delinquent kids, trying to act tough
and on their way to reform school.  Their dialects and
dialogue is very entertaining, especially when they mock
their wealthy neighbors.  The Dead End Kids ended up with
their own movie contract, which lasted for years through
films that declined into the Bowery Boys series.</P>
<P>The second storyline stars Humphrey Bogart as a killer
on the lam returning to his hometown to visit his mother
and old girlfriend (Claire Trevor).  Bogart had a great 
tough guy voice, and again plays a gangster, something he 
did often prior to "Casablanca."  Trivia: this is one of 
two Bogart films where his character has had plastic surgery
to disguise his appearance.  Can you name the other one?  
The answer is at the end of this review.</P>
<P>The third storyline is inevitable but not as interesting.
Joel McCrae must choose between two girlfriends, a wealthy
blonde and a somewhat whiny brunette.  Naturally, he ends up 
choosing the more attractive of the two.  McCrae's character
is not wholly credible, and temporarily changes from
laconic leading man to action hero when the plot demands
punishment for Bogie.  Fortunately, the Dead End Kids
get much more screentime.</P>
<PRE>Trivia answer: "Dark Passage".</PRE>
