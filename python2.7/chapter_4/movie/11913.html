<P>This awesome epic, recently re-released in letterbox format after a loving 
restoration, is simply one of the most greatest movies ever made.  Not 
merely a great epic, this is a painting whose tremendous canvas hides a 
universe of hidden detail and subtle symbolism that give the film its oddly 
uncommunicable emotional power.</P>
<P>_Lawrence of Arabia_ is a rather strange epic; indeed, one might 
profitably ask whether it is a heroic epic at all and not simply a very 
long movie about Lawrence of Arabia. There are no redemptive moments in 
_Lawrence of Arabia_, because almost everything Lawrence tries his hand at 
flops.   His dream of Arab freedom is betrayed by his superiors and by his 
disciples.  His death -- a failed attempt to avoid a bicycle while riding a 
motorcycle -- redeems nothing and no one.  His followers melt away as time 
goes on.  His close friends cannot comprehend him, his supporters are using 
him and in the end those around him admire him without understanding him. 
An assurance from Lawrence ("There's enough time.  Go and get another 
one.") is like a death sentence from anyone else.  He is even forced to 
shoot the man he saved from the desert.  And unlike the heroes of _Dr. 
Zhivago_ or _Spartacus_, Lawrence is neither caught up in or the mover of 
great events, he is merely the leader of "a sideshow of a sideshow." </P>
<P>Much of the critical commentary on _Lawrence of Arabia_ has focused on the 
fierce, obsessive acting of Peter O'Toole in the starring role, the 
homosexual overtones of the film's womanless universe and sadomasochism and 
the wondrous directing skill of David Lean in using the desert as the 
backdrop for his story.  But many of the critics have missed the deft hints 
that stitch together what otherwise might be a canvas too big for the 
viewer to take in.  For though the pace of the story is slow, it never 
stops; a great many changes in the characters take place; but none seem 
absurd or unheralded; we empathize with that impossible creature, T. E. 
Lawrence, yet he has not a single monologue.  How can this be?  </P>
<P>The story is not about T. E. Lawrence, and critics who complain that it is 
some kind of (failed) psychological exploration of Lawrence's life a la 
_Citizen Kane_ have missed the boat. The film tells the story of another 
person, half-legend, half-autochthonic creation of a godlike will, Lawrence 
of Arabia.  Lawrence of Arabia does not even have a first name; his 
parentage is uncertain and we are told again and again that he is a man who 
may create himself.  Regardless of who is doing the talking, he is 
invariably addressed as "Lawrence." Further, we are never permitted to see 
him alone. Whenever Lawrence is on the screen, he is with someone, and we 
know him only through the eyes of his disciples, as if Lean were some 
modern-day Luke who had decided to film his gospel rather than jot it down 
in Amharic.  Thus, the commentary at his funeral is not some announcement 
to the moviegoer that we are about to go on a journey into the psyche of a 
hero, but rather, it is a clue to the way in which we will come to know 
Lawrence of Arabia, as much a creation of those around him as he is the 
realization of his own flawed genius.  Lawrence has no past (his dossier 
gives no hint of his extraordinary gifts) and, as we know from the 
beginning, no future.  He wanders through an eternal present made manifest 
both in the vastness of the desert wastes and in the utter lack of 
references to time in the film.  This is compounded by the weird 
rootlessness of Lawrence's universe, whose turbulence is an illusion hiding 
an eternal and unbreakable stability which rests on the pillars of mutual 
hatred and mistrust between Arab and Arab and Turk, and its absence of a 
future, with the British moving in and nary a woman in sight.  </P>
<P>So Lawrence is to become a hero, a prophet even.  And when do we see 
Lawrence awaken as a prophet?  He is ushered into the tent of Feisal and 
there, suddenly begins speaking from the Koran and urging his plans on 
Feisal.  And what are King Feisal's plans?  Why, he dreams of going to 
Damascus!  The Arab revolt is set on the road to Damascus.  Wasn't there 
another man too who became a prophet on his way to Damascus?  Thus we are 
forewarned, in an allusion that is more like an echo than a statement, of 
the fate of Lawrence. At one point Feisal remarks that with Lawrence, 
"mercy is a passion, with me, it is merely good manners.  You may judge 
which is the more reliable." Not just a sample of his suave wit, it 
foreshadows the changes which will take place in Lawrence after his 
experiences in Deraa.  Yet another reason we unquestioningly accept 
Lawrence's transition to sainthood is the allusions to the biblical 
travails of Jesus, as when Lawrence is tormented in the desert by Sherif 
Ali ibn el Kharish (Omar Sharif), then left alone, just as Jesus was, or 
when he brings back a man from the dead, just as Jesus did. And of course, 
the film takes place in the Holy Land, with its powerful associations for 
Westerners, with the Turks for latter-day Romans and the Arabs 
incongruously cast as Jews.  </P>
<P>_Lawrence of Arabia_ is layered with such understated allusions.  As 
Lawrence enters Cairo, whose deafening cacophony and crowds contrast 
harshly with the stillness and solitude of the desert, he is followed by an 
officer on a motorcycle, an officer whose voice we hear but whose face we 
never see.  As he leaves Damascus another man on a motorcycle passes him, 
leaving Lawrence in his dust.  We see him fading away, in the distance.  
Both are linked to the motorcycle which kills Lawrence, and both are 
harbingers of his ultimate doom.  The motorcycles relate to another theme 
whose recurrence helps bind the film together, that of the constant and 
jarring juxtaposition of the world of machines and the world of the desert, 
which almost always results in chaos and death, as when the Turkish planes 
attack Feisal's camp as Lawrence arrives, or the absurd horror of the 
broken trains spilling their mechanical guts across the pristine 
cleanliness of the desert, or the slaughter of the Arabs before the Turkish 
guns at Medina.  Another interesting touch is the strong use of color: the 
Arabs in blue, the British in Khaki, Dryden the diplomat (it goes without 
saying) in gray,  Lawrence always in unearthly white (which gets 
symbolically dirtier as he approaches Cairo after taking Aqaba).  Even when 
Lawrence wears a uniform as he attempts to become an ordinary man after 
Deraa, we can rest assured: the uniform belongs to *another man.* </P>
<P>Another way Lean keeps the movie from sprawling from his grasp is his use 
of the small.  Details provide moments of transcendent clarity, like the 
clanking of kitchen utensils in the Turkish column moments before it is 
wiped out by Lawrence's cutthroats, or Lawrence's goggles hanging from the 
bush after his death.  Muscular personalities, brilliant acting, an 
unforgettable score and an often underappreciated script complete a movie 
of staggering emotional power.  </P>
<P>_Lawrence of Arabia_ is the finest work of an artist of almost terrifying 
skill.  No greater homage can be paid to Lean than to say that he made a 
sweeping film which is almost too subtle to understand, yet so powerful 
that it does not need to be understood.</P>
