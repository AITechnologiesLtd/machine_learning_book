<PRE>THE MUMMY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Stephen Sommers, the writer and director of last year's universally panned
DEEP RISING, is back again.  This time he unleashes a cinematic plague on
his audiences with THE MUMMY, a lame INDIANA JONES wannabe.</P>
<P>A remake in name only of the 1932 Boris Karloff classic, THE MUMMY features
a host of gross and frightening special effects.  The movie never figures
out what it wants to be when it grows up.  It is alternately: a parody, an
adventure, a horror movie and an old fashioned B movie.  Universal had the
project in development for years before they gave it to Sommers.  They
should have waited for a better script and director.</P>
<P>Sommers's script, which is filled with logical gaps, is so confusing that
you begin to wonder if the print has missing hieroglyphic subtitles.
Certainly the story can be exasperatingly baffling, as if it were not
intended that mere mortals should be able to follow it.</P>
<P>The plot has to do with a high priest who was mummified alive after being
caught red-handed with the pharaoh's sweetheart.   More formally addressed
as Imhotep, High priest of Osiris (Arnold Vosloo), the Mummy comes back from
the dead in 1923 and unleashes plagues on the world.  This all happens
because an Indiana Jones character called Rick O'Connell goes looking for
treasure where the Mummy sleeps.  Never disturb a man resting comfortably in
his sarcophagus.</P>
<P>The only potentially promising part of the movie is the casting of Brendan
Fraser as Rick.  Fraser, who has delivered strong performances in every film
he has made until now, isn't the least bit interesting in THE MUMMY.
Miscast in an underwritten role, he never figures out what to do with his
character.</P>
<P>Cast opposite Fraser is Rachel Weisz as librarian and Egyptologist Evelyn
and SLIDING DOORS's John Hannah as her imbecilic brother Jonathan.</P>
<P>If any of the characters were worth caring about or possessed any depth, the
story might have a chance.  But the script plays like an outline that was
never filled in.</P>
<P>A few parts of the movie do come alive with a little spark of intelligence.
A drunken Evelyn tries to explain what she is doing in such a dangerous
situation.  "I know what you're asking," she tells Rick.  "How did a country
like this get in a girl like you?" The beauty of this seemingly mixed up
line is that it is precisely what she means.</P>
<P>Another episode that demonstrates some charm shows a terrified man trying to
save himself from the attacking Mummy, who looks like a creature from ALIENS
with a bad set of dentures.  Holding up a series of icons from a cross to a
Star of David, he's willing to profess belief in whatever religion will
protect him from the monster.</P>
<P>"We are in serious trouble," says Rick to his fellow treasure hunters.  "We
are in very serious trouble." And so are you if you're unlucky enough to
find yourself stuck in a theater playing this movie.  The picture deserves
its own mummification.</P>
<P>THE MUMMY runs too long at 2:08.  It is rated PG-13 for gross and
frightening images that will scare kids prone to nightmares.  For those with
strong stomachs, the film would be acceptable for those 12 and up.</P>
