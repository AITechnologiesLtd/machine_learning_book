<P>starring Christopher Walken, Jay Mohr, Dennis Leary, Sean Patrick
Flannery
written and directed by Peter O'Fallon</P>
<P>Walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four
bratty rich kids.  It seems that a woman has also been kidnapped--she
is the sister of one of them (E.T.'s Henry Thomas) and the girlfriend
of another (Flannery)--and the asking price is $2 million, which said
snots are unable to cough up alone. They even cut off Walken's finger
to show they mean business, because they are desperate to save the
woman's life.</P>
<P>Suicide Kings is a terrible film. Walken aside, there isn't a single
appealing cast member. O'Fallon creates characters that are functional
types without any resonance. In an amusingly unironic scene, Walken
plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their
personalities to a tee--it's as if he was reading the summary sheet
for a casting director.</P>
<P>The plot is another issue entirely. O'Fallon is someone whom I'm
betting has seen Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects too many times,
for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence
they never return (do we really need the scene where Dennis Leary
beats up an abusive father with a toaster, which is entirely unrelated
to both the story and Leary's character, or the numerous anecdotal
sequences?), but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess, filled
with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses...  By the fourth
big revelation/twist, I had completely tuned out, wondering what on
Earth attracted these actors to the material.</P>
<P>Recently a peer, a fellow young filmmaker, informed me that he had an
idea for a movie about four guys, the mob, and the FBI. It occurred to
me then what's wrong with indies like Suicide Kings: I suspect
O'Fallon has never met a mobster, is not a rich man, doesn't deliver
endless "clever" monologues to his friends about his favourite types
of boots... In short, these guys are just riffing on other movies, and
in doing that, making the same film over and over and over
again. Tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of GenXers with
movie cameras are trying to find Tarantino's niche instead of carving
their own.  -Reviewed at the Toronto International Film Festival</P>
