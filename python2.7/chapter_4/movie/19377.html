<PRE>
 The Wood (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Taye Diggs, Omar Epps and
Richard T. Jones.</PRE>
<P> "The Wood" is a pleasant, warm comedy about friendship and loyalty.</P>
<P> It is one of those feel-good movies, a nostalgic trip down memory lane
featuring likable characters, nice music and humorous situations.</P>
<P> It also is homogenized and non-threatening. Now that is not a criticism as
much as an observation.</P>
<P> There is no real dramatic tension in "The Wood" because it is a story
involving regular people in ordinary situations.</P>
<P> It is a movie you just sit back, observe and enjoy.</P>
<P> The crux of the story centers on Roland (Taye Diggs) on the day he is to
be married. Three hours before the ceremony, the groom turns up missing.</P>
<P> Sent to find him and bring him to his senses are his oldest friends, Mike
(Omar Epps) and Slim (Richard T. Jones). The pair find Roland drunk at the
home of an old girlfriend.</P>
<P> As his friends drive him around in order to sober him up, various locales
around the 'Wood - the nickname for their home, Inglewood, Calif. -
rekindle memories and episodes from their adolescence.</P>
<P> The trio first met during junior high school. Mike, recently arrived from
North Carolina, hooks up with Roland and Slim, who immediately get the new
kid in trouble. They dare him to pinch the behind of Alicia, the prettiest
girl in the school.</P>
<P> While Mike gets slapped around for his pains. it also is the beginning of
a friendship that as the years progress develops into something deeper and
more personal.</P>
<P> "The Wood" is a positive movie. No gang-bangers and no drugs - except for
one sequence in which a young man smokes a joint. It presents a slice of
black life that few mainstream Hollywood studios would invest money into
examining.</P>
<P> The three main actors give strong performances. Diggs, who made his debut
as Angela Bassett's lover in "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" and was
featured earlier this year in the comedy, "Go," is confused and nervous as
the uncertain groom.</P>
<P> Epps' Mike is the level-headed member of the trio who, despite failures in
his own love life, helps his friend determine his future.</P>
<P> Jones, who co-starred in last year's failed Steven Bochco TV series,
"Brooklyn South", is the mouthy, hot-headed fellow, who easily becomes
frustrated. At times all he wants to do is slap some sense into his friend.</P>
<P> The three younger actors who play Roland, Mike and Slim as teen-agers -
Trent Cameron, Sean Nelson and Duane Finley - also exude that cameraderie.</P>
<P> "The Wood" is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
Finger-snapping music, a warm and humorous series of vignettes and a group
of people you wouldn't mind associating with make "The Wood" a friendly
place to visit.</P>
