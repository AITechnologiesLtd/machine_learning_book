Laura (1944)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 83</PRE>
<P>"Laura" is a highly entertaining murder mystery.  Well directed
and scripted, with several surprise plot twists, it rarely
drags, and survives many improbable sequences.</P>
<P>Laura (Gene Tierney) is an attractive, successful young woman 
who has been murdered.  The primary suspects are her suitors: 
conceited, sneering columnist Clifton WebbX and opportunistic 
ladies man Vincent Price.  Dana Andrews plays the police detective
who becomes obsessed with solving the case.  Further complicating 
matters, Price has two other girlfriends, and, well...
better not say anymore!</P>
<P>After seeing Price ham it up in endless horror movies, he
appears miscast playing a hearthrob.  It must be remembered
that audiences in 1944 had never seen him in any of those
movies.  Still, with unmistakable affected voice and manner,
it is difficult to believe two lovely models and a wealthy
spinster would be falling all over him, despite their better
judgement.</P>
<P>Clifton Webb's character is the most interesting.  Considered 
a great wit, he is in fact insecure and frail.  He is fixated 
with keeping Tierney as a potential girlfriend, never admitting
to himself that he is too old for her and she will sooner or
later take someone else.  Still, he hangs about her, shooing
off paramours, and if one lingers, pries into his affairs
for dirt to prove him unworthy of her.  All his fame and success
means nothing to him, and he will throw it all away if he
can't have her.  He gets more screen time than anyone, but
only has third billing.  I guess movie audiences would rather
see Tierney and Andrews, who are more physically attractive.</P>
<P>There are many silly moments in "Laura".  In no manner should
this movie's plot be compared with an actual murder investigation.
But if the characters don't behave like real people would in
their situations, they do behave consistently.  And they
are all very entertaining.</P>
