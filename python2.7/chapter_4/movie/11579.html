<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>One of the ironies of the late 20th century -- when the news of the world   
is only a click of the remote away and politics is in our living room   
every night -- is that all that information threatens to drown us.  The   
news can come to seem meaningless, and the political events that affect   
the lives of millions of people often seem frighteningly abstract.  One   
function art can serve -- even in such a pop art form as film -- is to   
humanize those events for us, to make them real, to restore our ability   
to care about them.</P>
<P>That's what IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER does for us, beginning with its   
opening sequence -- the explosion in a Guildford pub that sets the story   
in motion.  The camera shows us some young men and women entering the   
pub, chuckling and laughing.  We linger on this happy scene for a   
heartbeat -- and then, just as the explosion tears the
place apart, the camera cuts to a shot of a young woman's purse.  An   
ordinary object in the midst of extraordinary events, that purse   
humanizes the explosion and sets the tone for the entire film.</P>
<P>The film then skips ahead fifteen years to Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson,   
in a small but important role), an attorney handling an appeal for the   
Irish convicted of that bombing.  We begin to get the story as told to   
her by Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), who has already served fifteen   
years of a life sentence.  Gerry's story is told to us in flashback,   
beginning with his late adolescence in Belfast, circa 1974.  The   
political climate is hot in the city, with tanks in the streets and   
soldiers everywhere.  Gerry is just a kid (looking a little old for his   
age -- makeup and fine acting can only go so far) who, exposed to more   
bad influences than any rebellious youth could resist, has turned to   
petty crime, stealing scrap metal, trying to dodge both the British Army   
and IRA militias.  After Gerry inadvertently provokes a minor riot and   
seriously irritates the IRA, his father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite),   
decides it's time to send the boy away -- to London, away from the   
horrific scene that is Belfast.  Gerry isn't troubled by this -- it's a   
chance to score some dope, meet some hippies, and hang out.</P>
<P>Gerry is definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time, however.   
 London is turning into a hot zone in its own right, and it's Gerry's   
misfortune to leave London to return to England shortly after the   
Guildford bomb explodes  -- which, to the British, makes him the obvious   
suspect.  He, his associates, and his family are arrested and convicted   
of the bombing -- despite their protests that they are "not political."   
 Gerry takes up residence in a maximum security cell with his father.</P>
<P>It's this time dwelling in prison that takes up most of the film and that   
packs the real emotional and narrative muscle.  Day-Lewis and   
Postlethwaite both deliver phenomenal performances and generate some   
extraordinary screen chemistry.  Of course, they have a good scenario and   
script to work with; for what makes this film unusual is its willingness   
to step back from the political heat that places these two in prison and   
take a serious look at their relationship, which is complex, as   
father-son relations often are.  Gerry loves his father and yet hates him   
for his frailty; Giuseppe loves his son but is angered and disappointed   
by his rebelliousness and immaturity.  What makes this film distinctive   
is that it is not really a political or legal thriller, although it has   
the makings of either, or both.  Instead, director Jim Sheridan (who also   
co-adapted the screenplay) puts the emphasis on Gerry's development from   
a hippie teenager into a full-grown man.</P>
<P>It's rare to see real character development in a film, and a lesser actor   
than Day-Lewis might not have been able to pull it off.  Lewis went to   
extraordinary lengths for the role, (as he always does); he starved   
himself and had himself interrogated by a real police officer to prepare.   
 How much these antics really help I'm not sure, but I do know that   
Day-Lewis is one of the finest craftsman-actors going; rather than   
allowing his presence and charisma to carry him through (and he has   
plenty of both), he manipulates his face, his voice, and his posture to   
show us what it's like for a young Irish thief to be forcibly politicized   
and aged.  Postlethwaite's role is somewhat less demanding, but is   
handled with equal skill; with his portrayal of Giuseppe he shows us a   
man who claims his dignity in spite of his weakness, and makes us ask   
legitimately what it means to be a coward, and what it means to be a   
hero.</P>
<P>And yet, the film never forgets its politics.  In fact, the very human   
drama in the cell could be taken as an endorsement of a certain kind of   
political rebellion; of righteous anger tempered by reason and the rule   
of law.  But thanks to the skill of the directors and the cast, that sort   
of metaphor is swamped by the human-scale story at the center of the   
film.  It's a fine piece of work; don't miss it.</P>
