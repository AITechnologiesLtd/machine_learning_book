<PRE>                                  AWAKENINGS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     Penny Marshall, the director of AWAKENINGS, has a way with actors,
as anyone who has seen BIG will attest.  The actors in this case are
Robin Williams as a painfully shy doctor in a so-called chronic hospital
in the Bronx, Robert De Niro as one of his patients whom he awakens from
a decades-long "absence," Julie Kavner as Williams' nurse and supporter,
an ensemble of wonderful character actors as other patients, and finally
real-life patients in a real-life hospital.</P>
<P>     The hospital is not ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; sadism and
power are not the problems when Williams shows up, albeit reluctantly,
as the new doc-on-the-block.  The problem is routine, lack of curiosity,
acceptance of the received wisdom about warehousing the chronics,
presumably untreatable victims of unknowable mental disorders.  John
Heard puts in an appearance as the stern, slightly cynical head doctor,
whose job, it seems, is to rain on everyone's parade.  (This is the same
John Heard who played a similarly grim therapist in the Dyan Cannon
movie I saw in previews earlier this last week.)</P>
<P>     This is a movie that I think will stay with one for a long time
because the story is so intriguing and the performances so strong.
Williams discovers by accident that a group of patients who appear to
totally out of communication with our world are maintaining slender
threads of contact.  He deduces a connection with an encephalitis
epidemic in the 1920s and a possible cure in a new drug, L-DOPA (this
being 1969).  Williams experiments on De Niro, who awakens to find that
30 years of his life have disappeared.  There is much of interest in the
reactions of the patient and the family to this situation, the loving
mother who doesn't really want her little boy to not need her, the man
who finds that his family has disappeared in various way while he was
"away," and so forth.</P>
<P>     Williams plays against type and plays very well, with hardly any of
his comic persona peeping through.  He is never given a chance to
extemporize, a la GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM, and turns an understated,
disciplined performance.  (Julie Kavner, his nurse, is her reliably
wonderful self, just as we've seen in so many Woody Allen movies and 
elsewhere; but she is pretty much playing her same stock character,
delightful as it is, in contrast to Williams.)</P>
<P>     De Niro turns an amazingly detailed performance in a highly
physical role of a man once total rigid like a statue, then gradually
loosening up, learning to move again, then as the cure wears off,
developing alarming tics and contortions of a body out of control.  The
only problem with De Niro's performance is that is De Niro, who may be
too familiar a talent for us ever to forget that this is De Niro turning
in another Oscar-nomination performance.</P>
<P>     Some of the character actors that I would like mention en passant
include Anne Meara, who was once, I believe, a stand-up comic, the late
Dexter Gordon as the patient who will not or cannot speak except through
his piano playing, and a particularly splendid Alice Drummond who has
one of the best lines in the movie about knowing that the year is 1969
but needing it to be 1926 (the year she "went to sleep").</P>
<P>     Some have complained that the movie suffers from an unnatural
symmetry with De Niro trapped in his body and Williams trapped in his
shyness and the two of them awakening to life, trying to help each
other.  I find this to be a thematic strength in the movie, the kind of
quality that raises it above the disease-of-the-month club.  It gives
the movie meaning and resonance for all of us with message of
appreciating life and having the courage to fight for it, a message not
that different from the carpe diem theme of DEAD POETS SOCIETY, Robin
Williams' second best movie to date.</P>
<P>     I recommend AWAKENINGS.  It is a strange and haunting story,
excellently presented.  You will very likely want to see more than once
in fact.</P>
