<P>GIRL ON THE BRIDGE (La Fille Sur Le Pont)</P>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Paramount Classics
 Director: Patrice Leconte
 Writer:  Serge Frydman
 Cast: Vanessa Paradis, Daniel Auteuil</PRE>
<P>   Someone once said that there are only six stories in all the
world for novelists and playwrights and filmmakers to deal
with.  Without much doubt, the principal one is the ancient
tale of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl gets boy.  But of
course the theme is not what's important in the construction
of a film: the style with which the motif is presented is, and
lest we get into a discussion of the relative merit of style and
substance, let's say that style IS substance.  If you're looking
for a boy-girl story told with technique to spare, take a look at
Patrice Leconte's "Girl on the Bridge," which could be
dismissed by its detractors as a cute but silly story but is, on
the contrary, one which I cannot recommend highly enough
save for a single flaw.  Since "Girl on the Bridge" is a fable, a
fairy tale that features elements of both "Cinderella" and
"Pygmalion," its director, Patrice Laconte has proffered the
story in black-and-white photography to symbolize its
timelessness and perhaps to suggest a Truffaut-like
ambience.  Mistake. Big mistake.  Not only do the white
subtitles become unreadable against a white background (not
a problem for the French-speaking New York publicist but a
major one for the non-Francophones in the audience), but
more important the audience is likely to get the impression
that Leconte is being either too cheap to use color or just
plain pretentious.</P>
<P>  The shame of it all is that "Girl on the Bridge" is so
absorbing that maybe even Woody Allen would give his
imprimatur to have a new, colorized version made of the
parable.  Rarely do two actors convey such chemistry with
each other as do Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis, all the
more significant considering the age difference: the 28-year-
old Paradis performs in the role of a child-like beauty of 22
while the Algerian-born Auteuil, at age 50, makes a strong
presence as an unusual man who is ten years his junior.  But
the burning desire of these two people so different in ages is
just one of the unusual aspects of the movie.  For one thing,
the sensuality of this singular couple is evoked largely from
the particular that they do not consummate their mutual
desire, at least not with each other. For another, bless Mr.
Laconte for breaking with the French tradition of films that
talk talk and talk some more--all the stranger since his
remarkable costume drama "Ridicule" was, like G.B. Shaw's
"Pygmalion," all about how one's social position among the
upper orders is determined by how well, with how much wit,
you speak.</P>
<P>   Filmed on location in Paris, the French Riviera, Monaco,
Italy and Istanbul, "Girl on the Bridge" joins girl and boy on
an overpass above the Seine in Paris, the scene of an
impending suicide jump--but not before Leconte gets
considerable exposition out of the way by presenting Adele
(Vanessa Paradis) as the subject of a psychiatric interview
before an audience of professionals presumably studying
depression.  An unusual stranger, Gabor (Daniel Auteuil),
convinces her to curb her suicidal impulse, whereupon like a
modern Prince Charming he converts the down-and-out but 
attractive naif into Pretty Woman, making her the target of his
knife-throwing act and boosting her self-image by showing
her how the receiver of the blades and not the hurler is the
all-important person.  </P>
<P>   The more we watch Gabor's daring and skillful knife-
throwing act--in carnivals situated in the South of France and
Italy--the more we feel the eroticism that the enactment
evokes, one which makes the young woman even more
susceptible to the carnal intentions if the handsome men
surrounding her.  In the movie's one ham-fisted metaphor,
Gabor exhibits a magic trick in which he converts a monetary
bill which has been torn in half into a single unit.  Neither half
is worth a thing without the other.  But just as you cannot
paste up a torn dollar with half a Deutschmark if you want the
bill to have any value, you must find the right person with
whom to bond.  "Girl on the Bridge" seems to validate the
fantasy that there's only one true love for each of us, but
Leconte draws us into this most romantic of illusions so deftly
that only the most hard-hearted in the audience can leave the
auditorium snickering.</P>
