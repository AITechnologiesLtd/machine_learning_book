<PRE>Candy (1968) 115m.</PRE>
<P>Oh, those 60s.  Extravagant version of the novel by Terry Southern and Mason 
Hoffenberg is a lot of fun when seen with an audience in a theater; on 
television it may seem fairly pointless.  It has great curio value because 
it is so patently a product of its time - witness its wild editing, camp 
atmosphere, and rock soundtrack.  But more importantly notice its 
playfulness - we really don't care that the entire film crew is reflected in 
a giant mirror near the end, because it seems so appropriate for the era.  
At a time when directors and actors were turning the lens back on to 
themselves to deliberately break through the 'fourth wall' of the cinema and 
remind us all that 'it's only a movie' it was inevitable that several 60s 
productions would turn out embarrassingly trite or pretentious.  Not so 
CANDY - like its heroine it is infused with a sense of reckless innocence.  
Sure, it's self-indulgent and paints its satire with a broad brush, but if 
anything it's even more fun to watch now than it was in its own time.</P>
<P>Both novel and film are slim reworkings of Voltaire's 'Candide', which dealt 
with the misadventures of a youth in a society of dubious philosophy, 
religion, and morality.  The update is irrelevant for the film experience - 
as a screenplay CANDY could have been invented purely for the cinema (it 
certainly had to abandon the more pornographic elements of the book).  
Swedish teenager Ewa Aulin plays the title character in a suitably vacant 
manner (it's hard to tell whether she can act or not because she is only 
given one sentence at a time, and it is nearly always a reaction or a 
question); consequently it's easy to pass over how well she fits the role.  
She really does capture an oblivious aspect of Candy that prevents us from 
being truly annoyed with her.  It's just as well, because take a look at who 
she's up against - a bombastic, lecherous Richard Burton, an egotistical, 
lecherous James Coburn, and guru-like, lecherous Marlon Brando.  Throw in 
John Astin, Ringo Starr, Walter Matthew (all lecherous) and a few extras 
including an Italian director and a hunchback, and you'll see that Candy 
barely manages to get a word in edgewise.  At the time of  CANDY's release 
some critics saw the involvement of big-name stars as an embarrassment worth 
celebrating in their columns, but as is most often the case with such things 
the film has endured while the notices have been forgotten - modern 
audiences don't mind seeing Brando and Burton play-acting instead of method 
acting.</P>
<P>Of course, Candy is no spokesperson for any women's movement, and with very 
little correlation between her constant disrobing and the story's  satirical 
comment (against the military, the police, the literati, religion, the 
medical profession, and even film-making) she appears as a very doubtful 
heroine indeed.  In some ways she is like BARBARELLA (also released in 1968, 
and with a screenplay by Southern) and the cosmic visions that open and 
close the film allude to her as a traveler through space and time, 
journeying from one outlandish event to another, sampling each in turn.  For 
this reason I don't see Aulin's Candy as being a victim but rather an 
observer - most importantly, she appears unchanged by any of her liaisons 
except the last, at which point she has seen enough and transcends her own 
status of a character, almost literally walking out of her own movie to find 
re-invention elsewhere.  Is Candy an extra-terrestrial visitor?  It would 
explain her naiveté but not her background - unless her family and school 
are also fabrications.   Fortunately such speculation is brushed over 
lightly, sidestepping likely charges of pretension against the film (I don't 
know if this idea is presented in the novel).  This is less brain candy than 
it is eye candy.  It would make a good double bill with THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN, 
if only because of the involvement of Ringo and Southern in both, but then 
again that might be a tad too much for one sitting!  Energetically directed 
by Christian Marquand.  It looks and sounds great in a cinema, so watch for 
prints in revival houses.</P>
