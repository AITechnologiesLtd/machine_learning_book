<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The cowboys of the Old West ride again in this tried and proven Western
tale from Clint Eastwood. It's the saga about a lone mysterious man
representing 'good' fighting the forces of 'evil,' taking up sides with
those who don't have the strength or courage to stand on their own, and
when he wins he rides off into the sunset by his lonesome self,
stoically ignoring what he hears in the distance -- an attractive young
hero-worshipping girl crying out that she loves him. This theme has been
done better many times before and in a superior way in such films as
"Shane (53)" and in Clint's own "High Plains Drifter (72)." This film
adds little to the genre, except it is a visually stunning film as
photographed by Bruce Surtees and Clint's heroics are enjoyable to
watch, as he unabashedly brings back many of the Western's classic
confrontational scenes, such as the showdown on Main Street and of the
helpless man made to dance as the gunslingers fire away at his feet.
Otherwise, this is a somewhat disappointing venture, not because it
isn't well-acted or directed, but because it is so stale that it becomes
uninvolving.</P>
<P>A big mine company is feuding with a motley group of independent
prospectors, who have a legal claim to the one place in this small
California town's territory that they don't own, Carbon Valley. In an
attempt to get rid of them so that they could employ their hydraulic
mining operation to rape the entire valley of all its natural resources,
the mine owner harasses them at their camp site and their hired thugs
beat them up if they go to town. In one such raid on the prospector's
quarters, a 15-year-old girl, Megan Wheeler (Penny), watches as her dog
is killed. Burying the dog, she reads from Revelations: "Behold a pale
horse; and his name that sat upon him was Death." She further prays for
a miracle and in the next shot the preacher (Eastwood) rides down from
the hills.</P>
<P>Needing supplies, the boyfriend of Megan's mother, Hull Barret (Michael
Moriarty), rides into town alone, and when he comes out of the general
store he is attacked by the thugs who work for the mine owner Coy LaHood
(Dyson). Silently, the preacher appears in town and then disappears as
if he were a ghost. He is then seen picking up a hickory stick and
smacking it over the gang's heads, avenging the beating they just
administered to Hull. When Hull takes him back to the camp, profusely
thanking him for what he did, his girlfriend Sarah (Carrie) wants him
out, thinking he's a gunman, but when he takes off his coat and she sees
his white collar, she realizes that he's a preacher.</P>
<P>The two women are attracted to him, and the preacher must ward off the
impulsively inclined Megan's advances by telling her that she should
wait for the right guy to come along. It soon becomes clear, after
seeing the preacher's back scarred from numerous bullet wounds, that
he's on a personal mission of revenge.</P>
<P>The twenty or so independent prospectors feel safe with the preacher
around and turn down a chance to sell their claims for a thousand
dollars each to LaHood, as the preacher just tells them what the offer
is without offering his opinion. But LaHood counters by damming up the
creek, thereby preventing them from panhandling and by bringing a
vicious marshal, Stockburn (Russell) and six of his deputy gunmen into
town to force them out.</P>
<P>In a twit about the preacher's rejection of her, Megan takes a ride
along the big mining company's site and the owner's hot-blooded son Josh
(Chris Penn), grabs and tries to rape her just as the preacher comes
along and frees her.</P>
<P>For the climax, Stockburn' men come silently into town. They are a rough
looking bunch of desperadoes, all wearing long dusters, giving the final
shootout, a very recognizable Western touch. The gunman-turned-preacher
has retrieved his gun from storage and goes after the man who almost
killed him once, which results in a classic Western shoot-out.</P>
<P>Clint is once again a nameless drifter, a role he could play blindfolded
by now. It's a fine film for those who don't mind that hero-worshipping
is a good chunk of the plot, and that what was metaphorically hinted at
never develops because of the film's awkward presentation.</P>
