<P>It would be difficult to walk into Hannibal without any preconceived
notions. To begin with, it's only the fourth sequel to a film that won the
Academy Award for Best Picture (even though all but The Godfather, Part II
sucked eggs). Even more rare is the fact that The Silence of the Lambs swept
the five major Oscar categories (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress,
[Adapted] Screenplay) - a feat achieved but twice (1975's One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and 1934's It Happened One Night).</P>
<P>As if that wasn't enough, Hannibal has generated enough dish to be the
leading story on Entertainment Tonight since Thomas Harris' sequel abruptly
surfaced on bookstore shelves in the summer of 1999. The novel was too
gruesome for Lambs' director (Jonathan Demme) and screenwriter (Ted Tally).
Then, producer Dino De Laurentiis (U-571) paid an ungodly amount of money
for the screen rights to the book. Jodie Foster was in, but wanted to be
paid almost as much as Lambs cost to make. Then she was scared off by the
material as well. Her equally important counterpart, Anthony Hopkins, had
recently announced his retirement from film (What's up with that? He was in,
like, four movies last year). The casting nightmares, along with the
critically poor reception of Harris' novel, seemed to doom the project
before it could even begin.</P>
<P>What you can't deny is that Hannibal's assemblage of acting talent is pretty
amazing. Two-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore (Magnolia) replaces Foster as
Clarice Starling, while Hopkins reprises the role that won him a Best Actor
trophy. Gary Oldman, who could see Oscar action for his recent turn in The
Contender, appears here, but is uncredited (and even more unrecognizable).
Even some of the smaller roles, played by folks like Giancarlo Giannini,
have been to Oscar's big dance (for Seven Beauties).</P>
<P>As impressive as that collection of talent is, the technical players are
even more extraordinary. Director Ridley Scott and his Gladiator gang
(cinematographer John Mathieson, editor Pietro Scalia, costume designer
Janty Yates and scoremeister Hans Zimmer) are all likely to receive Oscar
nominations for their action epic just days after Hannibal opens. Ditto
David Mamet (State and Main), who shares a screenwriting credit with
Schindler's List's Oscar winner Steven Zaillian (although, reportedly, Mamet
's draft was scrapped).</P>
<P>So is it any good? It'll depend on what your expectations are. Hannibal is a
really good film, but it's nowhere near as earth-shattering as Lambs. It' s
pretty faithful to the book, although that's not saying much, since the
story seemed to be curiously cobbled together. They're both set 10 years
after Lambs concluded. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter is on the loose in
Tuscany, while Starling is still holding down her gig as an FBI agent.
Hannibal opens with Starling heading a botched raid of a D.C. drug dealer's
hideout. She loses a friend and her credibility, and finds her face splashed
all over the news for the first time since she used Lecter's help to catch
the serial killer knows as Buffalo Bob. She gets busted down to a desk job,
where she obsesses about catching Lecter and takes flack from ex-lover and
Justice Department stuffed shirt Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta).</P>
<P>In the meantime, one Mason Verger (Oldman) is close to flushing Lecter out
of his Italian hiding spot. Verger was Lecter's fourth victim, and the only
one who survived his encounter, but had his face sliced apart for good
measure (think The Grinch sans green fur). He's as rich as they come, and
has been trying to track down Lecter for years, hoping to bring him back to
his Virginia estate for a particularly gruesome farewell. The first half of
the film involves Verger bribing an Italian cop (Giannini) to lead his men
to Lecter. His plan, of course, goes horribly awry, and Lecter heads for the
States to have a showdown with both Verger and Starling. The ending is
excruciating and as gruesome as you've likely heard, but after the gore is
over, its conclusion is different and more pleasing than the one found in
the novel.</P>
<P>Some people may have a problem with the pacing of the film. It's 30 minutes
before you see Lecter properly (not in a flashback, or on video), and the
whole section in Italy takes a while to get moving. But when it does, it's a
thing of beauty. Particularly well done is a scene where Starling tries to
locate Lecter in a crowded area of D.C. while he talks to her on a cell
phone. It's a great cat-and-mouse chase with a surprising ending to those
that haven't read the book. Moore does a capable job as Starling, but Foster
left some pretty big shoes to fill. If they were size 8, Moore is around a
7.</P>
<P>Hannibal was shot in Tuscany, Sardinia, and in and around the D.C. area,
including stops at properties owned by James Madison and the Vanderbilt
family. Like Gladiator, it's a technically slick little film, with
razor-sharp editing and a string-and-opera-heavy score that uses
over-the-top classical music standards to underscore the almost comedic
violence, like Kubrick did with A Clockwork Orange. Complaints are minor,
like the Italians who don't speak Italian (which really makes you appreciate
the authenticity in Traffic), but all of that will be wiped from your memory
after the finale, where Liotta does his best impression of George W. Bush.</P>
<P>2:10 - R for strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language</P>
