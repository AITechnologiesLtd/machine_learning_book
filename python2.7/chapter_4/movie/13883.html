<P>Since 1920 with the release of Douglas Fairbank's classic adventure,
the character of Zorro has been one of the most portrayed characters
in film history. Most people are only familiar with the famed Mexican
hero through the Walt Disney series of 1957 which stared future 'Lost
in Space" dad.. Guy Williams. The character of Zorro has been
portrayed by a wide range of actors and all of them have been
serviceable at the least (with the exception of George Hamilton in the
disappointing 'Zorro, the Gay Blade'). Antonio Banderas is the latest
actor to don the black mask and cape, and the results are enthralling.</P>
<P>The story begins with Zorro rescuing a group of peasants from public
execution. Now this entire is simply a trap set to capture Zorro. But
Zorro is saved, himself by the intervention of two young
brothers. Zorro thanks the boys by giving the oldest a
medallion. Zorro returns home and his true identity of Don Diego de la
Vega. Greeting his wife, he goes to his newborn daughter, Elena and
continues to tell her the legend of the famed Zorro. It is then that
the corrupt Don Rafael Montero invades Don Diego's home.  Now knowing
the true identity of his enemy, Don Rafael fights with Don Diego and
in the course of battle, Esperenza de la Vega (Don Diego's wife) is
killed. Don Diego is arrested and taken to prison. Don Rafael, who was
also in love Esperenza de la Vega takes the child and vows to raise
the girl as his own daughter.</P>
<P>20 years pass. And Mexico has been under oppressive Spanish
rule. Three bandits are ambushed by the local police, Alejandro
Murrieta (Banderas), Joaquin Murrieta (Victor Rivers) and American
expatriate Three Fingered Jack (L.Q. Jones). Joaquin is murdered by
American Captain Harrison Love (Matthew Letscher) during an escape
attempt. Alejandro returns to accept his fate, but not before
retrieving the medallion Joaquin has around his neck, the gift from
Zorro.</P>
<P>Montero returns from Spain with his daughter (?), Elena. Don Diego has
escaped from prison and only stops murdering Montero upon seeing his
now grown child. Alejandro has also managed to escape his captors, and
the two men form a bond. After some deliberation Don Diego accepts
Alejandro as his pupil and tells him the truth about the legend of
Zorro.  After much arduous training, Alejandro takes the cape and the
mask and a new Zorro returns to save the people of Mexico.</P>
<P>Directed with a marvelous eye for style and simplicity, Martin
Campbell ('Goldeneye') pays glorious tribute to the memories of
Michael Curtiz and Douglas Fairbanks. There is nothing in this film
that stands out over itself, drawing attention away from the story and
it's characters. For once we can no longer, honestly say, "They don't
make movies like that anymore", because with this film, they do.. and
they do it triumphantly. The film takes it's time setting up it's plot
of stolen riches, familial debts and blood oaths. Mr. Campbell
deserves full credit for delivering a masterfully composed
film. Scribes John Eskow, Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio have fashioned a
grand tribute to the classic films of the thirties and forties. With
rich and strong character development and expert plotting, 'The Mask
of Zorro' should be a reminder to everyone that a film does not need
millions of dollars of special effects and pyrotechnics to enthrall
them. Good story telling remains, good story telling.</P>
<P>The performances in the film are exemplary. Anthony Hopkins is heroic
as Don Diego do la Vega. Here is a man who is true to his family and
his country and is willing to risk his life for both. His passion for
revenge becomes tempered by the moral conflict of his daughter Elena
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) not knowing him as family. The heartbreak in
Hopkins' eyes as he confronts his Daughter with the truth, is
honest. Mr. Hopkins deserves the title (unashamedly) of greatest
living actor today. Antonio Banderas shows a growing charm and ability
that was only hinted at in "Desperado". His fine turn turn as the
reborn Zorro is so enlivening and glorious that you'll only envision
him as Zorro from now on, the same way as only Christopher Reeve is
Superman and Michael Keaton is Batman. Banderas owns this character.</P>
<P>The real discovery in the film is Catherine Zeta-Jones, previously
only noted for her turn as a paid assassin in the disappointing "The
Phantom". Ms. Jones turns in a marvelously mischievous and seductive
performance as Elena. Her charm and poise throughout the film is
refreshing and gives the entire picture a fresh jolt every time she is
on screen.</P>
<P>Everything about "The Mask of Zorro" cries out in it's goal of pure
entertainment. There is nothing dumbed down for the audience. This is
the truest adventure we've seen since "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Kudos
to all involved. No faint praise in saying that this film will (and
should) become a classic piece of filmaking.</P>
