                          - Richard Crenna</PRE>
<P>     It takes talent to write a movie that's even less impressive than
SHOWGIRLS.  Heaven help us, but original scribe Joe Eszterhas has done
just that.  Hollywood's [choose one: horniest/hairiest/highest-paid]
writer has concocted a "psychological thriller" that's even more absurd
than his last month's appearance on "Larry King Live."  The plot--a
District Attorney caught in a love triangle with a murder suspect--is
so convoluted that even director William Friedkin (THE FRENCH
CONNECTION) is reduced to copying car chases from better movies.  And
you thought killer lesbians were bad?  Try Linda Fiorentino as a
clinical psychologist moonlighting as a high-class hooker!  ["But he
won't take the medicine, Doctor."]</P>
<P>     JADE is a loss and barely worth the breath to balk at.  Like that
other guy, Eszterhas will be acquitted soon enough.  He'll work in this
town again.  (Though maybe no longer without a rewrite!) If there's
*any* fun to be had, it's imagining how the Hirsute One would've
adapted THE SCARLET LETTER.  Let's see ... a blonde Hester Prynne
brutally murders the Reverend Dimmesdale after he discovers her lesbian
love affair with Harriet Hibbins.  For her punishment, she's sold to
the Indians and forced to perform nightly at the New World's newest
nightspot, the Totem Pole.</P>
<P>Who's to say what's a sin in Joe's eyes? </P>
