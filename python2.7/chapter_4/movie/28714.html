<PRE>SCARY MOVIE 2
Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans
With Shawn & Marlon Wayans, Anna Faris
De Vargas     R     99 min.</PRE>
<P>      It must be said of Scary Movie 2 that it is a very fluid 
movie.  Pretty much every fluid that can emerge from the human body does 
emerge from the human body, in living color and copious, screen-filling 
quantities.  There is solid waste as well, and of course the indispensable 
gaseous emissions without which no contemporary American comedy worthy of 
the name would dream of being seen or heard.</P>
<P>In short, Scary Movie 2 has pretty much everything that its 
chart-busting antecedent Scary Movie had except an original idea.  It has 
the same cast, more or less, including those wacky eternal college kids 
Shawn Wayans (30), Marlon Wayans (29), and Tori Spelling (28), and 
including a lot of characters who were killed in the original.  It has the 
same pacing, the same quality of jokes, the same striving tastelessness.</P>
<P>2 opens in a place called Hell House with an Exorcist take-off, which 
offers one of the few mildly amusing moments in the picture: a group of 
middle-aged white people gathered around a piano singing a rap hit.  But 
before we leave Hell House we are treated to dueling vomit, and the sight 
of James Woods (in the role of the Exorcist) straining and performing at 
top volume on the toilet.  It could have been worse.  The role was 
originally intended for Marlon Brando.</P>
<P>We move from there to One Year Later , and pick things up with our 
heroine Cindy (Anna Faris) now in college.  Evil Professor Oldman (Tim 
Curry) and his wheelchair-bound sidekick Dwight (David Cross) have hatched 
a nefarious research project that involves getting the stupidest 
undergraduates on campus to spend the weekend at a haunted house, the same 
Hell House where the opening Exorcist stuff took place, now presided over 
by Hanson (Chris Elliot), a butler with a deformed hand and mind.  This 
serves as a vehicle for a rapid-fire burst of parodies of haunted house 
movies, but Wayans and his team of seven, count em, writers never heard of 
a joke that didn t involve bodily functions, so if you were looking for wit 
with your haunted house mystery spoof, rent the 1976 Neil Simon movie 
Murder by Death.</P>
<P>Much hilarity is wrung from Hanson's deformed hand, and from Dwight's 
wheelchair, and from Tori Spelling performing ghostly fellatio, and from a 
sexually aggressive talking parrot, and from the heroine using the black 
cat's kitty litter box.  A reasonable definition of what is funny might be 
something that makes you laugh, and at the showing I attended, which was 
also attended by a lot of small children, there was the occasional ripple 
of laughter.  The original Scary Movie was the largest-grossing R-rated 
movie in history, so there is undoubtedly an audience for this one 
too.  But if you are literate enough to be reading a newspaper, it probably 
isn't you.</P>
