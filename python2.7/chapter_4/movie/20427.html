Analyze This (*** out of four)
Starring Billy Crystal, Robert De Niro, Joe Viterelli and Lisa Kudrow
Directed by Harold Ramis.
Written by Ken Lonergan (story) and Peter Tola</PRE>
<P>Analyze This is living proof that stereotypes can be amusing in film. Every
character in the movie ‹ each mobster, a psychiatrist and his fiance, the
psychiatrists son and parents, the fiance¹s parents, all of them ‹ are pure
stereotypes. Yet the movie can be at times funny and is overall a good film
worth renting. Audiences know the mob by the movies we watch, not by the
truth of who they are. Analyze This is fun because it takes pleasure in the
stereotypes that past mob films have created.</P>
<P>For the five of you who haven¹t seen it, Robert De Niro is a mob boss who
realizes he has a few psychological problems and is having anxiety attacks.
He seeks out a therapist, Crystal, to help him deal with his problems.
Crystal is hesitant at first, but De Niro is persuasive (in a manner of
speaking - persuasive as only a mafia movie character can be, for example,
he throws Crystal in a shark tank) and Crystal ends up becoming more
involved with De Niro and his organization than he wants to be. Of course,
Crystal has issues of his own to work out and learns to deal with them when
De Niro¹s mafia-matter-a-factness begins rubbing off on Crystal. A side plot
features Crystal getting married while treating De Niro.</P>
<P>Everything in this movie is predictable, yet for some reason I was never
bored or felt cheated. I guess it¹s hard to find a comedy that finds ways to
make people laugh without being mean. Are the stereotypes mean? No, because
making fun of an organization that professionally kills people is, for some
reason, okay.</P>
<P>I imagine that the idea must have come to the writers, while they were
sitting on their therapist¹s couch, that it would a funny if a mob member
went to therapy to work out personal issues. Amazing that a single idea can
create two hours worth of movie. To write the script and come up with the
dialogue, the writers must have sat down and watched every mob movie they
could get their hands on and read Mario Puzo¹s ³The Last Don² six or seven
times. De Niro¹s mafia boss is the epitome of all of the Godfathers and
Goodfellas scrunched into a character. He speaks in cliche (When he
interrupts a party thrown by Crystal ³Hey, why¹s you gotta be mean, I¹m
being nice here,² when  ) and always aware that he¹s supposed to be a mob
boss. He plays it like he knows he¹s acting.</P>
<P>I doubt they researched by actually talking to mob members. That would have
taken too much time, and besides, this isn¹t the kind of movie that requires
that type of research. They use the stereotypes of movies past to their
advantage. Mobsters seem to say ³Fuhgetaboutit² a lot (see Johnny Brasco),
so they have De Niro say it ten times. Mobsters seem to make a point of
eating in dimly lit, crunched up Italian restaurants, so they put a crucial
scene in there (even paying tribute to the Godfather during a bathroom
scene, or maybe it was a tribute to Austin Powers). Mobsters also beat up
and threaten whomever they please, whenever they please. When Mobsters have
a meetings, they like to do it at a warehouse out in the middle of nowhere,
that seems specifically constructed to have Mobster meetings. And of course,
the police are a bunch of idiots, always coming in two minutes too late to
catch the mobsters. All of this does get a little tiresome, but the actors
bring such energy and timing to the material, that it can be forgiven.</P>
<P>Joe Viterelli did such a stand out job playing De Niro¹s faithful bodyguard
Jelly that it would be a shame if he didn¹t receive mention for an
supporting Oscar nomination. Lisa Kudrow, as Crystal¹s fiance, is wasted
here, but at least she¹s pretty to look at. Also, Crystal¹s son seems like a
wasted opportunity.</P>
<P>It seems like I¹m picking out what¹s wrong with Analyze This, but in truth
there are genuinely clever moments, such as Crystal trying to convince De
Niro  to stop crying and fight back during a shoot out. However, Analyze
This isn¹t laugh-out-loud funny. It¹s a blend of violence and humor, that
skates along black comedy at times or farce the next. It¹s a movie made by
veteran actors and producers that have their timing down and have stretched
out a small idea into a two hour popcorn movie.</P>
