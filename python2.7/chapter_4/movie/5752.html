<P>     The "first wave" of beach pictures arrived in the early-to-mid-
'60s.  With titles like BIKINI BEACH and BEACH BLANKET BINGO, these dumb
movies inevitably starred Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, and
appealed to teen-agers.  Some twenty years later, the beach genre was
re-invented for the '80s, with bare breasts and g-strings added to the
mix (the reprehensible 1984 feature, HARDBODIES, was indicative of what
this second generation offered).  Now, in 1996, we have PHAT BEACH to
contend with, and, if anything, it's worse than everything to precede
it.  I just pray this won't revive a category of motion pictures better
left interred.</P>
<P>     A legitimate contender (and, to this point, probable winner) in the
"worst movie of the year" sweepstakes, PHAT BEACH is bad enough that it
would still look terrible amidst all the tripe offered as late night
cable fare.  It's amazing that there are three credited screenwriters,
considering the lack of one humorous, original, or intelligent moment
during the eighty-nine minute running time.  PHAT BEACH has a very
restricted target audience -- young African American males (most of whom
are theoretically too young to be allowed into an R-rated movie).  With
such limited appeal, hopefully this film will disappear quickly.
Ultimately, the soundtrack will probably draw more interest than the
actual movie.</P>
<P>     The story centers on a shy, overweight would-be-poet by the name of
Benny King (Jermaine "Huggy" Hopkins).  Benny is a sensitive teen who
believes in true love and wants to spend his summer enrolled in a
writing class.  His father, however, has different ideas, and makes sure
that Benny gets a job at the local House of Hamburgers fast food joint.
But, when Benny's family goes away on vacation, our hero's best friend,
Durrel (Brian Hooks), entices him away from the straight-and-narrow.
Together, the two head for a Southern California beach with its lure of
women dressed in skimpy bikinis -- or less.  There's also a $10,000
beach volleyball tournament to be won (at least, I think it's beach
volleyball -- the direction and editing are so inept that it's difficult
to be sure), and, coincidentally, Benny has a deadly serve.</P>
<P>     It would be easy, not to mention accurate, to accuse PHAT BEACH of
failing to create believable female characters, but the sad truth is
that there aren't any multi-dimensional people in this film, male or
female.  Even Benny is just a pathetic stereotype.  That said, however,
PHAT BEACH is still guilty of blatant sexism.  This is the
objectification of women at its most offensive.  There are more exposed
buns and thinly-concealed nipples here than in a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
swimsuit issue.  Female characters who actually have spoken lines (as
opposed to just tan lines) don't impress with their wit or eloquence,
although one girl manages a few words in French ("C'est votre monde").
Worse still, the film makers actually appear proud of this, and there's
no evidence that it's being done in an even remotely satirical vein.</P>
<P>     I didn't care about, or for, anyone or anything in this film.  In
fact, I hated just about everyone, especially the incredibly annoying
Durrel, whose comeuppance isn't nearly as nasty as what he deserves.
PHAT BEACH is an atrocious example of mindless cinema -- the kind of bad
movie that doesn't possess a single redeeming feature.  All things
considered, even knowing how awful those '60s beach pictures were, I'd
rather sit through an Avalon/Funicello triple feature than endure a
second showing of something as creatively barren, emotionally stunted,
and generally vile as PHAT BEACH.</P>
