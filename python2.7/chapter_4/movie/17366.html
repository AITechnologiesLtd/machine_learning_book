<P>Patch Adams tells the story of a dedicated and unconventional
doctor who challenged the traditional wisdom of his teachers and
peers.  An idealistic medical student, Hunter "Patch" Adams (Robin
Williams) believed that doctors should treat the patient as well as
the disease.  His views brought him into disfavour with the
establishment, and he clashed many times with the staid and humourless
dean of the medical school (Bob Gunton, best remembered as the
sadistic warden from The Shawshank Redemption), who announces that all
the humanity will be trained out of them.  Adams was a naturally
gifted student, which also attracted the ire of his roommate Mitch
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), who came from a family of doctors and was
determined to succeed.  He resented Adams' frivolous attitude, which
undermined all that he believed in.  But it was Adams' ability to
strike a chord with the patients that led to him risking his
reputation, his career and his future to create an environment in
which the patients were happy and temporarily forgot their pain.  He
eventually set up a free clinic with the help of fellow students
Truman (Daniel London) and Carin (a very Julia-Roberts-like Monica
Potter), which became known as the Gesundheit Institute.  Although
Patch Adams is based on a true story, one wonders how many liberties
the film makers have taken with the facts to accommodate Williams'
normally manic persona.  The real Adams was actually a good twenty
years younger than Williams, who seems uncomfortably aware that here
he is the oldest person on campus.  He was only a teenager when he
checked himself into an asylum to overcome his suicidal tendencies and
discovered his talent for healing people's pain through humour,
understanding and compassion.</P>
<P>Patch Adams is meant to be an inspiring and uplifting film,
but it is also a horribly saccharine, clichéd and cynically
manipulative movie that wears its heart on its sleeve.  It is also a
tad predictable, and most audiences will probably be able to join the
dots of the plot by about midway through.  There is the brutal and
unexpected death that brings on a crisis, a moment of self doubt in
which he questions everything he believes in, and then there is the
final vindication.  The idealistic, wise-cracking maverick who rails
against authority and tradition and becomes an inspirational figure
for many along the way has become something of a cliché in
Williams' repertoire (think Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets' Society
and even Awakenings, etc).</P>
<P>Director Tom Shadyac has previously drawn restrained
performances from normally outrageous comics like Eddie Murphy (The
Nutty Professor) and Jim Carrey (Liar Liar), but he seems unable to
keep his star on a tight leash here.  There are plenty of scenes in
which Williams cuts loose with the sort of energy and seemingly
improvised humour that audiences love and expect.
 Dramatically, Williams is 
also permitted a number of moving and emotional scenes.  His outrageous 
performance dwarfs the 
otherwise solid work of his co-stars, who find themselves lumbered with 
one-dimensional, stereotyped 
characters.  </P>
<P>Patch Adams is a film designed to show case the talents of its
popular star, and fans will find plenty to admire.  Others, not so
enamoured of the outrageous Williams, may find the whole thing a
vaguely unsatisfactory experience.</P>
