<PRE>                        TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        1984's THE TERMINATOR is generally regarded as one of the most
influential films of the '80s, which gives its sequel, TERMINATOR 2:
JUDGEMENT DAY, gigantic shoes to fill.  T2 could have simply been a rehash
of the first film, but, happily, writer-director James Cameron has come up
with an inventive story line which cleverly continues the plot of part one.
Given the sorry state of most sequels, T2 is 100 times more creative--and
more satisfying--than we had any right to expect.  The movie has all the
ingredients of a classic sci-fi thriller, and Cameron combines and seasons
them to near perfection.</P>
<P>        His recipe starts with 215 pounds of prime Schwarzenegger, who
returns triumphantly to his breakthrough role as a devastatingly lethal
cyborg.  Arnold's T-800 model Terminator is back and battle-ready, but this
time he has new programming--a plot twist which breathes new life into the
character and allows Schwarzenegger to give a surprisingly rich
performance.</P>
<P>        Linda Hamilton's character has also undergone radical changes since
the first film, in which she was fairly helpless against the Terminator's
vicious attacks.  It has been ten years since Hamilton first encountered
the cyborg, and in that time she has become tough as nails, amassing
muscles and an arms supply in anticipation of his return.  Hamilton is
remarkably convincing in the gritty role of a disturbed woman desperately
fighting for her life and for her sanity.</P>
<P>        The new spice in the mix is Edward Furlong, who shows natural
charisma as Hamilton's son, the disturbed 12-year-old juvenile-delinquent
who is the assassination target in T2.  Furlong's interactions with
Schwarzenegger give the movie heart, soul and--most
impressively--psychological depth.</P>
<P>        Of course, Cameron's concoction wouldn't be complete without his
special sauce: whirlwind action and new technology.  The movie's amazing
state-of-the-art special effects (which feature the most advanced computer
animation ever captured on celluloid) boggle the mind and dazzle the
senses.  And with his vigorous direction, Cameron clearly reestablishes
himself as the one and only true master of action, even if the tumult is
not quite as intense as it was in the original.</P>
<P>        More than anything, however, it's T2's riveting story line and
unexpected humanity which make it not only a smashing piece of science
fiction, but also one of the year's best films.</P>
