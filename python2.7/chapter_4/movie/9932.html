                       A movie review by Chuck Dowling
                    Copyright 1997  Chuck's Movie Reviews</PRE>
<P>Bean (1997) ** out of ***** - Cast: Rowan Atkinson, Peter MacNichol, Burt
Reynolds, Harris Yulin, Pamela Reed, Larry Drake. Written by: Richard Curtis
and Robin Driscoll. Directed by: Mel Smith. Running Time: 90 minutes.</P>
<P>You would think that this film's dismal failure would be due to American
filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant British comedy and "Americanizing"
it. You'd be wrong, since full blame can be placed on the very folks who
wrote and created the series: Rowan Atkinson, Robin Driscoll, and Richard
Curtis. Should you ever happen to meet those chaps, do me a favor. Grab them
by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear, "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE PHRASE 'IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT'?!" Then walk
away.</P>
<P>The film concerns Mr. Bean (Atkinson) and his visit to America while
escorting the painting of "Whistler's Mother" to an American buyer (played
by Burt Reynolds, in the type of bit part that his success in "Boogie
NIghts" should hopefully do away with). Now how or why Mr. Bean is sent on
this trip makes no sense, and I can't even describe how the film explains
it. The point is that Mr. Bean comes to America and causes wacky trouble.</P>
<P>Problems problems problems, where to begin? First, the score music from the
TV show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one
note away from the score from "Beetlejuice" or one note away from the score
from "Rob Roy". Then, the song choices are totally uninspired. "Good
Vibrations"? "I Love L.A."? Wow, don't put any thought into that guys. Also,
Bean makes WAY too much noise in the film. The character doesn't speak much,
but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience, and
maybe the occasional murmur from Mr. Bean. Each episode was like a Chaplin
silent movie. In the film, Bean is constantly moaning, grunting, whining,
etc. It's annoying, and just plain wrong for the character. The main problem
though is that it's just not funny. With each episode of the series there
would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes.
Multiply that running time by three however, and the laughs steadily
decrease. They even have the gaul to REPEAT jokes from the series. Sad, and
creatively lazy.</P>
<P>As a series, "Mr. Bean" only ran for about 13 episodes or so. Why on earth
did Atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework
everything? 13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn't exhausted all possible
situations. All I can say positively for the film at this point is that it's
almost appropriate for all ages, if it wasn't for a couple of scenes where
it appears as though Mr. Bean is having sex with things. And even that isn't
a very positive statement. Please guys, go back to England and go back to
television so you'll make me laugh again. [PG-13]</P>
