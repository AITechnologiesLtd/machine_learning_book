<PRE>                                   MALLRATS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Well, the long-awaited MALLRATS is here at last, and sadly, the
perfect twentysomething romantic comedy has still yet to be made. 
Writer/director Kevin Smith follows up his hilarious first film, CLERKS,
with this, the second in his so-called New Jersey Trilogy.  It's second
not only in sequence, but a distant also-ran in quality, too.</P>
<P>     MALLRATS tells the story of two mostly-losers, T.S. (Jeremy London)
and Brodie (Jason Lee), who manage to lose and regain their respective
girlfriends, Brandi (Claire Forlani) and Rene (Shannen Doherty), in one
long day at the mall.  Along the way, the pair has a series of big
adventures with cops and security guards, a game show organized by
Brandi's dad (Michael Rooker), comic book creator Stan Lee, and the
returning characters of Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself). 
Where all this was supposed to go, I'm not too sure.  But I *think* it was
supposed to be about relationships, and I think it was supposed to be
funny.</P>
<P>     For the most part, it's not.  Surprisingly, it's Jason Lee (who moves
into his first acting role from a career as a professional *skateboarder*)
who has all the good lines, and those are few and far between.  Gone is
Smith's witty and smartly lascivious dialogue from CLERKS.  Instead, the
MALLRATS script often sounds more like mindless smut with only a few
bright moments of real farcical entertainment.</P>
<P>     MALLRATS probably wouldn't be so painful if I didn't know what Smith
was capable of doing (and with a lot less funding, to boot).  This film
comes off as little more than random bits of plot and failed attempts at
humor:  Doherty parading about in her first appearance outside the 90210
ZIP code, Smith's strange homage to Stan Lee, Silent Bob's magic coat,
slapstick, sex jokes, and a completely inexplicable orangutan.</P>
<P>     I don't know what Smith was thinking when this project came together,
but let's just hope this is just the proverbial Sophomore slump.  Kev, I
know you can do better than this.</P>
