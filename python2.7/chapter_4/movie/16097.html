<PRE>Meet Joe Black
by Curtis Edmonds (<A HREF="mailto:movienation@xoommail.com">movienation@xoommail.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>In the interest of being generous, I want to start this review with the
scene that I liked in Meet Joe Black.  Sir Anthony Hopkins, playing a
super-rich media mogul, has gathered his family around him for dinner.  His
oldest daughter (played by Marcia Gay Harden from Millers Crossing), who
has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party,
presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes, which are supposed
to be scale models for his big birthday cake.</P>
<P>The daughter asks Hopkins to pick the one he likes.  Hopkins, frustrated by
the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair, does what any man in
his position would do:  he punts.  Whichever one you like, dear, he says.
And the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do:  she
cries.</P>
<P>I liked that scene for two reasons.  First, the cakes looked really cool.
Second, it was, perhaps, the only scene in the movie where people acted as
you would expect people to act.  Meet Joe Black is chock-full of odd
performances, people doing things for no discernible reason at all, and
doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot.  It's
easy to watch Meet Joe Black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial
homes and the beauteous Claire Forlani, but it's even easier to sleep right
through it (two people on my row managed it quite nicely).  The difficult
part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and
why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this
overwrought mess.</P>
<P>I know my audience had problems with the movie, because they thought it was
a comedy.  Case in point:  Everyone should know by now that Brad Pitt plays
the Angel of Death in this movie.  However, the first we see of him is as a
young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous Claire Forlani.
(It's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the
Angel of Death, but it makes a certain kind of sense.)  It shouldn't take
long for the observant moviegoer to realize that Bad Things are about to
happen to Mr. Pitt.  And indeed they do (after a hideously prolonged
sequence where Pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating Forlani and
Forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating Pitt), because Pitt walks
into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished.  Well, when that
happened, the audience howled with laughter, and continued to laugh at
every comment that was remotely humorous.  So, if you think that sudden
violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny, I encourage you
to go see Meet Joe Black immediately.</P>
<P>Anyway, the deceased lawyer's body, no worse the wear from its massive
injuries, is possessed by the Angel of Death and Brad Pitt takes over that
role.  The idea is that Death (given the pen name of Joe Black, so as not
to disturb others) wants to take a holiday and experience the world.  If
this weren't Hollywood, we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion
of life and death, but since it is, we get scene after scene of
fish-out-of-water humor, just as if Death is George of the Jungle or
Crocodile Dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the
jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our
society.</P>
<P>It also doesn't help that the character of Death is written so
inconsistently.  He claims to be on vacation, but he never does anything
except hang around the seriously attractive Claire Forlani (just try to get
your travel agent to book that one).  He speaks very slow and halting
English but perfectly fluent Jamaican patois.  He knows everything about
some characters, nothing about others.  And as played by Brad Pitt, he's
not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing, he's just
there.  It's as if someone told Pitt, "Never mind about acting in this
picture, son, just stand there and look pretty."  It's as if Pitt is doing
his Keanu Reeves impression throughout the movie.</P>
<P>I've used the phrase "Angel of Death" in this review very deliberately to
contrast Pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance,
Nicolas Cage's in City of Angels.  Where Pitt is cold and unfeeling, Cage
is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows.  Where Cage is genuinely
curious about the nature of man, Pitt is aloof and arrogant.  Cage struck
instant chemical sparks with co-star Meg Ryan, where the chemistry between
Pitt and Forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that
Forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond Pitt's good
looks.</P>
<P>The movie's other top name is a much better actor, but that doesn't save
Meet Joe Black.  Sir Anthony Hopkins isn't given much better material to
work with, unfortunately.  He plays one of these good-hearted
multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in Hollywood.  (One wonders
what might have happened if they had made Hopkins's character more
realistically evil.)  Hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker, but
Death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his
guide in the world.</P>
<P>Of course, no one can be sure of how they will act when Death taps on their
shoulder.  But I have to wonder (and in this movie, you have a very long
time to wonder) how you or I would act in a similar situation, especially
if you or I were a multimillionaire.  Hopkins pretty much goes to the
office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the
corporation.  Fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated, I'm sure.</P>
<P>I stayed awake all the way through Meet Joe Black, and I'm asking myself
why.  Movies about Death should encourage you to live life to the fullest,
which is what I'm going to do now.  Go spend time with your family, go
volunteer for a local charity, heck, go take a nap.  Don't go see Meet Joe
Black, because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death.</P>
