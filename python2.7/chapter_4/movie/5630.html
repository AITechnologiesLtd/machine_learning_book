<P>   Much has been made of this film, and indeed it is portentous for the
thriller genre.  The dark cinematography breaks new ground for colour
noir, and it pulls no punches to deliver the most substantial and
breathtaking climax to any popular film since Star Wars.  However, it is
of interest to briefly study Se7en's place within the literary tradition
of tragedy. 
   The history of the genre is punctuated by innovative landmarks: Oedipus
Rex (unwittingly) introduced psychology, the Book of Genesis mythology and
Hamlet, character.  The themes explored are traditionally the same: a
hero, disconnected and alienated by fate, or destiny; and an epiphany in
which the hero matures into disillusionment, or a kind of spiritual
adulthood.  These are evinced by my earlier examples: Oedipus provides a
disturbingly literal realisation.  Oedipus,  not just disconnected, but
actually banished for his future sin, marches inevitably towards his
apotheosis.  Upon learning the truth of his relations with his parents, he
enters into a new stage of awareness, blinding himself, signifying his
loss of faith in both noumena and phenomena.  Fundamentally, this figures
a maturing, a growth, from a naive faith in literalism and superstition,
into a sight of the true loneliness and desolation of human existence. 
Like a child moving away from its mother, like humanity moving away from
God, he loses the sense of security in which infantility is founded.  In
the Christian creation story, these themes are largely reiterated, but
upon the gaining of knowledge, the protagonists are cast out of Eden,
which is an unsually pungent statement of the religious implications of
the tragic form.  
   Shakespeare, and, for the sake of argument, Hamlet, is worthwhile
covering here.  As any nascent critic should know, he shifts the focus of
the tragic form from plot to character, and distorts it in other ways
without interrupting its fundamental impetus.  This is a work of subtlety
and emotional resonance probably unmatched until Joyce's Dubliners and
Ulysses.  The subtlety stems from new insights into the nature and
motivation of the tragic hero: rather than being a simple plot device,
Hamlet brings to the proceedings a pre-existant self-awareness and a rally
against the play's necessary conclusion, which is probably the first time
that such a work suggested that self-consciousness renders the tragedy of
gnosis evitable, though in the end Hamlet of course suffers the
revelation: 'The rest is silence.'
   All these are important in discussion of Se7en, which follows the
twentieth century tradition of combining the emotional power of
Shakespearean tragedy of character and the dramatic power of Classical
tragedy of plot: witness Joyce, Eliot, Hughes and Golding as forebears. 
The critical innovation of Se7en is to devolve the tragic responsibility
upon both Somerset and Mills.  Somerset is as Hamlet, seperated from his
colleagues by education and perception, who brings to the film the same
sense of unease, and desire to prevent the revelatory pain.  Mills is more
traditional: literally naive.  As the film progresses, we are given clues
that Somerset's alienation derives from more than intelligence, and that
he has himself undergone some kind of maturing epiphany, though we are
told that 'It wasn't just one thing.'  However, at the climax, there is no
doubt that Somerset is aware of what is about to happen to Mills.  He
rails against Mills's destiny, implores him not to fulfil the sin which
will give him view upon despair.  Freeman's impeccable performance implies
that, inwardly, his character is aware of the futility of this exercise. 
Such realisation of subtle, obscure nuance is the mark of a superb
portrayal; Freeman's lack of Oscar nomination is in itself a tragedy.
The last reel reveals the cript's only moments of facility, Doe rather
obviously stating 'He didn't know.'  However, this does not diminish
Se7en's true value.  Though its innovations are minor, they work
beautifully, and it deserves full marks for three main achievements. 
First, it is the best delineation, of tragic revelation and redemption, of
the latter half of the twentieth century.  Disregarding the critic, it is
also the most stark and shocking delineation of the same ever, possibly. 
Thirdly, it deserves full marks for being populist.  Although its success
hinges upon exploration of the same tenebraic ideas that fuel Crow and
Finnegan's Wake, it is greatly more accessible than any other major
tragedy one might care to name.
   With reference to Eden, one might say that Brad Pitt has truly become a
'legend' of 'the Fall.'  Se7en is a stunning and important film.</P>
