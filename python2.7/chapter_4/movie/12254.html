<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   It's not too difficult to like Michael Moore, creator of the highly
   successful documentary ROGER & ME who returns with his
   similarly-themed follow-up, THE BIG ONE.  His intrinsic appeal to his
   many fans is fairly obvious -- he's the proverbial fly in the
   ointment to corporate America, the underdog crusader challenging and
   confronting big business on behalf of the downtrodden working class.
   It's easy to garnish the audience's support in an Us vs. Them
   polemic, particularly when Mr. Moore labels the Them as the powerful,
   faceless downsizing corporations across America, while the Us is
   depicted as the sad, desperate faces of the newly-unemployed; when
   forced to choose to empathise with either the wealthy industry bigwig
   or the struggling factory worker with bills to pay and hungry mouths
   to feed, it's far too easy to recognize ourselves in the latter.</P>
<P>   Mr. Moore himself does a good job as coming across as an Everyman,
   with his portly, cheerful, insidiously mischievous demeanor, his
   infectious grin, his omnipresent baseball cap, and his propensity not
   to take himself too seriously.  One can immediately tell, however,
   that he takes the topic of downsizing very seriously, and in THE BIG
   ONE, while sent on a whirlwind cross-country tour in 1996 to promote
   his book "Downsize This!  Random Threats From An Unarmed American",
   Mr. Moore and a makeshift skeletal film crew took the opportunity to
   film this irreverent guerrilla documentary on the effects of
   corporate downsizing.  His approach?  In addition to including
   testimonials on the unfairness of the situation from newly-downsized
   workers (corporations are already reaping huge profits, yet are
   nonetheless relocating their plants abroad, where cheaper labour
   abounds), Mr. Moore seemingly-innocously ambled unannounced into
   front foyers of many downsizing corporate headquarters across the
   country and created scenes by demanding justification for the
   layoffs, preferably from a CEO.</P>
<P>   His confrontational approach, though, is decidedly more caustic than
   vitriolic: Mr. Moore typically comes bearing gifts, albeit dubious
   ones -- "Downsizer Of The Year" award certificates, oversized cheques
   for eighty cents ("the first hour's wages for a Mexican worker").
   Bane of corporate America -- one company even issued an internal
   memorandum instructing its staff how to address the situation should
   he pay them an uninvited visit -- Mr. Moore's essentially the working
   man's shit-disturber, ambushing greedy big businesses and holding
   them up for ridicule, all the while remaining eminently polite and
   good-natured; forced out of one office building, he calls out through
   the glass window to the staff member manning the front desk, "You
   tricked me!" in a tone of bemused indignity.</P>
<P>   Although these showdowns are occasionally amusing, they tend do lose
   their bite after repetition as Mr. Moore pulls the same stunt in
   city after city.  Curiously, as the film progressed I found my own
   sympathies lying more and more towards the corporate security guards
   being awkwardly put in the position of attempting to quell his
   instigations; what did these working men ever do to deserve this?
   And Mr. Moore even shows an mean-spirited side in a prank on one of
   the media escorts assigned by his publisher to accompany and assist
   him at his book signings; while she's being forcibly ejected from the
   premises by a security guard misinformed that she's a stalker, the
   person next to me in the theatre choked out "That's so mean!" in
   between her chortles of laughter.  I agreed, although I wasn't
   laughing.  After the joke is finally revealed, we get a close-up of
   the humiliated media escort who's been simply doing her job (she was
   actually fetching Mr. Moore a soda at his bequest when she was
   promptly expelled), grinning and bearing it; behind her gritted
   teeth, you know that deep down she's ready to belt the guy.</P>
<P>   Where THE BIG ONE is at its best is when Mr. Moore interacts with
   other people and unearths surprising and often superficially-shocking
   bits of inanity: he gets a manager of a Payday candy bar plant being
   relocated from Centralia, Illinois to Mexico to state on-camera that
   the move would've been delayed had the employees been *less*
   productive; he finds a convicted murderer who reveals that TWA is
   using low-paid California prison inmates to provide information to
   callers on the airline's 1-800 number.  The mind boggles.</P>
<P>   The film culminates in Seattle, where Mr. Moore is *invited* for a
   one-on-one session with Nike Inc. CEO Phil Knight.  When asked why
   Nike's factories are based in Asia rather than in the U.S., Mr.
   Knight responds "Americans don't really want to make shoes," and
   perhaps he has a point; no amount of low-angle camera shots that Mr.
   Moore employs successfully hides the fact that the group of Flint,
   Michigan hopefuls rallied to convince Nike in setting up a hometown
   shoe factory falls well short of the 500 promised.  In retrospect,
   his pleas for an American-based factory, all the while admitting that
   its margin of profitability would be less than that of a
   foreign-based plant, is disturbing in how much it resembles as a plea
   for charity.  The meeting grows quickly inane after Mr. Knight
   sensibly points out that any unemployed worker sufficiently desperate
   will attest to a desire to work in any sort of profession, upon which
   Mr. Moore challenges the corporate bigwig with a footrace, and then
   an armwrestle for a Flint Nike plant.</P>
<P>   THE BIG ONE is an unabashed pro-labour, pro-union advocacy piece, and
   Mr. Moore's tirades against big industry make for engaging
   soundbites.  Even if one doesn't agree with Mr. Moore's ideologies,
   the film is still entertaining, humorous, and quick-paced.  THE BIG
   ONE weaves in and out of wickedly funny excerpts from Mr. Moore's
   sociopolitical speaking tours monologues (a key target: the
   unblinking Steve Forbes), and savvy editing is employed to elicit
   maximum effect from the many contradictions and absurdities stumbled
   across.  It's an argumentative and provocative film which plays as
   a romp as much as it does a lecture.</P>
<P>   There's a little irony buried within the film which I couldn't help
   but enjoy.  So when anti-big business, pro-union Michael Moore is on
   the road and gets the munchies, where does he get his crew to pull
   over? Why, at McDonald's, of course; gotta have that Filet-O-Fish.</P>
