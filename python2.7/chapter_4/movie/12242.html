<P>        When a film goes out on a limb and does something unique it's an effort worth
giving credit for. However, credit and quality are separates issues as one
does not necessarily equal the other. "Two Girls And A Guy" demonstrates this
notion by using minimalistic storytelling to carry an entire movie, but often
seems too caught up in its niche to use it properly.</P>
<P>        The story starts off simple and never really expands beyond its basic
premise, which is set into motion just as soon as the opening credits
disappear. We meet two young women: Carla (Graham), an upright, professional
blonde; and Lou (Wagner), a streetwise brunette, as they wait outside an
apartment building for their respective boyfriends. After an encounter with a
wannabe-player, the two begin to talk and realize they are dating the same
man, Blake (Downey, Jr.). He's a struggling actor whom both had considered to
be a bit mysterious, but never realized how easily they had been duped until
now. They decide they must brandish Blake with a vengeance of some sort and
proceed to break into his spacious loft and wait for him inside.</P>
<P>        Establishing a story is one of the most crucial elements to filmmaking and
the way this film does this is symbolic of the way it works (or fails to). The
first scene on the steps of the building is rather awkward, as the attempt at
humor through confrontation with a generic, cartoonish character shows little
promise for originality. Add to that the weak dialogue and performances which
makes the film seem like a teenage-oriented sitcom. Listening to the
characters ramble on about nothing is quite annoying, however, once the story
is given something to focus upon it begins to improve.</P>
<P>        And so the film manages to stretch what could be a 2-minute sitcom bit into a
an entire act. This does provide for some characterization on behalf of Carla
and Lou and we learn a great deal about Blake simply through their stories
about him. He has said and done the same things to each at same general time.
Each thought they were the only woman he ever "loved" (not including the
raunchy-but-funny terms which mean the same thing in GenX-speak). At times
it's hard to believe they could have been so gullible, but once Blake enters
the picture, we begin to understand why. Blake is an actor who takes his
profession seriously and tries to justify himself by saying he believes he
fell in love with both simultaneously. But is he being sincere or is he
acting? This idea is brought up continuously throughout the picture and
provides for a semblance of theme.</P>
<P>        Writer/director James Toback wrote the screenplay specifically with Downey in
mind (after his recent trouble with the law), and it's amazing to watch him
absorb the script and atmosphere and deliver such a superb performance despite
the limits he is forced to work with. Downey is so good he completely upstages
Graham and Wagner which also hinders the script. The confrontation scenes are
at least interesting as performed, but to listen to the words and consider the
actions that take place, it doesn't make much sense. Carla and Lou are angry
with Blake and they have every right to be, but why does Blake not seem to
care? Why is there a gratuitous sex scene in the midst of such hostility? And
most importantly, why do they stay at his apartment as long as they do when
they are clearly fed up with him? That question never seems to be answered,
which is surprising since it's the niche to the film.</P>
<P>        Even if "Two Girls And A Guy" falters with its story, it's worth commending
for the way in which it is told (almost entirely in real-time with one
setting). Unfortunately, it's just another case of style over substance.</P>
