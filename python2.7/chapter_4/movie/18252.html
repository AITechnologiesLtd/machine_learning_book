<P>Hurlyburly is an incredibly and frighteningly dark film. Although it is 
filled with a very cynical and sarcastic humor as well, the movie itself 
is shocking, disturbingly blunt and often hard to watch. And yet, awful 
as it may sound; that is the beauty behind this film and the aspect of 
this films that makes it the most dramatically surprising independent 
film since Larry Clark showed us Kids in 1995. Fortunately for 
Hurlyburly there is more hope for success and recognition, due to a 
grade A cast, than the truly underground Kids could have ever dreamed 
of.</P>
<P>Hurlyburly is such an outrageously tense film that it could very easily 
make par without a plot. And it does for the most part. There is neither 
a central goal that the characters in this film pursue nor a subject 
matter that occupies the majority of the movie. What there is instead is 
a tense character study of 4 men, an exotic dancer, a runaway girl and a 
non-central female figure who exists as more of a presence that affects 
the other 6 people than a character herself.</P>
<P>Eddie (Academy Award Nominee Sean Penn), Mickey (Academy Award Winner 
Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Academy Award Nominee Chazz Palminteri) are 
roommates in the town of Hurlyburly, outside of LA. They all share a 
common degree of sexual disparity as well as what appears to be some 
very expensive drug habits. Cocaine is breakfast, nights are undefined 
and work is just a brief phase in their day to day lives. Whether this 
is a bond formed by 3 incredibly unusual, yet undoubtedly real people, 
or a force of separation, is for you to judge.</P>
<P>The common "friend" of this trio is Artie (Golden Globe and Emmy Nominee 
Garry Shandling). However his presence is so common among the 3, that 
his character develops and exists as a 4th male figure only separated by 
the absence of sexual urge. He introduces Donna (Academy Award Winner 
Anna Paquin) to the group of 3. She is a runaway who claims to have 
hitchhiked her way to LA and then established residence in an elevator. 
She is eventually picked up by Artie and is given to the trio as a "care 
package" to engage in sexual behavior with when and how they wish. Odd a 
thing as that may sound, it seems like just another every day occurrence 
when put in this incredibly complex and equally warped film.</P>
<P>Then there is Bonnie (Golden Globe Nominee Meg Ryan) who is a friend of 
the group. She is one of the most intriguing parts of this film because 
she is the only adult female that a complex examination is performed on. 
This film puts her under a microscope of types and examines her every 
move, revealing an odd and sad life that is totally missed when just 
looked upon from the surface. Her interactions with the group of male 
characters are incredibly complicated and must be closely examined for 
the rich symbolism to appear.</P>
<P>When put together, these characters create a dramatically diverse and 
frightening film. Without the great acting by every member of this 
7-person cast, the movie would be a failure. But the award-winning 
actors get it done, and they do so in style. Everyone involved with this 
film deserves yet another award to his or her name for their 
performance, and no one is more so deserving than Sean Penn. In the lead 
role he is absolutely amazing.</P>
<P>When combined, all these elements make what is one of the best films of 
the year, and perhaps the finest ensemble acting since the 1983 hit, The 
Big Chill. And yet it is such a deeper and more shocking film. Everyone 
who sees Hurlyburly will be stunned. When leaving this film there is an 
effect that is almost indescribable, but it is a force that the material 
you just saw lays upon you, and it grasps you and forces it's way into 
you. Perhaps it will stay the forever, I certainly hope so, as I 
wouldn't want to part with this film anytime soon.</P>
