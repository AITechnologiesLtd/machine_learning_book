<PRE>Review: BEYOND SILENCE</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: Sophie Testul</PRE>
<PRE>Review by: Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>There is much said today about dysfunctional families.   BEYOND SILENCE
shows us a family that truly has that distinction.  The story centers on
the life of a young girl named Lara who is born to deaf parents, Martin
and Kai.  Lara becomes their link to the hearing world, making telephone
calls, and interpreting for them, including the dialogue of romantic
movies for her mother. </P>
<P>But the story is much deeper than that.  Martin has a sister, Clarissa,
who has another set of problems.  Not only can Clarissa hear, but she is
an accomplished clarinetist.  Her life has been affected by Martin's
deafness, so when she introduces Lara to the clarinet, and music, her
motivation is questioned.</P>
<P>Martin and Kai have another daughter, eight or ten years younger than
Lara, who isn't too interested in becoming another translator, although
she "speaks" the language.</P>
<P>When Lara becomes eighteen, she is torn by the choices that she could or
should make about her life.  Can she pursue her music?  Must she remain as
her parents' bridge to the outside world?  Will she have a life of her
own?  </P>
<P>This movie is so very tastefully done.  It is in German, with subtitles  
It is strange in one scene, where a music professor speaks English and the
subtitles are in English as well.  Because the Main language of the film
is often sign language, it crosses the language barriers very well.
although you can get confused at times as to whether the subtitles are
translating the spoken or the signed words.</P>
<P>There is nudity and sensuality, but it is in no way offensive.   There is
only one word that is even slightly questionable, in German or in English.</P>
<P>Not only is the acting  superb, the lead actors seem to be fluent in sign
language as well.  They are very believable, including the actress who
plays the young Lara.  I kept thinking to myself that this is a movie that
I hope is nominated for best foreign language film, for both "foreign"
languages.</P>
<P>I do want to see this again, especially with my grandson who attends a
school that teaches sign language to hearing children.   I might even buy
this if it comes out on video. I have to give it an A-.</P>
