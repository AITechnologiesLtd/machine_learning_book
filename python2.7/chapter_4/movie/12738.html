<P>To best enjoy "The Truman Show," there's a couple of things you need to 
do. First, disregard the hype. Ads for the film use a quote from Esquire 
calling it "The Movie Of The Decade." That sort of hyperbole does nothing 
but raise audience expectations to such an unrealistic level that 
disappointment is inevitable. Second, try to put aside any preconceptions 
you have about Jim Carrey. If you loved his rubber-faced antics in films 
like "Ace Ventura," you need to understand that he doesn't do that here. 
Conversely, those who dismiss Carrey as a juvenile embarrassment, the 
Jerry Lewis of the apocalypse, should realize that there's more to the 
man than his geeky persona suggests. This is Carrey's breakthrough movie, 
where he finally takes the lampshade off his head and proves that he can 
act. </P>
<P>Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the first child legally adopted by a 
corporation. From the moment of his birth, Truman has been the unknowing 
star of the most popular TV series in history, a 24 hour a day epic about 
him. Truman lives in Seahaven, an idyllic small town which is actually a 
gigantic set inside a huge domed studio. The beautiful blue skies and 
gorgeous sunsets are all special effects, and the entire population of 
Seahaven are actors, except for Truman Burbank. Raised in this idealized, 
artificial world, Truman shares a home with a fake wife, spends his days 
at a fake job, and confides his hopes and fears to his fake best friend, 
unaware that 5,000 cameras are monitoring his every move. Unaware, that 
is, until one day when the blue sky rips and a stage light plummets from 
above and crashes on the street near him. Minutes later, while driving to 
work, he hears a newscast offering a contrived explanation for the 
occurrence. Truman changes channels, only to pick up a radio signal 
broadcasting stage instructions to the Seahaven crew. Realizing that 
something very strange is going on, Truman begins to examine his world, 
and the game is afoot.</P>
<P>Director Peter Weir ("Gallipoli," "The Year of Living Dangerously" 
"Witness") has created a whale of a good movie, a rich, entertaining, 
thoughtful work that is at once lyrical and ominous. Wisely, he lets the 
audience in on the premise from the beginning, through a faux documentary 
about the phenomenal success of "The Truman Show," including footage of 
giddy fans hooked on the program. We meet the show's creator, a quietly 
intimidating "visionary" named Christof, played by the wonderful Ed 
Harris, who gives a masterful, Oscar-worthy performance as the brooding 
artist. Christof, who fancies himself as Truman's ersatz father figure, 
defends the purity and integrity of his creation, even when challenged 
during a call-in program by a young woman who lost her job as an extra in 
the show when she made direct contact with Truman and tried to tell him 
the truth about his "reality." In addition to providing entertainment for 
millions, Christof patiently explains, he's actually doing Truman a 
service by giving him a world much more desirable than the real one.</P>
<P>Indeed, Peter Weir made some interesting choices in creating Truman's un-
real world. He crafts a highly stylized environment in Seahaven, a 
disquieting cross between the Village from the classic TV series "The 
Prisoner" and Mayfield, the Cleaver's hometown in "Leave It To Beaver." 
Squeaky clean and homogenized, Seahaven feels like the setting for an old 
sit-com, and the actors amplify the mood, smiling too broadly as they 
exchange banalities and awkwardly insert product placements into Truman's 
life. In the center of the surrealism, Carrey initially plays his role 
much like the Darren Stevens character from the old "Bewitched" series. 
His expressions and gestures are almost cartoonish, understandable when 
you look at the context in which Truman was raised. As Truman gradually 
becomes aware that his life is a facade, Carrey's acting turns more and 
more realistic, intensifying the nightmarish journey of a man trying to 
escape from a Stepford world.</P>
<P>Beyond its immense value as pure entertainment, "The Truman Show" is a 
subversive piece of work, genially assaulting the jaded, voyeuristic 
culture of the 90's. Weir offers a society where the most popular show in 
existence is an endless peepshow focused on the utterly mundane life of 
an insurance agent. He suggests our world has become so ugly that 
millions would take comfort in imagined intimacy with a familiar 
character in pleasant surroundings, even if their hero is a virtual 
prisoner and the utopia is phony and bland. It would be easy to dismiss 
the film as just a well-done paranoid fantasy, were it not for the 
enduring popularity of "The Real World," "Cops" and "The Jerry Springer 
Show." The sad truth is that "The Truman Show" is already running and 
we're watching it every day.</P>
