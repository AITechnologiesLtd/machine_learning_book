<PRE>BY EDWIN JAHIEL</PRE>
<PRE>IN WHOSE HONOR?</PRE>
<P>In his June 18, 1997 Champaign-Urbana, IL News-Gazette column titled "A
Smooth Name Switch," editor Tom Kacich wrote: "Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, is named in honor of the Miami tribe of American Indians, which gave
up the rights to most of their Ohio homeland in a 1795 treaty. Most of the
approximately 1,700 Miami now live in Oklahoma."</P>
<P>After a series of name changes, in 1928 Miami U. began calling its athletic
teams Redskins. In 1972, a formal resolution by the tribe  reinforced an
already existing relationship with the University. But times and
perceptions change. Last July, the tribe sent the school a new resolution,
politely asking for the discontinuance of the name Redskins by the end of
academic year 1996-97.</P>
<P>Within three months the Trustees had accepted the suggestion. Soon after, a
new nickname, RedHawks, was adopted. No fuss, no muss, no bother. Civility
on both sides.</P>
<P>By comparison, the Chief Illiniwek case at the University of Illinois has
been a battleground for some time. This is the main (but by no means
parochial) subject of the excellent film "In Whose Honor," a new entry in
the high-quality P.O.V. (Point of View) series of non-fiction films by
independent filmmakers -- the kind of series that would probably have never
materialized were it not for PBS. (Last week's amusing P.O.V. was about the
maverick, now admired now ridiculed filmmaker Henry Jaglom).</P>
<P>It airs on WILL-TV  at 7 pm, Tuesday July 15.  At  8 pm, simulcast on
WILL-TV and WILL-AM 580 radio, comes a Talking Point follow-up discussion
--and no doubt, argumentation -- with comments by guests and call-ins. It
will be a hot time in the old town that night.</P>
<P>The documentary is being broadcast nationally. In addition to its general
importance, it has many levels of appeal for our community. It is topical,
it was mostly filmed here, Jay Rosenstein (its maker as  producer,
director, editor, co-cinematographer, chief bottle washer) is a UIUC
graduate. Still at the University, he teaches at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications and is also a multimedia producer. Long may he
stay with us.</P>
<P>"American Indians are human beings, not mascots," is one of the refrains
that sum up the film as well as the feelings of many -- Indian or not --
across the nation, who have been successful in having several sports teams
abandon their Indian nicknames and paraphernalia.</P>
<P>The Illiniwek "cause celebre," slowly caught fire when Charlene Teters, a
Spokane Indian, came to the UIUC campus in the late 1980s as a graduate
student in Art. Soon after, she took her children to an Illini basketball
game. The mother and the children were dismayed, shocked and upset by the
dancing-prancing-twirling Chief Illiniwek.</P>
<P>Attractive, articulate and eloquent  Ms. Teters, is often on camera,
describing lucidly how and why she and many others feel that the Illiniwek
type of activities, symbols, regalia, mascots plus many inauthenticities
are blows to Indian pride and self-esteem as they constitute non-respect of
important rituals.</P>
<P>In interviews with American Indian personalities, we even learn that
genuine drumbeats are like heartbeats and not as conceived by Hollywood. (I
believe that what popularized the phony beats was the outrageously kitschy
"Indian Tom-Tom" sequence in the 1936 Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy hit
film "Rose Marie," from a famous operetta. This hit movie has to be on TV
these days since Jimmy Stewart had one of his early roles in it).</P>
<P>The documentary has many scenes that were started some years ago, as it
followed on the Urbana campus the outraged, originally unsupported
Charlene. She ran a one-person campaign against the Chief, picketed games,
spoke of the demeaning the Native Americans. Though shunned, even vilified
by some students, she went on doggedly, insisting that since symbols of
Indian culture meant so much to the Indians, they ought not to be treated
lightly, as entertainment.</P>
<P>There is much coverage of the situation, including a person at a football
game who, reacting to the pressures to eliminate Chief Illiniwek, states
that  "People shouldn't cave in to out-of-state foreigners."</P>
<P>No one caved in among the Trustees, the alumni, the fans or the officials.
The Trustees, like Susan Gravehorst (one of the participants in Talking
Point), wisely are not presented as insensitive foes of Charlene, but as
sincere partisans of the status quo. Mrs. Gravehorst cannot imagine how the
Chief "who deports himself with such dignity and such solemnity ... can be
perceived as a racial insult or slur." The Chiefs themselves are pleasant,
clean-cut fellows, also convinced that their "characters" actually honor
the Indian people.</P>
<P>The controversy is followed in detail, in ramifications that include
financial aspects,  politics, shifts by the U of I attitudes. It gets
amplified as Charlene becomes a  national leader in the cause, and is seen
in rallies and protests in other cities where games use Indian names and
symbols.</P>
<P>The common-sense solution is that while most pro-Chiefers are honestly
persuaded that their opponents are wrong and far too touchy, so long as a
clear majority within an ethnic minority feel so strongly and do not
consider themselves honored,  so long as abolishing the Chief does not
wound persons or institutions, the fracas could be ended quickly and gently
with the stroke of a pen. Remember Miami.</P>
