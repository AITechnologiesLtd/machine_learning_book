<P>Poor Mike. But haven't we all been there at one point or time? SWINGERS
is a 'life in the week of....' movie and a great one at that. Mike (Jon
Favreau) has broken up with his girlfriend and moved to California to
'attempt' to make it as a comedian. His friends are extremely concerned
about his well being, however, since he can only obsess over his loss.
Checking his answering machine hourly and at very inconvenient times in
hopes of hearing her voice he practically refuses to leave his
apartment. The guys, however, are there to remedy the situation. In a
series of "nights out" Mike is thrust back into the singles scene again
and finding that it is much more difficult than he remembers. Trent
(Vince Vaughn) is the king of the swingers, though, being able to say
the right thing at the right time even though it looks like the wrong
thing at the wrong time. His knack at picking up women is unconventional
but always right on the "money". The entire gang spends their time
trying to boost Mike's horribly low self-esteem by coaching him in the
ways of women and by dragging him through California and Las Vegas
nightlife. The movie feel is that of just hanging out with a group of
guys who exist to have a good time and hit on the "babies". The script
is extremely well written and dialog is snappy and hysterical. Director
Doug Liman (whose only previous credit is 1994's GETTING IN) does an
acceptable job of pacing the film and pulling out the 'real-life' feel
and look from the actors. A discussion of good/bad Hollywood directors
amongst the guys even leads to a couple of homage scenes that are well
placed and enjoyable. SWINGERS soundtrack is well suited adding a
jazzy-swing flavor to the picture that only adds to the already exciting
ambiance. Feel like a good laugh and a look at the way guys think today?
You don't want to miss SWINGERS then. 3 ½ spots. (Out of 4)</P>
