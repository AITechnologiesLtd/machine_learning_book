<P>`The Bone Collector' is a grisly serial killer retread that aspires to
reach the grotesquely unnerving high that `Seven' achieved with such a
controversial note in 1995. Filled with scalded, dismembered and
rat-covered carcasses, it's not a movie you want to experience right
after dinner. And while there are notable flashes of style and an
effectively dank mood that wafts over the proceedings like a dark cloud,
`The Bone Collector' dissipates into a movie that's more muddled than
frightening.</P>
<P>Study a block of Swiss cheese for awhile and you'll understand the basic
plot structure of `The Bone Collector'. The filmmakers are up to their
elbows in flaws, but they also possess the skill to craft a decent
movie. Early on, we dismiss the plot holes and try and absorb the
impressive style that director Phillip Noyce (`Patriot Games') has
injected. As time passes, however, we lose the ultimate grip on the
storyline. There's no effective movement after the opening half-hour;
the movie is strung together in a rather lethargic fashion by gory
shocks and mysterious clues. While it hits the occasional note of
interest, even perhaps fascination, `The Bone Collector' is a
disappointing effort.</P>
<P>What a good, solid actor Denzel Washington is. In everything from his
Oscar-winning performance in `Glory' to the terrorist thriller `The
Siege', Washington is simply superb. Playing paraplegic police detective
Lincoln Rhyme, the actor once again derives humor and sensitivity from a
character that would be lost at sea without his light touch. Granted,
the performances are not the problem  with `The Bone Collector'.  What
is? The constant utilization of preposterous plot mechanisms and the
lack of a solid spine-tingling mystery is a good place to start.</P>
<P>Detective Rhyme, bed-ridden ever since a near-fatal accident in the line
of duty, is called upon for his intellect to study the evidence in a
gruesome homicide. The killer drives a taxi, and when he picks up a
passenger, it's basically common knowledge that they're not going to
make it to their final destination. Yes, it's another one of those icky
serial killer movies.</P>
<P>After she shows some expertise at a crime scene, Rhyme enlists the help
of patrol officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) in the detailed case.
Investigating the aftermath of a bloody murder, Rhyme leads Donaghy
through the darkly lit innards of the New York City sewer system, hoping
to locate evidence and examine the nature of the killing. From the bed
in his apartment, Rhyme can do little more than bark orders toward his
young trainee. Working together, they could solve the identity of the
serial killer - even if the audience has figured it out a great deal
ahead of time.</P>
<P>That's my central grievance with the film. The elusive murderer in `The
Bone Collector' leaves clues behind that are merely genre clichés, and
he continuously manages to elude the entire police force despite their
best efforts. Is the killer incredibly brilliant, or is the police force
incredibly stupid?? The answer is a little of both. Despite such an
unwelcome number of plot holes, the film is darkly effective with it's
establishment of mood and slickly entertaining with it's presentation of
the facts. All of this... until the ill-conceived finale, which reveals
the identity of the murderer in a hammy and unbelievable fashion. It
feels like a cop-out ending that only exists in a cheap `Scream'
knockoff, where the killer reveals his motive in a strictly
connect-the-dots fashion to accommodate the audience. Even Washington
loses concentration, biting his lower lip in an expression that seems to
convey: `Damn. Who wrote this into the script?'</P>
<P>To be fair, both Washington and Jolie are excellent. The remainder of
the cast straddles the line between solid and obvious, with the
exception of Queen Latifah, who delivers a well-rounded performance as
Rhyme's bedside nurse. Michael Rooker plays the disgruntled Captain
Cheney, who wears a dastardly scowl and serves no purpose other than
creating conflict with the lead characters.</P>
<P>It's got certain promise, but `The Bone Collector' has an overbearing
tendency to lose focus. I would recommend `Seven' for a truly
frightening, gut-wrenching experience on a gloomy night. This average
entry is strictly for genre fanatics.</P>
