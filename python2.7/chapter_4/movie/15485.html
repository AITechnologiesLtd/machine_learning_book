THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
A film by Frank Darabont
Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore
Written and Directed by Frank Darabont</PRE>
<P>    All Hollywood films should be this good.  Without a doubt one of the 
most purely entertaining films in recent memory, THE SHAWSHANK 
REDEMPTION, stands out not as a good prison drama, a good drama, a 
well-written film, or anything of that sort.  It's not a distinguishable 
film, and indeed it may not be highly remembered in the annals of 
history, because its accomplishments have been done before.  That, 
however, would be a shame, because THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one hell 
of a movie, and a fine example of pure Hollywood filmmaking.</P>
<P>The story is relatively simple: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) gets 
convicted for two murders he didn't commit, and ends up in Shawshank 
Prison, where he languishes, having various adventures on the way.  He 
also meets Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who helps 
him on the way, and sooner or later, becomes Andy's closest friend.  The 
two share an uncommon bond, and the film gradually explores the 
relationship of these two men.  Dufresne is forced to undergo the 
hardships of prison, but pretty soon overcomes his obstacles, and two 
men bond as Dufresne goes through a series of challenges along the way 
to the eventual ending of the film. 20</P>
<P>The performances of everybody, from Robbins and Freeman to character 
actors such as James Whitmore, are absolutely fantastic. I don't think 
I've ever seen Robbins or Freeman better, and they are certainly the 
highlights.  Whitmore, playing prison librarian Brooks Hatlen, makes a 
triumphant return to the screen in a superb performance that truly is 
etched in the viewer's mind.  Darabont directs with a sure hand, and has 
quite a few memorable moments writted in his screenplay, which is an 
outstanding work.  He lets his actors due their thing, focusing on them 
more than anything else, and lets this plot just develop.  It's a great 
thing to watch this one unfold.  The cinematography and brilliant score 
add to the feel of this film.  Film scores sometimes have the tendency 
to overwhelm the film, but this is a restrained piece of music that 
soars with the viewer's emotion.</P>
<P>You can complain about the "pleasantness" of prison.  You 
can complain about how the prisoners don't age at all during the film.  
You can complain about Darabont's tendency to show the viewers 
everything at all, about how his film may have too much dialogue, how it 
may be too long, or how you've just seen the film before a long time 
ago.  You can even say that it is highly derivative, with good 
performances, but a plot that has been time tested.  Hell, you could 
complain about anything in the world, for that matter.  I frankly don't, 
if you'll pardon the French, give a damn.  For me, and hundreds of other 
devoted fans, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one highly entertaining film 
that grabs the viewer, and brings him on a superbly paced journey into 
the land of hope.  The ultimate feel-good movie in a year of feel-good 
movies, and one of the best examples of pure entertainment, THE 
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is gold.  Could it ever happen?  Probably not.  But 
"The Shawshank Redemption" reminds you that film is not meant to 
always be plausible.  Sometimes movies take you to another dimension, 
another world, where everything isn't supposed to make sense, but it 
does.  Sometimes movies are supposed to transport you to a time and 
place so great, you don't want to leave.  This is one of those movies.  
Simply amazing.</P>
