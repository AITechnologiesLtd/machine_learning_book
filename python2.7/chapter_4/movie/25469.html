<PRE>CAST.....
Denis Lavant..... Galoup
Michel Subor..... Commander Bruno Forestier
Gregoire Colin..... Gilles Sentain</PRE>
<P>Galoup is not in uniform, but he is in funereal black. He's in a night club, 
but with only mirrors for company, which force his sour image at him like 
deliberate mockery. He dances fast, but seems dead, like his body's being 
shaken around. The song lyric playing ceaselessly: "The rhythm of the 
night... this is the rhythm of my life."</P>
<P>His is indeed a dark beat. Galoup is played by Denis Lavant -- he of those 
Stella Artois commercials that have played along with the coming attractions 
at every movie for the last two years -- in a performance of unmoving, 
bitter, canine expression that was probably not difficult to perform but is 
effective nonetheless. He is an empty man -- devastated because of his 
dishonourable discharge from the French Legionnaires, but also lacking in 
soul, and his problems were eating away at him even when he was a commanding 
officer.</P>
<P>Claire Denis's "Beau Travail" documents the process. The final scene, 
described above, feels tragic; the rest of the movie is quite boring. It 
takes place in some African country, where the Legionnaires train for area 
guarding in tortuous heat, and unspoken tensions drive men mad. Galoup seems 
to look at his colleagues and subordinates with a suspicious eye, becoming 
convinced they are mocking or trying to usurp him. Eventually he starts to 
victimise a Russian-born platoon member, setting him unreasonable punishments 
for non-existent offences, and then travelling to a deserted area and leaving 
him for dead.</P>
<P>This could have been a chilling character study of bitter poignancy, because 
the obvious uneventfulness of life in the camp (there is hardly any dialogue 
in the movie, and everyone moves in a slow, mechanical manner) makes Galoup's 
paranoia all the more sad. It feels unintentionally aimless, though, because 
there is a voice-over narration of grand musings that falsely suggests 
there's some higher meaning to it all. Why can't Denis let the story be a 
tragedy about one pathetic man? Why does she suggest that there's a Big 
Intellectual Message? If she's trying to make a general point about how a 
life of army solitude is bound to turn all soldiers insane, then she fails, 
because her depiction of camp life is Galoup's perception, not realism. 
Actual military personnel would not be robotically executing tasks or 
vacantly staring into space; they'd be digging into their duties in between 
joking with each other, playing cards and drinking. Does she know anyone in 
the army? On the basis of "Beau Travail" I doubt it.</P>
<P>The picture's most striking aspect is the homoerotic aura of its training 
scenes, with sweaty, half-naked, muscular men slowly and silently flexing and 
gyrating in the hot sun against a backdrop of dry sand. I wonder if a male 
director would get away with shooting a female cast like that. I'd also like 
to see that movie, if ever it gets made.</P>
