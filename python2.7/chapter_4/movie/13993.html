<PRE>                              HEAD ON 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                      1 :-( for a world of oral sex</PRE>
<P>Directed by Ana Kokkinos, Cast :Alex Dimitriades, Paul Capsis, Julian
Garner, Tony Nikolakopoulos, Elena Mandalis, María Mercedes, Alex Papps,
Vassili Zappa, Damien Fotiou, Eugenia Fragos. Written by Andrew Bovell,
Ana Kokkinos, Mira Robertson, Christos Tsiolkas (novel).</P>
<P>HEAD ON is angry, noisy and confused like the highs and lows of a heroin
addict. This certainly isn't a heart warming, thoughtful movie and the R
in restricted, could easily be re-labelled Risqué. If anyone is
expecting this to be another episode of HEARTBREAK HIGH, think again,
don't be fooled by the ads – this is a kid on the fast lane to
self-destruction. Most people are probably not prepared for the shock
that comes with Alex Dimitriades' overnight change from straight, high
school heart throb, to blatant, sex obsessed homosexual.</P>
<P>There is a recurrent theme throughout this movie. The title of the movie
is aptly named HEAD ON. If you're wondering what it means, it isn't
about a simple head on concussion post fall, but full on oral sex. Oral
sex with an obese, Chinese grocery store man, oral sex with a dirty old,
Greek man, oral sex with a lesbian, and oral sex with a Caucasian hunk.
In fact there was so much oral sex one wonders whether this is something
more to sex, than just being oral?</P>
<P>The acting is mostly angry, and some of the sex scenes looked contrived.
I don't speak from first hand experience on either subject, but there
must be more to this movie than moans, groans and jerky movements,
identity crises, Greek self hatred, racism and addiction. Unfortunately,
this movie filled with St Kildaderish nightlife, may have too much to
say (or should I say show), for the sleepy residents of unglamorous
Melbourne. Perhaps a better choice of movies next time Alex Dimitriades
- the profile of angry, rebel, homosexual, drug addict will not
necessary boost your career, even if you did show your dick for the
world to see (a trick used too often nowadays by wannabe movie stars).</P>
