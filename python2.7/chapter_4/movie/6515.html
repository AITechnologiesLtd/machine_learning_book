<P>     MY FELLOW AMERICANS is a buddy comedy.  It is a bickering buddy
comedy.  It is a bickering-buddies-on-the-road comedy.  In short, MY
FELLOW AMERICANS has about as generic a basic premise as there is in
Hollywood.  So how does it end up so improbably entertaining?  Because
when it comes to film-making, story isn't even half the story -- execution
is king.  MY FELLOW AMERICANS uses the familiar plot as a starting point,
adds a script with just enough lively turns, and casts two consummate
professionals in the lead roles.  The result is a simple but engaging
studio comedy, energized by the wonderful pairing of Jack Lemmon and James
Garner.</P>
<P>     Lemmon plays Russell Kramer, a one-term Republican president now
spending his retirement giving speeches at corporate luncheons and writing
cookbooks; Garner plays Matt Douglas, Kramer's Democratic successor and
long-time adversary.  Three years after losing to Kramer's one-time V.P.
Bill Haney (Dan Aykroyd), Douglas finds himself with another shot when a
scandal prepares to break involving a kickback to the Kramer-Haney
administration.  The party's support awaits Douglas if he can get evidence
to nail his old foe, but Kramer is equally keen to prove he knew nothing
about the deal.  Both men discover that the plot is thicker than they
realized when a key witness turns up dead, and a helicopter they were
supposed to be on blows up over North Carolina.  With no one they can
trust but each other, the two ex-presidents make their way towards
Kramer's presidential library in Ohio for evidence implicating Haney and
find that only a bi-partisan effort will get them there alive.</P>
<P>     You're going to see a lot of critics referring to MY FELLOW AMERICANS
as GRUMPY OLD PRESIDENTS, and it's not just because Jack Lemmon is on
board that comparisons to the GRUMPY OLD... films are appropriate.  The
most notable similarity is that MY FELLOW AMERICANS also bases much of its
humor on the notion that senior citizens spewing forth profanities are
intrinsically hilarious; no fewer than nineteen separate expletives season
the dialogue of Lemmon and Garner.  It is an unfortunate decision, if for
no other reason than that it is unnecessary.  Political rivals should have
more personalized gibes at their disposal, and indeed the script features
a few nice zingers aimed at the stereotypes of each party.  It would have
been nice to see more -- and more pointed -- barbs, particularly like
those aimed at Haney's dim-witted vice-president (John Heard), whose
mispronunciation of a single word may provide the film's biggest laugh.</P>
<P>     Insult humor only goes as far as the slingers of the insults, though,
and MY FELLOW AMERICANS rises well above its material simply because
Lemmon and Garner bring out the best in each other.  Lemmon's Kramer is
the more complete character, a politician who so desperately needs
approval that he has become an over-eager joke.  While Kramer is the guy
you can be sure promised everything to everybody, Garner's Douglas is the
charismatic charmer who probably didn't have to.  Garner has long been one
of the best actors around at playing the put-upon grouch, and it is a
delight simply to see him in a leading role on the big screen again.  When
he growls out a withering one-liner in his gravelly baritone, it is
delivered with unteachable timing, and Lemmon matches him with his best
Felix Unger disdain.  The two are both perfectly matched and perfectly
mis-matched; there is something about their veteran interaction which
makes the most mundane situations sing with comic confidence.</P>
<P>     Director Peter Segal (who put Chris Farley and David Spade through
similar buddy-bonding paces in TOMMY BOY) keeps the pace at a brisk clip,
which counters some uninspired situations, like a journey on a University
of North Carolina rooters train which provides little more than something
to jump off.  There isn't much Segal can do with the sentimental angle in
the script, as the ex-presidents' encounter with an average American
family leads them to ask the "Duh"-inspiring question of whether 
politicians may be out of touch with their constituents.  All these
problems MY FELLOW AMERICANS has, yet I laughed harder than I had any
reason to expect.  Handed the sow's ear of a standard buddy-caper script,
Jack Lemmon and James Garner were able to turn it into a purse...perhaps
not silk, but surprisingly smooth nonetheless.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hails to the chief:  7.</PRE>
