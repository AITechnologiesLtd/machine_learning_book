<P>   There is no one so insufferable as a reformed smoker or a
rehabilitated alcoholic.  He becomes an immovable force, a
man consumed with a lust for changing the bad habits of
others.  The assassin in Chen Kaige's sumptuous feast of a
movie, Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi), is a hit man who has killed
many people for money. Now, customarily in areas of China
during the Third Century B.C., an assassin would be hired to
wipe out an entire family.  When in the process of doing just
this, something happens that causes Jing to think about a
career change.  He becomes appalled with the idea of taking
human lives and consequently furious at those who do so,
whether they be contract killers or heads of government who
lead their people to war.</P>
<P>   This theme is just one of the elements of the complex,
multi-plotted drama, "The Emperor and the Assassin," which
is said to be the most expensive film ever produced in Asia. 
Its cost of $15 million might be considered chump change in
Hollywood, but given the hundreds of disciplined extras
involved in the lively and gory battle scenes, the money
raised from sources like Taiwan, Japan, and a consortium in
Europe was well spent.  Considering the lavish banquet for
the eyes, does the movie--by the director of the erotic and
exquisite "Farewell, My Concubine"--pass muster as drama? 
Alas, only partly.  For while director Chen Kaige appears
influenced by Shakespearean histories and in particular by
Akira Kurusawa's epic film "Ran," the romance between his
leading lady and the titled assassin and between the woman
and the emperor seem more influenced by Plato than by
Eros. What's more, the staging is so diffuse that we often
lose sight of the central focus, which should be on the
characters in the ancient romantic triangle while we try to
follow the Machiavellian machinations of some very ambitious
people.</P>
<P>   Based on actual historical documents from the Third
Century B.C., at a time that Hannibal was preparing for war
against far-away Rome, "The Emperor and the Assassin" pits
two dogmatic forces against each other.  The Emperor of
Qin, Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), has been mandated by his
ancestors and by heaven (he thinks) to unite the seven
kingdoms of China under his rule.  China was divided into
seven dominant kingdoms: Qin, Han, Qu, Wei, Zhao, Qi, and
Yan, with Ying concentrating his attention on Han, Zhao and
Yan.  To drum up a pretext for invading Yan, he has his
lover, Lady Zhao (the great Gong Li), travel to Yan to hire an
assassin, who would journey to Qin. When the plot to
eliminate the emperor is uncovered, the emperor would be
free to invade Yan, gaining the untroubled backing of his own
people and of some of the kingdoms to the south.  But the
killer had become sickened when a pretty, blind teen commits
suicide just after a wipe-out of her family, and becomes
devoted to destroying people who remain like the former Jing. 
That pits him seriously against the emperor, whose armies
have been ordered to kill, kill and kill and even to bury
children of one of his enemy kingdoms alive.  The plot is
complicated by an attempted coup at the hands of the
previously smiling Marquis Changxin (Wang Zhiwen), who
serves the emperor graciously and subserviently.  </P>
<P>   The 161-minute movie is divided into two parts so diverse
that you could cut the story with a sword.  The more involving
segment is a series of beautifully staged battles involving
hundreds of warriors on both sides.  They attack with shields
in mechanical discipline like the soldiers of modern
computerized video games and, in fact, could have been
refugees from movies like "Robocop" and the latest of the
Jean-Claude Van Damme series.  Defenders atop their
castles ply their attackers with stones while the assaulters, in
one pulse-racing incident, roll what resembles a huge bowling
ball into the castle door, breaking it down like a SWAT team
from the LAPD.  Some of these segments are so boldly
filmed that if Kurusawa were alive today, he'd be
influenced mightily.  Chen Kaige uses state-of-the-art
technology in filming his campaigns but for some puzzling
reason did not shoot the work with wide-screen lensing.  </P>
<P>   When the time comes to make love and not war, you'd
think that this movie and the 1993 "Farewell, My Concubine"
were directed by two different people.  "Concubine," which
also featured the wonderful and gorgeous Gong Li, was also
about a Chinese warlord period, but there the focus is
squarely on the pugnacious 52-year relationship of two male
childhood apprentices in the Peking Opera.  By contrast,
when Chen focuses here on his three principals, we long to
return quickly to battle.  You'd never know that Lady Zhao
and Jing had fallen deeply in love, though the way Chinese
showed their emotions before the first millennium might
explain this in part.  Nor are we convinced when the emperor
begs his great love not to leave him, recalling their childhood
days when, both hungry and cold, they romped happily in the
haystacks.  If the dialogue seems pedestrian (even though
the performers often speak their lines with effectively
stentorian and highly stylized timbre) live with the translator. 
Still, since the long movie never really drags despite its flaws,
"The Emperor and the Assassin," makes for a solid spectacle
that would cater to an audience that might find the also lavish
"Anna and the King" too dated and too tame.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running Time: 161 minutes.  (C) 1999
