<PRE>THE INVISIBLE CIRCUS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Adam Brooks's THE INVISIBLE CIRCUS is a handsome travelogue and mystery 
about a young woman venturing to Europe in order to discover the exact 
circumstances behind her older sister's suicide 7 years earlier.  
Although well cast and acted, the movie doesn't amount to much.  Still, 
it is an enjoyable enough diversion.</P>
<P>Based on Jennifer Egan's novel, the story opens in 1976 in San 
Francisco.  Phoebe O'Connor (Jordana Brewster, who looks like a young 
DEMI MOORE) is troubled about her mother's (Blythe Danner) dating, even 
though she has been a widow for 9 years.  Her father's death from 
leukemia was the seminal event that caused her sister, Faith (Cameron 
Diaz), to become a radical and, in an escalation in her underground 
activities, leave for Europe.  </P>
<P>Phoebe leaves home with her sister's postcards in hand so she can 
retrace her sister's route through Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin and 
Portugal.  Joining her on her search for the truth behind Faith's death 
is Faith's old boyfriend, Wolf (Christopher Eccleston).  As they travel, 
we meet Faith in flashbacks.  Diaz, like the rest of the cast, is quite 
good, but, in Diaz's case, she never makes a convincing revolutionary.  
In fact, the more militant she acts, the less believable she becomes.</P>
<P>At first, Faith's protests are like beautifully choreographed ballets.  
Bursting in on some dining diplomats in Paris, the radicals shower 
feathers down on the diners like falling snow.  It is perhaps one of the 
most picturesque protests on record.  Faith, who is stoned much of the 
time, joins the Red Army, where her duties are rather akin to that of a 
maid.  Eventually, she becomes a full-fledged, gun-toting, bomb-throwing 
terrorist, while still staying her sweet lovable self.  One suspects 
that she must have suffered from a horrible, split personality disorder.</P>
<P>"She thought she was changing the world, but, in the end, she was just 
one more person getting her kicks," Wolf summarizes the meaning of 
Faith's life to Phoebe.  The movie itself is like that.  It just doesn't 
add up to anything.</P>
<P>THE INVISIBLE CIRCUS runs 1:38.  It is rated R for sexuality, language 
and drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
