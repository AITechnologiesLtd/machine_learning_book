<P>Does anyone remember a movie from 1979 entitled 'Meteor'?  It starred
Sean Connery, Natalie Wood, Karl Malden and Brian Keith and the premise
was a giant meteor 5 miles wide that was going to strike Earth.  The
United States and the Soviet Union worked together in firing their
nuclear weapons at it in the hopes that it would be destroyed.
Throughout the course of the picture, splinters of the meteor were seen
from time to time, landing on different parts of our planet before the
big strike.  The film lacked any type of depth.  It basically had very
little intrepid dialogue detailing the effects of such an event and it
felt very out of place in the realm of science.  Of course, it was 19
years ago and progress has been made in the detection of such a
phenomenon since that time and I was impressed with most of 'Deep
Impact'.</P>
<P>Director Mimi Leder ('The Peacemaker') and writer Bruce Joel Rubin
('Ghost', 'Jacob's Ladder', 'My Life',) along with fellow writer Michael
Tolkin ('The Player'), have crafted a very special film that seems
disjointed at first but later becomes a truly worthy film that plays at
the very heart of a potentially emotional situation.</P>
<P>A comet the size of New York City is on a direct collision course with
Earth.  This information comes to the attention of a reporter (Tea
Leoni), who, believe it or not, begins tracking the story as  she
believes it is about a politician and his mistress.  Sound bizarre?
After seeing the film, it all makes sense.  Her efforts to report the
story are thwarted by the FBI, working closely with a liaison to the
U.S. President (Morgan Freeman) and the President himself is directly
involved.  Leoni is run off the road by a fleet of cars and the FBI
agents take her for a direct one on one conversation with the
President.  There is still a misunderstanding about who believes what,
and the President makes a deal with her that if she holds off on
reporting the story for a couple of days, that she will be given access
to a Presidential White House conference and will be allowed the first
question.</P>
<P>The President reveals the truth about the comet and announces the
government's plans on how to handle it.  The U.S. and Russia are working
together on the largest space ship ever constructed to approach, land
and plant nuclear missiles on the comet at its core.  The mission is led
by an ex-Apollo astronaut nicknamed Fish (Robert Duvall).  He was one of
the men who walked on the moon and is the ideal candidate for the
mission, along with several others by his side.  There are also plans to
shield part of the population away underground until the catastrophe is
over.  Explaining things any further would basically give too much of
the movie away so I now zip my lip.</P>
<P>'Deep Impact' is told from the perspective of many different characters,
so young, some old, some in-between and while many of the scenes are
scatter shot, the film's overall presentation is unique.  It gives way
to emotion with some characters you'll care about and others you'll care
less for but the special effects are truly dazzling in showcasing the
effects of a comet impacting with Earth, giving way to a chain reaction
of 1000 to 3500 foot tidal waves, earthquakes and other natural
disasters complete with a booming soundtrack and a nice music score from
Oscar winner James Horner ('Titanic').  The movie had me in the palm of
its hand at the end while I was asking myself..."Could this really
happen"?  After some research, I found out that the answer is 'yes' and
it made the film that much more significant for me in contrast to the
usual bad science found in many adventures related to it.</P>
<P>Other notable members of the cast are Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave,
Maximilian Schell, James Cromwell and Mary McCormack.</P>
