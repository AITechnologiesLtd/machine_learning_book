<PRE>(1995) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        If DO THE RIGHT THING had taken place on a college 
campus, it might have gone something like this. Director John 
Singleton (of BOYZ IN THE HOOD fame) brings us this compelling 
story whose theme is that people tend to congregate within their 
own demographic, whether it be age, sex, race or all of the above. 
Singleton mainly focuses on racism which, narrow-minded and 
primitive as it is, will never completely vanish in this country. Had 
America's background been different, racial harmony may have been 
achieved, but with things and people the way they are, it's not going 
to happen.</P>
<P>        On one hand you've got the skinheads like Michael 
Rappaport, who goes through his first two months at college scared 
and alone before being recruited by a bunch of neo-Nazis, who offer 
companionship while filling his head with that Aryan Nation crap. 
On the other you've got the black people like Omar Epps, who sees 
the injustice inflicted on the African race and adopts the notion that 
all white people are to be distrusted and hated. Epps blames every 
wrong thing in his life on his skin color and soon withdraws to the 
comfort of "Super Duper Senior" Ice Cube's bachelor pad (also 
inhabited by charismatic rapper Busta Rhymes), where giant "Black 
Power" posters abound.</P>
<P>        Singleton doesn't just focus on the race problems, he shows 
feminine problems as well, when Kristy "Buffy" Swanson is date 
raped her second night on campus and is taken under the wing of 
Jennifer Connelly, one of those penis-boycotting feminists. I could 
guess right off that Connelly's character was a lesbian, albeit one of 
those beautiful Hollywood lesbians. Connelly makes it clear that she 
doesn't want to pressure Swanson into swearing off the male gender 
entirely, but there's always a breast to cry on if she wants it.</P>
<P>        Not every character is an extremist. There are some people 
in the movie with sense, like the Political Science professor 
(Lawrence Fishburne) who can actually look beyond sex and skin 
color and tries to explain to Epps that his defeatist attitude won't get 
him anywhere in the world; Epps' girlfriend, the lovely supermodel 
Tyra Banks, who also hasn't given up on success just because she 
was born black; Swanson's roommate, Regina King of "Family 
Matters," who's fought off Urkel's advances for six seasons and now 
has to worry about getting hit on by a lesbian roommate; and Epps' 
roommate, a white boy with no racial prejudice who tries to befriend 
Epps but can't break down the race barrier.</P>
<P>        Eventually, as in DO THE RIGHT THING, the racial 
tension builds to the point at which it manifests itself in violence, 
but not in just one scene and not just in one way. In the end, little 
ground is gained by either side. Thankfully, Singleton's realistic 
outlook prevented him from making a sugar-coated, harmonious 
ending. As one of the characters points out, that kind of "We Are 
the World" outlook is a crock. Certain individuals will always think 
society has screwed them over for the wrong reasons. And other 
individuals will think themselves superior to everyone else. The rest 
of this know none of this is right but some people's minds just aren't 
going to be changed. The race problem can't be eliminated entirely, 
but intelligent films like this can change individuals' thoughts and 
actions for the better.</P>
