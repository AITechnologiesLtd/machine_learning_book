<PRE>THE GLASS HOUSE
A film review by Joshua Tyler
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>People who live in glass houses... better not have much to hide. 
Because sooner or later, you'll get caught with your pants down, leaving
everything hanging out for everyone to see.</P>
<P>The Glass House stars everyone's favorite Helen Hunt clone, Leelee
Sobieski, as half of a sister-brother duo who move in with family
friends after the untimely deaths of their parents.  Little does she
know that her new guardian's motives are less than altruistic and it's
up to her to protect herself and her brother.</P>
<P>Few would classify Sobieski as a big movie opener, but she, much like
several other actors her age, has slowly been building her career with
notable roles in notable movies, and her burgeoning confidence shows
here.</P>
<P>There is little to fault in The Glass House as a whole.  Competently put
together, smartly acted, The Glass House is a continual slow build
toward revelation and resolution.  I for one was totally hooked, until
the final few moments, when after bursts of shock and terror, The Glass
House shatters into a thousand pieces.  Suddenly, the film casts off its
smart, suspenseful garb and trades that in for a final few moments of
homage to cheap slasher flicks and Hollywood murder clichés.</P>
<P>Even with its unworthy ending, The Glass House is a wholly entertaining
and thoughtful flick.  If nothing else, it scores points by avoiding the
ridiculous teen angst so often seen in other films with young casts. 
Instead, Glass House chooses to use the realities of a parental death
and its effect on children as a springboard to disturbing and dangerous
possibilities.</P>
<P>Without a more intelligent ending befitting its finely crafted build-up,
The Glass House dodges the realm of Hitchcockian excitement.  But even
without a proper resolution to bring things home, director Daniel
Sackheim doesn't get caught with his pants down in his feature film
debut.</P>
