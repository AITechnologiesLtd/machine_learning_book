<P>     For a long time during ANYWHERE BUT HERE, my attention was fixed
somewhere I didn't quite expect. Relationship dramas like this tend to be
all about character and performance -- every scene is an actor's scene,
every moment is an actor's moment. But to my surprise, I became fascinated
with the way the film looked. In this tale of a free-spirited single mom
named Adele August (Susan Sarandon) who moves herself and her reluctant
14-year-old daughter Ann (Natalie Portman) from Wisconsin to Beverly
Hills, cinematographer Roger Deakins does something cinematographers
rarely do in film: he makes Los Angeles look thoroughly unattractive. The
grainy film stock renders everything slightly fuzzy; the bleached colors
suck the golden glow out of Tinseltown. In a film about a woman who
expects her dreams to come true when she moves to a city of dreams, it
becomes compelling to watch it through Ann's eyes as a dreary and very
ordinary place.</P>
<P>    I mean no disrespect to Mr. Deakins or to the craft of cinematography
when I say that, even at the time, I knew ANYWHERE BUT HERE couldn't have
been working the way it was supposed to if I was paying attention to the
choice of film stock. This is, after all, a relationship story and a
character study, an exploration of those complex, contentious years when
mothers and daughters alternately hate each other and are each other's
best friends. It's been done before, of course -- even the kooky mother
and more stable daughter has been done before, in films like MERMAIDS --
but solid writing and strong performances can often counteract 
familiarity. </P>
<P>     ANYWHERE BUT HERE does come through with the strong performances.
Sarandon finds just the right balance between effervescence and
irresponsibility, her yearning for a better life always winding up just
this side of real life. Portman continues to show strong chops for a young
actress, navigating a similarly complicated path between devotion to her
mother and intense resentment. Their scenes together effectively capture
the perpetual tension between Ann and Adele, and do a particularly nice
job of showing Ann's frustration at being the real grown-up of the two
while never turning her into a wise-ass. There's never a moment when the
nuances of their relationship aren't front and center.</P>
<P>     And that may be why ANYWHERE BUT HERE feels so claustrophobic and
artificial. Director Wayne Wang (THE JOY LUCK CLUB) and screenwriter Alvin
Sargent are so intensely focused on Ann and Adele that there's virtually
no context for their lives. We see Ann walking uncomfortably through
Beverly Hills High on her first day of school, but there's no sense of her
struggle before she's giggling away with girlfriends; a few scattered
scenes of Adele in her job as a speech pathologist/therapist provides no
sense for why this flighty woman ever got into a field that demands so
much patience. Most disappointing, there's far too little background on
their lives in Wisconsin for us to understand why Adele wants to leave and
Ann wants to stay, and far too little development of the potentially
intriguing relationship between Ann and her almost-kissing-cousin Benny
(Shawn Hatosy). There's really not a single strong supporting character
ANYWHERE BUT HERE can bounce off of. It's no wonder these two drive each
other crazy -- they've been hermetically sealed away from the rest of the
world.</P>
<P>     One could argue that such an isolated, in-each-other's-face
relationship is precisely the point of ANYWHERE BUT HERE -- that Ann and
Adele have nothing in the world but each other, crazy-making as they may
be to each other. That doesn't make it any easier to spend two hours with
them -- and only them -- and their conflicts, well-acted though they may
be. I found myself straining for something or someone else to think about
every once in a while: the kindly cop (Michael Milhoan) who offers words
of wisdom for both Ann and Adele; Paul Guilfoyle's few seconds as one of
Adele's eager to please teaching colleagues; Corbin Allred as a nervous
suitor for Ann's affections. And of course there was the cinematography,
which -- while thematically appropriate -- also reminded me what ANYWHERE
BUT HERE was missing. This is a drama too lacking in background color.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mother and child unions:  5.</PRE>
