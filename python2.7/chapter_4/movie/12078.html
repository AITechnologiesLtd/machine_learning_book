<PRE>THE LAST SEDUCTION
**** of **** grade is A+</PRE>
<P>The Last Seduction is smart, sexy, dark, and funny.  Every scene is
briliant, a wonderful handling of film noir.  This is also a film that
offers up a delicious womans role, as a killer bitch, manipulating men
to do dirty tasks in the name of "love."  Linda Fiorentino plays the
lady, every man dream and nightmare.</P>
<P>Fiorentino has her husband sell pharmaceutical cocaine, then she steals
the money from him and heads to Chicago.  She holds up in a small town
outside of Buffalo caled Beston.  There she meets a guy and goes home
with him.  When consulting her lawyer later she is told to stay put and
find a job.  She does and continues to see this guy who complains, "I
feel like a sex toy" she responds "live it up."</P>
<P>Meanwhile her husband owes money to a loanshark that likes to break
thumbs, and he hires a private eye tofind this broad.  The plot twists
and twists to a conclusion that is totally satisfying, and darkly funny.</P>
<P>I can't say enough about Fiorentino's performance which goes for broke
and turns up a sly and brilliant performance that will make men cring
and turned on.  She deserved an academy award but was robbed on a
technicality, the film premiered on cable (the distributer HAD NO BALLS)
and thus she was robbed, and so was the film.  This is one of the best
films of the ninties, a great ride!</P>
