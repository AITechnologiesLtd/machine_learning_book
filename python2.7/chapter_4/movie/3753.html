Starring: Val Kilmer, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee-Jones, Nicole Kidman, Chris

<P>Produced by Tim Burton & Peter MacGregor-Scott
Written by  Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler, and Akiva Goldsman
Cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt</P>
<P>     Yes, the third installment of the caped crusader series is more
colorful and has probably more action than the other two.  It has two
red hot actors in Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.  It has a new,
younger, more popular hero in Val Kilmer. Above all this it even has
another red hot young actor portraying Batman's lovable side-kick
Robin; Chris O'Donnell, and a new love interest in Nicole Kidman's
shrink Chase Meridian.  However, what the film doesn't have is a strong
central character, any decent dialogue, or much of a reason to care
about any of the aforementioned characters.</P>
<P>     Val Kilmer, in surprisingly stiff portrayal, plays Bruce Wayne and
his alter-ego Batman.  Again we are involved in depiction's of Wayne's
unfortunate childhood experience and his reason for donning the the
black, rubber suit.  Without any back story at all, we are plunged into
Batman's personal and on-going struggle with former District Attorney
Harvey Dent, now known as "Two-Face."  Jones, simply copying his
character from NATURAL BORN KILLERS, sleeps his way through this film.
>From the first second we see him to the last, he maintains a one note
performance with nothing memorable to mention.  Kilmer, who we first
see as Wayne, is shockingly dry and bland.  When Kilmer was announced
as the new Batman many thought he would bring a flare to the character
that he has to many other performances.  Unfortunately, I am here to
say he doesn't.  In fact, he made Michael Keaton look like a virtual
glowing barrel of fun in comparison.  Batman has still not entered the
building.</P>
<P>     The rest of the film takes on the cliched by now Batman theme:
someone feels burned by our hero and then decides to seek revenge.
Along with Two-Face now is the Riddler played by Carrey.  At the start
of the film he is simply an electronics geek working at Wayne's
factory, but after his idea is shot down by Wayne, he is now a madman
who is after his old boss.  Teaming up with Two-Face, Carrey's Riddler
wreaks havoc on Batman with his new mind probing invention along with
hypnotizing the entire city.  On top of this of-course is Batman's love
interest, this time played by  Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian.  A
shrink who seems less interested in Batman's psyche than his cod-piece,
Kidman's character is less than a card-board cut out.  Kidman does okay,
but with what she was given I doubt many actresses could ignite a match
let alone the screen.  The only twist to this second sequel is the
addition of Dick Grayson played by O'Donnell.  Grayson's family are
taken care of by Two-Face and leaves Dick with a burning desire to
himself achieve revenge.  Grayson therefore becomes Robin, Batman's
trusted side-kick.  In all of this, someone forgot to write a good
character.  Carrey plays the same schtick he's been doing for years,
and O'Donnell like Kidman simply is given very little to mold.  He is
out for revenge and a young acrobatic kid- that's it!  Flashy and more
colorful than anything in all three films, the climax somehow leaves
you wondering when something is going to happen that will make you
really care about anyone.  Too late, the final credits are rolling!</P>
<P>     Technically there are some nice moments in the film, with great
visuals.  Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography is very eye catching, and
in obvious contrast to the other two films makes great use of color.</P>
<P>     What is most disappointing about this film is it again is written
for the villain, and not the hero.  Sure the first BATMAN was great in
that respect, but that was because of intelligent writing and well,
Jack Nicholson.  But here, as with the abominable first sequel, the
nemeses are so bland and repetitive that we have no emotion involved
with them.  If the Riddler decides to kill everyone or become a bank
teller, you don't really care.   When will someone write a film for
Batman!  The character is full of so many possibilities, to waste on
"I'll get drive-thru" is absurd and simply a let down.  Along with some
juicier writing, is going to have to be a director who can make Batman
come alive.  I don't mean he has to be a goof-ball, but a director who
can tell the difference between the lighter moments and the darker
ones.  Kilmer may be able to do it with a better director, but if this
film is anything to go by, we'll be waiting a long time.</P>
