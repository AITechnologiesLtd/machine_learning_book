<PRE>                        THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     If THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION sentences the audience to an
excessively long jail term, the very good news is that the long stay is
rewarded with first rate acting.  Just as you begin to long for a
fast-forward button for this masterful creation of the terrible tedium
of prison life, Director Frank Darabont turns his story into a fine
fairy tale.</P>
<P>     Opening ominously with Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) loading a gun
as the Ink Spots croon "If I Didn't Care" on the tape deck in his car,
the movie is driven for its full long length by Tim Robbins' portrait
of a man sentenced for murder to two life terms in Maine's Shawshank
prison.  Robbins' exceptional performance is matched every step of the
way by Morgan Freeman as Red, the prison's procurer of all contraband.
Another lifer, Red has served twenty years with a dignity and humor
that have turned him into Shawshank's elder statesman.  Red and Andy
share a value system that is rooted in restraint.</P>
<P>     It is 1947 and Andy, an eager, bright vice president of a Portland
bank, arrives at Shawshank to spend the rest of his life in a cell.
After enduring the beatings and sexual assaults accorded newcomers, he
settles into the monotony of life without hope.  It is a routine of
brutal explosions alternating with spirit-crushing boredom, and we are
made to feel every second of it.</P>
<P>     The enigmatic face Andy turns to his fellow prisoners gives no
clue to an inner plan.  He gradually uses his banking talents to become
the estate planner for the entire prison staff, including the sadistic
Warden, who is a Bible-quoting, tub-thumping, Christian hypocrite.
Andy quietly becomes indispensable and acquires the essential
ingredient of success: access.  Number 37927 does have a plan after
all.</P>
<P>     Watch for the sublime moment when Andy locks himself in the
communications room and pipes the duet from "The Marriage of Figaro"
into the prison yard.  Mozart stills the place with awe.  With the
exception of Bob Gunton, whose maniacal Warden crosses into caricature,
the cast is uniformly excellent and benefits, as any cast does, from
the presence of Morgan Freeman.  If there is a flaw in his role as
written, it is that his grace and dignity don't prepare us for the
fanciful turn the movie takes toward the end, when it becomes a fairy
tale, whose subtle clues were there all along.</P>
<P>     This welcome flight into the imagination adds lightness to earlier
improbabilities.  Andy and Red had sprung into this world and out of
it, it seems, without family or friends to root for them on the
outside.  And then, there's the matter of Andy's tastes.  How many
young bankers do you know who love opera, chess, the Bible, and
alabaster? These reservations, on reflection, reveal one reviewer who
was late in understanding the feathery notes that lift the movie out of
despair and touch it with hope.</P>
