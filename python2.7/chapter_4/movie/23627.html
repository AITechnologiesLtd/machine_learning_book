<PRE>Final Destination (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>Starring Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Kristen Cloke, Seann William
Scott, and Tony Todd. </P>
<P>Directed by James Wong
Written by Glen Morgan, Jeffrey Reddick, and James Wong        </P>
<P>Even if I did not know that director and co-writers James Wong and Jeffrey
Reddick of the creepy Final Destination helped create the hit television show
The X-Files, I would have inevitably made a connection. The similarities are
very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot, to the mysterious
characters, to the overall dark, ominous settings. It would have been perfectly
fitting to see FBI Agents Mulder and Scully investigate this case, they witness
stuff like this on a weekly basis (in fact Mulder and Scully would have been a
much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional FBI agents seen in this
movie). Another more important similarity, is that both succeed in entertaining
and thrilling at the same time. This is a great accomplishment for a teen
horror movie, especially when compared to some of the trash, of the same genre,
released in the last couple of years (Urban Legend and I Still Know What You
Did Last Summer are classic examples from the bunch). </P>
<P>What helps Final Destination is its unique premise. Unlike your average horror
flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders,
the villain presented is unusual, it's the Grim Reaper. This being already has
predestined when and how you will die. According to the brief history lesson
given in this film, everyone was meant to die at a certain time, some people at
100, others at 17, whatever Death chooses. What is unique about Death is that
it's already dead, so you can't really kill it. The only way to defeat Death is
to cheat it; the question is how do you do that? This dilemma is what faces
Alex and a group of teenagers. Alex has been having some dreams that the
airplane which will take his class on a trip to Paris will crash, leaving no
survivors. Alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and
eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it
takes off. Shortly after, the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven
survivors confused and others feeling immortal. However, Death isn't through
with them yet. It gradually kills off the seven one by one, leaving those
currently still alive frantically trying to trick Death again.</P>
<P>The plot allows for some of the most creative, original death scenes I have
seen in a while.  Some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an
elaborate climax, others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open
in shock. Creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror
films nowadays but Final Destination is not like most horror films. Sure, it
has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders (Ali Larter's character is
particularly annoying), but the shocks, from the beginning to the end, are
extremely entertaining. Also director Wong has the sense not to take the movie
too seriously. He knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that
won't win any Academy Awards (not even a Golden Globe). The myriad of inside
jokes and gags (the characters are named after famous horror directors, one
character who plays a jerk is named Carter, like X-Files creator Chris Carter,
and a song by John Denver, who died in a plane crash, plays whenever Death is
near) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie. And
from this, I had a great time watching the movie.</P>
