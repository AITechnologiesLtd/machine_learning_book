<PRE>                             THE GREEN MILE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     THE GREEN MILE?  Let's talk about 26 miles.  The length of a
marathon.  Start the race and the movie together: The race would long be
over before the film.  The winner would be at home, taking a nap.  Yes,
THE GREEN MILE is three hours long.</P>
<P>     Not that long movies have never been successful, and not that THE
GREEN MILE is bad.  You might even think a long movie is required here.
Pulled from Stephen King's acclaimed series of six books by the same
name, King returns to the kind of work he was doing in THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION (based on a short story of his), the kind that seems to
perform the best, away from splatter and gore, and into the minds of the
strangest of characters.</P>
<P>     The resemblance to SHAWSHANK is uncanny.  Both are epic prison
films that ultimately tell stories of personal growth and
enlightenment.  But THE GREEN MILE isn't about the prisoners, it's about
the guards -- and one, notable prisoner that crosses their paths.
Leading the crew of the 1935 southern prison is guard Paul Edgecomb (Tom
Hanks), a kind man who treats his death row inmates with all the dignity
he can.  His latest charge is John Coffey (Michael Duncan), a gentle
giant with alarming powers of the spirit who was convicted of killing
two little girls.</P>
<P>     Before it's time for Coffey to walk The Green Mile (the road to
"Old Sparky," the electric chair), he has a profound effect upon the
other guards and inmates.  And Paul is the centerpiece.  Mr. Jingles,
the prison's mouse, takes second billing.  The light bulbs, which
explode more dramatically and more often than in any other film in
history, take third.</P>
<P>     There's plenty here to make you laugh and cry, and director Frank
Darabont (who also did SHAWSHANK) knows how to tug each string.
Surprisingly, it's Hanks who is forgettable in his role, mainly because
his phony southern accent wavers unconvincingly between those used in
his parts in FORREST GUMP and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Duncan is the one to
watch here, and I'll put money on him right now for an Oscar nod.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the legacy of TITANIC has told directors that pacing is
irrelevant and a film's length can be boundless.  THE GREEN MILE even
bookends with Paul's character as an old man, looking back on his life
-- sound familiar?  But unlike TITANIC, you really feel the length in
this film, and it's just not necessary this time around.  I checked my
watch close to a dozen times during the film during the draggy parts --
a bad sign for those prone to sore butts.</P>
<P>     But maybe Darabont did this on purpose.  Sitting there, glued to my
seat, entranced by thoughts of what might happen next yet slowly rotting
while life passes me by outside... my, it feels just like I'm in prison,
waiting for my own trip down The Green Mile.</P>
