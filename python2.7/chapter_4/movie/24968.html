<PRE>Shanghai Noon (2000)</PRE>
<P>Just in time for students out of school for the summer, Jackie Chan appears 
in another American movie.  The Hong Kong action master is developing a 
trademark: as he did in RUSH HOUR with Chris Tucker, Chan teams up in 
SHANGHAI NOON with comic talent Owen Wilson for a lot of laughs.  The two 
cover the gamut of humor, Chan with his over-the-top physicality, Wilson 
with his quirky, incongruous, New Age-y cowboy.  It's lots of fun.</P>
<P>Although the plot is a creaky mix of clichés, director Tom Dey paces the 
story well, most scenes leading into action sequences that would keep any 
viewer watching.  What Dey and Chan treat us to once again is a series of 
absurd situations, the heroes (Chan as Chon Wang – do you get the 
sound-alike? And Owen Wilson as Roy O'Bannon) slipping into all kinds or 
peril only to survive by their wits or, in O'Bannon's case, by stupid luck.</P>
<P>Starting out in the Forbidden City, the story introduces us to the Chinese 
princess Pei Pei, played by Lucy Lui.  Because she is unhappy in her 
homeland, she gives in easily to the plot proposed by her American tutor – 
to leave the country for the States.  Naturally, this private teacher turns 
out to be just another smooth-talking bad guy, as it's a kidnapping plot 
disguised as a defection.  Once the princess is away, the emperor and his 
entourage  receive a ransom note, and proceed to dispatch three members of 
the Imperial guard,  three of the bravest men in the country.  Chon Wang 
tags along because of his fondness and loyalty to the princess, and he 
quickly finds trouble on the train on the dusty plains of the American West. 
  Though the two begin as antagonists, Chon and Roy fall together and even 
become friends.  Their goal is to rescue the beautiful Pei Pei and return 
her to China, and O'Bannon wouldn't mind if mines full of gold came his way 
in the process.  Another rub is that Pei Pei left her homeland under her own 
volition in the first place.</P>
<P>The main conflict that adds interest, beside the ongoing feud between Wang 
and O'Bannon, is the egregious kidnapper, Lo Fong, played by Roger Yuan.  
Head shaved, this young Asian actor easily plays a despicable master of 
martial arts and crime.  Among the adventures that entangle the heroes, a 
Native American woman (Brandon Merrill) – ostensibly Wang's wife – saves the 
day a few different times.  On the whole, not a very original premise, but a 
competent collection of fights and assorted witticisms.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan is unbeatable when it comes to mixing creativity and violence.  
If he were only around when Peter Sellers was fighting his manservant in the 
Pink Panther series!  Chan has been doing this business for so long that his 
effort here is seamless, the self-done stunts pieces of stunning 
choreography.  In one bar fight scene, Chon Wang grabs moose antlers off the 
wall, a perfect weapon with which to fend off a saloon full of belligerent 
cowpokes.  Jackie's English is improving, and he continues to display 
wonderful timing in virtually any scene he's in.</P>
<P>Wilson is the perfect choice for O'Bannon.  In some ways Wilson is a young 
Steve Martin, playing off incongruities with clever but subtle jokes.  His 
character is not quite the nebbish Woody Allen would make him, but there's 
this underlying, rather subtle hilarity that surrounds his performance.  
O'Bannon is good at heart, yes, but he can't avoid the temptation to pick up 
some money however he can.</P>
<P>Lucy Liu plays her part well enough, without having many lines.  The 
modernization of Eastern relationships is one of the more unbelievable 
facets bought to light by the narrative.  Chon Wang goes from obsequious 
bowing to familiar address at a rapid rate.</P>
<P>Working closely with Lo Fong, Marshal Van Cleef fills the role of another 
formidable baddie.  Xander Berkeley plays the role with a nice, sometimes 
almost cartoonish menace, keeping in tone with the exaggeration essential in 
a film of this genre.</P>
<P>The fight scenes in SHANGHAI NOON are very slick, humorous and engaging.  To 
fulfill his hallmark of brilliance within violence, Chan employs the 
antlers, a spinning sheriff's badge, even springy evergreens as weapons.  
His acrobatics are unmatched, his comic sense very natural.  He's certainly 
famous for doing his own stunt work, and the well-known out-takes running 
atop the closing credits make the watching of SHANGHAI NOON even more 
enjoyable.</P>
<P>Perhaps the film is not as fall-down funny as RUSH HOUR; some of the 
ridiculous business in that film cause belly laughs of the kind experienced 
on cool, fast amusement rides.  But neither is NOON as heavy in its 
subplots.  For fans of fights and buddy movies, this flick is a must-see.  
And for viewers unfamiliar with Jackie Chan, this piece would serve as a 
solid introduction.</P>
