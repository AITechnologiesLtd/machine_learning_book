WAG THE DOG (1997)
a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>WAG THE DOG is a sharp satire on the manipulation of public opinion through the
creation of "news."  Like DR. STRANGELOVE (1964), WAG will likely be referenced
by political commentators for decades to come.  </P>
<P>Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro), a professional problem solver, has been called in
by the White House to defuse a scandal-the President, nearing reelection, has
been accused of molesting a teenager.  Brean and White House staffer Winifred
Ames (Anne Heche) enlist movie producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to
create "a pageant"-a nonexistent war with Albania-to distract the media and the
public from the sex scandal.  Motss enthusiastically plots the storyline of the
war and deftly keeps the story going as unexpected events block their plans.  </P>
<P>One of WAG's points is that the experience of war for those not actually
fighting it is a collage of stirring images, patriotic songs, and memorials for
heroes.  Therefore, Brean and Motss give America a clip of an Albanian waif
(actually an actress played by Kirsten Dunst) fleeing explosions, numerous
songs, and a heroic soldier (Woody Harrelson) captured by the enemy.  The war
must have happened because, as Brean says several times, "I saw it on TV."</P>
<P>WAG's most obvious target is the use of military action as a political
smokescreen.  When the movie was released, many called it prophetic because,
around the same time, Clinton bombed Iraq in an obvious attempt to divert
attention from his own sex scandal.  However, Hilary Henkin and David Mamet's
screenplay drops references to Reagan and Bush's use of the same tactic.  In
many ways, WAG presents a better world-their war is bloodless.</P>
<P>Another satire, Michael Moore's CANADIAN BACON (1994), explores similar
territory.  In that film, the White House creates a state of tension between
the U.S. and Canada to replace the Cold War.  The message is the same:  having
a common enemy stirs up and unites the populace, and the power to manipulate
that effect has numerous political applications.  WAG is the better film; where
BACON descended into border-crossing hijinks and was weighed down by Moore's
use of its script as a soapbox, WAG is wonderfully subtle and rich in satiric
detail.</P>
<P>The relevance of WAG extends far beyond its parallels with recent history. 
Daniel Boorstin coined the term "pseudo-event" to describe an event which is
planned "for the immediate purpose of being reported."  With today's
technology, WAG THE DOG tells us, the pseudo-events can be more pseudo than
events.  Brean convinces Motss that the fake war can work by claiming that the
most famous image of the Gulf War was filmed on a sound stage with a small
model made of Legos.  Seeing may be believing, but can we believe what we see? 
As we are swept downstream in the constant rush of mass media, can we separate
the genuine from the artificial?  And, if documentary evidence is suspect, what
is history?  Brean adds a blues song to the 1930's by planting an album in the
Library of Congress.  Even history is suspect.</P>
