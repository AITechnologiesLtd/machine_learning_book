<PRE>The Postman
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Kevin Costner; Will Patton; Larenz Tate; Olivia Williams & James
Russo</P>
<P>The Postman is Kevin Costner's much-maligned movie that seems to always be
mentioned in the same breath as his other much-maligned movie, Waterworld.
While Waterworld deserved much of the criticism that it received, I think
that most people where a little bit too harsh on The Postman. By biggest
complaint with this movie was that it was a bit long. Other than that, it
really wasn't half bad. Sure, maybe it was a bit self-indulgent on Costner's
part, but self-indulgence is nothing new in Hollywood.</P>
<P>The Postman is set in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States,
specifically Oregon. It is several years into the future and there has been
a civil war in the US, and the government is now in ruins. The man with the
power in this part of the country is General Bethlehem (Will Patton). He
maintains his power through fear and with the help of his somewhat ragtag
army. Kevin Costner plays a down on his luck actor who stumbles across the
dead body of a US postal carrier whose body had been there from the time of
the war. Costner assumes the identity of the postal carrier in the hopes
that he might be able to weasel some food out of one of the local
communities. The locals buy his story that he is a postman and a
representative of the newly restored US government. In fact, he is so
convincing that he inadvertently inspires a whole legion of postal carriers
who work for the newly restored US government. The fact that there is no
newly restored government is something that none of these postal carriers
ever seem to figure out. Anyway, these new representatives of the US
government pose a threat to the power of General Bethlehem, so he decides
that they should be eliminated. The rest of the movie follows how Costner's
character goes from being a con man to believing in the hope that has sprung
from his lies.</P>
<P>The Postman is a bit hokey in places, but for the most part, it works quite
well. By the end of the movie I even started to like Costner's character. I
never really disliked him; I just didn't care about him in the least. Lorenz
Tate gives a great performance as Ford Lincoln Mercury (named after the
ruins of a local car dealership), the young man who is the first to be
inspired by the postman. It is he who later inspires Costner's postman.
Olivia Williams plays Costner's love interest in this movie. For the most
part, this really didn't work for me. Although by the end of the movie I was
actually starting to root for the two of them. For me, the man who really
made this movie was Will Patton as the evil general. Costner fans might
recognize him as the bad guy in one of Costner's earlier films, No Way Out.
Patton gave the best performance of the movie, and his character was, by
far, the most interesting. Other cute casting touches included Tom Petty as
a guy who used to be famous before the war. And while it was fun to see Tom,
and his performance was pretty good, I wouldn't recommend him for the lead
in a Shakespearean drama anytime soon.</P>
<P>My main criticism of The Postman is that it could have stood a little more
time in the editing room. I'd hazard a guess and say that a half an hour
could have easily been cut from this film. The result would have made for a
significantly more enjoyable experience. But if you don't mind long movies
(especially ones with lags in the action) and a little self-indulgence on
the part of a Hollywood heavy hitter, The Postman isn't all that bad. My
only hope is that the next time Costner decides to make one of his epics
that the studio makes him keep it to a manageable length.</P>
