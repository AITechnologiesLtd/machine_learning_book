<PRE>                                 SOMMERSBY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a surprisingly satisfying
     remake and enhancement of THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE.  It
     may offer as much to people who have seen the original as to
     those who have not.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The day I am writing this review Siskel and Ebert had an episode in
which they reviewed five films of which four--SOMMERSBY, THE VANISHING,
HOMEWARD BOUND, and GUN CRAZY--are remakes.  There are hard choices to make
when you remake somebody else's film.  Do you just reproduce the original or
do you vary things?  When you vary the telling, can you really improve on
the original?  Does your film have something to offer people who have seen
the original?  SOMMERSBY is a rather remarkable remake of the 1982 film THE
RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE.  SOMMERSBY is Nicholas Meyer and Anthony Shaffer's
retelling of the MARTIN GUERRE story with some very ironic complexities
added.  And there is enough complexity in this film that, in fact, it may be
a better film the first time through if you have some idea what twists are
coming.  Meyer and Shaffer have balanced their story so it is equally
rewarding if you have or have not seen the original.</P>
<P>     The Civil War has been over for two years in Vine Hill, Tennessee, and
Laurel Sommersby (played by Jodie Foster) is about ready to declare herself
a widow and remarry.  If the truth be known, Jack Sommersby was always
better at being a "good old boy" than he was at being a husband.  But then
Jack (played by Richard Gere) returns from a Union prison camp determined to
improve Vine Hill in general and his marriage in specific.  His six-year
absence has made a new man of Jack, so much so that people start to question
if perhaps this new man might really not be Jack.  Jack sets about trying to
fix up the war-ravaged valley and to give a boost to the economy.  Or is he
just trying a confidence scheme?  What Jack is doing and why he is doing it
make this a very different film from the original.  One negative touch is
that the film's attitudes towards race relations seem a bit anachronistic,
but they are not quite as pat as they first seem.</P>
<P>     Kudos goes to Meyer and Shaffer's story which was adapted by Meyer and
Sarah Kernochen into a screenplay.  Director John Amiel, who also directed
television's "Singing Detective," gives us a complex story beautifully
photographed to give a strong post-Civil War feel.  While the score has a
much more traditional tone than most of Danny Elfman's scores, it is a very
likable, melodic score.  SOMMERSBY is at least satisfying and often is
poignant.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
