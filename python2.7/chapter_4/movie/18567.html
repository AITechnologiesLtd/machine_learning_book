<PRE>GET SHORTY (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Simon Doherty</PRE>
<P>Director Barry Sonnenfeld in now best known for the blockbuster Men in
Black, but previously his biggest hit was this slick comedy.  John
Travolta plays Chilli Palmer, a loan shark with an idea for a movie
that he's pitching to washed up producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman).
However, Zimm has blown money gambling that he owes to shady character
Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo).  We also meet actress Karen Flores (Rene
Russo), the ex-wife of Hollywood star Martin Weir (Danny DeVito), who
Chilli wants to be in his film.</P>
<P>Get Shorty is based on an Elmore Leonard book, and was the first film
to successfully evoke the author's cool, witty style.  It has since
been joined by Jackie Brown and Out of Sight as the best Leonard
adaptations, although Get Shorty is closer to the upbeat Out of Sight
than the slower, more thoughtful Jackie Brown.  The story is
convoluted, and it becomes tricky to remember who owes money to whom
as the many characters flit across the screen.  However, the plot is
largely irrelevant, the film being driven by the snappy dialogue and
excellent acting.  Travolta consolidated his comeback after Pulp
Fiction, creating a charismatic character with understated menace.
Hackman is as good as always, and Dennis Farina steals the film as Ray
‘Bones' Barboni, Palmer's underworld boss, who delivers many
of the funniest moments (‘Don't puke on my shoes, Harry').
DeVito also relishes the chance to send up his own image.  The
screenplay draws the characters sharply and makes them all
entertaining, a considerable achievement given that most of them are
pretty unpleasant people.  Sonnenfeld also gets credit for this; he
keeps the tone light even during the violence.  He also gets the
pacing just right, keeping the viewer absorbed whilst developing the
characters fully.  Unusually for a Hollywood film, the ending avoids
tying up too many loose ends, keeping it at a tight 105 minutes.  It
also enables the movie to finish with a memorable final image.</P>
<P>Get Shorty epitomises cool 90's film-making; fast talking, stylish
characters, knowing references to real life movies and actors, and a
funky soundtrack by John Lurie that fits the mood perfectly.
Definitely recommended if you liked Pulp Fiction, Scream or Out of
Sight, and the plot vagaries also make a second viewing worthwhile.</P>
