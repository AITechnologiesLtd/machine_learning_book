A Bug's Life (1998)</PRE>
<P>The State of Movie-going in Late 1998:  A Review of "A Bug's Life" and 
the Theater Showing It</P>
<PRE>by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>November 26 - Thanksgiving Day.  On a visit to my in-laws', we drive out 
to the Showcase Cinemas, a ten-plex in the wilds of western Cincinnati.  
In the lobby the ticket counter seems to be closed, but I'm told to go 
to the one clear on the other side of the lobby.  It's a big place, with 
mammoth hype displays for A Bug's Life and the Rugrats movie, arcade 
games and ripoff fish-for-a-dinky prize games.  There's even a "Customer 
Service" counter that doubles as an outlet for movie merchandise, 
trinkets and polyester caps and twenty-dollar t-shirts.  </P>
<P>We're here for the 2:10 show, and I'm thinking good: bargain matinee 
prices, when I see the sign for $5 each.  That's OK, it's a family 
outing, my wife and I and our two kids, the first day of a four-day 
weekend from school.</P>
<P>We opt not to visit the array of refreshment counters:  this is a short 
film and, besides, we must save our appetites for my mother-in-law's 80 
pound turkey.  So the wallet does not take another hit for popcorn, or 
worse, 6-dollar-a-pound candy from plexiglass bins mounted on the wall.  
The carpet that covers the acreage of lobby and corridors leading to the 
auditoriums is gaudy, stuff you would never want in your house, even in 
the 1970's.  Outside each screen there's an electronic message board 
with abbreviated titles:  Enemy of State, Pig in City, Bugs Life (not 
only the syntax ruined, but the punctuation shot as well).  Ushers with 
tiny brooms and dustpans hang around the doorways and call to each 
other, occasionally eyeing the patrons suspiciously.  In our theater we 
are pleased to find the newer generation of chairs, ones that rock and 
hold your cup and pad your back and seat.  We sit on the end of a 
staggered row, so my daughter cannot be blocked by any tall, hat-wearing 
man.  As the lights dim we can see only the light-embedded plastic 
stripping that lines the aisles.</P>
<P>Then the previews, at least five of them, the last one the trailer for 
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, the one my son has been longing to see.  
(After this last, Billy and his mother both get up as if to leave, the 
best part of their viewing over!)  Oh, and before the film starts, we 
are treated to that most rare aperitif, a cartoon!  It's Pixar's "Geri's 
Game," an award-winning animated short about an old man playing chess, 
against himself, on a table in an otherwise deserted park.  It's a 
delightful and sweet story, uncomplicated but thick with imagination, 
the kind of story Chekov or O. Henry would have loved to watch.</P>
<P>A Bug's Life is an entertaining film with a decent story and astounding 
computer-generated animation.  This is the best animation yet of this 
sort - the facial features of the ants and their rival grasshoppers 
possess the elasticity of real faces, and the expressions and body 
movements mimic actual motion without a hint of choppiness or other 
animated fraud.  It's quite an accomplishment for Pixar and all the 
women and men who worked on it.</P>
<P>Down to the slightest swaying of the trees, the animation is the real 
star of this show.  Everything is fun to look at, and I imagine one 
could pay to see A Bug's Life many times before taking in a good deal of 
the panorama of action and detail in every shot.  The colors are 
artfully chosen (even though it's unclear to me why the ants' bodies are 
bluish gray);  they are tones that occur in nature, with a few bright 
bugs and a bird thrown in for vividness.  Even though I saw Toy Story 
twice at the cinema and countless times on video, I am still getting 
used to viewing this type of animation:  I feel like turning to my kids 
and saying, "In my day we were lucky to have color in our cartoons, and 
your grandpa was lucky to have sound!"  In short, the film gives us a 
visual banquet of images, and I wouldn't be averse to returning for more 
helpings.</P>
<P>John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton are the directors, and they have done a 
fine job with perspectives and pace.  Lasseter and Don McEnery wrote the 
screenplay, which includes generous amounts of humor.  What's cool is 
that you can pick and choose among the humorous moments, according to 
your age.  There are takes on all the bug jokes you can think of, 
there's plenty of slapstick (literally!), and there are even a few 
cerebral pokes, such as the shtick involved with German accents (the 
caterpillar Heimlich) and with a queen ant assisted by Phyllis Diller's 
entire routine - a "Fang"-like old guy, a small dog-like aphid, and 
Diller's precious voice and laugh.  </P>
<P>The plot is successful but not as strong as other aspects.  We see the 
independent thinking Flik (voice of Dave Foley), an ant who has broken 
away from the ranks and invented a device to make harvesting easier.  
Although he is sharp and well-intentioned, Flik is also dense enough to 
repeatedly endanger the colony.  He is known to the royal family, and 
quickly falls in love with the queen's daughter Atta (voice of Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus).  When Flik accidentally ruins the food the ants have 
gathered for the mean grasshoppers, the colony is faced with gathering 
twice as much food, or facing the wrath of the larger insects as soon as 
the last leaf falls.  When autumn comes we are set up for the showdown, 
and it is an engaging one to watch.  </P>
<P>If you saw even a trailer for DreamWorks' Antz, do the plot elements of 
A Bug's Life seem nearly identical?  I have purposely forgotten many of 
the details surrounding the genesis of Antz, the premise perhaps coming 
along with an executive from Disney to the newer studio.  But Disney has 
a right to be upset at the derivative nature of the film that was begun 
later but released earlier.  It is difficult to say which is the better 
film.  I have already declared Pixar's animation superior.  As far as 
target audiences, A Bug's Life is more appropriate for children.  Not 
that Antz doesn't work for kids - it's just that in many ways it is a 
vehicle for Woody Allen, who does the voice of an neurotic ant who bucks 
the system, falls in love with the princess, and saves the colony.  Antz 
has a greater number of jokes that Mom and Dad would enjoy.  </P>
<P>My call is that Antz owns the edge for voices.  Gene Hackman, the 
inimitable Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Allen - these actors 
lend their character voices that are quirky, unique and memorable.  
Outstanding talents in A Bug's Life include Diller, David Hyde Pierce as 
Slim the walking stick, and John Ratzenberger as the circus-owning flea.  
Other actors do a very adequate job, but fail to go over-the-top in a 
way that makes you chuckle just to remember the funny dimension to a 
voice itself.  For instance, why didn't Lasseter have Louis-Dreyfus to 
an Elaine-ism, crying, "Get out!" and pushing Flik backwards?  Where are 
Andy Devine, June Foray and Sterling Holloway when you need them?</P>
<P>An aside:  you must stay for the closing credits.  Randy Newman sings 
one of his funky songs (why didn't you do more with lyrics, Randy?);  
and there are belly laugh-inducing outtakes that are well worth being 
last to leave the theater.</P>
<P>My children claim not to like one film better than the other.  I would 
as soon sit through Antz a second time.  But for pure visual enjoyment, 
A Bug's Life is beautiful.  I recommend you find a reasonably priced 
theater, smuggle in Reese's Cups and Twizzlers, and share an afternoon 
with the kids in your life.</P>
