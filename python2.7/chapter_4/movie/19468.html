<P>Zack Winestine's "States of Control" is a frustrating and disappointing film, 
and yet, I feel guilty writing such criticisms at this exact moment because 
for the first 70 minutes of this 84-minute indie drama, it was edging up to 
become a major contender on my top ten list of the year, come next January. 
The film is, next to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, "Eyes Wide Shut," one of 
the most provocative motion pictures I've seen in the last year, as it deals 
with a woman struggling to break free from the artificial materialism that 
the world around her has so stringently begun to depend on. </P>
<P>Lisa (an eye-opening, perfectly-cast Jennifer Van Dyck) is an unsatisfied 
married woman in her early-30's who works at a small theater company in 
Manhattan. Her relationship with her husband, Abel (Stephen Bogardus), is 
seriously faltering, both for the passionless, controlled time they spend 
with one another, and because of Abel's impotency. Purposefully not sleeping 
and writing in her journal at all hours of the night about her internal 
struggle for spontaneity, Lisa's feelings are best identified by Paul (John 
Cunningham), a stern older man who steps in as the director of the company's 
latest play, and who is very truthful to Lisa about everything (he believes 
the novel she has spent years on is worthless; he constantly does not allow 
Lisa to talk about her past and he speaks none about his own because he 
believes it makes for boring conversation, etc.). Left alone at night for 
long periods of time while Abel is at work, and sexually starved herself, 
Lisa finally picks up enough courage to go into an adult video store and buy 
a porno flick, taking it home and watching it. Additonally, she is firmly 
against most technological advances and longs for the days when things could 
be more simple. While at a music shop with her friend, she states that it is 
getting more difficult to find records: "Once LPs came out, everything became 
background music."</P>
<P>"States of Control" is, indeed, a difficult film to identify. A truly offbeat 
character study of a woman, the movie obviously is anything but a big-studio 
picture, as it follows Lisa through a series of different vignettes and 
relationships, and relies on the excellent, often funny dialogue rather than 
big plot developments. Director Zack Winestine, making his first 35mm feature 
film, has written a multi-layered, engrossing screenplay and carries the 
camera well, too, as he paints a desolate, overly ordinary picture of New 
York City that mirrors the way Lisa's life will remain if she doesn't fight 
for the right to make her own decisions. In short, she is utterly sick of 
trying to make everyone else happy, and desperately wants to finally do what 
she wants to do.</P>
<P>The movie gains a lot of laughs from the on-target dialogue alone, such as 
when she is looking around in the adult video store. Aiding the help of a 
male customer on how he chooses which movie to get, she asks, "what do you 
look for in the films you buy? Is it a particular actor, or the story?" 
Another equally witty dialogue exchange is between Lisa and Paul when they 
are eating at a restaurant. After Lisa reveals she has written a mediocre 
novel, Paul asks if he could borrow it to read. "You won't like it," Lisa 
assures him, to which Paul quickly replies, "well, at least then we will have 
something in common." It is this sort of fine-spun dialogue that I delight in 
when I'm looking for a comedy, as opposed to non-stop physical comedy and 
gags (although, let it be known, I also absolutely love 1980's "Airplane!" 
and the whole "Naked Gun" series). </P>
<P>As many supposedly liberating things that Lisa does in the course of the 
film, however, they only lead to disappointment and an even further need for 
self-fulfillment. Concerning the adult video she takes home to watch, she 
finds the experience anticlimactic. When a photographer friend takes her on 
one of her intimate shoots, Lisa can't go through with the sexually revealing 
things she is expected to do with the male model. A one-time affair with Paul 
ends with him not wanting to talk to her afterwards while they're in bed, 
even though Lisa has something important she wants to say. </P>
<P>All of these failed attempts at freedom lead to the film's last fifteen 
minutes. Before this, it would be safe to say that I was loving every minute 
of the movie, only to be severely let down by the denouement. Predicting that 
the conclusion would stay on an even level with the rest of the movie, I 
expected something a bit less drastic to happen, shall we say, than what 
finally occurs. It would be unfair to give away the particulars of the 
ending, but it was extremely unconvincing, to say the least, and director 
Winestine's only major misstep. "States of Control," as a whole, is an 
astute, thought-provoking film, but the ending left me just as dissatisfied 
as Lisa is throughout the movie, in her journey to not follow by the rules of 
today's superficial society.</P>
