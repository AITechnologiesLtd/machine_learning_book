<P>13-year old Wei (Wei Minzhi) has just shown up at a poor, remote and
barren Chinese farming village on the foothills of a mountain. She is
there to substitute teach in the local primary school for one month.
Nobody--including us, the audience of "Not One Less"--expects much.
Our expectations are diminished on two levels. We consider it unlikely
that an untrained youngster could educate a roomful of unruly students
just a few years younger than herself. Also, we consider it unlikely
that a feature film based on such a situation and using a
non-professional cast can entertain. Director Zhang Yimou, best known
for ambitious period dramas like "Raise the Red Lantern," takes such
modest material and transforms it into a powerful neo-realist story
that evokes the larger drama unfolding in Chinese society. </P>
<P>"Not One Less," second cousin to other recent neo-realist works such
as the Brazilian "Central Station" and the American "La Ciudad," is an
advocate for the victims of the global economic transformation some
call "neoliberalism." Poor rural folk, who are losers in the
free-market lottery society, have to eke out a living on the margins
of bustling urban centers. Their only hope is to find a way to crack
into the successful inner circle of the city folk. The neo-realist
genre of today questions whether such a pursuit is really worth it.</P>
<P>The movie's title derives from an informal contract between the
school's regular teacher and Wei. After he returns from his one month
leave of absence, she will be paid 57 yuan. But only if every student
is still in attendance. Not only is he parsimonious with the wage
contract, he also doles out supplies with an eye-dropper. He counts
out 26 pieces of chalk, one for each day of the month excluding
Sundays. Since the one room school is falling apart at the seams, we
understand that the teacher has no alternative. As we might expect, a
form of "TINA" has found its way into the nooks and crannies of
Chinese socialist society. If a poor farming village can not provide
commodities for the world market, why would we expect a classroom to
reflect anything different from the surrounding poverty?</P>
<P>As he spells out her duties, it is clear that she is barely up to the
task. Since she doesn't know the first thing about teaching, the best
she can do is copy lessons from the teacher's textbook on the
blackboard--making sure not to exceed her chalk ration for that day.
After she has finished transcribing the words, the students will then
dutifully enter them into their composition books. He reminds her that
since the chalk is so precious, she should be careful not to waste it.
She should write large enough so that the students can see the
characters on the board, but not too large. Pointing to the barnyard
outside the schoolroom, he says that the size of a donkey turd is just
about right. Wei asks the teacher when she should dismiss the students
each day. Since there is no clock in the schoolroom, he explains that
the day ends when the setting sun falls upon a pole at one end of the
room. What if it is overcast? Then send them home early.</P>
<P>For the first few days, as we might expect, chaos rules in the
classroom. After Wei has finished transcribing a lesson on the board,
she closes the door on the students like a jailer and sits on the
front stoop playing with her fingers. Only when they begin to run
wild, she goes back into the schoolroom and tries to restore order.</P>
<P>The most disruptive student is Zhang (Zhang Huike), a boy who enjoys
being the class clown and defying Wei. What he does not realize is
that Wei is as strong-willed as him and will not allow him to have his
way. The relationship between these two characters shapes the
narrative of the film, especially when Zhang is forced to leave school
and go to the city to find work. Although he has made things rough for
her in the classroom, she needs to track him down in the city and
bring him back to the school because of the "not one less" contract.
But it is not just money that motivates her. She understands that a
young child on his own has little chance of survival in the city.</P>
<P>Getting to the city is no easy task since she lacks the money for bus
fare. Her students have now begun to rally around her and pledge to
help raise the necessary funds. Accompanied by them like the Pied
Piper, she marches off to a nearby brick factory where they hope to
make some money moving bricks from one place to another. The wages, as
you would expect, are meager. This scene evokes the scene in "La
Ciudad," where Latino workers spend an entire day in the rubble of
demolished buildings cleaning bricks. As in "La Ciudad" there is a
struggle to get a sufficient wage. Wei and the students bicker with
the factory owner after their job is done--done without his knowledge
or permission in fact--to get him to fork over the yuans necessary to
pay her bus fare.</P>
<P>Haggling over money is a persistent theme throughout the film and the
director Zhang leaves no doubt as to his disgust with the cash nexus
overtaking China. It is difficult to think of another film in recent
history which features so many scenes involving struggles over fees,
wages, prices and debts. It is reminiscent in some ways of a Balzac
novel, which inevitably depicts the denizens of Paris involved in
similar haggling. 19th century Paris, like the cities being
transformed in China today, are battlegrounds over the most universal
of commodities: money.</P>
<P>When Wei arrives in the city, she begins her search in the railroad
station. Like the "Central Station" in the Brazilian film, this
central station is filled with the poor and the displaced. It is used
as a bedroom and bathroom for people who have no other place to go. It
is also a magnet for youngsters who are either begging or stealing to
survive. Wei's search begins here but she soon ends up walking up and
down the streets of the city, appearing as forlorn and as displaced as
the Latinos in "La Ciudad." Her encounters with the impatient and
money-driven urban dwellers do not deter her, however. This young
woman who will not cry uncle symbolizes the peasant roots of the
Chinese revolution, which the director Zhang has not lost sight of.
Even when she forgets the words to the militant Maoist Chinese
national anthem, there is no question as to her class instincts.</P>
<P>Reviewers of "Not One Less" have dwelled on what is considered an
artificial happy ending, which they view as a token to government
pressure. To make a film that was uncompromisingly bleak, they argue,
is impossible in today's China where the hostile economic forces being
depicted in the film have official government sanction.</P>
<P>This is a facile view as one might expect from critics in an
imperialist country that is responsible for the economic
contradictions that forced China to retreat from socialism in the
first place. When a major Hollywood studio bankrolls a film like "La
Ciudad," then these critics might have stronger grounds for such
sanctimonious criticisms. In the meantime, there is much that
socialists can take heart from in "Not One Less." It is a sign that
the embers of social justice have not been extinguished in China. For
as long as directors like Zhang Yimou are given a platform in China,
there is evidence that the revolutionary spirit has not been
vanquished.</P>
