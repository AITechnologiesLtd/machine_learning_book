<P>     So much for Adam Sandler, "normal" guy.  In THE WEDDING SINGER, it
looked as though Sandler were trying to shrug off the infantile,
silly-voiced persona he took from "Saturday Night Live" to BILLY MADISON
and HAPPY GILMORE.  While still fairly silly in its own way, THE WEDDING
SINGER was a somewhat more mature, somewhat more clever vehicle for
Sandler, and his first attempt at actual screen acting.  In THE WATERBOY,
Sandler is once again in infantile, silly-voiced rare form, the kind of
character that strikes unholy terror in a critic's heart.</P>
<P>     It would be a gross exaggeration to call THE WATERBOY a smart film,
but it's funny in ways I didn't quite expect.  Sandler plays a 31-year-old
simpleton bayou boy named Bobby Boucher who still lives with his
domineering Mama (Kathy Bates) and has been the University of Louisiana's
water boy for 18 years.  When U. of L.'s nasty Coach Beaulieu (Jerry Reed)
finally fires Bobby, the hydrophilic lad hooks up with the hapless South
Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs, led by jittery Coach Klein.
Coach Klein inadvertently unleashes Bobby's inner linebacker when he
encourages Bobby to defend himself against the taunting of team members,
discovering in the process one of the greatest pass rushers in college
football history.  Thus are the Mud Dogs on their way to their greatest
season -- and, naturally, a showdown with the University of Louisiana --
provided they can keep over-protective Mama from finding out her baby boy
is playing "the foosball."</P>
<P>     The opening minutes of THE WATERBOY don't hold out much hope for
anything beyond 12-year-old comic sensibilities.  Sight gags predominate,
from a football hitting Bobby in the head, to pratfalls over a water
cooler, to Sandler motoring about on a riding lawn mower.  Yawn-inspiring
running jokes involve a perpetually drunken cheerleading squad, a pair of
dim-witted die-hard fans (Clint Howard and Allen Covert), and an assistant
coach (Blake Clark) who speaks in an incomprehensible accent.  A few
giggles leak out of the predictabe sophomorism, while Sandler's
stuttering, soft-spoken variation on Cajun Man threatens to wear out his
welcome very early on.</P>
<P>     Then something strange happens some time after the fourth or fifth
reference to Bobby's backwater, snake-and-squirrel-eating background.  The
dialogue starts getting sharper, including Bobby's bizarre cover story to
Mama for his football-related bruises.  Sandler starts getting more
endearingly innocent rather than acting like an oblivious moron.  And the
sight gags start getting funnier, perhaps as much related to a build-up of
good will as to any change in approach.  The incongruous presence of Bates
and Winker (the latter sporting decidedly un-Fonzie-esque love handles)
certainly helps, but there's something about the writing in THE WATERBOY
that kept sneaking up on me, delivering a left-field laugh at times when I
was expecting an obvious bit of slapstick idiocy.</P>
<P>     Many people probably associate Sandler with moron comedy in the
Ernest/Pauly Shore/Carrot Top vein, perhaps without having seen any of his
films.  He and frequent writing partner Tim Herlihy are considerably more
sly than that.  They've learned a few lessons in grown-up comedy from THE
WEDDING SINGER, and bring that sensibility to the lower common denominator
audience targeted with THE WATERBOY.  They certainly miss the target
plenty of times -- Rob Schneider's extended cameo gets more insufferable
every time he appears -- but they also don't fire at the same stupid
target over and over again.  Between the lethargic opening and the
who-cares romance between Sandler and bad girl Fairuza Balk, THE WATERBOY
offers goofy entertainment.  It appears Sandler doesn't have to be
"normal" to be funny.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cool waters:  6.</PRE>
