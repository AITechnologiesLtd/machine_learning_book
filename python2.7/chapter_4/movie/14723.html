<PRE>Baxter (1988)
Review By: Ryan Davis
French w/ Subtitles
2/27/98</PRE>
<P>        Talking dogs might sound like kids stuff, but Baxter is far from a kids
film. Its an extremely dark look at communism, which can't be categorized into
just one genre, it's horror, suspense, thriller, and an intense character
driven film. Also its about a dog that thinks.</P>
<P>        Baxter(a dog) is given to an older women, Ms. Deville who overcomes
her fear of him to annoy the dog to death. You see, Baxter wants a challenge
he wants to be told what to do. Unfortunately Ms. Deville, has a tragic
"accident" and dies. Baxter is handed of to a young couple who lives close
by, who Baxter has admired from afar. He is happy and content with his life
until the women has a creature(Baxter's word for baby). Shortly after the
birth, the baby has a near-fatal "accident" and the young couple decides its
best to get rid of Baxter. He is finally given to a young teenager Charles,
who has a Hitler complex. Baxter has found his master and listen to Charles
commands to the end, and learns a lesson "Don't Obey"</P>
<P>        Baxter can be viewed on to levels, as a social commentary or a funny
little movie about a talking dog. Baxter is a brilliant film, the script and
direction are flawless and it is very interesting. Charles(François
Driancourt) gives an engaging performance as the young sadist, and all the
other actors/actresses are very convincing. The script is brilliant and
thought provoking, showing us the general publics want to be told what to do,
no matter what it is. If you can stand reading subtitles during a movie, go
rent this one, its a film worthy of several viewings.</P>
