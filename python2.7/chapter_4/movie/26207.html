<PRE>DANCER IN THE DARK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>It's amateur night at the movies in DANCER IN THE DARK, the musical 
written and directed by Lars von Trier (BREAKING THE WAVES).  From 
factory floor production numbers to death row dances, the movie doesn't 
shy away from unusual locales for singing and dancing.  But with musical 
numbers that are so awful that they are only one notch away from the 
musical spoof in THE PRODUCERS, DANCER IN THE DARK isn't likely to have 
you running out to purchase its soundtrack.  If this movie were ever to 
open on Broadway, they could hold the opening and closing night parties 
simultaneously.</P>
<P>There may be those that will argue that Trier, famous for the stern 
DOGMA 95 manifesto -- under whose rules this picture wasn't made, 
although it was shot on digital video -- wants DANCER IN THE DARK to be 
viewed as a tragedy.  If that is how we are to evaluate it, then there 
is even less to recommend it.</P>
<P>European singer Björk stars as Selma, the story's dirt-poor heroine, who 
is rapidly going blind.  Not a professional actress, Björk, with her 
awkward and unreal performance, is unlikely to ever be mistaken for an 
actress.  (For the record, she does at least have a lovely smile.)  As a 
drama, the story requires one suspension of disbelief after another.  </P>
<P>Selma has a congenital disorder that will cause her to go blind within a 
year.  She has been saving up for an operation for her son so that he 
will not suffer the same fate.  Working two shifts at a factory that 
requires her to operate heavy machinery and rehearsing for an amateur 
production of "The Sound Of Music," she must have little time for the 
preteen son that she is trying to save.</P>
<P>Selma's passion is the movie musical.  She loves watching musicals and 
making up her own routines to which she sings and dances, along with 
other members of the cast.  An essential ingredient of musicals is music 
that is worth hearing.  In DANCER IN THE DARK, the songs are more spoken 
than sung, and they are excruciatingly bland.  You know the songs are 
coming because the movie's drab color palette, which approximates a 
faded home movie, is changed to oversaturated colors reminiscent of old 
Technicolor musicals.</P>
<P>Speaking of filming, you'd better take along your motion sickness 
medicine to DANCER IN THE DARK, which frequently looks like it was 
filmed during a series of earthquakes.  If your son panned and zoomed 
this much with your family's camcorder, you'd lecture him and then erase 
the tape.</P>
<P>The body of the morose movie concerns a murder and Selma's imprisonment.  
It also includes two quite horrific scenes.  This movie, which has 
produced widely different opinions from praise to derision, is an uneasy 
one to view because some of the scenes, especially toward the end, are 
so manipulative and ridiculous that they are laughably bad.  
Nevertheless, out of respect for those around you who may have bought 
into the story's premise, you feel compelled to hold your laughter.  
It's not easy.</P>
<P>DANCER IN THE DARK runs a long 2:20.  It is rated R for violence and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
