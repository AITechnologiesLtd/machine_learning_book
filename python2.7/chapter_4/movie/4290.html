<PRE>                                 GOLDENEYE
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>     GOLDENEYE is the much anticipated debut of Pierce Brosnan as
everyone's favorite spy.  After a delay of over ten years, we finally
get to see Remington Steel utter the phrase, "Vodka martini, shaken,
not stirred." Was it worth the wait?  Well, yes, overall.  Mr.  Brosnan
was born to play Bond, a realization that first came to me when I saw
him in the middling to poor film adaptation of Forsythe's THE FOURTH
PROTOCOL.  In short, he fills the lines of the tuxedo quite nicely.
He's more of a man's Bond than Roger Moore was, and he doesn't have the
slightly stiff look that Dalton had.</P>
<P>     The plot is typical Bond fare, with a slight twist as we get a 00
agent other than Bond into the mix.  But no one goes to Bond films for
the plot.  These movies are a plethora of action, women, guns, evil
Communists (oh, and good Communists--it's the 90's) and the triumph of
good over evil.</P>
<P>     The gizmos are not nearly as inspired as they have been, but in a
refreshing change of pace, not every single gizmo given to Bond is used
during the course of the film.</P>
<P>     In short, if you like Bond films in general, Goldeneye is a film
worth seeing.  Certainly better then Moondreck (MOONRAKER) and it
doesn't have the presence of Tonya Roberts (A VIEW TO A KILL) to drag
it down into the depths.  The villains are outstanding, and 006 almost
walks away with the film.</P>
<P>     The main Bond woman in this film is Isabella Scorupco, and as far
as I know, this is her first film.  She plays a Russian computer
techie, second banana in her posting to a wonderfully nerdy Russian
Hacker named Boris (Alan Cumming).  There's some posturing about near
the end of the film that looks like the script was trying to establish
and actual relationship between Natalya and Bond, but the scene is
awkward and best ignored.</P>
<P>     Sean Bean, playing 006, almost walks away with the film, as I
said. He's a rotten bastard who is really just a reflection of Bond's
potentially very dark side.  It's fun to watch Bean and Brosnan up on
the screen, because you can easily believe that the characters were
friends.</P>
<P>     All in all, a worthy addition to the Bond pantheon.  No, it's not
one of the best Bond films, but it is one of the better ones.</P>
