<PRE>                                  THE COWBOY WAY
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by     Gregg Champion 
Written by      Bill Wittliff
Cast            Woody Harrelson
                Kiefer Sutherland
MPAA Rating     "PG-13" (but a *strong* PG-13..)
Running Time    Approx. 100 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>==</PRE>
<PRE>"I'm a bid-ness man."
          - Harrelson to Sutherland</PRE>
<PRE>     Woody Harrelson *is* THE COWBOY WAY.</PRE>
<P>     The former bartender of TV's "Cheers" is the *sole* reason to
watch this clunky action/comedy about a pair of rodeo-riders roaming
the Big Apple to find their missing friend. When they discover that
said friend is dead, they take their own approach to solving the
crime.</P>
<P>     COOGAN'S BLUFF it ain't, but this clunky caper comedy has about
forty-minutes of wit worth watching. The best bits have Harrelson
stealing scenes with lines like "I wouldn't throw a bucket of water on
your ass if it were drowning." The price of admission also buys the
viewer a chance to see (a) Woody with a crew cut and (b) Woody wearing
nothing but his hat.</P>
<PRE>     How's that for a decent proposal?</PRE>
<P>     The rest of the rest is a lame-brain sweat-shop subplot that stops
making sense after about an hour. The finale is an absurd horse/subway
chase that's calmed by the sight of Harrelson and Sutherland riding
horseback through The City. Remember when they still made movies
there?</P>
<P>     Oddly, THE COWBOY WAY has much more cruelty than the rating (of
PG-13) suggests. The demise of the villain, in particular, is quite
disturbing and parents should be wary.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
