<P>        As time moves forward and more movies are filmed, certain
formulas become readily apparent and they are exploited. Also as
sequels are created franchise series' are found and exploited. This
being yet another movie in the enormous Bond series it is hard to tell
what we should expect from it. Since it is obvious the series is being
exploited, it's particularly obvious after the you find out that this
is the eighteenth official Bond movie. From the beginning Bond has
been somewhat formulaic, I cannot readily recall a movie in which Bond
DIDN'T save the world from peril or from some grand external force.
Since both the basic formula for a Bond movie seems to still be
popular and still be something that is in demand, then so be it. Let
there be Bond movies. Simply because the character of Bond is popular
doesn't mean that the story has to be terribly predictable. It is
obvious that Bond is going to win the moment the ticket is purchased,
that doesn't necessarily mean that you can predict everything that
happens in this movie. 
        For example: Enter,  Wai Lin something of a copy of Bond but
with a Chinese tone. This is a fairly original idea having a woman
that is just as capable as good old Mr. Bond, well at least it's
somewhat original for the series. This idea is not played out all that
well for more than once she seems to be this Damsel in distress with
our hero soon coming to the rescue. Wai Lin, played by Michelle Yeoh
is a character that should add flare and life to a Bond movie. But is
only there it seems to assist the hero of the hour, something of a
sidekick rather than the equal she is made out to be. Michelle Yeoh,
seems to be good for the role that the character is best suited for,
not the one that comes through, rather unfortunately. 
        As Bond, Pierce Brosnan fits the traditional formula almost to
the letter. He is everything he is supposed to be, he's even emotional
about his relationships or at least he tries to be. Yes, Bond actually
cares about some of the women he sleeps with. Just makes you teary
eyed thinking about it. Strangely enough that idea was tried with
rather limited success.  Pulled out of a love scene with a blonde
beauty, to go onto this mission, Bond encounters a former flame. Yeah,
so? He's not supposed to go mushy on us, that's not the Bond that is
expected, that's also not the Bond that works. It's also not something
that works very well in the movie. One liner's abound when this
subplot is visited, a rather forced way to bring us another love
scene. 
        Now no formula is complete without a bad guy unfortunately
there isn't much of one in this movie. The idea behind the bad guy is
great it's actually plausible. But the character is not developed
enough and assuming certain things is required. The bad guy is
sinister enough for the part, but you don't see enough of the evil,
not enough of the planning behind the mayhem. Just because the 'Bond
Formula' requires an evil character does not mean that he's being evil
just for the sake of being evil. There just doesn't seem to be much
motivation behind what he does and comes off somewhat aloof from the
story. 
        Now, no Bond movie is complete without its gadgets, its
violence and its action. Well, this movie has those in fair quantity.
Fair enough not to be over indulging and fair enough to keep the pace
going at a fairly high speed to keep our interest. One thing that
strikes as being rather pointless is opening sequence, too elaborate
and too destructive. The whole build up sequence could have been
created much more subtly for much greater effect. Especially since the
opening sequence turns out to be one of the more destructive and more
action packed ones in the movie. Other than that, the Bond formula
holds more than true for most of the film in this respect. The action
is where it is supposed to be and in proper quantity.
        But then when viewing a Bond movie, what is it that you go to
see it's the action, the character and the story. The story is there,
although riddled with holes.  The character is there and in fairly
good standing with only a minor blip. Finally, the action is there
although a bit excessive in the beginning. All in all, this movie is
exactly what it is expected to be. It is a Bond movie, maybe not the
best Bond movie but not the worst one either.  It had the potential to
be one of the better action films of the year, but it fell short by
its shortcomings. In the end, it's a decent action movie supporting an
old franchise with due respect. </P>
