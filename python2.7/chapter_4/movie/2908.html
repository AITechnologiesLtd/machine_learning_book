<PRE>                             TERMINAL VELOCITY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     David Twohy, who co-wrote THE FUGITIVE, had a "new" idea for a
screenplay.  "What if a woman arranged a sky-diving incident in order
to fake her own death?"  Sounds interesting.   All it needed was a
little better story and better execution, neither of which the film
got.</P>
<P>     Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski) comes into the office of
sky-diving instructor, Richard "Ditch" Brodie (Charlie Sheen), saying
she wants to learn how to sky-dive.  And she is in a hurry.  Wants her
first lesson immediately as well as her first jump.  She tells him she
is not athletic but she is determined.  "If I don't do it right now I
may change my mind and never do it."  Ditch says "Okay."</P>
<P>     They get into a plane and take off.  While up in the air, Morrow
diverts Ditch's attention for a moment by saying she sees another plane
nearby.  He goes up front to ask the pilot if he has seen anything; he
has not.  Ditch returns to the back of the plane and finds it empty.
Looking out the open doorway he sees her hurtling to her death below
with the parachute not having opened.  The FAA blames him for
carelessness, for perhaps not having secured the parachute properly,
etc.</P>
<P>     As this is the star, who is supposed to have been killed early in
the film, it should be obvious that whoever hit the ground, it is not
Morrow.  That leaves only one person whom it may have been and the
audience should easily guess who.  Ditch smells a rat and tries to find
out what really happened.</P>
<P>     The movie has several important goofs and suspensions of disbelief
so that it becomes nothing more than hundreds of so-called
"thrillers."  Exciting parachute jumps happen frequently in the film
and there is even a high aerial act (unbelievable) where Ditch
transfers from the wings of a bi-plane onto another plane and crawls in
through the open back.  Sure.  An attempt to mix banter and thriller
does not help the movie.</P>
<P>     Deran Serafian (DEATH WARRANT and BACK IN THE USSR) is the
director.  In addition to Sheen and Kinski, the cast includes James
Goldofini (whom you may recall was Geena Davis' jilted boyfriend in
ANGIE) and Christopher McDonald who was in QUIZ SHOW and GRUMPY OLD
MEN.</P>
