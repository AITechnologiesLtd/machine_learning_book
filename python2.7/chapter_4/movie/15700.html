<P>     Ian McKellen -- who has already won two year-end critics' awards as
of this writing -- has a sinfully great time in GODS AND MONSTERS.  He
stars as James Whale, the director of 1930s horror classics like
FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN.  When we meet him in the film,
however, it is the late 1950s, a tough time to be an openly gay man even
in Hollywood.  Twenty years removed from his film-making peak and
suffering the after-effects of a stroke, Whale has been left to putter 
in his Los Angeles home, accompanied by his memories and housekeeper
Hannah (Lynn Redgrave).  That doesn't mean he won't try to seduce the
occasional film student who comes to interview him, or even new gardener
Clay Boone (Brendan Fraser).  Growling innuendo and wrapping his lips
around a cigar that's not just a cigar, McKellen fashions Whale early on
as a dirty old man with little left to embrace but his own lasciviousness.</P>
<P>     There's no question that McKellen's work is a great time...great
acting, not necessarily.  It is McKellen's misfortune that GODS AND
MONSTERS is the second film of 1998 in which an older gay man tries to woo
a young heterosexual.  The first was called LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND,
and starred John Hurt as the older man.  In every other way the characters
are completely dissimilar -- Hurt played a timid professor who had lived
his entire life as a straight husband, while McKellen takes on a
flamboyant artist utterly at ease with his lifestyle.  Hurt's was the more
difficult role, one in which a small man confronted upheaval and potential
humiliation; McKellen got a part full of punch lines and haunted 
recollections, the stuff actors turn into audition monologues.  James 
Whale isn't a role that requires a great performance.  It's a role that
requires an _entertaining_ performance.</P>
<P>     And entertaining it is, particularly in service of Whale's intriguing
biography.  That biography comes both in spoken recollections and
scattered flashbacks, revealing Whale's rise from impoverished youth to
soldier to stage designer to film director.  Writer/director Bill Condon
makes it evident that Whale's affinity for creating screen monsters was
born of sympathy, one outcast giving voice and soul to other outcasts.  He
even makes the sly suggestion that Whale was also the father of camp,
creating intentionally humorous films from horror stories as a sop to his
own amused sensibilities.  McKellen makes Whale far too inventive to be
pathetic, yet also shows him fighting with the shadow of his former self. 
As Whale's mind deteriorates, he becomes an ever-sadder figure, a living
relic who has begun thinking of himself in the same past tense others
think of him.</P>
<P>     But there's another character gobbling up chunks of screen time, and
that's Brendan Fraser as the wrong-side-of-the-tracks gardener.  Clay is
set up as a kindred spirit to Whale, another outcast from a disapproving
family who turns to sex when he needs to define himself.  It's a solid
enough performance by Fraser, but there's something trite about the entire
structure of Clay's friendship with Whale, nearly as trite as Lynn
Redgrave's fussy German housekeeper.  It reaches the point where the story 
actually appears to be about Clay, which is a big mistake.  McKellen's
performance may not be perfect, but it's still the best thing about GODS
AND MONSTERS.  It's not incredibly touching, and it's not incredibly
profound.  It is, however, quite a lot of fun for a while.  There are
worse places to cast your lot than with the year's second best performance
as an older gay man trying to woo a young heterosexual.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 killer Whales:  6.</PRE>
