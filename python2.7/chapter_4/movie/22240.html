<P>starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler, Toby Stephens, Lena Headey
screenplay by Peter Ettedgui and Michael Ignatieff,
based on the poem "Yevgeny Onegin" by Alexander Pushkin
directed by Martha Fiennes</P>
<P>"When will the devil take me?" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice
over. The spoiled title character of _Onegin_ (pronounced Oh-negg-in) is
waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour.
Martha Fiennes' debut feature is (quite literally) filmed poetry (it's
based on an epic Russian poem by Alexander Pushkin), a profound study of
regret, of how we confuse shame with guilt.</P>
<P>When we first meet Eugene Onegin (Ralph, acting for his sister; another
brother, Magnus, composed the score), a philandering aristocrat from St.
Petersburg, he has just inherited his uncle's estate. With plans to sell
it, Onegin pays a summer visit to the manor, which is located in an
underpopulated Russian countryside, and not long into the trip he meets
a neighbouring family of blue bloods. Smitten with Olga Larina (Headey),
he befriends Olga's fiancé, Vladimir Lensky (Stephens), while Olga's
sister, Tatyana (Tyler), romanticizing his flippant attitude (he's a
nineteenth bad boy), falls for Onegin.</P>
<P>In one sweaty, inky torrent of passion, Tatyana writes him a love
letter. He is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections,
it is implied, because he can. Soon after, tragedy strikes, and Onegin
makes himself scarce. When we catch up with him, six years later, he has
just returned to St. Petersburg, where at a grand ball he discovers that
an old friend (Donovan) has married a more womanly and wordly Tatyana.
This time, Onegin finds her irresistable.</P>
<P>What is most amazing about Ralph Fiennes' performance is his subtle
physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch. Overwhelmed
by a top hat, the Onegin who pines for Tatyana seems smaller in stature
than the one who brushed her off, an Ebeneezer Scrooge trapped in
Christmas past.</P>
<P>The actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's
room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like
"Onegin". Petula Clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "Parking Lot":
"You don't know what you've got ‘til it's gone." Onegin's about-face on
Tatyana speaks for those of us (read: most of us) who need confirmation
that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well.
What the character feels is not jealousy but remorse, embarrassment,
even, at having let her go. Out of identification we feel empathy for
Onegin, a callous bastard.</P>
<P>Tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties, but that makes them no less
vital. She changes, too, from a girl in crush to a woman with divided
loyalties. Tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her UK
co-stars, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a
series of wanton stares. They both have faces, Mr. Fiennes and Ms.
Tyler, capable of conveying archetypal Russian misery.</P>
<P>_Onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode
of "Masterpiece Theater", even with its current cast of thoroughbreds
intact, were Martha Fiennes not at the helm. An MTV background (she cut
her teeth directing rock videos for XTC and others) has positively
influenced her sense of pace (though, thankfully, not her shot
lengths-no spasmodic cutting here); at just over 100 minutes, _Onegin_
clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair.</P>
<P>The film has an atypical period look, as well. Absent are the sumptuous
tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character
in those drippy Merchant Ivory productions. The sets are almost
expressionistically bare, echoing the loneliness of the protagonists.
(Cinematographer Remi Adafarasin often allows space to engulf them; I'm
reminded the climax, which unfolds in a sea of white.)</P>
<P>Martha Fiennes has a clear command of cinema, and her spare, often
painfully human visual presentation of "Yevgeny Onegin" is arguably the
most lucid translation of Pushkin's difficult text yet. Ms. Fiennes may
be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since Jane Campion.</P>
