<PRE>UNDER THE SUN
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Nominated last year for Best Foreign Language Film, Under the Sun is a
gentle look at romance through the eyes of a middle-aged innocent.  It's
a pleasantly simple story, shot with overwhelming beauty, but it falls
short in terms of sweeping an audience off its feet.</P>
<P>The setting is the lush fields of Sweden in the late 1950's.  Olof (Rolf
Lassgård) is a lonely farmer who can barely hang on to the house his
mother left to him when she died nine years before.  His young,
boisterous friend Erik (Johan Widerberg) helps him with errands and some
work when he isn't digging graves.</P>
<P>Olof is simple and quiet, and ashamed that he can't read or write.  He
is also still a virgin.  He goes to the local paper to place an ad for a
housekeeper, hoping she will also become a female companion.  Word gets
out around the small town and their priest puts Erik on guard.</P>
<P>Ellen (Helena Bergström) arrives with little warning.  Olof is instantly
attracted to her and fumbles with conversation as Erik gets aggressively
flirtatious, apparently in the protection of Olof.  As time goes on,
Ellen has set the house in repair and managed the finances without
knowing that Olof can't read.  She and Olof become romantically involved
as she continues to duck Erik's advances.  Erik won't rest until he
finds a chink in her armor.</P>
<P>This character driven story is respectably able to keep the key players'
motivations in question. You never know if Ellen is being coy with Erik
or if she is really devoted to Olof, because her past is always in
question.  Erik seems to care a great deal about Olof but then makes
successive comments trying to degrade him in Ellen's eyes.  Olof himself
appears a simpleton led by around by others but is allowed to show more
intelligence as time progresses.  This mixture keeps the mind reeling
with anticipation as to what will happen next.</P>
<P>However, there are also flaws to the ambiguity.  When Olof is finally
able to show that he knows more about human nature than he lets on, it
is only after he has had intercourse.  The film seems to relate sexual
intercourse with all newfound knowledge of the world surrounding Olof,
which is hard to swallow.</P>
<P>Also, lacking knowledge of the characters' motivations from one scene to
the next may keep you on mental toes, but it keeps you begging for the
filmmaker to get on with allowing something to happen, already.  There
are at least eight scenes in which Erik tries to gain Ellen's physical
affections and only one in which she stops him to challenge his honesty
to Olof.  The scenes themselves are intriguing enough to watch, but
there are too many of them to keep one's attention from waning.</P>
<P>There is a fairy tale quality to the film that keeps the situation
endearing enough to watch.  Olof is a large man, and not particularly
attractive, while Ellen is slim and perfectly coiffed.  A link to Beauty
and the Beast can easily by made.  Between that, Erik's talk of what
little Olof has to offer, and the stunning landscapes in which
everything is shot, the viewer is transported into the environment where
the characters live instead of merely being a spectator.</P>
<P>Unfortunately this film falls into a difficult category to appreciate. 
It isn't necessarily a good film for couples, and yet a modern single
won't find much to like either.  A bit too much like life for our
tastes.</P>
