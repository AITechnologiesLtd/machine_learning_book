<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>By the mid-Nineties, the slasher movie was all but dead, the heyday of 
the "Friday the Thirteenth" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" franchises just 
a distant memory. Then, in 1996, came "Scream". Perhaps not since "Star 
Wars" has a single film so revolutionized a genre. "Scream" was not just 
funny and scary and inventive, did not just boast an eager young cast. It 
exuded a hip self-awareness which both poked fun at and paid homage to 
its bloody legacy.</P>
<P>"Scream" was followed by a slew of imitators, including a sequel of its 
own. But in addition to some questionable casting choices, "Scream 2" 
(1997) failed by falling into some of the very pitfalls it laughed at, 
hewing too closely to the original.</P>
<P>Now comes "Scream 3", the (allegedly) last of the trilogy. This time 
around, series creator Kevin Williamson decided to draft only a story 
outline, handing script duties over to Ehren Kruger. Fortunately, my 
qualms about how this would affect the film's quality proved unfounded. 
While this final "Scream" doesn't match the original for ingenuity and 
suspense, it is better than "Scream 2", and is a good film in its own right.</P>
<P>In the fictional reality of the "Scream" series, the events of the first 
two films -- the serial killings perpetrated by madmen masquerading as 
"Ghostface" -- have been depicted in a pair of horror movies titled "Stab". 
Despite the lack of further Ghostface murders to latch onto, production 
is under way on the third "Stab" installment. Amongst the cast is 
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), portraying reporter Gale Weathers. Not so 
ironically, Jennifer's boyfriend and bodyguard is Dewey Riley (David 
Arquette), the "real" Gale Weathers' former lover and a survivor of the 
previous murder sprees.</P>
<P>Start-up on "Stab 3", however, has the (unintended?) side effect of 
inciting a new series of Ghostface slayings, and this time the victims 
are "Stab" castmembers. The film is shut down -- to the dismay of hot 
young director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) -- but the body count 
continues to rise. At a loss, police detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick 
Dempsey) asks the real Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) to come to 
Hollywood to assist him. But it soon becomes clear that Ghostface's real 
target is once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), living in isolation 
somewhere in California. At the same time, Sidney begins having 
disturbing dreams about her mother Maureen (Linda McCree), the very first 
Ghostface victim.</P>
<P>"Scream 3" shares many similarities with its predecessors, from the 
opening "shock murder" to the utter impossibility of actually guessing  
who Ghostface is this time around. As such, it would be easy to write it 
off as just another clone of the original, and nothing more. But unlike 
"Scream 2", "Scream 3" does things a little differently. In particular, 
Williamson and Kruger take advantage of the Hollywood setting to comment 
not just on the nature of "trilogies" (perhaps realizing that there 
simply isn't much to say: movie trilogies are rare, and horror trilogies 
rarer still) but on thriller filmmaking in general.</P>
<P>The movie is also peppered with cameos which are as hilarious as they are 
unexpected. There are a number of clever in-jokes for the observant: the 
"Stab" actors, for example, are named after the current crop of young  
stars, like Freddie Prinze and Angelina Jolie. And some of the unpopular 
decisions of the previous movies are addressed, as with "Stab" actor 
Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond), whose character Ricky is an intentionally 
transparent replacement for Randy (Jamie Kennedy), killed off in the 
second "Scream"/"Stab" installment.</P>
<P>Returning stars Campbell, Arquette and Cox slip back into their roles 
comfortably. Unlike the first two movies, though, it is the latter pair 
who take the spotlight for much of "Scream 3". They do so ably, hamstrung 
only by a break-up at the start of the film which is never properly 
motivated and comes across as a very obvious plot device. Like any movie 
dominated by young actors, the rest of the cast is uneven. Posey does a 
great job aping Gale Weathers (and hence Cox) and Jenny McCarthy, as 
Sarah Darling, seems to have fun sending up her own public image. But 
Scott Foley is wooden as Roman, seemingly able to sustain only a single 
emotion per scene, and Emily Mortimer, who plays acting ingenue Angelina
Tyler, never really finds her groove.</P>
<P>As usual, "Scream 3" builds up the suspense deftly, weaving the mystery 
of Maureen Prescott's past with the usual Ghostface murders. The deaths 
are, for the most part, satisfactorily inventive (one sequence involving 
a fax machine is particularly fun) and the identities of some victims are 
sure to come as a surprise. It is unfortunate, though, that the movie 
doesn't abide by its own criticism of the genre and repeatedly dumbs 
down its characters to ensure they are in a position to be attacked. This 
is particularly galling when "Scream" veterans like Dewey and Gale start 
splitting up needlessly.</P>
<P>But these things are, in some ways, to be expected; while it would be 
nice to see a horror film rise above such cliches, it is hard to fault 
"Scream 3" for staying true to its roots. More disappointing is the 
movie's "surprise ending", which is not much of a surprise at all to 
anyone with a working knowledge of common literary twists. Indeed, after 
guessing the direction in which "Scream 3" was heading, I found myself 
hoping that I would be completely blindsided, as with the ingenious 
revelation of the second murderer in "Scream".</P>
<P>Alas, it was not to be: the movie ends in a manner which is neither 
without merit nor entirely satisfactory. Walking out of the theatre, I 
found myself pleased with the decision to make this the last "Scream". 
The trilogy has been good (sometimes even great), but I think it has 
played itself out. It's time for the Ghostface costume to go on the shelf 
next to Jason's hockey mask and Freddie's clawed glove, and the screaming 
to end once and for all.</P>
