<PRE>                              THE RIVER WILD
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     THE RIVER WILD has Meryl Streep as a rower and former river guide
with a family.  She meets up with trouble on a white water rafting trip
with her family, and deals with it.</P>
<P>     It is clear that Meryl Streep chose this film because of the
opportunity to portray a strong female in a commercial context, and her
acting adds immeasurably to the quality of the product.  Watching her,
I felt I learned something about women generally; I have never felt
this way before. Streep takes this fairly obvious, somewhat creaky
vehicle with echoes of THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY, DELIVERANCE, etc.  and
turns it into a commentary on the strength of a woman. As my wife said
on leaving the theater: "I feel incredibly empowered--but also totally
inadequate."</P>
<P>     She is supported in this by a fine cast, particularly the big
names--David Strathairn as her relatively weak husband, and Kevin Bacon
as the macho stranger.  Both of them deliver good performances, but
they are out-acted by Streep, as she has consistently out-acted every
leading man in her distinguished career.  Here her strength as an
actress works better than it ever has before, since she now has her
experience to draw on and an appropriately strong character to
portray.</P>
<P>     Here's to Meryl Streep, whose career is finally back on track!
Here's to the director, who was intelligent enough to allow her to
carry the weight of the movie, and to allow the tension and suspense
come from her brilliant style!</P>
<P>     The script is weak--in lesser hands, this would be strictly
made-for-TV fare--and the effects do not work very well; I honestly
never felt that they were that much in danger on the river, despite
numerous scenes that must have been hard to film, showing them
apparently bouncing around in some pretty tough water.</P>
<P>     But this hardly matters in the face of such a richly moving
portrayal. It is almost enough to make one wish that Streep were a man,
so that she would get the recognition she deserves, as the finest
cinematic actor that ever lived, and the corresponding emolument,
rather than merely as the finest actress, and the pay of an upper-end
actress with a young body. But it is better for us, if not for her, as
it is; we will continue to learn from this great woman as she continues
to turn her experience into art.</P>
