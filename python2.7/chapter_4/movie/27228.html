<PRE>AN EVERLASTING PIECE
--------------------</PRE>
<P>Colm O'Neill's (screenwriter Barry McEvoy) house sits at the crosshairs 
of the Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods of Belfast, hooded by a 
homemade firebomb protection.  When Colm begins a new job as a barber at 
Ballylackey Mental Hospital, he finds a fast friend in Protestant poetry
lover George (Brian F. O'Byrne, HBO's "Oz").  They're tipped off to a 
wide open market opportunity, when the owner (Billy Connelly, "Mrs. Brown")
of the only men's hair piece company in Northern Ireland lands in their 
institution for scalping clients in director Barry Levinson's ("Diner") 
"An Everlasting Piece."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>While "An Everlasting Piece" doesn't strain at the yoke to offer up
twee Irish charm like this year's  "Saving Grace," it's tale of rugs set
against 'the troubles' that wears a bit thin overall.</P>
<P>Colm and George manage to convince 'the scalper' to hand over his list of
clients to begin their new side endeavor.  They immediately run into problems
with their first client, Mr. Black (Des McAleer), who confuses their doorway
sales pitch for a hair piece as a speachifying on herpes (the Irish poking
fun at their own accents?).  They sell him their sample after the initial
confusion, but in their eagerness to make the sale, they take a check, which
inevitably bounces.  McEvoy strains his screenplay with a character that
refuses to pay in order to get Colm to take the piece back by force, only
to be chased by a group of Black's lads, then run down by a pack of dogs
(did Black pack a steak under that piece or what?).  Colm's been abandoned
by George, who took off in their car after being accosted by an apparently
released Scalper (a never more wasted Billy Connelly).</P>
<P>This is a film about the Irish conflict, so of course, the two get stopped
on a lonely road by the IRA, one of whom buys that same dog-chewed hair
piece.  When the duo ends up being questioned by the police, Colm refuses
to turn the IRA in.  Conflict ensues between the two budding businessmen,
who are also being challenged by the Toupee or Not Toupee company in a sales
showdown.</P>
<P>"An Everlasting Piece" is a pleasant enough little comedy, but there were
so many wrong moves which could have been avoided.  Did McEvoy really believe
that his audience would be amused to see Colm's mother appear with different
styles of underwear on her head, ostensibly her 'eccentric' way of protecting
her hairdo from her own cigarette smoke?  Is he such a fan of The Talking
Heads that he had to cut to inexplicable, gratuitous scenes of Colm and 
girlfriend Bronaugh (Anna Friel, "A Midsummer Night's Dream") in a movie 
theatre playing "Stop Making Sense?"  Why is Colm's 'gesture' to save the
business late in the film any less distasteful than what George has 
objected to in Colm's behavior?</P>
<P>Director Barry Levinson has a diverse roster of films behind him, but I
must admit confusion as to what drew him to this small offbeat tale.  While
setting the Irish conflict against the rug trade is an inspired idea (based
on the screenwriter's father's experiences), the telling dawdles and never
quites finds its course.</P>
