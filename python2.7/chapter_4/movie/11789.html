<PRE><HR>                             THE FUGITIVE
                    A film review by Ram Samudrala<HR></PRE>
<P>One of my favourite kinds of movies are the ones in which the hero is
wrongly accused and has to fight a powerful adversary to clear his/her
name. What makes these movies work is the way in which innocence is
established, given the seemingly overwhelming odds. In other words,
the hero must win in the end, but it can't be too easily done, for
that would undermine the credibility of the plot.  /U.S. Marshals/
definitely pulls off this plot device convincingly, just as its
predecessor, /The Fugitive/, did.</P>
<P>In both movies, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), is a Deputy
U. S. Marshal who is on the trail of an escaped suspect.  This time,
it is Mark Roberts/Sheridan (Wesley Snipes), who is falsely accused of
murdering two agents of the State Department in cold blood.  Sheridan
is a former Special Forces Marine, ex-CIA operative who knows all the
tricks of Gerard's trade, and that makes him more credible than the
character of Richard Kimble (played by Harrison Ford) in /The
Fugitive/.  Gerard is assisted in his hunt for Sheridan by his team of
Marshals as well as John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.), a Stage Department
agent whose friends were the ones "murdered in cold blood" by
Sheridan. From the beginning we know that Royce is up to no good,
especially given the simmering hostility between himself and Gerard.</P>
<P>At first Gerard is led to believe that Sheridan is just another
run-of-the-mill murderer.  But he soon learns that Sheridan was a
"kite", an agent of the U.S. Government in a position to perform jobs
(read: dirty work) where the government can disavow responsibility if
things go wrong.  Gerard also learns that Sheridan killed the two
State Department agents in self-defense.  As the story progresses,
more things don't add up. When Gerard sees one of his agents die,
allegedly shot by Sheridan, he becomes irrational and, forgetting his
brewing doubts, goes after Sheridan with a vengeance.</P>
<P>As I said above, in such movies, clearing one's name shouldn't come
easily, and in this case it definitely doesn't. Sheridan never really
manages to succeed in his attempt (people who can tell the truth are
killed off one by one--which in itself makes for quite a bit of
suspense).  Gerard does finally put two and two together and baits the
real criminal into revealing himself, thereby exonerating Sheridan.</P>
<P>The performances by the three main characters, Jones, Snipes, and
Downey are excellent in terms of action-movie fare even though there
is little character development.  The script is witty at times and the
action sequences are quite spectacular. The movie is being promoted as
a sequel to /The Fugitive/, but it is not a sequel as much as a rehash
of the original (read: clone).  Still, /U.S. Marshals/ is worth
watching on the big screen and I highly recommend it.</P>
