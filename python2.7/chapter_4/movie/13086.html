<PRE>[film] "Deep Impact"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>Or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bolide". An enraged 
comet attempts to land on Tea Leoni. America gets all mussed up. 
Apparently the rest of the world is a little put out too.</P>
<P>Two years ago, it was extreme weather.  Last year, it was severe 
geology.  This year, it's cosmic impact films.  In light of such 
obvious trend-following, a few fears are justified.  Are these going 
to be good films or just market-stuffers?  Now, little Steven 
Spielberg would never give us something like "Independence Day" or 
"Starship Troopers", would he?</P>
<P>No, but he might give us "The Colour Purple".</P>
<P>This is how it goes: young Leo Biederman discovers a new comet that is 
intent on squishing the United States (and incidentally destroying the 
rest of the world too).  Somehow, the entire astronomical community of 
the world is gagged until ace reporter Tea Leoni (showing a startling 
ability to play the same character she does on TV) comes snooping 
around.  The Prez (Morgan Freeman) crumbles and makes a nation-wide 
announcement: "We're all going to die."  The nation, as represented by 
a whole lot of B-grade TV actors competitive underplaying the "oh 
shucks, we're just folks" shtick, show concern by wrinkling their 
foreheads.</P>
<P>But it's all OK, the government is going to take care of everything.  
Strangely enough, this isn't interpreted as a reason for widespread 
panic.  No, how else do you defeat a rogue comet but by sending up a 
crack crew of astronauts, including one called "Spurgeon Tanner" 
(played by a curiously mummified Robert Duvall).  Hell, if I was a 
comet, that would throw me off-course.</P>
<P>And so it goes.  We can tell there is civil unrest, because the houses 
of a lot of white, middle-class people get messed up.  Tea realises 
that only people who are reconciled with their family are allowed to 
die and leave the film.  So she goes and mooches around with her 
father (Maximilian Schell, looking like he's been attacked with a 
bicycle pump) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave).  Later, if you look 
away for a second, Redgrave just seems to dematerialise in the middle 
of the film.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the astronauts have stopped giggling at Spurgeon's name and 
realised that at least he has a character with more than one dimension.  
Angered by this, one astronaut (aggressive guy) says that Spurgeon is 
too old and should be making nostalgic movies with Laura Dern.  
Russian guy, black guy and female guy nod wisely.  Other guy realises 
that he has so little screen time, he must be scheduled to die later.  
And indeed, after they blast-off, move s-l-o-w-l-y through their ship 
to show you it's in zero gravity, they land on the comet and other guy 
dies.  (He dies after calculating that on an 11-km rock, gravity isn't 
just low, as the scriptwriters apparently believe - it's nonexistent.)
Aggressive guy and black guy get injured. Cowed by this, Russian guy 
and female guy let Spurgeon take over the mission.</P>
<P>Back on the ground, the government is selecting a million random 
people to stick in a set of caves in Missouri for the duration of the 
comet-induced nuclear winter.  Finally people can see the government 
is out of control.  (Missouri?  Are you kidding me?)  About 30 mildly 
aggressive demonstrators gather outside the caves to protest.  (I 
assume they're demonstrating - or maybe they've just had too much 
coffee.)  But now there are TWO comets, and while we might survive the 
first - which makes a high-pitched buzz as it moves through space - 
the deep rumble of the other tells us we're in trouble.  The Prez 
orders all the nuclear missiles to be fired offscreen at the comet.  
Later he tells us they failed.  (Just between you and me, I don't 
there ever were any missiles.  The Prez has probably been making out 
like a bandit on those Strategic Defence appropriations for years, 
occasionally staging a few accidents in Omaha silos to keep Congress 
from looking too closely.)  Subsequently a lot of people hug and make 
up just before they are killed, although not in any sort of up-close 
and icky way.</P>
<P>It would be churlish to deny there are some genuinely stirring moments 
in "Deep Impact".  In particular, those scenes involving Vanessa 
Redgrave and her character's realisation of, and resignation to, her 
own death are fairly powerful.  There is also some nice model work in 
the SFX and it is refreshing to see a film that doesn't glorify in its 
own bodycount.  However these are severely weakened by heavy-handed 
storytelling (alternately underlining or shortcutting the plot), an 
oppressively omnipresent soundtrack (forever whispering in your ear 
"this is a stirring emotional moment"), and indifferent acting.  It's 
not a bad picture, but it's an irritatingly simplistic one, almost 
claustrophobic in its narrow worldview.  [**/ok] and "The Comet 
Purple" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
