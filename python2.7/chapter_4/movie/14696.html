<P>    Bill Clinton should declare himself to be a virgin.  His
current problems would be over.  The American people would
unify behind him and Ken Starr would be defending clients
with parking violations while his witch hunters would go back
to shuffling papers.  This is the implicit counsel given by
director Shekhar Kapur in his new film "Elizabeth."  It's not
that Shekhar's subject, the long-reigning, British monarch
knew the American president, either personally or via the
news broadcasts.  After all she was crowned in 1558 when
Native Americans ruled over what became the United States,
more concerned with conspiracies fomented by other tribes
than by the libidinous cravings of their chiefs.  But Elizabeth I,
beset by conspiracies from nobles of her own country, the
machinations of a gaggle of followers of Mary of Guise, and
covetous looks at the sceptered isle from France and Spain
eager to take advantage of England's weakness, knew how
to solve these difficulties.  She cut her long and lovely
vermilion locks, donned a short rug, and had her make-up
crew paint her face a deep and eerie white.  She then re-
ascended her throne amid an open-mouthed, transfixed court
which appeared to believe her to be the reincarnation of the
Virgin Mary.  "How many people have worshipped and died
for this woman," Elizabeth remarked while gazing at a statue
of the Holy Mother before taking this brazen step.  The
English people united behind her.</P>
<P>   "Elizabeth" is the creation of Bombay-based director
Shekhar Kapur whose films had been seen only by people of
his native India, with the exception of "Bandit Queen'--a
messy, melodramatic adventure study of the notorious Robin-
Hood-like outlaw Phoolan Devi who emerged from poverty to
become a kidnapper, robber and killer.  Kapur, reportedly
bent on breaking the canons of historical compositions, has in
fact put together a colorful but cold, distant, detached and
fragmented film which emphasizes a queen's quandary with
coup-bent conspirators in much the way that the superior
"Mrs. Brown" underscores another sovereign's controversial
camaraderie with a commoner.  </P>
<P>   The story opens some years after the death of King Henry
VIII, the fellow whose split with Anne Boleyn was the goriest
that history had known, and remained so until this day when
even Ed French (David Schwimmer) acknowledges in the
movie "Apt Pupil" that he is "in the middle of the messiest
divorce since Henry VIII."  The termagant Bloody Mary (Kathy
Burke) is on the throne, so-called because she tends to order
the burning of subjects who are not ardent Catholics like her. 
In the only scene that indicates that there are indeed people
in England who are not of the nobility, three such heretics are
kindled: when one apostate gripes that the dying is moving
ahead too slowly, a helpful citizen throws another bale of hay
into the flames.</P>
<P>   After Mary dies of cancer, unable to convince her half-
sister Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) to pledge to Catholicism and
yet unwilling to order her execution for treason, the film vaults
hither and fro from conventional court-sponsored cotillions to
scenes of political machinations and assassinations.  The
balls feature strange dances involving clapping hands,
bouncing feet, and women lifted into the air in a truncated
interpretation of 1950's rock-and-roll frolics.  The intrigues are
of both romantic and combative skullduggery.  In the former
sense, handsome Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester
(Joseph Fiennes) proves that the term The Virgin Queen,
when applied to Elizabeth is as accurate as Bill Clinton's
claim that he never had sex with Monica Lewinsky.  Elizabeth
is pursued as well by the asinine Duc d'Anjou (Vincent
Cassel), whose idea of courtship upon meeting the queen is
to whisper pornographic suggestions into her ear as a more
fun thing to do than kissing her hand and who believes he is
impressing Her Majesty by wearing a dress.  The intrigues
are handled by Elizabeth's lifelong, trusted confidant, the 007
of the era, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). 
Walsingham thinks nothing of bedding his employer's leading
female opponent, Mary of Guise, and making war, not love,
when the lights are down low.</P>
<P>   The fate of her country changed dramatically when
Elizabeth shed her girl-next-door image to become a
thundering feminist.  Like America's current chief executive,
she abhors the view of her advisers that the leader's body
and person are no longer her own property--that they belong
to the state.  Nor does she pay heed to her counselors to
marry.  Michael Hirst's screenplay focuses on the early years
of Elizabeth's rule and underscoring the conspiracies
bedeviling the court with all of that subject's contemporary
resonance.  But Shekhar Kapur misses the opportunity to
provide a more intimate, fleshed out production with which his
audience could connect.  Cate Blanchett has a singular
appearance which is exploited well, particularly in the stagy
finale when she emerges as quite the likeness of Elizabeth I.  
The Australian actress, who turned in an appealing
performance as the edgier, craftier, more passionate misfit in
Gillian Armstrong's "Oscar and Lucinda," comes across as
oddly bland this time around, resembling only slightly the
more regal posture of Judi Dench in last year's more
absorbing story, "Mrs. Brown."  Geoffrey Rush, positively
amazing as the over-the-edge pianist David Helfgott in Scott
Hicks's "Shine," is wasted here, going through the motions of
protecting the queen with a dour face and no sign of the
fervor that drives him to live out his chosen career as he
does.  Perhaps most unfortunate of all, "Elizabeth" appears
claustrophobic, giving few signs that a civilization exists
beyond the palace walls.  Contrary to Mr. Kapur's ardent
mission, the film comes across as a didactic history lesson.</P>
