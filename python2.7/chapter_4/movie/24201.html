<P>I had lost all faith in PG-13 movies that are intended
for teenagers and adults. The last dozen or so that I
have seen have all felt incomplete, as if the most
crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more
lucrative rating. However, after seeing the creative
Frequency last week and now the exciting U-571, my
bias is beginning to go away. Both films are as
innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual
for older viewers. Even better, I didn't think either
one of these films would be any good from first
instincts. Everyone loves surprises. U-571 looked like
another action film using an actual war as an excuse
to shoot torpedoes and bullets. This may be true, but
the action is so extraordinary that it is clear
director/co-writer Jonathan Mostow completed his
ultimate goal; to blow the audience's socks off. </P>
<P>Set during the early stages of World War 2 when the
United States struggled to break the codes of the
technologically advanced German U-boats, U-571 follows
a small crew of American men who swipe the typewriter
necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship.
There's only one problem: the American ship they came
from and hoped to return to has been shot down
stranding the men on a German submarine known as (you
guessed it) U-571. It is now up to the mostly young
and inexperienced sailors, led by an interim captain
named Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), to return the
typewriter to America without getting sunk by far
superior German ships. </P>
<P>The film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak
opening action sequence and another uneventful half an
hour to introduce several of the sailors (most of whom
die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably
disappear). Once the crew gets on the U-boat, the
movie shifts to another level and never leaves this
high energy level until the ending credits roll down.
As soon as the action starts, it does not stop and
luckily, because it is so exciting, I didn't want it
to stop. This is not a movie for those wanting to
avoid loud noises, from the wonderful, heart-pounding
score to the constant yelling of panicking men, make
sure you see this at a theater with
surround-sound…otherwise, do not see it all.  </P>
<P>The best parts of U-571 are when Tyler is forced to
make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly
impossible situations. Throughout the movie, several
morals or characters are introduced to make Tyler's
job as stressful as possible. Germans gun down their
own men, Tyler's mentor Captain Dahlgren warns him
that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even
the most beloved soldiers for a victory, another
sailor (Erik Palladino) threatens mutiny. All of these
examples, and several others, increase the chaotic
atmosphere and the importance of Tyler's every move.
They also make U-571 one of the most exhilarating
movies I have seen in a while. </P>
<PRE>Grade: ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
