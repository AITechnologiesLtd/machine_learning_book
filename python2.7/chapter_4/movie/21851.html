<PRE>Grade: B-        </PRE>
<P>It makes perfect sense why Mike Myers decided to make another "Austin Powers"
film.         The original was a box office hit which introduced new phrases into
our pop-culture vocabulary. It made Mike Myers an independent household name
without the accompaniment of Dana Carvey or the black baseball cap and the torn
blue jeans he wore in "Wayne's World". With "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me", Myers has permanently left his name on a select list of comedic geniuses
of the 1990's. Genius is an appropriate word. Only geniuses would use the same
jokes that earned them big bucks in the past for future events. This strategy
takes advantage of the pleasures of target audiences and gets as much money as
it can out of these viewers until their act grows tiresome. Myers has followed
this lucrative code by appearing as his Austin Powers creation in a number of
ads, an MTV awards show, a Madonna music video, a trivia computer game and now
in the sequel "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". Luckily for him, his
British spy has not grown tiresome…yet. 
The sequel is almost a carbon copy of the original. The same characters and the
same gags are used in both films. In the sequel, however, the jokes are taken
to a higher level meaning the duration of time each joke requires to execute is
a bit longer. This makes the film enjoyable but it leaves an uncomfortable
feeling of déjà vu. Although the title ostensibly suggests that Austin Powers
is the star of the film, Mike Myers' second creation, Dr. Evil, is the main
focus of the film with numerous jokes, one after the other. Austin's titular
character is just a formulaic character who inevitably gets the girl and saves
the day. Dr. Evil is also formulaic indeed, as he is destined to attempt to
take over the world but fail in the last ten minutes, but he is responsible for
the true laughs in the film. His clueless rhetoric on how to use slang in his
sentences is very memorable. He's just trying to fit in. When he incorrectly
makes a statement or when he embarrasses himself physically, he uses his
powerful status to try to prove what he is doing is right, no matter how wrong
he is. For example, when he gets some foam from his Starbucks drink on his nose
and chin, Dr. Evil immediately replies, once realizing it is there, that that
is how they drink it in Belgium. "We call it the Belgium Dip." Dr. Evil is so
frightening that no one could argue with him. What is so amusing is Dr. Evil, a
supposedly powerful and audacious, is like a little Teddy Bear, innocuous and
fearful. In order to hide this secret, Dr. Evil hires a number of hilarious
henchmen. Mustafa (Will Ferrell) plays a hit-man who can not stand to be asked
a question three times in a row. Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) is an exact replica of
Dr. Evil, except he is one eighth of his size. Fat Bastard (also played by
Myers) weighs a metric ton who eats because he is sad and is sad because he
eats. These characters are all highlights of the film as they add their own
unique personalities.
Come to think of it, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" when compared to
"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is almost like Dr. Evil when
compared to Mini-Me. It's an identical copy, but bigger and more powerful. </P>
