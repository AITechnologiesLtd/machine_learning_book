<PRE>HEARTBREAKERS
A film review by Max Messier

<P>The problem with a movie like Heartbreakers is that as hard as you try
to concentrate on the notable qualities of the film -- the clever
camerawork, the strong ensemble acting, the deft script -- every time
Jennifer Love Hewitt walks into a scene, her breasts take over.  Even my
date noticed the blatant attempts by the filmmakers in drawing all
attention to the chests of both Sigourney Weaver and Hewitt.  Alas, all
those breasts are never fully revealed -- like some bad 80's teen horror
film censored by Jerry Falwell.</P>
<P>Despite the massive amounts of boob time in Heartbreakers, the film
delivers all the goods of a solid comedic vehicle.  Max (Weaver) and
Page (Hewitt) are a mother/daughter team who swindle rich guys out of
their dollars in a con involving matrimony vows, extramarital trysts,
and divorce settlements.  Sort of like a cross between Anywhere but Here
and The Grifters.  With the IRS hot on their proverbial tails, the duo
team up for one last job, bilking cigarette tycoon William B. Tensy
(Gene Hackman) out of his cash.  Alas, during the con job, Page ends up
falling in love with a local bar owner (Jason Lee), a dead body ends up
in their trunk, Princess Leia shows up as a divorce attorney, and a
jilted ex-husband (Ray Liotta) shows up waving a gun and advising group
therapy for everyone.</P>
<P>The glue that holds this familiar story together lies in the actors
involved in the production.  Hackman delivers a memorable performance as
the wheezing, hacking, brown-toothed William B. Tensy.  Jason Lee, one
of the best young actors working in Hollywood these days, brings a warm,
subtle touch to his role of the lovelorn bar owner head-over-heels in
love with Page.  Weaver delivers another knockout comedic punch as the
protective mother Max.  And Hewitt actually pulls together a credible
acting job despite the screen time she has to share with her breasts.</P>
<P>The best work in the film is given by Ray Liotta, the most intense man
ever to grace the screen.  He has the uncanny ability to take one- or
two-dimensional roles, in such films as Cop Land, Hannibal, and No
Escape, and turn in an outstanding, memorable job.  The only problem is
that I'm still trying to forget about his roles in Turbulence and
Muppets from Space.</P>
<P>Despite the positives, Heartbreakers does have its minor flaws.  The
"protective mother" scenario drags on for too long, and the complete and
total ignorance of every male in the film over Max and Page's con jobs
is a bit too hard to swallow.  And not that I'm complaining, but who
wears skintight dresses every day of the year?</P>
<P>In a nutshell, though, this is a love story.  Beneath all the lying, the
cheating, the backstabbing, the hacking coughs, and the cleavage we find
a familiar tale of true love.  How sweet it is.</P>
