<P>Director Stanley Kubrick passed away in his sleep only four days after
handing in his final cut of this film. Lovebirds Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman spent close to two years of their lives shooting this film with the
infamous perfectionist. Harvey Keitel, well...let's just say that everyone
got really stressed. Now, let's see what all the fuss was about...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A wife, upset by her husband's lack of jealousy, begins to flirt around and
admit to having thoughts of adultery. Her husband, shaken by his wife's
forthrightness in this respect, spends the night wandering from one very odd
sexually induced circumstance to another.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is not for everyone. It is a complex, overly symbolic,
turtle-paced, dramatic sexual investigation, which features some great
acting from Tom Cruise, a consistently intriguing eye from director Kubrick,
a creepy score and plenty of beautifully photographed sequences. Did I fully
understand the whole movie? Certainly not. Would I be willing to watch it
again after discussing its complete potency with others? Certainly. But
understand that if you are the type of viewer who likes a film's meaning
handed to you on a silver platter, certainly, this one ain't for you. This
film is basically a big-budget art-house flick starring the Cruises and
directed by a legend in the field of movie creation. It's also very nice to
look at, with some solid acting, but much like many other art-house films,
there is way too much that is left to interpretation, leaving you feeling
somewhat hollow immediately after the film's conclusion. The film's message,
much like any other piece of art, is left to be quite subjective, and
certainly better understood after several viewings, or at least some
coaching.</P>
<P>Having said that, I do believe that the film moved along at too slow a pace,
with many coupled conversations seeming to go on far beyond their interest
point. And this is all despite the fact that the subject matters at hand,
jealousy and sex, struck a nerve with me. I personally would have
appreciated a much deeper insight into their rooted interplay, as opposed to
the larger emphasis paid to one very particularly strange scenario featuring
a lot of naked people. I don't think I've seen this many breasts parading
around in a movie since the last porno that "a friend left at my house." The
film's brighter points feature a superb presentation of sights and sounds
through a grainy-gaze, plenty of joyous Christmas lights sprinkled all
around, and a typically memorable score by the man named Kubrick (Despite
its obvious use for dramatics at certain points.)</P>
<P>All in all, much like many of Mr. Kubrick's other films, this is not the
kind of movie that can be fully digested in one sitting. If you are the type
of person who likes to decontruct puzzles, loves naked people and has a
hard-on for either Tom Cruise or Stanley Kubrick, then check this one out,
you might truly enjoy its uniqueness. If, on the other hand, you don't like
long, generally slow and esoteric films, featuring Nicole Kidman laughing
way too much, then I suggest you skip out on this one altogether, and maybe
check back into it in a couple of years. Who knows...your eyes might be
willing to be much more wide open by then :) (Sorry, but it's been a long
day, and that's the only cheezy pun that I could come up with at this late
hour...)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Believe it or not, infamously reclusive director Stanley Kubrick actually
makes a cameo in this film. Look for him sitting at a table in the cafe
where Bill gets Nick's address.
Actors Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh's scenes had to be deleted
when both actors could not return to London to re-shoot some of their
scenes. Director Kubrick respectively replaced the duo with actors Sidney
Pollack and Marie Richardson.
A VHS copy of the Tom Cruise movie RAIN MAN (8/10) can be seen in Alice and
Bill's bedroom on top of their entertainment stand during their
marijuana-enhanced argument.
A 65-second sequence during the film's orgy scene was digitally altered.
Kubrick, apparently suspecting he'd have trouble getting past the MPAA
ratings board in the U.S., authorized an edit of the scene which consisted
of superimposing objects, and people, over the exposed genitalia of some
actors. The film did indeed receive an R rating, rather than the dreaded
NC-17. European versions of the film will be uncensored (natch!).
The paintings hung on the wall of the Harford's apartment are the work of
Kubrick's widow, Christiane, and their daughter Katharina.
Leelee Sobieski, the teen actress who plays a key role in the film, has told
reporters that she got along beautifully with the reclusive Kubrick, and
asked him for a lock of hair for her collection (apparently she collects the
hair of famous people she works with). An amused Kubrick complied. Sadly,
Tom Cruise did not.
Astonishingly, the budget for Eyes Wide Shut, despite a 15-month shoot, came
in a relatively modest $65 million.
The streets of Manhattan where Cruise walks were re-created, in meticulous
detail, at Kubrick's Pinewood Studios outside of London, where the entire
movie was filmed.
Kubrick retained tight control of the film through the end, including its
marketing campaign: He personally selected the teaser clip and trailer
images to be shown. And he had strong feelings regarding the press, with the
New York Daily News reporting that the director had left instructions that
only five publications were to be granted interviews: the New York Times,
the Los Angeles Times, Premiere, TIME, and Newsweek. Kubrick also wanted to
ensure that the teaser and trailer were shown on the Internet.</P>
