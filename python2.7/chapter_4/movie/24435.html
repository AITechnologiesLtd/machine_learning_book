<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"Gladiator" (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Ridley Scott
Written by David H. Franzoni, John Logan, William
Nicholson</PRE>
<P>Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, Oliver 
Reed, and Djimon Hounsou.</P>
<P>Imagine this. You're given a sword and a shield and
very basic, minimal training. A man you don't know
tells you that this will be the last day that you will
live. You are thrown into an arena with thousands of
spectators wanting to see you die. You frantically
monitor several closed doors which, in seconds, will
release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you. You
watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few
days are murdered in cold blood. If you are lucky
enough to survive this chaos thrown at you, you know
you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow.
Eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are,
you're going to die. This is the life of a gladiator.
You'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing
Ridley Scott's powerful Gladiator, you'll be thankful
for that.  </P>
<P>With his new film, Scott has returned cinema to the
fascinating age of the ancient Roman Empire. And like
those preceding it, Spartacus and Ben Hur, Gladiator
has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead
actor, a wonderful supporting cast, eye-catching
special effects, and a great script. Since the two
aforementioned films came out before the prime target
viewers of Gladiator (teenagers to thirty-year-old
males) were around, a whole new genre may just be
reborn and revisited. </P>
<P>>From a weak beginning, the film starts off extremely
gloomy and inauspicious. Rome's best general Maximus
(Russell Crowe), who has helped the Empire conquer
nearly everywhere they have attempted, is currently
(in the year 180 A.D. that is) waging a war against
Germania. Scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward
style, similar to that of Saving Private Ryan but much
less effective. It's blurry, in slow motion, and the
sound is muted. As soon as this artistic method began,
it was hard to tell what was what and who was who.
It's a good thing Scott stops this after the first
twenty minutes or else Gladiator would have been
torture to watch. Instead, the general swears he will
get out after this battle. He wants to go back to his
family and his crops, he wants a quiet life. But,
unexpectedly, he gets anything but that. The dying
emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris),
decides to have Maximus appointed new emperor of Rome
once he dies. He asks Maximus to restore the Republic
by giving more power to the senators. All of this does
not go well for Aurelius' son, Commodus (Joaquin
Phoenix) who was expecting his father to name him the
new emperor. Jealous and upset, Commodus kills his own
father, names himself emperor, kills Maximus' wife and
son, and attempts to kill Maximus. But Maximus is able
to escape his own death and vows to kill Commodus and
fulfill Marcus Aurelius' wishes. Now a slave, the only
way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal
is to become a winning gladiator, who eventually are
released for their success. </P>
<P>A story of betrayal and promises, Gladiator is more
than just a mindless action flick. You actually care
about the characters, sometimes even the evil villain
Commodus, who is just a young man as determined to
make Rome one way as Maximus is determined to make it
the other way. Phoenix plays his character
brilliantly. Think of Commodus as the Percy Wetmore
(of pant-wetter The Green Mile) of the Roman Empire -
a whiny, sleazy,
"respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man" brat who
hates when he's not the center of attention. Every
scene we see Commodus, he's either crying or he looks
like he has just been crying. Phoenix has definitely
matured as an actor since To Die For, and Gladiator
shows he's more than just River's little brother.
Crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced
hero. Maximus is one of the few characters in recent
cinema who actually has emotions. This guy actually
acts like a anyone in his situation would act, he's no
invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners,
he (believe it or not) acts like a human being! The
rest of the cast, including Richard Harris, Djimon
Hounsou, Walter Hill, Derek Jacobi, and Connie Nielsen
are also first rate. </P>
<P>Ridley Scott, using outstanding special effects, has
brilliantly recreated the Roman Coliseum, the loudness
of the Roman Mob, and the city of Rome in general. The
visuals are breathtaking and voluminous, like a
Cleopatra of the year 2000. The costuming is also
wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the
exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians.  </P>
<P>Gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big
screen to get the most out of the experience. Along
with U-571, action fans should have plenty to see in
theaters this week and should expect much more
excitement to come this summer of 2000. </P>
