<P>I've been a fan of "Rugrats," the hit Nickelodeon cartoon series, for a 
long time. Tommy (voiced by E.G. Daily) is the plucky leader of the 
precocious toddlers, accompanied by his best friend, the timid, but loyal,
 Chuckie (Christine Cavanaugh). Earthy twins Phil and Lil (Kath Soucie) 
complete the fab four, with Angela (Cheryl Chase), Tommy's slightly older,
 very bratty cousin, always ready to cause trouble for the babies. The 
charm of the show comes from the kids' innocent outlook on the world, as 
well as their refreshingly matter-of-fact approach to dirt, bugs and body 
functions. Adding to the fun is the show's gently satiric portrayals of 
the infants' colorful parents and grandparents. </P>
<P>"The Rugrats Movie" marks the first big-screen foray for the kids and any 
movie featuring a nursery full of singing newborns who create a fountain 
of water by peeing into the air is all right in my book. That said, "The 
Rugrats Movie" disappointments in a number of ways. While the film 
features nice music and boasts a number of ingenious moments, it overdoes 
the bombast, making the babies play second fiddle to a series of raucous 
action scenes and parodies of other movies.</P>
<P>Following a take-off of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the main storyline 
kicks in. Tommy Pickles' life is disrupted by the arrival of baby brother 
Dil (Tara Charendoff), whose nonstop howling drives the child to 
distraction. When Tommy and company decide to return Dil to the "baby 
store," they hop in the Reptar Wagon, a super-powered Big Wheel created 
by Tommy's inventor father, Stu (Jack Riley, Mr. Carlin from "The Bob 
Newhart Show") and promptly get lost in the forest, leading to a series 
of misadventures with escaped circus monkeys, a wolf and various other 
scary things. Meanwhile, the families, aided by two forest rangers 
(Whoopi Goldberg and David Spade), desperately search for the kids, while 
the press (led by Tim Curry) bombard them with idiotic questions.</P>
<P>Judging from the laughter and applause, the kids at the screening I 
attended loved every second of the movie, especially the numerous body 
function jokes. My reaction was less enthusiastic. After a strong 
beginning, the film turns into a overly busy action movie, and that's not 
what I came to see. I love the "Rugrats" series not because of the action,
 but rather the characters' conversations and responses during the action.
 In the series, we get to hear the babies talk to each other, and the 
glimpses into their personalities provide the charm and fun of the show. </P>
<P>There's some of that in the movie, but not nearly enough. Too much of the 
film consists of everyone racing frantically about, avoiding one brush 
with disaster after another. I can get that with any movie. From the 
"Rugrats," I look for personality, and the film comes up short in that 
department.</P>
<P>Because of the clever moments, the nifty soundtrack and my affection for 
the characters, I'm giving "The Rugrats Movie" a marginal recommendation. 
The film's target audience of little kids should make the production a 
hit. But if the filmmakers want to satisfy the grown-ups (and make no 
mistake, the TV show has a huge adult following), they'll tone down the 
frenzied action and turn up the personality and quiet moments for the 
next "Rugrats" movie. </P>
