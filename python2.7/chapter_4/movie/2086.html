<P>     In 1964's A SHOT IN THE DARK, Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau
met a young Maria Gambrelli (then played by Elke Sommers, now by
Claudia Cardinale).  Twenty-nine years later, it's revealed that Maria
and Jacques had a brief fling, the result of which was Jacques
Gambrelli (Roberto Benigni) who, during the course of this film, comes
to be known as Jacques Clouseau Jr.  Gambrelli learns of his father's
identity while working on the case of the missing Princess Yasmin
(Debrah Farentino), the beautiful daughter of an Asian king.</P>
<P>     Nothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep
churning out sequels long after its time is past.  Thirty years ago,
when classics like THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK came out,
they were among the best comedies available.  Three more Sellers'
PANTHER movies subsequently were released (THE RETURN OF THE PINK
PANTHER, THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES BACK, and THE REVENGE OF THE PINK
PANTHER), none as good as the first two, but all worthwhile
diversions.  Unfortunately, Sellers' death in 1980 failed to stem the
tide of the films which, at that point, should have been ended.  THE
TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER and THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER were
produced, neither of which was worth the price of admission.</P>
<P>     Now, ten years after CURSE, just when we thought we were free of
the series, movie #8 comes out.  Finally, Blake Edwards has
acknowledged that the original Clouseau is dead, not missing (as was
the premise in the two early-80s pictures), so to fill in the gap he
gives us a previously unknown son, played by Italian comic actor
Roberto Benigni.</P>
<P>     Benigni, star of the farce JOHNNY STECCHINO, is adept when it
comes to physical humor, and his abilities are highlighted here in four
or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick.  However, while
these produce some laughter, they are largely regurgitations of
material from previous PINK PANTHER entries.  Beyond copying Peter
Sellers' style, Benigni has little to do, and less by which to
distinguish himself.</P>
<P>     Old friends like Cato (Burt Kwouk) and Dr. Balls (Graham Stark)
are back, even though the thinly-plotted script can come up for no
logical reason for them to be there.  Each appears only briefly, doing
the same old shtick.  Of course, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is
on hand as well, but he doesn't seem the same.  I guess the years have
taken away his edge.  The anticipated apoplexy when he learns of
Clouseau's offspring, is mild.</P>
<P>     Blake Edwards, although long regarded as a comic genius, has
recently turned out a string of barely-watchable films.  Gone are the
BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and SOBs, replaced by such memorable titles as
SKIN DEEP (with the infamous condom scene) and SWITCH.  Far from
bringing him back to the glory days, SON OF THE PINK PANTHER further
entrenches Edwards in the pit of mediocrity into which he has
descended.  Once, we demanded superlative films from him; now, we're
just hoping for something somewhat entertaining.</P>
<P>     The opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the PINK
PANTHERs.  Although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix
with live actors, the interaction is stale and fails to stir a
chuckle.  It's sad, because I always considered the Pink Panther to be
one of the funnier cartoon characters, both on his own and introducing
the Clouseau movies.</P>
<P>     Not only is the animated panther not up to snuff, but the opening
theme is sub-par as well.  Henry Mancini's well-liked "Pink Panther"
tune is horribly "modernized" by Bobby McFerrin ("mangled" might be a
better word).  At least the end credits retain the original music in
its full orchestral splendor.</P>
<P>     There's very little about this movie that isn't disappointing.
One might make the foolish assumption that for a PINK PANTHER film to
be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the
series, there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new
and inventive.  Instead, however, we are lumbered with this
cobbled-together effort.  If there's a mercy, it's that SON OF THE PINK
PANTHER should finally put the Clouseau family to rest.  Then again,
that's what I thought about THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER.</P>
