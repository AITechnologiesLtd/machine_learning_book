<PRE>                                  THE CURE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Joseph Mazzello, Brad Renfro, Annabella Sciorra,
           Diana Scarwid.
Screenplay:  Robert Kuhn.
Director:  Peter Horton.</PRE>
<P>     There is a scene in THE CURE in which two boys face down a trio
of taunting bullies.  One of the boys has AIDS; the other boy, who
earlier in the film had been afraid of catching the disease, is now
his best friend.  The newly-enlightened boy lectures the bullies
about how the disease could have happened to anyone, and the
chastened bullies walk away.  You might not be surprised to find
such a scene in a movie like THE CURE, but you probably would be
surprised to find it only twenty minutes into the film.  While it is
exceptionally well-acted, THE CURE rambles on for far too long
without a sense of purpose, like an attempt to stretch an
"Afterschool Special" into a feature film.</P>
<P>     Brad Renfro plays Erik, a young loner coping with the absence
of his father and an alcoholic mother (Diana Scarwid).  His new
neighbor is Dexter (Joseph Mazzello), a boy who contracted the AIDS
virus from a blood transfusion, and his mother (Annabella Sciorra).
Although Erik is initially confrontational, the two boys without any
other friends soon develop a close friendship.  Among the activities
they share is an attempt of their own to find a cure for the fatal
disease, and when Erik sees an article in a tabloid newspaper about
a "miracle cure" found in Louisiana, he becomes determined to get it
for Dexter.  Leaving their home in Minnesota, Erik and Dexter travel
south in an attempt to find the key to saving Dexter's life.</P>
<P>     To THE CURE's credit, the most important thing about it, the
relationship between Erik and Dexter, is also the best thing about
it.  Brad Renfro, who made an impressive debut in THE CLIENT, has
the more dynamic role of Erik, the cocky inveterate liar.  There is
an edge to his acting which is uncommon in younger actors who
generally seem to eager to have the audience adore them, and he uses
that to his advantage as the troubled young man in need of a friend.
Mazzello is more than equal to him, granting Erik his tall tales and
half-baked explanations like only young best friends do.  Their
rapport is genuine and very touching, and complemented by the fine
supporting work of Diana Scarwid and Annabella Sciorra as their
mothers.  Sciorra in particular has some great moments as she
becomes a kind of surrogate mother to Erik.</P>
<P>     What sabotages the emotional impact of their friendship is THE
CURE's clumsy and episodic story arc.  By the time the
aforementioned scene between Erik, Dexter and the three bullies
occurs, everyone in the story who is really going to do any changing
has already changed.  There is nothing to do with them but send them
off on a series of adventures, some of which are mildly interesting
but don't really have a dramatic purpose.  While Erik and Dexter are
well-acted and sympathetic characters, at a certain point it becomes
clear that all we are really going to be doing for the rest of THE
CURE's running time is waiting for Dexter to die.</P>
<P>     And what a wait it is.  There is manipulation, and then there
is what THE CURE traffics in, a lingering conclusion in the hospital
which attempts to pull the tears out of you with an industrial
strength vacuum cleaner.  It seems as though screenwriter Robert
Kuhn had an idea for a drama about AIDS and a drama about two
friends on a journey, but neither one was long enough independently
to turn into a feature.  The problem is that THE CURE says nothing
new about AIDS, and bails out on the potentially intriguing
connection of absent fathers between the two boys.  We never learn
anything about where Dexter's father is, and the anticipated meeting
between Erik and his father in New Orleans never materializes.  It's
a shame, because director Peter Horton (TV's "thirtysomething") has
a deft touch with much of the film's potentially pathos-inducing
material.  But when you're playing the AIDS card, you had better
have a really strong hand.  THE CURE has one solid pair of aces, and
a lot of spaces.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 miracle cures:  5.</PRE>
