<P>     The "1600" in the title, MURDER AT 1600, refers to a house number 
on Pennsylvania Avenue:  the address of the White House.  That makes 
this the third movie in three months (following SHADOW CONSPIRACY and 
ABSOLUTE POWER) to deal with high-level government cover-ups, murders, 
and conspiracies.  Who said Americans are cynical about the Presidency?  </P>
<P>     MURDER AT 1600 isn't the worst of the trio (that dubious honor goes 
to SHADOW CONSPIRACY), but it is easily the most preposterous.  There's 
hardly a single aspect of this motion picture that seems more than 
superficially credible, and if the United States government is really 
run in the Keystone Cops manner depicted in Wayne Beach and David 
Hodgin's script, then this country is in a great deal more trouble than 
anyone suspects.</P>
<P>     MURDER AT 1600 opens with a sex scene in the Oval Office, during 
which a unknown man is enjoying the favors of a gorgeous blond.  (Could 
that man be the President?  The President's son?  The bald head of the 
Secret Service wearing a wig?)  Shortly thereafter, the woman's bloody 
corpse is discovered in a White House bathroom.  While the Secret 
Service swarms in to get the situation under control, Washington 
homicide detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) is called in to 
investigate.  We know he's a good cop because a needlessly obvious 
prologue gives us a sample of his on-the-job talents as he uses 
unorthodox methods to save a suicidal man's life.  </P>
<P>     Regis is out of his depth on this murder, however.  The head of the 
Secret Service, Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), is downright 
belligerent, and only the intervention of Alvin Jordan (Alan Alda), the 
President's National Security Advisor, prevents him from forcibly 
ejecting Regis from the White House.  Nina Chance (Diane Lane), Regis' 
Secret Service liaison (and former gold medal winning sharpshooter), is 
equally frosty and unhelpful.  And governmental forces begin to close 
ranks as the trail of blood points squarely at President Jack Neil 
(Ronny Cox) and his son, Kyle (Tate Donovan).  Meanwhile, as if Neil 
doesn't have enough to worry about at home, an overseas hostage crisis 
threatens to boil over.</P>
<P>     While there isn't much that director Dwight Little can do about the 
lack of intelligence in the storyline, he attempts (with varying 
success) to make up for this deficiency by generating a degree of 
tension during some of the otherwise-routine action sequences.  And, 
although there's little doubt regarding the film's ultimate resolution, 
there is at least some suspense about exactly how it comes about.</P>
<P>     Hollywood should be able to generate a more compelling picture with 
such a promising premise.  Perhaps MURDER AT 1600's greatest flaw is 
that it's so ordinary.  There's nothing new here:  we have the maverick 
cop risking everything by taking on the system so that a killer can be 
brought to justice.  Along the way, there are the requisite chases, 
fights, and shoot-outs, but nothing in this film, from beginning to end, 
sets itself apart as even slightly memorable.  The subject matter, if 
not the presidency, deserves more respect.</P>
<P>     Wesley Snipes is pleasant as usual, but this role could hardly be 
described as a challenge.  Diane Lane fails to bring much emotion or 
appeal to the thankless role of Snipes' female sidekick.  Despite 
displaying more energy than Lane, Dennis Miller (as Regis' partner) has 
less screen time.  Daniel Benzali plays the stereotypical bully in a 
position of power.  And Alan Alda, last seen traipsing through Woody 
Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, adds another less-than-sterling entry 
to his underwhelming recent resume.</P>
<P>     It's apparent that MURDER AT 1600 underwent some fairly heavy re-
editing shortly before its release.  Not only are there some jarring 
transitions and conspicuous plot holes, but a number of scenes featured 
heavily during the theatrical previews (including Regis uttering the 
momentous line: "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- an address that changes all 
the rules") have been excised from the final print.  Not having seen the 
original cut, I can't say whether these changes have helped MURDER AT 
1600.  Regardless of their impact, however, the result is nothing for 
any of the participants to be overly proud of.</P>
