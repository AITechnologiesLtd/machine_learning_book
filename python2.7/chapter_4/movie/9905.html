<PRE>Alien Resurrection</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Thomas Skogestad</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dominique Peron, Dan Hedaya
Written by: Joss Whedon</P>
<P>(Re)viewed at Soria Moria 1, as part of Oslo internasjonale
filmfestival (<A HREF="http://wit.no/filmfestival">http://wit.no/filmfestival</A>) Friday, November 21 1997.</P>
<PRE>Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>This is the fourth entry in the Alien saga. I've never really liked
Alien, but got a gigantic kick out of Aliens. Alien³ is perhaps
underrated but I did not like all the tunnell running. And I didn't
particularly like the cop out at the beginning.</P>
<P>The premise for Alien Resurrection (not the lack of colon (:)-, there
is none on screen) is intriguing. Some blood from Ripley has been
recovered and is used to breed a new mother alien. This I think is
fascinating, but handled rather shortly in the film, though there is a
rather explicit «hint» at previous problems. I'd like tosee more of
this. But the purpose of the cloning is just brushed over and I get a
feeling that this isn't really interesting for the movie. The cloning
only seems to threre to serve as a setup for a remake of the earlier
films.  I.e. there is a lot of attacks and fights and people being
killed. There is a scene that is reminiscent of the death scene in
Alien³, and perhaps a character is a homage to both Alien and another
Ridley Scott film (director of Alien) - Blade Runner (which I also
dislike).</P>
<P>Of course the alien breaks loose, and get this - she is not
alone. People have been brought on board to act as incubators for more
aliens. All the aliens on the loose of course leads to a lot of people
trying to escape. Things go awry and the spaceship the movie is set on
reverts to emergency mode and is headed for a place we don't want the
ship to go. This is perhaps meant to be a tense situation, but I never
felt any kind of grip. We all know how things will end, don't we?</P>
<P>There are however several good action scenes, including one under
water. The movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who did the
visually wonderful Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children. I
suppose some of his inventivness can be seen on screen, such as (bad)
breath used to identify people. But really - the film doesn't go any
further compared to those two movies. It is just technically very well
done. The cinematography is by Darius Khondji, best known for Se7en
(he also did Delicatessen and City). And just like in Se7en there is
some gruesome violence, but most of it is just hinted at and if you
blink you might miss it.</P>
<P>The movie about 1 hour 50 minutes. This surprisingly short. I felt
that when the movie ended things were getting really interesting. But
perhaps Alien 5 will pick up here... (And there are no crazy credits
from what I could see.)</P>
