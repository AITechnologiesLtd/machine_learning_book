<P>     BRASSED OFF!, the only musical mining drama that's likely to grace
our shores this (or any other) year, has, to its credit, a strong cast
(headlined by Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald, and Ewan McGregor),
several compelling characters, and plenty of fine brass music.  (Music
and dialogue rendered on a recording so crisp that I actually had
trouble paying attention to the movie!  Since when did small films start
sounding so big?)  What sends this British import right down the crapper
is a weighty mix of dour drama-- striking miners, families strapped for
cash, clowns trying to commit suicide, etc.-- and heavy-handed politics.
Ugh.  By the end, when the colliery band makes it to their final competi- 
tion, there's nothing left to celebrate, except, perhaps, the impending
restoration of blood flow to a certain bum deal.  An interesting movie,
I suppose, but way too bitter to be bittersweet.</P>
