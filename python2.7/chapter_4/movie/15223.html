<PRE>                         WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Robin Williams plays a man who dies
          and goes to an art gallery curator's idea of
          heaven.  He yearns to be reunited with his wife,
          unfortunately still alive.  Visually this film is
          real jaw-dropper, one of the most amazing visual
          films ever made, but the content of the story is
          syrupy sweet and cloying.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10),
          high +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 3 positive, 10 negative, 5 mixed</PRE>
<P>     One of my favorite writers is Richard Matheson who represents to
me the Twilight Zone sort of fiction that I enjoyed so much when I was
growing up.  His writing spans science fiction and horror; it spans
books, magazines, TV, and film work.  Stephen King cites Matheson as a
very strong influence on his writing, and justifiably so.  Matheson is
probably the major American writer to take horror and move it from
Transylvanian castles to places like American suburbs.  The only
Matheson novel I have ever not liked was a horrible sugary view of
heaven called WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  At the time I read it I had
speculated that Matheson had recently lost a loved one and had to get
that death out of his system somehow.  I assumed that his way to do it
was to write a novel that would give him comfort.  It did not do much
for me.  The novel has been published alone and bound with a Matheson
companion novel BID TIME RETURN, basis of the film SOMEWHERE IN TIME.
The two novels together form his sentimental works.</P>
<P>     One is pulled in two very different directions by WHAT DREAMS MAY
COME.  The story is still the treacle that Matheson wrote.  But the
visual imagery is spectacular to use a word that gets used too often
and should be reserved for a film like this.  I have not seen very many
films done this beautifully in my life.  Matheson's novel has been
transformed into a new Divine Comedy for our times.  And like the
original "Divine Comedy" of Dante, the story is wretched and the
imagery is totally enchanting.  (Okay, that is a personal opinion on
Dante).</P>
<P>     Chris Nielsen (played by Robin Williams) and Annie Nielsen
(Annabella Sciorra) have more love in their lives than is really safe
to have.  They love each other so much that it is almost perverse.
They also love 19th century painting.  They love their two children.
They love their pet dog.  But their marriage is marked by tragedy.
Death has claimed first their dog and then their two children.  Four
years after an automobile accident has claimed the two children
physician Chris stops to be a Good Samaritan in a traffic tunnel
accident.  In a flash he is the last in a line deaths that Annie has
had to face.   But the point of view is not Annie's but Chris's.  He
finds himself first in a middle world where his ghost haunts Annie,
then it moves on to heaven.  Chris is guided through the lands of death
by a Virgil-like angel figure named Albert (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).</P>
<P>     And what a place heaven is!  For Chris, heaven is in three
dimensions what a beautiful 19th century painting is in only two.
Everywhere he looks from every angle what he sees is a beautiful
painting.  And who comes bounding up but his dog, no longer old and
feeble but young and vibrant.  Chris loves heaven.  The dog loves
heaven.  Chris will be angelically happy here... at least for the first
two weeks.  We get to see Chris's heaven, we get to see the heaven of
some other people.  And Chris gets to work out his problems.  But then
something happens.  This something will lead Chris on an adventure
seeing more of this metaphysical world including a visit to hell.</P>
<P>     Vincent Ward, director of THE NAVIGATOR and MAP OF THE HUMAN
HEART, gets from both Robin Williams and from Annabella Sciorra
performances that are unselfconsciously unctuous.  Cuba Gooding, Jr.
comes off as benevolent and dull.  But then even the plot twists are
dull and have a "so-what?" feel about them.  Max Von Sydow adds a
Bergman-esque touch appropriate to this world.  (There is one minor
problem I can help the viewer through right now.  When there are
references to the Nielsen's daughter, they are referring to the younger
child.  Marie Nielsen, played by Jessica Brooks Grant, is deceptively
boyish looking but proves to be a girl.)</P>
<P>     But then there are the visuals.  And if you just turn off your
mind and look at the screen, all plot problems can easily be forgiven.
Most artistic visualizations of heaven are saccharine.  People have a
natural interest in hell most visualizations of heaven are not all that
interesting.  This film manages to make heaven almost as interesting as
hell... but in a different way.</P>
<P>     It is really difficult to rate a film with such extremes of
quality.  The story is nothing impressive, but some of the images are
breathtaking.  On balance I have to rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
