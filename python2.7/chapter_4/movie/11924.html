<PRE>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 20th Century Fox
 Director:  Nicholas Hytner
 Writer:  Wendy Wasserstein, novel by Stephen McCauley
 Cast: Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, Tim Daly, Alan Alda, Nigel
Hawthorne, John Pankow</PRE>
<P>   At a wedding reception toward the end of "The Object of
My Affection," George Hanson introduces his pregnant
roommate Nina Borowski as his friend.  Assuming that Nina
must be George's wife, one woman at a table remarks, "I
cannot imagine my husband calling me his friend."  This light,
sappy, and hardly believable comedy centers on an issue that
probably passes for philosophic discussion in many a college
dorm.  Can a man and a woman live together, enjoying an
intimate and fulfilling relationship, without sex?  The answer to
this enigma becomes clear enough by the story's conclusion,
and though the difficulties faced by most of the principal
characters are resolved, the resolution is a bittersweet one.</P>
<P>   Though "The Object of My Affection" is diverting, it's difficult
to believe that heavy hitters like Wendy Wasserstein, Nicholas
Hytner, and Nigel Hawthorne are major contributors to the
picture.  Hytner did, after all, make his motion picture debut
with a stunning transposition to the screen of the play "The
Madness of George III" with Nigel Hawthorne in the title role
of a loony British monarch.  Wasserstein, a feminist with such
sophisticated scripts as "The Heidi Chronicles" to her
playwriting credit, must have stuck too closely to the novel by
Stephen McCauley.  And Hawthorne is just one of the world's
great actors, who at least brings his considerable thespian
qualities to a bland movie, and in a relatively small role easily
overshadows his fellow performers.</P>
<P>   The story is about several couples whose attachments are
unrequited.  As Hawthorne states in the role of a drama
professor, what happens when the object of your affection
does not return the affection to the degree which you expect? 
Vince McBride (John Pankow) is in love with Nina Borowski
(Jennifer Aniston), who feels that something does not quite
click in their relationship.  Nina, in turn, is in love with George
Hanson (Paul Rudd), who is gay and, try though he may, is
not able to fulfill all of Nina's needs.  George is in love with
Dr. Robert Joley (Tim Daly), a literature instructor who has
found someone else.  Rodney Fraser (Nigel Hawthorne) has a
relationship with a much younger man, a student named Paul
(Amo Gulinello), whose eyes wander toward someone more
his age.  George's brother Frank (Steve Zahn) is about to get
married, but then, he has had seven fiances, and who knows
whether his alliance will work out?  Relationships are tough:
they require a healthy combination of sexual attraction and
intellectual compatability which is so difficult to attain that
stage, screen and the printed page continue to be filled with 
tales of heartache.</P>
<P>   Most of the action takes place in Brooklyn, where Nina
earns her living as a counselor in a center for teens and lives
in a second-floor walkup while her more earthy sister,
Constance (Allison Janney) lives the high life with her
successful book-agent husband, Sidney (Alan Alda).  When
things fall apart between Nina and her boyfriend, she invites
George to share her flat, which he accepts since he has just
been tossed out of his quarters by his own boyfriend.  Much
of the movie centers on whether George and Nina, who have
incompatible sexual temperaments but who are on the same
wave intellectually and socially, can make a go of things. 
Since life is anything but tidy, George and Nina become
caught up in a game of sexual politics that turns their
otherwise accomplished lives inside out.</P>
<P>   Jennifer Aniston, known to TV fans for her role in the
ensemble comedy "Friends" and to movie enthusiasts for her
starring part in "Picture Perfect" turns in her most
accomplished performance here.  She shows a capacity for
growth and for portraying three-dimensional characters
confronted by a host of conflicting emotions, but this time
around she is stuck with a script which is overly sentimental
and unimaginable.  Paired off with John Pankow, who seems
to come from another movie and shares no chemistry with
Ms. Aniston's character, she is unable to materialize
sufficiently as an actress and not just someone who is quite
pleasant to look at.  Nigel Hawthorne is himself enough
reason to see this or any other work he's in.  Here he acts as
the aging homosexual who brings the film's only sobering
advice, when he counsels Nina to discontinue her alliance
with a handsome and thoroughly nice young man who can
never give her what she so desperately needs.  Paul Rudd
looks good but is too nice to bring a needed edge to the
story.  The film suffers from choppy, overly zealous editing,
leading to a seemingly unending variety of scenes.</P>
<P>    "The Object of My Affection" plays on gay-straight
stereotypes that are all too familiar to us, offering little that's
new or particularly surprising. Rated PG-13  Running Time:
111 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
