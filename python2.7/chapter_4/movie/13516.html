<PRE>GODZILLA
(TRI-STAR)</PRE>
<P>RUNNING TIME: 2 HOURS 20 MINUTES
STARRING MATTHEW BRODERICK, JEAN RENO AND MARIA PITILLO
DIRECTED BY ROLAND EMMERICH</P>
<P>Fantastically over hyped, Godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen. The
film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands,
then an attack on a boat from some beast, and finally we join Dr. Nick
Tatopoulos (Broderick looking about 17 years old) doing some research  in
Chernobyl. Some shady U.S government guys appear, and ask him to come to an
island where they have massive footprints, from what looks like a giant
lizard. And what's more, this beast is heading for New York. Gulp!</P>
<P>Although Godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride, and at some
points it is, there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about
this movie. The main faults lie with the acting and writing, common problems
with 'summer blockbuster' movies. Broderick is pretty useless as the hero,
with no humour or a 'tough guy' image. While Emmerich's previous summer
flick, Independence Day (1996) had wisecracks and action from Jeff Goldblum
and Will Smith, this has neither. Also, Maria Pitillo, as Broderick's former
girlfriend, is just as useless, with a chronic disability in acting. She's
incapable of showing emotion, speaks every line in the same way, and
basically she's total crap. It's up to french actor Jean Reno to save the
day, and indeed he does, turning in a campy performance as a french secret
agent. Shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film. Hank
Azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'Animal', and he adds a
little life to the picture. Also making an appearance is Harry Shearer
(probably best know for doing voices in The Simpsons) as a slimy news
reporter.</P>
<P>O.K, so the acting is not up to par, but it never is in these movies. But
what about the script? Well, that's not up to par either. Emmerich and
screenwriting pal Dean Devlin seem so caught in the destruction of New York
City that they forgot to write a script. The dialogue is banal (Broderick
looks at a lot of fish and utters 'That's a lot of fish.'), and the
character development is non existent (Reno plays the typical frenchman ('No
croissant?'), Broderick forever remains a geeky scientist.) Also, the film
is seriously lacking a sense of humour. The jokes that are uttered are
pathetic, and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about Siskel and Ebert.
(The mayor is Mayor Ebert, and is assistant is called Gene! HA HA HA HA!.)
The plot is dire, and in the end just rips off Jurassic Park (1993) by
having lots of baby Godzilla's (i.e. Velicorapters) running around New York.</P>
<P>Right, so the script and acting suck. But what about the special effects?
Thankfully, they're are quite good. Godzilla is an impressive piece of CGI,
although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark. The
destruction of New York is pretty well done aswell. But although they are
impressive, they can't save Godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and
boring movie. The movie goes on for far too long aswell, and it can't seem
to decide on a ending. And of course, the ending itself leaves possibility
for a sequel. Let's just hope one never arrives.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING= ** OUT OF *****</PRE>
