<P>Martin Scorsese's films don't age.  Taxi Driver is one of his most
timeless efforts, along with The Last Temptation of Christ, Mean
Streets, GoodFellas, and Raging Bull.  His films are usually filled with
overt anger and fury at society, the mob, New York… He is so
indescribably talented: he mixes his rage with hidden gems of humor.
Beyond the gun fights, the blood, and the swearing is a message on
society, something brilliantly and brutally real, something about
America, and something about the world.  This is enough to garner
respect and admiration- but he has also assisted in film preservation
and his risqué attitudes advanced the state of auteur motion pictures.
Taxi Driver is fiery, enraged, and feels like poison- the streets of New
York are devilishly depicted as the homes of prostitutes, pimps, and
drug dealers.  It is uncomfortable, it is eerie.</P>
<P>Robert DeNiro, in his highly acclaimed and revolutionary performance, is
Travis Bickle, a man who is an outsider in New York.  He hates New York
with a passion and cannot wait to perform his vengeance on the city.
What is compelling is that Travis himself is not pure.  His morals are
so poorly structured that he thinks pornography is what normal people
watch.  He drives his taxi nights, he is an insomniac.  When he sees
Betsy, a political campaigner (Cybill Shepherd), he sees what he wishes
the world would be filled with- pure people like her.  He is slinky
while pursuing her and she eventually dates him.  When that fails, his
repression becomes too much- he must find an outlet through which he can
express himself.</P>
<P>For him, the easiest way to get rid of his fury is through violence.  He
buys a whole set if guns from an elusive drug dealer and begins playing
with them like a child plays with toys.  His burning wrath at New York
society is only increased by what he sees in his customers- people who
seek the death of their philandering wives, rich tycoons having flings
with hookers, and a twelve-year-old prostitute being battered by her
pimp.  This prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster) fixes what Travis decides to
do with his life- he decides to save her from her wicked pimp Sport
(Harvey Keitel).  He believes that Iris should be in school, with her
parents.  He knows she has lost her innocence, but she can still return
to a happy childhood, she is only twelve.  Jodie Foster gives an
abnormally mature and preconscious performance as Iris and her knowledge
and identification with her character is deeply felt.  The finale where
Travis murders everyone who stands in the way of him saving this girl is
his way of doing something he thinks is good, full of heart, and
noteworthy, and also excreting his rage through violence.  It is so
chilling, so frightening because we know that this killing spree is only
a temporary way of distancing himself from his insanity.</P>
<P>Robert DeNiro's performance is so genius because he turned Travis Bickle
into a bitter Vietnam vet as charismatic as Humphrey Bogart, as twisted
as Jack Nicholson, and as thoughtful as Spencer Tracy.  He strips Travis
down to his rotten, unredeemed core.  The movie's score by the legendary
Bernard Hermann was recorded a day before he died- it is rip-roaring and
comical, staccato and consuming.</P>
<P>What is wrong with Taxi Driver is more of an opinion.  The movie is made
in such an- er- ugly way, the streets of New York are so congested, so
Midnight Cowboy-ish, so disgusting, and the movie is so unredeeming,
cold, and black-hearted- it is hard to care about the characters or care
for the movie at all.  The atmosphere is thick, humid, and wicked and
that is what detracts from appreciating this film.  It is a collection
of atrocities performed by this ill man, each one drawing a bit too much
attention to itself.</P>
<P>However, the power of the film is so shaking, so unsettling, it deserves
credit.  Martin Scorsese, with Taxi Driver, contributed to the world one
of the ugliest and scariest horror films ever.</P>
