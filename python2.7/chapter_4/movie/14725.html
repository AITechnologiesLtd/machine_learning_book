<PRE>Kissing A Fool
Review By: Ryan Davis
3/02/98</PRE>
<P>        What would happen if you best friend sleeps with your fiancée? Would
it make any difference if you asked him too? That's what this new independent
film from second time director Doug Ellin is about.</P>
<P>  Jay(Jason Lee), a depressed young writer, introduces his editor, Sam(Mili
Avital), to his best friend Max Abbott(David Schwimmer). Max and Sam hit it
off and are engages about two weeks later. Max, worried that Sam will cheat
on him, ask Jay to "test" her loyalty. Jay doesn't agree but when Max goes
out of town, Jay falls in love with Sam.</P>
<P>        The script is rather funny but the movie just doesn't fly. The actors
are believable and likable in their parts. Unfortunately the movie is just
cute and pretty entertaining but lacks originality and creativity.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
