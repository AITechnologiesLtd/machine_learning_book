<PRE>                              BRING IT ON
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     There's a point about 35 minutes into Bring It On where you
suddenly realize you're sitting in a movie theater, watching Bring It
On, wondering exactly how the hell the events in your life conspired to
put your ass in an uncomfortable movie theater seat... to watch Bring It
On.  But soon you give up, knowing there is no answer to this dilemma,
and you resign yourself to watching the next hour of Bring It On,
knowing full well that since it's a PG-13 movie, nothing scandalous is
ever going to happen to make it interesting.</P>
<P>     Going in to this movie, I knew full well it was, well, a movie
about cheerleading, so I wasn't expecting another American Beauty
(which, now that I think of it, was partly about cheerleading, but
anyway...).  Suffice it to say that my expectations were low.  And sure
enough, Bring It On is an utterly vapid film with horrendous character
development, hackneyed dialogue, and a questionable theme.  No surprise
there.  Essentially it is Fame in short skirts.</P>
<P>     The story revolves around an affluent San Diego high school and its
crack cheerleading squad, the Toros, which are led by a girl named
Torrance (Kirsten Dunst).  Torrance is picked to lead the Toros to its
sixth consecutive national cheerleading championship, but tragedy
strikes when she learns their routines have all been stolen from an East
Compton high school troupe, the Clovers, which has moves to spare. 
Eventually, of course, it comes down to Toros vs. Clovers in the
championships.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the film revolves around the Toros trying to come up
with their own moves and hiring a choreographer, an outcast cheerleader
named Missy (Eliza Dushku) who shakes things up, and a mild romance
between Torrance and Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).  While I'm
not sure if Bring It On's tepid, teen-friendly raunchiness is
titillating or disturbing, thank god for the pair of Dushku and
Bradford, who salvage this film with their anti-school-spirit tirades
and actual ability to act.  (On a side note: You will rack your brain to
figure out where you've seen these two actors before, so here are the
answers.  Dushku played Schwarzenegger's daughter in True Lies. 
Bradford played the geeky, youngest hacker Joey in Hackers.)</P>
<P>     But Kirsten Dunst?  Dunst is truly one of the best young actresses
working today and this is the material she has to work with?  Her
character comes off as an imitation of Alyson Hannigan's "Once, at band
camp..." character from American Pie.  Kirsten, you should not be in
movies like this.</P>
<P>     Nearing the finale of Bring It On, I began to fear that the message
of Bring It On was about how affluent white teenagers, if they have
enough determination, can stomp the crap out of underfunded, inner city
teenagers if they put their mind to it.  Fortunately, this is not the
case.  Bring It On is really about how a white teenage girl, if she has
enough determination, can forgo everything else in her life and just
focus on cheerleading, cheerleading, cheerleading.  Now there's a
message.</P>
