<PRE>At First Sight (1999)
Reviewed by Larry McGillicuddy 1999</PRE>
<PRE>*** (of 4)
Directed by Irwin Winkler
Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino, Kelly McGillis, Nathan Lane, Bruce 
Davison, Steven Weber</PRE>
<P>Conflict is overrated. Too many screenwriters who have based their 
work on the numerous books that teach you how to write a screenplay 
step by step feel the need to inject conflict at every possible 
moment. At First Sight is a good example of this. There are so many 
things about this film that work so well, but at times the forced 
conflict is so embarrasingly mindless it made me cringe.</P>
<P>At First Sight is based on a story by Oliver Sacks about restored 
sight. In the film, Val Kilmer plays Virgil Adamson, a man who has 
been blind since he was 3. He works as a masseuse at a vacation 
resort. This is where he bumps into architect Amy Benic (Sorvino). 
These early scenes between them are nothing short of fantastic. 
Kilmer and Sorvino have a dynamic chemistry, and the film could've 
simply focused on their romance the entire running time and be 
successful. </P>
<P>But I know that's not the only story Irwin Winkler wants to tell. 
This film is also about how a blind man copes with restored sight. 
There is nothing wrong with this, considering the early scenes here 
are also quite effective. Bruce Davison is a doctor who performs a 
surgery to help Virgil restore his sight. Virgil's first moments of 
sight are very frightening, since has has no idea what exactly he is 
looking at.</P>
<P>The moments of this story I enjoyed most dealt with Virgil attempting 
to make sense of what he is seeing. For example, he knows what an 
apple looks like, but he can't tell the difference between a real 
apple and a picture of an apple. Virgil is aided by visual therapist 
Phil Webster (Nathan Lane). Lane's performance is very good, but I 
wish there was more of his character here. I would've preferred more 
scenes of human interaction and therapy between Virgil and Phil than 
dull lectures from Bruce Davison's character.</P>
<P>But that's only a minor problem. The film's two biggest flaws are the 
introduction of two minor characters that didn't need to be in this 
story. Steven Webber plays Sorvino's ex-husband and boss. First of 
all, it's hard to beleive these two were ever married,and it's even 
harder to beleive that their breakup wouldve been amicable enough for 
her to still want to work for him. But conflict is necessary says 
these screenwriting books, and the screenplay makes the major mistake 
of presenting Webber's character as a threat to Virgil and Amy's 
romance. This guy is the most pathetic and pointless character since 
John Pankow in The Object of My Affection. Any scene he is in shakes 
the credibility of the entire film.</P>
<P>Another misconceived character comes in the form of Virgil's father. 
He left Virgil many years ago when he couldn't find a cure for his 
blindness. When he learns of Virgil's restored sight, he tries to 
arrange a meeting between them. I don't care about this. The father 
is a throwaway character who we only see in two scenes, but the film 
asks us to find the scene between them touching and sad. It's just a 
mindless way to inject more conflict for Virgil than was necessary.</P>
<P>Instead, why couldn't the film give a better subplot for Virgil's 
sister (very well played by Kelly McGillis)?. She has seemingly 
devoted her entire life to taking care of Virgil, so why not show 
scenes where she wonders about her future without Virgil? Now that 
he's with Amy, she no longer has anyone to come home to and take care 
of. Scenes like this would've been more touching than a lame father-
son reunion. The film does hint at this once, but it's quickly 
abandoned.</P>
<P>Yet once again this year, I enjoyed a film despite the appearance of 
several major flaws. If the allure of the friday night lights 
propelled Varsity Blues past it's flaws, then what works here is the 
powerful romance between Virgil and Amy. Mira Sorvino is a terrific 
actress, and this performance is among her best. She has a natural 
ability to show how much she cares for someone without even having to 
say a word. Val Kilmer abandons his usual brooding, egotistical style 
of performance and instead creates a character that he actually seems 
to care about. Virgil is sweet, funny, smart, and even infuriating. 
Kilmer is able to bring out all these traits perfectly, which is 
certainly more impressive than the simple technical task of looking 
like a blind person. Together, they have immense chemistry and are 
able to carry the entire film past even it's most gaping of flaws.</P>
