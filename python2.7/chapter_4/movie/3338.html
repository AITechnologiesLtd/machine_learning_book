<PRE>                                 HIDEAWAY
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1995 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>Directed by Brett Leonard
Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez
With Jeff Goldblum (Hatch), Christine Lahti (Lindsey),
     Alicia Silverstone (Regina), Jeremy Sisto (Vassago).</P>
<P>     This is a standard horror film, with average direction and writing
for this genre (which is to say, they aren't too great).  Production
values are pretty good; the effects, which seem familiar to me from
previews and other promotion of THE LAWNMOWER MAN are probably the
best thing technically about this film--though I this particular class
of computer effects has been used up.</P>
<P>     The role for Jeff Goldblum is weak but okay; the other actors
don't have an awful lot to do except the usual--run around and act
scared or diabolical as the case may be.</P>
<P>     The story opens nicely, with a creepy Satanic murder-suicide.
Jeff Goldblum is then in an accident and dies, experiencing special
effects oddly reminiscent of the wormhole from STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE
NINE.  When he comes back, he starts experiencing visions of violent
murders.  It took me a while to figure out what was going on--maybe I
wasn't too quick on the uptake here but I found the false leads and
their resolution pretty satisfying.</P>
<P>     Jeff Goldblum spends quite a bit of time trying to figure out
what's going on.  Most of this time he doesn't have much to do but sit
around and look puzzled, have visions, scribble, or make phone calls to
the police.  Given this limitation, he's pretty successful at making
this part of the film fun to watch.  I don't know how many times he has
to act like he's seeing something elsewhere which leads him to some
great insight--but each time he manages to do it a little differently.
This shows how a good actor can help save a film with weak writing.</P>
<P>     Jeremy Sisto has a nice greasy creepiness to him; he brings
something extra to his role, and is fun to watch.  I can see him quite
easily as every (horror movie) father's greatest fear; the nice-looking
young man his daughter brings home who sees the girl not as a work of
art, but as raw materials.</P>
<P>     I would have liked this film a lot better if it has been a little
more campy.  The scene at the end, with the appearance of the younger
daughter, would have been enhanced a hell of a lot if when we see
Alicia Silverstone's face she was allowed to roll her eyes a little
("They're *still* thinking about her!  What, am I invisible?")  If
you're making a film like this, and you can't make it really good, try
to make it really fun.  All the raw materials were there (silly father,
roller coaster, shotgun, etc.)</P>
<P>     All in all I'd give this film a B for the good acting of Jeff
Goldblum and Jeremy Sisto and the okay special effects.  If you really
enjoy this sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy this one; but I
wouldn't go expecting to be scared or intrigued much.</P>
