<PRE>THE BIG HIT
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The Big Hit is a ridiculous ultraviolent action spoof.  It does not take
itself seriously, and neither should you.  It's not the typical
action-comedy, but once you get adjusted to its unique rhythms, it
becomes a hilarious satire.</P>
<P>Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg) is a really nice guy.  He just wants
people to like him.  The trouble is, he's a hitman.  He's good at what
he does, but his job leaves him with ulcers.  To show what a nice guy he
is, he's always giving money away.  Two women are taking advantage of
this human ATM: Melvin's fiancee Pam (Christina Applegate), and his
girlfriend Chantel (Lela Rochon).  Melvin would break up with them...but
he thinks they might not like him anymore if he did that.</P>
<P>Another person who takes advantage of Melvin's generosity is Cisco (Lou
Diamond Phillips).  Melvin and Cisco both work as hitmen for Paris
(Avery Brooks), but Melvin typically does all the work (Cisco just grabs
the paychecks). When Cisco comes up with a money-making scheme, he knows
just the guy to help him out: Melvin.</P>
<P>The two of them, along with Crunch (Bokeem Woodbine) and Gump (Robin
Dunne), plan to kidnap Keiko Nishi (China Chow), the daughter of
billionaire Jiro Nishi(Sab Shimono).  But unforeseen complications ensue
which will turn the kidnappers against one another.</P>
<P>If this sounds the slightest bit serious to you, ignore it.  The film is
a complete and absolute spoof.  If you go in expecting a straightforward
action pic (or even an action-comedy), you'll be tremendously
disappointed.</P>
<P>That's not to say that there's not any action in the film.  Director
Kirk Wong delivers several fine action pieces that, although played
firmly tongue-in-cheek, are very thrilling.  However, they are
subservient to the comedy (rather than the other way around). People
expecting a Hong Kong style action-fest are heading for a letdown.</P>
<P>The comedy in the film doesn't aim very high.  It's just a step-or-two
away from the Airplane style of parody.  But there are plenty of funny
moments, mostly character based.  Crunch's self-love affair, Cisco's
stereotypical boat dream, and Marvin's video-store battles are still
bringing me chuckles.</P>
<P>The film does have its failings.  The characters of Pam's parents
(Elliott Gould and Lainie Kazan) aren't nearly as funny as they try to
be. And there are several moments when the dialogue in the film
unintentionally crosses the boundary between bad-funny and bad-bad.</P>
<P>But, for the most part, The Big Hit is humorous when it counts.  Again,
I caution that you must be in the right frame of mind when seeing this
film.  But if you are, you should find it hilarious.</P>
