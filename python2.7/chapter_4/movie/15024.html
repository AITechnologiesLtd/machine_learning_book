<P>Director Jonathan Demme's vision of slavery and the memories contained
in its after life in 'Beloved', based on Toni Morrison's novel are
haunting to say the least.  Demme is a brilliant director.  I'm hard
pressed to find a more chilling example of intense psychological drama
when I think about the confrontation between Hannibal Lecter and Dr.
Chilton in 1991's 'The Silence of the Lambs' when Lecter focuses on the
doctor's pen as a tool in part to release himself from handcuffs later
in the film.  The way the camera followed Lecter's expression cutting
back and fourth from his face to the pen was so simple that it was hard
to believe.  Demme uses some of his psychological tricks in a similar
and unsettling way in his latest film.</P>
<P>In 'Beloved', Oprah Winfrey portrays Sethe, a former slave from a
Kentucky plantation who is now living on the outskirts of Cincinnati,
Ohio in 1865.  As the film opens, we are shown the full blooded makings
of what is in part is a ghost story.  The events are open to individual
interpretation.  Is the tiny farm house owned by Sethe actually haunted
or is it the horrible memories in the mind of a former slave brought up
from time to time?  At least that's the way I saw it.  Eight years
pass.  It is now 1873.  Sethe lives with her daughter Denver (Kimberly
Elise) and one calm afternoon, Paul D (Danny Glover) shows up and
rekindles his memories of the past (he is also a former slave) with
Sethe.  The two of them worked together on the same plantation and they
discuss events and realize that it's been 18 years since they last saw
each other.</P>
<P>Paul D moves in with the family and adjusts to the day to day life with
Sethe and Denver.  One day, after returning from a town carnival, the
three of them find a destitute young woman (Thandie Newton) who appears
to suffer from mental instability and sheer psychological trauma.  She
says her name is Beloved, and is taken in by the family.  For the
benefit of those of you who don't want the film spoiled, I will not
explain much more about the relationship between Beloved and the rest of
the family except to say that the outcome of her presence in the film
will leave you open to interpret it in your own way, much in the same
way the ghost story overtones are open to the same individual
interpretation early in the film.</P>
<P>Like any good story that gives meaning to the purpose of its characters,
'Beloved' takes movie audiences on a journey to the past and gives its
story a hard-core amount of depth with memories of the past from its
main characters, detailing the torturous aspects of slavery as one of
the most terrible historical events in human history.  It's story hasn't
been told enough and while this film does examine its aspects only in
flashbacks, it is an ample amount of education without being over done.</P>
<P>The performances in 'Beloved' are exceptionally strong and sympathetic
in and of themselves without robbing the characters brought to life of
what pride and dignity remain in their lives without being overly
sentimental.  Oprah Winfrey's performance IS the best one so far in 1998
by an actress and although Danny Glover is clearly seen in this film as
a supporting actor, I hope he earns a long deserved Oscar nomination for
his work on this film and Winfrey will enjoy her second Oscar nomination
if nominated for this film.  Her last Oscar nomination came in 1985 for
Best Supporting Actress in 'The Color Purple'.</P>
<P>Unsettling?  Yes.  Weepy and sentimental?  No.  Intelligent and
inspiring?  Definitely.  Those in search of light entertainment:
beware.  'Beloved' will stay in your memory for days after you see it
and isn't for those who like to forget about a movie a couple of hours
after they've witnessed it.  Oscar nominations are coming.</P>
