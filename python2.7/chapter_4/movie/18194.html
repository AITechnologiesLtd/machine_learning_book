<P>_The_Mummy_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Well, it seemed like a good idea: a lavish, big-budget retelling of the
1932 horror classic _The_Mummy_.  But after seeing the finished product as
written and directed by Stephen Sommers (who last perpetrated the undersea
howler _Deep_Rising_) one would be wise to heed one of its trailer's tag
words: "Beware."</P>
<P>To his credit, Sommers makes his _Mummy_ a different type of animal from
its precursor.  Instead of a traditional horror piece, this _Mummy_ is more
of an adventure film, with our central trio--American adventurer Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), British librarian Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel
Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah)--trying to unlock the
secrets of a legendary lost burial site in 1930s Egypt.  Once there, they
and a rival group of explorers--who are in the hunt for some buried
treasure--end up uncovering something more than they bargained for: the
awakened mummy of the ancient High-priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who is
determined to bring himself and his lost love back to full life.</P>
<P>What Sommers is clearly after is the rollicking roller coaster vibe of the
_Indiana_Jones_ films, but one little detail is lost on him.  While the
_Indy_ flicks were in the light, jaunty vein of old serial films, Steven
Spielberg knew that the tongue could and should not always be kept in
cheek.  The scary parts were indeed scary; the suspenseful moments were
taken seriously.  The same cannot be said of _The_Mummy_, which wears a
silly, jokey attitude throughout and suffers for it.  How can one truly be
frightened or intimidated by Imhotep and his murderous rage when each
would-be shock is blunted by an idiotic wisecrack (which _every_ character
seems have ready) or slapsticky situation?</P>
<P>It would also help if the creature's appearance were scary or at least
creepy; unless you lose sleep over the Cryptkeeper from
_Tales_from_the_Crypt_, likely the sight of the mummified Imhotep won't
invade even a daydream.  In fact, with the exception of some impressive
visuals involving the movement of sand, the effects work in _The_Mummy_ is
strangely unconvincing.  The walking undead and deadly Scarab beetles look
like they never left the computer screen, and the opening shot--showing a
giant sphinx and pyramids as workers and others scurry by--is no more
lifelike than the nearly identical opening shot of _The_Prince_of_Egypt_.</P>
<P>Not that the flesh-and-blood actors are themselves give the film much
life, either.  Fraser has proven to be a terrific actor in small films as
diverse as the romantic fantasy _Still_Breathing_ to last fall's
Oscar-winning _Gods_and_Monsters_, but when it comes to big time popcorn
films, he always falls flat, to say the least.  First it was his painfully
broad turn in the unwatchable _George_of_the_Jungle_; now it's this
half-hearted attempt to channel Harrison Ford's roguish charm.  More
successful at evoking _Indiana_Jones_ is Weisz, but in the wrong way: her
Evelyn is only a notch less shrill than Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott
(_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_), easily the worst heroine in the
_Indy_ series.</P>
<P>_The_Mummy_ definitely does not bore; it holds one's attention for its
entire running time, and the millions of its megabudget do show up on
screen.  But shouldn't an adventure film at least offer something
resembling excitement?</P>
