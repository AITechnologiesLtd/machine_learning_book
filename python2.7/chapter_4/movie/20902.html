<PRE>Tarantino Envy
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>When I first saw the poster for this film, I thought "it's a spoof on
'Reservoir Dogs'." I wasn't too far off, it certainly shares that Tarantino
genre. Though, it's not a spoof -- unless you think "Reservoir Dogs" is a
spoof on "bad guy" films.</P>
<P>I suspect you'll enjoy this picture if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, or
even harsh action films like "Ronin." If you're not familiar with Tarantino,
this is what you can expect: An ugly real violence contrasted with gangster
goof-ups. Rat packs of hoodlum and hoodlum wannabes that fumble through a
gritty underworld maze surprising each other at the turns and exhausting
many a cartridge of bullets. Lots of dead guys.</P>
<P>This is a British film with four teams of shady characters, a thug and his
son, and Sting (as the involuntarily involved bartender). That's a lot of
bad guys, so it takes a while to introduce them all, making the first part
of the film rather uneventful and dry. The ball gets rolling near the middle
of the picture and picks up speed at a steadily increasing rate right up to
the credits. The twists and turns are well set up, yet unexpected and fun --
really fun.</P>
<P>Lastly, the picture sports some unique cinematographic sequences (utilizing,
super-slow-mo, stop-action, etc.) spicing up the presentation and
maintaining a light-hearted perspective despite the blood.</P>
<P>Starring Jason Flemying and Nick Moran.
Written and directed by Guy Ritchie.
Produced by Matthew Vaughn via Polygram released at Gramercy.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
