<PRE>Dudley Do-Right (PG) No Stars
Starring Brendan Fraser, Alfred Molina
Directed by Hugh Wilson
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There are many types of children's films. Some are designed to entertain the
parent while enchanting the child as well, some are targeted straight for the
kiddies and avoid any chance of good entertainment for adults, and there are
some (much like Dudley Do-Right) that manage to turn off both groups because
it's incredibly bad. Sticking straighter to the formula than I thought
possible, Brendan Fraser returns as a 60s cartoon character in the worst remake
of the year.</P>
<P>Dudley (Fraser) has always dreamed of being a Canadian Mountie, the dim-witted
fellow finally gets his wish and begins to govern the sweet mountain town of
Semi-Happy Valley. When Snidley Whiplash (Molina) decides to dump gold that he
stole from a bank, into the town stream and declare a gold rush to help bring
profit to the town, Dudley must step forward and save the day. It's also a
quest for his true love, somehow Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) has fallen into
the wrong man's arms and it's Dudley's duty to save her.</P>
<P>Confused as Whiplash changes his role from good guy to bad guy (?) Dudley turns
into a bad guy because as the narrator points out, good guys can do bad things
to capture bad people (?.) It all leads to a final showdown between the
Mounties and the Whiplash bunch.</P>
<P>First of all, the film as a star vehicle for Brendan Fraser does not work. Both
him and Sarah Jessica Parker have less screen time than Snidley Whiplash
combined and Dudley says no more than 200 words. The narrator is also annoying,
constantly interacting with the characters (ala George of the Jungle anyone?)
and making stupid comments. The film also manages to be flat out not funny,
none of the jokes made even the nine year old with her Beanie Babies next to me
laugh. Now I could go on and on about how America is being shoveled this
mainstream trash and how the public eats it up, but I'll save some time for us
all by giving Dudley Do-Right no stars whatsoever.</P>
<P>ADDITIONAL NOTE: There is one portion of the film, 8 seconds to be exact that
contains a joke worth seeing, I will now save you the $7.50 admission ticket:
"Scientists report today that Canadian bacon is actually ham."  </P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film is aimed right at kids and contains mild language and
some bare male chests. Good Age: 5-11</P>
