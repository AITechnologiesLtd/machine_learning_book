<P>I once watched a film teacher suffer a meltdown after a
classroom screening of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. LAST HOUSE
was Wes Craven's debut feature, an exruciatingly graphic
rape-revenge film shot almost documentary-style in 16mm, and
something about it was more than our instructor could bear.
As the lights came up, he stalked to the front of the
classroom muttering that he didn't think anybody should be
allowed to watch such a pernicious film. This was the
first-ever convincing argument, he said, in favor of
censorship. He threw around words like "inept" and "artless,"
and the students in the class were put in the uncomfortable
position of having to defend the merit of some of the most
sadistic instances of humiliating sexual violence ever
committed to celluloid.</P>
<P>"Did you know it was based on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN
SPRING?" I finally asked. Stopped him right in his tracks. He
stood up there for a few long moments, scratching his chin,
wondering if it could possibly be so -- could this vile,
torturous excuse for cinema actually have been inspired by
the much revered work of one of Europe's greatest filmmakers?
And more importantly, was the director a lot smarter than he
had been willing to give him credit for?</P>
<P>Since then, Wes Craven has gone on to more auspicious
projects, including THE HILLS HAVE EYES as well as the first
and last movies in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, an
uncommonly imaginative knock-off from the slasher boom of the
late 70s and early 80s. The series went downhill as it
converted Craven's genuinely creepy Freddy Krueger character
into a stand-up comic, and one of the characters in Craven's
newest movie, SCREAM, comments on that: "They all sucked,
except the first one."</P>
<P>Craven is a filmmaker of ideas, but he's not entirely
successful at bringing those ideas to fruition. Still, his
movies are consistently more interesting than their
mainstream Hollywood counterparts. THE PEOPLE UNDER THE
STAIRS is an elaborate metaphor for the class struggle in
Reagan's America, complete with Ron and Nancy surrogates. His
SHOCKER was a misfire, a heavy metal slasher movie that was
aimed perhaps a little too narrowly at its target audience --
but who would guess that Craven would make his points about
the pervasiveness of television as our new fantasy realm by
directly referencing Buster Keaton's SHERLOCK JR.?</P>
<P>Television plays a big role in SCREAM, as well. In the
brilliantly conceived opening sequence, cute-as-a-button
Casey (Drew Barrymore) gets a distasteful phone call from a
psycho who wants to play games with her. When she asks why he
wants to know her name, he tells her it's because he wants to
know who he's looking at. When she asks what he wants, he
tells her he wants to see what her insides look like. Reduced
to a quivering wreck, Casey cowers in the corner, next to a
TV screen that glows blue from its blank video signal. Later
in the movie, a bunch of drunk high schoolers will gather
around another TV set to watch HALLOWEEN, and that movie's
electronic soundtrack will become SCREAM's background music.</P>
<P>Craven is interested in the contrast between movie reality
and objective reality -- or at least reality as it appears in
his movie as compared to the reality that appears in everyone
else's movies. You follow? The chief conceit of SCREAM is
that it knows it's a scary movie, and its characters -- at
least the smart ones -- are keenly aware of the conventions
that make scary movies such a predicament for the people
caught in them.</P>
<P>So Neve Campbell (she was in THE CRAFT, and a TV series
called Party of Five) plays Sidney as a more savvy version of
the prototypical babe-in-distress. Like her pal Tatum (the
terrific Rose McGowan from THE DOOM GENERATION), she can run
verbal circles around her male counterparts, but may be a
little too headstrong for her own good. The movie begins in
the wake of Casey's death, and the local high-schoolers
aren't exactly shedding tears over her grave. These kids are
into gallows humor and gossipy speculation on the identity of
the real killer, who wears an elongated death's head mask
that becomes a hot item for pranksters at the local high
school. So many of the people in this community are so
twisted that it seems any one of them could be the killer. In
fact, the screenplay is gleefully peppered with clues that
could implicate nearly every character in the movie.</P>
<P>Sidney's father is leaving town for the weekend, which means
that she'll be at home alone -- her mother was murdered in
gruesome fashion just a year ago. Sidney's cellular-phone-toting
boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich, also in THE CRAFT) has a
bad habit of climbing in through her bedroom window, and
becomes a prime suspect in Casey's murder. Sidney is getting
phone calls from the same creep who rang Casey, and they're
starting to carry the uncomfortable echo of her mother's
murder. The TV-ready Courteney Cox is aptly cast as a
uniquitous reporter from a tabloid program, and David
Arquette plays the awkward Sheriff's deputy who may have
something to hide. Also involved is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), a
nerdy video store clerk who lectures his peers on how to
survive a horror movie (don't have sex, don't do drugs, never
say "I'll be right back").</P>
<P>Craven's main triumph here is proving that plausibility
needn't have anything to do with effective filmmaking --
SCREAM made me jump in my seat more effectively than just
about anything since THE EVIL DEAD. Here's a movie where the
killer stalks victims through the grocery store in full
Halloween regalia, where a video camera broadcasts images
into a news truck on a 30-second delay (what, they're waiting
for the picture to bounce back off the satellite?). It's a
big bloody crowd-pleaser, and a treat for thoughtful fans of
the genre. Knowing references to the genre include a
discussion of Jamie Lee Curtis's breasts and the cameo
appearance of Craven himself as a school janitor in Freddy
Krueger clothing. But when Tatum makes passing reference to
"something out of a Wes Carpenter movie," it really is one
wink too many.</P>
<P>What's more remarkable than the labored reflexivity is
Craven's reconstruction of a nearly picture-perfect slasher
movie with some important twists. (A year ago, he thought he
had contracted with Miramax to remake THE HAUNTING, but plans
went awry.) SCREAM has a casual feeling about it, almost like
something done on a lark. He's angling to create something
akin to the conceptually audacious WES CRAVEN'S NEW
NIGHTMARE, which was a fairly sober meditation on why we need
horror stories (and one of his most engaging films). Still,
SCREAM ultimately disappoints because what's missing from
this "scary movie" is a sense of what's really scary. If
SCREAM had even one truly horrifying moment, a scene that
made you shudder instead of just jolting your ass out of your
chair one more time, it might carry a little more weight. As
is, it's simply the slasher movie to end all slasher movies
-- too bad it comes about 10 years too late.</P>
<P>As always, Craven's reach exceeds his grasp. The film is shot
in anamorphic Panavision, but unlike his compatriot John
Carpenter, Craven has no real sense for how to use the
widescreen frame. The screenplay (by first-timer Kevin
Williamson) has too many clever ideas that never really pan
out. The constant references to HALLOWEEN in particular are
more hamfisted homage than plot device, and the
aforementioned video camera gimmick is wasted. And while the
movie is smart as a whip about the conventions of horror
movies, it's conspicuously silent on the subject of what
drives them, or why we enjoy them.</P>
<P>Finally, I'm not sure what we're supposed to make of the
delirious final reels, in which the killer explains, against
all apparent evidence to the contrary, that "Movies don't
create psychos; they just make psychos more creative." Good
point, but are we expected to take a psycho's word for it?
And why is a television literally instrumental in one
character's death? Never mind -- it's all so fast and fun
that you barely have time to wonder at such stuff. Strap in
and enjoy the ride.<HR>--
