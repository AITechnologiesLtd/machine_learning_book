<P>The lottery is an absolute hot-bed of comedic possibilities and
unsurprisingly there've been a few films take advantage of this. The latest
is Waking Ned in which the golden finger of fate pokes decisively at an old
age pensioner in a small Irish village who then celebrates by promptly
dropping dead.</P>
<P>Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) discovers that lady luck has selected one of
Tullymore's 52 inhabitants and  sets off on a personal quest to find out
exactly who it is. His bullish investigations soon lead to the conclusion
that the winner must be Ned Devine. But Ned's unlikely to be spending any of
his windfall because Ned - no not Zed, Ned - is dead. And with Lottery rep
Jim Kelly (Brendan F. Dempsey) on the way, the claim will die with him
unless Jackie and best mate Michael played by David Kelly of Robin's Nest
fame (he was the one armed waiter) can pull enough of a fast one to convince
the lottery rep and the town that the winning ticket belongs to them.</P>
<P>The cast is wonderfully unstarry and quite frankly, that makes the movie.
Originally Kirk Jones received offers from Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon to
play the parts of the Irish penny-pinching duo but Jones turned them down
and chose Dempsey and Kelly instead - both small screen heroes of his. The
decision to turn down Hollywood big bucks and big names was a brave one.
Reviewers in the states may be more than willing to bad mouth their native
city's stars but when an outsider chooses to shun those same stars a strange
patriotism emerges. As a result there are fears Waking Ned won't do as well
in the States as it most certainly will over here in the UK.</P>
<P>Watching the film you can't help but think of the Full Monty. Kirk Jones
saturates the story with charming subplots and quirky humour while keeping
the level of sentimentality in check throughout. There are daft moments and
hilarious moments but never unrealistic or plot-pandering moments that might
otherwise wreck the whole thing. Bannen and Kelly hurl themselves into their
parts with the vigour and enthusiasm of two British talents left out of the
picture for far too long, and whether skinny-dipping at a picturesque cove
or steaming along naked on a motorbike, they never fail to raise a laugh.</P>
<P>As much a testament to the two likeable old coots who've proved you don't
need to be under 30 to be an excellent British actor, this film is an
exemplification of Kirk Jones' comendable love for homegrown talent,
location and movie-making which should, at the very least, earn him a BAFTA.</P>
