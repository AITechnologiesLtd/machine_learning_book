Spielberg; based on the novel by Michael Crichton.</P>
<P>Seen November 29, 1997 on home video (rented).</P>
<P>They say when you've got a winning strategy don't change your game plan.
That's good advice, unfortunately the one place it doesn't work is Hollywood,
or else "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" might have been something original.
Instead, it's just a repeat of everything Spielberg's done before and proves
some things are only impressive once.</P>
<P>The film opens in typical Spielberg fashion with a supposedly charming scene
that also shows the advances made in special effects. Initially, it is
interesting to watch, but within a few minutes we get a lot of screaming and
off-screen bloodshed, and it's apparent the film is going to be much like the
original "Jurassic Park."</P>
<P>That feeling of deja vu continues to manifest itself as the story unfolds
much like another mediocre sci-fi thriller, "Aliens." We catch up with Dr.
Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), who has apparently been shunned from the scientific
community for "telling stories" about what happened on that South American
island four years ago. He visits Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), the
owner and curator of the park who tells him there is another island full of
dinosaurs which he is in danger of losing to either the government or
poachers (I couldn't really tell from all the jargon). He wants Malcolm,
along with palentologist Dr. Sarah Harding (who just happens to be Malcolm's
girlfriend), and photographer Nick Van Owen (Vaughn), to go there and make
sure the park is stable. Of course Malcolm panics when he realizes Harding is
already down there, and agrees to go "rescue" her.</P>
<P>It's not surprising how quickly the opening act is paced. This film is meant
to be a special effects thrill ride, so it doesn't want to waste anyone's
time with a story (God forbid!). Only the bare essentials are necessary, such
as Hammond's arrogant newphew Peter Ludlow (Howard), who constantly berates
Malcolm, or the fact Malcolm is a bad father to his adopted daughter. The
dialogue between these character is trite and blatantly foreshadowing. All
the characters are generic, and thus Goldblum sticks out like a sore thumb
since he's the only character with depth.</P>
<P>Once the main characters reach the dinosaur island the film practically
becomes a remake of the original. We get many shots of dinosaurs roaming the
island which are impressive visually, but almost boring intellectually
because of the bland story. It's no surprise that once a team of hunters
invade the island all Hell breaks lose and the film becomes a 100-minute
chase scene. We get another scene of the dinosaurs pushing a vehicle off a
cliff with our characters inside dangling by a thread. There's more
hide-and-seek scenes with those nasty raptors, who are conviently delt with
by the daughter's gymnastics talent. And of course the brave, mighty hunters
turn into cowards and many are eaten as they flee.</P>
<P>But the film's problem isn't just the fact it repeats itself (and its
predecessor), it's the way it does so. There is no sense of satire here,
which means the film wants to be taken seriously, which is hard to do
considering how corny and contrived the screenplay is. It often wanders from
the main characters for large blocks of time just to show other people be
eaten by the dinosaurs (which is just an excuse to dodge the story and show
off the effects). Not to mention how badly it over-doses on the cliffhangers.</P>
<P>The last act somehow shifts the setting to San Diego and much like a modern
"Godzilla," we get a T-Rex wreaking havoc there. Not surprisingly, the ending
isn't quite resolved which could (and probably will) leave room for another
sequel.</P>
<P>It seems like "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" was meant to be a genuine,
intense thriller, but it's too ridiculous to take seriously. </P>
