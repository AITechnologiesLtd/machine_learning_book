FORBIDDEN PLANET
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the most widespread forms of amusement among movie fans is
"Kevin Bacon game" - connecting various, often quite different, films
based on the actors who appeared in them. Movie fans who like to
explore the essence of films play another kind of "Kevin Bacon game" -
connecting various films based on ideas or characters that appeared in
them. One of the most spectacular of such sequences, in which we can
trace the original ideas centuries back, is the sequence that begins
with William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST and ends with STAR TREK. There
is an important link between 16th Century play and 20th Century cult
SF-series, and that link happens to be SF-film with the cult following
of its own. This film is FORBIDDEN PLANET, 1956 space opera directed
by Fred M. Wilcox.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is set in 22nd Century. Starship is sent from
Earth to solar system of Altair. Captain J.J. Adams (played by Leslie
Nielsen) has the task to investigate apparent lack of communication
with scientific colony that had settled on its fourth planet two
decades ago. When the ship approaches the planet, the expedition
receives warning by Doctor Morbius (played by Walter Pidgeon), the
only remaining member of the expedition. He claims that he doesn't
need outside help and that the starship should leave. Adams
nevertheless orders the landing and his expedition is greeted by
strange, exotic, yet barren world. The only thing that stands out are
structures inhabited by Doctor Morbius, his young daughter Altaira
(played by Annie Francis) and exotic household appliance called
"Robbie the Robot". Morbius reluctantly agrees to help Adams in his
investigation, explaining that all the members of his expedition, with
exception of his family, succumbed to mysterious force which caused
very violent and messy deaths. Stranded on the barren planet, Morbius
had begun to explore its underground and found ruins of mighty and
ultra-developed civilisation of Krell, people who mysteriously
perished centuries ago. Their superior technology persevered, allowing
Morbius to create many technological wonders, including "Robbie",
despite his lack of formal engineering skills. While some members of
the starship crew are intrigued by this finding, most of them are
aroused by attractive yet sexually inexperienced Altaira, including
Captain Adams. However, after a while, Adams would find that this
bizarre planet has lifeforms different from Morbius family and more
inimical to his ship and crew.</P>
<P>At first glance, FORBIDDEN PLANET looks like an embodiment of
everything that is bad about Hollywood's 1950s science fiction. The
predictions of future are laughable, starships look like flying
saucers, their crews are made entirely out of white males who speak
with American accent. Comic relief in the form of Cookie (played by
Earl Holliman) is an incarnation of all cliches of the period. "Robbie
the Robot", on the other hand, doesn't just look obsolete - he looks
like too obvious attempt by producers to attract juvenile audience,
and, compared to this, Lucas and Spielberg look like masters of
subtlety. Even on purely technical level director Wilcox manages to
shoot himself in the foot when one shot during Altaira's
skinny-dipping scene reveals Annie Frances wearing swimsuit. However,
despite these flaws, FORBIDDEN PLANET is considered one of the most
important science fiction films ever made.</P>
<P>The importance of FORBIDDEN PLANET is in the influence it had on
numerous filmmakers till this day, mostly in the form of basic plot.
That speaks a lot of about ingenuity and intelligence of screenwriter
Cyril Hume, who, unlike many other SF writers, didn't use the premise
as a simple excuse for standard action/horror plot, but actually built
the real, intriguing story on it and led it to its logical and
effective conclusion. Thanks to that, even the viewers who are
accustomed to CGI graphics, different standards of sex, violence and
language would actually appreciate this film. Despite antiquated
special effects, slow rhythm, old-fashioned morality of the
characters, FORBIDDEN PLANET doesn't insult viewer's intelligence. It
is exactly what is supposed to be - a science fiction film from
beginning to the end.</P>
<P>Even on technical levels, FORBIDDEN PLANET is successful film. Special
effects were best of its age, and even today some of the scenes might
impress the viewers. There was even some room for experimenting, and
musical of Bebe and Louis Barron is the very first example of
completely electronic soundtrack for Hollywood feature film. This
experiment resulted in eerie, surreal atmosphere that seems quite
appropriate for the film. Although the actors in this film don't
usually belong to Hollywood major league, they do quite a decent job.
That includes young Leslie Nielsen of comedic POLICE SQUAD fame as
starship captain, and despite his usual deadpan delivery, this non-
comic role is rather impressive; "trekkies" wouldn't have much trouble
seeing shades of proto-Kirk in Nielsen's version of Adams. On the
other hand, Walter Pidgeon is also quite effective as Morbius, and
Anne Francis as his attractive daughter delivers seductive combination
of sexuality and childlike innocence. Hume's dialogue, despite some
usual cliches, has enough room for some rather entertaining double
entendres.</P>
<P>All in all, FORBIDDEN PLANET, even after almost half of century, is
not only important but very entertaining and intelligent piece of
science fiction cinema and it should be recommended to all fans of
that particular genre.</P>
