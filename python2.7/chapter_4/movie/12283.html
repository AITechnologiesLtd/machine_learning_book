<P>John Woo, who is credited with plenty of action films in his twenty-five
years in the motion picture industry, has a certain style of filmmaking
that no matter how intense the direction is, it cannot be escaped.
Similar to The Replacement Killers, another John Woo-produced/somebody
else-directed action film (surprisingly about another hit man with a
conscience), The Big Hit has an intensity and an off-the-cuff feel that
reeks of John Woo. While this in itself is no problem, Director Kirk
Wong feels the need to fight this Woo-ness, and instead of succumbing to
the style of that particular filmmaker he tries to stretch his product
into something else. Needless to say, that something else isn't as good. </P>
<P>The closest comparison to that something else is 1997's Grosse Pointe
Blank (yet another hit man with a conscience), but that outstandingly
comical film had a far more grown-up feel to it. Similarly, John Woo's
most enjoyable films (Broken Arrow and Face/Off) retained a certain
amount of maturity no matter what the tempo was. However, The Big Hit
extends itself far beyond any barriers and is content to give the viewer
some shoot-'em-up silliness. One of the running jokes in the movie is
that the main character has an overdue rental of King Kong Lives, and
even as buildings are exploding around him he risks life and limb to
save the tape. </P>
<P>The main character is Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg), whose role is as
unlikely as his name. A hit man who can't stand the idea of anyone not
liking him, he falls prey to his girlfriend's and his fianceé's requests
for money. And of course, as a very good hit man, he's got lots of money
to give. So even though he makes thousands, he's close to broke, and to
remedy his situation he goes on a rogue assignment with fellow hit men
Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips) and Crunch (Bokeem Woobine). Unfortunately,
the kidnappee (China Chow) for this particular job is the goddaughter of
Paris (Avery Brooks), Melvin's boss. Infuriated at the transgression,
Paris calls in Cisco to question him of his knowledge of the job, and in
looking for the easy way out, Cisco pins it on Melvin. </P>
<P>None of the actors are particularly outstanding, save the possibilities
of the bossy Phillips (Courage Under Fire) and the sensual Chow. Avery
Brooks, whose role on TV's Deep Space Nine usually gives him quite a lot
of gravity, is pawned off as a tightly wound lunatic who kills at will.
The hangdog likes of Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights) can't sustain their
novelty, and soon his acting is just as bad as the pacing. The movie's
only high points are the take-no-prisoners action sequence at the
beginning, and then the extended explosiveness of the finale. Other than
that, the dry humor and the general wasted feel of the movie doesn't
lend itself to anything great. Worth a look, but perhaps not for all
types.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "THE BIG HIT": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
