<PRE>FRENCH TWIST (1995)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Josiane Balasko
Writers: Patrick Aubrée and Josiane Balasko (story by Telsche Borman)
Starring: Victoria Abril, Josiane Balasko, Alain Chabat, Ticky Holgado,
Miguel Bosé</P>
<P>Contrary to popular belief, not every single foregin film released to an
American market is a masterpiece.  Some of them aren't even GOOD.  Some
examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful "Un indien dans
la ville" (presented as "Little Indian, Big City," and remade into that
crap Tim Allen flick, "Jungle2Jungle"), and this.  What could have been
a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick.</P>
<P>"French Twist" (the "cool" American title, not the real one, which was
"Gazon Maudit," literally meaning "twisted ground," or something like
that) deals with a married couple with kids, and the intrusion of a
stranger who kinda screws things up for them.  Loli and Alain Chabat
(Victoria Abril and Alain Chabat) are not exactly happily married. 
Always on business trips, Alain Chabat more than once cheats on her, and
she eventually finds out.  And one day, she meets a butch mechanic,
Marijo (the co-writer/director Josiane Balasko), and they two kinda hit
it off.  So she decides she will get back at Alain Chabat by doing the
obvious: sleeping with Marijo.</P>
<P>But she soons starts to not only fall in love with Marijo, but she's
also realizes she's still in love with Alain Chabat.  So, of course, she
does the obvious from that: she decides to keep them both.  She'll be
(and sleep) with each of them for 3 days each, then on Sunday, she'll
rest by herself.  After all, she needs it if she's gonna have more sex
than Sylvia Kristel.</P>
<P>The film goes on for over an hour and a half, through stupidity after
stupidity, moronic twist after moronic twist, and soon there's the
little ironic (!!!) ending.  I know it's a completely different culture,
and I'm quite familiar with the French and their cinema, but this is
just BAD.  None of the characters are more intelligent than Peter
Stormare in "Fargo" (a movie where stupid characters were backed up to
make a point), and any action they do is pretty much just to get a
hopeful chuckle from the audience.  What's shocking is this was not only
one of France's biggest hits, but it was nominated for a lot of Cesars
(French equivalent of Oscars).</P>
<P>The writing and directing is really the big problem with it.  Josiane
Balasko does a good acting job with her role, but her little sex comedy
isn't very humerous, entertaining, or even deep at all.  Even Woody
Allen's not-very-good "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy" is intelligent,
well-written, and possesses some depth.  This is shallow, unfunny, and
pretty annoying to watch.  The film moves at the pace of a snail, and is
damn-near painful to watch.  Thank god for the fast forward button.</P>
<P>The acting, however, isn't bad at all.  The actors do the best they can
with the bad material, and Victoria Abril is pretty likable despite the
script (and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself
over two people when she has kids).  And Alain Chabat has some funny
moments as the neurotic husband.</P>
<P>But "French Twist" is just pretty lame.  It's not overly horrible, and
has a couple very, very, very brief moments.  But it's just a really
crap film, and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign
film.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): *1/2</PRE>
