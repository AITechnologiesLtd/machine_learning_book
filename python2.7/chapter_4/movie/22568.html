 The Cider House Rules (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Tobey
Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Kathy
Baker and Jane Alexander. </P>
<P> One young man's search for self-discovery is the main focus of "The
Cider House Rules", a literate and moving adaptation of John Irving's
best-selling novel.</P>
<P> The movie, featuring a screenplay by Irving, tells of the journey of
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan groomed by kindly old doctor
Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) to be his successor.</P>
<P> Larch is a warm-hearted but practical physician who helps women in
trouble either by finding homes for their babies after delivering them,
or performing abortions if the women so desire.</P>
<P> The movie is set in New Hampshire during the years of World War II, so
Larch's activities, though humanitarian, are illegal.</P>
<P> Homer learns medicine from Larch, and while Homer does not mind
delivering babies, he will not perform abortions.</P>
<P> Having spent most of his life at St. Cloud's orphanage, Homer decides
to see what it is like in the outside world, after meeting Wally
Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), who has
come to Larch to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.</P>
<P> Homer leaves with the pair, going to work picking apples on a farm
owned by Worthington's family, while Rudd - who is in the Army Air Corps
- returns to duty flying missions in Asia.</P>
<P> Homer learns more than he bargained for in the outside world. He
discovers love, betrayal, heartache and dark secrets he never imagined
were possible.</P>
<P> Maguire gives a finely honed performance as Homer as he combines
worldliness learned through his years of assisting Larch, and naiveté -
his ignorance of the levels to which people can fall.</P>
<P> It is Maguire's most fully developed characterization to date.</P>
<P> Caine is magnificent as the pragmatic, yet idealistic Larch. He is a
kindly, caring man who refuses to judge others. His only desire is to
help people, even if he must use illegal means to do so.</P>
<P> Delroy Lindo adds another notch to his already sterling resume as Mr.
Rose, the leader of the migrant workers who befriends Homer and teaches
him not only about picking apples, but about the outside world.</P>
<P> Mr. Rose is a man with a terrible, dark secret, yet he still is able to
garner sympathy.</P>
<P> Theron's Candy is a woman-child who, as she says, hates being alone.
With her lover off to war, she gravitates to Homer. She is not a selfish
woman, but a needy one.</P>
<P> Offering able support as Larch's longtime nurses are Kathy Baker and
Jane Alexander. Their screen time is minimal, but they complement Larch
with their warmth and compassion toward their charges.</P>
<P> "The Cider House Rules" is a movie that smoothly combines humor and
tragedy, darkness and light. It is Homer's odyssey about learning - not
only of the outside world - but about who he really is and about
accepting the responsibility of his destiny.</P>
<P> Most of all, "The Cider House Rules" is a movie with heart.</P>
