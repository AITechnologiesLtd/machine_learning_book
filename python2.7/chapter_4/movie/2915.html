<PRE>                                 QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1994 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: A</PRE>
<P>     A common complaint amongst film critics is "why aren't there more
literate scripts available?"  QUIZ SHOW gives signs of hope that the
art of writing isn't dead in Hollywood and that we need not only look
to independent films for thoughtful content.  Paul Attanasio's script
takes what could have been a tepid thriller (the Quiz Show scandals of
the late 50s) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the
post war American Dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and
protects TV networks and their sponsors.</P>
<P>     The film is riddled with telling symbols (e.g. a '58 Chrysler, a
radio announcement of Sputnik) but is never heavy handed.  Deft
Direction by Robert Redford and keen performances by Ralph Fiennes,
John Turturro and Rob Morrow  dovetail perfectly with the carefully
honed script.  Redford departs from the usually overlight, "cable TV
quality" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th Century period
pieces.  QUIZ SHOW perfectly captures the colors and textures of the
Eisenhower years.  Although I was only 4 years old when the "Twenty
One" scandal broke, enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my
childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of Redford's almost
tangible palette.  From plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed
contestants, the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism,
of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world
war without "disposable income," before the manifestation of its
American Dream.</P>
<P>     The film deftly weaves several themes together, from assimilation
and exclusion of Jews from "the good life," to the lengths that a scion
of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame.  Though the
50s audience that is "rocked" by this scandal may initially seem naive
to us, they should appear all too familiar, with our current national
passion for the rise and fall of icons like Michael Jackson or Tonya
Harding.  Charles Van Doren and Herbie Stemple were the overnight mega
celebrities of their day.  The TV audience is almost a fourth main
character, always at the center of the decisions being made on their
behalf.</P>
<P>     At the film's end, the credits roll past slow motion footage of
that same 50s TV audience, mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff.
Like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end
of CABARET, this "mirror" may reflect an image we're not all that
comfortable with.</P>
