<P>     Consider this premise:  a private investigator (Dana Carvey) who's a 
key witness in an upcoming trial has a memory problem.  Not only can't he 
recall the crimes of the man he's supposed to testify against, but he 
can't remember things from day to day.  Every time he goes to sleep, his 
amnesia asserts itself, wiping out events, places, and people.  So, every 
night before he goes to bed, he uses a cassette recorder to tape 
instructions to himself - basic facts of life to get him through the day. </P>
<P>     Add to this a beautiful woman who is supposed to be dead (Valeria 
Golno), a mobster with a British accent (Michael Gambon), and a doctor 
who seems to know things that no one else does (Michael Murphy), and the 
seeds are there for a decent thriller - or a hilarious comedy.  
Unfortunately, CLEAN SLATE is neither.  For all its promise and 
possibilities, this film manages to be nothing more than forgettable. </P>
<P>     As far as featherweight entertainment goes, this isn't bad.  The 
script is peppered with funny moments, although probably less than half the 
jokes actually click.  CLEAN SLATE works better when its humor isn't too 
outrageous - the climactic trial scene is more silly than enjoyable 
because it's so completely over-the-top (lawyers, bailiffs, and courtroom 
observers pile atop each other in the middle of a free-for-all melee). </P>
<P>     One of the most disappointing things about this film is that it could 
have been so much better, either as a mystery or a comedy.  Only on one 
or two occasions is the central plot device of amnesia used to its full 
potential.  Whichever way the filmmaker chose to play CLEAN SLATE - for 
laughs or thrills - it would seem they had a winner.  Yet, mysteriously, 
the result is a unsatisfying mix of a hard-to-swallow gumshoe tale and a 
pedestrian comedy. </P>
<P>     The cast is solid.  Although you occasionally expect him to start 
imitating George Bush, Dana Carvey brings a welcome likability to Maurice 
Pogue, the man with no memory.  Valeria Golino, known best as Charlie 
Sheen's girlfriend from the two HOT SHOTS films, again functions as the 
token female love interest.  James Earl Jones enjoys himself in this 
comic turn, while bringing a touch of class to CLEAN SLATE.  Other 
performers include Kevin Pollak, Michael Gambon, and Olivia D'Abo. </P>
<P>     The first act, where the audience is finding things out along with Pogue, 
is the most entertaining segment of the film.  For the first forty-five 
minutes, the script cleverly forces the viewers to identify with the main 
character.  It's almost - albeit not quite - a first-person motion 
picture.  Certainly, Pogue is in every early scene.  Then he goes to 
sleep and forgets everything, but the audience remembers, and the effect 
is ruined.  Now Pogue's memory loss seems like what it is - a device to 
set up jokes and move the story along. </P>
<P>     There are some worthwhile running gags, including the local blind man's 
"joke of the day", a painter's continuing attempts to render a Mona Lisa 
likeness on the side of a building, and the misadventures of a dog with 
depth perception problems.  None of these, however, make up for what 
CLEAN SLATE is missing. </P>
<P>     This film is likeable, if not especially worthwhile.  Admittedly, Dana 
Carvey is a more engaging screen presence than his former SATURDAY NIGHT 
LIVE co-star Mike Myers, but there's little in the way of breakthrough 
comedy in his latest feature.  With CLEAN SLATE, the lackluster results 
speak of a wasted opportunity. </P>
