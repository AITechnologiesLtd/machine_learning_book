<PRE>                             THE CROSSING GUARD
                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1996 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Sean Penn
Cast: Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright and Angelica Houston
Release Date: Friday August 16 1996 (UK)</P>
<P>THE CROSSING GUARD tells the story of how two men cope with the death of a 
young girl from a drink-driving accident. One man being the father of the 
young girl, Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) , the other being the drunk driver
himself, John Booth (David Morse).</P>
<P>When the film begins we see John Booth being released from the jail where 
he served a six year sentence for killing the young girl.  We see him 
welcomed back with loving arms by his parents Helen and John (played by 
Piper Laurie and Richard Bradford).  John decides to live in a trailer beside 
his parents house and no sooner has he moved in when he is visited by Freddy
Gale seeking revenge for his daughter's death.  Fortunately for John, the gun 
with which Freddy fully intends to shoot him, doesn't appear to have 
been loaded.  Freddy then decides to give John a three day reprieve before 
he returns to visit him once more.  It is this three day period which the 
rest of the film shows, leading up to their next meeting when Freddy fully 
intends to carry out his original plan of killing John.</P>
<P>During the course of the film we get to meet Freddy's ex-wife, Mary (Angelica 
Houston) and her new husband (played by the singer Robbie Robertson).  
Mary has two young sons from her marriage to Freddy (in addition to their 
deceased daughter), who now call Mary's new husband "Daddy" and call their 
estranged father "Freddy".  Freddy is shown to have abandoned his wife and 
sons after his daughter's death and has kept in little contact with them since. 
Whilst Mary is shown to have remained strong for the sake of their young sons,  
we see that Freddy couldn't or wouldn't face up to his responsibilities to 
his family following their tragic loss.  </P>
<P>Freddy runs a jeweller's shop in town and spends a lot of time in local strip 
joints and with the young girls who work there.  His daughter's loss never
seems far from his mind though, as we see him lovingly observing a young girl 
embracing her father in the street.  Freddy is convinced that taking the 
life of the man who took his daughter's life will somehow make things better.  
When he tells his ex-wife of his plans to kill John Booth, she doesn't take 
too kindly to the idea.  Freddy reckons that this means that somehow Mary 
doesn't really care for their lost daughter, so deep is his conviction
that revenge is the answer.</P>
<P>During the three day waiting period, John starts a new job and meets and 
starts a relationship with a woman he meets at a party, Jojo (played by 
Robin Wright).  Jojo is aware of John's past and clearly starts to develop 
strong feelings for John, as does John for her.  But it soon starts to become 
very clear to Jojo that John's guilt is so great that she feels unable to reach
him.  There is a wonderful scene in the film when John visits Jojo and seeks 
solace from the pain he is feeling. Jojo knows how mere words will not do, and
anyway she knows that she will be unable to find the right words, so she 
simply puts on a tape and urges John to dance with her.  Jojo starts to
dance but John just stands still at first, realising that
neither Jojo or anyone will be able to help him get over his pain.  The
acting by David Morse and Robin Wright in this scene is amongst the finest in 
the film.  Very few words are spoken, but you can just feel what is going 
through their minds.</P>
<P>The acting throughout the film is excellent. Sean Penn has drawn fine some 
performances from all the lead actors.  Jack Nicholson is on top form 
and is never anything but totally convincing. His pain and anger is palpable 
throughout the film.  David Morse is always a solid performer and he is great 
as John,  playing a man whose pain and anguish is almost deeper than that 
of Freddy's.  David Morse is a huge man but with the quietest of voices and 
superbly portrays a character who clearly has spent much of the past six years 
examining his conscience and wrestling with the pain and suffering he has 
inflicted on Freddy's family and indeed his own family.  Piper Laurie and
Richard Bradford, as John's loving parents, are excellent in the short 
amount of screen time they get. Especially, their scene in the car on the 
way home from jail when John's father is so ecstatic that he has his son back 
with him that he can't help but laugh out loud and can't keep himself from 
swearing with glee - the first time he has sworn in front of his son.  Piper 
Laurie, as John's mum,  gets in on the act too and lets out a swear word.   
This scene is wonderfully played - and I haven't really done it justice here.</P>
<P>Sean Penn's script is very well written and deals with very delicate 
subjects - mourning, and the feelings of revenge that can overcome 
people who have suffered such a terrible loss as Freddy.  Whilst we are never 
led to believe that Freddy's plans are right, we nevertheless can't help but 
feel for Freddy - a man who seems unable to face up to life without his
beloved daughter.  </P>
