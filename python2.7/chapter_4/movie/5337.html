<P>     Though you can't take your eyes off of it, director Brian DePalma's
hotly anticipated adaptation of the classic '60's spy series is a
misfire of near-colossal proportions.  *Huge* amounts of effort and
talent are up on the screen and, yet, the movie fails to meet the
most-simple of narrative standards:  it doesn't draw us into the
characters.  Period.  Minutes pass, scenes change, but that crucial
connection never happens.  Blame the lousy pre-credits opening, for
starters.  What the hell are we supposed to make of a surveillance
expert (Emilio Estevez) watching a black-and-white video of what appears
to be a bad Russian soap opera?  Huh?  This terrible sequence was
reportedly *much* more elaborate, until the test audiences got hold of
it.  God help us.  Now, the scene runs about five minutes and that's all
the introduction we get.  Almost no chance to identify the characters,
nor assimilate the action, nor get a feel for the film's tone.  Needless
to say, the movie never recovers from this misstep.</P>
<P>     What we later learn is that said soap stars are really a team of
secret agents.  They work for Mr. Phelps (Jon Voight, looking very old),
a shadowy government figure who must owe Blockbuster Video some serious
bucks because all of his tapes keep self-destructing.  (The character of
Mr. Phelps is one of the few elements retained from the television
series; another is composer Lalo Schifrin's cool theme music.) The story
has Mr. Phelps accompanying his IMF team on a doomed mission to Prague,
to intercept someone who's selling the real names of secret agents.
(Said list is largely responsible for turning the plot screws.  Would
you like some fries with your MacGuffin?) Problems ensue, bad things
happen, and the team's point man, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is
immediately suspected as a traitor.  Notice that I'm not telling much of
the plot.  The rest of the story has Hunt on the run, ducking his
superiors while trying to catch the real bad guys.</P>
<P>     The whole thing is far more convoluted than I can describe here.
And the tone isn't much better.  DePalma tries be both serious and silly
and it doesn't work.  The major components of the movie are too heavy;
the handsome cast, the top production values, etc. all but squeeze the
cheese right out of the film.  So, instead of integration, we get a
study in contrasts:  fine actors like Kristin Scott-Thomas playing
straight to somebody wearing obvious old-age make-up.  Or, those
imposing international locales that are announced to the audience in
gigantic letters on title cards.  Or, my favorite, the dramatic
confrontations and the crazy angles that capture them.  Holy tilted
camera!</P>
<P>     The camera tilts are absurdly appropriate, though, given the film's
low Believability Factor (BF).  When Cruise's character escapes from a
restaurant, for example, he blows up an aquarium that releases enough
water to supply a small city.  (BF=0.09) And there are *many* such
goofs, gaffes, and general "head-scratchers" scattered about.
Respectable writers David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK), Steven Zaillan
(SCHINDLER'S LIST), and Robert Towne (CHINATOWN) are listed in the
credits.  I wonder which one was responsible for that amazing "Internet
magic" that Hunt performs?  Or who thought it believable that Hunt would
retreat to a government-sponsored safe house, after said government was
now hunting *him*?  As the movie is nearly devoid of any humor, these
unintentional amusements-- like the sight of Vanessa Redgrave wearing
what's either a bad wig or a bad dye job-- provide some critically
needed chuckles.  (One *intentional* gas is the film's standout
sequence, involving the theft of a computer file from a secured room at
the CIA Headquarters.  It's vintage DePalma and *far* more exciting that
the speed-train-helicopter-into-the-Chunnel-chase finale.)</P>
<P>     Still, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE should generate both good returns and
good word of mouth.  Working with an array of accomplished actors,
lavish locales, and cool camera tricks, DePalma has created a convincing
illusion.  He's made the quintessential Hollywood product:  a well-
produced and well-promoted thrill machine.  If the applause at the
screening that I saw is any indication, *many* people are going to enjoy
this movie and many people are going to think that they've really *seen*
something.  For the rest of the us-- those already sensitive since that
terrible TWISTER blew through-- we can roll with what's awful and still
have some fun.  After all, the director *is* Brian DePalma.  He knows
how to handle trash and turn it into something that's entirely
watchable.</P>
