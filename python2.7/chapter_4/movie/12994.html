<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>When one goes into a "Saturday Night Live" spin-off movie starring Norm
Macdonald, one should not have high expectations.  I didn't have high
expectations, although the trailers for Dirty Work made me laugh hard
enough to want to see the movie.  Dirty Work is profoundly dumb,
centering around a ludicrous premise and going way over the line with
it.  It's also amazingly funny, filled to the brim with jokes that
actually work and scenes that are unusually hilarious.  Although it's
clear that absolutely no thought was put into the script, it's nice to
sit through a comedy that actually induces laughter.</P>
<P>Macdonald stars as Mitch Weaver, a loser.  He fills his life with odd
jobs, such as delivering pizza.  The film opens as he gets fired from
his job for delivering a pizza two minutes late.  We then see that his
girlfriend kicks him out (even though he offers "dirty sex" to make up
for losing his job).  Soon we meet his best friend, Sam (Artie Lange). 
They've been best friends for their entire lives (the film opens with a
funny introduction showing their childhood).</P>
<P>Jack Warden plays Sam's father; in a really silly subplot, it turns out
that he's also Mitch's father.  I have no idea what the point of this
is, but it's present in the film and highly stressed throughout.  The
title of the film comes in when Mitch realizes that he can make a lot of
money by charging people to take revenge on their nemesis.  In the
required Villain role, Christopher McDonald (who is now one of my
favorite silly-movie bad guys) has fun hamming it up.  </P>
<P>Macdonald co-wrote the film, along with Frank Sebastiano and Fred Wolf,
and though he doesn't know the first thing about intelligent
storytelling, there's something in the dialogue and his execution of the
lines that makes this film hysterically fun.  He always seems to be on
the verge of laughter (I don't really think he can act), but this only
adds to the odd dynamics of the film.  In fact, every time he opens his
mouth, it's funny -- you should laugh excessively at the scene in which
he shouts, "Who's that dude?" </P>
<P>He also has a strange fixation with prostitutes.  The film doesn't go
for ten minutes at a time without mentioning prostitutes or brining them
on screen.  By the end of the film, he's enlisted so many prostitutes
that he can refer to his "loyal army of prostitutes."  Just hearing
Macdonald refer to such things is funny, but I'm not sure why.  I think
it's just the way he says it, because, if I referred to my loyal army of
prostitutes, I don't imagine that it would make people laugh.  One of
the funniest scenes in the film has Mitch using a live commercial to
advertise his business; this segment involves a lot of dead prostitutes
in the trunks of new cars.</P>
<P>Like all stupid-but-funny films, it has scenes and subplots that just
don't work.  Warden is disappointing; most of the scenes with him fall
flat (although the picture in the locket is pretty good).  He tries
really hard to be funny, but his lines just aren't that good, and he's a
little too over-the-top to be light and fluffy the way Macdonald is. 
Lange is also pretty funny, though overall I doubt he's much of an
actor.  And the story is totally ridiculous -- how did they even come up
with it?  I certainly have no idea, but I'd be the first to agree that
they took the premise as far as it could possibly go, and then further
than that.</P>
<P>Dirty Work is stupid and funny.  If you want to laugh and not think,
then go see it.  I don't see how you couldn't enjoy it if you like Norm
Macdonald, and especially if you think prostitutes are inherently
funny.  I liked it while noting its enormous flaws, and it passes
swiftly enough that you might not even notice that it's a full-length
film.  No matter how you look at it, though, I'm just glad that I was
able to laugh at all.  An unfunny comedy is unacceptable, and Dirty Work
is, at least, a good time.</P>
