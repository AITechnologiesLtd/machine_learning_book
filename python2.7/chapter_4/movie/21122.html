<PRE>Rating: * * *½ out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Unrated contains (all animated) graphic violence and gore, a strong rape scene,
nudity and some language.</P>
<P>Anime films have always been awesome to me, I haven't seen many, but what I did
see made me hooked on them. Now I finally get to see the brand new anime film
'Perfect Blue' as I would put it is that it is a cartoon with Hitchcock
highlights. A cartoon which is not for kids at least under the age of 14. With
it's high quotient of graphic violence and copious gore, it's a mature film
made to be viewed by adults.</P>
<P>Mima is a popular star in a Japanese pop group. After wanting to pursue an
acting career, despite the personal opinion of her agent, she becomes an
actress and gets a part in a thriller. Someone however does not like the fact
that Mima is out of the pop light, and has become an actress, someone is
watching Mima, every move she makes, killing off people she knows, now she has
to try and figure out rather her career or her life comes first...</P>
<P>Despite a few slow parts in the film, this is a great psychological thriller.
It takes on a journey to places where our minds are challenged, we have to
think about what is happening. The lead character Mima is so well-thought out,
you'd think she was real. Even being a cartoon at times the film seemed like a
live action movie, with some intense scenes. Towards the middle of the film it
becomes a little confusing on our part, but quickly descends back into it's
brilliant mind.</P>
<P>The animation is plush and colorful, with the character well-animated. The
movie does contain content that some viewers may not like or even be offended
by. Graphic violence does occur in the film, but not all the time. Of course it
is animated, but with the violence is alot of blood and gore, some resulting in
bloody messes. The movie has a way to captivate us, and make us part of the
story. The direction of the film, writing and the way it is brought to us is
very original and innovative.</P>
<P>'Perfect Blue' is probably the best adult cartoon movie I've seen in a while.
It pays homage to Hitchcock, has the animation to satisfy any animation buff,
the intensity to make someone uncomfortable. I also found the film to make me
think about what can happen, and by the end of the film some shocking stuff
happens in the storyline, which I would have never thought possible. A
wonderfully entertaining movie, that all anime fans should love.</P>
