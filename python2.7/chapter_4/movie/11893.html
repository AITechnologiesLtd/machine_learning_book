<PRE>Alien Nation (1988)
* 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Tired and thin attempt at genre-mixing: Aliens Are Among Us meets
Crime Story. Cliches abound.</P>
<P>ALIEN NATION starts with one great idea and then drowns it in an ocean of
stupidity. It starts off with a none-too-thinly disguised allegory about --
literally -- legal and illegal aliens. A spaceship comes to Earth, holding
100,000 roughly humanoid aliens who have been created by some other species
for hard labor. They're intelligent and gifted, and they slowly get absorbed
into Amercan society (I'm assuming American society, but the movie focuses
on SoCal). All of this has great promise, and the first five minutes of the
movie hum with untapped possibilites. Then the plot got under way, and my
hopes died.</P>
<P>Why does this happen, almost without fail? I've seen countless movies that
have the germ of a good idea but not a whit of how to deploy it properly,
and I'm sad to include ALIEN NATION on that list. It's not a cheap movie; it
was financed by Gale Anne Hurd, who put her money into ALIENS and a number
of other movies of similar ilk. Just that somewhere along the line there was
a terrible failure of imagination, and the whole thing turned into a TV cop
show.</P>
<P>The plot features a cop -- James Caan -- and his new alien partner (Mandy
Patinkin). Caan lost his last partner to an alien grocery-store robber, so
of course he's hesitant. Eventually, he chokes back his revulsion and
decides to use the other man to get revenge, sort of. This involves getting
close to another alien, played by Terence Stamp, who simply mixes and
matches all the typical Movie Drug Lord cliches. Once we were into the usual
chases and shoot-outs, I lost all interest. There were attempts to get it
back -- like having the aliens get stoned on sour milk, or giving them goofy
names no thanks to Immigration -- but none of it elicited more than a
snicker.</P>
<P>All the problems can be traced to the script. There's nothing wrong with the
movie technically -- it looks convincing enough, especially in the opening
moments. But no one took a good, hard look at it and said, this isn't
enough. We've all seen enough cop shows and drug-lord revenge thrillers.
Gussying yet another one up in the guise of SF doesn't help anyone.</P>
<P>FOOTNOTE: The strangest thing about ALIEN NATION is the TV series that was
spun off from it, where they actually sat down and took the time to explore
the ramifications of what they'd set up. The show's well-done and worth
watching. The movie doesn't have a clue. This may be the first time the
spinoff has more going for it than the source material.</P>
