Capsule Review, August 23, 1999.</P>
<P>"Eight Days a Week," a barely-released teen comedy made in 1997 and now on 
video everywhere, has one major selling point, and that is Keri Russell, star 
of TV's "Felicity." Without her, the film would probably still be tucked away 
into obscurity, and it's easy to see why. In the far-fetched story of an 
unpopular teenage boy (Josh Schaeffer) who decides to live right outside the 
home of his true love (Keri Russell) all summer until he wins her heart, the 
film is painfully obvious and opts to usually be silly rather than honest. 
Only a few of the more quiet scenes shine through, hinting at a dramatic 
turnaround that could possibly save the movie, but the exploitative, 
thoroughly unsatisfying ending only serves to unmask the absolute shallowness 
of not only the film, but the director, as well.</P>
