<P>PECKER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
Fine Line / 1:27 / 1998 / R (language, brief nudity, crude humor, drug 
use, teabagging)
Cast: Edward Furlong; Christina Ricci; Mary Kay Place; Lili Taylor; Mark 
Joy; Martha Plimpton; Brendan Sexton III; Jean Schertler; Lauren Hulsey; 
Bess Armstrong; Mink Stole; Patricia Hearst 
Director: John Waters 
Screenplay: John Waters<HR>Although John Waters might never make a movie that truly caters to the 
masses, his new comedy "Pecker" could very well be the closest to 
mainstream as he'll ever get. Maybe "There's Something About Mary"'s 
hair gel hijinks and the salacious entirety of the Ken Starr report have 
softened the low blows of Baltimore's perverse prodigal son, but that's 
not to say that "Pecker" comes off as reserved, atypical or troubled 
Waters. Quite the contrary, actually; in sparing us such repulsive 
sights as the stomach-turning finale of 1971's "Pink Flamingos" (a 
banquet of canine feces, for those who don't know), he's created a 
loving hometown portrait that matches vintage outlandishness with 
undeniable heart and accessibility. </P>
<P>"Pecker" gets its title from the nickname of its main character, played 
by "Terminator 2"'s Edward Furlong. Called such for his childhood habit 
of eating like a bird and not because of any "Boogie Nights"-esque 
endowment (though that detail _would_ feel right at home in a Waters 
film), the 18-year-old simpleton is at his happiest while taking amateur 
snapshots of his family, friends and just about everything else around 
him - even rats copulating in a tipped-over trash can. When savvy New 
York art dealer Rorey (luminous Lily Taylor) stumbles across one of his 
makeshift shows in the sandwich shop where he works, she loves what she 
sees, and Pecker and his pictures become an overnight success in the 
trendy, pretentious world of Big Apple artistes. </P>
<P>Plucking Pecker's kin out of blue-collarville is just the icing on the 
proverbial cake, largely because each character is such a genuine comic 
creation on his or her own. Mom (Mary Kay Place) manages a thrift store 
where the homeless get unsightly fashion tips, dad (Mark Joy) fixates 
over regional mandates regarding pubic hair while tending the family bar 
and kid sibling Little Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey) is a sugar-dependant who 
devours Domino straight from the sack. Grandma (Jean Schertler) divides 
her time between maintaining the title of "Baltimore's pit beef queen" 
and handling a statue of the Virgin Mary like it's a dummy in a really 
bad ventriloquist act - "Full of grace!" it screeches, whilst the 
puppeteers lips move all too conspicuously in the background. </P>
<P>But it's the perfectly deadpan Christina Ricci and full-tilt bonkers 
Martha Plimpton who rack up the films highest laugh quotients, 
respectively cast as Pecker's gal pal Shelly and big sis Tina. Ricci has 
a handful of choice moments, whether running a local laundromat like 
Patton or waxing poetic over "the brilliant green of a grass stain." 
Tina, an emcee at a gay club called the Fudge Palace, is the most 
brilliantly warped personality here, and Plimpton, unrecognizable under 
a black Judds hairdo, has a loud and proud time bringing her to life. 
Furlong's limited range is evident when acting opposite burgeoning 
thesps like Ricci and Brandon Sexton III (who plays his klepto best 
bud), but he still radiates a goofily charismatic vibe, readily getting 
into the wacky Waters swing of things. </P>
<P>There are a few lulls to the comedy (there are a few lulls to _every_ 
comedy), especially after Pecker's instant fame adversely affects all 
those around him you're still laughing, though not nearly as much. But 
this is only a slight flaw in the long run, since the movie regains 
momentum as it nears its giddy conclusion, a big party sequence that 
brings all the players and their unusual obsessions together - love the 
twisted new addiction given to Little Chrissy. Waters deserves as much 
credit as his completely game actors for keeping "Pecker"'s many running 
jokes fresh and funny each time they're rehashed; a filmmaker less 
imaginative and experienced with humorous crudity might run all this 
straight into the ground. </P>
<P>The most surprising thing about "Pecker" is how sweet it is in its 
dealings with familial bonds, a focus Waters often employs. This could 
lead some diehard fans to accuse the writer/director of softening with 
age bona fide Waters jolts (including a sudden close-up anatomy lesson 
and a taboo stripper practice known as "teabagging") number relatively 
few here, and they're not going to shock anyone who bore witness to Ben 
Stiller's zipped-up cojones in "About Mary." But there's no shortage of 
other assorted crotch jokes with the kinder, gentler Waters; its just 
that you might have to make a trip to the video store if you want to see 
him at his nastiest. For everyone else, however, "Pecker" is a welcome 
pseudo-change.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
