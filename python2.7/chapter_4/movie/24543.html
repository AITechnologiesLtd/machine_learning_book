<P>It's only two weeks since I reviewed "American Psycho", but here already is a 
more powerful movie dealing with similar themes, without the dumb gags or 
vicious streak. "Boiler Room" is often a comedy, because it lets us spend 
time with some of the most risible people alive -- stockbrokers. It's also a 
very serious thriller, because the protagonist gets seduced by their 
money-grubbing lifestyle and ends up in over his head.</P>
<P>His name is Seth (Giovanni Ribisi), a 19-year old New Yorker who dropped out 
of college and supports himself by running an illegal casino out of his 
apartment. When his father, a federal court judge, discovers this, he hits 
the roof, and tells him to get a proper job. Seth can't handle dad's disgust. 
He determines to find an occupation that requires him to wear a suit.</P>
<P>Then one of his friends sets him up at the firm of J.T. Marlin -- a 
telemarketing 'chop shop' that sells people stock for companies that don't 
exist, then charges them huge commission rates to dump it on the open market. 
This is more dishonest than the casino, but hey, it looks respectable enough. 
And it pays better. That's made clear in a pep talk by the recruiter, Jim 
(Ben Affleck), who seems to have used Alec Baldwin's chilling monologue in 
"Glengarry Glen Ross" as a self-help tape. "Work here," he tells the men in 
front of him, "And within three years you'll be a millionaire. Anybody who 
says money is the root of all evil doesn't have any."</P>
<P>The guys know Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" off by heart, too. They proudly 
recite the villain's speeches; oblivious to the message, and getting a kick 
out of the lingo. When they're all on the phone, screaming stock pitches to 
potential victims, the obsession and aggression in the office is palpable, 
and so very evil and illegal that we know something disastrous is bound to 
happen.</P>
<P>Since we are so engaged by Seth, we watch this with more tension than 
disgust. He is a well-written hero for the piece because he's an essentially 
good kid; we can sympathise with his desire to make money, and though he does 
dishonest things, he doesn't realise it, because he hasn't evaluated the 
situation in that way. The climate in J.T. Marlin teaches him to consider 
only money, and if there's nothing wrong with the pay check, what could be 
wrong at all? Seth has to be suckered in before he can realise what a sham 
this is, and "Boiler Room" is fascinating because it lets us see the whole 
process unfold. </P>
<P>All of the movie's dialogue is impressive. Brokers' conversations sound like 
a cross between financial jargon and military planning. And Seth's scenes 
with his father (Ron Rifkin) and the film's love interest (Nia Long) are 
staged like clichés but played with humour, emotion, presence and 
personality. The characters talk about their backgrounds, hopes and needs in 
convincing ways. "Boiler Room" works as a morality play by presenting us with 
people whose moral compasses it's actually possible to care about.</P>
