<P>   Almost every week you hear about a guy who has achieved
material success but who has expressed his feeling about his
circumstances by committing suicide--or worse, by being the
perpetrator of an inexplicable homicide.  In "Alice and Martin,"
filmmaker Andre Techine, whose previous works "Barocco"
and "The Bronte Sisters" hone in on the impact of fear,
anxiety and guilt--dramatizes a tale about one such person
who early in life achieves rapid fame and substance only to
be strangely despondent despite his good fortune. 
Sometimes he is pleased with himself.  For the most part
when he is not simply staring out a window he behaves in
bizarre ways, particularly toward one person to whom he had
declared his love.  While "Alice and Martin" is not a thriller
but rather indulges in the usual Gallic film tradition of
elevating talk to a preeminent status, Techine intends to have
his audience teased by suspense, wondering just why such a
youthful, handsome, and financially successful fellow who is
loved by the object of his affection is so downright miserable.</P>
<P>   As the title indicates, the film is a romance focusing on two
persons, the eponymous woman being a human being who is
herself insecure, if not chronically disheartened.  This movie
can serve as either a love story or a psychological case
study.  Techine has not succeeded in giving the narrative
much dramatic impact, a disappointment particularly if
Philippe Sarde's pulsating opening score has you anticipating
a work of unique intensity.  </P>
<P>   Techine's screenplay, co-written by Gilles Taurand and
Oliver Assayas, posits the not unusual theory that the past is
always with us--sort of like the adage that holds that when
you're in bed with your lover, there are really six people
under the sheets: the man, the woman and their parents. 
The story opens on the ten-year-old Martin (Jeremy
Kreikenmayer) who is inexplicably ordered by his divorced
mother Jeanine Sauvagnac (Carmen Maura) to visit the boy's
father Victor (Pierre Maguelon)--only to find that Victor has
his own brood consisting of his wife Lucie (Marthe Villalonga)
and three half-brothers.  (Victor, by the way, seems way too
old to be the father of this kid.)  As photographer Caroline
Champetier cuts to Martin (Alexis Loret in his debut
performance) a decade or so later, we find the man aimlessly
running through a field, homeless, stealing raw eggs from a
farmer's chicken coop for food and sheltering himself as best
he could from the cold and rain.  Taking refuge with his half
brother Benjamin (Mathieu Amalric), a struggling actor, he
meets Benjamin's roommate, insecure violinist Alice (Juliette
Binoche), secures a fabulous job as a model for commercial
products, and makes a bid for Alice's heart.  The relationship
between Alice--whose masochistic love for the neurotic and
moody Martin--is the crux of Techine's account.</P>
<P>   Though Martine Giordano's editing is often choppy, in one
case flashing back to Martin's youth as though the segment
were continuous with his present life, Techine does succeed
in various fragments to cast an ambient vision on the
production, particularly capturing the routine that tourists go
through when exploring an area like Granada's Alhambra and
engages the imagination particularly in one slow-motion shot
that communicates the vastness of the sea and the
insignificance of the human being when placed in contrast. 
But the story is sloppily organized, the relationship between
Martin and his father underdeveloped where further
explication is needed, and the project consequently lacks the
facility to engross its audience.  </P>
