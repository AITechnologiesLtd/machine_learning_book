ORSON WELLES' DON QUIXOTE
Starring:  Francisco Reiguera, Akim Tamiroff, Orson Welles.
Director (original footage):  Orson Welles.
Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</PRE>
<P>     On and off for seventeen years, Orson Welles, worked on an
adaptation of Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE.  While he worked on other
projects, he would shoot pieces of DON QUIXOTE here and there, in the
hope that some day he would have the financing necessary to complete
the project.  However, the film was not complete when Welles died in
1985.  In 1992, a Spanish team undertook the project of turning the
existing footage into a completed film.  They have done Welles' memory
a tremendous disservice in the process.  DON QUIXOTE is a monumental
disappointment, with only glimpses of Welles' brilliance emerging from
an exercise in editing butchery.</P>
<P>     Welles' DON QUIXOTE opens with the familiar story of the Spanish
nobleman (Francisco Reiguera) who becomes fascinated with the tales of
chivalry he reads about in novels.  He decides that he is to become a
knight errant himself, and, accompanied by his squire Sancho Panza
(Akim Tamiroff), sets off to do great deeds in the name of his
idealized love Dulcinea.  Soon, however, Don Quixote comes into
conflict not only with sheep and windmills, but with the modern world.
Sancho runs with the bulls in Pamplona, discovers television, and even
finds himself being captured on film by the great director Orson
Welles.</P>
<P>     This collision of eras is the heart of Welles' vision for DON
QUIXOTE, and to the extent that it survives the film is thought-
provoking.  It becomes an instant validation of Quixote's belief that
through his exploits as a knight errant, he might achieve some measure
of immortality.  And we see that this is what has occurred; Welles
skillfully frames shots that include a billboard for "Don Quixote
Cerveza" and the Restaurante Don Qixote, emphasizing the character's
nature as an icon.  He is not an object of ridicule, but a dreamer to
be respected for being true to his vision.  As Welles places himself in
the narrative, we also see how he identifies with the knight, and
considers his own immortality through his filmmaking.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, DON QUIXOTE takes nearly an hour to get to its
contemporary setting, and that hour occasionally borders on the
unwatchable.  It is not simply that the quality of the print is
sometimes horrible.  There is simply no rhythm to the story, and it
feels for all the world like pieces of film stuck together at random.
As striking as some of Welles' images are, editing director Jess Franco
simply had no idea what to do with them, and apparently even changed
some of the editing Welles *had* managed to complete before his death.</P>
<P>     Another huge problem with the film involves the dialogue dubbing.
Although two other actors portray Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, their
parts were filmed silent, with Welles himself to dub both voices.
However, only portions of Welles' dialogue were recorded, and where his
dialogue doesn't exist, two other actors were used to provide the
voices.  Not only is the shift between Welles' voice and that of two
other men jarring, but the two other actors do not even come close to
the spirit of the vocal performances Welles was providing.  Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza are not even the same characters from one scene to the
next, and at times the appalling modern voiceovers are simply
laughable.</P>
<P>     The version of DON QUIXOTE which screened at San Jose's Cinequest
Film Festival is not the same as the one which made its American
premiere at the Museum of Modern Art.  Oja Kodar, Welles' companion
during the last years of his life, and frequent Welles cinematographer
Gary Graber trimmed a 113-minute version to just under 90 minutes, and
it would be an easy knock at the film to say that any changes which
made it shorter still would be a further improvement.  But there's
really no way of knowing, and that's the real point.  Using guesswork
and very little talent, a bunch of well-intentioned film buffs tried to
piece together a lot of raw footage into something resembling the work
of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  They failed.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 knights errant:  3.</PRE>
