<PRE>                           THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Novalyne Price Ellis is now 88-years-old.  The film is based on
her book, ONE WHO WALKED ALONE,  a remembrance of  Robert E Howard
whom she loved way back in the 1930s.  Howard was the very eccentric
author of the  weird stories of CONAN, THE BARBARIAN.  As he was the
first to unreservedly admit, he was "the best writer in the whole wide
world."</P>
<P>     The film is a precious gem from its opening scene of Novalyne
(Renee Zellweger) on the porch of her home in rural Texas to the
fadeout at the end that lingers lovingly on her face.   Vincent
D'Onofrio, who plays Howard, transports us into another world, that of
the writer who wanted no ties of any kind.  As Howard sits at his
typewriter, he verbalizes and furiously enacts the weird and ferocious
Conan stories.</P>
<P>  When Novalyne meets him it is love at first sight but his love is
not the same as hers.  Where she yearns for "normal" love, he feels
marriage is binding, that it will restrict, and he will have no part
of it. Like Robert, she too is a writer with the big difference that
she is unpublished.  Robert, a bear of a man and outspoken, tells her
that her stories are laughable.  He explains that the people in her
town about whom she writes are unreal because they bear no resemblance
to what the people are really like . . . and he despises all of them.</P>
<P>     Robert's father (Harve Presnell) is a doctor.  His sickly mother
(Anne Wedgeworth) makes the most of her illnesses thus keeping her
extremely devoted son close to her  to the point where it borders on a
sickness with Robert washing her, carrying her and always hovering
over her. As he explains to Novalyne, his mother was the first to
recognize his genius and he feels indebted.</P>
<P>     D'Onofrio's portrayal of Howard is in the Oscar nomination class.
Zellweger, too, is perfection, reminding me of a younger Steenburgen.
The music of Harry Gregson-Williams and Hans Zimmer is right on target
and never obtrusive; Claudio Rocha's photography brings us right into
agricultural Texas;  the film's pace is exactly right.    What more
could you ask for? Look for a nomination for Best Film of the year.</P>
