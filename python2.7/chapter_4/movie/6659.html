<PRE>                               PALOOKAVILLE
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1997 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>PALOOKAVILLE(1995) *** Directed by Alan Taylor. Written by David Epstein.
Photography, John Thomas. Editing, David Leonard. Production design, Anne
Stuhler. Music, Rachel Portman. Cast: William Forsythe (Sid), Vincent Gallo
(Russ), Adam Trese (Jerry), Lisa Gay Hamilton (Betty), Kim Dickens
(Laurie),et al. A Samuel Goldwyn Co., release. 92 min. Rated R.(language)</P>
<P>The start of this movie is so amusing that what follows could have been an
anticlimax. It isn't though. The setting is contemporary Jersey City, a
shabby decaying town across the river from the wealth of New York City's
often shown skyscrapers.</P>
<P>Three unemployed, longtime buddies decide to resort to crime--strictly
temporarily.Likable and most unprofessional, in these high-tech times they
use primitive tools to try burglarizing a jewelry store. Instead, they
break into the adjoining bakery, where Jerry keeps gobbling pastries and
stuffing donuts inside his shirt. The sequence is treated with sweet
absurdism, close to Inspector Clouseau territory.</P>
<P>The protagonists' dwellings are low-income, cramped quarters. Interiors and
exteriors could, by and large, have been settings of past decades.Even the
pals' only car is an old clunker.</P>
<P>Handsome Jerry has a kid and a breadwinner wife. Betty is black. This helps
situate the film in recent times and adds a warm element  as absolutely no
special point is made of it.</P>
<P>Sid, whose spouse left him, lives with two shaggy, smelly dogs.
Saturnine-looking Russ lives with his mother, his sister, and her husband,
a sullen cop. Russ occasionally visits a friendly prostitute (Frances
McDormand in a cameo appearance) and regularly goes to bed with young,
pretty Laurie, who lives across the back alley and dreams of
California.Visits are easy as both have street-level bedroom windows.</P>
<P>After bungling their first job, the buddies plot others, with Russ as the
self-appointed brains and leader. Their discussions at their usual cafe can
be quite funny. One man dreams up the semi-legitimate notion of an
unlicensed car service for older people who can hardly afford cabs,
assuming these do show up. The smell of Sid's mutts, as they too travel in
the car,quickly sinks that scheme.</P>
<P>A somewhat forced incident suggests a plot involving an armored car. The
plan is hare-brained, the preparations dumbly funny. They include watching
a video of the 1950 movie "Armored Car Robbery" -- a pretty good film but
absurd in "Palookaville"'s context. The execution is comical. Connected,
unconnected and disconnected episodes flesh out the story, the characters,
the milieu</P>
<P>"Palookaville" is an amalgam loosely based on three early short stories by
Italo Calvino who wrote of the plight of ordinary Italians in the
post-World War II years.The atmosphere gets convincingly transferred to the
USA now.There is also the inspiration from the familiar Italian satire "Big
Deal on Madonna Street" (1958) which was about a gang of incompetent
amateur thieves. (The cast included Marcello Mastroianni, then known but
not yet made a major star by Fellini movies).</P>
<P>The director's first feature and the scriptwriter's first produced
screenplay, "Palookaville"  won the Kodak Prize for Best First Feature at
the 1995 Venice Film Festival. Some   inexperience shows in a certain lack
of clarity about people and places. I am no lover of artificial,
all-explaining expositions but I appreciate what might be called the
Hitchcockian introduction, where you don't have to wonder who is who,
where, and what to whom. And while the main music theme is witttily
Italianate, it gets repetitious.</P>
<P>Otherwise, there are fine gags (the suspecting cop and brother-in-law seen
sniffing Russ' pants by Laurie across the alley is a classic moment) and no
villains. The general shabbiness is,without stressing it, a comment on
financially depressed little people in America today. Yet the overall mood
keeps us smiling with its un-gloppy affection for the three losers.</P>
