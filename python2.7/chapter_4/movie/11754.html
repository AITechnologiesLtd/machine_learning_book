<PRE>                            MEN WITH GUNS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In an unspecified Latin American
          country a naive doctor searches for the students he
          sent into the mountains to help Indios only to find
          a string of atrocities by the army and the
          guerrillas.  The film is slow and totally obvious
          from the first reel.  Flat and uninteresting
          characters do little to help.  This is a heartfelt
          story, but tells us nothing we have not known for
          decades.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 12 positive, 2 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     One of the most respected names in American independent filmmaking
is John Sayles.  He has built a strong reputation with films like
MATEWAN and THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH, and one of his best was his last
film, LONE STAR.  After Sayles gave us this complex and unconventional
look at ethnic tensions on the US-Mexico border, expectation ran high
for his next film.  Unfortunately, his MEN WITH GUNS is not the film
anyone was hoping for.  We are essentially told in the first reel where
the film is going to go and what it is going to do.  Then the film does
exactly what it promised, a painful as that is.  The plot of MEN WITH
GUNS can be summarized "In a Central or South American country things
are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes
with the guerrillas.  Dr. Fuentes did not believe how bad things were
so he went.  And he found out again and again and again."  Of course it
is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts
have turned life into a living hell.  A guerrilla war is always bad for
civilians.  But the film talks down to the viewer.</P>
<P>     Dr. Fuentes (played by Federico Luppi) teaches medicine in the
capital city of his country.  He has, as a great humanitarian gesture,
trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains
and make the world a little better for the poor Indios.  Fuentes
believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service.  Then
he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city
and runs a squalid private pharmacy.  In shame and disappointment
Fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others. The student
tells him the others are still in the mountains, but suggests that it
may not be a good place to be. Fuentes goes off to find and visit the
doctors, ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to
be an army general.  The results are little different than one would
expect.</P>
<P>     Dr. Fuentes starts out incredibly naive.  Even some American
tourists, present in the film mostly for comic relief, seem to know
better than Dr. Fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the
mountains.  But Fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to
another and discover how wrong he was.  Sayles certainly could have
used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than
that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst
happens to the unarmed civilians.</P>
<P>     The cast is mostly unknowns to American audiences.  Federico Luppi
is the good Mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by
mysterious forces in CRONOS.  Damian Delgado makes a late appearance as
an army deserter.  Mandy Patinkin has a small role made to look bigger
in the trailer.</P>
<PRE>     MEN WITH GUNS is a film on a serious subject, but it has little
new or valuable to say on that subject.  I rate it 4 on the 0 to 10
scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
