<PRE>"The Big Hit" Is a Complete Miss</PRE>
<P>Here is a movie that sadly follows the Hong Kong-recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling to the letter.  These kinds of movies are marked by an
eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters; a
life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved; the
inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters; ridiculous subplots,
and sunglass-wearing henchmen.  That is not to say that I don't like
Hong Kong influenced movies; however, it is quite obvious that these
moviemakers haven't a clue that the American filmgoer needs more than
hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags.</P>
<P>Observe the opening sequence.  A band of hitmen are about to storm an
apartment, led by Melvin (Mark Wahlberg) and Cisco (Lou Diamond
Phillips).  They are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so
that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles.
However, their partner is unsure of which cable to cut.  He is
undecided.  This happens for about 10 seconds.  The audience finds some
humor in his foolishness.  The lights suddenly go out.  Cisco is
surprised and says: "Whoa...let's go!"  And they storm the apartment in
a very nicely executed sequence.</P>
<P>The Big Hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter
of the way through the film.  Needing cash, Cisco devises a plan to
kidnap the daughter (China Chow) of wealthy Japanese industrialist Jiro
Nishi.  However, the daughter is also the god-daughter of Paris (Avery
Brooks), who is Cisco's and Melvin's boss.  Infuriated and insufferable,
Paris commands Cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping.
During his 'investigation', Cisco singles out Melvin as the ringleader,
and Paris orders his capture and execution.  Melvin must now find a way
to stay alive.</P>
<P>By the way, do you know how the investigation takes place?  Cisco's
partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be
traced because of a Trace Buster that prevents tracing.  But, Mr. Nishi
has a Trace Buster Buster.  To counter that, Cisco's partner has a Trace
Buster Buster Buster.  But Nishi has a Trace Buster Buster Buster
Buster.  And so on...</P>
<P>There is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live.
And there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about.  How
does Melvin justify his profession to his fiancee?  What goes on among
this clique?  Why is Cisco at odds with Melvin?  There is actually a lot
of potential material that could have been explored, but it seems that
no effort is made to go in that direction, and instead we are given a
not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners, silly sight gags,
extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery.</P>
<P>And, I haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want
them to separate, nor Melvin's mistress, nor the pimple-faced video
clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on.  If
The Big Hit signals the future of Hong Kong style movies that are made
for American audiences, then shoot me now.</P>
