<P>HC:  Hello, and welcome back to the ballpark.  I'm your play-by-play 
     announcer Harry Canary, and joining me in the broadcast booth for 
     today's game is our guest color man, James Berardinelli.  Can I call 
     ya Jim? </P>
<PRE>JB:  No. </PRE>
<P>HC:  Okay, Jim.  If you don't mind my saying, you seem a little on the 
     grumpy side today.  Care to share with the listening audience why? </P>
<P>JB:  Take a look who's coming up to bat, and you'll understand. </P>
<PRE>HC:  That would be our first hitter of the day, the new Walt Disney movie 
     ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD.  From the same company that made THE LION 
     KING. </PRE>
<P>JB:  Hard to believe.  Any time Disney tries their hand at live action, 
     though, the results are usually pretty poor.  Just not this bad. </P>
<P>HC:  So, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD stands in the box.  I have to admit, Jim, 
     it doesn't look too good from where I'm sitting. </P>
<P>JB:  Yeah.  Check out the premise.  Some young kid named Roger (played by 
     Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is left at a temporary foster care home by a 
     father who says they can be a family again when the California 
     Angels win the pennant.  So, naturally, Roger starts praying for 
     that.  Presto!  Angels, led by the irrepressible Al (played by 
     Christopher Lloyd) appear, and the team starts winning in the most 
     amazing ways.  The crusty manager of the Angels, George Knox (played 
     by Danny Glover) can't believe what he's seeing as his team begins 
     the inevitable trek from worst to first. </P>
<PRE>HC:  Well, as bad as this film may look on the surface, let's see how it 
     performs on the field.  And here's the first pitch... Strike One!  
     Boy that one really had ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD fooled.  It didn't 
     have any idea where the ball was headed. </PRE>
<P>JB:  That's not the only thing it doesn't have any idea about.  For a 
     baseball movie, the script shows an amazing lack of fundamental 
     knowledge about the game.  Every sports aficionado knows that the 
     "Injured Reserve List" is not a baseball term.  In this sport, it's 
     called the "Disabled List."  Such simple, basic mistakes rankle.  
     And there are lots of them. </P>
<P>HC:  Well, at least ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD gets the clubhouse spirit 
     right, doesn't it? </P>
<P>JB:  No.  This is somebody's idea of what it might be like in a rowdy 
     clubhouse, and bears no resemblance to anything real.  Sure, the 
     film is basically a fantasy, but its depiction of the reality it 
     wants to be grounded in is ludicrous. </P>
<PRE>HC:  Okay.  Well, the pitcher's in his windup, and here's the second 
     pitch to ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD.  Strike two!  And this movie's in 
     the hole, oh-and-two. </PRE>
<P>JB:  It's in a deeper hole than that.  There's so much wrong that it will 
     be difficult to cover everything in the course of a single at-bat. </P>
<PRE>HC:  Try. </PRE>
<P>JB:  Take the ending.  It's so sweet, it makes you want to gag.  Then 
     there's the film's view on religion.  The screenwriters want to use 
     angels--which are spiritual creatures by nature--but they don't 
     want to offend anyone, so they come up with some namby-pamby, broad, 
     meaningless definition of God and His or Her minions. </P>
<PRE>HC:  Sounds pretty weak to me. </PRE>
<P>JB:  Then there's the acting.  Suffice it to say that Tony Danza gives 
     one of the most "impressive" performances, and young Joseph Gordon-
     Levitt has serious credibility problems.  Danny Glover looks 
     embarrassed. </P>
<P>HC:  Forgive me for asking this, but why bother going to a movie that's 
     this bad?  I mean, you obviously couldn't have known for sure 
     beforehand, but the previews look pretty dumb. </P>
<P>JB:  I always like to give baseball movies a chance.  Every once in a 
     while, something decent comes along, like EIGHT MEN OUT.  
     Unfortunately, that was a few years ago. </P>
<P>HC:  Okay.  Well, the pitcher's back into his windup, and here's the next 
     pitch.  Swing and a miss.  Strike Three!  And ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD 
     is outta there on three straight strikes. </P>
<P>JB:  No more than it deserves, and if I have to sit through another bad 
     baseball movie, I'll...<mutters>. </P>
<PRE>HC:  Well, speak of the devil.  That'll bring to the plate our next 
     batter, LITTLE BIG LEAGUE.  Maybe you can give us a word or two on 
     that film, Jim.  Uh, Jim?  Calm down, now.  Take it easy.  Uh oh.  
     Somebody warn the projectionist!  He's got a bat! </PRE>
