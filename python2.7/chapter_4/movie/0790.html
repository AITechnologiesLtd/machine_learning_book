<PRE>                                    GHOST
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Patrick Swayze as a yuppie sort of
     ghost trying to save the life of his girlfriend (Demi Moore)
     with the help of a not-so-fake medium (Whoopi Goldberg).
     This is a slick film with a few nice moments, but not a great
     ghost story.  Rating: +1.</PRE>
<P>     Things were going really well for Sam Wheat (played by Patrick Swayze).
He had a great new yuppie apartment reclaimed from a really ugly building.
He had a live-in roommate who would have looked like Demi Moore if she would
only have let her hair grow a little.  She is Molly Jensen (played by Demi
Moore).  He had a high-paying job as some sort of funds executive at a major
bank.  His only problem was that he had a stupid name like "Sam Wheat."
Then it all sours when he is killed by a hood on the street and has to get
used to being dead.  You know, it is not all pranks and chains being a
ghost.  First of all, there are very few people who can hear ghosts and who
want to admit they can hear ghosts.  Then you have a really hard time
interacting with matter.  Generally you go right through matter: walls,
tables, doors, subway trains ... it makes no difference.  Floors seem to
stop you but, hey, who wants to invest in a film about a dead bank executive
falling to the center of the earth, right?  Anyway, there is more to Wheat's
killing than  meets the eye and his ghost wants to find out what it is.  His
first big break is finding a kooky spiritualist medium who thinks she is a
fake until she starts hearing the voice of one real ghost.  Oda Mae Brown
(played by Whoopi Goldberg) wants nothing to do with Sam and her newly found
powers.</P>
<P>     Bruce Joel Rubin's script in the hands of Jerry Zucker (who co-wrote
KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and co-directed AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN) has some
nice shifts in mood.  These shifts from somber to funny have been criticized
by some critics, but given the subject matter are not unbelievable until the
last five minutes or so.  The ending is saccharine, not unexpectedly, but up
to that point the film's tone follows Wheat's emotions at being dead and,
let's face it, finding yourself dead is one of life's more difficult
moments.  Zucker did not have many somber moments in his previous films but
he handles them well.  There is also a nice erotic scene with clay
sculpture.  There is another love scene that might have broken new ground
for a major release film had Zucker not copped out (much to the indignation
of the audience).  There is also a rather unexpected and nice scene
involving a grungy subway rider.</P>
<P>     GHOST is not really very good as a ghost story.  There is maybe one
decent chilling scene in the film.  Next to LADY IN WHITE or THE UNINVITED
it pales considerably.  But it is reasonable as a slick Hollywood production
with (of course) effects by Industrial Light and Magic.  I rate it a +1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
