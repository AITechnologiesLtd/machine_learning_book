<P>   Are you familiar with the song, "Friendship, friendship,/ Just a
perfect blendship,/ When other friendships have been forgot,/
Ours will still be hot"?  Presumably the composer meant the ditty
to be taken optimistically.  We're regularly inundated with self-
help gurus who tell us that having friends is the most important
thing in the world, and perhaps they're right.  But perhaps not.  If
familiarity breeds contempt, how about a familiarity that carries
with it some profound resentment that one fellow has toward the
other...even for an alleged event that occurred ten years
previously while the two guys were in senior year of high school?</P>
<P>   "Tape," a photographed play sometimes marred by dizzying
camera pans and directed by Richard Linklater--is a film
completely different in imaginative scope from Linklater's
"Waking Life" and far more confined than his "Dazed and
Confused" and "Slacker." Nonetheless the story is intermittently
involving because the performers, operating in 86 minutes of real
time, keep the heat up.  Considering that the particular bitterness
that fuels the rage of 28-year-old Vince (Ethan Hawke) appears
trivial to anyone who looks at the decade-old event in
perspective, Hawke provokes the theater audience to become
disgusted with his immature ways.  As his foil Robert Sean
Leonard performs in the role of Johnny, a young man who is in
Lansing to introduce his new film to an audience at the city's film
festival.  Vince has come from Oakland for the weekend
presumably to support John's film, and when they meet--after we
watch Vince bounce around the room like a kid who forgot his
Ritalin--he appears overjoyed to see his buddy.  After some
backslapping, the two show themselves to be opposites in
temperament.  While Vince, an unsuccessful, callow
adult who is a low-level drug dealer and volunteer firefighter is
full of off-the-wall physical activity, John is still pretty much the
shy goody-two-shoes he was in his high school days.  The
friendship between the two seems as unlikely as the bonding
between Joe and Terry in Barry Levinson's movie "Bandits."</P>
<P>   Both men are flawed characters.  The outwardly saintly Johnny
lectures Vince that the latter should get it together and change
his life, a discourse that only increases Vince's negative feelings
toward his less demonstrative friend.  Determined to have the
last word, Vince hammers at the goody-goody--who had stolen
the affections of Vince's girl friend Amy (Uma Thurman) in senior
year.  Vince sees his opportunity to shatter the lofty self-image of
his "friend" by making him confess to a criminal act committed
against the girl by Johnny.
   Ethan Hawke, fresh from a spellbinding role as the naive rookie
to Denzel Washington's experienced detective in "Training Day,"
stretches his talent in yet another film that takes place during a
single day.  Where Hawke is the nice kid whose corruptibility is
test in Antoine Fuqua's big-budget movie, in this claustrophobic
play he's a seedy guy with no ambition who is severely testing
his buddy's character, determined to keep the upper hand and
crush the spirit of the person who stole his girl.  Uma Thurman,
playing the role of Amy and showing up in the motel room after
the tension is immediately palpable, sizes up the situation and,
smart person that she is sets the two straight.</P>
<P>  "Tape" plays out the quintessential definition of theater: two or
more people figuratively (or literally) locked in a small location to
deal with their conflicts.  As a staged play it does not compare in
variety or interest with John Swanbeck's three-character "The Big
Kahuna"--from Roger Rueff's play "Hospitality Suite about two
world-weary salesmen and a naive young colleague at an out-of-
town convention.  Neither Hawke nor Leonard can compare with
Kevin Spacey or Danny DeVito.  Isn't it difficult to believe that
Johnny would masochistically stay in the room with the drug-and-
beer-intoxicated Vince rather than  walk out a half hour before he
does?  "Tape" holds us through its high-voltage in tension but is
weak in credibility, wit and style.</P>
