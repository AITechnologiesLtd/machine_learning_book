<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)  80m</P>
<P>Those who like to collect SOUTH PARK sound bites for their web pages will 
have their work cut out for them here.  See it with an audience of fans and 
you'll know what I mean - nearly every line gets a response.  It's a rare 
thing for an animated feature to be more dependent on the script than the 
animation itself, but that's pretty much the case here.  SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, 
LONGER AND UNCUT is the feature version of the hit cable TV series, and is 
really quite groundbreaking as animated features go, managing to attract the 
attention of mainstream boxoffice with scrappy, alternative material.  
Whether it ever screens on television in any form is another matter 
completely - this is the worst of the TV show's regular offenses taken to 
the nth degree.  Its two most puerile and irritating characters (a flatulent 
duo named Terrance and Philip) are the catalyst for the plot, which involves 
the South Park Elementary School kids sneaking into an R-rated movie and 
emerging with their vocabulary expanded considerably.  The mothers of the 
children -  this is trash imitating life, folks - immediately ask for 
reprisals to be taken against the film.  Of course these are the charges 
that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been answering for months, and 
this is their magnificently infantile response.  I won't get into any 
polemic about how SOUTH PARK is setting a bad example for children, because 
as long as there have been cartoons there have always been sad individuals 
unable to grasp the concept of animation being an adult entertainment form, 
and the argument is pointless before it has even begun.  Nuff said.</P>
<P>SOUTH PARK is a riot (one line about menstruation kept me laughing for over 
a minute) but, as is usually the case, its humor is an acquired taste and it 
does help if you are familiar with the characters.  The pretext for getting 
all the children suddenly swearing is a logical one, given the absence of 
R-rated language in the television series (even though we all knew they were 
capable of it).  For the first half hour it's funny, but then too much 
weight is placed on this one idea as the film's central gag.  As is often 
the case with this sort of thing, the initial shock/humor of seeing the 
grade-schoolers using coarse language becomes routine with overuse.  It 
wouldn't have been self-censoring of Parker and Stone to have edited quite a 
bit of the 'R' language out, especially in the film's second half.  There 
would have been enough concessions included for series followers to 
compensate: Kenny's weekly death scene goes beyond the show's standard 
cut-out animation style into a fluid, three-dimensional afterlife; Cartman 
gets a reprise of his well-known pejorative ditty about Kyle's mother; 
there's some truly appalling and tasteless attacks on Saddam Hussein (but he 
deserves it, the jerk); and one unexpected semi-serious moment involving 
Kenny near the film's conclusion (which includes a line from BEAVIS AND 
BUTT-HEAD creator Mike Judge).  And then of course there are the songs.  As 
tiresome as these may seem in the Disney films and their imitators (which 
always slow the plot down with some sappy number in the hopes of netting an 
Oscar), in SOUTH PARK they are suitably short, funny and punchy, including a 
LES MISERABLES spoof and a zinger directed at those introspective, 
soul-searching ballad-monologues (featuring Satan). Surprisingly the songs 
are pretty good (My favorites would be the opening track and 'Just Say 
Mm'Kay').  It's too bad they won't be nominated for any Oscars though.  I 
would have loved to have seen the Terrance and Philip number performed at 
the Academy Awards.</P>
