<PRE>WAG THE DOG (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Barry Levinson
Writers: David Mamet and Hilary Menken (based on the novel "American
Hero" by Larry Beinhert)
Starring: Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Anne Heche, Denis Leary, Willie
Nelson, Kirsten Dunst, William H. Macy, Craig T. Nelson, Woody
Harrelson, David Koechner, Harland Williams, James Belushi, Jay Leno</P>
<P>Before I saw this film, I thought that films like this weren't even made
anymore.  You know: the comedy that causes you to laugh the whole time,
but contains another level to it that might even creep you out to think
about.  While we're laughing hysterically at it, we can't help have a
couple moments pause to think about how truthful this whole film is.  I
mean, thanks to Oliver Stone, we all know that the government lies to us
- but this film expounds on that idea to say that not only does the
government lie to us, but the media, whom we usually trust, helps them
out.</P>
<P>In this film, the President (of the United States) has eleven days until
election day, and it has just been discovered that he did some hanky
panky with a "Firefly Girl," opening up a huge scandal that could
obviously destroy him (in fact, the other Presidential candidate, played
by Craig T. Nelson, starts airing campaign commercials featuring that
Maurie Chevalier classic, "Thank Heaven for Little Girls").  So the
White House staff calls for Conrad Breen (Robert DeNiro) to help them
out.</P>
<P>Conrad is the best spin doctor in the business, and is capable of coming
up with wacky yet plausible lies to cover up almost any scandal.  But,
teamed with presidential aide Winifred Ames (Anne Heche), he goes to
Hollywood for help, as this one's a little hard to do.  He journeys to
the mansion of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman, tanned
to the brim) to help him produce a war, which is to be against Albania
because those darn Albanians are apparently harboring a nuclear weapon
in Canada that is about to make its way to the states...or so Conrad
says.</P>
<P>With Stanley, the three begin to stage a war, since war is not really
about killing, but about marketing.  Civilian americans are never on the
battlefront, and rely on the media to alert them about it, so why not
use the medium against them, and to not only distract the new scandal
from the president, but also make him out to be a hero.  For a war, you
need a small motive, some news coverage, a song(s), catch phrases, and a
hero left behind.  And not only do these liars need to convince the
American people, but also the other branches of government.</P>
<P>The story, however, does sound a bit gimmicky.  It could be just a bunch
of lies about one thing, and the story goes absolutely nowhere.  But the
story is always moving, with lots of wacky problems thrown the way of
our "heroes."  The story is smart, and that's why we have an encounter
with some CIA men (led by William H. Macy), a huge twist in mid-story
which would defeat most spin doctors, and even a hilarious problem
towards the end, which actually ends up helping them out more.</P>
<P>The script is hysterical, no shock since it's co-written by David Mamet
(a god among playwrights).  He has always been a connosieur of writing
great dialogue, and here is no exception.  In fact, he writes more great
one-liners and zingers than you can shake a stick at.  Every line is
intelligently written, and sounds exactly like something the respective
character would say...something that is often taken advantage of in
modern films.  I hope he and Hilary Menken, the other co-writer get
nominated.  </P>
<P>And the acting is brilliant.  DeNiro, who can play virtually any role,
is amazing as the schming Conrad who is payed to lie through other
people's teeth.  He has so much energy in his performance, and he's
brilliant with others (this might actually be his best performance in
the, like, thousand films he's in that are being released around now). 
Hoffman pretty much steals the film though, and might get an Oscar
nomination out of this.  He also has a ton of energy, albeit of a
different kind, and when he goes off on rants of creativity, coming up
with slogans and various ideas, it's true magic (his catch phrase: "This
isn't a problem," which is used for any size of problem that befalls our
protagonists).  And Heche holds her own between the two deities, showing
she's a great actress, and has a knack for comedy (her scene with DeNiro
and Macy is hilarious).</P>
<P>In the supporting cast, Denis Leary is predicatbly hysterical as the Fad
King, a great liar/friend of Hoffman's, who shows up to come up with
lies for the story.  He and Hoffman have great chemistry in several
scenes.  Willie Nelson shows up as - you guessed it - a drunken hick
song writer, and is hilarious.  Child actor Kirsten Dunst ("Interview
with the Vampire") has a small role as an actress playing in the one
news clip they make of war in Albania, and is pretty funny, as is Macy,
who plays more of an intelligent man than the trailers hinted at (his
line "When the fit hits the sham, somebody's gonna have to stay after
school" hints at another wacko role from him).  And Woody Harrelson is
just ingenius as the "war hero" Sgt. William Schuman, who turns out to
be a little...off kilter.  And look for a cameo from Harland "Rocketman"
Williams.</P>
<P>Director Barry Levinson, who's not had a good film since "Bugsy," which
was years ago, causes things to move slowly at first, but to pick up
eventually into mad camp, all while remaining plausible.  Although there
are times when I would have preferred more wackiness (his use of
acoustic music at times is kind of distracting), but he has a knack for
comic direction, and even makes things seem a little bit
documentary-like with quick close-ups and what-not, giving this a feel
that it's what's really happening, not some war.  I was very scared that
the director of such "gems" like "Toys" and "Sleepers" (the former which
was pointless; the latter which bored me to tears), but then again, this
is the same director of such real gems as "Diner" and "Rainman."  Now I
respect him again.</P>
<P>But the real greatness of "Wag the Dog" is the overall feel.  I laughed
the whole way through the film, and in between the laughs, I thought
that if looked at another way, this could be serious as hell.  We laugh
at the absurdity of everything (not to mention some truly funny lines
that are funny no matter what), but the thing is this film is probably
not absurd in the slightest.  I have no doubt that the character of
Conrad Breens is based on a real spin doctor.  I'm completely sure that
somewhere in Hollywood is a Stanley Motss.  This film hits so close to
home that it kind of scared me, making me realize that a lot of what
I've heard about politics may be as fabricated as the lies these
characters make up.</P>
<P>After all, we only hear things through the news.  And the news only
hears things from other mediums.  Are the people who are controlling
what we see people we've never even heard of?  These are people who make
lies up but can never take credit for it or they will endanger the
morale of our country.  We never find out if everything this film says
is true (even a final joke may or may not be fabricated), and that's the
point.</P>
<P>Although there are some slight flaws in the film, "Wag the Dog" is one
of the funniest and most satirical films I've seen in decades.  Though
it does not have the extreme bite of Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" or the
lenghty discussion-making of Ashby's "Being There," it is still a film
that will go down in history as one of the most intelligent and
brilliant satires of all time.  Though that may not seem so now, it's
still one of the best of the year, as well as one of the funniest.</P>
