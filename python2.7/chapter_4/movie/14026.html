<P>   "Rounders" is to poker what "Without Limits" is to track. 
Both deal with sports and particularly with the passion of
those who revel in their practice.  You can lose weight with
running, your shirt and then some with the card game.  While
Steve Prefontaine's competitions take place outdoors, its
sportsmen seeking the inside track, car sharp Mike
McDermott's (Matt Damon) are indoors, its players tracking a
sporting chance.  "Rounders," which is directed by John Dahl
("Red Rock West," "The Last Seduction"), is photographed
largely in red giving it the same noir ambiance of Dahl's other
films.  The story has a fairly pronounced narration throughout
by its principal character, who relates the nature of the game
in the flat, matter-of-fact tones of the genre, a deep contrast
with the excitable timbre common to announcers of outside
sports. </P>
<P>   As the film gets under way, you being to think, What is this
really about?  Is it about friendship?  It is, to an extent.  Is it
about passion?  That it is, decidedly so--you're convinced of
that when you hear law professor Petrovsky (Martin Landau)
mentor his poker-playing student: "We cannot run away from
who we are...Our destiny chooses us."  Mike is attending law
school, but barely takes time to prepare his mock cases.  His
destiny is written in the cards, not in pursuing the legal
profession.  But even more, the movie is not about these Big
Issues but is rather an intensely focussed meditation on the
game of poker written by two men (David Koppelman and
David Levien) who either have an obsession with the game
or, having investigated some of the underground and above-
board sites, found the subject a worthwhile one to pursue. 
Although a sizable chunk of the movie is taken up with
shuffling and dealing, conning and stinging, you don't really
have to know the rules or even have an enthusiasm for
gambling.  Not that it's suspenseful.  The conclusion is as
predictable as the final victory of a champ in any movie about
competing.  Instead, "Rounders" provides the evidence that
poker is NOT a game of luck but almost totally a contest of
skill.  What more proof do we need than to witness the same
players returning to the world series of card playing year after
year?</P>
<P>   The story opens in New York on Mike McDermott, attending
law school together with his live-in girl friend Jo (Gretchen
Mol).  Hearing that his bosom buddy and scam artist Worm
(Edward Norton) is to be released from jail, he picks him up
and resists Worm's pleas to return to playing high-stakes
poker.  Refusing at first, as he had lost his tuition money to
Russian mafia kingpin Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), he
succumbs against the strong counsel of his girl friend and of
his mentor Joey Knish (John Turturro), enters into a shady
partnership with his pal to skin the tourists in places like
Atlantic City's Taj Mahal, and being the good buddy he is,
vouches for a large loan which the gangsters make to Worm. 
The greater part of the film deals not with his deteriorating
relationship with the lovely Jo or with his involvement in law
school where he appears to do not homework or attend any
classes. Rather it delves deeply into the subculture of poker.</P>
<P>   Audience members without a scorecard may find
themselves begging for subtitles, as the dialogue includes a
rich vocabulary of jargon.  Everyone knows that a full house is
also called a boat, and that fold means that you are
surrendering your hand.  But how many viewers will
understand terms like checks, blinds, base deals, road shows,
Fourth Street, Greek dealer, Grinder, It, Kansas City and
Maniac?  There must be more esoteric terms in poker than
Gray had to describe the bones and muscles of the body in
his "Anatomy," but never mind.  You'll enjoy the superlative
acting of Matt Damon, whose dimensions are tested and
found in abundance here far more than they appear in his
smaller role in "Saving Private Ryan."  </P>
<P>   "Rounders" (the term means "hustlers" but refers here to
wholly committed poker players) is a small movie with small
pleasures whose principal rewards are the an increased
respect for the skill involved in its sport and its shady,
sometimes droll depiction of the milieu of its gamblers.  The
world champion poker player appears in a cameo in a movie
which, despite its portrayal of passion is diverting rather than
uplifting and one which does not look with a patronizing air at
a guy who seems to be self-destructing with his passion for
the deal.</P>
