<PRE>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
*** OF **** grade is B-</PRE>
<P>There was once a time when drugs were funny, Cheech and Chong are living
proof of this.  I was reminded of this as I watched Thompson's alter ego
Raoul Duke (Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro) try to walk into a
hotel on a psychedelic mix of acid, mescaline, ether, cocaine, and
alcohol.  Seeing Depp react as a hotel lobby lady's face distorts and
contorts into a ghastly beast and wondering if you have to be on drugs
to think the Casino carpets are weird.  The first half of this film has
many such laughs.</P>
<P>Depp and Del Toro are on an assignment in Las Vegas in search of a story
they never follow up, and mostly staying high on drugs and trashing
everything in their path.  Depp talks with longing of San Francisco
"great" acid trips and his cigarette holder dangling from his lips while
his equally strung out lawyer gives his professional advise like, "As
your lawyer I suggest you take two hits out of the brown case." </P>
<P>The film's look is that of a frenzied trip.  Wide lenses and distortions
in showing Las Vegas and the hallucinations the characters have while
looking at everyday objects.  The cinematography is off the wall, wacky
as the camera spins out of control with the characters.  Different
lighting and colored editing processes are also used generously to
compliment the acting and unusual state of mind required.</P>
<P>There is one moment of pure genius as Thompson drives down the road at
an incredible rate after consuming mass of drugs and skipping on his
hotel bill.  A highway patrolman flashes his lights and pulls up to him
telling him to pull over.  Instead he leads him on a chase while playing
with the expectations of the cop and narrating that it gives the cop
some excitement and he would prefer chasing him rather than him getting
nervous and pulling over immediately.  This leads to a huge laugh.</P>
<P>I don't know how the public will react to this film.  The critics seem
to love it or hate it and the constant drug use is raising some
controversy and hatred towards the film.  I am giving the film a
marginal recommendation but the film is definitely not for everyone and
may rely on if you think drugs are or could be funny.  Those not
familiar with the book or Thompson may have trouble deciphering the
action.  Others can sit back and expect to see a wacky film that will
have you see the world in a frenzied light for hours after.</P>
