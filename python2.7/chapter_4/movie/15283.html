A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Brett Leonard</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Andrew Gellis, Jeanne Rosenberg, adapted from a story by Andrew Gellis
and David Young</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Young girl ignored by her father, daydreaming, dinosaurs,
meteor shower, 3-D vistas, landscapes, effects</P>
<PRE>Starring: Liz Stauber, Peter Horton</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
In this 3-D (IMAX) film, a girl named Ally (Liz Stauber) is ignored by
her paleontologist father Dr. Hayden (Peter Horton) who works at a
dinosaur museum. One day, she visits him while he is working after
hours. Ally gets lost in the big museum and has daydreams in which she
sees real dinosaurs and meets up with historical figures in dinosaur
research who encourage her to form her own theories.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Kids under 5 might find big animals too scary, and kids over 13 might
not identify with the main character, but children of grade school age
will probably like T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS because the movie's
gigantic dinosaurs and breathtaking landscapes really come alive with
the 3-D effects and huge screen. It's a good chance for a family outing.</P>
<P>No, this isn't one of those action packed Jurassic Park sequels where
hapless folks get chomped and stomped by oversized forbears of modern
birds. T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS is a children's educational flick.
The plot is more like the kind you see on public television afterschool
specials where some kid has wonderful imaginary adventures and learns a
lot, too. The theme music can be a bit repetitive, and the fragmented
daydreams don't offer much suspense, but for its young educational crowd
T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS is satisfying enough.</P>
<P>In general 3-D movie-making has a lot of untapped potential, despite
idiosyncrasies. On the negative side, directors can't do as many
fade-ins and fade-outs because it would make the audience too dizzy, and
so you would have to do the whole film with only a few main locations.
But on the plus side, 3-D would be an ideal medium for suspense films.
Headphones are used by the audience members, so the music and targeted
sound effects can be very sophisticated. And instead of using weird
camera angles (a la Alfred Hitchcock) you can create instant suspense by
showing the stalker's point of view, as he crawls around 3-D objects and
the music ratchets up the tension. Not to mention how in 3-D a direct
attack jumps right out at you. Given the targeted music and visual
angles, imagine how terrifying SILENCE OF THE LAMBS might be, especially
the scene where Jody Foster navigates the dark room where the killer is
stalking her. At any rate, advances in 3-D movie-making are something to
look out for in the future. </P>
