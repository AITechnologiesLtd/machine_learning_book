"The Prince of Egypt" Review
by Fontaine Lien

<P>"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the
sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry
land, and the waters were divided." -- Exodus 14:21</P>
<P>        It's one thing reading the Exodus chapter in a church, in a retreat, in
a classroom, or even seeing the old black and white version on TV.  It's
another *seeing* Moses take his staff, raise his eyes towards the sky, and
part the ocean.  In the DreamWorks cartoon adaptation of possibly the
most famous story of all, image is the emphasis and they do a darn good
job of emphasizing it.  For believers, this film will be a major spiritual
experience; for nonbelievers (like me), it will be two hours of magic and
jaw-dropping awe.  Suffice to say that for at least two hours, I almost
became a believer.</P>
<P>        As I said, the film's strong point is its animation.  You probably
already know that from the previews alone.  There are amazing sequences
in the film: as the Hebrews are passing through the wall of water on the
Red Sea, we briefly catch a glimpse of a whale behind the wall of
aquablue.  During one spectacular dream sequence, Moses dreams that he's
trapped in the walls of the castle, that he became one of the Egyptian
figures on the wall.   Guards chase him from corner to corner, from pillar
to pillar.  And one of my favorite scenes from the movie: when God sends a
plague to Egypt.  It originates as a sort of mini-galaxy in the sky, the
ghostly white tendrils dancing eerily across the pitch-black sky, winding
their way through town, deftly avoiding houses with the mark of lamb's
blood.  It's graceful, haunting, and solemn at the same time.  It's quiet, but
the kind of quiet we see in those shots of Paris we get before the city
gets blown up in "Armageddon."   I especially admire the way they drew
the water in this movie: from the gentle river little Moses is first placed
in, to the river that Moses/God turns into blood, to the dividing Red Sea. 
The light, too.  The light Moses is bathed in when he sees the burning bush,
the aforementioned eery whiteness of the plague.  Of course, overall the
artwork is just amazing.   I liked how they weren't trying to be too
"Disney," adding too many funny creatures.  But then again, this is a
different kind of story.  Not only was the art itself stunning, you've got to
give the director (or animator?) credit for arranging the objects to give
them symbolic meaning, sometimes obvious and sometimes not so obvious.</P>
<P>        Having said that the art is the movie's strong point, I'll have to say
that aside from the "Deliver Me" tune and much-better-than-radio-version
"When You Believe" (gracefully weaved together at the end of the movie),
most of the other song numbers don't fit in too well for me.  "You're
Playing w/ the Big Guys Now" just doesn't seem appropriate here.  This is
not another "Hercules." The score was pretty good most of the time: it
worked best when it was quiet, some of the dramatic moments were a
little distracting.  To me, it had a chant-like feel to it that is very similar
to the score of "The Lion King."  The voices were okay -- they weren't
distracting, and that's a good thing.  Val Kilmer did a great job as
Moses/God; I didn't even know that was him until later.  In fact, the only
voice I could recognize was Jeff Goldblum's, if only because he has just a
distinctive way of speaking and I've see way too many iMac commercials.  </P>
<P>        "The Prince of Egypt" is a film for adults and children alike
(possibly more for adults).  Whether you're a believer or not, you'll be
touched by the story of the people of Moses striving for freedom and
clinging steadfastedly to one single beliefe: that their God will come
through.  I don't know, sometimes I feel that religion causes nothing but
trouble in this world; hence if there are more films like this one that
reminds us of what's ultimately good and true in the teachings of religion
(i.e., the faith it instills in its believers), they are perfectly welcome in
an age where most of us are morely likely to scoff at the devoutly
religious.  What's wrong with believing in miracles?</P>
<P>"It is not the noise of the shout of victory, Nor the noise of the cry of
defeat, But the sound of singing I hear." -- Exodus 32:18</P>
<P>Rating: B+ (First viewing, 12/23/98)</P>
<P>* Is it just me, or do the mountains of Midian look kind of like the
mountains of Paramount Pictures? (Which wouldn't make sense at all,
since this isn't a Paramount Pictures film. . . )</P>
