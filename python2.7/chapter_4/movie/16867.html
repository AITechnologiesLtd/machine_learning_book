<P>Hurlyburly" (1998) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Sean Penn, Robin Wright
Penn, Kevin Spacey, Garry Shandling, Chazz Palminteri, Meg Ryan and Anna
Paquin.</P>
<P> I was taught if you can't say anything nice about something, keep your
mouth shut.</P>
<P> But that would be doing a disservice to anyone who is thinking of seeing
this sorry excuse for a motion picture.</P>
<P> On stage, David Rabe's play may be fascinating, but as a film "Hurlyburly"
is an excruiating two hours of self-absorbed narcissists doing nothing but
whining, crying, cursing and babbling about life, drugs, sex, money and
friendship.</P>
<P> It's all pretentious nonsense as these Hollywood losers snort cocaine,
drink, screw and continually blab about nothing. This movie makes an
episode of "Seinfeld" look like Chekov.</P>
<P> Even though it is fascinating watching Sean Penn seem to self-destruct,
his brave performance (which he had done earlier on stage) cannot save this
tiresome tirade of banalities.</P>
<P> Never has such a fine cast, which includes Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright
Penn, Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling and Anna Paquin, been forced to try
to do so much with so little.</P>
<P> Even the stunt casting of Meg Ryan as a hooker cannot keep this leaden
vehicle afloat.</P>
<P> Some will say that I'm a cretin because David Rabe is one of our finest
playwrights. Perhaps. But if being a cretin means applauding "Hurlyburly,"
then just consider me an uneducated lout who cannot appreciate high art.</P>
<PRE> Just remember, though, I told you so.</PRE>
