<PRE>I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>You've got to love the slasher genre's amazing productivity, despite the
lack of imagination.  It's a little like a broken factory: it keeps
churning out faulty parts, but at least it does it efficiently. With the
latest slasher sequel, clumsily and inaccurately titled I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer, it proves that you don't need fresh ideas or
an innovative script to create a movie...as long as you're not hoping
for a good one.</P>
<P>Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is still recovering from the horrific
events of I Know What You Did Last Summer, when the evil Gorton's
Fisherman, aka Ben Willis (Muse Watson), stalked and killed several of
her friends for accidentally killing (or was it not killing) him the
summer before.</P>
<P>Now, Julie is attending college, and has a whole new set of fresh meat,
uh, er, friends.  The closest of which is Karla (Brandy), who has the
disturbing habit of creeping around in the dark and making scary noises.
Julie still maintains contact with Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), another
survivor of the previous film, but he's a link to her past...one she
would rather forget.</P>
<P>But someone still remembers...three guesses who...  Yep, that's right,
Ben Willis, back from the dead.  Yawn.  He's still as bland as in the
original film, but with even less of a motive this time.  His first
several victims lack even a tangential connection to the accident which
supposedly started his murderous rage for revenge.  (Speaking of that,
why don't any of these victims ever come back from the dead to haunt
Ben?) In any case, in the new film, each time he has a shot at finally
getting even with Julie James, he tries for revenge in rather unorthodox
ways (one scene has him cursing her with a really really bad tan).</P>
<P>This time, the sequel, with a larger budget, naturally takes place in
the Carribbean (where the Gorton's Fisherman doesn't look the least out
of place).  Julie and Karla have brought their respective boyfriends,
Will (Matthew Settle) and Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), to this island paradise
right before a torrential hurricane hits.  So, naturally, aside from a
few cannon fodder hotel staff, the island is remote and deserted.  It's
the perfect place for a little mass murder.</P>
<P>The script for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was written by Trey
Callaway rather than the original's overrated Kevin Williamson.  Though
it wouldn't take much to improve quality over the first, Callaway
doesn't give it any effort, turning in a script that lacks any spark of
originality and wit.</P>
<P>Don't count on the actors to carry this film, either.   The hotel's
eclectic staff are leagues more interesting than the central foursome,
and you certainly wouldn't want to spend an entire movie with them. At
least the cast looks good (presumably their only qualification)...but
you wonder why the four of them can't take on the feeble old Ben
Willis.  I mean, even one-on-one, one of the athletic teens would likely
succeed against the guy... four-on-one would be no contest.  I guess,
then there'd be no movie (but that would actually be a good thing.)</P>
<P>This one's for die-hard genre fans only.  And even then, it's only good
to snicker at the obvious cliches and overall predictability.</P>
