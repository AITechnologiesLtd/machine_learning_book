<P>Serious actor Robert DeNiro lines up in another one of his
every-now-and-again comedy roles, satirizing a role that he knows all too
well...a mobster. This movie also co-stars every other mafia-looking actor
this side of Italy, and the seriously-looking-for-a-hit-movie actor, Billy
Crystal.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Mafia kingpin suddenly finds himself suffering from panic attacks, stress
and bouts of sadness during his everyday mob routines. He decides to help
himself, by seeing a psychiatrist. The shrink is not very willing to help
the renowned gangster during the week of his own wedding bliss, but a little
strong-arming by the kingpin's "associates", ultimately waives the doctor's
well-rooted reservations.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is a very funny movie, I mean, it's like...fuggeddaboudit! Whether or
not you enjoy mob movies, this film will have you laughing out loud during
several scenes, chuckling along to DeNiro's infantile blubbering sessions,
and re-appreciating Billy Crystal for the superior comedic actor that he is.
This movie takes a completely overdone film genre, the mob films, and mixes
it into a great script, some super performances, and an all-around good
time. It's never boring, striking jokes at every other line, and confirms
Robert DeNiro's stature as one of the greatest American actors of his
generation. The superb performance put forth by DeNiro in this movie, is one
of the main reasons that it works. You like to watch DeNiro. He has that
charisma, that look, that weighty presence that makes you want to see him in
each and every scene. He even convinces during his ultimate "breakthrough"
scene with his doctor. This man is truly an American acting legend.</P>
<P>The one thing that did surprise me about this movie was its excessive use of
obscenities. Not that I mind that one bit, it just threw me back a little
considering that it was a comedy. Having said that, another reason for the
script to work as well as it does, is because it doesn't overly parody the
mafia folks like in other comedies. It shows them as they are, violence,
swearings and all, with pointed humour laced throughout. This was the first
movie since THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (7/10) that actually had me missing
many of its lines, due to the audience's over-the-top laughter. I personally
loved the whole "Freud" scene the best, along with the hilarious remake of a
very famous scene from a very famous mafia movie. Francis would be proud!
I'm actually looking forward to seeing this movie again on video, so that I
could catch all of the lines the next time around. The light tone of the
movie and its soundtrack are additional points to director Ramis, as well as
the upbeat pacing and the solid acting. The film might not go down as well
for non-DeNiro or non-Crystal fans, but everyone else should prepare to
strap on their giggle-belts.</P>
<P>This movie's got an original premise, some convincing performances by its
leads, especially DeNiro in an atypical role, and plenty of fresh humour
sprinkled throughout its spaghettilicious body of fun. Capice??</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Billy Crystal once studied directing under the guise of legendary director
Martin Scorsese (a man Robert DeNiro knows quite well) at New York
University. Crystal is also known to have played the first openly gay
character on a network television series, "Soap".
One of the producers of this film, Jane Rosenthal, founded the Tribeca
Productions company with Robert DeNiro. Bobby received US$8Million for his
role in this film.
Born and raised in California, Lisa Kudrow attended Vassar College and
graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology, intending to pursue a career
in medical research with her father, a renowned headache specialist.
But when she returned to California after college, her passion for
performing also came back. Encouraged by her brother's good friend,
actor/comedian Jon Lovitz, she began studying improvisation, and in 1989,
became a member of the famed Los Angeles improvisational group, The
Groundlings. She claimed to be a virgin until she got married in 1995 to
French advertising exec Michel Stern. She was 31 at the time.
Joseph Viterelli was a late bloomer in his acting career. For more than 25
years he had been offered acting opportunities from producers, casting
directors, and directors, including his longtime friend, filmmaker Leo Penn.
Viterelli declined them all until 1989, when Sean Penn called and said they
were having difficulty casting a character from the Lower East Side in a
film that was shooting on location in Viterelli's old neighborhood on Mott
Street. That screen test led to a major role in Phil Joanou's STATE OF
GRACE, Viterelli's motion picture debut.
CASTING FUN: The roles of Vitti's "people" were filled in a rather more
unconventional manner. "We sort of adopted the Martin Scorsese-Bob DeNiro
method of casting when it came to the Mob roles," Ramis says. "This consists
of Bob and Marty walking the streets of Little Italy, spotting a civilian,
saying, 'Hey, that guy would look good,' and signing him up.</P>
