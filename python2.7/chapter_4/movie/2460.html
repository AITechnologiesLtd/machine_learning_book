MPAA Rating "R" (presumably for adult-themed humor)

<PRE>"What have the Irish done to make you hate us so much?"
                                - Stephen Rea to Geena Davis,
                                  when she tries to honk an
                                  Irish accent.</PRE>
<P>     ANGIE doesn't make a bit of sense.  Which is shame, considering how
likeable this Geena Davis vehicle really *is*.</P>
<P>     ANGIE is Angie Scacciapensieri (Davis), a Catholic/Italian/Brooklyn
gal with an okay boyfriend and a better job.  By day, she works for a
magazine.  By night, she dates a plumber.  (Named, what else?, Vinnie.)
The twist comes when the supposedly free-spirited Scacciapensieri gets
pregnant and doesn't want to get married.  Because, as she states,
"having a baby changes everything."  No duh.</P>
<P>     Which pits Angie against her family, her friends, and, ultimately,
herself.</P>
<P>     There's a *lot* to like about ANGIE.  There's good acting across
the board, from Mrs. Renny Harlin on down.  The
less-than-ethnic-looking Davis effortlessly carries the film.  She's a
striking actress *and*, as proven here, a dependable talent.  Some of
the better supporting players include James Gandolfini, Aida Tuturro,
and THE CRYING GAME's Stephen Rea as a love-interest.</P>
<P>     More importantly, the characters *feel* real.  As do (most of) the
situations.  The production values are good.  The timing is good.  All
in all, a very good effort.</P>
<PRE>     So what's wrong?</PRE>
<P>     ANGIE never explains Angie.  Or, if you prefer, the film never
clearly explains who Angie *is.*  We know more of what *happens* to her
anything else.  In fact, Angie goes through enough dramatic situations
to fill *three* films.  Her monologue to an incubator, alone, should
send collective estrogen levels soaring.</P>
<PRE>(Insecure men beware:  ANGIE contains extensive humor on vibrators,
                       gynecological exams, and breast feeding!  :-)</PRE>
<P>     The story skimps in a couple other places.  Angie's reason for
leaving Vinnie is never made clear.  And her truck-stop transformation
late in the film, where she cuts all her hair herself, is barely
believable.</P>
<P>     Over-playing and unintentional omissions aside, there's enough
honest humor in ANGIE to amuse anyone.  Better bits include Angie
registering into the hospital as "Angie Scotchandsoda" and a
delivery-room scene complete with A CHORUS LINE.</P>
<PRE>     All this and a healthy dose of Catholic guilt to boot! :-)</PRE>
<P>     Ultimately, ANGIE feels like a "greatest hits" compilation from a
longer, stronger movie.  The early scenes work well, but the film goes
downhill, a bit, as the drama is played increasingly hard.  Like any
compilation, it's a pleasant experience even if none of the scenes,
good or not-so-good, ever tell us who Angie really is.  Which may leave
some viewers feeling hollow.</P>
<P>NOTE:   I don't know what is a funnier example of "intended audience."
        The "stay in school" PSA shown before SUGAR HILL?  Or the weepy
        Miramax trailers shown before ANGIE? :)</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     ANGIE is a likable comic drama that benefits from
                 a good cast, good characters, and handsome production
                 values.  But some overwrought drama and a vague lead
                 character are definite demerits.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>.
