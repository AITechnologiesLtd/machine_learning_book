<PRE>TOPSY-TURVY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        About two-thirds of the way into "Topsy-Turvy," the ambitious but
ultimately disappointing new film from Mike Leigh ("Secrets & Lies"),
there's a scene which hints at what might have been.  William Gilbert, the
librettist who formed a highly successful collaboration with composer
Arthur Sullivan, is rehearsing three of his cast members in a scene from
the latest comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan.</P>
<P>        That's right: these are *the* Gilbert and Sullivan of Victorian
England, and Leigh's film is a bold departure from his grittily-realistic
social dramas that featured working class stiffs, not the toast of London's
West End.  What's notable about the scene in question, however, is that
Leigh is once again at the top of his game as a writer and director,
infusing the sequence with humor, awkwardness, repetition, silly accents,
sarcasm, disrespect, and much more besides.  Had the entire film been this
delightful, then moviegoers would be in for a treat with "Topsy-Turvy."</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, everything prior to this point, some two hours of
admittedly grand-looking screen time, has been dull as plainsong, tra la la
on one note.  There's a lot of talk, none of it particularly interesting,
and several colorful musical numbers shot unimaginatively from the Savoy
Theatre stalls.  But there's no real inspiration here, let alone drama.
Leigh himself appears to realize this, and crams enough sordid details of
his characters' private lives into the film's final 40 (of a cramp-inducing
160) minutes to pad out an entire season of "Melrose Place": Gilbert's
long-suffering wife Kitty longing for a child she can't have; Sullivan and
his mistress discussing her next abortion; the operetta's leading lady
hitting the sherry after performances, and another prominent member of the
company shooting up before.</P>
<P>        Bang bang bang bang--all four of these come at us right out of the
blue, eliciting what one Gilbert and Sullivan critic refers to as
"topsy-turvydom."</P>
<P>        Advance notices might lead you to believe that "Topsy-Turvy" is a
period piece about the making of "The Mikado" but it's not until, again,
well into the film that Lucy "Kitty" Gilbert (played by longtime Leigh
regular Leslie Manville) drags her husband along to a Japanese exhibition
where the inspiration for Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular work is
sparked.</P>
<P>        Leigh has spared no expense on the look and feel of the production
but what's missing is his trademark ability to get inside his characters.
Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner play the musical pair with authority, but
we get little insight into what made their association so successful given
that most of the film is spent with them stalemated at a creative impasse.</P>
<P>        Leigh's last three films--"Career Girls," "Secrets & Lies," and
"Naked"--were all "best film of the year" selections for me.  "Topsy-Turvy"
represents a change of direction for the director and in so doing takes us
away from what Mike Leigh does best: kitchen sink-styled slices of life
highlighted by true depth of character.  This is a "Mikado" that is sadly
missing its Yum-Yum.</P>
