<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>There are good things to be said about The Object of My Affection, and
I almost chose to focus on those rather than the negatives.  But, it's a
romantic comedy, and behind the girl-falls-in-love-with-gay-guy gimmick,
it's an often shallow film with bursts of greatness.  I knew there was a
problem when the ending became predictable after the first ten minutes;
it didn't help that nearly every scene left me emotionally unmoved.  Add
to this some truly shameless and trite moments, and you have yet another
well-acted romantic comedy that could have been much better with a
sharper script.</P>
<P>Jennifer Anniston leads the cast as Nina Borowski, a New York social
worker.  Early in the film, she meets George Hanson (Paul Rudd) a gay
elementary school teacher.  Because he's gay, he's not a threat, and
therefore it's okay for him to move in with her when he breaks up with
his long-time partner, Joley (Tim Daly).  Nina's boyfriend, Vince (John
Pankow), is an obnoxious "male" character, and apparently has no problem
with George's homosexuality, or the fact that he lives with Nina.</P>
<P>Well, Nina gets pregnant.  I thought this was going to be a minor plot
disrupter, but it wasn't:  nearly two thirds of this film has something
to do with Nina's pregnancy.  This is not good, really, because, like so
many scenes and devices in this film, it takes our attention away from
the characters and needlessly forces us think about what the characters
may or may not do.  Nina, by this point, is falling in love with George,
and she asks him to father the child with her.</P>
<P>We get the feeling that he kind of wants to do it, but he seems
unsure.  It's about this time when George meets Rodney Fraser (Nigel
Hawthorne), a theater critic who is also gay.  Rodney lives with a young
actor named Paul; George and Paul immediately find interest in one
another, and Rodney is left somewhat behind.  There are many subplots in
this film (one of them involving Nina's step-sister Constance, and her
husband, played by Alan Alda), but this is the only one of significant
potency.  Rodney is a fascinating character, and he gives Nina some
insights that are both moving and thought-provoking.  The revelations
that arise from this scene provide the film with its conclusion.</P>
<P>The one element of The Object of My Affection that is uniformly
impressive is the acting:  Jennifer Anniston is luminous and talented,
and proves versatility with this role.  Paul Rudd also has several
shining moments here, and manages to keep up with his character, who
switches personalities so frequently that it's difficult to tell who he
is by the final scene.  Tim Daly is convincing as George's ex-lover, and
Pankow does the obligatory macho-stuff as I'm sure he was instructed.  
Hawthorne, as I said, overpowers all of these performers in his few
scenes, though; this isn't necessarily a compliment, for I would have
liked to see much more of his character.</P>
<P>What displeases me about this film is the way in which writer Wendy
Wasserstein seems to have tried to keep the homosexuality from being a
gimmick; in doing this, there are plenty of "realistic" scenes of men
kissing men (you won't be complaining about In & Out after seeing this
film) and the only time anyone speaks lowly of homosexuals is when we're
supposed to dislike the character.  My least favorite scene in the film
is when Nina tells Vince that she wants George to father the child. </P>
<P>Now, I have moral problems with this scene:  this is Vince's child
we're talking about.  He has the right to be its father.  Nina's
response to Vince in this scene is cold and heartless.  On a
less-obvious level, I dislike this scene because Vince starts rambling
off anti-homosexual remarks.  Wasserstein clearly does this so the
audience will dislike him even more, but in a film where all the
characters accept homosexuality without even the slightest flinch, this
device is false and intrusive.</P>
<P>So many scenes have this quality:  they're here to serve the story, and
not the characters.  The big plot-hook here is that Nina asks George to
be the father of her child, and that he falls in love with another man
without telling her.  This kind of plotting might have worked, if I had
felt that director Nicholas Hytner was as interested in the characters
as in the plot.  Alas, I do not, because characters here often have to
do things that don't fit their personalities just so other things can
eventually happen.  </P>
<P>This is one of those films hell-bent on getting to the happy,
"unpredictable" conclusion, regardless of how it must contort the
characters in the process.  And, ironically, the final scenes of The
Object of My Affection are of the least satisfying in the film. 
Everything works out so well for all the characters that I wondered why
I was concerned to begin with.  This isn't a bad film, mind you--there
are good scenes here (everything with Hawthorne, for instance), and the
acting makes the picture worth enduring.  But it's a staged and
predictable film, and just isn't what I was hoping to see.</P>
