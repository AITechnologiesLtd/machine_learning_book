<P>   What good father doesn't want the best for his kids?  At
times, though, you might have a difficult time separating what
a parent is doing altruistically for his children from what he is
doing to fulfill his own shattered dreams--a way to restore his
self-respect and his prestige with the outside world.  "Price of
Glory," whose sound track features some exciting and
appropriate Latino music such as "Grita de Alegria"
performed by Quetzal and "Cumbia Raza" performed by Los
Lobos, is a hard-hitting, action-packed and drama-filled movie
about a dad who could have been a contender.  Jimmy Smits
inhabits the role of Arturo Ortega, a Mexican-American who
entered the boxing ring in Mariposa, Arizona during his teens
as a way out of the ghetto, but after suffering one particularly
crushing defeat had to give up his wishes.  He gets another
chance to restore the family glory by becoming the trainer of
his three sons, who are introduced to us early on and whose
roles are soon taken by others when director Carlos Avila
moves ahead ten years.</P>
<P>   When Arturo's children Sonny, Jimmy and Johnny Ortega
begin sparring in what appears to be a little league-style
introduction to the sport, Arturo is in his splendor.  Expecting
all three of his boys to become champs, he is especially hard
on Jimmy, who is not as adept or willing to follow the older
man's instructions.  Arturo's differing treatments of his three
sons become largely responsible for the boys' distinct
personalities and as they hit their late teens and early
twenties, Sonny (Jon Seda), comes on as the most promising
of the new boxers, while Jimmy (Clifton Collins Jr.) turns into
the family rebel and Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez) enhances
his dad's image as the most obedient son.</P>
<P>    "Price of Glory," which was written by former New York
Times sportswriter Phil Berger--whose output includes a book
about Mike Tyson and the shaping up of autobiographies by
Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes.  His familiarity with the sport
comes across throughout the movie, as he tackles the roles
of managers, trainers, and referees and gives us a view of
the temperaments of the pugilists, particularly one villainous
opponent, Davey Lane (Louis Mandylor) in a middleweight
title bout that forms the dramatic climax of the tale.  Despite
the excitement generated by the soundtrack and the swiftly
paced action of the drama, the movie lacks virtually any trace
of originality.  The supportive wife, Rita (Maria del Mar) is
there for her man when he needs her, and turns away
dutifully and predictably from the ring whenever her boy,
Sonny is getting hurt, as Sonny's wife, Mariella (Danielle
Carnastra) sheds a tear and leans empathetically on her
mother-in-law's shoulder.  =</P>
<P>   The film is well acted throughout, furthered by the actual
boxing career of Jon Seda, who punches a bag like the
Golden Gloves battler that he was.  Jimmy Smits is
particularly riveting in the role of the father who seems
unaware that his absolute control over the training of his kids
is compensation for his own boyhood defeats.  What is not at
all easy to believe is that the man would turn down an offer
of half a million dollars by the shark-like promoter, Nick
Everson (Ron Perlman) in return for allowing him to advance
the fight, but even discounting the lack of credibility at times,
"Price of Glory" suffers in its shortage of originality.  Absent
the excitement generated by the powerful theater speakers
as they pound out the Latino music, what we have is not
much more than a made-for-TV film.</P>
