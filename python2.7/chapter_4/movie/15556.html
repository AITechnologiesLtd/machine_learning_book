<P>Thirty-eight years after the original release of Alfred Hitchcock's
classic thriller PSYCHO, director Gus Van Sant, best known for his
Oscar nominated film GOOD WILL HUNTING (7.5/10), takes on the task of
recreating an exact "replica" of the film, with up-to-date actors,
color film stock instead of black & white, and a few minor changes. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Marion Crane decides to rob $400,000 from her employer in order to help
her lover get out of debt. She leaves town, but unexpectedly gets
caught in a rainstorm, and must stop off at the Bates Motel for a
night. This is where she meets Norman Bates, the owner of said
establishment. Norman operates the motel and takes care of his ill
mother. They talk and eat, after which she goes off to take a shower.
Thrilling moments ensue, as a private detective, Marion's lover and
sister all get involved in a mystery.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Slow, well-manufactured film with solid performances by its leads,
doesn't have enough tension to be qualified a real thriller, and
basically makes you question its remake in the first place. This film
has some good moments, many long-winded scenes, an excellent eye for
style and great performances by actors who basically had to recreate
characters that were considered historical in the eyes of many
movie-goers. The one actor who stood out from the pack was definitely
the rising star of the year, Vince Vaughn, who took Anthony Perkins'
superb original performance, and added his own macabre touch of
surrealism.</P>
<P>The directing of this film was basically a "shot-for-shot" remake of
the original, and therein, remained extremely stylish and original, in
classic Hitchcock style. Van Sant did take some initiative in regards
to little changes here and there, but on the whole, the film still
played like it could have been set in the 50's or 60's. Having said
that, the film's main peg of disinterest for me was its slow pace and
even slower build-up. I guess I have just gotten used to the greater
quantity of thrills in the thrillers of nowaday, and just didn't
appreciate the snails pace build-up of this story in respect to its end
result.</P>
<P>Having said that, this film might be better appreciated by those who
never saw the original, since they would not be privy to the film's
basic story line and twist, allowing for a greater interest in the
mystery of the whole thing. All in all, the film does offer some great
performances by its actors, with Vaughn offering another standout
performance, some stylish cinematography, but ultimately runs at too
slow a pace, without offering enough real thrills, to keep me
interested. I think my good friend The Arrow said it best when he
turned to me at the end of this film and said "Unnecessary. Why not
re-release the original instead of this?" No real improvement, no real
surprises, just a recreation of a film that played very well in its
original state in the 60's, but suffers somewhat in its imitation form
of the 90's.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This new PSYCHO was shot at the same studio as the original and used
the same compressed six-week schedule. The film cost $20 million
compared to the $800,000 that Hitchcock spent on the original in 1960.
Director Gus Van Sant also makes a cameo in the film during the same
scene that Hitchcock himself made an appearance over 30 years ago. He
also thanks fellow director John Woo for the use of his "kitchen knife"
in the end credits of this film, and was one of the executive producers
on the 1995 film KIDS (8/10).
Nicole Kidman turned down the role that eventually went to Anne Heche
in this picture.
The bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, makes an appearance in
this film as Viggo Mortensen's co-worker. He also played a part in Gus
Van Sant's classic pic MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO (7.5/10), which starred
Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, and rode in the ambulance alongside
River, on the night that he died from a drug overdose. His real name is
Michael Balzary, and he was born in Australia.
Vince Vaughn stands 6"5. When asked about the last time that he cried,
Vince offered this little anecdote: "When I was a small, small child,
Elvis was passing through Evanston, getting a hamburger. And he bought
me and my mama one. And he said, "Son, you've got a twinkle in your
eye, don't let anybody tell you that you can't do this. And that was
the last time I cried." Vaughn's big break came when he appeared in a
nationally televised Chevrolet commercial in 1989. Steven Spielberg was
impressed with Vaughn's performance in SWINGERS (8.5/10), after he saw
a tape of the film when the film's producers approached him about the
possibility of using the theme music from JAWS (7.5/10) for a scene in
which Vaughn's Trent cozies up to an unsuspecting young woman at a
party. Spielberg liked him enough to cast him in the monster hit THE
LOST WORLD (7/10).
Julianne Moore's real name is Julie Anne Smith.
Actress Rita Wilson, who plays the other secretary in this film, is Tom
Hanks' wife in real life.</P>
