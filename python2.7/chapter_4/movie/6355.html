<PRE>                            VIRTUOSITY
                    A film review by Joe Clark
                     Copyright 1996 Joe Clark</PRE>
<PRE>                    Pervertuosity with Denz 'n' Russ</PRE>
<P>You'd think the creators of a movie featuring both Denzel Washington
and Russell Crowe might have starstruck fags in mind, and in the case
of Virtuosity, you might be right. But prepare yourself for a slap in
the face even as the drool collects in your lap.</P>
<P>Afrikanski-Amerikanski heartthrob unit Denzel Washington plays Parker
Barnes, a murderer/ex-cop sprung from jail to track down and terminate
Sid 6.7, a composite of infamous killers' personality traits created
by a programmer named Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella, outfag actor of
Angels in America fame). Sid was devised as a virtual-reality
cop-training tool, but when the Sid project is threatened with
shutdown after a rather nasty software bug emerges, Lindenmeyer sets
Sid loose on the world with the help of nanotechnology, which turns a
virtual Sid into a real one formed from glass.</P>
<P>Sid is the real star here-- amoral and sexy, cold-blooded and
charming, murderous and fuckable. He's animated (literally) by Russell
Crowe, late of The Sum of Us; Crowe's wide-ranging acting talents
continue to impress, and the young Australian brilliantly imparts
Sid's single-minded intelligence, savoir-faire (savoir-tuer?), and
gleeful sadism. And as usual, Australians do better American accents
than Americans.</P>
<P>Sid's a bit of a rake, too-- and since he contains a dollop of Jeffrey
Dahmer, he has a way with the gents as well as the ladies. It's pretty
subtle-- a peck on the cheek; a remark that Denzel Washington is on
Sid's dance card; forcing a guy to strip so Sid can try on his suit--
but lighthearted and far less insidious than the rank aberrance of,
say, Scott Pritchard, the deranged queer military attache in No Way
Out. In a Van Damme-esque frisson of homoeroticism, Washington and
Crowe are both naked in the film (though not frontally); in a
shoot-'em-up movie, that's psychologically significant. (Who's the
main audience for action flicks? Guys. You figure it out.)</P>
<P>Still, Vito Russo is surely whirling in his grave at Lindenmeyer, a
stereotypical Hollywood sissy straight out of the '50s. Lindenmeyer's
faggotry is never stated outright, but we know the signs: Perennially
uptight in his three-piece suit, the friendless geek lives alone,
talks in a "typical gay voice" (is Spinella capable of any other
kind?), and jealously relishes how his creation toys with Madison
Carter (played by Kelly Lynch), a female criminologist who accompanies
Barnes on his quest for Sid. Oh, and he jerks off after conjuring a
naked Sid in the privacy of Lindenmeyer's own lab. This, we assume, is
a sign.</P>
<P>But getting all up in arms at yet another example of filmic homo
slander takes concentration, and Virtuosity's string of cinematic
references are quite enough to distract you. Early on, Denzel
Washington's dishevelment and demeanour recall his role as Steve Biko
in Cry Freedom. (What's more, Virtuosity's anticlimactic ending
mirrors that film's structure.) At one point Washington's fingers
linger over Lynch's as in Silence of the Lambs, but with the added
zing of miscegenation. Virtuosity's plot, editing and soundtrack are
Natural-Born Killers Lite. Saturday Night Fever is blatantly quoted in
a brief but funny vignette. Madison Carter is a science-fiction
reference: Edison Carter had a doppelgaenger named Max Headroom.</P>
<P>High-and-mighty Gitanes-smoking intellectual filmheads might dismiss
those quotations as a hollow pastiche, and indeed this is not The
Player, where the cavalcade of references made sense in a movie about
movies. But contrary to typical Hollywood formula, Washington and
Lynch don't get romantically involved, and for Washington there's no
happy ending. Virtuosity is a perplexing mishmash-- creative,
derivative, homoerotic, and homophobic all at once.</P>
