<P>   When I was eight years old I joined my parents on their annual
two weeks' vacation in upstate New York.  The hotel featured
nightly entertainment.  The big hit was a performance by a Dr.
Polgar, who was at that time a fairly well-known hypnotist. 
Anyway, the entire crowd was convinced that hypnotism is no
fake  when I, a little kid, got called up to the stage to stick pins
into the fingers and arms of a subject who was under the Polgar
spell. No reaction from the poor guy.  I guess everyone figured
that I couldn't be part of the act, a participant in fraud.  The
discussion that followed in the lounge centered on the question:
can a person under a spell be made to do something against his
will?</P>
<P>   In "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," two people are  made to
do two things that you wouldn't expect them to do if they retained
all their own marbles.  At a party, Insurance investigator CW
Biggs (Woody Allen) and an efficiency expert hired by his firm,
Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), fall under the spell of
hypnotist Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), each performing a
criminal act.  You'd think that they'd never do something like this
absent the hypnosis, but on second thought Woody Allen, who
wrote and directed this enchanting comedy, gives us reason to
believe that they would indeed have larceny in their hearts.</P>
<P>   However, the concept of the film--the second thing that they
unexpectedly do--is even more intriguing.  By now everyone who
has read even the most cursory primer on pop psychology knows
that the personality we project in public is often just a front, a
cover for our real selves which lie underneath.  In Mr. Allen's
view, hypnosis can shatter our veneer bringing out our true
feelings.  Two people who show terminal animosity toward each
other, fighting like cats and dogs, actually fall in love with each
other, courtesy of Voltan.</P>
<P>   The picture opens in the office of an insurance firm with Woody
Allen in the role of CW Briggs, a crack investigator of shady
claims who always gets his man.  He feels threatened, however,
when the boss, Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), hires an
efficiency expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), to upgrade
the firm's standing.  Each moment they are together they are like
oil and water, their trading of jibes, their biting repartee forming
the nucleus of the movie's wit.  When a hypnotist, Voltan (David
Ogden Stiers), drags them from the table at a company party,
putting them under the power of a jeweled jade scorpion, he
convinces the pair that they are madly in love.  When he snaps
his fingers, they return to the fray. Later, evidence from a pair of
mansion robberies seems to point to CW Briggs as the perp
rather than the investigator; and when Briggs kicks the
captivating heiress Laura Kensington (Charlize Theron) out of his
bed, everyone is convinced that something strange has
happened to the impeccably honest and hardworking
investigator.  (What's even stranger, and what seems to have
bypassed Mr. Allen's sense of logic, is that Magruder, who is
having an affair with Betty Ann, is planning to take her on a trip to
Paris...in 1940??? Good luck.)</P>
<P>   "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is not a laugh-out-loud
comedy, nor should it be judged by how many belly laughs are
evoked from the audience.  If that were the criterion, a vulgar but
often hilarious movie like "American Pie 2" would take the cake,
so to speak.  But Woody Allen's movie, so different from his
typical psychobabble study of relationships, is the year's winner
for its witty dialogue, its simultaneous homage and send-up of old
movies with their (by modern standards) artificial and self-
conscious acting and screwball buffoonery featuring keystone
cops, Veronica-Lake hair styles, and the obligatory serious
drinking and chain smoking.  Woody Allen and Helen Hunt do a
smashing job as people who see each other from the wrong end
of a telescope,  like magnets whose negative charges are placed
side by side with the potential to draw together by a simple twist
(or sleight) of hand.  The 1940's come across with the sepia
tones of Zhao Fei's lensing while the rakish costumes--the
mandatory fedoras for males and long dresses for the women--fit
right in with Santa Loquasto's design of the epoch's non-cubicled
offices.  Blink your eyes and the ravishing Charlize Theron is
Veronica Lake; close them, listen closely to the games of one-
upmanship played by Woody Allen and Helen Hunt, and you're
listening to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.  "The Curse
of the Jade Scorpion" may get its name from Chinese mythology
but in Woody Allen's vision the picture is pure Americana.</P>
