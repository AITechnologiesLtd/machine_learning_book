<P>I both loved and hated "Magnolia." Let me explain further. I've seen it twice,
and I am convinced that Paul Thomas Anderson's multilayered, mosaic character
study is the best American film of 1999. It is also a frustrating experience of
a movie because it is so filled with emotional pain and regret that it causes
one to avert their eyes from the screen in the hopes that it will all be over.
Of course, this is what life often feels like, full of regrets and pain since
we are all human and flawed. And that is what makes "Magnolia" such a cinematic
marvel to witness. </P>
<P>"Magnolia" is set in L.A. on one rainy 24 hour day. It is raining so much that
all the characters keep referring to how it is "raining like cats and dogs." We
are shown the lives of several different characters who may live on the same
street named Magnolia. There is the lonesome, clumsy cop (John C. Reilly) who
is ready for any relationship that comes his way; the elderly Earl Partridge
(Jason Robards), a wealthy man who is near death; the sympathetic nurse (Philip
Seymour Hoffman) who takes care of Earl; Earl's gold-digging wife with a
conscience (Julianne Moore); the strutting, sexed-up guru Frank T.J. Mackey
(Tom Cruise), Earl's estranged son; the tired quiz show host dying of cancer
(Philip Baker Hall); the coked-up quiz show host's daughter who loves Aimee
Mann songs (Melora Walters); the genius whiz kid (Jeremy Blackman), a
participant on the aforementioned quiz show; and finally, the lonely, pathetic
former child genius Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) who wants love and has love
to give. </P>
<P>"Magnolia" begins with an ingenious prologue about chances and coincidences in
life, told through some famous urban legends. One includes an attempted suicide
that becomes a homicide, a store clerk killed by three thieves who bear his
name, and the connection between a blackjack dealer and a pilot. The point of
these vignettes is to show how some people can come together by sheer
coincidence without knowing why or how. And, in essence, that is what
"Magnolia" is about. </P>
<P>Somehow, these people find a way of connecting to each other in ways not
imaginable to them, or at least not immediately apparent to them. The most
powerful scenes involve the heartless, cynical Frank who is the guru of
something called "Search and Destroy," demonstrating to men the various methods
on how to get laid (those scenes are as electrifying as anything Cruise has
ever done before). When Frank realizes that his father is dying, he badgers the
man verbally and then lets out an emotional cannon that is as moving as Marlon
Brando's similar moment of realization in "Last Tango in Paris." </P>
<P>Then there is the emotionally high-strung wife of Earl (Moore) who regrets
cheating on her husband and suddenly realizes that she loves him. A crucial
scene is when she stops at a pharmacy to get medicine for her husband. She is
questioned about her prescriptions, and Moore begins to curse the clerk,
shaming him for calling her a lady. It is so effectively unwatchable that it
will make you cringe. Along with "Cookie's Fortune," "The End of the Affair,"
and "An Ideal Husband," 1999 will be remembered as the year of Julianne Moore,
a gifted actress of extraordinary range. </P>
<P>There are many performances worth mentioning but I will at least mention one of
our most unsung actors in America, John C. Reilly (who appeared in P.T.
Anderson's "Boogie Nights" and "Hard Eight"). He plays Officer Jim Kurring, who
prays quite often and is seeking a mate. He finds one in the quiz show host's
daughter (Walters) who plays her stereo far too loud. He is immediately smitten
and asks her out on a date, oblivious to her drug abuse and her high-pitched
personality. She does not realize what a klutz he is since he loses his gun and
nightstick quite often.</P>
<P>"Magnolia" is full of so many great scenes and acute moments of observation
that some of it will remind you of Robert Altman's classic "Short Cuts." The
similarity ends as far as the mosaic of characters (there were far more in
Altman's film) because writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has a musical
structure in mind that is as unusual and breathless as anything I have ever
seen before. Never mind the various songs by Aimee Mann (written specifically
for the film), Mr. Anderson has also mentioned that he based the narrative
structure on the Beatles song, "A Day in the Life." There is even a moment
where each of the characters sings the lyrics to the Aimee Mann song "Wise Up."
"Magnolia" is surely the most musical of all films in a long time. </P>
<P>It would not be fair to reveal more of the surprises in "Magnolia," since one
cannot predict what will happen from one scene to the next. The film builds
with so much power and tension that it leads to a climactic moment that you
will either love or hate (let's say that the "Exodus 8:2" signs are there for a
reason). Some will argue that this film is too strange, bizarre and exaggerated
to understand or comprehend. Those are the naysayers talking who do not wish
for cinema to take such leaps and bounds from the ordinary. "Magnolia" is one
of the most profoundly moving films of the 1990's with an ensemble cast that is
as uniformly brilliant as you can imagine. All great films are tough to forget
- this one will grow on you and get underneath your skin. </P>
