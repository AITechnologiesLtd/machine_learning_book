<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A delightful screwball comedy, making use of sci-fi gimmicks to bolster
its story. The independently wealthy and handsome Peter DeHaven (Jeffrey
Lynn) is getting married tomorrow, but is celebrating tonight with his
friends at his bachelor's party when he gets so drunk that he passes
out. Peter is a practical joker, giving his friends exploding cigars and
shaking hands with them as he gives them electric shocks, so to get even
with him, they take him to the college medical building, where his
friend "Doc" Appleby (Anderson) is a student, and they place him on the
dissecting table to give him a little scare and teach him a lesson. But
problems arise when an eccentric Professor Shotsbury (Edward Everett
Horton), who needs a dead body upon which to test his new life-restoring
serum, arrives with his black servant, Willie (Willie Best), to take the
supposed dead body back to the professor's house to try the experiment
out. Willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that
smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of today's
African-Americans.</P>
<P>When Peter is invisible and the daffy professor can't restore what he
thinks is a dead body, he is upset, but puts himself to work on an
antidote. The professor's very attractive daughter, Lynn Shotesbury
(Jane Wyman-she had recently married fellow actor Ronald Reagan),
notices in the paper that a Peter DeHaven is reported missing and when
she finds out what her father did and talks to the invisible man, she
realizes that this indeed is Peter DeHaven. So they rush him back to his
apartment to get ready for his wedding but he first stops off at his
soon-to-be bride's place, Christine Lunceford (Chapman). She is
disappointed that the wedding had to be called off because of his
disappearance, but before Peter could explain to her what happened, the
one she really loves, who came by the bachelor's party last night to
punch Peter, Robert Struck (Craig Stevens), comes in to kiss her, and
since Peter is invisible and they don't know that he is in the room, she
proceeds to tell Robert how it is very important for her to marry Peter
for financial reasons, even though she doesn't love him. A detective
then comes in to arrest Robert for the disappearance of Peter.</P>
<P>All the comedy comes about because of the invisibilty and mix-ups, and
the zany comic routines between the nutty professor and his
"stereotyped" servant. During the course of the film all of the
following things happen: the professor is brought to a loony bin, a
trial takes place (the film is shown via flashbacks from the trial), and
the ultimate in screwball comedy, a car driving scene with a seemingly
invisible driver being chased by a motorcycle cop occurs.</P>
<P>The funniest one-liners came from Willie: When asked to participate in
the experiment by the professor, who tells him he could be the first
human to be brought back to life by the serum, Willie says- "Why can't I
be the second?" When Willie sees the invisible man, he exclaims, "Well,
cut off my legs and call me shorty."</P>
<P>This 72 minute film is the kind of old-fashioned comedy that can cheer
you up with a few laughs if you are down, or if you are in a silly mood
make you feel even sillier. It's a classic.</P>
