<PRE>FACE/OFF (1997)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
Originally viewed in the spring of 1998</PRE>
<P>After seeing the implausible "Air Force One," I thought to myself - the action
genre is dead and buried. Then comes "Face/Off," which is superior in every way,
despite having an even more ludicrous storyline. </P>
<P>The vibrant John Travolta plays an FBI agent, Sam Archer, whose son was killed
by a colorful, psychopathic terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Sam has
a vendetta and wants to capture Castor. Castor is caught and wounded, and placed
in a coma. Sam has a problem, though: he needs to find a bomb that is planted
somewhere in the vast metropolis of Los Angeles. Despite some objections, Sam
has his face surgically removed and implanted with the comatose Castor's! This
way, Sam can pretend to be Castor making it easier to find where the bomb is
hidden. Problem is the real Castor has awakened from his coma, and has had his
face surgically implanted with Sam's! Farfetched? You bet.   </P>
<P>The difference between "Face/Off" and "Air Force One" is that "Face/Off" is
actually great fun and it's also wickedly entertaining: it takes its inventive
premise and brings it to life with imagination and fire. The tour-de-force is
John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who each cleverly play two roles: Travolta is the
obsessed, quiet, compassionate Sam, and also plays the devious, evil Castor
unbeknownst to Sam's family (they include Joan Allen as Sam's wife, Dominique
Swain as his daughter). There's one priceless moment where Travolta as Castor
gleefully announces, "Things are going to change around here." </P>
<P>Cage naturally plays the grandiose Castor who walks around in red and black
attire complete with two gold-plated guns, and he also convincingly adopts Sam's
placid nature while trying to prove to Castor's foes that he is the brutal
Castor, and simultaneously tries to prove to his wife that he is the real Sam!
Both actors pull this off brilliantly (and they should be nominated for Oscars).
Travolta had the best role (or roles) of his career since "Pulp Fiction," and
Nicolas Cage proves that he hasn't lost his offbeat nature (look at the
hilarious scene where he dons priestly robes and sings "Hallelujah!").    </P>
<P>"Face/Off" is that rarity: a smart, complex, humanistic, fast-moving character
study draped with director John Woo's trademark slo-mo, close-up visuals, and
outrageous, explosive action. It's like watching a live-action comic book. The
film may have too high a body count and seem somewhat relentless, but it's
always top-notch in every other department. "Air Force One" is the mediocre,
senseless, exploitative action picture with little to remind us of the great
Harrison Ford films of the past. "Face/Off" shows that some imagination can
still spill into your local multiplex from an accomplished director. The choice
is ultimately yours. </P>
