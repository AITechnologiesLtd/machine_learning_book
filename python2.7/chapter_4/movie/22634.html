<PRE>                         THE CIDER HOUSE RULES
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Solid, well-told if somewhat
          predictable story of a young man's life in an
          orphanage and his leaving to see a (very small) bit
          of the world.  It is a story that contrasts
          responsibility with freedom and the need for a home
          with the need for a life of ones own.  But
          especially it is a treatise on when it is justified
          to break rules.  Like a lot of films based on John
          Irving novels the feel is less realistic and more
          that of an extended fable.   Rating: 7 (0 to 10),
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Life is bleak at the orphanage at St. Cloud, Maine during the
Depression era.  The weather is cold.  The doctor who autocratically
runs the orphanage, Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), is an ether addict
who performs illegal abortions.  And of course orphans learn about
rejection the youngest of anybody.  This could be the worst of all
possible worlds but for all Larchs shortcomings, his love and
compassion transform the orphanage.</P>
<P>     Into this orphanage is brought Homer Wells (played as an adult by
Tobey Maguire), twice adopted and twice returned.  Homer is raised by
Larch's love and by the love of the staff.  As a teenager Homer is
trained to have a medical knowledge almost rivaling Larch's.  Homer
personally wants nothing to do with abortions, and Larch respects that.
Homer delivers children and can handle a wide range of medical
emergencies like a professional.</P>
<P>     Homer has never been far from St. Cloud, never seen the ocean,
never even seen a lobster.  He longs to see a little of the real world.
When a serviceman brings his girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize
Theron)) for an abortion, Homer befriends the two, and when it comes
time to leave Homer asks to go with them.  Homer has no skills he knows
how to sell and gratefully takes a job as an apple picker.  The team of
farm workers, all black but for Homer, is led by Mr. Rose (Delroy
Lindo).  Homer must try to fit into the team.</P>
<P>     Peppered through the story as a continuing theme are rules and
people who break rules.  Under age boys drive cars and operate as
doctors.  Adult doctors perform abortions.  We also see love against
the rules.  Irving shows us cases where rule-breaking is excusable and
cases where it cannot be forgiven.  The whole story seems to be a
backdrop for examples of when rules should and should not be broken.
It is almost like a school exercise in which one tries to put as many
prepositions in a single sentence as possible, with the actual meaning
of the sentence having only secondary importance.  Irving may be saying
nothing more complex than that rules should be made only with
understanding and caution and should be broken only for unselfish
reasons.  But in giving all the examples John Irving, who wrote the
screenplay based on his own novel, has simplified the story to the
point where it is quite predictable.  We are pretty sure how it is all
going to end, and we know Homer is going to use his medical knowledge
just as surely as we know James Bond will use all of the gizmos he has
been given.</P>
<P>     Lasse Hallstrom, director of MY LIFE AS A DOG, tells stories
slowly and deliberately with a lot of personality texture.  He takes
his time developing his characters.  Toby Maguire's normally pensive
style has been useful in his career.  He seems to specialize in roles
in which he is a little bit of an outsider and has to work out what
things are all about.  In THE ICE STORM he has to navigate the adults'
world of sexual mores.  In PLEASANTVILLE he has to figure his way in
1950s TV-land.  Where another actor might jump into a situation he
thinks about it and intellectualizes it.  Irving and Hallstrom have
given Michael Caine a role different from those he has played in the
past.  That is not easy to do with an actor like Caine, but this is
Caine as we have not seen him before, an odd combination of sleazy and
loving.  Delroy Lindo adds a touch of magnificence and dignity to a
farm worker who is more complex than he at first seems.</P>
<P>     Irving's story is a little simplistic but engaging and the film
captures a sort of nostalgic feel.  I rate THE CIDER HOUSE RULES a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale</P>
