<P>   When a former U.S. Ambassador to Brazil, Charles Burke
Elbrick, states in 1969 that he is opposed to his country's
involvement in Vietnam and that he is essentially against the
the military government in Brazil, we wonder whether he is
telling the truth.  Aren't ambassadors instructed to uphold their
government's positions publicly, whatever their private beliefs? 
Perhaps the reason for his liberalism is the circumstances
under which he expresses himself.  Surrounded by terrorists--
or freedom fighters, depending on your politics--he is
looking down the muzzle of a firearm held on him by some
young people who just plain don't look so dangerous, but he
is convinced that they mean business.  </P>
<P>   "Four Days in September," based on a book written ten
years after the events by Fernando Gaberia called "O que e
isso, companheiro?," is neither documentary nor
Hollywood-style political thriller.  It is, however, an intelligently
fashioned piece of film-making by a director who respects his
audience without capitulating to a talking-heads format which
Americans are familiar with if they watch Sunday morning TV. </P>
<P>   If Bruno Barreto, who has paced his film smartly, wanted to
take sides, he would have made a movie like Costa-Gavras,
firmly on the side of the "freedom fighters" and against the
military junta ruling Brazil.  If he were a Hollywood director
like Mimi Leder ("Peacemakers") he would have made virtual
automatons out of the "terrorists" and evoked big cheers from
the audience when the Americans showed them who's boss. 
Taking a middle ground--an effective step indeed--Barreto
shows all of his characters as real human beings, not good
guys and bad guys, proving that politics involves genuine
complexities, drawing upon many shades of gray.</P>
<P>   "Four Days in September" is a story from the pen of
Fernando Gaberia, a journalist and congressman for the
Green party.  His subject is the amateurish, but in many
ways successful move by a tiny group of moderately
disciplined leftist individuals in Rio to win the release of
political prisoners and at the same time call the attention of
the world to the torture practiced by agents of the military
junta in Brazil.  Their plan is to kidnap the American
Ambassador--who lives in splendor in an estate in Rio--and
force the government to broadcast their demands through the
media while releasing fifteen imprisoned leftists to Mexico. 
They finance their operation by robbing a bank and, using
fake names to frustrate the police should any of their number
get caught and tortured, they take Ambassador Elbrick
hostage at gunpoint while he is riding in his limousine without
security.  </P>
<P>   While the film has its share of action scenes which will
please all but the most thrill-addicted moviegoers, its real
merit comes across inside the safe house in which the crew
are holding their prisoner.  It is there that Barreto highlights
the humanity of all parties, the most ironic touch being the
certainty that Fernando aka Paulo (Pedro Cardoso), who
has gotten to know his captive and to feel compassion for
him, will not hesitate to execute the ambassador precisely at
the appointed hour if the group's demands are not met.  For
his part Elbrick is neither unshaken hero nor bowl of jello as
he counts what could be his final hours on the earth.  He
speaks with genuine respect to his captors and is even
fatherly toward the most beautiful and seductive of them,
Renee (Claudia Abreu), who had used her wiles to gain
information from the ambassador's head of security back at
the mansion.</P>
<P>   These terrorists are nothing like the Gary Oldman character
in "Air Force One," though in a way they are just as fanatical
in their beliefs.  The firebrand, given the revolutionary name
Paulo, is a nerdy-looking guy with thick glasses who, we are
told, has held university students spellbound with his
speeches.  It's difficult to believe that this mild-looking chap
would actually shoot the ambassador in the head, as he is
ordered to do by the leader of the platoon, Jonas (Matheus
Nachtegaele), particularly after escorting the diplomat to the
bathroom during the latter's stroke of incontinence.  The only
thuggish person in the lot appears to be Jonas, who is older
than the all but one of the others in his group, a man who has
stated that he will not extend the deadline one minute and
that he fully intends to carry out his threat to kill the U.S.
representative.</P>
<P>   It's equally difficult to believe that the other side,
represented by a secret service torturer who admits to his
wife and his colleague that he can't sleep nights because of
his pro-government activities, is not made up as well of
genuine human beings who are caught up in having to do
their unpleasant job.  They are not depicted as sadists.</P>
<P>   Barreto has done such a fine job directing Leopold Serran's
adaptation of Fernando Gaberia's book that you come away
quite sympathetic to the young people, who are true believers
appalled by the censorship of their government and by the
campaign of imprisonment and torture of political opponents
of the regime.  Renee is cuddly-sweet, Maria (Fernanda
Torres), who comes on at first as hard-headed, ultimately
sobs that she does not want to die, and the rest of the gang
are just plain so much like polite middle-class lads that the
whole movie challenges our ways of thinking about
revolutionaries.  "Four Days in September" is an exceptional
work in its balance, its believability, its dignity, providing both
insight into a violent practice that has captured headlines for
the past thirty years and a good deal of entertainment for the
audience.  Not Rated.  Running Time: 114 minutes.  (C) 1997
