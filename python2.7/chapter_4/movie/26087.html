SKELETON WOMAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Vivi Letsou's film, SKELETON WOMAN, is like a video that 
you might find in the adult section of a New Age bookstore. It tells an 
unusual story of a mythic "Wild Woman" who comes from the sea and whose 
spirit protects the nearby city. Sometimes a bird or a fish, the being, 
this time, takes the form of a woman, Olya (Daphne Rubin-Vega, WILD 
THINGS), who comes to earth to help three emotionally-lost human beings.</P>
<P>Anna (Serena Scott Thomas, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH) meets and bonds with 
Olya in their breast cancer support group. Anna, who was once a painter, 
hasn't been happy since her husband, Victor (Anthony John Denison), 
talked her into giving it up. He bought her an ad agency with some of 
the money that he made off of his lucrative real estate ventures. Victor 
hasn't been happy either since his failing vision forced him to end his 
career as a pilot. Although Victor and Anna live in a mansion to die 
for, neither one seems the least bit happy.</P>
<P>Olya's lesbian lover, Trisha (Ria Pavia), is having trouble writing her 
big novel. Olya isn't all that happy herself, since she works as an 
exotic dancer at a "glorified psychedelic sex circus," while wanting to 
become a more serious performer. The bizarre nightclub called the 
Euphoria Club includes erotic acts, snakes that slink over the dancer's 
bodies and the guests' martinis, and spiral neon lights on the tables. 
The dancers' revealing costumes look like they were designed by Romanian 
folk dancers. The whole place is so surreal that you wonder what the 
point of it all is.</P>
<P>An eclectic movie, its scenes range from arguments about rising home 
prices in Marin County to a dance number roughly akin to two female mud 
wrestlers without the mud. The movie likes to cut to images of crashing 
waves or of Olya, shown in silhouette, walking on the shore. Frequently 
it stops to tell us tales like the one about the "skeleton woman" whose 
bones have been cast into the sea. The sound of the sea is her mournful 
cry.</P>
<P>The film plays like an abstract poem that has been translated into 
prose. The story drifts back and forth like the ocean waves.</P>
<P>Although it's handsomely shot and well acted, the film is only for those 
who can buy into its fairly tale. To me it smacked too much of New Age 
psychobabble, and I was never drawn into the story. The excessively cute 
FLASHDANCE MEETS NEW AGE SHOWGIRLS exotic dance numbers were enough to 
kill it for me.</P>
<P>SKELETON WOMAN runs 1:20. It is not rated but would be an R for nudity 
and sexual situations. It would be acceptable for high school seniors 
and older.</P>
