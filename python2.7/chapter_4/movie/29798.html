<PRE>MULHOLLAND DRIVE
----------------</PRE>
<P>A dark haired woman (Laura Elena Harring, "Little Nicky") is ordered out of 
a car at gunpoint just before it's hit head on by a bunch of joyriding teens. </P>
<P>Dazed, she climbs from the wreck and makes her way to a Hollywood apartment 
being vacated by an older woman.  </P>
<P>A perky blond (Naomi Watts, "Dangerous Beauty") arrives to stay at her Aunt 
Ruth's vacant place with dreams of movie stardom dancing in her head.  Betty 
finds the dark haired woman in Aunt Ruth's shower, but 'Rita' doesn't remember</P>
<P>who she is or why her purse is stuffed with hundred dollar bills and a blue 
key.  The two set out to discover what led to her accident on "Mulholland 
Drive."</P>
<P>After the linear "The Straight Story," writer/director David Lynch is back
in the weird world of nightmares with this cautionary tale of dashed
dreams and lost love.  Lynch fans should rejoice as "Mulholland Drive" is
his best film since "Blue Velvet."</P>
<P>That film is immediately recalled with the light/dark parallels of Betty
and Rita to Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini's characters.  The twist here
is that we're in 'Betty's' dream, getting events filtered through her own 
idea of her good, talented self.  'I just came from Deep River, Ontario 
and now I'm in this dream place,' Betty chirps at LAX.  The real woman we 
finally meet has a far darker soul, besmirched by her experiences in
tinseltown.</P>
<P>One person having a torturous day in her REM state is Adam (Justin
Theroux, "American Psycho"), a director with a penchant for Fellini-esque 
eyewear.  He's being pressured by the mysterious Castigliane brothers (Dan 
Hedaya and composer Angelo Badalementi) to cast an unknown woman, Camille 
Rhodes, in his movie.  After bashing their limo with a golf club, he heads 
home to discover his wife in bed with the pool man.  He takes residence in a 
fleabag hotel and gets word that his bank has notified the manager that his 
credit's no good.  Then his assistant tells him he's to meet 'The Cowboy' 
later that night.  This Robert-Blake like character's message?  When Camille 
auditions, he's to say 'That's the girl.'</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Betty's audition is so successful a visiting casting agent 
tries to steel her away and steer her towards Adam, but Betty, having promised</P>
<P>to meet Rita, with whom she's fallen in love, nervously flees.  Rita thinks 
she might be Diane Selwyn and the two trace Diane's apartment only to find 
that Rita is not Diane and the dead body inside the apartment very well 
could be.</P>
<P>Trademark Lynch touches abound, from the opening car driving along a median
strip on a dark road and subsequent car accident, to kitschy diners (Winkie's 
here, complete with ghoul in its back alley) and red draped rooms inhabited 
by Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson, "Twin Peaks'" Man From Another Place).  The</P>
<P>Club Silencio, where all is illusion and everything's on tape (shades of "Lost</P>
<P>Highway"), features a singer belting out a Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 
"Crying" acappella.  The industrial soundscapes and Badalementi score provide
the signature Lynch sound while cinematographer Peter Deming's ("Lost Highway)
camera creeps around corners towards sinister doorways and swoops into the
black hole of a blue box.  </P>
<P>Naomi Watts ably plays both the light and dark sides of a woman in love
trying to survive in L.A. (her audition scene's a doozy).
Harring does well playing the sympathetic mystery woman of the dream and
the harder beauty of reality.  Theroux adds sardonic humor.  The legendary
Ann Miller is Coco in both worlds.  Watch for an uncreditted cameo by Lee 
Grant as Lorraine.</P>
<P>In June of 1999, Jack Nicholson was in a car accident with an initially
unidentified 29 year old woman on Mulholland Drive.  She turned out to
be Lara Flynn Boyle, the 'good' friend of "Twin Peaks'" doomed Laura
Palmer.  (Jack also had a road rage incident with a golf club.)  Is this
what David Lynch's dreams are made of?  Whatever the inspiration, 
"Mulholland Drive" is Lynch at the top of his game.</P>
