<PRE>It's A Wonderful Life</PRE>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>It figures that we'd have to go back to the 1946 Best Picture winner in
order to end up with a truly optimistic film. A film in which the characters
are not simply cardboard cutouts and the dialogue isn't used-before cliché.
This isn't the first time I've had this opinion: I think the same thing as a
general rule -- old movies are almost always better than new ones.</P>
<P>I won't bother with the why. The answer lies in the question in the fact
that the normal movie has to ask why it shouldn't use a thing that worked.
They never take risks (studio films, that is. I think an old film and an
independent are on equal footing), they never do anything new, and its all
money, money, money.</P>
<PRE>But money's a very useful thing.</PRE>
<P>Then again, a man who has friends is always rich.</P>
<P>Cliches like that happen to comprise the idea behind on of the least cliché
movies in history, Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", the most famous of
his works and the one that coined the term Capraesque.</P>
<P>It's a Wonderful Life is a story about hope. Hope for life, hope for people,
hope for humankind. It shows us how we affect people in ways we never
imagined, and how we make things better by being in it. It does what an
artist should do, make the mundane important. And in making the mundane
important, in giving the meaningless meaning, it helps us all.
It's a Wonderful Life is one of the top fifty of all time, probably one of
the top ten: a cinema masterpiece with a message.</P>
