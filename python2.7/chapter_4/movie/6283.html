<PRE>                                  SWINGERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     One of the most sincere and earnest looks into single life in the
90's, SWINGERS is nothing but -- in the terms of its resident lounge
lizards -- *money*.</P>
<P>     You've probably seen print ads, movie reviews, and the like,
portraying SWINGERS as a film about a bunch of suave and sexy guys,
making the moves on the pretty babies (aka women) in the nightlife of
La-La land.  The title's double entendre doesn't help matters, either,
so let me set the record straight.</P>
<P>     SWINGERS is about a bunch of guys in L.A., yes, but they aren't
overly suave, with the exception of Trent (the hysterically funny Vince
Vaughn), who lives in an apparent fantasy world of CLOCKWORK ORANGEy
faux-English doublespeak.  His best friend is Mike (Jon Favreau, who
also wrote the script), a down-and-out actor/comedian suffering over the
breakup with his girlfriend of six years.  Rob (Ron Livingston) and Sue
(is in "a boy named Sue," Patrick Van Horn) are both actors/losers also.</P>
<P>     Weaving through Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Trent, Mike, and their
friends turn out to pretty much be high-talkers and low-rollers, about
like everyone else.  We see that these are regular guys, each with his
own demons, each as insecure as you and me.  But they talk a big game.</P>
<P>     Sound familiar?  In the end, SWINGERS perfectly humanizes its
players, makes a touching statement about getting back on your feet
after love knocks you down, and, most importantly, comes off as really,
really, really funny.  Favreau and director Doug Liman are sure to hit
the big time after this, and Vaughn (who's already been picked to star
in JURASSIC PARK 2) ought to get a Best Supporting Actor nomination, at
least.</P>
<P>     SWINGERS is one of those very rare movies where you really come out
a changed, happier person -- at least for awhile.  Hey, maybe I'm money,
and I don't even know it!</P>
<P>     And am I the only one that thinks Favreau looks *exactly* like
George Clooney?  And yes, Doug, that Aaton-III camera is *way* too loud.</P>
