<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>A bored housewife is the focus of this film.  And if that doesn't give
you any indication of the overall boringness of the movie, then read
on.  Diane Lane (Murder at 1600) stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a seemingly
happy wife and mother of two – until the family takes its annual trek
from New York City to Woodbridge for summer vacation.  Here, Pearl
realizes that she missed out on too much of her life by becoming knocked
up at the early age of 17.</P>
<P>So instead of turning to valium like all of the other hausfraus, she
starts screwing the traveling blouse salesman (Viggo Mortensen, A
Perfect Murder) that occasionally pops into the shanty vacation town to
peddle wares to the stranded women.  She doesn't learn his name until
later.  And because the film is set in the summer of 1969, the
filmmakers have Pearl and the Blouse Man make love with the requisite
nostalgic backdrops – Woodstock and the moon landing.</P>
<P>Pearl gives no thought to the fact that her hard-working television
repairman husband (Liev Schreiber, Scream) gave up things in his life,
too.  Or to her kids, Alison and Daniel (Anna Paquin and Bobby
Boriello).  Or to her fortune-telling mother-in-law (Tovah Feldshuh, Law
& Order) who keeps Pearl's affair from her own son.  Or even to the poor
fools that have to watch this film.</P>
<P>The anemic script is blandly directed by Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy in
Ghost) but is more of a showcase for some very fine acting.  The best
parts, however, are actually from an unseen actress – Julie Kavner is
the uncredited voice of the resorts social director that can often be
heard announcing to the yenta vacationers `The knish man is on the
premises.'  (1:45 – R for nudity, sex and adult language)</P>
