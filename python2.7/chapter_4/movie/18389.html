<PRE>ELECTION
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Pitched as a high-school comedy, "Election" is a troubling movie
more suited to an arthouse audience despite its mainstream storyline of a
young and motivated overachiever working the system.  While at times the
film matches the wit and sophistication of Wes Anderson's "Rushmore," a
film which sports similar themes, it doesn't apply as consistent an
approach, and "Election"'s overall mood is too dark and disturbing to shrug
off this weakness.</P>
<P>        The laughs are certainly there, even if empathizing with the film's
characters is difficult.  The actors, however, cannot be accused of turning
in less than accomplished performances.</P>
<P>        Reese Witherspoon, who seems to be fronting just about every other
Hollywood release these days, is bright and confident as Tracy Flick, the
perky go-getter who's running unopposed for Carver High's student
presidency.  That is, until poli-sci teacher Mr. McAllister convinces Paul
Metzler, a big lug of a football hero, into running against her.</P>
<P>        McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick with just the right
amount of murky ambivalence.  McAllister dislikes Tracy Flick, blaming her
for just about everything that has gone wrong in his life.  And he blames
her for destroying the life of one of his colleagues, with whom Tracy had a
brief but devastating affair.  "Some say it was because I never had a
father figure in my life," comments Tracy.  "I just felt so safe and secure
with him."</P>
<P>        It's throwaway lines like that which give "Election" its disturbing
edge.</P>
<P>        Director and co-writer Alexander Payne ("Citizen Ruth") rarely
misses an opportunity to make these subtle jabs.  Of course, once you're
lulled into this predictable pattern, Payne delivers a shocker of a
distinctly unsubtle variety.</P>
<P>        Payne's turbulent styling extends to his main characters.  While
clearly a tragic figure, Tracy is so irritating that she alienates
everyone's sympathies.  McAllister, on the other hand, is painted as a
likable schmuck but is almost repulsive in his hypocrisy and self-delusion.
It's an odd technique by the director, since you wind up not liking anybody
yet feeling sorry for everybody.</P>
<P>        "Election" pushes its satirical way through the seemingly
good-humored election race, pausing from time to time to blindside you with
some jarring realizations about human nature.  By the time the campaign is
in full-swing, Paul's sister Tammy has submitted her candidacy for
president as a knee-jerk reaction to being betrayed by her girlfriend, who
doesn't share Tammy's deeper feelings.  Tammy's Ross Perot-inspired
strategy is one that seems to appeal to the apathetic students of Omaha's
Carver High: vote for me and I'll do nothing!</P>
<P>        What we have here is not just another pubescent comedy because its
moral and ethical observations are shocking and true.  Payne understands
satire and possesses an innate ability to go for the jugular but sometimes
his deft and subcutaneous touch is too uncomfortable.</P>
<PRE>        "Election" is well done; it's just not very pretty.</PRE>
