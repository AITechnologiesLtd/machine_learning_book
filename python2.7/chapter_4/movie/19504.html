Review: "The Matrix" (1999)
A Postview, copyright p-m agapow 1999.</PRE>
<P>Trinity, an outlaw, attempts to evade capture by a group of mysterious
darksuited agents, a chase that involves progressively more implausible
stunts.  Meanwhile Neo, a hacker who is searching the network for an
enigmatic figure called Morpheus, is warned of his impending arrest.
Things get more complicated from this point on ...</P>
<P>"It's like totally virtual reality dude!"</P>
<P>It seems unlikely that an overdue entry to the big idea SF genre would
involve Keanu Reeves, who is still wanted in 20 countries for crimes
committed during "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and the wretched "Johnny
Mnemonic".  But even given the presence of the gnarly one, "The Matrix" has
a promising pedigree, including the Wachowski brothers (former comic book
artists who contributed the deft script to "Assassins" and directed the
excellent film-noir "Bound") and a top notch Hong Kong stunt & action
choreography crew.  It's a winner alright but what sort of one?  As is
always the case with movies that contain twists, this review must talk
around the surprises and be somewhat cryptic and brief.</P>
<P>Many others have sung the praises of "The Matrix" and I am not inclined to
disagree in any major way.  There's some kinetically absurd action that Jet
Li or John Woo would be proud of, some handy plot twists and turns, lovely
SFX, and good acting.  (With the exception of Keanu "cigarstore indian"
Reeves, who at least doesn't hurt the film.  Actually his essential
blandness is strangely appropriate.)  There's a literate substructure, a
nice joke or two, snappy clothes and hardware - there's a lot to love.  And
the film carves its own path in many ways.  Some plot developments are
never explicitly spelt out and the scenario is an uncommonly nihilistic one
for a Hollywood film.  And to partly repeat a previous point, Hong Kong
acrobatics are long overdue in mainstream cinema.  "The Matrix" is _the_
popcorn, brain-filler movie for the season.</P>
<P>Is there anything wrong with "The Matrix"?  Although you wouldn't think it
from general reactions, there is.  It's terrific fun, but falls short of
the film it nearly is.  The intellectual content isn't so much explored as
just dumped in front of you.  It doesn't have the mazelike complexities of
"Bladerunner" or even for that matter "Total Recall".  The implications of
the scenario are never explored, which is possibly just as well, for like
many comic books worlds it doesn't hold up to much examination.  The
inevitable talk of a sequel points how high on detail and low on
implication the world is.</P>
<P>Conversely, one might get the impression from promotional material that
"The Matrix" was a nonstop actionfest.  Actually the first half is packed
to the gunwales with talking heads and exposition.  It's to the credit of
the Wachowski brothers that "The Matrix" survives and thrives on this
schizophrenic nature, managing to be both a dumb action flick and a
thinker.  Again, Keanu is oddly appropriate, having been in both "Speed"
and "Little Buddha".  His character is actually problematic, a saviour who
is never explained, does nothing to earn his superiority, and conveniently
gets his act together just in time to end the film.  In this way, "The
Matrix" echoes "Dark City", a film to which it bears an uncanny
resemblance.</P>
<P>These problems aside, "The Matrix" is terrific and a hopeful sign that some
classic SF may be on the way over the next few years.  It isn't a great
film, it isn't a mindblower, but it is great fun.  Don't miss it.

 scale.</P>
