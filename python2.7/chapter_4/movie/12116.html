<PRE>GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong

<P>We've all heard this story line before: Boy-wonder-genius is discovered and
is put to use by scientists.  Then the government finds out and puts the
boy-wonder to work for the government.  Something outrageous is discovered
by the boy as he works for the government and some bad guys come hunting
for the boy, trying to ax him.  All I have to say is: Thank goodness
writers/actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck took a different approach.</P>
<P>Among its several connotations, the title includes the name of the main
character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon).  Will is a young man who has a
special gift for mathematics and other college level learning.  For him,
comprehending difficult theories is as easy as tying his shoelaces.  He can
read at impressive speeds and retain all of the knowledge after one
reading. By no means is Will like Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man; he is a normal
guy with an abnormal talent. He works as a janitor at MIT, and while
cleaning the floors one night, he solves a difficult proof posted on a
chalkboard and catches the attention of a hardworking professor, Lambeua
(Stellan Skarsgård).  Will is thrown in jail after a scuffle with some
punks and Lambeaua sees this as an opportunity to help Will out.  Lambeaua
agrees to get Will out of jail if he will study math with Lambeaua and get
some therapy.  </P>
<P>After driving away a few therapists with his mind games, Will meets one
that can help him.  Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) is from the same part of
town and is never turned away by Will's horrible behavior. The problem with
Will is that he has a lot of talent but he is squandering it by being a
punk and turning down "real world" ideas.  Both Lambeua and McGuire see
this and both want to help Will out.  </P>
<P>Along the way a relationship starts between Will and Skylar (Minnie
Driver).  Although it has meaning within the movie, it seems somewhat
shallow and I would have liked to see the relationship developed more.  We
also get to meet Will's friends, including his best friend, Chuckie (Ben
Affleck). Like the love relationship, the friendships in the film seem
underdeveloped and shallow.</P>
<P>Those are small complaints, though, because the script works well in
tugging at our emotions. The most important relationship is the one between
Will and Sean, his therapist. And it is in this relationship that we find
out why Will is way that he is. We also see that Sean is being helped by Will.</P>
<P>All performances in Good Will Hunting are top-notch.  Matt Damon is on a
roll, first with his starring role in Francis Ford Coppola's The Rainmaker,
and now with his lead role in Good Will Hunting. I can't wait to see what
he's going to do next.  Robin Williams also gives a wonderful performance.
His Professor McGuire is a man with a hard past and Williams is able to get
that across on screen. (I'm also glad to see Williams in a good movie
instead of movies like Flubber and Father's Day.) </P>
<P>The script by Damon and Affleck milks each and every scene for emotion,
whether a laugh or a tear. In that aspect the script works very well.
Sometimes it feels corny, but it's never bad enough to ruin the film.  Gus
Van Sant Jr., the director, does a wonderful job keeping up the pace.
Worth mentioning is the acoustic and intimate score by Danny Elfman, which
is surprisingly different from his other works. It sounds more like a tame
version of the Midnight Run music than it does his more grand scores, like
Batman.  But, like in all his other films, Elfman never allows the score to
overshadow what is happening on screen.</P>
<P>Good Will Hunting is a great film.  The theme (If you have talent, don't
waste it), comes very close to being inspiring.  The film is definitely a
tear-jerker though.  Don't Miss Good Will Hunting on the big screen.  After
seeing the film, let me know what the title means to you.</P>
