<P>   Your parents take care of you during the first two decades
of your life: it's only natural that you'll want to do the best by
them if they become old and frail.  In some cases,
unfortuantely, a child is made to take on too much
responsibility at too young an age when asked to attend the
needs of her vulnerable folks.  "Beyond Silence" is the story
of a child who is compelled to become the ears of her deaf
father and mother.  This German movie--which features two
people who are hearing impaired in real life--deals with
several popular themes: the special world of the handicapped;
the effect a person's impediment has on those who surround
him; the need of the young to free themselves from their
homes and take responsibility for their own happiness; the
subtle ways in which do-gooders actually exploit the souls of
the people they are nurturing.  But few recent films have
treated these themes with the intelligence, the shucking off of
sticky sentimentality, the maturity of this one.  "Beyond
Silence" is a joy from beginning to end, a movie which has no
real villain but whose characters sometimes make you want to
jump through the screen and spend a moment or two
wringing their necks.</P>
<P>   The picture opens on a German winter as eight-year-old
Lara (Tatjana Trieb) watches her attractive and liberated aunt
Clarissa (Sibylle Canonica) skate gracefully on a deserted, icy
pond.  Clarissa and Lara are a mutual admiration society with
symbiotic needs: the older woman is childless and treats the
child as a substitute daughter; the little girl wants ever so
much to be like her beloved aunt.  But the poor Lara must
tend to the needs of her deaf parents Martin (Howie Seago)
and Kai (Emmanuelle Laborit), who depend on her to mediate
in sign language with the outside world--to arrange such
mundane matters as bank loans and interpreting a teacher's
comments on open school night.  A turning point comes in
Lara's life when she receives a clarinet from her musically
gifted aunt.  While Lara is eventually to seek admission to a
prestigious conservatory, her father resents bitterly resents
her attention to the music he cannot hear.  Discreet
flashbacks take us to Martin's youth as he is forced to attend
a concert given by her sister Clarissa, the hearing child who is
obviously favored by their parents.</P>
<P>   Wonderfully acted by the adorable Tatjana Trieb as the
eight-year-old Lara and as the expressive young woman at
the age of eighteen by Sylvie Testud, "Beyond Silence" takes
us through the usual rites of passage as Lara latches on to
the empathetic young Tom (Hansa Czypionka), who teaches
at a school for the deaf and who understands that while Lara
enjoys the time they are spending together, she is deeply sad
inside.  In fact, as Lara later explains her fondness for
klezmer music, "Inside it is joyful and wild, but at the same
time it's not really free."</P>
<P>   Caroline Link's direction gives the movie the woman's
touch, particularly when Ms. Link explores the surprising
conflict which emerges between Clarissa and Lara and
considers the melancholy Clarissa feels despite her outwardly
high-spirited show.  You leave the theater with an insight into
the closed-off world of the deaf, get photographer Gernot
Roll's sparkling shots of Berlin and of the pretty German
countryside, and best of all savor that all-too-rare "German-
light" experience of a movie that seems utterly truthful and yet
consistently entertaining.</P>
