<P>Bruce Willis' career as an actor, now in its eighteenth year, commands a
list of nearly forty titles. Add to that almost ten more titles which he
served on as a producer or a writer or various other crew roles, and
there is no denying the statement that Willis is very accomplished in
the motion picture industry. It's somewhat surprising to consider, then,
that the majority of his achievements have not moved beyond the limited
confines of action or thriller movies. While some have been benchmark
entertainment, like DIE HARD, PULP FICTION, and 12 MONKEYS, Willis'
flashes of brilliance do not counterbalance the many senseless movies
he's made. His newest star vehicle, MERCURY RISING, isn't as bland as
other work he's done, but it is a thriller doesn't achieve what genre
fans expect. </P>
<P>Although primarily a thriller, MERCURY RISING has scenes where it wants
to be and fades into simple, guns-blazing action (scenes of Willis
running through a hospital come to mind). These tentative, cross-genre
steps cause the thriller component to lose value, because the intent of
a thriller is to build tension slowly but steadily. When a gunfight
errupts, its as though all of the tension built to that point has been
thrown onto the screen, and the movie has to start over. Genre fans, who
expect an edge-of-their-seats ride, or at the very least, constant
excitement, will be disappointed by the lulls as MERCURY RISING goes
through the cumbersome rebuilding process. Harold Becker, who last
directed the mediocre political thriller CITY HALL, gets the pacing down
by the end of the movie, although the his finale is somewhat
anticlimactic. </P>
<P>As the principal, Bruce Willis is unconvincingly bland, although his
character is easy to stomach. He plays Art Jefferies, a special agent
with the FBI who, after striking a superior officer following a botched
hostage situation, is relegated to a missing-child case. Arriving at the
boy's house, he finds both parents shot dead and the child hiding away
in a closet. He attempts to get to know the kid, named Simon (Miko
Hughes), but this proves difficult as Simon is autistic. Unaware of the
world as most people see it, Simon's autism enables him to read and
decipher complex encryptions developed by the nation's most secretive
agencies. When he interprets the National Security Agency's newest
communications code, nicknamed Mercury, he encurs the wrath of the
division head, Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin). Only Art (of course) goes
with his gut feeling and helps the kid out. </P>
<P>Both Willis and Baldwin turn in fairly credible performances, and while
this was one of Willis' more likeable roles over his past efforts (THE
JACKAL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT), Baldwin lacks the sinister sliminess that
has pervaded his other antagonistic roles. His gravelly voice makes up
for some of it, but his lack of screen time means he can't lend the
gravity that he did in THE EDGE or THE JUROR. Miko Hughes is the most
outstanding actor here, with a stunning portrayal of an autistic boy
that lends realism to Willis' character. The acting overall is bearable,
but it's present in a genre that doesn't demand it. The movie doesn't
deal with its genre well enough to receive full credit, though, and
MERCURY RISING is watchable by anyone who doesn't demand perfection. </P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "MERCURY RISING": 2.5 stars - an enjoyable movie.</P>
