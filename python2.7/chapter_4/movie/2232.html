<PRE>                                MY LIFE
                       A film review by Jon Ridge
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Ridge</PRE>
<PRE>CAST:  Michael Keaton, Nicole Kidman, Haing S. Ngor
SCREENPLAY:  Bruce Joel Rubin
DIRECTOR:  Bruce Joel Rubin
SCORE:  John Barry
RUNNING TIME:  1:52
RELEASE:  November 12, 1993</PRE>
<P>     It was, I believe, just around three years ago that a certain
screenwriter by the name of Bruce Joel Rubin produced what ultimately
became one of the most popular films of the year.  You know the movie.
Add to that one of the most talked about movies of its year, JACOB'S
LADDER, and what you've got is a very talented individual.  Now, in
1993, Rubin has created yet another heart-wrenching and emotionally
stimulating script by the name of MY LIFE.  The difference this time
round is that in addition to writing the film, Rubin is credited with
directorial status in order to give his film the touch of magic it
needs.</P>
<P>     The story surrounds an advertising executive named Bob Jones.  As
the film opens, right from the get-go, Jones has been diagnosed with
cancer in his lungs.  To complicate matters in his life even more, his
wife, Gail (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman), is pregnant with
their first child.  And knowing that he may not be around long enough
to see his baby's birth, Jones decides to video the part of his life he
is currently living so that his child will have something by which to
know him.  A sweet notion.</P>
<P>     However, Bob isn't willing to simply rest on his laurels.  No, he
goes through the full gamut of emotions from denial to confusion to
final acceptance.  This is a wonderful Michael Keaton performance,
totally unlike anything he has shown audiences as of yet.  And not only
does he he bring poignancy to his dying-man role, he brings forth humor
as well, so even the most cynical of cynics can appreciate something
about his performance.  Beside him all the way is Nicole Kidman.
Kidman is a gorgeous actress, always it seems.  And she has never been
prettier than she is in MY LIFE.  Of course, she can also act, and that
gives her role of the wife a touching bit of emotion in itself.  Gail
stands by her husband through the roughest of times, with ample
opportunity to leave at any time if so desired.  But that isn't what
she wants, and Kidman is the right actress to play the part of loving
wife.  When she tells Keaton, "You're the love of my life," we have no
choice but to believe her.</P>
<P>     In a way, MY LIFE is a bit of a let-down.  I kept wanting a little
grit along with all the poignancy, and the bit involving Keaton's toy
shopping spree and rollercoaster ride at a park really have no place in
such an otherwise heart-tugging movie.  But I can't complain; for
everything this film lacks it also has a lot to appreciate and an
awful lot to like.  Just try and keep from smiling when Keaton and
Kidman try hard to get their newborn to sit upright without falling
over.  Just try to keep from crying your eyes out when Keaton finally
tells his father that he loves him.  Just try and not walk away from
this film with an affirmation of life.</P>
<PRE>          MY LIFE is a winner.</PRE>
