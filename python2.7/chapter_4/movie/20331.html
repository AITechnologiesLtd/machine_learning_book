<PRE>REVIEW: The Blair Witch Project (1999)
Reviewed by Matt Pusateri</PRE>
<P>When I was eight, my brother, a friend and I decided to camp out in our
backyard on a summer night.  We pitched a tent and rolled out sleeping bags.
For us, this was almost "roughing it."  We ate junk food, watched the skies
for UFO's, and told ghost stories until the middle of the night.  Sometime
around 3 a.m., just as we were drifting off to sleep, we heard someone
scream in the distance, about a block away. It was a loud, shrill scream.
I've almost never been so frightened in my life.   In a blind panic, we all
rushed to the front of the tent, fumbled with the zipper, and trampled over
each other get out of the tent and rushed inside the house, where lights,
carpeting, and TV would seemingly protect us from whatever was lurking
outside.  Looking back, our terror seems silly and absurd, since we were in
a fenced backyard of a suburban Los Angeles home, yards away from my
parents' bedroom window. I'm not even sure today that what we heard was a
woman screaming, not a cat.  But on that night, it was what we couldn't see
and didn't know that was so terrifying.</P>
<P>What triggered my memory of that incident was The Blair Witch Project.  This
$35,000 independent film has stunned the entertainment industry by
out-grossing many major studio releases this summer.  The film deserves both
the hype and ticket sales it has generated.  It is a fresh, engaging, and
flat-out scary film. Unlike the countless Scream clones and sci-fi monster
movies, Blair is scary without relying on special effects, haunting
soundtracks, or a teams of high-paid make-up artists.  It draws on the
primal fears all of us share, and have experienced at one time -- the  fear
of the unknown and the fear of being vulnerable and exposed.</P>
<P>Presented as the recovered footage of three documentary filmmakers who
vanished in the woods of Maryland while making a film about a legendary
local witch, the movie depicts three college students as they go into the
woods to explore the spooky local legend.  You know it's not going to have a
happy ending, but don't know what the characters are going to face.  You're
along for the ride, trying to figure out what's going on and what's out
there, in the dark, just out of sight, before it reaches out and gets them.</P>
<P>The film starts with the project's leader, Heather (Heather Donahue), who
compulsively (and conveniently) tapes everything the group does, as she
prepares for the trip.  The documentary is supposed to examine the local
legend of the "Blair Witch," who has supposedly been responsible for several
unsettling and mysterious deaths in Burkittsville, Maryland, since she was
banished from the town in 1786.  Heather is joined by fellow students Mike
(Michael Williams) and Josh (Joshua Leonard), and the trio head to
Burkittsville, where they interview people on the street about the legend.
Some townspeople have never heard of the Blair Witch legend, while others
seemingly know a lot about it. A few suggest to the filmmakers that they
think she's still out there somewhere. In an eerie scene, a local  woman
explains on camera what she knows about the story of the witch, while the
baby girl she is carrying keeps putting her hand over her mother's mouth, as
if to keep the words from coming out.</P>
<P>The next day, the three students strap on backpacks and head into the woods
in search of some famous landmarks related to the history of the Blair
Witch.  They find a spot known as "coffin rock," where five men's bodies
were found ritualistically dismembered and inscribed with strange symbols in
1886.  After that, the students set off to find an infamous graveyard deep
in the woods.  When they camp at night, odd things start happening, and they
begin to hear noises nearby and sometimes right outside their tent. As they
plod on, tensions rise along with fatigue and fear.  Soon, they are lost and
struggle to find their way out of the woods.  Disturbing late-night
visitations continue to plague them, and they begin to fear that their
harassers may be worse than curious wildlife or mischievous rednecks.
Heather, from the outset, is the in-control type -- always in charge of the
map, always making decisions -- but as they become increasingly lost and
fearful, you can see her sense the control over the situation slipping away,
which perhaps scares her the most. Their cycle of hope, fatigue, and fear
continue for days, leading up to some creepy developments, surprising final
twists, and an absolutely chilling finale.</P>
<P>The film's creators, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, didn't so much
direct the film as manipulate it.  They gave the three actors the basic
backstory of the film, then sent them off on their own to film the scenes in
the woods without any script.  They would get daily messages to the actors
about general plot developments and things to do, but otherwise, the actors
improvised scenes and filmed them.  In turn, the Myrick and Sanchez would
review the tapes after each day and make suggestions for the next day.  To
keep the developments spontaneous, they kept the actors in the dark about
what else would happen (except that they would not be hurt), so the late
night disturbances faced by the actors were genuinely surprising, and no
doubt, frightening to them.  When the characters look tired, it's because
the actors were tired.  If they sound testy, they probably were. Reportedly,
the directors warned the actors before taking the job that "your safety is
our concern, your conform it not."  (In fact, the actors, while alone in the
woods, unlike the characters in the film, did have a GPS locator device in
their gear to prevent them from genuinely becoming "missing," like their
fictional counterparts.)</P>
<P>Part of what makes Blair effective is that it looks and feels genuine.  The
shaky camcorder effect isn't contrived as in some ads or in NYPD Blue, it's
a camcorder being held by someone on the move or whose arm is actually
shaking.  The early part of the film looks like anyone's goofy camcorder
tape -- people clowning off in front of the camera, playing with the zoom
control, and hamming it up.  By the time things start getting strange, the
viewer has been sucked into the illusion that he or she is watching a real
videotape of real people making a documentary.  The film wouldn't work if
you were constantly aware that these were three actors in the woods, dirty
and tired, but perfectly safe.  The improvisational acting in the film,
mixed with genuine reactions of surprise, frustration, and fear, make the
performances by the three actors convincing and compelling.  Two of the
actors have noted that people have recognized them since the film's release
on the street and stopped them to express how relieved they are to see that
they are safe after all.  In the course of the 90-minute film, you see and
feel the toll the experience takes on the characters, as they descend from
frivolity, to frustration, to anger, to desperation, and finally, to sheer
terror.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest movies in recent years: a
film that follows you around for a while after you leave the theater. Some
friends who have seen the movie have told me that it disturbed them more a
week after they saw the film than right after seeing it.  It does a much
better job at getting at the things that truly scare all of us than most
contemporary horror films.  The smartest move by its creators was to let the
audience imagine the scariest parts of the film themselves.  Many of the
scariest elements of the film are just out of camera range, hard to hear
clearly, too blurry to see, or just far enough away in the darkness that you
can't see.  That's what scares us in real life, what scared me years ago in
my backyard, and what continues to frighten millions of audience members.
When you leave the theater, you're not exactly sure what you saw, what you
heard, or even what ultimately happened to the characters.  And that, quite
possibly, is the scariest part of the experience.</P>
