<PRE>DARK CITY</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>"Dark City" gave me a splitting headache, but one day later the movie
makes less sense to me than it did when I watched it.</P>
<P>Director Alex Proyas' followup to the underrated "The Crow," is a
loud, bulky, visual-effects laden mess of a movie. It's a cross
between Stephen Soderbergh's "Kafka" and "Hellraiser: Bloodline" by
legendary B-movie director Alan Smithee. At least, I think it
was. "Dark City" made as much sense as "Spawn," and how could I ever
forget the worst movie of 1997 since it is five months, 20 days and 14
hours since I've seen it?</P>
<P>Proyas should have brought Smithee in to finish "Dark City," but it
appears he had too much invested in the convoluted story since it was
his idea to begin with. He also co-wrote the screenplay and
co-produced the movie.</P>
<P>How do I tell you about a movie that I didn't understand? It's films
like "Dark City" that give science fiction movies a bad name. A
mult-million dollar budget spent on a 10-cent script. "Dark City" is
set in an unknown world, on an unknown planet in an unknown part of
the galaxy.  The city looks as dreary as Metropolis, or even
futuristic L.A. from "Blade Runner," but there are no spaceships
here. Only 1940s era Studebakers and elevated trains.</P>
<P>Even more is unknown about its citizens. How did they get there? Who
are they? There is never any daylight and no one is quite sure of what
the world is like outside the city. The script gives few details about
any backstory, and that is Proyas' main downfall. Go ahead and spend
tons of dough on George Liddle's production designs, but send this
story back to re-write.</P>
<P>The film begins with an opening pan of the city stolen from the
aforementioned "Metropolis."</P>
<P>Rufus Sewell ("Dangerous Beauty") stars, in his second film to open on
the same day, as amnesia victim John Murdoch, who awakens from his
bathtub to discover a dead woman in his hotel room. Murdoch becomes a
suspect in a series of killings involving hookers. With a memory lapse
lasting three weeks, Murdoch searches for his lounge singing wife,
Emma (Jennifer Connelly). He also has a strange mind power borrowed
from "Dune," but that's never explained as well. Sewell's performance
is clearly mailed-in as he seems to sleepwalk through much of the
movie.</P>
<P>>From there, you're on your own as to understanding the rest of the
plot. Check your brain at the door. "Dark City" joins a long list of
films that make absolutely no sense, beginning with such recent
story-impaired movies like "Mission:Impossible," "The Jackal," "Johnny
Mnemonic" or "Destiny Turns on the Radio."</P>
<P>In "Dark City," the Strangers, a group of Pinhead wannabes, control
the city from their underground lair. Each day (each half day?) they
make time stop at the stroke of 12 so that they could change the
buildings around in the city while everyone else is temporarily
asleep. Ahem.  Fine British actor Ian Richardson plays the boss, but
he's not so fine here, barely recognizable in his Cenobite look-alike
garb. His right-hand man, Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien), is one of the
ghouls that chases after Murdoch for no apparent reason.</P>
<P>The disfigured Dr. Daniel Schreber (Keifer Sutherland) acts as an
agent between the city dwellers and the underground dwellers.</P>
<P>Oscar winner William Hurt, who disappeared from major studio films
through much of the 90s, begins the year with the first of four
movies. He starts off as the meaningless Inspector Bumstead. Bumstead
is brought in to take over the serial hooker killings case, but that
subplot is completely forgotten by the end. I don't get it. Hurt is
trying to mount a comeback starting with "Dark City" and "Lost in
Space?"</P>
<PRE>I just don't get it.</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: One star</PRE>
