<PRE>                                 AS GOOD AS IT GETS
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Meet Melvin Udall, a misanthropic, racist, homophobic bigot with an intense
dislike of dogs.</P>
<P>Well, one dog in particular, perhaps--Verdell, a button-cute Brussels
Griffon from across the hall.  Melvin's had about all he's gonna take from
this pint-sized urinating machine and, in a scene we've all seen in the
three month's worth of previews, shoves him down the trash chute.  Given
that old stalwart "no animals were mistreated during the making of this
motion picture," Verdell shows up again a little rumpled--doggie dignity
included--but none the worse for wear.</P>
<P>This initial man vs. beast confrontation in "As Good As It Gets" does
little to endear Melvin to us.  After disposing of the furry little critter
this reclusive writer of romance novels holes himself up in his Manhattan
apartment (turning the lock five times very deliberately) and proceeds to
wash his hands in scalding water, wasting two entire bars of Neutrogena in
the process.</P>
<P>Melvin, you see, suffers from a chronic obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
it's not long before we witness further outrageous behaviors on his part:
Melvin insulting Jews, blacks, and Panamanians alike with vicious,
political incorrectness; Melvin twisting himself pretzel-like along a busy
street in order to avoid stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk.  And so on.</P>
<P>Later still we realize that Melvin isn't someone to be hated, however.
Misanthropy isn't a choice for him; it's a disease.</P>
<P>When Verdell's owner Simon is badly beaten during a robbery, Melvin is
"entrusted" with caring for the cow-eyed canine.  (Simon, a neighboring,
almost-successful artist is affectionately played by Greg Kinnear.)  During
Simon's convalescence, Verdell has an extraordinarily humanizing effect on
the antisocial author.</P>
<P>It's hard to imagine anyone but Jack Nicholson playing Melvin.  He's
terrific, in that Jack Nicholson kind of way, and is likely to garner an
Oscar nomination for his ebullient, eyebrow-centric performance.  Helen
Hunt plays Carol, a struggling single mother with an asthmatic son at home.
She's the only waitress in the coffee shop that Melvin frequents who can
stand him for more than a few minutes.  Hunt's puffy-cheeked nervous
fidgeting isn't much of an extension of her Jamie Buchman character on TV's
"Mad About You."</P>
<P>Things clunk, rather than click, between the two of them.</P>
<P>James L. Brooks, the successful producer of both big and small screen
projects--last year's "Jerry Maguire" and TV's "The Tracey Ullman Show" and
"The Simpsons" to name a few--has only a small list of directing credits.
Clearly he chooses his directing assignments carefully and clearly he likes
to employ Nicholson, who won an Academy Award for his supporting work in
"Terms of Endearment," and provided "Broadcast News" with a wonderful,
uncredited cameo.</P>
<P>As is typical with any Brooks production, the writing in "As Good As It
Gets" (by the director and Mark Andrus) has a depth that's rare by
Hollywood standards but, at 138 minutes, the film stumbles along and at
times seems contrived.  That Carol should settle for someone as
beyond-her-years as Melvin seems more a product of casting than it does
story construct.</P>
<P>That said, "As Good As It Gets" is decent, if not vintage, James L. Brooks,
made all the more palatable by that man Jack Nicholson.</P>
