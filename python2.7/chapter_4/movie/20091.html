<P>THE MATRIX is possibly one of the most imaginative Hollywood film of this
decade. This kung-fu laced sci-fi fantasy has the enough action to drive any
action fan crazy (even put to shame many kung-fu based movies from Hong
Kong) and one of the most imaginative yet surprisingly believable plot ever
conceived for commercial film. This review contain spoilers that may ruin
your enjoyment of the film by knowing too much but this is one film which is
so hard to review without giving away too much. Do discontinue your reading
now and watch the film immediately! I guess by now, word-of-mouth would
generated on this movie would have seep through the crevices of every
movie-goer in this world. So does it matter really? Oh well.</P>
<P>The story brings us the revelations concerning `The One' Thomas Anderson
(Reeves), a computer-geek who when not working in his white-collar computing
job in a big firm, he will be spending time at home, in front of his
computer, grabbing `contraband' information from the net for sale. Call it a
bit of `side-income' but Thomas is indeed onto something when he is
mysteriously led to the man he has been seeking for so long; the elusive yet
almost godly Morpheus. Thomas's obsession is fueled by his curiosity on THE
MATRIX and it this inner obsession that inadvertently led him, almost by
fate to Morpheus, the guru on the subject.</P>
