<P>    Those of us who think that there's something sinister,
something wrong about the political correctness movement
might have a change of mind after seeing "The Life and
Times of Hank Greenberg."  This documentary about one of
the greatest Jewish ballplayers of the century illustrates the
hatred allowed to come out of the mouths of some
degenerate Americans, Americans who somehow thought
that if a person is not a white Christian, he has no business
playing in a game that was "meant for them."  Happily the PC
movement may not have changed everyone's mind about
racial and religious minorities, but at least unhealthy slurs are
not in fashion, at least in public, as they seem to have been
during the era that saw Greenberg challenge Babe Ruth's
record of homers.  Greenberg was a player for the Detroit
Tigers from 1933-1946 before he was traded by them to the
Pirates for whom he played an additional season.  Aviva
Kempner's congenial and often rousing and humorous
documentary gives us access to some archival footage of
Greenberg both at bat and on first base and in left field.  But
her focus is foremost on the fact that Hank Greenberg was
the first Jewish baseball player who, though completely
secular, never hid his religion despite its unpopularity with the
bigots of this country.  (He was not the first Jewish ballplayer
in the Majors: a few, not named here, preceded him, but they
had apparently changed their names to pass for Christian.)</P>
<P>   Punctuating the documentary with Henry Sapoznik's
Klezmer-infused score, director Kempner--whose previous
work was as co-scripter and producer of "Partisans of Vilna"
(about Jewish resistance against the Nazis)--succeeds in this
12-year-long labor of love to give us a grand look at the
handsome but gawky, 6'4" athlete who served as an icon for
Jews throughout the country.  Setting her footage of pennant-
winning and series-winning baseball games against interviews
with forty-odd fans, family and celebrities, she gives us a
rounded picture of the largely anti-Semitic spirit of the times,
a spirit which led to Greenberg's being greeted by hate-filled
catcalls from the stands and in one instance even from the
bench of an opposing team.  Young people today would be
aghast to see samples of help-wanted pages from the thirties
advertising for "Christians Only" and "Must be of Anglo-Saxon
descent--as such proclamations are not only illegal today but
would be laughable outside circles like KKK, the American
Nazi party and so-called white citizens' councils.  Yet during
the 1930s a figure as illustrious as Henry Ford would publish
a book called "The International Jew" (how those of the
Jewish persuasion were corrupting capitalism and furthering
communism).  </P>
<P>   Documentaries are not very popular in America, the
principal reason being perhaps the fear that they are little
more than opportunities for talking heads.  Talking heads do
indeed populate the film, but those captured by Thomas
Kaufman's camera are an amusing lot, including Walter
Matthau and Alan Dershowitz.  Though not alluded to in the
film, Dershowitz, one of the country's foremost attorneys, had
written a book called "Chutzpah," in which he challenges
Jews to be proud of their heritage and do nothing to hide
their ethnic identity.  In the interview, he explains that during
the thirties and forties, Jews were supposed to be quiet, or as
they say in Yiddish "shta, shtill." Jews were damned if they
failed and damned if they succeeded, so the common wisdom
was "Don't make waves."  Greenberg becomes, therefore,
one of Dershowitz's heroes, particularly when in deference to
his heritage and out of respect for his parents, he refused to
play ball on Yom Kippur despite turning in an impressive
performance on the preceding Rosh Hashanah.  (In the
movie's most engaging note, we learn that Greenberg's rabbi,
citing the Talmud, allowed Greenberg to ply his trade on the
Jewish New Year because "children in ancient times played
sporting games in the streets of Jerusalem."  What the rabbi
deliberately hid from the ball player's ears was that those
were Roman kids, not Jewish youngsters).</P>
<P>   Detractors of Hank Greenberg include a cop, photographed
when giving the player a ticket for going through an amber
light and saying "Who in hell ever heard of a Greenberg
being a ball player?"  Yet another was his drill sergeant--
Greenberg took up arms in World War 2--who announced to
his men, "I don't want any Cohens or Goldbergs on my
team."  The athlete raised his hand and said, "My name is
Greenberg."  Looking at the muscular, 6'4" hero, the drill
sergeant mumbled, "I didn't say anything about Greenbergs."</P>
<P>   For lack of funding, Kempner persisted for 12 years to get
this film out to the public, making her, like Greenberg, a hero. 
Framed by Mandy Patinkin's singing "Take Me Out to the Ball
Game" in Yiddish against a backdrop of Bronx kids during the
Depression throwing the horsehide around the local streets,
"The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg" is well deserving of
the Audience Award it garnered from those attending its
screening at a Hamptons Film Festival.</P>
