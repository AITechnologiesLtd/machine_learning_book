<P>        Air traffic controllers have one of the most demanding jobs on the
planet, by most accounts. With nothing more than strips of paper and small
radar scopes, they are responsible for thousands of lives daily. The
profession "boasts" high rates of alcoholism, depression, burnout, and
suicide.</P>
<P>Talking like auctioneers on meth, controllers have to keep track
of dozens of airplanes, getting everyone where they need to go, on time,
without killing anyone. The airspace around New York City has three major
airports within twenty miles of each other, and the small facility
responsible for controlling that area is the unlikely setting for "Pushing
Tin." (The title, by the way, is controller lingo for maximizing use of
airspace to keep planes on schedule.)</P>
<P>Nick "The Zone" Falzone (John Cusack) is the best controller in
New York. Unlike most of his co-workers, his life outside the workplace
isn't quite as intense as his job - for the most part, he's content to go
home to his wife Connie (Cate Blanchett), his only outward concession to
his six-figure salary a nice sportscar.</P>
<P>Enter Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), another legend in the
field, the one man better at his job than "The Zone." His Zen-like
approach to the job and quiet demeanor shadow a wild nature - he rides a
mean motorcycle and has a wife half his age (Angelina Jolie). He is very
nearly the definition of "intensity," standing under landing 747s to get
caught up in the backwash. And it pushes all of Falzone's alpha-male
buttons.</P>
<P>"Pushing Tin" could have used a controller, as it seems to have
trouble picking a theme. At times, Nick and Russell are engaged in a war
of machismo, as they constantly try to outdo each other in everything from
shooting free throws to bedding each other's wives (and, of course,
landing planes). The mutual antagonism (and, very occasionally, mutual
respect) would have made for a great movie on its own.</P>
<P>But at times it flies into comedic territory as well, though the
jokes are generally subtle. Dry, intellectual humor can be difficult to
pull off, but when they're given the chance, the cast does a fair job of
it. The laughs are sparse enough that "Pushing Tin" can't really be billed
as a comedy, though.</P>
<P>The last thirty minutes touch on the romance that the movie is
billed for, and even elements of the classic male-bonding buddy movie. Any
of these aspects could have been drawn out to make a movie with a
consistent theme, that wouldn't feel quite as disjoint as "Pushing Tin."</P>
<P>Perhaps because they can't latch onto any given kind of story in
which to act, the cast turns in mediocre performances at best. Thornton
has already done his controller schtick (in "Armageddon"), and Cusack's
character just doesn't have anything distinctinve about it. Blanchett and
Jolie, both award-winning actresses, are underutilized to the point of
merely being attractive set dressing.</P>
<P>With a top-notch cast and intriguing setting, I wanted to like
"Pushing Tin." But the script tries to push more tin than it can handle,
leaving this movie hanging in midair and eventually crashing in the video
store.</P>
