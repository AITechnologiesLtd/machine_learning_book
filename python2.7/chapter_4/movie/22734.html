<P>Play It to the Bone (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Woody
Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Lisa Liu. Written and
directed by Ron Shelton.</P>
<P> On the boxing food chain Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson) and Cesar
Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) are closer to the bottom than the top.</P>
<P> Neither is what you would call a contender. They're merely card fillers
- bodies to fill out a program, to whet the mob's appetite before the
main bout.</P>
<P> Vince and Cesar also happen to be best friends. So when providence
strikes, it smites them both in the solar plexus.</P>
<P> A series of accidents has opened a spot on a championship bout card.
The only hitch, Vince and Cesar have to fight each other.</P>
<P> Thus is the premise of director-writer Ron Shelton's "Play It to the
Bone."</P>
<P> And  I wish I could report that Shelton's movie delivers a knock-out
punch. </P>
<P> Unfortunately, it lands a few solid blows and several jabs, but never
can connect that emotional wallop needed to carry off the decision.</P>
<P> Shelton has created some likable characters, yet it seems he had
trouble deciding what he wants to do with them.</P>
<P> "Play It to the Bone" almost plays like two films: the first, a road
movie as Vince, Cesar and their girlfriend, Grace Pasic (Lolita
Davidovich) drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for the bout.</P>
<P> The second, and much better half of the movie, is the battle in the
ring between Vince and Cesar.</P>
<P> "Play It to the Bone" is gritty, hard-punching fun. But Shelton takes
too long setting things up for the big fight. He spends too much time on
the road. His idea, of course, was to allow us time to get to know these
characters.</P>
<P> But Vince and Cesar start to wear out their welcome as their
alternately bond, bicker and recall past days of near-glory.</P>
<P> The fight sequences are superb. And Shelton's dialogue is crisp and
clever.</P>
<P> Harrelson and Banderas gives solid performances. They have the walk and
talk down pat and have that down-and-out, almost-made-it-to-the-top
look.</P>
<P> Davidovich is sexy and charming as the woman who can't decide between
the two loves of her life, while Lucy Liu (best known as one of the
lawyers on TV's "Ally McBeal") is sharp is a small, supporting role as a
gold-digging hanger-on.</P>
<P> Ultimately, though, something is missing. An ingredient is lacking that
would raise "Play It to the Bone" to level of Shelton's "Bull Durham,"
for example.</P>
<P> It's that little spark that separates a champion from an also-ran.
"Play It to the Bone" had championship potential, but it just could not
climb to that next level.</P>
