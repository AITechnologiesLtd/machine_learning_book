<PRE>                                    SPEED
                       A film review by Phineas Narco
                        Copyright 1994 Phineas Narco</PRE>
<P>     I can just imagine the pitch for the new movie SPEED at some
Hollywood power lunch at Spago's: "Okay, picture IN THE LINE OF FIRE
meets DIE HARD.  A psycho bomber rigs a bus full of people so that if
it falls below 50 MPH it explodes.  We get Christian Slater or Keanu
Reaves for the lead, you know, someone young and virile, he has to keep
the bus running while trying to disarm the bomb."  SPEED is pure junk
food entertainment ... like a Snickers bar it's delicious and cloying
when you're eating it, yet virtually devoid of substance, nutrition and
credibility.  After you've come down from the initial sugar rush you
feel kind of empty and cheated, but only if you were expecting anything
more from it.</P>
<P>     That Spago power lunch HAD to have taken place at some point.  DIE
HARD meets IN THE LINE OF FIRE.  Keanu's hair (which keeps getting
shorter and shorter with each movie he makes--is he bald in LITTLE
BUDDHA?) is close-cropped like Bruce Willis' in DIE HARD.  Like IN THE
LINE OF FIRE there's a lot of verbal sparring over the phone with the
psycho and talk about "the game" and Keanu's partner (like Eastwood's
partner) gets ... well, you know ...  Unlike IN THE LINE OF FIRE, SPEED
doesn't spend much time on things like character and plot development,
it's too busy blowing things up ... and they blow up real good.</P>
<P>     Keanu plays Jack Traven who works on a bomb squad and points his
gun at every conceivable angle when entering a room while trying to
eradicate the last remnants of his valley-boy accent from the BILL AND
TED movies with a steady, macho baritone register ... along with Jeff
Daniels, his partner and in the movie's opening they are trying to save
an elevator full of people from plummeting thirty floors or so unless
Dennis Hopper, our resident psychopath, gets a few million dollars
delivered to him.  We're asked to believe that the police forget to
check the freight elevators in one of which Hopper's hanging out (how
he plans to collect the money, due in a few minutes, from this
clandestine vantage point is not explained).  Well, our belief is
suspended about as well as the elevator and it soon comes crashing down
as well but not before they rescue the hostages.  Reeves and Daniels
corner the psycho in the basement discovering that he's taped a dozen
sticks of dynamite to his torso all ready to blow.... Keanu utters such
inanities as: "Give it up, you've got nowhere to go!" while Hopper
takes Daniels hostage with a gun--why I don't know since he can blow all
three of them to Kingdom come.  Why Keanu shoots Daniels in the leg is
equally stupid, but then Hopper walks out the door (why he doesn't
shoot both of them is anybody's guess) and there is a huge explosion on
the other side.  How in the world Hopper survives the explosion is
simply never explained....  Well, that pretty much sets the tone for
the film, full of action and would-be suspense, and utterly
nonsensical.</P>
<P>     The main part of the film, of course, concerns the bus that can't
slow down or it will explode....  Matthew Broderick's buddy from FERRIS
BUELLER'S DAY OFF is one of the passengers, a tourist, sporting a deep
tan, and spends most of the movie rolling his eyes and muttering to
himself, probably wishing he was kicking a Ferrari through a plate
glass window instead of being on the "wrong bus."  There is some
chemistry between Jack and Annie (Sandra Bullock) who takes over as
driver of the runaway bus.  Bullock is good here but as the movie wears
on, our credulity is further stretched as their conversations become
flirty and casual as she drives along hardly glancing at the
speedometer or the road at some points.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile Hopper is monitoring all this action, ostensibly, from
the overhead television newscopters live footage on the local news.
Later we find out he's monitoring the action in another way in another
laughable revelation.  Hopper isn't that great of a psycho, he concedes
too much, he gives away too much information about himself in flagrant
clues to his would be victims.  We never *really* find out what Hopper's
beef is.  There's some talk about how he used to be a cop (again,
echoes of IN THE LINE OF FIRE), how he lost a finger and got put into
retirement and was pissed off cuz he got a gold watch.  So what?
Doesn't really add up to a motive for all the mayhem.  Keanu snarls his
lip while yelling things at him over the phone like:  "I'm going to rip
out your spine!"  (They got this line from THE RUNNING MAN).  Oh,
please!</P>
<P>     There are other problems.  Never mind the fact that it would be
logistically impossible to keep a bus at the speed limit on the Santa
Monica freeway for almost any length of time...  After a while they get
onto a highway under construction only to find out that two miles ahead
of them there is a fifty-foot stretch of highway that is simply not
there.  I almost laughed out loud at this sequence.  I thought for a
second that E.T. must be driving the bus because it literally *rises
up* of its own accord like Peter Pan.  We're not even given a long
shot of the bus making the jump from what I can remember ... you see the
bus take off then a shot of people screaming and being jostled around
inside the bus then you see the bus landing and driving on.  Perhaps
some physics major can demonstrate the impossibility of that stunt, but
you don't have to be one to see that the bus should have dropped like a
stone.  By this time I was wondering if they ever considered just
busting the glass on that speedometer and holding the needle all the way
to the right?</P>
<P>     They make it to an airport to drive around and around the
runways.  There is a truly great sequence (a la RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK)
where Keanu slides under the bus on a dolly while it speeds along
coming dangerously close to becoming road pizza.  This sequence just
about had me jumping into the row behind me.  I won't reveal the
physical impossibility of how Keanu and Bullock exit the bus at the end
but I could hear the audience members scoffing around me.  "Yeah,
right!"</P>
<P>     Well, every good action movie nowadays has to have at least two
climaxes and, of course, the obligatory mano-a-mano showdown and this
is no exception.  It takes place on the top of a subway car traveling
underground and is derivative of SILVER STREAK in more ways than one.</P>
<P>     SPEED seems to be another one in a long line of recent calculated
blockbusters that Hollywood has been churning out a lot of lately along
the lines of BATMAN RETURNS, CLIFFHANGER, JURASSIC PARK, and DEMOLITION
MAN ... movies that visually are wonderful to look at, technically
slick, expertly edited, yet also implausible, derivative and almost
utterly devoid of substance or meaning.  In terms of things like plot,
character and acting, they're a mess.  It's getting to the point where
I expect there to be a movie called "BOOM!" released.  BOOM! will be
just two solid hours of explosions.  No plot.  No characters.  No
actors.  No story.  Just explosions and great visuals.  Well,
fortunately every so often Hollywood does come out with suspenseful
thrilling gems like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THE FUGITIVE, and IN THE LINE
OF FIRE ... movies that have wonderful performances, believable and
engaging characters and events, and taut plot lines.  SPEED is in a
whole different ball park.  It will make a *whole* lot of money this
summer.  It is a fun ride if you accept and expect it for the junk food
entertainment that it is.  However, it's not much beyond that.</P>
