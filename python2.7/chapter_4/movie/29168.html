"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>

<P>The very thought of a film about an Irish-Catholic family struggling to make
ends meet in pre-WWII Liverpool is enough to make some people lapse into an
Angela's Ashes-induced coma.  Leave it to director Stephen Frears to breathe
a bit of much-needed life into the gloomy, dreary genre of
early-20th-century films about dirt-poor drinking-class UK families living
in their own filth.</P>
<P>While he's probably best known by the U.S. masses for directing John Cusack
in High Fidelity and The Grifters, or perhaps for his frocky flicks like
Dangerous Liaisons and Mary Reilly, Frears spent a big chunk of the '90s
making the two oft overlooked sequels in Roddy Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy
(the first was Alan Parker's The Commitments).  Working with the Rabbittes
in The Snapper and The Van must have honed Frears' skills in directing films
about close-knit families - something that shows with his latest project,
Liam.</P>
<P>The winner of two awards at last year's Venice Film Festival, Liam begins on
New Year's Eve, where a happy mum (Claire Hackett) and dad (Ian Hart,
Aberdeen) celebrate at a local pub while their three kids watch them.
They're a cheery lot, with Dad bringing home the bacon after hours of
grueling labor at the local shipyard.  But when the Depression costs him his
job, the man slips into one deep funk.  It doesn't help that his two oldest
children have to get jobs to pay the bills.  Con (David Hart) follows in his
father's blue-collar footsteps, while Teresa (Megan Burns) cleans houses
after school.  Even though Dad has consistently given to the church
throughout the years, he refuses their handouts in this time of need.</P>
<P>Most of the film is told through the eyes of Liam (Anthony Borrows), a
stuttering seven-year-old who has had the fear of God beaten into him by a
dominating Catholic-school priest (Russell Dixon).  The film's humor comes
via Liam's complete fear of religion and the consequences of committing the
tiniest sin.  Borrows, like most of the actors in the film (other than
Hart), has no acting experience, but does a remarkable job as his character
watches his family life disintegrate.  The finale is unbelievably tragic.</P>
<P>Liam was written by Jimmy McGovern, a working-class Brit who penned the
controversial Priest as well as the extremely dark television series Cracker
(both the U.S. and British versions).  The film is a bit of an emotional
biography for McGovern (as Frears explained after the world premiere of the
film at the Toronto International Film Festival), and it's not at all a
biopic about the lead singer of Oasis, you silly sod.</P>
