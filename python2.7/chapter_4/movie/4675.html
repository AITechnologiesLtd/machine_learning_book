<PRE>                               OCTOPUSSY (1983)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>OCTOPUSSY (1983) **1/2</PRE>
<P>        I had no idea what this movie was about but decided to watch 
it anyway because--hey, who can resist a title like that? And it makes 
you wonder what kind of woman actually has eight of those. Fine, I'm 
a pervert, but what kind of a reaction does a title like OCTOPUSSY 
expect to elicit?</P>
<P>        OCTOPUSSY is one of the more absurd episodes in the 
James Bond series, but then I'm pretty sure every Roger Moore effort 
tips the scale of absurdness. And when the female lead is someone 
named Octopussy, the absurdity springs up. The perversity seems to 
spring up too, at least in a small dose, especially when Octopussy 
reveals that her name was given to her by her father, who always 
called her "my little Octopussy." Funny, I didn't know Jerry Lee Lewis 
had a daughter.</P>
<P>        This time, Bond is out to some some Faberge egg forgers (the 
bastards!), led by Octopussy and her male partner Kamal (at least 
they didn't name him Octodick). Bond meddles in Kabal's business 
one time too many and ends up captive in his palace. He escapes, but 
comes back a little later to get some octopussy. The two find out 
afterwards that they have more in common than just compatible body 
parts and, when Kabal doublecrosses her by placing the customary 
atomic bomb (no Bond movie would be complete without one), 
Octopussy joins Bond's side.</P>
<P>        OCTOPUSSY has its share of good and bad scenes. Good--
the plane chase teaser, the auction scene, the train chase and the circus 
scenes at the end. Bad--the other plane chase, the stuffed sheep head 
dinner (which pushes the limits of good taste... Monkey brains are 
okay, sheep's heads, no.) and that overlong chase through the streets of 
India, culminating in one of the bad guys being impaled on a bed of 
nails. "Get off my bed!" an Indian yells. A failed comic relief moment, 
to say the least. Almost as bad as my Octodick joke.</P>
