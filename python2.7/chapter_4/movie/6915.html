<PRE>                       THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1997 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST (97) ** 1/5.  Directed by Ken Kwapis. Written
by Todd Graff. Photography, Peter Lyons Collister. Editing, Jon Poll. Music
by Cliff Eidelman. Production design, Rusty Smith. Produced by Howard W.
(Hawk) Koch Jr. & Graff. Cast: Fran Drescher (Joy Miller), Timothy Dalton
(Boris Pochenko), Ian McNeice (Grushinsky), Lisa Jakub (Katrina), et al. A
Paramount release. 100 minutes. PG.</P>
<P>Fran Drescher ("The Nanny"), an acquired taste, sounds like a flight of
migrating geese. Timothy Dalton is a very good, appealing actor whose
handsomeness improves with age (he is 50). He ought to be in more, major
movies. Here he reacts rather than act.</P>
<P>She plays Joy from Queens, teaches "science" at a school, meaning
hairdressing, make-up, pedicure and the like. A fire starts in the science
lab, she rescues various animals including a python (this is the first of
several not followed up potential gags or twists). The heroine makes
tabloid headlines.</P>
<P>He plays Boris Pochenko, the President-for-life of Slovetzia, a
postage-stamp-size country of eastern Europe that can be located on the map
only with a magnifying glass, if you look at (forgive me, Alfred) the North
by Northwest of Romania. A former Communist dictatorship the nation is now
a non-Communist dictatorship under Pochenko. Belatedly realizing that help
from the West calls for some westernization, and that charity begins at
home, the widowed President sends one of his yes-men to America to recruit
a teacher for his four children.</P>
<P>Ian McNeice,the best performer in the movie, is envoy Grushinsky, who,
misled by the headlines, takes Joy for a bone fide educator. (You should
always read the fine print). Realizing his mistake he still offers Joy the
tutoring job. Flown to Slovetzia, the beautician muddles through in her
teaching, charms the kids, tells it like it is, remains unflappable, takes
charge of everything and antagonizes the dictator. Any viewer with a mental
age over 6 knows that romance and democracy will blossom.</P>
<P>"B & B" is, in a sense, a far removed poor man's Frank Capra movie of the
post-modern persuasion: humble people or mavericks can make big changes in
others and in society. Joy is an American, therefore America is best. Joy
shows common sense, American common sense. There's a speechifying
opposition to Boris by young people who meet in a discotheque's
not-so-hidden back room. The music and counterculture are American,
therefore America is best.</P>
<P>Even by the pliable parameters of fantasy, the film is indigent in
imagination and rich in impossibilities. Everyone in Slovetzia speaks
English, from the nomenclatura to the kitchen help. The President's kids
look and sound American, in spite of the older boy   unsuccessful
attempting a Slavic accent.</P>
<P>Forget about logic and continuity. A subplot about the elder daughter and
her anti-Boris boyfriend is padding that gets nowhere. Elsewhere,before an
official ball begins, Joy and Boris start dancing to the violin of the
first musician who gets there. Next arrives the accordionist, but there are
no accordion sounds. Then the piano joins in, but it is followed --not
preceded-- by the entrance of the pianist. The early soundtrack  has a nice
soupcon of klezmer music, then the score becomes generic.</P>
<P>The whole thing is rather sloppily put together and very uneven as a
comedy. Most jokes and gags are not witty or humorous, nor do they give us
broad slapstick as in Marx Brothers films or the British combination of
broad and cool comedy -- as in the Ruritanian  (i.e. set in an imaginary
country) "The Mouse That Roared," "The Mouse on the Moon," "Romanoff and
Juliet" and others. Joy's slide-show jokes on Jesse Helms and Newt Gingrich
are not just lame, they have no legs.</P>
<P>Joy herself is a living joke, a Jewish-American Non-Princess who enriches
the language with Yiddishisms and assaults the eyes with tacky, blatantly
colored clothes that could bring back memories of toreador pants in
spandex.</P>
<P>The emblem of Slovetzia is a boar. It would be tempting to declare that the
film is more bore than boar, but this would be unfair since some bits
between lulls do make you chuckle or laugh. Like Joy's possessive mother
who carries her daughter's umbilical cord in her purse. Like the local
encyclopedia's entry for General Boris Pachenko who "in 1991 organized and
coordinated Operation Desert Storm." Like the arbitrary, sudden and funny
Evita-on-the-balcony spoof.</P>
<P>Less succesful is Joys insistence to have Boris take her to a sweatshop
factory so that he can get in touch with his people. To an artificial
chorus-from-nowhere rendering of the Communist anthem "The Internationale,"
the President  awkwardly schmoozes, Joy does a too brief, too vague
imitation of Sally Field on a platform in "Norma Rae" demanding
unionization</P>
<P>The President is like Uncle Josef Stalin  in hair, mustache, uniforms and
accouterments. Joy de-Stalinizes him with her homespun wisdom, her appeals
for better parenthood, her haircutting skills, her unexpectedly esthetic
advice for civilian suits. Dalton gets his morals fixed and his good looks
back, but he does not grab you, he never seems to have any kind of brains.</P>
<P>Ethnic jokes can get tedious or produce gems. Woody Allen's "The biggest
sin in my family is to buy retail" or Lainie Kazan's Jewish mother
receiving Peter O'Toole in  "My Favorite Year" are clever comic
contributions. In "B & B" there's little dialogue to remember. Still, near
the end there's a good line. Back in Queens, Joy is horrified at what her
mother gave her pet chicken: "You fed the chicken chicken?"  There is, too,
a remembrance of a high school musical version of "Rosemary's Baby." "I
love you, but don't keep me waitin' / This embryo belongs to Satan."</P>
<P>By now it is official that Hollywood is again relying heavily on female
audiences, making "women's pictures," and/or working in femme-appealing
elements even in action and disaster films as well as in a hybrid comedy
like "B &B."</P>
<P>I say "hybrid" because the movie falls partly into the venerable, escapist
Ruritanian category. The name comes from writer Anthony Hope who set his
romance-adventure story  "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1894) in the imaginary
country of Ruritania. Whether called Freedonia, Romanza, or Slovetzia, most
of those kingdoms or duchies were located within the old Austro-Hungarian
Empire, often in Romania --whose Transylvania also gave us Count Dracula.</P>
