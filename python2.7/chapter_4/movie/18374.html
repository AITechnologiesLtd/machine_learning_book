<P>Originally released in 1996, this film was obviously re-released to take
advantage of Jet Li's newfound American fame, after his attention-grabbing
performance in last summer's fourth installment of the LETHAL WEAPON series.</P>
<P>PLOT:
After the government's project 701 to transform certain people into
super-human fighting machines goes awry, one of the 701's has to protect the
rest of the city from the remaining super-warriors, who are all programmed
to fight like nobody's business, withstand bullets, fire and much, much
pain.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
How do you rate a movie that has some of the worst dialogue that you've
heard in a film in years, a plot that can only be described as a static
framework in which to insert many action sequences, and some of the best
fighting scenes this side of the crazy kung-fu battles from THE MATRIX
(7.5/10)? (No coincidence either, since Yuen Woo-Ping, is the same man who
choreographed the fighting stunts from both films.) Well, I guess I would
really recommend this movie to all those people who love to see eye-popping
fight sequences, since these are some of the coolest that I've seen in a
while. Most of them are set in fast-motion and incorporate all the creative
wizardry of a Jackie Chan fight, alongside the slickness of newcomer Jet Li,
and a frenetic shooting style via the eye of Daniel Lee. Now, if you like a
lot of action, but also prefer a good story with interesting characters,
that you'll be out of luck with this piece of film.</P>
<P>Also, prepare yourself to appreciate the dubbed voices of obvious phonies,
and the contrived hip-hop/rap soundtrack, which is somehow supposed to make
us feel more comfortable within this Hong-Kong film? I would've preferred a
less intrusive soundtrack myself. I think the wonderfully choreographed
battle sequences alone would entice folks to keep their goggles glued to the
screen. I know mine were whenever an action-packed scene popped up, while
everything else of mine quickly slinkied away whenever the cheesy plot,
melodramatic touches and awful dialogue returned to the proceedings. Check
it out if ONLY for the fight scenes, because they are truly a sight to
behold, but skip it altogether if cool combat scenarios within a crappy plot
and over-the-top enemies don't warm your salsa.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Beijing born Jet Li was a member of China's national Wushu demonstration
team in his early teens and was invited to perform for President Richard
Nixon. He was a Wushu world champion several times, stands 5'6", and was
born on April 26th, 1963.
Jackie Chan fans may recognize this film's lost former lover Yueh-lan as
actress Francoise Yip, who played Jackie Chan's love interest Nancy, the
motorcycle girl from RUMBLE IN THE BRONX.
This film's Hong Kong title is Hak Hap, and it was nominated for Best Action
Choreography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume & Make-Up Design, in the
1997 Hong Kong Film Awards.</P>
