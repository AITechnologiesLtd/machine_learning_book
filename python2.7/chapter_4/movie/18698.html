<PRE>Without Limits</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Billy Crudup and Donald Sutherland
Directed By Robert Towne
Running Time: 1 hour 57 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>Released with little fanfare, Without Limits is a pleasant diversion. The
film documents the life of athlete Steve Prefontaine (played by Crudup),
whos name probably means little to British audiences. An idolised long
distance runner, this film charters his life from his training in the
University of Oregon with coach Bill Bowerman (Sutherland), through to the
1972 Munich Olympic games, and ends with the tragic car crash he was in at
the young age of 24. There's also thrills, suspense and romance in the form
of Mary Marckx (Monica Potter) along the way.</P>
<P>Appearing from accomplished writer Robert Towne, Without Limits is a well
made documentary. The performance, writing and acting are above average, and
all account to a good time. New actor on the block Billy Crudup is good as
Prefontaine, and the audience can relate easily to him. He gets an
unfortunate moustache later on in the film, but this doesn't stop him
delivering an good performance. Monica Potter has great charm as the love
interest, although she isn't given much to do. She looks nice, and acts
well. The ubiquitous Matthew Lillard makes an appearance as one of
Prefontaine's team mates, but the acting award goes to a magical performance
by the ever reliable Donald Sutherland. Every film he's done, whether Animal
House (1979) or Outbreak (1995) he delivers a good performance, but here
he's got a meaty part, and gives it his all. It really is a superb
performance, playing the 'father figure' in a good way.</P>
<P>The script, by Towne and Kenny Moore, is good enough, even though all the
source material is written out for them in history. The dialogue isn't too
bad, though, although occasionally it can get a bit sappy with the romantic
scene between Pre and Mary (a common problem in today's movies.) It doesn't
detract, however. The direction is also very good. Towne makes the actors in
the movie look like the real persons at the time, and uses stock footage of
the actual events, and mixes them well with the filmed footage. Largely
seamless. There's also some good use of montage throughout the film, and a
well selected period soundtrack with some good tunes.</P>
<P>It's a shame this film won't be seen by many people (it only made around $1
million in the U.S during it's cinema run) as this is good entertainment.
Never overdoing it, the audience doesn't feel manipulated throughout with
the movie, even with a typical Hollywood funeral scene. Charming
performances, good direction and decent writing make Without Limits one of
the most pleasant surprises of the year, and is worth watching.</P>
