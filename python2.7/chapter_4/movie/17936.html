<PRE>**1/2 out of four</PRE>
<P>Starring David Spade, Sophie Marceau. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>In many comedies, energy is everything. The quickness of the pace, the feel
of the script and the gusto of the stars can make or break a comedy. A movie
with energy can easily involve the audience in the action, while a film
lacking it has to work harder to obtain momentum in other areas. Energy is
especially important if a movie lacks some of the other qualities necessary
for a good comedy, such as originality, or a solid script. Sheer energy is
where David Spade's new vehicle Lost and Found almost overcomes its many
faults. Most of David Spade's major movie roles have come as a
"second-stringer", usually surrendering the spotlight to two-time co-star
Chris Farley, in movies such as the cult hit Tommy Boy and the despicable
Black Sheep. The untimely death of Farley and the fact that Spade is just a
very funny guy, finally earned him a starring role, and it's a doozie. He
plays Dylan, a struggling restaraunt owner who falls for his beautiful new
neighbor, Lila. The problem is that while he's a pop-culture American, she
speaks five languages and is a professional (although career-less) celloist
and she's got a cocky ex-husband who tags along and is determined to compete
with Dylan for her, although she tends not to like him. So to get the upper
hand, Dylan decides to steal her dog, in the hopes that he, benevolent as he
is, could look for it with her, and that she'd get to like him. He was only
planning on it being a few hours, tops, and then he would return the dog and
be a hero. But the dog eats his brother's diamond engagement ring that he
asked Dylan to keep, so now returning the animal is out of the question. He
must wait until the dog passes the ring out. The only problem: Lila's
conniving ex finds out about Dylan keeping the dog and wants to expose him as
the jackass that he is.</P>
<P>Indeed, the film elicits quite a few laughs during its short running time,
many of them thanks to the divinely funny David Spade, whose ordinary guy
charm not only gets his character out of many compromising situations but
also engages us in him and the movie's mediocre script. And the climactic
scene, which I will not reveal except to say that it is an odd ode to Neil
Diamond, featured Spade -- for the first time in his movie career -- being
daring.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we've seen all of this before. Much of Lost and Found was
clearly inspired by the success of last year's There's Something About Mary,
with the same kind of humorous dog abuse (if such a thing exists) and raunchy
humor. The subplot about trying to save the business by catering a big party
is straight out of the box-office flop (but cinematic success) Simply
Irresistible. Sucking up to the banker to obtain a loan is also nothing new.
David Spade manages to squeeze a serviceable amount of laughs out of tired
devices, but face it, it's not as funny the second time.</P>
<P>This would be forgiveable if only Lost and Found was as sap-less as There's
Something About Mary or Simply Irresistible. Unfortunately director Jeff
Pollack settles for that old hanky (panky?) ending, complete with a heart-
wrenchingly lame apology, followed by a jokey line of acceptance, the
obligatory kiss, immediately followed by the vomit on the person sitting in
front of me. It never fails to disgust me how modern filmmakers are always
willing to insert the "couple reunion" conclusion into so many comedies. I
think audiences are too smart to fall for that anymore. The formula is no
longer a hanky-fest, it's a cringe-fest for nearly everyone watching.</P>
<P>It's a shame that David Spade's exuberant efforts are wasted, because he
can't quite save this comedy, although he sure comes close. I choose to look
at this as a sign of a bright future for a talented comedian, rather than a
complete waste. If more people see this movie the way I do, perhaps we've
found our next Jim Carrey.</P>
