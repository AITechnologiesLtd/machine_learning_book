<PRE>                                   BURGLAR
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1987)</PRE>
<P>        BURGLAR, as a whole, is boring, confusing, incoherent, and not
particularly funny.  However, two fine comic performances almost salvage
the film and make it somewhat worthwhile.  Whoopi Goldberg is perfectly
cast as a cat burglar whose masculine behavior challenges traditional
sex-role stereotypes.  The film makes good use of Goldberg's talent for
drifting in and out of a wide range of characters.  Goldberg's multiple
personalities provide about half the fun and humor in BURGLAR; the Bobcat
provides the other half.</P>
<P>        Comedian Bob "Bobcat" Goldthwait almost steals the movie with his
hilarious performance.  In his largest film role to date, Goldthwait plays
Goldberg's best friend, a poodle hairdresser.  Goldthwait successfully
incorporates material from his stand-up act into the film.  Nearly every
one of Goldthwait's scenes evokes laughter, which is quite a feat since the
laughs in BURGLAR are few and far between.  Goldthwait's performance is
more restrained than usual, making BURGLAR his best work to date.  Lesley
Ann Warren also stands out as the yuppie dentist who hires Goldberg to
commit a burglary.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, these amusing performances are BURGLAR's only merit.
The movie's plot is uninspired and muddled, leaving the viewer confused
and ignorant of the mystery's solution.  Goldberg's character, after an
hour of detective work, figures everything out, but she and the film fail
(or forget) to enlighten the audience about her conclusions.</P>
<P>        Perhaps BURGLAR's main problem is its ineffective mixture of
suspense and comedy.  Many films, such as BEVERLY HILLS COP, have
successfully assimilated comedy and action into one package.  BURGLAR, on
the other hand, fails to do so and consequently suffers from a lack of
direction.  The movie would have been more appealing had it committed
itself exclusively to comedy or to suspense.  Given the cast, comedy would
seem to have been the appropriate path to follow.</P>
<P>        Goldberg, Goldthwait, and Warren succeed in giving BURGLAR  a few
genuinely funny moments, but the laughs are just too infrequent to give the
movie any significant momentum.  With a stronger sense of direction
(towards comedy), BURGLAR could have been thoroughly entertaining, but as
is, one's appreciation for the film is limited to the cast's noble efforts
to salvage it.</P>
