<PRE>                                  ONLY YOU
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     So what if it is only a romantic fairy tale, a comedy, the kind
they used to do in the 1930s?  Maybe that is what we need right around
now after so many heavy films, something we can just sit back and enjoy
and laugh and not worry about whether or not anything up on the screen
could possibly happen.  If you are in the mood for that, this is you
movie.</P>
<P>     Marisa Tomei is so pretty in a non-Hollywood way, so wholesome and
lovable that you just wish you could hold her in your arms and live
happily ever after.  When, as Faith, she meets up with Peter (Robert
Downey Jr.) another handsome, non-grunge, and he needs only one glimpse
to fall completely in love with her, we are delighted for them.</P>
<P>     When Faith was a child, her Ouija board came up with the name,
D-A-M-O-N B-R-A-D-L-E-Y, as the man she would one day meet and marry.
Now, grown up, Faith visits a Fortune Teller who sees in the crystal
ball the name, Damon Bradley; Faith realizes this can be no mere
coincidence.  But she is about to be married to a podiatrist.  And when
her fiance's old school friend, on his way to Venice, Italy, phones to
wish her well, and HIS name is Damon Bradley, well!</P>
<P>     Her sister-in-law and best friend, Kate (Bonnie Hunt), is having a
problem with her husband's infidelity so when Faith says she absolutely
must go to Venice in search of Damon Bradley, Kate takes off with
her.   There they meet Peter, a shoe salesman,  who pretends that he is
Bradley ... and the fun really starts with many twists and turns and
one delightful surprise following another.</P>
<PRE>     It's a movie to enjoy.</PRE>
<P>     Rounding out the cast are Joaquim De Almeida, Fisher Stevens,
Billy Zane, Siobhan Fallon, John Benjamin Hickey and Adam LeFevre.</P>
<P>     Written by Diane Drake.  This is her first produced screenplay.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Norman Jewison.</PRE>
