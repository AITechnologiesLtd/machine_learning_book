<PRE>The Apostle
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) Sonny sees a car crash not as a tragedy but as an
opportunity. He's not a lawyer, though; he's a preacher. </P>
<P>When we first meet Sonny, he is fortunate enough to come upon an accident
just after it happened. He grabs a Bible and runs to one of the cars. Sonny
is able to comfort the semi-conscious, bleeding occupant, and save his soul
before the cops chase him off. </P>
<P>Thus opens THE APOSTLE, Robert Duvall's directing debut. Duvall also stars,
playing Sonny, a traveling Alabama preacher. Sonny is on the road so much
that his family is breaking up. His wife Jessie (Farrah Fawcett) has started
seeing another man, and she's ready for divorce. On top of that, she manages
to vote Sonny out of the church that he himself founded. </P>
<P>Sonny still loves his wife and kids, so when Jessie's lover has the audacity
to stand between him and his own children, Sonny snaps. He beats the other
man to death with a softball bat. (In a culturally revealing echo from the
beginning of the film, the bystanders do not administer CPR to the dying
man, they collectively pray over him.) </P>
<P>Sonny isn't stupid. He knows he lost his head and that he was terribly
wrong. But rather than stay in his own forsaken community and face the
music, Sonny ditches his car, his ID, and his name. He becomes "The Apostle
E.F." and sets off on foot looking for a sign from the Lord. </P>
<P>He is led to a small town where he hooks up with the local preacher to found
a new church. </P>
<P>That's it. That's the plot. If that summary makes it sound a little
open-ended, it is. Plotwise, a lot happens in the first third of the movie,
and then the pace changes drastically. When Sonny/E.F. settles in to his
newly adopted home town, the slow process of building a church begins. The
last two-thirds of the movie is relatively uneventful, giving the movie an
aimless, endless quality. </P>
<P>When it comes time for the movie to end (about 20-30 minutes too late), it
comes from out of the blue. In fact, in an otherwise "realistic" film, it
takes a miracle (a kitchen radio changes stations unexpectedly) to bring
about the movie's conclusion. It's as though Duvall knows only how to direct
actors, and not how to handle a plot. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, the movie has a lot going for it. Robert Duvall (the actor) is
very good in this film. In fact, it may be his best acting ever. He feels
natural in the role. When he's preaching, he is so caught up in the emotion
and the words, it's as if Duvall really is preaching and not acting. Even
when he's not preaching, Duvall captures the quirks and mannerisms of a
plain, friendly, extroverted man; the type of man that everyone likes and
nobody knows. </P>
<P>Sonny has a healthy outlook for a movie character - for anyone - to have.
He's not in his job for the money, he's in it because he loves it. Sonny
knows his faults and prays forgiveness for his sins, but he doesn't dwell on
them. He simply lives each day as the Good Lord gives it to him. </P>
<P>Also, in a refreshing twist, the film deals with religion without a hint of
cynicism or hypocrisy. One could infer some irony in that this preacher has
committed murder and fled the crime, but Sonny doesn't preach perfection, he
preaches repentance and salvation as an alternative to eternal damnation.
Given his character and the approach of the film, there is nothing
hypocritical in Sonny's chosen path. </P>
<P>I can appreciate everything that was right in the movie, but unfortunately,
the whole experience didn't measure up. In spite of the interesting
characters and fresh look at southern religion, my overall impression is
that the movie was aimless and too long. That's too bad because I was really
rooting for Duvall. He is a good actor, and he's a good actor's director,
but it seems he's just not cut out for pulling a film together.</P>
