<P>A film with a title as long and clunky as I Know What You Did Last
Summer poses a problem for film makers:  what should be done in the case
of a sequel?  Well, it wouldn't suffice to shorten it to something like
I Know 2 or Summer 2; so, the makers of this particular sequel came up
with the even-longer I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  The only
problem with this title is that the "summer" in question was two summers
ago in the context of this film.  A more appropriate title would have
been I'm Still Aware of What you Did Two Summers Ago, or You Know What
You Did Two Summers Ago?  Well, I Still Know.  If they make a third film
in the series, we might have something like Remember Me?  I'm The Guy
Who Knows What You Do in the Summer, and I'm Back for More!</P>
<P>And yet, something tells me that more time was spent naming this film
than actually thinking about it, for I Still Know... is a film so
painfully awful and pointless that it makes me realize just how vapid
the horror-film genre can be.  I've written a lot about violence
pornography lately, but no film illustrates my point better than this
one:  this film is banking on its excessive and exploitative use of
violence and gore.  The picture fails on a fundamental level:  I can
appreciate successful pornography to a degree, but I Still Know... is
not scary.  It's not disturbing.  It's a stupid and hateful chunk of
hackwork without a glimpse of intelligence or worth.  And, to top it all
off, it features every cliche known to the genre:</P>
<P>1.  The heroine survivor of the first film, Julie James (Jennifer Love
Hewitt), is having nightmares about her horrible experience.  In
response to this, she never hesitates to investigate strange noises in
the dark while holding a sharp knife.  The strange noises usually turn
out to be Karla (Brandy), who is too-cool-for-words.</P>
<P>2.  Since the film can't take place in a setting similar to the first
film, the girls conveniently win a vacation to go to the Bahamas.  They
win by incorrectly guessing the capital of Brazil (they say Rio, when,
in fact, it is Brasilia...but this has a point later!).  Even though
Julie really misses her boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), the two
girls bring along Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and Will (Matthew Settle) for
sexual reasons.</P>
<P>3.  Well, when they arrive at the Bahamas, there are some convenient
discoveries:  it's storm season, and there won't be any boats going to
or from the island.  Also, there are no guests because it's storm
season.  The only people present are a few employees of the hotel. 
Since police officers are useless in horror films anyway, it's no big
deal that the hotel has no security guard or anything like that.</P>
<P>4.  People start dying.  The Bad Dude in a Slicker with a Hook goes
around sticking his weapon in people's mouths and hands, and plunges
giant sharp objects into people who pose no threat whatsoever.  Later
on, the killer's identity is discovered and everyone who had more than
three lines survives.  But this isn't before a profoundly dumb series of
plot devices is employed to land our heroes in a final confrontation in
a tropical rainforest.</P>
<P>>From a screenwriting standpoint, I have trouble believing that someone
over the age of ten composed this script.  To call it amateurish is
pretty kind; I'm more inclined to believe that a middle-school
horror-flick freak wrote it as a joke for his friends.  I mean, come on,
I've seen horror films that aren't entirely original, but I Still
Know... is pathetic.  The Bad Dude in a Slicker with a Hook, like Freddy
and Jason and Michael Myers, is really good at killing people violently,
never being seen, and instantly cleaning up his mess so the person who
saw the dead body looks crazy to all her friends.  In addition, he has
immense strength, and can lift hundreds of pounds with one arm.</P>
<P>The acting is very bad.  I love to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt, but
she just isn't any good in this movie.  She's at her best when she's
being nice, but the rage part of this (shouting "Come and get me!  I'm
right here!" in the rain) doesn't quite work.  Brandy is spunky and all
that, but really just annoying.  Settle and Prinze, Jr. do what they can
with non-characters, but Phifer is the absolute worst, mixing dreadful
overacting with his dreadful dialogue.  There aren't any characters
anyway, so caring about any of these people is not an option.  </P>
<P>But let's talk about the violence.  The movie was incompetently
directed by Danny Cannon; even a lousy script can be turned into
something slightly interesting and suspenseful by a good director, but
Cannon seems to think that huge bursts of music are scary.  He seems to
believe that people walking down dark hallways is frightening.  He
obviously thinks that teenagers want to see buckets of blood, because
that's the only thing you can count on getting out of I Still Know... 
But, unfortunately, Cannon just wants to exploit the violence.  We don't
care about characters who are introduced and killed in the same scene --
it's nothing but gratuitous crap.  The scariest movies I've seen leave
everything up to the imagination:  Seven and The Shining qualify as
truly frightening films, because they have a level of humanity that the
typical teen-slasher ignores completely.</P>
<P>It upsets me to know that teenagers live and die for this kind of
thing, and that Hollywood is happy to provide it for them.  I Still
Know...  is as bad as they come -- it makes me realize the good things
about a moderately stylistic film like Urban Legend, and the interesting
character aspects of H20.  While watching people get stabbed and diced
to bits for no other reason than to please popcorn munchers, I got a
sick feeling in my stomach.  No thought was put in to this movie -- it
exploits mindless violence for the purpose of making money.  </P>
<P>This is not a moral issue; I can live with a film that just wants to
entertain, as long as it at least tries to be art in even the vaguest
way.  I Still Know..., like too many movies, has been made for the sole
purpose of making money.  It's rare that a film so bad is also so
inherently offensive.  Violence can be art, but not like this.  Violence
can even be funny if its done in the right way.  I'm not saying that I
expected this film to be smart or satirical, but I at least expected it
to do its job.  It makes me wish that a thoughtful script were more
important than a lot of dead bodies.  The fact that it's not worries me.</P>
