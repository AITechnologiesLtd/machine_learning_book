<PRE>                                 THELMA AND LOUISE
                       A film review by James Davis Nicoll
                           Copyright James Davis Nicoll</PRE>
<PRE>                                   May 31, 1956</PRE>
<P>     THELMA AND LOUISE is the most recent attempt by Hollywood to cash
in on sci-fi.  The film is set 35 years in the future and the director
chose to avoid the cliches of other B films (Giant insects, Atomic war,
Alien invasions) and try for a more 'realistic' feel by looking at the
future from the point of view of two women.  I suppose it is the same
reason UNCLE TOM'S CABIN used a coloured man as the main character; you
get a different perspective from underneath.  I'm a big fan of sci-fi,
and I had high hopes for this film, but unfortunately, what Ridley Scott
has produced is a smutty dystopia, whose technology is scarcely more
advanced than our own.</P>
<PRE>     First Big Mistake: The Setting</PRE>
<P>     Scott chose to set THELMA AND LOUISE in a backwater state.  While
this means he didn't have to pay for the expensive sets portraying a
futuristic city, which his accountant no doubt thanked him for, it also
means that the two characters spend most of their time driving around
scenery that seems not to have changed in any major way in the next
three and a half decades (well, once or twice, you do get to see what
seems to be the Interstate and National Defense road system, but that's
just something we're working on *now*, scarcely futuristic).  Now, while
it makes sense that the two women would want to keep to the backroads,
surely in 35 years, we'd have better backroads than dirt and the
occasional hardtop.</P>
<PRE>     Second Big Mistake: The Story</PRE>
<P>     THELMA AND LOUISE is at best described as pornographic.  Sex scenes
abound, and the subject of sex seems to be a major theme in the movie.
Now, there's nothing wrong with the occasional kiss or whatever, if it
is handled with taste, but this movie goes far beyond good taste.
Worse, it is inconsistent.  On one hand, Scott presents a future where
women apparently have relations with men on a fairly casual basis (One
of the women claims not to have "had" any one but her husband, but falls
into bed with a hitchhiker the women pick up and the other woman acts
pleased that this happened), but women also seem to be the target of
continual unwanted advances, and if the comments of the older woman are
correct, women who are raped can't hope to be believed (although given
the easy nature of the two women in this film, it is easy to see why).
Is sex good or bad?  Don't ask Mr. Scott, because he doesn't seem to
have made up his mind.</P>
<PRE>     Third Big Mistake: The Technology</PRE>
<P>     To put it mildly, Ridley Scott's 1991 is not very advanced, given
the 35 years that have supposedly gone by.  The cars don't have fins.
Ovens have gotten smaller.  There are no videophones, though, and
although I looked hard, there didn't seem to be very many pieces of
technology that we couldn't built today.  They have "microwave ovens,"
which makes sense (radar can cook things *fast*!), they have
radio-controlled TV (same programs as we have, judging by the sound
track in the scene where the FBI is watching TV).  Because Scott tries
hard to look at the future from the perspective of someone living in
that future, what new technology is shown isn't explained.  Why do
people have radar dishes in their back yards?  What is that TV-like
screen one FBI man is studying?  We never find out.  It would have
worked better as a sci-fi film if Scott had figured out a way to put the
technolgy more in the spot-light.</P>
<P>     The police do seem to have advanced slightly.  They have flocks of
helicopters, and the police cars have megaphones on them (again, nothing
we couldn't do).  On the other hand, the cops seem to have softened in
35  years; one policeman seems to care more about the two murderers he
is chasing than he does the man they killed, and another is shown crying
as soon as he is threatened.  Are men supposed to be all soft crybabies
or drooling apes in 1991?  </P>
<P>     Even weapons don't seem to have changed much.  No blasters or ray
guns for Mr. Scott.  The women have a revolver and an automatic and the
police have rifles.  The rifles looked unfamiliar, but were never used,
so I couldn't tell if they were any better than the rifles the army uses
now.  Again, there didn't seem to be any radical changes, just a lot
more of what we have now.</P>
<P>     THELMA AND LOUISE is a sci-fi film that suffers from a terrible
lack of vision on Ridley Scott's part.  His future is not much different
from our present, except that it has more sex, funny looking cars, and a
lot of helicopters.  I had to agree with the despairing note the movie
ends on; THELMA AND LOUISE is just a bleak, pornographic version of our
present, with the slight advances in technology more than made up for by
social decay.  This is not a future I would want to live in.</P>
