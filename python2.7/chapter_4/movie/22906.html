<P>Get excited everybody, we finally got ourselves a really good movie in the
year 2000! It only took a little over a month but SCREAM 3 has arrived,
tagged to a solid storyline, bloodstained action, a great cast, slick
dialogue, an unpredictable ending and cameos all around. If you liked 1 & 2,
you'll scream for numero 3!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Poor l'il Sydney has moved to L.A. and isolated herself from the outside
world. In the meantime, the third movie based on her life, called STAB 3, is
being filmed in and around the Hollywood lots. It isn't until the actual
cast members of the film start getting killed in real life, that Sydney
decides that it's time to come back out into the world and face up to her
past...and a nutjob who goes by the name of ghostface!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The end of this trilogy is a solid hit on all counts with plenty of
suspense, intrigue, bloody murders, big boobies and cool in-jokes to satisfy
any SCREAM fan who had been patiently tolerating all of the lame-brain
wannabees over the past few years. This one kept me and my buddy guessing
about the killer the whole way through, and with typical Craven pinnache,
everyone in the cast seemed to be a suspect at some point or another. Of
course, I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that I was satisfied
with the conclusion, and certainly didn't guess it before it was revealed.
It was definitely a much better finale than the lame one that the sequel had
tossed our way a few years back. The cast in this film was another thumb up,
with everyone involved doing their share to make this film as authentic as
any other. This time around, most of the story seemed to center around the
Cox and Arquette characters, and both actors came through on their
respective counts. In fact, Arquette and Parker Posey are both excellent in
this film, with each one coming up just enough laughs to keep things light
between killings. Jenny McCarthy also clocked in a decent performance
alongside her boobs who delivered their lines perfectly while demonstrating
great versatility and range.</P>
<P>The twists and turns in the film were also well handled and intelligently
written, and will likely leave the proverbial scary movie "that doesn't make
any sense" complaints outside the theater. The big opening scene is just
that...a big opening scene, which lives up to its predecessors and delivers
the bloody goods as always. Overall, I guess I am also kind of glad that
this will be the final one because it is a very good movie, and I would
rather remember this trilogy as just that, instead of it turning into a
tired ol' parody of itself over and over and over again. In fact, that's
probably the only thing that I did hold against this film, and that is the
fact that despite it being an original tale set among actual Hollywood
soundstages, the overall framework of the movie is basically the same.
Ghostface wants to kill Sydney...ghostface kills others who get in the
way...now let's guess who ghostface is. Thankfully, they ended the trilogy
on a real high note with this winner.</P>
<P>And contrary to some initial reports, the violence in this film is still all
there, in fact, I got the impression that this installment had an even
higher body count than either one of its previous incarnations...but don't
quote me on that. The pacing was also solid with a little setup, some
action, some blood, some background story, more action, more murders and so
on and so forth. Pretty neat if you dig that kind of shtuff. The one thing
that is for sure is that you definitely have to be a fan of the first two
movies to truly enjoy this one. In fact, I would suggest re-watching them
both before checking this one out, cause this is definitely a continuation
of the story, and many references to the previous films abound. All in all,
this scary movie is the perfect bookend to the successful trilogy that
jumpstarted the teen horror genre back in the late 90s. It's packed with
murders, humor, suspense, cheap scares, pretty girls, hip dialogue and a
legitimately surprise ending. Sound like something you'd like? Well what are
you waiting for then...get out there and scream your ass off! And what is
your favorite scary movie??</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Okay, so we all know by now that the girl who once appeared in Bruce
Springsteen's 1984 "Dancing in the Dark" video, Courteney Cox, married
SCREAM co-star David Arquette in June of 1999. But did you know that one of
David's earliest big screen roles was as "Benny" in the original BUFFY THE
VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, and that Courteney dated the original BATMAN, Michael
Keaton, for about six years? Courteney is also infamous for having been the
first person to say the word "period" on American TV (it was a Tampax
commercial), and David leads the band Ear 2000, whose single "The Race"
appeared on the SCREAM 2 soundtrack, and whose next single "Click Click"
appears on this film's soundtrack.
Neve Campbell recently admitted to having suffered a "nervous breakdown" at
the tender age of 14, which resulted in complete hairloss. Intensive
acupuncture grew it back.
When actor Patrick Dempsey got married in 1987, he was 21 years old. His
bride was 48.
Jenny McCarthy was Playboy Playmate of the year in 1994. In 1998, she had
her breast implants removed.
Remember when the producer of this film, Kevin Williamson, was the
screenwriting "toast of the town"?
Well, the latest kid on the block is the writer of this flick, Ehren Kruger.
He was the man behind the pen for last year's ARLINGTON ROAD (7/10) and he
also wrote the upcoming Ben Affleck thriller, REINDEER GAMES.
Two of the working titles for this film were SCREAM 3: GHOSTFACE KILLER and
the simpler GHOSTFACE.</P>
