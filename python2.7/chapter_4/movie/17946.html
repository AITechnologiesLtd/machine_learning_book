<P>David Cronenberg takes a little time off before his official designation as
president of the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, and presents us with another
strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head. Shot in his
hometown of Toronto, David tosses in a little more Canadian content by the
way of Sarah Polley, and delivers his possibly over-saturated version of
alternate realities into the cinematic community. Think THE GAME (8.5/10)
meeting STRANGE DAYS (8.5/10) in a dark, creepy alley.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Futuristic virtual reality game super-creator Alegra Geller, runs into
opposition from people who call themselves "realists", who not appreciate
the propagation of her makeshift universe games, including her latest and
greatest one, called eXistenZ. Joined by her "bodyguard", Alegra runs
through her own game and her characters, in the hopes of escaping her
enemies.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Dark, moody, interesting science-fiction melange of creative plot twists,
solid actors, an inventive and fresh premise despite my initial "been there,
seen that" resentment, and a truckload of gory, icky sequences accompanied
hand in hand by disgusting, yet overdone, squishy noises. This film managed
to keep me interested in its development, despite several moments of "are
they still in the game?" frustrations, and stamped a vote onto my approval
with a fun and appropriate conclusion. This movie is definitely not for
everyone. It's pretty graphic in its depiction of several skin-crawly
scenes, but does convince in its depiction of the futuristic world, and
their maneuverability within. Consider yourself in a game where everyone
else is programmed to react to what you do or say, and without any
cognizance of your own mission, and you might just get the gist of this
flick's foundation.</P>
<P>Be warned, this movie does not have much action in it, despite what the
electro-music-fooled trailer might have you believe, but it does put forth
an intriguing prophesy of our future, and deliver enough indirect
explanations to satisfy my peeked curiosity. And while most of the actors
were fine in their roles (I especially dig on Willem Dafoe in his most
psycho roles, and this one is pretty sweet), they aren't really the focus of
this story. The game of eXistenZ, the power of its creation and the
claustrophobic feel of the film make it a touch better than any other
play-by-numbers virtual reality trip. If you're any kind of a squeamish
person, or looking for the Kung-Fu and special-effect action a la THE MATRIX
(7.5/10), skip this sucker altogether, it is not for you. If, on the other
hand, you like dark and creepy films that play with your head and move along
at an even pace with twists and turns here and there, check this puppy out.
Just remember to check your back for port drillings before you leave the
theatre. You never know how real eXistenZ can be.</P>
