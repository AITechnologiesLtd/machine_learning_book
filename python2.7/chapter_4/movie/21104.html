<P>Steven Spielberg has a way with film. Does the man ever fail? In an era of
Hollywood where CGI is more commonly used then plot, Spielberg manages to tell
his stories in a way to captivate fans of all genres and get his point across.
His latest, Saving Private Ryan, examines World War II, and has the basic plot
of trying to save one man by risking the lives of eight. But, he is able to
tell many other stories and does it with such flair that I am still impressed. </P>
<P>The film starts off with D-Day, the invasion of Omaha Beach. It is a
twenty-five minute sequence that is the one of the most shocking lengths of
film in motion picture history. There is no introduction, you do not know the
characters, you just see men running for their lives trying to secure Omaha
Beach. For once, war is not glorified. Throughout the film, Spielberg displays
the image of men fighting for their country, but does not glorify the horror
that the men experience in battle. He shows his audience the gruesome aspects
of war, from dismembered body parts to shots in the head. This first sequence
of Saving Private Ryan is not for the weak at heart.</P>
<P>The film progresses to a special mission handed down to Captain Miller (Tom
Hanks) from his superiors. The mission: Miller and his platoon must scour the
lands to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers died in
action. Therefore, Hanks takes up his men to start the search. The casting of
Hanks' platoon was terrific. Ed Burns plays the tough-talking Private Reiben.
Tom Sizemore plays the by the rules Sergeant Horvath. Another outstanding
performance is turned in by Adam Goldberg who plays the somewhat cynical, but
humorous, Private Mellish. Through Goldberg's character, Spielberg expresses
the views of the Jewish, who were being persecuted by Hitler during the war.
But, in my opinion, the man who turns in the most unexpected performance and
steals the show is Jeremy Davies who plays Corporal Upham. He is brought along
to translate for the platoon and fight, and thinks of war as glorious battles
and a lovely brotherhood among soldiers. But, Spielberg displays the change he
sees as he experiences true war. </P>
<P>Tom Hanks, as always, gives a terrific, Oscar worthy performance. His character
is a quiet, yet powerful, leader who is torn between risking his life and his
men's life and his ticket out of the war. But, Spielberg displays through Hanks
the true glory of war. Captain Miller is a man who fights for his country and
follows all orders. Despite his objections, he risks his life and the life of
his men to save Private Ryan and get his ticket back to his home and his wife.</P>
<P>The film progresses with each story developing in a subtle way, yet each
getting their point across. Throughout their journey they fight the impossible
fight, almost break apart and go through such surprising moments, I was
genuinely shocked. We learn of Captain Miller's occupation (I won't spoil it
for you), a wall crashes and it is all of a sudden two opposing platoons with
weapons and no one willing to pull the trigger. Also, they find James Ryan, or
so they thought. And yet through all of this, the whole platoon is able to come
together through bonding and fights, against the enemy and against themselves.
All in all, they find Ryan when they find a way to coexist in harmony through
Hanks' leadership. It is a truly inspiring film, and Spielberg is able to make
the two and one half-hours seem like half that.</P>
<P>Saving Private Ryan is a truly cinematic masterpiece. Throughout the film,
Spielberg expands on one story to tell dozens. He yet again utilizes his entire
cast to portray war as a horrific experience, despite all of the glorifying
aspects of defending your country. Spielberg truly does have a way with film
and yet again shows that he can reach any audience and have them leave with a
truly new thought on life.</P>
