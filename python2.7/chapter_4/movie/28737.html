<PRE>SNATCH
------</PRE>
<P>Turkish (Jason Statham, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") and his 
partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are boxing promoters whose desire
for a new caravan plummets them into the nefarious dealings of fight fixing,
hit men, gun dealers, Piker gypsys, pawnbrokers, gamblers, 
body guards and dishonest diamond dealers from both sides of the Atlantic in 
writer/director Guy Ritchie's ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels")
"Snatch."</P>
<P>Ritchie's kinetic first film was a smash in his homeland, but only a cult
success in the U.S.  With "Snatch" he follows much the same formula but
brings in recognizable stars, most notably Brad Pitt as Mickey, an almost
incomprehensible Irish bare knuckle fighter who loves his mum (Sorcha Cusack).</P>
<P>The film begins with four Hassidic Jews gaining entry into an Antwerp jewelry
exchange - moments later Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro, "Traffic")
and his gang have absconded with the 86 caret stone that will change hands
repeatedly.  Frankie works for Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina, "Reindeer
Games") in NY, who contacts Doug the Head (Mike Reid) in London to
help bring Frankie in.  Frankie, it seems, has a weakness for girls and
gambling.  Frankie's London weapons contact, Boris the Blade
(Rade Serbedzija, "Eyes Wide Shut") is planning on robbing Frankie for
Brick Top (Alan Ford, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"), a ruthless
fight fixer.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Turkish and Tommy's fighter Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty)
is pummelled when pitted against the wily Mickey (Brad Pitt), so they
anger and become indebted to Brick Top by changing their fighter - to Mickey.
Pawnbroker Sol (Lennie James, "Among Giants"), his buddy Vinny (Robbie Gee,
"The Firm") and oversize, unskilled driver Tyrone (Ade) are like three Black 
Stooges who try to pull the Blade's job and run afoul of Brick Top.  Former 
soccer pro Vinny Jones ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") appears as
Bullet Tooth Tony, bodyguard to Brick Top and legendary hit man.</P>
<P>The pace is fast and furious, featuring editting montages (Jon Harris and
Les Healey) comprised of stills (Frankie's pleasure exploits) and near-stills 
(Cousin Avi's trip to London shown in two seconds flat) that are hilariously 
economical.  Ritchie even gets a "Run Lola Run" moment when he shows a
fateful dual car crash from opposite perspectives back to back.  Urgent
cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones ("Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels")
humorously captures the action, and, occasionally, sublime moments, like
when Mickey apparently floats horizontally through the air after a viscious
ring punch.</P>
<P>Ritchie's assembled a terrific ensemble here, from unknowns like Ford, who's
magnificently malicious and wickedly witty, to big stars like Pitt, who
shines here in a humorous offshoot of his "Fight Club" persona.  Ritchie's 
script may follow a formula, but his lines are deliciously inventive. 
(My favorite - when Brick Top asks 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, 
come again?').  Baby faced Tommy continues to wonder at the irony that 
has him and Turkish buying an ever more splendid and expensive caravan for 
Mickey when they originally went to him to purchase a used one.  Kudos, too,
to the unnamed Pikey pit bull whose loyalty brings luck.</P>
<P>Be warned - for all its humor, the film features extreme violence and some
gore, but simply put, "Snatch" is a blast.</P>
