<P>     Russ Meyer's resume reads like a list of B-movie exploitation 
classics.  Remember BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS?  How about MONDO 
TOPLESS, BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRAVIXENS, THE IMMORAL MR. TEAS, 
and WILD GALS OF THE NAKED WEST?  Then there's the director's current 
project-in-development, THE BRA OF GOD (co written by movie critic and 
DOLLS scripter Roger Ebert).  Of all of Meyer's films, however, perhaps 
the most memorable is 1966's FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL!  KILL!, the flick 
described by film maker John Waters as "beyond a doubt, the best movie 
ever made."  Considering the source, that just about says it all. </P>
<P>     In the 1960s and 70s, Meyer was to the silver screen what Hugh 
Hefner was to the printed page.  In fact, the paths of the two often 
crossed.  Meyer did several photo sessions for PLAYBOY (behind, not in 
front of, the camera) and a number of Playmates appeared in his movies.  
The director's ... ahem ... fondness for certain oversized female 
attributes is well-documented.  He cast all of his actresses based not 
on talent or ability, but on breast size.  A small-busted woman in a 
Russ Meyer film is as rare as one dressed conservatively. </P>
<P>     Although it features no nudity, PUSSYCAT is classic Meyer.  The 
three leads are all topheavy, the action-packed plot is paper-thin, 
there are loads of double-entendres amidst the cheesy dialogue, and the 
style is pure low-budget.  This is fun stuff, to be sure, but definitely 
of the "guilty pleasure" sort.  PUSSYCAT promises an entertaining 
eighty-plus minutes without offering one redeeming tidbit of social 
commentary.  This is camp at its best. </P>
<P>     The three women who strut their way through the film are Varla, the 
leader (played by part-Apache, part-Japanese Tura Satana); Rosie, her 
lesbian lover (Haji); and Billie, the bouncy blond (Playmate Lori 
Williams).  The wardrobe of the trio consists largely of leather boots, 
tight halters, and hot pants.  They love fast cars and when they 
encounter a clean-cut, all-American guy who's interested in racing 
against one of them, Varla takes up the gauntlet.  First, she defeats 
him on the track, then, out of the car, physically beats him to death.  
This leaves his helpless, apple pie-sweet girlfriend (Playmate Susan 
Bernard) in the clutches of the ruthless pussycats, whose next target is 
an old man (Stuart Lancaster) living with his two sons on an out-of-the-
way ranch.  Somewhere, he has a fortune stashed away, and Varla wants 
that money.  She doesn't care what--or who--she has to sacrifice to get
it. </P>
<P>     The sexes will probably enjoy PUSSYCAT for different reasons.  
While the attraction for men should be reasonably obvious, the draw for 
women (the heaviest renters of this "epic" on videocassette) isn't hard 
to understand, either.  This is a prime example of female empowerment.  
The pussycats consistently dominate the male characters, showing them up 
as wimps, dolts, or both.  Those who accused THELMA AND LOUISE of "man-
bashing" will probably pale at what goes on here--if they can stop 
staring at the canyon between Tura Satana's breasts. </P>
<P>     All this is probably terribly politically incorrect, but who cares?  
FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL!  KILL! is entertainment of the lowest and most 
pleasant caliber, and it slips into art theaters and retro venues in the 
midst of a 60s and 70s resurgence.  Times have changed, however.  On its 
original release, this movie was considered adult fare.  Thirty years 
later, had this been submitted to the MPAA, it would have garnered a PG-
13--suitable viewing for teenagers.  I guess plunging necklines and 
tight shorts aren't what they used to be....  Not that such a realization 
will hamper anyone's enjoyment of this, or any other, Meyer endeavor. </P>
