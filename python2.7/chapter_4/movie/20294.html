<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy, The Faculty) had been called `Ass Bag' and
`Queer' before his father finally settled on the nickname `Dildo.'
Dunph, as he is more commonly known, has spent his entire life in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island with his blue-collar old man (Alec Baldwin,
Mercury Rising), a three-legged dog named Cyclops and paraplegic kid
brother Jackie (Kyle & Ryan Pepi), who was injured falling off the roof
during a game of football.  Their mother died when both boys were
little.</P>
<P>Life in Pawtucket isn't too exciting for kids, and Dunph ends up
spending his evenings on the town's water tower, getting high with other
disenchanted neighborhood teenagers.  They all use fantastic slang when
talking about women, referring to their faces as `helmets,' breasts as
`floaters,' and rear ends as `toilets.'  And in Pawtucket, you don't get
to third base with a girl – you stink-finger her.</P>
<P>One night, while driving without a license and having his vision
impaired immense clouds of pot smoke, Dunph slams into a parked cop
car.  Thanks to a `connected' friend of his father, the judge's only
punishment is to make Dunph enroll in Cornwall Academy, a prep school in
central Connecticut.  When asked what prep school would actually prepare
him for, Dunph's old man grunts `to prepare you from not gettin' your
neck broke by me.'</P>
<P>Dunph sets off for Cornwall with thirty frogpelts from his pop and a
garbage bag full of personal belongings.  He instantly deduces that
there might be a period of adjustment when he shows up for orientation
in a dingy t-shirt and blue jeans, while everybody else is outfitted in
blue blazers and neckties.  Soon enough, Dunph finds a counterculture of
dope fiends and troublemakers, including a comely young woman named Jane
Weston (Amy Smart, Varsity Blues).</P>
<P>Essentially a typical coming-of-age film, Providence succeeds where
others asphyxiate from mediocrity, due to its production pedigree.  The
film is based on Peter Farrelly's novel of the same name and the book,
which was really sort of boring, was adapted here by Farrelly, his
brother Bobby (the guys that made There's Something About Mary) and
director Michael Corrente (American Buffalo).  Don't be fooled – this
isn't a slapstick comedy like Mary.  It's more character driven than
bodily fluid driven, but still entertaining nonetheless.  (1:38 - R for
pervasive teen drug use and strong language including sexual references)</P>
