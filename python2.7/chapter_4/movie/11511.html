<PRE>The Apostle
3/14/98</PRE>
<P>        Watching Robert Duvall's newest movie is a incredible experience. As the
film progresses you will begin to see what, quite possibly, is one of the
most unique and thought provoking movie I have ever seen. To call this film
anything less than a fascinatingly intense character study would be, in a
word, sacrilege.  </P>
<P>        At the start of the film you get the idea this isn't typical Hollywood
fair, Sonny(Robert Duvall) tells a injured young man and his wife about
God, and comforts them in their moment of need. Sonny may not be the
typical minister. He admits that he is flawed and that he has problems with
drinking and faithfulness to his wife,  Jessie(Farrah Fawcett). His wife
has had enough of his cheating and has an affair with a young minister,
Horace(Todd Allen). Sonny gets a little drunk and goes to talk with Jessie
at their son's baseball game. When Horace tried to stop Sonny from taking
his family away from the part, Sonny strikes him with a bat and he is put
in a coma. Sonny, fearing legal repercussions, flees to Louisiana. He meets
a few people and starts a church, along with a fellow minister, Brother
Blackwell(John Beasley). He knows, and the audience knows, that
Sonny(re-baptized Apostle E.F.) will not escape the long arm of the law.
How he changes the lives of several people in the town, shows you can be a
good Christian and a sinner. </P>
<P>        This film is easily one of the top five of the year, and a milestone in
Christian film making. Robert Duvall's performance is the best one I have
seen, since Billy Bob Thornton's incredible roll in Sling Blade. The script
it tight and the direction is great. I really loved this film's ability not
to be to preachy to the audience and doesn't force them to side with Sonny.
The movie's emotional look at the topic of religion and society is almost
refreshing. This is a triumphantly brilliant film, Duvall's performance is
the best of the year and deserves the Best Actor Oscar. Go see it!</P>
