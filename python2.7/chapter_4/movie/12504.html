<P>I'm not a professional movie reviewer, but I decided to give on for this
movie.</P>
<P>    If I frequent this sub, you will notice that I am very critical of
movies.  So any positive review is rare.  I consider my reviews are for the
"thinking" person, although there may be some "thinkers" who disagree.</P>
<PRE>    Deep Impact (1998)
    Cast:
    Morgan Freeman ... President Beck
    Robert Duvall ....... Spurgeon Tanner
    Téa Leoni ............ Jenny Lerner
    Elijah Wood .......... Leo Biederman
    Blair Underwood .... Mark Simon
    W. Earl Brown ....... McCloud
    Vanessa Redgrave . Robin Lerner</PRE>
<P>    Jenny Lerner happens upon what she thinks is a bland story about sex and
scandal in the White House.  She immediately finds herself in the midst of a
year long secret that a comet is headed for Earth and will impact in on
year.  What transpires after that is a race against time as citizens of the
world dash to safety.
Téa Leoni does a very good job with a fairly limited script as she provides
an eyebrow raising performance on the big screen.  The all-star cast
provides interesting psychological perspectives as they ponder their
respective fates.</P>
<P>    The plot of the movie itself is a good one, and for once my digest of
"Hollywood" endings was justified, as this movie pulled a 180 and provided
what I call a very realistic ending.  The special effects were precise, not
over done, yet quite reflective of the awesome power of a 1000 ft. tidal
wave.  And finally, a movie that DOESN'T ridiculously depict people
"outrunning" a shock blast (I.e., Independence Day).</P>
<P>    Unless you are an astronomical scientist, you will be hard pressed to
find any impossibilities in this depiction of special effects.  The only
draw back I saw in this movie, which was completely overshadowed by it's
very satisfying ending, was the poor realism of human behavior as a whole in
the face of imminent doom.  For example, with a year warning, no communities
or individuals were creating underground shelters of their own, especially
since there was not enough room in the military underground city to house
more than a million people.</P>
<P>I give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, one of my highest ratings.</P>
