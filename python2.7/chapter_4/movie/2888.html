<P>     With a legion of titles like PET SEMATARY, FIREWALKER,
SLEEPWALKERS, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, and CHILDREN OF THE CORN, it's
reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion
pictures.  Adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary
from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable.  There are a few
notable exceptions, however; two of which (STAND BY ME, MISERY) were
crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner.  While THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION is not a Reiner movie per se, it is a production of Castle
Rock Pictures (Reiner's film company), and ranks among the best filmed
versions of any King stories to date.</P>
<P>     Spanning the years from 1947 through 1966, THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION takes the "innocent man in prison" theme and bends it at a
different angle.  Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the
movie ventures down the less-traveled road of concentrating on the
personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once
they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and
iron bars.  As one of the characters puts it: "These [prison] walls
are funny.  First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you
start to depend on them."</P>
<P>     Filmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION is set in a place of perpetual dreariness.  What little
color there is, is drab and lifeless (lots of grays and muted greens
and blues), and there are times when the film is a shade away from
black-and-white (give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a
longtime Cohen brothers collaborator).  It's ironic, therefore, that
the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation.</P>
<P>     First time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of
impressive performances.  Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the
wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity.  Andy's ire is internal; he
doesn't rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that
has imprisoned him.  His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the
admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience
to identify with him that much more strongly.</P>
<P>     Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), or "Red" as his friends call
him, is the self-proclaimed "Sears and Roebuck" of the Shawshank Prison
(for a price, he can get just about anything from the outside).  His is
the narrative voice and, for once, the disembodied words aid, rather
than intrude upon, the story.  Serving a life sentence for murder, Red
is a mixture of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has
done a vile deed.  His friendship with Andy is one of THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION's highlights.</P>
<P>     William Sadler (as a fellow prisoner), Clancy Brown (as a sadistic
guard), and Bob Gunton (as the corrupt warden) all give fine supporting
performances.  Newcomer Gil Bellows, in a small-but-crucial role (that
was originally intended for Brad Pitt), brings the poise of a veteran
to his portrayal of Tommy Williams, Andy's protege.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the stand-out actor is the venerable James Whitmore,
doing his finest work in years.  Whitmore's Brooks is a
brilliantly-realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to
cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most
moving--and effective--sequences.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking
drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong
denouement.  The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little
slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap
up everything into a tidy little package.</P>
<P>     "Salvation lies within," advises Warden Norton at one point.  It
is the presentation of this theme that makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
unique.  Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of
a life behind bars.  While this film includes those elements, it makes
them peripheral.  THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is all about hope and,
because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic.</P>
