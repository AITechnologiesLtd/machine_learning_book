<PRE>SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It's a traditional setup:  put a man and a woman who seemingly hate each
other into isolation together and love will bloom.  That's the
tried-and-true setup of the new romantic adventure film Six Days, Seven
Nights, which gets the setup right... but doesn't know what to do from
there.</P>
<P>Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) is the busy New York editor at an upscale
fashion magazine. She has little time for romance, but when her
boyfriend Frank (David Schwimmer) invites her to a six-day, seven night
stay at a South Pacific resort, she accepts...just as she does to his
proposal for marriage.</P>
<P>When an emergency photo shoot in Tahiti beckons, Robin finds herself
hiring the services of Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), the only pilot on
the island.  However, a tropical storm forces their plane to crash, and
Robin and Quinn find themselves stranded on a remote island with little
hope of rescue.</P>
<P>Of course, the island is full of adventure.  From wild animals to
dangerous terrain to modern-day pirates, Robin and Quinn face danger at
every turn.  Will these dangers make them turn to one another?</P>
<P>Harrison Ford and Anne Heche actually make a convincing romantic
couple.  The actors do a good enough job to allow you to get lost in the
characterization, and forget about the actors' personal lives.  Neither
character is written very deep, but both Ford and Heche play their roles
with the appropriate combination of charm and likability.</P>
<P>On the supporting side, David Schwimmer is his traditional whiner...a
role which is easier to take in these small doses.  There to comfort him
is Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors), island entertainer and Quinn's
sometimes girlfriend. She doesn't have much to do beyond the bimbo role,
which she fills nicely.</P>
<P>It seems as if director Ivan Reitman is shooting for a Romancing The
Stone, or The African Queen sort of feel for the film.  But, though the
leads are  appealing, he doesn't have the story to back it up.</P>
<P>Aside from the romance, there's actually very little for the characters
to do.  The film tries to address that by throwing nearly every
shipwrecked-on-a-deserted-isle trick in the book at them (come on,
pirates?), but every obstacle seems overly artificial.</P>
<P>In the end, Six Days, Seven Nights is enjoyable...though more for its
romantic comedy elements than its sense of adventure.</P>
