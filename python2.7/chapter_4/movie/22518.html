<P>---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
film reviews every Friday morning on the 98.9 The Point morning show.---</P>
<P>Diamonds is a thoroughly enjoyable piece which owes its success to a 
remarkable ensemble cast and beautiful script that wisely shies away 
from devilish cliches and over-the-top poignancy for which many 
similar relationship films sell their souls. Those seeking a masculine 
version of movies like Anywhere But Here and fans of stars Kirk Douglas, 
Dan Akroyd and Lauren Bacall as well as teens seeking a peak of Jenny 
McCarthy (who keeps her clothes on- well, sort of anyway) should find 
this movie to be a true treat.</P>
<P>Harry (Kirk Douglas), Lance (Dan Akroyd) and Michael (Corbin Allred) 
represent three generations of the same family. Harry, once a boxer 
known as the Polish Prince, fondly remembers his days as the 
welterweight champion of the world. He hasn't had sex in 8 years. Lance 
is somewhere in his midlife crisis as he fights for his son's attention 
and respect despite a recent divorce. He hasn't had sex since his wife 
and he split up. Michael is battling high school and coping with the 
aforementioned divorce. He has only been to second base once.</P>
<P>The three generations set out on a road trip to Reno, Nevada in search 
of precious diamonds that lend the film its title. With Reno comes one 
of the most enjoyable casino scenes since Dustin Hoffman counted cards 
in Rain Man (Lance cheats at poker in a most amusing fashion), an 
unforgettable trip to a bordello that occupies nearly 1/3 of the film 
and mended relationships among the three once angry relatives.</P>
<P>Kirk Douglas plays a stroke victim who insists that his condition is 
merely "G-d's way of trying to make me shut up." Douglas is truly 
inspiring and it would not be unjust for him to receive a best actor 
nomination accordingly. Dan Akroyd reprises his 
confused-but-well-meaning-father role previously seen in both My Girl 
movies. In doing so, he shows that, despite enormous name recognition, 
he is one of Hollywood's most underused assets. The biggest surprise 
comes from a rather small role tackled by former Playmate Jenny McCarthy 
as, surprisingly enough, a call-girl. She shows the expected sexual 
character that her role calls for as well as a very sweet, 
girl-next-door persona that give her scenes an added oomph and her 
character more depth than any whore since Julia Roberts' lead role in 
Pretty Woman. Lauren Bacall rounds out the grade-A cast playing a madam.</P>
<P>Harry, the former boxer, was never a heavyweight. Rather, he was a 
welterweight at the top of his division. Similarly, Diamonds isn't a 
heavyweight film. There are no massive effects or even $20 million 
stars. But don't be mistaken, the film is at the top of its league and 
can still deliver a knock-out punch.</P>
