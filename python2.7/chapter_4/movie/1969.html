<PRE>                             LAST ACTION HERO
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>     Something was wrong with the picture. </PRE>
<P>     On one of the muggiest days of the year, on the opening weekend of
one of the summer's most eagerly awaited movies, the theater was eerily
empty.  By the time the lights went down, there couldn't have been more
than a dozen people in the auditorium.</P>
<P>     Why was the movie-going public staying away in droves?  Could the
word-of-mouth on LAST ACTION HERO have been that bad?  Two excruciating
hours later the answer was obvious.</P>
<PRE>     It could. </PRE>
<P>     LAST ACTION HERO, this summer's big ticket attraction starring
that pumped-up action star Arnold Schwarzenegger, makes HUDSON HAWK
look like a Bergman classic.  It's a stupefying mess of a movie as big
as the cigar-chewing Schwarzenegger himself.  All the thought, wit and
skill that went into the exhilarating trailer are missing from the
finished product--a parody of action pictures that is neither funny nor
exciting.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the film has potential written all over it, and its premise
is actually quite good. Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is addicted to
Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) movies.  At a private midnight screening
of JACK SLATER IV, Danny is transported into the film by the power of a
magical ticket.  Here the young cineast grapples with the reality of
living in a fiction, helplessly trying to convince the celluloid Slater
that his charmed existence is all just make-believe.</P>
<P>     Not a bad idea, and certainly one that provides a great
opportunity to lampoon movie-making conventions.  But the treatment is
so poorly handled that self-parody quickly deteriorates into
self-consciousness.  There are some laughs in a video store where Danny
tries to prove to Slater that this is only a movie--everybody's phone
number begins with 555, for example--but for the most part the humor is
labored and uninspired.  Even jokes that should have been funny lose
their impact due to poor timing and delivery.</P>
<P>     The biggest jokes in LAST ACTION HERO are the bad guys.  Charles
Dance plays Benedict, a deranged sharpshooter with a traveling case of
glass eyes.  His performance is embarrassingly over-the-top; witness
the scene in New York when he guns down an auto mechanic just to get
attention.  There's one funny sight gag involving him and his pack of
drooling rottweilers, but as the heavy, he's about as menacing as a box
of cereal.</P>
<P>     Many memorable showdowns are suggested, such as Benedict's threat
to unleash moviedom's powers of darkness (Dracula, Freddy Krueger, et
al), but these never materialize.</P>
<P>     Anthony Quinn appears as a "spaghetti-slurping cretin" called
Vivaldi whose manglings of the English language are played for big yuks
(he says things like "fourth wheel" instead of fifth wheel, or "in
front of the 8-ball" instead of behind it).  The audience isn't likely
to giggle at his sophomoric linguistic butchery to begin with, and
Benedict's endless explications guarantee it.</P>
<P>     These villains aren't odious, they're tedious. </P>
<P>     It's hard to believe that a solid action director like John
McTiernan (who made the exceptional DIE HARD and THE HUNT FOR RED
OCTOBER) could be responsible for this turkey. The editing is choppy,
the effects are surprisingly fake, the stuntwork isn't particularly
spectacular, the music is horrendous, and the writing is mind-numbingly
poor ("If God were a villain, he'd be me" smirks Benedict to the
camera).  Some scenes are completely gratuitous--such as the one in
which Danny's apartment is burglarized--and others flounder desperately
for intent.  LAST ACTION HERO is so sloppily put together you'd swear
it didn't even *have* a director.</P>
<P>     You can tell the movie's in trouble from the very first scene,
which is distinctly lacking in firepower.  Hundreds of squad cars
surround a building atop which a facially-disfigured maniac holds a
bunch of kids hostage.  Enter Jack Slater, from the snake boots up.
Big cigar.  Big frown.  Big problem.  Macho mockery at its cheesiest.
"Focus!" yells Danny, as an image of Slater pumping "The Slasher" full
of lead blurs beyond recognition.  Perhaps he was referring to the
direction.</P>
<P>     In a summer that has already seen disappointing returns on some
potential box office hits, you might be tempted to check out LAST
ACTION HERO.  Big mistake.  There's not even a guarantee that kids will
enjoy it--the two ten-year-olds down front were bored out of their
skulls.  LAST ACTION HERO is a poorly executed in-joke where everyone
in the audience-- Schwarzenegger fans included--feels left out.</P>
