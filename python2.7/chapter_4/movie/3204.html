<P>     Those who prefer more than a token of historical fact in their
biopics may be less-than-enamoured with IMMORTAL BELOVED, an erratic
look at the life of Ludwig van Beethoven (played by Gary Oldman).
Writer-director Bernard Rose is obviously more concerned with telling
his version of the tale than in remaining anchored in reality.
Nevertheless, as the old saying goes, "Don't let the facts stand in the
way of a good story."</P>
<P>     The question is: Is IMMORTAL BELOVED solid drama?  Ignoring a
silly and melodramatic conclusion, the probable answer is "yes." While
never approaching the power of AMADEUS, IMMORTAL BELOVED isn't a bad
portrait of a temperamental genius and the three women who are the most
likely candidates to be his secret, lost love ("I can only live
completely with you or not at all..." Beethoven wrote).</P>
<P>     The title refers to the addressee of a letter unearthed when the
composer died in 1827.  No one then, or now, knows who the "Immortal
Beloved" is, but Bernard Rose decided it might be fun to take a guess
or two.  To that end, he has framed his film as a detective story with
Beethoven confidante Anton Schindler (played by Jeroen Krabbe) trekking
across Europe searching for clues.  Along the way, he meets three
women--Johanna Reiss (Johanna Ter Steege), Anna Marie Erdody (Isabella
Rossellini), and Giulietta Guicciardi (Valeria Golino)--all of whom
loved Ludwig, and one of whom is almost certainly the "Immortal
Beloved." Most of the movie takes place in flashbacks--and flashbacks
within flashbacks--as parcels of Beethoven's life are unwrapped for the
cameras.</P>
<P>     The movie is least satisfactory in the investigative sequences,
combining a rather lackluster performance by Krabbe with an implausible
scenario.  On the other hand, perhaps it's the absence of Gary Oldman's
flamboyant Beethoven that makes these sections of IMMORTAL BELOVED so
flat.  Often, especially when the story slows, it's the lead actor's
performance that keeps this film from devolving into a turgid mess.</P>
<P>     Aside from Oldman, the other really impressive element of IMMORTAL
BELOVED is, as might be expected, the soundtrack.  Taking the
composer's best-known pieces and stringing them together makes for a
heady experience, especially when director Rose marries the music with
sufficiently impressive visual images (the use of the Ninth Symphony's
"Ode to Joy" is a memorable moment of cinematic poetry).</P>
<P>     Ultimately, however, the film's biggest failing is its
characterization of Beethoven.  Not only is he shown to be a selfish,
crabby, arrogant womanizer (which is probably accurate), but we're
rarely given more than a surface look into his personality.  Because
we're forced to watch him from an emotional distance, it's difficult to
generate much sympathy.  By extension, the identity of Beethoven's
"Immortal Beloved" is less a great mystery than a minor curiosity.</P>
<P>     There are times when the script is unworthy of the subject matter,
and occasions when Oldman's co-stars (especially Marco Hofschneider,
who plays Beethoven's nephew Karl) seem ill-suited to their roles.
Nevertheless, negatives aside, the plot holds the viewer's interest,
even if it doesn't touch the heart.  IMMORTAL BELOVED is the sort of
flawed movie that still has enough assets to allow it to be enjoyed.</P>
