<PRE>
 Mighty Joe Young (1998) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Bill Paxton and
Charlize Theron</PRE>
<P> Mighty Joe Young is not a good movie. It's an OK outing, that can't decide
whether it wants to be a cutsy kid's movie or a special effects outing for
adults.</P>
<P> Therefore, it has a schizophrenic feel and fails to accomplish either mission.</P>
<P> This updated remake of the 1949 adventure suffers in comparison.</P>
<P> The original, with special effects by the legendary Willis O'Brien, always
has placed a distant second to O' Brien's other famous creation, King Kong.
Mighty Joe Young can be considered Kong's distant, gentle cousin.</P>
<P> Like the original, this contemporary version begins in Africa. But times
have changed. So instead of a farmer-hunter, we have a Dian Fossey-like
anthropologist studying gorillas. When poachers attack the gorilla tribe
she is observing, she is killed as is the mother of Joe, a baby gorilla
befriended by the anthropologist's little daughter, Jill.</P>
<P> Joe and Jill become inseparable, growing up in the deep jungle, where Jill
has taken her mother's place.</P>
<P> Joe has grown to enormous height and weighs a ton, literally.</P>
<P> Jill and Joe are lured to America by Bill Paxton's Greg O'Hara, who offers
the pair safety from the poachers out to capture or kill Joe.</P>
<P> In Los Angeles, Joe becomes the star attraction at a nature preserve, but
things go awry and Joe is hunted as a menace.</P>
<P> You know the rest. Joe becomes a hero, the bad guys are thwarted.</P>
<P> It's all juvenile fun, by-the-numbers, you-fill-in-the-blanks filmmaking.
The actors, who also include very lovely Charlize Theron as Jill) give
adequate perfomances.</P>
<P> Yet one must realize that the actors spent a lot of time emoting to thin
air, imagining where Joe would be a screen. It's not easy to perform like
that, so Theron and Paxton must be given some due for pulling it off.</P>
<P> But it is Rick Baker's special effects who are the film's real stars. Joe
is a big ham, though not as corny nor as menacing as in the original.</P>
<P> This big gorilla is really a teddy bear.</P>
<P> Mighty Joe Young is predictable and factory-made filmmaking. It's an OK
way to while a way a couple of hours over the Christmas break.</P>
