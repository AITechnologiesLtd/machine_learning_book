<PRE>                                    FACE/OFF
                       A film review by Neal Richardson
                        Copyright 1997 Neal Richardson</PRE>
<P>Principal Actors: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage
Written by: Michael Colleary and Mike Werb
Directed by: John Woo</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of 4 stars</PRE>
<P>Imagine what it might be like to wear the face of the person you hate the
most.  What would that do to you? </P>
<P>This is the dilemma at the heart of John Woo's latest action thriller,
"Face/Off."  The premise the screenwriters use to make us believe that the
two leads "swap" faces is ludicrous but when this occurs we aren't really
concerned with suspending our disbe lief.  This movie has already sucked
us in. </P>
<P>What makes this movie work is the intensity that Travolta and Cage bring
to their roles as they play themselves and then switch roles a quarter of
the way through the film.  The scenes become more poignant as the audience
knows who's really who and everyo ne else does not.  A very interesting
human drama unfolds as the best in these characters is brought out due to
the role reversal. </P>
<P>If none of this grabs you as you watch this in a multiplex, John Woo's
direction and outrageous stunts will.  This is without a doubt his most
Hong Kong like of his American films.  Those who are familiar with Woo's
style will undoubtedly smile knowingly at some of these shots throughout
this picture. </P>
<P>This is an action movie with a lot of heart.  You'll be hard pressed to
find a better action film this summer. </P>
