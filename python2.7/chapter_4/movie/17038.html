<PRE>A Girl from Hunan</PRE>
<PRE>[4.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Time passes slowly in the rural countryside, so customs and traditions are
often slow to change in the absence of outside influences. Xiao Xiao is a
young girl just entering adolesense. Following custom, she has her marriage
arranged to Chun Guan, who is a child of about five years of age. The story
begins as Xiao arrives at the rustic family farm of Guan's family. Although
they are actually man and wife, their relationship at this stage more
resembles younger brother and older sister, in fact he addresses her as
"Sister". Guan's time is mostly spent in play and Xiao Xiao's time is mostly
spent in numerous farm chores. It actually quite a pleasant, contented life.
However, Xiao Xiao's friendship with one of the farmhands eventually
develops into a romantic relationship. This not something that she is know
would happen, because in her youth and naivete she cannot know the
consequences of her actions. She see first hand that the penalty for
adultery is severe by traditional law, but only when it is too late does she
realize the trap she has entered.</P>
<P>When people from one culture observe the customs and practices of another,
there invariably will be some that are shocking. There may be the perception
that the story is an illustration of the injustices of a particular culture,
but this is not the case. It merely provides the context in which customs
and practices exist in an equilibrium state. Certainly some of the events
are barbaric through Western eyes, but that is because of the context in
which they are viewed. It is not a depiction of a system that is perfect, in
fact there are undeniable injustices, but it is a system that serves to
order and balance the lives of its people.</P>
<P>This is a film that very ambitious and highly successful. It was apparently
not intended for the Western audience judging by the long period with no
distribution. To tell a story of one culture to another is very difficult
considering the lack of background that the audience will have. The story is
brilliantly written and flawlessly acted. The writing and cinematography are
so well done that viewing the film feels like living in a Chinese village.</P>
<P>Highly Recommended. Those familiar with Eastern cultures will reallly
appreciate the honest depiction of rural country life. The dialog is Chinese
with subtitles.</P>
