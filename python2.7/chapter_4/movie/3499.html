<PRE>                               KISS OF DEATH
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Ever get the feeling that no matter what you do, you're screwed? 
That basically sums up the life of Jimmy Kilmartin (David Caruso), an
ex-con trying to go straight in the new feature, KISS OF DEATH.</P>
<P>     Jimmy, his wife Bev (Helen Hunt), and their daughter live an
inner-city dream, trying to make ends meet.  When Jimmy's cousin Ronnie
(ZEBRAHEAD's Michael Rapaport) shows up, begging for a driver for his chop
shop caravan, all hell breaks loose.  Jimmy is busted, and his descent
back into the pit of crime, prison, betrayal, and the government begins. 
Soon, Jimmy and his family are hounded by cop Calvin (Samuel L. Jackson),
asthmatic psycho kingpin Little Junior (Nicholas Cage), and a host of
other unsavory players.  We are invited to watch and see how Jimmy
extricates himself from the mess.</P>
<P>     As you may well expect, KISS OF DEATH is loaded with violence.  I
didn't expect it to be so funny, though.  It's worth the price of
admission just for a certain hilarious twist in Little Junior's strip
joint.  Cage's Junior gets all the best lines, but Caruso owns the picture
with his dynamic and striking portrayal of a man with a past and little
hope for a future.</P>
<P>     On the minus side, director Barbet Schroeder flubbed the first
half-hour of the picture, which deals with the dull tale of Jimmy vs.
Ronnie, before the guts of the action, Jimmy vs. Junior, begins.  Hunt's
talent is wasted as Jimmy's estranged wife, and it appears that a big
chunk of her screen time was left on the cutting room floor.  PULP
FICTION's Ving Rhames also has a few great lines as another deviant
could-be criminal but is otherwise squandered.</P>
<P>     Despite all that, once you cross that half-hour hurdle, KISS OF DEATH
becomes a powerful thriller not quite like anything I've seen recently. 
Nothing too original or flashy, just a gritty story that rings completely
true.</P>
