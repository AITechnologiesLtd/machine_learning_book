<P>Ingredients: 
Man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder, dark science fiction
city controlled by alien beings with mental powers. </P>
<P>Synopsis: 
What if you woke up one day, and suspected you were not on Earth, and
instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium
manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers? In DARK CITY John Murdoch
(Rufus Sewell) has this problem. </P>
<P>DARK CITY starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery. Poor
John wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one
corner. A mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there,
and soon enough John is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale
people in black trench-coats, as well as by the police, and the dogged
Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt). Is John a murderer, and what can his
missing memories tell him? He searches through his own wallet for
possible contacts and clues. But when the clues don't fit, it doesn't
just confuse him; it causes John to go so far as to question the whole
nature of reality in the Dark City.</P>
<P>To John, something is fishy, and very unreal about this city. How come
it's always dark, and nobody seems to remember what they did this
morning? And how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city, or
how to get to nearby Shell Beach? Every night, around midnight, John
notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation, and
at this time, creepy alien experimenters known as the 'Strangers' come
out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads
with big hypodermic needles. The Strangers have the ability to 'tune,'
or warp reality using telepathic powers.</P>
<P>Turns out, the city is not on Earth at all. And the reason why John
doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation, is because he is
a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping
abilities as the Strangers. Even with the help of scientist Dr. Daniel
Schreber, can John take back the DARK CITY?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Director Alex Proyas (he also directed THE CROW) mentions this in the
DARK CITY press kit: In films, science fiction is always "used to have
big spaceships blow up cities. I think we're a little tired of that."
According to director Proyas, probably the most interesting thing about
DARK CITY is its layers. It's designed so that you can watch the film
over again, and examine it from the perspective of a main character
other than Murdoch. It's a philosophical piece.</P>
<P>Cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout
between the good humans and the bad aliens (whether they be Klingons,
giant bugs, or proponents of the dark side of the Force). But science
fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the
big questions, questions like who are we? What is the human condition?
What is ethical? What would a true human being do?</P>
<P>Far from comic book style on the order of SPAWN, BATMAN, or THE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES, DARK CITY not only features the showdown between good
humans and powerful aliens, but it also asks questions worthy of films
such as BRAZIL or BLADE RUNNER.</P>
<P>DARK CITY is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay.
A little more than 200 years ago, the world was filled with unhappy
peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was
controlled by totalitarian, military, conformist, medieval regimes. The
people took refuge in religion, the idea being that earthly life was a
time of suffering, but after death, Heaven would be available.
Meanwhile, the State used these same ideas to prop up their regimes; the
King was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by Heaven.
When science finally overturned religion, the medieval dictatorships
came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments. But the
new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used
to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old. This is the
time period when writers and philosophers such as Freud, Kant, Kafka,
Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky pondered what society should be, and what
place the individual had in it. The existentialists' in particular wrote
about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile,
indifferent, or alienated universe.</P>
<P>In DARK CITY, when the last dying, defeated alien asks John Murdoch why
the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed,
Murdoch replies, pointing to his head, "Because the human condition
isn't located in here." </P>
