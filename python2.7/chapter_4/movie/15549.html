FORREST GUMP
A film by Robert Zemeckis
Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and 
Sally Field</PRE>
<P>    Midway through FORREST GUMP, I realized how much I loved watching 
Tom Hanks act.  This, for all the dazzling array of special effects 
(that are starting to look dated every time I watch this), is a movie 
driven by the wondrous Hanks, who gives perhaps the most indelible 
American performance in the last 20 years.  I honestly don't know if 
there is a better actor alive than Tom Hanks.  Hanks is destined to be 
mocked more than Marlon Brando's creation of Vito Corleone for THE 
GODFATHER, because his performance is so good.  It is impossible to say 
what it feels like to watch Tom Hanks on screen, using every bit of his 
immense talent to bring a character to life, to catch the sympathy of 
the audience with just one line, one mannerism, one something, to make 
us feel.  As Andrew Beckett in PHILADELPHIA, Jim Lovell in APOLLO 13, 
and Capt. Miller in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Hanks was able to do the exact 
same thing: give commanding performances that dominate the movie.</P>
<P>That said, the movie is a winner by all standards.  The plot is 
relatively simple: an Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks), who has an 
IQ of 75 (below normal), goes through life, somehow meeting great 
people, and acheiving great things.  The movie is dominated by his love 
for Jenny (Wright), who takes a different turn than he does, but winds 
up in the same place.  Along the way, he meets lifelong friends that he 
manages to turn around.</P>
<P>FORREST GUMP was able to acheive all of its magic through great 
effects, although they are starting to wear thin.  What doesn't wear 
thin are the simply marvelous performances.  Gary Sinise, in one of the 
most beautifully constructed supporting roles in history, gives an 
astounding, career-making performance as Lt. Dan, one of Forrest's 
closest friends.  Sinise probably has the most difficult role in the 
film, but manages to make it his own through a powerful performance 
which contains the frustrations of every veteran on the face of the 
Earth.  Robin Wright, whose role is also more difficult than Hanks', is 
also great as Jenny, the girl of Forrest's dreams.  Her performance is 
that of lost innocence, of someone who missed the boat early on, and 
never got back on track until late.  Sally Field also shows up for a 
fine turn as Forrest's mother. </P>
<P>The one immense strength of FORREST GUMP is its inflappable star.  I 
don't understand how Tom Hanks is so good: he just is.  Hanks' role is 
not the most difficult.  However, it is a lot harder than it looks.  
Hanks adds so much more to the character than isn't there.  The 
mannerisms, the certain tendencies, and the flawless portrayal of a man 
who is so simple than he could be mistaken for dumb.  Hanks turns a role 
that isn't so difficult, and does the absolute best he can with it, 
turning it into an indelible performance worth seeing time and again.  
There is no reason why I wouldn't see Tom Hanks act.</P>
<P>FORREST GUMP does fall when it comes to its message.  There are 
moments of absolute hilarity and purely bad filmmaking, at times (when 
Forrest learns how to run...eegh').  The film also has a tendency to 
really make fun of the stupid, which is a shame.  More enigmatic is the 
film's political message.  A film about so many events must have a 
message.  If there is one, its that goodness will prevail, but much of 
the film is awfully contrived, like the ridiculous 'running around 
the country' episode.   The film is not for radicalism, but neither 
for the 50's ideals.  It wants to fall in the middle, but it can't.</P>
<P>As a piece of entertainment, however, FORREST GUMP is unbeatable.  A 
mulitple Oscar-winner, it is arguable whether or not is should have 
beaten PULP FICTION, but no one can deny its emotional thump, especially 
towards the end.  A tour-de-force not for director Zemeckis, who made a 
great but not superb film, but for Hanks, who delivers the decade's most 
unforgettable performance.  Everything in this movie emanates from Tom 
Hanks, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Hanks' performance and 
character are so much a part of American film, that FORREST GUMP works 
better as a cultural phenomenon than as a movie.  No matter.  It's still 
a great film, and an opportunity to see this generation's Jimmy Stewart 
in fine form.  One of the essential Tom Hanks movies, and that says a 
lot.</P>
