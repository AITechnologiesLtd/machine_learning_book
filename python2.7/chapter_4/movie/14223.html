<P>   One of the reasons that critics and general audiences do
not often agree is that professional reviewers do not generally
like highly sentimental movies.  Stories that might give a
susceptible person a diabetic attack are too often the stuff of
daytime TV soaps, sketchy dramas designed purely to evoke
tears of pathos and cries of joy from their viewers.  The
problems of mushy productions are customarily unoriginal, the
conclusions predictable.</P>
<P>   Though "Firelight" may be guilty of swirling with Victorian
suds, its story is a far cry from General Hospital. "Firelight"
features exceptionally fine acting from Stephen Dillane and
Sophie Marceau as the story's lovers, two people whose
chemistry is so robust that you can feel them bursting within
as they struggle to maintain a properly British restraint.  As
Elisabeth (Sophie Marceau), a Swiss woman who eventually
becomes a governess to the prosperous English landowner
Charles (Stephen Dillane), she must at first appear to be
immune to his charm just as Charles must seem wholly
businesslike in her magnetic presence. As their outer shell
gradually cracks, their passions burst forth.  We breathe a
sigh of relief when their mutual affinity is fulfilled.  Despite a
predictable ending that leaves all loose ends happily secured,
the picture casts a spell over its audience with director William
Nicholson's gauzy lensing and his repeated, opportune use of
the titled firelight.  As Nicholson writes in his screenplay for
the film, "In the firelight you do what you want, say what you
want, be what you want. When the lamps are lit again, time
starts again, and everything you said or did is forgotten.  More
than forgotten, it never happened."</P>
<P>   This quote sums up the central theme of the narrative.  The
action is motivated by a strictly business arrangement made
between Charles and Elisabeth, one with contemporary
resonance, as Charles needs a woman to bear an heir to his
estate.  The surrogate mother must not know his name or
habitation in this anonymous transaction.  Whatever goes
down, so to speak, must be absolutely forgotten.  For the sum
of 500 pounds--a princely amount in the England of the
1830's--Elisabeth is to submit to Charles's sexual advances
for just three nights.  She is to present him with her child nine
months later and for that she will receive money she needs to
pay her father's debts in Switzerland.  Held apart by the
conventions of the time (Charles may not marry her since his
own wife is in a coma but yet alive), they are freed "in the
magic of the firelight."</P>
<P>   William Nicholson, who both scripted and helms the lush
bodice-ripper, is known for his creation of "Shadowlands" and
has a background with BBC for restrained dramas.  We thus
expect a picture much like the elegant and witty "Mrs. Brown,"
a movie with romantic overtones to match its intelligence. 
That is what we get.  The initial scene is the most effective
one.  Charles and Elisabeth meet for the first time to work out
the details of the contract and act thoroughly businesslike
during their initial coupling.  The very next evening, Elisabeth
has shed the last article of protective clothing and has begun
to enjoy her new, albeit temporary, job.  By the third night the
sparks are flying.  Yet throughout, Charles and Elisabeth
seem in denial, refusing to admit their mutual infatuation.</P>
<P>   The supporting roles are splendid, particularly those of Joss
Ackland as Charles's father, Lord Clare, whose profligate
spending throws the estate into a Chekhovian bankruptcy;
and little Dominique Belcourt as Louisa, the hell-raising heir to
the estate who does not suspect that the woman who is
serving as her governess and teacher is her own dear
mother.  Kevin Anderson is on screen for a disappointingly
shor time in a role too small fo his talents--as the American
sheep farmer who is negotiating a business deal with Charles
and who, after his proposal of marriage to Elisabeth is turned
down, replies with the most un-1830's comment, "It doesn't
hurt to ask."  </P>
<P>   The lovely and ultra-refined Sophie Marceau is a true find
in her first English role, one which could be a major
breakthrough for her career.  Christopher Gunning's score
may be saccharine but is absolutely effective in pumping up
the electric atmosphere of this carefully-paced tale, which
involves such contemporary concerns as class
consciousness, euthanasia, surrogate motherhood, and even
the proper upbringing of children.</P>
