<P>Sleepy Hollow: lost in the age of reason</P>
<P>Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has traditionally been
classed with children's lit., and is subsequently invoked every Halloween
along with Charlie Brown specials etc. Which is to say the figure of the
headless horsemen has--via steady bombardment (see: product placement)--lost
much of its scare power, become tame enough for the kids. That's all past
tense, now, with Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, which (re)injects fear back
into Irving's story much as Michael Cohn returned the macabre to Snow White
(1997). Of course, too, we all know that the old fairytales were pretty
harsh to start with--the oral equivalent of a warning sign, the
grammar-school equivalent of 'scared straight' programs--but all those
fairytales are imported, have their roots in Europe and Central Europe. The
Legend of Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is American, which is to say
still new. Who'd have thought there was anything Grimm going on between the
lines? But there is, or there can be. 1799 does belong to the same decade as
the Salem Witch Trials, after all (see Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" for
a Pre-Burton, Burton tone).</P>
<P>And we all know the story: a bungling Ichabod Crane stumbles into Sleepy
Hollow, into the mystery of a 'headless' horsemen with a vorpal blade. It's
Scooby Doo stuff, yes, all reliant upon levels of curiosity never really
accounted for in character. So, Burton and screenwriter Kevin Yagher simply
changed that, made Ichabod not a schoolteacher, but something like the first
forensic pathologist (~Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson). Altering the job title
isn't quite enough, however, so they take it one step further, and have
'Constable' Crane's superiors charge him with figuring out these
decapitations. It's more than just a droll homicide case for Ichabod,
though. Sleepy Hollow is his one, good chance to prove his "trappings of
scientific investigation"--a host of DaVinci-clever autopsy devices. The bad
thing is, his one good chance turns out to be impenetrable to reason. It's
hard to measure the supernatural.</P>
<P>There are a few carryovers from the old version, though, too: Ichabod is
still slightly bungling, in the sense that he's prone to feint when
dramatically necessary. And, when he can stay conscious, he tends to use
children as shields. When he's unconscious, though, we get to see his inner
life to a certain extent--what personal demons are driving him to privilege
science over the supernatural. So perhaps his feinting is simply economical,
an easy way into his head. Another carryover is Ichabod's romantic
involvement with Katrina (Christina Ricci), which develops nicely, under the
watchful eye of both her current suitor (Caspar Van Diem) and her current
mother (Miranda Richardson).</P>
<P>And then of course there's the headless horsemen, Hessian mercenary
Christopher Walken at his evil best, made to fit for Burton's colonial
America, where the dead are restless and the cleavage rampant. He does keep
it all reined in, though--never gets quite lost enough in the period that he
thinks he owns the story, can change its fundamentals (1995's Scarlet
Letter). Well, he almost doesn't get that lost. The one time he does, when
ascribing motives to who turns out to be the 'real' bad guy here, he sets
things up such that the bad guy is simply serving some justice on Sleepy
Hollow, albeit it with interest. Which typically allows only two endings:
either the town accepts responsibility for starting the whole mess or the
bad guy kills them all. Sleepy Hollow takes neither path here, but instead
seems to ignore the whole issue, which leaves an important narrative
development conspicuously undeveloped. In it's defense, though, it does give
Washington Irving's tale back to the adults, who themselves may not be quite
old enough for the graphic nature of some of the decapitations.</P>
