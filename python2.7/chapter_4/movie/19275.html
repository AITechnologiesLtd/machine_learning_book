<P>The trouble with remakes is that unless you have not seen their forefathers,
you will think you are witnessing cinematic artistry at its lowest. I cannot
advise someone retouching a classic, understated horror classic like "The
Mummy" (1932) which starred the incomparable Boris Karloff, or one of its best
remakes with Christopher Lee in 1959. This overheated, 90's version of the
Mummy attempts to throw everything into the mix including the kitchen sink. As
a result, it sacrifices its original storyline entirely, and what we have is a
Mummy for the Indiana Jones mindset - one of the film's many unforgiving
faults. </P>
<P>The film begins promisingly with the Egyptian prince, ImHoTep, punished for
having an adulterous affair with the pharaoh's daughter. His tongue is cut, and
he is consequently buried in bandages in a tomb full of scrappy, ugly scarabs
(beetle-like bugs). We flash forward thousands of years later where ImHoTep's
tomb is uncovered by a team of explorers seeking the Book of the Dead (If I
recall correctly, there is more than one version in the catacombs!). One of the
explorers is an ambitious Egyptologist (Rachel Weiz), who has trouble
preventing bookcases from toppling at the Museum of Antiquities!</P>
<P>Once the Book of Dead is discovered and the forbidden sayings are uttered, all
hell breaks loose as ImHoTep rises from the dead and slowly regenerates his
human form. His objective is to bring back his beloved from the dead after
commanding all the thunderstorms and sandstorms in his wrath - all in the name
of love. </P>
<P>"The Mummy" tries to be a fusion of Indiana Jones and horror cliches, and
attempts to tell a tragic love story as well. None work or blend easily. For
one, casting Brendan Fraser as a bland, stock Indiana Jones hero who's barely
shocked or scared by the Mummy is not wise - he does not have the integrity or
fierceness of Harrison Ford. Rachel Weiz is too cute and shrilly as the female
lead - she is more appropriate for a screwball comedy than a film of this type.</P>
<P>Arnold Vosoloo is the mean Egyptian mummy but his cold smile and angry eyes
are overshadowed by the whirlwind special-effects - this mummy does not even
wear bandages! He just evaporates and blows like a twister from one place to
another. Where is the sense of menace and succinct body language of Boris
Karloff? Whatever sense of loss emanated from ImHoTep's love affair is trampled
by an exceeding number of special-effects and histrionic action sequences. But
wait a doggone minute: Is this a horror film or an action picture?</P>
<P>"The Mummy" is a mindless blockbuster...but there are no delicious quips, no
sense of adventure, and no peril. Some of it may be considered serviceable fun
for young minds and there are some spellbinding sequences (the face-like
formations on the sand are fabulous). But it's a joyless enterprise - more of a
promo for extraordinary digital special-effects like "The Matrix" than a movie.
All you'll receive from this parched Mummy is a headache.</P>
