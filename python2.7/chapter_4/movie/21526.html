<PRE>ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>3 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Cecilia Roth, Antonia San Juan, Penélope Cruz, Marisa
Paredes, Candela Pena;
Written & Directed by Pedro Almodóvar;
Cinematography by Affonso Beato</P>
<P>        In the opening scenes of Pedro Almodóvar's ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,
Esteban is preparing to write a story about his mother, Manuela (Cecilia
Roth); we are shown excerpts from Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ALL ABOUT EVE;
mother and son attend a performance of Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar
Named Desire" on Esteban's seventeenth birthday.  These are all
refererences to stories about women, written by men.  And then Esteban is
run over by a car.  His story about his mother remains incomplete.</P>
<P>        The rest of the movie belongs to women: other than Esteban, the
only male characters of any significance are a senile father who no longer
recognizes his own daughter and a stagehand obsessed with sex.  There are
also two transsexuals who have opted to become women.  The suggestion is
that the death of Manuela's son represents the termination of the masculine
viewpoint: instead of men's stories about women, we will be given access to
a film about women, seen from the vantage of women.  It's a rather
disingenuous suggestion on the part of Almodóvar (LIVE FLESH), who is of
course a man--and the author of the movie--but what follows represents an
admirable attempt to represent the complexities of women.</P>
<P>        A bare bones outline of the plot might suggest the flamboyant
nature of the director's earlier work.  Woman's son dies in freak accident.
Woman abandons her job and heads to Madrid.  Woman meets a transsexual
friend (Antonia San Juan), befriends a pregnant nun (Penélope Cruz),
becomes assistant to an aging actress (Marisa Paredes) and has to deal with
her young, sullen, self-destructive, heroin-addicted mistress (Candela
Pena).  But Almodóvar treats the material as straight melodrama, more or
less, not as farce.</P>
<P>        The movie has a sense of humour and is sometimes provocative, but
the tone is rather sombre.  The emotions it reaches for are undistorted by
irony.  We are asked to accept these women just as they are given to
us--prone to extravagent emotional outbursts, their lives governed by
far-fetched coincidences.  In this respect, ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER resembles
soap opera, which likewise expects to be taken at face value (and whose
audience is primarily female).  Soap opera itself is a form which descends
from the sentimental fiction of the 18th century, when novelists like
Samuel Richardson wrote mammoth serialized novels--about women, for women.</P>
<P>        All of which is to say that ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER makes use of
fictional forms that are traditionally associated with women, and has fun
with them.  It's a fascinating film in terms of its manipulation of ideas
about gender, but as a viewing experience it is perhaps too languorous and
comfortable.  The urgency and effrontery of Almodóvar's earlier work is
missing.  Despite the playful approach to gender roles, the movie relies on
the clichés of sentimental fiction to the point where it at times seems no
more than a humdrum melodramatic tearjerker.  There is an instance of the
tired routine in which a woman throws up for no apparent reason--and, of
course, it later turns out that she's pregnant.  Almodóvar makes use of
this cliché without ironizing it or putting it to the service of the film,
and so it remains no more than a cliché, a shortcoming.</P>
<P>        The women in ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER represent most of the customary
female roles and stereotypes: mother, daughter, nurse, actress, lesbian,
prostitute, nun.  What is most complex and rewarding about the movie is the
manner in which the various women slip from one category to another,
inhabiting numerous roles, wearing them like an endless succession of
masks.  We learn, for example, that a young nun (Penelope Cruz) is
pregnant, and that she was impregnated by an older transsexual; our
preconceptions become worthless.  At the end, we are told that one of the
lesbian characters has married a man and had a child.  Manuela herself, the
emotional centre of the movie, is mother, friend, confidante, nurturer, and
much more besides.  She can be vulnerable, tough, bitchy, playful: she
cannot be pinned down.  By fostering slippages and tensions, by undermining
conventions and expectations, the movie allows the intricacies of
personalities which resist stereotyping to emerge.</P>
<P>        The notion that women's social roles represent a series of
performances is fundamental: two characters are actresses, Manuela performs
in a play one night, and Manuela's transsexual friend gives a theatrical
monologue about herself which verbally duplicates the construction of
female identity she has undertaken through surgery, make-up, implants,
hormonal treatments, etc.  He has become she: the result of her own
constructs and not those of society or biology.  Almodóvar's underlying
message seems to be that a woman is what she makes herself out to be,
irrespective of what others would impose on her.  One female stereotype is
notable for its absence: woman as victim.</P>
