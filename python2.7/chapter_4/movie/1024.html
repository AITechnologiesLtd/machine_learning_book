<PRE>                                HUDSON HAWK
                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1991 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     I went to see HUDSON HAWK tonight in a generally good mood and with
what I thought were reasonably low expectations.  Instead of an escapist
romp a la DIE HARD, I got a confused, needlessly bloody, overblown
episode of THE PINK PANTHER MEETS THE THREE STOOGES.  At several points
during the movie I felt genuine embarrassment for the cast: not a good
sign.  I guess seeing names like Bruce Willis, Danny Aielo and Andie
MacDowell got my hopes up too far.</P>
<P>     The director competes with the script for title of Least Aware of
Where We're Going.  On one level, the film wants to be a witty,
hard-edged caper film about a cat burglar forced out of retirement by
agents of the government, the mob and what was supposed to pass for some
kind of goofy corporation.  But the foul language and blood clash badly
with the tongue-in-cheek, cartoony level of reality it tries to set up.</P>
<P>     The overall impression is of a movie made by some marketing droid
using a color by numbers set.  Some of the individual characters in
individual scenes are, or are potentially, funny.  And the first half of
the movie almost sets up an air of mystery capable of maintaining our
attention.  But as soon as you find out who Everybody is, it runs down
hill -- and it started on just a little knoll.  We wind up with a
mish-mash of cloying dialogue, weak repartee and broadly-drawn
characters.  The film film wanders aimlessly through a world where the
Pope watches "Mr. Ed" in dubbed Italian, and a decapitation is just a
setup for a one-liner, and one that feels forced at that.</P>
<P>     The whole movie feels forced, and events are driven entirely at the
convenience of the plot rather than by any sense of an internal logic.
If you're really curious about it, or a die hard Bruce Willis fan, wait
for video.  It'll be a short wait, I promise.</P>
