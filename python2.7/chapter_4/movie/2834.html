<PRE>                           A PLACE IN THE WORLD
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This film was disqualified for nomination for a 1993 Best Foreign
Film because it was a joint Uruguay/Argentine production.  In any case
it was not the best of those that were nominated.</P>
<P>     Ernesto (Gaston Batyi) as a young man returns to the village where
he grew up to see what the place looks like today.   His mother, Ana
(Cecilia Roth), was a doctor, and his father, Mario (Federico Luppi), a
former university professor who now taught school, went to Spain where
Ernesto was born.  His parent had fled the dictatorships that
flourished in Argentina.  Ernesto, in flashbacks, relives some of the
events of his youth.</P>
<P>     Using flashbacks, the film relates how the family returned to
Argentina, carrying on their struggle for the working class by actually
working with poor shepherds.   Mario tries to persuade the landowner's
foreman to let his daughter, an illiterate, attend his school but the
father refuses, saying it is unnecessary for a girl to be able to read
and write.  Ernesto takes on the task of teaching her without her
father's knowledge and ends up falling in love with her (Lorena del
Rio).</P>
<P>     Any number (too many) subjects are tackled by the director so that
there are some lulls.  Overall, it is well intentioned and does have
lots to say about the politics of Argentina.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Adolfo Aristarain.</PRE>
<PRE>In Spanish with English subtitles.</PRE>
