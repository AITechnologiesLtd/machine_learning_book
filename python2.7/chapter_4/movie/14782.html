<PRE>                 THE SHATTERED IMAGE (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Anne Parillaud and William Baldwin star in a film that
has two story lines about the same two people.  In one the Parillaud is
a contract killer who meets Baldwin through her work.  In the other
story line the two are on honeymoon in Jamaica and there are mysterious
threats.  The viewer is watching not only to see how the story lines
work out, but what is the relation the story lines bear to each other.
Rating: 6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Rual Ruiz, screenplay by Duane Poole.
   - We move back and forth between two story lines.  In one story line
     Jessie is an efficient emotionless assassin, In the other she is a
     frail newlywed, the victim of rape and later attempted suicide.
   - Point of film is to untangle what the two story lines have to do
     with each other.  How can these both be the same woman.
   - Graham Greene is oddly cast as Jamaican policeman.
   - Dreamy photography of Jamaica.
   - The ending leaves many questions unanswered.</P>
