<PRE>KISS THE GIRLS (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Gary Fleder
Writer: David Klass (based on the novel by John Patterson)
Starring: Morgan Freeman, Ashely Judd, Cary Elwes, Tony Goldwyn, Jay O.
Sanders, Bill Nunn, Brian Cox, Justina Vail, Jeremy Piven, Roma Mafia</P>
<P>America seems to have a disgusting fetish for serial killer films.  Of
course, I'm no hypocrite; I love them too.  But I only like them when
they're intelligent, non-formualtic, and perhaps even satirical,
carrying a strong message about something.  "Kiss the Girls" is none of
these.  A formulatic yet atmospheric film, it seems to walk on the fine
line between cliche and original filmmaking.  But at the end, the film
trips, and lands on the cliche side.</P>
<P>"Kiss the Girls" deals with a serial killer who's not actually a serial
killer.  He's a collector of fine-looking women, who he cages, rapes,
injects drugs into, and all-around worships...but in that crazy,
psychotic fashion.  We see him, but we only in shadows, and only with a
funky mask over his face, like he were some romantic Phantom of the
Opera.  We also hear him in a deep whisper, and one can only guess that
we see him throughout the film.</P>
<P>We are introduced to forensic psychologist, Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman,
giving the film some well-needed clout), and in the most cliched way
possible: on a case where we witness his forte.  He talks some women out
of killing herself, from which we learn: a) he's a gentle man, b) he's
more intelligent than everyone else we're gonna meet, and c) he's gonna
have to do the same thing again towards the end, but break his own
rules.  I'm only saying this because I thought that when I saw the
scene.</P>
<P>He begins investigating our designated sicko, who calls himself
Cassanova, and meets some other detectives and whatnot, including the
southern-accented Nick Ruskin (Cary Elwes), a guy named Kyle Craig (Jay
O. Sanders), among others.  The actors all do a good job of looking
creepy, but we all know who it is the first time we see him/her anyway.</P>
<P>We also meet Kate McTiernan (Ashely Judd), a beautiful, highly
intelligent med student, who also takes kickboxing (which, by the rules
of cliche, will help her in a couple spots).  She's soon taken hostage
by Cassanova (she has to - she lives in a giant house all by herself,
which she dimly lights just so she can't tell that anyone's there).  And
predictably enough, she escapes in an escape so simple that you wonder
if the killer LET her go on purpose.</P>
<P>Predictably enough, she's teamed with Alex, and the two are doing some
investigating together.  While the first half wasn't actually bad in
establishing mood, this half is a complete mess, as they journey all
around, pick up convenient clues, and even follow a lead (Tony Goldwyn -
I thought he was dead).  The film has what seems to be a nice close, but
we HAVE to have a big cliche-ridden struggle between the two leads and
Cassanova, who turns out to be exactly who I thought it was from the
beginning.  He has a stupid motive, which tries desperately to be
satirical of something, but ends in a big cliche.  I left in utter
disgust.</P>
<P>There are some good things, though.  The film does well with some
atmosphere in certain places, and some key scenes ARE well-directed. 
Her drug-induced escape scene is handled wonderfully, and even her
kidnap is pretty creepy.  And, of course, Morgan Freeman is awesome. 
When is this guy not awesome, though?  The only reason he was cast was
to give it some merit, and he does give it a great edge that wouldn't be
there with any other actor.  Freeman is one of those actors who everyone
likes merely because of his presence, and also because he always nails
his performances.  This is no exception.  Judd is also pretty good too,
but we already knew that also.  But what is Cary Elwes doing here?  I
like the guy, but he's suffered the same kind of fate Anthony Perkins
suffered after "Psycho": he can't do any role convincingly since he was
so awesome in "The Princess Bride."  I found myself laughing at his
performance and for the wrong reasons.  Poor guy.</P>
<P>Director Gary Fleder (of "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead," the
title to which was better than the movie) tries to make a creepy,
atmospheric picture, but makes a film which lacks in some of the better
elements, particular origninality, and a killer whom one finds
themselves respecting.  Cassanova is a crap serial killer, not because
he's not really one, but because he's not really that fascinating.  He's
crazy, and that's all.  Hannibal Lecter and "Se7en"'s John Doe were more
than that.  They walked the fine line between brilliance and insanity. 
Cassanova is way on the insane side, and is thus not a great killer.</P>
<P>"Kiss the Girls" was a let-down, particularly because the previews made
it look like it may actually stand a chance against such brilliant
serial killer films as "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en."  But it
doesn't, and ends up just another one of those cheap thrillers, with a
bit of clout from the acting.</P>
