<PRE>                                GOLDENEYE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Yet another super-criminal has a
          nefarious plot that James Bond has to thwart.  This
          was really a test episode to see if the series
          should continue now that almost everyone who made
          the original series what it was is gone.
          Unfortunately, Bond is already an anachronism and
          this film makes matters worse than they need to be.
          Rating: 0 (-4 to +4) [This review contains
          discussions of film flaws that are minor spoilers.]</PRE>
<P>     As James Bond films go, GOLDENEYE is some distance from the bottom
of the pack, but more importantly it is also a long way from the top.
As an attempt to jumpstart the stalled series with an almost entirely
new crew of talent on both sides of the lens, it is a failure.  Without
Richard Maibaum's view of who Bond is, without the tension of a John
Barry score, with an almost entirely new cast including a new actor in
the role of Bond, GOLDENEYE comes off like an imitation of a Bond film.
And there is no shortage of imitations.  CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is a
better spy thriller and has more of a feel of authenticity than any of
the Bond films certainly including GOLDENEYE.  It doesn't help that the
film is trying to have as much sex and violence as ever while paying
lip-service to feminism and an anti-violence philosophy.  The new
distaff head of staff puts Bond down as a sexist, mysogynist dinosaur
and the woman that he saves puts him and the villain down as a "boys
with toys" and criticizes their violence.  Bond just takes it as if to
say of course it is correct.  If even the script says there is nothing
to admire about Bond, why should the audience feel any different?</P>
<P>     The film's biggest thrill is the gunsight-iris opening that is
like a trademark seal.  That says that what follows is a GENUINE JAMES
BOND FILM.  And it may be just from habit, but the beginning of a new
Bond film is still an exciting moment.  Unfortunately the thrill is not
sustained.  Replaying scenes of Bond winning in a casino against a
villain and then identifying himself as "Bond ... James Bond," and
recreating scenes from previous films are obviously trying too hard to
move Brosnan into the role.  The famous Bond wit has never been so
strained, with Bond making comments after a near-death in one close
call in a helicopter about "the things we do for frequent flier
mileage."  And wearing thin is the usual convention that the villains
kill people right and left, but cannot bloody their hands by putting a
bullet between Bond's temples.  Instead they time and again leave Bond
in shaky death traps from which he escapes.</P>
<P>     And in spite of the new post-Cold-War setting, the basic plot is
not so different from those done in the 1970s.  In fact, it probably
would have worked better then.  In GOLDENEYE the former Soviets have a
weapon that nullifies computers.  The weapon is stolen by an unknown
super-criminal with plans to use it on a major city.  Bond (played for
the first time by Pierce Brosnan) has to stop the criminal, but first
he has to determine who it is that he has to stop.  (It is not a tough
guess for the audience.)</P>
<P>     The film starts in flashback from nine years earlier with a
Pyrrhic victory for 007.  Bond destroys a Soviet nerve gas factory, but
in doing it loses personal friend 006 (Sean Bean).  Now back in the
present the death of 006 hangs over Bond and the events of the film.
After the pre-credit action sequence, the first part of the film deals
with the theft of the Goldeneye device.  This is a long sequence that
involves little participation from Bond.  It does, however, introduce
Bond to a new assassin, Xenia Onatopp (Femke Janssen) who gets a sexual
charge from danger and murder and who mixes love and death by crushing
men between her legs during love-making.  Bond is dispatched to
St. Petersberg to investigate the destruction of the base that might
have controlled the Goldeneye device.</P>
<P>     So how is Pierce Brosnan as the fifth James Bond of the United
Artists series?  In a word, disappointing.  He is a Bond in the
tradition of Roger Moore, which is just what the series does not need.
I will conclude this review with some comments about casting the Bond
role.  Femke Janssen is not entirely believable as an assassin, but she
plays so offbeat and enigmatic a character that she makes herself the
center of attention in all her scenes.  She certainly is one of the
better Bond villains.  Gottfried John is, like Brosnan and Sean Bean,a
TV veteran having had the most interesting role on the abortive series
"Space Rangers."  Here he does not have enough to do, but he is a good
actor.  Joe Don Baker is a bad choice for a CIA agent having played a
memorable villain in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.</P>
<P>     There are some serious problems with the script, but none worse
than in the pre-credit sequence.  That sequence is usually a throw-away
but here it sets up the whole story.  Also, it involves two very
impressive stunts.  The problem is that one of the stunts requires that
the sequence take place at a very large dam; the other requires that it
take place high in mountains where you do not generally find huge dams.
And when you see the mountain base from above there is no dam in sight.
It seems unlikely that the villains' dish could be built particularly
where it is without attracting a great deal of attention.  And it does
not take much knowledge of history to know that this particular local
government is very edgy about what can be seen from overhead
surveillance.  Nor could the antenna be hidden where it is without
damaging it, nor could it be brought out of hiding and so quickly not
show the signs of where it was hidden.</P>
<P>     I would complain that the Internet address that is mentioned in
the film does not follow the correct naming convention, but it is just
nice to see computer nerds as important figures in a James Bond film.
But not even a computer nerd types on a standard keyboard one-handed
while he fidgets with the other hand.</P>
<P>     There is just too much that is too silly about GOLDENEYE and too
many mistakes in the making.  It is not as actively stupid as some Bond
films have been, but it is well below average in intelligence for the
already not too cerebral series.  I give it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>     Just so the reader can know what my values are in Bond films I
would rate the Bond film best to worse as:
     1.  FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
     2.  ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE
     3.  THUNDERBALL
     4.  DR. NO
     5.  LICENSE TO KILL
     6.  GOLDFINGER
     7.  FOR YOUR EYES ONLY
     8.  YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE
     9.  THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS
     10.  THE SPY WHO LOVED ME
     11.  OCTOPUSSY
     12.  GOLDENEYE
     13.  DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER
     14.  THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN
     15.  A VIEW TO A KILL
     16.  MOONRAKER
     17.  LIVE AND LET DIE</PRE>
<P>     A comment about the casting of Bond: As close as Sean Connery is
identified with the role, the actor who best embodies the character as
created by Fleming is Timothy Dalton.  Brosnan and Moore are too
smooth.  James Bond is at heart a thug for the Secret Service. He needs
a sharp, hard, flinty edge.  He can dress up in evening clothes and
appear charming but he never turns off the animal instincts just below
the surface.  Only Dalton brought out that aspect of his character.  If
Dalton is not going to take the role any more, perhaps they have the
right actor in this film in the wrong role.  Sean Bean did a very
impressive job in the two Richard Sharpe stories that have been shown
in this country.  He did a good job as 006 and should be at least
considered as 007, if it doesn't take too much time from the Sharpe
series, which frankly is better than the Bond series.  And they could
do a lot worse than to bring in Brian Cox, also from the Sharpe series,
to play M.</P>
