<PRE>"We're on a mission from God."</PRE>
<P> While that was the catchphrase of the original film, its sequel, Blues
Brothers 2000, has a new one: "The Lord works in mysterious ways." if
only we could have had some sort of storyline with our movie.
 Anyway, Blues Brothers 2000, once again scrioted by Dan Aykroyd and
John Landis(who, of course also directed ths and the first one), stars
Aykroyd as Elwood J. Blues. He's released from prison 18 years after the
first film, and immediately sets out to find family.
 He learns that both his brother Jake (the talented late John Belushi)
and his stepfather Curtis (the late Cab Calloway) are now deceased from
Mother Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman). Not only does she still whack
him when he misbehaves, but she asks him to mentor Buster (J. Evan
Bonifant), ten-year-orphan. Elwood is reluctant, but agrees to anyway.
 Soon, he meets Mighty Mack (John Goodman), a bartender at the strip
club his former drummer owns. Elwood seeks to, like in the original
film, put the band back together, but is pursued by his stepfather's
illegitamate son Cabel Chamberlain (Joe Morton), the no-nonsense
commander of the Illinois police, a right-wing militia group, and the
Chicago affiliate of the Moscow mafia.
 This all culminates in a "Battle of The Bands" contest held in New
Orleans at a voodoo queen's (R+B star Erykah Badu) mansion between The
Blues Brothers Band and The Louisiana Gator Boys (B.B King, Eric
Clapton, the list goes on and on.).
 In between what should be a plot is instead wonderful musical
production numbers (634-5879 by Wilson Pickett and Eddie Flyod, Turn On
Your Love Light, R-E-S-P-E-C-T by Aretha Franklin, Maybe I'm Wrong by
Blues Traveler, and many, many more).All in all, even though this sequel
didn't have the plot or comedy of its predecessor (and NO ENDING?!), the
music makes one forget about the film's many shortcomings. Nowhere near
as good as the first, but the music, choreography (especially by
Bonifant!), and songs make up for that.
 Ultimately, Blues Brothers 2000, while nothing like the first film, is
a car-crashing, toe-tapping classic that is a wonderful follow-up and a
unique, hilarious, and outrageously wonderful cult classic.</P>
