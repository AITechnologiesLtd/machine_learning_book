<P>   The Bible says, "Respect, but suspect."  Ronald Reagan's
favorite quote (about a new relationship with the Soviets), was
"Trust, but verify."  Any gambler will tell you, "Have faith, but
cut the cards."  It's a tough world out there, as David Mamet
well knows, where you just don't know who people really are. 
The lesson we take home from "The Spanish Prisoner" is,
"Don't be naive, don't be a victim.  Harden your shell or you'll
be taken for a ride."  But "The Spanish Prisoner," despite this
moral and its PG rating, is not didactic, it's not a junior high-
school lesson, and in fact it's for a special, mature, adult
audience that can appreciate his signature dialogue, craft at
developing a plot, and ability to capture and challenge his
viewers.  With due respect to "House of Games," which
featured his wife (from 1977 to 1989), Lindsay Crouse, in an
absorbing tale of cheating card sharps, "The Spanish
Prisoner" is perhaps his most intricate and arresting film to
date.  A Hitchcockian fable, it will keep you guessing to the
very last frame.</P>
<P>   Mention con arts and you're likely to think of small-timers
like the 3-card monte players who, working with shills, take
suckers for $20 a shot on urban street corners.  Or you may
recall cases of ATM scams usually involving elderly women
who freely withdraw money from their accounts in the hope of
gaining larger sums from the tricksters.  "The Spanish
Prisoner" deals at base with situations that are not very
different, but they involve much larger sums of money and the
gamesmanship involves surprise antics such as the setting up
of Swiss bank accounts, romantic interludes at a posh
Caribbean resort, a hushed dinner conversation at a chic
private clubs, and conversations between executives in a
modish Manhattan office.  The name of the game is money,
and the villains are more likely wear Armani suits than Adidas
sneakers and baseball caps.</P>
<P>   Featuring a superb performance by Campbell Scott (son of
George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst who looks nothing like
his folks), "The Spanish Prisoner" deals with a plot to steal
the blueprint of an invention, one which is called a process
and consisting of a notebook filled with mathematical symbols
that only Will Hunting and a few people of an inner circle
could decipher.  Only one copy exists, and that is kept under
lock by its inventor, Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) in a safe in his
company office.  The confidence people are determined to pry
that book from his hands and play on Joe's resentment at
being put off each time he asks for the bonus he knows he
deserves.  When businessman Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin)
hears of the Joe's plight during a conversation they have in
the fictional Caribbean island of St. Estephe, he offers to help
and invites the inventor to a dinner when they return to New
York.  In an intrigue involving a company secretary, Susan
(Rebecca Pidgeon--who is the wife of writer-director Mamet)
and a company lawyer, George Lang (Ricky Jay), Joe finds
himself getting deeply involved in an machination which takes
him far afield from his original motive to receive his due from
his reluctant boss, Klein (Ben Gazzara).  Though he receives
the assistance of an FBI agent, Pat McCune (Felicity
Huffman)--who sets up a sting to capture the alleged criminal
Dell--Joe becomes the perfect patsy, a Kafkaeseque victim
who is arrested and who faces a long jail term for acts he
would not dream of committing.</P>
<P>   David Mamet's critics have long held that his movie
characters are nothing but cold, skilled mechanics; that his
films are simply games that are not playful and hardly
absorbing.  While the anti-Mamet contingent may well
consider "The Spanish Prisoner" another in a line of films like
"House of Games" with the idiomatic dialogue found most
conspicuously in "Speed-the-Plow," his fans--and indeed a
crossover audience as well--will not only love his latest effort
but be tempted to see it once more to catch clues they may
have missed.</P>
<P>   The noir ambiance of "The Spanish Prisoner" is furthered
by Carter Burwell's eerie soundtrack in a movie that seems
always to hold back the very information which could give
away the store.  Crackling dialogue, a wonderful cast which
includes Steve Martin, who is apparently seeking to broaden
his base with serious roles, and a riveting performance by
Campbell Scott as a vulnerable everyman, should be included
on every serious moviegoer's schedule.  Rated PG.  Running
Time: 112 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
