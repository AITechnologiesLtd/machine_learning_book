<PRE>                             NOTHING PERSONAL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>In Ireland, it's referred to as "the troubles."  And what a terrible
euphemism it has been and continues to be.  By this time, with a half
dozen films dealing with the subject of the Catholic IRA and the
Protestant paramilitary  (both of whom believe in the same god, Jesus),
it would seem that every moviegoer would know everything there is to
know about that small piece of North Ireland territory.  Each movie
seems to have tackled a different aspect of "the troubles" but NOTHING
PERSONAL" explains somewhat better what iS going on.</P>
<P>The recent, THE DEVIL'S OWN,  NAME OF THE FATHER, MOTHER'S SON, to name
but a few, have touched on the consequences but not on the root cause.
This film, while not pointing a finger, does do some enlightening.</P>
<P>Kenny (James Frain), Protestant and Liam (John Lynch), Catholic, were
childhood friends.  No longer;  When a pub frequented by Protestants
is blown up, all hell breaks loose.  Like the gangs in the U.S. who
hold their "turf" so dear they will kill to keep others off it, the
Catholics and Protestants have their own.  A piece of jagged metal
separates the two neighborhoods but the metal is only symbolic; a new
increased hatred is on the loose..  Anyone found wandering in the
other's part is fair game.  "Nothing personal;" that is just how it
is.  Cooler heads such as Leonard's (Michael Gambon) of the Protestant
faction arranges a truce with the local IRA leader but nothing can
stop the crazed, fanatic Kenny gang from seeking revenge.</P>
<P>Liam's son is missing, apparently having wandered into the enemy sector
so Liam has to find him before anyone gets shot.  But Liam gets caught
by the Kenny gang and held and beaten while being questioned.  And the
internecine war goes on with seemingly no end in sight.</P>
<P>A very tense film packed with powerful emotions.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan.</PRE>
