<P>     I keep reading respected reviewers who say that this is the 17th
James Bond flick, when I count it as the 18th.  I guess too many people
have read the presskit that mentions "the 16 previous Bond films"
without double-checking.  Never trust pressbooks.  They can provide
useful information, but they also abound in hype, often have bad
grammar, and bad spelling errors.  In their biographical notices,
unlike the total listings of credits you find in many European
pressbooks, they can also conveniently omit references to movies that
have bombed.</P>
<P>     The new Bond is Pierce Brosnan.  I'd rather see a Pierce-Arrow
classic car than a Pierce Brosnan.  Mind you, I wish him all the best,
along with the rest of humanity.  But without being bad, he is no suave
Sean Connery, no "isn't this a joke?" Roger Moore, no eager-somber
Timothy Dalton.  By comparison Brosnan lacks a marked personality, is
rather inexpressive and delivers his lines without panache.</P>
<P>     Dalton, by the way, was in the much-maligned 17th Bond movie,
LICENSE TO KILL (1989).  It is perhaps the most serious, cruel and
sadistic Bond movie, and for sure the most personal one, and
additionally the best role of Robert Davi (the villain).  It stands
high on my list of 007 entertainments.  And another Bond, George
Lazenby in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, has also been unfairly
defamed.</P>
<P>     Bond films have been a blessing, a mix of fantasy and adventure
that, because of their very whimsy, defanged their violence, unlike so
many other action movies.  Bond films never outstayed their welcome,
but GOLDENEYE seems to.</P>
<P>     I don't think that we've reached the point of saturation with 007,
or that lacking the Soviet adversaries or their surrogates, Bond has
run out of steam.  There is a great deal that could be Bonded if
cleverly adapted to the changing times--easily as much as before
since villainy is still all over and technology keeps leaping and
bounding, There are always new opportunities for 007 to reappear.  This
is still the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country.</P>
<P>     GOLDENEYE opens with 007 and 006 (Sean Bean) facing unexplained
villains in Russia.  The pre-credit sequence has Bond do the longest,
most incredible bungee jump ever, fly through the air into a small
plane's seat, and other such goodies.  It is so outrageous that it
could put you in a state of amused euphoria.</P>
<P>     Then we cut to nine years later ... and filmic erosion sets in.
Bond's new boss M is played by talented Judi Dench.  She may be
familiar to you from the current, clever PBS British series "As Time
Goes By" in which she has the female lead as a mature lady who runs a
secretarial agency and who meets up with her former amour Geoffrey
Palmer--after 38 years.  Dench adds a so-called feminist or PC touch,
but is not especially interesting and her part is quite small.  Michael
Kitchen (whose credits are not in the presskit) is the actor who played
superbly Charles, Prince of Wales in something I saw on TV.  He has a
cultivated nasal voice, beautiful manners, a memorable presence.  Alas,
his role in GOLDENEYE is tiny too.</P>
<P>     The Aston-Martin auto of yore is now being upstaged by the blatant
product placement of a BMW.  How sad to see Great Britain yielding to
Germany.  The BMW is given nothing to do so far as I know, but then I
may have closed my eyes.</P>
<P>     The female villain (Famke Janssen) goes by the name of Xenia
Onatopp.  She is a paragon of unsafe sex, the summit of
sex-and-violence as one entity.  This long-nosed woman has killing
legs, like long-nose pliers that crush her bedmates to death during
copulation.  This is not particularly amusing, nor is the name
Onatopp.  It repeats the mistake of GOLDFINGER where a woman was called
"Pussy Galore," and the additional lapse of taste, almost twenty years
later, of baptizing another lady "Octopussy," in the eponymous movie.
Those names may have been in Ian Fleming's texts but they were
aberrations, snickering schoolchild humor that here becomes crass
stuff.  It takes away from the would-be classiness of 007 films.  And,
no, I am not a prude.</P>
<P>     Bond finds himself facing military and para-military Russian
gangsters who are out to join Capitalism (with a capital C) through the
use of a secret weapon.  I won't let the cat out of the bag save to
opine that unlike Bond's "shaken but not stirred" vodka martinis (yes,
these drinks are back too) the story neither shakes nor stirs you.</P>
<P>     Many of the old conventions are around, minus the old humor.
There are some attempts at jocularity but feeble and forced ones.
Boris the super-programmer who's also supposed to provide comic relief
is poorly handled.</P>
<P>     We get a car race, a baccarat duel with a mysterious woman at
Monte-Carlo's gambling tables, cleavage, kinky sex, orgies of action,
several locations, gadgets, and so on.</P>
<P>     What's new is the use of the paramount 1990s cliche: computers,
their wizard manipulators, the impossible things they do.  What's
almost new is that Bond, as sartorially impeccable as can be in his
Savile Row tailoring and what look to me like Turnbull and Asher
shirts, gets no tears, wrinkles, soot or spots and remains immaculate
while engaging in outlandish action.  See Bond driving a tank in the
streets of St. Petersburg as he chases a car.  See him attacking a
train with his tank.</P>
<P>     What's also new is the containment of Bond's sexism.  When Pierce
Brosnan vanquishes the villainness it is not because she's female but
because he is Bond.  For a change, there's just one new woman carnally
involved with James Bond.  She is no sex object but the pretty
Assistant Programmer who has brains as well as guts.  The actress is
Izabella Scorupco, a Pole from Sweden who has been a model abroad,
became a singer, was in a couple of Swedish films. "Scorupco" may sound
like the movie's fabrication, but is not.</P>
<P>     In case you wonder, the killer-lady Famke Janssen's real name is
apparently not a concoction either.  She is Dutch, moved to the States
eleven years ago, majored in writing and literature at Columbia
University, studied acting, has been on TV's "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" as Picard's love interest.  She had her movie debut in
FATHERS AND SONS.</P>
<P>     New too is the actual use of location shooting in the former
Leningrad.  I tip my synthetic fur hat to the filmmakers for achieving
feats of SFX (special effects) under impossible conditions and perhaps
surpassing most other Bonds in production values.  This is the reason I
exceptionally include some of the countless artisans/technicians in the
credits above--and upgrade the film to two stars.  By itself, the
technical prowess rates an A, but there's more to movies than
gizmoism.</P>
<P>     GOLDENEYE uses the splintered approach.  It is so busy with
action, explosions, computers, guns, planes, trains and automobiles
that it has no time for vignettes, relationships, or expanding
anything.  It is incoherent, diffuse, convoluted, with non sequiturs
and gaps as big as the Baltic sea--as opposed to wide lakes in most
other Bond films.</P>
<P>     The progression is artificial.  Past a point, its arbitrariness
becomes annoying.  Past the next point, it becomes a yawner,
dehumanizes the movie, desensitizes the viewer.  Gadgets and action and
SFX make the film illogical, not by ordinary standards of course (which
is to be expected) but by James Bond wild fantasy standards.</P>
<P>     New Zealand-born director Campbell has done some nice work in
England.  In the US his latest is the ho-hum NO ESCAPE with Ray
Liotta, not a hit but no disaster either.</P>
<P>     Richard Maibaum, the American who was the habitual screenwriter of
007 movies, died in 1991.  The new writers, also American, and here
with their first produced feature, seem to have taken ideas from
fifteen different Bond films and strung them together.  They are big on
lapses and mistakes.  For example Ms. Scorupco survives a catastrophe
magically.  The arch-villain suddenly turns lecherous for a brief
spell--and then nothing is made of this.</P>
<P>     The exchange of bullets goes beyond ordinary conventions: we
accept that movie bad guys will shoot the hero 100 times and not score
once, while the protagonist's marksmanship is perfect.  But a ratio of
1,000 to 1 in both cases?</P>
<P>     Saving graces.  A few bits are funny, like the tank's mayhem and
its snatching the statue of a winged horse, or like Russian gangster
club-owner Robbie Coltrane having a singer girl-friend who demolishes
amusingly the song "Stand by Your Man."</P>
<P>     There is also one subtlety of sorts.  In the Gospel According to
Bond it is the Brits who are the salt of the earth, often assisted by
their second-fiddle American cousins.  Bond has been played by a
Scotsman (Connery), an Englisman (Londoner Moore), an Aussie (Lazenby)
and a Welshman (Dalton).  Now comes the Irish Bond (Brosnan).  No
matter, they are all loyal subjects of H.M. in the films.</P>
<P>     The Bondian Standard has mostly odd-looking-and-sounding
foreigners as the enemy.  In GOLDENEYE there is a Very Bad person who
though not a foreigner, through a specious explanation does turn out to
be one after all.  It's really pushing the envelope, but at least the
trick saves British honor and fealty.  I can't give away more, but
you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie.</P>
