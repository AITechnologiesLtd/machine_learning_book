<P>In French, with subtitles. Based on the book Outwitting the Gestapo by
Lucie Aubrac.</P>
<P>A fact of life of the CrankyCritic.com boards is that there is little
interest in foreign films. Long time readers know that Cranky still sees
and recommends 'em when they strike me as something above average. Well,
here we go again.</P>
<P>The WWII movies we've seen in the last year or so, like many of the
black and white John Wayne starrers Cranky grew up on (on teevee, I'm
not that old) tend to concentrate on battles or the bonds formed by
soldiers because of those battles. How nice then that we see a movie
about the folk who fought the battle back home, and still had the
opportunity to live "normal" lives -- to the extent that you could
assuming that the Nazis who overran your country allowed it. The country
is France. The stars of the story are members of the French Resistance
and most of what you see on the big screen actually happened.</P>
<P>Allow me to digress: back in my film school days the screenwriting
teacher was fond of saying that all great stories are love stories. She
was right. In this film, as you would expect, the Nazis are the bad guys
and the Resistance are the good guys. Central to the story is Lucie
Aubrac (Carole Bouquet) and her husband Raymond (Daniel Auteuil) and her
year-plus old son Jean-Pierre (Maxime Henry), nicknamed Boo-Boo. It is
1943 in the city of Lyons in what is called the Southern Zone. The
government which rules the zone is more collaborationist (they would say
realistic) than patriotic and the Nazi grip is noticeably, but not much,
looser. The Aubracs follow leader in exile Charles DeGaulle, who directs
their efforts via coded broadcasts from the BBC in London. These
"terrorists" are particularly effective, as is seen in the opening
sequence of the film and escaping from the clutches of the French police
is as much an intellectual exercise as a legal challenge.</P>
<P>But . . . and you knew there was a but coming, right? you can only
change your location and identity a couple of time, evade the jaws of
tyranny once or twice before they come snapping down on you. When they
do, do you choose saving your country or saving the ones you love? The
few members of the Resistance that you'll come to know all make
different choices, and you can argue them over coffee afterwards. In a
forged identity in which he is single, Raymond must deny all knowledge
of the woman he loves; to do so saves her skin and that of the few
freedom fighters still on the loose. But the Gestapo has figured out who
he really is, and have sentenced the man to death. For Lucie, saving her
husband preserves the fragile remnants of Resistance leadership in the
Southern Zone and more important, saves her husband. This desire to have
her cake and eat it too leads to some compelling and very dramatic
scenes on the big screen, as she coordinates efforts to free her man
before his date with the executioner.</P>
<P>This small story of Lucie Aubrac within the big story of "The Big One"
is a fine one, well acted and well told in a fairly matter of fact
style. One subplot involves the question of what happened to the Jews of
France, but rather than being an acknowledgment of the Holocaust, it
presents a most interesting twist to the main story, which I'll leave
you to discover on your own. Blink and you'll also miss the fact that
one of the Gestapo officers in the story is the notorious Klaus Barbie.
If you don't know who Barbie was or what he did, you won't miss much in
terms of the main story. It's just an extra layer of icing on the cake
of a beautifully put together script.</P>
<P>And, being a French film, the woman is gorgeous and her guy is not. Ah,
if only real life were really that way (said all the single male critics
on the way out of the screening room. This one included.) <vbg></P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Lucie Aubrac, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<P>The subtitles don't get in the way of the story. That's important. The
story is great and the stuff I didn't tell you makes it even greater.
Lucie Aubrac is highly recommended.</P>
