<PRE>Legally Blonde (2001)

<P>"I even got a Coppola to direct my admissions video!"</P>
<P>Starring Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair,
Holland Taylor, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Jennifer
Coolidge. Directed by Robert Luketic. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Blondes may have more fun, but not if they're stuck
watching Legally Blonde, a mostly witless comedy that
is blessed with Reese Witherspoon. It's a
featherweight romp that wants to flaunt stereotypes
but instead winds up reaffirming them. Hovering
somewhere between outright silliness and heavy-handed
moralizing, the movie never decides where it wants to
go or what it wants to be. This middle-of-the-road
indecision keeps the farce firmly on the ground when
it should be taking off.</P>
<P>Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your classic, ditzy,
stereotypical blonde. She has a 4.0 GPA in beauty
school, spends her time reading fashion magazines and
talking movie stars out buying "truly hideous angora
sweaters." Her boyfriend, on the other hand, comes
from an established family of congressman, and wants
to be one himself. He dumps poor Elle because he needs
someone "serious," even if they have no fashion sense.</P>
<P>Elle does not understand what it is about her that
isn't "serious." Then she sees an article in a
magazine and it comes to her: the love of her life
doesn't want a fashion maven, he wants a law student!
So she hits the books, takes the College Boards, gets
"a Coppola" to direct her admissions video and voila!
-- in the mail comes an acceptance letter from
Harvard. If only it was actually that easy...</P>
<P>For a while, the movie coasts on Witherspoon's
charisma and the inherent charm of the
Clueless-goes-to-Harvard scenario. The brilliant
Holland Taylor shows up as a tough law professor,
immediately livening up the proceedings, and Elle's
battle with the snobby Harvard types is amusing, if
never brilliant (although the irony of Elle's own
snobbishness, one much more egregious and less
deserved, irked me). When Elle gets assigned to a
murder case involving a fitness guru and takes all
kinds of bizarre initiatives and learns all kinds of
unwanted "lessons," Legally Blonde loses its bounce.</P>
<P>The final courtroom scenes, in particular, are
counterproductive. Not only are they unfunny, easily
the least clever section on the script, but they
undermine the film's admirable, if unnecessary, "open
mind" message. I was troubled by how Elle was shown to
be incompetent in everything except fashion, fitness
and hair perms. The movie wants us to accept her as
sharp and intelligent, but prods us to laugh at her at
the same time. Mainstream filmmakers -- or maybe their
financiers -- always try to make movies that are all
things to all people, and it invariably blows up in
their faces.</P>
<P>What's worse, Legally Blonde doesn't have a sense of
the ridiculous. You can feel director Robert Luketic
trying in the courtroom scenes, but something always
stops him from delving into the truly madcap. Thus we
have time to question the movie and ponder its logic,
something that should never happen in a movie as
profoundly silly as this.</P>
<P>Witherspoon is a great actress, here playing the
opposite of her Tracy Flick character in the
infinitely superior Election. The movie's failure is
not hers but the script's, which chooses the
well-trodden path at every fork in the road, and
sometimes even tries to take both paths at once. The
Chihuahua is cute, though. </P>
