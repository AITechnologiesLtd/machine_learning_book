<P>The opening scene of Tim Robbins' historical fiction CRADLE WILL ROCK shows 
a moment that sets the tone for the entire sprawling piece.  Emily Watson's 
character, Olive Stanton, awakens on the stage behind the screen of a 1930's 
movie palace.  She's homeless, and as she puts on her stockings and shoes to 
skedaddle before the manager catches her, we watch the backward images up on 
the screen.  Quickly the social milieu is clear, and Robbins has done his 
job of making history accessible:  he has shown the place of an individual 
within the roiling span of history.  The Great Depression is on, and the 
lives of countless Americans are in fact backwards.</P>
<P>What stands at the center of the narrative is the play "The Cradle Will 
Rock" by Marc Blitzstein.  It is a musical with a political bent, a 
pro-union diatribe against the exploitative capitalists who are scrambling 
to protect their interests from what they perceive as a very serious 
Communist threat.  As part of the Federal Theater Project - a division of 
the Works Progress Administration - the play is being produced by John 
Houseman (Cary Elwes) and directed by Orson Welles (Angus MacFadyen).  
Following the production of the play, the main plot takes us through 
rehearsals - including a few tantrums thrown by Welles - all the way through 
opening day, the day after the Federal Theater Project has been closed by 
the government.</P>
<P>With painstaking research and risk-taking that is quite creative, Tim 
Robbins holds our interest through the entire piece.  CRADLE WILL ROCK 
(though I don't care for the title) is a film full of ideas, inspired 
directing, and political messages that are still fresh.  There is a great 
deal of talk about prostitution, in both literal and figurative senses.  Is 
it selling out when Olive sings a song for a nickel on the street corner?  
When an artist paints a mural for a commission, or when a writer curtails 
her script to match the wishes of benefactors?  What comes first, survival 
or artistic integrity?  Robbins is to be admired for addressing these 
questions and many more.</P>
<P>One risk the director takes is in the strangeness of the playwright 
Blitzstein.  Hank Azaria plays the tortured writer, whom we see early in the 
film, working in his cramped apartment on the script to CRADLE.  Because 
he's not slept in two days, he seems to be hallucinating, the figures of his 
deceased wife and of the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht appearing to him 
frequently.  Later, after his arrest for being in the midst of a labor 
rally, Blitzstein composes large parts of his play from a jail cell, the 
apparitions acting as a sort of chorus.  Azaria does a nice transparent job 
with his character;  he is never obtrusive, but captures well the generous 
nature of the socially aware playwright.</P>
<P>Emily Watson, doing a very effective American accent, is fine as Olive 
Stanton.  After life hands her a hard time, she suddenly lands one of the 
lead roles in the Welles-directed vehicle, and her dreams proceed to come 
true.  One is reminded of Drieser's novel SISTER CARRIE, in which a young 
and vulnerable woman makes good on the stage.  Olive was selected by the 
producers because of her innocence;  even Watson's singing voice is plain 
and sincere.</P>
<P>As Orson Welles and John Houseman ( adults will remember Houseman from the 
television series "The Paper Chase"  and Smith Barney commercials, and 
perhaps Welles from wine commercials and appearances on the "Tonight Show" 
with his magic tricks), are done adequately by MacFadyen and Elwes.  In 
parts, though, MacFadyen overacts, and Elwes slips into pompous caricature.  
Their function in the plot is fulfilled well, however.</P>
<P>Robbins's wife Susan Saradon plays Margherita Sarfatti, an agent of the 
fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.  She's in the states to raise money for 
the building of an Italian war machine.  The relevance of the politics hits 
us cleverly, as we watch wealthy magnates like Gray Mathers (Philip Baker 
Hall) and William Randolph Hearst obtain masterpieces of Italian art in 
exchange for large cash stakes.  Again, art being sold out, this time in the 
most pathetic of senses, to be used by Mussolini and his ally, Hitler.  
Sarandon is best when she lets the character's politics hang all the way 
out, as when she scolds artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) for his political 
idealism and how he worked it into a mural commissioned by Nelson 
Rockefeller (John Cusack) to decorate a wall inside Rockefeller Center.</P>
<P>This political theme is explored further through the subplot involving 
Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), the administrator of the Federal Theater 
Project.  Jones gives Flanagan a sincerely mature and open-minded point of 
view; without hesitation she funds a worthwhile children's play, only to 
hear later some scandalous rumors about how the play encourages rebellious 
behavior!  In a scene out of countless movies set two decades later, we 
watch as Flanagan is grilled by misguided politicians with witch-hunting 
agendas.  Quiet but assertive, Jones tries to refute as well as she can the 
lurid assumptions surrounding her agency.  One hopes to see Jones  as a 
featured actress in many films to come.</P>
<P>Bill Murray, as Tommy Crickshaw the ventriloquist, and Joan Cusack, as Hazel 
Hoffman, work well together and serve as would-be love interest.  Although 
she works as a clerk in the WPA agency that hires the artists for the 
programs, Hoffman's politics eventually send her to testify against what she 
perceives as politically and racially dangerous topics.  Murray has a crush 
on the younger Hoffman, and seems to take up her torch merely because of his 
attraction.  Both actors have such sadly expressive faces as they discover 
their respective truths.</P>
<P>Robbins' directing chores must have kept him quite busy.  It is difficult to 
create a semblance of confusion, and the irony is that Robbins had to be 
supremely organized to make his action seem so chaotic.  In one of the most 
moving segments toward the end, Robbins employs canny cross-cutting that 
builds momentum among the subplots.  One smallish problem is that it is hard 
to tell if some scenes are meant as tour-de-force or as serious satire; but 
the sheer power of the premiere of "The Cradle Will Rock" offsets these 
concerns, with its unconventional staging and strong socio-political 
undercurrents.</P>
<P>The film is rated R for occasional strong language, some nudity - among 
artist Diego Rivera's models - and brief sexuality.  It would be fine for 
children 15 and above, and would definitely engage viewers who like to learn 
about history and drama.</P>
