<P>Susan Granger's review of "AMERICAN OUTLAWS" (Warner Bros.)</P>
<P>    Thomas Edison's "The Great Train Robbery" (1903) was the first
Western ever made and "Jesse James Under the Black Flag" (1923) first introduced
the outlaw folk hero. Now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, Jesse
James and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal MTV spin on an
American legend. The story begins as Jesse (charasmatic Colin Farrell) and his
brother Frank (Gabriel Macht), Cole and Scott Younger (Scott Caan, Will
McCormack) and trusty Comanche Tom (Nathaniel Arcand), after four years of
fighting for the Rebs in the Civil War, return to Liberty, Missouri - only to
discover Union troops are occupying their hometown. And an avaricious East Coast
railroad baron, Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin), is forcing farmers to sell their
land at less than true value, aided by Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) and his
infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. But
when Ma James (Kathy Bates) becomes one of their victims, Jesse and the rest of
the guys (Gregory Smith, Ty O'Neal, Joe Stevens) form the James-Younger gang to
wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and
robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. Plus there's romance - between
Jesse and a spunky hometown gal, Lee Mimms (Ali Larter). Working from a
politically-correct, cliché-drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by
Roderick Taylor and John Rodgers, director Les Mayfield keeps the action
fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. The choppy editing hurts
but Russell Boyd's cinematography, Luke Reichle's designer duds and Trevor
Rabin's music lend authenticity. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"American Outlaws" is a galloping, formulaic 3. It's the Wild West re-visited as
a date movie.</P>
