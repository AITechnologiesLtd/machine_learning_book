<P>A simple "trick" is what young Gabriel (Christian Campbell) has in mind
after he picks up male go-go dancer Mark (John Paul Pitoc) one lonely
night on a New York subway.  But what they get is something more than
either of them bargained for: countless obstacles, from Gabriel's pushy
best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling) and his even pushier (straight)
roommate (Brad Beyer) to bitter drag queen Miss Coco Peru (Clinton
Leupp), prevent the two from sealing the deal.  However, that's just as
well; as their shared night grows longer and longer, Gabe and Mark
experience, as the press notes say, "something more gratifying than a
one-night stand."</P>
<P>Like last year's entertaining _Billy's_Hollywood_Screen_Kiss_, sexual
orientation is moot in first-time feature director Jim Fall's breezy,
single-day-spanning romantic comedy.  The point is not that the main
characters are homosexual but that they are, like anyone in the world,
searching for some type of human connection--not just with others, but
with themselves, for aspiring Broadway composer Gabriel must learn to
find the passion within himself to fuel his work.  Adding greatly to the
film's universal accessibility is the likable pair of leads and an able
supporting cast--yes, even notorious over-hacktress Spelling, who is
perfectly cast as the histrionic and pretentious off-off-off-Broadway
hacktress Katherine.</P>
<P>On the other hand, "accessible" and "likable" aren't exactly the words
I'd apply to_Head_On_, a dark 1997 Australian gay-themed drama just about
to receive exposure on this side of the Pacific.  The main character of
Ari (Alex Dimitriades) is about as unlikable as one can get: lazy and
selfish, he spends his days and nights indulging in drugs and reckless,
anonymous sex when not arguing with his strict (and completely oblivious)
Greek parents and anyone else who dare cross him.  Consequently, as
director Ana Kokkinos unflinchingly tracks one typically destructive
24-hour span of Ari's directionless existence, one watches with the same
emotional detachment with which Ari tackles his own life.</P>
<P>But there is a method to this madness, and a universal, if rather bleak,
message to the film.  "I'm not going to make a difference, I'm not going
to change a thing," concludes Ari late in the film, and while most people
are afraid to admit it, that's pretty much the futile fate of every
single person on this planet, regardless of what good one attempts to
make of one's life (a certain recent outside event has certainly taught
me that); it's just that Ari bears no illusions about himself or how the
world works.  It's a testament to the sheer gutsiness of Dimitriades's
uninhibited performance that the audience bears no illusions about Ari
either.  _Head_On_ is certainly a film more easily admired than enjoyed,
but there is much to admire in this bold, unsettling film.  (_trick_
opens July 23; _Head_On_ opens August 13)</P>
