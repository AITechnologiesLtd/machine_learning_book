'Henry Fool' a charming epic about literary pretentions
You're not alone if you think the title of Hal Hartley's absorbing new film
`Henry Fool' sounds vaguely Shakespearean. It is, in fact, a title that
fits this raggedy, profane movie quite well, considering that Hartley's
themes here are ambition, vanity, morality and artistic vision. 
OK, Shakespeare it ain't. Still, Hartley -- the comic miniaturist who's
charmed thousands ... uh, hundreds with unorthodox, sometimes kinky little
dramas like `The Unbelievable Truth' and `Amateur' -- has created a
scruffy, immensely likable mini-allegory that should become his most
popular work. For the first time, Hartley has created a film that doesn't
feel like a sardonically diverting daydream. This one has charm and
substance.
Frustrated writers and unrecognized artists are likely to find a kindred
spirit in one of the two protagonists: a deadpan, withdrawn garbage man
named Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and a chain-smoking, greasy-haired mooch
named Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan).
As his surname suggests, young and tormented Simon leads a miserable kind
of life, living with his not-all-there mother and his haggard, sex-mad
sister Fay (indy film darling Parker Posey). Into this desperate household
walks Henry, a disheveled stranger, to rent the basement apartment. Henry
is a gabby Charles Bukowski wannabe who carries with him a grandiose
unpublished memoir he darkly calls his `confession,' a literary landmark
struggling to be born.
With Simon as his silent audience, Henry indulges in wild-eyed paranoia and
delusions of artistic importance. He uses a kind of reverse logic to state
his case: Since real artists are despised and isolated, then the despised
and isolated, a demographic in which both men count themselves, are the
world's artists and visionaries.
This inspires Simon to pick up the pen and begin writing his own opus. The
result is an epic poem that causes a visible reaction from anyone who reads
it. It becomes something of a sensation and, after a curt dismissal from a
vainglorious publisher, eventually propells Simon to the status of a young
lion of American poetry.
Curiously, in one of Hartley's more audacious artistic choices, we the
audience don't get even a taste of what is contained in Simon's poem or
Henry's memoir. We know these works only by the reactions they cause in
other people. In this way, we get to judge these `artists' by other means
than their creations.
Both lead actors are new to film and their freshness is intoxicating. As
Simon, James Urbaniak adopts a kind of stoic hostility to the world,
looking like a down-on-his-luck ex-member of Devo. It's a treat to see him
wrestle with the unfamiliar emotion of gratitude toward Henry, a reprobate
who clearly resents Simon's success.
Thomas Jay Ryan has the tastier role as the volcanic Henry and he clearly
dominates the movie from his first entrance. Ryan, an acclaimed
off-Broadway stage actor, gives Henry a rapacious alertness, a liar
convinced he is about to be exposed and the only way to save himself is to
build more lies. As the film progresses and Henry has to deal with Simon's
success, envy gives him an edge of unpredictability. The fact that we learn
Henry served time for having sex with a 13-year-old girl doesn't take an
edge off his charisma.
This super-charged relationship between these two losers, with the
complicating factor of Simon's sister Fay who literally brings Henry into
the family, moves the film forward whenever it threatens to sag. `Henry
Fool' is a comic epic about the power of the written word that doesn't
bother to show us a single written word. In the end, this film is more
about writers than about writing, about the fantasy of literary success
more than the reality of it. In that way, it's the unintentional biography
of literary pretenders everywhere from Shakespeare on down.</P>
