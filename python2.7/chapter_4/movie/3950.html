<PRE>                                    UNZIPPED
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>UNZIPPED
Featuring Isaac Mizrahi, Naomi Campbell, Sandra Bernhard
Edited by Paula Heredia
Directed by Douglas Keeve
U.S.A., 1995</PRE>
<P>     Who would have thought that one of the year's most satisfying
movies would be a 79-minute documentary about a clothing designer?  A
year ago, who would have guessed that Robert Altman's fashion industry
barbecue, READY TO WEAR (then called PRET-A-PORTER), would seem so
baggage-laden, and that unknown documentarian Douglas Keeve's doting
portrait of Isaac Mizrahi would seem lighter than air?</P>
<P>     Your mileage may vary, but for this jaded movie-goer, UNZIPPED is
an unmitigated treat, as much a relief from the practiced heaviosity of
Hollywood buckbusters as an air-conditioned movie house is from the
burning city streets.  Keeve's movie feels so free because it's a
portrait of the fashion industry from the inside, from a vantage point
that those with cynical intent could never reach (it's no secret that
Keeve and Mizrahi were in the throes of a relationship during the
shoot, but any reference to this has been excised from the finished
product).</P>
<P>     This is perhaps the most absurd of all big-ticket industries, and
Keeve shows what it feels like from the inside, when it lets its guard
down.  Mizrahi looks as much like a Peter Pan as any pop superstar,
using NANOOK OF THE NORTH as a springboard for his fall collection or
cavorting with beautiful supermodels as though all the streets of New
York lead to Neverland.  What's at stake, though, is his professional
reputation.  In the opening scenes, we see a little crowd following
Mizrahi through Manhattan as he reads the decidedly unflattering
reviews of his latest collection.  This tragedy in miniature sets the
story in motion, as we watch Mizrahi struggle to recreate his own image
as well as some cool clothes.</P>
<P>     Followers of the biz will no doubt enjoy seeing Mizrahi at work,
expounding on his personal philosophy, switching into depressive mode
when he learns that Gaultier may beat him to the "Eskimo chic" punch,
and confessing to his mother that he used to steal money from her purse
as a child (home movie footage reveals that he sported that Eraserhead
'do even then).  Douglas Keeve works stylishly enough to suck in the
unconverted, as well, with sometimes-arty composition within the frame
and occasional inserts of film leader to remind us of the documentary
process.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece is the all-important fashion show in New York's
Bryant Park, captured in full brilliant 35mm color with swooping crane
shots and a throbbing soundtrack.  The glossy shots of the catwalk
itself are intercut with more jittery footage from backstage, as the
models struggle to change from outfit to outfit, and Mizrahi himself
hops around, coaching them like a high school drama teacher.  These
scenes are breathtaking, and Keeve helps us understand what all the
fuss is about, even if we still believe the whole business is a little
weird.  We come away feeling like we know a little bit about Isaac
Mizrahi, even if the movie concentrates conspicuously on painting a
picture of the fashion industry as a perfect world, and turning Mizrahi
into a hero.  But when you consider the standard Hollywood alternatives
for hero worship (Stallone, Segal, et al), that might not be such a
bad thing after all.</P>
