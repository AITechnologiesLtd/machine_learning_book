Miracle on 34th Street (1994)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 42</PRE>
<P>"Miracle on 34th Street" is, of course, a remake of
the 1947 classic.  It is a risky business filming a
new version of a famous movie.  Can you imagine a
remake of "The Wizard of Oz" or "Citizen Kane" that could
rival the original?  Remakes such as "King Kong" (1976)
or "Red River" (1988) were financial disasters or
obscurities.  Comparison to the original can only
show the weaknesses of the later edition.</P>
<P>The basic plot is the same.  A famous New York Department
store (not to be confused with Macy's) hires an
elderly man to play Santa.  He is so good at the role
that he becomes famous.  Evil heads of rival department 
stores plot against Santa, placing him on trial.
Meanwhile, a charming young girl is unsure whether
Santa is real or a fraud.</P>
<P>The story has been updated for the nineties.  A love 
interest subplot has been added,  and Santa is on trial
not only for his integrity as Santa, but is in danger
of being placed in a sanitarium.</P>
<P>The biggest problem that this remake has is its very
wholesomeness.  This guarantees that the mother, father
figure, daughter and Santa himself will never stray
far from their idealized family portraits, and a happy
and predictable ending is in store.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Perkins plays the mother, and her star turn
has her choosing whether or not to accept suitor Dylan McDermott.
Although he is perfect in every way, and is conveniently
a free agent lawyer so that he can defend Santa in court,
it takes the magic of Santa to spur the romance along.
Why Santa would spend so much attention on the well-cared
for child when many others are in greater need is an issue 
not addressed.</P>
<P>"Miracle on 34th Street" is a competent but overly sweet
family picture that the little tykes will likely find
tedious.</P>
