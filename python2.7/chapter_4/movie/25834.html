THE ART OF WAR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>In Christian Duguay's THE ART OF WAR, it's death by noise.  No, not the 
characters' deaths, yours.  With its explosive sound effects and Normand 
Corbeil's bombastic score, the film is an Excedrin headache for viewers.</P>
<P>Wesley Snipes (BLADE) works in a covert UN operation so tough that it 
would make the CIA envious.  (Bet you didn't even know that the UN had a 
secret operation.)  A high-ranking Chinese diplomat is assassinated on 
the eve of a big trade agreement, so Snipes, as agent Shaw, goes into 
action.  The generic plot isn't important as it just provides the 
pretext for lots of fighting and gore.  The high-kicking Snipes looks 
like a black Jet Li auditioning to be the next James Bond.  The picture 
itself, with its glitzy skyscraper locales, wants badly to be the next 
ENTRAPMENT, which it isn't.</P>
<P>With its awful dialog, the movie works best when it shuts up.  Eleanor 
Hooks (Anne Archer), aide to U.N. Secretary General Douglas Thomas 
(Donald Sutherland), says, for example, "My instinct tells me that 
something is lurking under the surface." </P>
<P>What's lurking isn't a lot of brains.  When Shaw hears from his partner, 
Bly (Michael Biehn), over their communication system that Bly has been 
shot, Shaw doesn't bother asking his location.  Instead, Shaw goes 
around screaming and runs right into danger himself.  </P>
<P>Another time, as Agent Cappella (Maury Chaykin) is lying on the ground, 
the bad guys come in to finish him off.  These dumb villains have never 
heard of bulletproof vests, so they make sure that Cappella's dead by 
shooting him in the chest rather than the head.  Getting up alive 
afterwards, the director has Cappella take off his shirt to show us the 
vest.  He doesn't think we would be smart enough to figure that out on 
our own.</P>
<P>If all it takes to earn your entertainment dollars are audio assaults on 
your ears and bloody images for your eyes, THE ART OF WAR may be just 
your ticket.  Those who demand a bit more from a movie will be bitterly 
disappointed.</P>
<P>THE ART OF WAR runs 1:57.  It is rated R for strong violence, some 
sexuality, language and brief drug content and would be acceptable for 
older teenagers.</P>
