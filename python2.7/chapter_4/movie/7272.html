<PRE>                              THE DEVIL'S OWN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An IRA terrorist comes to the United
          States to buy weapons and brings mortal danger to
          his hosts, an honest cop and his family.  Alan
          J. Pakula directs Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford in a
          thoughtful action film whose strongest feature is
          that it does not have a pre-digested point of view
          on the politics of Northern Ireland.  The film is a
          taut and not surprisingly violent thriller, but the
          BBC does better on a skimpy budget.  Rating: high
          +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     THE DEVIL'S OWN cost a reported $90-100 million to make.
Ordinarily that is of little interest to me as a viewer since I pay the
about the same ticket price to see it as to see a little inexpensive
independent film.  But it should be noted that this is not a subject
matter that requires a big budget.  Whatever was good in this film was
done far more intelligently but on a television budget in the British
made-for-TV thriller HARRY'S GAME (1982).  With the exception of bigger
(but not more realistic) action scenes THE DEVIL'S OWN offers little
that HARRY'S GAME did not.  (For all I know there may be other equally
good thrillers on this subject from the BBC that just never made it to
this country.  But I do notice that the previous Harrison Ford IRA-
related film, PATRIOT GAMES, borrowed the music of HARRY'S GAME in
apparent homage.)  Perhaps the real virtue of THE DEVIL'S OWN is a
moderately even-handed approach to the politics.  These days it seems
unusual to have a major action film which covers politics and which
does not make it obvious which side is right and which is wrong.
Leaving audiences to wonder about which side to be on in a conflict is
not generally thought to reflect well at the box-office.  It is only a
minor touch in THE DEVIL'S OWN that the story does not come right out
and take sides.  It is the most refreshing touch that it is left to the
viewer to decide.  Perhaps the writers, and there were at least four,
felt that pushing one point of view was not really crucial to tell the
story.</P>
<P>     At a young age Frankie McGuire (to be played as an adult by Brad
Pitt) saw his beloved father gunned down at the dinner table by masked
Protestants.  Two decades later Frankie is an IRA terrorist who has
killed more than twenty people and British Intelligence is trying
desperately to stop him.  Frankie's next project involves stinger
missiles and he has to go to New York to buy them with a large satchel
of money.  A sympathetic judge finds lodging for Frankie at the house
of honest cop Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford).  Tom, glad to have another
male in a house full of women, has no idea of who Frankie is or what he
is really doing.  The two men are each interested in the other's
country and culture, each surprised at what he discovers.  They begina
friendship that the viewer knows can only end only in violence.
Violence is key word and not all of it is over Northern Ireland
politics.  But the even-handedness in treating these conflicts even
extends to partially justifying a halfworld-ish bar owner and arms
dealer played by Treat Williams.  This is a film of many different
conflicts in which nobody is entirely right or wrong.</P>
<P>     This admittedly is a minority opinion, but Harrison Ford is not a
particularly expressive or charismatic actor.  In spite of his
popularity he has a limited acting range and does not project much
personality beyond weariness.  The same can be said of many other
actors, but few of his repute.  Pitt carries his role with a thick, at
times impenetrable Irish accent, that is reasonably convincing.  Their
friendship could easily devolve into a simple father-and-son
relationship, but it is more complex than that with Ford playing the
innocent compared to the generally more worldly and certainly more
experienced Pitt.  The cinematography by Gordon Willis creates mood by
matching the darkest moods of the characters with dark murky scenes in
Ulster and in New York.</P>
<P>     THE DEVIL'S OWN is more sophisticated and intelligent than most of
the action films in the theaters these days, but this expensive
production is still not up to what the BBC can do on a skittles and
beer budget.  There was little on the screen to justify the enormous
cost of the film.  Still, I rate THE DEVIL'S OWN a high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
