<PRE>                           BOOGIE NIGHTS 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               2 :-) :-)  for a study on the sex industry</PRE>
<P>Let's take a long hard deep look at the porn industry. Far removed from
the norm are these gods and goddesses of sex, who use their bodies as
tools to arouse the onlooker. They're movies show sirens lost in the
addictive sea of lust as they mingle and mix scents and issues. We hear
repeated throaty moans as they go over and over and over the mechanics
of love making like the pistons of a steam engine. Performing the erotic
dance with possessed twist and turns, seemingly lost in a depraved
embrace as if they didn't get enough of it. They are seemingly able to
reach greater heights of pleasure with each successive multiple orgasm.
Yeah, tell me about it!</P>
<P>So who are these titans of sex? A homeless boy (Mark Wahlberg) who
didn't get enough love from his mama proves himself to the world by
using his greatest asset – a big dick. A forlorn mother (Julianne Moore)
caught up with her ‘success' in the sex industry, makes up for her lost
child by mothering and f'king the homeless lad. Then there's
‘Rollergirl', a blonde bimbette school dropout well known for giving
good mouth, also gets mothered and f'kd. There are others, but in
particular the Godfather of this big f'king family, the director of the
movies himself (Burt Reynolds).</P>
<P>What makes this movie interesting, is that it shows us what life is like
behind these fantastic orgies. The lonely pain, the inner suffering, the
craving for love and acceptance, and the profound emptiness within. Add
to this poor self-esteem, psychological instability, alcohol and illicit
drug dependence and you have perfected an emotional wreck. It shows us
how easily young and homeless teens are led into the seemingly
‘glamorous' sex industry, tempted by its easy material gains. This is
followed by a vicious cycle of ups and downs caused by an industry that
chews up its stars quicker than a mouse can breed. Those who manage to
break the chain are the lucky ones, those who don't die young.</P>
<P>The actors who perform this study on the sex industry are marvellous.
Mark Wahlberg fills the shoes of the young, naïve boy who is transformed
by the sex industry with great sincerity. Julianne Moore shows us with
her performance that she has done her study by accurately portraying a
slut queen, but it is Burt Reynold's who excels and shines as the
business man porno king.</P>
<P>This is a well made, finely crafted, humorous study on the world of
pornography and is good resource material for anyone thinking about
becoming a counsellor for young people.</P>
