<P>Quirky, smart and extremely entertaining, "Out of Sight" establishes its 
tone right from the opening scene. Bank robber Jack Foley (George 
Clooney) ambles up to a teller and lays out the score with casually 
authoritative inflection. Gesturing towards a total stranger applying for 
a loan at a nearby desk, he quietly states that the man is his partner 
who, if instructions are not followed to the letter, will shoot the bank 
officer. As the trembling employee gathers the cash, Foley notices her 
near-panic and says, with genuine concern in his voice, "Your first time 
being robbed? Well, you're doing great." After calming the young woman 
and collecting his bounty, he strolls out to the parking lot under the 
sunny Florida sky to make his escape, only to discover that his car won't 
start. 30 seconds later, he's under arrest.</P>
<P>"Out of Sight" is the first film based on an Elmore Leonard novel that 
truly captures the author's unique style. "Get Shorty" was lively fun, 
but overly glib. While "Jackie Brown" was a thoughtful, exceptionally 
well done character study, the production suffered from a detached, logy 
feel. In the hands of "sex, lies & videotape" director Steven Soderbergh, 
"Out of Sight" delivers the goods, adroitly mixing romance, violence and 
humor without compromising its characters or oversimplifying the story. 
Leonard writes in nonjudgmental fashion about oddly endearing lowlifes. 
His characters are lovable losers who make us laugh precisely because 
they don't know how funny they are. Soderbergh understands all of that, 
which is why the film works so well.</P>
<P>The story follows Jack to prison, where he quickly plots his escape. Of 
course, the break-out doesn't go as planned, thanks to the unexpected 
appearance of federal marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). Jack's 
accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames), scrambling to protect his friend, stuffs 
Jack and Karen into a car trunk for the getaway run, and sparks fly 
between the pair. After Buddy and Jack release her and head for Detroit, 
planning the proverbial "one last scam," Karen aggressively pursues Jack, 
although it's obvious that she's not entirely sure what she'll do if she 
catches him. </P>
<P>While "Out of Sight" boasts a terrific cast, the spotlight rarely moves 
far from George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, who deliver knockout 
performances. Any doubts over whether Clooney can carry a film are 
removed here, as he deftly creates a charismatic, delightfully 
complicated scoundrel. Short sighted but fast on his feet, Jack presents 
himself with a beguiling assurance that never seems cocky. He's 
incredibly likable, even while doing awful things. Clooney looks good too,
 having finally ditched that silly Julius Caesar hairdo that was so 
trendy for a while, in favor of a swept back look befitting a movie star. </P>
<P>Speaking of movie stars, Jennifer Lopez becomes a full-fledged one here 
as well, with a breakthrough performance as the perceptive, sexy and very 
conflicted federal marshal. Make no mistake, Karen Sisco is an effective 
cop, but she keeps finding herself drawn to the wrong men. Early in the 
film, her father (an uncharacteristically tender Dennis Farina) gently 
offers counsel on her personal life, all the while knowing that his 
resolute daughter must find her own way, however often she may stumble. </P>
<P>And stumble she will, because this is an Elmore Leonard story, where the 
good guys are usually bad guys and everybody screws up. Sometimes they 
even realize the futility of their grandiose plans, although that never 
seems to slow them down. In one of the most telling scenes, Buddy talks 
about living the good life after they pull off their risky plan and Jack 
quietly says "You know anybody who has done the big score and gone on to 
live the good life?" </P>
<P>The characters in "Out of Sight" may be sad sacks, but boy, are they fun 
to watch. Along with the always wonderful Rhames and Farina, the film 
boasts a stellar supporting cast including Albert Brooks (as a Michael 
Milken type), Don Cheadle from "Boogie Nights," "That Thing You Do's" 
Steve Zahn, plus uncredited appearances from Michael Keaton, reprising 
his "Jackie Brown" role as FBI agent Ray Nicolet, and Samuel L. Jackson. 
Despite the large cast, every character is fully developed and their 
stories weave in and out, aided by a loping, low key jazz score that 
accents the film's non-linear flow. </P>
<P>It's all very complicated, but attentive viewers can easily keep up, and 
even if you do get lost, that's okay, because character is far more 
important than plot in "Out of Sight." The film has a number of intricate,
 beautifully staged set pieces, but even those dandy action scenes are 
character driven. The deliciously loopy "Out of Sight" takes a whacked 
look at the human condition, painting life as a series of misguided 
choices, a viewpoint that would be depressing if it wasn't so damned 
funny.</P>
