<P>     The first film from Dreamworks SKG-- you know, that studio from
those guys-- is, well, one, long chase scene.  Nicole Kidman and George
Clooney go through the requisite motions as a pair of nuclear weapons
experts, trotting the globe in search of stolen Russian warheads, one of
which ends up in a Bosnian backpack, bound for the Big Apple.  Kidman,
as a brunette (!) and looking all of 23 years old, plays the presiden-
tial adviser who's in charge, while Clooney bobs along as a Special
Forces officer who pretends she isn't.  And while neither delivers the
star performance that's expected, they do have enough chemistry to keep
their scenes interesting.  (Just ignore their idiotic repartee at the
outset.  Once people begin to die around them, they shut up and get ser-
ious.  And, believe it or not, actually grieve.)</P>
<P>     More importantly, both are able to stay in step with director Mimi
Leder's relentlessly brisk pacing.  This is a movie that *moves*, man,
and isn't afraid to sacrifice such trivialities as character develop-
ment, plot complexity, or humor.  (The grim business of counter-terror-
ism is periodically lightened-- a "Baywatch" joke here, an American
Online gag there.)  At least the action is terrific.  Four superbly
staged sequences are the real reasons to plop down $6.50:  the nighttime
hijacking of a moving choo choo, a car chase/demolition derby/Mercedes
Benz product plug, a helicopter attack on a truckload of bad guys, and,
the grand finale, where every available agency converges on a handful of
Manhattan city blocks during rush hour.  It's chaos of the finest order,
marred only by a Dreaded Flashback to the villain's past.  And, of
course, the LOL realization that the bomb's ten-minute timer has been
ticking for, oh, at least twenty minutes.  Heh.</P>
