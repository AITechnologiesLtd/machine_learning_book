<PRE>                              BURNT BY THE SUN
                       A film review by Fred Kreisel
                       Copyright 1995 Iskra Research</PRE>
<PRE>Stalinism Revisited</PRE>
<PRE>     There is a new Russian film playing now in the US, and it is a
must-see!</PRE>
<P>     This 1995 feature film took a number of prizes at the Cannes Film
Festival, and deservedly so.  Nikota Mikhalkov both directed and
starred in it in the role of Sergei Kotov, a Red Army officer, hero of
the Civil War and a pillar of the Soviet regime.</P>
<P>     What starts as a languorous and idyllic story describes one day in
the life of a privileged family in the new Soviet Russia on a lazy
Sunday in the summer of 1936, just weeks before the first of the
infamous Moscow Trials broke on a stunned world.  The sense of imminent
danger is palpable throughout this gripping film.</P>
<P>     Realism of this film is developed on various levels.  Firstly,
Mikhalkov uses vivid summer colors and a typical rural location to
bring the viewer into the midst of a July countryside somewhere near
Moscow.  Secondly, the skilled use of choice actors: tender and
talented portrayal of Kotov's six-year-old girl by Mikhalkov's own
daughter, the sensuous elegance of the beautiful Ingeborga Dapkunaite
as Kotov's wife, the nervous energy of Oleg Menshikov as the intruding
antagonist, and so on.  Thirdly, there is the masterful counterposition
of quick action and peaceful periods of weekend rest.</P>
<P>     Finally, there is the shocking reality of the Purges themselves,
totally unprecedented in world history.  From mid-1936 until 1939
Stalin wiped out the vast majority of the top echelons of the Soviet
regime: most of the top commanders of the Red Army, the majority of
the leaders of the Bolshevik Party during its heroic period of struggle
for power, the leading engineers, designers and scientists, outstanding
writers, artists, film and theatre directors, and so on.</P>
<P>     Stalin's assistants in this counterrevolutionary terror directed
against the organizers of Bolshevik victory and the builders of the
Soviet state were in many cases individuals who resisted the October
Revolution in 1917 or who stayed on the sidelines.  Stalin's chief
prosecutor at the Trials was Andrei Vyshinsky, a former Menshevik
leader.  Among the chief torturers of the NKVD was Lavrentii Beria,
known to all the Caucasian revolutionaries as a tzarist agent
provocateur; two of the chief stage managers of the show trials were
Henrik Yagoda and Nikolai Yezhov, unknown during the Revolution and the
Civil War, but promoted by Stalin in the fight against Trotsky and the
Left Opposition.</P>
<P>     Mikhalkov reaches towards an understanding of the reactionary aims
of Stalinist purges.  His protagonist Kotov begins to see the class
basis for this genocide of the true revolutionaries at the hands of the
power hungry bureaucrats and the former White Guards.  However, the
director's power of penetration is limited by the confusion and
disorientation still prevailing in Russia.  We hope that this film
marks a new step in the search for the truth about the history of the
Revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky, and the Stalinist
counterrevolution which followed.</P>
