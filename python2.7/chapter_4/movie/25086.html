<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P><i>Note: While this review does not have spoilers, I
do discuss much of the film's plot. I suggest that
those who like to enter a film with an open mind view
the film before reading this review. However, reading
this review will not spoil the film.</i></P>
<P>That the sun rises daily is itself a miracle, one of
many that most people take for granted. As many
viewers inferred from the recent `American Beauty',
life is only worth living when one can take time to
appreciate the small things, like the miracle of
sunshine. Istvan Szabo's `Sunshine' is a film that
earns the cliché `an epic of intimate proportions,'
because it is a big, bold, sweeping three-hour triumph
that is, at heart, about the smaller things in life,
and the ways in which these things shape our destiny. </P>
<P>`Sunshine' is a film of dazzling richness; the fully
developed story of 3 pivotal generations in the
Sonnenschein (which translates as `sunshine') family
of 20th century Hungary. Szabo's vision is ambitious,
as he tries to tell the story of a century, a country,
a family and their plight for assimilation in a world
that may not accept them for what they are. The
Sonnenschein family is Jewish, and one of the film's
major themes involves the way in which the family
slowly breaks away from their ancient heritage. </P>
<P>Ralph Fiennes ambitiously and successfully plays three
members of the Sonnenschein family in different time
periods. The family patriarch is Emmanuel (David de
Keyser), who, in the late 1800's, creates a successful
business by peddling the family treasure, `Sunshine
Tonic'. He marries the temperamental Rose (Miriam
Margolyes) and raises two daringly different young
boys, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James
Frain), and his orphaned niece, Valerie (Jennifer
Ehle). </P>
<P>As young adults, Ignatz, a government official who
fervently supports the Emperor, and Valerie, a
beautiful photographer, begin a forbidden, incestuous
affair. Gustave, a wild Communist revolutionary,
disapproves of his brother's actions, both politically
and sexually. According to the film's press notes, the
Germans and Jews were each highly assimilated, and did
not regard themselves as a separate group. Therefore,
it is all the more disconcerting that in order to
become a judge, Ignatz must, with his siblings, change
the family name to the Hungarian-sounding Sors. When
telling her parents of the name change, Valerie
promises to never abandon her Jewish faith. Easy for
her to say… </P>
<P>At the beginning of the twentieth century, Adam Sors
(Ralph Fiennes, in his second role), the younger son
of Ignatz and Valerie, emerges as a world-class
fencer. Taught by his brother Istvan (Mark Strong),
Adam becomes the top fencer in his club, and aims to
be an Olympian. However, times being the way they are,
Adam has little chance of fulfilling his goals if he
continues as a Jew. Because his life's motivation is
to succeed as an athlete, he converts to Catholicism,
breaking ties with his family's strong Jewish
background. At the conversion, he meets Hannah (Molly
Parker), a woman who is also desperately trying to fit
in to the ever-changing society. Adam becomes an
Olympian, winning the gold for his country. But even
that cannot shield him from the upcoming war, and its
effects. </P>
<P>The first 120 minutes of `Sunshine' is some of the
best filmmaking I have seen this century, combining
remarkable, intricate elements of romance and
political intrigue that blend together seamlessly. But
the third act, the story of Ivan Sors, who turns to
Communism in order to avenge the gruesome effects of
the Holocaust (which are shown in one particularly
wrenching scene), is noticeably weak (until the final
minutes, in which Szabo's vision becomes clear). </P>
<P>`Sunshine' is remarkable because director Istvan Szabo
uses the powers of cinema to their fullest extent. The
film is a welcome reminder of how any filmmaker with a
strong vision can tell a compelling story under the
constraints of a low budget. `Sunshine' pays close
attention to period detail, transporting the viewer
through the twentieth century with keen
characterizations that pack a real punch. </P>
<P>Flawed as it is, `Sunshine' is a life-affirming tale
of family ties; grandly intimate filmmaking that can
only be categorized as `epic'. A unique combination of
flamboyance and detail, featuring a dazzling display
of acting prowess by the incomparable Ralph Fiennes,
Istvan Szabo's `Sunshine' is a film event not to be
missed. </P>
