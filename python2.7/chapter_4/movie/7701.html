<PRE>                                FATHER'S DAY
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This film has just about everything going for it. Writers Lowell Ganz
and Babaloo Mandel are responsible for two of the wittiest comedies of
recent years:  "City Slickers" and "Parenthood". Producer/director Ivan
Reitman has "Ghostbusters" to his credit. Some of the supporting cast
are well respected (Nastassja Kinski, Julia Louis-Dreyfus of "Seinfeld"
fame). It's a nice touch that a film entitled "Father's Day" is released
on Mother's Day weekend.</P>
<P>But the real reason that it looks great is the inspired teaming of Robin
Williams and Billy Crystal, two of the top comedic actors working today.
You can easily imagine them bouncing off of each other with quips and ad
libs and movie-goers want to get in on some of the fun. The scene in the
previews where Crystal is trying to explain who Lou Gehrig is ("The guy
who died of Lou Gehrig's Disease." "Wow! What are the odds of that?") is
inspired.</P>
<PRE>Prepare for a major disappointment.</PRE>
<P>Based on the 1984 French "Les Comperes", the movie is an odd couple
buddy road trip film. Happily married Collette (Kinski) is disparate to
find her runaway 16 year old son. Being a friendly sort 17 years ago,
she knew both Jack (Crystal) and Dale (Williams) in the Biblical sense.
Calling and telling each of them that they are the father of her son,
she begs them to find him.</P>
<P>Of course both of the fathers accidentally discover the other and pair
up to find missing Scott (Charlie Hofheimer). Their journey takes them
from a tough auto repair shop to a tough rock tour via encounters with
tough drug dealers.</P>
<P>Jack is a sophisticated LA lawyer with a talent for head-butting. Dale,
a San Francisco poet with a history of suicide attempts, bursts into
tears at the slightest provocation. Both actors are perfectly suited to
their roles and pull them off with style.</P>
<P>It just doesn't work. The story is old hat. Most of the shticks have
been done before and often. The middle-aged man at a rock concert was
funnier on the "Simpsons". With a few exceptions, the jokes fall flat on
their faces even though Crystal and Williams do their best to grab them
out of the muck.</P>
<P>Part of the problem is that Hofheimer is remarkably uninspiring as the
16-year-old with too many hormones and too little money. Kinski is
adequate but nothing special as she exhibits none of the steaming
sexuality that has always been her forte and could have been used in a
role that is defined by her irresistibility. Louis-Dreyfus does better
with Jerry, George and Kramer or perhaps she needs a project with
genuinely humorous moments.</P>
<P>Crystal and Williams __must__ have been a hoot on the set, but
unfortunately there's not much evidence of that on the screen. There are
a few times where their chemistry shows through the mess and those
meager minutes are what saves the film from being a total waste of time.
The hotel shower scene is occasionally hilarious, but you've seen it
before. I get the feeling that the better movie was left on the cutting
room floor as outtakes.</P>
<P>If this were ranked on a "Living Up To Potential" scale, it would rate a
Zero. </P>
