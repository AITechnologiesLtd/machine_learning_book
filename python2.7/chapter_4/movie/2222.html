<PRE>                         THE MYTH OF THE MALE ORGASM
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Bruce Dinsmore, Miranda De Pencier, Mark Camacho, Burke
Lawrence, Ruth Marshall, Macha Grenon.
Screenplay:  John Hamilton and David Reckziegel.
Director:  John Hamilton.</P>
<P>     THE MYTH OF THE MALE ORGASM is the story of Jimmy Ravinsky (Bruce
Dinsmore), a single young psychology professor who convinces his two
housemates, lovable loser Tim (Mark Camacho) and inveterate womanizer
Sean (Burke Lawrence), to join him in participating in a feminist
studies experiment at his college.  The subject of the experiment:
male attitudes about women, sex and relationships.  Only Jimmy returns
after his initial session, however, beginning a spirited exchange with
his anonymous interrogator "Jane Doe" (Miranda De Pencier).  The film
examines Jimmy's many relationships, including those with platonic
woman friend Mimi (Ruth Marshall) and narcissistic ex-lover Paula
(Macha Grenon), and how his encounters with Jane Doe changes them
both.</P>
<P>     I'm tempted to refer to MYTH as WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... without
the star power, but that wouldn't be entirely fair to this Canadian
battle-of-the-sexes comedy.  True, it covers some familiar territory in
the realm of contemporary sexual politics, but it adds enough twists
and fresh characters to stay interesting.  Tim is a hapless schlub who
pays lip service to enjoying "just friend"-ships with women while
suffering through a prolonged stretch without a sexual relationship;
Paula is a real rhymes-with-witch who insists on reminding Jimmy of why
their relationship failed.  Then there is MYTH's biggest asset, the
appealing and multi-layered character of Jimmy, winningly played by
Bruce Dinsmore.  Jimmy is truly intriguing, a man indignant about how
poorly other men treat women while apparently unaware of who much more
similar than different he is.  More to the point, he's someone who
thinks he's figured out everyone else but doesn't have the first clue
about himself.  Dinsmore does a fine job with Jimmy, combining charm,
arrogance, intelligence and uncertainty into a coherent character.
He's especially good in his scenes with women, strongest of all in a
restaurant scene with Paula (Grenon is the other strong point in the
cast).  The scenes with his male friends rang somewhat false, thanks
largely to a performance by Burke Lawrence that begins and ends as a
swaggering caricature.  Fortunately, these scenes are infrequent and
less critical, allowing Dinsmore to shine where he's needed most.</P>
<P>     The larger flaw in MYTH is an excessively stagy quality, as though
it had been intended originally as a play.  Many scenes, particularly
those involving the conversations between Jimmy and Jane, are a bit
claustrophobic, and even the lighting design suggests stage roots.  The
script often lays it on rather thick, using speeches to get points
across with little subtlety, sometimes the same point more than once.
But to its credit, THE MYTH OF THE MALE ORGASM plays fair with both
sexes' attitudes, avoiding a "women good, men bad" level of
simplicity.  Both Jimmy and Jane learn something, and the film's most
appealing message may be the need to get past assumptions and
generalizations in the formation of honest relationships.  The broad,
theatrical acting styles and blatant politics may not be for every
taste, but I found THE MYTH OF THE MALE ORGASM to be a clever and
occasionally insightful take on the collision of changing roles with
centuries-old perceptions.</P>
