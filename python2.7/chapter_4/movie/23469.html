<P>Another devil movie?!? Well, not really. Sure this film is centered around a
man's search for ancient satanic books, but unlike STIGMATA which took the
MTV route or END OF DAYS, which took Arnie and dove head-first into thrill
mode, this film relies entirely on its mood, its haunting score, its
carefully laid out clues and its leading man to keep your interest. Think
EYES WIDE SHUT meeting ANGEL HEART.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An unscrupulous book appraiser is hired by an eccentric collector to find
and authenticate the two other copies of the "Book of the Nine Gates", a
tome which apparently holds the key to conjuring up the devil. It isn't long
before the book sleuth finds himself caught up in a mysterious game of cat
and mouse.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Creepy, atmospheric, slow-moving mystery which drew me in with its awesome
opening credit sequence, kept me interested with its dark, moody look and
sound, and stapled my final approval with an unpredictable resolution worthy
of a second trip to the theatres. But let's talk real turkey here...Johnny
Depp pots yet another great role and takes full advantage of his
ever-expanding talent to present us with yet another unique and engaging
performance. This man is totally on top of his game right now (besides being
a great-looking individual!) and seriously has me looking forward to any of
his future roles. Harumph...but back to the review. This movie is definitely
not for your typical thrill-a-minute popcorn crowd. No way! In fact, its
mandate doesn't really include thrills as much as it does the creation of
feelings of uneasiness. I don't know if it was just me, the film's brooding
cinematography, its eerily seductive soundtrack or the general Euro-feel of
the entire movie, but this one definitely had me by the balls the whole way
through.</P>
<P>Of course, it's really more of a mystery film than anything else. A thinking
man's (or woman's) movie, if you will. No easy answers. No
wham-bam-thank-you ma'ams. Just a lot of subtle hints here and there,
something said, something shown, a person seen before...definitely a film
which asks its audience to pay attention and appreciate its drawn out
nature. And drawn out it is. The one thing I would have liked was if they
had cut it down a little, it felt like it ran on a little near the end. But
then again, once the final resolution revealed itself, I can't say that I
held much else against the film. Having said that, it is to note that the
ending is actually quite vague and surely in need of further discussion or
re-examination in order to fully appreciate its meaning. I mixed and matched
some of my ideas with that of my friend, and within a few minutes, we had
already uncovered several interesting theories to complete the puzzle.
Ironically, it is the film's ambiguity that left me further intrigued to
watch it all over again. Of course, I won't deny that its unclear ending,
peculiar pace and sheer length won't easily turn many people off, because I
am sure that they will, but for me personally, the film worked on several
levels, with the most important one being that of entertainment.</P>
<P>I really liked this film. Johnny Depp is always interesting to watch, the
plot has basically been seen before but not with all of its subtleties, the
score is Hitchcockian and flawlessly intertwined with the film's dark,
stylish look and best of all, the ending keeps your brain working even after
the final reel clicks the end. Don't expect action, don't expect many
thrills, don't expect Arnie with a machine gun. This is a simple mystery
film mangled in the supernatural with zero special effects and a lot of
depth. Interested?</P>
