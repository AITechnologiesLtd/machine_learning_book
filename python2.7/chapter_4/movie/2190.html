<P>       Somewhere between big-budget action films and small-budget
morality tales exists JUDGEMENT NIGHT, a constantly exciting, always
tense urban thriller about kids on the run.  And no matter how you feel
about foot-chase movies, or shoot-out movies (or even movies that
seldom show you the light of day), *this* movie is never less than
engaging at any time.</P>
<P>       We first meet Frank Wyatt, a family man whose wife thinks he
should stop hanging out with the guys who "have the hormones of
teenagers" and start being around adults more.  But Frank hasn't been
out of the house in a long while and he thinks he needs a breather.
So, he tells his wife he loves her, kisses his baby's head (just like
any devoted father and husband should), and is off with his best
friends for a night out.</P>
<P>       Next, are Mike, Ray, and Frank's brother (whom he never, ever
gets along with) John.  They all congregate in a van/bus, and are off
to watch boxing in downtown Chicago.  Wouldn't you know, traffic's too
damn slow, and Ray decides to get off the main highway for a short
detour.  And wouldn't you know, they find themselves in a part of town
none of them has ever seen before.  Ray is determined to get them to
the boxing match on time, but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some
guy on the run from bad guys.</P>
<P>       The guys try to help out this stranger they've nearly killed,
but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange
man.  Enter Fallon (played by Denis Leary), a drug
kingpin/mobster/whatever who pulls a gun and murders the man in cold
blood.  "Rule number one:  Do not steal from me," Fallon states to his
band of henchmen.  "Rule number two, no witnesses."</P>
<P>       And so it goes, as this action-adventure is set into nonstop
motion.  Given the amount of time this film in on the screen, and the
number of long encounters which take place, not much time is allowed
for much character development.  So, there isn't any (except if you
count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when it's too late).
Then again, developing characters who provide the grounds for a story
that just about leaves you breathless, and nothing more, would be a
waste of time, especially when the action is as good as it is here.  We
get fights in the sewers, on and off trains, in low-rent apartment
buildings, and even (the finale) in a small shopping mall downtown.
And each sequence has a distinct feel to it, and each is inventive
enough to make you feel as though you haven't seen any of this before.</P>
<P>       The script, by Lewis Colick, is extremely derivative in its ways
of executing action and suspense, and the score, by Alan Silvestri,
(when it can be heard through all the fantastic rap music) sets a nice
tone for what you see.  Director Stephen Hopkins, of PREDATOR II fame,
does what he couldn't do in that film with this one:  Make it credible
enough for us to want to continue watching.  True, this isn't a
classical piece of cinema, but it does just what it needs to:  Stay on
the screen as long as it needs to be there (no longer, and no less),
and excite us while we watch.</P>
<PRE>CRITICAL RATING:  ***
Rated R, for Violence and Profanity...</PRE>
