<PRE>Nothing To Lose
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1887 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Successful LA advertising executive Nick Beam (Tim Robbins) has lost the most
important thing in his life. Upon a surprise early visit home, he discovers
his wife in bed with his boss. In shock, he drives aimlessly.</P>
<P>In an undesirable section of the city, carjacker "T" (Martin Lawrence) jumps
into the passenger's seat and demands his wallet and keys. Beam explains
"You've picked the wrong person on the wrong day," and heads out into the
Arizona desert with T, a captive.</P>
<P>As you might expect in this salt and pepper comedy, the two become good
buddies and go on a crime spree. It turns out the T is highly skilled but
can't get a job because he has no legitimate experience and has to support his
family somehow. Hatching a plot to get revenge on his boss, the two plan a big
buck heist.</P>
<P>Occasionally there are bits that are almost humorous, but they seem played
wrong. The timing is off, the delivery is off and the story is just plain
stupid. Every plot turn is telegraphed long in advance. The team steals
flashlights to use in their robbery. Quiet and stealth are of the utmost
importance in the operation. The flashlights have built-in radios. Can you see
it coming?</P>
<P>The worst give-away has to do with the pivotal scene that changes Beam's life.
Anyone who pays the least attention to the events before he walks in on his
wife's indiscretion can see what's coming an hour later.</P>
<P>Robbins does a credible job with a very limited role and Lawrence adds some
spice to the film although neither are very funny. This seems a fatal mistake
in what is supposed to be a comedy.</P>
<P>With very few exceptions, the audience will discover that in "Nothing To
Lose", there is really nothing to gain.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman, after over 21 years of writing this column, is currently
holed up in an air-conditioned room making only rare sojourns out into the
sweltering day. <A HREF="mailto:mredman@bvoice.com">mredman@bvoice.com</A> are the magical letters.)</P>
