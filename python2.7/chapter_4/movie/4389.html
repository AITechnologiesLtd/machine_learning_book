                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(*** out of four)</PRE>
<P>     If you've ever perused my college comedy diary "Another 
Year in the Life of a Nerd" (I never run out of cheap plugs), you know 
I didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well.  In fact, 
during the three-week period between Thanksgiving and Christmas 
Break, I said a total of four sentences to him.</P>
<P>     So when I saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie 
called ROOMMATES, I envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a 
couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room.  
Then I saw that the star of ROOMMATES is Peter Falk.  Scratch that 
idea.  But I still say someone should film the story of two college 
roommates whose relationship is less than ideal. Of course, in my case 
it would be a silent picture.</P>
<P>     Even without the college element, I still decided to watch 
ROOMMATES because I had absolutely nothing to do, unless you 
count studying for final exams (And who does?).  I'm glad I did.  Peter 
Falk's performance was actually what made the movie.  And this is a 
guy I never considered a real actor, more like someone who went 
around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries.  Falk pleasantly 
surprised me here, permanently earning my respect, so all you 
"Columbo" fans who think I live to insult the guy can just falk off.</P>
<P>     Falk plays Rocky, a 107-year-old Polish baker who raises his 
grandson after both the kid's parents die.  The movie begins with the 
mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents.  After a 
couple stops along the son's journey to manhood, ROOMMATES 
progresses to the present day, with the grandson a surgeon and Rocky 
in a condemned house he refuses to leave.  The surgeon reluctantly 
offers the only possible solution -- Rocky will have to move into his 
place, the basement of a building rented by a group of Chinese 
students ("Communists!").</P>
<P>     The movie spans nine more years of Rocky's relationship with 
his grandson, and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls 
in love with--gasp--a woman, and starts spending all his time with her.  
So, in his grandson's absence, Rocky turns his pursuits to professional 
boxing, achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight 
with Apollo Creed...  Or am I confusing movie plots again?</P>
<P>     ROOMMATES has an almost epic feel to it, covering several 
generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die.  
Death, though, knocks at the door of almost every other major 
character in the the movie.  ROOMMATES has about as many 
casualties as the first Halloween.  The number can't be counted on one 
hand, unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic 
mutation.  And you can probably guess who says farewell to Planet 
Earth at the end of the movie (no, not Duran Duran).  I won't come out 
and say it.  Instead, I'll just sit here and hum "Eye of the Tiger" until 
each and every one of you figures it out.</P>
<P>     ROOMMATES plays on all the major emotions.  It knows 
when to make you laugh and when to make you cry.  Movies that can 
perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience, 
even though this one bombed at the theaters.  My point?  There are no 
absolutes.  Or, another possible point, Peter Falk just isn't such a great 
box office draw.  Either way, this is still a good movie and you should 
give it a chance like I did, whether you hate your roommate or not.</P>
