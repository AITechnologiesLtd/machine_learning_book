Runaway Bride (1999)</PRE>

<P>A lot's been said about the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard 
Gere, the actors reunited a decade after their hit Pretty Woman.  Garry 
Marshall returns as their director in Runaway Bride, a story that entertains 
and charms but falls just this side of the status of major romantic comedy.</P>
<P>Yes, the chemistry's there, and Marshall seems to have romantic formulas 
down to a science.  From the credit-less opening to the set decoration, the 
film is slick and fairly fast-paced.  The piece is two hours long and it 
fills all of these minutes pleasantly enough.  I think what is missing, 
though, is enough character development, especially of Ike Graham, Gere's 
character;  we don't know him quite enough to care enough.</P>
<P>We know that Graham is an acerbic columnist for USA Today, based in 
Manhattan.  His specialty seems to be busting the chops of the opposite sex. 
  (A running gag involves Graham's being rapped by newspaper-swinging old 
women.)  When he fails to check the facts given him by one drunken source, 
Ike gets fired.  It's oddly convenient that his editor is his "ex," Ellie 
(Rita Wilson).  She's now married to one of Ike's best friends, Fisher 
(Hector Elizondo, a fixture in Marshall movies).  So the legendary Ike 
Graham is out of work, the paper printing a retraction that appears to 
please the victim of  Ike's column, one Maggie Carpenter (Roberts).</P>
<P>What's the conceit here?  It's the Runaway Bride angle, the fact that Maggie 
has strode down the aisle and then skedaddled three times, leaving three men 
witless and wife-less.  Because she's stuck it to him, Ike decides to shadow 
Maggie for another story, this time a piece for GQ, and he drives the 90 or 
so miles down the coast to Hale, Maryland, where Maggie runs the family 
hardware store.  Of course Ike's new take on the situation is that she will 
run again, and it just happens that Maggie is engaged to a fourth guy, an 
extremely decent mountain climber and high school football coach named Bob 
(Christopher Meloni).  Maggie is not pleased to see Ike's invasion of her 
domain, and she strikes first in a unique scene that shows us Ike with a 
multi-colored head.</P>
<P>What's funny here is how Ike insinuates himself into Maggie's life.  He 
seems to beat Maggie to every destination her life carries her:  when she 
arrives home, Ike is already there talking with her father and grandmother 
about her; when she drives to an ex-fiance's garage, Ike is sitting in an 
old Volkswagen 'Thing" atop the hydraulic lift, a picture of a topless 
Maggie in his hands.  When Maggie reverses the role and begins to appear 
inside Ike's quarters when he arrives home, the conflict and comedy 
increase.  The remainder of the plot follows Ike as he follows Maggie.  
After a time the two form a rather improbably friendship, Maggie offering to 
let Ike interview her for a rather large fee (which she plans to spend on an 
extravagant wedding dress).  All the time the chemistry between the two is 
reacting more intensely.  At a luau that friend Peggy Flemming (Joan Cusack) 
throws for Maggie, Ike even defends Maggie when her friends go too far with 
the runaway bride jokes.</P>
<P>The film does a nice job with all this rising action, Ike's hunt for clues 
with which to assassinate Maggie's character, and Maggie's counteractions, 
subtly assisted by her friends.  A bit of flatness hits once the climax is 
over, though; the predictable premise of all romantic comedies comes across 
as simply a way to end the film - although it never reaches a high level of 
satisfaction.</P>
<P>Maybe we need to know more about Ike Graham.  From the outset he has to 
wrestle with the stereotype of being a shallow misogynist, a man hated by 
half the human race.  We know he's divorced from Ellie the editor.  We 
discover he's an aspiring novelist, a vocation his mother wanted for him, 
and indeed this is made more plausible by the books on his shelf (including 
Melville), and the ones he reads as he and Maggie go through the mini-scenes 
that show they are falling in love (Yeats, Poe).  But we know very little 
else.  After he arrives in Hale Ike rarely even uses his mini-recorded, and 
we never see him actually scribbling or word-processing anything resembling 
a piece for GQ, a publication never mentioned after Fisher brings it up.  
This doesn't surprise, as other subplots are not completed either, including 
one in which Walter, Maggie's father (Paul Dooley), is an alcoholic whose 
behavior only Maggie rather mildly objects to.</P>
<P>More characterization would let us like Ike more, even though Richard Gere 
does nice work handling his character.  Most of the focus is placed on 
Maggie - if Henry James were a screenwriter in the late twentieth-century, 
he would occupy himself with writing such character studies.  Maggie's 
psychology is filled in rather interestingly.  One part of her is compliant, 
Zelig-like, in that she likes her eggs cooked the very same way as the man 
she is currently engaged to  marry.  Another part is egotistical, 
attention-seeking.  But after all, she is independent and competent, her job 
as hardware expert taking her into the obscure realm of antique fixtures and 
restoration.  She even designs lamps fabricated from a funky selection of 
electrical components.  Roberts handles Maggie with comfort: she's much more 
mature than her character in Pretty Woman - though still not secure.  
Roberts is a good sport, too: at one point she grabs those lips of hers and 
imitates a duck-billed platypus!</P>
<P>As Peggy Flemming ("not the skater"), Joan Cusack is her normal excellent 
self.  She's a veteran, and one hopes that her future roles get more screen 
time.  Cusack has a manner both sincere and comical, and she has some 
delightful interaction with Roberts that suggest their characters go back to 
girlhood.</P>
<P>Maggie's hometown of Hale, Maryland plays a supporting role here too.  The 
screenwriters, Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, often compare it to 
Mayberry, and this portrayal largely succeeds.  The result is a place gently 
satirized by Ike as he whistles the theme song to the 'The Andy Griffith 
Show" as he jogs beside Maggie riding her old-fashioned bike.  It's also a 
place that looks absolutely charming on screen, streets cozily arranged, 
storefronts invitingly shot.  A place, in short, that exists in our 
collective memory, mythic and non-existent.  A familiar and down-home burg 
120 miles south-southwest of Manhattan.  You can hear Garry Marshall with 
his New York accent saying, "OK, everything nice!  Roll it!"  Actually, the 
contrast between Hale's sleepy streets and the Big Apple locales functions 
nicely.</P>
<P>Though it will not be included in the canon of major American romantic 
comedies, Runaway Bride is entertaining fare.  We saw the film in its second 
week of release, and it is better than the buzz said it would be.  The PG 
rating is very pleasing, too - we brought along our daughter without any 
problem of pre-screening.</P>
