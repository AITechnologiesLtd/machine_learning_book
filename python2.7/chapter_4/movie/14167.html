<PRE>54
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The 70s are a hot era in Hollywood right now.  54 is the latest film to
jump on the retro train.  This time, the infamously exclusive disco,
Studio 54, is the backdrop for yet another drama detailing the
soullessness of the disco age.</P>
<P>The central character of 54 is Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young
man who sees the exotic world of Studio 54 as his escape from his
pathetic life in New Jersey. Catching the eye of the Studio 54 owner,
Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), Shane soon finds himself with a job as a
busboy.  Night after night, he is able to catch glimpses of the rich and
famous, including his dream girl, soap star Julie Black (Neve Campbell).</P>
<P>Shane quickly strikes up a friendship with some other club employees, a
married couple Anita and Greg (Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer).  Anita is
only a hat check girl, but she dreams of being a disco diva, if only she
could get a break.  Greg is a busboy, with his eye on the best job at
Studio 54:  being a bartender, where you're a mini-celbrity and the
money, drugs and sex just keep rolling in.</P>
<P>Money, drugs and sex are the lifeblood of Studio 54 (the disco's most
prominent piece of decor is cocaine-related).  So much of flows
throughout the film that you just know there's going to be a big
denouement.  And when it comes, the moral message is awfully heavy
handed.  The entire climax of the film ends up being awkward and
unconvincing.</P>
<P>But at least the film delivers a message there, which is more than can
be said about the remainder of the film's half-dozen subplots.  They're
simply tossed into the film with no thought (or screen time) given to
any semblance of resolution. A few of the luckier subplots are tidied up
with a quick gloss-over narration, but in any case it's sloppy
filmmaking.</P>
<P>Ryan Phillippe is rather unremarkable as the film's centerpiece.  Of the
entire cast, only Mike Myers truly stands out.  And that is mostly due
to the fact that he displays a heretofore unknown range of talent with a
dramatic role.</P>
<P>For all its glitz, 54 paints the 70s as a rather boring era. Billed as
the party that never ends, in 54 it seems more like the party you just
can't wait to leave.  At least the soundtrack is interesting.</P>
