<PRE>"THE HORSE WHISPERER"
A Film Review by James Kendrick
*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Redford || Screenplay: Richard LaGravenese and Eric Roth (based
on the novel by Nicholas Evans) || Stars: Robert Redford (Tom Booker), Kristin
Scott Thomas (Annie MacLean), Scarlett Johansson (Grace MacLean), Sam Neill
(Robert MacLean), Dianne Wiest (Diane Booker), Chris Cooper (Frank Booker),
Cherry Jones (Liz Hammond) || MPAA Rating: PG-13</P>
<P>Robert Redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible, God-given
gifts, but are able to act like ordinary people. In "The Natural" (1984), he
played the fallen angelic character of Roy Hobbs, the baseball player who was
destined to be "the best there ever was," but still acted like a humble farm
boy. In "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), he was the most dangerous
shot in the West, yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly
good-looking charmer. Even in "Indecent Proposal" (1993), where he played a man
who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love, Redford was
still able to exude an aura of shy decency, especially when reciting a tale of
lost love.</P>
<P>In his latest film, "The Horse Whisperer," based on the best-selling novel by
Nicholas Evans, Redford again plays such a character. Redford also directed the
film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie
- I suppose the character of Tom Booker, a man who has the amazing gift of
understanding and somehow communicating with horses, was just too good to pass
up. Despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses
(a magazine article coins the phrase "horse whisperer" to describe his uncanny
talent), Booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear
is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life.</P>
<P>Booker's talents are taxed into service by Annie MacLean (Kristin Scott Thomas),
a New York magazine editor whose daughter, Grace (Scarlett Johansson), was
recently in a horrible accident. The accident, which is filmed with
gut-wrenching horror, happens when Grace and her best friend are out riding
horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills Grace's friend, severely wounds and
traumatizes Grace's horse, Pilgrim, and causes Grace to lose part of her right
leg.</P>
<P>Annie believes that if Pilgrim can be healed, Grace will be healed as well,
which leads her to Booker. At first, she tries to get Booker to come to New York
to see the horse, but that doesn't work. Instead, she packs up Grace and
Pilgrim, leaves her husband, Robert (Sam Neill) behind, and heads for the
rolling hills of Montana where Booker runs a ranch with his brother, Frank
(Chris Cooper), and his sister-in-law, Diane (Dianne Wiest).</P>
<P>In many ways, the film is like a journey, both literally and symbolically. The
move out West has always been a great American tradition of renewal, and it's
hard not to see Annie and Grace's leaving Manhattan for Montana as a variation
on the classic theme of city vs. country. In "The Horse Whisperer," country is
clearly the victor. The city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness,
and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of Montana
that Grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to
dissipate, Annie's controlling nature begins to relax, and Pilgrim once again
learns to trust people.</P>
<P>Redford is just as in love with the grand Montana country in this film as he was
when he directed "A River Runs Through It" six years ago. In many ways, "The
Horse Whisperer" comes from the same poetic vein as "River," and the movie could
probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if Redford had decided to spend less
camera-time on the grass and mountains. But then, that would ruin the magic.</P>
<P>Much of the film's photography is truly elegant, and it creates a palpable sense
of the sheer expansiveness of the land. To further emphasize this, Redford and
cinematographer Robert Richardson ("Natural Born Killers," "Platoon") cheated a
bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in New York - with
mostly cold, harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1.85:1 aspect ratio; when
the action shifts to Montana, Richardson switches to soft-focus and natural
lighting, and the screen widens to a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.</P>
<P>In terms of the story itself, "The Horse Whisperer" gives us the same
romanticized view of adultery found in  David Lean's "A Brief Encounter" (1945)
and Clint Eastwood's 1995 adaptation of Robert James Waller's "The Bridges of
Madison County" (Richard LaGravenese, co-screenwriter here also adapted
"Bridges"). Although "The Horse Whisperer" has a strong romantic sensibility, I
still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story. It seems to me
that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for
this brief, heart-sweeping affair, but there rarely is.</P>
<P>In "The Horse Whisperer," the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband
falls to Sam Neill. He plays the character as a decent, hard-working man who is
a good husband and father; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than
she loves him. He is at risk of losing Annie to Booker not because he did
anything to drive her away, but simply because he happens to be a normal, fairly
uninspiring man.</P>
<P>There is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about
each character. It shows Booker and Robert going into a horse pen - Booker is
dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all, while Robert looks somewhat
frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap. As they enter the pen, Booker
assuredly swings over the fence, while Robert hesitates, then opens the gate
and, in a goofy moment, forgets to close it behind him. It's a small scene, but
it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the Booker character for
his romantic roughness. After all, Booker represents everything good about the
city while Robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it.</P>
<P>The best scenes in "The Horse Whisperer" tend to involve not the building
romance between Booker and Annie, but rather the healing process of Grace and
her horse. Although Booker's horse-training methods are mythical and
unrealistic, the scenes with him and Pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing. These
are paralleled by the scenes between him and Grace, some of which are humorous,
and all of which are tender and true. At some point, I wished the movie would
drop the whole romance angle and focus on Grace more.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Redford is obviously a romantic at heart, and he brings a light
touch to the erotic moments in the film. There are no dramatic sex scenes, but
there is a moving scene when he and Scott Thomas are slow-dancing, always moving
ever closer together, that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies
grinding together. Although the movie is longer than it should be and is
essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that
guarantees unhappiness for just about every character, there are enough moments
like that which make "The Horse Whisperer" worth the price of admission.</P>
