<P>Have you ever found yourself watching a movie that you know you're
"supposed" to like, but it just fails to grab you like you thought it
would?</P>
<PRE>Happens to me all the time lately.</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is stuck somewhere between Wonderland
and Oz.</P>
<P>A stone soap opera junkie living and breathing the serial "A Reason To
Live", waitress Betty is unable to cope with reality when she sees her
rotten car salesman husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) scalped by wired hitman
Wesley (Chris Rock) and his much more Zen accomplice, Charlie (Morgan
Freeman).  So Betty creates her own reality: her mind convinces her that
she is the ex-fiancee of Dr. David Ravell, a fictional soap opera
character played by George McCord (played by Greg Kinnear).  Betty so
believes she is destined to be with Dr. David - remember, the fictional
soap opera character played by a fictional actor played by a real [I
suppose] actor - that she takes off from Neverneverland, Kansas, to
pursue her dream man, much to the dismay of local yokel Sheriff Ballard
(Pruitt Taylor Vince) and reporter Roy (Crispin Glover), who wonder just
how involved Betty was in Del's death.</P>
<P>And following Betty in hot pursuit are Wesley and Charlie, who want
something Betty may not know she has...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
All the signs were there.  I should've loved this movie.  It's my kind
of flick: weird in a RAISING ARIZONA kinda way, filled with great
acting, and one that avoided the easy out of making the local yokels
look butt-dumb (as witnessed by Charlie's opening conversation with
Del).  With all of that going for it, you might think I'd be tickled
pink after watching NURSE BETTY.  I wasn't.</P>
<P>To be sure, it had its good points.  Through "Betty", I gained a whole
new level of respect for Renee Zellweger.  Rarely has an actor been more
perfectly cast; she had Space Cadet down.  I've loathed Zellweger in
previous movies [THE BACHELOR especially, though I can't blame her
entirely for ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE.  There's more than enough blame to
go around for that one], but she shined brightly as Betty in "Betty".
Equally good was Morgan Freeman, though I always have to contend with
the fact that he reminds me of my mama's preacher, Rev. Isaac [except
for the cussin'.  By Mr. Freeman, not Rev. Isaac.  uh...] when I watch
Freeman on screen.  Still, Freeman is always a joy to watch; he classes
up the joint in most every movie he's in.</P>
<P>The balance of the surrounding, supporting cast also defies my
relatively low-rating of "Betty".  Rarely have I enjoyed most of the
supporters of a main story the way I did in this movie; from Greg
Kinnear's surprisingly light touch with David/George (more of a
sarcastic actor in his previous turns, Kinnear's performance here might
go unfairly unnoticed.  Bammer sez notice it) to Crispin Glover's (for
once) not-over-the-top Roy, to Tia Texada's out-of-the-blue-friend Rosa,
to Harriet Sansom Harris as Ellen the world-weary bartender (hard to
believe she plays Bebe on NBC's FRASIER, eh?), the people living in
Betty's Neighborhood were a fun bunch o' folks.</P>
<P>With all that, why'd I give NURSE BETTY the cautionary flashing
yellowlight?  It's simple, really, having had a little something to do
with the nosebleed my Disbelief got from having to be Suspended for far
too long at far too great a height.  The aforementioned RAISING ARIZONA
was farce at its finest, and though it did stretch the imagination, I
could easily see its situations play themselves out.  But never, not for
one second, did I even *begin* to believe that Charlie, Zen hitman
though he might have been, would go gaga for Betty the way he did.
That, combined with "Betty"'s lack of a strong voice on either side of
the comedy scale - it wasn't broad enough to be good farce, nor dark
enough to be a great black comedy - diminished my enjoyment of the tale.</P>
<P>And once my Disbelief got an altitude migraine, that was all she wrote.
Everything went downhill from there.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I started to not even included the BF here; after all, NURSE BETTY never
directly dealt with it (much to its credit, says I), so...why me, why
here, why now?  Alas, it has more to do with what I read about the movie
before it came out, than the movie itself.</P>
<P>I received a forwarded email message from one of 3BC's readers that
described the characters of Wesley and Charlie as "drug dealers" instead
of the hitmen they clearly portray in this movie.  While on the one
hand, I probably shouldn't trip over such things, and on the other a
thug is a thug is a thug, I got my Dander up over the description.
After all, the Hitman Profession is a time-honored calling in Show
Bidness (witness THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, THE SOPRANOS, et al) - but
nobody loves a drug dealer (NEW JACK CITY), eh?  Well, maybe except for
an older White British female drug dealer (SAVING GRACE).  Hmmm...</P>
<P>Took a while for my Dander to recover from that little faux pas, it did.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Not for nuthin', but the Governor of the Great State Of Michigan -
Republican stalwart John Engler - was in my NURSE BETTY audience
yesterday.  I wonder what Gov. Engler thinks of a comedy in which two
Black guys scalp a White guy, wax philosophic about the honorable nature
of murder, and almost come out as sympathetic characters.</P>
<P>But I should leave him alone: after all, stalwart Republican Governors
deserve a night on the town, too - even if it is to enjoy depictions of
the Hollywood Violence they claim to detest.  Hmmm...</P>
<P>NURSE BETTY (rating: flashing yellowlight):
This flick could've stood a transfusion of Wacky Hilarity, or Dark
Pathos.  The middling ground it seemed content to stand on, was its
ultimate undoing.</P>
