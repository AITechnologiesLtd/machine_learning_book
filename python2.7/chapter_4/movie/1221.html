<PRE>                             RHAPSODY IN AUGUST
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     RHAPSODY IN AUGUST is a Japanese-language film by Akira Kurosawa.
It stars Sachiko Murase, Hisashi Igawa, Richard Gere.  It is written by
Kurosawa, based on the novel "Nabe-no-Naka" by Kiyoko Murata.  English
subtitles.  Rated PG for mature themes.</P>
<P>     Akira Kurosawa at 81 is establishing his career in a vigorous and
creative old age, like the Japanese painter whose artist's name became
"Old Man Mad About Painting."  Last year a lot of us went to KUROSAWA'S
DREAMS, thinking it would be sensei's last hurrah.  Fortunately, we
youngsters were wrong again.</P>
<P>     RHAPSODY is about the way humans forget about painful memories and
the importance of remembering and conquering that pain.  Pain in this
case is in the form of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, as remembered by
an old woman Kane (Sachiko Murase) and as discovered by her children and
grandchildren.</P>
<P>     The grandchildren are the narrative focus of the film.  They are
stuck with spending the summer at an old-fashioned farm over the
mountain from Nagasaki.  Granny's been invited to take them to Hawaii to
meet the American branch of the family, including Richard Gere (the
first American to be cast in a Kurosawa film).  She refuses because her
husband died that day 9 August 1945.  On a shopping trip to Nagasaki,
the kids in their American t-shirts discover memorials to the bomb and
its victims.  For the first time, the horror of that day comes home to
them.  Kane's children treat the story as bad manners that might offend
their new, rich American connections.  Gere flies to Japan to apologize,
not for the bomb, but for not ever thinking about how his uncle might
have died, no never thinking about it.</P>
<P>     The scene between Gere and the grandmother is only one of many
wondrous moments in this film.  His performance, which occupies less
than a third of the film, is warm, effortless, mostly in Japanese.
Indeed, sensei himself says the film is about human warmth, feelings,
kindness.  And I would add justice.  In the end, Kane has committed a
unkindness herself and the final scene of her expiation is remarkable
for its visual quality and for the audacious sound track that
accompanies it.</P>
<P>     Murase as Kane is the soul and emotional and moral center of the
movie.  Her frail tiny body, with its beautiful face like a mask, burns
with a fiery fear and compassion.  That final scene, unforgettable as it
is, is only one of many, for example, Granny "visiting" her fellow
survivor, or Granny eating a bean, that continue to burn vividly in my
memory.</P>
<P>     The children are charming, but not quite real.  They come closest
to being mere stick figures that exist only to announce the sensei's
message.  For better or worse, Kurosawa-san is an artist who is willing
to take a chance, even with telling us what we need to hear.</P>
<P>     As a film maker, sensei has eschewed the lavish costumes and period
charm of RAN and segments of DREAMS to produce what might be the
definitive Japanese film.  He sticks to medium- and low-camera angles
without closeups, long static scenes, and intimate human interactions
(as Jeff Shannon pointed out in his review in the Seattle P-I).</P>
<P>     To anyone who thinks he or she can sit through a very non-Hollywood
film, I recommend RHAPSODY IN AUGUST most highly.  Pay what you have to,
it's for a good cause.</P>
