<P>I have just finished watching this long documentary, on tape. I am 
stunned, shaken up and grateful that I can write on it rather than 
discuss it verbally.</P>
<P>In the classic "Hiroshima, mon Amour," a French woman, an extra in a 
"Ban the Bomb" movie being shot, and a local Japanese architect, have a 
touching brief encounter. She tells him of her visits to the martyr 
city: "I have seen everything in Hiroshima." He replies: "No, you saw 
nothing in Hiroshima."</P>
<P>Some of us may think that they've read or seen everything about the 
Holocaust and Anne Frank, This film proves we have seen nothing. The 
story is a neverending one. Something new discovered every day. As one 
of the participants in the documentary says of the long, nightmarish 
train journey to a concentration camp: "You refuse reality. After a 
while imagination stops." </P>
<P>"Anne Frank Remembered" was made principally by the man who was given 
the 1994 British Academy award for his documentary "Schindler." Jon 
Blair has done a terrific job in combining war and remembrance, the 
portrait of Anne and the horrors of the Nazis, old and sadly familiar 
archival footage and much that was unfamiliar or newly found. He and his 
staff  interweave with superb skill and balance past and present, 
interviews with surviving friends of the Frank family.</P>
<P>The film even transcends personal tragedy and unspeakable mass crimes 
during World War II. It stands for all types of man's inhumanity to man 
fostered by prejudice, racial, ethnic, religious discrimination.</P>
<P>At the center of this work is 80-plus Miep Gies, a gentle, gentile lady  
who in the 1940s worked for Otto Frank. (Anne's father had a small 
pectin-making business in Amsterdam). While the Franks were in hiding, 
she was their contact with the outside, their purveyor of food, 
necessities and news. Miep is a marvelous woman whom one would never 
call "an old lady." Her faculties are intact, her mind  lucid, her 
intelligence high, her manner eloquent yet straightforward. Miep is also 
the person who found and saved for years the diary of Anne Frank.</P>
<P>The movie does not push the pedal on pathos or sentiment. It doesn't 
have to. Places, events and people speak for themselves. Miep is not the 
only witness. She shares the screen with other, equally unrhetorical yet 
quite sophisticated friends of Anne and her folks.</P>
<P>They take up a big chunk of time, yet they're always effective as they 
speak calmly, go to the end of what they're saying and do not produce 
sound bites. </P>
<P>You never have the impression of watching "talking heads." This is 
reinforced by the interviewer, present, unseen and unobtrusive. 
Exceptionally he is heard asking a question, always brief and to the 
point. He never controls or manipulates his subjects, never puts words 
in their mouth.</P>
<P>The film does start with background information that the average person 
does not know perhaps, especially when we refer to the Franks as Dutch 
Jews. The Franks were an old, distinguished family of Germans who, like 
countless others, happened to be Jewish, cultured, totally assimilated, 
patriotic, with relatives who had fought for Germany in WWI. Their 
children, first Margot then Anna (as they called her) were born in 
Frankfurt.</P>
<P>Unlike many other Germans, Otto Frank saw the handwriting on the wall. 
With his wife and children he left Germany for Holland in 1933, as soon 
as Hitler was given dictatorial powers. They were later joined by more 
Jews, many of them erstywhile personalities in Germany, like a former 
Minister for the Press.</P>
<P>Emigrating very early, Mr. Frank was wise. But later, when one was sure 
of the defeat of Germany and optimism set in, it was not so smart to 
hide instead of fleeing, assuming this were possible. This is perhaps 
the only miscalculation by Otto Frank, who was a superb, sensitive, 
devoted husband and father, an all-around superior human being, and the 
sole survivor of the four Franks.</P>
<P>There was, of course, the trust that Jews put in the Dutch, a justified 
confidence. While, after the occupation of Holland, some Dutch Nazi 
groups sprouted up, the great majority of the population were protective 
of "their" Jews -- witness the steady help to the Franks. Only one other 
country can claim the same massive, heartfelt assistance to Jews: 
Denmark. </P>
<P>Anne is not sentimentalized or idealized. We hear that she was a 
naughty, even impertinent child. The mother of a friend used to say "God 
knows everything...Anne knows everything better". In hiding, she was not 
always easy to be with. She wrote of her contempt for her mother and her 
dislike of 54-year old dentist Fritz Pfeffer. (He was the eight person 
to go to the hideout, after Otto's associate Hermann van Pels, his wife 
and son).</P>
<P>"Anne Frank" is a succession of gripping moments, scenes and sequences, 
done with restraint and taste (including Branagh's narration), which 
make it all the more devastating. A must-see film, above all  for those 
young and youngish who, in this information age, know so pathetically 
little of history. </P>
