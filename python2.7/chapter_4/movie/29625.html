<PRE>                        JALLA! JALLA!
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: This super-light situation comedy from Sweden 
    tells the story of two close friends with romantic 
    problems.  The script involves formerly taboo subjects 
    like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the 
    writing is not a lot different from what is shown free 
    on television.  The characters are paper-thin and the 
    interesting ideas purely non-existent.  This is a 
    decrement-life-by-90-minutes card.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 
    0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>JALLA! JALLA! is basically an exuberant TV situation comedy 
written instead for the wide screen.  It tells the story of two 
park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to 
true love.  The film is set in Sweden where Roro and Mans (Fares 
Fares and Torkel Petersson) are custodians at a public park.  Roro 
is from a tightly knit Lebanese family who control him very 
closely, Mans is a Swede from a much more liberal background.  
They spend most of the day in the bushes at their park, cleaning 
up after dogs.  Roro and Mans each have girlfriends, but each has 
a problem.  Roro (nicknamed "Jalla") is having family problems.  
It seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him 
and a nice Lebanese woman, Yasmin (Laleh Pourkarim), but he is 
already in love with Lisa (Tuva Novotny).  Yasmin likes Roro, but 
does not want to get married either.  Mans on the other hand has 
been having a problem of sexual impotence.  The two friends worry 
about their problems and discuss the problems with each other.  
Mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual 
enhancers.  The one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy 
them.  Roro and Yasmin decide to give themselves some time by 
telling the families that they want to marry each other, but then 
plan to break up before the wedding.  Not too surprisingly neither 
finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected.</P>
<P>The plot turns in several places are contrived.  One knows fairly 
quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody 
certain plot contrivances have to happen.  Lebanese-born Josef 
Fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he 
is a writer.  When things start to get slow, he just adds throws 
in another story.  For example halfway into the film Mans 
innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added 
to the film.  Characterization is a little better with Roro than 
it is with Mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more 
personality beyond fear for losing a biological function.  We do 
see some of Roro's family life and his concerns.  That may be 
because Roro's background is a lot like that of the director.</P>
<P>While the story was entertaining, I did not feel that I got 
anything worthwhile from the film.  It was just a way to pass 
about an hour and a half in my life.  One does not have to go to 
the movies to see entertainment like this.  I rate it a 4 on the 0 
to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
