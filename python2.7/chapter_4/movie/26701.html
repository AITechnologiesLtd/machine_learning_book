<PRE>"Charlie's Angels"</PRE>
<P>We've had "Sgt. Bilko," "The Addams Family," "McHale's Navy," "The Mod
Squad" and "The Fugitive," all TV shows that became the concept fodder for
movies decades later. This hit or miss proposition has produced such
ridiculous dreck as "Bilko" and "McHale" and well-made big screen
adaptations like "The Fugitive." Columbia Pictures gets on the remake wagon
with the reprise of the 1970's TV babe fest, "Charlie's Angels," with the
update starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as Charlie's
girls and Bill Murray as the ever loyal lieutenant, Bosley.</P>
<P>The draw for the new, big screen rendition of "Charlie's Angels" is the
built in attraction for the ready-made audience of fans of the TV show.
That and, of course, the showcase for some of Hollywood's hottest female
properties. Just about everyone who sees the movie will know about the
show, its faceless narrator (once again, voiced by John Forsythe) and its
bevy of beautiful, brilliant and bodacious babes. The Angels are three
talented and athletic private eyes working for their mysterious boss and
solving all kinds of complicated crimes and their latest case is no
different.</P>
<P>Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) is a handsome genius and founder of Knox
Technologies. He has designed a voice-identification software program that
is more accurate than fingerprinting. But, in the wrong hands, it could
prove a worldwide disaster. When the scientist is kidnapped, Knox president
Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch) turns to the one man - and three women - who can
break the case, Charlie and his Angels.</P>
<P>Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) jump on the case and begin
their investigation with Roger Corwin (Tim Curry). Corwin heads Red Star
Systems, the world's largest telecommunications satellite network, and is
the arch business rival to Knox. The corporate honcho is the Angels' prime
suspect and the team works, first, to free Knox from his kidnappers, then
foil Corwin's plans to steal and use the advanced technology for his own
greedy purposes. But, after they save their client, they discover that all
is not as it seems and the identity of the real bad guy takes a sudden
twist, putting the lives of the Angels, and Charlie, in grave danger.</P>
<P>The screenplay for the new "Charlie's Angels" doesn't make any real attempt
to update the original material of the TV show. Instead, the writers (Ryan
Rowe, Ed Solomon and John August) give the story a 70's retro feel that
captures the mood of the series. This is a help as the players in the film
can anchor their perfs to the simple action/T&A template of the show
without having to break new creative ground. As such, the concentration is
on the usual flash and fire coupled with choreographed fights and
Matrix-style special F/X.</P>
<P>No one in the cast is going to earn any Oscars or Golden Globe awards for
"Charlie's Angels," but the actors seem to be having some fun. Cameron Diaz
is almost gleeful in her portrayal of the ditzy, yet competent, Natalie.
She has all of the action and Kung Fu moves down while putting a comic spin
on her character. Diaz gets mileage out of scenes like her rescue of Bosley
from a prison at the same time a new boyfriend (Luke Wilson) gives her a
call. It's absurdist but, because of Diaz, it works.</P>
<P>Barrymore is cute as a button as Dylan and she, too, has good fun,
especially when she takes down five of the bad guy's henchmen while tied to
a chair. Lucy Liu, whom I usually find annoying as an actor, fits the
action bill well as the tough as nails Alex. Bill Murray doesn't get to do
too much as Bosley - kind of like in the TV show. Supporting cast is good,
though mostly underutilized. Tim Curry is wasted as a maguffin used to
distract the viewer from the real bad guys. Sam Rockwell gets to put an arc
on his perf as Eric Knox, shifting gears along the way as the nature of his
character changes. Crispin Glover gives his henchman, called the Thin Man,
a silent, chain smoking twist that makes him seem like he's right out of a
low budget James Bond flick. Kelly Lynch, Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and LL
Cool J are given little to do except appear on the screen.</P>
<P>Tech credits are solid as first-time director, named McG, puts his music
video imprint on the film. Fast editing, rapid-fire camera (by Russell
Carpenter) and slick production values make this a quickly paced bit of
movie fluff. I have to say, though, that the 92-minute run time feels long.
A short film by today's standards, it could have used some judicious
editing. Things run out of steam well before the end of "Charlie's Angels,"
but that doesn't stop the filmmakers from setting us up for the sequel(s)
just before the end credits.</P>
<P>Looks are more important than the plot line of "Charlie's Angels" and I
guess that's how it should be. Teenage girls are the target audience and
the likable action figures rep'd by the three Angels are decent enough role
models. The sexy outfits they get to strut around in should be sufficient
draw for the boyfriends, too. This is not meant for the more discerning
viewer, though. I give it a C+.</P>
