                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Sean Nelson, Giancarlo Esposito, Samuel L. Jackson,
N'Bushe Wright, Luis Lantigua.
Screenplay/Director:  Boaz Yakin.</P>
<P>     The recent commercial and critical success of such urban-themed
films as BOYS N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY is proving to be a
strange double-edged sword.  While they have inspired more films
focused on inner city life, there seems to be a developing perception
among mainstream moviegoers that they are more or less interchangeable,
that if you've seen one film with urban kids shooting at each other,
you've seen them all.  Not only does this perception perpetuate the
idea that there is only one story to tell about the inner cities, but
it can force some fantastic films to the margins before they even have
a chance.  Witness FRESH, a powerful urban drama that ranks among the
year's best and most devastating works.</P>
<P>     FRESH is the street tag of Michael (Sean Nelson), a
twelve-year-old New York youth with a dream of making it out of the
projects.  He slowly builds an impressive roll of cash by making
deliveries for heroin dealer Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito), as well as
selling crack on the streets.  However, he soon finds himself in
trouble from every direction.  He is a witness to a murder committed by
a short-fused neighborhood tough (Jean LaMarre), and is in danger of
going back to a group home when his aunt disapproves of his
activities.  Fearing for his very life, Fresh begins applying the chess
lessons of his absentee father (Samuel L. Jackson) to a plan to make
his dream a reality.</P>
<P>     FRESH easily could have been just another drama about drugs n the
hood, but what makes it truly harrowing is its focus on pre-teenagers.
Fresh is smart enough to realize that the trash talk of the streets
means nothing, but for his classmates, particularly the loud-mouthed
Chuckie (Luis Lantigua), it is a rite of passage.  By mimicking the
language that surrounds them, even as they discuss baseball cards and
comic books, they become part of the cycle before they even realize
it.  The words themselves at a certain point become meaningless,
particularly when Chuckie tries to convince Esteban that he too should
make deliveries because he's "got all the dope moves." Writer-director
Boaz Yakin creates a portrait of doomed youth that is gripping and
gut-churning.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of this study is a stunning performance by young
Sean Nelson as Fresh.  There is not a moment when he rings false, his
eyes betraying a sadness beyond his years and a burning intelligence.
His reaction to one of the film's pivotal scenes, involving a shootout
in a schoolyard, is jaw-dropping, and it's only one of many wrenching
moments he has to carry.  The film's third act only works because we
believe that Fresh is so sharp and observant, and the final scene only
works because we understand how much he wishes it hadn't been
necessary.  As FRESH ends, Michael's street tag takes on a bitter irony
as his "freshness" disappears.</P>
<P>     Nelson gets more than enough assistance from a superb supporting
cast.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Fresh's father with a shaky dignity, one
that doesn't require an explicit explanation as to why he is not
Fresh's guardian.  Though similar to Laurence Fishburne's character in
SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, it's more layered, and more imbued with
history.  Giancarlo Esposito is a subtle and complex figure as Esteban,
and delivers a skin-crawling scene as he describes his lust for Fresh's
sister while cradling his infant daughter.  From top to bottom the
performers do just a little more than you might expect, turning the
stereotype into a flesh and blood character.</P>
<P>     In many ways, FRESH is an extremely pessimistic film, and as such
will be difficult to watch.  It is about innocence corrupted, described
in shocking detail with no punches pulled.  I left FRESH with my mouth
literally hanging open, affected to the bone by a spectacular piece of
storytelling.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dope moves:  10.</PRE>
