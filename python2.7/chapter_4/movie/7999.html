<PRE>                                    CON AIR
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Nicloas Cage and John Malkovich
A Touchstone Release</PRE>
<P>Here we have another trashy Jerry Bruckheimer film. And to be honest, it's
very dull, and not too exciting. This is not because there are no explosions
and stunts, it's just the fact that we've seen it all before!</P>
<P>The story is nearly exactly the same as Execuitve Decision, and Turbelence.
Cage plays Cameron Poe, who's going back to see his wife and kid after being
in prison for killing a man while defending his wife. So, he gets on a plane
home. However, this plane is also transporting nasty, horrible, cliched
villians, who, NO!, take over the plane. Didn't see that coming, did you?</P>
<P>So, Cage is now fighting for his life against these nasty crimnials. On the
ground, a 'fed' is trying to get him home safely, (played by John Cusack)
while Colm Meaney just wants to blow the plabe out of the sky.
The thing is, we've seen it all before, so it's dull, dull, DULL! If you're
looking for trashy rubbish with no oringinality however, you could do worse
than this. However, I can't really recommended it. It's just another dumb
action film!</P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=** out of *****
