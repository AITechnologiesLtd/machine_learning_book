<P>PULP FICTION, Quentin Tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up
to RESERVOIR DOGS, is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of
the most talked about, loved, and hated films of all-time.  In all
fairness, it should be noted that those who love this film greatly
outnumber those who hate it.  As if RESERVOIR DOGS wasn't perfect,
Tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating PULP FICTION,
a fast-paced, hard talking, roller coaster ride of a movie that combines
violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way. </P>
<P>Every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting
performance by the actor.  To begin with, the two hit men: Vincent Vega
(John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson).  These two
characters work together perfectly, and the performances by each actor are
nearly perfect.  Travolta, in fact, is still trying to get out of the
Vincent Vega role.</P>
<P>If these two characters were not enough, there's the struggling boxer
Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), the two small-time criminals Pumpkin (Tim
Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), the big man in charge Marsellus
Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his attractive young wife Mia (Uma Thurman), and
the "problem solver" himself, The Wolf (Harvey Keitel).  These are just
the major characters.  </P>
<P>Smaller roles, but equally terrific, are handed to Jimmie (Quentin
Tarantino), a young married man who gets caught up in some
serious gangster business, Lance (Eric Stoltz), the far-out drug dealer,
as well as Maynard (Duane Whitaker) and Zed (Peter Greene), two
hillbillies who are the men "behind" (no pun intended for those of you
who have seen this) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film.</P>
<P>The film interweaves three stories that, at first, seem to be nothing
alike but later prove to be very critical to each other.  The film begins
with Pumpkin and Honey Bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their
recent robberies and hold-ups.  The two quickly decide to hold up the
coffee shop, unknowing of what lies ahead.</P>
<P>After this, the film focuses for some time on Vincent and Jules and their
hit man lifestyle.  Utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue, the two
men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust
into an apartment to terrorize the occupants.  The two men were sent to
the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss, Marsellus
Wallace.  After basically toying with the men, especially the unfortunate
Brett (Frank Whaley), Vincent and Jules complete their mission and recover
the briefcase.  This is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a
.357 "hand cannon", shooting at the two gangsters.  He somehow completely
misses them, leading Jules to cite divine intervention.  This is also the
basis for more of the now-famous Tarantino dialogue.</P>
<P>The film then shifts to focus on boxer Butch Coolidge and his boxing
escapades.  Butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight, but when
he does not, Marsellus vows to find him, wherever he is, and make sure
that Butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune. </P>
<P>Vincent, meanwhile, has the honor of taking Marsellus' wife, Mia, out on a
date while the big man is out of town.  Vincent, obviously, is rather
nervous about this, especially after hearing the tale about a man who was
thrown out of a window for supposedly giving Mia a foot massage.  After
their date, which seems to rather smoothly, things take a turn for the
worst at the hands of Vincent's high-priced heroin, dubbed a
"monster" by Lance.</P>
<P>Each story continually progresses, and new and amazing events
occur.  Eventually, the stories all meet each other in the end, with
Pumpkin and Honey Bunny holding up the restaurant, which happens to
contain both Vincent and Jules.</P>
<P>PULP FICTION is definitely one of the best films of the decade, and
possibly of all-time.  Along with its superb dialogue, action, writing,
directing, and acting, this film will not only latch onto you, but it
proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws
completely into you.  And with most fans of this movie, this is proved to
be a rather easy task, although at times the graphic images,
violence, and language may seem a bit overpowering.  Surely, Quentin
Tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film, and he proves not to
be one who will fade from existence very soon.</P>
