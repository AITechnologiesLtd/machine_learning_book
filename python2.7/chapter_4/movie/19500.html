<P>
 The Haunting (1999) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Liam Neeson, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor. Directed by Jan De Bont.</P>
<P> "The Haunting"  the original, 1963 Robert Wise-directed version  is one
of the scariest films in the history of cinema.</P>
<P> And it follows the precepts of two old grand masters of the horror genre
 Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. Both said on more than one occasion
that the most frightening terror was not what was put on screen, but
what the audience conjured up in its own imagination.</P>
<P> That was where Wise's "Haunting" succeeded so brilliantly. Everything
happened just out of sight. You heard noises, but never saw anything, or
something flashed by so quickly you weren't sure what you saw.</P>
<P> The same cannot be said for a very lame remake of "The Haunting" released
by DreamWorks. It is about as scary as a haunted house ride at a kiddie
park.</P>
<P> At a screening of the movie, audience members laughed during scenes that
were supposed to make them scream.</P>
<P> Everything in this new version of "The Haunting" is bigger, especially the
house, the sets and the special effects. It looks like more money was
poured into these than into financing an adequate script.</P>
<P> Calling the screenplay for "The Haunting" mediocre gives it more credit
than it is due.</P>
<P> "The Haunting" is a dud, a big disappointment, a letdown.
It reeks of cynicism.</P>
<P> And I'm angry because Hollywood  in its infinite idiocy  has once again
taken a classic and tried to "improve" on it not through the story but
by using bells and whistles. I curse movie executives who continually
underestimate, condescend and show utter contempt for moviegoers by
releasing crap such as "The Haunting." Their penalty should be an eternity
in purgatory with continuous showings of this abomination coupled with
the remake of "The Wild Wild West."</P>
<P> You could get more chills standing in front of an open refrigerator than
by watching "The Haunting."</P>
<P> In the original, a scientist invited a group of test subjects  most of
whom had paranormal powers such as ESP  to spend time with him in an
evil, old house. The doctor wanted to prove that ghosts and evil spirits
did exist. Those who joined him knew from the outset what they were in
for.</P>
<P> In this remake, a scientist (Liam Neeson, in a very weak role) invites
three people to join him in a spooky old castle ostensibly to study
insomnia, but in reality, he is conducting experiments in fear. Of
course, he fails to let his subjects know what he's doing, but, hey, I
guess scientists today also have seen a sharp decline in ethics.</P>
<P> So tagging along with Neeson are Lili Taylor's Eleanor, who is a bit
off-kilter after spending the past 11 years caring for her demanding
invalid mother; Catherine Zeta-Jones' Theo, a bisexual artist; and Owen
Wilson's Luke, a wise-cracking cynic.</P>
<P> It's not even worth the time or effort to go into the specifics of the
plot.</P>
<P> Let's just say there's a gratuitous decapitation inserted solely for
shock value; a ghost who's about as scary as Casper; and a silly looking
haunted house that can pass as a refugee from a Scooby-Doo cartoon.</P>
<P> The interior of the house looks as if it were decorated by the same people
who did the Nostromo in "Alien."</P>
<P> Director Jan De Bont, the man who gave us "Speed" and "Twister," seems to be
in a slump. Prior to this he directed the dreadful sequel "Speed 2:
Cruise Control." Perhaps the three-strikes law should be applied to movie
directors. If so, De Bont would be a prime candidate.</P>
<P> "The Haunting" is dull, dreadful and plodding. It's about as scary as "Bela
Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla." The only thing scarier would be if
DreamWorks decides to do a sequel.</P>
