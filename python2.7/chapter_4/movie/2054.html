<PRE>                                  THE FUGITIVE
                       A film review by Tracy E. Finifter
                        Copyright 1993 Tracy E. Finifter</PRE>
<P>     Having seen only one episode of the 1960's television series, and
only a part of it at that, I came into this movie with very little by
way of preconceptions.  Of course, the basic premise is famous: a
respected doctor, Dr. Richard Kimble, is sentenced to die for the
murder of his wife which he did not commit.  After escaping in a bus
accident, Detective Sam Gerard (in the movie, converted to U.S.
Marshall) becomes obsessed with his recapture while Kimble searches for
the one armed man seen at the scene of the crime.</P>
<P>     But that's about all this movie has in common with the television
show.  For one, this is a full-fledged murder mystery as Kimble takes
on his own investigation as to who murdered his wife and why.
Secondly, the movie format limits the story to basically a chase/murder
mystery, whereas the series was known for the different situations
Kimble would find himself in week after week.  There is one instance in
the movie where Kimble stops long enough to help someone else out (as
was the main focus in the series) which was a small tribute to the
spirit of the series, but the 2+ hour length does not allow for more.</P>
<P>     The film is a fast-paced, well structured chase movie which asks
you to stretch the imagination at points, but never fails to be
enjoyable.  There are times where the tension becomes almost tangible
as our hero struggles to stay one step ahead of the law.</P>
<P>     The biggest departure from the series comes in the character of
Deputy Samuel Gerard.  Whereas the series' character was clearly the
bad guy who's obsession on capturing Kimble makes him thoroughly hated
by the audience, the film's Gerard comes off as just cop trying to get
his man.  At times he seems almost too glib, but his one-liners bring a
comic relief in contrast to Kimble's almost lack of dialog.  Of course,
this Gerard is portrayed as much more competent than the series'
Gerard; after all, he captured Kimble after two hours whereas it took
the other Kimble seven years!</P>
<P>     For fans of the old series, be prepared.  THE FUGITIVE is a
thoroughly updated and modern version of the series, definitively set
in our time, complete with 911, cellular phones, and bullet-proof glass
doors.  And if you've seen the final episode of the series, do not
fear.  The resolution with the one armed man is completely different
than the one portrayed in the series.  Clearly, this movie will
continuously be compared with its television namesake, but the nature
of the movie is entirely different.  This is a smart, intelligent chase
movie that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  Harrison Ford once
again proves himself to be the thinking man's action hero as he manages
to go from scrape to scrape, barely managing to get himself out of each
new jam.  Tommy Lee Jones provides the perfect foil and his face to
face encounters with Ford are among the most gripping of the film.</P>
