<PRE>Grease, starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John
3 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> The question isn't why has Grease been reissued. The answer to that one is
easy: To celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for
Paramount's coffers because John Travolta is once again a hot commodity.</P>
<P> No, the question that ought to be asked is: Should Grease be reissued?</P>
<PRE> The answer is not an easy one.</PRE>
<P> Grease is a fun movie, an entertaining fantasy of the '50s, embodying all
the cliches of that era. The music is lively and the dance numbers,
choreographed by Patricia Birch, are energetic and high-spirited.</P>
<P> Travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon, cool, but non-threatening.</P>
<P> But Grease didn't break any new cinematic ground. It was not a milestone
in movie history such as Citizen Kane or Easy Rider.</P>
<P> What Grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film
history.</P>
<P> OK, let's not be a spoilsport. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie,
even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as Travolta,
Olivia Newton-John, Taxi's Jeff Conaway and the multi-talented Stockard
Channing try to act like high schoolers.</P>
<P> It's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer Travolta was, and it's sad to
think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his
career. He could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of Gene
Kelly.</P>
<P> Cinematically, the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the
dinosaur. Between Grease and 1996's Evita., you can probably count the
number of movie musicals on one hand.</P>
<P>  Two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre: The first is
that movie audiences have become more sophisticated, no, make that cynical
and jaded. Today, if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra
in sight, he or she would probably be hooted off the screen.</P>
<P>   Today's audiences lack the innocence, that belief in movie magic that is
required for a musical to succeed.</P>
<P>  Secondly, a lack of talent. Performers with the charisma, the style, the
larger-than-life panache of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Ginger Rogers and
Judy Garland are gone.</P>
<P>  Most singers and dancers remain on the stage, and those who do succeed in
movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts. A good example is Gregory
Hines, one of the greatest dancers in the world. He danced a bit in The
Cotton Club, Tap and White Nights, but those were essentially dramatic
vehicles.</P>
<P>  So, perhaps the reissue of Grease can serve a purpose. If audiences show
enough interest, meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue,
it may spark a revival in movie musicals.</P>
<P>  Perhaps not original musicals such as Singin' in the Rain , An American
in Paris or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, but for Broadway properties
that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several
years.</P>
<P>  At one time or another, according to the industry rumor mill, Hollywood
has been set to create an animated version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, a
filming of the popular Phantom of the Opera  as well as Les Miserables and
Chicago, the latter reportedly to star Madonna.</P>
<P>  So, let this Grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals. Let
Grease be the word that sparks this revival.</P>
