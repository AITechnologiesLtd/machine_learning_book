<PRE>                                  MONEY TRAIN
                       A film review by Anthony E.  Wright
                        Copyright 1995 Anthony E.  Wright</PRE>
<P>     At the New York Transit Museum, a abandoned subway station in
Brooklyn that vividly shows the history of one of the finest and
largest public transportation systems in the world, a movie theater is
lined with photos of classic straphanger-oriented films from the past.
But the cinematic romance with the underground is still alive: this
impressive display (which includes THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE WARRIORS,
and DEATH WISH) does not include the recent spate of movies paying
homage to public transportation, like DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, WHO
FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?  and GHOST.  Sandra Bullock is single-handedly
making public transportation sexy, more than all the "Miss Subways"
pageants of old, with the big hits SPEED and WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.</P>
<P>     The new exhibit at the Transit Museum last week, alongside subway
cars from the 1904 to the present, is the actual cab used in the
filming of the MONEY TRAIN, a new film focusing on a fictional train
which collect millions of dollars a day in token sales. (While the New
York Transit Authority does have 20 revenue collection cars, this shiny
fortress-like version is a Hollywood creation.)  A helpful tour guide
says that four such models were made, but the other three were blown
up.</P>
<P>     That fact is basically what you need to know about the MONEY
TRAIN: it's a thrilling action adventure where trains rollick around
quickly and blow up, like SPEED.  The other main fact is that it stars
Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson, doing similar action roles as in
their transportation-based thrillers PASSENGER 57 and THE COWBOY WAY,
respectively.</P>
<P>     But the reference is clearly to the similarly hip and urban romp
WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, to which MONEY TRAIN is basically a sequel.  The
characters even seem similar: Snipes plays a trash-talking show-off who
is grounded in the urban scene; Harrelson plays a white guy who has a
black sensibility, which provides wonderful comic possibilities, but
the character has gambling, identity, and other problems.  In MONEY
TRAIN, the two are dubbed "the transit twins," as foster brothers doing
undercover transit police work.  Just to play it safe, Jennifer Lopez
is brought in to play the attractive Hispanic female, although without
the schtick of Rosie Perez. (Lopez would have stolen the movie away
from the male leads if not for a truly horrible characterization by the
writers.)  But even if the characters do seem awfully familiar, we get
enough plot, which offers more than just padding for the action.</P>
<P>     It's a good movie, action-packed with just enough sass, humour,
energy and seriousness to keep it interesting throughout.  It gets the
adrenaline pumping.  However, I must confess that as a mass-transit
buff, and a New Yorker with an admiration of the subways, I might be
biased.</P>
<P>     The question I asked when the film ended, and that my companions
did, and that the country is now asking given recent news events, is:
Why did the TA agree to help with this film? Not only does it make the
TA look like idiots, and portrays the subways as especially dangerous,
but also gives people some stupid ideas: running around on tracks,
riding on top of subway cars, torching subway token booths, jumping in
front of trains, and (oh, yeah) stealing money trains.</P>
<P>     With the recent torching of a token booth that could have been a
"copycat" act, the old questions about how the media affect society are
dramatized as a token clerk sits in the hospital with serious,
life-threatening problems.  The normal responsible line is to say that
violence in context is fine (a la SCHINDLER'S LIST) but violence for
pure titillation is not (a.k.a. RAMBO).  Shouldn't movies portray events
which do occur--like booth torchings, which happening a couple of times
in the 1980s? Or do we want a sanitized media, free from real-life
events and problems? Perhaps the torching was over-the-top: they didn't
show the consequences of a booth torching, as the token clerk survived
unscathed in the movie; and they didn't show that booth now come with
sprinkler systems, making it hard for that crime to occur.</P>
<P>     With the torching (and the preposterous money train hijacking,
which certainly isn't realistic), most of the action stunts in this
movie involve stupid and dangerous things.  But I must confess, that's
what makes the movie exciting: they do the taboo things that as a
life-long rider I wouldn't and couldn't do.  I've occasionally thought
about trying to jump onto the tracks to quickly get to another
platform; that makes it more fun when Wesley Snipes does it as a #5
approaches.  Sure it's an irresponsible movie (in more ways than one),
and unfortunately, that's half the fun.</P>
<P>     The other public issue is the question of cooperation: The Transit
Authority usually frowns on movies that show the system as
"out-of-control."  (From the movies, you wouldn't get the facts that a
subway station or train is always safer that the streets above it.)  Yet
the Mayor's Office policy is to let Hollywood do their thing,
especially if it means bringing money into the city.  Most of the film
was in fact filmed on a Hollywood set, due to some TA reluctance.  But
that's still leaves the question why Hollywood's money train currently
sits on New York subway tracks.  Perhaps it was stolen.</P>
