<P>_The_Muse_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>"I've hit the wall," proclaims Albert Brooks's character toward the
beginning of _The_Muse_, and one may feel the same about the
writer-director-star after seeing his latest, which ends in a most
lackluster fashion.  But before the film hits that creative obstruction,
Brooks is able to get in a number of jabs at Hollywood, and elicits some
nice performances from his cast--that is, once he settles into a
comfortable comedic rhythm, which he takes his sweet time to establish.</P>
<P>That rhythm is established with the arrival of the title character,
played--in her neverending quest for respectability--by Sharon Stone, who
does fare well in this, her first major comic role.  Her mysterious Sarah
Little claims to be a bonafide daughter of Zeus, bearing the divine gift
of inspiration.  Boasting a long and illustrious list of satisfied
customers--including James Cameron, Rob Reiner, and, in the film's best
comic performance, Martin Scorsese--it takes fairly little to convince
jobless veteran screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) to employ her
services.</P>
<P>Stone obviously has fun sending up her high-maintenance diva image as
Sarah, whose gifts come at a steep price; Steven must pay for all of her
ridiculous extravagances, such as a deluxe suite at a four-star hotel to
late night gourmet snacking food.  The laughs arise from these situations
are as soft as can be expected, and while there are a few pieces of
dialogue where Brooks's famously caustic wit shines through (particularly
in Steven's scenes with pompous Hollywood industry types), the film's
sense of humor is characterized by a certain gentleness.  This makes for
pleasantly witty, smile-worthy viewing, but not necessarily gut-busting
hilarity, such as the prominent subplot where Sarah inspires Steven's
wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) to start up her own business while Steven
himself remains bereft of story ideas.</P>
<P>And that's what ultimately happens to Brooks and writing collaborator
Monica Johnson.  Hard answers about Sarah inevitably must come, and when
they do, _The_Muse_'s low-fi energy begins to wane.  That did not
necessarily have to be the case, however, if the explanations propelled
the story into a new direction.  Instead, though, Brooks and Johnson
paint themselves into a corner that they obviously had no idea how to get
out of, resorting to a twist ending that is as unsatisfying as it is
contrived.  Appropriately enough, it seems that Brooks and Johnson needed
a muse of their own to really make this film work.</P>
