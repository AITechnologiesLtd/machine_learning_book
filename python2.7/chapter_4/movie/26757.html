<P>_The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Just who is Bagger Vance, and why is he so legendary?  Or, more
importantly, why should anyone care?  _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_,
Robert Redford's film of Steven Pressfield's novel of the same name,
offers plenty of pretty sunsets and New Agey gobbledygook but very little
reason why one should have an emotional investment in this benign, banal,
and sometimes boring inspirational drama.</P>
<P>        The main character is not Will Smith's titular golf caddy, but
one Rannoulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who at one point was considered the
greatest golfer in all the South, but tragedy on the battlefield in WWI
robbed him of all his nerve, not to mention the golf swing that earned
him the respect and admiration of many fans.  When Junuh's estranged
girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) stages a big exhibition
tournament to save the lavish golf course built by her late father, young
Junuh fan named Hardy Greaves (newcomer J. Michael Moncrief) sees this as
a chance for Junuh to reclaim his status after ten years of bitter
seclusion.  After some heavy duty campaigning by Hardy and Adele, Junuh
reluctantly agrees though his swing seems long a thing of the past. 
Enter Bagger Vance, who seemingly appears out of thin air one night in
Junuh's yard; a couple of golf pointers later, Bagger is Junuh's caddy.</P>
<P>        From this point, Redford and screenwriter Jeremy Leven could have
completely settled into sports movie formula, and their unwillingness to
fall into convention would be more admirable if their alternative were
more inspired.  Granted, one key variation from the formula--that Junuh's
two highly celebrated opponents (Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill) are good
people and not forced to fit into a "villain" mold--is refreshing.  But
the movie that Redford and Leven made really isn't about the tournament
so much as Junuh remembering his golf swing and all the psychological
healing that entails.  The problem is Junuh's trauma--his guilt over
being the sole survivor of his army platoon--is too simply handled, and
his road to recovery is less than convincing.  Bagger's long-winded
spiritual platitudes about golf are what set Junuh back on the right
path, and while the lyrical fairy tale gloss Redford gives the picture
keeps this point from being laughable, it simply reduces it to lesser
offense of being cornball.</P>
<P>        So where did Bagger get his bottomless pools of wisdom?  Who
knows; he could be a guardian angel, a mystical spirit, or just an
exceptionally perceptive and insightful man.  But the vagueness of his
character isn't as irksome as that of his more down-to-earth
counterparts.  Junuh: good guy, lost his confidence, needs it back. 
Adele: good gal, wants to preserve her dearly departed daddy's integrity.
 Hardy: good boy, wants his hero to succeed.  All the performances are
similarly nondescript, which is especially unfortunate in the case of
Smith.  Reduced to smiley-faced pontificating, the unpredictable energy
that usually makes him a captivating screen presence is as lost as
Junuh's swing.</P>
<P>        There is no denying that _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ is a
handsomely mounted production.  The film is exceedingly well done on the
technical end, highlighted by the cinematography of Michael Ballhaus, who
lushly captures the natural splendors of Savannah; and Rachel Portman's
subtle and evocative score.  If only the entire film were able to have as
firm a hold on the emotions as it does the senses.</P>
