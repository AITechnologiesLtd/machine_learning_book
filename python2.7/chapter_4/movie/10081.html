<PRE>                         THE WINGS OF THE DOVE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: One of Henry James's earlier and
          lesser novels makes one of the more entertaining
          films based on his works.  A woman whose guardian
          will not let her marry her poor lover plots to have
          the lover seduce a dying heiress so he will inherit
          her money.  The story meanders a bit in going where
          the viewer knows it eventually will, but the view
          is nice along the way.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>

<P>     The characters that Jane Austen writes about are almost from
another world.  Perhaps that is part of their appeal.  An Austen
heroine may spend the best part of a novel wondering if she should make
her move and profess her love for some man, or if she will instead
follow the conventions of her society.  That helps us get a better feel
for early 19th century British society, but it makes it a little harder
for the viewer or reader to identify with her characters.  Henry
James's characters, coming from a world a century later, are far more
modern and they get involved in situations the modern viewer can more
easily recognize.  While set in 1910, THE WINGS OF THE DOVE might have
taken place in the middle or maybe even the late 20th century.
Certainly the characters could be ones from a much more modern novel.</P>
<P>     Years ago Kate Croy's mother married for love a man from a lower
class.  The mother is apparently dead and her father has returned to
the lifestyle of drinking away what little money he has left.  Kate
(played by Helena Bonham Carter) now lives with her aunt (Charlotte
Rampling), who wants to protect her from making the same mistake her
mother did.  And protect she must because Kate loves a poor journalist,
Merton Densher (Linus Roache).  Kate's Aunt will not allow Kate and
Merton to even see each other.  Kate wants to marry Merton, but they
cannot live on the small salary that Merton makes.  Kate has a friend
who is an heiress from America, Millie Theale (Alison Elliott).  Millie
is a fresh young woman who appears to enjoy life, but as Kate discovers
Millie is actually dying.  Millie is being courted by Lord Mark, who
has breeding, is of the noble class, and otherwise is a consummate
jerk.  Kate would much prefer to see Millie leave her money to her
Merton.  That will make him acceptable to her class and will give them
both the money to live on.  She sets about trying to act as matchmaker
for her friend and her lover.  The story unfolds on a backdrop of
Kate's native London and Venice where she visits.</P>
<P>     To be frank, I have liked many of the films that Helena Bonham
Carter has been in but never been particularly fond of her as an
actress.  Her trademark has seemed to be an indelible indignant pout.
She has too often played the woman who knows all too well what is wrong
with society and has every right to pout. Ironically she is much more
likable as an actress when she is playing someone who is essentially a
deceitful schemer and who is betraying one of her closest friends.  I
liked her in this film as much as I ever have in any role.  My one
complaint is that the screen was probably just not ready for a Helena
Bonham Carter nude scene.  Nor was I.  Much more captivating is Alison
Elliott as the dying heiress.  She is brash yet unassuming,
representing all the positive characteristics that the British used to
think Americans had.  She is a very flattering stereotype.  Neither
Linus Roache nor Elizabeth McGovern (as Theale's friend and nurse) make
much of an impression.  Both are a little bland, though the film
suffers more from Roache's blandness.</P>
<P>     Under Iain Softley's direction Eduardo Serra's camera captures
memorable views of both London and Venice.  London is usually seen in
business-like blues and grays, often showing the coming of the modern
age.  The film starts on an underground train and often shows us
streets choked with cars and busses. Venice on the other hand is
usually shot in earth tones.  Most of what we see is centuries old.  Is
there some ironic comment that Kate's aunt with her old school ideas of
class remains behind in a very modern seeming London, while the more
modern seeming, cigarette-smoking Kate and her modern-thinking friends
gravitate to the antique splendor of Venice?  One remarkable scene is
captured by Serra has Kate's face lit up and framed in an oval mirror
so that the subtle conniver looks a lot like the witch from SNOW WHITE.</P>
<P>     THE WINGS OF THE DOVE surprises the viewer in several ways.  While
the ending is not much of a surprise, the film is creative in the ways
it get there.  I think people will find this film more approachable
than they expect.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
