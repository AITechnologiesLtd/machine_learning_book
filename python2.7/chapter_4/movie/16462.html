<P>   Some British papers have hailed "Lock, Stock and Barrel"
as the film of the week, with some Brits hoping that it will play
out in the U.S. like the major sleeper "The Full Monty." 
Unfortunately it is yet a copycat sample of its genre--one that
mines the well-worn territory of comical criminals and glorified
gangsters.  It's a first-feature by its writer-director, Guy
Ritchie, its style cloned largely from black-humor hoodlum
genre works like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction."  A
moviegoing British public would probably identify it closely
with the 1970 film "Get Carter" starring Michael Caine in the
role of a small-time gangster investigating his brother' death,
a work by Mike Hodges that captures the seediness of the
petty rackets in England.  </P>
<P>   Like Quentin Tarantino's 1994 masterwork "Pulp Fiction,"
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" is an audacious,
outrageous look at honor among lowlifes told in a style that
links seemingly separate stories, but though director Guy
Ritchie hired a cluster of non-actors--including a couple of
real tough ex-cons and a major British soccer player for a
look of authenticity, none of the actors maintains the sheer
magnetism of the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and John
Travolta.  Ritchie's film, like Tarantino's, is not for the
squeamish: although its director states in the production
notes that he abhors graphic violence and cuts away when
the action gets vicious, the movie is laced with quite a few
samples of the gory butchery albeit without the ketchup. 
Examples: one low-life holds the son of another gangster
hostage in a car while the daddy drives toward their
destination.  When daddy gets the jump on the hostage taker,
he dangles the latter's head just outside the car door and
proceeds to close the door on the man's crown swiftly,
viciously, and with intent to grind it to a pulp.  In yet another
vista, a hoodlum is felled by an axe thrown into his back but
before checking out he manages to shoot the perp and the
perp's boss in the gut.  </P>
<P>   Although the plot can be plenty confusing, it avoids
Tarantino's signature style by moving steadily, if at blazing
speed, from one incident to another rather than narrate
separate vignettes that come together only toward the
conclusion.  The picture's center is Eddie (Nick Moran), a
attractive gang member whose company of pals raise the
requisite 100 British pounds to enter a high-stakes card game
at the porn palace of crime boss "Hatchet" Harry (P.H.
Moriarty).  Though Eddie, a noted card sharp, wins hand after
hand, he is conned into taking a loan of 500,000 pounds from
Harry for one big pot, not knowing that the game is rigged. 
When Eddie loses the hand he is warned by Harry's right-
hand man, Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean), that Eddie and
his three friends would have a week to come up with the
money or lose one finger each for every day they are in
arrears--and that's for starters.  Eddie and company must
think fast: how to raise such a grand sum in such a short
time?  The obvious answer: steal it from other criminals.</P>
<P>   With razzle-dazzle cinematography--including freeze-
frames, slo-mo and fast-mo action, and upside-down images-
-the sepia-toned print takes Eddie into the activities of
criminal organizations, each specializing in a well-known
aspect of drug-related or violent crime.  We're introduced to
marijuana growers and dealers, some Samoan drug lords
(including one with an Afro in a role that an American director
would have given to Sam Jackson), and a couple of buffoons
who are sent out on a mission to steal valuable antique guns.</P>
<P>   Neither plot nor characterization appears to be the selling
point of director Ritchie, who is eager to portray the milieu of
London's East End during his 36-day shoot, caricaturing the
neighborhood's bad-guy ambiance with Tim Maurice-Jones's
helter-skelter photography.  In one imaginative scene that
goes by so fast that you'd do well not to blink, he flashes
some dialogue made up almost entirely of Cockney
colloquialisms with subtitles for the any overeducated people
in the audience who are not hip to street slang.  Not
surprisingly the most convincing performers in the tale grew
up in London's East End and are quite knowledgeable about
the ways of the pub-crawlers and swindlers who make their
home there.  One such fellow, a guy with tough past who
turns in one of the sharpest roles, is the late Lenny McLean
as Barry the Baptist--known as Britain's most successful
bare-knuckle fighter--who claimed to have been shot twice,
stabbed, and a participant in countless barroom brawls.  </P>
<P>   "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" would be a
prominent piece of low-budget filmmaking if had appeared a
decade or so ago, but by now the genre is so tired, the
glorification of violent criminals so prosaic, that it rates simply
as an also-ran.  The characters sometimes blend together
like the soldiers in Terrence Malick's "Thin Red Line," in a
movie which, however amusing, is just repackaged fare.</P>
