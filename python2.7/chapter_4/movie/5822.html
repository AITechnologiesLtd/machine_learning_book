<P>     In this better-late-than-never sequel to his 1981 cult classic
ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, director John Carpenter has envisioned the future
of Los Angeles as an island penal colony for America's least wanted.  In
the year 2013, any citizen caught engaging in acts illegal, immoral, or
fattening is expelled from the country.  That is, unless they choose
electrocution over deportation.  Zap.  Into this picture steps "Snake"
Plissken (Kurt Russell), that one-eyed, whispering wonder who, again, is
in the custody of the United States Police Force.  Like last time, the
deal goes something like this:  Snake has ten hours to land on Los
Angeles Island, recover a mysterious "black box" that was stolen by the
President's radical daughter, and return with the goods in hand.  If
he's a good boy, he'll be given both a pardon and an antidote to the
deadly virus that he's been intentionally infected with.  Sound
familiar?</P>
<P>     In addition to the ripe right-wing references and about a thousand
brutal barbs aimed at Southern California-- how well will jokes about
aftershocks, immigrants, and plastic surgery play in Peoria, anyway?--
we're also treated to such schlocky sights as a collapsed Capital
Records building, a sunken Santa Monica Freeway, and an underwater
Universal Studios.  Just ask for Babs.  The tone is expectedly tongue-
in-cheek and a spirit of anarchy pervades nearly every scene.  And, yet,
even with a super-cool supporting cast (Peter Fonda, Steve Buscemi, Pam
Grier, to name a few), the movie just doesn't *move*.  Call it what you
will-- flat, under-powered, a long sit, slower than a slow-moving white
Bronco-- but ESCAPE FROM L.A. is a risky recommendation at best.  Unless
you're a fan of the original, you might want to skip this one.</P>
