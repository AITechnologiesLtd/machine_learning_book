<P>Speechless might have been a better film if it weren't just an acting
showcase, and had more to do with the two characters in question.  But it
tries to get political, and full of ideals and desires, and the ending is a
mess of bad design and writing.  But the rest is entertaining, at least.
Specially if you like to see a good actor going through his motions.</P>
<P>Michael Keaton is a has been Hollywood writer that has just about quit what
he does best, and has been taken on as a writer, for a campaign for public
office.  And he is, at first, clever, a good writer, and gets the results.
But his competition is no slouch in the process and has a history of good
works, but lacks in the other areas, like a little influence, and being able
to get things done efficiently enough to be effective.  And Geena Davis, is
the other writer.</P>
<P>And they meet.  Of course.  And they happen to decide that they like each
other, only to find out that they are in the opposite camps, writing against
each other.  This does no favors to any relationship at all, but it does add
its moments.  The whole thing becomes a war of  attrition of words and
nerves, to see who is cleverest of all, and who  is able to manage the goods
better.  And the scoop is not cleared up until we see it to keep us
surprised.  In between these events, some materials get stolen and borrowed,
and each campaign works to be better than the other to help the candidate in
question.  It doesn't matter that she is the pro who has done this before,
or that the writer's ex-wife is the one that got him involved in this new
role, thus providing a bit of more chaos to the whole thing. All of a sudden
it isn't just a writing campaign, but a personal vendetta.</P>
<P>Speechless has funny moments, and they may be on the shoulders of Michael
Keaton and his acting ability to keep us busy and entertained. Without it,
the film nay have been too drab and boring.  And Geena Davis, gets a chance
to be next to someone who is good and will be better, and that is good for
her character.  The question is if it will work out in the end.</P>
<P>Well, it does, and it doesn't.  The ending feels like a throwaway. I think
that the outcome of the election should have been ignored and not a matter
in question.  Instead they make a mess of it by implicating bad political
precedent onto the running parties, whose behind the back dealings are as
dishonest as the relationship between the two writers has become.  And even
more so, because the public is unaware  of it.  The film doe snot resolve
this, and instead makes sure that the two characters get together.</P>
<P>And in the middle of it is a drab reporter that has some new designs on his
past flame, Geena Davis.</P>
<P>Well, it is nice to watch, but someone will have to remind me what it was
that was nice.  I enjoy solid acting jobs, and the only person that gets his
kudos for an evening's work here is Michael Keaton.  The rest, you'll have
to decide for yourself.</P>
