<P>Fast paced, decidedly lowbrow and gory enough to ensure an `R' rating, Rules
of Engagement is the most recent installment in Hollywood's oldest and most
classic genre: The Popcorn Flick. The acting is good, plot holes many and
concession stand just down the hall.</P>
<P>Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel Jackson) and Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee
Jones) served together in Vietnam where Childers saved Hodges' life. 28
years later, Childers has been through Beirut and Desert Storm while Hodges
has been through Georgetown Law. Before they both retire from the United
States Marine Corps, there is one last war to be fought.</P>
<P>While on a mission in Yemen to save the US Ambassador and his family from
hostile Islamic Fundamentalists protesting outside the embassy, Childers
witnesses the death of three of his marines as the armed crowd fires at his
squad. Following the rules of engagement and recognizing that an armed
civilian is no longer a civilian, Childers orders his men to open fire on
the rowdy protesters. Soon 89 Yemenis are dead and over a hundred others
injured. But for Childers, his mission has been accomplished: he rescued the
ambassador, saved as many of his men as possible and defused a unruly
situation through the necessary means (needless to say, the movie has some
issues establishing him as the genuine good-guy that he is supposed to be).
Imagine his surprise when he returns to the United States to learn that the
National Security Advisor is leading a political cover up and has decided
that a) the massacred crowd was unarmed (not many people have to be hushed
for such an allusion to be created) and b) Childers should stand murder
charges for shooting unarmed civilians.</P>
<P>Hodges owes his life to Childers and he will now have an opportunity to
repay that enormous debt in front of a court marshal. But first he will have
to convince himself that he is a worthy attorney, resolve a long-standing
yet unspoken conflict with his decorated father (there's a new one!) and
stop drinking (Tommy Lee Jones as a struggling alcoholic - who would have
thought?).</P>
<P>The movie's opening scene, set in the unruly jungles of Vietnam, is among
the more graphic that can be found in a primarily non-war film. But this is
necessary as the Childers character is established via the Asian war. And
although the gore might be more than what one wishes to see in a Hollywood
film, give credit for such reality to Platoon and Saving Private Ryan's Dale
Dye, the film's military technical adviser, who served 20 years in the
Marines (some of which were spent in that Vietnamese setting) before taking
to the more glamorous life that Hollywood provides.</P>
<P>Islamic supporters will likely be just as outraged at this film as they were
at 1998's The Siege, a movie they elected to picket nationwide. A critical
scene has Islamic propaganda spewing anti-Western sentiments, just an
example of the general stereotyping that paints the faith as being based on
terrorism. Even Islamic women and children are made to look bad at times.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson certainly don't wander into any new
territory with their roles here. Jones just had a similar part in last year'
s Double Jeopardy and Jackson gives an encore of his performance from The
Negotiator. Together, they make yet another excellent semi-action/semi-drama
duo that will likely go largely unnoticed come awards season (past examples
include John Travolta and Nicholas Cage for Face/Off, Samuel L. Jackson and
Kevin Spacey for The Negotiator and numerous James Bond good-guy/bad-guy
duos).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, some plot holes are far greater than those normally pardoned
in action films. A key witness is never called even though he is never
hushed, some simple trajectory tests that could end the trial are never
bothered with and a man standing trial for murder is never put behind bars
for reasons not clearly explained. Also, the film uses a cheap out-technique
when displaying white cards at the end to tie up some loose ends that would
have well been worth another 30 minutes. With the exception of documentaries
and films that have a smoother ending than this one, such cards should never
be needed.</P>
<P>Well, Hollywood's oldest institution has grown over time. Concession stands
no longer offer a genuine butter topping and you are naturally on the
edge-of-your seat during a film because the seats are too small in which to
sit back. Still, Rules of Engagement fits the modern requirements rather
well -– plenty of action, court room suspense, good acting, a few errors and
a predictable ending –- and you will be hard pressed to find better kernels
popping elsewhere.</P>
