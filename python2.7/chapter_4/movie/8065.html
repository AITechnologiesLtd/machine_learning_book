<PRE>HERCULES REVIEW
By Joe Blenkle</PRE>
<P>    Okay, I'll admit right up front that it's hard not to be biased in
my review of Walt Disney's 35th full-length animated feature -
HERCULES.
    Over the past few months I have become acquainted with one of the
stars of the film - Meg (better known as Susan Egan). 
    Susan is also better known in another Disney role , as she played
(and originated) the role of Belle in the Broadway stage production of
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.
    I am also proud to run the Official Susan Egan Fan Page (see link
below), where fans can see the many things Susan has done in an
unbelievably short amount of time.
    But back to the present. HERCULES opens today (June 27) in
theaters nationwide and Disney fans are going to be pleasantly
surprised at this film.
    For me personally, I felt HERCULES fell a little short of other
recent Disney outings like ALADDIN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but it
still holds the magic that all Disney classics do.
    The only real shortcoming of the film is that it didn't have
nearly enough singing by our beloved Meg. Susan had only one featured
song in the movie, "I Won't Say," which is a true pleasure to listen
to as she sings about her feelings toward Hercules and her disbelief
that she is falling for him.
    The movie itself is great. Hercules (Tate Donovan) is portrayed in
this film a little differently than told in ancient mythology, but the
general idea is the same. Part god and part mortal, Hercules sets
out to be a "true hero," the only way he can earn his way back to
Mount Olympus.
    But Hades (James Woods) has other plans. He is planning a hostile
takeover over Mount Olympus and he has been advised by the Three Fates
that only Hercules will stand in his way. 
    He dispatches his bumbling henchmen Panic (Matt Frewer) and Pain
(Bobcat Goldthwait) to kidnap the baby Hercules from Mount Olympus,
take him to Earth, give him a potion to make him mortal and then do
away with him.
    They only partially succeed, giving him all but a drop of the
potion which turns him mortal, but lets him retain his god-like
strength.
    Herc grows to manhood and sets out to find his roots, discovering
he is the son of Zeus (Rip Torn). Zeus tells him that his only way to
come back to Olympus is to become a true hero and to that end,
Hercules seeks out the trainer of heroes, a satyr named Phil (Danny
DeVito).
    Herc and Phil take on a relationship like Rocky and his trainer
and indeed, some of the sequences are reminiscent of the ROCKY movies.
    Phil soon gets Herc up to speed and it's off to challenge to
world, defeat all the monsters and become a hero. Along the way, Herc
becomes so famous that he has his own line of merchandise -
everything from sandles to action figures (available at a store near
you, I'm sure).
    But of course, everything isn't that simple. Hades is still out to
get Hercules and this time has a secret weapon - Meg - a young woman
who is working off her "life" sentence to Hades after dying
to save the life of her ungrateful boyfriend. 
    Meg doesn't want to get involved romantically ever again, but you
can guess what happens and the rest is "history."
    Herc's sidekick flying horse Pegasus and Phil take a dim view of
this distraction in Herc's life, but the hero won't listen to reason.
    Susan Egan and Tate Donovan do excellent jobs in the title roles.
There is a lot of humor, heartbreak and romance...but I won't give
away what happens, when or why.  The story becomes as touching as
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST in the end and HERCULES will have you leaving the
theater with a good feeling inside.
    HERCULES also stars the voice talents of Samantha Eggar as Hera;
Hal Holbrook as Amphitryon; Paul Shaffer as Hermes; and Charlton
Heston as the Narrator. 
    HERCULES is a Walt Disney Pictures production and is rated G for
General Audiences. The running time is 86 minutes and this flick rates
a perfect four stars.</P>
