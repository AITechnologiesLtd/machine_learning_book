JUNK MAIL (director: Pal Sletaune; cast: Robert Skjaerstad (Roy),
Andrine Saether (Line), Per Ergil Aske (Georg), Eli Anne Linnestad
(Betsy), 1997-Norway)</P>
<P>This Buster Keaton wannabe movie is supposedly a comedy/romance about an
inept, morose Oslo mailman, Roy (Skjaerstad), who is not respected by
his fellow workers and shows he is not satisfied with his job, somehow
taking this frustration out by not delivering heaps of mail, which he
dumps out regularly at some railroad underpass and by steaming open
other letters and reading them. He is a sleaze, a frequenter of porn
book shops and lowlife night spots. His life is a dreary, loveless mess.</P>
<P>As if all that is not bad enough, certainly grounds for dismissal from
the post office, someone who would upset me, if he was my mailman; but,
to top that off, he is also a voyeur, finding the keys to a deaf (she
wears a hearing aid) woman's apartment that she left in the mailbox, and
using the key to enter her apartment when she is at work at her dry
cleaning job, to go through her things and steal a photograph of her. It
seems he finds her attractive, but doesn't know how to get to tell her
this. She is played in a low-key manner by Andrine Saether (Line).</P>
<P>This film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful Oslo, where we
see crime, ugly buildings, the subway, and problems outsiders do not
associate with this peaceful and scenic country. The crime we see is Roy
being robbed of his mailbag, but his strap gets caught and he can't even
get robbed properly, later on saying he would have gladly given up the
bag and avoided the beating the three muggers gave him, that
hospitalized him and made him out to be a postal hero for not wanting to
give up the bag. The film spends most of the first half of the movie
showing him to be a screw off, everything he touches he fouls up, a
complete loser-- there is a long tradition of Hollywood comedians who
have exploited that avenue of comedy. His comic effect, is a deadpan
expression, that absorbs all criticism that comes his way. His fellow
postal workers rag him about what he is good for, and a lady postal
worker who wants to stick up for him, can only say that he is a good
walker, which causes a round of snickers from the postal workers ragging
him. What is funny, is the way he looks at us, as he looks at the
camera, showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature, emphasizing to
us that he is a natural screw up.</P>
<P>But the picture has darker ulterior motives than that, it will chuck out
all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and
go for the criminal aspects to the story, a decision that has to change
how we approach seeing this film, we can no longer be content to relax,
laughing at this inept mailman, we have to now see how he handles
himself under fire, while the director, also, tries to bring romance
into the story.</P>
<P>The romance that comes to this film, comes in a surprising way, as Roy
is trapped in Line's apartment when she comes home unexpectedly, and he
watches her nude as she goes to take a bath, but what she is really
doing is committing suicide. Roy saves her by reviving her and calling
for an ambulance, leaving the house before she knows that it was him
that saved her. There is a dark side to her that is now disclosed, she
is involved with a strong-arm thug, Georg (Per), who beat a security
guard senseless in a robbery and gave Line the money to hold for them.</P>
<P>As far as I am concerned, the film loses track of what it is capable of
doing at this point of the story, and it becomes a different film, where
one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story
suspenseful, with the buffoon-like Georg menacing Roy. Roy is now the
subject of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be viewed as a
suspense or romance yarn, or just as a plain comedy. Roy still acts with
the same deadpan expression, as a result, everything becomes muddled and
ridiculous. The laugh situations seem forced, the romance absurd, and
the suspense unreal.</P>
<P>At best, I found this film to be a modest effort at comedy, that results
in a modest film, barely being less than annoying, but redeemed by
showing me the darker side of Oslo, a side that I have not seen before
on screen. So I think that this first time director, who is guilty of
trying to come up with too many different twists to the story, and by
relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable, and a story
line that is very thin, has defeated the comic efforts that he was
successful with during the first part of the film, but by the end of the
film, wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy.</P>
