<PRE>                               HENRY & JUNE
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1990 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     This is the movie that forced the MPAA to create a new rating.
Maybe I'm just getting old, but I can't figure out *why*!  There is a
fair amount nudity in the movie, but the sex scenes are generally not
all that erotic.</P>
<P>     HENRY & JUNE is supposed to be the true story of Anais Nin & Henry
Miller, both famous writers.  The "June" in the title is Miller's wife,
June, a woman whose very picture alters the lives of characters in this
movie.  Perhaps it's the sort of movie that if you're a fan of either
writer, it works on the level of providing lots of background.  Since
I'm not, I didn't like the movie as much as I expected to.</P>
<P>     It really doesn't have much of a plot.  The movie follows Anais &
her husband Hugo, sort of '30s French yuppies, as they drift from place
to place and discuss that Anais will probably have an affair with an
older man.  Enter Henry Miller.  The relationships between Anais, Hugo,
and Henry are quite complicated.  Anais wants Henry, both as a fellow
writer and as a person who clearly enjoys sexual experimentation.  Henry
wants sex wherever he can get it, but he's very cautious around Anais.
Hugo pretty much ignores the situation, though it's clear he knows more
about it than Anais thinks he does.</P>
<P>     The performances are okay, but not much to write home about.  The
actress portraying Anais Nin is particularly good (a new, young Spanish
actress, playing Anais with a wonderful French accent).  The French
accents clash with the strong Brooklynese of both Fred Ward (playing
Henry Miller) and Uma Thurman (playing June).  With the exception of
Anais, the characters were in desperate need of charisma transplants to
pull this film off.  Kaufman has cast his movies very successfully in the
past, and I'm not sure why he didn't succeed this time (though Alec
Baldwin was originally supposed to have played Miller).</P>
<P>     The photography in this movie is lovely.  The point of view in this
movie wanders---many scenes are shot in mirrors, so it's a little
disconcerting at times.  The distinctions between dreams and reality are
not very well defined, which made reality a little difficult to follow.
The dialogue is fine, but the plot is *very* slow-going, and would have
benefited by a little tightening.  There are some good scenes, and
whenever June confronts someone, you know she often speaks the truth.
There are also a few lovely observations during the course of the movie
about sex and desire, and these observations are often quite subtle.</P>
<P>     On the whole, I can only give this movie a 6 on the Chuck scale.
The movie promises a lot but fails to deliver.  If you want to see a
truly erotic movie, go back and rent THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.
Kaufman did it right that time....</P>
<P>     While I don't think there are particular spoilers in this movie, I
suppose I ought to warn you just in case...</P>
<P>     Perhaps the main reasons for the new rating relate more to the
treatment of morality in the movie.  There is quite a bit of nudity in
the movie, both in a long parade of under-costumed art students, and in
several scenes in a brothel.  When Hugo tells Anais he'll do anything
sexual for her, she takes him to a brothel and they watch female
prostitutes perform sexually for each other.  When the prostitutes ask
them to join in, they decline.  While the lesbian aspect of the film has
been discussed quite a bit, the most explicit material is in the
afore-mentioned scene in the brothel.  And it really wasn't all that
erotic---the scene in LIGHTNESS when one woman photographs the other
was much more charged.</P>
<P>     While Anais spends most of the movie lusting after June, it's clear
nothing ever would have worked out between them.  Anais is a cultured
European, and June is a Brooklyn taxi dancer.  Anais is generally very
controlled, and June is just explosive.  June is portrayed as an
unbelievably manipulative bitch in this movie.  Henry is a somewhat
softer version of June, but he has the ability to be an artist,
something that June, even though she supports him, just doesn't
understand.</P>
