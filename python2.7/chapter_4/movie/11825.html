<PRE>"The Newton Boys" - Their Crime Is Our Punishment
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>The Newton Boys is the true story of the most successful gang of bank
robbers in American history.  Their stream of robberies lasted for
over two years in the early 1920s, and an intelligent leader helped to
keep them from being caught by the law.   Matthew McConaughey stars as
Willis Newton, who eventually enlists the services of his brothers to
help him pull off the robberies.  Waxing philosophic, he reasons that
the banks are crooks themselves, so they are just smaller thieves
stealing from bigger thieves.  He also wants the money to help pay for
an oil rig which, he hopes, will hold the key to his future once he
taps into the oil reserves that lie below.</P>
<P>His brothers include Jess (Ethan Hawke), who likes to live life on the
edge; Joe (Skeet Ulrich) whose innocence forces him to question
Willis' moral stance; and Doc, a lumbering loser of a sort who just
wants to be a part of anything that is criminal in activity.  Living
on a Texas ranch and in virtual poverty, the glitzy city life and the
potential riches convince the brothers to tag along with Willis.  The
final member is lovingly referred to as 'Glass' (Dwight Yoakum), a
long-time associate of Willis' who also has experience in setting off
explosives.  These men are all friendly, down-home folk who are
good-natured, not at all indicative of bank robbers.  But they are
good at what they do.  Willis leads the way and makes the plans, Glass
uses the explosives to break into bank safes, and the brothers are
assigned as lookouts.  No one ever gets hurt, and the money pours in.
They are not shy about spending their ill-gained loot, and even Willis
uses his new found wealth and innate charm to woo his future love,
Louise Brown (Julianna Margulies).</P>
<P>Eventually, two events begin to signal the demise of the Newton boys.
One is that new safes are being invented which are sturdier than ever.
The new safes make it virtually impossible for them to break in.
Robberies are now a lot riskier too since security has been
heightened.  Second, the oil rig goes bust.  All that has been
invested is lost, and now, they have to start over again.  But the
fabric of their familiar world is unraveling.  So, it's one last
heist, and the target is a federal mail train.  The risk is great, but
if they succeed, their reward will be an incredible $3 million. </P>
<P>But if you thought a movie about bank robbing would be characterized
by fun and guns, you'd better think again.  As an entertainment
vehicle, The Newton Boys moves as slowly as the mail train.  Playing
more like a pseudo-documentary, it slowly chugs along, and the movie
seems to meander from scene to scene, letting us hang out with the
boys, but never really pulling us into their family.  Even with guns
a-blazing, this movie is a dramatic lull.  One big problem is that the
characters are all pretty dull.  But a more inherent problem was that
the real life Newtons boys were very successful, whose skills
outmatched anything they faced.  They were smart enough to get away
with anything, and for the most part, they did.  Thus, there lacks the
element of adversity, energy, and excitement.  But if you do watch
this film, stay for the most interesting part which happens during the
end credits when we see an old interview with the real Willis Newton
on the Johnny Carson show and some home video footage of Joe Newton.
The Newton boys remained relatively obscure among the pantheon of
famous criminals.  Obscurity will befall this movie as well.</P>
