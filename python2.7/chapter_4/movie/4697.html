<PRE>                               BROKEN ARROW
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     If you get turned on by action, explosions, train derailments,
planes crashing and practically no dialogue, BROKEN ARROW is the film
for you.  For my part I cannot help but wonder why the newly
rejuvenated Travolta would be in a film so senseless that its whole
plot can be summed up in one sentence:</P>
<P>     A pilot on a B-3 Stealth bomber carrying two nuclear warheads
decides to blackmail the U. S. Government for millions of dollars or he
will blow up the bomb and put millions of people's lives in danger.
That's it.  That's the whole story.  Not what one would call subtle.
(Broken Arrow refers to the lost nuclear missile.)</P>
<P>     John Woo, who directed Van Damme in HARD TARGET, and has made many
action films, is just the man for this kind of film but you have to
like that kind of mayhem or you will find yourself laughing in the
theater's darkness at the utter absurdity of the stunts and action
happening up on the screen.</P>
<P>     John Travolta is the villain, Christian Slater is the hero,
Samantha Mathis is a park ranger who gets involved.  A lot of talent
wasted.</P>
