                       A film review by Eric C. Robinette

<PRE>"Yeah, that could happen."</PRE>
<P>I find myself saying that a lot at action movies. The funny thing about it
is that during Breakdown, I *meant* it when I said it.</P>
<P>Breakdown is that rarity: a fast, efficient, nuts-and bolts thriller that
is both fun and believable at the same time. It's mix of  Spielbergian
action and Hitchcockian suspense is so well constructed, that even when
the screws came a little loose toward the end, I happily hung on to my
seat as giant semi-truck teetered perilously over a bridge.</P>
<P>I must admit, when I first saw the trailers for the movie, I wasn't that
enthralled; it looked like a retread of "The Vanishing," which worked none
too well in it's American incarnation and was even a bit overrated in its
original form. In all these films, a man loses his significant other, then
sets on a seemingly futile pursuit populated by a lot of creepy-looking
people. </P>
<P>What sets Breakdown apart, though, is that it's story, unlikely as it
sounds, feels like it could really happen. Thanks go largely to Kurt
Russell, who has to carry the entire picture and make us believe that he's
an ordinary guy who can do extraordinary things when provoked. He does,
because he changes from concerned husband to avenging husband gradually,
showing the increasing desperation in his face as the bad guys close in on
him.</P>
<P>Kudos also go to first time helmer Jonanthan Mostow, who displays
surprising confidence in his debut. First-time directors often make the
mistake of blatantly copying their idol or having no style at all. Here,
Mostow deftly steals from two of the greats: Hitchcock and Spielberg. By
combining the suspense of Hithcock's "wrong place at the wrong time" theme
with the suspense of Spielberg's frenzied pacing, Mostow has created an
engrossing blend of realistic suspense and  kinetic action, which
complement each other and keep the picture down-to-earth. Even the
villains have a human dimension, with one caught between an unsuspecting
family and a despicable scheme, just like some real-world villains are.</P>
<P>Only at the end does Mostow lose his grip a little and the action become a
little too outlandish, but by then, I was so carried away, I didn't care.
A movie that can make something great out of such an average premise earns
the right to get carried away.</P>
