<P>Spy Kids  * * * out of * * * *
Starring: Carla Gugino, Antonio Banderas, Alex Vega, Daryl, Sabara, Alan 
Cumming, Teri Hatcher, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Mike Judge, Tony Shalhoub.
Directed by: Robert Rodriguez         
Rated: PG (mild violence)</P>
<P>After the genuinely repellent "family" comedy "See Spot Run"...I was starting 
to think that the good family movie genre was out. Alas "Spy Kids" opens and 
goes against all I just said, but it is the best family movie to come out in 
long time, and is the best time I had at the theaters so far this year. The 
young actors prove themselves worthwhile, and the adult actors are just as 
great.</P>
<P>Surprisingly from the man who directed violent movies such as "Desperado" and 
"From Dusk Till Dawn" there is barely any violence let alone blood or gore in 
this movie. Robert Rodriguez wrote, directed and produced this tale about two 
young kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who find out their parents (Carla Gugino, 
and Antonio Banderas) are international spies and have been kidnapped by an 
evil kids show host, who wants to take over the world. Of course the kids 
must take the action upon themselves and save their parents by using the 
nifty gadgets, spy equipment etc. </P>
<P>In the end the film is a rewarding experience worthy of multi viewings, and 
your kids and even yourself will find yourself loving this film. Young Alex 
Vega and Daryl Sabara (sister and brother characters) play Carmen and Juni 
Cortez, the two seem to be real life friends as they work great together and 
have a good onscreen chemistry. Carla Gugino (Snake Eyes) and Antonio 
Banderas (Desperado, Assassins) play the parents of the kids, and also have a 
surprising amount of strong chemistry between the two.</P>
<P>As for the supporting cast Alan Cumming (Spice World, and the current Josie 
and the Pussycats) plays the scheming bad guy and is a very good actor. He 
seems to be having fun as the bad guy, and some surprising information is 
given about him in the end. Teri Hatcher has a small role, and in her role 
she is deliciously diabolical and funny as well. Some other great cameos 
include many people from Rodriguez's earlier movies.</P>
<P>Rodriguez's cleverly written and witty script is that of a great one. His 
dialogue is snappy and comes quickly out of the actors/actresses's mouth. His 
plot is very easy for younger people to understand and follow, and has no 
sex, scatological humor, bloody/violence or even cussing. Only a mild amount 
of violence occurs in the film, and it's much nice to see this than some man 
falling out of a window with his pants off into dog poop.</P>
<P>"Spy Kids" is one of the funniest movies I've seen so far in the year 2001, 
and is the best kids movie so far. See it with your entire family, and even 
those who aren't fans of kiddy movies you might find yourself having a lot of 
fun with this one. A winner.</P>
