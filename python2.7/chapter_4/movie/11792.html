<PRE>The Newton Boys
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) This is the first Linklater movie that didn't look like one
(no angst-ridden gen-Xers in this one). It's also the first Linklater movie
that I haven't been pleasantly surprised with. I suspect there's a
correlation.  </P>
<P>THE NEWTON BOYS is Linklater's most mainstream and conventional effort so
far. It is the self-proclaimed "true story of the most successful bank
robbers in the history of the United States." Starring Matthew McConaughey,
Skeet Ulrich, and Ethan Hawke, this movie also has a pretty high hunk
quotient (about a .675, almost as high as "Young Guns"). </P>
<P>Willis Newton (McConaughey) hooks up with a couple of bank robbers who pull
a small job in the middle of nowhere. They ride into town in broad daylight
and make off with very little money before the local sheriff, in a
newfangled horseless carriage, shoots two of the three robbers. After Willis
escapes with his friend Glasscock (Dwight Yoakam, who is proving to be a
capable actor after his impressive debut in SLING BLADE), they talk about
what went wrong. </P>
<P>They agree that the idea of a daylight robbery is just plain stupid. A night
robbery would have been much easier and more successful. They decide to
prove their hypothesis by robbing a bank at night. Willis enlists the aid of
his brothers (Ulrich, Hawke, and Vincent D'Onofrio) and before long, they
are robbing banks left and right. </P>
<P>They are very successful. They rob at night, and they only attack banks they
know have square safes, which are susceptible to nitroglycerine explosives.
They are in and out before anybody can organize a posse. </P>
<P>Their luck runs out in Canada, when a bank that was supposed to have a
square safe has gone to the uncrackable round-fronted kind. Willis,
desperate to make SOMETHING from his trip to Canada, organizes an ambitious
attempt at a daylight robbery. The Newtons prove to be as good at daylight
robberies as Linklater is at mainstream movies. Out of their element, the
robbery goes bad and the boys are lucky to escape unharmed. </P>
<P>Glasscock and the Newtons realize that their bank robbing days are done
because everyone has gone to round safes (largely because of their success).
They are rich enough to retire, but they want one last big score. They
almost pull off a difficult train robbery, but can't quite make it work.
They mistakenly shoot one of their own men, payoffs to the Chicago mob
aren't made in time... before long they are all arrested. The movie ends
with the Newton boys getting light sentences because of their lovable
good-ole-boy demeanors. </P>
<P>Linklater seems very taken with the "real story" of the Newton Boys. At the
end of the film he reveals what really happened to each character after
getting out of prison. Even over the credits he includes documentary footage
of Willis Newton recounting his youth and of Johnny Carson interviewing Joe
Newton on "The Tonight Show." There is so much information on the real
Newton boys that it is distracting. </P>
<P>My first thought was that Linklater should have spent his energy making a
documentary. My second thought was that a more interesting movie might have
been made by someone who wasn't so taken with the real story. An adaptation
farther from the truth might have made a better movie. Here's why: </P>
<P>As interesting as their story is, it doesn't necessarily lend itself to film
- it doesn't have much of an ending. They go to jail, get out, and live to
old age. Not exactly an exciting denouement. It's an interesting fact but it
doesn't really cap the conflict of the rest of the film. </P>
<P>Also, there are too many characters that are too similar. Sure, each Newton
boy has a distinct personality, but their bank robbing careers are so
defining that their differences seem small by comparison. There is a slight
emphasis on Willis' character, but there is no single point of focus for the
film and the result is a movie that seems a little too even, a little too
flat. A bit more contrast might have been farther from the truth, but it
would have made a better movie. </P>
<P>I have no other complaints about THE NEWTON BOYS. There are even a few areas
that I'd praise. Linklater's fabricated and computer-generated prairie town
was surprising in it's realism and insignificance in the landscape. The
music consists of modern recordings of period jazz, an  interesting
approach, well-suited to this film. But overall, the movie failed to capture
my imagination. </P>
<P>Linklater is great at recording the pulse of his generation. He's a natural
with dialogue, self-discovery and angst.THE NEWTON BOYS gives him little
opportunity to do what he's good at. It's the kind of movie most anyone
could have directed, and it's too bad someone else didn't beat him to it.
Still, It looks like THE NEWTON BOYS was a labor of love for him, so perhaps
it's doesn't signal a permanent change in his style. We can only hope that
the director of SLACKER hasn't sold out.</P>
