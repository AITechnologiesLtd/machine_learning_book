<P>   Yuppies have been gloried by recent films as saviors of the
exploited ("Rainmaker") and depicted as brutal and scheming
("In the Company of Men").  Working class folks have been
portrayed as brutal and vulgar ("Nil by Mouth") and as saintly
guides to those with little hope of finding any job
("Twentyfourseven").  Robert Guediguian, who directed
"Marius and Jeannette" calling upon his own background in
Estaque, a poor, working-class district in the northern part of
Marseilles, is irresistibly sympathetic to his own class.  The
forty-five year old filmmaker put his own wife, Ariane
Ascaride, in the principal role to create a film which has
surprisingly garnered great attention in France, where three
million unemployed and a labor force increasingly anxious
about downsizing connect with a romantic fable of two lonely
people who find happiness with each other in a district only
four hours' train ride from Paris but light years away in
ambiance.  In one scene which takes place in a tony
restaurant, Guediguian portrays one professional couple as
an attractive but antiseptic pair whose conversation over wine
consists of comparing notes on debenture bonds.  The one
conspicuously working-class duo may have more anxieties
about the prices of this establishment but seem a lot happier--
just thrilled to be where they are.</P>
<P>   The Jeannette (Ariane Ascaride) and the Marius (Gerard
Meylan) of the story, who have the good fortune to meet each
other under less than favorable circumstances but develop a
solid bond, sometimes seem a mere background, as
Guediguian wants his viewers to capture the soul of a district
which few tourists will ever visit.  The neighborhood he
portrays may be poor, the houses shabby and in need of
paint, and the lodgings so close together that they seem
carved out of a large old home by an ambitious landlord.  But
the society of women who congregate on the stairs would not
have it any other way.  They love to chat about the men, just
as women probably do the world over, easing their jabs with
broad smiles as if to say that no matter what the faults of the
macho set, they're glad the males are around.  </P>
<P>   The folksy charm of the neighborhood, its ever-present hills
so typical of the colorful vicinities of Europe, is contrasted
favorably with the aseptic look of the huge supermarket where
Jeannette works as a low-paid cashier.  She is harassed
repeatedly by her boss for her failure to sit up straight as she
rolls the produce through the automated price machine, but
responds with unconcealed hostility just short of what would
get her fired.  When she has a mini-breakdown, getting on the
store microphone to exhort the customers to "buy everything--
create jobs--get useless things," she forfeits even the minimal
income she uses to support herself and her two lovely kids,
the pretty Magali (Laetitia Pescenti) and the playful Malek
(Miloud Nacer).  Caught by a guard, Marius (Gerard Meylan)
when she tries to steal paint from a cement plant, she returns
to her home, quite surprised to see this sentinel turn up
shortly thereafter with an offer to paint her house for free. 
The romance begins.</P>
<P>   Each time Guediguian gets us involved in the courtship, he
cuts away to illustrate the mood of the surroundings as the
women gather daily to commiserate, to laugh, and to trade
homespun philosophies. The most serious of the gang is a
sixty-ish individual who had spent time in a Nazi concentration
camp because of her communist leanings and, looking at the
economic status of capitalist France today decides that for the
most part her convictions were on the money.  One old guy,
Justin (Jacques Boudet), has been a long time dinner guest of
a woman he adores, who cooks beans for him and shares her
bottles of wine.  At one point Justin gives a couple of boys a
lecture on the evils of extremist thinking, calling
fundamentalists the sorts of people who want everyone to see
the world as a uniformly gray place.  The authenticity of the
actors is furthered by their unprofessional status.  These are
real, salt-of-the-earth people who seem more human than
those who make the political and economic decisions that
determine their fate.  The most humorous part of the film
arrives toward the end as Marius, for reasons made known
only later, suddenly leaves Jeannette, while the community
pitches in to get them together once again.</P>
<P>   "Marius and Jeannette" is one of those films that could be
described as pleasant enough, one without the originality that
critics are so fond of seeking, but Guediguian wears his heart
on his sleeve and has given us a tender, humorous and
sometimes biting commentary on the lives of the people with
whom he feels comfortable.  Not Rated.  Running time: 102
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
