<P>CLAY PIGEONS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Gramercy / 1:45 / 1998 / R (language, violence, nudity, sex)
Cast: Vince Vaughn; Joaquin Phoenix; Janeane Garofalo; Scott Wilson; 
Georgina Cates; Vince Vieluf; Gregory Sporleder 
Director: David Dobkin 
Screenplay: Matt Healy<HR>"Clay Pigeons" is really quite far from "Fargo" territory, so don't let 
its genre-bending mix of crime-drama and black comedy trick you into 
thinking otherwise. See, most of the memorable components that set Joel 
and Ethan Coen's lauded 1996 masterpiece in a category all by itself are 
missing here, from the genuine cleverness and droll sophistication of 
the writing to the down-home charm and unique essaying of the 
characters. About all "Clay Pigeons" has going for it is a macabre tone 
that's alternately straight-faced and smirky and an electric cast who 
collectively give more - much more - than the screenplay deserves. Take 
away those few not-quite-redeeming values and one is tempted to dub this 
movie "Nogo."</P>
<P>The story at least gets off to an interesting start, as dim gas station 
attendant Clay (Joaquin Phoenix) finds himself in hot water with his 
married sexpot lover (British actress Georgina Cates, doing great 
Midwestern trash) - her husband learned of their secret hanky-panky and 
killed himself, but not before making it look like murder and 
implicating Clay. "Pigeons" takes a turn for the worse, however, around 
the time the body count eerily starts to rise, a mystery that may or may 
not be related to a mysterious cowboy named Lester Long (Vince Vaughn) 
who drifts into the sleepy Montana burg and quickly befriends Clay. The 
FBI shows up hot on the trail of a serial killer, and it's then - quite 
late in the game - when the movie finally comes alive.</P>
<P>These flickers of greatness probably have something to do with Janeane 
Garofalo, whose turn as the cynical agent in charge of the 
investigation, at first doubting Clay and later helping him, is the best 
thing about "Pigeons." The precise moment she shows up, you can actually 
_hear_ the film improving; Garofalo may be her usual acidic, deadpan 
self, but her talents fit the role snugly and serve as a sardonic 
contrast when things get too silly. And things get too silly too often - 
as "Clay Pigeons" chugs towards its conclusion (which is completely 
ludicrous, by the way), a series of distracting plot holes and 
contrivances attempt to wrap things up, but all they really do is turn 
what once was a wildly unpredictable movie into a wildly convoluted 
mess. </P>
<P>Vaughn and Phoenix don't fare as well as their female co-star, though 
it's not their fault. Vaughn gives a vibrant performance, but no amount 
of animation could ever hide that Lester Long is a two-dimensional 
cartoon. Talk about not knowing what you have - this guy can create 
fireworks with a role that's up to his juicy comedic rhythms (see 
"Swingers"). Phoenix plays the straight man to Vaughn's court jester; 
he's supposed to be our tour guide through this topsy-turvy world, the 
guy we root for and sympathize with in spite of his flaws. If only David 
Healy's script hadn't made his flaws so glaring, that might've been 
possible. "Clay" the movie and Clay the man, then, are too much alike - 
dumb nogoodniks that just barely scrape by thanks to the aid of one 
sarcastic little lady.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' 
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything 
else." -Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
