A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Kinka Usher</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Neil Cuthbert</PRE>
<P>Starring: William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria, Paul
Reubens, Kel Mitchell, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Wes Studi, Claire Forlani</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this superhero spoof a team of seven inept wannabe heroes get their
chance to save "Champion City" when too-perfect resident superhero Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is captured by a mad scientist (Geoffrey Rush). The
bumbling "heroes" are: Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Bowler, The Blue
Raja, The Spleen, Invisible Boy, and The Sphinx, played by Ben Stiller,
William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria, Paul Reubens, Kel Mitchell,
and Wes Studi, respectively. </P>
<P>Mr. Furious is powered by "boundless rage." The Shoveler is a master at
shoveling. The Bowler argues with her father's skull, which is embedded in
a magical bowling ball. The Blue Raja wears entirely green clothing and is
a master at throwing forks. The Spleen was cursed by an old Gypsy woman to
become a creature of pure flatulence. Invisible Boy thinks he's invisible
when no one is looking. And the Sphinx spouts awful puns. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The heroes know where the bad guy lives. The bad guy knows where the heroes
hang out. From then it's just a matter of try, try, again, assaulting the
bad guy's lair throughout a number of bungled battles. Guess who wins the
last battle after the obligatory girlfriend capture? Sometimes going
overboard, MYSTERY MEN has fun with itself, satirizing the superhero genre
enough to keep the audience either snickering or groaning throughout the film.</P>
