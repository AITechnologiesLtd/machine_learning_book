<PRE>THE FIFTH ELEMENT (1997)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>    Making film in the science fiction genre is a risky proposal.  Not only
must a sci-fi movie hurdle over standard movie obstacles (acting,plot,etc.),
it also has to create a believable future that toys with both fantasy and
reality. "The Fifth Element" scores big in the latter, creating a movie with
dazzling special effects and costumes that would make Ridley Scott proud.
Unfortunately, a slightly muddy plot and other annoying quibbles keep this
film from achieving true sci-fi greatness.</P>
<P>    Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a cabbie/ex-military hero living in
23rd century New York.   Naturally, he's the only man that can save the
world from total destruction by recovering the "fifth element" (a "perfect"
woman) and  several other assorted stones.   Sound a little fishy?   It is.
During the first third of "The Fifth Element", little makes completely
comprehensible sense, director Luc Besson rather decides to impress the
audience with high quality special effects.   While the effects and design
are likely this movie's strongest point, this reviewer wanted a bit more
substance than flair.</P>
<P>    Two other elements detract from the quality of this movie.   The first -
Bruce Willis.   While Willis acts adequately, unfortunately he sticks to his
rock hard "Die Hard"-like persona (complete with tough attitude and cute
one-liners) a bit too much.   In addition, this reviewer never cared for
Chris Tucker, who plays a rather large role in the final third of this film.
His constant barrage antics soon became much more annoying than humorous.</P>
<P>    Even with these problems, "The Fifth Element" remains ahead of the
sci-fi pack.  The special effects, costumes (Gary Oldman's strange outfit
comes to mind), and other elements make for a captivating and wonderfully
detailed future.   In addition, the humor throughout the film was quite
entertaining.</P>
<P> In sum, while "The Fifth Element" is centuries away from being the next
"Blade Runner", it's an entertaining and solid film that is worth the price
of admission.</P>
<PRE>    Nick's Rating: +2 (Recommended)</PRE>
<P>    *** Movies rated from -4 (worst) to +4 (best), 0=average movie ***</P>
