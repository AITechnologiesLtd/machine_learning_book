<P>     TWO IF BY SEA has all the earmarks of a direct-to-video release 
that got a theatrical detour on its way to the local Blockbuster -- due 
entirely, no doubt, to the presence of Sandra Bullock.  I'm not sure 
exactly when this project went before the cameras (probably pre-SPEED), 
but it was obviously before Bullock's star soared into its current, high 
orbit. There's no other explanation why she would appear in something 
this wretched.  It's easily her worst film to date (and that includes 
LOVE POTION #9).</P>
<P>     TWO IF BY SEA tells the story of a pair thieves on the run, but 
Frank (Denis Leary) and Roz (Bullock) are definitely no Bonnie and 
Clyde.  They're stupid, incompetent, and dangerous only to each other.  
Fortunately for them, the pursuing lawmen, led by Yaphet Kotto's 
O'Malley, show similar IQ levels.  In fact, everyone in this movie is 
irredeemably dumb -- but, considering the level at which the script was 
written, that comes as no surprise.  TWO IF BY SEA is insulting to 
anyone who unwittingly sacrificed money to watch it.</P>
<P>     Frank and Roz' latest caper is to steal a $4 million Matisse 
painting from a private collector.  While waiting to sell the booty, 
they break into a posh mansion and camp out there for a few days.  One 
of the neighbors, the handsome, refined Evan Marsh (Stephen Dillane), 
becomes enamored with Roz, and, anxious to get her into bed, offers her 
a taste of "the good life".  All this happens while her relationship 
with Frank is rapidly sliding downhill.  </P>
<P>     The probable goal of TWO IF BY SEA is to provide a humorous, 
bittersweet look at how lasting love changes lives.  But this movie 
isn't funny, touching, or romantic.  It's a tremendous bore that 
constantly challenges audience members to stay seated.  What's 
surprising is that co-writer Leary, who is a comedian, could come up 
with such a singularly unappealing, flat script.  If you laugh more than 
once during the ninety-five minute running length, you'll have my total 
beaten.  </P>
<P>     Sandra Bullock's star quality has saved commonplace movies like 
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING and THE NET.  However, miscast and uttering 
lines from a horrendous screenplay, there's nothing she can do for TWO 
IF BY SEA.  She's not exactly bad, but her performance never transcends 
a certain level of mediocrity.  Worse still, she and Leary never 
connect.  There's no romantic spark, and it's hard to believe that their 
characters are (or have ever been) in love.  Then there are the so-
called "Boston" accents, which fade in and out, and sound exactly like 
someone not from Boston trying unsuccessfully to pretend that they are.</P>
<P>     TWO IF BY SEA has a drab, dreary tone that's due as much to the 
unenthusiastic performances as to the bland direction.  If anyone was 
having fun making this film, it doesn't come across.  STAR WARS' gold 
droid C3P0 had more humanity than all of TWO IF BY SEA's characters 
combined.  Because I never cared about Frank or Roz, the "feel good" 
ending left me cold.  And, to think, I wasted over an hour and a half in 
a theater with this movie when I could have been outside shoveling 
snow...</P>
