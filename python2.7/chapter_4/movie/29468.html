<PRE>AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>An American Rhapsody offers us an example of teen acting gone
marvelously right.  As a 15-year-old who wants to rediscover her
Hungarian roots, Scarlett Johansson portrays the thrill and frustration
of being a teenager so perfectly that I don't ever want her to grow
up.   And her voice, with its cracked rage, only makes her desire to get
control in her life sound more convincing.</P>
<P>When Johansson (Ghost World) is on screen, An American Rhapsody has a
riveting passion and dramatic urgency that is found nowhere else in the
movie, which is based on director/screenwriter's Éva Gárdos life. 
Johansson's character, Suzanne, is left behind in Hungary as an infant
when her family stealthily moves to America circa 1950.  Six years
later, the young Suzanne is finally brought to America, where she joins
her parents, Margit and Peter (Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn) and
her older sister (Mae Whitman).  However, Suzanne is torn away from the
parents (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi and Balázs Galkó) of a family friend who
nurtured and protected her from government suspicion.</P>
<P>Suzanne has trouble fitting in with a world of hula-hoops and
hamburgers, running away several times.  At 15, she is still fleeing,
only this time to smoke cigarettes, make out, and dabble in other forms
of teenage rebellion.  This doesn't sit well with Margit, who soon
results to locking Suzanne in her bedroom.  When Suzanne finds a shotgun
in her closet and starts blasting away at her locked bedroom door, she
decides that a trip to Hungary will set things straight.</P>
<P>Until Johansson appears, the proceedings dawdle.  Gárdos, a longtime
film editor, spends too much time setting up the movie's powerful final
stretch.  A fascinating array of characters gets left in limbo, and a
load of potential powerhouse dramatic moments get ignored.  Margit, who
has come from an obviously wealthy upbringing, finds herself working as
a waitress and writing letters to anyone who could bring Suzanne to
America.  Peter, who dreams of running a publishing house in America,
ends up building airplanes.  Gárdos doesn't show how the couple reacted
to such a sudden social shift without their little girl.  There had to
be nights of terse bedroom conversations, quiet sobbing and
reassurances.  </P>
<P>And what about Margit's mother (Ágnes Bánfalvy), who spends time in
prison for protecting her family, including Suzanne?  Late in the movie,
she tells Suzanne she endured the time behind bars by thinking of fairy
tales to tell her grandchildren.  With a more experienced director (this
is Gardos' feature film directing debut), the possibilities for showing
the grandmother's distraction could have been fascinating.</P>
<P>The movie works best when Johansson is onscreen.  Scenes involving the
six-year-old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz-Banlaki) are also wonderful. 
There's not an ounce of stage mother gusto in her performance.  And
Gardos does craft some nice moments in her film where the pursuit of the
American dream tears at your roots.  A scene when Endresz-Banlaki calls
Kinski "lady" as she's tucked in is hard to forget.</P>
<P>Most of the movie, unfortunately, lacks emotional power.  America is a
nation of immigrants -- we all know stories of how our families made
sacrifices to get here.  In a movie about immigrants' pluck and grit, a
director can't just focus on a settling story.  We've heard that
before.  He or she must take pains to hit on a human level.  Gardos
sporadically does that in An American Rhapsody, but fortunately there's
enough evidence here to support she will be more accurate in the future.</P>
