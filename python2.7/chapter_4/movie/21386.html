<P>NOTE: Ordinarily, Moviereviews.org will not give away any critical plot 
points of a film that could be interpreted as "spoilers." However, being 
that Music of the Heart is based on a true story and that 
Moviereviews.org feels the film can not be properly credited without 
such revelations, plot giveaways will appear in the following review. If 
this bothers you, please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop 
reading now.</P>
<P>"What does it take to play Carnegie Hall? Practice."</P>
<PRE>-Unknown</PRE>
<P>It takes two hours for Music of the Heart to "play Carnegie Hall," both 
figuratively and literally. Like the children it portrays, the movie 
starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a 
show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall.</P>
<P>Roberta Guaspari (Academy Award winner Meryl Streep) has two kids, a 
husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the 
Mediterranean. Her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when 
she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an 
East Harlem elementary school. She soon finds her job is on the rocks as 
the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors. That is 
the pattern-like plot of this production. Ultimately, the film chooses a 
zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an 
all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish.</P>
<P>The first hour of Music of the Heart is rather painful. Roberta's 
character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat. Also 
lacking depth is the film's "bad guy," a narrow-minded music teacher 
(Josh Pais) who rejects Roberta out of principle (the movie never 
explains exactly which principle that is) and conveniently comes and 
goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a 
villain around.</P>
<P>The next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre. They are highlighted by 
one child's return to Roberta's class (coming after the great old 
Hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because 
"My mom said...") and a glowing concert. Not knowing the running time, 
you may expect the credits to role at this point. But they don't. 
Instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad 
to mediocre to excellent.</P>
<P>Director Wes Craven, known for his works of horror, uses some old 
sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing. One romantic break up 
scene is highlighted by the classic "But... last night..." and 
Roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single 
mother regarding their father's absence.</P>
<P>The city of Harlem plays a strong role in the movie. Roberta's mother 
is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and 
the film does nothing to combat that stereotype. The noise tracks for 
these scenes are dominated by sirens; predictably one of Roberta's 
students is gunned down and killed off screen.</P>
<P>One thing the film does lack is subtlety. The fact that a little boy was 
playing "We Shall Overcome" on his violin after the aforementioned 
shooting was a cute and discreet reference. The fact that the entire 
orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone 
reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience. (Of 
course, in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments 
are meant to be overdone, so perhaps he too is just learning to play the 
game.)</P>
<P>Even with all its flaws, Music of the Heart is a beautiful film. That is 
not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning. But as I watched the 
scenes in Carnegie Hall, I thought of some of the great acts that have 
taken that stage. In December of 1979 a comedian named Andy Kaufman put 
on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in 
theatre history. The performance included a dead-on Elvis impression, 
Robin Williams in disguise and a moment at the end when Kaufman 
announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies. So, 
how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life? He had a 
character named Tony Clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of 
irritating and angering the audience. Perhaps it is okay for Music of 
the Heart to start off rusty because just as Kaufman had Santa's 
favorite food, this movie has an amazing finale.</P>
