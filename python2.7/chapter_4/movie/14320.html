<P>There's something about "making it" - raking in hundreds upon thousands
of dollars all at once - that will drive people to play incredible odds.
Average people will visit casinos, buy lottery tickets and scratch
games, enter drawings, and bet on sports teams all to make "easy" money.
That's precisely the bet that Director John Dahl (THE LAST SEDUCTION) is
counting on to pay off in his new poker drama, ROUNDERS. And, for the
most part, it does. Minus a few temporary flaws, ROUNDERS is an
enjoyable and occasionally witty look at card-playing, life, and man's
obsession with money. </P>
<P>Our star and hero - if he can be called that - is Mike McDermott (Matt
Damon). Mike's a good kid who's going to law school on a tuition that's
paid by his fantastic ability to win money at poker. He tells us early
on that he's a 'rounder': someone who doesn't always go for the big
money but grinds it out, one small bet at a time. Seemingly against his
own advice, however, he loses all his money in one shot to a ruthless
Russian gambler and hustler named Tony KGB (John Malkovich). Mike gives
up poker, but it's not long before the devil's advocate walks in. In
this case, it's Mike's friend Worm (Edward Norton), who's just out of
jail and fifteen large in the red. </P>
<P>Mike decides to take up poker again to help Worm earn back his debt, but
Worm's a pathological card sharp who can't hold on to money long enough.
Both of the characters here are well-written and well-acted from the
start, which makes their story all the more believable. Damon's brought
charm and impressiveness to every feature he's been in since last year's
THE RAINMAKER, and although he doesn't top his Academy Award-nominated
performance in GOOD WILL HUNTING, he's still fun to watch here. He's
clearly a good guy, and the audience is cheering for him all the way.
Norton, as Worm, adds a lot of nuance to the character that encourages
hate and like at the same time. His wit is over the top, and
convincingly so. </P>
<P>There's no mistaking one fact, however: ROUNDERS is a poker movie, and
Dahl decides to keep it almost exclusively so. Money is the real
motivator, but poker is used as a concrete front for it. Five cards and
chin-high stacks of colored chips are the only reason anyone does
anything in this movie. The script attempts to have Damon do some
voice-overs that explain some of the various poker games, but the action
is so vivid onscreen that anyone without prior understanding of the game
won't gain any knowledge. Some of the supporting roles were also written
in with an unfitting lack of gusto - such as Mike's girlfriend Jo
(Gretchen Mol); she's got no depth and we have no idea why Mike keeps
coming back to her. Martin Landau's law professor also provides some of
the movie's slower moments, but his screen time is minimal. For the
majority of its running time, ROUNDERS is an exciting and worthwhile
feature to watch, and against the competition in a paltry post-summer
season, it comes up all aces.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "ROUNDERS": 3.0 stars - a good movie</P>
