Men of Honor</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Though racist mentalities (and other obstacles) constantly try to put a 
stop to Cuba's undying determination to become a master chief diver; in 
the spirit of the Energizer bunny ... Cuba just keeps going and going 
and going. </P>
<P>The title "Men of Honor" fades onto the screen over tremendous waves at 
high sea. As the waves topple, the brass instruments blare ... 
foretelling the melodrama to follow. It's a bit of a hokie film, but 
compelling nonetheless. </P>
<P>Headbutting a couple of Navy MP's in the introductory sequence, De Niro 
wastes no time in taking command of the screen. His character is rich 
with unpredictability, honor, and rebellion. And of course, he's an 
awesome actor. Cuba's character, on the other hand, offers little 
surprise after he grows from a boy into a man who simply will not run 
out of battery power until he achieves Navy diver's highest rank. Cuba's 
acting is very good, but forever in De Niro's shadow. </P>
<P>Michael Rapaport, who's been in just about every release this year 
(seems like), Forest Gumps his way into this one as the only white 
trainee who sympathizes with Cuba. </P>
<P>I might have really loved this picture save for one too many jammed 
pulleys. There's also a problem of motivation in one tavern "tough guy 
to tough guy" scene. Cuba had just learned of some very sad news that 
prompted him to call the woman he fancied. While waiting for her to 
arrive, Charlize Theron shows up and coaxes him into the tavern conflict 
with a simple line or two. Seems to me, a man of Cuba's conviction 
wouldn't risk it all so easily. Perhaps a few moments were cut, leaving 
a gap in believability. </P>
<P>Lastly, the film ends with text when it should have ended with images. 
That said, "Men of Honor," based on the life of Carl Brashear, is still 
a big movie with big acting, beautiful production work and 
kick-in-the-pants inspiration. </P>
