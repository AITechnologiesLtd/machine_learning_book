<P>   I recently read an article which (believe it or not) contends
that teenagers as a whole in the U.S. are confident, stable, and
by the usual standards, mature.  You'd never know this from the
way movies portray adolescents, but then again you don't want to
see a movie about a teen who is confident, stable and mature, do
you?  Since it's easier to find real life teens who are disturbed
than to unearth situations in which helicopters are shot down and
cars plow into Chinatown vegetable stands, a movie like "L.I.E."
can be touching.  Nowadays so many young people are
emotionally or physically discarded by their parents (like Steven
Spielberg's David) that we can  believe kids--whether products of
crowded cities or capacious suburbs--get screwed up.  Larry
Clark mined this territory with his incisive "Kids," about big city
youth who deflower virgins and otherwise make trouble, picking
up steam in his current offering "Bully," about how a group of
boys and girls treat a tormentor with extreme prejudice rather
than simply try to reason with him.</P>
<P>   Michael Cuesta's "L.I.E.," which enjoyed a debut at the recent
New Directors, New Films festival in New York, probes the mind
of a 15-year-old, Howie Blitzer (Paul Franklin Dano), who has
been physically abandoned by his mother (she died in a car
accident) and both physically and emotionally deserted by his
dad.  Cuesta, using a screenplay he wrote together with Stephen
M. Ryder and Gerald Cuesta, employs as his metaphor the
world's biggest parking lot known as the Long Island
Expressway.  The L.I.E., which takes people east and west and
sometimes "straight to hell" as Howie puts it, is both a connection
to the outside world for the young resident of New York's Suffolk
County and, for the people it killed like his mother, the songwriter
Harry Chapin and film director Alan J. Pakula, a final destination.</P>
<P>   "L.I.E." takes off by showing the 15-year-old chilling out with his
friends, the sorts that only a mother could love, inluding the
spaced out Gary (Billy Kay) who makes a buck supplying sex to
drivers who stop for him just by a sign that says "Welcome to
Long Island."  Under Gary's influence, Howie sneaks with his
pals into homes and steals money, jewelry, and in one case a
pair of valuable antique guns. When the owner of the residence
with antique guns, Big John Harrigan (Brian Cox)--whose license
plate "B.J." carries with it a double-entendre--almost catches
Howie, ripping a piece of his jeans from the boy's leg, John
coasts around the neighborhood look for the kid with the
damaged jeans like a prince searching for Cinderella.  When
John at several points sniffs the blue swatch that he has literally
ripped off as though it were infused with Chanel No. 5, we're
tipped that the man may be a pederast.</P>
<P>   Cuesta shows his two principals as complex characters, a
welcome change from the sort of melodramatic Hollywood fare
that  separates the white hats from the black.  For his part,
John seeks sexual action at his favorite pit stop on the L.I.E.
even as he boards his lad du jour in his messy home.  At
the same time, though, he takes terrific care of his prey.  When
Howie, whose real estate developer dad is busted by the F.B.I.
thereby leaving Howie with an empty house, John takes him in
and lovingly cooks a lavish breakfast which the boy gobbles up
hungrily.  Howie is himself a mixed bag, a housebreaker who is
at the same time a poet--not only spinning out verse of his own
but spouting memorized lines from the works of Walt Whitman as
he does in a particularly tender moment while sitting next to John
and driving the big man's car.</P>
<P>   Though the end provides a dramatic payoff which is not
sincerely earned, Cuesta scores with "L.I.E." thanks to the
work of Brian Cox, a performer who has appeared in
everything from Royal Shakespeare company productions and
feature films like "Braveheart"  to roles in challenging indie fare
like "Rushmore" and "The Boxer."  In Howie's role, Paul
Franklin Dano has stepped off the Broadway stage to turn in a
convincing portrait of a mixed-up kid who learns quite a bit about
himself in his relationship with the kind pederast.  Romeo
Tirone's surreal images of the Long Island Expressway provide
us with the picture's mood, one of frenzied people going east and
west and getting nowhere.</P>
