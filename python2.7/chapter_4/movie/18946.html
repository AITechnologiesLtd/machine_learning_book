<PRE>Down to the Sea in Ships (1922)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 57</PRE>
<P>This age of this early silent feature is apparent
from its company credits.  It was produced by the
Whaling Film Corporation (probably not a major
studio even in those days), and was distributed
by Wholesome Film Services.  It was filmed on
location at New Bedford, Massachussets.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the storyline involves whaling.
Set in mid-19th century New Bedford, conservative
Quaker Morgan (William Walcott) forbids his daughter
Patience (Marguerite Courtot) to marry Dexter
(Raymond McKee), because Dexter is a miller and
has never harpooned a whale.  Meanwhile, villainous
Finner (Pat Hartigan) schemes to pirate Morgan's
whaling ship, and for good measure marry his
creepy bookkeeping partner Siggs (J. Thornton Baston)
to Patience.</P>
<P>At this point, the experienced viewer wonders
how the inevitable plot convolutions will work
to foil the plans of Finner and Siggs, and transform
Dexter into an accomplished whaler so that he can
wed Patience, thereby tying all the loose ends into
a happy ending.  This is done in predictable
fashion, but there are some interesting scenes
as a whale is hunted and subsequently slaughtered.</P>
<P>The maritime industry of New Bedford had
already seen its best days by 1922, and this
film captures the tail end of the whaling era.
The film salutes the cameramen (A. G. Penrod and
Paul H. Allen) in the opening credits "who,
in small boats, stood by their cameras at the
risk of their lives to photograph the fighting
whales".</P>
<P>"Down to the Sea in Ships" also marks the
inauspicious film debut of a seventeen-year-old
Clara Bow.  She plays the 'mischievous'
younger daughter of Morgan, and is a stowaway
on the whaling ship.</P>
