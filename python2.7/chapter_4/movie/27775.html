<P>April may be the cruelest month, but from January on the cruelty of 
bad movies dominates the screen. Summertime is overwhelmingly for 
schoolchildren of all ages, from 10 to 50 -- with inane action, 
pallid romances, and flat comedies. The "good" season,  from fall 
through December, shows the best of a bad lot plus the better stuff 
of potential Oscar candidates. Year-round small salvations may come 
from some foreign movies as well  as from American rookie (or 
not-too-commercial) filmmakers.</P>
<P>The non-story of Head Over Heels comes from about six writers whose 
right hands did not know what the left ones were doing.  If those 
fellows ever got together it must have been by e-mail only.</P>
<P>In this flick, Amanda is a talented paintings restorer in New York's 
Metropolitan Museum. She's devoted to her work, but her boyfriends 
are not devoted to her. Catching the latest one in bed with a new 
girl, she moves to the upscale apartment shared with four 
super-(almost) models. The rent is a dirt-cheap $500, but then her 
room turns out to be a closet. However, there's the adjoining huge, 
luxurious space with shelves and amenities for clothes, shoes, hats, 
perfumes and other tools of the trade.</P>
<P>So far so good. But past the opening sequences the film plunges as if 
attempting suicide. In that building Amanda meets tenant Jim as he 
takes for a walk a huge Great Dane. (It belongs to someone 
immobilized in bed.) An elevator door opens, out come Jim and Hamlet 
(the hound) who breaks away and throws himself amorously on the girl, 
if you get my drift. The gag, linguistically and physically, is very 
broad. Perhaps one of the writers was thinking that Great Danes go 
for great dames.</P>
<P>Jim is in the fashion trade but nothing is specified about this  --or 
anything else-- in this vaguer and vaguer picture. His apartment 
faces the five women's, its windows are never curtained or draped. A 
veritable fishbow for the ladies' eyes.  Amanda, egged on by her four 
matchmaking housemates, quickly falls for Jim. He  who responds, but 
so awkwardly, lamely, unclearly that the movie keeps losing its 
interest exponentially.</P>
<P>All that is supposed to be funny and humorous. It is not. It's not 
even cute. The writers sleepwalk through the non-plot. Unable to 
invent anything, they opt for a bad clone of Hitchcock's "Rear 
Window." As the he five Peeping Tomasinas (Amanda & Co.) spy on Jim, 
they see something vague which makes them think that Jim has murdered 
a woman. The girls now sleuth  in a series of stupid,  disconnected 
scenes and events. I'll stop here.</P>
<P>Of course you've guessed already that the girls are wrong, that 
Amanda and Jim are fated to kiss -- and tell. In his telling there's 
a major twist which is  unbelievable and terribly handled.</P>
<P>What holds a smidgen of interest in the caricature (or is it a 
faithful rendition?) of the four models. They are airheads, 
uncultured, even idiotic. Their life revolves around fashion, sex 
with the improper stranger, ornaments, plastic surgery, money.and 
such. It's La Dolce Vita, Gotham-style. Their language is salty but 
not colorful, their vocabulary, basic. The gags and jokes are 
repetitiously recycled. They range from inane to tired, from 
feeble-inded  to scatological.</P>
<P>When the girls are all hiding together in a lavatory 's cubicle 
(don't ask) to the tune of disgusting body noises the toilet erupts 
like a volcano and covers the ladies from head to toe with an 
accumulation of thick, stinking, brown... let's call it lava.</P>
<P>You get the clear feeling that, at five-minute intervals the 
flickmakers are wondering  "where do we go next?"</P>
<P>Amanda (Monica Pierce) is a pallid presence, though occasionally a 
pleasant one. The housemates are characterless yet irritating. In 
real life,  sane persons of any sexual preference would put them in 
an address-book under the rubric "Avoid at any cost."</P>
<P>Jim (Freddie Prinze) is so bland that it ought to be forbidden by law.</P>
