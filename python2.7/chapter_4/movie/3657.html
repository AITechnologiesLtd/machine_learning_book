<PRE>                                    CASPER
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Universal/Amblin's new live-action version of CASPER is
considerably more entertaining than it has any right to be.  While the
film suffers from a nearly incoherent story, it does contain some
clever ideas, a lot of laughs, eye-popping visuals, and appealing
performances by Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman.</P>
<P>     From the beginning, a live-action film based on the "Casper
the Friendly Ghost" cartoon series and comic books seems like a strange
idea.  While film adaptations of older TV series are popular right now,
CASPER doesn't immediately generate the strong feelings of positive
nostalgia that helped projects like THE FLINTSTONES or THE ADDAMS
FAMILY.  The project is further hampered by the fact that there just
isn't all that much to the source material.  It is an awfully thin
basis for a full-length movie.</P>
<P>     Surprisingly, though, the filmmakers almost pull it off.  I
suspect that the visual-effects potential is a large part of what
attracted Amblin to this project.  Many members of the Industrial Light
and Magic team that worked on JURASSIC PARK, including supervisors
Dennis Muren and Michael Lantieri, also work on CASPER.  The illusion
created for the ghosts is so believable that it seems absolutely
effortless.  After the initial "wow" factor wore off, I found that I
stopped even thinking about the fact that they *were* special effects.
I was completely caught up by the illusion.</P>
<P>     Some may object to the fact that the design of the ghosts is
essentially the same as the cartoon series.  At first the cartoon-like
designs are a bit jarring in a live-action film, but I quickly grew
used to it.  In the long run, I think the familiarity of the design
serves the film well.  A large part of the success of the visuals comes
from the fact that the ghosts seamlessly interact with the human
characters and live-action props (using many of the techniques
pioneered in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT).  This interaction helps the
audience to easily lose the impression of watching cartoon characters.</P>
<P>     While the film is fun to watch, the script turns out to be both a
strength and a liability.  Writers Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver are
veterans of Amblin's "Tiny Toons Adventures" and "Animaniacs" TV
series.  That background does tend to be reflected in the film, which
sometimes seems like a cartoon short stretched out to nearly two hours.
The movie has some very clever sequences and some very funny dialog and
slapstick.  The plot doesn't really hold together, though.  It seems
like a strung-together collection of scenes rather than a coherent
whole.</P>
<P>     Like many of the recent TV series adaptations, CASPER is seriously
overplotted.  The main plot involves Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty), a
rich woman who inherits the mansion haunted by Casper and his three
obnoxious cousins.  She believes that there is treasure hidden in the
mansion, but the ghosts keep her from getting close enough to search.
She eventually hires "ghost therapist" Dr. Harvey (Pullman) who moves
into the mansion with his daughter Cat (Ricci).  As Cat befriends
Casper and Dr. Harvey tries to calm the obnoxious cousins, Carrigan and
her associate Dibs (Eric Idle) try to find the treasure.</P>
<P>     This plot is further complicated by several subplots.  Some of
them include Cat planning a school dance to be held at the mansion and
Kat helping Casper to use a resurrection machine originally invented by
his father to bring him back to life.  There are a few too many plots
here and they don't all manage to come together cleanly.  At times,
Stoner and Oliver introduce plot elements that they eventually just
abandon.  The most blatant example is an unclear prank that a couple of
Cat's classmates are trying to engineer.  It was never clear exactly
*what* they had intended.</P>
<P>     Despite this overall incoherence, there are a lot of individual
scenes that really *do* work.  Many of the jokes do manage to find
their mark and the writers wisely include a fair share of jokes aimed
at the adults in the audience.  They even manage a few clever and
unpredictable twists that are quite welcome.  The final fate of
Moriarty's character is particularly unexpected.</P>
<P>     The film does attempt to explore a few serious themes with some
surprisingly effective results.  There are several scenes where Kat
tries to help Casper to remember what he was like when he was alive.
These are quite well played and really do generate some dramatic
interest.  The film even manages a tasteful scene that explains how
Casper died.  There are also a few well- played scenes involving Dr.
Harvey trying to get past the death of his wife. This eventually leads
to an exceptionally satisfying conclusion late in the film.</P>
<P>     There is one issue that the film conspicuously ignores.  There are
a number of references to the concept that ghosts are spirits that have
been unable to "cross-over" due to unfinished business.  This issue
comes into play several times, but there are never any discussions of
what unfinished business is keeping Casper around.  Certainly,
resolution of that would have hurt the chances for a sequel, but it
should have at least been *discussed*.</P>
<P>     In MERMAIDS and both of the ADDAMS FAMILY films, Christina Ricci
managed to steal virtually every scene she was in.  She gives another
really strong performance here.  She is an extremely likable performer
and she is able to bring a lot even to this kind of cartoonish role.
I'd love to see what she would do with a more complex role.</P>
<P>     Bill Pullman has been a very solid character actor for many years
and he is good here as well.  He isn't given much to do, but he does a
lot with what he is given.  The combination of this film and WHILE YOU
WERE SLEEPING might help to increase his marketability as an actor.</P>
<P>     The rest of the performances are competent, but not particularly
inspired.  Moriarty is playing basically the same role she has played
in numerous other films and is also allowed to go a little too far over
the top here.  Eric Idle isn't given a great deal to do, but he still
manages to be pretty funny.</P>
<P>     First time director Brad Silberling does a competent job and
manages to generally keep the pace up.  As might be expected here, the
direction does seem to favor the visual effects over the acting (as
particularly evidenced in the supporting roles).  James Horner provides
a decent (but not particularly original) musical score.  The film does
make the mistake of never playing a straightforward version of the old
TV series' theme song (a version performed by Little Richard does play
over the end credits).</P>
<P>     By no means is CASPER a great film, but it is certainly a lot
better than it might have been.  The film doesn't make a heck of a lot
of sense, but it a lot of fun and I left the theater with a big smile
on my face.</P>
