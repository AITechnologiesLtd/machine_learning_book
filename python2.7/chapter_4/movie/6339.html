<PRE>                              THE DOOM GENERATION
                       A film review by Will FitzHugh
                        Copyright 1996 Will FitzHugh</PRE>
<P>This is billed 'A Heterosexual Film by Gregg Araki' who I gather has made
some low-budget homosexual films which I haven't seen.  This one is a charming
coming-of-age piece.  At least charming when compared to any other movie that
features blood-splattered convenience store robberies, motel-room sex and
various psychotic characters met in cheesy retail stores.  The main characters,
Jordan and Amy, are two love-struck punkers ('three months' Jordan says
reverently when asked how long they've been going out) who get caught up in
a whirlwind escape from the law after they meet up with Xavier, a slightly
twisted guy who gets them out of tight spots by blowing people away.  One
bit of sample dialog should give you the flavor:<P></P>
<PRE>        Jordan:  What's your name?
        Xavier:  Xavier.
        Jordan:  That's kind of complicated.  Can I just call you X?
        Xavier:  OK.  If I can call you Nut-licker.
        Jordan:  OK.</PRE>
<P>You get the idea.  Kind of like a John Hughes movie but with sex, violence and
bad language.  Everything's very stilted.  I assume it's on purpose.  As David
St. Hubbins said, it's a fine line between stupid and clever, but this film
refuses to accept that and blurs them together entirely.  Heidi Fleiss has a
cameo.  Araki pays homage to 'Easy Rider' by having our gang brutalized by
redneck nazis at the end.  Good double bill with 'Half Cocked' if they ever
come out on video.</P>
<P>I saw this movie alone but it could be good for a date if you want to test
his/her reaction to things generally considered vile.  Might as well initiate
the discussion of bodily fluids as soon as possible in a relationship.  You're
gonna have to deal with them anyway, right?</P>
