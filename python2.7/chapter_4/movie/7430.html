<P>ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is definitely one of the most memorable
films of recent years.  Absolutely brilliant performances are turned in 
by many, although Jack Nicholson's role as Randle Patrick McMurphy stands 
out more than any.  McMurphy is a seemingly common man who just cannot
keep himself out of trouble.  In addition, Louise Fletcher's portrayal as
the evil Nurse Ratched is outstanding.  Moreover, the supporting cast is
full of familiar names in their very early roles, including Christopher
Lloyd (his first appearance ever) and a young Danny DeVito, both
performing as mental patients.  </P>
<P>ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a very convincing look into the lives
and events of mental patients and the different world that takes place
behind closed doors of a mental institute.  Milos Forman turns in an
extremely wonderful directorial performance in his first award winning
movie, and, in fact, only the third American movie he directed.  The film
is also a rebellious film, in which Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy,
leads a "peasant uprising" against the cruel ways of the current
leadership, headed up by Nurse Ratched.  Until McMurphy arrives, the
mental patients do not so much as think to question the authority.  But
that all changes once McMurphy steps in.</P>
<P>On his most recent prison sentence, McMurphy formulates a plan.  His plan?
Pretend that he is insane so that he can get out of doing the standard
prison work.  Apparently, though, his performance is a little too
convincing.  He is sent to a mental hospital and admitted as a patient.
The head doctors of the institute examine and question him.  He is direct
to admit that he may do things that seem "crazy", but he definitely does
not belong in the mental institute.  Alas, the doctors feel that he does,
indeed, belong as a patient, and he is admitted.  Once inside, he is
subjected to the life that is led.  The rules are strictly followed and
the type of activity that McMurphy enjoys is condemned.  </P>
<P>Of course, McMurphy cannot bear to live his life this way, and he bends
the rules every way that he can.  This includes testing Nurse Ratched's
authority and patience every way he can, as well as setting up his own
small "gambling casino" in the washroom.  This does not last long, for
once McMurphy makes away with everyone's cigarettes (the currency), Nurse
Ratched closes his operation.  McMurphy also attempts to befriend Chief, a
very large Indian who is a patient at the hospital.  Chief is "a deaf dumb
Indian who can't say a word" according to the other patients, but McMurphy
is intent on teaching him, to begin with, how to play basketball.  He
teaches him well, for when the patients and workers organize a game, Chief
steals the show.  Chief also assists McMurphy in escaping.  McMurphy
decides to steal the bus and take the group for "a ride".  Once McMurphy
picks up a female friend, he takes the bus to a shipyard where he
convinces watchman that the men are a group of doctors from the mental
institute.  In a very memorable scene, each rather convincing "doctor" is
introduced.  The group then takes a boat for a fishing trip.</P>
<P>McMurphy gets his second strike against him when he gets into a rumble
with a few of the attendats, and he then receives ECT therapy.  But the
third, and most devestating strike occurs when McMurphy decides to host a
little "get together" inside the hospital one night.  The consequences of
this are devestating and lead to a very emotional ending.</P>
<P>ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a marvelous, sensational film that will
be long remembered as a film about a courageous man who changes the lives
of a group of mental patients and is not afraid to stand up to authority.
Definitely worthy of the many awards that it and it's cast and crew
members received, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST should not be missed.</P>
