<P>Never before have the great Bard's words sounded more clunky than here
in Michael Hoffman's (One Fine Day) screen adaptation of Shakespeare's
whimsical romance.  What the Puck happened?</P>
<P>You can't blame the story – it's a classic.  But why does it take a full
60 minutes for Hoffman's script to really get moving?  You can't blame
the production crew (featuring Oscar winners for Howards End and The Age
of Innocence) – they create a wonderfully lush dream world.  But its
leafy green paradise is almost obscured by a bigger, brighter,
olive-hued disaster.</P>
<P>That's right – I'm talking about Calista Flockhart's teeth, and the way
she shrieks each line sort of makes you want to jam your finger down her
throat, too.  Love may make fools of us all, but Ally McAnnoying sets a
whole new standard.  (1:55 – PG-13 for adult situations and brief
nudity)</P>
