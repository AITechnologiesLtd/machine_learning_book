Fallen Angels
Directed by Wong Kar-wai</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>In this beautiful, baffling follow-up to CHUNGKING EXPRESS, Wong Kar-wai   
has lapsed once again into near-total disregard for coherence and   
linearity, serving up instead something like a visual symphony.   
 Structured more around allusion and image than character and event,   
ANGELS lacks the tight coherence of EXPRESS, which makes it at once   
astonishing and incredibly frustrating; viewers may find themselves   
transfixed by this vision of Hong Kong and its denizens, even as they're   
baffled by plotlines and elements of story that seem without purpose or   
direction.  Not every moment of the film is compelling, but taken as a   
whole, Wong has once again provided a fascinating statement about memory,   
longing, and human relationships in the urban world.</P>
<P>FALLEN ANGELS borrows from CHUNGKING EXPRESS its essential structure; it   
tells us two stories, both centering on peculiar love affairs.  The first   
shows us a detached gun-for-hire, Wong Chi-Ming (Leon Lai) and his   
partner, known only as the Agent (Michele Reis).  Wong and the Agent   
rarely meet, communicating by beeper code and fax, but they have an   
intimate connection nonetheless:  the Agent maintains Wong's base of   
operations, and takes his rubbish home with her to peruse in private.   
 The second tale shows us the antics of one He Zhiwu (CHUNGKING EXPRESS's   
Takeshi Kaneshiro), a mute ex-con who makes a strange living by   
impersonating shopkeepers after hours and forcing passers-by to consume   
his goods and services.  He develops a relationship of sorts with Cherry   
(Charlie Young), a young, possibly deranged woman recently dumped by her   
lover; He obviously cares for her deeply despite the fact that it's never   
clear that she's actually aware of his presence.</P>
<P>These stories, which sound like B movie fodder, are brought to luscious   
life by amphetamine-paced editing and cinematography that's almost too   
good to believe.  Wong is using his usual cinematographer, Christopher   
Doyle (also noted for his work on the recent TEMPTRESS MOON); their work   
together is consistently distinctive and provocative, and FALLEN ANGELS   
is no exception.  In fact, the filmmakers have outdone themselves; using   
a hand-held camera, a few wide-angle lenses, and complex, suggestive   
lighting, Wong and Doyle have provided us with a Hong Kong that evokes   
the longings and languishings of its inhabitants.   And, unlike EXPRESS,   
which tells its two stories sequentially, ANGELS tells its tales   
virtually simultaneously, driving home the point that Wong always seems   
to be making about life in the postmodern city -- that the urban   
lifestyle does not destroy the cords that tie people to others and to   
their culture, but rather transforms them into something less   
recognizable -- something complex, beautiful, and tragic.</P>
<P>The film's visual style is so suggestive as to be almost domineering, and   
it would make it easy to overlooks some impressive performances by its   
principals.  Fans of CHUNGKING EXPRESS will hardly recognize Takeshi   
Kaneshiro as he videotapes his father or attempts to forcibly shampoo an   
innocent bystander; his hair, his costume, and his demeanor bear no   
resemblance to those of the lonely, noble Cop 223.  But the actor retains   
his appealing, youthful exuberance, and he brings a credible humanity to   
a part that threatens to collapse into caricature.  Michelle Reis also   
deserves special mention; her stoic, detached demeanor dovetails nicely   
with her character's quiet, private obsessions.</P>
<P>FALLEN ANGELS certainly has its weak moments; Wong doesn't always seem to   
know the difference between the quirky and the trivial, and some of his   
subplots are more than a little tedious.  Moviegoers who demand that   
their films make easy sense and tell an entertaining story will probably   
come away frustrated or bored, or both.  But the film remains immensely   
valuable for its virtuoso style and its lusty embrace of urban life.</P>
