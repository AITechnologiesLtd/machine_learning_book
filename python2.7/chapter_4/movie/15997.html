<P>THE REAL BLONDE
Directed by Tom DiCillo
 Early on, it appears "The Real Blonde" might be out to do for struggling
thirtysomething white actors what Robert Townsend's uproarious "Hollywood
Shuffle" (1987) did for struggling twentysomething African-American actors,
namely to use the humiliations they must endure to find work as the
springboard for rich satire. Joe (Matthew Modine) is 35, good-looking and
talented, but he still has no agent, no substantial credits and no idea of
how to talk to casting agents. Hint: Telling them you won't even consider
doing a soap opera because "that's not real acting" is usually a one-way
ticket straight to the exit door. Joe's lofty ideals begin to deflate when
his friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield) gets a long-term gig on the daytime drama
"Passion Crest" at a staggering $3600 a week, and it isn't long before Joe
is all but begging to be a beach-boy extra in a Madonna video.
 Writer-director Tom DiCillo has a lot more on his mind than Joe's
employment problems, however. DiCillo also wants to explore Bob's carnal
quest to find one real blonde, which involves sleeping his way through a
series of chemically altered models. DiCillo is also intrigued by Joe's
girlfriend Mary (Catherine Keener), a hairdresser with an enormous amount of
pent-up rage stemming from the constant sexual harrassment she's subjected
to on the streets of New York. And just to make sure his movie has enough
plot, DiCillo also throws in the plight of a neighborhood woman who's lost
her dog, the trampy behavior of an egotistical actress (Daryl Hannah) who
becomes Bob's co-star on the set and in the bedroom, a self-defense
instructor (Denis Leary) who tries to put the moves on Mary, a troubled
model (Bridgette Wilson) who claims to find spiritual enlightenment in "The
Little Mermaid," and a Madonna body double (Elizabeth Berkley) who's weary
of having hair the color of buttered popcorn.
 Soon "The Real Blonde" starts to seem more like an extended episode of "The
Real World," as we're asked to care deeply about the woes, jealousies,
inhibitions and fantasies of some fairly shallow people. A few funny lines
pop up along the way and give DiCillo credit for amusingly offbeat
casting -- Marlo Thomas as a Helmut Newton-style fashion photographer is
particularly sharp -- but much of  "Blonde" is just plain dumb. James
