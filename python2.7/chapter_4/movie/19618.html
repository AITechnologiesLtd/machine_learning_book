<P>Universal Pictures, once was the bastion of the Horror genre. Such
venerable American icons as the Frankenstein Monster, Count Dracula,
Lawrence Talbot, the Wolfman, and in the 50's, The Creature; have
scared and endeared themselves to the movie going public. One of
Universal Pictures most maligned creations, Karis, the Mummy; was
relegated to the moderate level of 'B' picture. Having no other
purpose that to come back to life to aid a conniving Egyptian Priest
in his attempt to preserve their riches. All this while Karis himself
tried vainly to recapture the reincarnated Princess Annunka. While
these films were enjoyable programmers, they were never considered
classics and rightly so. The only film to gather any notoriety was the
original 1932 version of "The Mummy" which stared the venerable Boris
Karloff in the role of the dreaded Imhotep. In this new appraisal of
the classic tale, Director Stephen Sommers has created a sometimes
amusing, but mostly barren piece of fluff.</P>
<P>In a nicely constructed prologue, we witness the murder of the Pharaoh
by his Mistress, Anck-Su-Namun and her lover, the high Priest
Imhotep. Imhotep's lover sacrifices herself so that the Priest can
escape and through his magic, return her spirit to her
body. Unfortunately, the Pharaoh's guard interrupt the proceeding and
mummify the Priest in a dreaded procedure that has Imhotep buried
alive in a sarcophagus full of flesh eating beetles.</P>
<P>Flash forward to the 1920's. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frazer) is
fighting off an army of unidentified Arabian fighters. As the army
decimates his men, O'Connell outruns the hordes until a huge statue
corners him. His pursuers suddenly turn and run away. O'Connell turns
and sees that he is standing beneath the statue of Anubis, the resting
place of Imhotep. The sands move and erupt, taking on the appearance
of the dreaded Priest, threatening to swallow O'Connell. He escapes
and wanders the desert. Finally captured and placed in a Moroccan
jail, he waits for his execution.</P>
<P>To his rescue, comes Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan
(John Hannah), who discover that O'Connell may know the location of
the fabled city of the dead, Hamunaptra. The expedition
begins. O'Connell and Evelyn develop an uneasy romantic relationship,
as they uncover Imhotep's tomb. Unfortunately, another troupe of
treasure hunters led by actor Jonathan Hyde, follows them.  Finding
the tomb, Imhotep is released from his slumber and proceeds to murder
those who opened his crypt, taking their organs for his own
use. Imhotep soon kidnaps Evelyn to use as a sacrifice to the old
Egyptian gods, in preparation to brining his beloved Anck-Su-Namun
back to live.</P>
<P>The plot, as described above is pretty much, all there is to the
film. There are several other developments and sequences that deserve
attention, but they are of fleeting entertainment value. Suffice to
say that, there are moments of good fun in this film, but not enough
to warrant the 124 minute running time. At this length, the film seems
overly long. The script is wont with contrivances and plot holes. Once
Imhotep starts to wander about Egypt, the special effects take center
stage. While there are some very good visuals in the film, I had the
strange feeling that I was actually watching an old Charles Schneer
production.  Scenes of the computer generated mummy, it's skeleton
visible through sections of it's anatomy (imagine the Aurora model kit
of Grey's Anatomy, with some gauze raped around it and you'll get the
picture). Unfortunately, I kept being reminded of Ray Harryhausen's
Dynamation effects, rather than any sort of dread that these scenes
may have had. While the effects are quiet enjoyable and stunning, they
don't have that fission , that 'oh my gosh!' quality that drives this
kind of picture.</P>
<P>The performances are nothing special in the film. Brendan Fraser does
an okay job of filling in the matinee idol part. He fills the 'Indian
Jones' role quite well in fact. Mr. Fraser is one of those rare actors
that seems to enjoy the absurdity of the project he is involved in. A
refreshingly joyous quality.  However, his climatic fight with horde
of mummified warriors introduces lots of Hong Kong Wu-Shu type martial
arts, which are completely incongruous with his character and the
setting. I don't think most westerners had the opportunity to study
under the Shaolin monks at that time in history. But, this is a
fantasy, so it's forgivable to an extent.</P>
<P>Rachel Weisz brings to her character of Evelyn a nice dry wit. Her
comic timing is very refreshing. Moreover in a film being marketed as
a horror / adventure, the character should be a least a little
frightened. John Hannah as Evelyn's brother, Jonathan is completely
wasted. His character does nothing but whine and comment on the
proceedings, only occasionally getting involved in the action.  One of
the most interesting and ultimately most frustrating casting notes in
the film is the inclusion of Bernard Fox as the aging and slightly mad
Corporal Wilson. The character brings a welcome bit of comic relief to
the film that is not derived from the constant one-liners and
slapstick situations that abound in the film. Unfortunately, the
character is used solely as a device in which to get the characters to
their destination after which, he is conveniently killed off.</P>
<P>Kevin O'Connor is creepily amusing in his part of the cowardly,
Beni. His confrontation with Imhotep, wherein he tries to protect
himself from the approaching monster by holding up several holy
artifacts he wares around his neck. When he finally holds up the Star
of David, Imhotep recognizes the symbol as belonging to the Slaves of
his time, and takes the former guide as his accomplice promising him
untold riches. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Connor is afforded much too much
screen time, and consequently, the character becomes less and less
threatening, finally ending as a buffoon.</P>
<P>Arnold Vosloo is actually quiet good in the role of the re-constituted
Priest Imhotep. Having appeared opposite Lance Henrickson in John
Woo's "Hard Target" and the two 'Darkman' sequels, Vosloo carries with
him an appropriate air of menace and stature that are a welcome
benefit to the film. Vosloo is a natural screen villain. His charisma
is that good.</P>
<P>The script for "The Mummy" is comic book from start to finish. While
there is nothing wrong with that, what the script lacks is a sense of
dread that any horror film needs to have. All the adventure and action
in the world has no value without a sense of danger. Since none of the
characters express any sense of jeopardy, it is hard to feel involved
in the proceedings. While the film is enjoyably kinetic, it would have
benefited from a little more suspense and less visual buffoonery.</P>
<P>Also, there are the dreaded instances of contrivance throughout the
film. The inclusion of the flesh eating beetles as part of the
mummification process in the prologue of the film is a nice and creepy
touch. Yet having the pests remain alive after 3000 years of
starvation (not much to chow on in a sealed crypt), is a bit of a
stretch.  Furthermore, these beetles continue to crawl all over
Imhotep after he starts to replace his organs, the bugs crawling in
and out of his flesh. Why these bugs just don't eat the darn guy up
again is something that I cannot explain. A quick thanks should also
go to the prop managers who managed to leave a convenient assortment
of camels at the tomb for our heroes to escape on when the entire city
of the dead collapses in on itself.</P>
<P>As it stands, "THE MUMMY" is a fun time waster. There is nothing in
the film that will linger after you've left the theater. And the
possibility of a franchise is moot at best. It should be mentioned
that there are scenes of a grotesque nature in the film that may not
be acceptable for younger viewers. The PG-13 rating is an accurate
one.</P>
