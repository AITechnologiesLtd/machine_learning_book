THE REPLACEMENTS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"I know five million [dollars a year] sounds like a lot of money," 
whines one of the NFL players with a zillion-dollar ego who has just 
gone out on strike against the equally wealthy owners.  THE 
REPLACEMENTS, a surprisingly funny comedy, is inspired by the 1987 
professional football players strike.</P>
<P>Director Howard Deutch, who has directed films from PRETTY IN PINK to 
THE ODD COUPLE II, and writer Vince McKewin (FLY AWAY HOME) are perhaps 
an odd choice for a sports comedy, but they have come up with a 
thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment.  A good-spirited and 
energetic film, it flies by with few pretentious moments.  Only in the 
occasional serious interludes and in the throw-away romance does its 
momentum ever sag.  </P>
<P>O'Neil (Jack Warden), the owner of the Washington Sentinels, lets Coach 
McGinty (Gene Hackman) hire whomever he wants as replacement players 
until the "real" players return.  McGinty puts together a rag-tag 
collection of people who he thinks may have the right skill set 
regardless of their background or current place of "employment."  
Recruiting a prisoner, two body guards, a convenience store clerk, a 
gung-ho cop and a sumo wrestler with a monstrous beer belly (actually a 
boiled-egg belly) , the coach has a fearsome team that suffers from its 
lack of coordination and cooperation.  "I've seen monkeys at the zoo 
that were more organized that this," says O'Neil, while shaking his head 
during the disastrous start of the replacements' first game.  </P>
<P>As his quarterback, the coach taps a known loser, Shane Falco, played as 
a likeable and vulnerable everyman by Keanu Reeves (THE MATRIX).  "Hey, 
Falco," the team's normal quarterback, Martel (Brett Cullen), taunts 
him, "you're not even a has-been.  You're a never-was."  The coach tries 
his homespun wisdom on Falco, but he is a pragmatic who isn't impressed.  
"You know what separates the winners from the losers, kid?" McGinty 
asks.  "The score!" Falco retorts.</P>
<P>With characters that are walking clichés, the director doesn't apologize 
for them and lets us laugh with them and at them.  Since they are only 
going to be there a few weeks, the athletes don't take themselves too 
seriously.  They don't expect to be offered multimillion dollar product 
endorsements.  They just want to play ball.</P>
<P>Ignoring the axiom of the day that only crudeness sells at the theaters, 
Warner Brothers offers a PG-13 movie that, even if it has a few raunchy 
moments, can respectably display the PG-13 label.  Parents will not be 
embarrassed that they let their kids see it, which isn't the case with 
so many of the recent PG-13 releases that once would have been 
considered a definite R.</P>
<P>The film's sexual humor comes from its parody of professional 
cheerleaders.  Annabelle (Brooke Langton) has the task of replacing the 
cheerleaders.  The auditions are funny but nothing like the game 
sequences which are hilarious due to the background of most of the new 
recruits, whose normal jobs includes skills such as lap dancing.  They 
are so "good" that they prove an effective distraction to lure the 
opposing players' eyes away at a few crucial moments.</P>
<P>NOTTING HILL's quintessentially unsexy Rhys Ifans is perfectly cast as a 
Welsh soccer player named Gruff.  The out-of-shape, chain-smoking Gruff 
is a great place-kicker willing to try 65-yard goals.  Like the other 
members of the team, he's also quite funny.  Using the classic lines 
from BABE, he tells the sumo wrestler, Fumiko (Ace Yonamine), when he 
overachieves during practice, "That'll do, pig.  That'll do."</P>
<P>Unlike so many other recent sports movie, Oliver Stone's 
confusingly-edited ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, for example, the editing in THE 
REPLACEMENTS is lucid, and it is easy to follow the action and get 
involved in the details of the game.</P>
<P>Among the film's many delights include a dance number led by Orlando 
Jones.  As the team languishes in jail, he leads them in a rousing 
routine of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive."  It is a fun moment that 
captures the essence of this sweet little picture.  The replacement 
players are having a blast with their brief moment on the stage, and we 
are vicariously enjoying it with them.</P>
<P>THE REPLACEMENTS runs 1:54 but seems much shorter.  It is rated PG-13 
for some crude sexual humor and language and would be acceptable for 
kids around 10 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, had a great time watching it.  Giving it ****, 
he said it was hilarious.  He thought the plot was cool and the football 
was great.  He laughed loudly and cheered frequently.</P>
