A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Peter Medak</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Chris Brancato</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Blood, gore, breasts, astronaut infected with alien DNA </P>
<P>Starring: Natasha Henstridge, Justin Lazard, Michael Madsen, Marg
Helgenberger, Mykelti Williamson, James Cromwell</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Since SPECIES II is a sequel, let's recap SPECIES before discussing
SPECIES II. In the original SPECIES film scientists receive a radio
signal from space with instructions for how alien DNA can be combined
with human DNA. They do the experiment, and presto! Out pops Sil (the
beautiful Natasha Henstridge), a sexy half alien half human woman who
goes on a mating rampage which morphs her into an invincible slimy,
terrifying alien. A government assassin named Press Lennox (Michael
Madsen) and a biologist named Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) work
to track down and destroy the out-of-control human/alien Sil. But mostly
we get to see Sil strut and have sex with guys who don't know what
they've got coming to them.</P>
<P>In SPECIES II, astronaut Patrick Ross, and two pals go on a manned
mission to Mars to take some back Martian soil samples, but unknowingly
they get infected with Species DNA from a soil sample. The only
astronaut unaffected is Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), who is a
sickle cell anemia carrier. When the team returns to earth, astronaut
hero Patrick goes on a mating rampage which morphs him into an
invincible slimy, terrifying alien.</P>
<P>Patrick picks up a lot of hookers and kidnaps a woman from the grocery
store, and mates with them (killing them in the process) to produce
offspring who spin cocoons and hang on the ceiling.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Natasha Henstridge, who played the original Sil in SPECIES,
now plays Eve, a friendlier, more docile human/alien whom scientists
have cloned from the DNA of the original Sil.  Dr. Laura Baker (Marg
Helgenberger from SPECIES) is heading the high security science lab that
studies Eve. </P>
<P>When Patrick the alien goes on the mating rampage, Dr. Baker and
freelance security man Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) - - both from the
first SPECIES film - - are reunited to track down the slimy creature.
They hope to use Eve to help them find the alien, but the mating urge is
so strong that Eve escapes from the lab. </P>
<P>Opinion:
There's not much you can really do with a movie whose main premise is:
"Oh no! We must stop him from mating."  Except make sure it's not too
serious, and have at it. </P>
<P>Natasha Henstridge as Eve is gorgeous, and the cameraman takes advantage
of that, but her lines are limited; Henstridge has to do her best
putting character into a role that serves no function but to put sex on
screen. Similarly, Mykelti Williamson as astronaut Dennis Gamble has to
adlib and squeeze comedy out of his cardboard character. Kudos to those
two.</P>
<P>The other cast members don't bother to try very hard, and in fact
deliver forgettable lines with wooden performances. For example, after
all this blood, death, and destruction, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger)
exclaims the understatement of the year: "My. This is awful." Or how
about Press Lennox explaining the alien mating urge to an unbelieving
military general? He says something like, "Do you want them to f--ck us
into oblivion?"</P>
<P>Or the scene where the camera focuses carefully on a corpse as a mini
buzz saw blade cuts through the dead woman's grotesque and bloody head
during an autopsy. The doctor nonchalantly says, "Let me move this ear
aside, now..." </P>
<P>Given sharp and witty dialogue, they probably could have turned this
movie into the alien version of SCREAM. But SPECIES II sticks straight
to the gore genre. Basically SPECIES II is a tongue-in-cheek B-grade
gore flick, and is satisfying as such. It's all blood, bodies, breasts,
corny lines, and alien tentacles, but don't expect more.</P>
