                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Having seen young Anakin Skywalker in all those commercials, I was
curious to see how his pairing with Adam Sandler would pan out in this
revisionist STAR WARS called, strangely enough, BIG DADDY.</P>
<P>     We are first introduced to a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sandler), who
finds his life at a standstill, unable to progress to the next phase of
his Jedi training.  His wiser friend (and roommate) Qui-Gon Jinn (Jon
Stewart) leaves town for a land to the far east, stranding Obi-Wan with
nothing to do but live the life of a do-nothing.</P>
<P>     Obi-Wan is surprised by the arrival of young Anakin (twins Cole and
Dylan Sprouse), who gives the Jedi a real challenge, for which he finds
himself completely unprepared.  In this version, Skywalker is the lost
son of Qui-Gon, a turn which I don't think George Lucas will approve of.</P>
<P>     Obi-Wan undertakes the training of Anakin, teaching him the ways of
Jedi concentration (the ability to urinate in public), agility (pelting
him with baseballs), and etiquette (drooling to the ground and sucking
it back up).</P>
<P>     Only then is Anakin ready for the next step, helping Obi-Wan woo
Queen Amidala (Joey Lauren Adams), a wealthy and brilliant woman
seemingly out of Obi-Wan's reach.</P>
<P>     Also along for fun and comic relief is delivery guy Jar Jar Binks
(Rob Schneider), who, although completely created on a computer, looks
extremely realistic and lifelike (although you'll find his voice a bit
grating).  Two gay droids, R2-D2 (Peter Dante) and C-3PO (Jonathan
Loughran) also make for less serious moments.</P>
<P>     BIG DADDY takes a turn for the malevolent when social services
worker Darth Maul (Josh Mostel) threatens to take Anakin away from
Qui-Gon, and assumedly, place him in the hands of the dark side.  But a
dramatic confrontation in the Imperial Senate ensues, where the Jedis
successfully defend young Skywalker, and it's an appearance from elder
Jedi Master Yoda (Joe Bologna) who saves the day.</P>
<P>     Altogether, BIG DADDY is a fair entry into the Star Wars pantheon.
Although I was perplexed by some of the decisions of the filmmakers to
try to make this film into a comedy, I will be most intrigued to
discover how Anakin eventually turns into the malicious Darth Vader.</P>
<P>     Filmcritic.com has learned that this will be revealed in the film's
sequel: BIGGER DADDY.</P>
