<P>   In James L. Brooks's comedy "As Good As It Gets," when
a receptionist asks celebrated novelist Melvin Udall how he
writes women so authentically, he replies, "I think of a man. 
Then I take away reason."  By contrast, Pedro Almodovar
bears no malice toward the female sex.  His latest film, which
won him the best director prize at the last Cannes Film
Festival, is billed as a homage to all women and to all people
who want to be women.  While Almodovar--perhaps Spain's
greatest director since Luis Bunuel--breaks with his past
custom of portraying off-the-wall characters against surreal
settings, he retains an affection for unusual people.  In "All
About My Mother," a moving, sometimes melodramatic
meditation upon a group of women who become good friends
and support one another through their heartaches and
troubles, the prolific forty-eight year old regisseur creates a
somewhat autobiographical picture across a boldly-colored
canvas.  In a movie flawed only by an unusual number of
coincidences, he focuses on a nurse whose tragedies began
when her husband ran away from their Madrid home to
Barcelona to become a woman, later to become tragically
involved with yet another woman whom he callously
abandons as well. </P>
<P>   Directing "All About My Father" at an often fevered
emotional pitch, Almodovar centers on the 38-year-old
Manuela (Cecilia Roth) who has a mutually dependent
relationship with her 17-year-old son and would-be novelist,
Esteban (Eloy Azorin).  When the boy, a Truman Capote fan,
is run down and killed by a car while seeking the autograph
of actress Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), Manuela is
traumatized, quits her job, and goes in search of the boy's
father (Toni Canto)--who has become a transsexual living in
Barcelona.  After running into a transsexual friend from
Madrid, La Agrado (Antonia San Juan), whom she saves from
a beating in a red light district of Barcelona, she is hired as
an assistant to actress Huma Rojo, who is currently
performing the role of Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams'
"Streetcar Named Desire." Manuela also meets Huma's
significant other, Nina (Candela Pena) who is in the role of
Stella, and Sister Rosa (Penelope Cruz) who prepares to go
to El Salvador to replace a murdered nun when she is
hindered from the assignment by an unusual predicament.</P>
<P>   A kind of tagline to the movie which is utilized by
Almodovar is Truman Capote's quote, "When God gives you
a gift, He hands you a whip."  This becomes clear as a
calamity falls upon one women after another some time
following her attainment of a blessing.  Despite their
misfortunes--or perhaps because of them--Almodovar treats
these people whom only a mother could love with the
greatest respect and dignity, showing the special spot he
carries in his heart for the walking wounded and society's
outcasts. Drug addicts, abused nuns, transvestites and
transsexuals, whores, lesbians--all fall under the man's
umbrella and are accorded compassion and affection.    </P>
<P>   "You're more authentic the more you resemble what you
dream you are," is promoted as a manifesto of the film's
comic genius, Antonia San Juan (in the role of the heavily
plasticized La Agrado).  This pronouncement is obviously the
driving force of the warmth we feel for each of the
personalities portrayed, and interpreted by Almodovar with
camera work that shows an attention to detail and a fancy for
luminous colors.  The jazzy soundtrack gives an upbeat tone
to a film which is serious about the plight of the women while
remaining always heedlessly optimistic.</P>
