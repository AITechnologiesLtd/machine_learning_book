<P>     The set-up is deceptively simple in this much-acclaimed Southern
drama from writer/director Tim Robbins (BOB ROBERTS).  Susan Sarandon
plays a nun on a last-minute mission to save the soul of Sean Penn's
convicted murderer on death row.  It's a straight-forward set-up that
firmly holds our attention through the various preachy, predictable, and
downright tedious turns taken by the story.  The subtext is capital
punishment and Robbins-- adapting from Sister Helen Prejean's best
seller-- lays it on a bit thick.  To the director's credit, his
in-your-face exploration of the issue is (reasonably) balanced on both
sides of the argument.  He also keeps the theatrics to a considerable
minimum.  (The Christ allusions at the end do get a bit tiresome,
though.) Both Penn and Sarandon do impossibly good work here and will be
likely contenders at Oscar time.  Also worth noting is supporting actor
Robert Prosky, usually just another familiar face and who, for a change,
actually finds some flavor.</P>
