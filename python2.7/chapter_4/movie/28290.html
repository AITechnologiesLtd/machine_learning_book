<PRE>THE CENTER OF THE WORLD
------------------------</PRE>
<P>Dot com millionaire Richard (Peter Sarsgaard, "Boy's Don't Cry") thinks the
center of the world is his computer while stripper Flo (Molly Parker, "The Five
Senses") thinks it's between her legs.  These two both go on a journey of
self-discovery and self-delusion when Richard hires Flo to spend a weekend
in Las Vegas in director Wayne Wang's "The Center of the World."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Director Wang's ("Anywhere But Here") attempt to show man's inability
to make a personal connection as he ironically gets increasingly connected 
via the internet is a topical idea, yet Wang alienates his audience with
the shallow characterization Ellen Benjamin Wong's script provides his
two leads.</P>
<P>When Richard meets Flo, she gives her career as a rock band drummer
but admits that her income comes from stripping.  Richard chooses to see
her making money, and, beguiled by her professional come-on, soon begs her to
accompany him on a three day trip to Las Vegas, offering $10,000.  Against
her better judgement, but attracted by the cash, Flo insists on rules.
She'll be at his beck and call from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. with no kissing on the 
mouth, no penetration and no talk about feelings.  Richard prepares to leave,
even as he promises his boss to be present for an important client meeting
prior to their IPO kickoff.</P>
<P>Perhaps the ultimate city of illusion, Las Vegas proves a perfect backdrop
for this artificial relationship, but things quickly get out of hand as
Richard is charmed by Flo's openness and Flo is forced to assess her own
part in the play when her friend Jerri (Carla Gugino, "Spy Kids") too 
aggressively inserts herself between the twosome.</P>
<P>While the sex may be hot (the film is unrated), the spark between Richard
and Flo is not.  We're given no idea why a rich, handsome nice guy like
Richard would need to pay a woman for company.  He initially tells Flo
that his father recently died and that they were very close, but quickly
insists 'It's okay.'  It's also inexplicable why he would
bring his laptop with him and continue to work on the game designing he's
made his fortune with, yet do everything in his power to scuttle an IPO
that would cement his career and wealth.  </P>
<P>Flo's character is even more problematic.  Whenever we glimpse her involved 
with her music, all she projects is boredom.  Her only other known human 
connection, Jerri, is admittedly the whore Flo resists being labelled as.  
Flo's arc goes from reminding Richard that 'It's all an act, you know' to 
telling Jerri 'I think I kinda like him' to playing dead as her ultimate 
rules are broken.  The only time these two characters seem to be enjoying
themselves together is when Flo plays Richard's video game.</P>
<P>Digital video cinematography by Mauro Fiore features color drained scenes
when outside of Vegas or Flo's strip club, and flat, dingy looking color
on the streets of Vegas.  Vegas itself is presented in an original way,
recalling the artificial world of "Babe:  Pig in the City" with its Statues
of Liberty and Venetian gondolas.  The connecting hotel rooms, where the
bulk of the action takes place, however, don't convince as accommodations
chosen by a millionaire.</P>
<P>Wang nicely ends his film with a bit of intriguing ambiguity, but it's too
little too late - "The Center of the World" can't sustain interest in its
own central characters.</P>
