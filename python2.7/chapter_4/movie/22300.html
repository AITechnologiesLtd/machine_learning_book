<P>THE EDGE
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
Directed by Lee Tamahori
        There's something irresistibly intriguing about the idea of a
wilderness-survival story penned by playwright David Mamet ("Glengarry
Glen Ross") and featuring the anything-but-rough-and-tumble Anthony
Hopkins in the lead. The concept seems so far-fetched it leads "The
Edge" some certifiable curiosity value right from the start. Add in the
intensity of Mr. Actors' Studio himself, Alec Baldwin, and you know you
must be in for a wild ride.
        Or perhaps not. The most startling thing about "The Edge" is how</P>
<P>traditional the whole thing seems. Bookwormish Hopkins and oily
fashion-photographer Baldwin, stranded in the Canadian countryside after</P>
<P>a plane crash, confront a variety of dangers and --- in typical Mamet
style --- have to get in touch with their inner manliness before they
can
return to civilization. A few scattered profanities, a couple of gory
accidents and a subplot about suspected adultery are all that separates
this story from the grade-school classic "My Side of the Mountain."
        Mamet's screenplay seems to have something it wants to say about
the
changing definitions of manhood, but his message never quite comes
through as director Lee Tamahori keeps interrupting the story for
regular visits from a cranky Kodiak who seems to get his kicks out of
terrorizing our heroes. The bear attacks get progressively sillier and
less believable until the inevitable final confrontation, a moment that
requires an enormous suspension of disbelief.
        "The Edge" is on steadier ground dealing with its human
characters:
Although neither of them is particularly amiable, both have some
unexpected dimensions, and Hopkins and Baldwin deliver nuanced
performances. Another major plus is the movie's gorgeous photography
which makes the wilds of Alberta look like a great place to get lost in.</P>
