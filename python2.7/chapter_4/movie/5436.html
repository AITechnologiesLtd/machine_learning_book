<PRE>                                THE PHANTOM
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Another comic strip character makes
          it to the big screen as Lee Falk's Phantom becomes
          involved in a chase for three mystical skulls.  The
          plot has more holes than the face of The Phantom's
          cave but does have some of the feel of the old
          serials.  Billy Zane is a curious choice for The
          Phantom, but he manages to hold his own.  This is
          not a good film--along similar lines I much prefer
          THE SHADOW--but does have some fun.  Still, not
          enough for actual respect.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to
          +4) (Minor spoilers in the review.)</PRE>
<P>     The legend of The Phantom began in the 16th Century when off the
shores of the Island of Bangalla ("Bengalla" in the film) Singg pirates
captured a British merchantman ship and put all to the sword but for a
young boy, Kit, who dived over the side just in time to see his father
killed.  The boy swam to shore and was rescued by pygmies (not so small
in the film).  The boy swore revenge on the pirate who killed his
beloved father, but days later he found the pirate washed up on shore
dead.  His goal in life gone, he instead devoted his life to fighting
piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice wherever it occurred.  He swore
that this would be not just his mission, but that of his sons and their
sons.  When he died they would carry on after him.  So began a long
line of Phantoms.  As there always was a Phantom around fighting evil,
even as generations and even centuries passed, the legend grew that The
Phantom could not die.  He could appear to die, but would return ever
and again looking just the same.  He was called "The Man Who Cannot
Die" and "The Ghost Who Walks."  The pygmies kept the secret that The
Phantom was a mortal and gave each Phantom the secrets of their
deadliest hunting poisons.  He made his home Skull Cave in the deep
woods of Bangalla and found other Skull Caves in other parts of the
world including the American Southwest.  From these he could fight
evil-doers everywhere.  But when one Phantom's adventures were ended a
Phantom would always return to Bangalla, his true home.  The pygmies
knew that the day would come when each Phantom would die, usually
violently, and The Phantom's son would be summoned to don the costume
and assume the role of The Phantom.</P>
<P>     I have to admit that even as a child I was not very interested in
The Phantom.  He was just about the least intriguing-looking super-hero
I could think of.  A black mask and a skin-tight purple suit was just
too little costume.  He looked a lot like a professional wrestler.  But
what really unsold me on The Phantom were his garish purple and black
diagonally striped shorts (missing in the film).  Because I thought the
shorts looked silly, the stories probably never got much of a chance to
impress me, though modern critics say that it was one of the better
adventure comic strips.  The Phantom was the creation of Lee Falk, who
previously had created Mandrake the Magician.  The strip began its long
run on February 17, 1936, and sixty years later it was still running.
The strip was adapted into a fifteen-chapter Columbia serial in 1943,
with Tom Tyler playing the title role.  Now, with the character a
little over sixty years old, The Phantom is back on the wide screen in
a story with a strong serial feel.</P>
<P>     The year is 1938 and the world is in turmoil as dictators try to
bring about a New World Order.  The United States has its own would-be
dictator, the ruthless gangster/businessman Xander Drax (played by
Treat Williams).  Drax's plan to is to get power through the use of
supernatural means.  He wants to gain possession of three mystical
jeweled skulls which when brought together will bring their owner about
the same power that the Lost Ark would.  (And this film does borrow
heavily and repeatedly from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, albeit lacking the
style to make it all work.)  As the film opens we see three ruthless
Indiana-Jones-like characters who have tracked the first skull to the
Island of Bengalla (ugh-oh!).  The skull is in a cave somewhere in the
deep woods (UGH-OH!).  But it is safe, you see, because one of the
mercenary explorers had actually killed The Phantom several years
before (Dead meat!!!).  Out of the forest, on a white horse and
followed by the wolf, Devil, comes riding The Phantom.  And so begins
an adventure that will carry The Phantom to New York City and later to
a meeting with the last descendants of the Singg pirates, killers of
the father of the original Phantom.</P>
<P>     Billy Zane is a reasonable actor, best remembered, at least by me,
as the sea-going psychopath in the taut thriller DEAD CALM.  And in the
purple suit he physically looks the part, even without the striped
shorts.  Treat Williams plays his villain with a subtle tongue-in-
cheek.  He does not interpret the role so broadly that he could be in a
Batman film, but he is not really playing it straight either.  Kristy
Swanson, known too well as BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, puts the most
character in her maiden-in-distress that I have seen from her in any
film, but she has a long way to go.  And veteran Patrick McGoohan is
known for underplaying his roles and so fits right in.  Some of the
most interesting faces are in bit parts: a gangster here, a cab driver
there.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most intriguing part about Jeffrey Boam's script is
its unwillingness to commit to whether The Phantom is supernatural or
not.  The legend is that The Phantom is supernatural and supposedly the
truth is that he is not, but there are bits in the film that imply he
is able to do what no mortal man could.  Does he commune with the ghost
of his father or is it only a memory?  The supernatural certainly
mingles with the natural world in this film.  Some of his abilities
seem to be just on the edge of what is naturally possible, but it could
be just the writing.  Certainly Boam is willing to contrive some absurd
coincidences, particularly having villains fall a little too perfectly
into some set traps.</P>
<P>     One problem with the script is that while it is sort of explained
how The Phantoms find mates to extend their line, it is a little less
clear how the Singg pirates find sufficient mates considering where
they are.  Nor is it really clear why, lacking the dedication of the
Phantoms, they continue their line in the same profession.  And it is a
little hokey having everybody be descendants of originals, repeating
the same battles that have gone on for 400 years.  Many of the scenes
are not staged very well.  When someone swings on a rope, if you watch
the angle that the rope hangs you will see definite continuity errors.
One odd departure from the original suit is the addition of surface
designs.  It is like little black lines were added to accentuate muscle
definition.  One absurd scene has the wolf Devil apparently talking to
The Phantom's white horse and telling the horse where to go to pick up
his master.  The horse then outruns an airplane.  Some horse.  There is
little on-screen violence, but there is a gruesome scene of implied
violence (borrowed from the film THE HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM).</P>
<P>     In spite of a valiant effort to recreate a feel of the 1930s, THE
PHANTOM never really works perfectly and often not even well.  Then
again the same can be said of the old serials.  And it is good-natured
fun in the style of the old movie serials.  If you did not like THE
SHADOW which had a good deal more panache, it is a good bet you will
not like THE PHANTOM.  For the sake of that fun I give it a high 0 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
