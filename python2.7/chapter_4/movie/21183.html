<P> "The wise man mocks the man, the mocked man mocks the mocker"
Starring Johnny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Liv Tyler, Ken Stott, Alan
Cumming. Rated R.</P>
<P>Plunkett & MaCleane is a period piece mired down by modern MTV
pretentions. I have nothing against the MTV approach to filmmaking --
used properly it can save a movie (see Stigmata) -- but it ruins this
one, making a muddled, incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting
premise. There are certain genres that just don't go together.
The film opens with a sequence that I still don't understand. It
involves some sort of prison outbreak, a robbery, and a gem that keeps
being eaten. In any case, the caper (whatever it may be) brings
together Plunkett and MaCleane (Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller,
respectively), two happy-go-lucky Brits with no way to make a living.
They make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves
until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to America. Their first
heist involves a young debutante named Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler); a
woman Macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier.
His decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks
the name "Gentleman Highwaymen."</P>
<P>Lady Rebecca also happens to be the niece of the Lord Chief Justice, a
glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career. He
demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately, leaving
the job in the hands of the devious Chance (Ken Stott) who has a few
more things on his mind than catching criminals. Meanwhile, Macleane
falls in love with Rebecca infuriating the businesslike Plunkett, who
doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic
travails.</P>
<P>Director Jake Scott, son of Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner), has his
father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill
in actually moving the camera. Most of the action scenes are filmed in
such a rapid, jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going
on. The camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully
dizzying The Blair Witch Project due to its lack of fluidity. Instead
of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events
Scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits. He barely ever holds a
shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems
more like a couple frames between each cut.</P>
<P>The weird, almost defiant lack of dialogue (there are no -- NO --
conversations lasting over, say, 20 seconds) undermines character
definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than
characters. The love affair between MaCleane and Rebecca is no
different, emotionless and unrealistic. When the script calls for
Macleane to decide between going to America and going to meet his
lover, there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for
him to abandon his goal; he and Rebecca barely even speak to each other
throughout the film.</P>
<P>Plunkett and MaCleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over
substance but since its style, quite frankly, blows, the film has no
hope of succeeding on any level. I wanted to appreciate this movie on
the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but I couldn't -- it was so
kinetic it gave me a headache.</P>
