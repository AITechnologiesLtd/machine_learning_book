<P>        GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH is a noisy, unoriginal, and altogether
unnecessary sequel.  The film tries to fashion itself as an AIRPLANE-style,
no-holds-barred parody.  And to be honest, some of the movie's satire is
surprisingly amusing.  The problem is that the laughs in GREMLINS 2 aren't
consistent enough and don't come often enough to keep the film moving.
About every five or ten minutes, GREMLINS 2 comes up with a clever gag, but
in between you have to suffer through some awfully chaotic and deadly dull
sequences, as the gruesome gremlins belch, bang, and brawl their way
through the movie.</P>
<P>        GREMLINS 2 reunites Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, the
protagonists from the original movie.  Galligan is adequate in the lead
role, but Cates proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that her acting lessons
were a terrible waste of time and money.  The sequel also features
Christopher Lee (as a mad genetic scientist), Gedde Watanabe (as a
camera-happy tourist) and John Glover, who gives a savory comic performance
as Daniel Clamp, a wealthy entrepreneur who is the epitome of egotism and a
wonderful take-off on Donald Trump and Ted Turner.  The movie also has fun
with cameos by wrestler Hulk Hogan, film critic Leonard Maltin and director
Paul Bartel.</P>
<P>        In case you care, the plot this time around has the mischievous
little buggers wreaking havoc on Clamp Centre, an automated, ultra-modern,
high-rise office building in Manhattan.  Come to think of it, the movie
could have killed two birds with one stone if it had brought in Bruce
Willis to thwart the monster-terrorists.  Imagine, "Die Hard 2: The Next
Batch."  Now, THAT'S high concept.</P>
