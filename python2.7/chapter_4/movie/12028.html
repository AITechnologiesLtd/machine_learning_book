<PRE>TWILIGHT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        After "Nobody's Fool" (the low-key, unsullied Paul Newman drama
from 1994, not the Rosanna Arquette romantic "comedy" from 1986), I had
high hopes for "Twilight," the latest film to team director Robert Benton
with the man whose salad dressing has become a staple in my household.</P>
<P>        Benton's "Nobody's Fool" was a thoughtful, satisfying, small-town
drama which, along with Newman's typically fine work, was tempered by a
couple of standout performances from the unlikely guises of Bruce Willis
and Melanie Griffith.  In his first film since then, Benton has assembled
another first-rate cast headed up by Newman, Susan Sarandon, and Gene
Hackman.  But this small-time film noir, about an ex-cop turned private
investigator, turned retiree, turned drunk, is remarkably--and
disappointingly--ordinary.</P>
<PRE>        You can't fault the performances though.</PRE>
<P>        Sarandon and Hackman, who play fading movie stars Jack and
Catherine Ames, are as solid and dependable as you'd expect from two
performers with over fifty films each to their credit.  Newman, too, is as
every bit believable as Harry Ross, the ex-P.I. who lives with the Ames
family and for whom he does occasional odd jobs.  Jobs such as heading down
to Puerta Vallarta to retrieve their teenage daughter Mel, played awkwardly
and toplessly in the opening scenes by the up-and-coming Reese Witherspoon.</P>
<P>        "Finding her was the easy part" Harry intones in the film's noirish
voiceover and, as it turns out, he was right.  This transaction sets up a
boorish running gag about Harry being accidentally shot in the, ahem, inner
thigh.</P>
<P>        But it's his next gig (since nobody's fool enough to buy the
"retired" line) that lands him in even hotter water; Harry finds himself
the unwitting focus of a murder investigation.</P>
<P>        The film pours on the supporting cast like there's no tomorrow but
I took great delight in seeing Liev Schreiber (from "The Daytrippers"),
then M. Emmet Walsh, then Stockard Channing, then James Garner, then
Giancarlo Esposito, then John Spencer, all popping up and contributing to
the proceedings.  It's the proceedings that just aren't all that special.</P>
<P>        "Twilight" is a moody gumshoe tale that, although well acted,
doesn't really take off.  The plot's twists and turns, if you can call them
that, aren't particularly riveting, and the substance of the piece, while
tried and true, seems almost too tried and true.  It's always fun watching
Newman, Sarandon, and Hackman--even though they've all done better work
elsewhere--as well as the supporting players but the writing (by Benton and
Richard Russo) is, sadly, tepid and uninvolving.</P>
<P>        There's not enough mystery, intrigue, or depth to make the film
play like something from the pen of Dashiell Hammett.  And there's not
enough style or atmosphere for it to rank alongside such noir classics as
"Chinatown," "The Maltese Falcon" or yes, even "L.A. Confidential" (nor do
I believe it's even aiming that high).</P>
<P>        No, "Twilight" has much smaller aspirations.  Unfortunately small,
as it does here, often amounts to less.</P>
