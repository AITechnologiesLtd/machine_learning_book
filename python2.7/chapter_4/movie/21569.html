<P>Susan Granger's review of "DREAMING OF JOSEPH LEES"  (Fox Searchlight Films)</P>
<P>This Gothic tale of romantic obsession revolves around a young woman
 named Eva, played by Samantha Morton ("Under the Skin"), who is preoccupied
 with her second cousin. Eva lives with her teenage sister (Lauren
Richardso n) and stern, elderly father (Frank Finlay) in the rural
English county of S omerset. She works as a clerk but fantasizes about
Joseph Lees - that's Rupe rt Graves - who has been the unrequited
object of her affection since childh ood. When her precocious little
sister discovers her secret, she plots to ge t the two together. The
fact that the handsome ex-soldier, now a geologist, has lost his leg
in a quarry accident in Italy only increases Eva's fervent
fascination. And she's hardly deterred by the ardent pursuit of a dull
local pig farmer, Harry Flyte (Lee Ross), with whom she moves in,
which is an inexplicably daring and rebellious move, considering it's
the late 1950s. Her explanation is that she doesn't want to "make the
same mistake" that her divorced parents did. Finally, Joseph Lees
trouble begins. There's an immediate physical at traction, pure lust,
which is soon consummated - much to Harry's distress. At this point,
Harry's suicidal depression abruptly becomes the dramatic focus,
resulting in Eva's distraught soul-searching.  Screenwriter Catherine
Linstrum and director Eric Styles concentrate on Eva's sensuality and
character development, leaving Joseph Lees as somewhat of an enigma
and ignoring large plot loopholes. In addition, Harry is such a
clumsy, unappealing rival that there's no tension. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dreaming of Joseph Lees" is a confused,
conflicted 4. It's a murky melodrama about emotional repression that
remains strange and shallow.</P>
