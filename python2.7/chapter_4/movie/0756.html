<PRE>                              THE THIN BLUE LINE
                       A film review by Rogers Cadenhead
                        Copyright 1990 Rogers Cadenhead</PRE>
<P>     Though I'm probably the last person on Earth to see it, I had to comment
on what a remarkable documentary THE THIN BLUE LINE is.  This Errol Morris film
about the Randall Dale Adams capital murder case actually prompted a man's
release from a life sentence.  If there's any more tangible evidence of film's
power to influence change, I have yet to find it.</P>
<P>     For those who don't know about Adams, he was convicted in the late '70s on
the charge of killing a Dallas police officer.  Robert Wood was shot five times
at close range as he approached a car for a routine traffic stop because its
lights were off.  By all indications, he was going to let the driver off with a
warning, but he never got the chance.  The driver sped off as Wood bled to
death on a busy West Dallas street.</P>
<P>     This event alone is tragic: Wood was a young officer with a wife, and
though it was November, his Christmas present was already bought and hidden at
home -- a bulletproof vest to keep him safe.</P>
<P>     But the tragedy involves more than Wood, because a look at the evidence of
the case (and the dubious credibility of key witnesses for the prosecution)
shows that the crime had another victim: Randall Dale Adams.</P>
<P>     Adams, a drifter from Ohio, had only recently stopped in Dallas and taken
a job in the weeks before the killing.  He was still living at a motel in a
low-rent part of Dallas County.  On Thanksgiving Weekend, on his way home from
work early because his bosses had decided not to open for business, Adams ran
out of gas and was walking with a gas can in hand when a man stopped his car
and offered him a ride.  That was David Harris, a 16-year-old West Texas teen.</P>
<P>     The two men spent a shiftless day together, grabbing a burger, drinking
beers, going to a B-movie at a drive-in and, according to Harris, smoking
marijuana.  That night at 12:30 a.m., someone in Harris' car shot Wood to
death.  Because of that fact, the stories of the two men are dramatically
different about the last few hours of that day.</P>
<P>     Adams said he was tired of hanging out with Harris -- mainly because the
teen carried several guns in his car and had even fired one into the air during
the day.  So Adams said he got a lift to his motel and Harris drove off at
about 9 or 9:30 p.m.</P>
<P>     Harris said after the shooting that he and Adams were still together at
midnight, and Adams was the driver who fired the shots as Harris cringed in the
front seat.  After Adams was first arrested, three witnesses appeared who
placed him in the driver's seat moments before the shootings.</P>
<P>     On its face, this may seem like an open-and-shut case against Adams, and
to renowned Dallas County prosecutor Doug Mulder it was just that.</P>
<P>     However, Adams was a man without a criminal record who had gotten a ride
from Harris, while Harris was driving a car he had stolen which contained guns
he had stolen.  Who had more to lose when Robert Wood approached the car?
After the crime, Harris went back to his native Vidor and bragged about killing
a cop, a story he changed after meeting with police.</P>
<P>     In THE THIN BLUE LINE, Morris brings out these details and other damning
evidence against the legal system in Dallas County.  As a native of Dallas, I
think I'm justified to be frightened and repulsed by the actions of public
officials against Adams.  The presumption of innocence and the idea of justice
were completely disregarded in this case.  Adams calls Dallas "a hell on
Earth," and after his treatment, the Linnell Geter case and another two that
surfaced this past year, I think he's probably right.  There has been little
justice here.</P>
<P>     If you want to see true, rent Morris' THE THIN BLUE LINE.  The legal
systems we take for granted and expect to perform without failure are often
corrupted to appease the public, without regard to the rights of innocent
people.</P>
<P>     Forget FRIDAY THE 13TH or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.  The real horror
stories are occurring in courtrooms and prisons.</P>
