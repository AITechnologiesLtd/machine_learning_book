Can't Help Singing (1944)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 44</PRE>
<P>Deanna Durbin is one of Hollywood's forgotten stars from the
1940s.  She was energetic and wholesome, and had a
very impressive singing voice, suitable for the opera.
She was a perfect role model for young teenage girls.
But when her career was at a peak, she turned her back
on stardom to live in seclusion in France.</P>
<P>"Can't Help Singing" was her only technicolor film, and of
course it was a musical.  Good production values and costumes 
keep it watchable.  The plot is minimal however, and the story
wanders aimlessly along, resulting in a pleasant but forgettable
movie.</P>
<P>"Can't Help Singing" apparently takes place during the 1850s.
Durbin plays the daughter of a U.S. Senator.  She loves
a military officer, but her father despises him, and sends
his regiment to California.  Durbin impetously runs away
to find him.  Along the way, she picks up companions:
a pair of thieves (Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey) and a 
card shark (Robert Paige).  She 'hates' Paige at first, but 
soon predictably falls for him and must choose between Paige 
and her soldier boy.</P>
<P>Tamiroff, a noted Hollywood supporting actor who had just
won a Golden Globe for "For Whom the Bell Tolls", is wasted here.
Tamiroff and Kinskey are obligated to provide comic relief
as blundering thieves who mistakingly believe something valuable 
is in Durbin's trunk.  They are given terrible lines and
direction by Frank Ryan, who was responsible for both.</P>
<P>The songs were composed by Jerome Kern. They pass the 
hummability test, but otherwise aren't particularly good.
The title song is reprised enough times that, after viewing
the picture, you may find the tune reprised in your own 
head for the next few days.</P>
