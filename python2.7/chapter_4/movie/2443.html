<PRE>                               GUARDING TESS
                       A film review by Mark Takacs
                        Copyright 1994 Mark Takacs</PRE>
<PRE>Tri-Star Films / rated PG-13 
Starring:  Nicolas Cage            Shirley MacLaine        Richard Griffiths
Classification: Comedy / Drama
Tak Rating: see once as a matinee    </PRE>
<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     A Secret Service agent goes head-to-head with a tenacious,
spirited, former-first lady.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Secret Service agent Douglas (Nicolas Cage) is called back for a
second three-year term at the Secret Service's worst assignment,
guarding former First Lady Tess Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine).  Fur flies
as Douglas tries to enforce Service protocol, while Tess just wants
respect and privacy.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     As a fan Nicolas Cage fan, I try and see him whenever I can.  I've
also been impressed by Shirley MacLaine's acting.  So I looked forward
to their pairing.  In GUARDING TESS, MacLaine's strong-willed character
is constantly bucking at Cage's strongly enforced security rules and
restrictions.  GUARDING TESS's funniest moments come from this
interaction as they constantly jockey and battle for the dominance.</P>
<P>     There's also an undercurrent going on.  They're fond of each
other, but not to the casual observer.  As GUARDING TESS opens,
Douglas's term of duty is over, but Tess likes him enough to pulls
strings and have him reassigned.  When Douglas asks why she did this
despite their conflicts, she replies, "Because I like you, Douglas."</P>
<P>     Douglas is often frustrated by Tess's stunts, and the lack of more
active assignments.  The only action he has to deal with are
ridiculously humorous excursions to the supermarket.  "We have lost
interest in peas, repeat, lost interest in peas..."  When something
finally happens, as it inevitably must, he is caught flat-footed.
Which leads to a scene where a superior berates him, saying "Are you
telling me that *seven* trained and heavily armed Secret Service agents
can't guard one senior citizen?!?".</P>
<P>     I laughed a lot during the first half of GUARDING TESS.  But about
two-thirds of the way through, it suddenly turned into a half-hearted
suspense drama.  The laughs went away and were replaced with
serious-faced goon squads to try and solve the crime.  Fortunately, the
deviation into bad suspense-drama doesn't last long and GUARDING TESS
redeems itself at the last moment by returning to comedy.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     GUARDING TESS is a decent comedy that turns into a bad suspense
drama near the end.  If you're a fan of either Shirley MacLaine or
Nicolas Cage (like I am), you might want to check it out as a matinee.
Otherwise, GUARDING TESS can probably wait.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
   watch it on cable            see it several times - full and/or matinee
 X see once as a matinee    see many times at full price
