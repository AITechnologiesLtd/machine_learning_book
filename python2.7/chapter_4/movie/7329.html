<PRE>                                DELIVERANCE
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>It's hard to imagine that director John Boorman's harrowing and
hauntingly symmetrical film 'Deliverance' is actually a quarter of a
century old.  Released in 1972 and nominated for three Academy Awards,
Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing (I can't believe
there were no acting nominations), it tells the story of four Georgia
businessmen (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox) out
for a weekend of fresh air and the best that nature has to offer and
instead they encounter the worst it has to offer.  The film builds
momentum slowly like a roller coaster riding its tracks to the top and
then releases its fury of adventure and nightmarish commentary on the
human conscience.</P>
<P>The quartet of actors mentioned (it was the film debut of Beatty and
Cox) set out on an expedition to enjoy each other's company and the
company of the outdoors and all is well until they become separated and
Voight and Beatty are left to the tender mercies of two sadistic
mountain men who aspire to violently beat, humiliate and rape them.
Rescued by Reynolds and Cox, one of the mountain men is killed in the
process and the main characters have to decide what to do with the
body.  From that point on they really get to know each other's killer
instinct for survival and primal weakness to be preyed upon.  The real
star of this picture of Reynolds.  Void of a moustache and the
trappings of a 'Smokey and the Bandit' atmosphere Reynolds proved his
acting ability head and shoulders above the rest of the cast as his
portrait of a man who will do anything to survive is both chilling and
brave in the same breath.</P>
<P>Jon Voight is a rather sombre character in the film, perfect to match
Reynolds' personality and Beatty and Cox are equally impressive in
their film debuts as a rape victim and a man lacking the intestinal
fortitude of surviving the conflict of man vs. man.  If you can find a
widescreen version of this true American classic, rent it.  Its scenery
needs to be fully enjoyed to appreciate the entire film and
'Deliverance' is about as realistic a picture as any I have ever seen.</P>
