<P>     Although three-quarters of DEAD PRESIDENTS (the title refers to
the portraits on money) takes place in the Bronx, it's the segment away
from New York that drives the story.  There have been any number of
Vietnam tales--Oliver Stone has made a career out of that time and
place--but none with quite the perspective of the Hughes Brothers'.
This is the story of a black man who goes off to war as a relative
innocent, and returns a decorated hero whose only scars are inside.
His re-acclimatization to civilian life is difficult, but, unlike some
of his friends, he never turns to drugs, and isn't averse to working
hard to earn a living.  Sometimes, however, good intentions and a
valiant effort aren't enough.  In detailing one man's actions and their
consequences, DEAD PRESIDENTS isn't just an African American tragedy --
its impact is universal.  People of any color can sympathize with the
plight of Anthony Curtis and understand, if not agree with, the
eventual choices life forces him to make.</P>
<P>     DEAD PRESIDENTS opens in 1969, as Anthony (Larenz Tate) is about
to graduate from high school.  Not wanting to go to college, but
needing to get away from home to find himself, he enrolls in the Marine
Corps, and heads off to Vietnam, leaving behind a middle-class family,
a pregnant girlfriend (Rose Jackson), and a mentor/small time crook,
Kirby (Keith David), who is like a second father.  Joining Anthony in
the military are two of his close friends, Skip (Chris Tucker) and Jose
(Freddy Rodriguez).  When Anthony finally comes back to the Bronx in
1973, after two tours of duty, he discovers that returning to "normal"
life isn't easy or pleasant.</P>
<P>     Although DEAD PRESIDENTS isn't as intense or wrenching as the
Hughes Brothers' debut feature, MENACE II SOCIETY, the scope is
different.  In addition to being a period piece, this film is concerned
with the detailed examination of one character--a decent, diligent,
upright young man whose morality and judgment are twisted by the
pressures of his environment.  DEAD PRESIDENTS is also somewhat
different from most of the vast number of cinematic Vietnam experiences
because its focus is on how the overseas trauma contributes to the
reconstruction of a man's character.  DEAD PRESIDENTS isn't awash in
originality, but its black perspective hasn't yet been overdone, and
the Hughes Brothers' add their unique imprint to the narrative.</P>
<P>     Larenz Tate, who played O-Dog in MENACE, reunites with the twin
film makers in their second feature.  His role here requires greater
range (although less intensity), and he carries it off with aplomb.
The remainder of the cast is as strong, featuring standout performances
by Keith David, N'Bushe Wright (as the sister of Anthony's girlfriend),
and comedian Chris Tucker.  Tucker's work is noteworthy, as he manages
to provide a fair amount of comic relief without compromising the
viability of his character.</P>
<P>     Even though DEAD PRESIDENTS is more about the effects of poverty
than those of racism, only the most naive viewer could completely
dissociate the two.  Nevertheless, the Hughes Brothers don't overtly
introduce race as an issue.  Instead, this is about the failure of
society, and how desperation, more than greed, can lead to radical and
violent acts.  The film is not perfect--certain sequences are awkward
or drawn from stock, and many of the supporting characters are
stereotypes--but solid storytelling and tight pacing push DEAD
PRESIDENTS through its weak spots.  The result not only reaffirms the
Hughes Brothers' ability as film makers, but shows they can go beyond
the limits of the urban street drama they presented so forcefully in
MENACE II SOCIETY.</P>
