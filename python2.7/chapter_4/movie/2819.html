<PRE>                                    MILK MONEY
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     MILK MONEY is a smart, funny comedy that presents a very knowing
look at early adolescence while also showing a believable and charming
romance between two unlikely adults.  The film is only slightly
undermined by a somewhat inappropriate climax.</P>
<P>     As the film begins, we meet three pre-teen boys who are just
starting to become facinated and curious about the opposite sex.  They
decide to pool their money and go to nearby New York City because they
had heard there were girls there who would take their clothes off for
money.  There they meet a kindly prostitute played by Melanie
Griffith.  When her car breaks down after driving the boys home, one of
them begins working to bring her together with his lonely, widowed
father.  The premise is difficult to describe in print without making
the film sound kind of lurid, but it is actually handled with a great
deal of sensitivity.  It is also surprisingly believable.</P>
<P>     The greatest strength of John Mattson's screenplay is the very
convincingly drawn characters.  The very first scene of the film
features the three boys up in a treehouse trying to outdo each other
with gross comments.  The scene generates a lot of laughs from the
audience, but these boys also sound like >real< little boys.  Mattson
has a very good ear for the ways that kids that age really talk.  The
conversation inevitably switches to an innocent discussion of the
opposite sex and this is also handled in a very real, believable
manner.  This believability is maintained throughout the film including
scenes involving other kids as well.  One scene that particularly
stands out shows a group of young girls observing and commenting on
Griffith's character.  It was a very wise move to include this scene
(as well as a couple others) that show an adolescent female point of
view.  This is one of the best American film portrayals of this age
group in recent memory.</P>
<P>     Griffith's character is also very well written.  She is written as
a good person who has simply ended up in an undesirable lifestyle.  The
film does not glamourize prostitution in any way.  Instead, quite a bit
of time is spent on the dehumanizing aspect of it and on Griffith's
strong wish to get her humanity back.  This film will likely generate
some comparisons with PRETTY WOMAN, and I think its biggest advantage
over that film is the fact that Griffith's character is not rescued by
a client (I suppose you could argue that the kids were "clients", but
not in the same way as the Richard Gere character in PRETTY WOMAN).  In
this film, the character is rightfully shown as needing to get >away<
from prostitution in order to better her life.</P>
<P>     After giving some teriffic performances early in her career,
Griffith's last several films have been very disappointing.  This is
the best role that she has had since WORKING GIRL and she is absolutely
teriffic in it.  This character is smart and streetwise, but also has a
certain sadness and even a hint of innocence.  The character goes
through a number of emotional transformations during this film and
Griffith plays them all convincingly.  It pleases me immensely to see
her in such a good role once again.</P>
<P>     Ed Harris may seem like an odd choice to play a romantic lead
opposite Griffith, but they have a surprising amount of chemistry.
Harris' character shows a great deal of love and caring towards his
son, but also a certain sadness as he has never quite stopped mourning
his wife (who died in childbirth).  The warm, tentative romance between
Harris and Griffith is very well played and effective.  Harris has
always had a talent for playing characters who seem gruff on the
outside, but with a great deal of warmth between the surface.  This
talent is definitely on display in this character.</P>
<P>     The young actor who plays Harris' son is also very good
(unfortunately, I didn't catch his name and it isn't listed in the
advertisements for the film).  Many of the film's best scenes involve
the slow development of the relationship between Griffith and the boy.
In fact, the film really could have used more scenes between them.  The
son's relationship with the other kids is also very well played.  He is
allowed to take some very tentative first steps towards romance with
some of the other kids his age and this is very realistically played.
The kid had quite a few scenes that brought back childhood memories.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Mattson included an unnecessary subplot involving a
mobster (played by Malcolm McDowell, in a seriously over-the-top
performance) trying to find Griffith under the belief that she has
stolen some money from her pimp.  Luckily, this subplot is kept in the
background during most of the film, but it does come to the foreground
during the film's climax.  The result is a climactic sequence where the
romance and characters are largely replaced by unnecessary action
sequences (the film >really< didn't need a car chase).  The movie does
get back on track towards the very end, though, and this subplot
certainly isn't enough to diminish the film's strengths.</P>
<P>     Richard Benjamin has had a spotty career as a director with films
ranging from dreadful (MY STEPMOTHER IS AN ALIEN) to pretty good
(MERMAIDS).  This is probably his best directing job, showing good
comic timing and bringing out some strong performances.  The film is
also the first project from the new production company founded by
former Spielberg partners Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall and it
shows that they may have been major contributors to the general high
quality of productions that have come out of Amblin Entertainment over
the years.</P>
<P>     While MILK MONEY isn't a perfect film, it is very funny and
entertaining with a surprisingly smart script and some teriffic
performances.  It is very much worth seeing.</P>
