 Music of the Heart (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Meryl Streep,
Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven</P>
<P> A woman is deserted by her husband, left with two small boys to raise.
She has to find a job. Her only vocation is playing the violin. She has
taught some students, but has never held a full-time job.</P>
<P> The woman, through a friend, learns of an inner-city, alternative school
and talks the principal into giving her a job.</P>
<P> Over the years, the program grows until it is threatened by budget cuts.
The teacher, the principal, parents and various friends unite with the
students to put on a concert to save the music program.</P>
<P> This sounds like a Lifetime made-for-TV movie. Or worse, one of those
do-gooder films, such as "Dangerous Minds," in which a white educator
ventures into the inner city to help better the lives of minority students.</P>
<P> Well, as the adage goes, life imitates art. But with "Music of the Heart,"
we have art imitating life.</P>
<P> The movie is based on the true story of Roberta Guaspari, who did initiate
a violin program in East Harlem. Guaspari, a Navy wife, was deserted by her
husband and left to raise two boys.</P>
<P> After 10 years, budget cuts eliminated her program and the community did
rally to save it. A concert was staged at Carnegie Hall featuring many of
Guaspari's students as well as such violin greats as Isaac Stern and Itzhak
Perlman.</P>
<P> "Music of the Heart" is a life-affirming, feel-good movie.</P>
<P> It also is a paean to music - and its ability to serve as a catalyst to
build character, self-esteem and self-confidence.</P>
<P> What sets "Music of the Heart" apart from other such films is Meryl
Streep's performance. At first, her Roberta is a shattered, scared woman
who only feels sorry for herself and her situation.</P>
<P> But as she settles into her new position, her confidence and her
self-worth increase at the same time she instills these emotions into her
students.</P>
<P> Admittedly, the movie is a bit cliched. Yet, life can be cliched. People
such as Roberta Guaspari who through sheer determination raise themselves
up do exist. We read about them everyday.</P>
<P> Streep's eyes light up when she is teaching her students. She is a
taskmaster who bullies, cajoles and threatens her students, always pushing
them to do better, to raise their standards and continue testing themselves.</P>
<P> "Music of the Heart" falters in its portrayal of Roberta's private life.
Her failed relationship with an old high school classmate, Brian (Aidan
Quinn), seems forced.</P>
<P> Otherwise, the movie contains few missteps.</P>
<P> Angela Bassett is fiery and strong as the school principal who fights for
Roberta's program. Also featured are Cloris Leachman as Roberta's mother,
Gloria Estefan as a fellow teacher who befriends Roberta and Jane Leeves as
a friend who helps organize Roberta's concert.</P>
<P> The foundation of the film is Streep's interaction with the various
children who play her students. They sulk, complain, connive and only
grudgingly tolerate Roberta, until they begin to realize the gift she is
driving into them.</P>
<P> The most incredible aspect of "Music of the Heart" is that it is directed
by Wes Craven. Yes, that Wes Craven, the horrormeister who has given us
"Nightmare on Elm Street," "Last House on the Left," "Scream" and "Scream
2."</P>
<P> Craven demonstrates that he is not limited to horror films. His direction
is sure, his camera work straight-on. He lets his characters tell the
story, no fancy tricks.</P>
<P> Even at a bit over two hours, "Music of the Heart" holds you. It is a
movie you will stand up and cheer, a film that offers a positive message
that may also inspire as well as entertain.</P>
