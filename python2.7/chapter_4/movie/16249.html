<P>   When I taught high-school history we had to follow the
syllabus exactly.  One lesson dealing with the close of World
War II had the title, "Japan's Loss is a Blessing in Disguise
for the Japanese People." Pretty presumptuous of New York
State to make that judgment, isn't it?  The department of
education is virtually saying, "Who won the war anyway?" and
when you look at the Japan of 1990 and compare it to the
feudal country that existed until the mid-19th century and
liken the currently prosperous state with the immediate post-
war economy of shoddy goods and cheap labor, you might
even agree.</P>
<P>  Could we say the same thing when we look at the Vietnam
of the past decade?  Though the United States dropped more
firepower on that little nation than it did in all the conventional
bombings of World War 2, you wonder why.  The U.S. would
have won the war without ever dropping by.  Looking at
Saigon--which was seized by the North and renamed Ho Chi
Minh City (though nobody calls it that)--it appears so
capitalistic that you'd think the U.S. prevailed and made the
place in its own image.  Some of the early images that strike
the viewer of Tony Bui's meditative, profoundly lyrical "Three
Seasons"--the neon street advertisements for Maxwell tapes
and products, for Ricoh cameras; the glitzy hotels patronized
by rich Vietnamese, Europeans and Americans--we can but
come away with the impression that the Communist leaders
of Vietnam avoided the mistakes made by Fidel Castro in
Cuba.  Of course Saigon was not a Communist-run city until
after the war.  But rather than proletarianize the infrastructure
by converting hotels into deteriorating housing for visiting
dignitaries and cracking down on prostitution, the honchos of
the now-united Vietnam look the other way at street hustling.
They may see the profession perhaps as a way to attract
dollars, and condone geisha-style girls in the plush lodgings
to lure the greenbacks to the Indochinese state.  How does
this film allow us to make these assumptions?  The
production notes state that the censors followed the
filmmakers around and scrutinized every foot of celluloid,
refusing to allow a discarded meat bun to pass muster while
feeling perfectly at ease with the peregrinations of a smart-
looking, well-dressed hooker.</P>
<P>   If "Three Seasons" were simply a testament to the power
of capitalism to hold sway where violence failed, it would hold
only minor interest with any but a specialized audience. 
Agitprop is hardly the stuff of entertainment.  At its core the
picture deals poetically with troubled people, individuals
seeking some sort of closure in their lives, some resolution to
their difficulties.  As James Hager, a GI who had fought the
Viet Cong some thirty years earlier and is now back in Saigon
on a different mission, Harvey Keitel is not the most
compelling character.  But he is the one most likely to
engage a western public.  Hager has been spending time in
Saigon eager to meet the daughter he left behind after his
brief affair with a Vietnamese woman.  He spends his days
lounging outside the hotel, his nights drunk in a bar known as
"Apocalypse Now."  Though he appears to the cyclo drivers
who observe him day after day to be a kind of zombie, he
emerges as a compassionate man eager to resolve what he
calls his problem with Vietnam.  Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc
Hiep), yet another person seeking some form of completion,
is a young woman who has taken the job of picking lotus
flowers as women had done for generations, selling them in
the city.  A poet at heart, she meets the reclusive supervisor
of the lotus pond, Teacher Dao (Tran Manh Cuong), who was
once handsome but is now being consumed by leprosy. 
When Dao--who invites young Kien to his darkened room in a
temple--informs her that he used to write poetry but then lost
his fingers to the dread disease, she offers her own fingers
and becomes entranced with the Teacher's recitations of
verse.  The most riveting relationship, however, is between
Lan (Zoe Bui), a prostitute who works the plush hotels like
the Majestic, and her admirer, Hai (Don Duong), who hangs
about her hotels like a puppy to offer her rides.  Hai's
ambition is to earn the $50 that Lan requires of men who
want to spend the night with her.  Because of his love for the
woman, however, he has no intention of exploiting her and
will prove instrumental in resolving Lan's own incompleteness
as well as his own.</P>
<P>   The acting of the ensemble is first-rate throughout, not
unexpected considering that Don Duong is Vietnam's best-
known actor and that 108 kids auditioned for the part of yet
another principal, Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a street urchin
who sells trinkets to tourists and winds up involved in quite
an adventure himself.  Ironically, the film proves more critical
of capitalism than you might expect the Communist
government to be.  In a rare meditative mood, Lan tells her
admiring cyclo driver of the rich folks she observes, "We live
in their shadows every time they build a new hotel...they're
not like us...I'll do anything, even marry one, to live as they
do."</P>
<P>   Director Tony Bui, a 26-year-old Vietnamese American who
fell in love with the Far Eastern country he had not seen until
he was 19 years of age, scatters his film with metaphors. 
They do not get in the way, however, but add immeasurably
to the film's deliberate charm.  Kien An complains that people
are buying more plastic flowers than her natural lotuses:
"convenience is everything for them...the flowers will not wilt
or die."  Even those who do not care for the slow pace of the
story or the absence of American-style melodrama will 
appreciate cinematographer Lisa Rinzler's photography. 
Rinzler contrasts the dilapidated side streets with the bright
lights of the Saigon's "Ginza"; the rustic simplicity of the lotus
pond with the drunken entertainment of the tourists and
wealthier citizens.  Working with a crew that included both
Vietnamese and Americans, director Tony Bui has turned out
a spiritual meditation on a peaceful people whose nationalist
spirit successfully repelled Chinese, French and American
invaders but has become itself overrun with the fast pace and
modern spirit of capitalism.</P>
