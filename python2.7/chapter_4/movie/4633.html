<P>     FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, along with its successor, GOLDFINGER, 
represents Bond at his best.  Although the series has run for more than 
thirty years with seventeen "official" entries, it has yet to better, or 
even equal, what it achieved in 1963-1964 with the release of these two 
films.  By combining solid storylines, tightly-paced action sequences, 
memorable villains, and Sean Connery in top form, RUSSIA and GOLDFINGER 
mark the cinematic apex for Ian Fleming's 007.</P>
<P>     The elements of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE move the movie closer to the 
recognizable "Bond formula" than was the case for its predecessor, DR. 
NO.  Here, the action scenes are more numerous and generate added 
tension, the title sequence has a familiar flavor, John Barry's 
distinctive score replaces the workmanlike music of Monty Norman, Q 
makes his first appearance, and Connery tones up 007's sophistication 
while downplaying his cold-bloodedness. </P>
<P>     Unlike the megalomaniacs in later Bond films, the villains in FROM 
RUSSIA WITH LOVE aren't after world domination (at least not 
immediately).  In fact, they want something significantly less 
ambitious:  a Russian decoding device.  Two of SPECTRE's top operatives 
are on the mission:  #3, former KGB agent Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), and 
#5, Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), a chess master who has meticulously 
plotted every move and weighed all alternatives.  The pair reports 
directly to the mysterious #1, Blofeld, whose face remains hidden until 
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.</P>
<P>     Kronsteen's manipulative plan involves using Bond and Russian 
cipher clerk Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) as pawns.  Once the 
British agent has obtained the decoding device from Tatiana, SPECTRE 
thug Red Grant (Robert Shaw) is to take it from him, leaving behind a 
corpse.  The plot is suitably complicated (but not so convoluted that 
the viewer will get lost), and, even though 007 suspects a trap, the 
lure of a beautiful woman and a valuable espionage coup is too enticing 
to resist.  So he travels to Istanbul, where Tatiana has arranged to 
meet him.</P>
<P>     Connery, who felt his way through parts of DR. NO, has mastered his 
character by this outing.  He acts the role with confidence and 
familiarity, easily establishing his reputation as the inimitable 007.  
He is surrounded by an interesting supporting cast that includes Miss 
Universe 1960, Daniela Bianchi (whose voice was dubbed over), and Lotte 
Lenya as an especially vicious adversary.  Playing his part with the 
perfect combination of toughness and sly wit, Pedro Armendariz (in his 
final acting appearance) is delightful as Kerim Bay, Bond's Turkish 
ally.</P>
<P>     FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is among the most tightly-plotted of all the 
Bond films, and, as a result, is one of the shortest.  It moves briskly, 
blending intrigue, romance, and action into an immensely satisfying 
whole.  RUSSIA exudes style, as typified by a fight in a gypsy camp 
where Bond offhandedly dispatches rogues to the strains of John Barry's 
"007 theme".  This movie has several such memorable moments, including 
an inventively choreographed fight sequence with Bond and Grant going at 
it in the confined space of two train compartments.  Shortly after that, 
there's a death-defying chase between Bond and a helicopter.</P>
<P>     Standing at the pinnacle of the series, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE shows 
how good a Bond film can be when all the ingredients mesh.  This movie 
isn't just a fun popcorn-munching action adventure flick; it's a good 
motion picture by any standards.  </P>
