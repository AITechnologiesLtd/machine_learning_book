VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In writer/director Tonie Marshall's VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE (VÉNUS BEAUTÉ 
INSTITUT), Angèle, a beautician long-ago scarred by a love affair gone 
bad, is on the prowl for quick sexual flings with strangers.  "Love is 
just another form of slavery," she explains to Antoine (Samuel Le 
Bihan), an old-fashioned kind of guy, who repulses her by pursuing her 
rather than the other way round and who prefers love before sex.</P>
<P>Angèle is played by Nathalie Baye, who appeared recently and quite 
impressively in AN AFFAIR OF LOVE, an infinitely better film with a 
remarkably similar plot.  In VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE, a light-weight 
comedy and slice-of-life character study, she gets the only fleshed-out 
character.  The rest of the cast are given parts that are little more 
than caricature.  Most of the movie has her pursuing men who aren't 
particularly interested in her, while avoiding the only one who really 
is.</P>
<P>The Venus Beauty Institute, where Angèle works, has a potpourri of 
clients, but most are elderly women looking for miracle cures to stop 
their skin from aging.  "It takes the skin down memory lane," Madame 
Nadine (Bulle Ogier), the shop's proprietor, lectures Angèle and her 
fellow beauticians about one of the beauty shop's many magical 
concoctions, which range from anti-aging creams to seaweed wraps.</P>
<P>The story is full of whimsical subplots.  One is about a young woman 
with a killer body who always shows up wearing only a trench coat and 
high heels for her tanning session.  She loves to parade around the 
salon strip naked, which attracts the eyes of passersby on the street.  
Another involves a man who comes in to get his wife's skin treated.  
After he was badly burned, his wife gave him the skin off of her buttock 
to be grafted onto his face.  Since she is now deceased, he feels 
obligated to take good care of what little is left of her.</P>
<P>Probably the most interesting part of the movie is it's choice of perky 
colors of pink and powder blue.  This is complemented by the salon's 
relentlessly cheery chimes, which ring whenever a customer enters or 
exits.  Although pleasant enough, the movie, with its most memorable 
parts being its color scheme and sound effects, is not something worth 
recommending.  Nathalie Baye's other recent film, AN AFFAIR OF LOVE, on 
the other hand, is outstanding and definitely worth recommending.</P>
<P>VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE runs 1:45.  The film is in French with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for full-frontal nudity, 
sex and language.</P>
