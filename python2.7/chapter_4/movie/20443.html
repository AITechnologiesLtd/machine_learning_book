<PRE>The Sixth Sense (PG-13) *** 1/2
Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>An announcement to the world, I have finally seen The Sixth Sense. At first I
didn't want to go, it just didn't sound like that appealing of a movie. Then
one of my friend's told me to go see it, but they like Adam Sandler, so I
dismissed their comment at first. Then my parent's friend went to go see it,
and they loved it. Then my dad's boss said that he and his wife loved it, so
naturally we had to go. And boy was I surprised. Anyone that does not want to
see this movie because it promises to be and scary, and really isn't (there are
only so many Lake Placid's, Deep Blue Sea's, and Blair Witch Project's that you
can see) should suspend all disbelief and go and see this film now. Anyone that
can make up another stupid excuse such as, but I'd rather go to Hooters, or
let's rent a movie instead, should come to their senses (the seventh sense
perhaps?) and see this film immediately.</P>
<P>Malcolm Crowe (Willis, excellent in a non-action film role) is a child
psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients that still believes he
is a freak. A year after he recovers from the shooting, he is assigned his
first new case. Cole Sear (Joel Osment, who I'll be rooting for at the Oscars)
is a disturbed child that is constantly plagued by these horrific visions and
receives multiple stab wounds without ever really getting hurt. Malcom is
frightened as he finds this child to be more and more like the person that shot
him.</P>
<P>So when Cole tells him that he can see dead people (OK, I realize that I am
giving away a major plot point, but all of the ads include those words so I
might as well anyway) he doesn't believe him at first, but as time goes by, be
begins to believe in the supernatural.</P>
<P>Great performances from the entire cast, especially Haley Joel Osment (all you
people that say young people today can't act or win Oscars have been proven
wrong! Heck, if a guy who doesn't speak English can win for being in a truly
magical film, a kid can win for acting in a hella spooky one) and Toni Collette
as his mother. Bruce Willis also belongs on the nomination list, (but will
probably be forgotten with other should be nominees like director Tom Tykwer
and Dan Hedaya in "Dick." If my first paragraph hasn't convinced you to see the
film yet, there are also wild sex scenes that show graphic nudity from all
members of the Dawson's Creek cast, (heck, why not use false statements and
fake advertising to promote a product, it's been done before) and the film is
scarier than Blair Witch (true.) What are you waiting for? Go, now, to the
theater and see The Sixth Sense, which gets *** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>ADDITIONAL NOTE: If the surprise twist at the end doesn't give you a heart
attack, I think that only the nachos they serve at the refreshment counter
will.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains some very chilling scenes of dead people,
vomiting, and poisioning. Good Age: 12-13 & Up</P>
