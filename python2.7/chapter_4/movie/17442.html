<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 star</P>
<P>The films of Jean-Claude Van Damme are not exactly listed on the AFI's
top 100, but they sure have provided us with a few chuckles and hoots.
John Woo's 1993 piece Hard Target built at least a couple of genuinely
entertaining scenes, and even 1998's Legionnaire had too much energy and
atmosphere to be ridden off completely.  But even Van Damme - a veteran
of bad movies - deserves better than Knock Off.  Writer Steven De Souza
gave Beverly Hills Cop III charm and excitement, but none of that is on
show here.  Knock Off bumbles and fumbles its way through a messy plot,
advancing from each dreary subplot to the next with no hint of a
coherent storyboard.   It's almost as if director Hark Tsui's plan was
to baffle viewers so he could disguise the film's paper-thin scripting.</P>
<P>Granted, there are some nice touches.  The editing and camera work is
sometimes stylish (especially in the first half), and the screen absorbs
Van Damme's lively presence with appropriate egotistical flair.  But the
visual novelties of Knock Off quickly wear thin, leaving virtually
nothing to counterbalance.  To make matters worse, the few scenes in
which Knock Off succeeds on a visual level are derivative, and serve no
relevance to the central story.  A well-staged chase scene through the
streets of Hong Kong is pretty much pointless, as is a Jackie Chan like
idea to position Van Damme amongst a building full of attacking Asians.</P>
<P>Marcus Ray (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a tough but friendly meathead, works
as a sales representative for a jeans company in Hong Kong.  His partner
is Tommy Hendricks (Rob Schneider), who is a loud mouth wimp.  Through
one of the film's flimsy plot connections, these two suddenly find
themselves in the midst of a worldwide conspiracy.  This conspiracy
involves the use of micro bombs the size of watch batteries (which, for
some strange reason, produce green flames).  Ray and Hendricks risk
their lives to stop the possible worldwide distribution of these new
devastating gadgets.</P>
<P>There's nothing direly wrong with Van Damme as an actor; his energetic
roles are entirely welcome in a film of this nature.  But his dialogue,
of course, suffers from intoxicatingly simplistic formation, to the
point where he becomes little more than a walking talking joke.  And he
isn't the only one.  Rob Schneider is given the tough job of providing
comic relief with only one or two one-liners that are actually funny.
Chris Tucker provided a nice bit of playful acting in Rush Hour, as did
Steve Buscemi in Armageddon.  Whereas those performers had punchy
dialogue aiding them, Schneider is witless and unfunny - he's just plain
irritating.</P>
<P>Just when action films appeared to be heading in the right direction,
along comes Knock Off, the dumbest film this side of Species 2.  Sure -
many bad movies are entertaining pieces of cinematic fluff - but this is
not one of them.  Irritating and silly, Knock Off is the kind of movie
that gives bad movies a bad name.</P>
