<P>PLOT:
A paranoid radio astronomer stumbles across some aliens talking across his
airwaves and is immediately relieved of his duties from his superiors. After
finding his partner murdered, the suspicious man follows the
extra-terrestrial signal down to Mexico, and finds something beyond even his
spectacular imagination: an apparent alien invasion preparing to take over
the world.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Think John Carpenter's THEY LIVE mixed into a less-pretentious version of
CONTACT, and you've got yourself a pretty neat ALIEN thrill-ride featuring a
pretty solid story, good special effects and enough twists and turns to keep
you interested all the way through. I will be the first to admit that I
never thought I'd see the day that Charlie Sheen would ever make a good
movie again, but boy was I wrong, because this movie is actually quite good,
and intelligent! It's one of those movies that fell through the cracks in
the theatres (Unfortunately it graced the big screen right around the time
that the vastly inferior INDEPENDENCE DAY made its tragic debut), but should
definitely be caught on video, if you are any kind of sci-fi fan. Charlie
Sheen is perfect as the "guy caught in over his head" in a story which moves
along at a decent pace and actually provides some real suspense. It probably
could have used a more powerful ending, but all in all, I had a pretty cool
time watching this flick. If you dig science-fiction, want to see Charlie
Sheen in a good role for once and enjoy the X-Files and their alien
conspiracy theories, there is no reason why you should not be thoroughly
entertained by this intense thriller. But don't take my word for it, Siskel
& Ebert also gave it "two thumbs up!" : )</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is director David N. Twohy's directorial debut. Before this
picture, he was primarily known for having penned a couple of Hollywood's
most infamous screenplays including 1995's WATERWORLD and 1993's THE
FUGITIVE. His career began in 1988 with a much less-ambitious script called
CRITTERS 2: THE MAIN COURSE.
Charlie Sheen's real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez.
Actress Lindsay Crouse starred in the 1987 directorial debut of
playwright/screenwriter David Mamet called HOUSE OF GAMES. The couple were
married at one time and have two daughters together.
This film was originally titled SHOCKWAVE.</P>
