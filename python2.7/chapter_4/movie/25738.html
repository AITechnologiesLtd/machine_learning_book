<P>     If the theme of THE REPLACEMENTS -- and I use the word "theme" so
loosely that it may fall off at any moment -- is that certain overpaid
entertainers have grown complacent and lazy and that audiences prefer
seeing genuine effort, there's more than a teensy bit of irony in it. BAD
NEWS BEARS-style comedies have been the preferred brand of sports film
since ... well, since THE BAD NEWS BEARS. A lovable loser/band of lovable
losers eventually rallies around his/her/its underdog status and surmounts
impossible odds to emerge victorious -- what tale could be more
fundamentally American?</P>
<P>     Of course, the "work ethic" is supposed to be fundamentally American,
too, but you'd never know it from the sort of sleepwalking screenwriting
in THE REPLACEMENTS. Inspired by the 1987 NFL players' strike and the
teams' subsequent hiring of replacement players, the story is set in a
fictional professional football league about to experience its own work
stoppage. The owners, including Washington Sentinels owner Ed O'Neil (Jack
Warden), have decided to play with replacements, and O'Neil hands the job
of putting together his makeshift team to ex-coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene
Hackman). McGinty has plenty of players in mind, but the key to his team
is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a former college All-American quarterback
now scraping barnacles off of fishing boats. Reluctantly, Falco joins the
Sentinels, and tries to rally his rag-tag bunch to a playoff spot.</P>
<P>     Three guesses whether they make it, and the first two don't count,
but never mind that. Never mind too that THE REPLACEMENTS doesn't exactly
treat the labor dispute with any complexity (owners and striking players
bad, cheerleaders and replacement players good). And never mind even that
the music supervisor appears to have been stuck in a time warp in which
nothing recorded after 1985 exists. Movies like THE REPLACEMENTS have
always been about the hijinks of the players, both on and off the field; 
the predictability of the formula has been part of its appeal. There are a
some fun characterizations -- Jon Favreau as an unhinged SWAT
cop-turned-middle linebacker, Rhys Ifans as chain-smoking Welsh soccer
player-turned-placekicker Nigel -- and some amusing confrontations with
the striking players. The losers get better, the bad guys get their
comeuppance, there are some decent chuckles along the way, everyone
applauds. No muss, no fuss.</P>
<P>    And no common sense. For a fairly simple comedy, THE REPLACEMENTS is
full of baffling plot points. What undefined cheerleader sympathy strike
required head cheerleader-and-Keanu-romantic-interest-in-waiting Annabelle
(Brooke Langton) to put together a new group made up of exotic dancers? 
Why was it necessary to bring in the vaguely blackballed McGinty to lead
the replacement team? Why do people keep referring to players on opposing
teams as All-Pros when the regular players are supposed to be on strike?
Why does a team that has been practicing together for less than a week
appear to be running complicated passing plays on every down? Even
ignoring the most obvious question of all -- why cast Keanu Reeves as the
lead in a comedy -- THE REPLACEMENTS appears to have been constructed with
no thought but getting to the big ending, when everyone can applaud for
the triumphant underdog.</P>
<P>     What it comes down to, really, is laziness. Veteran hack comedy
director Howard Deutch (GRUMPIER OLD MEN, THE ODD COUPLE II) is a
button-pusher, knowing how to get the most obvious laughs out of the most
obvious situations at the most obvious times. Mining the potential from
their premise appears way beyond the capacity of Deutch and screenwriter
Vince McKewin. For a "legendary" coach, McGinty sure ignores every
possible creative use of his team's unique abilities. How about a running
play behind sumo tackle Jumbo (Ace Yonamine)? Handing a kickoff return to
speedster receiver Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones)? Quick-kicking with
the thunder-footed Nigel to get good field position? It doesn't take a
tactical gridiron genius to realize that the makers of THE REPLACEMENTS
just don't care. The concept is pre-sold, the fans are in the seats, and
the overpaid entertainers couldn't care less about giving their all for 
the people ultimately paying their salaries. Is anyone interested in
making a movie about replacement film-makers?</P>
