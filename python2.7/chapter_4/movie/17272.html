<PRE>STEPMOM by DeWyNGaLe    * * * *</PRE>
<P>As I saw in the trailers that Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris were
starring in this drama I thought...how could it not be good?  Well, my question
stayed true, considering Stepmom is the best movie of the year.  It is shown as
more of a comedy, but it is mostly a tear jerking drama.  Everyone was in tears
in the theater I was in.  When I sat back in my seat and waited for the movie
to start, little did I know I was about to see the most amazing film since
Titanic.</P>
<P>Susan Sarandon plays Jackie, mother of Ben and Anna.  She was married to Luke
(Ed Harris), but they were divorced three years back when Luke walked out. 
Luke is now seeing Isabel, a young, funny, nice young girl played by Julia
Roberts.  Jackie and the kids despise Isabel though.  Mostly because she is
tearing the family apart by seeing Luke.  Isabel is extremely nice to the kids,
but they don't care.  For instance when Isabel buys them a puppy Anna says
"Well I'm allergic to dogs and I'm allergic to you, too."  </P>
<P>Jackie and Luke have something tremendous to tell one another.  One is more
serious then the other, but Luke goes first.  He lets Jackie know that he and
Isabel are getting married.  At this point, Jackie doesn't say what she wanted
to say and simply states it wasn't important.  But, this thing is extremely
important.  Something that is tremendous.  (I won't tell you what it is
though.)  Jackie continues to lie about her secret to the family.  At this
point, Jackie is sick of all the fuss and wants the family to be happy.  She
gives the kids tips to getting along with Isabel, and they work, a little too
well.  Now the kids think of Isabel as their mother, and Jackie thinks she is
out of the picture.  She becomes very jealous at this point.</P>
<P>Stepmom depicts the average 90s family, with tenseness, sadness, happiness, and
angryness.  This movie is a story about life and the roads that it can take you
on.  It lets you know that you should enjoy what you have because you never
know when it will all come to an end.  Susan Sarandon gives the best
performance of the year and she definitely deserves and Oscar Nomination. 
Roberts and Harris also give outstanding performances.  I don't know about you,
but Stepmom was so special to me, I can't explain it.  Hands down to one of the
greatest movies of the year.</P>
