<PRE>Gloria
Rated (R)
By James Sanford
The Kalamazoo Gazette</PRE>
<P>Roger Ebert has often brought up the idea that instead of rehashing
the classics, filmmakers should concentrate on revising movies that
weren't very good to begin with. Hollywood may have taken his comments
to heart.</P>
<P>Director Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is a loose remake of
the unsuccessful 1964 film of the same name, and now director Sidney
Lumet has tackled "Gloria," based on a 1980 melodrama that was nothing
to shout about, but did feature a memorably flinty, Oscar-nominated
performance by Gena Rowlands.</P>
<P>And what are the results of these experiments?  Malick's epic is
flawed but intermittently fascinating, rife with luscious
imagery. "Gloria," on the other hand, finds Sharon Stone doing her
darnedest to squeeze into Rowlands' high heels, and it doesn't take
long to see they don't become her.</P>
<P>Rowlands' Gloria was a bitter ex-gangster's moll whose heart had long
ago gone into a deep-freeze. Stone's Gloria, aside from the occasional
flip remark or crude comment, turns out to be a soft-shell crab. For a
woman who's supposedly so street-seasoned, she's weirdly skittish and
sentimental.</P>
<P>The reason for her transformation from bad mutha to mother figure is
Nicky Nunez (Jean-Luke Figueroa), a 7-year-old whose family was been
massacred by the henchmen of Gloria's ex-boyfriend Kevin (Jeremy
Northam), minutes after Nicky's dad sent the kid off with a valuable
computer disk and a teary "you da man." For reasons never made clear,
the supposedly steely Gloria steals Nicky from Kevin's clutches and
gives him a tour of New York, all the while dodging the bad guys who
want that precious disk.</P>
<P>Unable to commit to being a thriller or a character study, the movie
settles for being an excitement-free drag. Lumet, whose talent peaked
25 years ago with "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network," throws in one
amazingly sloppy car chase, but otherwise does nothing to perk up the
picture's sluggish pace.</P>
<P>Stone's work here has two modes, shrill and mushy, and her Noo Yawk
accent quickly unravels; in one scene she's talking about having been
in jail for "twee" years, while in the next she sharply pronounces the
"h" in "therapy." Bad dialects also hobble Northam and even George
C. Scott, who turns up briefly as one of Gloria's former sugar
daddies.</P>
<P>If there's anything to be said in the movie's favor, it's that
"Gloria" offers a few glimmers of the natural wit Stone demonstrated
during her recent appearance on Bravo's "Inside the Actors' Studio."
After Nicky, who's shared her motel bed the night before, tells Gloria
he likes sleeping with her, Stone delivers her reply - "You're not the
first guy to tell me that" - with a smug sneer that would have made
Mae West proud. James Sanford</P>
