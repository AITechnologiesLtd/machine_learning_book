<PRE>                                  PERSUASION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Whew!  Sitting through 112 minutes of PERSUASION is a true
exercise in persistence.  Full of performances that could have been
done better by hand puppets, sloppy direction, and a script that's
nearly impossible to follow, PERSUASION has very little to redeem it.</P>
<P>     Pay close attention:  the story follows Anne Elliot (Amanda Root),
a prim and proper twenty-seven-year old in 1814 England.  Having once
turned down a proposal from Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), he has
turned back up to try again.  Also in the picture are Anne's younger
sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), her husband (Simon Russell Beale), and
his sisters (Emma Roberts and Victoria Hamilton), both of whom
Wentworth chases after.  Not to mention Anne's cousin William (Samuel
West), who also chases after Anne in the hopes of getting his fingers
on her father's estate.  The story is based on the Jane Austen novel,
and as you hopefully can tell by this rousing description, it's about
as exciting as...a Jane Austen novel.</P>
<P>     To keep track of these totally bland and uninteresting blokes, the
producers were kind enough to throw in a handy genealogical chart to
help keep track of no fewer than 15 major characters.  Unfortunately,
you won't get one of these with your ticket, so you'll likely be
staring up at the screen in total confusion.  Even more unhelpful is
the costuming, of which two basic varieties are used:  male and
female.  And I've never seen so much *brown* in my life.</P>
<P>     Some fun costumes might have helped ease the pain of sitting
through PERSUASION, considering that all these dull people do is talk
and eat.  Amanda Root is being trumpeted by the producers as the next
Emma Thompson.  I don't think so, seeing how she spends the entire film
just gawking at things like a wide-eyed Chihuahua and then whining
about them.  Oh, and don't expect any grandiose Merchant-Ivory style
landscapes or ballrooms.  Instead, to break up the monotony of the
cramped sitting room settings, director Roger Michell opted for totally
inappropriate MTV-style moving camerawork to capture the sheer nothing
that is going on.</P>
<P>     I hope this is enough to dissuade you from bothering with
PERSUASION.  And I hope I'm not spoiling anything here, by giving away
the movie's final line of dialogue: "Anne?  Why would you want to
marry Anne?"  I'm still working on the answer to that one.</P>
