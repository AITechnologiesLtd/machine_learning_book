<P>   Do you know or did you ever like comic books?  That's like
saying did you ever like bubble gum, lollipops or cotton
candy.  Of course we all did, so the theory that your affinity
for a movie like "Mystery Men" depends on your attitude
toward the comics is irrelevant.  Unless you read The New
York Times and The Wall Street Journal at the age of eight,
you doubtless encountered Dick Tracy and, going back far
enough, The Captain and the Kids.  When I was a little one
back in the Jurassic Age, the comics of choice were
Superman, Superboy, Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel, Wonder
Woman, Plastic Man and Mad.  More recently the likes of X-
Men appeal to the hip kids in high school.  Now that we grant
the universal appeal of the genre, we can imagine that Kinka
Usher, who directed "Mystery Men" and Neil Cuthbert who
wrote the script (based on the Dark Horse Comic Book Series
of Bob Burden) are aficionados of these picture magazines. 
"Mystery Men" is both a parody and a veneration of these
little novels.  Unlike some of the humorless books
themselves, this house of Usher is loaded with some witty
lines, 
puns and visual gags, and since the violence is of the
Daffy-Duck
cartoonish kinds, parents should not fear to take their little
ones to the PG-13 show.  </P>
<P>   Despite the presence of strong actors known to just about
every moviegoer, the picture is way overlong for what is
essentially a one-joke property.  The story is of the typical
hero-villain sort with mostly inept champions chasing after a
particularly professional and off-the-wall criminal who seeks
to destroy the city he lives in for the pure fun of doing so.</P>
<P>   As Captain Amazing, Greg Kinnear plays a dashing Rudy
Giuliani type who has rid his town, Champion City, of crime, a
man who in his daily life is a bespectacled multimillionaire
named Lance (after Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne).  Sickened
after losing the sponsorship of Pepsi Cola (he wears a
uniform filled with buttons of various products whose
corporate officers pay him), he is determined to allow at least
one bad guy to terrorize the metropolis once again.  After all,
where would the police--or superheroes--be if they wiped out
crime and thereby put themselves out of jobs?  He makes
sure that his old nemesis, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey
Rush) is paroled knowing that the madman will assemble a
gang of terrorists and create havoc anew, thereby giving
himself and a few wannabees something to do.  </P>
<P>   The alleged fun comes from the second-tier superheroes,
all good people but each almost thoroughly inept.  They
include the effete Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who lives with his
mother and is expert at flinging forks and spoons at the
sources of evil; Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller, who depends on his
perpetual rage to drum up the strength to fight); The Shoveler
(William H. Macy, who looks like a coal miner and wears his
shovel proudly across his back as an icon of weaponry); The
Spleen (Paul Reubens, who depends on his lactose
intolerance to knock out his opponents); and The Bowler
(Janeane Garofalo--whose weapon is a bowling with the skull
of her father inside, giving the sphere a life of its own).  </P>
<P>   Despite the attendance of sharp lines like The Bowler's "I
would like to dedicate my victory to supporters of local music
and those who seek out independent films," the movie--which
goes on endlessly reinventing the wheel in a progression of
silly, unfunny episodes of gauche good guys battling a
menacing mental case--is an unholy muddle of the usual
special effects.  These performers have been seen in far
better roles. Bill Macy was superb on stage in "Oleanna," Ben
Stiller was super in indies like "Reality Bites," and Geoffrey
Rush totally outta sight as a genuinely villainous conspirator
in his "Elizabeth" role and a genuinely insane pianist in
"Shine."  One can hope only that the young people in the
audience will become involved in the work of these sharp
performers and take in some of the real pictures for which
they will inevitably be called upon.</P>
