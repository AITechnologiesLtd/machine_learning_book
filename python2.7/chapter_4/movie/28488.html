<P>   "Go for it," and "Be all you can be" are the
signature slogans of the free-spirited,
capitalistic, ambitious folks; but don't dismiss
as party-poopers the guys who say "Don't
give up your day job."  In "Jackpot," a fellow
who never really had much of a day job
(unless you count selling some overpriced
gallon jugs of carpet cleaner) decides to hit
the road in pursuit of the American Dream. 
Since Mark Polish, who wrote the screenplay
and Michael Polish who directed the film have
more in common with playwrights like Edward
Albee and Arthur Miller than with the go-getters who appear on
early-morning TV, they take a decidedly pessimistic view of a
scheme by one Sunny Holiday (Jon Gries) while at the same
time providing us in the audience with a sympathetic view of a
man who even believes he has a good chance to hit the numbers
in the lottery.</P>
<P>   Starting out from somewhere in the central
or western reaches of the U.S., Sunny plans to hit roadside
karaoke bars, enter the
competitions, and win the hundred bucks or
so in each case by swaying the judges with
his personality, his country-western looks,
his day beard and ten-gallon at, and a voice that falls short of
matching eorge Jones's.  As he delivers his semi-mellifluous
pitches to the pre-recorded sounds of some of the well-known
country-and-western ballads, he learns something about himself
while city-slickers in the audience get to eavesdrop on the
karaoke circuit with which they may be only marginally familiar.
Making plans with his buddy and manager, Lester Irving (Garrett
Morris), Sunny--who despite his name is not too
bright--abandons his ticked-off wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and his
one-year old daughter for a nine-months' tour that doesn't get
him where he wants to go but allows him to meet and have a
roll-in-the-hay or two with some of the blondes who regularly
patronize or work the circuit of song.</P>
<P>   Jackpot, Nevada--which is the ultimate destination of Sunny
and Les--is apparently not just the Nashville of the karaoke beat
but the obvious, metaphoric (and ironic) goal of pursuers of the
American Dream.  A road-and-buddy movie, the Polish brothers'
feature is a road-and-buddy movie, deliberately paced (in other
words, not the kind of tale that's likely to be mistaken for Rob
Cohen's "The Fast and the Furious."  By holding to a lingering 
gait, the Polish brothers get a chance to show what really counts
in this sort of story--the details: the nervous tics by Sunny's
brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) whose confidence in the singer
never palls; the assortment of gestures by Sunny's manager Les,
who alternately chews him out and regularly puts their heads
together in prayer before each performance; the small, flashing
eyes of Bobbi, who is positively appalled by her man's desertion
and stunned by the one-dollar lottery ticket he mails to her
religiously every month as child support--sincerely believing he
has a chance to hit the jackpot.</P>
<P>   The meandering story is an acquired taste
but a welcome antidote to the Michael Bay-
Jerry Bruckheimer noisemakers, the
explosions taking place not on the island of Oahu but solely
within Sunny and Les's heads.  We sit and wonder what it
would take to get some sense into Mr. Holiday's head, something
to counterbalance the outpouring of optimism that has made
America the country that it is while at the same destroying many
a person's soul.</P>
<P>   Whether or not you'll dig the story, the movie is an important
technical breakthrough as photographer M. David Mullen makes
first use of a digital video format that shoots 24
frames per second to give the picture at least the clarity of
high-definition TV.  You could easily tell the difference between
the look provided by the new technology and, say, the
cinema-verite appearance of Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason
Leigh's digital video recording of "The Anniversary Party."  In fact
we hear that George Lucas is currently shooting the second
installment of "Star Wars" with this camera.  </P>
<P>   "Jackpot" has all the quirkiness of the Polish brothers' debut
film, "Twin Falls Idaho," which featured Jon Gries and Garret
Morris as well, a poignant and oddball tale about a pair of
Siamese twins, one of whom falls in love with a hooker.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 96 minutes.
