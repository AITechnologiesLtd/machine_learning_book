<P>        When I first heard about Clay Pigeons, I wasn't looking
forward to it.  When the movie began, I was certain that I wouldn't
like it.  I changed my mind.</P>
<P>        The first scene has Clay and his buddy out in the middle of
the desert, drinking beer, shooting at the empty bottles, and using
every four-letter word that they can think of.  Next, there's a
violent, fatal shooting, followed quickly by a very erotic sex scene.
This is all in the first 10 minutes.  But there is actually a plot to
this movie and it's very involved.</P>
<P>        It unsure who is the real star of this movie.  All of the cast
turn in excellent performances.  Vince Vaughn is such a character that
he's hard to describe, much less to understand.  You really start
to feel for Joaquin Phoenix as Clay.  He finds himself so completely
wrapped in the web of circumstances begun by his shooting buddy.  Now
Clay isn't completely innocent.  After all, he did sleep with his
buddy's wife, but who didn't.  Does Clay really deserve all that
happens to him?</P>
<P>        The two females in the cast are totally different.  Georgina
Cates plays the nymphomaniac to perfection.  Janeane Garofalo plays
another female Federal agent.  She was more believable than others
have been.</P>
<P>        It's a movie that will stay with you for a while.  It
definitely deserves its R rating, but it deserves an A for screenplay.
Adding everything together, I give it a B-.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
