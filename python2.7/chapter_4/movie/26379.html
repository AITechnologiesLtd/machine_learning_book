<P>The tagline for this film is: "Some houses are just born bad". So I
didn't expect too much from this. But I had preserved a little spark
of ope as I entered the theatre. I thought: Liam Neeson, Cathrine Zeta
Jones and Jan De Bont. I thought, mabe it will be fun? And in fact the
beginning was rather intriguing. But by the end of it I thought: why
Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta Jones, Jan De Bont?. These great actors
are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any
rationality. Here is the story: In the monstrously over-decorated
mansion known as Hill House, visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor
(Liam Neeson) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the
guise of an insomnia investigation. Among them is a sophisticated
bisexual (Cathrine Zeta Jones), a cynical dope (Owen Wilson) and a
gentle and emotional lady (Lily Taylor). Actually, the doctor is
researching the "primordial fear reaction" and intends to plant
disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens. But he gets
unexpected help from the house itself.</P>
<P>It rumbles, hums and belches forth remarkable sights. Portals become
veiny stained-glass eyeballs. A fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes
like a sinister mouth. Filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains. But the computerized spooketeria rarely feels
real, placing an emotional wall between audience and screen. The
second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running
back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture. Is that
exciting or what? The worst thing about it is that it didn't have to
be bad. It's based on a great book, ``The Haunting of Hill House,'' by
Shirley Jackson. A 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and
intelligent. It played with the greatest fears of our sub
conscience. "The Blair Witch Project", that cost less than an old car,
managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses. And with
a $70 mill. budget, De Bont and screenwriter David Self make hash out
of a perfectly lovely piece of terror. De Bont has a style of
filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is, in itself,
frightening. He is the master of the extravagant special effect and
the big visual adrenaline rush. But why give him a more serious
material? In the end "Haunting" will only haunt its fledgling studio
(Dream Works SKG) and De Bont's career as a director.</P>
<P>Yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad. The effects are
truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful,
mysterious, magical and spooky. But this is where the good things
end. The music is blaring, the floors moving, the ceiling morphing and
the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this, every second,
every moment of screen time, is absolutely without life. It's nothing
more than a special effects-extravaganza; visually impressive, but
intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage. At first
you do not know what's going on. Is this part of the experiment? Are
these hallucinations? Projections of the subconscience? Paranoia? But
in the end it shows out that this is actually happening. The house is
actually possessed. It is at that point when all your hopes for a good
entertainment disappears out of the window. For ever, I sat in
anticipation for a decent climax and that's what I got? I believe
Hichock once said that "it's better to wait for a climax, than to see
one". This may be true, and it might actually work, but there is only
one problem -- Jan De Bont is not Hichock and the things that he shows
are not scary, only stupid. They are impossible to take seriously. Any
paralells that you might have heard before, linking this picture to
Kubrick's "The Shining", are absolutely baseless. "Shining" had class,
style, story, acting, but most of all talent and
originality. "Haunting" has only special effects and art direction to
boast of. And those elements alone are not enough to make it a good
film. Casting good actors for small, pale parts only makes things
worse. But I guess that no matter what I or other critics say or
write, most of you will see this film anyway, even if the tagline
would say: "Some films are just born stupid".</P>
