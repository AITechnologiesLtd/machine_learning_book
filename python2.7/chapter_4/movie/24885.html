<P>*** The following review contains some harsh language... but what did

<P>"The thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside."  
  --- Blatz Balinski (Danica Sheridan) laments the fact that her lesbian
lover, April (Kristen Holly Smith), has just received a telegram from
her ex-fiance. </P>
<PRE>Ahem… </PRE>
<P>Isle of Lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about April
Pfferpot (Smith), a resident of the small town of Bumfuck, Arkansas who
is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero Dick
Dickson (Michael Dotson).  When April gets extreme cold feet she runs
home, sticks a gun in her mouth, and pulls the trigger.  Instead of
killing herself, she is magically transported through her mirror into
the Isle of Lesbos, an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no
men are allowed (except for Lance, the homosexual toilet
cleaner/slave).  
April loves her new home and friends, but Dick and her parents are not
so ready to give her up.  Mr. and Ms. Pfferpot (director Jeff B. Harmon
and Janet Krajeski) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid
of Dr. Sigmoid Colon (also Jeff B. Harmon), who claims he can cure
homosexuality.  In actuality, Dr. Colon is homosexual as well and begins
his special "treatment" on Dick Dickson (unbeknownst to Dick).  </P>
<P>When April turns down Dick's demand for her to return to Bumfuck, he
decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the Isle of Lesbos
Rambo-style.  Instead of leveling the place he falls in love with Lance
(Alex Boling) and the two of them, along with April and her lover Blatz,
get married.  (Note to the filmmaker: Why did the character of Lance
make asides to the camera followed by silence that I'm assuming was
inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience
had subsided?)  April's parents, feeling like there is no recourse, call
in a favor to President Clinton and send a nuclear bomb (whose circuitry
inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer) their way.  The bomb
is a dud thanks to the work of the "circuitry" and they re-wire it and
send it back to Washington D.C., destroying it.  Mr. and Ms. Pfferpot
give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her
as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own. </P>
<P>I'm not sure if writer/director/co-star Jeff B. Harmon was purposely
trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his
movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs.  Either way, he
manages to present some of the most offensive material I have ever seen
in a movie.  The film opens with a preacher running a small
African-American child out of town, and then later moves on to the
hanging of a Michael Jackson impersonator by the Ku Klux Klan (during a
jaunty musical number), preceded by remarks about "gays and straights
finally being able to put their differences behind them and work
together to hate others, such as the Jews".  If Harmon was merely trying
to point out how idiotic society can be, then I apologize for being so
harsh on elements of his film, but it is presented so mean spiritedly
that I can't help but feel like he had some serious intent. </P>
<P>As for the entire central theme of the movie, I'm afraid that it's one
that I just don't get.  I tried to keep an open mind while watching it,
but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes.  It
was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them
preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by
society.  How does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty
of non-acceptance?  I'm not prone to judging anyone and I believe that
people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from
the scornful eye of society, but don't force your particular rhetoric
down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my
preferences that you wish from me.  Again, maybe I'm missing the
satirical point that Harmon is trying to make, but if so, I think it
could have been handled a little more tactfully.  </P>
<P>As far as musical comedies go, Isle of Lesbos is no Trey Parker and Matt
Stone musical, but a good portion of the songs ARE maddeningly catchy. 
Despite the disturbing visuals, "Mom and Apple Pie" stuck with me for
the rest of the day.  Speaking of disturbing visuals, "Wedding Bells
Ain't Ringing" could have been a decent song, but the accompanying
visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be
displaying.  "I'm a Lesbian" (which is touted in the press release as
being particularly popular) is also pretty good, but a good portion of
that could be due to the stellar singing voice of Ms. Smith.  It's
mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based. 
The other performers are decent, save for the Rosie O'Donnell like
performance given by Danica Sheridan.  I have no inherent problem with
her character; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be
desired.  One particular musical number, "Lesbian Rock", was one of the
lowest points I have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a
strained and lackluster vocal job by Sheridan.  </P>
<P>The film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll. 
The remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs
("Lesbian Rock" included) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes
message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a
feature length film.  Once the "Isle of Lesbos Reprise" was reached, I
felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all. 
Why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end?  </P>
<P>Isle of Lesbos is available on videocassette from
www.indie-underground.com. The transfer is pretty clean (and all the
detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent)
and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1.85:1.  In many respects,
Isle of Lesbos has incredible cult potential (like a Rocky Horror for
the new millennium).  This film is by no means my cup of tea, but I know
there are those out there who will enjoy it.  If you think it might be
for you, then by all means seek it out.  I, on the other hand, will be
cleansing my palette with a good action film like Gladiator... </P>
<P>Wait.  Aren't gladiator films considered to be... oh, never mind. </P>
