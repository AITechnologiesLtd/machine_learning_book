<P>"Talking about love is like dancing about architecture," says
one of the characters of this enjoyable romantic comedy.  This remark
captures the elusive nature of love, and is the driving force behind
this wonderful comedy/drama from writer/director Willard Carroll (the
little seen Tom's Midnight Garden, The Runestone).  In love there are
few rules, and it's probably better to trust the heart rather than the
head.</P>
<P>Playing By Heart follows several characters as they blunder
their way through life, looking for love and happiness in modern day
Los Angeles.  Some of the couples are re-exploring and testing the
boundaries of long term relationships, while others, who have been
hurt and scarred by previous unhappy experiences, are tentatively
entering new relationships.</P>
<P>Married couple Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery)
are having their differences over a past infidelity which painfully
resurfaces.  Somehow this brings them closer together and reaffirms
the love they have shared for the past forty years.  Mildred (Ellen
Burstyn) is reunited with her estranged son Mark (Jay Mohr), who is
dying of AIDS.  Theatre director Meredith (X Files' Gillian Anderson)
has been burned too often in previous relationships and is unsure of
how to handle the attention of handsome architect Trent (Jon Stewart).
Bored housewife Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) finds her affair with Roger
(ER's Anthony Edwards) is losing its attraction and decides to end it.
Compulsive liar Hugh (Dennis Quaid) does the rounds of singles bars
and night clubs, approaching numerous women with fascinating and heart
breaking stories.  Joan (Angelina Jolie, recently seen in Pushing Tin)
is attracted to the solitary and distant Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), whom
she meets in a disco while on the rebound from a previous
relationship.</P>
<P>The film's structure resembles that of maverick director
Robert Altman (Nashville, Short Cuts, etc), as the various characters
and disparate narrative threads are eventually brought together in
surprising but rewarding fashion.  Carroll's assured direction guides
the film as it weaves its way through the various strands, balancing
heartbreak and pain with joy and optimism.  Some of the story threads
work better than others, which ultimately gives the film a slightly
unbalanced feel.  The most satisfactory and involving story centres on
Joan and Keenan, and has an aching quality and an emotional honesty.
Despite some cliched treatment, the Meredith and Trent story line also
works well.</P>
<P>The writing is strong, intelligent and insightful, and Carroll
provides his players with some wonderfully witty lines.  In his most
ambitious film to date, Carroll has assembled a superb ensemble cast
to bring the characters to life.  Connery plays a role closer to his
own age for a change and gives a gruff but surprisingly touching and
comic performance.  Anderson brings touching vulnerability and pain to
her solid performance.  Jolie brings plenty of spark, spunk and sex
appeal to her flamboyant performance.</P>
<P>Most of the film takes place at night, but, as the characters
overcome their fears and reservations, Carroll moves the action into
the brightness of day, which somehow adds warmth.  Playing By Heart is
an affecting and touching evocation of the power of love, and seems
remarkably devoid of the usual cynicism.  It will make the heart thump
a bit faster, the spirits soar, and, yes, for the more romantic and
sentimental among us, the tear ducts well.</P>
