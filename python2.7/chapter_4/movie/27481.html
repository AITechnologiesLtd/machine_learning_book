<PRE>Summer School (1987) 94m.</PRE>
<P>A surprise for anyone expecting just another dumb teen sex comedy, although 
Carl Reiner's involvement as director should indicate something more than 
the usual fluff.  Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is a gym teacher forced into 
teaching remedial English for the summer with a bunch of teenagers who are 
just as unmotivated as he is.  While SUMMER SCHOOL is rooted in familiar 
genre conventions (a beach scene, a party, forgettable pop/rock music on the 
soundtrack) it noticeably steers clear of the expected plot conventions 
(e.g. the revenge-by-humiliation ritual that usually climaxes films of this 
type).  After the first few minutes it looks like the 'dumb teen sex comedy' 
genre is about to give way to the even more repellent high-school cliché of 
'unorthodox teacher inspires misfit kids to succeed'.  Without giving away 
the film's ending, which is more realistic than you'd expect, SUMMER SCHOOL 
heads into that territory but does make a few compromises.</P>
<P>SUMMER SCHOOL's script is full of clever lines and snappy dialogue, 
particularly in the exchanges between Harmon and neighboring teacher Kirstie 
Alley.  The kids are all 'character types' but they aren't the usual jerks 
we see in high school comedies, and even the standard authority-figure 
villain (Robin Thomas) isn't the stock type - for a moment you'll wonder if 
he's secretly amused at the outrageous prank the class pulls on their 
substitute teacher.  Harmon and Alley spar well together - I don't know if 
this role helped her land the part of Rebecca Howe in CHEERS (it was in the 
same year) but there's obvious similarities.  She's immensely likable, as is 
the easy-going Harmon.  The class is also likable, despite their limited 
screen time as individual characters.  Even Harmon's dog is likable!  What's 
odd about this film is that although there's no nudity, sex or drugs, there 
is some coarse language (it's all compressed into one early scene!) and gore 
(we see 'highlights' from a 16mm print of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) that 
lifts it out of any family viewing category.  There's also a pregnant 
teenager played by Shawnee Smith, a minor role which is treated in an 
unsensational manner and with a surprisingly practical resolution.  Her 
fellow students include Dean Cameron and Courtney Thorne-Smith, who had 
already struggled with high school life in the TV series FAST TIMES.  The 
happy final shot, which has a spontaneous feel to it, sums up the spirit of 
the whole movie.</P>
