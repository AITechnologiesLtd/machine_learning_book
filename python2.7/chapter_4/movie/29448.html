David Siegel. Rated R.</P>
<P>The Deep End is one of the noblest failures that I've
had the mixed pleasure of seeing this year. The
well-reviewed suspense drama has the best of
intentions but it doesn't follow through. Its slow,
somber tone works but its story is a pretentious flop.
The filmmakers were so eager to make a story about a
woman's maternal instincts taken to the nth power that
they forgot to make the circumstances surrounding the
protagonist even remotely plausible.</P>
<P>The film opens with a knock on the door, and the sight
of Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) entering what seems
to be some sort of gay club and telling a guy to stay
away from her son or else. She has reason to be
worried. Beau (Jonathan Tucker), withdrawn, reserved,
and closeted, has formed an unhealthy relationship
with much-older Darby (Josh Lucas). Darby offers to
keep away, for a healthy sum of $5,000.</P>
<P>The next morning, after a confusing and potentially
incriminating series of events, Margaret finds Darby's
body lying by her dock. She assumes, not unreasonably,
that Beau is in some way responsible, or at the very
least that he will be a potential suspect in the
impending investigation. So she does what any sensible
mother would do: load the body into the motorboat and
dump it in the middle of Lake Tahoe.</P>
<P>Wait, no, that's emphatically not what a sensible
mother would do, but I'm willing to forgive the
logical misstep because if she didn't dump the body,
there would be no movie. But then things get really
strange. Margaret is approached by Alek (Goran
Visnjic), a strange man with a video tape of Beau
having sex with Darby. He demands fifty thousand
dollars to keep the tape out of the police's grubby
little hands. She says she has no way to get the
money. He says he doesn't care.</P>
<P>What I always find strange in movies like this is why
the blackmailee never calls the blackmailer's bluff. I
recall Ron Howard's underrated Ransom, which turned
this convention on its head. If Alek and his partner
in crime hand the tape over, the whole endeavor has
been worthless and they walk away empty-handed. I've
always thought this to be an unlikely scenario under
any circumstances. If Margaret hands over the money,
she may see the tape destroyed, but who says they
don't have other copies and who says they won't come
after her again?</P>
<P>Never mind. I can forgive this as well. The Deep End
nails shut its own coffin with a ludicrous plot twist
in which Alek evidently gets cold feet and
inexplicably sympathizes with Margaret. In the climax,
the protagonist is reduced to being a helpless
bystander while two guys duke it out. You'd think
she'd be elemental in the conflict's resolution, but
the movie makes her a waif.</P>
<P>Shame, because The Deep End's mood is on target. It
has the courage to develop slowly and, right up until
the end, it's careful not to betray its character. The
flip side, of course, is that in a movie this serious
we have to buy the story and, unfortunately, I didn't.</P>
<P>Perhaps the film would have been better off had it not
tried to weave a Hitchcockian plot tapestry and simply
focused on the woman trying to dig her son out of a
hole. It's not pleasant to watch a movie that works so
hard to pull the rug out from under itself. </P>
