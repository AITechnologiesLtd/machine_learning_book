<P>     According to HITTING THE GROUND, the fundamental law of the 
universe is that entropy increases.  David P. Moore's debut feature 
takes place on a college campus where chaos, uncertainty, and racial 
tension create a turbulent climate.  It's only a matter of time before 
an event, or a series of events, ignites a conflagration.  Entropy is 
indeed a theme of HITTING THE GROUND, but Moore's message is that we 
should fight against it rather than accepting it as inevitable.</P>
<P>     By their very nature, college campuses are hotbeds of dramatic 
potential.  Some movies, like John Singleton's disappointing HIGHER 
LEARNING, squander the opportunity.  Others, like HITTING THE GROUND, 
effectively exploit it.  Moore's feature uses the campus of an 
unspecified university as a microcosm of society.  He explores issues of 
isolation, racism, and the corrupting power of the media.  There are 
times when the themes become a little too esoteric, but Moore never 
takes the easy way out.  The ending is especially well conceived and 
executed.</P>
<P>     Howard (Neal Huff) is a photographer for the local college 
newspaper.  One day, while shooting random pictures on campus, he 
photographs a girl taking a fatal leap out her dormitory window.  
Howard's film becomes a hot property, but, while everyone is concerned 
about getting the negative, no one cares about the trauma the experience 
has caused the young man.  Because he views the incident as something 
intensely personal, Howard is unwilling to give up the photographs, even 
when threatened with bodily harm.</P>
<P>     Other subplots swirl around the main one.  One involves the moral 
struggle of Howard's best friend, Malcolm, who wants to become a member 
of an exclusive black fraternity.  Should he obey the dictates of the 
organization, and not speak to anyone, or break his silence and go to 
Howard's aid?  Meanwhile, another of Howard's friends, Jillie, 
encounters heartbreak in her search for a boyfriend, and Howard's own 
romantic life takes an unexpected turn when Jillie contrives a meeting 
between him and his dream girl.</P>
<P>     As intelligently as HITTING THE GROUND deals with most of its 
issues, it occasionally flounders.  After viewing the suicide, Howard 
decides that he can no longer tolerate being inside.  Although an 
explanation for the sudden claustrophobia is offered, it's neither 
convincing nor coherent, and Howard's reluctance to enter a building 
comes across as a plot device rather than a natural psychological 
reaction to circumstances.  </P>
<P>     Moore is merciless when criticizing the popular media.  He portrays 
those who work in it as shallow, greedy, and contemptuous of others' 
intelligence.  No distinction is made between newspapers, magazines, 
television, or radio.  In Moore's view, they're equally soulless.  It 
all has to do with money and power, and there's no room for integrity, 
truth, or compassion.</P>
<P>     HITTING THE GROUND is far from perfect -- it relies too much on 
music to establish tone and convey emotion, and some of the performances 
are uneven.  Nevertheless, for a first film made on a limited budget, 
this movie is more perceptive, intelligent, and engrossing than a 
majority of what emerges from Hollywood.  </P>
