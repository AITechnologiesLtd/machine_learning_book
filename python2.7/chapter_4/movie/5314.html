<PRE>                                 JUMANJI
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        While I was watching this video, my mom walked into the 
room to get something. She looked at the screen and asked, 
"JUMANJI?" I replied, "No thanks, I just ate." I have no idea what 
that's supposed to mean, of course, but it sounded nice enough. 
And so did this movie, from the pictures and copy on the back of the 
box. But when I actually watched JUMANJI, I found out it was far 
from perfect. Jumanji is some kind of magic board game (not the 
one where you take turns stacking blocks until they fall over -- that's 
Jenga, soon to be a major motion picture) that lures children into 
rolling the dice, by which point the only way to rid yourself of the 
game's consequences is to finish.</P>
<P>        Alan digs up the game outside his dad's shoe factory and 
plays it one night his friend Sarah. It turns out when you roll the 
dice a really bad poem comes up on the board. That's torture enough, 
but after Sarah rolls, a couple hundred bats fly out. Alan rolls and 
gets sucked into the game. Sarah runs away, screaming, and spends 
the next twenty-six years of her lvince 
herself the event never happened.</P>
<P>        Then, in 1995, two kids who have just moved into the 
mansion with their Aunt Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth, who could probably 
help Sarah with the therapy) discover the magic of Jumanji. Judy 
(Kirsten Dunst) rolls and three giant mosquitoes attack them. Peter 
rolls and a bunch of computer-animated monkeys materialize to 
destroy their kitchen. The kids then find out the rule about 
having to finish the game and are therefore forced to continue 
playing.</P>
<P>        On the next roll, out comes a lion. Next comes Alan himself 
(Robin Williams), now a fully-grown savage with a long beard and a 
bushier mane than the lion. But he isn't homefree yet, he still has to 
finish the game he started back in 1969, along with psychic friend 
Sarah (Bonnie Hunt). That's when the real fun begins, as the game 
spits out an English bounty hunter, a stampede, a monsoon 
and -- worst of all -- a card reading "Go Directly to Jail; Do Not 
Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200." That Uncle Pennybags is a 
bastard, ain't he?</P>
<P>        JUMANJI is a fairly decent action film weighted down by a 
few key factors. First of all, Robin Williams shows none of his usual 
manic charisma, playing with laughable seriousness the role of 
someone trapped in a board game for over a quarter of a century. 
Second, the special effects are just so damn fake-looking. In a 
movie like this, as in JURASSIC PARK or TWISTER, the effects 
are the main draw. Computer animation hasn't been this obvious 
since that "Money For Nothing" video.</P>
<P>        Finally, the ending is a complete sell-out. They spend at least 
fifteen minutes trying to establish the happiest possible ending to the 
game, one which involves time travel and knowledge of the future. If 
the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy has taught us anything, it's that 
changing past events screws up the future, and the glaring 
obviousness of the JUMANJI ending raises hundreds more 
questions about the outcome of its characters than it answers. 
I guess it's my fault for actually _thinking_ during the movie.</P>
