<PRE>THE ICE STORM
-a review by Bill Chambers
**** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>starring Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci, Sigourney Weaver,
Tobey Maguire
written by James Schamus, based on Rick Moody's novel
directed by Ang Lee</P>
<P>Allow me, for a few sentences, to slam PLAYING GOD, the new David
Duchovny vehicle, for there is a relative purpose. Both PLAYING GOD
and THE ICE STORM begin with narration, but the only the latter gets
it right. In GOD, Duchovny blandly sets up the tale over the opening
titles in voice over, telling us that he's a doctor, that he's had his
license suspended because of a drug addiction, that he's going to the
nightclub we're craning down on to score some drugs, and that
sometimes life throws curve balls. What follows is this: a scene in
which David Duchovny buys drugs; a scene in which Duchovny is thrown a
curve ball (he performs emergency surgery in the nightclub); a scene
in which Duchovny does drugs; and a flashback in which Duchovny screws
up an operation. So, if we were going to see all of that, anyway, why
did first time hack Andy Wilson choose to have his lead spell it out
for us? The answer, dare I venture, lies within the hearts of bad
directors, who believe the audiences are as stupid as themselves.</P>
<P>THE ICE STORM, on the other, begins with young actor Tobey Maguire
sitting on an empty, stopped train reading a comic book, at which
point his voice over kicks in.  Poetically, he compares family life to
"The Fantastic Four", without giving away a single moment of what
we're about to see. So there, the most tired, lazy device in motion
pictures doesn't have to be tired and lazy; narration can tell us what
the picture's about without telegraphing the plot.</P>
<P>Many such moments in THE ICE STORM are poetic. The story takes place
in 1973, at the sunset of the sexual revolution. Kline plays the
harried husband of Allen (who is excellent as a frigid wife and mother
again, but it's time to stretch those acting muscles) and father of
two (Ricci and Maguire). While he spends his days in the bed of the
also- cheating neighbour Weaver, his children begin to adopt similar
behaviour. Ricci is a sexually adventurous fourteen-year-old who
flirts with both of Weaver's sons (Adam Hann-Bird and Elijah
Wood). His son is away at private school hatching a plan to bed the
class beauty before his studlier roommate does.</P>
<P>Their actions are motivated by more than their libido, however. There
is a shared desperation for communication and contact among them,
paralyzed by their own unhappiness in the "perfect" suburban
neighbourhood. Despite its subject matter, THE ICE STORM never lapses
into satire nor does it mock its characters, even as it gently pokes
fun at their various predicaments. Suburbia in most films, like EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS or WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, is portrayed as a white
picket fence surrounding a dozen Addams families. THE ICE STORM is
less eager to impress us with quirky kinfolk; it places the two
neighbouring families under a microscope and asks us to perform our
own examinations.</P>
<P>So subtly portrayed are these characters, so evenly directed is this
film, that I found myself appreciating the experience of watching it,
even if I wasn't bedazzled by it at the moment.  This is the kind of
film that gets under your skin; the next morning it was all I could
think about. Even the downplayed tragedy of the ending--the effects of
the titular storm-- seemed twice as powerful the next day.</P>
<P>THE ICE STORM upstages all movies about dysfunctional families because
it's unself- conscious. Witty without being jokey, sad without being
blatently tearjerking, this is the sort of film that may be so
realistic and unforgiving audiences will stay away in droves.</P>
