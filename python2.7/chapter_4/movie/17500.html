<P>Usually you can tell when you are watching a Ron Howard film, since they 
all have many things in common, including a large cast of characters put 
into a slick, smart screenplay that is enjoyable while at the same time 
always taking the "safe" route. And aside from his landmark motion 
picture from 1989, "Parenthood," Howard has never really proven to be a 
great filmmaker, but surely a good one. "Ed TV" is no exception, as it 
takes a premise that is similar to last year's more thought-provoking, 
superior Peter Weir drama, "The Truman Show" (a man who is being taped 
24 hours a day and watched by all of America), but does not come off as 
any sort of rip-off since there are a few vital differences: Ed, unlike 
Truman, knows and agrees to be taped, and its overall mood relies more 
on comedy than drama, even though there are a few subtle, poignant 
moments that surprisingly do pack a wallop.</P>
<P>Ed (Matthew McConaughey) is a 31-year-old video store clerk living in 
San Francisco who, by chance, is seen by a cable television station, 
Real TV, that is interviewing people for the arduous, but well-paying, 
job of having their lives taped around the clock. Ed's show-off older 
brother, Ray (Woody Harrelson), was actually the one auditioning, but it 
is Ed who catches the eye of program director Cynthia Topping (a 
scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres). After a brief meeting, Ed is hired, and 
his family, including his mother (Sally Kirkland) and wheelchair-bound 
stepfather (Martin Landau), are somewhat cautious but nonetheless see it 
as a way for Ed to get out of his dead-end job at the video store. The 
show starts off rockily as the first image viewers see is of Ed waking 
up and scratching his privates, but ratings start to pick up when it is 
discovered on national television that Ray is cheating on his sweety-pie 
fiancee, Shari (Jenna Elfman), and Ed's true feelings come out when he 
ends up comforting, and then ultimately kissing, her. Quickly, being on 
television constantly begins to put an inevitable strain on their very 
unprivate relationship, and Shari becomes discouraged to find that many 
viewers think Ed could do a lot better than her.</P>
<P>The entertainment value of "Ed TV" is due, in part, by its intriguing 
storyline, as well as in its voyeuristic approach to the subject matter 
of someone's life being constantly recorded (save for when they go to 
the bathroom). In its first, and arguably most successful, half, is when 
most time is given to this simple quality, as we follow Ed around in his 
everyday life, as well as in his blossoming romance with Shari. 
Hampering the second half, even though it brings up several thoughtful 
statements about the price famous people have to pay, is a distracting 
subplot that comes about in the form of bombshell model, Jill (Elizabeth 
Hurley), who has obviously been hired to spice up Ed's love life. As the 
big night that America is awaiting arrives, when Ed is supposed to sleep 
with Jill, I had a difficult time believing that the caring Ed would do 
such a thing. Although Ed learns a vital piece of information about the 
media afterwards, Hurley is wasted in a needlessly one-dimensional role, 
and a whole minor storyline that could have been completely discarded. 
Fortunately, the film's final half-hour made a comeback from the 
penultimate section, with Ed discovering some shocking news about his 
family's history while trying to rekindle the flame with Shari, who 
still loves him. </P>
<P>In his first starring role in 1996's "A Time to Kill," Matthew 
McConaughey became a full-fledged star, but since then hasn't been able 
to come back with another totally satisfying role, until now. Unlike 
some of these recent pretty-boy actors who have become stars not 
necessarily because of talent, but because of looks (ahem, Brad Pitt), 
McConaughey has the acting chops to be successful, and with "Ed TV," I 
hope he makes his breakthrogh. Appropriately toned down from her giddy 
character on ABC's "Dharma and Greg," Jenna Elfman is a fresh face whom 
has a genuine innocence about her that works well with the screen. 
Meanwhile, Sally Kirkland and Martin Landau are both effective as Ed's 
parents, Woody Harrelson is often annoying, but in a good way, as his 
brother, while Dennis Hopper, as Ed's real-life father, must have been 
hired for a day's worth of work. The standout in "Ed TV," amongst all of 
the other strong performances, however, is Ellen DeGeneres, who, to me, 
at least, finally comes into her own as an accomplished actress. Her 
character of Cynthia is more complex than it first appears, and she goes 
through several distinct character transformations, as she discovers 
what she has been doing is heartless and uncaring, with much of the 
blame going to the station's backstabbing boss (Rob Reiner). Also 
appreciated is that Cynthia is not portrayed as a one-liner comedian, 
since she is played by DeGeneres, but instead as a real person.</P>
<P>Even though I hate to compare them once again since they are only alike 
in the most basic terms, "Ed TV" lacks the overall profoundity that made 
"The Truman Show" one of the better motion pictures of last year. Coming 
away from "Ed TV," I had spent two hours with a group of people I liked, 
and had some fun with its story, but it really isn't a film that will 
strongly stick with you for a long period of time. Director Howard has 
once again created a respectable, intelligent film, but one, to be sure, 
that prospers more while in the individual moments, rather than one that 
remains deeply ingrained in your long-term memory. </P>
