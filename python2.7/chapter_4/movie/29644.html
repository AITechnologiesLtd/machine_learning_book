<P>OUR LADY OF THE ASSASSINS (La Virgen de los sicarios)<HR></P>
<P>Worldly gay writer Fernando (German Jaramillo) returns home to family
inheritance, but no family, in Medellin, Columbia.  At a male gathering
in the elegant home of an old friend, Fernando meets teenager Alexis (Anderson
Ballesteros), the sole survivor of a gang that got wiped out on the city's
streets.  While Fernando opens his heart and pours out his bitter
philosophies to the young man, Alexis opens Fernando's eyes to the unremitting
violence that's taken over the places of his youth in the Columbian
submission for Best Foreign Language film, "Our Lady of the Assassins."</P>
<P>Adapted from his 1994 novel by Fernando Vallejo and directed by Barbet
Schroeder ("Reversal of Fortune"), "Our Lady of the Assassins" is a film of
contradictions, at once poetic and tender while also brutally violent,
where a machismo culture is shown matter-of-factly through the eyes of 
homosexual characters and gang members pay homage to the Virgin Mary before 
gunning people down in the streets.</P>
<P>Fernando rails against God as he visits old cathedrals overrun with the
homeless and drug abusers.  He's irritated by the music blaring from every
taxi he enters and the nighttime drumming of a young neighbor across the
courtyard even as he indulges heavy-metal punk loving Alexis in a stereo
system (which he later hurls off his balcony).  He relishes the irony of
finding bodies on a hillside posted with the sign 'No dumping of corpses.'</P>
<P>Fernando is shocked one morning as he crosses the street and witnesses
a man killed, literally at his feet, for refusing to turn over his car keys,
an act Alexis dismisses as stupid.  He's a little less shocked when
Alexis identifies his drumming neighbor on the street and shoots him dead,
decrying the senselessness of the act while attending to the practical 
matter of not getting caught.  Soon he's so inured to the environment that
he joins Alexis in making fun of the hysteria of a pregnant woman who
witnesses a gang murder, yet he continues to fret about food vendors and
restaurateurs who split paper napkins to save money ('a fly couldn't blow
its nose in this!').</P>
<P>As Alexis begins to get visits from the aptly named Deadboy, tipping him
off as to the nature of that day's assassins, Fernando seems to alternately
accept the surreal aspect of their existence and become suicidal.  In
saving Fernando from himself, Alexis loses his precious revolver, and
Fernando, perhaps now believing Alexis is invincible, naively professes
good riddance.</P>
<P>While Fernando's stance on violence never seems to be as strongly rooted
as he initially professes it to be, stage actor Jaramillo makes us feel
his nostalgic ache for more innocent times and the pain that would make
he himself pull the trigger.  Non-actor Ballesteros is astoundingly good as 
the handsome young Alexis, whose relationship with the older man reveals the
human side of a boy forced by his environment to deny one.  Juan David
Restrepo has less opportunity to prove his acting skills as Wilmar, the
second boy Fernando loves, as his character is largely symbolic, but 
he does make one important line a climatic, jolting revelation.</P>
<P>Schroeder, who was raised in Bogota, filmed his movie guerilla-style.
Warned by police that he was a strong candidate for kidnapping, Schroeder 
moved quickly, using high definition video to move through the streets
as unobtrusively as possible.  He captures both the beauty of a classical 
old city of plazas and cathedrals and the squalor of poverty and violence 
brought by the corrupt influence of powerful drug cartels.  His evocation of 
the religious fervor that still endures is most powerfully wrought in a 
Bunuelian scene of a street kid sharing sweet buns with beggars as if he 
were dispensing communion wafers at an altar.</P>
<P>"Our Lady of the Assassins" takes us on a poetic, nightmarish journey
into a spiralling cycle of violence and death that is all the life too many
people know.</P>
