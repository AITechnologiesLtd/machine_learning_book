<PRE>Any Given Sunday

<P>On any given Sunday during football season living rooms across America are 
filled with cheering men, with their beers in hand and their eyes glued to 
a TV screen.  These men sit glued to their TV sets watching warriors.  What 
happens on the field is pure; it's the game of football.  What happens 
before, during, and after the game off field, well that's business and the 
aim of Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday is to show what this business is.</P>
<P>Any Given Sunday is an ensemble film, but the three lead roles go to Al 
Pacino, Jamie Foxx, and Cameron Diaz.  Pacino is the head coach of the 
football team.  Foxx is the puking new quarterback of the team.  And Diaz 
is the former-owner's daughter who has taken over the franchise.  The 
conflicts are a bound in this film.  Pacino's Coach D'Amato and Foxx's 
Beaman fight it out over how to play the game.  Beaman goes from third 
string quarterback all the way to first string after the aging star 
quarterback, Rooney (Dennis Quaid), is injured.  Beaman is not quite a team 
player and doesn't listen to the coach.  D'Amato and Pagniacci (Diaz) are 
at each other's throats also.  D'Amato is losing his touch with his old 
school style of coaching and Pagniacci wants more for the coach including 
more wins.</P>
<P>Any Given Sunday is more of a movie about what happens off the field than 
what happens on the field.  We can see this by the way the on field play is 
shot.  The games are shot in a MTV style, which makes each and every hit 
look like a train hitting a car.  The cuts are fast and furious and it 
makes the game look great  though even if you tried you couldn't even 
figure out what is happening on field.  Cameras are placed everywhere and 
this visceral style puts the audience right on the field with the 
players.  What is ironic is that the MTV style used for the football games 
is so well done that when Stone puts Beaman in an actual music video for 
the film it looks chintzy.</P>
<P>What happens off the field is engrossing and the film could have been cut 
maybe 15 to 20 minutes if the nicely shot but useless on field stuff was 
cut out.  We see the locker room speeches, the politics of how a team is 
made viable.  We see how players and coaches are just commodities.  The 
game as it is played professionally is pure only on the field and even at 
that it is played for the money, as we see in LL Cool J's 
character.  Endorsements are what drive the players; money from wins is 
what drives the owners.  It almost seems like there is no love for the game 
and Stone makes this quite clear.  Stone is out to make a point and the 
point is that professional football, or any professional sport, is more 
about corporate earnings than it is about the love of playing the game.</P>
<P>All the actors in the film do well, but most of the ensemble cast is not 
given much to do.  It can plainly be seen with the James Woods character 
who seems likes a fully developed character, but does not get enough time 
onscreen to develop.  Pacino spends his time chewing scenery, which is 
fine, that's his style.  Diaz is good.  But, the big surprise was Jaime 
Foxx.  He plays his role perfect.  He knows when to be cocky, he knows when 
to be repentant.  Foxx is perfect in this film.  I hope he ventures out and 
does more roles like this.  Kudos to Foxx for a perfect performance.</P>
<P>I'll admit now that I'm not a huge fan of Oliver Stone.  There is just 
something about the films that he makes that turns me off, perhaps it is 
the way he tries to shove a message down the audience's throats with each 
and every of his films.  I don't know.  But, with Any Given Sunday I was 
enthralled and entertained.  This film is highly entertaining and well 
deserves the Don't Miss endorsement.</P>
