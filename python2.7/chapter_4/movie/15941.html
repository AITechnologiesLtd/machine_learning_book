 Hollywood films are often condemned for stressing style over substance, but
that's not a charge that can be levelled at "Apt Pupil," an odd attempt at
combining a thriller about Nazism with a disturbing study of a teen gone
wrong. Director Bryan Singer's first film since his acclaimed debut "The
Usual Suspects," "Pupil" demonstrates Singer's eye for framing shots and his
skill in bringing out the best in his stars. Even so, there's something
amiss here.
 Exactly what's wrong is difficult to pinpoint. "Pupil" is crowned by a
relentlessly creepy, well-nuanced performance by Ian McKellen as Kurt
Dussander, a war criminal who eluded capture 40 years ago and is now alive
and well and living in suburbia under the name Arthur Denker. Rather than
milk Dussander for easy chills, McKellen fills out the man's psychological
profile to demonstrate how his long-dormant violent impulses slowly bubble
up to the surface after being reawakened by overly curious high school
senior Todd (Brad Renfro). For obvious reasons, Dussander is not itching to
relive his glory days and McKellen pulls off the difficult feat of actually
making viewers feel sorry for this man who sent hundreds to their deaths.
 Renfro also hits all the right notes as honor-student Todd slowly and
quietly slips into the grip of a dangerous obsession. In some ways, he's
even scarier than Dussander because his immaturity makes him less
predictable and prone to abrupt mood swings.
 The film's first hour sets up a potentially riveting look at the contrasts
and commonalities of these two men, both of whom have a penchant for fairly
twisted mind games. But since "Pupil" is based on a novella by Stephen King,
you know there's eventually going to be a whopper of a murder eventually; in
this case, the victim is an unlucky transient (played by the excellent
Canadian actor Elias Koteas from "Exotica") who calls on Dussander at the
wrong time. The rest of the movie is standard body-in-the-basement
melodrama, as a meddling guidance counselor (David Schwimmer), Todd's
blissfully ignorant parents and various investigators drift in and out of
the plot.
 "Pupil" is exceedingly well-made, beautifully photographed and sharply
edited, but it's not difficult to see why it's been sitting on the Sony
shelves for so many months (the film bears a 1997 trademark at the end). All
the artistry of Singer, Renfro, McKellen and company can't obscure the fact
that the movie never seems sure of what it's about or what it wants to say.
 Is this a cautionary tale about letting sleeping dogs lie? Is it a thriller
with a strong homoerotic bent? Is it a story that aims to contrast the
horrors of the Holocaust with the trendy anti-everything attitude found in
so many of today's kids?
 "Apt Pupil" wants to be all of these things but has no idea how to pull its
various parts together. Instead of leaving viewers shaken the movie is more
likely to leave them shaking their heads, wondering exactly what they've
been watching for the last two hours.
