<PRE>                           LIVING OUT LOUD
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Two emotionally wounded people have
          an off-kilter flirtation in a bittersweet comedy.
          Holly Hunter plays a very confused divorcee unable
          to cope with her changing world, and Danny DeVito
          is a lonely elevator operator from her building.
          The script meanders aimlessly over the short
          distance it travels but the characters are worth
          knowing.  The story was inspired by two stories by
          Anton Chekhov.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Judith Nelson (played by Holly Hunter) is a very married woman at
the beginning of LIVING OUT LOUD.  Having quit medical school and
become a nurse while her husband became a cardiologist, she has wound
her whole life around her husband like thread wound on a spool.  When
he leaves her for another woman it is like removing the spool.  What
remains is a confused and knotted jumble without purpose or
organization.  She fantasizes a variety of crazy thoughts including a
suicide that will take her ex-husband and his wife with her.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile we also follow the story of Pat Francato (Danny DeVito),
a widower with a daughter who is very sick.  He plays poker and has
gotten into trouble with loan sharks.  He is the elevator operator in
Judith's apartment building and has taken an interest in her, though he
is painfully slow in getting around to talk to her.  Pat realizes that
an attractive blond like Judith--uh, Holly Hunter is a blond in this
film--would not want a short bald man who is also in trouble.  He
starts pulling his life together.  Judith, on the other hand, is a much
weaker person and will have a much harder time getting on with her
life.  It is not a romance that has much of a chance.  Judith needs
some good advice and finds it in a blues singer at Jasper's, her
favorite nightclub.  Liz Bailey, played majestically by Queen Latifah,
is a mother figure that Judith desperately needs at this crisis in her
life.</P>
<P>     Richard LaGravenese wrote and directed LIVING OUT LOUD taking his
inspiration from two stories by Anton Chekhov, "The Kiss" and "Misery."
(The latter is available at
<A HREF="http://eldred.ne.mediaone.net/ac/misery.htm.">http://eldred.ne.mediaone.net/ac/misery.htm.</A>).  I did not realize that
as I was watching the film but it explains a lot about the style and
pace of the film.  Not much can be said to happen in the LIVING OUT
LOUD, which creates its characters, and then lets us look at them
almost affixed in one episode of their lives.  When one thinks of
Hunter one first thinks of the supremely organized women she played in
films like BROADCAST NEWS or even RAISING ARIZONA.  Here she is almost
the antithesis of that role.  She is capricious, flighty, and
internally crumbling.  Above all she is self-destructive.  It is really
Hunter's film.  We see a lot less depth in DeVito who is can almost be
summed up with the phrase "nice guy."  There is a great deal in this
film that stretches the viewer's credulity.  Liz Bailey very quickly
becomes a friend and confidant of Judith.  This seems particularly odd
since Judith seems frequently to be more a pest than an honored
customer at Jasper's.  It even seems a little strange that Pat is
interested in Judith, who is obviously trouble.</P>
<PRE>     LIVING OUT LOUD is long on character and short on plot.  I rate it
a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
