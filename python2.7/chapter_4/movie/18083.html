<P>Another entry in the ecological-rain forest sweepstakes, MEDICINE MAN is
also one of those movies that get trounced by the critics but supported by
the public. Both extremes are, well... extreme. The film is obvious and
so-so.  It is about as ambitious as a TV movie, except for its elaborate
production values and high budget. On the other hand, it is neither
pretentious nor irritating : at worst you can be bored, but without feeling
like pelting the screen with ripe tropical fruit ; at best you may get some
passing pleasure from watching it, especially at matinee prices.</P>
<P>For six years, biochemist Dr. Robert Campbell (Connery), has been living in
an Indian village of Venezuela's Amazonian rain forest. He has found a cure
for cancer -- but there are complications: a lost formula to be
reconstituted, healing flowers way up at treetop level, an Indian medicine
man upset at the competition, encroaching bulldozers that bring down the
trees, healing plants, and native culture.</P>
<P>In the movie's Stanley-Livingstone start, the pharmaceutical company
sponsoring  Dr. Campbell research dispatches Dr. Rae Crane (Bracco) to
check up on Campbell. Here come the formulas too!  Not only new, scientific
ones, but the old movie-movie Hollywood cliches,all phony : the odd
encounter, the initial antagonisms, the battle of the sexes, the taming of
the shrill, Bracco's gradual appreciation  of Connery and the  Amazonian
natives, the collaboration between the two doctors, the rise of  affection
and (need it be said?) the birth of love.</P>
<P>The script is by Tom Schulman (the writer of DEAD POETS SOCIETY) with many
rewrites by Sally Robinson and, 'tis said, an uncredited Tom Stoppard.  It
is a dumb, dull  scenario that is beyond the curative powers of script
doctors. And as it has no real shape or energy, it tries to make up for
this with bit, lots of bits: bits of likable natives; bits of Tarzan-Jane
swinging ; bits of levity (a caffeine-loaded plant gives Bracco a high);
bits of hysterics; bits of social consciousness (Stop the Bulldozers!).
Disjointed bits cannot a good mainstream movie make, but at least, they
vary, except for the many, tedious wisecracks during verbal fencing. (But
how come they missed a cheap gag about Connery's computer? It functions in
a humid, insect-ridden environment, yet nobody talks about computer bugs.)</P>
<P>It all adds up to a shaggy doctor story. That Connery is a great scientist
is guaranteed by movie road-signs: he is eccentric, white-bearded,  pony
tailed, curmudgeonly. Of course, this gruff exterior barely conceals a
huge, loving heart. An additional proof of his brilliance may be the fact
that his wife had left him --whether before the jungle stint or during it,
I forget.  ( Memo to students of sexism: In fiction, brainy, dedicated and
workaholic men often have wives who,  feeling neglected or bored, quit. But
we almost never get husbands leaving their genius spouses).</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell is so perfectly at home in the rain forest that had the movie
been made in the 1930s, it would have included the line :"He's gone
native." But this is a modern film. It avoids condescension toward the
Amazon Indians and dodges the opposite temptation of romanticizing or
mysticizing them.</P>
<P>That's OK. But the movie is also slow paced , has some pretty awful lines
of dialogue, and cannot escape the Hollywood corniness of the
white-couple-in-brown-land syndrome. Worse yet, there is no electricity
between Connery and Bracco. Connery, suffering from a recession in his
latest films (Family Business, The Russia House, Highlander 2) is still
good to watch but he seems more dutiful than convinced.</P>
<P>Bracco, who did so very well as the Mob wife in GoodFellas, is no great
shakes but still does not deserve the flailing she's getting from
reviewers. They reproach her character for her New York accent (Dr.
Campbell nicknames her "Bronx"), for abrasiveness, shrillness and griping.
Horrors ! they seem to say, that's  not what a "real" female scientist is
or ought to be! (Second Memo to students of sexism: have the critics have
ever seen a  woman scientist in the flesh or are they operating from movie
creations?)</P>
<P>To its mild credit, Medicine Man keeps the developing love affair verbal
and un-titillating.  Non-titillating too is the natural, careful dosage of
topless natives.  (The critics make cracks but note that the rating is
PG-13)</P>
<P>For the Venezuelan jungle Mexican locations were used. Some Indians were
imported from Brazil. Footage from other South American locations was
nserted. .Technically this is good, thorough and painstaking work. The
settings and their photography  are impressive .Jerry Goldsmith's score
sounds inauthentic, like a mix of Mexican and Peruvian music, but it is
pleasant.</P>
<P>Finally, a solid plus in this undistinguished but quite watchable movie is
that even though the protagonists are on the boring side, there is
something human and ordinary about them. They look their age and seem
neither glamorized nor heavily cosmeticized.</P>
