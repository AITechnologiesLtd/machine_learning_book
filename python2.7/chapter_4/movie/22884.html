<P>Eye of the Beholder
A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</P>
<PRE>Director: Stephan Elliott
Screenwriters: Marc Behm
Stars:  Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd, Patrick Bergen,  K.D. Lang, Jason
Priestley
MPAA Rating:  R
Year of Release: 2000</PRE>
<P>Apparently it's not all tuxedos and vodka martinis, shaken not stirred,
in the alleged real-world of the British intelligence. Ewan McGregor
plays `The Eye' a high-tech voyeur who is about as charismatic as a
piece of lawn furniture. But it's not about that. The Eye's job, as the
name implies, is about surveillance: A responsibility that requires him
to detach himself from the rest of the world and watch it through an
electronic eye. Yet it is this very act that has caused his greatest
grief and most regrets in life. He blames himself for the loss of his
wife and daughter. Now they appear to him in hallucinations.</P>
<P>The Eye's current assignment is to follow Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd), a
woman accused of blackmailing a British official.  But she is far more
than a simple blackmailer.  She is a crafty, seductive spider woman,
capable of killing as quickly as she can seduce.  As The Eye continues
to watch Eris, he becomes entranced by her disguises and cunning charm.
Soon he begins to feel that they are kindred spirits.</P>
<P>Director Stephan Elliott, whose directing credits include The Adventures
of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, attempts to be very artistic with
this film.  There are lots of interesting angles, lots of symbolism, and
some tricky sequences which segue from a television image of a scene
into the scene itself, but it's not enough to compensate for a script
that literally goes all over the map, slowly.  Slowly is the key to all
of this.  The film is so drawn-out that you will probably be checking
your watch.  A lot.</P>
<P>Ashley Judd turns in an average performance as the seductive mistress of
disguises but there really isn't much to the character. Yes she has a
background, yes she emotes her psychological setbacks, but there really
isn't much groundbreaking to the character or to her performance.
Likewise, Jason Priestley is just a joke – a comic relief in the middle
of a boring, go nowhere flick.  K.D. Lang comes up with an equally
uninteresting performance.  McGregor does a good job with his
obsessive-compulsive character but again, it's not anything to write
home about.</P>
<P>In fact, when the credits rolled, the entire theater replied with a
resoundingly quizzical, `Huh?'  I was left wondering just what Elliott
and screenwriter Marc Behm were attempting with this nonsensical
rambling mess.  They tried to be psychological, it came across as
confusing.  They tried to be mysterious, it came across as random.  It's
like watching a movie in a different language without subtitles.  You
can sort of figure out what is going on, but for the most part, you're
lost.</P>
<PRE>Two stars.</PRE>
