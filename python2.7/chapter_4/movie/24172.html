<P>IN SHORT: a color blind GenX dateflick</P>
<P>Tracking the life stories of two childhood neighbors as they age and
make their way towards lives as professional basketball players, Love
and Basketball is the movie producer Spike Lee wanted last year's The
Best Man to be, a flick staffed by an African-American cast whose appeal
is color blind. That may be because what little rap slang is in the
flick is easily translatable by middle aged white guys like Cranky or
because stories of true love, in which the couple to be don't
necessarily like each other for most of the story, are old hat and don't
require much to figure out way in advance. That leaves the question of
whether there is chemistry between the stars (there is) and whether the
performances are interesting enough to sustain you (they are).</P>
<P>The bigger problem with writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood's creation
is that she slaps soundtrack songs over the action (literally) every
five minutes or so. This may be a wonderful marketing tool for the
soundtrack CD, which often outsells box office tickets, but it's
irritating as hell to a grownup audience. Which would be me. At least
the [PG-13] rating means the soundtrack free of obscenity laden rap
songs. Cranky can't vouch for the CD.</P>
<P>Starting in 1981 at age eleven, we meet Quincy McCall (played as a
youngster by Glenndon Chatman), son of NBA star Zeke (Dennis Haysbert)
who is determined to follow in his dad's footsteps, with his dad's
number on his back.  The just moved in tomboy neighbor Monica Wright
(ditto Kyla Pratt) who is determined to be the first femme player in the
NBA and is already kicking out enough punk attitude fit to put any
competitor in his place. Their first game results in physical damage to
Monica. Their first relationship lasts about fifteen seconds. This
"first quarter" of the movie lays out all that follows. Jump forward to
senior year in high school, where Quincy (Omar Epps) is the hoop star
and hottest high school prospect in the country. Monica (Sanaa Latham),
still reeking of attitude and lacking in team spirit, can't get a
recruiter to look her way. The parental units on both sides (Haysbert
and Debbi Morgan; Alfre Woodard and Harry J. Lennix) both want their
kidlets to get an education; the McCalls knowing that a pro career is a
temporary fix at best, the Wrights knowing that there's no foreseeable
place for a woman in the NBA.</P>
<P>The story continues into college, where both play for USC, and beyond.
With one plot twist to keep it all interesting, you can figure out
Prince-Bythewood's story with a careful analysis of the above paragraph.
If you don't want to expend the brain power, everything to come should
ring clear as a bell about halfway through the flick.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Love and Basketball, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>A average dateflick for the teens and GenXers is what Love and
Basketball is. There's little here to interest us old farts.</P>
