                           THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Slow and bland story casts real
     brothers as character brothers in a slow, deliberately paced
     film about a piano-bar act.  Pleasant but not really
     engaging.  Rating: +1.</PRE>
<P>     I don't know--what you can say about a quart of vanilla ice cream?  THE
FABULOUS BAKER BOYS is the story of two brothers, Jack Baker (played by Jeff
Bridges) and his brother Frank (played by his brother Beau).  For 31 years
they have played piano together and by now they have become an institution
on the cocktail bar circuit.  This is a film about the highs and lows of the
cocktail piano game., where the highs don't get very high and the lows are
only a little bit bluesy, and the men are laid back as all get out.  As we
meet our intrepid heroes they are just sort of getting along but they could
be doing better.  Brother Frank decides that the group could use a female
vocalist so they audition and end up with sultry Suzie Diamond (played and
actually sung by Michelle Pfeiffer).  With Suzie's singing they start doing
okay.  They get some better bookings.  On the horizon is a little low-key
romance and a little low-key conflict.</P>
<P>     Steven Kloves, who wrote and directed, does have have considerable feel
for his characters and his occasional comedy, light like almost everything
else in this film, does work well some of the time.  A case in point is a
scene with Jack and Suzie, sharing a suite of rooms in a posh hotel,
checking out each other's toiletries.  Also neatly handled is a telethon the
brothers sign to play at Frank's insistence, only to find it is a high
school production to earn money for a gymnasium.</P>
<P>     This is a style of filmmaking we have not seen for a while, perhaps
since the Forties.  The film builds a sort of laid-back piano bar mood and
is never anxious to get anywhere.  Pfeiffer gets full marks as a steamy
torch singer, but when she is not singing she just squeaks by as acceptable.
One may speculate that the sibling rivalry of the title characters may
reflect some sibling rivalry of the actors, but it is hard to be sure.  If
the film is watchable, it is mostly for the attraction of the actors.  The
story itself is as slow and languorous as one of Ms. Pfeiffer's songs.  Rate
the film a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
