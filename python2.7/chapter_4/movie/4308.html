<PRE>                       A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE (1995)
                       A film review by Ralph Benner

<PRE>Jessica Lange: Touching Greatness</PRE>
<P>     Playing one of American theatre's greatest tragediennes--Blanche
in Tennessee Williams' A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE--actresses tend to go
full hog into actressey mode, surrendering to the techniques of breathy
vocals, flashy southern belle accent, hair and hankie fiddling, psycho
flutterings.  The mannerisms are built in, but they can overtake
performers.  As with Ann-Margret in the 1984 TV version: hers the old
community playhouse try, you keep rooting for her even though you know
the part's much too large and too grandly maddening for a pop star as
sometimes actress.  While amazingly watchable as the whoriest
version--she does a quite fine attempted seduction of the young bill
collector, delivering with slutty exactitude, "You make my mouth
water," and, "I've got to be good and keep my hands off children,"--she
can't get the flowery language to blossom; she hasn't the power or
range to bring pained dignity and restraint to the blooming insanity.
Respectable and respectful as she is, at her most dramatic she sounds
like Betty White's Ellen in "Mama's Family," only more shrill, and she
can't elicit what's mandatory--commiseration for Blanche.  The audience
has to sense that Blanche, right from the start, is walking a tightrope
between crushing realism and magic; in order for the part to get to us,
we have to feel her desperation for the latter.</P>
<P>     Jessica Lange's interpretation of Blanche in the 1995 CBS
Playhouse 90 revival starts out as a super wallow of actressey schtick:
the constant hands to the hair, chest and mouth, the twisting and
pulling of the hankies.  It's already too much and we haven't even
gotten to the showier numbers.  What saves her at the beginning is that
we can hear echoes of Vivien Leigh's incomparable vocal ability to
catch the rhytm and flourishes of Williams' floridness.  Accidental
lift as homage perhaps, but we're sure glad it's there.  Not until
roughly ninety minutes into the play does Lange finally move into
Blanche: looking like the sister Tuesday Weld never told us about,
she's sensational--and later, when thinking over the performance,
haunting--in her disquieting quiet when she tells John Goodman's Mitch
about her husband's suicide.  She gets deep into Williams
territory--his specialty of exposing torment and vulnerability through
poetic dissipation.  She manages more compassion for Blanche than
Ann-Margret, and we can feel the pain of her embarrassment in the
realization that she's got to exit passed Stanley and Mitch on her way
to the loony bin, but the tragedy gets squelched.  Part of this has to
do with the way CBS inexcusably jumped to commercial after the rape,
which lessened the impact considerably.  Part of it may be that Alec
Baldwin's Stanley is too elementarily defined--that is, his motives get
rattled off a, b, c--and therefore whatever mystery lurks within his
brutish ape is terminated.  But mostly, I think, Lange's Blanche is
demonstrative challenge as actress, and not a totally successful inward
reach for the character.  Touching greatness at the conclusion of scene
seven, and again during the final, Lange eludes triumph because she's
reliant on all the externals.</P>
<P>     Yet in spite of the quibbles, the misgivings, I can't get Lange
out of my mind.  Weeks later and her scenes unexpectedly pop into
memory.  If it hadn't been for the notes I took about Ann Margret's
Blanche, I mightn't have remembered much.  But I do recall Leigh's
performance--unforgettable in its anguish and slowly revealed
nutsiness.  The most demanding of Williams' female characters may
require that the actresses playing them also be a little gone.  It's
certainly the key to Leigh's landmark portrayal in Eliza Kazan's 1951
movie.  And Geraldine Page's SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH and SUMMER SMOKE and
Katherine Hepburn's Mrs. Venable in SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER wouldn't have
been nearly as effective without their imperial, theatrical
neuro-kinesthesia.  Lange, though, isn't the kind of actress one feels
borderline about; her healthiness--her full bodied frame, including
wide rump--and no nonsense demeanor are like ballast, keeping her
stable, especially since SWEET DREAMS, her real comingout.  She faked
it in FRANCES, a somber, cloudy hodgepodge of SNAKE PIT psychotics and
queasy, Reaganesque anti-Communist politics, but she wasn't ready for
the assumed depth: looking hardened from the insulin and shock
therapies and eventual lobotomy, she couldn't act it.  At the end, when
Frances appears on "This is Your Life" as an ad for the wonders of
hocus pocus psychiatry, she's give an odious consolation prize for all
that she suffered--an Edsel; but having to show the difference between
the fiery actress locked up against her will and the mental
somnambulist she became, Lange can't bring a convincing emptiness
because it was already there at the start.  She's much more persuasive
as Carly in Tony Richardson's BLUE SKY.</P>
<P>     A sort of trial run to Blanche--she says to a commander's spouse,
"A woman's charm is mostly illusion"--Carly is wife to lifer Tommy Lee
Jones, and the ravages of inconstancy, the relentless vagabonding from
one base sight to another throughout the years has made her not insane
but a little cracked.  Her daydreams of wanting to be another Ava
torreroing in THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA or a Marilyn wowing the guys in a
SEVEN YEAR ITCH dress are her defense mechanism against the dreariness
of military living; her bold, flirtatious dancing a plea for attention
and physical need.  She's longing for escapist fun: when the
commander's wife speaks about a base sho w she and the other wives are
putting on, Carly festively giggles, "Do you need any dancers?"
Unfortunately, the script gets soggy with social, environmental and
moral consciousness--Tommy Lee Jones suffers the after-ef fects of
post-military McCarthyism--and the movie loses some staying power.  But
Lange hangs in, valiantly giving credence to the melodrama.  And
showing that she can do edge: pitching a fit over the dump she has to
make a home, she runs to the family car, smashes into a jeep and ends
up at a PX, almost losing control as she touches and unravels bolts
of fabric.  Her despairing leads her to unintentionally victimize
Tommy, but, of course, she finally gathers her wits, and, at end,
dragging it up as Liz's Maggie from CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, she gets
her Brick back and her smile as she exits the base is as wide as the
convertible she's beaming in.  Carly's mildly dotty but not unhinged;
she's able to use her flightiness as weapon without embarrassment.</P>
<P>     Not long after making BLUE SKY, ready to tackle a real loon, Lange
opened on Broadway with STREETCAR, to a less than enthusiastic
reception.  Having seen only clips from the box, I can guess why: she
was showing the labors of effort--the tricks, tics--and hoping to catch
the essence of Blanche in the process.  However, friends who saw her
toward the end of the 160 performance run say that she seemed to get
transfixed, becoming almost motionless before them, and they felt a
foreboding about her--about Lange, not Blanche.  The thrill of watching
her, said one, was "in whether she'd lose it completely.  She wasn't
Blanche, she was possessed by Blanche."  In the April, 1995 edition of
US, Lange admitted to being swept away. "Sometimes I'd just sit on the
floor and weep.  I felt so alone, I felt so incredibly alone.  After
finishing the run of the play, I actually missed Blanche.  It was a
visceral sensation.  Oh, I miss her so much."  (Her kids would know when
she was in her Blanche mode at home, complaining that she was in the
tub again, with the lights low.)  Lange's still seized by Blanche for
the TV version.  She said, "If you want to talk about the spine of the
character, of course, I think it's really about aloneness.  Wanting to
be able to stop all of this finally.  To find a place to fit in.
Blanche says, 'I want to rest.' I always think that's the key...She can
never rest.  Physically or emotionally, mentally, spiritually."  And
that's central to Lange's portrayal--she never stops.  And it is her
exhaustion, on top of Blanche's and ours, that makes us give in the
inevitable conclusion--that the only way for this Blanche to find rest
is to be put to rest.  It's likely that the drainage is what keeps us
from responding less to Lange than we do with Leigh--that is, the
cumulative effect is in effect a wipeout; we're so tired by the
transfixion that we're relieved to see Lange's Blanche fyked off.
Leigh's Blanche achieves something pitifully supernal: we know she
needs the rest cure, but her "aloneness," that which makes her so
different from her sister Stella, from everyone, is what will never
give her peace, because she is not of this realm.  But Leigh's private
agonies joined with Williams' semi-self portrait (he saw himself more
as Blanche than any other character he wrote) as if an ethereal fusion
of souls.  We're watching the real thing --a real disintegration.</P>
<P>     Lange's no stranger to Williams.  She played Maggie to Tommy Lee
Jones' Brick in a 1984 TV version that was very faithful to the
original play--text-wise.  But when things go wrong in bringing
Williams back as reverent stage or film revivals, they can go terribly
wrong.  Treating his text as sacred, playing without cuts, the
50s-style word heaps sound arched, faked, and--because so many of the
actors in the revivals lack tonal poetry--induce sleepiness.  As
Maggie, Lange is so bad she's beyond laughter; one minute she's Tuesday
Weld, the next Geraldine Page, minutes later she's Page doing Weld, and
then vice versa.  She causes self-willed atrophy; we lapse into
vegetation, trying not to listen to all the blabber. (This happened to
Natalie Wood as well, playing Maggie to husband Robert Wagner's Brick.)
With his pocked, savaged face, Jones might look like a candidate for
homo hanky hanky with Skipper--something we reject in Paul Newman, and
ridicule in Wagner--but he exposes more than the others how
under-developed Brick as character is. (It is irony that it took a
strong, solid male presence like Newman to bring weak, booze-soaked
Brick to movie life; and it's certainly Williams good luck that mostly
good to great actors on stage and in the movies played his lead male
characters, almost all of them weaklings.)</P>
<P>     But Blanche, like Martha in Albee's WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA
WOOLF? and Mary in O'Neill's LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, is a test
of an actress's mettle.  It takes courage to be play a role that strips
you of the protections of vanity, especially when vanity is all the
character has before being raped of it.  While many of Williams' women
border on the seriocomic, deifying as well as mocking matriarchalism
and femininity, endlessly searching for magic but for the most part
trapped by male-dominated reality, Blanche is finally destroyed by the
realism of an act she may have envisioned as a delusional
seduction--that Stanley would succumb to her charms.  It's true that
Williams wrote himself into Blanche, admitting that "we're both
hysterics ... lascivious, demonic," and that both were raped ("I had a
very attractive ass," he told Playboy, "people kept wanting to f...
me.").  It's also true that Blanche's instability comes out of his
sister's tragic mental history--she was lobotomized, a fate that may
befall Blanche.  And during the writing of STREETCAR, originally
entitled THE POKER NIGHT, Williams was involved with a male lover who
became the basis for Stanley.  (A Stanley-like scene: this lover would
one day rage at Williams and throw his typewriter out a hotel window.)
Though Williams wouldn't come to realize it until years later,
Blanche's end was premonition: sloshed and incapacitated on booze and
pills, embittered by an unfeeling, foolish press and unappreciating
Broadway, Williams would for a time be institutionalized against his
will.  So watching Lange (and Ann-Margret) get carted off has an
unintended, heartbreaking resonance for us now--a reminder of an
author's demise, one he never deserved: that even after A STREETCAR
NAMED DESIRE, A CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, after so many other hours of
transport, he was considered only as good as his last hit. (Is Gabriel
Garcia Marquez less of a master craftsman because he can't top ONE
HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE?)  While director Glenn Jordan could have
achieved for Lange a larger degree of greatness had he not permitted
the excesses of her affectations, providing instead a stronger
confidence within herself, what may matter more is that Lange's Blanche
reminds us and reinforces what Williams is often forgotten as--the
female soul of American theatre.</P>
