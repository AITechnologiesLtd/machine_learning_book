<P>Allow me to begin this review by apologizing. If this critique seems to be
below par in terms of quality, it is because I am confident that I am now a
great deal dumber having seen Ready to Rumble. Perhaps this is the film's
intent, to reduce educated persons to a level of idiocy, thus creating an
even playing field for those hardcore wrestling fans who will see the movie
because they have confidence that their sport is as real as any. Or perhaps,
in the more likely scenario, the film has no real intent whatsoever other
than to spew juvenile sight gags and jokes derived in the 4th grade boy's
bathroom through a vehicle as troubled as the leaky septic truck that the
production's protagonists drive.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I should let you know that this critique will contain no
intellectual interpretation whatsoever as the film has no such depth to
interpret. I dare even suggests that the filmmakers' concept of `highbrow'
is probably someone whose face expands while on an acid trip. At one point
one of the main characters ponders `if you only have one nut left, is it
still your left nut?' That is just about as deep as things get.</P>
<P>The film's heroes are Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott
Caan), two twenty-something wrestling fans obsessed with Jimmy `The King'
King (Oliver Platt). To give you an idea of just how annoying this duo can
be, if I were given a choice between spending an afternoon with them or
watching a Sylvester Stallone marathon, I would grab some popcorn and make
myself comfy.</P>
<P>The duo soon see their champion go down in the ring and set out on a mission
to rescue him and return him to his previous glory. But there are a few
problems: The king's castle is a stolen trailer, he owes child support, his
wife has a certain disease which I am too much of a gentleman to discuss in
this review and his thirst isn't for victory but rather beer.</P>
<P>The film's morals are about as wholesome as those belonging to Charles
Manson, the serial killer who is the punch line of the movie's only funny
joke. The continuous preaching of violence as not only a means to an end but
a positive trait as well is simply inexcusable. This is especially
distressing given that the production targets a young and very
impressionable teenage audience with several cameos by professional
wrestlers and a PG-13 rating.</P>
<P>When in doubt about something, the movie's main characters ask themselves a
simple question: `What would King do?' (Not to be mistaken with the much
funnier question asked of Brian Boitano in South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut.) So what would the idiotic King do? Hmmm. . .have the brains to see a
different movie.</P>
