<P>     Watch an old episode of THE PHIL SILVERS SHOW, and you'll recognize 
just how bad this new version of SGT. BILKO is.  But, regardless of 
whether you're a fan of the 1950s series or not, it's doubtful you'll 
get more than a few halfhearted chuckles out of this lifeless retread.  
As envisioned for the nineties by writer Andy Breckman and director 
Jonathan Lynn (MY COUSIN VINNY), this SGT. BILKO should be court-
martialed.</P>
<P>     For some reason, Steve Martin, the comic force behind such 
delightful films as LA STORY and ROXANNE, has descended into an abyss of 
unfunny, unoriginal, and unappetizing motion pictures.  His latest 
releases -- A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE, MIXED NUTS, FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART 
2, and SGT. BILKO -- have varied in quality from mediocre to downright 
awful.  It's been a long time since Martin has done something worth 
watching, and, with every outing like this, it makes me wonder whether 
he's lost the flair he once possessed.</P>
<P>     Even though Colonel Hall (Dan Aykroyd) is the commanding officer of 
Fort Baxter, the place is really run by Sgt. Bilko (Martin).  If there's 
a scam afoot, Bilko's inevitably behind it, whether it involves a poker 
game, an illegal lottery, or an attempt to worm a free trip to Vegas out 
of the army.  But Bilko's comfortable position is jeopardized by the 
arrival of Major Thorn (Phil Hartman), who has come to evaluate Fort 
Baxter's prize technological development:  the $70 million hover tank.  
When the weapon fails miserably in a public demonstration, Thorn has an 
excuse to close down the base as well as stick it to his old nemesis, 
Bilko, whose actions once got him posted to Greenland.</P>
<P>     Martin's Bilko can boast some of the mannerisms of the Silvers 
version, but that's about all the two incarnations have in common.  
Silvers was funny; Martin isn't.  Silvers drew viewers back week after 
week; Martin is likely to make anyone in the audience wish they had 
stayed home to watch a rerun on Nickelodeon.  Actually, Martin probably 
isn't a bad choice for Bilko; it's just that the comic doesn't invest 
much genuine energy into his portrayal.  Whatever happened to SATURDAY 
NIGHT LIVE's "Wild and Crazy Guy"?</P>
<P>     Of course, it's unfair to put all the blame for this failure on 
Martin's shoulders.  The screenplay is an absolute embarrassment.  Any 
of the worst original TV scripts contained more innovation and humor 
than this ninety-minute mixture of bad jokes and regurgitated formulas.  
The most clever bit in the whole movie comes as part of the end credits, 
when this message appears:  "The filmmakers gratefully acknowledge the 
total lack of cooperation from the United States Army."  That's as good 
as it gets.</P>
<P>     This movie could be viewed as something of a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 
alumni show, with Martin, Dan Aykroyd, and Phil Hartman topping the 
bill.  Both Aykroyd and Hartman play straight men to Martin's clown, 
and, as a result, all three are wasted.  </P>
<P>     Recent movie revivals have done great injustices to old TV shows.  
We've had DRAGNET, THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, THE FLINTSTONES, and now 
SGT. BILKO.  The unfortunate thing is that these are just the tip of the 
iceberg; many more are envisioned, starting with MCHALE'S NAVY and I 
DREAM OF JEANNIE.  If SGT. BILKO is any indication of their quality, we 
might as well stay home and vegetate in front of the television set.  
The experience will be far less disheartening than seeing Hollywood 
trash yet another fond memory like it has done here.</P>
