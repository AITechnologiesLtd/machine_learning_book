<P>   Being an only child has its advantages, I suppose.  Horseback
riding lessons, dance lessons, and the like, but oh, what a
sibling-less person misses!  If a guy has a sister or a girl has a
brother or even if you have a sib of the same gender, you get to
be a mentor or a mentee, usually the older counseling the
younger about the ways of dating, mating and the like. 
Sometimes the younger person gets to instruct the older, more
experienced one, at least according to Catherine Breillat in her striking
film "Fat Girl," which is seen from the point of view of a 12-year-
old, the title figure, who is clearly less experienced than her 15-
year-old sister but who somehow, simply by observing quietly gets
to know the ropes vicariously and to use her knowledge to counsel
the more attractive companion and family member.</P>
<P>   "Fat Girl," selected for viewing at this year's New York Film
Festival, is by the writer-director whose "Romance" two years ago
stirred up as much discussion as "Mulholland Drive" has been
doing nowadays, though for different reasons.  "Romance," about
a woman who is rejected by her lover and goes on a sexual odyssey is
sexually explicit, but because writer-director Catherine Breillat
went over the line with pornographic techniques into the field of
gynecology rather than eroticism, the film was not really titillating.
With  "Fat Girl," on the other hand, Breillet wisely steers clears of
the Debbie-Does-Dallas school of filmmaking--though full frontal
nudity is no problem for her or her performers--but she uses the
sexual scenes to show us their effect on the 12-year-old Anais
(Anais Reboux).  Anais is a cute enough pre-adolescent who has
a weight problem, who overstuffs on French cuisine for the usual
psychological reason of building up a layer of armor between her
and the world.  Anais has a love-hate relationship with her
attractive sister, Elena (Roxane Mesquida), hugging and giggling
with her one moment, then switching as would an infant into a
dissing contest usually initiated by Elena, who is fond of calling
Anais a bitch.  The two girls share a love-hate relationship with
their parents, played by Arsinee Khanjian and Romain Goupil,
whose link with their daughters varies from detached to
harshly critical.</P>
<P>   The story takes place during a summer vacation in modern
times, though the clothing is as retro as the mood.  Anais watches
every move of her sister Elena like a Greek chorus, detached, yet
critical, now advising, now consoling, sometimes hostile.  When
she is off by herself swimming in the pool, she sings to herself and
in one arresting scene photographer Yorgos Arvanitis captures
her caressing the diving board, then fondling the ladder, while
challenging the ladder to show envy toward her previous
inanimate object of affection.  When Elena meets Fernando
(Libero De Rienzo), a third-year Italian law student on holiday, she
takes no more than three minutes to begin cuddling with him in
an outdoor cafe after which they proceed at night to her room
where she engages in more intimacies, albeit greatly conflicted
about losing her virginity.  What gives the nocturnal scene its heft,
so to speak, is that we witness it through the eyes of poor Anais,
who is brimming with envy and who sees through Fernando's
typically male "line" about how much he loves Elena and how he
wants to see her "in the city."  Elena and Anais have divergent
views about what sort of relationship one should have before
going all the way, a difference of philosophy that becomes a key
point in the film, given the sudden turn of events that not only jolts
the audience almost to its feet but encompasses the best payoff
scene of any movie this year.</P>
<P>   With an exceptional performance by Anais Reboux in the title
role and a moving supporting part by Roxane Mesquida as the
conflicted sister, "Fat Girl" becomes a heartfelt work about the
altogether mixed joys of adolescence, giving us insight into sibling
rivalry and what looks like an authentic look at what goes on in a
young woman's mind when she resolves to give herself to a man
for the first time.</P>
