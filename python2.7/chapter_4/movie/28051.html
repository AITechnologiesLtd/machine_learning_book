HEARTBREAKERS (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Sigourney Weaver,
Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Jason Lee, Ray Liotta, Nora Dunn and
Anne Bancroft. Written by Robert Dunn and Paul Guay & Stephen Mazur.
Directed by David Mirkin. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> Heartbreakers is one of those movies that tries to be all things to all
people and in the process disappoints.</P>
<P> On one level, Heartbreakers is a wonderful farce about a veteran con
woman who tries to seduce an older, rich man into marriage so she can
gain his fortune.</P>
<P> On another level, it's a gooey love story about a
tough-as-nails-on-the-outside-but-tenderhearted-on-the-inside younger
con woman who falls in love with a regular guy causing conflicts about
her living the grifterís life.</P>
<P> Heartbreakers stars Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt as a
mother-daughter con team. Mom woos and weds them, daughter arranges a
seduction that mom can conveniently catch so she can collect a large
divorce settlement.</P>
<P> Daughter wants to branch out on her own, but due to circumstances
beyond both womenís control they are forced to work together one last
time to try for the big score.</P>
<P> They travel to Palm Beach in order to land a sucker.</P>
<P> Mom sets her sights on William B. Tensy, a tobacco tycoon, played in
grand style by Gene Hackman.</P>
<P> Hackman, as Tensy ó a cigarette constantly dangling from his lips ó
hacks, coughs and wheezes his way through his part. He seems to be
having a ball.</P>
<P> And the scenes between him and Weaver, masquerading as a Russian
émigré, are the best in the film as she mangles her English and fakes
being charmed by this geriatric Lothario.</P>
<P> Hewittís material is weaker as she vacillates between hard-bitten
bamboozler and love-smitten ingenue. Plus, Jack (Jason Lee), the guy she
falls in love with, is bland and rather dull.</P>
<P> The possible reason for this schism is that three writers ó Robert
Dunn, Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur ó worked on this project.
Heartbreakers plays as if each ó Dunn working alone, and Guay and Mazur
teaming up ó concentrated on a specific character for director David
Mirkin who, afterward, merely melded the two disjointed scripts.</P>
<P> Heartbreakers is a weak movie, one of wasted potential. It had the
makings of a great farce, but plays as if someone chickened out and
diluted the more biting story with an overdose of sweetness.</P>
<P> As it stands, though, it is very enjoyable watching Weaver. As she has
shown in movies such as Working Girl and Galaxy Quest, she is very
comfortable at comedy. Her scenes with Hackman as well as with the other
men she ensnares ó most notably Ray Liotta ó come close to classic
screwball.</P>
<P> Only in her scenes with Hewitt, when she tries to act motherly, does
the chemistry fail.</P>
<P> Hewitt is lovely to watch, but her character is rather ill-defined. She
spends a lot of time complaining and whining, and it is difficult to
understand what Jack sees in this self-centered young woman.</P>
<P> Hackman and Weaver are worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, you
have to sit through the rest of the movie to appreciate them.</P>
