<PRE>Review: A Simple Plan</PRE>
<P>Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thorton, Bridget Fonda</P>
<PRE>Directed by Sam Raimi</PRE>
<PRE>Approx 120 min</PRE>
<P>I know what I would do with $4.4 million if I found it in a previously
undiscovered airplane crash site, especially if I were with Jacob and
Lou. (Huh?) Well, in any event, that is the situation Hank (Paxton)
finds himself in. He and his dim-witted brother Jacob (Thorton) and
tubby friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) come upon a large bag of cash inside
a plane wreck. Against his better judgement, Hank decides to go along
with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities. The
rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a
secret, and is it worth it? A Simple Wish lies along the lines of Very
Bad Things, Clay Pigeons and even Fargo, and is kind of wrapped all
into one little dark bundle. Oh, and its much better than any of
those.</P>
<P>Sam Raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey
films and made this stylish and intriguing picture. He really lets the
audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them
down our throats as many directors prefer to do. I think Raimi knew he
had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a
natural flowing course.</P>
<P>One of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in
Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line. In Malick's three hour
bore-a-thon, he makes an interesting attempt to link Mother Earth to
his war story. It seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to
a field of flowing grass, a small bird, or a flowing body of
water. Sure, there were obvious metaphorical connections, but there
was no subtlty to his efforts. Raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox
in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the
characters. I think most viewers may miss the comparison, but it is a
very intriguing ingredient in the film.</P>
<P>And then there's Billy Bob Thorton, who is proof that the independent
film industry is vital to the life blood of Hollywood. If it can
continute to produce people like Thorton, Hollywood will be ok. He
gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here. It is not
as engrossing as his Carl Childers character in Slingblade, but is is
just as complex, if not more so. Jacob is slow and simple, and yet we
so often see him deep in thought. I wondered if he was thinking about
things that he would never say (or didn't know HOW to say) or if he
was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just
said. Here he really proves his worth as one of the best character
actors in the industry.</P>
<P>Though the plot is somewhat unoriginal, it has a very appealing new
twist in its characters. Paxton gives one of the better performances
of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group (a far
cry from Chet in Wierd Science). Perhaps Bridget Fonda is miscast as
his advice-giving wife, but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the
picture. A Simple Plan can be included in the group of recent small
Hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming. But at
least this one has an important message, unlike so many of its
counterparts.</P>
