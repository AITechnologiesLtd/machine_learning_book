<P>     God bless the Coen brothers, the film critic's best friends.  While
the grinding predictability of most American films challenges a writer to
generate one more coherent thought than the film itself, Coen efforts like
MILLER'S CROSSING, BARTON FINK and FARGO burst from the screen like
doctoral theses waiting to be written, sending cinema scribes scrambling
gleefully for a thesaurus.  The bizarre supporting characters pinwheeling
through their films could be glossed as metaphorical proto-fascists or
subversions of traditional genre types; their apparently
stream-of-conscious narratives could reveal clockwork structure.  Oh, what
happy hours could be spent fine tuning analyses fit for literary journals
as we hurtled towards our deadlines.</P>
<P>     I spent most of the car ride home from THE BIG LEBOWSKI -- and a fair
chunk of time afterward -- spelunking for themes, tropes and symbols.  The
time frame of Gulf War-era 1991 was certainly meant to place the story
squarely in the twilight of the Reagan/Bush go-go 1980s.  The backbone of
the plot, meanwhile, found inveterate 40-something layabout stoner Jeff
"The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) and his blustering Vietnam-vet pal
Walter (John Goodman) mixed up in a convoluted kidnapping plot after the
Dude is mistaken for _another_ Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston), this one
a wealthy philanthropist with a debt-ridden former porno star (Tara Reid)
for a trophy wife.  Mix in the "Big" Lebowski's feminist avant-garde
artiste daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), ironic allusions to political
correctness and a few swipes at the boot-straps rhetoric of the
well-to-do, and clearly you have a satire of the ordinary Joe (or Jeff)
unwittingly fighting to make the world safe for Republicanism.  Right?</P>
<P>     It was so much fun deconstructing THE BIG LEBOWSKI after the fact
that I started trying to convince myself I had had as much fun watching
it.  The reason it's not more fun, despite a blissful singularity of
vision which always keeps you watching, is that the Coens seem to take the
same approach to making their films that we critics take to analyzing
them.  They're not stories as much as they are intellectual and aesthetic
calistheics, films which make you work hard enough that you have to
convince yourself you're getting something out of them.  Joel and Ethan's
encyclopedic knowledge of genre conventions and film expectations allow
them to understand exactly when to yank the rug, but in THE BIG LEBOWSKI
they fall into the same trap which hampered THE HUDSUCKER PROXY:  they
create so much distance from the characters that you're left with
congratulating yourself because you got the joke.</P>
<P>     If you're willing to surrender yourself to the Coens' characteristic
oddball flourishes, you certainly won't walk away from THE BIG LEBOWSKI
disgusted.  Second-tier Coen fare is still better than most of what's
out there; it's hard not to take some pleasure in a film which includes
among its antagonists a trio of marmot-wielding nihilists, or clothes a
meek bowling buddy named Donny (Steve Buscemi) in a succession of bowling
shirts bearing every possible name _but_ Donny.  Jeff Bridges also has
great fun as The Dude, trying to wrap his fried brain around "clues" as he
attempts to figure out exactly what's going on.  It's just disappointing
watching the Coens retreat into layers of irony once you've seen what
happens in a film like FARGO when they're willing to humanize their
phenomenal film-making talent.  As undeniably amusing as many of THE BIG
LEBOSWKI's oddball flourishes are, the film is almost nothing _but_ 
oddball flourishes, wandering along with a theme or two in tow.  Bad news
for those in search of accessible comedy; good news, as always, for those
who work at finding oddball flourishes and well-disguised social
commentary.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Dude drops:  6.</PRE>
