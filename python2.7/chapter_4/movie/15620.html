<PRE>Dear Reader, </PRE>
<P>Picture Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan smooching on a sunny day in a gorgeous New 
York City flower garden while "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" plays in the 
background. Imagine Jean Stapleton saying "I tried to have cybersex once, 
but I kept getting a busy signal." If the two previous sentences made 
your stomach turn, keep reading. If, on the other hand, you found the 
Hanks/Ryan image just darling and the Stapleton quip too cute for words, 
get as far away from this review as possible, because my critique of the 
insufferably cutesy-poo "You've Got Mail" will likely give you a headache.</P>
<P>"You've Got Mail" may be the ultimate chick flick. It wouldn't surprise 
me if the ushers required any males attending the film to check their 
balls at the door. During this excruciating exercise, I heard waves of 
female giggling, laughing and "Aww-ing," plus a hearty round of applause 
at the end. At no time did any man in the audience make a sound. Whether 
this was because they were stunned, sickened or sleeping I cannot say. </P>
<P>I will say this: "You've Got Mail" will delight people who use writing 
paper with bunnies on it. I guarantee that some hack critic will describe 
the film as "a delightful, frothy holiday confection." "You've Got Mail" 
is for people who embroider toaster cozies, fasten "Garfield" cartoons to 
their refrigerators with ceramic magnets that look like food, and don't 
change the channel when that insufferable Celine Dion "Titanic" song pops 
up yet again on the radio. As for the rest of us, this is the sort of 
movie that could throw even non-diabetics into sugar shock.</P>
<P>Meg Ryan twinkles non-stop as the proprietor of an unbelievably quaint 
children's bookstore in Manhattan. Neighborhood kiddies sit enraptured 
when she dresses-up as the chronically-adorable "Storybook Lady" and 
reads to them, while her band of lovable rag-tag employees exchange one-
liners straight out of "Caroline in the City." At night, after Meg's 
cuddly curmudgeon boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) goes to bed, she races to the 
computer, where she waxes rhapsodic with her anonymous online guy pal. 
During an endless stream of product placements for America Online, the 
playpen for countless Internet twerps, Meg and her secret sweetie 
exchange winsome observations about life in the Big Apple ("Don't you 
love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies"). Are 
you gagging yet?</P>
<P>Ah, but there's trouble in Pepperland. Meg's online honey-bunny is Tom 
Hanks, an executive of a evil corporation that runs a chain of soulless 
mega-bookstores. In standard movie coincidence fashion, his next Uber-
store is slated to open, you guessed it, right next to Meg's cuddly-
wuddly shop. The two continue their online flirt-a-thon, blissfully 
unaware that in real life they are bitter business enemies. Goodness 
gracious, how ironic!</P>
<P>Director Nora Ephron, who teamed with Hanks and Ryan for "Sleepless in 
Seattle," co-wrote the script for this remake of "The Shop Around the 
Corner," which doesn't contain a single sentence that any actual human 
being would ever say in a million years. The painfully mannered dialogue 
plays like the first draft of a flop Neil Simon play, made even more 
irritating by Ephron's coy direction. From the first shot of Meg Ryan, 
mugging for the camera while the soundtrack plays the kind of saccharin 
music most often heard in movies with chimps or the Olsen twins, it's 
clear that Ephron is aiming this fluff at those who consider "Touched By 
An Angel" high art.</P>
<P>It gets even worse. Hanks enjoys a VH1 moment at a colorful street fair, 
frolicking with a couple of kids. Ryan tries to psych herself up for a 
confrontation by engaging in a cute-as-a-kitten session of shadow-boxing, 
triggering fits of tittering from the women seated around me. I could go 
on, but just writing about this noxious movie is making me woozy. </P>
<P>Before anyone fires off an angry letter on their sky blue note paper with 
teddy bears on the borders, let me assure you that I am not the Grinch 
that stole Christmas. I love "It's A Wonderful Life," and the romantic 
comedy, "The Philadelphia Story," and "Local Hero," a whimsical tale 
packed with quirky characters, is one of my all-time favorite films. The 
difference between those movies and "You've Got Mail" is simple. They 
have style and class, while "You've Got Mail" is pure goo, a frilly 
Hallmark card with icing, whipped cream and a cherry on top. As soon as I 
got home from enduring this concoction, I slapped a copy of "L.A. 
Confidential" into the VCR, because exposure to a toxic offering like 
"You've Got Mail" requires a severe and immediate antidote. </P>
<PRE>Hugs, kisses and rainbows,
Ed</PRE>
<P>P.S. If you thought "You've Got Mail" was wonderful and are steaming over 
this review, let me ask you one question. If Tom really loved Meg and saw 
that his mega-store was about to drive her children's bookstore out of 
business, why didn't he simply stop carrying children's books and 
instruct his staff to direct customers to Meg's place? His business could 
easily withstand the minute drop in revenue, her business would continue 
to thrive and it would have been the decent thing to do. Think about that 
while you're rearranging the figurines on your toilet tank doily, girls. </P>
