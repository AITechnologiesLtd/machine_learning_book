<PRE>MOULIN ROUGE
Directed by Baz Luhrmann
With Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor
UA North, De Vargas     PG-13     126 min</PRE>
<P>The first ten minute of Moulin Rouge are a bit unsettling.  It's 
like arriving at a party where everyone is at least three drinks ahead 
of you.  They're all feeling giggly and hilarious and you're wondering 
what the hell you're doing there.  But as you're fumbling for your keys 
and mumbling your excuses, the spirit of the occasion starts getting to 
you.  And then, what a party! </P>
<P>Nominally the action is set in and around Paris's legendary Moulin 
Rouge at the end of the 19th century, but the real setting is in the 
romantic imagination.  Director Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, William 
Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet) and production designer Catherine Martin 
have created an opulent digital fantasy of Montmartre, and peopled it 
with a wild and crazy cast of characters. </P>
<P>The narrator is Christian (Ewan McGregor), who functions as the 
Christopher Isherwood of this cabaret, and his Sally Bowles is the 
beautiful courtesan and Moulin Rouge diva Satine (Nicole Kidman).  The 
role of Master of Ceremonies is manned by Jim Broadbent (Topsy-Turvy) as 
Zidler, the impresario with a bluster of toughness and a heart of mush.  
Christian has come to Paris to be a writer, and he soon falls in with a 
crowd of Bohemians led by that zany little painter Toulouse-Lautrec 
(John Leguizamo) who hang out at the Moulin Rouge.  Christian is swept 
up by their credo of "truth, beauty, freedom and love," (the summer of 
1899, like another season seven decades later, was apparently a "summer 
of love,") and he lets himself be drafted to write a musical 
extravaganza for Satine and the Moulin Rouge.</P>
<P>He falls for Satine, and she for him - beneath the rouge and 
provocative costumes beats an honest, loving heart - but the course of 
true love is complicated by disease (she has a nasty cough, and it 
leaves ominous spots of blood on her handkerchief) and economics (a 
musical, even in 1899, could not be mounted for a song.) </P>
<P>Enter the wicked Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), who wants to 
bankroll the show and bedroll its star.  And so it goes - dissembling 
and stolen moments, agony and ecstasy, sacrifice, villainy, and heroism, 
all building to a romantic climax.</P>
<P>But the story is only a small part of the story.  Moulin Rouge is 
about rapture, and the rapture explodes from every pore of this glossy 
reinvention of the musical.  Luhrmann has packed it with a pot-pourri of 
 20th-century hits, and from the moment Christian extemporizes Elton 
John's "Your Song" for his admiring new pals, the movie stakes out a 
roller-coaster course that invites you to hang on for a wild ride or 
bail out then and there while the getting is good.</P>
<P>The pop flows like a barrel of weasels, with songs like "Diamonds 
Are a Girl's Best Friend", "The Sound of Music", "Roxanne", "Lady 
Marmalade", "All you Need is Love", and a hilariously saturnine 
rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" sung by Broadbent.  McGregor 
strikes the right note of puppydog lovesickness and earnest pluck as 
Christian, and Kidman is irresistible in a performance that will make 
you forget all about Tom Cruise.  But the biggest star is Luhrmann, who 
stages this lollapalooza of an entertainment like a man deeply in the 
grip of hallucinogenic drugs.</P>
<P>Above, beneath, and throbbing through all the flash is the 
unabashed romanticism that is at the core of most great musicals.  It's 
driven home by the coda that reappears throughout the movie, from Nat 
"King" Cole's 1948 hit "Nature Boy":
"The greatest thing
"You'll ever learn
"Is just to love,
"And be loved
"In return."     </P>
