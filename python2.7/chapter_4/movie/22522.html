CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING (Celine et Julie vont en bateau)
(director/writer: Jacques Rivette; screenwriters: Eduardo de
Gregorio/Juliet Berto/Bulle Ogier/Dominique Labourier/Marie-France
Pisier; cinematographers:Michel Cenet/Jacques Renard; cast: Juliet Berto
(Celine), Dominque Labourier (Julie), Bulle Ogier (Camille), Barbet
Schroeder (Olivier), Marie-France Pisier (Sophie), 1974-Fr.)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A film that tries to bring back the fantasies and dreams of childhood
for two young women in their twenties. It is an incomprehensible,
enjoyable, uninhibited slapstick romp. As insignificant as the title of
the film is to the story- I am at least sure that Celine and Julie are
seen at one moment towards the end of the film going boating (at least,
I think I saw them).</P>
<P>Celine is played by Juliet Berto; she is a nightclub magician; and,
Julie, the shy librarian, is played by Dominque Labourier. This film is
very loosely based on Henry James' "A Romance Of Certain Old Clothes."</P>
<P>The plot is basically about Julie allowing Celine to share her flat, and
the two of them, acting in an impromptu manner (they wrote their own
dialogue), as we see them sharing a boyfriend and partaking in their
daily routines. But there are unusual complications to this already
complicated story; and, in the subplot, there are two actresses playing
the same part, Berto/Ogier and Dominque/Piser. The four of them each
take turns to visit every day a haunted house and watch the same events
take place. What results is an hallucinatory fable: that is funny,
scary, idiosyncratic, original, lesbian-centered, derivative of cartoons
and musicals, and truly indescribable. It is a true cinephile's delight,
and a challenge to the old linear way of looking at films. It is a film
that should be seen more than once, since it requires proper mood and
spirit to enter its delightful summertime Montmartre locale and the
visions of its meditations, and it takes some getting used to, since
this is a different type of cinema from the usual American fare.</P>
<P>This is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first
viewing it, but is for others an exhilarating work, an outstanding
example of a non-commercial film, allowed to take on the personalities
of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a
glib ending. It is deserving of its wonderful reputation among
cinephiles.</P>
<P>As my mother used to say, when she gave me something to eat as a child
that I wasn't familiar with and I made a face, try it, who knows, you
might like it.</P>
