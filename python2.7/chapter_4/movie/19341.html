<P>Most people who have attended a typical American high school will
agree that few events are as inconsequential as the student election.
The only people who really care are the ones who are running for
office, and that because they want to make themselves appear
well-rounded when applying to college. When people take the election
seriously, as in this film, the politics can be intriguing and darkly
humorous.</P>
<P>This year's student council presidential election initially appears to
be uneventful, because the only person on the ballot is Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon). Not too many people have much interest in the
election, but Tracy is not a typical student. She is highly serious,
motivated, and driven. Tracy takes everything so seriously that she
does not appear to have a clear view of reality. Everything she sees
is distorted by her overachiever's view of the world, where people are
either allies or rivals.</P>
<P>Tracy is well known and appreciated by the faculty, because she is
enthusiastic and involved. However, Tracy has an unusual relationship
with Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), the history teacher.
Underneath the surface of their unremarkable teacher/pupil
relationship, they have a source of tension. Besides simply being
annoyed by Tracy's overambitious demeanor, Jim also holds her
responsible for the breakup of a friend's marriage and the destruction
of his career. It so happens that Tracy had an affair with a teacher,
a close friend of Jim, which ultimately led to his dismissal although
the details of the case never became public. While it may initially
appear that there will be a struggle between the obsessive, ruthless
Tracy and her wiser, principled teacher, Jim is shown to be a more
ambiguous character. A glaring discrepency exists between Jim's
lectures on morals and ethics, and how he implements those principles
in his personal life.</P>
<P>The story takes an unconventional approach by making neither of the
main characters likable. Tracy is cloyingly perky, annoying in her
desire to wield power when she can, ruthless and willing to step on
others in the pursuit of her own goals. Credit must be given to the
screenplay and to Witherspoon for bringing to life such a
multi-layered character. Witherspoon deftly keeps Tracy between being
too cute, and also keeps her from becoming simply malicious. Although
Tracy might not be a likable character, she is not as disagreeable as
Jim. While Jim is initially an involved and clearly inspiring teacher,
significant flaws in his character soon emerge. Jim's desires
eventually drive him to become as ruthless and selfish as Tracy.</P>
<P>The thought that Tracy will easily get what she wants, in terms of
becoming the President of the student counsel, bothers Jim. He decides
to encourage the injured football player, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein),
to also run for president. While Paul does not have the drive and
ambition of Tracy, he is a star athlete and a popular student, so
Tracy perceives a sudden threat to her desires.</P>
<P>The story ambitiously adds another dimension when Paul's sister Tammy
(Jessica Campbell) decides to run to spite her brother for a
transgression he is clueless about. Tammy runs on the platform of
apathy, saying that if she is elected she will do nothing, and this
strikes a chord with a large part of the student body. The election
will mean nothing to most students, but it will be cut-throat for a
few involved, and will suck in Jim also.</P>
<P>The film is note worthy in the number of characters it develops and
the number of subplots it connects. However, it could have done more
with the unidimensional Paul. Also, Paul's girlfriend Lisa (Frankie
Ingrassia), is given significant screen time, but is never developed
beyond existing as a plot device. The remaining characters, however,
are all substantially examined and presented believably. The story has
one glaring weaknesses, a key development that was a conveniently
sloppy mistake, where the offending character will obviously be
caught. However, the story as a whole is original and engaging.
Because the characters are given so many directions, it is not easy to
predict which direction the story will travel. At times the plot has
suspense and intrigue, and it is consistently filled with black humor.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This is an entertaining film which strikes a
balance between comedy and drama. It strives to present complete
characters, and even succeeds in using main characters that are
identifyable, but not likable. The plot is engaging, and although it
telegraphs some key events, it still remains engrossing.</P>
