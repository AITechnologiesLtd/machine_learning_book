<P>
 Finding Forrester (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Sean Connery,
Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin and Busta Rhymes. Written by
Mike Rich. Directed by Gus Van Sant.</P>
<P> Director Gus Van Sant threads a very thin line in his newest movie,
Finding Forrester.</P>
<P> Firstly, some people may draw comparisons between this and his previous
outing, the Oscar-winning Good Will Hunting.</P>
<P> Secondly, some may accuse the director of patronization or even racism
in this well-done story of a black ghetto teen-ager, Jamal Wallace (Rob
Brown), who's undisciplined talent is given focus and purpose by a
reclusive, white writer, William Forrester (Sean Connery).</P>
<P> But these are arguments you think of days or maybe even weeks after
seeing Finding Forrester. While you watch it, though, you are caught up
in the dynamics of the relationship between this older man whoís afraid
to leave his apartment and this ambitious, but realistic youth who knows
the odds he must overcome to achieve the recognition to which his
God-given talent entitles him.</P>
<P> Finding Forrester is a belated holiday gift ó a film you can cheer and
applaud as the end credits roll.</P>
<P> The movie is like an oasis in a cinematic desert. Cinematically, 2000
was as exciting as a Floridianís dissertation about chads. Finding
Forrester is like discovering a Lena Horne is a chorus of Brittany
Spearses.</P>
<P> The movie does contain a few clichés: The preppy private school that
accepts Jamal as much for his basketball playing skills as for his
intellectual skills; the schoolís trustees who patronize Jamal and only
offer him token acceptance: the one white, rebellious female student
(Anna Paquin) who takes a romantic interest in Jamal.</P>
<P> What also is brought to mind are some movies from the late ë80s and
early ë90s, such as Cry Freedom and Mississippi Burning, which dealt
with the issues of apartheid and the civil rights movement, but from the
perspective of those films white characters.</P>
<P> Again, though, these shortcomings do not interfere with the overall
emotional impact you get from watching Finding Forrester.</P>
<P> The glue that binds this drama is the performance of Connery ó at once
arrogant, grumpy, suspicious and afraid ó and his characterís
interaction with Jamal. Connery endows Forrester with some quirky
habits: He wears his socks inside out, for example.</P>
<P> Underneath Forresterís bluster is a vulnerable, lonely man who abhors,
yet simultaneously misses, social intercourse.</P>
<P> Finding Forrester marks Brownís film debut, and itís a beaut. This
young man is intelligent, cynical and talented, aware of the
circumstances in which he lives and knowing the odds he faces to raise
his status. But Brownís Jamal shows more determination than bitterness.
He fights the odds society has stacked against him not with a sword, but
with a pen.</P>
<P> As I said, Finding Forrester has its fill of clichés and caricatures.
The most obvious is F. Murray Abraham as a snobbish literary teacher at
Jamalís private school who does not believe that this ghetto teen is a
prodigy. The mistake was making Abrahamís character a failed, frustrated
author.</P>
<P> At more than two hours, Finding Forrester does not lag. Director Van
Sant keeps the action flowing between Jamal, Forrester, their
relationship as well as glimpses of Jamalís home life and his struggles
at school.</P>
<P> Finding Forrester is a positive experience, a movie you can sit back
and enjoy. It will make you laugh, anger you at times, and may even
bring a tear to your eye. Itís a movie that may envelop you like a warm
hug.</P>
