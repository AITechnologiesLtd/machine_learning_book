<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>I don't know why, but this hasn't been an easy review to write.  Maybe part
of it is that I'm sort of divided about why I like it (and there are lots of
acceptable reasons, believe me).  The original reason it interested me is
that Kevin Spacey is the star.  I first heard of this movie (and first
watched it) the day after I saw the Usual Suspects for the first time, and
for those of you who have seen that, you know Spacey is unbelievable (and so
does the Academy, come to think of it).</P>
<P>After I started watching this, I found another good reason to like it --
Benicio Del Toro (also in Usual Suspects).  He has a really small part
(probably less than 5 minutes of screen time), but he manages to do a lot
with it, as he so often does.  Del Toro's exit is about the time the movie
begins to get extremely funny.</P>
<P>This film is billed as a comedy, and it definitely has some pretty strong
elements of the dark variety.  However, I have always been more of the mind
that the dark and non-comedic elements tend to overshadow the dark and
comedic elements.  Actually, in that way it reminds me of "In the Company of
Men" (an excellent movie, by the way).  It's undeniably funny, though it's a
somewhat guilty sort of humor.  And then, before you really notice, it's
suddenly disturbing and not-at-all funny and you realize that it hasn't
actually been funny for a while.</P>
<P>The plot, basically, is this:  Guy (Whaley) is a small-town kid who comes to
Hollywood to work for Buddy Ackerman (Spacey), a big-shot producer.  The job
turns out to be a total nightmare, as Guy has found his boss to be
demanding,
obnoxious, and utterly devoid of any respect for him or anything else.
Amidst much on-the-job yelling and ridicule, Guy's resentment grows and
grows
until he finds himself taking his boss hostage and torturing him.  This
happens in the first 5 minutes, however -- the whole movie is a flashback.</P>
<P>Not knowing how to say what I want to say about this movie has caused me to
ramble on for quite a while, so I will try to sum this up now.  The first
2/3
of this movie are incredibly funny dark comedy which I imagine Kevin Spacey
enjoyed heartily.  As is customary in such a film, there is some moderately
disturbing stuff going on, but it's all in good fun.  I'm honestly not sure
what it is about this movie that makes me like it so much, but if you like
Kevin Spacey and aren't bothered by black comedy, it's well worth your time.
I recommend it quite highly.</P>
