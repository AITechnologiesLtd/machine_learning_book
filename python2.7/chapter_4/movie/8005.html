<PRE>                                  RAIN MAN
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1988, R, 128 minutes [2 hours, 8 minutes]
[drama]
Starring: Tom Cruise (Charlie Babbit), Dustin Hoffman (Ray Babbit), written
by Ronald Bass, Barry Morrow, produced by Mark Johnson, directed by Barry
Levinson.</P>
<P>For most of us, it's difficult to imagine having any major handicaps or
mental problems. We really don't think about the people that do have those
problems because they only seem like images on TV and in movies. "Rain Man"
is a good, touching story that proves those people do exist and we learn a
lot about life from those who live simple ones.</P>
<P>Tom Cruise stars as Charlie Babbit, a cocky, greedy import car salesman. He
makes huge amounts of cash from importing the most expensive cars from around
the globe (i.e. Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc.). He also has a girlfriend and
everything is OK, even though business is looking shaky. When he hears of his
father's death we learn a more about him as he talks about the terrible
relationship he had with his father. But since he is the only surviving
relative he believes he will inherit his father's entire estate.</P>
<P>Apparently, Charlie's father left three million dollars to another
beneficiary. But Charlie is so upset and confused, he does some research and
eventually finds himself at a mental hospital in Ohio arguing with his
father's friend over the inheritance and in the process realizes he has an
older brother named Raymond (Hoffman) he never knew existed. </P>
<P>Ray is an autistic savant, he can memorize anything upon hearing or reading
it once, but is incapable of making decisions for himself and does not
understand emotions either. When Charlie demands half of the money and is
rejected, he essentially kidnaps Ray and starts a cross-country trip home.</P>
<P>There really isn't a plot after this point, it's just chemistry between
these two very different people. Cruise and Hoffman are so excellent you
totally believe everything that happens. Hoffman delivers an astonishing
performance, not only is his character touching because of his innocence, but
he is also quite funny and gives the film a lighthearted tone.</P>
<P>Charlie cannot understand Ray, and Ray certainly cannot understand Charlie.
There are many  funny scenes that deal with these problems. For example, Ray
says he can't wear Charlie's underwear because he only wears boxer shorts
bought at K-Mart at 400 Oak Street in Cincinnati. He is also obsessed with
watching television shows at the same time everyday, and if he can't see
these programs he will break routine and it will be too much for him to
comprehend. </P>
<P>Perhaps this is a theme of our lives too. We are pretty much slaves to
routine, but imagine if every minute of every day was dependant upon an exact
schedule. This seems difficult to understand, and for a "Scrooge" like
Charlie, it is totally impossible.</P>
<P>The film does have an important sub-plot to it concerning Charlie's business
dealings, although it really is not that necessary to keep the story going.
There is a long but interesting detour as Charlie exploits Ray's ability to
memorize everything as they pass through Las Vegas and "cheat" at Blackjack
and win almost $100,000. By this point the two have really gotten to know
each other  and realize their limitations. The Vegas setting also provides
for many great scenes, one involving a prostitute flirting with Ray, and
another with a slow dance between the two brothers.</P>
<P>Of course by the end of "Rain Man" Charlie is completely transformed and
wants custody of his brother. Maybe this seems a little too sweet in the big
picture, but the way the movie's nuances work so well, it doesn't make a
difference. We're just happy with what happened. </P>
