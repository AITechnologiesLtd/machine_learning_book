<PRE>E-DREAMS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>All great things come to an end, and the dot-com era embodies that
perfectly.  Beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of
a former dot-com darling, the company Kozmo.com, an online convenience
store stocked with ice cream, porn videos, and other basic necessities
of a urban dweller, all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour.</P>
<P>Designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- Joseph Parks, a 27 year old
Goldman Sachs banker, and Yong Kang - Kozmo flamed out in three short
years, raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and
from partnerships with such bigwigs as Starbucks and Amazon.com.  By
December 1999, the company boasted 4,000 employees in 11 cities, its
barking CEO Park attracting all kinds of media attention.  The company
was set for an IPO in May 2000... until April 14, 2000, the day the
stock market took its first big dive, ending the Internet era.  By April
13, 2001, Kozmo was out of money and ceased operations.</P>
<P>Unlike the earlier, similar documentary Startup.com, which chronicled
the rise and fall of another dot-com, GovWorks, e-dreams focuses both on
its original founders, especially Park, and on the common folks that ran
the day-to-day operations.  The contrast is amazing, showing how a cult
persona can convince anyone that any idea is the Next Big Thing.</P>
<P>The film's director, Wonsuk Chin (Too Tired to Die), expertly juxtaposes
upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the
bike messengers, general managers, and floor staff that kept Kozmo
humming.  The film's images give a backbone to the company and provide
an emotional edge to its ultimate demise.</P>
<P>The most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding, to a
degree, the expectations of numerous CEOs commanding these Titanic-type
businesses.  In the film's final interviews with Park, we learn what
happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls. 
In the end, the name of the game was profit, and if you couldn't make
money, even the dreamers got the axe.</P>
<P>Screened at the 24th Annual Mill Valley Film Festival.</P>
