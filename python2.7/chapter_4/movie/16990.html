<PRE>A REVIEW OF "A FEW GOOD MEN"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1992
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>

<P>(NOTE-This is the 2nd of 5 retro reviews of Jack Nicholson films
I plan to do in the next few weeks. Starting with "Chinatown"
last week, I will analyze five of Jack's very best performances.)</P>
<P>Great dialogue stays with you. Heck, if it's good enough, you can
sit around with your friends and recite half a movie. There was a
time in college that I could shout out almost every line in "A
Few Good Men". The famous courtroom climax ("YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE
TRUTH...") was only the best part of a script where if you sat
beside me, you might think the stereo surround effect of this
movie was really terrific. Of course, some people get annoyed by
such grandstanding, so I had to watch the powerful film alone.
Soon after, I stopped watching it altogether and hadn't seen it
for well over a year. That is, until a few nights ago when the
worn-out tape found its way into the VCR. And you know what--I
can STILL follow right along almost flawlessly!</P>
<P>A critical and financial success, this film hits the right
buttons. A blockbuster when it came out in '92, "A Few Good Men"
is full of people who are movie stars, not actors. Although Jack
Nicholson has won 3 Oscars and Tom Cruise should win one or two
eventually, they are movie stars first and thespians second. This
label has kept Cruise from getting the critical praise he
deserves, but it doesn't hinder him at all in finding great
projects and great castmates. By co-starring with Paul Newman,
Dustin Hoffman, and Robert Duvall before this role opposite
Nicholson (and later with Gene Hackman and Jon Voight), Cruise
showed he was worthy of working with the best. And, save for
Steven Spielberg, Cruise has been guided by most of the great
directors of the last 30 years. Holding it against him because
he's handsome is silly. He graces the scenes he's in with charm
and talent instead of barging in and dominating them.</P>
<P>Director Rob Reiner was looking for "a few good men" when he shot
this picture. He found more than a few--first selecting the right
man to play Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Cruise) in this charged-up
courtroom drama. All the aforementioned barging and dominating is
done by one of the great villains of the '90s, Colonel Nathan R.
Jessep (Nicholson in his 10th Oscar-nominated performance).
Nicholson could easily have won the Best Supporting Actor award
for turning this movie upside down and for so effectively tearing
everything apart. Let's not forget about Lt./Commander JoAnne
Galloway (played by another movie star, Demi Moore), Captain Jack
Ross (Kevin Bacon), Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack), or Lt.
Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). </P>
<P>The powerhouse cast compliments Aaron Sorkin's screenplay (based
on his own play) about two young marines based in Cuba who are
charged with the murder of one of their fellow marines. The movie
opens with the death of PFC William T. Santiago, a notorious
screw-up who accidentally dies during a hazing ritual
administered by Lnc./Cpl. Dawson and PFC Downie. We later learn
that their superior officers (Jessep and Kendrick) ordered this
"Code Red" to bring Santiago back in line after breaking the
chain of command and ratting to higher authorities on Dawson for
an illegal fenceline shooting. Santiago had been pleading for a
transfer off the base for 9 months and hoped the information he
had about the fenceline shooting could be exchanged for that
transfer. The fanatical Colonel Jessep gets hold of the letter
and lectures to his Executive Officer Lt./Colonel Markinson (J.T.
Walsh) and Kendrick that rather than pawning off their
sub-standard marine, they should "train the lad". Ironically,
they order Dawson--the very marine who could face disciplinary
action because of Santiago's tattling--to beat some sense into
him. After the boy dies, Jessep covers it up and Markinson goes
along with it despite his strenuous objections.</P>
<P>While that is essentially the plot, this film is not just about
marines or cover-ups or revenge. It's about daring to defy higher
powers (and often logic) and doing what's right by following your
conscience. That applies to Dawson and Downie (Wolfgang Bodison
and James Marshall, respectively) as well as Kaffee, their
attorney. He's the hot-shot young Navy lawyer and the best young
litigator in the JAG corps--particularly at plea-bargaining. He's
never seen the inside of a courtroom and tries to get his two
clients to accept a deal rather than risk getting put in jail for
life by facing a losing battle in a formal court martial. The
young marines refuse to plead guilty and take the deal because
they maintain they were only following orders. Galloway nags
Kaffee to stand up and defend them. He reluctantly takes the case
to court despite a complete lack of evidence in their favour
(after all, they DID kill Santiago). They step on numerous
landmines until the infamous climax between young pony Cruise and
old warhorse Nicholson where the truth is exposed in a huge
explosion of tension and drama.</P>
<P>The script takes a few liberties. Any lawyer worth his salt would
drop the case when the reluctance of his two defendants to accept
a sweet deal puts them all in such peril. By going into the
courtroom with no evidence (and with their clients having a
motive), they can only assign the blame for the death to Jessep
and Kendrick. If Kaffee falsely accuses the decorated officers
without proper evidence, he would face a career-destroying court
martial of his own. It's the superfluous sub-plot about his late
father (who was a legendary lawyer) that probably explains why he
throws caution to the wind and tries to win such an unwinnable
case by street-smarts and spin-doctoring alone. He wants to live
up to his father's legacy (and probably to stop Galloway from
pestering him!).</P>
<P>Criticisms--It's doubtful that Nicholson's remarkable thundering
during a court martial would be accepted by any judge. He doesn't
so much answer questions on the witness stand as he tells the
world how lucky it is to have such a strong man defending the
nation. Other small problems occurred with the usually top-notch
editing. During an early scene where baseball-loving Kaffee takes
batting practice, the conversation between he and Galloway is cut
in such a way that the continuity is a little off. In one shot
he's in the process of swinging the bat. Quickly cut to the other
and the bat is already on his shoulder. And to nitpick, we see
Kaffee watching a ballgame between Minnesota and Baltimore after
the case has begun. How?! The case starts on October 3rd and that
would be World Series time. Well, at least American League
Championship Series time, but those two teams didn't even meet in
the playoffs! Sorry, I'm scrutinizing, but it's a noticeable
gaffe. Also, I HATE when modern movies say "The End" when it's
over. Arggh!</P>
<P>However, everything in those last two paragraphs is a careful
criticism. This movie scores in a big way and only a long-time
fan would even care about the mistakes. Two of the finest
dialogue-driven films of the '90s (non-Tarantino works, of
course) came out in 1992 (this and "Glengarry Glen Ross") and "A
Few Good Men" stands above all. Sorkin wrote this in a way that
the court scenes were dynamic and the Kaffee/Galloway
relationship was heated yet platonic. Many of the characters
learn to respect each other, but the film doesn't manipulate a
perfect ending. It wraps up right when it should. Because of the
sharp editing--save for those small continuity errors--this is
fast-paced and completely riveting. During scenes of
conversation, it's like you're right there with the actors and
you forget that everyone's dialogue was filmed separately.</P>
<P>The screenplay has racist, sexist characters, but the movie rises
above those shady slimeballs. Both Jessep and Kendrick have
racial and sexist issues (if you listen to what they say and how
they say it, you'll understand). Still, the underdogs (the female
Galloway, the black Dawson, the Jewish Weinberg, and the kid
Kaffee) match the tough guys because the actors exude appropriate
strength and charisma. You'll get some laughs when the subject
matter eases up a little, too. The cinematography is fantastic at
times--especially during the rifle drill during the opening
credits--and the sound mix is fine. This film scored for North
Americans for many reasons--it's patriotic, dynamic, cultural,
interesting, and so well acted by its superstars.</P>
<P>In two of Nicholson's few scenes, he and Cruise are at opposite
ends of the spectrum. Cruise looks like a baby next to Jack, but
that's the point. Will we buy into Kaffee beating the proverbial
truth out of Jessep? Oh yeah, we do. This is "Star Wars" without
the lightsabers. We know exactly who the good guy is and who the
bad guy is. Cruise is confident, but he's human. We relate to the
young man and we like him. Without a doubt, Colonel Jessep is one
of the great screen villains of the '90s. Nicholson's eyes burn
with hatred and his body manner is incredibly powerful.</P>
<P>"A Few Good Men" skillfully hits the mark with a bullseye. It's
intense when it should be and funny when it should be. Finely
crafted and well-cast, it remains one of the more memorable
courtroom dramas in film history. If you ever forget why, give me
a buzz and I'd be happy to shout "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH..."
and the rest of the script in near-perfect synchronization.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Along with the superstars in "A Few Good Men",
youngsters Noah Wyle (Dr. Carter on TV's "E.R.") and Cuba Gooding
Jr. (Oscar-winner in "Jerry Maguire") also appeared.</P>
