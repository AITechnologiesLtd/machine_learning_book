<PRE>Ermo</PRE>
<P>Hong Kong, 1994; Chinese with English subtitles</P>
<PRE>Seen on video with Linda.</PRE>
<P>Ermo is the much younger wife of a former village "chief" who is trying,
in rural Chinese fashion, to keep up with the Joneses. The town is nestled
in the mountains and is accessible by a long winding mountain road. All
the houses are about ten feet apart from each other. Ermo, her husband and
son live in a comfortable house, but their neighbor--"Blindman"--is a
successful hauler and has a TV. The only TV in the village. Tiger, Ermo's
son, is constantly over there watching the tube</P>
<P>Ermo spends long days in physical labor, weaving baskets and making twisty
noodles. She then trudges into the closest larger town to sell her wares. 
She is determined and will not be bargained down her selling prices. She
endures the insults of Blindman's wife and eventually decides that she is
going to make enough money to buy the biggest TV in the county, one even
the county chief does not have. This leads her to eventually working in
the city as a noodle maker at a restaurant, and even living away from home
so she can make as much money as she can and not waste time commuting. She
even starts selling blood for money, at an alarming rate. Another evil
enters the picture as well: Blindman, who constantly complains of his
"fat, slack-assed wife" is paying Ermo a lot of mind, and making the
career suggestions that keep her from her home</P>
<P>Ermo is a tedious cross between Madame Bovary and Sunrise. It is hard to
know whether or not it is the cultural differences that make it a less
than compelling experience, or if it is in fact just slow moving and
unempathetic. The movie clearly moralizes that the best things in life are
free. That Ermo sinks to demeaning depths all for the sake of buying a
29-inch TV set really hits you over the head. </P>
<P>China is undergoing a major cultural change as free-market influences
force rural dwellers into facing the 20th Century. Ermo's husband was once
the Communist chief of the village. He keeps reminding everyone that he is
no longer the chief when he is called by that nickname. It is clear that
having what you need and living communally has been replaced by the art of
the deal and having it all. If nothing else, Ermo provides a glimpse of
what sort of mindset and circumstances a tremendous percentage of the
global population possess.  If most Chinese villages are like the one in
Ermo, you can easily understand why the news of Tianenmen Square was
easily propagandized; what you cannot see or hear, you cannot think about. </P>
<P>Ermo, like many women she probably represents, is naive and the best parts
of the movie are when she "visits" the TV she intends to buy, wondering if
the TV has forgotten Chinese when foreign language programs, and hoping it
does not "wear out" by the time she has saved up enough yuan to buy it. 
God only knows what she would do when she finds out about VCRs. </P>
<P>Was it all worth it for Ermo? In many ways, the final moments of the film
answer that question very well. </P>
