<P>   One of the strategies used today by Israelis, who have
been inundated by terrorist attacks, is to learn the location of
high-ranking officials in organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah
and Islamic Jihad, fly over their limos in choppers, and fire
missiles at the cars, eliminating the leaders (hopefully without
loss of nearby civilian life).  This is similar to what the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency did in the old days--eliminating
perceived enemies by assassinating leaders.  The CIA more
or less admitted its role in taking out Guatemalan leader
Arbenz, whom the U.S. perceived to be pro-Communist.  Is
this type of action justified?  While you're pondering the ethics
of assassinating enemies, you may wonder what all of this
has to do with Dominic Sena's explosive picture, "Swordfish,"
which features some of John Travolta's most convincing
action roles and almost redeems his guise in last year's
"Battlefield Earth."  We can't really discuss the relationship of
these metaphysical questions without giving away the store,
but despite the hackneyed car chases, chopper scenarios,
and the usual mayhem with explosives strapped to hostages,
Skip Woods's clever script lifts "Swordfish" well above the
usual action-adventure genre.  While WBAI critic Mike
Sargent rhapsodizes, "If it were any hotter you'd burst into
flames," I prefer to give appropriate accolades to the
imaginative script--which features a couple of interesting
twists ending with a slam-bang revelation that provides the
audience with an excuse to exhale "a-ha!"</P>
<P>   The story opens on the final day of a bank heist, then
retraces its steps to highlight that handsome Aussie Hugh
Jackman in the role of A-1 computer hacker Stanley, out of
jail for entering secret government files with the caveat that he
must not touch the keys to a computer again.  When the
alluring Ginger (Halle Berry) enters his disheveled trailer in
the middle of nowhere to offer a deal he cannot refuse, he
winds up in the caper of his life with debonair multi-millionaire
Gabriel Shear (John Travolta), who impresses Stanley with
his need to make much more money--which he can do if
Stanley would hack into some cool bank accounts.</P>
<P>   The extra million dollars that Warner Bros. paid to Halle
Berry simply to expose her breasts for eight seconds mocks
all the strippers throughout the United States who probably
could not make that kind of money after ten-year careers
spinning around the brass poles, but that sum  in turn fades
when compared to the nine billion dollars that Stanley is
commissioned to find for Gabriel--which could keep Stanley in
Dell computers for several lifetimes and provide Gabriel
with...what?  Ah, that's the 9-billion dollar question that
provides director Dominic Sena with a prize picture.  The
audience, given clues throughout, must wonder: is Ginger
really working for the Drug Enforcement Administration or is
she really Gabriel's numero uno?  Most of all, is Gabriel a
good guy working for the interests of the U.S. government
despite being pursued avidly by Special Agent A.D. Roberts
(Don Cheadle)?  Or is he a villain interested principally in
stashing billions into his numbered accounts around the world
so that he can sail the Mediterranean on a yacht that would
make Ari Onassis' boat pale?</P>
<P>   The babes look like Bond girls and the women in the
audience can't do better, looks-wise, than to gape at Mr.
Jackman, who resembles a young Robert Redford.  Dominic
Sena still pushes the action-ad envelope as he did with last
year's turkey, "Gone in 60 Seconds," but thanks to the
machinations of Skip Woods screenplay he's redeemed
himself along with Mr. Travolta.  The opening scene, a
philosophic chat by Travola about the nature of Hollywood, is
a monologue worthy of the arthouse stage of Manhattan's
Manhattan Theatre Club.  Good show all around.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 97 minutes.  (C)2001,
