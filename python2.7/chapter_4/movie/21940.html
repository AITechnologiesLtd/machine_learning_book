<P>The World is Not Enough Dir: Michael Apted. Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards, Robbie Coltrane and Judi Dench.</P>
<P>The pitch: James Bond races around the globe to stop a brain-damaged
terrorist from disrupting the world's oil supply.</P>
<P>Secret Agent 007, now in his 19th official outing, can still act suave,
caressing women, guns and cocktails with equal ease. But the series itself
is looking long in the tooth and short on ideas.</P>
<P>After an old friend is killed in a bombing inside MI6 headquarters, Bond
resolves to protect the man's beautiful but emotionally scarred daughter
Elektra (Marceau, who can plop her feet on our coffee table any time). The
bewitching Elektra was once kidnapped by Bosnian terrorist Carlyle, who
still carries a bullet in his head from an attempted assassination. Although
he survived the hit, the bullet has caused irreparable neurological damage.
Carlyle can no longer feel pain. Or pleasure. The injury is slowly killing
him. Too bad this idea never develops into a big payoff at the climax. Like
most of the action in this busy film, the issue of brain damage is
introduced and quickly forgotten as Carlyle obsesses on blowing up an oil
pipeline in the Caspian Sea (think fast, film fans: how many times has the
climax of a Bond movie hinged on the threat of a thermonuclear device?).</P>
<P>Bond travels by jet ski and snow ski, by boat, rocket-equipped BMW and
submarine. Curiously, though, for all his globe-trotting, we never see the
super spy climb aboard or disembark from a plane (Perhaps the ancient Q and
his new sidekick -- John Clesse, in an amusing cameo -- have developed a
secret teleportation device so Bond can get around).</P>
<P>Brosnan, reprising the role for the third time, seems to relish his
assignment. His confidence and wry manner are well-suited to the part, which
demands a seriousness that Roger Moore could never muster and a levity that
eluded Timothy Dalton in his two-picture incarnation as Bond. Brosnan has
shrugged off the Remington Steel albatross and settled for a style somewhere
between Moore and Dalton. Still, nobody kicked super-villain ass, defused
nuclear bombs, stroked babes, smoked cigarettes, sipped martinis, raced
Aston Martins, knew more about fine wine, gave Q a hard time or muttered
more amusing quips than Sean Connery, his own bad self. And if Connery
wouldn't look absurd trying to hold his toupee in place – or face serious
risk of cardiac thrombosis (he turned 69 in August) – we'd say bring him
back, put a Walther PPK in his shoulder holster and let's rock.</P>
<P>If this sounds like carping, then the gentle readers of Cinema Uprising
should know that we have seen every Bond film, most of them multiple times.
We even enjoy Casino Royale (1967), the much-maligned spoof that purists don
't count as a legitimate Bond film, although in many ways it is better than
most of the movies starring Roger Moore (as Bond, or anyone else, for that
matter). So we're predisposed toward this Bond character. We know the
formula. And Brosnan is the best actor to get behind the role since Connery
vowed `nevermore.'</P>
<P>But the goons behind the camera are so focused on pyrotechnics, good as they
are, and gee-whiz gadgets, that no one bothered with the script. We're not
talking about believable plots. Hell, if that was a prerequisite, there
wouldn't be any Bond films.</P>
<P>The problem with The World is Not Enough is the characters have nothing
intelligent to say. The new Bond girl, Christmas Jones (Richards), is a case
in point. First off, the best Bond girls have ridiculously suggestive and
sexist names like Pussy Galore (Goldfinger), or Holly Goodhead (Man with the
Golden Gun), not stupid monikers like Christmas Jones, which is just a setup
for the worst closing line in any of the Bond movies. Richards plays a
nuclear bimbo-scientist, with an emphasis on the bimbo. Talk about
unbelievable: If this doe-eyed valley girl knows anything about nuclear
physics, then we'll eat plutonium. Richards hit her stride in Wild Things
(1998), a gleefully sleazy picture that still shows up on cable TV at 2 a.m.
Such roles illustrate the breadth of her talent, which doesn't stand up to
the stress of dialogue or facial expression.</P>
<P>Bond's tricked-out BMW turns in a better performance. Worse, he shows more
emotion for the car when it is destroyed than he does for Ms. Richards – or
the remarkable Ms. Marceau – who is a wild and an untamed thing, yet sadly
impervious to Bond's particular method of rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Even the fine Shakespearean actress Judi Dench, starring here as a matronly
M, is forced to declare obvious
plot points that we can see for ourselves. The portly Coltrane fares better,
reprising his role from Goldeneye (1995) as a Russian gangster. He provides
equal parts cynicism and comic relief.</P>
<P>The World is Not Enough just isn't enough to sate the legions of Bond fans
who must wait another two years for the next installment. Our advice is to
check out the solid first hour, then bail out for a debriefing over vodka
martinis and Beluga caviar served on toast points. Thus primed, the
discriminating viewer will head for the home theater and a nostalgic,
late-night viewing of the Bond classic, From Russia with Love (1963) on
video. As the ads once exclaimed: Sean Connery is James Bond. That's good
enough for us.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13 for cartoonish violence and insipid sexual double-entendres.</P>
