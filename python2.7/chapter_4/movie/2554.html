<P>"Prisons have become big business."
      - Title card explaining imprisonment in the year 2022.</P>
<P>     Cross MAD MAX with LORD OF THE FLIES and you've got the idea behind 
NO ESCAPE, a lousy prison-in-a-jungle pic. from producer-who-knows-better 
Gale Anne Hurd (ALIENS, THE ABYSS).</P>
<P>     The story introduces Robbins (Ray Liotta), a Marine captain con-
victed of murder and sent up the river and across the ocean to an island 
penal colony with no guards and one rule: stay alive. This "resort 
community" is controlled by two warring factions: the savage Outsiders 
(led by soft-spoken Stuart Wilson) and the peaceful Insiders (led by 
softer-spoken Lance Henriksen). But Robbins, who has a genetically 
traced problem with authority, doesn't want in on either..</P>
<P>     For about thirty minutes, NO ESCAPE is the perfect tonic to a sans 
action spring. The locales are lush, the premise is punchy, and Liotta 
is the last action hero we'd expect to be engaging. The man can act 
and his early scenes with Wilson, who plays the lively leader of the 
Outsiders, have a nice, lazy charm.</P>
<P>     Watch a staged fight between Robbins and "Ralph, our director of 
athletic activities" for a friendly nod to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.</P>
<P>     Once our hero goes outside the Outsiders (and inside the Insiders), 
the plot machinery grinds to a halt and NO ESCAPE becomes just that. 
Robbins spends the rest of the film seeking salvation in a ramshackle 
village that looks a little too much like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND to be 
taken seriously.</P>
<P>     There are a couple of brief battles to break up the monotony, but 
director Martin Campbell doesn't do very well with any more than three 
people fighting at one time.  He's better than, say, Kevin Reynolds, 
but not the *best* talent to effectively tingle the testosterone.</P>
<P>     The gore is pretty good, though. Watch for a dandy beheading and a 
*great* impaling.</P>
<P>     NO ESCAPE stars no women (!) and, considering the number of men 
shown in close quarters, could use a stronger sexual subtext to be 
believable. But this is Hollywood and Gale Anne Hurd *already* has a 
pretty large set of cojones.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    NO ESCAPE is a lousy prison-in-a-jungle pic. that's
                worth watching for all of thirty minutes.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+ </PRE>
