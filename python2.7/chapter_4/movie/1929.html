<P>     Dev Raman (M. Night Shyamalan) is an American-born Indian sent to
India as part of a college student exchange program.  Dev is reluctant
to go, but his mother, to whom he is devoted, insists.  So, friendless
and alone, halfway across the world, Dev experiences culture shock--he
may look like an Indian, but it is quickly and vividly demonstrated
that looks are of little consequence, and it will take more than a glib
tongue and an unwillingness to back down to earn acceptance and
respect.  In the midst of his initial travails, Dev's sole friend is
Sunjay (Mike Muthu), his guide and mentor, upon whose advice he
relies.  There are times, however, when he chooses to be headstrong and
ignore Sunjay (on such issues as approaching a pretty girl or passively
accepting the taunts of older students).  Unsurprisingly, those
incidents typically lead to embarrassment or worse.</P>
<P>     Stories about clashing cultures are nothing new to movies.  In
recent years, the subject has formed the basis for comedies (such as
the wildly popular 1986 release CROCODILE DUNDEE, about an Australian
transplanted to New York), science fiction (STAR TREK IV:  THE VOYAGE
HOME, about a group from the twenty-third century coping with
modern-day San Francisco), and numerous dramas (including 1992's CITY
OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA).  Now, PRAYING WITH ANGER can be added
to the list.  The debut film of M.  Night Shyamalan (who produced,
directed, wrote, and starred), PRAYING WITH ANGER attempts to present
another perspective on this issue.</P>
<P>     Comparisons with CITY OF JOY and MISSISSIPPI MASALA are
appropriate.  Like PRAYING WITH ANGER, both of those movies deal with
friction between Indian and American traditions.  However, where MASALA
sets the story in the United States and CITY OF JOY makes the
protagonist a white male adrift in Calcutta, PRAYING WITH ANGER sends
an American born Indian to the "home" that he has never known.</P>
<P>     The film is at its best when it explores Indian culture and
tradition, and examines how Dev must adjust to live in what for him is
a strange world.  These scenes, which make up a majority of the first
half of PRAYING WITH ANGER, are often fascinating.  Shyamalan doesn't
reveal anything extraordinary, but neither does he shrink from showing
the often-painful rigidity imposed by India's caste divisions.  Social
class is very much an issue, both as it applies to Dev and the people
that he comes to care about.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the basic plot is a series of formulas neatly
bundled together.  There's the requisite tragic love story, the girl
who bucks the centuries-old system, the outsider who comes to be
respected by those who previously despised him, and, of course, the
coming of age tale.  PRAYING WITH ANGER lacks originality and
inspiration, and after the initial interest has worn off, the story has
a hard time holding the viewer's attention.  It's always apparent
what's around the next corner, and the one after that as well.</P>
<P>     Shyamalan occasionally has problems with dialogue.  Most of the
time, the lines are okay, but there are moments when he launches into
jarring, overblown sermon-like lectures.  We do not, for example, need
to have it explicitly and repeatedly pointed out how beautiful the
traditions of India are when the camerawork places them adequately on
display.</P>
<P>     Like the dialogue, the characters are uneven.  At times, the
people in PRAYING WITH ANGER seem real, but there are occasions when
they become foils for the plot.  Dev's sudden and complete
transformation in the film's final act is difficult to swallow,
especially since we are never presented with enough evidence to justify
such a radical swing in point-of-view.</P>
<P>     To the credit of M. Night Shyamalan, he strove for something
lavish and ambitious in this, his first effort.  While PRAYING WITH
ANGER is not a total success, there are enough glimpses of promise to
indicate that Shyamalan may have a fine future in film making.
However, beyond those brief-but-sterling moments, PRAYING WITH ANGER
relies on too much stock material for it to be satisfying enough to
warrant more than a passing interest.</P>
