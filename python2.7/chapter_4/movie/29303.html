<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An auspicious debut for director Joel Coen and for the Coen brothers as a writer
and director team, as this film noir is delightfully thrilling. </P>
<P>Texas bar-owner Marty (Hedaya) hires a seedy private detective, Visser (Walsh),
to snoop on his unfaithful wife Abby (McDormand-the wife of the director). He
brings back photos of her in bed with one of his bartenders, Ray (Getz). </P>
<P>Marty is fueled by a quiet anger from within and arranges with the unscrupulous
private eye to murder the two lovers, as the private eye agrees to bend the
rules for $10,000. But the private eye decides to do it his way, and after he
collects his fee the twists in the plot lead to a series of misunderstandings,
guilt, and a double-cross. The misunderstandings result in a burial of someone
still alive, a gruesome shooting where the victim is also pounded to death by a
battery, and an impalement of a hand caught on a window sill which leads to the
victim being shot to death when mistaken for someone else. The double-cross
comes about when the hired killer doesn't kill the one he is supposed to. </P>
<P>Blood Simple is highlighted by an absolutely wonderous performance that is both
sleazy and diabolical by M. Emmet Walsh. It also has some pretty funny dialogue,
as one bartender (Williams) complains that someone came into the bar and asked
for a discount for alcoholics. When the private eye tells his client the bad
news about his wife's affair, he also tells him the good news: "At least she
wasn't having an affair with the colored guy." Made on a shoestring budget, the
film sparkles because its characters are lively and quirky. I saw it on a
recently digitally-remastered video version where the director cut off a few
minutes of unnecessary dialogue. </P>
