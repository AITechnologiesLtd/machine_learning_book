<P>   One church group has already protested "Stigmata,"
insuring that while the movie may not topple the invincible
"Sixth Sense" from box-office domination, Rupert
Wainwright's film will attract a larger audience than it
deserves.  Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage's script indicates
that since Jesus proclaimed in his sermons that "the kingdom
of God is within you," he implicitly warned against the building
of stone and marble edifices (read: beautiful, expensive
churches) to glorify his word.  While this motif is supposed to
make "Stigmata" subversive, kids have learned this fact of
spiritual life virtually on their first day in Sunday school--or so
I hear from Ed Johnson-Ott, my distinguished online
colleague in Indianapolis.  Since the Gospel according to
Luke has long accommodated this precept, the notion is
nothing new and certainly no cardinal, however reactionary,
would think of killing a woman who is involuntarily bearing
this message to the citizens of Pittsburgh.</P>
<P>   "Stigmata" is done up flagrantly in MTV style, given its
frequent flurries of blood-soaked vistas jolted to dramatic life
by a soundtrack contributed by Smashing Pumpkins singer
Billy Corgan's version of the Vatican rag.  The music is at
least an improvement over the usual Carmina Burana cliche
so often trotted out when melodramatic religiosity is required. 
Director Wainwright, expecting a fidgety audience unwilling or
unable to meditate upon one location or plot for too long,
switches his scenes sporadically from a Brazilian village to
the Vatican to New York City to Pittsburgh in a merry-go-
roundelay of geographical panoramas and cultures.  His
characters speak English, Aramaic, Italian and Portuguese as
they wind their way through a series of plots and subplots
involving a cardinal who thinks he's the Pittsburgh strangler,
a priest who thinks he's a scientist, and a manicurist who has
acquired the skill of having nails cut her.</P>
<P>   Father Kiernan is under Vatican assignments with the
thankless job of proving that miracles just don't happen any
more--not on 34th Street, not in Milan and certainly not on
Main Street, in the wilderness or in the rain.  When he visits
a church in a Brazilian village which has reported a statue
crying bloody tears, he furiously takes pictures with his Nikon
like a frocked Faye Dunaway but is prevented from wrapping
the statue and shipping it for lab analysis to his eerie boss,
Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), in the Vatican.  But
this does not stop the rich, bourgeois mother of Frankie
Paige from shipping rosary beads--stolen from a dead priest
lying in state next to the statue--to her daughter in Pittsburgh,
after which Frankie begins to bleed in the same areas of her
body from which the wounded Jesus bled on the cross--the
stigmata of the movie's title.  Suffering epileptic-type seizures
in several incidents while bleeding from the wrist, feet and
head, she baffles the doctors who believe the wounds are
self-inflicted and upsets her best friend, Donna (Nia Long),
who runs after her like a mother hen each time she is
overcome.  Father Kiernan takes on the task of finding out
the truth behind the affronts to Frankie's body.</P>
<P>   The most intriguing feature of the story is the sexual
gamesmanship between a priest of matinee-idol looks, Father
Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) and the 23-year-old
manicurist, Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) who hits on him,
having us in the audience place bets on whether she can nail
him before she gets overly nailed herself.  </P>
<P>   As the Smashing Pumpkins-inspired soundtrack is pumped
up now and then, Hitchcockian birds fly about, undulating first
in the Brazilian church, later in Frankie's capacious
apartment, summoning thoughts of the 13th century St.
Francis of Assisi who was said to lose a pint of blood a day
when that great friend of animals himself suffered from the
stigmata.  The scenes featured prominently in the movie's
trailer--a man's ominous voice originating from the body of
this clueless manicurist who suddenly graffities her walls with
fluent Aramaic--are reminiscent of Linda Blair's outcries in the
daddy of the genre, "The Exorcist," and by now are anything
but scary.  </P>
<P>   Lack of credibility is the least of the movie's problems. 
Over-the-top imagery, music, and rapid-fire editing are the
culprits that stigmatize the story, one which, like "The
Haunting," is too overwrought to scare anyone  or to
intimidate any devoutly religious folks concerned about the
film's allegedly subversive strain.  Gabriel Byrne is
wonderfully cast as the handsome priest who, despite his
meetings with the seductive (but in my view unappealing)
Patricia Arquette nonetheless convinces us that he is fighting
his own demons, while Ms. Arquette tries unavailingly to
show that a beautician can be as captivating as Warren
Beatty.</P>
