<PRE>.                            SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Easily the best comedy of the year - and the best film of the year
to star Joseph Fiennes and feature Queen Elizabeth as a major character
- SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE gets a hands-down recommendation for all
filmgoers.</P>
<P>     The clever premise follows one William Shakespeare (Fiennes), stuck
with writer's block while trying to pen "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter" and unable to get his own love life going to boot.</P>
<P>     Enter Viola (Paltrow), an upper-class woman with aspirations of
acting in the men-only theatre who sneaks in (in drag) to audition for
the part of Romeo. But not only is Viola a woman, she's betrothed to the
Duke of Wessex and is set to sail for the New World in a matter of
weeks. It's only natural that young Will falls for the lady.</P>
<P>     Wacky hijinx ensue, but SHAKESPEARE never falls into the syrupy
love story trap, and the insight into what-might-have-been is a real
treat for fans of the bard. Fiennes does excellent work here, as does
Paltrow, who always seems to act better when affecting a British accent.</P>
<P>     The six Golden Globe nominations are right on target - definitely
check SHAKESPEARE out at an art house near you.</P>
