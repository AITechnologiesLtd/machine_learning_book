<PRE>THIRTEEN DAYS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Roger Donaldson
Written by: Ernest R. May (novel), Philip D. Zelikow (novel), David Self</P>
<P>Umm, it's the Cuban missile crisis folks. I'm going to keep the plot summary 
really short, and if you want to know more before seeing the film I'd 
recommend breaking out the old history books. When the Russians begin moving 
nuclear warheads into Cuba, the US catches them with aerial photographs. 
When confronted with accusations of their activities, the Russians deny 
everything and claim to the world that the US is trying to make them look 
bad in an effort to start a war. President John F. Kennedy (Bruce 
Greenwood), Robert Kennedy (Stephen Culp), and Kennedy's chief adviser, 
Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) have to decide what to do about the 
situation. The joint chiefs want to go in, guns blazing and destroy 
everything in Cuba before occupying the country. Other advisers want to set 
up a blockade, keeping any Russian ships from entering Cuba with more 
supplies. The last alternative, which almost no one is willing to consider, 
is to make a deal with Russia and remove the nuclear weapons we have in 
Turkey in exchange for Russia's agreement to remove all weapons from Cuba 
and never put any in the country again. They have to choose quickly, because 
in only thirteen days the nuclear weapons in Cuba will be active.</P>
<P>Let me admit something to you before we begin. There's only one reason I 
went to see <i>Thirteen Days</i>, and I'm ashamed to admit it was just to 
see the preview for the upcoming <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movie. Yes, the 
trailer was very nice, but I was even more surprised to discover that I 
truly enjoyed the movie which followed. I remember seeing the previews for 
<i>Thirteen Days</i> some four or five months ago, and thinking two things 
to myself: "That's going to be completely inaccurate" and "How can a story 
on the Cuban missile crisis be all that suspenseful?" I'm happy to report 
that I was pleasantly surprised on both counts. Being something of a history 
buff, I expected the film to maul the real events. I pictured behind the 
scenes espionage, unreported armed conflicts, hidden murders and more (I 
half expected something as ridiculous as Kennedy himself flying a 
thunderbird into Cuba to drop a necessary bomb). Surprisingly (and 
thankfully), the film stays fairly true to the real events. Yes, some of the 
technology used didn't yet exist, and a few behind the scenes dealings were 
obviously made up/theorized, but otherwise this is quite historically 
accurate (unlike, say, <i>U-571</i> from earlier in the year). As for the 
suspense, well, lets just say I had no idea a whole lot of talking and 
pensive expressions could keep me on the edge of my seat.</P>
<P>I must say, when I first read the cast list for <i>Thirteen Days</i>, my 
expectations plummeted into the basement. I've never been a fan of Kevin 
"Bad Sci-fi" Costner, and I've never understood peoples' fascination with 
his brand of "I'm playing the exact same guy with different names" acting. 
True to form, his acting in <i>Thirteen Days</i> simply bugged me. In 
particular, his impersonation of a Boston accent was gratingly bad. 
Thankfully, Costner is given tremendous support from the unlikeliest of 
places. Bruce Greenwood, who has shocked and appalled with one rancid 
performance after another (<i>Double Jeopardy</i> and <i>Rules of 
Engagement</i> being prime examples) is outstanding as JFK. This is made 
even more surprising by the fact that Greenwood doesn't particularly look 
like Kennedy and yet you don't question his playing the man for more than a 
minute. Equally impressive is Steven Culp as Robert Kennedy. Culp's career 
thus far has been composed almost entirely of brief parts in films and one 
recurring character in the television series "JAG", but I expect things to 
take off for him after his turn in <i>Thirteen Days</i>. The remaining cast 
members all give decent performances, the only exception in my opinion being 
Madison Mason (<i>Crazy in Alabama</i>), who seems to be having far too much 
fun making his Admiral Anderson look like a complete jerk.</P>
<P>It's a testament to the film's script and Roger Donaldson's (<i>Species</i>) 
direction that a story we all know the end to manages to keep us guessing, 
wondering, and hoping for a good outcome. Thanks mainly to Donaldson, the 
story moves at an unrelenting pace, seldom giving you more than a few 
minutes to sit back and take a breather. These breather scenes tend to 
involve things like Kenny visiting his son's football game, or he and the 
Kennedys sitting in the oval office, reminiscing. Otherwise the scenes are 
packed with taunt verbal action between Kennedy and his advisers. It's true, 
the joint chiefs are shown as a little more villainous than is likely to 
have been true, and the Kennedys are shown as indomitable heros, but you 
know what? That's that's the way Americans seem to like it. Something else 
I've got to commend Donaldson for is the amount of restraint he shows when 
it comes to military conflict being portrayed. As well all know, there 
wasn't any actual combat in the Cuban missile crisis, and I was pleasantly 
surprised to find that there are really only two or three scenes in the 
movie which even resemble armed conflict. They're brief scenes, involving 
planes flying over Cuba taking pictures while ground troops and SAM silos 
take pot shots at them, but there's something patriotic about seeing our 
boys fly in there, and I'll be damned if it didn't bring a tear of pride to 
my eye. Alright, I'm better now.</P>
<P>The faults with <i>Thirteen Days</i> are few, but significant. First, and 
most importantly, the film simply runs out of steam. I realize it's 
difficult for any movie to keep its audience engrossed for well over two 
hours (though <i>Traffic</i> managed that very thing with apparent ease), 
but after a tense, involving two hours, the sudden plummet into the depths 
of boredom in the film's final half hour comes as something of a shock. 
Also, the film ends on a schmaltzy, feel-good note which feels quite out of 
place compared with the rest of the movie. A minor quibble would be with a 
few of Donaldson's filming ideas. For example, at times the film suddenly 
goes into black and white for a few moments before switching back into 
color. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to when this will happen, and 
it succeeds in doing little more than confusing the audience (I heard a 
fellow behind me telling his wife he'd go talk to the manager about their 
projector being broken). Fortunately, working heavily in the film's favor is 
the score by Trevor Jones (<i>Dark City</i>). The score is not only 
brilliantly written, but perfectly utilized; underscoring and highlighting 
every scene it's played during rather than overpowering the action on 
screen. <i>13 Days</i> runs a long 145 minutes, so get some rest before you 
catch it. I'd recommend the film to fans of political thrillers and history 
buffs (who, if nothing else, will get a kick out of some of the technology 
being used) and give it four out of five stars.</P>
