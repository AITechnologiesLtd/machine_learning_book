FLAWLESS
A movie review by Joe Barlow
(c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING: Robert De Niro, Philip Seymour Hoffman
DIRECTOR: Joel Schumacher
WRITER: Joel Schumacher
RATED: R
RELEASED: 1999</PRE>
<P>You have to pity poor Joel Schumacher. Not only is he accused of
single-handedly destroying the Batman franchise, but his last film,
the bleak 8mm, was ridiculed by the majority of critics in America. I
can visualize Schumacher's conversation with himself: "Hmm... I've
just made several critical duds in a row. What am I doing wrong? Let's
see. The Batman films and 8mm all share dark, creepy atmospheres, and
that genre's obviously not working for me. Let's go the opposite route
on the follow-up." </P>
<P>It's almost cute the way Schumacher rolls with the punches, and it's
no surprise that in Flawless, a title that almost dares critics not to
like the movie, the writer/director tries to play it safe... or at
least as safe as any film which centers around a flamboyant
transvestite can be considered to be. Everything here seems
specifically constructed to avoid offensiveness or friction, and it's
the movie's single biggest problem: everything has been so homogenized
that what could have been a fascinating film comes out as a cinematic
vanilla pudding, lacking any sort of flavor whatsoever. </P>
<P>Walter Koonz (Robert De Niro) is a cranky ex-cop and raging homophobe
who finds himself partially paralyzed and unable to speak properly
after suffering a stroke. Embarrassed by his condition, Koonz begins
taking voice lessons from Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a
local transvestite who adheres to every gay stereotype and cliche'
imaginable. You'll no doubt be shocked to learn that as they grow
closer, they form a deep bond. Just consider this the low-calorie
version of As Good as it Gets. </P>
<P>Flawless desperately wants to be The Odd Couple, and there are moments
in which it comes close, drawing us into the lives of the characters
as they come to terms with each other and their differences. Both De
Niro and Hoffman are engaging actors, with Hoffman's bubbling screen
persona serving as a brilliant counterpoint to Hoffman's gruff
demeanor. They each have a firm handle on two very challenging
characters (De Niro actually wore weights in his clothes to help him
prepare for his role as a stroke victim), and they work well together.</P>
<P>But sadly, the performances are all Flawless has going for it. The few
sparks of fire De Niro and Hoffman are able to inject into the story
are quickly extinguished by Schumacher's adherence to the lowest
common denominator, such as the laughable finale, which is so deeply
mired in cliches that it's hard to resist the temptation to hurl
popcorn at the screen. Nor is the drama helped by the unimaginative
shooting methods employed by Schumacher. We may as well be watching a
TV sitcom--or a play. </P>
<P>I'll give Schumacher an 'A' for effort: with Flawless he's
demonstrated a willingness to deviate from his previous work, and he's
created a film with the potential for power and drama. Unfortunately,
the director does not yet appear to have either the confidence or
ability to helm a project which requires such depth; hence, we're
treated to countless gay stereotypes and unimaginative plot twists
(Stolen drug money? Yawn). Oh well. It was a nice try, Joel, and I
mean that. Maybe next time. </P>
