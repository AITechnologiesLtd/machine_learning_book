<PRE>                                   MINDWALK
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1996 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Bernt Capra
>From _The Turning Point_
A novel by Fritjof Capra</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Liv Ullman

         John Heard</PRE>
<PRE>     Up there, I call this article the 'talkies.'</PRE>
<P>MINDWALK is a talkie.  Its three characters: a politician, a
poet and a physicist meet at a medieval castle on the island
of St.  Michelle in France.  The poet, who is also a
political speech writer, is called by the politician who
needs his help to be elected.  This the  set up.</P>
<PRE>     But it is not about politics or writing.</PRE>
<P>     Low key is the phrase to describe MINDWALK.  It's a sort
of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE for those with a philosophical bent.</P>
<P>     I thought that it would be good for Easter Eve and I'm
running it again in the background as I write this in the
morning.  Though the film is low key, it's not boring but
succeeds in being visually interesting throughout.</P>
<P>     Here is probably a good place to throw in the fact that
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME will be available on video shortly as
well.</P>
<P>     These two films came out very close together and are
released close together for the home market.  Hey, maybe
they'll be on Public TV in two weeks, how could I know?</P>
<P>     MINDWALK is a conversation.  The writing here is what is
fascinating.  Fascinating because it is captured for a film
audience which will probably remain rather small.  MINDWALK
is a conversation about science and history.  Like James
Burke's _Connections_ programs on PBS, MINDWALK seeks to see
the world in a new way; to get a new perspective on what the
guy on Saturday Night live called 'the big picture.'</P>
<P>     It would be hard to put my finger on a politically
correct issue which is NOT in MINDWALK.  But it's virtually
impossible to talk about one thing without talking about
everything else.</P>
<P>     So MINDWALK is a good video to listen to and watch if
you are interested in _everything_. :-)</P>
<PRE>     I enjoyed and can recommend it as an intellectual
exercise.  </PRE>
