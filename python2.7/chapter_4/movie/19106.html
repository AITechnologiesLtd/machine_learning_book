<P>WARNING: If you are easily offended by such things as poop jokes, fart
jokes, puke jokes, racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia,
kids swearing like drunken sailors at a whorehouse, real-looking dildos,
nudity, cartoon sex, violence, blood and gore, Saddam Hussein and Satan
doing the nasty, and most of all, musical numbers...then this film just
ain't your bag! Oh, and by the way, this is NOT for kids :)</P>
<P>PLOT:
The gang from South Park attempt to save two Canadian foul-mouthed comedians
who are set to be executed by the United States of America, after its
declaration of war on Canada. Unbeknownst to everyone except for the kids
(Their dead friend Kenny returned as a ghost to tell them this bit of news),
the successful execution will lead to the rise of Satan and Saddam Hussein
from hell, and to their domination of the world. Simple enough?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie is rude, crude, racist, sexist, homophobic, cheesily animated,
and pretty much offensive in every which way that you could possibly
imagine...it's also fuckin' hilarious!!! Before I saw this film, I had never
really sat through an entire episode of the "South Park" TV show. Not
because I didn't want to or anything, I just don't watch a lot of
television. Now as much as this film is probably geared more towards the
true fans of the show, I was still able to enjoy all of its disgusting,
over-the-edge, offensive-to-everyone, humor. This movie is definitely made
for people who are NOT tied to any politically correct soapbox. In fact,
that was the one thing that I really dug about this comedy more than any of
the other THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY-type films that have been cropping up
of late. It didn't ease up near the end, or pretend to be emotional at any
point, or apologize for anything that it stood for. It was nasty, raunchy,
and just plain ol' American-Joe funny to me. No holds barred!</P>
<P>Being Canadian myself, I must say that I was probably a little biased by the
hilarious depiction of our country and its circumstances within the story.
"Canada...kill them before they kill us!", read one T-shirt in the movie.
Pretty funny. There were also a lot of "smaller jokes" which may slip you by
if you're not paying close attention (Listen closely near the end, when one
of the African-American soldiers sounds peculiarly like one Jar-Jar
character from THE PHANTOM MENACE...nice touch, guys!). The one thing that
might've been improved on in this film, is the matter of musical numbers
that scattered its length. Most of them were pretty funny, but they didn't
need to have every single character break out in song at some point of the
movie. Then again, it was a small price to pay for an overall enjoyable time
at the theatre of movies. Just make sure that you leave your "thinking cap"
home for this one, switch off all of your politically correct electrodes,
and get ready to be entertained by a bunch of immature kids with filthy
mouths, fucked-up thoughts and the balls to pull it all off. Of course I am
speaking of the two men behind this raunchy production: Trey Parker and Matt
Stone.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director/producer/writer Trey Parker's real name is Randolph Parker III. He
and friend Matt Stone have been slated to write the prequel to the movie
DUMB AND DUMBER (7.5/10) (Current working title is DUMB AND DUMBER: THE
EARLY YEARS). They're also in a band called DVDA. Matt is the drummer. The
band's name comes from the term Double Vaginal, Double Anal, which is
supposed to be the highest paying performance given by an actress in a porn
flick. Up until now, DVDA has produced three original songs, "I Am
Chewbacca", "Fuck That Guy From Bush", and "Now You're A Man", which is
included on the ORGAZMO film soundtrack. A film written and directed by Trey
Parker.
Some celebrity cameo voices in this film include George Clooney as the
doctor, Minnie Driver as Brooke Shields, Eric Idle as the scientist, and
Mike Judge.
Word on the street is that despite the title of this film, Matt Stone and
Trey Parker were forced by the MPAA to cut about 2 minutes of footage from
this film to bring it out of the NC-17 range and into an R rating. I guess
they're "almost" as nasty as they wanted to be. We'll have to wait for DVD
for the other stuff.</P>
