<PRE>JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK
------------------------------</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Kevin Smith ("Clerks") goes back to where he started, giving
an entire feature over to the Greek chorus who've appeared in all his films,
Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  When Jay and Silent Bob hear
that the 'Bluntman and Chronic' comic book characters based on them have been 
sold to Miramax for a feature film, they find Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck, 
"Chasing Amy") to get their cut.  Holden's sold off his share to Banky Edwards 
(Jason Lee, "Chasing Amy") but does introduce the boys to the Internet.  Jay 
becomes incensed when he sees all the rude comments on the web about his alter 
ego and the dynamic duo decide to take on Hollywood in "Jay and Silent Bob 
Strike Back."</P>
<P>Kevin Smith gathers just about everyone who's ever been in one of his films
(although Alanis Morrisette appears to have been cut) to have fun dissing
Miramax, Paul Thomas Anderson, the success of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
and the stupidity of his own characters.  You'll find parodies of "E.T.,"
"Armageddon," "The Fugitive," and "Planet of the Apes" in this free-wheeling,
good-natured, foul-mouthed grab bag.</P>
<P>Jay and Silent Bob meet up with a hitchhiker (George Carlin) who informs them
that the 'unwritten book of the road' requires thumbers to orally service
their drivers - just before they're picked up by a nun (Carrie Fisher - "Star
Wars homage #2 after the "Star Wars-like" logo Smith's emblazoned across
his film).  Then Jay becomes smitten with Justice (Shannon Elizabeth, 
"American Pie"), a jewel thief travelling with Sissy (Eliza Dushku, "Bring It 
On"), Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, wife of Kevin Smith) and Chrissy 
(Ali Larter, "Legally Blonde").  Sissy makes Justice set up Jay and Silent Bob,
telling them they're out to set free lab animals.  </P>
<P>Jay and Silent Bob end up escaping with an Orangutan while the girls make off 
with a cache of diamonds, but now they've got idiot Federal Wildlife Marshall 
Wilenholly (Will Ferrell, "Superstar") on their trail.  Eventually the lads 
make their way onto the Miramax lot, where they crash the filming of "Good Will
Hunting 2:  Hunting Season" before encountering James Van Der Beek ("Varsity 
Blues") and Jason Biggs ("American Pie") in the Bluntman and Chronic outfits 
they appropriate.  They dazedly reply to a set call by director Chaka (Chris 
Rock, "Dogma") and Silent Bob finds himself in a light saber dual with 
Cock-Knocker played by none other than Mark 'Luke Skywalker' Hamill.</P>
<P>Smith's film is clearly an exercise for his extended filmmaking family to have
fun and they mostly let us in on it.  This lightweight comedy is wispy, though,
vanishing from memory within 24 hours of having seen it.  Smith does have a
talent for dialogue, making even excessive foul remarks still seem amusing,
but his visual style (or lack thereof) still needs attention (early scenes
in Holden's office look really subpar).</P>
<P>Most amusing is the trashing of Affleck by himself, Damon and Smith.  Affleck
is accused of having dead hookers in his trailer and his face adorns a giant
movie billboard titled 'Moonraper.'  Damon's introduced doing a 'lion face,
lemon face' acting exercise with an admirable 'straight' face.  A movie fan
site, presumably based on Ain't-It-Cool-News, is redubbed the 'Poop Shoot'
here.
While there are numerous references to things being 'gay' and Jay's sexual
identity being questioned, GLAAD's recent attack on Smith seems like misplaced
overkill.</P>
<P>Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are front and center stage this time and prove
they can hold it.  The reliable Will Ferrell is amusingly clueless and just
about the entire cast of "American Pie" acquit themselves well.  A background
scene showing Jay and Silent Bob's first infant meeting features Kevin Smith's
baby daughter as his alter ego.  Gus Van Sant gives a fun cameo while Wes 
Craven gives an awkward one.  Chris Rock isn't funny at all as the shrill 
director.  Morris Day gives a send off right out of "Purple Rain."</P>
<P>"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is fun while you're watching it, but with
the talent on hand, you can't help but feel it should have been a whole lot
better.</P>
