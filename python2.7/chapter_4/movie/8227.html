<P>     A SIMPLE WISH falls into the category occupied by dozens of other 
recent family features that share a few traits -- they're innocuous, 
mediocre, and thoroughly forgettable.  The movie, directed by Michael 
Ritchie (THE BAD NEWS BEARS, FLETCH) from a script by Jeff Rothberg, 
isn't bad per se, but it's the kind of production where nothing sticks 
in the mind once you've exited the theater.  Inept films linger like a 
bad taste and good movies bathe the viewer in a pleasant afterglow, but 
A SIMPLE WISH's feeble impression vanishes the moment that there's 
something marginally interesting to captivate the attention (like 
looking both ways before crossing the street).</P>
<P>     The best thing about A SIMPLE WISH is young actress Mara Wilson, 
who despite being noticeably older here than in her previous two 
outings, A MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and MATILDA, still retains her 
feckless charm and unforced acting style.  The worst thing about the 
movie is Martin Short.  Under ideal circumstances, Short can be grating, 
but here, attempting to mimic Jim Carrey, he's occasionally unbearable.  
The scenes where he's not around tend to be A SIMPLE WISH's most 
entertaining.  </P>
<P>     The plot flows along the lines of a modern-day, fractured fable.  
Seven-year old Anabel Greening (Wilson) is facing a dire prospect:  
unless her widowed father (Robert Pastorelli), a Central Park hansom cab 
driver, gets a part in the Broadway musical, TWO CITIES, he has decided 
to pack up Anabel and her older brother, Charlie (Francis Capra), and 
move to Nebraska.  To prevent this unthinkable event from occurring, 
Anabel requests the aid of a fairy godmother.  What she gets is the 
incompetent Murray (Short), the only guy who's working on a fairy 
godmothers' holiday, and, instead of granting Anabel's simple wish, he 
exacerbates matters.  To further complicate the situation, the evil 
witch Claudia (Kathleen Turner) is out to take control of the North 
American Fairy Godmothers' Association, and Murray has the magic wand 
she craves the most.</P>
<P>     At least A SIMPLE WISH never takes itself seriously.  It knows that 
it's a silly film, and everyone plays along, keeping the tone somewhere 
between relaxed and campy.  Kathleen Turner and Amanda Plummer have fun 
chewing on the scenery, although their antics are mercifully restrained 
compared to Short's.  Francis Capra manages to be a little less 
obnoxious here than he was in KAZAAM, and Robert Pastorelli (MICHAEL) 
brings an appealing mixture of dignity and likeability to his role.  
Teri Garr and Ruby Dee have small parts as traditional fairy godmothers.</P>
<P>     There are times when the film's self-deprecating humor is amusing.  
Turner has some of the best lines, describing the job of a fairy 
godmother as "listening to [little girls'] insipid wishes" and calling 
Cinderella a "masochistic idiot."  The script refers to and/or pokes fun 
at such targets as bedtime stories, Broadway musicals in general and 
Andrew Lloyd Webber in particular, Shakespeare, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and, 
incredibly, CITIZEN KANE (watch the snow globe).  It would all be a lot 
more enjoyable if Martin Short didn't keep interrupting.</P>
<P>     It's easy to tell that A SIMPLE WISH doesn't have the limitless 
budget of Universal's other recent summer release, THE LOST WORLD.  
Spielberg's summer blockbuster was defined by state-of-the-art special 
effects.  A SIMPLE WISH is hampered by some rather cheap-looking 
visuals.  The film's attempts at magic are awkward to watch.  For 
example, there's a group of digitally-designed frogs that allow the 
viewer to appreciate just how impressive the Budweiser TV commercial 
creations are.</P>
<P>     I assume the target group for A SIMPLE WISH is basically the same 
one as for last year's MATILDA.  A number of similar elements are in 
place:  a plucky heroine played by Mara Wilson, magic, echoes of 
Dickens, a cartoon-like villain, and a happy ending.  Of course, since A 
SIMPLE WISH isn't as skillfully constructed and is saddled with Martin 
Short, the best advice I can offer is to rent MATILDA now and wait for A 
SIMPLE WISH to hit video shelves in the near future.  It won't take too 
long -- this film doesn't have the strength or stamina to stand up 
against the other mid-July competition.  </P>
