<PRE>                         EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is an almost ghastly misfire
          from Woody Allen combining his least interesting
          plot ever, paper-thin characters and badly executed
          musical numbers.  Besides a couple of moments of
          cleverness, this film turns a bad Woody Allen
          comedy into a bad Woody Allen musical comedy.  I
          found this was the hardest film I had to sit
          through this year.  Rating: -1 (-4 to +4).
          New York Critics: 13 positive, 5 negative, 8 mixed</PRE>
<P>     It may be partially my fault.  The night before I saw my first new
musical film in years I prepared myself by watching my favorite
musical, Norman Jewison's FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.  This would allow me to
compare techniques, I told myself.  Oh dear.  Not only is EVERYONE SAYS
I LOVE YOU not FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, it is not much of anything.  It is,
in fact, a bigger disappointment than MIGHTY APHRODITE.  That film, his
last but for this, made fun of the conventions of the Greek Chorus in a
play and this one makes fun of the traditions of the musical.  Take two
TV situation comedy plots, sprinkle in some fairly incompetently done
musical numbers and what do you get?  What I got was the obvious
conclusion that Woody Allen has lost the recipe and no longer makes
decent films.  Can it really be true that the director who made films
like LOVE AND DEATH and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS or even BULLETS OVER
BROADWAY made a film that misfires in eight directions the way this one
does?  Woody Allen in the past has created characters, humorous but
very real at the same time, that the viewer cared about.  That seems
unimportant to him now.  The people in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU are
paper-thin.  They seem to be no more than just pieces to move around a
game board of uninteresting romantic situations.  Allen is seemingly so
desperate for a laugh he is even stealing gags from THE ROCKY HORROR
PICTURE SHOW--in this case a male dancer in a wheelchair kicking his
leg like a Radio City Rockette.  The old Woody Allen was a font of
comedic ideas and would never have needed to borrow a gag from another
writer.</P>
<P>     Steffi (played by Goldie Hawn), her previous husband Joe (Woody
Allen), and her current husband Bob (Alan Alda) get along very well
with each other.  Steffi and Bob are sort of wealthy hippy-dippy
liberals and activists for contemporary liberal causes.  They all look
forward to the impending marriage of Steffi's and Bob's ditzy daughter
Skylar to the bland and slightly dense Holden (Edward Norton).  Little
do they realize that one of Steffi's causes will cause problems in
their relationship.  A second plot has Joe, unlucky in love, courting
Von (Julia Roberts) making unfair use of information his daughter
gleans from eavesdropping on Von's visits to her analyst.  Allen can
probably now play the luckless schmoe role in his sleep and does it
what would be perfectly but for the fact that much of the audience is
losing interest.  There are a few faint laughs from having the super-
liberal Bob have a neo-conservative son Scott (Lucas Haas), but Scott's
political arguments with his father are only on the most shallow and
cliched level.  Allen is telling stories he can write in his sleep and
writing himself roles for which he can phone in performances.</P>
<P>     Whether it is an attempt at satire of the musical form, or whether
it is just incompetence, one grows rather weary of hearing people sing
who really should not be singing in public.  At first it seems like it
is just Edward Norton who lacked the talent, but as the film wears on
there are more major characters singing when it would have been better
to remain silent.  Allen gets some humor from having very realistic
looking people in the background suddenly joining the production
number.  But after a while having people singing badly, including major
characters, goes a little stale.  Some have found one of the musical
routines, taking place in a hospital, to have some on-target humor.  It
did not do much for me, but a second musical number at a mortuary was
for me the (not-too-high) high-point of EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.
Allen has some fun with the ridiculous things some dancers do in
musical numbers in the old Busby Berkeley musicals, but the fun rarely
rises above the whimsical.</P>
<P>     EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU was a noble experiment on Woody Allen's
part to try to experiment in the medium of the musical and perhaps milk
some humor laughing at the conventions of the musical.  In theory it
might have worked, but even a musical needs a better story than the
one(s) Allen wrote.  I rate EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU a -1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
