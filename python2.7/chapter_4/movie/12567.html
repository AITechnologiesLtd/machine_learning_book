<PRE>GODZILLA</PRE>
<P>STARRING: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo,
Michael Lerner, Harry Shearer
WRITTEN BY: Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich
DIRECTED BY: Roland Emmerich</P>
<PRE>**OVERVIEW**</PRE>
<PRE> ...No Firebreath...</PRE>
<P> There are two things I realized that are different with this
Godzilla...let's get it out right now.  No Firebreath is one thing.
This could prove very useful to those pesky helicopters.  The other is
his legs, not erect like a man's but more like a chicken's.  Because
of that, he walks sloped over, unlike the man-in-the-rubber-suit of
the original films.</P>
<P> So...let us begin with Godzilla.  After a very clever introduction, a
Japanese fisher gets sliced in half.  Then reports from the
Philippines point that a creature took a troll across an island and
dove back into the water.  The military soon calls upon the
government's top nuclear research agent to investigate the strange
residue left behind the creature's imprints.  This is where Nick
Tatopoulos (which no one-can pronounce), no doubt named after the man
who designed the new creature, Patrick Tatopoulos, enters.  He
believes this creature has mutated from a previous reptilian species
by fallout from a French nuclear testing site nearby.  This mutation
soon destroys a trio of fishing boats.  The path points towards a
destination: The city that never sleeps...</P>
<P> Okay, Manhattan for those not paying attention to the trailers.</P>
<P> The creature jumps the pier and rides into the island, causing mayhem
and grief for all, including its Mayor, Ebert.  Okay...first of all,
he looks like the guy (played by Lerner).  He has that goofy "thumbs
up" slogan, PLUS his aid is named Gene...the whole joke is as subtle
as a 2x4 in the face...let's move on.</P>
<P> In an amazingly short time, all of Manhattan is evacuated.  Even the
death count here seems very minor and virtually no one is seen on
screen getting killed but we are assuming some get stomped.  Course,
the media jumps on it...A cameraman, nicknamed "Animal" (Azaria in a
scene stealing performance) gets a shot and fear spreads quickly.  By
nightfall, all of Manhattan is more or less clear.  Now, I don't care
but if they could do that, call up those Deep Impact people, you would
probably save a lot more in that movie.</P>
<P> Night--and the place is deserted--a fantastic battleground for a ten
story tall monster...without firebreath.  Another figure trying to
cash in the popularity is Audrey Timmonds (Pitillo).  She happens to
be an ex girlfriend of Nick.  She meets up with him in the military
quarantine and steals his information for a story break, which is then
promptly stolen by Audrey's mean boss, Charles Caimen
(Shearer...that's two from the Simpsons...Azaria being the other one).
She is bummed, and very depressed since Nick lost his job with the
military because of the leaked story.  Out on his luck, he moves to
leave town, but is kidnapped by the enigmatic Phillippe Roche (Reno as
great as ever).  Roche is a man who claims to be from the insurance
company when he first appears but is eventually revealed to be from
the French Secret Service, trying to clean up the mess his country
began.</P>
<P> He believes Nick's latest finding, a finding that the US military
doesn't endorse: That this creature (named Godzilla for the totally
inept) was born, and currently is, pregnant.  Perfect, above all
things, this creature is a tribble as well.  They decide to venture
forth into the deserted Manhattan to locate the Lizard's nest.
Course, as Nick and Phillipe sneak back into town, A pesky reporter
and her freaky reporter follow them in...</P>
<P> Did I mention there was a big lizard In this movie...Oh yes, and the
army sends everything they got against this thing...That includes
seemingly a hundred attack choppers, jets, submarines, tanks and lots
of expendable soldiers with machine guns.  All they have to believe in
is what Arnold said once in a movie, "If it bleeds, we can kill it."</P>
<PRE>**REVIEW**</PRE>
<P> Its just too bad they couldn't get access to the Z-1000 Attack
Hovercraft from Godzilla 1985.  Could have taken care of this creature
early.</P>
<P>   I loved the opening of this film.  It was craftily made with
cleaver old fashion photography of French nuclear testing under the
observing eye of some Iguanas.  It then moves into introducing its
characters, some of the best the Devlin / Emmerich have made.  The
film doesn't focus on four or five groups, just one.  Unfortunately,
they can't seem to put that much skill into writing that one plot.
When the film discusses the creature, the town, or the major plot
points to resolve problems, the film works well.  However when the
film lowers itself to discussing the personal problems of its
characters, the films stalls.  I mean who cares.  The writing is so
immature when dealing with the romance of two characters as a ten
story tall creature destroys New York.</P>
<P> I felt that Timmonds and Tatopolous to be very boring.  Just get back
to the action.  I wasn't interested in Sam Neil's relationship with
Laura Dern in Jurassic Park.  Who cares?  The other characters are
great.  I love Reno's character and Azaria steals his scenes.  They
make sense and if the film concentrated on them reacting rather than
dealing with their personal lives, the film would work a lot
better....  But when the action starts, it totally powers the simple
script.</P>
<P> The first appearance of the creature is simple.  I must admit, I miss
the erect rubber suit creature.  This new one looks too much like an
oversized raptor...and thus spawns the only real problem with e
action.  The film has some great scenes as choppers race down the fast
moving Godzilla through the streets at night.  And there are some
submarine sequences that really caught my eye.  And the climax is to
die for, but near the end of the film, as the group searches for the
rest, there are some sequences that seem taken right out of Jurassic
Park.  I have seen these before and didn't really care to see them
again.  We only care about the big destruction, and I am happy to say
the film delivers, kudos to the advertising campaign that kept so many
scenes out of the commercials.  It left so much more to see.  I really
enjoyed this thrill ride of a film.</P>
<P> Is it better than ID4?  I have to say yes.  It is not as funny
(because of the lack of Will Smith) but the action is much more
exciting with more screams and yelps from the audience.  I found
myself following along the fun and clapping at the destruction of the
town.  Godzilla was an exciting film and worth seeing twice, just as
long as you don't mind the petty love story...and no
firebreath...jeez...</P>
<PRE>TOP POINTS</PRE>

<PRE>MINUSES
 -POOR LOVE SUBPLOT
 -JURRASIC PARK SECTION TOO FAMILIAR</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  * * * * stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>DEMOGRAPHIC: Godzilla has very little onscreen violence but there is
wall to wall destruction.  People get crushed but you don't seem them
after.  There is not hefty violence beyond that.  Honestly, Godzilla
has probably the lowest body count of all the creature flicks of the
same name.  In those films, the town is not luckily deserted when the
mayhem begins...I still think that is very peculiar...</P>
