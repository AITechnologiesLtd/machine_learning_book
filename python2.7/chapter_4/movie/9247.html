<P>     With DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS, director Richard Spence and writer Tony 
Marchant have discovered a crop that hasn't been picked over in the 
field of screen romances.  This isn't just a boy-falls-for-girl story, 
it's boy-falls-for-girl-who-used-to-be-a-boy story.  And, while this 
premise is easy fodder for a farce, Spence plays it relatively straight, 
giving us a surprisingly sensitive look at the life of someone who has 
undergone a sex-change operation.  Of course, that's not to say that the 
director ignores the potential for comedy in the situation.  In fact, 
Spence keeps things from becoming too heavy by leavening the drama with 
humor.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons why DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS works is because of the 
caliber of acting.  Steven Mackintosh plays Kim (whose name used to be 
Karl) with a kind of wistful sadness.  We get the sense that the 
operation wasn't something she wanted, but that she needed it to 
properly define herself.  She felt uncomfortable in a man's body, but, 
by becoming a woman, she has been forced to live with the stigma that 
society places upon those who change genders.  Unlike in fantasies, Kim 
isn't a beautiful, petite woman, but someone whose features are still 
unmistakably masculine.  Mackintosh's studied performance realizes all 
of the complexities of Kim's situation and brings them to the screen 
with subtlety and intelligence.</P>
<P>     Playing opposite Mackintosh is Rupert Graves (who can currently be 
seen in INTIMATE RELATIONS).  While Kim is reserved and business-like in 
her approach to life, Graves' Prentice is an angry, rowdy man in a state 
of arrested adolescence who is in constant danger of losing his delivery 
job because of his rudeness to customers.  Graves' performance is 
uninhibited and electric, and his Prentice provides the perfect foil for 
Kim -- they're oil and water.  What's more, Prentice isn't a mental 
giant, so, rather than attempting to intellectualize and analyze his 
feelings for Kim, he reacts impulsively and not always intelligently.</P>
<P>     The two meet as the result of a traffic accident, and Prentice 
immediately thinks he recognizes Kim.  It doesn't take him long to place 
her -- they had been friends at school together over a decade and a half 
ago, when Kim was still Karl.  More out of curiosity than anything else, 
Prentice agrees to meet Kim for a drink, but his boorish behavior causes 
the reunion to turn ugly, and he and Kim part on bad terms.  She's 
determined never to see him again until, the next day at work, he 
delivers a bouquet of flowers accompanied by a very apologetic note.  </P>
<P>     In exploring the deepening relationship between the two leads, 
DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS deals with all the subjects we would expect -- 
sexual confusion, homosexuality, and how society in general reacts to 
this odd couple. Prentice doesn't know what to make of his feelings for 
Kim.  When he protests their growing closeness by saying "I'm straight," 
Kim's response is a simple "So am I."  The situation is exacerbated when 
the cops arrest them for disorderly conduct and mistake them for a gay 
couple.  Additionally, Prentice is understandably interested in the 
specifics of Kim's gender change -- why she did it, how it was 
performed, and what the results look like.  Through dialogue and a 
revealing scene featuring full frontal nudity (Mackintosh's breasts 
aren't real, but it's impossible to tell that), DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS 
satisfies Paul's (and our) curiosity about the matter.  </P>
<P>     The film has its weak points.  The convoluted ending wraps things 
up a little too neatly for my taste, although it does create a sense of 
closure.  Also, a subplot involving the marital struggles of Kim's 
sister (Saskia Reeves) and her husband is more intrusive than 
enlightening.  The best parts of the film are those when the focus is 
squarely upon Prentice and Kim as they try to work through their 
difficulties, and as Prentice learns to accept Kim for what she is today 
rather than what she was seventeen years ago.  In its own way, DIFFERENT 
FOR GIRLS asks many of the same questions about gender and sexuality as 
Frank Oz' IN AND OUT, and, unsurprisingly, the answers are the same.</P>
