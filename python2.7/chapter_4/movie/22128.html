<P>Buddy action movies.  I turned on 'Hooper' with Burt Reynolds the other
night, and he, along with Jan Michael Vincent, portray two stunt men who
aren't exactly close friends, but they respect each other's role in the same
profession.  The good ol' boy movies that Reynolds made famous in the 70's
affected and continue to affect action movies today.</P>
<P>No better example of this is the 'Lethal Weapon' series, which are the buddy
action genre's example of how great a formula can work if it's done
properly.  New and inventive situations eventually run out but flourish when
the ideas are fresh and well in hand.</P>
<P>Sometimes fate chooses us and not the other way around.  In 1996's 'Broken
Arrow', two air men in the military split up a long standing friendship.
One is the good guy (Christian Slater), the other (John Travolta) is the bad
guy.  Travolta's character becomes involved in a plot to steal nuclear
weapons and sell them back to the government while Slater's character tries
to stop him.  Three years later, with 'Chill Factor' we have a movie with
the same type of plot.</P>
<P>Cuba Gooding Jr. is such a great actor.  His Oscar winning role in 'Jerry
Maguire' hasn't seen him in a great role since.  Like Rod Steiger and George
Kennedy, he may suffer from the Oscar curse which plagues people with no
great role after winning the award.  In 'Chill Factor', set in Montana (but
filmed in Utah and South Carolina), Gooding Jr. plays an ice cream delivery
man named Arlo who becomes involved in a plot along with diner shop server
Tim (Skeet involved) to stop a vengeful military man named Capt. Andrew
Brynner (Peter Firth) who is looking for payback after serving a long prison
sentence and is now planning to use a deadly chemical weapon on innocent
people.</P>
<P>Sent to prison a decade earlier, blamed for letting a military experiment go
wrong, Capt. Brynner wants quick cash by holding the deadly weapon and
threatening to use it.  Shades of 1996's 'The Rock' come to mind.  Also, the
chemical that will cause the catastrophe, nicknamed Elvis, will unleash its
fury if it drops below 50 degrees.  Kind of like that bus in 1994's 'Speed'
that would explode with a bomb attached to it if it dropped below 50 miles
per hour.</P>
<P>The movie is layered with a pretty entertaining pace for a film of its kind,
probably the only thing that will save it from being a totally abysmal
failure for something done before and now seen over and over again.  Part
action, part comedy, all complete hokum, 'Chill Factor' suffers from the old
adage that the odds are not in its favour.</P>
<P>The scenery is under used in 'Chill Factor'.  A golden opportunity is wasted
to use the spectacular mountain scenery of a very visual state like Montana.
The action scenes are close up and well edited but not from a lot of
different angles you would expect to really make a movie move.  Virtually
every mode of transportation construction way is used.  There are scenes on
bridges, highways, and rivers.</P>
<P>Making his big screen debut as a director is Hugh Johnson.  His vision shows
some promise.  The characterizations in 'Chill Factor', although stereotyped
on the part of some, are clearly defined.  The film's screenplay by Drew
Gitlin and Mike Cheda is nothing more than a novelty with many plot holes.
A cell phone even works in a tunnel in this movie!!!  I also wondered while
viewing it if it was little more than a marketing tool to boost the career
of Skeet Ulrich.  He has had some small roles in a few movies and this was
perhaps an attempt to break him into the big time.  He has had noticeable
roles roles in 'The Craft', 'The Newton Boys' and 'As Good As It Gets' and
hasn't quite found the star making role he is striving for.</P>
<P>The plot holes that make 'Chill Factor' impossible to recommend are simple.
Two ordinary guys are not going to be able to stop a vicious military man
and his gang where all of them are highly trained experts in weaponry, hand
to hand combat and military strategy.  At least for many of those involved,
it won't exactly end their careers but it won't do anything to advance them
at the same time in a film that is almost impossible to review where the
ways to describe it seem to be repetitive.  The film makers drew first blood
in that category.</P>
