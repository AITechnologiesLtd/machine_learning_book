<PRE>JEEPERS CREEPERS (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
September 21st, 2001</PRE>
<P>I might give more credit than deserved but I must declare that "Jeepers
Creepers" is, despite lapses in logic and plot holes big enough to drive a semi
through, alternately chilling and frightfully good entertainment. It is a hark
back to movies like "Fright Night" and "Return of the Living Dead" where good,
scary thrills and chills, not to mention characters we care about, were central
to our enjoyment. 
The film begins in an ominous tone recalling the open roadways out in the middle
of nowhere of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." We see two kids in the car, Trish
(Gina Philips) and her younger brother, Darryl (Justin Long), leaving for spring
break from college and headed home. There is the usual banter between siblings
about former boyfriends, dirty laundry, parents and urban legends. One
particular legend is about a prom couple that died out in the same road they are
driving on - they were found minus a head and a body. Suddenly, a roaring,
tootin truck that seems to have come out of hell chases them and nearly runs
them over. The truck disappears but later, Darryl spots a cloaked figure dumping
bodybags down a silo. The upshot is that the very same truck that almost killed
them is also there. Instead of continuing on their way home, Darryl decides to
go back to the church and find if anyone is alive in those bodybags. What
happens next is often terrifying, eerie and blackly comical - almost a
horror-comedy 
but not quite. </P>
<P>"Jeepers Creepers" is sometimes uneven as it awkwardly balances itself between
humor and horror. The first half-hour, however, is great, terrifically chilling
fun since we are not sure where the movie is headed. When Darryl ends up in the
basement of the church, he finds bodies stitched together and decorating the
walls like the Sistine Chapel. We sense the killer is out there and that he
could be in the basement. The question is: what is this killer? In the credits,
he is known as the Creeper whose murderous strategy is taken from the lyrics of
the song "Jeepers Creepers." He is also able to drive a mean truck at fast
speeds and materialize from one place to another. </P>
<P>Director Victor Salva ("Powder") does a splendid job of crafting what would
normally be a poor man's Clive Barker freakshow. Salva knows how to milk
suspense out of deserted roadways, dark basements, silhouetted scarecrows, black
crows, and so on. Most of the movie is saturated in atmospheric details, a nice
respite from slasher film cliches and postmodernist winking. There is a great
moment where the Creeper assumes a scarecrow position. I also like the constant
birdcalls from the crows, a reminder that death is nearby. </P>
<P>Surprisingly, the acting by the two leads is astonishingly good. We are not
talking about prettified teens from the Freddie Prinze and Sarah Michelle Gellar
school. Gina Philips and Justin Long create credible teenagers facing an
unknowing, evil force. Their bickering, bantering moments are upstaged by
moments where they simply talk to each other, understanding and sizing each
other up. The film spends at least fifteen to twenty minutes establishing their
characters and that is a noble achievement in this day and age of soulless teen
characters who make self-reverential horror movie statements. </P>
<P>"Jeepers Creepers" would have benefitted from tighter pacing towards its
conclusion, less of a Psychic Lady character who gives away too much
information, and less of the cops who try to kill the Creeper at the police
station. I would have loved to learn more about the bodies that decorate the
walls of the church and more of the Creeper's superhuman abilities. We are
unsure of what to make of this creature nor do we know its ultimate goal. But
that is part of the fun of "Jeepers Creepers" - its vagueness supplies the
chills, especially in the final, haunting shot. Watch out for those peepers!</P>
