Capusule Review written June 21, 1999.</P>
<P>The directing debut of Anthony Drazan, "Zebrahead" captured a sizable amount 
of critical reaction upon its release in 1992, but the film is often 
overwrought, even if it is well-meaning. Set, and filmed, in Detroit, 
Michigan, white high school student Zack (Michael Rapaport) immediately falls 
for black transfer student Nikki (N'Bushe Wright), and their budding 
relationship that is not based at all on race, sets off a rally of 
controversy that soon becomes apparent is headed for violence. Rapaport and 
Wright are both outstanding in their respective, three-dimensional roles, but 
every other character is more or less a distsant caricature or symbol, aside 
from Nikki's caring, lonely mother (Candy Ann Brown). The ending is 
especially unconvincing, as it seems to switch to the end credits while still 
in midstream. </P>
