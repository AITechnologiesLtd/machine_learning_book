<PRE>                                    SPY HARD
                       A film review by Jonathan Hardison
                        Copyright 1996 Jonathan Hardison</PRE>
<PRE>RATING= * (from * to ****)</PRE>
<P>        Upon first viewing of this movie, the phrases "Been there" and 
"Done that" come quickly to mind. SPY HARD manages to steal almost every 
joke from the Zucker brothers films, the most popular of which are 
AIRPLANE and the NAKED GUN series. Stealing stuff can be profitable in 
this industry, but only when you steal the right stuff.</P>
<P>What little plot there is involves Dick Steele, aka. agent WD-40 (Leslie 
Nielsen) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played 
by Andy Griffith. Along the way to it goal (goal?), the film manages to 
spoof mainly the James Bond type films, but also manages to hit on films 
such as HOME ALONE and SISTER ACT. The trick about spoofing is that you 
have to actually be funny, or at the least, satirical. </P>
<P>SPY HARD achieves neither, as it borrows all of the wrong elements from 
the superior Zucker brothers films. The "Dick, the world is in danger. 
What is it? Well, it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the 
sun.. (I'm paraphrasing)" type of exchange is used at least four times in 
the opening ten minutes of the film, each time getting progressively less 
funny. What they should have stolen were the background sight gags which
were so effective in the Zucker Brother's films while writing their own 
dialogue. </P>
<P>Director Rick Friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors 
(especially Nielsen, who can do this quite well) than on the delivery and 
context of their lines, much of the time cutting the punchline short. The 
whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over, as is evident in 
the final sequence, where there is no comedic denouement after the 
climax. As was usual in the Zucker brothers films and in SPY HARD, the 
end credits tend to replace this by being out of context. One of the more 
amusing was, "Captain of the Enterprise......James T. Kirk". </P>
<P>Overall, I thought this was a very weak effort. While all of the right 
films to spoof were chosen, they used none of the right spoofing 
methods. Next time they should "spy" a little bit harder.</P>
<P><HR>**** = Excellent. One of a kind. Must see.
***  = Entertaining. Worth the price of admission.
**   = Fair. Nothing much special.
*    = What were they thinking??</P>
