<P>I swore I would never review this movie, but here I am.... <sigh></P>
<P>_Jurassic Park_ is a film so towering that it has managed to maintain its
emotional power over the years, despite being forced to overcome one of the
most intense commercialization campaigns in film history, as well as the
worst sequel since _Return of the Jedi_.  The tremendous worldwide success of
_Jurassic Park_ represents the pinnacle of Steven Spielberg's achievements as
a director, the film showcasing every one of his strengths and weaknesses.</P>
<P>Based on the best-seller by Michael Crichton, _Jurassic Park_ at first
appears to be part-thriller, part-morality play about the strength of life
and the failed promise of technological magic, or as a sort of updated
_Sorcerer's Apprentice_ of naive humans playing with forces beyond their ken.
It is easy to fall into the trap of seeing the dinosaurs as representing the
primal vigor of Life, as Spielberg invites us to do.  The first time we see
the dinosaurs (a moment which made tears of joy roll down this reviewer's
cheeks the first time he saw it) they are gloriously virginal in a lush
natural setting: not an artifact in sight.  The first dinosaur we are in
intimate contact with is sick, for Pete's sake!  What could be more natural?</P>
<P>Yet, in the end, this movie is not about life or dinosaurs.  Instead, it asks
the question: how can human beings live in the technological nightmare worlds
they have constructed for themselves?  There are many moments of exploration
of attitudes toward technology in the film, as when one character chortles
upon opening the amazing can of shaving foam which is really a secret storage
container for smuggling embryos (a debased version of Jurassic Park's owner's
pride in his creation), or when the leading characters argue about the import
of Jurassic Park.  Many of Ian Malcolm's criticisms of the cloning project
represent critiques of technology and science which can be found in the
writings of sociologists and philosophers of technology. The movie opens with
Grant's grousing about how he can't get along with technology.        We're all
struggling to catch up with the modern world, he observes later, with real
anguish</P>
<P>Or consider. Far more time is spent on the hazards of technology than on
pursuit by dinosaurs.  The threats to the children -- the car falling out of
the tree, the perimeter fence being turned on -- are technological threats.
Spielberg alludes to this at the beginning.  As the movie opens, we hear a
roaring and a crushing.  Expecting a dinosaur, what do we see?        A machine. A
little joke, to be sure, but a revealing one nonetheless.  The wrenching
twist from the roar of the T. Rex to Samuel L. Jackson's "Keystroke. Check."
is a marvelous clue to the nature of the world Spielberg has built. 
Educated, intelligent people are helpless before baffling or failed tech
(What!        No phones?  Help!), as helpless as when faced with a T. Rex. The plot
may be unified and fulfilled when the T. Rex nails the velociraptor as it is
about to disembowel our blue-eyed heroes, but the film's premise is shown in
the brilliant shot during the pursuit when a velociraptor, bathed in the
light of a computer monitor, suddenly appears as a collection of computer
data constructions.  The real meaning is this: the dinosaurs are a technology
too.  The film's attempt to portray them as "Life finding a way" is a shallow
distortion: they are not even real animals but biotechnological amalgamations
of frogs and dinosaurs, grotesqueries born in incubators under hot lights.</P>
<P>Of course, with Spielberg at the helm, the film follows the Hollywood formula
which Spielberg, applying in varying degree to all his movies, has brought to
its ultimate refinement: the healing of a family, the trivialization of
minorities, a lush score, technical and directorial brilliance, first-rate
acting, a redemptive ending, the focus on the obvious meaning and leadership
by the blue-eyed.  In his real-world films such as _Schindler's List_ and
_Saving Private Ryan_, this cookie-cutter perfectionism has led to great
films which are greater failures, but The Formula is well-suited to a fantasy
like _Jurassic Park_.</P>
<P>That said, _Jurassic Park_ remains a brilliant movie with moments of
delicious humor, a fast pace and excellent acting.  The reflection of the T.
Rex in the rearview mirror is a wickedly funny satire.        Laura Dern and the
young actor who plays the granddaughter both deliver especially noteworthy
performances.  The effects are magnificent. The irresistable splendor of the
dinosaurs overcomes even the predictable chase scenes and the predictable
ending. It is a film filled with wonderful shots: the birds viewed from the
window of the chopper at the end, a reminder of how dinosaurs are still with
us; Laura Dern attempting to stare down a velociraptor, every muscle in her
body straining; the moment when we first see the Brachiaosaur feeding, the
chase of the jeep (think they'll have that on the tour?) and of course, the
T. Rex emerging from the enclosure in the midst of a terrible storm, the
ultimate realization of the Frankenstein complex.</P>
<P>If there are any flaws in the film, they lie in two areas.  First, the
dinosaurs themselves do not reflect the current state of paleontonological
thinking.  The public may have accepted Bob Bakker's suspect arguments for
dinosaurs as warm-blooded, but hardly any scientists think the matter is so
cut-and-dried. Second, the "white middle-classness" of the film in which only
blacks, lawyers, fat people and other undesirables die while the blue-eyed
triumph is also highly objectionable (I live in Taiwan, where Hollywood has
successfully inculcated the belief that only blue-eyed people are real
Americans.  As a brown-eyed scion of Italian and Polish immigrants, this
infuriates me.).  There are a few minor flaws (a T. Rex can't knock over a
jeep one-twentieth of its weight?) but none really interfere with the
suspension of disbelief.</P>
<P>Not just a rental from time to time, _Jurassic Park_ is a first-rate keeper, a
classic for the ages.  This reviewer gives it 5 out of 5 and would love to see
it on the big screen again.</P>
