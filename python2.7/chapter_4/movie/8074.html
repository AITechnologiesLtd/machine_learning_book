<P>Cannes Man (1996) *** out of ***** - Cast: Seymour Cassel, Francesco Quinn.
Written by: Irwin Rappaport, Deric Haddad, Susan Shapiro, and Richard
Martini. Directed by: Richard Martini. Running Time: 90 minutes.</P>
<P>With special appearances by: Lara Flynn Boyle, James Brolin, Jon Cryer, Ann
Cusack, Johnny Depp, Robert Evans, Peter Gallagher, Menacham Golan, Dennis
Hopper, Randal Kleiser, Jim Jarmusch, Lloyd Kaufman, Julian Lennon, John
Malkovich, Chris Penn, Kevin Pollak, Jim Sheridan, Bryan Singer, Benicio Del
Toro, Harvey Weinstein, Frank Whaley, Treat Williams.</P>
<P>An odd, yet interesting concept for a low budget film. A dim-witted ex-video
store clerk becomes a courier for Troma Films and has to take promotional
materials to the infamous Cannes film festival in France. Once there, he
becomes the subject of a bet between two movie producers. One of the
producers is the "legendary" Sy Lerner (Cassel), who bets the other producer
that he can make this kid into the hottest thing at the festival before it's
over. Sy hypes the kid as Frank Rhino, the most talented screenwriter ever
born who's written the most brilliant screenplay ever written. The two then
wander around all over the festival, trying to sell their non-existant
screenplay "Con Man" (get it? Con Man? Cannes Man? It's funny!) and
pursuading stars and directors to attach themselves to the project.</P>
<P>As I said, "Cannes Man" has an ultra low budget, and all it really is is two
guys bothering celebrities at various events in Cannes. It would have been
interesting to watch the making of this film, as stars must have been
approached literally minutes before their "roles" were to be filmed.
Everyone seems to enjoy their little moments however, particularly Johnny
Depp and Jim Jarmusch who contribute the most screen time of all the
"special appearances". And it does have a few laughs sprinkled throughout.
It's an incredibly simple yet fairly entertaining film. [R]</P>
