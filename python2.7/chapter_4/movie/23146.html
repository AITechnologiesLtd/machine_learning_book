<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Call it a pity film.  Call it a last hurrah for a Hollywood legend.
Call it what you want – it's still crap.  Diamonds stars
eighty-three-year-old Kirk Douglas, and the film opens with clips of his
Oscar-nominated turn in the 1959 film Champion.  Old clips of old glory
– for both Douglas and his character.</P>
<P>Douglas was never better in Champion, which, prior to Raging Bull, was
probably the finest boxing flick around.  He was nominated for Oscars
two other times but never won. Which brings us to the perplexing
Diamonds – a film that seems specifically made to give Douglas one last
shot at winning an Oscar.  Having suffered a serious stroke in 1995,
he'd certainly have the sympathy vote.  And with the film backed by the
Miramax Oscar juggernaut – well, we know what they're capable of.  But
then the film was released.  There is still a twinkle in his eye, but
Douglas has the acting range of…well, of a guy that just had a serious
stroke.</P>
<P>Douglas plays Harry `The Polish Prince' Agensky, a former welterweight
fighter that raised himself from the depths of poverty to become the
champion of the world.  In 1994, Harry's beloved wife Ellie died, and
shortly after that he had a stroke that left him unable to speak.
Living in British Columbia with his son Moses (Kurt Fuller, Pushing
Tin), Harry is visited by his other son Lance (Dan Aykroyd, Blues
Brothers 2000) and teenage grandson Michael (Corbin Allred, Anywhere But
Here), who are en route to a vacation from San Francisco.  Thanks to
practicing daily with a videotaped speech coach, Harry is now able to
speak somewhat intelligibly.</P>
<P>Lance, an ornery, divorced newspaper columnist, is still upset over his
relationship with his dad, who was never around during his childhood.
Michael, however, instantly bonds with Harry, who explains that `a
stroke is God's way of making you shut up.'  Of course, if Harry were to
actually shut up, we would never find out about his crazy story of a
thrown fight and magic diamonds.  But no, there isn't a beanstalk – that
would have made the film entertaining.  Entertainment was obviously the
furthest thing from the minds of the filmmakers.</P>
<P>Long story short, Michael persuades Lance to let Harry come with them on
vacation.  They head for Reno, which makes no sense if you've gone to
British Columbia on the way from San Francisco.  Harry acts up, Lance
get embarrassed, and Michael shouts `Right on, Grandpa!' and `Grandpa,
you da man!' as his grandfather gets drunk, trashes hotel rooms and
punches people out.</P>
<P>There is a significant portion of the film that takes place in a
whorehouse, where characters played by Lauren Bacall (The Mirror Has Two
Faces) and Jenny McCarthy (Scream 3) are introduced.  Bacall, if you
remember, was the last victim of the whole
give-the-Oscar-to-the-faded-star-because-he/she-is-a-legend-that-has-never-won-before
syndrome (she was nominated but lost to The English Patient's Juliette
Binoche and looked extremely pissed off).  And how bad off is a film
when former Playmate McCarthy shows more range than the rest of your
actors?  But, then again, she's playing a hooker, so I'm not sure you
can even call what she's doing `acting.'</P>
<P>When Michael asks his grandpa if he is still in pain from the stroke,
Harry mumbles `frustrating,' which is just how you'll feel if you decide
to plunk down money to watch this film.  Diamonds was penned by
first-time screenwriter Allan Aaron Katz and directed by John Mallory
Asher (Kounterfeit).  The acting in the film is so bad that I actually
believe everyone was purposely horrible to make Douglas look better.</P>
<P>1:31 - PG-13 on appeal for sexual content, drug use and language</P>
