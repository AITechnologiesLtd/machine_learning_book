<P>_The_Hurricane_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        The title of _The_Hurricane_ is not only the nickname of its
main character, boxer Rubin Carter, but also an apt description of the
work of Carter's portrayer, Denzel Washington.  Forceful, dynamic, and
wholly natural, Washington's performance ranks among the very best of
his illustrious career--a turn so strong that it easily smooths over
the rough patches in Norman Jewison's fact-based drama.</P>
<P>        And there a few rough patches, especially in the early stages
of the film.  We get to know Carter by way of one Lesra Martin
(Vicellous Reon Shannon), a young American in Canada, as he reads
Carter's autobiography, _The_Sixteenth_Round_.  The book details
Carter's rise up the middleweight ranks through the moment where it
was cut short in 1966, when he and another man were wrongly convicted
of the fatal shootings of three people.  Racism played a major part in
the conviction, in particular that of one detective (Dan Hedaya) who
had been out to nail Carter since his days as a criminally-inclined
youth.  The events as depicted in the film have some basis in fact,
but the portrayal of this detective doesn't quite ring true, for he is
made into such a simplistically shady character that he appears to
have wandered in from an old silent melodrama (all he's missing is a
twirly moustache).  Similarly over-the-top initially is Shannon's
portrayal of Lesra, who originally hails from a rough American
neighborhood; Shannon lays on Lesra's straight-from-the-ghetto
mannerisms a bit too thick at the start to adequately engage one's
sympathies.</P>
<P>        That changes once the meat of _The_Hurricane_'s story kicks
into gear.  Lesra is so deeply inspired by Carter's book that he
begins a correspondence with the inmate, and Lesra convinces his
Canadian guardians (played by Deborah Kara Unger, John Hannah, and
Liev Schreiber) to help in a campaign to clear Carter's name and free
him from prison.  While the efforts to free The Hurricane is a major
issue in the film, of even greater importance is the relationship
between Carter and Lesra.  Once paired with Washington, Shannon's
awkwardness disappears, and the two successfully make their
characters' friendship into a most involving and touching heart for
the film.</P>
<P>        That is but one example of how greatly Washington elevates
_The_Hurricane_.  Although the film gets off to an imperfect start,
his charisma and rapport with the audience instantly commands the
audience's attention and emotional investment.  When the campaign to
overturn Carter's conviction takes precedence (and as such do the
three Canadians) the film threatens to become one of those "white
people save the black man" films, but Washington's intense presence
prevents that from happening.  While the Canadians do the legwork, one
never forgets that it is Carter who is in charge of his own destiny.</P>
<P>        It's easy to compliment Washington's performance strictly on
the basis of its force and focus (and how could one not, when his
commitment to the role is physically manifested by his sculpted
boxer's physique?), but what makes his work especially memorable are
his more subdued moments.  In addition to the warm scenes with Lesra,
particularly noteworthy are the couple of scenes where Carter's
internal struggles are spelled out by having Carter being torn between
two other Carters--an angry one and a weak one.  The device is a
variation of the time-worn gimmick of having and an angel on one
shoulder and a devil on another, but it is completely effective, for
Washington is able to convincingly convey all facets of Carter's
personality--a feat he also manages when just playing the singular
Carter.</P>
<P>        Washington's deft handling of the tri-Carter device is
analagous to the relationship between the actor and all of
_The_Hurricane_: while the whole undertaking is of a conventional
mold, Washington is able to make it into something more.  Granted,
Jewison, with the aid of screenwriters Armyan Bernstein and Dan
Gordon, do put enough pressure on the right emotional buttons
themselves, and Carter's true story is indeed one gripping and
inspiring enough that the film could have very well worked without
Washington.  However, one cannot imagine it working nearly as well
with someone else in the lead.  _The_Hurricane_ is not a piece of
cinematic greatness, but on Washington's mighty shoulders, it often
flirts with becoming one.</P>
