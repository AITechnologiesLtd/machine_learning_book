<P>     48 HOURS, BEVERLY HILLS COP, and LETHAL WEAPON were all, to some 
extent, reasonably entertaining action films.  The unavoidable result of 
their success has been a long string of sequels and rip-offs.  The latest 
is BAD BOYS, an overlong sample of MTV-style direction that "borrows" 
heavily from these (and numerous other) flicks, and, in the process, 
elevates them to the comparable level of CITIZEN KANE.  </P>
<P>     The action sequences--and there are a lot of them--are apparently
designed to camouflage the lack of a credible story.  I suppose someone
guessed that if the audience was too busy following bullets, bodies,
and explosions, they wouldn't have time to wonder about things like
logic and coherence.  Unfortunately, the movie contains occasional
moments of inactivity and, during those, the first thing that comes to
mind is:  What's the point?  After asking the question a few times, it
becomes clear that not only are things moving fast, but they're
completely out of control.  Consider what happens to a downhill skier
or race car in this situation, and you get an idea of what BAD BOYS has
to offer.</P>
<P>     When it came to putting ideas on paper, the writers had a beginning 
(a drug heist from the Miami P.D.'s evidence safe) and an ending (guess 
what happens to the bad guys).  They also had a premise:  take a couple 
of mismatched cops who hide their respect for each other, and team them 
with a female civilian/witness who is destined to prove her worth, but 
only after botching things a few times.  No, it's not original, but it's 
the only glue that holds this production together, even if it is spread 
far too thin.  Because outside of these few basics from script writing 
101, no thought was put into the screenplay for BAD BOYS.</P>
<P>     The cops, Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, are played by TV sitcom 
stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.  For reasons too silly to explain, 
they're forced to swap identities whenever they're with a murder witness 
(Tea Leoni).  If there ever was comic potential in this unnecessarily 
contrived situation, it's not realized.  I think THREE'S COMPANY may have 
done the same thing, only better.  Much better. </P>
<P>     Smith and Lawrence are likable, and they have a certain modest 
chemistry that surfaces during the so-called "humorous" banter, but 
everything about their characters is a regurgitation of previously 
recycled material.  (Does that make it re-recycled?)  The other 
characters are equally familiar:  the tough female sidekick, the loyal 
wife (Theresa Randle), the evil drug lord (Tcheky Karyo), and the loud-
mouthed police captain (Joe Pantoliano).</P>
<P>     The most complimentary thing I can say about BAD BOYS is that it has 
style and energy.  The cinematography is frequently inventive, and Mark 
Mancini's SPEED-like score is the perfect accompaniment for chases and 
fights.  Unfortunately, there's only so far a movie can go on loud music, 
nicely-framed shots, testosterone, and adrenaline.  BAD BOYS takes the 
often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end.  </P>
