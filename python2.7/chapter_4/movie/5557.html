<P>A film review by David N. Butterworth

<P>Demi Moore is proud of her body and, in her latest movie STRIPTEASE, it shows.</P>
<P>She has every right to be proud--this thirty-three-year-old mother of three
obviously works hard to stay in shape.  But there's little of her in
STRIPTEASE that we haven't seen before, and only hardcore Demi-lovers and
voyeurs are likely to savor this crummy piece of entertainment.  It is
sleazy and humiliating while half-heartedly attempting to present strippers
in a kinder light.</P>
<P>Moore "burns up the screen" as Erin Grant, a former FBI clerk who is forced
to work as an exotic dancer (read: stripper) in order to raise money to
appeal a custody decision that placed her seven-year-old daughter Angela
(Moore's real-life daughter Rumer Willis) with her small-time crook of a
husband (played by Robert Patrick).</P>
<P>Surely Erin could have found another job as an executive secretary.  Or
flipped burgers at McDonalds.  Or even applied for a loan!  But no.  Exotic
dancing (read: stripping) it has to be.  The money is much better--novelist
Carl Hiaasen, on whose book the film is based, claims that there are
waiting lists for these jobs--but it seems a peculiar career choice for a
single mom trying to impress a conservative judge.</P>
<P>The "action" takes place at the Eager Beaver, a topless bar (read: strip
joint) in Fort Lauderdale where Erin bumps and grinds the night away in a
variety of easy-off outfits.  One night, an intoxicated Congressman David
Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds, unashamedly gleeful in a degrading role) staggers
onto the stage where Erin is being admired a little too closely by one of
the customers.  The senator swings a champagne bottle, a flashbulb goes
off, and all of a sudden you've got more peripheral plot than you care to
deal with, with blackmail, murder and sugar cane politics fleshing out the
unfolding domestic drama.  And you just came to see Demi nekkid!</P>
<P>After last year's disastrous NC-17 SHOWGIRLS, the advance press for
STRIPTEASE made damaging comparisons.  Believing that American audiences
were not ready for another sleaze-o-rama, the publicity machine for
STRIPTEASE switched gears, suddenly promoting the film as a wacky comedy.
The film does have it's amusing moments, often involving Shad, the
nightspot's beefy bouncer (played by the appealing Ving Rhames), or
Reynolds' over-sexed Congressman Dilbeck who, with his bleached white rug
of hair, is confused for "the guy from F-TROOP" and "the guy from THE PRICE
IS RIGHT" by characters in the film.</P>
<P>These moments of humor aside, STRIPTEASE remains a choppy, schizophrenic
mess.  The tone jackknifes from tear-jerking mommy melodrama to Ace
Ventura-style slapstick and back again.  Similarly, the "dignity of
stripping" issue is clouded and confused.  On the one hand the filmmakers
want us to believe that stripping is a wholesome occupation, yet their
central character is clearly bitter about having to do this kind of
work--she wants to lead a "normal, fully-dressed life."  The deepest
observation about the objectification of women is a scene in which Erin
tells the Eager Beaver's owner that he needs to get rid of the napkins
which bear the club's logo, a sassy cartoon rodent swinging around a pole.
"It's degrading to women and to beavers," she tells him.  The endless
scenes of Moore going through her paces are more embarrassing than
degrading, but none compare to a titillating topless routine with a hair
dryer-it's somewhere between Annie Oakley and Annie Lennox.</P>
<P>Unlike her character Erin, Demi Moore has no reservations about stripping
for money ($12.5 million in this case) or having her daughter witness the
spectacle.  Moore may be proud of her stretch marks, but the top-heavy
STRIPTEASE gets a double-D for effort.</P>
