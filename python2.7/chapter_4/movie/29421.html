<P>   In the 1960's the slogan of the period was "Do your own thing,"
a maxim that in part may be responsible for the downfall in
influence of authority figures in today's society, film critics
included (for this last notion, read Raymond Haberski Jr.'s new
book "It's Only a Movie!")  Paradoxically, Chris "Izzy" Cole (Mark
Wahlberg) wants to do his own thing--which does not include
spending his life as a repairman for copy machines--but in
pushing his fantasy to be a rock musician by forming his own
band, he merely copies the gestures and songs of the band he
idolizes, Steel Dragon, rather than write his own songs and
formulate his own style.  "Rock Star," which is directed by
Stephen Herek  from a screenplay by John Stockwell, deals with
Coles's rise and fall and the ultimate finding of himself as neither
the lead singer of a prominent rock band or fixer of sick copy
machines.  But in its execution, Herek falls back on the cliches of
the genre, emphasizing a loud sound track which simply goes on
too long rather than spending some extra time developing his
characters.  What's more Mark Wahlberg does not have the
range called for in the role of a tragic hero.  Though cast in epic
roles such as this one and that of a time traveler in "Planet of the
Apes," he seems better suited to play smaller roles in indies like
his brother Donnie, who--as an example of more appropriate
casting--outshines Mark in Dan Cohen's sweetheart of a film
"Diamond Men."</P>
<P>   Though "Rock Star" has some appeal as a narrative about
musicians, it embraces a major theme as well, one which
touches on all of us. We all have fantasies of getting out of our
ruts, of standing out from the pack and gaining the adulation of
the multitude.  "Rock Star" has bad news for us, informing us that
fame and money may be cool but that we are not going to feel
happy or realized if we lose our soul in acquiring them.  This
point is punctuated by the fact that the story, though fictionalized,
is based on the experience of an Ohio office supply salesman
named Tim Owens, who once was called on to replace the head
singer in the band Judas Priest.  Actual rock musicians perform
in the nicely choreographed scenes which take place in front of
hordes of adulating crowds--fans of the music will recognize
Brian Vander Ark, Jeff Pilson, Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde
who form the ensemble of a group known as Steel Band, the very
group to which Chris Cole pays tribute in the band that he leads. 
When the lead singer of Steel Band, Bobby Beers (Jason
Flemyng), is bounced by that group's leader, Chris is flown to
L.A. to audition for Bobby's place, though it's clear that Steel
Dragon's manager (Timothy Spall) is not pleased that Chris
invited along his girl friend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).  We soon
see why, as Chris, who is hired minutes after strutting his stuff, is
inundated by groupies--attractive women who want nothing more
than to sleep with these alpha males who are adored by the
multitude.  Though Chris is at first ecstatic over his newly-found
celebrity status--supported by his loving parents and even by his
hostile brother--he comes to realize that he has sold his soul and
that he'd gladly trade it all in to be with the one woman of his
dreams, Emily.</P>
<P>   "Rock Star," then is enlightening as a parable and has
considerable entertainment value as we watch Mark Wahlberg
perform, particularly the song "Stand Up," which appears to be
the signature strain of the group for reasons that become obvious
as we watch the excitement of the crowd soar.  Wahlberg's
chemistry with the syrupy Jennifer Aniston is convincing enough.
She's the girl-back-home type that anyone with a heart would
choose over the bimbos who pack the auditoriums, follow the
cars, and live vicariously through the fame of their shallow
heroes.  The film itself tells us what we should already know--that
not only is fame fleeting, but those who gain celebrity status are
not necessarily fulfilled, considering what they have to give up of
their own humanity.  As such, there is nothing particularly
innovative about "Rock Star," which has the misfortune of
following on the heels of last year's smashing film, "Almost
Famous."</P>
