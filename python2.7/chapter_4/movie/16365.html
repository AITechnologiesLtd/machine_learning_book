<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</P>
<P>Hiring Gus Vant Sant to direct a 90's version of Alfred Hitchcock's
Psycho makes just about as much sense as hiring Pauly Shore to play
Norman Bates.  Hitchock had more than thirty years of experience in the
suspense/thriller genre before he tackled Psycho, and the result was the
work of a true genius.  Van Sant, on the other hand, has had about as
third of that with mostly drama, and his result is something much less
spectacular.  No doubt David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) or Brian De Palma
(Mission: Impossible, Snake Eyes) would probably have made a better
film, but Hitcock's mesmerizing original is not the kind of experience
that can be adequately duplicated.  The reason, of course, is that it is
no longer the 1960's!</P>
<P>Could you imagine what a scene by scene remake of The Wizard of Oz would
be like? It wouldn't work, and it wouldn't work because the era in which
it reflected has long surpassed. The 90's have been the domicile for
some smart horror films (the Scream series, the Italian gem Dellamorte
Dellamore, and a few more) and countless others drenched in sex appeal.
Psycho is not sex-crazed nor is it incredibly smart; it is a dark and
mysterious story with a clever twist at its climax.  Therefore one might
presume that Psycho in the 90's has a restricted audience, and some
horror fans will no doubt have trouble accepting that there are no shots
of Jennifer Lover Hewitt's breasts nor any fun self-satire.  The film is
old fashioned, and in the process of carefully re-creating it step by
step, Van Sant seems to have forgotten to package Pyscho for a 90's
audience, consequently missing the excitement and thrill of Hitchcock's
60's package.</P>
<P>The recent A Perfect Murder, a remake of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder,
was not a great film or even a good one - but it at least took advantage
of a modern setting.  Now that the thrill of Norman Bates' demented mind
has gone, Pyscho in the 90's loses it intrigue.  Van Sant hasn't remade
it so much as he has copied it, and the only real reason why this film
is not a total disaster is the charm and simplicity of the original,
which often shines through.</P>
<P>Working girl Marion Crane (Anne Heche) is presented with $400,000 from
her employee to deposit in a bank.  Naturally, she decides to split town
with the loot and start a new life.  When night falls and rain floods
the road ahead of her, Marion pulls off the highway and stops at the
secluded Bates Motel.  Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) runs the Motel, and
is immediately attracted to Marion, although his sick mother forbids any
relationships. Marion unpacks and takes a shower, and some unlikely
events unfold…</P>
<P>One interesting thing that I didn't notice with the original Psycho was
how heavily the film relied on Bates to make an intriguing central
character. It is then a big disappointment that Vince Vaughn is terribly
miscast.  Though he acts the part well, Vaughn is physically
inappropriate for the role, always looking far too menacing.  Instead of
portraying a mentally unstable, seemingly harmless character that
Anthony Perkins did so well in the original, Vaughn looks like a killer
from the start.</P>
<P>Those who haven't seen the original should by all means have the
opportunity to see Psycho on a big screen.   A smarter choice would have
been to clean up the original print and ship it into as many cinemas as
possible.  Grease did that in 1998, and it worked as a retrospective
look at a classic movie.  It makes no sense to keep a 60's product as
the foundation for a 90's one, even if such a movie has survived as one
of the greatest of its genre for almost forty years.  Van Sant's Psycho
manages to keep a reasonable level of suspense throughout, and as I
mentioned before, the original screenplay has too much charm and
simplicity not to let any leak through into its remake.  But lets face
it, a far superior version of Psycho has always been available in the
90's - located in the classics section of your local video store.  If
you haven't seen it, see it.  It's also probably a good choice to avoid
any future Van Sant remakes, who knows - Lawrence of Arabia might be
next.</P>
