<PRE>Pleasentville</PRE>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>I'm a font man. I love seeing the nice things I can do with the text. I like
Comic Sans MS, Garamond, Lucida Handwriting. I also like to use Subscript,
Superscript, Strikethrough, Italics, and Bold. Maybe that's why I like this
year of film so much, because it's BOLD. In a decade of cinema mediocrity,
of people unwilling to take risks outside of the independent art film world,
the studios have only recently come back to the liberal, arty and
intelligent cinema that SCREAMS at you: I'M GOOD.</P>
<P>Since the beginning of this year, we've seen risk takers coming out of the
studios: New Line's "Dark City", a sci-fi flick with a David Lynch look,
Paramount's "The Truman Show", an Orwellian look towards the future of
television, "Saving Private Ryan", a bloody portrait of what World War Two
was really like, and, now, "Pleasentville", a movie that can smile and
satire at the same time.</P>
<P>A massive allegory and satire from frame one, where we flip channels while
looking for the previews for the "Pleasentville", where everything's just
swell... on the outside. On the inside, it seems devoid of the freedoms we
hold dear.</P>
<P>Everything seems picture perfect, but then things go wrong when Jenniffer
(Renee Witherspoon) starts to mess with the order of the universe, asking
"What lies beyond Pleasentville?". When she goes further, taking someone up
to lover's lane for more than just nothing, people start turning colors from
black and white. Change is coming, and no one likes it.</P>
<P>The film, as I said, is an allegory of the late fifties and early sixties, a
political agenda "change is good" motion picture that often screams its
metaphors in your face, but in such fun ways that you can't help but smile.
It's a film for the baby boomers in all of us, the ones who think back to
that time and remember as the change was coming and coming fast, and how it
took the world by storm with a fight.</P>
<P>It's a change from the normal for me, too. A bold film that you can relax
and enjoy the complexity without having it drown you. And, unlike films like
Saving Private Ryan, which made you face the horror of the day, and The
Truman Show, which had a dismal view of the future, this one lets you smile,
lets you come out happier than you came in, and feeling more intelligent to
boot.</P>
