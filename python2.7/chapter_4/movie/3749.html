<PRE>                                 POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     While it may not be as classic as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and while
it may not earn as much as THE LION KING, Disney's 33rd full-length
animated feature, POCAHONTAS, is an intelligent film that is
entertaining for all ages.</P>
<P>     Set in 1607, the story centers around two historical figures,
Pocahontas and Captain John Smith.  Much like Romeo and Juliet,
Pocahontas and Smith are from completely different cultures that will
not accept each other, yet they find what is common to all people,
love.  Through them, the Indians and the English colonists overcome
their hatred for each other and learn to live in peace.</P>
<P>     While it plays a little hard and fast with the facts, Pocahontas
is a captivating romantic adventure story with a level of
sophistication that will keep the adults as fascinated as the kids.  As
you would expect from Disney, the animation is first rate.  The colors
have a soft, subdued look that is reminiscent of some of Disney's older
classics and the detail in the character's faces brings animated
"acting" to a new level.  Mel Gibson supplies the voice of John Smith
and even sings a couple of songs (that marvel alone is worth the price
of admission).  Irene Bedard provides the voice of Pocahontas while
Judy Kuhn does the singing.</P>
<P>     The score by Alan Menken and songs by Menken and Stephen Schwartz
are not quite as memorable as some of the hits from other recent Disney
extravaganzas but they are still first rate.</P>
<P>     Wrapped inside an entertaining shell, POCHAHONTAS deals with the
importance of following your heart and respecting others.  Good lessons
for adults as well as children.  Bob Dole would approve.</P>
