<P>Imagine Dickens with a lush soundtrack and with the surroundings bathed in
a rosy glow, and you have the feel of Lasse Hallstrom's film "The Cider
House Rules," a rather disconcerting adaptation of John Irving's novel.
While the effect is pleasant to watch, it doesn't really say anything of
consequence--odd, because the novel had plenty to say, and Irving himself
adapted the novel for the screen. The result is a competent but not
particularly memorable film.</P>
<P>The setting is Maine between the world wars. Tobey Maguire stars as one
Homer Wells, an orphan born and raised at St. Cloud's, which doubles as
orphanage and abortion clinic, the latter covertly, of course. Michael
Caine is Dr. Larch, the compassionate doctor who runs St. Cloud's,
performing abortions and delivering babies as necessary, and supervising
the various waifs under his care. Dr. Larch takes Homer on as his
assistant, and Homer gets a thorough medical education without ever going
to high school--but, don't you know, he longs to Get Out And See The
World, and when Candy (Charlize Theron) comes to St. Cloud's for an
abortion, with boyfriend Wally (Paul Rudd) in tow, Homer, rejecting Dr.
Larch's entreaties to stay at St. Cloud's, hitches a ride to the coast
with them and takes up apple-picking in Candy's family orchard alongside a
set of poor black migrant workers. Homer discovers along the way that Dr.
Larch's ethics had more of an effect on him than he realizes, though, and
complications ensue. If it sounds confusing, trust me, it's not. You can
doze off for long stretches and still follow the story perfectly well.</P>
<P>Among the prevailing themes in the book was abortion, since that's the
heart of the conflict between Homer and Dr. Larch--Homer won't perform
abortions, Dr. Larch will. It's implicit that abortion is at the heart of
Homer leaving the orphanage, since succeeding Dr. Larch as head physician
implies taking over his abortion duties as well. But while the abortion
issue in the book was polemical--Irving was very clearly taking a side,
namely pro- abortion--it just seems pat here; the conflict is resolved, if
that's the way to put it, in a way that seems firmly within the stock
arguments of the abortion debate, and it's unlikely that this film's
treatment of the problem will add anything to that debate. Granted, it's
hard to imagine a film that could change anyone's mind on this particular
issue, but this doesn't feel like a particularly thoughtful consideration.
The book uses the larger theme of rules and the necessity of rule-breaking
to set up its abortion argument--the "rules" of the title are a set of
directives posted in the orchard's bunkhouse, universally ignored--but the
book also had the luxury of several additional minor characters and quite
a few more events to make that argument. The film's treatment of the
subject, by contrast, intermittently appears and then leaves again for
long stretches, and thematically the whole thing wanders.</P>
<P>Part of the problem is Maguire. He has a winning smile, but not much more,
and he's not particularly good at conveying anything other than
indecision. That's not necessarily a handicap for some parts, but Irving's
protagonists are all written blandly, straight men for the various zany
and peculiar events and characters around them, and hence they need actors
with vibrant personalities to play them. Maguire, alas, has very little
personality, and what he has doesn't exactly seem principle-driven and
resolute. Because of that, then, Homer's moral odyssey is fairly
unconvincing--we don't really buy it; the convictions never seemed all
that deeply held anyway. (His face, which is almost entirely
expressionless, doesn't help his cause.) The problem is exacerbated by
Caine's vivid performance as Dr. Larch, since Caine seems genuinely
animated by his convictions--and with the character on one side of the
debate ablaze with moral certitute and the other simply saying his lines,
the eventual result feels like a bit of a foregone conclusion. Maguire
isn't bad, by any means, but he underplays all his most important moments,
including one crucial scene where he's supposed to be burning with
indignation but in fact sounds no more than mildly annoyed. Raise that
voice, Tobey! Chew some scenery! Wake *up*! Theron, for her part, has very
little to do besides be attractive, and Delroy Lindo, as one of the
orchard workers, is nicely expressive--but the story revolves around
Maguire.</P>
<P>A movie that spends as much time as this one does in and around an
orphanage has inherent sentimentality risks, and Hallstrom doesn't do
enough to stave off that element. A subplot involving a boy (named Fuzzy,
of all things) who's permanently confined in a breathing tube and watches
people wistfully through the plastic--no points for picking up on the
Poignant Metaphor here--gets far too much attention in light of its
minimal role in the story. Even the orchard scenes, which are presumably
meant to represent a grittier side of life, look too much like a New
England postcard to feel all that real. There's an irony here, since
anyone who's read Irving's novels knows that there's nothing even vaguely
sentimental about them--the characters are drawn with an unsparing eye,
and their faults and foibles are always on display. Without Irving's prose
to keep the comic tone going, though, the movie alternates between sweet
and ponderous, neither of which is a particularly Irvingish quality. The
problem might have been avoided had the script not eliminated a certain
character, a girl at the orphanage who left it to find Homer; Melony, as
she was called, was far too earthy to sentimentalize, and she served as a
foil of sorts. As it is, there's very little dramatic tension in the film,
except at a few key points. (There's another irony here, of course, namely
that the sentimentality doesn't seem to affect Maguire--he may be
surrounded by heart- tugging orphans, but his heart doesn't seem to be
tugged.) The soundtrack, sometimes appropriate but often intrusive,
heightens the melodramatic feel.</P>
<P>All that said, though, there are things to like about Cider House Rules.
Prominent among them is a marvelous performance by Caine, justly nominated
for an Oscar; he conveys the fatherly instincts that he has for Homer
without ever seeming mawkish. There's a back-and-forth letter-writing
scene between him and Homer done by voice-over that's particularly
resonant, arguably more so than any of the scenes where the two are
actually together--perhaps it's because Maguire is more effective as
voice-over (his voice has more expression than his face) than actually on
screen, but the dialogue crackles in that scene more than at any other
point in the film. Caine, who's British, adopts a New England accent
almost perfectly, and combines waspishness (toward those who don't
understand his mission) with affection (for the orphans) in a rather
nuanced way. Moreover, there's a subtheme about maturity as measured in
the ability to make decisions that's actually rather well done: Candy's
immaturity is indicated by her inability to make decisions, and Homer
eventually learns that growing up means having to make hard choices.</P>
<P>Still, the heart of this film, for better or worse, is Maguire's
character, and Maguire doesn't really carry off the part. It's not a bad
effort, but it works better as an attractive spectacle than as an actual
story.</P>
