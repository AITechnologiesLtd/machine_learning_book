<PRE>                              LA CEREMONIE 
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Claude Chabrol's new thriller is not
          actually very thrilling.  It has a nice slow and
          believable build to its climax, but the climax is
          curiously understated and unaffecting.  Chabrol
          would probably like to have made a strong statement
          about class warfare, but his main character is much
          more understandable than sympathetic.  There is not
          much in LA CEREMONIE to fire the blood of the
          viewer and the low-key direction eventually robs
          the film of impact.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4) The
          spoiler section following the review contains what
          could conceivably be a fair-sized spoiler, so
          beware.
          New York Critics: 15 positive, 1 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Director Claude Chabrol's work has in fact been compared
frequently to that of Alfred Hitchcock, but he lacks the British
director's efficiency and compactness of story-telling.  Take away a
few subtle implications of quiet class warfare and this is a story that
could have been done every bit as effectively as a half-hour episode on
ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS in the late 1950s.  Given the screentime of
LA CEREMONIE, Hitchcock could have told a story by wide margins both
more thoughtful and more entertaining.</P>
<P>     The setting is a small but modern village on the northwest coast
of France.  Sophie (Sandrine Bonnaire) is a mysterious woman who hires
herself out as a maid to an upper-middle-class family.  Her employers
are the bland Catherine and Georges Lelievre (Jacqueline Bisset and
Jean Pierre Cassel).  Given their personalities, Sophie is
understandably very standoffish with her new employers.  She seems to
prefer retreating to the solitude of her room to having any beyond the
required contact with the Lelievres.  Instead she watches the
television. What nobody realizes is that Sophie has a rather surprising
secret, one that she protects with surprising dexterity.  The little
human contact she does make is instead with Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert)
the clerk at the village post office whose mild if slightly surly
demeanor hides a lot of rage for the more wealthy around her.  This is
a French film, but it fits well with the new American stereotype that
post office workers have an insidious side.  Sophie and Jeanne share a
common distaste for life in the village in general and of the Lelievres
in specific.  Chabrol hints at more than friendship and the beginnings
of a physical relationship between the two. Each finds the other a
sounding board for her rage and together they just might do the
unthinkable things that they never would do without each other.</P>
<P>     Basing the film on the novel A JUDGMENT IN STONE by Ruth Rendall,
Chabrol very slowly and deliberately paces the film though not really
adding a lot to the depth of his characters.  We see a good deal of
Georges and Catherine, but we never get to know very much about them
except that they are most comfortable with each other and with their
two children.  They have a hard time being very warm toward an intruder
in their house, even if the intruder has been hired by them.  While
they seem to be favored with wealth, their attitudes toward others
outside the family is stand-offish and self-absorbed at best.  Chabrol
takes a few cheap shots at the family and their class.  At one point
Jeanne is faced with having Sophie as a house guest for an extended
period of time.  She has lived comfortably on her post office salary
but with a second mouth to feed she comments that it will be hard for
them to eat.  Chabrol immediately cuts to the Lelievres eating a
somewhat fancy meal.</P>
<P>     In the final analysis, this is really not a lot deeper or more
impressive a film than various American films in which the hired hand
turns out to be more than a handful.  While the conflict is not as
one-sided as that in films like THE TEMP and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE
CRADLE, LA CEREMONIE is really not far from that genre.  The
denouement, when it comes, has a few logic problems.  This film has
done well by the critics, but it is seems to have its problems.  I rate
it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     SPOILER... SPOILER... SPOILER... SPOILER... SPOILER... SPOILER...
SPOILER... SPOILER...</P>
<P>     If the recorder was running all evening, recording the opera,
would the family have been talking over the opera, essentially ruining
the recording?  At what point did the recorder come off record mode
with the people present not realizing it?</P>
