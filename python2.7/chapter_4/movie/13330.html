<P>After a brief prologue, "Saving Private Ryan" goes straight into the 
battle scene to end all battle scenes, a 24 minute recreation of the D-
Day landing at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. The images are absolutely 
brutal, showing in explicit detail the massacre of countless soldiers as 
the Allied Forces storm the beach. "What the hell do we do now sir?" 
shouts one private, while others strip ammunition and weapons off dying 
comrades. One soldier scoops his severed arm off the sand, staggering on 
in a desperate attempt to keep up with his squad. As young bodies explode 
from enemy fire, the Allied Forces still somehow sweep forward, through 
the noise, confusion, and death all around them. Watching the unspeakable 
carnage, you wonder how any of the soldiers could possibly have survived 
the battle, let alone triumphed. </P>
<P>That's just the beginning of one of the most powerful, visceral war 
movies ever made. Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is an 
experience that left me shaken and deeply moved. Even though the screen 
is filled with the faces of familiar actors, Spielberg makes it seem real,
 thrusting the viewer right into the center of the nightmarish action. 
Hand-held cameras create a quasi-documentary feel. Occasionally the sound 
fades out and the action shifts into slow motion, giving you the eerie 
sense of sharing the experience of a soldier in shock. The film is 
remarkably effective at creating a horrific "you-are-there" feel.</P>
<P>The brilliant "Apocalypse Now" used war as a vehicle for a surreal 
journey into the depths of insanity. The battlefields of "Platoon" served 
as the landscape for a morality play, with the forces of good and evil 
vying for the soul of a young soldier. "Saving Private Ryan" is about war,
 period. The film stays focused on what war does to the body and soul, as 
the men fight to stay alive, to accomplish their mission, and to somehow 
retain their humanity during a situation that screams for them to just be 
animals. </P>
<P>Only after the staggering extended battle sequence does Spielberg 
introduce you to the characters and story. Still reeling from Omaha Beach,
 Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is given another assignment. Within days,
 three of the four Ryan brothers have been killed in action. The youngest,
 Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), is alive somewhere behind enemy lines. 
Miller is to take his squad to find and retrieve the soldier. </P>
<P>The film accompanies the men on their harrowing search, as they 
increasingly question their mission. While they understand the reasoning 
behind the assignment, they also see the cold reality. In order to soften 
the terrible blow for Mother Ryan, the military is putting their eight 
lives at great risk. Is the compassionate gesture worth the potential 
body count?</P>
<P>As they travel, we see the dynamics of the squad. Captain Miller is a 
strong, down-to-earth, but cryptic leader. Even the men closest to him 
don't know what he does for a living in the civilian world. Private 
Reiben (Edward Burns) is an outspoken New Yorker who doesn't hide his 
resentment over the mission. Giovanni Ribisi plays Wade, the empathic, 
skilled medic, while Jeremy Davies is Corporal Upham, a timid young man 
"drafted" to replace the squad's slain interpreter. Having never 
experienced combat first-hand, Upham is the fish-out-of-water who serves 
as a sort-of representative for the audience.</P>
<P>It's a strong cast. Ribisi, who plays Phoebe's brother on "Friends," 
leaves a lasting impression as the dedicated medic, and Davies is also 
memorable, although the "Going All The Way" actor needs to widen the type 
of roles he plays, lest he find himself forever typecast as a skittish 
introvert. As Private Ryan, Matt Damon nicely fleshes out his character 
despite his relatively limited screen time. And the remarkable Tom Hanks 
delivers yet another outstanding performance, making Captain Miller a man 
instead of an icon. Don't be surprised if he gets another Best Actor 
nomination next spring.</P>
<P>Steven Spielberg films are often heavy-handed, but he displays great 
restraint here. The harrowing war scenes never feel like directoral 
grandstanding, and the sentimental moments are heart-wrenching without 
becoming drippy. Similarly, John Williams' haunting score beautifully 
accents the film, a welcome change after his overly manipulative turn in 
"Amistad." I suspect both men were tempted to lay things on a little 
thicker. Thank goodness they held themselves back from emotionally 
bullying the audience.</P>
<P>A crowning cinematic achievement, "Saving Private Ryan" doesn't 
romanticize or condemn World War II. It is far more effective by 
presenting war with simple, stark honesty. Spielberg told the Los Angeles 
Times that he made the film for the men who survived, as well as those 
who perished. "It is to honor them with the truth and to hopefully teach 
something," he said. "Audiences today go to the movies, and they are 
often thrilled by violence. This is intended to show the other side of 
what violence does to human beings." </P>
<PRE>He achieved his goal.</PRE>
