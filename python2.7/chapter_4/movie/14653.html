LOVE IS THE DEVIL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>The marvelous British actor Derek Jacobi stars in writer and director
John Maybury's LOVE IS THE DEVIL about the popular modern artist Francis
Bacon.  As always, Jacobi's acting is impeccable, but the movie tries
hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque.</P>
<P>The movie convincingly argues that Francis, played by Jacobi, was a
completely despicable and vain individual, but it never provides any
insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude.  When
interviewed by a fawning talk show host, Francis calls his style "chance
brushstrokes."</P>
<P>Starting with a burglary of Francis's flat, the film uses loud sound
effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie.  The
camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle
close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections.
The director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the
substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a
lonely and vain man.</P>
<P>Daniel Craig, in a lifeless performance, plays the burglar and boxer,
George Dyer.  When Francis lays eyes on him after the break-in, Francis
promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex.  He stays for the
entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed.  He
thinks that Francis's paintings have "no bloody use," and the movie
presents no counterargument.</P>
<P>Writer Maybury barely outlines Francis's character, and George and the
rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma.   We learn little
of George other than Francis's reason for liking him -- George's
"amorality and innocence."</P>
<P>Francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often.  "Boxing is
such a marvelous aperitif for sex," he reflects to George on the way to
watch a boxing match.  As the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy
blow, the camera cuts to a gleeful Francis whose own head is soaked by
the flying blood.  Francis appears to be in complete ecstasy.</P>
<P>Another of Francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of
atrocities.  As the carnage mounts, we witness an orgasmically happy
Francis in the audience.</P>
<P>In a film that tries obsessively to shock, one dream sequence portrays a
family in a car accident.  Francis's mind slowly examines every bloody
limb of the mother, the father, and the boy.</P>
<P>Sometimes the script throws us tidbits of Francis's wisdom which
illuminate little while merely sounding insightful.  ("I'm optimistic by
nature.  I'm optimistic about nothing."  "Loneliness is my only true
companion.")</P>
<P>We learn more details about Francis's makeup techniques than about the
man himself.  He prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning
powder for his teeth.</P>
<P>Full of metaphorical interpretations, the film's best scene occurs late
one night when George has to get up to go to the bathroom.  Mistaking
Francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article, he urinates on it
and then crawls back into bed contentedly.</P>
<P>Like a parody of a bad art house movie, LOVE IS THE DEVIL has horrid
characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much
more interested in technique than storytelling.  By the end, the
audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute
sketch.</P>
<P>LOVE IS THE DEVIL runs 1:30.  The film is not rated but should be
considered NC-17 for violence, profanity, graphic sex, nudity and
sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers.</P>
