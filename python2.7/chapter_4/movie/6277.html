<P>     In LOOKING FOR RICHARD, actor/director Al Pacino expressed his 
greatest hope for the film -- that he could extend his enthusiasm for 
the Bard's plays to a broader audience.  In a very different way, that's 
what Baz Luhrmann (STRICTLY BALLROOM) is attempting to do with this 
radical approach to "Romeo and Juliet".  Luhrmann hasn't fashioned this 
motion picture with the stodgy, elitist Shakespeare "purist" in mind.  
Instead, by incorporating lively, modern imagery with a throbbing rock 
soundtrack and hip actors, he has taken aim at an audience that would 
normally regard Shakespeare as a chore to be endured in school, not a 
passionate drama to ignite the screen.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake, this ROMEO AND JULIET isn't the match of Franco 
Zeffirelli's unforgettable 1968 classic.  While Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Claire Danes make an effective couple, their romance doesn't burn with 
the white-hot intensity of Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey's.  
Nevertheless, this interpretation is so fundamentally different from 
anything to have come before it that there's no danger of repetition.  
By the same token, there have been two different "Richard III"s in the 
past twelve months, and no one is complaining.</P>
<P>     For those who aren't aware, "Romeo and Juliet" tells the tale of 
two "star-cross'd" teenage lovers who secretly fall for each other and 
marry.  Their families, the Montagues and Capulets, have been fierce 
enemies for decades, and, even as Romeo and Juliet say their wedding 
vows, new violence breaks out between the clans.  In the end, their love 
is doomed.  When Romeo mistakenly believes Juliet is dead, he poisons 
himself.  And, when Juliet discovers that he is dead, she too commits 
suicide.</P>
<P>     Luhrmann's ROMEO AND JULIET (properly titled WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S 
ROMEO AND JULIET) takes the play and deposits it in a modern Verona 
Beach that is part decaying Miami and part Mexico City.  By the 
director's own admission, this is a created world, borrowing aspects of 
its unique visual style from such diverse periods as the 1940s, 1970s, 
and 1990s, and using a variety of classic films (most notably REBEL 
WITHOUT A CAUSE) for inspiration.  Fast cars with roaring engines 
replace horses.  Guns stand in for swords and daggers.  The resulting 
hybrid background is startling.</P>
<P>     ROMEO AND JULIET's camera is restless, always moving.  There are 
times when the rapid cuts and raging soundtrack might cause 
understandable confusion between the movie and a rock video.  Indeed, 
with all the camera tricks, special effects (such as a roiling storm), 
and riotous splashes of color, it's easy to lose the story in the style.  
Luhrmann's intent was never to drown Shakespeare's dialogue in 
technique, but it happens, especially early in the film.  In the 
process, the more subtle intangibles of the romance are irretrievably 
lost.</P>
<P>     The movie settles down when Romeo (DiCaprio) and Juliet (Danes) 
first come face-to-face, gazing at each other through the transparent 
panes of an aquarium while a love ballad plays in the background.  It's 
a delicately romantic moment whose magic is never quite matched by any 
other scene in the film.  Danes makes a breathtaking Juliet, merging 
strength and fragility into one.  DiCaprio isn't quite as successful as 
Romeo; there are times when his delivery of Shakespeare's dialogue 
sounds forced, and, on at least one occasion (when he learns about 
Juliet's supposed death), he goes way over-the-top.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast has its share of successes and failures.  John 
Leguizamo plays a particularly effective Tybalt, Juliet's Latino cousin.  
Despite a terrible accent, Miriam Margolyes gives a delightful 
interpretation of Juliet's nurse.  In a daring move that works, Harold 
Perrineau's Mercutio is presented as a high-energy drag queen who gets a 
chance to strut his stuff to a disco tune with Shakespearean lyrics.  
Pete Postlethwaite (as Father Laurence) and Vondie Curtis-Hall (Captain 
Prince) are both at ease in their roles.  Brian Dennehy's presence is, 
as always, imposing, but, as Lord Montague, he doesn't have more than a 
handful of lines.  Less successful are Paul Sorvino's cartoon-like 
portrayal of Lord Capulet and Diane Verona's Blanche DuBois-flavored 
version of his wife.  And a pair of characters, Paul Rudd's Paris and 
Jesse Bradford's Balthasar, are so ineffectual that they're virtually 
invisible.</P>
<P>     There are moments of comedy in Shakespeare's play, and Luhrmann 
tries to transfer some of these over, in addition to adding a few of his 
own.  One in particular, with Romeo ineptly scaling a trellis for the 
famous balcony sequence, is ill-placed.  Also, there are times when the 
director gets a little too cute.  A run-down theater in Verona is called 
"The Globe" (the name of the locale where Shakespeare's plays were 
originally performed), and the astute viewer will catch visual 
references to "The Merchant of Verona Beach", "Rozencranzky's", 
"Wherefore L'Amour", and "Out, Out Damn Spot Cleaners".</P>
<P>     Ultimately, no matter how many innovative and unconventional 
flourishes it applies, the success of any adaptation of a Shakespeare 
play is determined by two factors:  the competence of the director and 
the ability of the main cast members.  Luhrmann, Danes, and DiCaprio 
place this ROMEO AND JULIET in capable hands.  And, while such a loud, 
brash interpretation may not go down in cinematic history as the 
definitive version of the play, hopefully it will open a few eyes and 
widen the audience willing to venture into any movie bearing the credit 
"based on the play by William Shakespeare."</P>
<P>     Now, bring on Kenneth Branagh's HAMLET...</P>
