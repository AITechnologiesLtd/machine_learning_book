<PRE>                         THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A tale of adventure and love in the time of
     cholera.  An Italian revolutionary and a beautiful and
     wealthy French woman, each with a mission, repeatedly
     encounter and help each other in 1832 France.  Jean-Paul
     Rappeneau gives us a high-spirited, yet solid historical
     adventure that excites but never goes over the top into
     swashbuckling.  Beautifully filmed and nicely acted.
     Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>     It is 1832 and the threat of Napoleon is over.  Still Italy knows
no peace.  Twelve years earlier, inspired by a revolt in Spain, the
Neapolitans arose and forced King Ferdinand I to give the country a
constitution.  A congress of European governments, meeting at Troppau
and Laibach, decided it must discourage all such revolutions, which
might, after all, spread to other countries.  The Congress gave Austria
a mandate to march into Italy and to restore things to the way they had
been before the constitution.  Their rule was marred by uprisings, not
surprisingly, including a 1821 Piedmont revolution put down in less
than a month by forces of royalists and Austrians.  The 1831 uprisings
in Modena and Parma met a similar fate.  But uprisings against the
royalist government and especially the invading Austrians continue.
Many ranking officers in the various rebellions find things a bit hot
for them in Italy and find sanctuary in France.  They were also finding
support from like-minded Frenchmen, disillusioned with their own king
Louis Philippe.  He had been chosen as King in part for his liberal
viewpoints.  The reality disappointed the people, however, after the
new king had ruthlessly put down a workers rebellion in Lyon the
previous year.</P>
<P>     Angelo Pardi (played by Olivier Martinez), an officer in the
Revolutionary Army, is in France with gold collected there that will
help finance revolution ... if he can get it back to his country
intact.  Austrian agents are also in France, hunting down the enemies
of the Italian royalist government.  The French are generally
sympathetic, but just now they have an even more frightening and
implacable enemy.  One that can strike at anyone, highborn or commoner
equally.  An epidemic of cholera haunts the land.  And making the
situation even more dangerous, the people hold any number of strange
ideas of what causes and what prevents the disease.  Any stranger might
be accused of being a well-poisoner and hung by angry mobs anxious to
do anything that has any chance of protecting them from the disease.
Pardi faces a double threat from the Austrians specifically looking for
him and from the French who in their ignorance are looking to kill any
strangers who may possibly be visiting this disease on them.  On the
run Pardi finds himself in the house of a beautiful aristocrat Pauline
de Theu (Juliette Binoche).  She hides him and helps him, little
knowing that their paths would cross again multiple times.  A good deal
of what makes this film engrossing is its view of the medicine of the
period.  While that is not the primary focus of the story, it figures
heavily in the plot, not unlike RESTORATION earlier this year.</P>
<P>     Jean-Paul Rappeneau, who five years ago gave us his terrific
adaptation of CYRANO DE BERGERAC gives us another delightful historical
excursion, beautifully acted and photographed.  Like CYRANO, HORSEMAN
has a clever wit that shows itself at odd and unexpected moments.
There are a few enjoyable digs at the aristocracy of France.  One
particularly enjoyable scene involves the reactions at a dinner party
to Pauline's recent past.  It should be noted that this film takes
place in a France that the previous year had produced the novel NOTRE
DAME DE PARIS (bearing little similarity to an animated film to be
based on it near the end of the next century) and the film even makes
some mention of Victor Hugo.  The cast will be mostly unfamiliar to
American audiences, though Juliette Binoche will be familiar for roles
in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING and BLUE.  Binoche has the sort of
exquisite demure beauty that seems to be a staple of French films.
However her role rarely calls for her to show much versatility.
Martinez is moderately the more interesting of the two actors lead
actors, but perhaps because his role is better written.  There is also
a small role for Gerard Depardieu who also does not get a chance to
show much range.  Martinez has the greatest opportunity to act except
for a sequence for Binoche toward the end of the film.</P>
<P>     With the exception of a modest resurrection of the Western it has
become very rare to see American films set prior to World War II.  Most
serious historical films these days are coming from Europe.  The same
Hollywood that made great films like QUEEN CHRISTINA and THE SCARLET
EMPRESS back in the 1930s now seems to shy away from historical
settings, perhaps for fear of lack of interest.  In any case, for those
with no fear of subtitles, this may well be the most rewarding film of
the summer.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
