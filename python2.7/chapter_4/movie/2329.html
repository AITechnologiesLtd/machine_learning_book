<PRE>                              FARAWAY, SO CLOSE!
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Otto Sander, Horst Buccholz, Nastassja Kinski, Bruno
Ganz, Willem Dafoe, Peter Falk.
Screenplay:  Wim Wenders, Ulrich Zieger & Richard Reitiger.
Director:  Wim Wenders.</P>
<P>     Wim Wenders' WINGS OF DESIRE was one of my favorite films of
1988.  As corny as it might sound, I found it to be one of those rare
transcendental film experiences, a beautiful and poetic tale of love
and human wonder that left me feeling uplifted.  I was unsure of how to
approach the idea that Wenders was making a sequel to this singular
film, but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  Unfortunately,
all the good will in the world was unable to salvage FARAWAY, SO
CLOSE!  Wenders seems to have been unclear as to what made WINGS OF
DESIRE special, weighing down a simple story with self-importance and a
ridiculously convoluted plot.</P>
<P>     FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! returns Otto Sander to the role of Cassiel, one
of many angels who drift through Berlin observing and listening in on
thoughts.  He is curious about the human experience, but reluctant to
take the plunge risked by his former companion Damiel (Bruno Ganz).
The decision is made for him when he becomes human to save the life of
a young girl.  Cassiel resolves to use his physical form to intervene
for good where he was unable to do so before, but that resolution
proves easier said than done.  He falls into despair and loneliness,
eventually coming to work for a suave black marketeer (Horst
Buchholz).  Cassiel struggles to redeem himself, all the while thwarted
by a mysterious figure named Emit Flesti (Willem Dafoe).</P>
<P>     Like WINGS OF DESIRE, FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! shows us the angels'
world in black and white, and opens with loosely connected scenes of
the angels smiling knowingly over human shoulders as they work and
worry.  But unless my memory fails me, those scenes go on far longer in
FARAWAY, and they become extremely tedious.  They include a cameo by
Mikhail Gorbachev, thinking important thoughts about world peace, and a
scene involving a dying man and an angel played by Nastassja Kinski
where the overlapping dialogue created a nightmare for the subtitler.
This prologue seemed to go on and on, and while it did provide
information necessary later in the story, it could have been done much
more efficiently.  There are too many characters, many of whom are
completely irrelevant to the story.</P>
<P>     The film's second act is by far its most effective.  The
reluctantly human Cassiel copes poorly with his new state, lacking the
love which motivated Damiel's transformation.  The marvelously
expressive Sander is great during these scenes, drifting into drunken
despondency with genuine pain.  Also intriguing is the relationship
between Cassiel and Tony Baker, the German-born/ American-raised
racketeer who takes him in.  Horst Buchholz has an oily charm as Baker,
and there's a lively cadence to his perpetual switching back and forth
between German and English.  Cassiel is most interesting when he's a
fallen angel, with Baker the little devil on his shoulder.</P>
<P>     Then, during the climax, it all falls apart again.  Willem Dafoe,
who as Emit Flesti ("time itself" backwards ... get it?) wanders
through the film making ominous but opaque statements like, "Time is
the absence of money," becomes thoroughly oppressive in the final half
hour.  FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! becomes a silly caper film involving stolen
arms and kidnapping.  Peter Falk, who was so good in WINGS OF DESIRE as
Damiel's guide to humanity, is simply comic relief here, although a
scene involving the distraction of two security guards is very funny.
WINGS OF DESIRE was whimsical, but never dopey, and FARAWAY has a real
problem finding its tone.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most egregious sin in FARAWAY is a preachy epilogue
that seems only tangentially connected to the film we just spent two
and a half hours watching.  WINGS OF DESIRE was a kind of message film,
but the message was skillfully delivered; in the intervening five
years, Wenders seems to have had all the subtlety sucked out of him.
The moments that do work in FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! are mired in
overplotting, and there's never any flow to the story.  What's worse,
it has tainted my memories of WINGS OF DESIRE.</P>
<PRE>     I think I need to rent it tonight.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fallen angels:  4.</PRE>
