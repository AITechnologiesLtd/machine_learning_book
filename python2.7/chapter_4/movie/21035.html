<P>Accompanied by THE BEST MAN director Malcolm Lee, I spoke with Diggs at
the Pan-Pacific Hotel in San Francisco about his relatively recent
venture into the world of film.  He reflected on his roller coaster ride
to success from his roots as a stage actor at Syracuse University and on
to Broadway where he starred in "Rent" and "Carousel."  He told the
story behind his debut performance in HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK and
reflected upon his status as a budding sex symbol.  Through it all he
spoke with an amazing sense of candor and striking humility.  Those same
sincere emotions that he puts into his characters are reflected in his
cerebral persona, which directors and fans like myself have come to
revere.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: In the opening paragraph of a recent New York Times
piece they compared you to Fred Astaire in reference to your history
with theater and your gradual transition to film.  How do you respond to
that statement and how do you feel about the state of modern movies?</P>
<P>Diggs: I would love for film to go back to those days where you had to
be able to do everything just to get by. In the forties, fifties, and
sixties they were good singers, good actors, and good dancers. That's
the school that I come from.  I would love for film to go back to that
but nowadays it's too difficult because there's a whole "cheese factor"
involved.  You see someone who sings and you need to know whether or not
they are going to have the mass appeal when they cross over.  I think
that people were just more talented and well-rounded in the past because
they had to be.  Back then the studios had crafted stars like Judy
Garland.  You just don't see the same type of all-purpose entertainers
nowadays.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: You have done a lot of theater acting, both "Rent" and
"Carousel" on Broadway. Do you plan to return to that?</P>
<P>Diggs: Yes.  Actually from this point on until April I'm going to be
working on a show called "The Wild Card" in New York City at the
Manhattan Theater Club. It's a brand new piece taken from a poem.  I
jump at any chance to go back into theater.  That's what acting is to
me.  That's where I learned my craft.  Whenever I do acting for film
there's always a certain amount of altering I have to do to my style
because it's so different.  I'm always up for going back to the stage.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Have you done any stage since your first film HOW STELLA
GOT HER GROOVE BACK in 1997?</P>
<P>Diggs: No.  That was two years ago and I've been extremely busy ever
since. It's been quite a whirlwind.  The only reason I say two years is
because someone else told me.  It's all been a big blur.  Just a
different person shouting cut on a different day.  On the set I never
know what day of the week it is. It's been really crazy.  I welcome it
though.  This is what we all said that we wanted to do when we were in
college and now it has come to fruition.  It's very exciting and
challenging.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: It always seems like in your movies that you're taking
your clothes off. I'm sure you get asked about that a lot.  Is that just
part of the characters or do they add it because of your status as a
rising sex symbol?</P>
<P>Diggs: They've never added that after I've come on to a film.  Not one
role that I've played has been written specifically for me.  It's just
been the role of the romantic lead.  Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are always
taking off their shirts.  That's just what you do.  You have to have sex
and take off your clothes.  It has been refreshing that the last four
roles that I've done have not been so blatantly sexual with me being put
on some imaginary pedestal.  I keep all my clothes on in HOUSE ON
HAUNTED HILL, MARY JANE'S LAST DANCE, and THE WAY OF THE GUN.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Do you consider yourself a sex symbol?  How do you deal
with all your adoring female fans on a daily basis?</P>
<P>Diggs: I only get bits and pieces of it here and there on the streets.
Publicity really hypes it up the most.  After this movie comes out it
might get a little rougher but until now it hasn't been that bad.  Like
I went out to a predominantly black club last night and nobody said
anything and I was wishing somebody would so that someone would dance
with me.  It's a trip but it hasn't crossed over to the point where
women are throwing their panties at me.  Honestly, when people ask me
these questions it just tickles me because I wasn't like this in high
school.  I mean it was me, but I was thinner and nerdier, and didn't
have as much confidence.  Deep down that person still remains and I just
laugh when I see myself all studded out in magazine articles and films.
I know what the real person is like and it makes me laugh.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Is Taye Diggs your real name?</P>
<P>Diggs: It's a nickname.  All my friends from my past would know me as
Scott Diggs.  Taye Diggs comes from Scott-taye.  When I went to college
I liked it because it was so different and I have an infatuation with
nicknames.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: How were you perceived in LA coming from Broadway?</P>
<P>Diggs: LA is so vapid.  At the time "Rent" was at its peak and most of
the cast was going into the major studios looking for parts.  I actually
got a couple of TV spots from it.  But then all that died down and as
far as casting was concerned it didn't really matter that I had been on
Broadway. Everyone was primarily concerned with screen experience.  I
was lucky enough to land a role where they were looking for a "no name"
actor in HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK.  If they were looking for
somebody famous Wesley Snipes would have gotten to star along with
Angela Basset.  It was truly luck that they wanted to bring somebody new
on the scene.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Your supporting performance in GO has received much
critical acclaim.  How important was that role to you and what did you
get out of it?</P>
<P>Diggs: I feel proud because HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK wasn't quite
out yet so I had no "Hollywood buzz" going into my audition.  I really
take pride in being able to say that I would have gotten that part
whether or not STELLA had ever existed because that's the kind of cat
Doug Liman is.  He brought me in.  He read me.  He hadn't seen STELLA.
He didn't really care, and it was the perfect type of role for me at
that time with a cast of gritty young actors.  I'm hyped that he found
something in me and allowed me to be a big part of that.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: You've had two wedding movies this year with THE BEST
MAN and THE WOOD, how do they compare?</P>
<P>Diggs: THE WOOD was about young people and the other one is more of a
grown up movie.  One is much more light and fun and the other really
goes to the core of adult issues, emotions, and feelings, which is why I
took it.  The large ensemble cast and the fact that it was being shot in
New York, combined with a lot of strong positive images as far as
African Americans are concerned, really turned me on to THE BEST MAN.
It's a movie about black people that deals with issues that cross over
into universal themes that people of all races and creeds can relate to.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: In THE BEST MAN, why didn't your character (Harper) feel
the need to confess to the people involved before his first novel came
out?</P>
<P>Diggs: I think that subconsciously Harper (Taye Diggs) wanted all his
friends to find out.  That's why he writes the book in the first place.
On the surface his character was ignorant but deep deep down he realized
that they should know about what happened and he felt guilty.  The way
he dealt with his guilt was through writing and he convinced himself
that nobody would ever find out, which is where he went wrong.  We all
make mistakes like that, sleeping with somebody who we shouldn't have or
kissing a girl when we know it is wrong.  Me personally, outside of the
book I don't know that I would have told either.  I'm an advocate of the
old adage, "if it ain't broke don't fix it."  If you realize that what
you did was wrong and you KNOW that it's not going to get back at
anybody, in a lot of ways confessing will aggravate the problem even
more.  I'm not saying I'm not an advocate of being honest, but let's
face it, honesty works best when both parties are understanding.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: You've already said you love to dance, act, and sing.
Would you ever consider pulling a "Jennifer Lopez" by trying your hand
in the music business?</P>
<P>Diggs: I don't know how it would be taken.  I would have to go about
choosing a label carefully because I wouldn't want to be perceived as
corny in any way.  When you go into that area you have to cope with a
lot of stuff that I don't necessarily want to deal with as far as
selling a certain number of units and what not.  So I don't know that
I'm ready to add all that stress, but I definitely love to sing and if
it were easy then I'd do it.  But everybody would be doing it if it were
easy.</P>
