<P>   If your land has no rain and the soil is dry, you spend your
days irrigating it.  If your land grows olive trees, you harvest
olives.  If your land is rich beyond history's wildest dreams,
you go shopping.  "Holy Man" takes on America's favorite
pastime, gently rather than bitingly suggesting that happiness
cannot be gained through this activity, the title character
insisting that material things are merely a substitute for what
we really want.  The idea is not a new one.  We fireside
philosophers have pondered whether wealth beyond a certain
point contributes all that much to our joy and, in fact, whether
compulsive collecting is really a sign of inner, insatiable
needs.  In "Holy Man," Eddie Murphy, in the role of "G,"
favors the simple life without material possessions and walks
away from a lucrative contract to continue a pilgrimage to
places and people unknown.  Before he flees from the world
of things, he provides us with a portrait of a man who
connects with us because of his uncomplicated, homespun
warmth, beaming smile, and selfless devotion to people he
has grown to love.  </P>
<P>   But the 37-year-old, Brooklyn-born Mr. Murphy is not as
amusing as he was in his previous pictures, especially the
"Beverly Hills Cop" series, nor does his performance show
the depth he displayed in "The Nutty Professor."  The movie
is far blander than his concert performance in "Eddie Murphy
Raw," and though it contains moments of caustic wit, this PG-
rated picture is so namby-pamby, so confused about its view
of frenzied shopping, that when you leave the theater you
may want to tune into QVC or other cable network on your 35
inch TV and start ordering.  Tom Schulman's plot, as directed
by Stephen Herek, gives us a mixed message.  "G" is
supposed to dissuade his audience from their frantic pursuit
of material goods, yet his appearance on the TV shopping
channel, where he pleads for better human relations and love
of nature, nets the producer the biggest boost in sales in his
history.  What's more "G"'s promotion of the spiritual lifts the
income of the advertisers not only through the sly
manipulation of the TV cameras but by "G's" own
endorsement of products like chain saws, gadgets that use
your car's motor to cook food, and straw welcome mats.</P>
<P>   The story opens on Ricky (Jeff Goldblum), a TV executive
whose job is threatened by his boss, producer McBainbridge
(Robert Loggia), because the shopping channel is suffering
from a flatness in sales.  Driving along a Miami highway with
an attractive but businesslike marketing manager, Kate (Kelly
Preston), he suffers a blowout which "G," a holy man on a
pilgrimage, offers to fix.  When "G" is almost run down by
Ricky's car, Ricky and Kate take him to a hospital and pay
his medical bills, while Ricky invites him to stay at his home
during his recuperation.  Insinuating himself onto the stage of
the shopping channel during a live broadcast, he imparts
advice to a young woman demonstrating a battery-operated
facial toner that "You don't need that to be beautiful: you're
beautiful already," but does not leave the platform without
turning up the current and propelling her face into unearthly
contortions.  Picking up another actor's chainsaw, he asks his
audience what they would rather see: the studio trashed by
this advertiser's product or G's carving a statue of the Venus
de Milo with his own hands.  To see destruction is the implied
answer, and G provides us with just that.</P>
<P>   After a series of skits of varying merit, G is offered a
lucrative job on the station with the proviso that his agreeing
to a contract would save Ricky's job.  G's ultimate decision
flies in the face of sentiment, implying that it's better for an
individual to seek his own happiness than to better the lives
of others through preaching and charitable donations.</P>
<P>   The movie is dominated not by Eddie Murphy but by Jeff
Goldblum, a versatile actor indeed, who can flesh out a comic
performance as easily as he can horrify us in the role of a fly. 
The romantic scenes which are superimposed on the ad
satire appear contrived but more than that they distract our
focus from the primary point of the story: that spiritual
goodness leads to contentment far more readily than material
engorgement.  The age difference between Kelly Preston and
Jeff Goldblum does not help their chemistry together, their
tearful reconciliation coming across as merely sticky and
hackneyed.  For a more pungent, loopier send-up of
America's slavery to goods, try to catch a revival of Percy
Adlon's "Rosalie Goes Shopping," featuring the obsession of
Bavarian-born Marianne Sagebrecht, who has settled into an
Arkansas town and spends whole days phoning the shopping
channel while lying in bed.</P>
