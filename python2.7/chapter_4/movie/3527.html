<P>"A castrato was a male soprano or contralto singer whose unbroken voice 
had been preserved by castration performed before puberty so that the 
larynx would not develop.  As a result his voice retained its high 
range, but because his lungs and chest matured they were able to produce 
sounds of great power.  Although the range of the castrato was similar 
to that of the female soprano or contralto, the voice was stronger, 
often more voluptuous in tone, and capable of the utmost delicacy and 
technical brilliance.  Castrati were in great demand as leading singers 
during the 17th and 18th centuries in opera houses throughout Europe..." 
     -- Robert M. Cammarota, ACADEMIC AMERICAN ENCYCLOPEDIA </P>
<P>     FARINELLI brings to the screen a segment in the life story of one 
of the greatest singers of the 18th century.  Born in 1704 with the name 
of Carlo Broschi, Farinelli (Stefano Dionisi, who resembles Daniel Day-
Lewis) became the most celebrated singer of his day in Italy, England, 
and Spain.  It is the London period (from 1734 to 1737) that this film 
concentrates upon, using Farinelli's relationship with his brother 
Riccardo (Enrico LoVerso) and his rivalry with composer G. F. Handel 
(Jeroen Krabbe) as the cornerstones upon which to build a narrative. </P>
<P>     Despite its historical inaccuracy, the most interesting facet of 
FARINELLI is the complex interaction between the title character and 
Handel.  Fine performances by Stefano Dionisi and Jeroen Krabbe deepen 
the intensity of these scenes, but it doesn't take long to recognize 
that the composer is perhaps the more interesting figure.  There is such 
potent rage, scorn, and passion in Krabbe's portrayal that it makes one 
wonder what Handel might be like when not locked in combat with the 
castrato.  The glimpses offered here are tantalizing, but their prime 
function is to provide a suitable foil for the protagonist and, as such, 
they fail to sate the appetite. </P>
<P>     Farinelli is not a likable man and, regardless of attempts by the 
script to show a more human, misunderstood side to his personality, the 
character comes across as a narcissistic egotist.  His duels with Handel 
are concerned with power, not music.  Neither is willing to give in to 
the other.  Handel will not concede that the voice of a castrato is 
necessary for his compositions to attain their full impact; Farinelli 
initially refuses to admit that he needs Handel's music for fulfillment. </P>
<P>     Of equal, if not greater, importance to the film's structure is 
Farinelli's relationship with his brother Riccardo.  Although marred by 
betrayal and jealousy, this interplay lacks much of the raw energy of 
the Handel/Farinelli scenes.  Often, whether the brothers are sharing a 
woman in bed or arguing over Riccardo's unfinished opera, little is 
revealed of the real ties binding them.  There is much background we're 
not privy to, and when the secret between them is eventually uncovered, 
the disclosure is anticlimactic. </P>
<P>     On the technical side, FARINELLI is imperfect.  Since no castratos 
exist today, reproducing the resonant, three-and-one-half octave voice 
presented difficulties.  Director Gerard Corbiau overcame the obstacle 
by recording the voices of Derek Lee Ragin and Ewa Mallas Godlewska, 
then electronically combining them.  This effect is marginally 
successful, but the poor synching of the audio track with Dionisi's lip 
movements destroys the magic.  Often, Farinelli's performances, which 
are meant to be among the film's centerpieces, come across as awkward.  
Considering all the expense and trouble devoted to costumes and 
settings, the overall result is disappointing. </P>
<P>     FARINELLI represents a fascinating, if occasionally overly 
melodramatic, recreation of a period when Baroque music ruled Europe.  
The story is perhaps not as cohesive or coherent as it could be, but 
there is enough narrative momentum to retain the viewer's interest.  The 
result is an intriguing, if flawed, film about the power of the voice 
and the effects of fame and ego upon interpersonal communication.   </P>
