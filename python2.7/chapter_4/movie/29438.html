RATING: 7/10</PRE>

<P>First of all, forget the trailer for this movie, because this is not, and I
repeat, not a "kid's movie" or a "comedy" for that matter. It has a few elements
of both but most of all, it's about one adult character's journey to recovery.
There's swearing in the film, violence and the main character smokes like a
chimney, drinks like a fish and gambles like there's no tomorrow. Definitely not
a Saturday afternoon flick for the children.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A gambling man who drinks too much is stuck between a rock and a hard place. He
owes money all over town, and the only way that he could pay his debts back is
by coaching an inner-city kid's baseball team. He reluctantly agrees to do it,
but ultimately cannot fight his own demons and must come to grips with what he
wants for his own life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Every other year, there seems to be a film that comes out of left field for me
(pun intended). A movie that makes me forget about all of the more reasonable
points on which to appreciate a film on a more "technical" level, and just goes
for the heart. Well, I am human after all and every now and then, a soft spot is
gonna be touched, and as much as REMEMBER THE TITANS was mostly unoriginal and
predictable last year, HARDBALL goes through much of the same material that
we've seen before here, but still manages to work as an all-around successful
movie with its heart so obviously in the right place. Is it sappy? Yes! Is it
predictable? Yes! Does it matter? No. This is the kind of movie that either
pulls you into its web or doesn't. It's a very simple premise (a lost man
looking for a way out of his gambling debts), but it plays all of its cards just
right. The main character in this film, Keanu Reeves, isn't a "nice guy". He
doesn't start off as a nice guy, and even when given the opportunity to redeem
himself, doesn't quickly turn into a nice guy overnight. He has problems in his
life...many problems. He gambles too much, drinks too much and doesn't really
have any goals. But it isn't long before he's confronted with many of the
lessons of life, which most of us already know, but seem to take for granted.
Live for the day. Cherish your loved ones. Create a meaning for yourself. Don't
give up on your dreams. Cliches to be sure, but also very true. Reeves'
character spends a lot of time with underprivileged children in this movie, and
ultimately begins to see the harsh reality of their lives and the tough nature
of being brought up under less groomed conditions. Basically, he gets a second
chance in his own life.</P>
<P>The "projects" shown in this film are a place that would scare the crap out of
any living adult, and sadly, many children live and breathe there every day. I
liked this movie because it gave me my own slap across the face. Life could be
much worse. There are a lot of people who need help out there. Giving back to
the community is important. Life is never perfect, but you can always try and
improve yourself. I also appreciated the superb work done here by the
filmmakers, since the story is essentially one that we've seen a number of times
before, but it's made more relevant here, there's comedy mixed into the drama
and Reeves is given the opportunity to utilize his restrained acting demeanor to
draw us further into his character's inner-struggles (you never really know
where he's coming from or going). But even more importantly, they should all be
commended for pulling off one of the most difficult tasks in the movie biz and
that is the fine line between films that are super-sappy and effectively
poignant.</P>
<P>I was touched by this film and hope to bring some attention to it with this
review. Alright, so maybe I was having an "off-day" or something, but it grabbed
me by the heart-strings and played me like a fool, and this is a very rare
occurrence indeed. By the end of this puppy, I was tearing up like a diapered
child myself. Very odd. So if you enjoyed REMEMBER THE TITANS and don't mind
sitting through a fairly predictable movie with a sound message of hope,
redemption, faith and second chances, I suspect that you will be taken by this
film as well. And the fact that it's all based on a true story (and a book
entitled "Hardball: A Season in the Projects" by Daniel Coyle) makes it all that
much more effective.</P>
