<P>     Groovy platform shoes and bell-bottoms, happening floral prints, 
far out leisure suits, and a dreamy Davey Jones -- once again, we've 
been sent time tripping with the Bradys, the stuck-in-the-'70s clan 
living in the '90s.  With the premise firmly established in last year's 
THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, A VERY BRADY SEQUEL offers more of the same:  
sexual innuendo, double entendres, and a truckload of references to the 
original series.  Aficionados of the TV show will probably appreciate 
this film, as will those who enjoyed the first installment.  After all, 
there's nothing new here -- this is just a continuation of the jokes and 
style that made the initial big-screen foray a surprise success.  Even 
though the director has changed (Arlene Sanford replacing Betty Thomas), 
the two movies fit together so well that it's impossible to notice.</P>
<P>     Shelly Long and Gary Cole are back as Carol and Mike Brady, parents 
to Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes), Marsha (Christine Taylor), Peter 
(Paul Sutera), Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox), Bobby (Jesse Lee), and Cindy 
(Olivia Hack).  In the last movie, the Brady clan faced the possible 
loss of their beloved house.  On this occasion, the threat is a little 
more insidious.  One day, a man claiming to be Carol's presumed-dead 
first husband, Roy Martin (Tim Matheson), arrives on the Brady's 
doorstep. Although he looks nothing like Roy and is six inches too tall 
(he got stepped on by an elephant and stretched on the rack), he is 
immediately accepted, and, because Mike believes that good manners are 
everything, even invited to stay as a guest.  Unbeknownst to the Bradys, 
however, Roy isn't who he says he is, and his reasons for insinuating 
himself into the household have to do with a $20 million statue of whose 
value the Bradys are blissfully unaware. </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, in some of the film's more amusing moments, after 
realizing that they're not really brother and sister, Marcia and Greg 
are fighting a powerful sexual attraction to each other.  Jan is so 
desperate for a boyfriend that she makes one up.  Peter is struggling 
with career decisions -- does he want to be an architect or an 
adventurer when he grows up?  And Bobby and Cindy are busy playing 
Sherlock Holmes.  </P>
<P>     A VERY BRADY SEQUEL lacks the freshness of the first outing, but it 
makes up for it -- at least as much as it can -- with a slightly better 
plot structure.  Nevertheless, there's only so far you can stretch an 
affectionate parody of the Bradys, and, like its predecessor, this film 
loses its momentum before the halfway mark.  By the end, all the puns, 
"innocent" sex jokes, and nods to the series have become tiresome.  The 
scenes of the Bradys blithely interacting with '90s culture don't have 
nearly the bite they should -- things are played a little too nice, a 
little too safe.  The material in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE couldn't sustain 
a ninety-minute feature, and neither can that in A VERY BRADY SEQUEL.</P>
<P>     As was true of the 1995 film, the most remarkable aspect of the 
production is how it mimics the feel of the series.  The sets are near-
perfect recreations, and the performers look and act eerily like their 
TV predecessors.  Unlike in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, there aren't any 
cameos by former cast members, but a couple of witty links to other old 
TV shows (GILLIGAN'S ISLAND and I DREAM OF JEANNIE in particular) make 
up for it.  A VERY BRADY SEQUEL has a light, breezy air that will 
probably appeal to a certain segment of the movie-going population, 
although it's a little too vacuous for my taste.  At half its length,  A 
VERY BRADY SEQUEL would have been fun, but, no incarnation of the Brady 
Bunch, no matter how cleverly satirized, can use up an hour and a half's 
screen time without making the audience feel like they've overdosed.</P>
