<P>     THE CELEBRATION's Klingenfeldt clan is one of those families that
proves Tolstoy's assertion about unhappy families being unhappy in their
own unique ways.  More to the point, it's a family that makes you feel
better about your own unhappy family.  Eldest son Christian (Ulrich
Thomsen) wallows in depression over his twin sister's recent death;
brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) is still in hot water over his
alcohol-fueled scene at the last family gathering; sister Helene (Paprika
Steen) creates a stir by bringing black boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai
Dakinah) to meet her less-than-politically correct relatives.  Throwing
these people together for a weekend on a country estate celebrating father
Helge's (Henning Moritzen) 60th birthday would be enough to insure plenty
of recrimination to go around.</P>
<P>     That's the kind of character truth "Dogma '95" -- a manifesto for a
return to bare bones filmmaking created by several leading Danish
directors -- was supposed to engender.  Yet at times THE CELEBRATION feels
forced and artificial, merely in a different way than the forced and
artifical genre films implicitly criticized by Dogma '95.  The gathering 
in the story eventually comes to focus on the removal of a jurassic-sized
skeleton from the family closet, and the reactions of all the family
members to what has been revealed.  Some of those reactions ring jarringly
true, like Michael's attempt to return himself to his father's good graces
by removing the cause of the trouble.  Others feel silly, like the
machinations of the family cook to help air the dirty laundry.  But good
or bad, all the reactions spring from a bombshell rather than the typical
exchanges of small artillery that make for most family tension.</P>
<P>     It all seems terribly unnecessary considering how perceptively
Vinterberg and co-scripter Mogens Rukov capture the more mundane animosity
and foolishness of family gatherings.  When grandfather rises to tell the
same slightly risque joke for the second time in the evening, all and
sundry indulge him, chuckling and applauding just as merrily as the first.
Michael treats his wife Mette (Helle Dolleris) with such a basic contempt
that he leaves to walk a mile with the children when he picks up Christian
in their small car.  Helene's mother (Birthe Neumann) "mistakes" Gbatokai
for Helene's previous boyfriend, a Latino, with a casual and oblivious
racism.  Vinterberg and his exceptional cast -- Thomas Bo Larsen is
particularly good as the younger son overflowing with toxic anger -- find
moments of greatness in these simple conflicts.  They're the sort of
things all families contend with, the things that make people want to take
blood relations and make them bloody relations.</P>
<P>     Indeed, Vinterberg's point may have been that the more extreme
example of family crisis that supercedes the others is more common than
we'd like to believe.  If so, it still feels like an authenticity that
draws too much attention to itself.  Curiously, the same could be said for
the rigid film-making prescriptions of the Dogma '95.  The hand-held
camerawork, washed-out video-to-film cinematography, location shooting and
absence of underscore music were intended to subsume "auteurism" in favor
of story, but they simply become an auteurism of a different sort.  As
effectively as the location serves to intensify the claustrophobia of a
family forced to confront its demons, the look and sound of THE
CELEBRATION -- or lack thereof -- just make you aware of how different
this film looks and sounds than other films, exactly when the familiarity
of the situations should come into focus.</P>
<P>     Some might argue the same was true of the most notable previous Dogma
'95 effort, Lars Von Trier's BREAKING THE WAVES.  Yet in that film, the
style supported the instability of the main character's world;
thematically, the look was of a piece with the story.  In THE CELEBRATION,
that same look works far less effectively, because it feels like an
exercise rather than a choice.  When Vinterberg nails the truth of basic
family interaction, it's easy to overlook that exercise.  Later, when a
dramatic plot point takes over, it starts to seem that too much has been
imposed on these characters from without -- a bad dogma starts to run over
all its great karma.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bad dogmas:  7.</PRE>
