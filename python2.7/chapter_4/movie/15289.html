<PRE>REVIEW: Mr. Jealousy
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Eric Stoltz, Annabella Sciorra, Christopher Eigeman, Carlos
Jacott, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Brian Kerwin, Peter Bogdanovich, Bridget
Fonda
Director: Noah Baumbach
Screenplay: Noah Baumbach</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: December 3, 1998 (Adelaide and
Brisbane later)</P>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece): 2
stars</P>
<P>If it is feasible for a writer to develop characters of both sexes
equally - that is, understand the minds of males and females and convey
that understanding competently - it would be reasonable to say that Noah
Baumbach has achieved this feat.  In Mr. Jealousy, he displays a talent
for working on the fundamental needs of character development; that is,
giving the audience an instant relation to them.  Baumbach is not
concerned with whether his characters are male or female, good looking
or not - as long as they have a mouth and two ears, they are good
enough.  If he had chosen a vehicle that could have showcased these
qualities with more pizzazz, more depth and more confrontation, he may
have created a film which could have competed with its characters.</P>
<P>That's not to say that they are a particularly fascinating bunch.  They
are realistic, however, and that's always enough on which to build.
Baumbach has a gutsy attempt at doing so, but in the end the
relationship between the two protagonists is unrewarding, and a little
tedious.  His symbolism of relationships and emotions is ludicrously
simplistic, even down to the name of the film (instead of portraying
jealousy through character development, it's right there in the title).
This is not to say that Mr. Jealousy does not have its moments - some
are daunting, others make for pleasant viewing - but neither of these
elements are substantial enough to keep it on a continuous high.</P>
<P>Lester (Eric Stoltz) has a big problem with dating: he gets jealous.
Very jealous.  Ever since his first girlfriend - who he later spots
making out with an older man - Lester has taken his jealousy to a level
just below obsession.  He trails previous boyfriends like a bemused
private eye, keeping the exact count on how many there have been and
what their names are.  Perhaps it's a good thing, then, when he admits
himself to a therapy group.  But of course Lester is only doing this so
he can gain a greater insight into best-selling author Dashiell Frank
(Chris Eigeman), an ex-boyfriend of Lester's current woman, the
wild-spirited Ramona Ray (Annabella Sciorra, of What Dreams May Come).</P>
<P>When Ramona begins to make sense of Lester's lies, whilst Lester
develops an awkward and dishonest friendship with Dashiel, everything
builds up to a sensational climax.  Mr. Jealousy works best when
Baumbach positions his characters in the weekly therapy sessions, as
their spoken words reflect on the uniqueness of their personalities.
But Baumback refuses to let viewers ever feel wholly uncomfortable, so
the potentially confronting climax is filtered into sentimentality and
uses a cheap way of expressing the tension between two characters.
After skillfully crafting dramatic scenes of therapy, all Baumbach can
do is initiate a lame-brained fistfight.</P>
<P>Although with respectable performances all round, an underdeveloped
screenplay hinders Baumbach's direction.  This leaves him in an awkward
predicament: Mr. Jealousy is not funny enough to be a comedy, not
dramatic enough to be a drama, and not romantic enough to be a story of
romance.  Perhaps it's a comedy/drama/romance; but the jokes weren't
particularly memorable, the drama was watered down and the romance was
not invigorating.  The film's characters, however, save it from being a
disaster.</P>
