<PRE>The Opposite Sex and How to Live with Them
United States 1992
Directed by Matthew Meshekoff</PRE>
<P>Cast: Arye Gross, Courteney Cox, Kevin Pollak, Julie Brown</P>
<PRE>Rating: 3 out of 5</PRE>
<P>David hangs out on a bar with his best friend Eli. Both are trying
to pickup women to take home and have sex with. Also in the bar are
Carrie with her best friend Zoe. As you can expect from a romantic
comedy David sees Carrie and can't keep his mind from her, although he
and Eli eventually go home with two other women. However, the four of
them meet at a football stadium the following weekend. David takes
Carrie out and they fall in love. Not before long, Carrie moves in with
David. What follows is just what you can expect from a romantic comedy,
they have to face the ups and downs of a relationship,
somewhat like Rob Lowe's and Demi Moore's About Last Night… (1986).</P>
<P>What really annoyed me about this movie is the many times when
the film suddenly stops and Eli starts to talk to the audience,
giving his views about men, women and relationships. I guess he is
supposed to be the funny side-kick that provides the comedy,
but I just think it slows the movie down. Besides that, what he
says is pretty silly anyway.</P>
<P>When it comes to the actors, Arye Gross is a much too pale actor
for a leading role. On the other side, Courteney Cox is perfect in
the role of Carrie and Julie Brown does a good job as Carie's
exuberant girlfriend.</P>
<P>All in all, this is a good movie for a quiet Monday evening in front
of the TV. Renting it on video? I don't think so…</P>
