<P>_Runaway_Bride_ (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Ever since _Pretty_Woman_ came out of nowhere to become a box office
sensation in 1990--and propelling Julia Roberts's star and salary into
the stratosphere--there has been ongoing rumblings about a possible
sequel.  Thankfully, no such unnecessary revisit with millionaire Edward
Lewis and prostitute Vivian Ward has ever made it to the big screen, but
some nine years after the release of that much-loved romantic comedy
comes something quite close to a sequel: a reunion of stars Roberts and
Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall.  And while _Runaway_Bride_
isn't quite at the magical level of _Pretty_Woman_ (then again, what
is?), this satisfying charmer has all the makings of (pardon the bad pun)
another runaway hit.</P>
<P>Aside from _Pretty_Woman_, _Runaway_Bride_ must also face comparison
with Roberts's early-summer romantic comedy hit, _Notting_Hill_, and
again the newer film falls short; it lacks the running satire of
Tinseltown celebrity that gave that fluffy film an unexpected edge. 
_Runaway_Bride_ is simply just fluff, with a typically preposterous
set-up to match: New York-based _USA Today_ columnist Ike Graham (Gere)
hears about Hale, Maryland resident Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) penchant
for abandoning bridegrooms at the altar--3 and counting--from a stranger
at a bar and then proceeds to write an unflattering piece on her.  His
inaccuracy-filled article prompts a complaint letter from Maggie, costing
Ike his job.  Seeing a "corrected" piece on Maggie as a way to jumpstart
a freelance career--and anxious to see her dump Groom Number 4, whom she
is set to wed in a week's time--Ike goes down to Hale to investigate.</P>
<P>Once the knotty exposition is out of the way, it is Marshall and
scripters Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott's job to step back and let
the Roberts-Gere sparks take over, and the well-matched stars pick up
where they left off on that Hollywood fire escape nine years ago; they
sizzle together, and it is impossible not to have a rooting interest in
their characters' eventual coupledom.  Equally as well-matched are each
star and their respective role.  Maggie is a flighty kook not unlike
_Pretty_Woman_''s Vivian, except (to crib a line from _She's_All_That_)
"for the whole hooker thing," and accordingly, Roberts is very convincing
in Maggie's skin.  On the other hand, Ike is a polar opposite to
_Pretty_Woman_'s uptight Edward, but Gere obviously has fun--and _is_
quite fun--as a charming, if troublemaking, scamp.</P>
<P>Of course, Marshall and the writers cannot completely disappear, and
they bring a number of entertaining comic situations--including a couple
of blatant, but not distracting, mirror scenes to _Pretty_Woman_--and
witty dialogue to the affair.  They also surround Roberts and Gere with a
colorful supporting cast; the standouts are the always-effective Joan
Cusack as Maggie's best friend and Christopher Meloni, a hoot as Maggie's
athletic-minded fiancé.  In addition to Roberts, Gere, and Marshall,
Hector Elizondo is also on hand for the reunion, but his involvement in
the story is limited at best as Ike's photographer friend.  Especially
disappointing is Elizondo's lack of onscreen interaction with Roberts,
with whom he worked so memorably in the last collaboration.</P>
<P>_Runaway_Bride_ is sure to be knocked as ridiculous hokum, which, much
like _Pretty_Woman_, it certainly is.  And like that previous film, it
gives the audience what it wants to see: an irresistible confection that
serves up the laughs and a sweet, involving romance, with the proven
Roberts-Gere electricity as the not-so-secret ingredient that gives the
film its special kick.</P>
