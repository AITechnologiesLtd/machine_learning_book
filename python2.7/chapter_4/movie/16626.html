<PRE>STEPMOM (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Chris Columbus
Stars: Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Liam Aiken, 
Lynn Whitfield
Running time: 125 minutes. </PRE>
<P>Those who believe that Hollywood doesn't create strong roles
for female actors anymore should look closely at the new film Stepmom.
This emotionally charged drama gives two popular actresses an
opportunity to sink their teeth into a pair of strongly drawn, juicy,
challenging and interesting female roles that move beyond the normal
stereotypes.</P>
<P>Jackie Harrison (Susan Sarandon) is a divorced mother who is
still protective and possessive of her two children.  When her former
husband Luke (the always solid Ed Harris), a workaholic lawyer,
settles into a relationship with fashion photographer Isabel (Julia
Roberts), she feels resentment and hurt.  Isabel is unprepared for the
instant demands of temporary motherhood thrust upon her.  The
unforgiving Jackie is quick to point out her shortcomings, and
constantly belittles her efforts in front of the two children.  When
Jackie is diagnosed with terminal cancer, though, the two women are
forced to bury their enmity towards each other and establish a united
front for the sake of the children.  Out of bitterness slowly grows an
unexpected friendship.</P>
<P>It would be too easy to dismiss this manipulative tear jerker
as a melodramatic "women's film", but that is both patronising and
condescending.  Stepmom is a well acted, deftly written, entertaining,
and broadly appealing drama that explores some important themes, with
a mixture of compassion, insight and humour.</P>
<P>Five writers laboured over this poignant drama about families,
divorce, the love and pain of relationships, but it is Oscar winner
Ron Bass (Rain Man, Waiting To Exhale, etc) who gives the multi-
layered material its warmth and honesty.</P>
<P>Sarandon and Roberts also co-produced the film, and their
empathy for the characters and its themes is evident in their sterling
performances.  Sarandon has the meatier role, one that allows her to
run the gamut of emotions, which she does with style.  She also says
more with inflections and her facial expressions than most actresses
say with pages of dialogue.  She is excellent, bringing an innate
intelligence and compassion to this wonderful role, and her
beautifully nuanced performance should ensure she starts front-runner
to win a well-deserved second Oscar.  Roberts' solid and emotionally
rich performance is something of a stretch, and should also come as a
revelation to those who have previously dismissed her as a light
weight actress of little depth.</P>
<P>As the self-absorbed and resentful Anna, Jena Malone (who
played the young Jodie Foster in Contact) captures all the pain,
confusion and anger of children caught in the bitter cross fire of a
divorce, and delivers a quite mature performance.  Liam Aiken (from
The Object Of My Affection, etc) is heartbreakingly cute and
unaffectedly natural as younger son Ben.  In one eloquent scene in
which Jackie is sharing some time with her two children, he turns to
her and says: "If you really want me to, mum, I'll hate her."  Harris
is fine and restrained, and brings dignity to his smaller role.
Director Christopher Columbus is better known for his slapstick
comedies of the juvenile Home Alone variety.  But he also brought a
sympathetic touch and compassion to films like Nine Months and the
hugely successful Mrs Doubtfire.  Those qualities are very much in
evidence in Stepmom, which is also touchingly dedicated to the memory
of his late mother.
