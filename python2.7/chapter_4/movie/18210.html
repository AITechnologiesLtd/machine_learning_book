<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     To be quite honest, I expected crap.  I often do, being the pesimistic
person that I am, but I especially expected crap when I rented Exotica.  I
would have never done it if it weren't for the fact that Atom Egoyan,
director of The Sweet Hereafter and The Adjuster was behind the camera.
That and, let's admit it, I'm human.</P>
<P>     Of course, knowing that Egoyan was working on it should have told me
that Exotica wasn't going to be crap.  That it wasn't going to be a simple
striptease film, and that it would be close to as profoundly lyrical as The
Sweet Hereafter was.</P>
<P>     Exotica is a story of the intersection of lives.  On the one hand you
have a pregnant strip club owner, Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), on the other, a
disturbed DJ, Eric (Elais Koteas).  Also in the cast is a seductive stripper
Christina (Mia Kirshner) and a father of a murdered child, Francis (Bruce
Greenwood).  A customs official (Calvin Green) and a man in charge of a
pet-smuggling ring (Thomas, Don McKellar) are also in the mix.  With the
magic that Egoyan has always had, however, he moves all of this into a
pattern of coherence.</P>
<P>     Their lives intersect, mainly, through the events leading up to and
followwing the breaking of the rules at a strip club: that a stripper is not
allowwed to be touched.  They also intersect with the fact Eric and
Christina were the two that found the murdered daughter.  You with me?
Francis is an accountant sent by the IRS (or the Canadian equivalant) to
confirm that Thomas is involved in smuggling, and Thomas becomes his helper
in answering a question.</P>
<P>     To clear up misconceptions, Exotica isn't a movie about sex.  Most
people will become so caught up in the sex that they won't notice the vivid
portrait of a man so depressed by his daughter's death that he is willing to
pay his niece Tracey (Sarah Polley) $20 an hour to babysit a dead child.  I
did.  And, good Christ, I liked it.</P>
<P>     The performances are nearly flawless.  Bruce Greenwood flexes his
acting muscles as he did in The Sweet Hereafter, portraying a character so
ripped apart by the events in his life that he goes to obsessive lengths to
keep some sembalance of hope.  Mia Kirshner does her job so perfectly that
we do not see a stripper when we look at her: we see a multifacted character
who has a very special relationship with Francis.  Eric, Elais Koteas'
finest role, is a man who has let his love for Christina turn into an
obsession that becomes an inflamed jealousy.  Thomas is a man trying to
salvage whatever is left of his morals while the world turns insane around
him.</P>
<P>     The conflicting obsessions are pitted against one another, forming an
intriguing mindgame that goes into the deapths of each character as we sit
back in awe, watching a truly mythical story unfold in front of us.</P>
<P>     Like with The Sweet Hereafter, Atom Egoyan crafts a tale capable of
academia, rife with symbolism and haunting images.  He drifts us back and
forth throughout time, shows us characters that are to be pitied and loved
at the same time.</P>
<P>     Although I dare not use this as an example in everyday conversation,
Exotica is a film that is a striking example of a lack of a villian.  The
antagonist, ironically, is each protagonist.  Each person's personal demons,
their problems, conflict with each other.  For those who have grown to hate
the archetypal battle between good and evil, this is a very refreshing movie
to watch.</P>
<P>     Let there be several warnings about this film, however.  First, those
who are very conservative or easily offended back off: Exotica is not for
you.  Second, those who are renting it for sex might as well not: Exotica
does not deliver in that department, and features less nudity that any other
strip film I have ever seen.  Third, for those who lack a literary mind you
should avoid this film: it takes a lot of intelligence to decipher.  Fourth,
don't watch it after midnight: you won't get it when it's that late.</P>
