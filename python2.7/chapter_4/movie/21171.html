<P>
  The Story of Us (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Bruce Willis,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson. Directed by Reiner.</P>
<P> I wish I could say I liked "The Story of Us." I found it enjoyable and
entertaining, but at the same time, simplistic and shallow.</P>
<P> "The Story of Us" is a look at a marriage at a crossroads.</P>
<P> After 15 years and two kids together, Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis
and Michelle Pfeiffer) have nothing left to say to each other.</P>
<P> As one of them narrates, the silences between the pair were louder than
any arguments.</P>
<P> Yet the script by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson fails to really show how
Ben and Katie grew apart.</P>
<P> There is a lot of talk of neither one listening to the other, of the
demands of parenthood and career creating wedges between them. And
sequences highlighting these events are shown.</P>
<P> But the entire thing feels superficial and slight. Ben and Katie are
presented as two highly educated and articulate individuals, so it is
difficult to buy into the proposition that they cannot communicate.</P>
<P> Directed by Rob Reiner, "The Story of Us" is sunny and perky. And that is
another of the film's problems It is bathed in a cheery glow that sabotages
the supposed dark tone of its main plot.</P>
<P> For in essence, "The Story of Us" is a comedy. Thus it is difficult to
seriously accept or be concerned with the disintegration of the Jordans'
marriage.</P>
<P> You instinctively know from the outset what the outcome will be.</P>
<P> This is not to imply that "The Story of Us" is a bad movie. It is bubbly
and warm, almost at odds with its storyline.</P>
<P> Willis and Pfeiffer are most likable. The only quibble is with Willis'
various hair pieces, which become distracting as the film bounces back and
forth through various flashbacks into the Jordans' relationship.</P>
<P> As usual, when he is not playing macho he-men, Willis gives a well-rounded
performance. He allows Ben's vulnerability to show, as well as his
character's rage and frustration with his situation.</P>
<P> Pfeiffer is luminous and golden. Her big, expressive eyes shine with joy
or mist with sorrow.</P>
<P> Where the movie falls short is in explaining the estrangement between Ben
and Katie. There problems seem so ordinary, so minor - and their love for
each other seems so strong - that you wonder what their problems actually
are.</P>
<P> An attempt to show their differences by bringing in their parents fails,
as does the glimpses of the pair with various counselors. You just cannot
take their estrangement on face value.</P>
<P> A talented supporting cast, featuring Reiner and Rita Wilson, work hard to
help out Willis and Pfeiffer, but all are undone by a weak script that
makes light of the main premise.</P>
<P> "The Story of Us" will satisfy fans of Willis and Pfeiffer, but that's
about it. It contains several laughs, but very little insight.</P>
