<P>CONSPIRACY THEORY
Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, Patrick Stewart
Rated R, Three stars (out of a possible five.)</P>
<P>"Conspiracy Theory" is a puzzle box. This entertaining, engaging and 
thoroughly loopy thriller is full of surprises. It's a rare, and quite 
refreshing, treat to watch a Hollywood film and actually be kept off 
guard almost all the way through. Richard Donner, director of the "Lethal 
Weapon" series, reunites with Mel Gibson for this tale of a paranoid New 
York cab driver who stumbles into a great deal of trouble. Gibson plays 
Jerry Fletcher, a deeply disturbed man who overwhelms his passengers with 
tales of bizarre conspiracies. 
According to Fletcher, militia groups are actually U.N. troops, the 
Vietnam War was fought over a bar bet between Howard Hughes and Aristotle 
Onassis, and filmmaker Oliver Stone is really an government agent in 
charge of disseminating disinformation (actually, there may be something 
to that one). Fletcher publishes a newsletter called Conspiracy Theory, 
which has only five subscribers ("I think it's because of the economy", 
he sheepishly explains). When not startling passengers or experiencing 
flashback-induced panic attacks, he focuses his attentions on Alice 
Sutton (Julia Roberts), a lawyer with the Justice Department. He watches 
her through her apartment window, and periodically bursts into her office 
to share his latest paranoid notions. Sutton permits the intrusions 
because Fletcher once protected her when she was attacked by muggers. </P>
<P>Things change suddenly when Fletcher is scooped up by mysterious agents, 
led by Dr. Jonas (Patrick Stewart), whose questions indicate that one of 
Fletcher's conspiracy stories has struck a nerve with someone very 
powerful. Sutton gets drawn into the fracas and the questions begin. Just 
how mentally ill is Fletcher? Is he an ally or a threat to Sutton? Who is 
Dr. Jonas and what does he want from Fletcher. Who are the good guys and 
who are the bad guys? Just what the hell is all this really about? </P>
<P>Richard Donner keeps you guessing as he confidently spins his tale. Far 
too many key moments in "Conspiracy Theory" depend on coincidences, and 
the film is occassionally too slick for its own good, but that's par for 
the course from the guy who directed "Lethal Weapon". What Donner excels 
at is utilizing actors and locations for maximum effect, and he's in fine 
form here. 
The film's three leads are exceptional actors. Mel Gibson does an 
outstanding job portraying the mentally ill cabby. His mannerisms and 
phrasing are credible, creating a character who is sometimes touching, 
sometimes beguiling, and often quite disturbing. In addition to his 
paranoia, Fletcher is obsessive/compulsive. When confronted about his 
irresistible urges to seek out copies of "The Catcher In The Rye", he 
breaks down in a swirl of confusion, frustration, and shame. The scene is 
completely believable and quite moving. Gibson is a connoisseur of bad 
puns and the Three Stooges, and tosses in several puns and one pointed 
Stooge reference. The self-indulgence is mildly annoying, but stays 
within acceptable limits, because its conceivable that the character 
might share the same traits. </P>
<P>Julia Roberts does fine work as Alice Sutton, adding welcome personal 
details to what could easily have been a stock character. At one point, 
Sutton uses a fire extinguisher to crack apart a padlock. After breaking 
the lock, she pauses to hand one of the pieces to a cohort. Nice touch. 
Roberts shades Sutton with a wistful nature that compliments her powerful 
personality. </P>
<P>Patrick Stewart's Dr. Jonas shares the commanding presence that made his 
Star Trek performances resonate, combined with an extra air of elegance 
and menace. Again, Stewart takes a potential stereotype and adds just the 
right amount of nuance to keep the audience wondering about the true 
nature of the man.</P>
<P>Donner does wonders with his New York locale, playing the city as if it 
were another character. It rains during most of the night scenes - - all 
the better to reflect the neon lights and enhance the romance of New York 
after dark. It's a obvious trick, but it works. His daylight scenes 
depict New York as a huge, intricate and somewhat threatening machine. 
Most of the daytime scenes are shot under overcast skies. In fact, it 
seems the sun only shines to make Julia Roberts' beautiful hair glisten 
all the more.</P>
<P>"Conspiracy Theory's" storyline is admittedly ragged. The plot gets a bit 
too confusing at times, while becoming overly conventional at other 
moments. But despite the weak points, the film is consistently 
entertaining, thanks to the premise, Donner's assured direction and the 
sharp performances from Gibson, Roberts and Stewart, along with well-
drawn work from the supporting players. "Conspiracy Theory" will never be 
mistaken for art, but it's a fine diversion during these dog days of 
summer.</P>
