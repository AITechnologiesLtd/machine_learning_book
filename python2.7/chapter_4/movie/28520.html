<P>Mexico hasn't exactly been a hotbed of successful independent film over the
last decade, but if every movie they produce in the next ten years is only
half as good as Amores Perros, Steven Soderbergh had better start brushing
up on his Spanish.  The film, which was nominated for an Oscar and has
already picked up awards from numerous film festivals (including a critics'
award at Cannes), features three stories united by a car crash on a busy
Mexico City street.</P>
<P>Each of the tales would be interesting enough on their own, but cobbled
together as uniquely as they are, the film become a devastating story about
fate and relationships.  Even the Amores tagline - "Don't worry if you don't
see this picture; you're going to live it anyway" - pokes fun at the Fickle
Finger.  All three stories feature a seriously flawed character with designs
on some sort of prize, but Fate always steps in (here, in the form of the
crash) to unexpectedly slap it away.</P>
<P>The first story is about a young unemployed man named Octavio (Gael García
Bernal) who is in love with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche).  She
already has one baby, is expecting another and is still a student, but none
of this seems to bother Octavio, who feels his gangster brother Ramiro
(Marco Pérez) isn't good enough for the beautiful Susana.  He dreams of
getting enough money to convince Susana to run away to Juarez with him and
accidentally finds it in Cofi, Ramiro's dog.  It turns out Cofi is one hell
of a fighter, and Octavio makes mad money pitting him against other dogs in
brutal (and illegal) fights.</P>
<P>Amores's second tale, titled "Daniel and Valeria," focuses on a magazine
editor and fashion model, respectively.  Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero) is
successful, married and has two kids, but that doesn't stop him from moving
in with Valeria (Goya Toledo).  After being horribly disfigured in an
accident, Valeria's life becomes even worse when her little dog disappears
down a small hole in the floorboards of their new apartment.  The dog is
trapped in the hole, Valeria is trapped in a wheelchair, and Daniel is
trapped in a situation that makes him long for the boring life he just
abandoned.</P>
<P>The final vignette shows an old man named El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría)
living a life of squalor after walking out on his family to become a
revolutionary many years ago.  He has served time in prison but now spends
his days and nights tending to a flock of stray dogs...and the occasional
contract killing.  El Chivo (or "The Goat"), who looks a lot like DeNiro in
Angel Heart, is hired by a cop to kill his crooked partner, but he seems
more interested in stalking his estranged daughter, Maru (Lourdes
Echevarría).</P>
<P>Other than the crash, the stories don't really intertwine, but, once in a
while, you can see characters from one pop up in the background of another.
With a gritty, ultra-violent story about hitmen, stickups, a fixed fight and
a car crash told in fragmented time, you can't help but compare Amores to
Pulp Fiction or, really, anything Quentin Tarantino has written and
directed.  There have been several attempts to duplicate Tarantino's style
since Fiction was released and, while I don't know if it was the filmmakers'
intention to do so, this film is the best knock-off yet.  It's even better
than Go, which also featured three uniquely structured stories.  Writer
Guillermo Arriaga does a great job constructing the film around stories
involving dogs, as well as showing us that we don't get any wiser as we grow
old (Octavio is in his teens, Daniel is middle-aged and El Chivo is pushing
60).</P>
<P>Amores would have been an amazing enough film, but learning it's Alejandro
González Iñárritu's directorial debut is a little like getting the wind
knocked out of you.  Iñárritu, who also produced and expertly edited the
film, shows the poise and confidence of a feature-film veteran here and,
aided by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and scoremeister Gustavo
Santaolalla, has crafted the first great film of the new millennium.  This
is, hands down, the most auspicious debut I've seen in years.  Assuming you
can get over the subtitles and grisly dog fight scenes (the credit assure us
no dogs were harmed during filming, but it's just too intense to believe),
you'll probably feel the same way.</P>
