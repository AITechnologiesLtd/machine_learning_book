<P>For the forty-ninth celluloid addition of Tarzan, Disney has created a
sometimes excellent, mostly below-par animated translation. The main concern
that this film has to worry about is that it may not succeed in satisfying its
target age ranges. The gruesome deaths of a number of characters may distract
younger viewers and the overall sappiness Tarzan has may distract teenagers.
(Tarzan can swing and slide throughout the jungle like a skateboarder on a
half-pipe, an obvious attempt to make teenagers forget about the saccharine
mood of the film). Another problem is that this film is nothing new. The
animation may have advanced over the years, but the story of a character who
does not know where to fit in has been used to death by Disney (see The Little
Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, etc.). These films ostensibly may seem
different from first glance, but in reality, they're all the same; Same ending,
same characters, same ultimate morals.  Tarzan is no exception to this trend.
The movie is unoriginal and predictable. The aforementioned films above share
these negative adjectives with Tarzan, but they are not as blatantly obvious
or, for some reason, as painful to sit through. </P>
<P>Also those Disney classics all have very memorable characters that carry the
whole movie. The Little Mermaid's Sebastian, The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa,
and Aladdin's The Genie all shined with excellent supporting roles. Tarzan
attempts to add some comedic flair to its cast with friends of Tarzan named
Terk and Tantor. Voiced by Rosie O'Donnell and Wayne Knight respectively, they
are both underused and not as funny. The only noteworthy voice from the cast
was that of Minnie Driver as Jane. Perfectly cast as the British researcher who
falls in love with the protagonist, Driver's confused, stuttering voice is very
convincing when she first meets Tarzan and as the film progresses, she still
maintains the same justifiable uneasiness of where she is and who she is
talking to. </P>
<P>The story, of course, follows Tarzan, a boy raised by gorillas and his attempts
to fit in with his family by copying their exact mannerisms and gesticulations.
When he discovers humans for the first time, he must decide where he belongs in
life. Tarzan is, as mentioned before, irritating in some areas, particularly in
the beginning and the end. It takes way too long for Tarzan to meet Jane and
since you know exactly what will happen at the end, it is almost unbearable to
sit through.  For an alternative to this Disney feature, check out the
under-appreciated Warner Bros. flick The Iron Giant.</P>
