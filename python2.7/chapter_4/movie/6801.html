<P>The Funeral finds B-movie director turned indie auteur Abel Ferrara
returning to the gangster film, the genre that provided the setting for
his barely-noticed 1990 B-movie masterwork, "King of New York."  But
despite the presence of Christopher Walken at the center of both films,
Ferrara's latest meditation on murder, morality and the nature of sin
bears a much stronger kinship to the director's more recent philosophical
tracts, "The Addiction" and "Bad Lieutenant,"  And, much as I admire the
director's efforts to tackle the spiritual and moral underpinnings that
lie beneath the surface of such durable staples of the B-movie maker's
palatte as gangster films, vampire movies and urban cop melodramas, I'm
sorry to observe that thus far I've found the director's genre-bending
experiments an uneasy mix, burdened by far too much self-conscious talk
and not nearly enough character-driven action.   
Which is shame, since Ferrara demonstrates as sure a grasp of pulp
character and convention as any American director since Sam Fuller,
another director who rarely shied from exploring the multiple layers of
his pulp subject matter, though rarely at the expense of its relentless
momentum.  But in age when so many independent film makers seem content to
set their sights no higher than emulating the flash and fire of Quentin
Tarantino, I suppose I can hardly complain when a director of Ferrara's
talent and ambition chooses to pattern himself after Robert Bresson.</P>
