A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Joe Dante</PRE>
<P>Written by: Gavin Scott, Adam Rifkin, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio</P>
<P>Starring: Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Toy soldiers that attack parents and children, families under siege </P>
<P>Synopsis:
When a military-industrial conglomerate swallows Heartland Toy Company,
a bungling toymaker (Jay Mohr) incompetently puts advanced military
computer chips into two groups of toy action figures. The pacifistic toy
extraterrestrial Gorgonites led by Archer (voice of Frank Langella) are
programmed to hide and surrender, while the Commando Elite toy group led
by Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) are programmed to attack and
kill Gorgonites and their allies. The military chips accidentally give
the toys the ability to think and act like living creatures.</P>
<P>The toys escape into a suburb and wreak havoc. When a boy named Alan
Abernathy (Gregory Smith) befriends Archer and the Gorgonites, the
Commando Elite toy soldiers categorize humans as Gorgonite allies and
mount a lethal attack on Alan's family and the family of next door
neighbor Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), whom Alan has a crush on. The
evil soldiers also insert military chips into Christy's Barbie-type
dolls to turn them into soldiers.</P>
<P>The Fimple and Abernathy families find themselves surrounded by an army
of toys with nail guns, flame throwers, attack helicopters, and buzz
saws. Will they survive and defeat the aggressive hordes of small
soldiers?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Although SMALL SOLDIERS' marketing tie-ins suggest that it is a
children's movie, the type that little kids (young enough to buy plastic
dolls) would love to attend, it is not. If children under ten actually
did attend the movie, they might wonder about the sporadic profanity and
about all those nude Barbie-doll-types running amok. Or they could mimic
the kid, Alan, who climbs up a telephone pole and shorts a piece of
metal between two live power cables. And they would find that their
beloved doll hero Chip Hazard is actually the bad guy. In short, parents
of young children should be warned that SMALL SOLDIERS is not the type
of material found in TOY STORY, BABE, or 101 DALMATIONS. The glib,
bland, and predictable SMALL SOLDIERS has good special effects, a happy
ending, and preaches a good moral (don't judge a toy by it's cover), but
it is inappropriate for younger children, who should not be watching the
quality of movie where boorish characters make catcalls at nude Barbie
dolls or use cuss words.</P>
<P>A superior toy-horror movie for a wide general audience should be at
moments suspenseful and chilling, but funny and bitingly satirical with
multi-generation appeal. It should contain action for the kids as well
as well-timed, story-related inside pop culture allusions for adults. It
should contain interesting characters, accommodate the audience's gut
sense of justice, deliver a few unexpected twists, and escalate to a
satisfying moral-laden conclusion. </P>
<P>SMALL SOLDIERS doesn't fall into the superior category because its human
characters lack dimension, the movie is predictable, and its pop
references lose comic impact because they fly thick, but are peripheral,
rather than story-related. On the other hand, special effects and pop
culture trivia fans might be pleased by elements of SMALL SOLDIERS. The
toy effects by JURASSIC PARK's Stan Winston are well done and lifelike.
As for trivia buffs, director Joe Dante serves up a cornucopia of hidden
cultural references. (Example: "You're from Jersey? What exit?") Even
the voices and music refer to previous movies (DIRTY DOZEN, SPINAL TAP
etc.).</P>
<P>On a side note, fans of the late actor/comedian Phil Hartman will enjoy
seeing him in a small role as Mr. Fimple. It was his last movie role.</P>
