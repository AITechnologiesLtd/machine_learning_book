<PRE>Get Real **</PRE>
<P>rated R
released by Paramount Classics
starring Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton, Charlotte Brittain, Stacey Hart, Kate
McEnery, Patrick Nielsen
written by Patrick Wilde(based on his play "What's Wrong With Angry?")
directed by Simon Shore</P>
<P>For quite a while, homosexuality has been trying to find a way into modern
cinema. In films such
as "Gods And Monsters" and "Beautiful Thing", the homosexual themes were
ways to further the
story, rather than shock the mainstream audience. But, I'm afraid the genre
has taken a step in the
wrong direction with Simon Shore's dramatic comedy "Get Real", the first
feature from Paramount
Classics.</P>
<P>Ben Silverstone stars as Steven Carter, a 16-year-old British gay male who
settles for casual sex
in bathrooms. The only one whom he has told about his sexuality is
Linda(Charlotte Brittain), his
overweight next-door-neighbor. The two social misfits are constantly mocked,
but they
complement each other nicely.</P>
<P>One day, while Steven is in a bathroom where the gay men mingle, he gets a
note from someone
in the next stall, asking him to meet him outside. A few minutes later,
Steven realizes that it's John
Dixon(Brad Gorton), the most popular jock in school and "sex on
legs"(proclaims Linda). He tells
Steven that they must forget about the whole thing because he doesn't know
what came over him.</P>
<P>While the year goes on, and different girls(most notably Jessica, played by
Stacey Hart) hit on
Steven and John, the two teens realize their infatuation for one another.
John still denies to himself
that he's gay, but he admits that he is confused. Steven, meanwhile, is
coping with the fact that his
parents are slowly figuring out his secret identity.</P>
<P>The main problem, though, with "Get Real", is that it treats "coming out" as
a plot element that can
fill a movie. But all of "Get Real" is just Steven contemplating whether to
come out or not. "Get
Real" wants to be a normal romantic-comedy, but it makes it's gay themes
seem all too important.</P>
<P>Another problem is cliches. In class, the kids just have to be learning
Shakespeare's "Romeo And
Juliet"(oh no, not another metaphor), while the film's own star-crossed
lovers are taking their
place. And of course, there's got to be the newspaper article, written by
Steven, entitled "Get
Real", from which the film takes its name. It's quite surprising that a film
which claims to be so
refreshingly original and daring can't even surpass the depth of America's
latest teen comedies.
"Get Real" is also very, very melodramatic, so I ended up feeling almost
nothing for it's characters,
making it a dull experience.</P>
<P>But at least newcomer Ben Silverstone gives a charming performance as
Steven, with potential
that shows that he will charge ahead when given a better role. And this is
director Simon Shore's
first film, so at least he has many more years for improvement</P>
