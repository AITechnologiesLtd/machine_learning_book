<PRE>"Knock-Off" Is a Sloppy Sham
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>"Consistency" - I think that this is a word that doesn't exist in the
vocabulary of Director Tsui Hark.  His Honk Kong action offering,
starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, is a muddled mess that pushes you from
one action sequence to another without really taking the time to
properly set it up.  But at least when you buy the ticket, you pretty
much have a good idea of what's in store for you.  After all, it's a
film that takes place in Hong Kong, has a Hong Kong director at the
helm, and stars Van Damme.  Yes, you'll see plenty of fight scenes and
gunshots galore, but don't expect anything more than that.</P>
<P>The storyline involves a smuggling ring that is trying to smuggle small,
sophisticated bombs into the U.S.  With the explosive power of a half a
stick of dynamite, these little technological marvels are so small that
they could be hidden inside a watch, a small radio, or even inside a
button.   If these bombs make their way into the U.S., the ringleaders
could blackmail the government into an exorbitant monthly payment.  The
CIA follows several leads that point them to Marcus Ray (Van Damme).
>From there, it's a convoluted series of sequences that tells very little
story but allows lots of time for Van Damme to run, kick, punch and to
try to figure out why everyone is after him.  </P>
<P>But Marcus Ray isn't the only one that's trying to make sense out of
what's going on.  The audience can easily get lost as well.  We run into
a plethora of other characters such as Tommy (Rob Schneider), who may be
more than just Ray's partner.  There's also Karan (Lela Rochon), a
supposed executive that wants to talk to Marcus about his business.
Also on the case is a handful of other cops, including Paul Sorvino (a
very respectable actor), who must have lost a bet to want to take a role
in this film.  </P>
<P>Some of the action sequences were kind of nifty, like the cat and mouse
chase aboard a freighter while gigantic cargo crates shifted back and
forth threatening to crush people.  Yes, some neat ideas, but all are
squandered.  The "Speed Racer"-like dialogue (sentences that
incomprehensibly spew out), and the epileptic manner of editing, which
is done at breakneck speed, easily earns this film the title of "most
highly disorganized effort of the summer."</P>
