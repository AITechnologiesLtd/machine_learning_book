<PRE>An Ideal Husband ***</PRE>
<PRE>rated PG-13
Miramax Films
starring Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchett,
Minnie Driver
based on the play by Oscar Wilde
written and directed by Oliver Parker</PRE>
<P>Being a recent junior high graduate, I have not yet studied the work
of Oscar Wilde. It is, however, common knowledge that he was one of
the most influential playwrights of the modern era. "An Ideal
Husband", one of his best known productions, has been effectively put
to screen by Oliver Parker, and it features lots of the scathing,
ambiguous dialogue that Wilde is famous for.</P>
<P>The setting is London. The time is the late 1800's. Lord Arthur
Goring(Rupert Everett), a 36-year-old bachelor, is considered the most
eligible single man in London, but he just can't commit himself to one
person, perhaps because of his own selfishness. "To love oneself," he
remarks, "is the beginning of a lifelong romance." However, an old
flame, Laura Cheveley(Julianne Moore), has arrived in town, and things
begin to get interesting.</P>
<P>She decides to blackmail Sir Robert Chiltern(Jeremy Northam), a
high-ranking government official, into supporting a scheme involving
the Suez Canal. If he declines, then she shall go to the press with
the story of how he "stole" his fortune. Sir Robert's wife, Lady
Gertrud(Cate Blanchett) is beginning to get suspicious. Meanwhile, Sir
Robert's sister, Mabel(Minnie Driver) is looking into getting a
husband.</P>
<P>There are a few reasons why "An Ideal Husband" is such wonderful
fun. First and foremost is the job of the remarkable cast. Rupert
Everett and Julianne Moore are the standouts; each one perfect for
their role. Jeremy Northam has his second fine performance after his
outstanding turn in "The Winslow Boy", and Cate Blanchett is back in
period-piece style after her interesting role in "Pushing Tin". Minnie
Driver gives a more low-key performance, but she is dynamic as always.</P>
<P>Oliver Parker, whose debut was 1995's "Othello", makes "An Ideal
Husband" seem expansive rather than stagy. With an amazing cast and
classic source material, it would seem hard to go wrong, but Parker
adds his own touch in the way certain scenes are set up. There's
nothing too original about this production, but the script is fresh
and funny and the film moves along at a quick pace.</P>
<P>"An Ideal Husband" is an ideal summer diversion for those looking for
a breath of fresh air from the blockbuster flicks headed our
way. Miramax is, once again, doing a fine job marketing the film and
they have once again given us a reason for seeing their movies. "An
Ideal Husband" is a period-piece with style, wit and charm.</P>
