<PRE>"U.S. Marshals" - Only Mildly Arresting
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>As a psuedo-sequel to 1993's The Fugitive, we can see many elements in
this film that parallels its predecessor.  Tommy Lee Jones returns to
recap his role as the alpha-male US Marshal, Samuel Gerard.  He leads
his band of deputies through the most dangerous of situations, but
with his keen guidance, the group emerges unscathed and is successful
in capturing their quarry.  There is also an innocent man (Mark
Sheridan played by Welsey Snipes) claiming to have been falsely
accused who, after a slam-bang sequence, manages to escape while being
transported from one prison to another.  He then spends the rest of
the movie trying to prove his innocence while alluding capture.  But
also true to most sequels, this movie hardly compares to its original.</P>
<P>The main difference is that The Fugitive was adept at balancing a
rivalry that pitted a law enforcement machine against a humble man who
endeared us with his heart and deep sense of pathos.  Harrison Ford's
character really didn't have a chance of alluding the law, but we
wished deeply that he could in order to right what was wrong, and
miraculously, he did find a way to escape.   "Marshals", however, is
more of a traditional, action-oriented offering whose focus is on
Tommy Lee Jones.  His Gerard character is a natural leader, and with
his gravelly voice, he incessantly barks out orders to his team.
Never taking a moment's rest ("When can we get some sleep," asks his
deputy.  "Next month," he yells back.), he sternly imposes his
authority over those under his command, looking very impressive as he
handles the chaos that sweeps around him.  </P>
<P>Choas emerges for him in two forms.  One is that of Sheridan.  As an
escaped convict, Gerard must bring him in.  But Sheridan is extremely
resourceful and thanks to his mysterious background, he manages to
allude Gerard at every turn.  The other element that distracts Gerard
is a new team member assigned to him by the government (Agent John
Royce played by Robert Downey Jr.).  While Gerard prefers the
familiarity of his team, Royce has some special skills better suited
to capturing Sheridan.</P>
<P>Despite all this talent, "US Marshals" doesn't achieve any new
tension-filled heights.  While Sheridan is supposedly innocent,
Snipes, though likeable, can't quite evoke any sympathy for his
plight.  Snipes seems more comfortable as the aggressor rather than
the victim.  If you look deep into his eyes, he looks like a man that
would rather shoot you in the head rather than into your bulletproof
vest.  Downey's character, while an effective agent, doesn't really
add anything to the mix except to offer a mild surprise at the end.
And the story is needlessly complicated.  Because of Sheridan's
mysterious background, we are introduced to subplots that include a
government mole, spying, and the real reason why Sheridan is wanted.
But there are some nice sequences and an incredible escape when Snipes
traps himself atop a tall apartment building surrounded below by
police.  Meanwhile, Jones is right on the money, maintaining focus and
letting us enjoy his thought process when he takes the lead.  Overall,
this is a film that barely gives us enough to sustain our interest.
But what little we get is well-executed, and it's greatest plus is
that we get a lot of Tommy Lee Jones.  But without him, "US Marshals"
wouldn't be nearly as effective.</P>
