<PRE>             A film review by Graeme Huggan</PRE>
<PRE>                    Copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>   Originally titled 'Don't Lose Your Head', this parody of the Scarlet 
Pimpernel story was the first Carry On to be produced by Rank Film 
Productions. 
   Two English fops, the 'powdered, be-wigged, be-ribboned' Sir Rodney 
Ffing (Sidney James) and his counterpart Lord Darcy Pew (Jim Dale) decide 
to travel to revolutionary France in an attempt to rescue their fellow 
French royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the 
guillotine. Due to a series of machinations and disguises, they are 
largely successful. Ffing becomes known as 'The Black Fingernail' because 
he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up, one 
with a black fingernail.
   After the Fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the Duc de Pommfrit 
(Charles Hawtrey), Citizen Robespierre (Peter Gilmore) orders the head of 
the Secret Police Citizen 'the Big Cheese' Camembert (Kenneth Williams) 
and Citizen Bidet (Peter Butterworth) to follow the Fingernail to England 
and do away with him. (In fact, Darcy and Ffing are their coachmen!) Once 
at Calais, the Fingernail meets Jacqueline (Dany Robin) and they fall in 
love instantly. He tells her his identity and gives her his locket. When 
Camembert realises that the Fingernail is nearby, he searches the inn at 
Calais and captures Jacqueline, thinking that she is wearing a diguise 
and is really the Fingernail!
   Jacqueline is imprisoned in the Bastille and Camembert, his love 
Desiree Dubarry (Joan Sims), and Bidet all travel to London in pursuit of 
the Fingernail. They pretend to be of noble stock, calling themselves the 
Duc and Duchesse de la Plume de ma Tante (with Bidet their assistant) and 
are invited by Darcy to a Ball held by Ffing. Desiree finds out that 
Ffing is the Fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck, but she 
ends up falling in love with him. Ffing attempts to stall Camembert so 
that he can return to the Bastille to rescue Jacqueline, Camembert has 
her moved to the 'Chateau Neuve', and a climactic sword-fight decides who 
will lose their heads at the end of the film!
   A more complex story than most Carry Ons, this film enjoys good 
production values (sets, costumes) and an on-form cast. Sid James is 
excellent as the English fop and Black Fingernail, Kenneth Williams 
excels as the evil Camembert, and Peter Butterworth expertly plays the 
substantial part of Camembert's thick-witted crony. Other acting honours 
go to Joan Sims who is perfect as Desiree and Charles Hawtrey who is 
excellent as the French aristo Pommfrit. 
   Although it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the 
end of the film, it is largely successful due to the performances of the 
main stars, its slick and professional production, and its 
better-than-usual script. Definitely one of the best of the series and a 
joy to watch.</P>
<PRE>My rating: 4 out of 5 stars.</PRE>
