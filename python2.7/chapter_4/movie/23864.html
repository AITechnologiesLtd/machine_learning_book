<P>Kenneth Branagh's "Love's Labour's Lost" conceives many good ideas on how to
inject life into one of Shakespeare's most inane plays, then spoils them with
bizarre execution. It's one thing to intersperse the Bard's original dialogue
with Busby Berkeley-style musical numbers, and quite another to fill the
frame with actors who look like they've been smoking crack.</P>
<P>In the story, a young king (Alessandro Nivola) forms a pact with several
countrymen, who pledge to lock themselves away for three years and dedicate
their attentions to study. They will sleep only three hours per night, fast
frequently and avoid female company. It's a bit like boarding school, I
guess, except without the buggery.</P>
<P>The early scenes show words of concern coming from Berowne, the character
played by Branagh, who doubts whether he and his chums will be able to live
without romance. This is an accurate prediction, and soon he and the king, as
well as fellow scholars Dumaine (Adrian Lester) and Longaville (Matthew
Lillard), are bewitched by the charms of four French ladies -- Princess
(Alicia Silverstone), Rosaline (Natasha McElhone), Maria (Carmen Ejogo) and
Katherine (Emily Mortimer).</P>
<P>Neither the play nor the film explain what possessed the king to lock himself
away -- is it intentional that the man seems mad? If so, why do none of the
characters ever mark his insanity? More importantly, what is supposed to be
so entertaining about men and women sending each other messages of love,
shuffling away tittering, discussing the process and then repeating it?
That's the ridiculous game that fills most of "Love's Labour's Lost". Hardly
Shakespeare's finest hour.</P>
<P>Because its story is so very lame, I was grateful for the film's singing and
dancing -- at least some energy is brought to the proceedings. Wouldn't you
rather hear songs such as "Cheek to Cheek" and "There's No Business Like Show
Business" than the frivolous chatter of sub-standard Elizabethan drama? The
movie's problem is its excess of reaction shots, and its performers'
over-the-top gestures, bulging eyes and sweeping hand movements. Especially
irritating is Timothy Spall, who attempts to be a jester by way of an
embarrassing fake Spanish accent and clumsy walk.</P>
<P>Branagh loves the work of William Shakespeare, and UNDERSTANDS it, which is
why his screen adaptations garner so much acclaim. "Hamlet" (1996) was one of
cinema's great directorial achievements. "Love's Labour's Lost" is a film of
ingenious concepts put into practice with disappointing clumsiness.</P>
