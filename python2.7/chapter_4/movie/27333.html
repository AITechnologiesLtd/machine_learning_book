<P>After the surprise $140 million dollar hit "The Blair Witch Project" a sequel 
was inevitable. Even though 65% of the audience who viewed this masterpiece, 
most hated it. I for one though it was a brilliant piece of art, and it 
literally scared the hell out of me, leaving me in my seat to sit, shaking, 
wondering what I just viewed. After I heard talks of a sequel, I wanted to 
kill whoever was making up the rumors, until I found out they were true, and 
now that the sequel has come out I must say I'm quite surprised at how 
well-made the movie was.</P>
<P>Opening with a clever sequence, of people praising and dissing on "The Blair 
Witch Project" we meet Jeff Patterson, a Blair Witch fantatic who sells stuff 
in his hometown in Maryland, stickmen, blair witch t-shirts, you get the 
point. He takes four people out into the woods on a journey known as "The 
Blair Witch Hunt", Kim, a smart gothic psychic, Erica a Wiccan witch, Tristen 
and Stephen a couple who are obsessed with Blair Witch was well, and Tristen 
is expecting a child, but obviously doesn't want to keep it.</P>
<P>After spending the night in the woods, they wake up to find themselves 
covered in shreds of paper, which is the work of Tristen and Stephen, not 
knowing what they did for five hours, the five people retreat to Jeff's home 
(an old factory) and view the tapes of what they did, what they find out is 
utterly shocking, and surprising, though I thought the film goes into too 
much of a slasher pic type of ending. Until then though, the film is quite 
clever and shocking, and very very gory. What the first film accomplished in 
Hollywood was that you didn't need gore, violence or monsters to scare you.</P>
<P>"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is a decieving title, there is no Book of 
Shadows, and the movie really has nothing to do with the first, except for 
Blair Witch herself. Sadly though she does not make a star-studded 
appearance, and really there is not any scares in the film at all, a few 
shlocks here and there, with a pumping rock soundtrack to back it up, but 
narely a scare is in the film. One would have hoped for a better "Book of 
Shadows" but Joe Berlinger does what he can with the film, and has some very 
good direction.</P>
<P>The stars in the first movie were memorable for not having a script, and 
adlibbing most of their stuff, in here the script is written out and it is 
quite obvious, the standout of the film is Kim Director as the gothic girl, 
she takes on her role and takes over the screen in the process. The rest of 
the cast is ok, but they aren't anything compared to Kim. There is some flaws 
in the movie, as well as some plot holes for those who didn't visit the 
website. But all in all "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" is one to be 
visited, maybe more than once.</P>
