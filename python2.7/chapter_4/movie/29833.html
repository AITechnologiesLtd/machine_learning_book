<P>Synopsis: An East German homosexual named Hansel (Mitchell) falls in love 
with an American army sergeant. In order to cross the Berlin Wall and 
marry him, Hansel endures a sex change operation; but the procedure is 
botched, leaving him with a one-inch reminder of his true gender. Calling 
himself Hedwig, Hansel goes to America where, after divorcing hir husband, 
s/he begins a songwriting career. But when Hedwig's new boyfriend (Pitt) 
steals all hir songs and becomes famous, Hedwig starts a band of hir own 
and sets out in pursuit across the country.</P>
<P>Review: "Hedwig And The Angry Inch" is a kinetic, outrageous, enormously 
entertaining rock musical, a rare example of a genre which has all but 
vanished. But this is also a compelling exploration of gender. Hedwig is a 
transsexual, but more out of necessity than desire; the film chronicles 
hir acceptance of hir sex, embodied by the "angry inch" left between hir 
legs. Performances are fine across the board, including Mitchell in the 
challenging title role, able to maintain a campy, over-the-top persona 
without losing the audience's interest or sympathy. Also very good are 
Pitt as Hedwig's ex-lover-turned-rock-star and Shor as a band member whose 
relationship with Hedwig is never really defined and doesn't need to be. 
Mitchell's script has plenty of off-kilter laughs, and sensibly the film 
encompasses more humour than just jokes of a sexual nature; a look back to 
Hedwig's dysfunctional childhood (including days spent playing in the 
oven) is hilarious. Mitchell's offbeat direction compliments the story 
nicely: part-drama, part-documentary, part-music video, part-undefinable 
(including some amusing breaking of the fourth wall, as when Hedwig and 
his band invites the audience to sing along to a song). Also not to be 
missed is the movie's inspired soundtrack, mostly written by Stephen 
Trask, incorporating everything from punk rock to neo-country.</P>
