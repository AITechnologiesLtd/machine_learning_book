<P>I think it was inevitable that some guy in Idaho (or someplace like
that) would dub a film "Movie of the Decade" somewhat before the
millennium.  I'm just surprised no one has declared a "Movie of the
Millennium".  At least you'd have that bit of alliteration.</P>
<P>In any case, our "Movie of the Decade" for this summer is "The Truman
Show".  Jim Carrey is Truman, a man in a fish bowl, unaware that he is
being televised to the world.  The TV series of Truman's life, captured
by thousands of secretive cameras around the movie set/town of Sea
Side, is Bigger Than Seinfeld (if that can be imagined).  He has been
televised, unaware, since before birth (why not conception?), and, in
the show's 30th year, he begins to realize that his world apparently
revolves around him.</P>
<P>This basic plot has been used before.  Relying on the Way Back Machine,
we have the whole Descartes thing: the proof of god's existence comes
from "I think therefore I am", but raises the possibility of a Great
Deceiver, spinning an illusionary world around "I".  Arguably, spin the
Way Back dial a bit farther, and you'd come up with Plato and the Cave,
but Plato didn't mean the Cave in a literal sense, and we were in the
cave because of ourselves rather than some external entity.  Much more
recently, Philip K.  Dick played with this "what is reality" idea in
any number of novels.  There was one novella with a nicely surrealistic
moment: the protagonist, already believing there was something wrong
with the world, buys an ice cream cone, only to see the ice cream
vendor disappear, leaving behind only a slip of paper saying "Ice Cream
Cart".  The novella, however, ends more sinisterly and more
conventionally, with it being revealed that the hero was unknowingly
computing missile trajectories by solving the Sunday newspaper puzzle.
Most closely to "The Truman Show", there was a 1980s Twilight Zone in
which a man's life was the subject of a TV series.  I don't recall how
that episode ended, but I'd like to think that the discovery of the TV
studio was scripted, and that there were infinite layers of TV series
within TV series, Russian Dolls of voyeristic entertainment.</P>
<P>I suppose the main difference is that the narcissism has changed from
god or the devil giving sufficient damn to make up the world for us, to
the planet's television audience giving sufficient damn to watch us
brush our teeth in the morning (though, seeing that we have "America's
Funniest Videos", the Fishing Channel and C-SPAN on cable, as well as
random webcams peering into people's apartments, this shouldn't be
surprising).  Yup.  At the close of the millennium, television is our
wrathful diety.</P>
<P>I suppose also that the tag, "Movie of the Decade" is not
inappropriate.  It fits our media-saturated time well.</P>
<P>Anyway, did I actually like the movie?  Yes and no.  The "No" comes from
having problems getting into it in the first place.  I kept on thinking
"klutzy, klutzy, klutzy" as the television people when through their
acrobatics to keep Truman from realizing the truth.  There's minor
clumsiness when Truman picks up studio instructions on his car radio:
why not have rigged radios incapable of picking up certain
frequencies?  And why didn't they realize that Truman probably doesn't
know how to tack a sailboat into the wind?  You have smart people, who
have constructed an elaborate illusion of a TV studio, and yet they
don't know how to plan for contingencies beyond ham handed traffic jams
and nuclear plant meltdowns.</P>
<P>The most glaring clumsiness is the methods used to keep him in town:
make him afraid of the water, make him think travel is dangerous, tell
him that Sea Side is an earthly paradise.  It's easy to come up with
better ideas than this.  You can simply not tell him there's an
outside, a sort of medieval thing to do -- you'll fall off the edge,
say "hi" to the elephants and turtle on your way down -- but possible
because Truman more or less was raised in your Skinner Box.  You pretty
much can tell him anything you want.  This, though, makes him less like
us, hurting television ratings.  Alternatively, you can have this giant
inflated weather balloon roving the beaches, smothering anyone who
tries to leave.  The villagers can come up with spooky stories about
the thing, creating your prohibition.  (True, this is not "The
Prisoner", but it's a neat idea).  Perhaps best and most subtly, they
can simply use the techniques in "It's a Wonderful Life", which was
partially referred to in a TV program Truman watches: whenever he thinks
of leaving, saddle him with responsibility.  "About to go on my world
tour!  Whoops, the savings and loan is in trouble!"  There's no
weirdness in his staying -- he'll be just as good as George Bailey --
and there'll be tear jerker moments when he finds Zu Zu's petals in his
pocket.</P>
<P>One thing, brought up and then ignored: how do you handle Truman's
childhood friends?  He's known his best friend since they were seven
years old.  Can you trust a seven year old not to let Truman in on a
Really Big Secret?</P>
<P>Well, I did get into the movie more after all that.  It's an
entertaining film, not really the masterpiece that some people have
claimed, but certainly worth the two hours.  "Truman" may also mark a
new phase in Jim Carrey's career, that of a more serious actor.  He
does well in this movie: there a nice moment when he stops traffic,
realizing that he's the center of it all, and, near the end as he
reaches the edge of the world, he's convincing.  Think of Steve Martin,
going from "The Jerk" to, say, "Leap of Faith" or "The Spanish
Prisoner".  Yes, there are occasional regressions, like "Sgt. Bilko",
but his range is broader now.</P>
<P>-- 
"The court determined that Fox TV does not impede free and fair
competition in the teen-angst soap-com genre, therefore Party of Five
need not be broken into five 'Parties of One,' one being distributed to
each of the other networks."</P>
