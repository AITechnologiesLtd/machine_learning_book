<PRE>                             REVERSAL OF FORTUNE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Famous lawyer Alan Dershowitz defends
     Claus von Bulow in this adaptation of Dershowitz's book.
     While none of the characters is anyone you would really want
     to know or even deal with, some of the re-assessment of what
     appears initially to be an "open and shut" case is
     reminiscent of TWELVE ANGRY MEN.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     There is an old exchange where one person says, "The rich are different
from us."  And the other person responds, "Yes, they have more money."
REVERSAL OF FORTUNE gives us glimpses into quite a few things but one is the
lifestyles of the very rich.  What we see is less than totally inviting.  In
REVERSAL OF FORTUNE our first impressions of Claus von Bulow play off all
our prejudices against the European aristocracy.  He is cultured, cold,
emotionless, and calculating.  He seems a marble statue that has been
granted the power of speech.  In a sense he is the damsel-in-distress of
this piece.  As the film begins he has already been found guilty of the
attempted murder of his wife Sunny.  To avoid going to prison he gets trial
lawyer and professor of law Alan Dershowitz to defend him.  Of course, as a
matter of record Dershowitz did successfully appeal the conviction and in a
retrial had von Bulow acquitted of the charges.  REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, based
on Dershowitz's own book, is the story of how Alan Dershowitz defended the
impassive Claus von Bulow.</P>
<P>     The film also gives us a view into Dershowitz's unorthodox defense
procedures.  He turns his house into a workshop with teams in each room
researching the legal ramifications of a different piece of evidence against
von Bulow.  The teams even have sweatshirts labeled with the piece of
evidence they are working on.  Dershowitz may be bragging about the
completeness of his approach but, in fact, one may wonder at the fairness of
expending this magnitude of resource in a legal action.  Dershowitz
moralizes why he should take the case even if von Bulow is so likely guilty,
but the audience never works up the respect for him and his methods that it
has for the dramatized Clarence Darrow in INHERIT THE WIND or the dramatized
Louis Nizer in A CASE OF LIBEL.  His causes are not so noble and his fees
are higher.  As unflattering as this film was to Claus, whose only moments
of humanity seem to be when he is having fun with his own ghoulish image in
the press, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE is far less flattering to Sunny.  This
daughter of the idle rich is shown to have been mostly dead already by his
own actions.  She is totally idle and self-indulgent.  Her hours out of bed,
which number only six a day, are a constant struggle to pass through he
system every drug she can lay her shaking hands on.  Regardless of anything
Claus did, we are led to believe that death or near-death was the expected
and logical result of an incredibly self-destructive lifestyle.  If she was
really as portrayed, one wonders how she survived as long as she did.</P>
<P>     In addition to Dershowitz's moralizing, there is one more piece of
moralizing that is irritating in the film.  The film pokes fun at von
Bulow's patronizing, if well-intentioned, attitude toward Dershowitz being
Jewish.  Yet several times the camera takes opportunities to remind us that
Dershowitz is not just a lawyer, he is a JEWISH lawyer.  Camera angles are
chosen to show a painting on a Jewish theme in Dershowitz's office or to
show a menorah in his home.  The camera is just as hung up on religion as is
von Bulow.</P>
<P>     Of the three stars, Glenn Close as Sunny von Bulow has top billing and
got the least screen time.  She does, however, narrate the story in spite of
the fact that it makes little sense to have a narrator who is speaking from
a coma and who was less than a clear thinker even before her coma.  Some
attention has been paid to Jeremy Irons's performance as Claus, though I
have always thought it is easier to be convincingly weird than to be
convincingly normal.</P>
<P>     On the whole, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE panders a bit too much to the fans of
crime "docudramas."  But it is told with wit and subtlety.  I would give it
a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
