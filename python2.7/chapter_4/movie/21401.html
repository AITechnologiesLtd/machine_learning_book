<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>This time of year is always painful for me.  It's always mid-February
when people start to bitch that there are no black Academy Award
nominees.  Hey, dumb-ass, I've got a secret for you…Senseless is the
reason why.  So are Booty Call, Def Jam's How To Be A Player and Most
Wanted, just to bring up the few that I have the misfortune of
remembering.  Ring any bells, Einstein?</P>
<P>Senseless is the latest comedy vehicle for Marlon Wayans, arguably the
least talented of the Wayans brothers.  But, at least he's not making
action films.  And what's the deal with the Wayans brothers?  Are there
enough of them to populate Rhode Island?  And does the WB network really
stand for `Wayans Brothers'?  While you ponder, I'll continue.</P>
<P>Wayans plays Darryl Witherspoon, an economic student at fictitious
Stratford University.  While trying to concentrate on his studies,
Witherspoon also works a series of odd jobs to pay for his tuition and
to support his mother and younger siblings.  These jobs include, but are
not limited in any way to: campus tour guide, dishwasher, salad bar
attendant, mail courier, water boy, blood and, of course, sperm donor.</P>
<P>The main plot line centers on Witherspoon vying for the prestigious
junior analyst job with Smythe-Barney, a powerful brokerage firm that
offers one position annually to a deserving Stratford graduate.  Enter
Scott Thorpe (David Spade), snotty-white-rich-son of a banker who
presents the main competition.</P>
<P>The funny is supposed to come from Witherspoon enlisting in an
experimental drug test for some quick cash.  According to the crazy
campus scientist, the drug is supposed to increase the senses
five-fold.  And you can pretty much write the rest of the film yourself.</P>
<P>There is one great recurring gag in which Witherspoon's apparently
Canadian roommate (Matthew Lillard) thinks that his pal is really a
smack freak and continuously consults a pamphlet entitled `Is My Friend
A Junky?' for information.  The script, from the writers of the funnier
Rocket Man, is also peppered with plenty of dick and shit jokes and even
includes a reference to `tossed salad' that only I seemed to get.</P>
<P>Helmer Penelope Spheeris (Black Sheep, The Little Rascals) continues to
stumble along the mediocre comedy-directing talent heap.  One might
think that she would choose a different career path after the success of
her documentary series, The Decline of Western Civilization, which
earned her kudos (and the `Freedom of Expression' award) at this year's
Sundance Film Festival.  Maybe those are harder to make, but they sure
are easier to watch.</P>
