<P>Director Ed Zwick teams up with Mr. Denzel Washington (A gracious man
according to one of my friends who ran into him on the streets of
Montreal last month, munching on a hotdog and a baseball cap planted
firmly on his once-a-garbage-man head.) for the third time in 10 years
for this modern thriller. They previously worked together on 1989's
GLORY (For which Denzel won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor)
and 1996's COURAGE UNDER FIRE. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Super-straight FBI agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington), works alongside
his Lebanese-born partner, and  CIA agent Kraft (Bening), to solve the
maze of terrorist attacks plaguing the city of New York. When the
terrorists commit acts beyond the scope of the FBI and the local New
York City police department, the US Army is asked to intervene, led by
able General Devereaux (Willis). The entire city is placed under
martial law, and all Arab-American suspects are persecuted and grilled
for information. The siege is set.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mediocre, preachy, self-righteous, thriller starring the great actor
Denzel Washington, which manages to hit some high points, but delves
into too many lulls and plot holes, along with a weak ending, to
maintain my high interest throughout. This film was pretty interesting
for the first half, but once the Army, and the wooden acting by Bruce
Willis came into the picture, things just seemed to drag on without
much real intensity. The final resolution with Willis also seemed quite
anti-climactic and too politically correct for my taste.</P>
<P>This movie has apparently angered many Arab groups and after having
seen the film, I guess I could see why that is. In my humble opinion,
there have been too many terrorists represented as Arabs in movies,
without enough reciprocracy for the rest of their cultural makeup (And
that's about as political as you'll ever get to see JoBlo, so enjoy it
while you can!) But I digress. On the other hand, this film does seem
to want to portray the entire big picture, instead of this simple
minority, and I guess that on that level, it does so intelligently and
effectively. I never really did understand why and what the Annette
Bening character did for a living (She seemed to be absolutely
everywhere in this film, but without much clear explanation as to how
she received clearance for anything), or why anyone, anywhere at
anytime would trust her in this film (But somehow, they all do?!)</P>
<P>Add to that the fact that Bruce Willis seems to have forgotten his
acting chops back in PULP FICTION (7.5/10) and NOBODY'S FOOL (8/10),
and reverted back to his old style of impersonating a piece of mahogany
lumber for this role (good choice, Bruce!). But when you really get
down to it, Denzel Washington is the glue that holds this long-winded
picture together. Year after year, this man continues to reassure us of
his magnificent acting talent, and emotionally lure us into each and
every one of the characters that he inhabits (Okay, so I'm not counting
VIRTUOSITY (5.5/10) !!). Otherwise, Annette was just annoying, while
Shalhoub was passable in his see-through role as the token "nice-guy"
Arab rep. Overall, the movie did pack some thrills, some action, some
interest, little originality, little effect and little sweet movie
aftertaste. I suggest you catch it on a cheapie night in the theatres,
or more sensibly, wait for it on video and enjoy it during those long
winter months.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Denzel Washington was once used in a Newsweek cover story about the
biological basis of the perception of beauty. He was cited as a key
example in a scientific explanation of why he is considered an
extremely handsome man. He's been happily married to the same woman
since 1982.
Annette Bening has been married to the "man with the golden nuts",
Warren Beatty since 1992. They've had three kids together. Apparently,
Warren saw Annette in THE GRIFTERS (6.5/10) and was so impressed with
her work (The shots of her naked goodies probably had nothing to do
with it, eh Warren?), that he sought her out for the romantic role
opposite him in BUGSY (7.5/10).
Bruce Willis was born in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany.
Director Zwick executive-produced the famed baby boom TV drama
"thirtysomething" (1987).
Tony Shalhoub was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and married to actress
Brooke Adams (Who once turned down an offer to be one of the original
Charlie's Angels.) He played Antonio Scarpacci for several years on TV
"Wings" sitcom.
This film was previously titled AGAINST ALL ENEMIES and MARTIAL LAW.</P>
