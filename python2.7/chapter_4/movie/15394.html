<P>     Like a classic storybook tale, 1995's BABE was set no-where and
no-when in particular.  The singular world in which the rosy, glowing
Hoggett farm and its chattering menagerie existed added to the charm that
made the original film a surprise hit and an Oscar-nominee.  BABE: PIG IN
THE CITY takes that anywhere-ness a step farther...actually, a step too
far.  The story begins as Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) suffers an 
unfortunate accident, making him unable to work the farm.  With financial
ruin imminent, Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski) decides to take the
now-famous Babe (E. G. Daily, replacing Christine Cavanaugh) for a
lucrative state fair appearance, only to end up stranded in The Big City.
Where, exactly, _is_ that Big City?  Well, a view from Babe's hotel window
includes The Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, the Eiffel Tower,
and the Hollywood sign.</P>
<P>     It's a cute gag the first time, but it also signals a not-so-subtle
shift in tone from BABE.  The setting is no longer Anywhere, but
Everywhere; the story isn't just a fantasy where anything could happen,
but one where the film-makers try to make everything happen.  Babe and
Mrs. Hoggett contend with suspicions that they are drug smugglers; Mrs.
Hoggett goes to jail when she inadvertently causes a mess in downtown
Metropolis; Babe comes to the rescue of a massive collection of
sort-of-homeless animals.  BABE: PIG IN THE CITY is so full of plots and
sub-plots that saving the Hoggett farm practically becomes an
afterthought, with a resolution so silly it almost seems a waste of time.</P>
<P>     You might suspect that a pace that frantic would be a sop to younger
viewers, but it's hard to imagine George Miller (who produced the original
and also directs here) had kids in mind making this film.  A catastrophic
performance by a low-rent circus (featuring Mickey Rooney in a weird cameo
as a clown of indeterminate personality) turns into a moody and murky
slow-motion sequence like something out of PLATOON; later, a dog with a
bad heart has a near-death experience with pastoral visions.  BABE
certainly had a few dark moments, but nothing like the consistently creepy
feel of PIG IN THE CITY.  Miller may have been playing to the kiddies when
Mrs. Hoggett goes bouncing around a reception hall in inflatable pants,
but not when a dog insults a cat with an epithet that could be interpreted
as quite vulgar.</P>
<P>     Ironically, that strangely mature tone introduces the film's only
truly compelling element, a melancholy performing orangutan named
Thelonious (voice of James Cosmo).  He's a mysterious presence who can't
seem to bear the idea that he's not human, and both the animal and vocal
performances are wonderfully sympathetic.  I sat just a bit forward in my
seat every time Thelonious appeared, gradually realizing that this one
character also served to point out how bland the rest of the characters
are in BABE: PIG IN THE CITY.  There are too many animals milling about to
care about any of them all that much; even the little pig himself seems to
have been sapped of personality.  The easy rapport between Babe and Farmer
Hoggett (relegated here to little more than a glorified cameo) is sorely
missed.</P>
<P>     Then again, a whole lot of things from BABE are sorely missed.  It's
a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake
the original, but BABE: PIG IN THE CITY lack any of the original's
endearing gentle spirit.  It's so hyped-up and busy, it's almost as
though John Hughes got hold of our sweet little pig and tossed him into a
HOME ALONE sequel.  Too many chuckles in BABE: PIG IN THE CITY are too
forced; too many others are too close to a shudder.  This is one major
holiday disappointment, a storybook tale that should have quit with its
original happy ending.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pork chops:  4.</PRE>
