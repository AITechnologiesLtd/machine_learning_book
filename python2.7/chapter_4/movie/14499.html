<P>        The popularity of the TITANIC may help attract audiences to this film,
the full title of which is The Chambermaid on the Titanic.  But this is a
totally different type of love story than that shared between Leonardo and
Kate.  This French-Spanish-Italian joint effort is in French, with English
subtitles.  It is the story of a young married couple, living strenuous
lives, working in a foundry.  
        The owner, lusting after the wife, Zoe, arranges for the young husband,
Horty, to win a trip to England where he will witness the initial sailing
of the ill-fated Titanic.  He hopes that while the husband is away, he can
have his way with her.
        In England, Horty befriends a beautiful French girl who calls herself
Marie.  She cannot find a room in the overfilled city.  He offers to let
her share his room.
        The next morning, she is gone.  He goes to the pier and sees her on
board.  A photographer has taken a tintype of the beauty.  After the ship
sails, Horty prevails upon the photographer to let him have the photo.
        Upon returning home, he hears rumors that, during his absence, the owner
did have a clandestine affair with the wife.  When the owner suddenly
gives Horty a large promotion, he realizes that it must be true.
        Later, at the local bar, Horty tells his friends about Marie and their
time together, adding to the reality with highly imaginative additions. 
His audience grows and he becomes a local hero_.a highly esteemed
storyteller, so much so that he becomes an actor, touring the country with
his ever-growing story.  There is a very surprising ending.  The script is
quite contrived and even ridiculous in spots, but there are many
fascinating scenes.   I found the acting to be very good.
        I give it a C+.</P>
