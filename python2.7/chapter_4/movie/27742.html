_Sweet_November_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If you cast Keanu Reeves in a film with the expectation of him
actually being good, you'd better have a have a role that fits
comfortably within his limited range.  Take, for instance, the films in
which the notorious laughing stock has actually been passable or better:
the _Bill_and_Ted_ films, which made ideal use of his natural blankness
for laughs; _Speed_ and _The_Matrix_, which used his inexpressiveness as
a veneer of toughness; and the recent _The_Gift_… well, credit must go to
Sam Raimi for pushing the non-acting actor into effectively playing a
villainous part no one would think he could ever pull off.  </P>
<P>        Then there's the strange matter of the 1995 romance
_A_Walk_in_the_Clouds_.  Technically speaking, Reeves is his usually
horrible self; witness the embarrassing `Don't you realize how alive she
is?  How _special_ she is?' monologue to see just how wrong he is for the
part of a soulful ex-G.I.  Yet somehow those disastrous displays were
forgivable in the end, and that's because he had such superb chemistry
with leading lady Aitana Sanchez-Gijon.  From their first gaze, those two
smoldered, and when it comes to swoony love stories, that's what counts. 
_Sweet_November_, a remake of the 1968 weepie of the same name, is a
like-minded film that once again finds Reeves in a part clearly not
suited for him: Nelson Moss, a selfish, flamboyant, workaholic
advertising executive.  The difference here is that there is no romantic
rapport to redeem his woeful work or the film itself.</P>
<P>        The lack of spark should come as no surprise, for Reeves'
_November_ co-star is Charlize Theron, with whom he previously
teamed---and displayed little chemistry--in the supernatural thriller
_The_Devil's_Advocate_.  She plays Sara Deever, the type of kooky free
spirit who always comes into the life of the uptight protagonist not only
at just the right time, but in an oh-so-contrived Meet Cute: they
initially encounter each other as they take a DMV written exam.  Somehow
sensing the stress in his life, Sara makes him an unusual offer: to be
the latest in string of one-month-only lovers.  For a mere 30 days, she
will attempt to make his life easier and give him all the benefits of
having a female companion (read: limitless sex), and in return all he has
to do is devote just about every waking moment of said time period with
her.  Once the time expires, so does their relationship, with no
questions asked, no hard feelings.</P>
<P>        So why exactly does Sara do this?  The trailers and television
spots have made the reason abundantly clear, and there's no reason for me
to spoil the late-in-film revelation for those few still interested in
seeing this film.  But even with her motivation in mind, the premise
seems overly mechanical, not to mention dated.  The modern-day
accoutrements (cell phones, a transvestite neighbor/best friend for Sara)
brought in by director Pat O'Connor and screenwriters Kurt Voelker and
Paul Yurick to update the story actually hurt the film even more.  In
this contemporary context, nothing about Sara (aside from
promiscuity-according-to-schedule) seems terribly eccentric.  She's a
single twentysomething.  She's a pet groomer.  She has a lot of plants. 
She has a fondness for scarves.  How any of these rather run-of-the-mill
qualities can make some ice cold slickster somehow change his whole way
of thinking is hard to swallow.</P>
<P>        Of course, there is the fact that Sara comes in the gorgeous form
of Theron, but this usually capable actress manages to make Sara's
perceived quirkiness less than charming.  Theron tries too hard to be
flighty and daffy, and as such Sara appears to be putting on some forced
act, not to mention a bit too pushy.  Reeves' `efforts' fail to make the
strained attraction any more natural--not that anything about his work in
this film can remotely fall into that description.  His stiff yet
overdone swagger as Norman `A' is ridiculous; try not to laugh when he
lets loose what is supposed to be an evil, mischievous cackle toward his
boss.  With the abrupt change to sensitive Norman `B' comes the flip
side: instead of overdoing it, Reeves reverts to his usual screen
catatonia.</P>
<P>        When it comes to these movie romances, however, chemistry between
leads holds a lot of redemptive value.  Unfortunately, Reeves and Theron
are as tepid together here as they were in their last collaboration. 
They fail to convince that what we are told are growing feelings between
Nelson and Sara are indeed signs of true love, let alone some sweeping,
larger-than-life, world-changing passion.  Considering the film's fairly
effective and unusually (for this genre) understated close, `Sweet
November' could very well have been one primo slice of melodramatic
manipulation with the right pair of actors.  Then again, I imagine that
already happened--back in 1968.</P>
