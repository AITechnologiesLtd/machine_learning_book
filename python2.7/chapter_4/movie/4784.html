<PRE>                            RUMBLE IN THE BRONX
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: First-class acrobatics, second-class
          comedy, a third-class plot.  This is a pleasant
          enough film for sitting back and watching some
          incredible physical feats, but there is little else
          of quality in the film.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Take this review from whence it comes.  I am absolutely floored by
the mental agility of Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS.  The skill
to fight with agility just has never been one for which I have much
appreciation.  I suppose I am about equally impressed with a good
martial artist and a good juggler.  I can appreciate that each can
perform with what appears to be a high degree of skill.  I will watch
each for the moment they are performing and then move on without
envying or even being impressed too much by either.  So perhaps I am
the wrong person to see a Jackie Chan film, whose plot is little more
than an excuse to string together fighting sequences.</P>
<P>     Keung (Jackie Chan) is a prize-winning martial artist in Hong Kong
who comes to the United States to attend his uncle's wedding.  He
quickly discovers that his uncle intends to sell the Asian grocery the
uncle owns.  Keung find himself attracted to the new owner and decides
to stick around and set up the grocery.  This means defending the woman
from a gang of cartoonish bikers who prey on the grocery.  When one of
the bikers steals some loot from some apparent Mafia types, the fight
becomes a three-way battle.</P>
<P>     One of the problems of the script is that Keung's abilities seem
inconsistent and seem to come and go.  It is unclear why in some scenes
he seems so easily defeated and in others he seems unbeatable.  Nor is
it clear why once the street gang has discovered a winning strategy for
beating Keung, they never again use it against him.  Also, we see early
on that he has only limited ability to dodge flying objects, so
presumably he has even less ability to dodge bullets.  Yet while people
threaten to shoot him, nobody actually tries it, even just to disable
him.  The appearance is that even Jackie Chan does not have moves for
dodging a bullet that look convincing on camera and so the scriptwriter
just does not let the situation arise.</P>
<P>     Beyond the action scenes little attention was paid to production
values.  For just about every other aspect of the film the words that
come to mind are "adequate" or "mediocre."  There is little acting in
the film and what is there is intended only to showcase Jackie Chan.
Far more could be done with Chan, of course.  The man has considerably
more screen presence than either Steven Segal or Jean-Claude Van Damme.
This film does what it can to capitalize off Chan's personality, but a
larger budget, a more polished production, and above all a much better
script are needed to make this a really professional product.</P>
<P>     Ironically, the point of the film that generates the greatest
emotions is the closing credits.  Chan shows outtakes where stunts went
wrong.  It combines some of the best laughs of the film with some of
its most poignant moments.  We see two or three cases of actors
performing stunts that go wrong and ending up being put in the back of
an ambulance.  One wonders if this practice does not frighten away
prospective performers from appearing in so dangerous a film to shoot.</P>
<P>     For those who, like me, have only a limited appreciation for
Chan's athletic moves there is not much that this film offers.  For
people who have similar tastes to mine I rate RUMBLE IN THE BRONX a 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
