<PRE>JUDE (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Michael Winterbottom
Writer: Hossein Amini (based on the novel "Jude the Obscure" by Thomas
Hardy)
Starring: Christopher Eccleston, Kate Winslet, Liam Cunningham, Rachel
Griffiths, June Whittfield, Ross Curvin Turnball, James Daley</P>
<P>No, I did not read the novel by Thomas Hardy, "Jude the Obscure," his
final novel (final because this film created such an outrage that he
never wrote again - see: I did do some research on it) about a man who
is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life.  But, after
watching the movie, I can imagine how incredibly depressing it is. 
"Jude" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of
spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system, but what's
remarkable is how timeless this film is.</P>
<P>The film takes place in the late 19th century (or early 20th - wasn't
really sure), but its story could even be retold today in modern form,
although it'd be kinda different (a given).  It tells the story of Jude
(Christopher Eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "Shallow Grave")
- a simple, dim-witted young man with big dreams.  In its bleak,
foreboding opening, shot in grainy black and white, he gets a lesson
from Phillotson (Liam Cunningham), his teacher: as they stand upon a
mountain, looking upon a city in the distance, he says all you have to
do is work hard and you can have anything in the world.</P>
<P>After marrying and divorcing an immature woman named Arabella (Rachel
Griffiths) because they frolicked in the hay (literally) but did not
ultimately share anything in common, he moves away to a town with a
giant university, with a chance to learn more, and get ahead in life. 
Taking a welding job, he works hard while studying constantly for his
college bars, reciting latin over and over again, and training himself. 
But when he sends his application for the school in, he is bluntly told
to just remain a worker.</P>
<P>Another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family
lives there: Sue (Kate Winslet), his cousin and a very intelligent but
kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher.  She and
Jude click eventually and become very endearing friends, so much that
when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice
teacher job (for none other than Phillotson at the local school), there
are rumors that she and Jude did some nasty business (nudge nudge).</P>
<P>Several twists turn in the storyline, and eventually Jude and Sue do do
some nasty business (an interesting scene, to say the least...), and are
soon born into a controversial non-wedlock, as she eventually gives
birth to their baby, and Jude inherits his son from Arabella, who turns
up again after awhile.  Because they aren't married, and because they're
cousins, they run into problems with every place they go to, carrying
around two children everywhere, and only staying in lodges for a very
brief period of time, then moving on.  If you didn't think this was
harsh enough, wait till you see what happens later on...</P>
<P>The sad truth is that Jude is one of the miserable people who can never
get any luck in this world.  He will never gain any true happiness, and
any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting, and will probably
bring more horrible instances to his life.  Part of it is his fault -
he's too optimistic, and too gullible.  But society has a way of taking
these people, and hurting them until their death.  The ending of "Jude"
is bleak because it has to be (although I hear the ending of the novel
is even worse - guess I'll have to read it now).</P>
<P>"Jude" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties, but shows no way
of curing this, and thank heavens it doesn't.  There's no way to
relinquish the selfishness of society, and any solution would be too
small to cure such a mass problem.  Satire has always been one of the
few ways of changing certain people's minds, and that's what "Jude" is. 
Sure, it's one hell of a downer, but it needs to be.</P>
<P>The film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads,
and some good supporting work along with it.  Christopher Eccleston
(slightly resembling Richard Edson with his new look and dumb
expression) plays Jude wonderfully, sometimes bringing a big dumb smile
to his face, and making him kind of child-like at other times.  Kate
Winslet, in a pre-"Titanic" performance, is brilliant, nailing every
psyche of her character, and creating someone who's troubled but very
seductive with her personality.  Kate may be the best actress in her age
group (if you don't believe me, see "Titanic," Branagh's "Hamlet,"
"Sense and Sensibility," and "Heavenly Creatures," the latter one being
my favorite performance of hers).</P>
<P>In the supporting roles, Liam Cunningham is a wonderfully flawed
teacher, exposing all his bad parts, but ultimately being a pretty good
person; and Rachel Griffiths is wonderfully immature as Jude's wife,
whom he never divorces.</P>
<P>"Jude" moves at a very slow pace, and keeps taunting its viewers with
chances of happiness for its protagonists, which would drive some people
nuts.  But those who appreciate good social commentary with their films,
no matter how slow or downright depressing they are (this one is both)
will appreciate "Jude," though I doubt anyone truly enjoys it.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
