<PRE>                             IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS

<P>     John Carpenter is back.  And my, was I scared.  After a long
absence from the screen, John Carpenter does again what he does best
and that is horror movies.</P>
<P>     The story starts very simple: John Trent is a private eye who is
mainly working for insurance companies until he is hired by a
publishing house.  His job is to find Sutter Cane, their premier horror
writer.  Cane is even more successful than Stephen King, his newest book
is late, fans are going nuts because advance orders cannot be
fulfilled.</P>
<P>     From that premise starts a journey into a nightmare.  Yeah, I
know, that's what they tell you about every horror movie.  In this one,
reality is soon mixed with fantasy as Trent and Styles (Cane's editor
at Arcane Books) try to find Cane somewhere in New England (and no,
they don't even go near Bangor, Maine).  People appear out of nowhere
and vanish again, things seem to be changing constantly, there are even
the obligatory "go back, before it's too late" warnings.  Of course,
there is also the unthinkable horror from Beyond.  It soon gets to a
point when no one knows anymore whether this is reality or not.</P>
<P>     And that is the scary part IMHO.  You have no control over what is
happening because you don't know if you dream or are awake.  Something
is happening to you and around you and even though everybody else seems
to be able to do something, you can't do anything to shape your reality
or your fate.</P>
<P>     "Them special effects is fantastic," but what else would you
expect from ILM? The story is rather consistent (if you accept the
basic horror premises :-) and the acting is very good, except for Julie
Carmen.  She only seems to have one face (except for two or three
scenes) and her voice shows absolutely no emotion.  That was one rare
instance when I wished I had watched the dubbed version.  Sam Neill
continues to impress me.  This is the third totally different role I
remember after THE PIANO and JURASSIC PARK and he still comes out
strong.  He's definitely not one-dimensional.</P>
<P>     I watched this movie in a THX theatre (the movie has DTS, so I
probably got a good estimate) and wholly recommed it for a big screen
with DTS.  It is definitely worth the Ecu 6-8 (1 Ecu ~ 1 $) they're
going to charge you.</P>
<P>I give this movie an 7 on the Movie Ratings Ballot.</P>

Oh, and one tiny little personal spoiler:</P>
<P>Charlton Heston does not die at the end of the movie.</P>
