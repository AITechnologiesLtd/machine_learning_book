<PRE>                             DEAD MAN WALKING
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The phrase "wholesome R-rated movie" is usually the 
ultimate oxymoron in Hollywood, but this time it applies. DEAD MAN 
WALKING is an intense human drama about two polar opposites--a 
convicted murderer on death row (Sean Penn) and a nun (Susan 
Sarandon). For once, a Christian movie character is portrayed in a 
good light. The nun is a dedicated, caring woman who helps Penn 
with his eternal struggles despite ostracism and rejection by her peers 
and, most importantly, the parents of the two teens Penn killed.</P>
<P>        Penn writes Sarandon a letter asking for her help and, having 
taken all those vows, she agrees. At first, he acts the part of a 
remorseless convict--refusing to admit he committed the crime, telling 
Sarandon she's lookin' mighty good about now (you'd have to be in 
prison for quite awhile to think that) and spouting off about the Aryan 
nation--but Sarandon's unconditional acceptance eventually gets to 
him and he changes his ways.</P>
<P>        Much of the movie deals with the various court appeals 
Sarandon is involved in on Penn's behalf. Of course, none of the courts 
anywhere along the line will overturn the death sentence ruling and, as 
the days to Penn's lethal injection execution get closer, he has to accept 
the fact that death is inevitable. By the time execution day rolls 
around, the audience has collectively been sucked into the movie and 
truly cares for Penn's character. If anything, DEAD MAN WALKING's 
purpose is to show how even murderers aren't beyond redemption.</P>
<P>        Like I said, there are strong Christian overtones in the movie, 
which was adapted by Tim Robbins (also the movie's director) from 
the autobiographical book written by the actual nun. You'd think ultra-
liberal Robbins and his live-in lover Sarandon, who hijacked the 
Oscars a few years ago to preach against General Electric, would 
produce a more secularized, New Age-ized story, but thankfully, they 
didn't. No matter your religious persuasion, you'll agree leaving the 
story in a Christian context is more powerful than if Sarandon had 
sermonized Mother Earth or the life force to Penn in the face of death.</P>
<P>        DEAD MAN WALKING has the distinction of being the 
movie that almost made me cry (and I was pushed over the brink once 
I learned the concession stand was out of Jujy-fruits). It really is an 
emotionally-charged film that successfully plays on all our human 
tendencies. It's an almost-perfect movie from the movie critic 
standpoint, the only flaw I noticed being Penn's absolutely awful 
coiffure and goatee, which mesmerized me during most of the movie, 
causing enough distractions that I missed the entire second act.</P>
<P>        Now that I think about it, we could have all done without the 
agonizing vocal score that accompanied most of the dramatic scenes. It 
sounded to me a few bushmen wailing in anguish at some sort of 
throbbing pain, perhaps brought on by dental surgery. It caused pain 
for me too. Music this bad should be a form of capital punishment in 
itself.</P>
<P>        The movie wouldn't have been watchable without the 
outstanding performances from Penn and Sarandon, who I'm sure will 
both be nominated along with Robbins at Oscar-time. I saw the movie 
about a month after its original release and the theater was still 
packed, which might have taken something away from my viewing 
experience, because when Penn's life was flashing before his eyes at 
the movie's climax, the person next to me's rank breath was flashing in 
front of my nose. Despite that factor, the goatee and the painful score, 
I still give this movie my wholehearted endorsement.</P>
<P>        I personally don't see why DEAD MAN WALKING has been 
given the R rating. Granted, the f-word is uttered once, but the PG-13-
rated THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT featured the word three times. 
And there's hardly any violence. Perhaps it earned the R rating for its 
inclusion of highly adult themes and overtones. Kids may not be able 
to handle the lengthy death scene at the end of the movie, but DEAD 
MAN WALKING has a strong message for all ages.</P>
