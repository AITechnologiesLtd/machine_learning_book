<PRE>Run Lola Run  (1998)  81m.</PRE>
<P>Guaranteed big-screen crowd-pleaser from writer-director Tom Tykwer: it's a 
welcome change from the Teutonic gloom we normally get imported from Germany 
for film festivals.  Premise reads like a parallel universe joke, but is 
executed like a music video: Vermilion-haired Lola (Frunka Potente) gets a 
panicky phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Mortiz Bleibtreu).  He needs to 
come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes or his life is forfeit.  Using 
only a moment to think what to do, Lola immediately hot-foots it out of her 
apartment to save him.  Energetic, rocket-paced film dispenses with its plot 
in the twenty minutes - as promised - but then whips everything back to 
where it started to replay it a second, and then third time.  It seems that 
everything we do in life is so contrived of the most infinite circumstances 
that this story can replay itself endlessly with infinite conclusions: even 
the people Lola passes in the street have different destinies that are 
compressed to flash by us in seconds.</P>
<P>Despite the threat of assassination that hangs over the proceedings, RUN 
LOLA RUN is very light, and abounds with humorous twists and surprises (one 
hilarious moment finds Lola outside a bank confronted by the police).  
Appropriately, Tykwer has treated the exercise as a game: there is no need 
for us to be concerned about the lives or deaths of these characters as they 
are constantly re-invented.  He also has remixes of the same tune throughout 
the film complementing the 'variations on a theme' storyline.  And, notably, 
the cause-and-effect logic of the story is punctuated by constant collisions 
or near-misses - nearly everyone has a run-in with a car, bicycle, truck, 
ambulance, pedestrian, or stroller as if they were so many hypercharged 
electrons bumping off each other, splitting and merging into their own 
quantum-level parallel universes.  Another admirable element of the film is 
its purely cinematic value - you'll be so caught up in its constant movement 
(of course the only shot of the sky just has to have a passenger jet 
swooping by) that you probably won't even notice the absence of special 
effects.  Using every crane trick, slow-motion, pixillation, camera angle 
and editing device at his disposal Tykwer manages to pull off a highly 
visual treat created almost entirely within camera.  It's prime material for 
some needless, overbudgeted Hollywood remake.  And yes, Lola really does 
run.  Potente must have been exhausted by the time this shoot was over.</P>
