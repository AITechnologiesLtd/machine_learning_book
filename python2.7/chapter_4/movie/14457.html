URBAN LEGEND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>New England's Pendleton College, which according to "U.S. News and World
Reports" is the safest college in America, has trouble brewing.  It
seems there's a serial killer on the loose, who is making all of those
urban legends come to life -- or more precisely to death.  From the
small dog that dies being dried in the microwave to the babysitter who's
getting threatening calls from someone upstairs, the killer has turned
the campus into a lab for enacting the urban legends taught in Professor
Wexler's (Robert Englund) course.</P>
<P>Quite similar to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, from which it borrows
many key plot elements, URBAN LEGEND is a full-fledged member of the
teen-horror-flick genre.  Somewhere there must be a rulebook for these
movies since they all adhere to the same principles.  There will be a
host of attractive college aged kids, most of whom will wear invisible
bulls eyes on their backs.  As the show advances - surprise! -- they
will start dropping like flies.  The killer's face will remain hidden by
a heavy coat, but just about everyone will own a coat exactly like the
killer's.  And most of what makes audiences jump will be good guys who
appear without warning into the scene.</P>
<P>(Now, here is the big secret of ALL of these movies.  I will reveal it
now if you promise never to tell another living soul.  If you tell
anyone else, a person in a heavy coat will pay you a visit. Ready?  The
character with the purest background and the one who appears least
likely to be the killer is always the murderer.  Now, remember that
mum's the word.)</P>
<P>URBAN LEGEND is more concerned with amusing the audience than
frightening it, which is good since it is rarely frightening but it is
sometimes genuinely humorous.</P>
<P>The over-the-top opening is set during a torrential downpour.  As the
thunder crackles, a lone female driver pulls into a gas station run by a
creepy guy (Brad Dourif) with a bad stutter, who's having a bad-hair
day.  He lures her into the office and locks the door behind him.  The
scene then gets so ridiculous that it is hilarious.  Most of the rest of
the movie isn't this funny however.</P>
<P>As the attractive lead, Natalie, Alicia Witt gives the same completely
superficial performance as the rest of the cast.  Jared Leto, last seen
as the lead in PREFONTAINE, plays her boyfriend, Paul, the campus
newspaper's investigative reporter.  Rebecca Gayheart is Natalie's
girlfriend, Brenda.  There are other people in the cast, but they are so
interchangeable that it hardly seems worth mentioning any more names.
To be fair to the actors, the script doesn't call for them to do much.
All of the characters suffer from high degrees of stupidity and bad
luck.</P>
<P>Although director Jamie Blanks just connects the dots, screenwriter
Silvio Horta shows some good comedic flair.  "I dropped journalism
ethics early in the semester," budding reporter Paul tells Natalie as he
burglarizes Professor Wexler's office.  "It wasn't helping my GPA."
Now, there's an honest student.</P>
<P>URBAN LEGEND at its best revels in its ridiculousness.  The campus has
only one cop, Reese (Loretta Devine), and she never calls for help, no
matter how bad the situation gets.  Her gun handling lessons come from
her favorite videotape of Pam Grier in her heyday.  The pudgy Reese is
in no danger of becoming the next Pam Grier, but she doesn't realize it.
Too bad URBAN LEGEND didn't have bigger aspirations than being yet
another horror movie starring teenagers.</P>
<P>URBAN LEGEND runs 1:41.  It is rated R for violence, sex, and profanity
and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
