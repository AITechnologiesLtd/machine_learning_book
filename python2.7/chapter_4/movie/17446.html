<PRE>RAVENOUS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        Make no bones about it, "Ravenous" is one weird motion picture.</PRE>
<P>        Its storyline reads like one of those "Plot or not?" slides shown
before the main feature: "In 1847, a cowardly soldier is exiled to a remote
Californian compound where a Scottish cannibal drops in uninvited for
lunch."</P>
<PRE>        Not?  Guess again.</PRE>
<P>        As far as original story ideas go, "Ravenous" is truly unique.
It's best described as a period cannibal horror comedy, or thereabouts.
Whether or not you can stomach its grisly subject matter for 100
fascinating minutes, one thing is clear: the folks who made this picture,
especially in today's "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" climate, had
guts.</P>
<P>        Cannibalism on any level is never an easy topic, but director
Antonia Bird ("Priest"), screenwriter Ted Griffin, and an absorbing cast
(among them Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy Davies, David Arquette, and
"The Full Monty"'s Robert Carlyle) give "Ravenous" a depth that belies its
jocular "you are who you eat" promotional campaign.  A successful campaign
nonetheless--the preview for this movie, with its blaring soundtrack, has
been running for months, and I was hooked the very first time I saw it.</P>
<P>        A word about that soundtrack.  Co-composed by Michael Nyman
(usually associated with filmmaker Peter Greenaway) and Damon Albarn, the
score for "Ravenous" is one of the most disconcerting I've heard in a long
time.  With its jangling, jarring rhythms and bumpkin levity, the music is
loud when it should be delicate, whimsical when it should be brooding, and
fractious when subtlety would have been the obvious way to go.  Frankly,
it's amazing.  Like director Richard Lester once said: "You've done
everything I wouldn't have done, but it works!"</P>
<P>        Guy Pearce ("L.A. Confidential") plays Capt. John Boyd, a military
officer who feigns death in order to escape an American-Mexican War
offensive.  Castigated by his commanding officers, Boyd is transferred to
Fort Spencer, a desolate outpost in the western Sierra Nevadas where a
party of six dig in for the cold winter ahead.</P>
<P>        One day a disheveled stranger called Colqhoun (Carlyle) appears at
their door, spinning a horrific tale of a terrible storm, a subterranean
refuge, dwindling supplies, and an unthinkable source of fresh meat.  Boyd
and a small company of men return with Colqhoun to the cave and it's then
that the film's supernatural hijinx, and copious bloodletting, kick in.</P>
<P>        That its cannibal theme is played so beautifully straight gives
"Ravenous" much of its substance, its psychological as well as visceral
horror.  Straight, but with a sly sense of humor.  The trailers may stress
the film's comedic element but don't be fooled: the gore quotient in
"Ravenous" is extremely high.</P>
<P>        On the surface, "Ravenous" could easily be dismissed as nothing
more than hocum, yet the quality of the production grants it an eerie
resonance.  Either way, the film deserves high praise for its startling
originality.</P>
<PRE>        It's a smart, gory, and very satisfying comic horror film.</PRE>
<PRE>--
