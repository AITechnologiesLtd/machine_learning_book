<PRE>                           LAST TANGO IN PARIS
                       A film review by Ralf Benner
                        Copyright 1995 Ralf Benner</PRE>
<P>     Two of the best writers in America have written the two most
famous reviews of Bernardo Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS:  Pauline
Kael's "Tango," published in the 10/28/72 edition of The New Yorker
(and reprinted in REELING and FOR KEEPS) and from Norman Mailer for the
5/17/73 edition of the New York Review of Books, A TRANSIT TO
NARCISSUS, changed to "Tango, Last Tango" for his1982 collection of
essays entitled PIECES.  Both reviews may be thousands of words too
long, but each has made some startling comments that we wouldn't be
wrong in guessing the writers now wish they hadn't so emphatically
divined.  Kael calls LAST TANGO IN PARIIS the "most powerfully erotic"
and "the most liberating" movie ever made.  It is, as we know by now,
neither, and in his autobio, Marlon Brando also doubts the worthiness
of such masturbatory praise.  And Mailer cuts the Empress down as "the
first frigid of film critics," which, however badly he might want it
so, isn't true. (If he had intimated suspicions of movie-inspired
lesbianism, citing some of the endless examples of her wet panty
descriptions of femmes, and noting that she was once married to a gay
filmmaker, his sarcasm might have been at least funny.) Of the two
pieces, Kael's is the more consumable, though minus Mailer's freedom to
repeat the movie's infamous obscenities because, unlike Tina Brown's
New Yorker, William Shawn had to be dragged kicking and screaming into
the slang of the late 20th Century.  And hers more panting: you can
nearly see Kael climaxing on her yellow pad; there's little doubt that
her pen substitutes for Marlon Brando's stick.  The review might have
been more deliciously autobiographical if she had flatly admitted her
zipless encounters; instead, she broadens the sex with no names as
universal passage, which, I'd have to concede, is true in my case, and
one assumes in hers, and perhaps yours, but not the experience of all
others.  Essentially, the piece tells us that we shouldn't fear our
inexplicably seedy biological appetites.</P>
<P>     Mailer's meandering text is a tax on our tolerances but, in the
major surprise of both reviews, he gets to the core problem of the
movie, one Kael doesn't even acknowledge as short coming: Writes
Mailer, "Yet as the film progresses with every skill in evidence, while
Brando gives a performance that is unforgettable, as the historic
buggeries and reamings are delivered, and the language breaks through
barriers not even yet erected--no general of censorship could know
the armies of obscenity were so near!--as these shocks multiply, and
lust goes up the steps to love, something bizarre happens to the film.
It fails to explode.  It is a warehouse of dynamite and yet something
goes wrong with the blow-up...One leaves the theater bewildered.  A
fuse was never ignited." This is the Mailer of choice; he gets right to
it, really sticking it to the hyperbolists.  Then he pulls a typical
macho Mailerism: he tells us that the more serious problem is that the
simulated sex isn't real, it's solo--it's Brando solo.  Well, as I
see it, Mailer, who's preoccupied with his adolescent, perhaps
homoerotic desire to compare his with Brando's--in his book Marlon
explains why Mailer wasn't given the chance--and Kael, who can't get
past her own lust to have Brando plow her, ignore what's even more
obvious: LAST TANGO IN PARIS was originally conceived as and remains
a story about two men.</P>
<P>     In their frenzy to be as hip as the participates of the sexual
revolution of the 70s, when the white class mirrored gay promiscuity,
Kael and Mailer avoid--either by design or rare involuntary
nescience--what's patent: that Marlon Brando's Paul and Maria
Schneider's Jeanne are the improvised heterosexualization of quickie,
nameless male-only sex, which came long before Erica Jong's discovery
of zipless joy.  What other way is there to make sense of the
debasement? Buttering up Jeanne's tempting ass isn't exclusively a
purge of Paul's torments--as Richard Schickel suggests in "Intimate
Strangers"--it's what he most likely desires for himself.  And Jeanne's
fingers no doubt an unsatisfying phallic substitute.  As the
degradation continues, Paul finds that he's falling in love with
Jeanne, but it seems more an escape than revelation of love through
sleazy eroticism.  What could he love about her that isn't a lifetime
of repressed regrets?  It's the finale that reduces the movie's punch,
and, where Kael implicitly approves, Mailer explicitly finds it
objectionable, as he should, pointing out that Paul's death is the same
death that concludes the original conception of LAST TANGO IN PARIS.
Through improvisation, to make sense of the death within the perimeters
of loose scripting and acting, Brando and Schneider try to legitimize
Bertolucci's retribution.  The damnedest thing happens: Paul is
punished for finding love.  It might have worked had Paul met his match
in another man; he'd be both unable to accept his attraction yet also
be so sexually heated by what he may be repelled by.  It could then be
possible for Paul to consciously or subconsciously want his nameless
lover to kill him as a means to resolve what he has no other way of
resolving.  Schickel calls his solution "heroic."  Death as answer to
unfulfilled love or desire isn't genuine heroism but waste.</P>
<P>     Kael and Mailer avoid Jeanne's line to Paul: "You hate women."
That's not to say she's calling Paul a homosexual, but coming close to
what he may be feeling at the moment--despairingly misogynistic: his
wife a two-timing hag who has just committed suicide, his wife's mother
a religious fool, his wife's friends are whores (one looking like
Barbara Jefford) and losers.  Brando improvises Paul as angry failure:
when he says not exactly to but of his wife's lover, "I wonder what she
ever saw in you," it's recognition of self-disgust.  Jeanne also calls
Paul an "egotist," and he certainly is--smitten by the exciting dangers
of dominance: when Jeanne, in an elevator, lifts up her dress to reveal
her love mound, it's practically a daughter's incestuous teasing of Big
Daddy.  (Vittorio Storaro captures this sexual inflation when his camera
scans Brando's huge neck and a not quite self-satisfied smile of
perhaps a sadist, or when showing Brando's menacing back: in white
T-shirt, it looks to have built-in the curvatures of a nuclear power
station's smoke stack.)  For some, their infantile, petulant, dangerous
fantasy will be highly eroticizing, and in Jeanne's case, as Schneider
plays her, it's honest: the underlining complexity of what appears to
be simple nameless sex overtakes her; she's at once liberated by yet
also fearful of the powers of primal urges.  Her accelerated animalism
pops up in sudden but correlative ways: in a subway with her young
fiance, she quarrels with him and they slap at each other, only to fall
in each other's arms.  The movie bogs down when Jeanne's movie maker of
a boyfriend intrudes, but during these sequences, we gaze at Schneider,
who's like a slimmed down Rubenseque Claudia Cardinale as child of
trash; her baby face is without defining features--her sinuses seem to
have a grass-induced puffiness--and her boobs, despite Paul's
prognostication of their future, already ready for the soccer field.
Mailer's macho gets it right:  Schneider "has nose appeal--you can
smell her."</P>
<P>     But not the right scent for Brando.  Everything about his Paul
reeks with malice towards women.  It's clear he's on the run from the
rancid aromas of the bitches in his life; his need for raunchy
degradation confirms it.  This kind of emotionalism engenders
unexpected, unsolicited sex--often between men.  And not solely
homosexual men: sex between otherwise straight men is probably a matter
of accidental timing, happening when all the extrinsic elements of
situations beyond their control merge.  A long time friend once
remarked that a "stiff joint has no conscience," and some thirty years
later, that truism is stronger than ever: no matter our moralistic
prejudices and "nevers," there's no way we can ever be sure how we'll
respond when the adrenergic forces of circumstance and sex take charge,
when the flush of a bulge takes charge.  (One of the most powerful
erotic impulses of gang banging is that men follow and experience the
heat generated by the first bangers--they're turned on by each other,
not the receptacle of their emissions.)  Brando says in his book that
the role of Paul was so emotionally draining that he'd never want to go
through that kind of pain again, and while you believe it, you have to
ask: just how honest is his creation?  About LAST TANGO IN PARIS,
director Ingmar Bergman said, "As it is now, it makes no sense as a
film.  I don't think it's really about a middle-aged man and young
girl, but about homosexuals.  If you think about it in those terms, it
becomes interesting."  I'd argue that the movie isn't about gays--it's
about a sensualist's idea of two men meeting and fighting to the death
their attractions to one another.  This might explain Brando's
drainage: he's invested so much heavy-weight improv on top of a shaky
foundation that his house of character collapses.  Brando goes as far
into improv as he'd allow himself to go; any further and we'd all spill
over into uncontrolled derision because his sublimation feels
dishonest.  We keep thinking that, despite his mastery of the creative
self-consciousness of his acting, which might also be the exposure of
the dissipation caused by the burden of real-life regrets, he's saying,
"I can't go that far, I can't give you what seems clear about Paul."
Kael suggests that Brando is photographed looking "ravaged, like the
Francis Bacon painting under the film's opening titles."  He's ravaged,
all right, and as sadistic, but not nearly as sexually disjunctive.  (It
is the second Francis Bacon painting used during the credits that is
more intriguing: the figure sitting on a wooden chair, with arms and
legs crossed, looks to have been the inspiration for the caricature
drawn of Kael for the 8/14/80 N.Y. Review of Books demolition job done
on her by Renata Adler.)  And, despite a debauched appearance suggesting
the early stages of gluttony, Brando's voice, getting even smaller and
more limited as the weight increases, doesn't lend itself to the
unrestricted framework of improv; it needs as much discipline as it can
get.  While Larry King's recent ninety-minute interview with Brando was
occasionally amusing--especially the fast slipping in of an
eight-letter naughty and the concluding kiss--it proved the actor isn't
capable of impromptu lies: he told Larry he's never been depressed and
one look at him tells us otherwise.</P>
<P>     Despite Mailer's once-held belief that the future of movies is in
improvisation, no one would loves them as an eclectic art form could
possibly wish for a steady diet of meaninglessness and hyped emotions
on rampages--we're getting more than enough of all of this on the news
and talk shows.  There are reasons why improv works for comedy: the wit
and speed of the generators must attempt to match the speed and danger
of the moment.  Audiences are also much more forgiving of performers
when their out-of-nowhere comic responses don't quite connect; in
drama, we can be very unforgiving when improvising is less associated
with realism of the moment than it is with shock values: Brando
mumbling an obscenity about God is decidedly fraudulent.  Despite of
LAST TANGO IN PARIS being hailed as a masterstroke of improv, I think
Bertolucci confirms that the only way drama, especially sexual drama,
can be permitted free association is by the appearance of spontaneity
that is in fact rehearsed and LAST TANGO IN PARIS is very.  As movie
makers, Mailer and John Cassavetes are experimental ruffians;
Bertolucci has the controlling sensibilities of a real artist, even if
he defrauds his own "breakthrough" subject matter.</P>
<P>     A more luxuriantly decadent metropolis than Paris is
inconceivable; the city vibrates with sensual willfulness without
requisite guilt--it demands you liberate yourself and shrug off any
need for penance.  And Paris of fall and winter is especially
invigorating and impulsive--its chill creates a buffer between you and
all the encroachments of daily living and tourists.  While Bertolucci
and Storaro capture the wintry freedom of anonymity, viewers will end
up preferring that they had used Paris more expressively--their idea of
the city seems to be one too many metaphorical bridges to nowhere--and
had refrained from the soft vaginal-toned colors because a dull glaze
eventually seeps over our eyes.  Helping the sex-loaded ambiance
immensely is Gato Barbieri's music--the surprisingly libidinous,
anticipatory romanticism of the violins and piano co-mingling with the
horny, jazzy sax; it's so swooningly concupiscent that it lifts you to
levels the movie only promises to get at.</P>
<P>     Some twenty three years after the fact, it can be posited that
Kael and Mailer produced false births--Bertolucci having pulled his
diapers over their privates, about which both writers believe they
impart intellectual substance.  How Bertolucci must still be laughing
at their whipped up verbosity and supposed candidness, although he
can't discount the effects of their orgasms on the box office, or
refrain from using Kael's in ads and as accompanying text to the
movie's laser disc packages.  In Kael's N.Y. Times excoriation of
Mailer's MARILYN, and partly a response to Mailer's piece on LAST TANGO
IN PARIS, which was partly a response to her review of the movie, she
wrote:  Mailer is "cut off from respectability, like our country; the
greatest American writer is a bum, and a bum who's starting not to mind
it.  The time to begin worrying is when both he and the United States
start finding virtues in this condition; we could all end up like
drunks doing a music-hall turn."  Re-reading their reviews of LAST
TANGO IN PARIS, that's close to how we end up feeling about the both of
them: these two overcompensating pugilists have been going at each
other for so long that it's we readers who feel punch drunk--reeling
from the absence of the perceptive simplicities and confidences they
somehow failed to slug each other with.  But real autobiography has
never been Kael's strong suit and Mailer's public contretemps and
betrayals are blamed on the bottle.  Our most provocative cultural
arbiters didn't deliver the goods: LAST TANGO IN PARIS is still a dance
of death between two men.</P>
