<PRE>        Dear Ma,</PRE>
<P>        After seeing Steve Buscemi's sophomore directorial effort, The Animal
Factory (following 1996's Trees Lounge), I nearly reconsidered choosing
film criticism as a career path.  For the first hour of this film, it
seemed the way to go was to become a convict.  (By the way, ma, they
don't call 'em inmates in the pen, they call 'em convicts.)</P>
<P>        Puffy faced Edward Furlong plays young Ron Decker, a new convict in the
pen.  He's small, skinny and smart -- an ideal candidate to become some
solid's girlfriend.  Fortunately, he is befriended by Earl Koper (Willem
Dafoe, sporting a clean, bald head) and his gang of old-timers.  This
more or less prevents the kid from getting raped, though Earl admits
that he wouldn't have bothered if the kid was ugly.</P>
<P>        Prison life seems pretty swell at first.  There are no women, but the
men all pat each other on the back, are loyal to their friends and call
each other "brother."  They get three squares a day and if they've been
inside long enough, the guards give them freebies like steak dinners,
extra packs of cigarettes, or porno magazines.  Life isn't so bad on the
inside as long as you got friends.</P>
<P>        I was all set to phone up my boss at filmcritic.com and hand in my
resignation when Tom Arnold showed up on the scene as a hillbilly
scumbag whose first act of malice is to suck on his own finger and shove
it up Furlong's bum.  Suddenly, prison life didn't sound so lovely
anymore.  This is before the razor action in a later sequence where one
of our main characters gets sliced up pretty good.  Violence can spring
up at any time in the joint.</P>
<P>        This adaptation of Edward Bunker's novel knows the prison lingo
backwards and forwards.  Bunker was in prison himself, and it shows. 
(He's now a fine, hard-boiled novelist and played Mr. Blue in Reservoir
Dogs, opposite Steve Buscemi.)  The grimy cellblocks and hallways,
filthy mattresses, and lousy food all seem to have been well researched
here, present and correct.  Buscemi fills his film with paranoia, often
inserting shots of convicts looking over their shoulder or shifting
their eyes.</P>
<P>        Buscemi the filmmaker trips up by turning the prison playground into a
showcase for his actors.  Dafoe and Furlong are excellent in the lead
roles, thinking their way through each scene.  Thing is, they're
surrounded by people who are sinking their teeth into their roles (and
scenery) so much that each scene plays like a vaudeville number.</P>
<P>        The spotlight is on Mickey Rourke as a mealy-mouthed drag queen, then
on Tom Arnold's aforementioned renegade hick, then on Seymour Cassel's
"guard who's seen it all" character.  Instead of blending into a fine
ensemble, each actor's shining presence only serves to remind us that
this is only a movie.  We're not in a jailhouse; we're in a talent show
for the best and brightest in the "Intense Character Actor" category.</P>
<P>        It's entertaining, sure, but it destroys the authenticity.  Suddenly, I
realize I'm not really in a prison.  I'm in an independent film directed
by Steve Buscemi.</P>
<P>        As though driving the nails into his own coffin, Buscemi even steals
the 360-degree pan from Reservoir Dogs in one shot.  Tarantino's film
was filled with pop cultural references, reminding us that we were
watching a movie, and it worked in that context.  But Buscemi, instead
of going for cinema verite realism, throws in this flashy camera move. 
It's pretty tactless, here.</P>
<P>        These blunders don't kill the movie.  The relationship between Dafoe
and Furlong is touching, drifting through a no man's land between being
father/son or lovers without sexual congress.  Dafoe schools the kid on
the prison ropes.  Furlong keeps his eyes and ears open.  While I found
it hard to believe that a boy as pretty as Eddie Furlong wouldn't wind
up as someone's dinner, I struggled to suspend my disbelief because
there are some fine, subtle glances between these guys that resemble
love.  I'm a sucker for romance, even in prison.</P>
<P>        This key plot point treads on the verge of sentimentality, but the
grand finale lapses into the familiar terrain of Prison Movie 101.  Of
course we have the obligatory "let's get out of prison" bit.  Buscemi
and Bunker (whose novel is terrific, by the way -- much grittier than
the film) blow their opportunity to leave well enough alone.</P>
<P>        The Animal Factory is rarely boring, though.  For all my qualms about
Buscemi's directorial flourishes and self-conscious moments for the
actors, he's made a movie that at least cares about developing those
characters within their environment.  At least it observes these people
in their daily routine, takes it's time to let us get to know Earl, Ron
and all the rest.  It's not as raw as it would like to be, but it's sure
got character.</P>
<PRE>        I tell ya this much, ma: Steve Buscemi has given us a solid.</PRE>
