<PRE>LES MISERABLES</PRE>
<P>Starring Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes</P>
<PRE>Written by Rafael Yglesias</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Bille August</PRE>
<P>If you go into LES MISERABLES with the expectation that the Valjean or 
Fantine or any of your other favorite characters are going to burst into
song, you're in the wrong place.  This umpteenth version of Victor Hugo's
classic morality tale is not, I'm sorry to say, the long-awaited screen
version of the famous Broadway musical.  It is rather a well-intentioned,
if bloodless, dramatic version: a top drawer production, made by an
internationally-renowned director, populated by A-list Hollywood stars who
know their way around a period drama.  It is full of acts of heroism, grand
ironies, tragic falls and stunning acts of repentance- all the elements
which have made the novel such a gripping read to each successive
generation.  So why does it ultimately leave such a dusty taste in the
mouth?  For all the artistry that went into its making, this LES MISERABLES
is missing something.  Passion?  Spice? A little of the old Grand Guignol? 
It's hard to say.  This version flirts with greatness, but as any high
school lothario can tell you, flirting is not the same as scoring.</P>
<P>Just in case you missed out on reading the Cliffs Notes for your Sophomore
English report, here's the short version of the story.  Liam Neeson stars
as Jean Valjean, a convicted thief who is released into 19th Century France
after spending 19 years at hard labor.  After an encounter with a kindly
Bishop whom he tries to rob, Valjean becomes a changed man, and nine years
later he has become a prosperous businessman and the mayor of the city of
Vigau.  The fruits of success turn bitter upon the arrival of the new
Prefect of Police, Javert (Geoffrey Rush), a fanatically moral man who was
a prison guard during Valjean's incarceration.  Javert knows Valjean's
origin, and becomes obsessed with denouncing him as a convict.  Meanwhile,
Valjean becomes caretaker to a dying woman named Fantine (Uma Thurman), who
was forced into prostitution after Valjean unwittingly had her fired from
her job at his factory.  Valjean, now a kindly soul, promises Fantine that
he will care for her daughter Cosette, whom she was forced to leave in the
care of cruel foster parents.</P>
<P>Soon Javert's unrelenting pursuit of Valjean forces he and Closette into
hiding in Paris.  Another decade passes, Cosette grows up to become Claire
Danes,  Valjean has taken on another new identity, and Javert has become
the Chief Inspector of the Parisian police.  Cosette's love affair with the
fiery revolutionary Marius (Hans Matheson), brings Javert back to Valjean's
trail, and the hunt begins anew.</P>
<P>Literary purists will no doubt chafe at the liberties taken with the novel,
the absence of key characters and the reduction of Hugo's deeply complex
leads into their lightweight Classics Comics doppelgangers.  But let's face
it, as literary adaptations go, we've all seen worse.  Anybody recall the
hatchet job Demi Moore wrought upon THE SCARLET LETTER?  Critics have
called this story a 19th Century version of THE FUGITIVE, which is unfair-
after all, Hugo came first.  Sure, the book is a lot more complicated, but
you can hardly fault screenwriter Rafael Yglesias for focusing on Javert's
obsession with Valjean.  As depicted here, Javert is a 19th century
Terminator, programmed by law and damnable pride to bring Valjean to
justice no matter who is destroyed in the process.  This central conflict
is as good a place as any for a filmmaker to hang his hat, and there is
ample opportunity to forge great cinema from this rich source material.</P>
<P>Yet Bille August's film misses the mark.  Why so?  You can't blame Liam
Neeson; his Valjean is yet another variation of the character he has played
for most of his career: the mythical, larger-than-life hero whose most
valuable possession is his honor.  Oskar Schindler, Rob Roy, Michael
Collins, even Briar Gates from that old Patrick Swayze dog NEXT OF KIN-
they're all the cut from the same cloth, really, and Jean Valjean is part
of the same heroic tapestry.  I still say Neeson would have made a better
William Wallace than Mel Gibson, but I suppose I'm in the minority.</P>
<P>No, if I have to pin it down, I'll blame the film's failure on a singular
lack of an emotional arc to go along with the story line.  I can't blame it
solely on the script or on the direction, so let's just say both are at
fault.  Valjean is simply kind and brave, when he should be a tragic figure
haunted by the demons of his past.  Javert should personify those demons. 
This leads us to a serious misstep on the part of August and Geoffrey Rush.
 Fresh from his showy performance in SHINE, Rush seems determined to
underplay Javert.  Where madness and fiery passion are called for, Rush
gives us quiet restraint; instead of functioning as Valjean's tormentor, he
comes across as that one guy in your circle of friends who nobody likes but
who nobody can seem to get rid of.  This wrong decision is carried clear
through to the final confrontation between the two men on the banks of the
Seine, which is an utter failure.  Hugo knew better than to end his story
there, and the filmmakers should have know better, too.</P>
<P>But I'll still recommend the film, because it provides an easy introduction
to Hugo for those who have never read him, and who might like to after
seeing the film.  Besides, I'm a big Liam Neeson fan- he was the right
choice for the lead, and he more than carries his weight.  My only other
complaint is that, like all Hollywood costume dramas, this one suffers from
a smorgasbord of accents: everything from Neeson's Irish brogue to the
cockney-sounding peasants to Claire Dane's affected English boarding school
accent.  I suppose this solution is better than having everyone speak like
Inspector Clouseau.  The brave choice, of course, would have been to film
it in French with subtitles.  But in Hollywood, that has about as much
chance of happening as a comet striking the Earth.  Oh, I forgot- that
movie opens in a couple of weeks.</P>
