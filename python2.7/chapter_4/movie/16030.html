<P>Life can be manipulating.  Really?  Thanks for telling us that.  The
question is whether it's for bad or good.  How many times have you been
coaxed by a friend who's twisted your arm to do something you didn't
really want to do at first but later on you were glad that you did?
What's so bad about that? Politicians manipulate us and later on we're
often sorry that we voted for them.  Product placement ads on television
and the movies manipulate us by planting subliminal thoughts in our
heads, enticing us to buy their brand and there are many entertaining
advertisements and a lot of stupid ones as well.  'Patch Adams' is
easily recognizable as a manipulative film but it feels good and
therefore it is good.</P>
<P>Many question the sincerity of the medical community.  The true nature
of tackling major diseases and curing them raises economical questions
rather than ethical ones.  A cure for cancer, AIDS and many other
diseases means billions of dollars lost for the pharmaceutical companies
in existing medications and treatment.  1/7 of the American economy is
driven by medicine run as a business rather than as a humanitarian
effort and many cannot afford to pay and they die.  It's refreshing to
see a film that treats medicine with humanity and with delicate grace
and humour that can make human suffering a little easier and since its
based on a true story, it has even more credibility.</P>
<P>Robin Williams redeems himself in this film after the disappointing
'What Dreams May Come', released earlier this year.  Beginning in 1969,
Williams plays Hunter Adams, nicknamed 'Patch', a man who brings
humanity to his patients by using humour as a treatment for those with
fatal diseases and other serious ailments.  As the film begins, Adams is
a voluntarily patient in a mental institution and finds that he has a
positive influence on some seriously catatonic patients and finds he
wants more and decides to check himself out of the institution and into
medical school.  The medical students are driven in the wrong direction
by the chief of the medical program (Bob Gunton) who actually tells a
group of them in class that he will take the humanity out of them and
make doctors out of them!  Shame on him!</P>
<P>He meets other medical students who become his close friends and he has
a relationship with a female student (Monica Potter) that he's sweet
on.  The elder instructors feel that Adams' methods are unorthodox as he
dresses up in funny clothing, makes jokes and improvises his way through
the hospital wards and tries to make the sick and the dying feel
better.  Adams and his friends open free clinics, take supplies from the
wealthy hospital in secret and aren't supposed to see patients at all
until the third year and Williams has a clash of ideals that leads to a
bumpy road that may prevent him from graduating.</P>
<P>Director Tom Shadyac ('Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', 'Liar Liar') proves
he can handle a touching and human story as well as he can a shallow
comedic film and while Williams is allowed to invent a lot of his own
routines, I think a lot of movie fans will appreciate it as vintage
Robin Williams and few have a better balanced career that the one
Williams has carved out for himself.</P>
<P>The film is based on the book 'Gesundheit: Good Health Is a Laughing
Matter' by Hunter Doherty Adams and Maureen Mylander and is adapted for
the screen by Steve Oedekerk who keeps his writing fresh and alive and
has some good observations and gives the film social commentary and
something that audiences can take home with them and think about.  My
father doesn't smile much but did so sincerely after seeing this film.</P>
<P>'Patch Adams' is no classic but given the fact that the film will be
attacked by many as manipulative, those same people enjoyed and
recommended Williams' 1989 film 'Dead Poets Society' which was far more
manipulative than this film and 'Dead Poets Society' won an Oscar for
its writing!</P>
