<PRE>Disoriented</PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: **1/2 (out of 4 = okay/average)</P>
<P>1999, no MPAA rating, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[drama]</PRE>
<P>Starring: Francisco Aliwalas (West Cordova), Potri Ranica Manis (Mrs. 
Cordova), Wayland Quintero (Eduardo `Danger' Cordova); produced by Douglas 
Bachman; written and directed by Francisco Aliwalas</P>
<P>Seen May 13, 1999 at 9:10 p.m. at The Spectrum Theatre (Albany, NY), theater 
#5, by myself for $7. [Theater rating: ***: good seats, picture and sound]</P>
<P>[Critic's note: This film is about as independent as they come. It's so small 
that it hasn't been picked up by a distributor (yet) and it's not even listed 
on the Internet Movie Database. The director grew up and went to school in 
Guilderland, N.Y. which is only a few miles from Schenectady where I live. </P>
<P>        According to information I've read on some film festival web pages, 
Aliwalas went to film school at Rochester Institute of Technology and shot 
this film in Albany and Guilderland sometime in 1996 or 1997 (although 
there's no specific references to the date and location of the story). 
However, I'm using the release date of 1999 just to maintain some kind of 
continuity.</P>
<P>        In April, Aliwalas lent the film to The Spectrum Theatre (the only 
arthouse theater in the Capital District) to be shown as a regular movie. The 
first few showings he held question and answer sessions about the film, which 
I'm ashamed to admit I missed. The film played there for about a month and I 
didn't have time to see it until its very last showing!</P>
<P>        Anyway, I'm hoping that by reviewing the film and posting my review 
on the Internet it will get more attention and possibly a listing on the 
IMDb. The only problem is I haven't been able to get a copy of the complete 
cast and crew (my apologies to all those I missed).]</P>
<P>        If we're to believe what the movies tell us, drama only comes in a 
few shapes and forms, with those being on really big scales and of events and 
emotions so major and powerful they're the kind that can only happen in 
movies. But then there's `Disoriented,' a film that's pretty small in just 
about every way, but has a quaint charm to it, showing that powerful drama 
(or sometimes melodrama) can be found at the local level.</P>
<P>        Drama is probably the easiest genre to work with as a first-time 
filmmaker on a tight budget because it doesn't require special effects or a 
lot of props or fantastic scenery (and yes, that old cliche is true - it's 
harder to do comedy than drama). Rookie filmmaker Francisco Aliwalas probably 
realized this and put together a story that could be told and filmed entirely 
in the Capital District of Albany, N.Y. </P>
<P>        Aliwalas himself stars as West Cordova, a 20-something-year-old 
Filipino-American who's a struggling pre-med student living at home with his 
overbearing, conservative, traditional Catholic mother (Manis) who obviously 
hasn't so much guided him in life as she has pushed him. The two live in a 
section of their city that's not where the people well-off would live, but 
isn't the crack slums either. West works part time as a deliverer of Chinese 
take-out while his mother is a maid at a sleazy motel. </P>
<P>        Aliwalas is quick to establish the setting of the story, giving us 
that feeling that things haven't been and probably won't be easy for this 
family. We also learn that Mr. Cordova left the family 10 years ago for a 
younger woman and the other son, Eduardo `Danger' Cordova (Quintero), who was 
a sports prodigy in high school, hasn't been seen in a while either.</P>
<P>        The film's first act does a fine job in establishing all the problems 
and conflicts in West's life, and most of them will pale in comparison to 
what will happen to him later on in the story. The first thing the film is 
able to convey well, and what is one of the most important aspects of the 
theme and atmosphere, is just how overbearing West's mother is. Some might 
say she's in a state of denial about the family and the problems she faces on 
a daily basis, but it's not so much that factor as it is her upbringing. She 
comes from a different culture and can't really comprehend modern American 
society, so she sticks to the traditions and values she knows.</P>
<P>        Mrs. Cordova's character is surprisingly easy to relate to because 
she doesn't just represent culture clash but generational clash, which is 
something everyone can relate to. </P>
<P>        And with clash comes conflict and in the case of this film it comes 
in the form of the return of Danger who is still as seemingly jocular as 
ever, but with one major change - he's gay.</P>
<P>        Instead of launching right into emotional battles between Danger, 
West and Mrs. Cordova, the film decides to take it slow as West convinces his 
brother to remain closeted while he stays at home for a week or so. There are 
a few occasional outbursts between Danger and his mother, but they serve 
mostly as transitions from scene to scene and remind us there's a heavy 
dramatic tone to the mostly-lighthearted film.        </P>
<P>        And yes, the film is rather lighthearted in the midst of the drama. 
Although the tensions between the Cordova family are the biggest thematic 
element, a few other sub-plots crop up which are at least interesting. The 
best of these is a friendship which develops between West and another 
Filipino man named Speedy Sparkles, who owns and runs a car wash. The two 
seem to have a natural bond immediately and when Speedy begins offering West 
pieces of sage advice it doesn't seem out of the ordinary. However, their 
mentor/protege relationship seems to move a bit too fast. It's hard to 
believe that two strangers would be so nice to each other, especially in the 
way it's filmed here which seems like something out of `Sesame Street.'</P>
<P>        Another interest sidebar is West's meeting and fascination with a 
Japanese girl named Minniko, who also meets and gets to know just by being 
very nice. Minniko doesn't have much direction in life either other than she 
wants to be a model and more American. She even puts up with an obnoxious, 
almost racist boyfriend named Manny which doesn't seem to make sense. Later, 
when West tries to win her over, the two never really seem attracted to each 
other. Their friendship or allegedly romantic relationship has a very forced 
feeling to it. Perhaps they come together out of loneliness, yet there's 
still an absence of chemistry.</P>
<P>        For a film that has such a good mix of characters, conflicts and 
overall situations, the execution of the story is surprisingly weak. Perhaps 
Aliwalas gets in over his head by having so many dramatic sub-plots and other 
sidebars that the only way to resolve every conflict is through melodrama 
(specific examples of this would serve as spoilers to those who haven't seen 
the film, but let's just say they're things that have been done before and 
seem out of place here).        </P>
<P>        Every character is so perfectly poised to knock down at least one 
other character it's just a bit too much to swallow. And when things do 
finally come to their individual climaxes the drama, which had been tight, 
believable and realistic all along, takes a turn for the melodramatic in what 
seems to be efforts just to please the audience. The [happy] ending is pretty 
much proof of this.</P>
<P>        Although `Disoriented' has some problems, they are forgivable for the 
most part. Even during the times of sheer and pure drama for the sake of 
drama, the film consistently remains interesting to watch and does through in 
a few surprises here and there.</P>
