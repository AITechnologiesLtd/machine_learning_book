<PRE>                                TABOO (GOHATTO)
                        A film review by Jonathan Curiel

<P>It's been 25 years since Japanese director Nagisa Oshima shocked
international audiences with In the Realm of the Senses, his lurid look
at a sadomasochistic couple that loses all abandon and commits a carnal
act never before captured on the big screen: one lover cuts off the
other's penis.</P>
<P>New Yorker Films is hyping the similarity between Senses and Oshima's
latest work, Taboo, saying the new film, "like... Senses, deals with the
anti-authoritarian sway of sexuality, a nearly taboo subject in Japan."</P>
<P>Don't believe the hype.  In many ways, Taboo is the antithesis of Senses
-- from its lack of sexual explicitness to its historic setting in 19th
century Kyoto.  Where Senses captures the hedonistic life of a
heterosexual couple, Taboo showers us with androgyny, same-sex
yearnings, and macho sword fights, all in a samurai setting that tests
the characters' moral and physical strength.</P>
<P>In the enclave of an all-male militia designed to protect the Shogun,
does it matter that some of the men sleep with each other?  "Don't ask,
don't tell" takes on new meaning with Taboo, a movie that works so well
because it's filled with characters like Toshizo Hijikata, an agonized
samurai captain played with aplomb by Beat Takeshi.  Takeshi, a director
in his own right and a comedic TV star in Japan, is the heart and soul
of Taboo (and gets top billing).  Takeshi's aging captain struggles to
accept the fact that a newly recruited teenage samurai is fooling around
with a fellow recruit, and that many of the other samurai are in love
with the teen.</P>
<P>>From the opening scene, that teen withstands his new profession's
vicissitudes, which require him to execute dishonored militia and kill
those who would kill him.  The young samurai (newcomer Ryuhei Matsuda)
has banged hair, pale skin, feminine lips -- and biceps big enough to
handle the swords and knives he needs to defend himself in bed and on
the streets of Kyoto, where dangerous thugs walk around.  His reason for
joining the samurai is clear: "To have the right to kill," he tells an
inquisitor in the samurai headquarters.</P>
<P>Phalli are never shown in Taboo, and why should they be? Taboo isn't a
film about sex -- it's a film about Japan's last samurai and the way one
person can have a dramatic effect on those around him.  With a film
score by Ryuichi Sakamoto (best known for his Oscar-winning work on The
Last Emperor), and outfits and backdrops that show off the beauty of
pre-modern Japan, Taboo is another new film from Asia that deserves
considerable attention.  It may not feature the stunning martial arts
scenes or operatic storyline of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and it
may not have the happy ending of Chunhyang, but like those two period
pieces, Taboo is a visual marvel from start to finish.</P>
<P>Moviegoers are lucky that the 68-year-old Oshima is still around to make
films like Taboo, which was honored at last year's Cannes Film Festival
and is now being released theatrically.  Oshima suffered a serious
stroke in 1996, forcing him to take a three-year sabbatical.  But he has
re-emerged with new vigor to complete Taboo, his 26th film, telling one
interviewer, "I've spent all my life breaking taboos."</P>
