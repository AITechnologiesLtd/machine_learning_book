<PRE>                           COOKIE'S FORTUNE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A gentle crime story set in a sleepy
          Mississippi town has more than its share of
          eccentric but likeable characters.  Robert Altman
          has given us his most relaxing and pleasant film.
          For once we do not care if all the plot strands are
          going to come together or not, this is just an
          interesting set of people.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10),
          high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The South is frequently represented negatively in film and
television, particularly since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
While few even from the South would claim that reputation is entirely
unearned, like anywhere else there is good and bad in that part of the
country.  Most frequently, "Mayberry, RFD" notwithstanding, the views
of the southeastern part of the country have been the unpleasant images
one sees in NORMA RAE and IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT. Some of the
negative stereotypes met and were defeated by a more positive and even
sentimental view in MY COUSIN VINNEY.  MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD
AND EVIL took things a step further and actually portrayed the fancy
section of Savannah as having dignity, charm, and appealing people.
COOKIE'S FORTUNE goes even another step to spread the charm to the
middle and lower middle class.  Holly Spring, Mississippi, the setting
of Robert Altman's new film, seems to have only one unpleasant person.
These people are just a pleasure to watch.  In fact, Altman has finally
mastered a problem that he has had with his films for years.  Altman
makes films in which a lot of individual strands come together in the
final reel.  Too frequently there seems to be no obvious reason for the
audience to follow a strand other than faith that it will become
relevant eventually.  In COOKIE'S FORTUNE his characters are eccentric
and interesting enough, that they would worth watching even if the
strands did not tie together.  This is an amiable film to watch, one
with rich characters and one with frequent chuckles.  We would not feel
cheated even if the various plotlines did not come together.  For that
reason it may be Altman's film best coordinated with his style.  Even
without the important messages of NASHVILLE or THE PLAYER, it may be
Altman's most successful piece of art.</P>
<P>     Holly Spring, Mississippi is one of those sleepy towns where the
sun takes three days to come up and five to go down.  The only thing
that is complex about Holly Spring is the leading family's family tree.
The leading citizen is Cookie, legally known as Jewel Mae Orcutt (hey,
Patricia Neal is still acting).  Cookie has a modest fortune, but her
close companion Willis Richland (a show-stealing Charles Dutton) is
afraid that she might be getting a little *too* eccentric.  One of the
most touching things about this film is the platonic, cross-racial love
that these two have for each other. Then there are Camille Orcutt
(Glenn Close) and her pet human Cora Duvall (Julianne Moore)--sisters,
and nieces to Cookie.  Camille absolutely dominates the dim Cora,
though Cora was married once (hence the different surname) and had one
child, the town's scandal, Emma Duvall (Liv Tyler).  Emma has had a
checkered past and is also the town's leading criminal--flagrantly
disregarding parking laws as she delivers fresh catfish to local
restaurants.  This makes things difficult for her current boyfriend and
lover Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell), the only young policeman in town.
All the rest of the police seem old enough to be his grandfather.  When
Cookie decides it is time to move on and commits suicide, Camille sees
this as her chance to get her fair share of Cookie's fortune.  She also
wants to avoid the stigma of having a suicide in the family, so tampers
with the crime scene to make the suicide look like a burglary and
murder.</P>
<P>     In the end, the plot of COOKIE'S FORTUNE seems a little contrived.
But at the same time it is beguiling.  In what are generally considered
to be Altman's best films he nevertheless talks down to his audience.
There are frequently laughs in an Altman film, but in THE PLAYER the
laughs are cynical and cold.  Here they are richer and not at all
mean-spirited.  It is the old distinction between laughing with someone
and laughing at him.  For once Altman's message is simply "kick off
your shoes and enjoy people."  That might make this the best and
ironically the most important film he has ever made.  I give it an 8 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
