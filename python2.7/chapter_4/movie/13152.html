<P>REVIEW: Welcome to Sarajevo
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Cast: Stephen Dillane, Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei, Emira Nusevic,
Kerry Fox, Goran Visnjic, Emily Lloyd, James Nesbitt
Director: Michael Winterbottom
Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce, based on the book "Natasha's Story" by
Michael Nicholson</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: June 25</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</PRE>
<P>If any film has perfectly pitched exactly the right characters for both
Stephan Dillane and Woody Harrelson, Welcome to Sarajevo would be it.
Both as arrogant yet genuinely devoted reporters; Dillane sums up both
of their roles with the smug quote  "We're not here to help, we're here
to report."  Sadly, they both end up woefully incomplete performances -
Dillane's due to the film's disoriented script, Harrelson's because of
limited screen time.  Perfect in concept perhaps, but all over the place
in execution (chalk that down for a good description of the film also).</P>
<P>Shortly after the opening credits, we witness a group of citizens on
their way to a wedding.  Unexpectedly, one of them is shot dead by an
unseen sniper.  The press are there in no time, working from a
distance - taking photographs and pointing cameras.  Led by Michael
Henderson (Dillane), these brave reporters scour the streets of
Sarajevo, searching for stories that will not only fare well in ratings
but also bring home a powerful message that something needs to be done.</P>
<P>They soon discover that the western world is concerned with other
matters, illustrated when their report comes in second place to Fergie's
divorce.  And when UN troops arrive in the war-torn city, one soldier
offers little inspiration by pointing out that "Sarajevo is only the
14th most dangerous place on Earth."</P>
<P>Welcome to Sarajevo will no doubt find an audience of content critics
and audiences alike, who will no doubt dub the film as a powerful,
horrifically realistic documentary.  I grudgingly agree to some extent
with that statement - the film is powerful and realistic - but only as a
documentary.  When director Michael Winterbottom attempts to incorporate
an emotional core to the story - subsequently distracting us from his
Big Political Message - most of the strength he builds in the film's
opening half hour is lost.</P>
<P>I cannot understand why on Earth Winterbottom could let the plot decline
so severely - maybe this is due to the film's writing (based on the
novel "Natasha's Story"), but even then, Welcome to Sarajevo could have
been anyone's story and still have worked well.  The maverick American
journalist Flynn (Harrelson) would have made a great central character;
whilst cameraman Gregg (James Nesbitt) and native driver Risto (Goran
Visnjic) are at times very intriguing to watch.  This is not to say that
the main character in the film, Henderson, is not wonderfully
portrayed - he is - but his tale is not conceived enough to have a
lasting impact.</P>
<P>The emotional core of the story is centered on Henderson becoming
personally attached to a young orphan, and whilst this is potentially
riveting stuff, the benefits of a well-written screenplay simply are not
here. Frank Cottrell Boyce (and the novels author, Michael Nicholson)
has written a complex, beaming documentary but a crumbling, apathetic
drama.  Welcome to Sarajevo tries too hard to be a contemporary film -
Winterbottom has made sure that it has clear-cut film "necessities,"
with a definite focal story and obvious supporting roles.  Ironically, a
documentary type creation would have been much more successful for this
kind of subject matter.  There was no need for a focal story when there
were countless civilian lives to explore, and no need to define a main
role when every journalist character had a fascinating story to tell.</P>
<P>For a film that pitches at the right note but executes way off mark, we
can perhaps respect the fact that Welcome to Sarajevo may have been
victim to mainstream cliches had it fallen on lesser hands.  But Stephan
Dillane is just too talented for this type of work; ditto for Woody
Harrelson and Michael Winterbottom.  All may have their heart in the
right place, but Welcome to Sarajevo is a film that pitches but not
hits, thus drastically reducing the impact of it's Big Political
Message.</P>
