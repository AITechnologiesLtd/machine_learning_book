<PRE>Summer of Sam</PRE>
<P>Spike Lee directs a movie set in the summer of 1977, the year in which the
Son of Sam conducted his killing spree. If you are not a fan of Spike Lee,
this movie will not change your mind. Its inherent faults are shared with
many of his other movies, especially its cumbersome length and unsatisfying
ending. Despite its title, _Summer of Sam_ is really the story of a guy
named Vinnie who looses control of his life at the same time David Berkowitz
looses control of his. Berkowitz is portrayed brilliantly by Michael
Badalucco, while Vinnie is John Leguizamo in fine form. I think this
dichotomy of title and story is what hurts the movie the most. While
Vinnie's story is very interesting, it is nowhere near as interesting as
that of the Son of Sam. There are many scenes involving Berkowitz that,
while powerful, distract from the main story. Speaking of which, Vinnie's
problems are twofold. First, he can't stop cheating on his wife, played by
Mira Sorvino. Second, his best friend and he have grown apart and some in
the neighborhood think the friend is the killer. Not a bad plot, but Lee
can't seem to narrow his focus. He crowds too many side stories into the
movie, diluting its powerful main story. As an aside, Mira Sorvino once
again portrays a good woman put upon by those she loves -- Sound familiar?
Sorvino is a very good actress, but I am sick of her playing the same
character in every movie. She should try playing a villain or, at the very
least, someone a bit bitchier. In the end, this movie was compelling, but
not satisfying. Lee has shown a talent for interesting characters and
situations, but he has rarely  been able to deliver a good movie. In his
case, the parts always seem better than their sum.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Fair</PRE>
<P>Ratings go like this: Abominable, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, and
Perfect. As you might guess, most movies are Fair to Good. Very few movies
are either Abominable or Perfect.
