<P>   The best chapter in a particular college textbook I was
assigned on the uses of the English language deals with how
the different social classes use words.  The upper and lower
classes are surprisingly alike.  Referring to a container for
flowers, uppers and lowers say "vayze" while the middle
classes use the more pretentious pronunciation "vahz." 
Uppers and lowers say "couch" while the middles say "sofa." 
These differences extend to possessions (within limits of
course) with the very rich and the rather poor driving plain,
older cars while those in the middle manuever late-model,
fashionable vehicles.  Why is this?  I suppose the reason is
that the really wealthy are well established: everyone knows
who they are.  They do not have to prove anything, to be
ostentatious.  As for the lower orders, as the principal
character in "A Merry War" reports, "They have nothing to
lose so they can always tell the truth."</P>
<P>   Which brings us to the movie.  "A Merry War," based on an
early (1936) novel by George Orwell called "Keep the
Aspidistra Flying," is somewhat autobiographical, based on
the young Orwell's wrestling with his own political and
philosophical beliefs.  "A Merry War" is actually about two
raging conflicts: one is between a young man and his woman
friend; the other is between the young man and...the young
man--an internal conflict.  George Orwell at the time could not
quite make up his mind whether he was a radical or a
conservative, so he converted his interior struggle to art.  In
the novel Orwell has the man debating with himself.  In the
movie, directed by Robert Bierman from Alan Plater's
adaptation of the novel, the interior struggle becomes an
ongoing debate between the man and a woman.  </P>
<P>   The film is an absolute delight, as the middle classes would
say (or would it be the uppers)?  Though it takes place in the
London of 1934, it is technically exceptional, splashing all the
color and ambiance of the great city photographed on some
unusually sunny, rain-free days.  Though its very subject is
political and philosophical, there is no mention of the rising
threat of Nazism just across the channel in Germany, nor is
there much sign that the Great Depression is having all that
much impact in England.</P>
<P>   The story centers on Gordon Comstock (Richard E. Grant),
a highly successful advertising copywriter whose boss,
Erskine (Jim Carter), tells him that his copy for a cereal
product has caused sales to rise 17%.  The graphics are
provided by Comstock's woman friend, Rosemary (Helena
Bonham Carter), who works with him in the same office and
whose art work gets along with the verbiage far better than
she with he.  One day Comstock decides that he has had
enough of this life as a sellout writing doggeral for banal
commodities and, determined to be a full-time poet and a
"free man," he quits his job, takes a thoroughly respectable
flat near his new job in a bookstore, and stares daily at the
uptight landlady's apidistra plant--which symbolizes middle-
class respectability, neatness, order, and conformity.  Though
his poetry is turned down by almost every publisher, he gets a
sudden windfall from a magazine in "our colony in California"
of $50 which he blows in one night of drunken partying with
Rosemary and a wealthy publisher friend, Ravelston (Julian
Wadham).  After a drunken scandal which lands him in jail for
a night, he is left pence-less, takes a filthy flat in the sordid
Lambeth district together with a job in a scuzzy bookstore,
and declares that he is happy living with friendly, but
sometimes violent people who are the antithesis of bourgeois
respectability.  </P>
<P>   Much of the film deals with an ongoing debate between
Comstock and Rosemary, a controversy that often scales
witty slopes that would make Oscar Wilde proud.  While
Rosemary, like most English women, would like to live a
respectable, middle-class life with a steadily employed man
and kids, she is constantly put off by what she considers her
boy friend's oafish insistence on being free, disreputable,
noncomforming and messy.  Their arguments are pursued in
Comstock's bug-infested digs, in the neat and clean office of
the advertising agency, in the publisher's pied-a-terre which
finds Comstock's friend frequently in the company of his
mistress Hermoine (Lesley Vickerage), and in a posh
restaurant where Comstock and Rosemary are amusingly
patronized by a haughty waiter.</P>
<P>    "A Merry War" is the antithesis of all-American
blockbusters like "Armageddon" and proves, as many a witty,
cultivated film can, that less is more.  You need not go to
London's fringe theaters or to New York's off-Broadway stage
companies to find such a regard for words as you'll get with
"A Merry War."  Here you're not dealing with high-priced
publicists that try to see you a movie that will knock your
socks off or scare you out of your wits.  Films of this nature
are not products which are doled out by commercial outfits
who are in the game only for the buck and who have
contempt for their audience which, they believe, cannot
separate the wheat from the chaff.  Apropos, during the
"slum" phase of Comstock's life, he praises one type of
commercial transaction where neither the seller nor the buyer
is getting ripped off, where each side knows exactly what it's
getting.  He relates the tale of the guy who collects horse
manure and sells it to people who use the stuff to make their
gardens grow.  "They're buying and selling shit," as he
describes this honest transaction.  "Nobody has any illusions." 
Utilizing excellent performers like Richard E. Grant in the role
of Gordon Comstock, Helena Bonham Carter as Rosemary,
and Harriet Walter as Gordon's put-upon sister Julia, director
Robert Bierman has done George Orwell proud by projecting
outward the novelist's inner conflict about class and caste,
fashioning an intriguing, quick, touching and sometimes
venomous movie.</P>
