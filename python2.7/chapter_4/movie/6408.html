<PRE>                                LOCH NESS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     LOCH NESS is a joint UK and US production that has had staggered
openings all of Europe this year.  It was scheduled to be released
theatrically in the US two months ago, but has already made its way to
network television, showing this past Saturday.  Our family was all
ready to see it in Paris this summer until we found out that they had
dubbed into French rather than using subtitles.</P>
<P>     LOCH NESS is a family film about a monster hunter named Dr.
Jonathan Dempsey (Ted Danson from THREE MEN AND A BABY).  Having
vacationed near Loch Ness and having looked for Nessie ourselves, we
were intrigued to see how the movie would approach the canonical
mysterious monster of our time.</P>
<P>     As a travelogue that will make the Scottish Board of Tourism
proud, the movie is a success.  The cinematography by Clive Tickner is
full of sweeping grandeur.  I attribute that less to Tickner's skills
than to the countryside's inherent beauty.  It would be hard to make
the Scottish Highlands in and around Loch Ness look any other way.</P>
<P>     Dr. Dempsey is the cliched impoverished scientist with all his
bill collectors after him.  He has spent his life chasing freaks of
nature.  As he says, "I'm a joke.  I'm the guy who chases Looney
Tunes."</P>
<P>     His boss, Dr. Mercer (Harris Yulin from LOOKING FOR RICHARD),
wants him to take the world's most sophisticated equipment to Loch Ness
to disprove Nessie exists.  His orders to Dr. Dempsey are, "I want you
to not find the monster.  I want you to use state of the art equipment
to prove that it's not there."  The prose by John Fusco (YOUNG GUNS) is
stilted and lifeless.  This is somewhat ameliorated by the beauty of
the Scottish tongue when Dr. Dempsey gets to Scotland.</P>
<P>     Once there, he comes to live in a hotel run by Laura MacFeteridge
(Joely Richardson from I'LL DO ANYTHING and Anita in the upcoming live
action 101 DALMATIANS).  She insults him in a way that indicates she is
falling in love with him.  Her daughter Isabel (played by newcomer
Kirsty Graham) forms an immediate kinship with Dr. Dempsey.  Graham and
to a lessor extent Richardson are the only actors in the film that stay
awake.  The others sleepwalk through their performances, perhaps none
more so than Ian Holm (BIG NIGHT) as the mysterious and brooding local
named Water Bailiff.</P>
<P>     "You couldn't find a dinosaur at the bottom of a whiskey glass,"
says Dr. Dempsey's assistant Adrian Foote (James Frain).  Considering
the skills Dr. Dempsey displays, I agree.  He relies mainly on dumb
luck for his discoveries.</P>
<P>     Thinking he may have found Nessie becomes an aphrodisiac for the
doctor so he jumps Laura in the kitchen.  Of course, this being a PG
show, her daughter walks in just as the action is starting to get
heavy.</P>
<P>     The intense violin music by Trevor Jones is a romantic complement
to the lovely scenery.  First time theatrical director John Henderson's
film works only as an atmospheric pageant of travel shots.  Ask your
neighbor to show you the slides from his last trip to Scotland and skip
this meaningless film.</P>
<P>     LOCH NESS runs 1:41.  It is rated PG, and the version shown on
television has no sex, nudity, violence, or bad language.  The show
would be fine for kids of any age although I do not see why anyone
would bother.  On the other hand, my son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, gives the
film five thumbs up.  I give the film a thumbs down and rate it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
