<PRE>                             THREE COLORS: RED
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Irene Jacob, Jean-Louis Trintingnant, Jean-Pierre Lorit.
Screenplay:  Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz.
Director:  Krzysztof Kieslowski.</P>
<P>     Welcome to that annual year-end tradition, "Guess Which Foreign
Language Film Gets Jobbed By the Motion Picture Academy Rules."  Every
year the Academy claims it's trying to make the qualification
requirements more fair; every year, it seems they come up with more
restrictions than the Book of Leviticus.  Politics and arbitrary
interpretations continue to rob the category of worthy nominees, and
this year will be no exception: RED, the third installment in
Krzysztof Kieslowski's extraordinary THREE COLORS trilogy, has been
rejected as an entry from Switzerland.  The Academy should rectify that
slight immediately and nominate it as one of the best films of the year
in any language, a beautiful, resonant work that is the best of three
very good films.</P>
<P>     RED stars Irene Jacob as Valentine, a young student and model
living in Geneva.  Her life takes an odd turn one day when she hits a
dog with her car, and attempts to return it to its owner.  But the
owner, Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis Trintingnant), appears less than
concerned about the dog, or much of anything for that matter.  A bitter
retired judge, Joseph spends his days alone in his home listening in on
his neighbors' cellular telephone conversations.  At first Valentine is
disgusted by Joseph, but eventually the two develop a curious
friendship as Valentine learns about the tragedies of Joseph's life.</P>
<P>     As with the previous two installments in Kieslowski's trilogy, RED
represents one of the three principles behind the French tricolor.  Red
is for fraternity, but as was also true of BLUE and WHITE, the
treatment of that theme is far from the obvious.  While on one level
RED is about the friendship between Valentine and Joseph, it is also
about the way all lives interconnect, about a fraternity of all
humanity.  A parallel storyline involves a young lawyer named Auguste
(Jean-Pierre Lorit) who is preparing to become a judge, and his
relationship with his girlfriend (Federique Feder).  Gradually it
becomes clear that this story is meant to mirror events in Joseph's
life decades earlier, and it appears that they will be equally tragic.
However, Kieslowski and his co-screenwriter Krzystof Piesiewicz use
these two stories to show how redemption operates in its own time, and
how chance occurrences connect lives in ways which can't possibly be
expected.</P>
<P>     This brings up the question of whether it is necessary to have
seen BLUE and WHITE to fully appreciate RED.  I feel irresponsible
discouraging seeing this film in even the slightest manner, because it
has so much to offer on its own merits.  The production design is
stunning, and Zbigniew Preisner's score again provides amazing depth.
Irene Jacob, who starred in Kieslowski's THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE,
gives an incredibly sensitive performance as Valentine, who finds
herself on an unexpected journey of moral discovery.  She is matched by
Jean-Louis Trintingnant's Joseph, and their scenes together are
something truly special.</P>
<P>     That said, I truly believe that there are layers of RED which are
best understood when viewed through the lens of the complete trilogy.
For example, both BLUE and WHITE feature a scene where an elderly
person struggles to place a bottle in a recycling bin.  The scene
appears in RED as well, but in this case Valentine recognizes the
struggle and helps the old woman.  And in RED's emotional climax, the
lead characters from all three films appear, and an understanding of
what those other characters have been through to end up together makes
the scene infinitely more potent.  That is what makes RED so special:
it has a scope and a heart which, when combined with BLUE and WHITE, is
truly breathtaking.  This is the work of a filmmaker at the height of
his creative powers, which makes Kieslowski's announcement that he is
retiring a genuine tragedy.  RED stands independently as a great film;
the three colors together create a miraculous tapestry, one of the
great film experiences of the decade.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 couleurs:  10.</PRE>
