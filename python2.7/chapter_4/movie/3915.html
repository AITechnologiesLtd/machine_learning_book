<PRE>                                  BABE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: BABE is reminiscent of CHARLOTTE'S
          WEB, but more on the level of E. B. White's book
          than the weak film adaptation.  This is one of
          those rare family films that may be better
          appreciated by adults than by children.  If you
          wouldn't be caught dead going to a film about the
          adventures of a talking pig, you will miss one of
          the most enjoyable films of the year.  Rating: +2
          (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     These days you hear the terms "children's film" and "family film"
used interchangeably.  The film industry may intentionally blur the
distinction so that some adult will drop in to see their children's
films.  They do not want to admit that even a "Rainbow Brite" film or
MY PRETTY PONY might not be enjoyable or even appropriate for any adult
with more neurons than fingers.  But the result is that good family
films that have plenty to offer adults are seen only by children and
the parents who bring them.  Very often my wife and I find ourselves in
a theater the only adults not accompanied by children.  And it is a
pity.  This week I have seen WATERWORLD, CLUELESS, and BABE.  Of the
three films, the one with the biggest laughs, the most impressive
special effects, and the best story was BABE.  The story should be
enjoyable for anyone in a wide range of ages.  That range goes from
adult down to any child old enough to realize and accept the reality
that today's cute farm animal and tomorrow's dinner may be one and the
same.</P>
<P>     The story opens with the young pig, still nursing, telling us
about the wonderful "pig paradise" where pigs go when the big trucks
come and carry them away.  Already we have a wry little dig at religion
and this family film is just moments old.  The runt of the litter is
given away to a small carnival where he is to be both the subject and
the prize in a "guess the weight of the pig" contest.</P>
<P>     The contest winner is Farmer Hoggett (played by James Cromwell),a
pensive and quiet farmer who sees something special in this particular
pig.  His wife Esme (Magda Szubanski) sees something special in the pig
also, a nice holiday dinner.  In this world all the farm animals talk
to each other; they just don't talk to humans.  Babe, as the pig comes
to be called, falls in with and is provisionally adopted by two Border
collie sheep dogs.  Fly, the mother collie, has just sadly watched her
new pups given to strangers and she feels like adopting something new
to care for.  This is not a film to sugar-coat sad facts of life for
farm animals.  While the film does not dwell on these aspects or let
them spoil the fresh and funny comedy, the film is honest enough to
show that farm life can be painful for animals.  Fly needs Babe as much
as Babe needs Fly and we hear it in her voice.  Eventually Babe will
follow Fly and her mate Rex into the sheep-herding task.  Comic relief
is provided by Ferdinand, a street-smart and wise-quacking duck with a
propensity for causing trouble.  While some of his humor and mischief
may be inspired by Donald Duck, he still is an original character and
his mischief motivated by a very real fear of ending on the Hoggett
dinner table.  One convention is carried over from cartoons--the duck
has many of the funny lines.</P>
<P>     The visual effect of talking animals is not done by cartooning the
mouths as is so often done, and not by filming animals chewing peanut-
butter-like gum as was done with Francis and Mr. Ed.  Instead
animatronics from the Jim Henson shop are used to have lip-movement fit
the words and to provide facial expression.  A careful eye can tell the
real animal from the mechanical one--some of the time--but there are
certainly some scenes that should leave even expert effects spotters
wondering how they were done.  The screenplay was written by George
Miller (known for the "Mad Max" films) and Chris Noone.  Noone directed
and Miller produced, working on this project for seven years.  Miller
and Noone have a good feel for where to economize in the production.
The only familiar face in the film is James Cromwell and he has usually
been a minor actor.  No big name actors voice the animals, though
Roscoe Lee Brown narrates.  The score is by Nigel Westlake who simply
reworked classical themes sometimes to great effect.</P>
<P>     Hearing what BABE was about, I probably would not have wanted to
see it.  Even hearing positive reviews did not convince me.  But the
one or two film clips I saw were such a pleasure to watch that I was
convinced.  And certainly there was a great deal more to enjoy than
what the clips showed.  I rate this a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
