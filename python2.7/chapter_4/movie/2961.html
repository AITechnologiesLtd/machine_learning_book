<PRE>                                PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The film begins and ends with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her
guy, Pumpkin (Tim Roth), a couple of petty thieves who, after mulling
over the risks of holding up various and sundry types of retail
business and banks hit upon the bright idea of robbing the very
restaurant in which they are having breakfast.  Think of all the
wallets.   Thus begins the film which encompasses and interlaces three
stories of small-time crooks in a send up  of movies about that
gangsters.  There are more laughs than killings but with plenty of
each.</P>
<P>     Marsellus Wallace, (Ving Rhames), the boss, has instructed Vincent
Vega (John Travolta) to watch over his wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), while
he is away on business.  The last goon to have baby-sat Mia ended up
dead so Vincent is less than thrilled with his assignment.  Before that
is over, Vincent goes through a deadly series of frantic events which
for us, the audience, are hilarious.</P>
<P>     Elsewhere, there is Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), an upcoming
prizefighter being instructed to take a fall in his next fight.
Willis, it should be noted, is becoming more and more believable as an
actor.  In Pulp Fiction, he outdoes himself.  In this segment he is
helped by Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) who, with a straight face,
relates to Butch (as a child) the very weird story of how the captain
came into possession of a pocket watch which he is turning over to
Coolidge.  Fabienne (Maria De Medeiros) is Butch's girlfriend.</P>
<P>     There is still another story that threads its way through the
film.  This one involves Vincent and Jules (Samuel L Jackson).  While
Travolta is perfect as the crook who seems to get into all kinds of
trouble without looking for them, it is Jackson who runs away with the
film.  Last seen in FRESH, here he really takes over as the
Bible-quoting criminal who suddenly sees the Hand of God and wants
out.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel excels as Wolf in a short but very funny bit.  Eric
Stoltz is the drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette is his wife.</P>
<P>     While each of the stories is of the silly kind and what happens
now crisscrosses with what happened earlier, it all adds up to a most
enjoyable movie.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino.</P>
