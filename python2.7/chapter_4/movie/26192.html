<P>Out of all the rip-offs of Wes Craven's instant 1996 classic "Scream" and 
including it's sequels, only two really stood out as being original. The 
first was 1997's "I Know What You Did Last Summer" which was followed by a 
lame sequel, and the second is 1998's "Urban Legend" which went on to gross 
more than $38 million dollars, a nice sum for a low-budget horror film. Of 
course the ending left it open for a sequel, but one would hope they wouldn't 
make one. Surprise...they did anyway, and this time it has nothing to do with 
the original, well it does, but it doesn't. </P>
<P>Amy Mayfield is a student at the Alpine University, majoring in film. She 
worked on a few of somebody elses, but her main goal is to make her own 
movie. After hearing a story about a university, where the students were 
murdered based on Urban Legends, she herself decides to make a movie called 
what else? Urban Legends. Everything goes well, her film starts production, 
but when she finds a reel of film she didn't make, showing a murder, Amy 
starts to suspect something isn't right. Once the people working on her 
production start to get killed in the style of urban legends, Amy knows there 
is a killer after her, and she has to try to stop him before he gets to her.</P>
<P>Of course there is the usual refereces to urban legends, and the plot 
developments of the story. Wait...we're missing something, oh yeah character 
development duh! I should have known that, but wait where is it at? Oh yeah 
there is none! Thats the biggest flaw of the entire movie, is the lack of 
character development. When the movie first starts, we go into a comedic 
opening sequence, and are introduced to the characters, of course we know who 
they are as in names, and we know what they do, but we don't know anything 
about them. </P>
<P>In her first starring role, Jennifer Morrison, is great as the film student 
Amy. She brings out the most she can of her character, and does a credible 
job of playing her. Matthew Davis is in dual roles, as the bland 
Travis/Trevor, and doesn't really add much to the film, except a gratitous 
sex scene. Joey Lawrence is pointless in his role, but adds much to the comic 
relief. The two or actually three biggest standouts of the movie is the 
George Lucas fan duo, Michael Bacall and Anthony Anderson are extremely 
funny, and add much to the film, but not much to the story. Finally Loretta 
Devine is the standout of the movie, and should get much credit to saving 
this movie from being a bust.</P>
<P>The direction by John Ottman is very stylish, and since he is an editor and 
composer, he of course, edited and composed this movie. Both are very nice, 
and the score is a standout, when this dvd comes out, I would like to see a 
isolated score, just to hear this, because it adds much to the tight 
atmosphere. The movie itself, is never scary, excluding one scene that has to 
do with the tub, ice and kidney. This was very gruesome and quite intense. 
John Ottman did a good job on the techinal well-making, that he forgot to add 
more excitement and suspense.</P>
<P>Overall the movie is entertaining throughout, and merits at least one watch. 
The killer is fun to guess, and I was surprised at who it was, although the 
motive is laughable. At the end, they change the slasher ending into 
something different, and the end of the movie before the credits role, I 
thought was extremely funny and very clever. The standout scene of the movie 
is the end, and at the end of the movie, I turned to my friend and said "That 
was ok, nothing special, but nothing bad". It deserves one watch, if not two. 
It really has nothing to do with the original, and really is pointless, but 
for what it's worth it isn't that bad. </P>
