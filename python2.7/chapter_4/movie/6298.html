<P>    LARGER THAN LIFE, the comedy that puts Bill Murray on the road with
an elephant (!), almost warranted a walk-out, but not because this
particular pachyderm played in the odious OPERATION DUMBO DROP.  Rather,
it was the number of children in attendance that left my companion and I
unable to relax in our seats.  (Upon entering the theater, Waverly Place
in Cary, we were dismayed to discover bare walls.  Without stereo sound
to drown out the inevitable noise of an underage audience, the situation
was rapidly approaching lose- lose.  Did I mention the dried vomit on
the seat in front of us?) Happily, the brats were well-behaved, though I
doubt that any of them appreciated Bill Murray's character of a smarmy
motivational speaker.  (His motto, obviously modeled after multiplex
managers, is "get over it.") They came to see an elephant and, oh, what
an elephant it was!  Vera, as she's called in the movie, can bow and
play dead and do almost any trick, except perform a rewrite on Roy
Blount Jr.'s clearly understocked script.  In fact, no human that Mr.
Motivation meets on his cross-country trip to California-- to sell Vera
to either a zoo-keeper (Janeane Garofalo) or an animal trainer (Linda
Fiorentino)-- is particularly funny, not even the manic trucker Tip
played by an unrecognizable Matthew McConaughey.  Critters watching
critters notwithstanding, LARGER THAN LIFE is best enjoyed as another of
Murray's feature-length slow burns.  And stay awake for the movie's one
great scene, when Murray tries to drive a big rig.  Hilarious.  </P>
