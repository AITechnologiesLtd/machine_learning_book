<PRE>'Boogie Nights'</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>The amount of vice contained within 'Boogie Nights' serves as a profound 
statement on the culture of the 1970's, perhaps the most decadent in American 
society this century.  It's about the lowest common denominator in society's 
diversity but has a gradually progressive look as it spans six years from
1977 to 
1983.  It's an examination of the pornography business and its seedy side 
undoubtedly comes through not as gratuitous but as a well defined and artful 
statement about seduction through fast money, drugs and an illusion of the 
what the 'good life' really is. </P>
<P>Beginning  in 1977 in California's San Fernando Valley, Mark Wahlberg plays 
Eddie Adams, a busboy in a disco dance club who meets the key player to his 
turbulent and sometimes successful future, a pornographic filmmaker named 
Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds).  Horner approaches him one night in the kitchen 
as he's performing his nightly duties and tells Eddie he sees him as a
future star 
in the business he excels in. </P>
<P>Convinced of his future success, Eddie comes up with a show business name 
"Dirk Diggler" and his career begins.  Other key players in the film's
complexity 
are a female porno star, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) in the film's best female 
supporting performance, Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), Little Bill
(William H. 
Macy), Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and the film's best male supporting 
performance in Buck Swope (Don Cheadle).  Each character has a goal and a 
dream to live up to.  Amber has a young son who she is trying to see in life
after 
divorce, Buck has dreams of owning his own stereo store and the others are 
less goal driven but are still fascinating characters.  It has a scene where
Horner 
is told as the 80's are about to begin that pornographic films will become the 
property of the videotape industry and Horner says he will not stoop to making 
videos because he is a "serious" filmmaker which brought out a few laughs 
from the audience with whom I saw this movie. </P>
<P>The film's writer and director (Paul Thomas Anderson) has molded a film out of 
a relatively unknown cast who are known more to movie fans instead of casual 
movie goers.  It is a good comeback role for Burt Reynolds whose career has 
been sagging for years.  Anderson's direction is sure footed and built on a 
command of subject material which looks as if it was carefully written and 
researched in detail. </P>
<P>This motion picture is unlike any I have ever seen before.  It starts slowly
and 
focuses more on solidifying its message in the second half and the film's last 
half hour is its most powerful.  But that isn't what makes it so strikingly
original.  
Its adult theme is countered by its convincing message that what you're 
watching isn't porno but a Hollywood production which stands up as academic 
gold.  There are scenes where the cast is involved in filming the porno scenes 
where their acting is extremely bad and for good actors to act bad when they're 
supposed to adds a dimension of talented creativity.  Their lives change 
drastically as the film winds down and the final scene is shocking if nothing 
else but you should see it coming.  One of the best films of 1997 and a likely 
candidate for a Best Picture Oscar nomination. </P>
