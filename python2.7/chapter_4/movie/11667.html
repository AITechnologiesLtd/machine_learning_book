<PRE>WILD THINGS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Wild Things is a movie that prides itself on its deviations, both from
sexual norms as well as a plot as we know it.  This thriller is
overflowing with sex, violence, twisting relationships, and
double-crosses to the point that it becomes a mere parody of itself and
loses any lasting impact.</P>
<P>Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is the guidance counselor at the high school
in the rich Florida yachting town of Blue Bay.  He is beloved by most of
the students, until one of them, rich girl Kelly Van Ryan (Denise
Richards) accuses him of rape.</P>
<P>Two cops, Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne
Rubin-Vega) are assigned the case.  Kelly's mother, Sandra (Theresa
Russell), who has had her own relationship with Sam in the past, is out
for blood, bringing in lawyer Tom Baxter (Robert Wagner) to ruin Sam's
life and career.  She also uses her considerable influence to pressure
Ray and Gloria to find Sam guilty.</P>
<P>Ray, however, seeks for the truth in an unlikely place.  A white trash
girl, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), with whom Ray has tangled in the
past, may hold the key to Sam's guilt or innocence.  But are her motives
pure?</P>
<P>There are so many twists, turns, and double-crosses in Wild Things that
the movie becomes unintentionally hilarious.  It reminded me of the
cartoon in which predator and prey keep unzipping their costumes,
reversing the situation ad infinitum.  The audience can only take so
much of this before abandoning the suspension of disbelief and any sense
of seriousness about the film. Then again, any movie which stages a
crucial courtroom showdown with Bill Murray as one of the attorneys
doesn't take itself all that seriously.</P>
<P>The film is chock full of predators (a fact which the film hammers in
with repeated gator sightings in the Florida swamps).  Each character,
though, is a predator, and (like in the aforementioned cartoon) it is up
to the audience to determine who is the prey.  This gives nearly every
main character a chance to play both the good guy and the bad guy, so,
while the audience may get lost, the actors sure look like they're
having a good time.</P>
<P>Still, the film would have been better if it declared its intentions
(without necessarily untangling its twists) as to whether it's trying to
be serious or not.  The film straddles the fence on this issue, and as
it stands, it is either a mistimed comedy or a poorly staged drama.</P>
