                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     FOUR ROOMS, a four-segment anthology directed by independent film 
darlings Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and 
Quentin Tarantino, has to be one of 1995's major disappointments.  
Perhaps it's the format itself -- twenty minutes isn't enough time to 
develop much in the way of characters or story.  When Martin Scorsese, 
Francis Ford Coppola, and Woody Allen tried a similar structure for 
their ill-fated 1989 offering of NEW YORK STORIES, "flop" was the most 
commonly heard description.  More problematic than the format, however, 
is FOUR ROOMS' execution.  Shoddy acting and direction typify three of 
the segments (Robert Rodriguez's being the exception).  Even Tim Roth, 
one of the best actors of the '90s, has his weak moments.</P>
<P>     FOUR ROOMS takes place on New Year's Eve at the Mon Signor Hotel, 
one of Los Angeles' most notorious dives.  Ted the bellhop (Roth) has 
just joined the staff and is in for "a really bad night."  Ted is the 
glue that holds the four stories together as he moves from room-to-room 
and problem-to-problem.  Roth, with an accent that unaccountably fades 
from American to British, plays Ted like a cross between Jim Carrey and 
John Cleese. </P>
<PRE>"The Missing Ingredient"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10):  1.0</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Roth, Valeria Golino, Madonna, Ione Skye, Sammi Davis, 
      Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, Amanda De Cadenet
Written and Directed by: Allison Anders
Cinematography: Rodrigo Garcia</P>
<P>     By far the most lame of FOUR ROOMS' stories, "The Missing 
Ingredient" lacks anything resembling intelligent dialogue, coherent 
plotting, or competent acting.  This trite mess is easily the low point 
in the short career of writer/director Allison Anders, whose 1992 
release, GAS FOOD LODGING, was a positive triumph.  "The Missing 
Ingredient" plays like an R-rated episode of a bad TV sitcom, with 
profanity, bare breasts, and sex failing to liven things up.</P>
<P>     The story -- what little there is -- revolves around a witches' 
coven trying to resurrect the spirit of a stripper.  All the ingredients 
(mother's milk, virgin's blood, sweat of five men's thighs, and a year's 
tears) are ready except for a sperm sample.  Since witch Eva (Ione Skye) 
failed in her assignment to bring this vital component of the mixture, 
she is charged with seducing Ted and getting what she needs from him.  </P>
<PRE>"The Wrong Man"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10):  2.5</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Roth, Jennifer Beals, David Proval
Written and Directed by: Alexandre Rockwell
Cinematography: Phil Parmet</P>
<P>     Unlike many reviewers, I wasn't a big fan of writer/director 
Alexandre Rockwell's debut feature, IN THE SOUP.  While the film 
contained several instances of insightful comedy, the entire production 
seemed self-indulgent.  It's doubtful, however, that even those who 
heaped effusive praise on IN THE SOUP will have many kind words for "The 
Wrong Man".  This totally unfunny segment places Ted in between a man 
(David Proval) and his wife (Jennifer Beals) while they play S&M games.  
The episode isn't effectively comical, provocative, or titillating.  
Rockwell's confused script degenerates into dirty language with a cheap, 
predictable conclusion.  </P>
<P>     "The Wrong Man" is one of those stories that, because of a certain 
artistic pretentiousness, thinks it's a lot more humorous and clever 
than it actually is.  Really, it's basically a pointless short that, 
following right after Anders' disastrous opening, dooms FOUR ROOMS to a 
forty-five minute start that's almost unendurable.</P>
<PRE>"The Misbehavers"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10):  7.1</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Roth, Antonio Banderas, Tamlyn Tomita, Marisa Tomei, 
      Lana McKissack, Danny Veruzco
Written and Directed by: Robert Rodriguez
Cinematography: Guillermo Navarro</P>
<P>     After struggling through an unwatchable first two episodes, FOUR 
ROOMS finally stumbles upon something worthwhile in its third.  By now, 
a large portion of the audience probably won't care.  However, for those 
with patience, "The Misbehavers" offers an oasis in an otherwise 
creatively barren land.  Robert Rodriguez's contribution starts with Ted 
being induced by a $500 tip to baby-sit for the two small children of a 
gangster (Antonio Banderas) and his wife (Tamlyn Tomita).  Of course, 
Murphy's Law rears its head, and just about everything that can go 
wrong, does.</P>
<P>     Although a fair portion of the humor in "The Misbehavers" is of the 
crude variety, it's skillfully handled by film maker Rodriguez (EL 
MARIACHI), and, as a result, is occasionally sidesplittingly funny.  The 
two child actors (newcomers Lana McKissack and Danny Veruzco) are apt 
performers, and Tim Roth does his best manic John Cleese imitation.  
There's also a riotous phone conversation between Roth and Marisa Tomei 
that, despite its brevity, may represent FOUR ROOMS' comic highlight.</P>
<PRE>"The Man from Hollywood"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10):  5.5</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Roth, Quentin Tarantino, Jennifer Beals, Paul Calderon, 
      Bruce Willis
Written and Directed by: Quentin Tarantino
Cinematography: Andrzej Sekula</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that a fair number of those in the audience will 
be present because Quentin Tarantino is involved in this film.  
Unfortunately, Tarantino's episode can't save FOUR ROOMS.  Not only is 
it pointless, but it lacks the energy that characterized the director's 
feature films (RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION).  Also, while "The Man 
>From Hollywood" features Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue, the actor 
speaking many of the lines is one of the most inept and uncharismatic 
performers in movies these days:  Tarantino himself.</P>
<P>     "The Man from Hollywood" is based on an old Alfred Hitchcock TV 
episode, where a man bets his finger that he can start his lighter ten 
straight times.  Ted is brought in to wield the hatchet to remove the 
digit (should the need arise), earning a fee of $1000 for his troubles.  
The two bettors are big-time Hollywood director Chester Rush 
(Tarantino), who's putting up his 1964 Chevy Chevelle, and actor Norman 
(Paul Calderon), whose pinkie is on the line.  Also in the penthouse 
suite is profanity-spewing Leo (Bruce Willis) and, reprising her role 
from "The Wrong Man", Jennifer Beals.</P>
<P>     Even though "The Man from Hollywood" is merely twenty minutes long, 
it drags, and only the conclusion has any zing.  Whether Tarantino is 
played out has yet to be determined, but his efforts in FOUR ROOMS are 
feeble at best.  It's only the ugliness of Anders' and Rockwell's 
segments that make Tarantino's somewhat palatable -- but "The Man from 
Hollywood" is still no better than mediocre by his, or anyone else's, 
standards.</P>
<P>     At its best, FOUR ROOMS is reminiscent of John Cleese's '70s TV 
series FAWLTY TOWERS.  Far more frequently, however, this movie recalls 
one of the worst hotel movies of all time, BLAME IT ON THE BELLBOY. 
While spending ninety minutes watching FOUR ROOMS doesn't rank alongside 
the distasteful experience of a full night's stay at the Mon Signor, 
it's still a poor way to waste an evening -- New Year's Eve or 
otherwise. </P>
