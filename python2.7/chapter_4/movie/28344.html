<PRE>WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?
A film review by Max Messier

<P>Martin Lawrence is not funny.  For the proof just turn to his newest
film, What's The Worst That Could Happen? -- the answer to its own
question if ever there has been one.</P>
<P>I don't know how Martin Lawrence -- the former 1987 Star Search winner
with an arrest record that would make Tommy Lee envious -- has been able
to survive with all of the bad, bad films he has starred in during the
past 6 years.  [Two words: Bad Boys. -Ed.]  Big Momma's House, Blue
Streak, Life, and A Thin Line Between Love and Hate are all forgettable
movies which can be found in quantity on the clearance table at your
local video store.  But survive he has, and in Worst, Lawrence is a
mediocre Eddie Murphy stuck playing another jewel thief in another
run-of-the-mill studio comedy.</P>
<P>Worst revolves around a ridiculous cat-and-mouse game between a thief
named Kevin Caffery (Lawrence) who gets caught burglarizing media
conglomerate CEO Max Fairbanks (Danny DeVito), who in turn steals
Kevin's lucky ring given to him by his girlfriend.  Kevin then vows to
get the ring back at any cost -- thus setting up numerous comedic
situations to follow that play out like a homogenized sitcom.  The cast
is rounded out with an annoying Latino sidekick (John Leguizamo), a
one-dimensional girlfriend (Carmen Ejogo) who spends half the movie
whining about Kevin's numerous exploits in retrieving the ring, a
super-fly white guy hacker who uses more Apple products than Jeff
Goldblum to hack into Max's e-mail and surveillance system, and Kevin's
sharp-tongued mentor (Bernie Mac) -- who deserves much better roles than
bit parts in Martin Lawrence comedies.</P>
<P>The comedy plays out like a Henny Youngman joke.  Kevin and his cronies
break into Max's Miami penthouse dressed up like Arabic princes and
steal PAC contributions intended for shady Senate sub-committee
members.  Kevin calls Max on his cell phone -- he answers it during a
Senate sub-committee hearing! -- and Max then curses at Kevin via the
television cameras as the sign-language interpreter makes enough obscene
gestures to would make the Diceman blush.  Whoa ho!</P>
<P>Sam Weisman's (George of the Jungle) direction is lopsided and
uninteresting, and the film's pacing is worse than Betty White running
the Boston Marathon.  The jokes are cheap, predictable, and come solely
at the expense of others.   Every race and lifestyle -- gay, black,
German, Arabic, and white, to name but a few -- are used as easy
targets.  Danny DeVito walks through his role as Max Fairbanks as a
mini-Gordon Gekko crossed with his Louie De Palma character from Taxi. 
The biggest insult comes in the guise of underrated actor William
Fichtner -- playing a sexually ambiguous detective dressed up like a
1970's Bowie doll who is trying to nail (ahem) Max for all of his shady
business deals.</P>
<P>What's the Worse That Could Happen? ... besides the release of this
film?  Sadly, Blue Streak 2 is in pre-production, for which Lawrence
will receive a $20 million dollar paycheck.  Now, that's bad.</P>
