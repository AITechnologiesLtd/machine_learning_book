<P> Starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce. Rated R.</P>
<P>The influence of the MTV generation on cinema has never been more
apparent than in Stigmata, a visually stunning, prepostrously plotted
thriller that also happens to be vehemently anti-Catholic. MGM will
never hear the end of it from the ubiquitous, uncomfortably large
Catholic League, and understandably so; unlike some of the films that
activist groups have made a fuss about, it's not hard to see where this
one may offend. Let the offended ones balk, but this is tremendously
enjoyable trash, an audaciously stylized full-length music video that
manages to deliver a smart, surprisingly restrained message in a story
that doesn't make an iota of sense.</P>
<P>Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), a spunky Pittsburg hairdresser who is
also an atheist, comes home after a night on the town. She's tired. A
nice, warm bath seems like a tantalizingly good idea, so she decides to
take one. As she submerges herself in the water, something happens. Her
body thrashes in the tub, as if under the will of an invisible attacker.
Next thing she knows, she is in the hospital. There are identical
puncture wounds on both of her wrists. They go all the way through,
piercing both flesh and bone. The doctor reasonably assumes, considering
the nature of the injuries and the circumstances under which they were
incurred, that she mutilated herself in an apparent suicide attempts.
Frankie denies it, claiming that she loves her life and would not even
think about ending it.</P>
<P>A couple of days pass. Frankie and her pal (Nia Long) are on a subway
train. Something happens. The lights go out and the car shakes. Frankie
moves into the middle, her arms outstretched and holding on to the
overhead compartments. She receives numerous whippings on her back,
again coming from a seemingly invisible attacker. Is it a coincidence
that a group of nuns and priests were in the same car with her? What is
happening to this innocent woman?</P>
<P>These events are brought to the attention of the Roman Catholic Church,
which sends Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne, who, ironically, will
be playing Satan in the upcoming End of Days), a
priest/scientist/gumshoe to investigate. The suspicion, of course, is
that Frankie is a stigmatic, one of the very rare people afflicted with
the wounds of Christ. But stigmatics are invariably deeply faithful
people, and Frankie being an atheist presents a fundamental
contradiction. This is so unheard of, in fact, that Kiernan is ready to
dismiss the case, that is until Frankie, angry, confused and vulnerable,
convinces him to probe further. In doing so, he finds himself
questioning his own loyalties.</P>
<P>I can't go into too much detail without revealing some of the plot's
secrets, but to accept Stigmata's story is to accept the fact that God
would be willing to cause severe injury to people in order to get his
point across. Considering this film's devoutly religious message, that
is ludicrous. The thought mires down the movie at every turn, since we
are constantly depended on to accept it.</P>
<P>I never believed the film for a second, but I was delighted with the way
young director Rupert Wainwright (um, Blank Check, anyone?) brought it
to life. He will take flack for employing the "MTV style" of filmmaking
(some have unfairly labeled it "attention deficit disorder filmmaking),
but I defend his choice. The rapid, stylish, somewhat hyperactive way
Stigmata was filmed, along with its booming, spontaneous soundtrack, not
only makes the film more palatable but it also diverts our attention
somewhat from the movie's inconsistencies and makes it easier to watch.
Give Rupert Wainwright a good script, I say, and we may have our next
Brian DePalma.</P>
<P>Patricia Arquette gives an astonishingly good performance as the
physically and emotionally battered Frankie. At times, her grief is
devastatingly palpable. Gabriel Byrne reminded me a bit too much of
Jason Miller's Damien Karras in The Exorcist, but I suppose that was not
fully unintentional. Actually, Stigmata is less similar to the William
Peter Blatty classic than many have claimed. It isn't nearly as scary --
or as good -- but it is more thoughtful and less patently devilish.</P>
<P>Stigmata has a good cast, wonderful style and some effective filmmaking
all undermined by the implausibility of its story. It's an intelligent
movie and it is a well-made one; if only I could believe it.
