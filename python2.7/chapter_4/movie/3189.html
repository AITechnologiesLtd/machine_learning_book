<P>     Nothing in the first hour of NELL effectively explains what's
going on.  Sure, we're spoon fed the basics: Appalachian doctor Jerome
Lovell (Liam Neeson) is called by the sheriff to a backwoods cabin, the
home of a recluse who was thought to have lived alone.  She was a
stroke victim who had very little contact with the outside world.  She
also had a daughter that no one knew about--a young woman named Nell
(Jodie Foster) who has never known contact with strangers.</P>
<P>     They call Nell a "wild child" and immediately consult a
psychologist (Natasha Richardson) in Charlotte.  She wants Nell in a
hospital, Jerry wants Nell to be left alone, and there you go.  What
does *Nell* want?  Why is Jerry interested in her?  Why does Richardson
talk like she had Reba McEntire as a dialect coach?  The script never
answers these questions.</P>
<P>     Based on a play by Mark Handey, Nell is built around a magnificent
plot device:  a child reared without any human contact other than her
mother.  Said child was borne as the result of a rape and so Mom
painted a very cruel portrait of the outside world.  Mom also suffered
multiple strokes and her aphasia affected how the child was taught to
speak.  (Mom's accent didn't help much either, y'all.)</P>
<P>     The scenes for such a story should write themselves.  Sheriff
discovers cabin.  Doctor discovers Nell.  Nell discovers civilization.
Civilization discovers Nell.  Those scenes exist, but they're pieced
together in a routine, ambiguous fashion that never explains much of
anything.  We get plenty of moonlit shots of Nell communing with
nature, for example.  She dances under the stars and goes swimming
buck-naked.  It's a very showy performance from Foster that says very
little.</P>
<P>     Nell speaks through slow, swaying motions, appearing drunk in
almost every scene.  Why is she acting intoxicated?  Only in the last
few minutes does Nell reveal the mind that *we* know she's had all
along.  We've seen her intelligent stares; we know she's smart.  The
movie needs *less* of her silly swaying and *more* of the characters
who are paying attention to her.</P>
<P>     Director Michael Apted includes a number of images from inside
Nell's mind, which he overuses.  How about some scientific mumbo jumbo,
instead?  Here's a story *filled* with doctors and hospitals, yet no
one stops to give a frank explanation of why Nell is behaving in the
manner she is.</P>
<P>     The film achieves satisfying closure, when Nell gives a courtroom
speech that lets her say all the things that she should've said
before.  Of course, if she had spoken too soon, she would've ruined the
suspense.  Will the bad doctors study her like a specimen?  Will the
good doctors fall in love and protect her?  Duh, what do you think?</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  Great idea for a stupid movie.</P>
