<PRE>THE MASK OF ZORRO (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Martin Campbell
Writers: Terry Rossio, Ted Elliott, and John Eskow
Starring: Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta Jones, Stuart
Wilson, Matthew Letscher, Tony Amendola, Pedro Armendáriz Jr., L.Q. Jones,
Maury Chaykin, Julieta Rosen</P>
<P>"The Mask of Zorro" is like all of the old classic swashbucklers of the 20s
and 30s: action-packed, filled with lots of melodrama, seeming with
characters we either love or hate, marvelously entertaining, and instantly
forgettable.  I can't remember a lot of my reactions to this film as I
watched, and perhaps thinking about it a bit, I could probably point out
several things that I didn't like about it.  But all I remember is that for
2 hours plus, I was glued to the screen, swept up in the melodrama, and had
a big smile on my face the entire time.  Afterwards, it was more of a
grimace, but what are you gonna do?</P>
<P>Zorro is the latest of the classics of either TV or movies to be rehashed
by Hollywood and spit at the American Moviegoing Public, and luckily enough
Zorro's one that even I'd want to remake.  Basically, Zorro's a big
showman.  He doesn't just punish the wicked and return faith to the
downtrodden like a modern-day Mexican Robin Hood; he's got to do some
mugging, which is why he's such an interesting legend.  But this film
actually gives us not one but two Zorros, not to chose from, but to see the
torch being passed from one to another.</P>
<P>The film begins with the first Zorro, really a reclusive land owner named
Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins, sans Mexican accent), who rides to
town every now and then to help the poor and battle his tryannical
politician enemy, Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson, the baddie from
"Lethal Weapon 3," if you can at all remember him), then returns to his
villa on the edge of a cliff to be with his wife, Esperanza (Julieta
Rosen), and his newborn baby girl.  We are introduced to him when his fame
has already presided him, and after one big, very satisfying action
sequence towards the begining (glad to see Mr. Hopkins' stunt man is
finally getting some work), he is discovered by Rafael, his wife is
accidentally shot, his baby is stolen by Rafael, and he is sent to prison
for the rest of his life.</P>
<P>Jump about 20 years and Rafael is now returning to power again, this time
to end the long running war with Santa Anna over the property of
California.  Now enter con man Alejandro Murrieta (Anthony Hopkins), who
seeks revenge on an evil general of Montero's, Captain Harison Love
(Matthew Letscher), who kills his brother towards the beginning (sorta). 
Luckily, Diego has escaped from prison, and upon stumbling into Alejandro
at a bar, he decides that his fiery intensity, if properly trained, will
result in a redux of Zorro-dom, since he's way too old, but he still wants
to get revenge on Rafael and maybe introduce himself to his daughter, Elena
(a lusty and wonderfully-acting Catherine Zeta Jones), who's now much older
not to mention much more, well, buxom.</P>
<P>So goes the backstory to "The Mask of Zorro," and you can easily see how
melodramatic this all is, and how things will get even more melodramatic as
Alejandro learns how to fight and become suave (the film stages a massive
"Pygmalion"-esque sequence of him learning to fight, yet skips everything
about him learning to pass as a member of the Mexican aristocracy).  Things
become a tad more complicated as Alejandro starts posing as a politician of
sorts, and learns of some major political corruptedness.  Anyways, it's all
there just to involve the audience with a simple story of passionate
revenge, learning how to obtain dignity, and standing up against the
unjust.  And it's all just fun stuff because, unlike many films, the
characters we're supposed to like are very likable, and the characters
we're not supposed to like are very unlikable.  Just like the old movies.</P>
<P>The film's one major flaw may just be that it's trying to be everything,
and in the pursuit of telling a story, it denies the one thing that the
film really honestly needs: Zorro.  The character only pops up every now
and then, more and more towards the end, and the first times that Banderas
dons the costume and persona of the famous rebel are wonderfully awkward,
but eventually Banderas becomes Zorro.  When he finally gets it right, it's
just amazing stuff.  Banderas has proved himself to a few moviegoers,
mostly those who actually saw "Desperado" (one of the, like, billion films
he made in the fall of '95), that he's a suave, lovable, and wonderful
comic actor, capable of perhaps becoming one of the most likable graceful
action stars since Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.).  He has the kind of radiance
that lets the audience know that he's having lots of fun and the
gracefulness to be awe-inspiring and just plain lovable.  When he finally
discovers Zorro in himself, it just proves what the trailers suggested:
Antonio Banderas was born to play this role.  And he should do it agian,
for God's sake.</P>
<P>But the part of this film that really won me over was not Banderas's Zorro,
but Anthony Hopkins' Diego, a man who could have just been a simple
character, bent on revenge, but is instead portrayed as an emotionally
complex individual, thanks to Hopkins, who plays him with a mix of mystery
and sadness.  We never know what really made his character become Zorro in
the first place, but Hopkins hints at in his acting and makes everything
just seem real.  If Zorro is the reason you're seeing it in the first
place, Diego should be the reason you feel something emotionally.</P>
<P>However bold Hopkins' performance is, he never lets this film become heavy
handed, and his brooding never overblows the fact that this film is simply
just good old American entertainment.  There's no message, no dark
undertones, and the depth is kept to a minimum.  I could probably easily
complain that these are faults in the production and that I want to see big
budget Hollywood event pics, such as this, become "smarter"...but I won't,
because in all reality, I don't want all of them to be like that.  "The
Mask of Zorro" is not a dumb film, but it's not a terribly brilliant film
and that's all right.  It's escapism at its purist because it recognizes
that sometimes the most entertaining films are those that simply tell a
good story and tell it with interesting characters and lots of passion.</P>
