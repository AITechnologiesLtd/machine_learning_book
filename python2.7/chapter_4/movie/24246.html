<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"The Straight Story" tells a tale that would seem too far-fetched to be 
believed -- if it hadn't actually happened. Based on true events from the 
summer of 1994, director David Lynch's newest film is an unusual choice of 
project for the man behind sometimes baffling fare like "Twin Peaks" and 
"Lost Highway". But "The Straight Story" is pleasant and engrossing, and 
is also a rare motion picture that dares not only to feature a largely 
elderly cast, but also to treat them with considerable respect.</P>
<P>Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is 73 years old, a World War II 
veteran who has seen better days. His hips are giving out on him and his 
emphysema is getting worse. He lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy 
Spacek), who is mildly retarded but bright enough in her own way. One 
stormy night, Alvin learns from a relative that his brother Lyle has 
suffered a stroke. Alvin and Lyle were once as close as brothers could 
be, but they had a falling out ten years earlier and haven't spoken 
since. Desperately aware of both Lyle's mortality and his own, Alvin 
decides he has to make the journey from his home in Laurens, Iowa to 
Lyle's place in Mount Zion, Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Neither Alvin nor Rose have a driver's license, and Alvin is too proud to 
ask anyone else for help. So Alvin decides to hitch a trailer up to his 
battered old riding lawnmower and set out for Wisconsin, travelling no 
more than five or ten miles a day. His lawnmower soon breaks down, but 
Alvin is not swayed: he trades it in and uses the last of his money to 
buy a 1966 John Deere mower, then starts the journey all over again.</P>
<P>Alvin's slow voyage from Iowa to Wisconsin provides the framework around 
which the bulk of the movie is built. As is often the case in these sorts 
of films, the destination here is not nearly as important as what happens 
en route. (Indeed, the ending of "The Straight Story" is a beautifully 
underplayed scene, a real lesson in minimality that demonstrates Lynch's 
trust in his audience.) "The Straight Story" is "The Odyssey" writ small, 
with Alvin trundling from episode to episode like a wrinkly old Odysseus. 
None of these little stories are particularly fascinating, but put together 
they form a touching mosaic. It is through these chance encounters that 
Alvin's character is most fully illuminated and, moreover, that we are 
afforded a glimpse of the effect his passage has on others.</P>
<P>Some of these meetings are funny. Alvin witnesses a collision between a  
car and a deer, and learns that the driver (Barbara E Robertson) has 
killed more than a dozen of the creatures along that stretch of highway in 
the past six weeks. The problem is that she has to drive that route, 
back and forth every day, to get to work. Beyond quitting her job or  
moving, she simply has no other choice. "And I love deer!" she wails.</P>
<P>Other meetings are more serious. Alvin is nearly killed when he loses his 
brakes going down a steep hill. Shaken up and out of money until his 
next welfare cheque comes in, he is taken in by Danny and Darla Riordan 
(James Cada and Sally Wingert). The Riordans' friend Verlyn Heller (Wiley 
Harker) is a WWII veteran like Alvin, and one day at the local tavern 
the two share stories of the horrors of war. This is a beautifully acted 
sequence and again, Lynch shows faith in his viewers by leaving it 
static and quiet so that the audience can conjure in their own minds the 
scenes that Alvin and Verlyn relate.</P>
<P>As Alvin, Farnsworth does a very good job in an Academy Award-nominated 
performance. He gives the character considerable depth; his delivery in 
sequences like the aforementioned tavern scene are tinged with a lifetime 
of emotions. The only real drawback to the role -- and the same could be 
said of "The Straight Story" as a whole -- is that Alvin comes across 
as just a little too sweet, too coy. Although the very fact that he chose 
to endure the six-week journey is indicative of Alvin's character, I 
found it difficult to believe that he could really be so cherubic (and 
indeed, reports suggest that the real Alvin Straight, who died in 1996, was 
not quite as lovable as the movie implies). I don't think viewer sympathy 
would have been lost by giving Alvin a bit more of an edge, and I think 
it would have made him generally better-rounded.</P>
<P>None of the other actors have substantial screen time, but there is not a 
poor performance in the entire movie. Lynch is successful in coaxing just 
the right note out of all his cast, be it dramatic or comedic.</P>
<P>Like Stanley Kubrick in "2001: A Space Odyssey", Lynch successfully  
conveys the lethargic pace of Alvin's trip. There are long periods 
consisting of nothing but shots of Iowa farmland, for instance, and more 
than once the camera pans up from Alvin to the blue summer sky in a 
traditional passage-of-time shot, only to pan down again to show him just 
a few yards further along. This may induce boredom in some viewers, but 
for the most part I felt Lynch handled such scenes judiciously. They go 
on long enough to achieve their intended effect, but not so long that I 
began glancing at my wristwatch. The fact that these sequences are 
accompanied by gorgeous fiddle music composed by Lynch's frequent 
collaborator Angelo Badalamenti doesn't hurt, either.</P>
<P>Quiet, unassuming, gentle, endearing, "The Straight Story" is a delightful 
film. Here is a testimony not just to the principle that truth is 
stranger than fiction, and not just to one man's character and 
determination, but also to the innumerable little stories that are out 
there, just down the road, waiting to be discovered.</P>
