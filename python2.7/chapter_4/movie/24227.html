<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT [Friedkin] -- Boy, did they screw up reel one!
Really a mess from minute one to forty-five, an introduction as thought
provoking as colored toilet paper, the movie takes a sudden turn
for interesting once the courtroom battle begins, Tommy Lee Jones and
Samuel L. Jackson kick into high gear, and those pathetic Saving Private
Ryan-wannabe battle scenes cease fire. It certainly feels like something
downloaded from the creative mind of one Tom Clancy, with A Few Good Men
tossed in for good measure. C+</P>
