WOLF (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>The author of this review is supposed to worship, or at
least respect Mike Nichols as one of the great American
filmmakers, but he can't. Although I never saw anything
particularly wrong in Mike Nichols' films - they all had
interesting stories, good cast etc. - I still have
impression of watching them being equal to the watching
paint dry. So, when even when he tried to make something
different with WOLF, his 1994 horror film, I greeted that
effort without any sort of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>The protagonist of this film is Will Randall (played by Jack
Nicholson), publishing executive from New York who is
currently experiencing plenty of disappointments in his
life. His firm is taken over by business tycoon Raymond
Alden (played by Christopher Plummer) who degrades Randall
and brings Stewart Swinton (played by James Spader),
treacherous yuppie and Randall's former friend to his old
position. To make things even worse, Randall's wife
Charlotte (played by Kate Nelligan) is having an affair.
However, few days before this all happened, Randall was
bitten by a wolf on the isolated country road. Since that
event he notices changes in his metabolism and life patterns
- he sleeps all day and is awake all night, his senses are
better, but the most significant change is willingness to
stand up against his enemies. He becomes even more aware of
this change when he meets Alden's daughter Laura (played by
Michelle Pfeiffer) and begins an affair with her.</P>
<P>Some of the best roles in Jack Nicholson's career were those
of men whose willingness to break the rules or succumb to
irrational urges made them look satanic compared to "normal"
people. So, the role of book editor who is slowly turning
into werewolf was perfect for Nicholson and he plays it with
gusto. Michelle Pfeiffer as his partner is also great and
visually more appealing than in many other movies. The cast
in this film is truly up to task, and Indian actor Om Puri
makes quite an impression in the small episodic role of
lycantropy expert. Nichols puts a lot of effort into
production design and other details, trying to make the
story about lycathropy in New York publishing circles as
realistic as possible, using the classic horror scenario as
the basis for interesting, thought-provoking drama about
inter-office politics, midlife crisis and eternal struggle
between civilisation and irrational urges in individual
humans.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, all those elements go down the drain when
Nichols decides to wrap the story up with cheap horror
cliches and even cheaper murder subplots. The ending is not
the only problem of the film; Nichols, as usual, has
problems with proper pace of the film. Slow-motion shots of
Nicholson as werewolf are overlong, and Ennio Morricone's
score is again quite irritating. So, like in many similar
cases, my skepticism about Mike Nichols' film was justified.
WOLF could be recommended only to those who truly enjoy
Nicholson's acting, even when the rest of the film isn't
quite worthy of his talent.</P>
