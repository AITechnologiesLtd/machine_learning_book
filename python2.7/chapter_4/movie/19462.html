<PRE>" The Blair Witch Project "  * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     If youπve been paying attention to the media frenzy that
is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and who hasnπt, you know the story
and you know itπs pure dramatization.  Needless to say, though,
watching what has been committed to tape, one gets the undeniable
impression the events are veritable:  three students take hand-
helds into the woods, filming a school project about the myth of
a local witch, and get lost.  No biggie, as the put-upon leader
of their crew, Heather, states rationally, "Itπs hard to get
lost in America, and itπs harder to stay lost."  What starts
out fun and games, so to speak, amongst friends (correct "Gilliganπs
Island" vernacular; Heatherπs mishap with a pair of wet shoes)
quickly becomes something more serious.  Rations dwindle, their
only map disappears, and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into
bickering, nicotine jonesing and total disorientation.  They set
up camp, several times too often, and wake up to vague but ominous
noises just in the distance.  And, thatπs the ingenious thing of
the film:  the heard, yet unseen, proves to be a lot more
terrifying.  Because, try as you may to put whatπs going on into
perspective (twigs snap.. probably a small animal), you still
donπt know for certain.  And, because there is little light for
assistance, you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray,
or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances.
During Heatherπs emotionally-draining private confessional for
the camera, she sums this experience up quite nicely: "Iπm afraid
to close my eyes, and Iπm afraid to open them."</P>
<P>Whatπs also great about the film is its budget.  The point
of view footage is antsy, because the actors get antsy and donπt
know exactly where to look or where theyπre going in the heat of
apparent pursuit.  I think BLAIR WITCH will play even better on
the small screen, because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood
of a more quiet environment; occasionally, I was unable to hear
what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat-
clearing and squeaky seats, and it bugged me immensely.</P>
<P>There is no special effects work, no computer-generated
anything, and mostly no gory close-ups (save for a set of teeth),
which gives the film a great deal of authenticity.  And, what I
like most is the eerie conclusion; that last scene, in an
abandoned, dilapidated house, is nerve-wracking and more than
a little disturbing.  The collective opinion circulating the
ånet at present is that this scene is too quick, and the film
ends rather abruptly.  Which is true, but thatπs the point.
It is Heatherπs fear and despondence, come to the breaking
point.  After being in the woods for so long, and not knowing
what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ≠ whether
she, or her friends, would make it ≠ she and Mike arrive at one
last spot, maze-like and frustrating, and in an instant itπs all
over.  You leave with questions, and want to talk about what
youπve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in
a room.  Movies that can put you there have done their job; real,
or fake (forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business, already).
That final image ≠ you know the one ≠ is cryptic and haunting.</P>
<P>I wanted more scenes at night, with ≠ not _clearer_ sounds,
butä I donπt know, more of them.  Even greater a building of
exhaustion and fear.  The film does not quite go the psychological
distance, but itπs close.  Also, the arguing goes on a little
much for my taste (one fight, over the whereabouts of the map,
turns especially shrill), though such carrying-on is understand-
able, circumstances considered.     </P>
<P>"Scary as hell"ä no.  Creepy, yes.  Effective, brilliantly-
conceived and executed, and performed with all the conviction in
the world so that even if we doubt what weπre seeing is real,
suspension of disbelief is never an issue:  _oh yeah_.</P>
<P>Best line:  90% improv equals no cleverly constructed
dialogue; I like the reaction Heather has to a shot of scotch (I
hate it, too).</P>
