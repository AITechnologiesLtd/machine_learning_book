<P>***I would like to recognize the passing of George C. Scott this week. 
He was a fine actor who delivered one of the great monologues in film 
history in Patton. May he rest in peace.***</P>

<P>Double Jeopardy comes at the beginning of a fall movie season that is 
expected to be one of the film business' best, both artistically and 
financially. Unfortunately, the movie serves as a reminder that those 
two qualities do not always go hand-and-hand. The production's big name 
stars and run-from-the-law plot will likely deliver big bucks for 
Paramount despite a noticeable absence of quality.</P>
<P>Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) is a happily married woman enjoying the 
success of her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood) and very much involved 
with their son, Matty. An abrupt change occurs when she spends a 
romantic weekend on a sailboat with Nick. While at sea she finds herself 
framed for his bloody murder. Not too much later, she is behind bars, 
having put her son in the custody of her best friend, Angie (Annabeth 
Gish).</P>
<P>Angie disappears soon after Libby is imprisoned. With the help of some 
fellow inmates, the accused murderer finds her friend living in San 
Francisco with Matty - and the very much alive Nick. Libby doesn't 
pursue revenge while in prison, but rather patiently waits for her 
parole (advice that she gets from the same two aforementioned inmates 
that welcome her with open arms for no
apparent reason and seem to help her with everything accordingly). One 
of the two inmates used to be a lawyer and explains that since Libby is 
already convicted of murdering her husband, she cannot be tried again 
under the fifth amendment, which states "No person (shall)...be subject 
for the some offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."</P>
<P>After a suspiciously short period of time for a convicted murderer, 
Libby is paroled to a halfway-house under the supervision of Travis 
Lehman (Academy Award winner Tommy Lee Jones). From there, the search 
for her beloved son is on. One night, her quest keeps her out after 
curfew. She realizes this and flees the state. Travis follows in 
pursuit, thus creating a manhunt of a manhunt. The rest of the film is 
as cliched as one might imagine, with the payoff scene having plot 
twists that hardly catch the audience by surprise.</P>
<P>Ever since James Bond came along, some films have gained a certain 
immunity to the laws of realistically conceivable plots. Double Jeopardy 
abuses that privilege to the nth degree. Although the fifth amendment 
clause is not too farfetched, certain not-so-small details are. I am 
quite confident that Libby's possessing a murder weapon, ruining at 
least two cars, constant fleeing of states, breaking and entering a 
school and destruction of federal property might just be enough land her 
back behind bars. It also strikes me as particularly amazing that the 
police always seem to show up at just the right moment and Libby always 
manages to escape by tripping up the officers Keystone Cops style. 
Ironically, it is the same branch of government that manages to convict 
her so quickly and efficiently in the beginning, even without a body to 
show the jury.</P>
<P>The brief, yet all important, scenes in prison reek of deja vu. The 
two inmates that guide Libby are pulled right out of The Spitfire Grill. 
At the same time, I was reminded of the film I saw just before Double 
Jeopardy. At the end of Mumford, a reference is made to a certain prison 
as "a country club." That doesn't seem to be far from the case here, as 
other than a little labor, the penitentiary is filled with lively 
chatter, fun and games.</P>
<P>If ever there were proof that acting cannot compensate for a faulty 
script, it is here. Ashley Judd is just as good as she was in Heat, A 
Time To Kill, and Norma Jean and Marilyn (A made for HBO film where she 
portrayed Norma Jean and garnered several award nominations). But the 
real treat is Tommy Lee Jones who seems to have the on-the-run film down 
to a science after his critically acclaimed role in The Fugitive and the 
more recent U. S. Marshals. The two actors are very rarely on screen 
together, as the nature of their roles requires that they be in pursuit 
of each other. However, one scene that they do share carries a rare 
emotional feeling in a movie polluted with trucks speeding on sidewalks 
and action stunts of a similar nature.</P>
<P>Some many years from now, when the biographies of Ashley Judd and Tommy 
Lee Jones are written, this film will be conveniently left out as not 
even their two performances will save it from the fate of joining the 
"Employee Choices" rack at Blockbuster and the ranks of pay-television 
marathons. Probably, this is the last sentence you will ever read about 
Double Jeopardy.</P>
