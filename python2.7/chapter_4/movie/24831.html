<P>IN SHORT: Ralph Fiennes finely acting in yet another epic . . .</P>
<P>An epic tale of five generations of (what begins as) a Jewish family in
the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, writer/director Istvan Szabo's
Sunshine allows star Ralph Fiennes to flex his acting muscles as he
plays three separate roles as a hundred years of time rolls endlessly
across the big screen. With its three hour running time, two thoughts
may flow through your heads...</P>
<P>1) if it's so good, why isn't it being held until November?, and
2) if the air conditioner is broken, three hours in a cool theater is
better than a hundred and twelve degrees in the shade . . .</P>
<P>Both thoughts are legit and both make it sound as if Sunshine is an
utter bomb, which it is not. It is, actually, a splendidly acted and
dazzling-to-watch two hours of film, recreating a world that hasn't
existed in almost a century. The problem is that this two hour wonder is
followed by a third, which essentially kills all the fun. But, says the
film student inside, historical epics aren't supposed to be fun!, to
which I reply that I would rather be left wanting to see more, than to
walk away without a positive, spirit enhancing conclusion to the piece
-- which Sunshine tries to deliver and doesn't.</P>
<P>Sunshine is the story of the family Sonnenschein, whose patriarch
Emmanuel (David De Keyser) made his fortune peddling an herbal tonic,
brand-named "Sunshine," from a pack on his back. Once successful and
established, with a factory cranking out his product and its recipe
secreted inside a hidden notebook, Emmanuel takes a wife and raises his
family. Gustave (James Frain) and Ignatz (Fiennes) are his pride and
joys. Valerie (Jennifer Ehle), an orphaned cousin on his wife's side, is
also raised as a sister to the boys. The family is nearly split in two
by political affiliations and the declared love of Ignatz and his
cousin, who marry despite "their" father's wishes. Ignatz, an
incorruptible judge, changes his name to "Sors" for political reasons --
no obvious Jews are allowed government -- and rises higher and higher in
the Empire, until historical events shuffle him off the screen. Gustave
flees to France, to be seen later, and Valerie raises her son Adam
(again, Fiennes), who becomes a champion fencer and a Gold Medal
recipient on the Hungarian Olympic team in Berlin.</P>
<P>To do so, Adam must turn his back on his religion and become a Roman
Catholic. In doing so, he meets his also-to-be-converted wife Hannah
(Molly Parker) and fathers a son, Ivan (again, Fiennes). Then comes The
Big One, where conversion and/or status in the country cannot protect
everyone in the family from doom. All of this, the epic tale of a
family's rise and fall and redemption and survival, is enough.</P>
<P>Once you get past the War (you'll hear a crowd chanting "Stalin! Stalin!
Stalin!") we suggest you pack up and leave, wanting more. If you wish to
sit through the Communist era, prepare to emerge like a balloon that has
deflated. It isn't that Sunshine fails here, it is just that the film
(perhaps all too accurately) portrays a love-less, joy-less, and fully
hypocritical time. Ivan and the remains of his family, including his
grandmother Valerie (Rosemary Harris) a returned uncle Gustave (John
Neville) must survive under Communism. Ivan must deal with his
experience in the camps and can never let the war go; his job is to hunt
down the traitors, first from the war and then the witchhunt of the
Stalinist purges. Important characters in this stage include William
Hurt as Ivan's boss and Deborah Kara Unger as the wife of a connected
party. For Ivan and his family this era, called "The Great Diminishing"
by Szabo is one bad turn after another. Even with a conclusion set in
the post-Communist free era, all that is left for the living is a sense
that they have survived.</P>
<P>And survival is not enough. Ivan's redemption, such as it is, is not
enough -- and I've left out tons of material laying out the bare bones
of the story for you. The first two hours are truly a magnificent
recreation of that time and world . . . and here you should know that I
can trace my family back to a time they were called Wittenbourg and
lived dead center in the middle of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. I may
bring more historical baggage into the theater with me, but this does
not mean I've overinflated my enjoyment of the first two acts. Fiennes'
roles, and Rosemary Harris' later, are both unique and touching. The
staging and production values are equally great. Szabo's original five
hour long script, in Hungarian, has survived both translation and
reduction with the help of noted playwright Israel Horwitz. The film
dearly needs an intermission and, I'm guessing, another half hour to
show if and how Ivan is truly redeemed.</P>
<P>The Commies wrecked it for everybody, I guess . . .</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Sunshine, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.00</PRE>
<P>Rental level. If you can find it on the big screen at a decent price,
the first two hours are well worth the expenditure of cash.</P>
