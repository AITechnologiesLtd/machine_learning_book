KUNDUN
A film by Martin Scorsese
Starring: Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Gyurme Tethong, Tulku Jamyang Kunga 
Tenzin, Tenzin Yeshi Paichang, and Tencho Gyalpo
Written by Melissa Mathison</PRE>
<P>    KUNDUN is Martin Scorsese's return to the somber religious overtones 
of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, and a film so unlike everything else 
he has ever done, including the film made preceding KUNDUN, CASINO.  
Using no Western actors whatsoever, Scorsese steps away from the 
boundaries of Western civilization, and instead makes a relatively small 
film about the Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and one of 
the most revered figures in the world.</P>
<P>Leave it to Scorsese to give himself a challenge.  Scorsese was 
faced with the dilemma of making the culture of Tibet, a visual, aural 
treat that is so painstakingly detailed that some would find it boring, 
palatable to Western audiences.  Compounding his dilemma was the 
production of one SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET, a far inferior film starring 
Brad Pitt (though not as the Dalai Lama- that would have been 
interesting.)  Scorsese's film is about as far away from the Pitt movie 
as possible: it is slow-moving, much more visual, and more dependant on 
patience and images than on storyline. 20</P>
<P>The film's storyline is basically simple: it follows the life of the 
14th Dalai Lama from his finding at a young age to his escape into 
India.  His Holiness is played by four different monks, each of whom are 
excellent in their respective roles.  The youngest is probably the 
finest of the group, and he is without a doubt the highlight of the 
first act of the film.  The actors show a tremendous maturation as they 
progress, highlighting the growth of the Dalai Lama as he progressed in 
age.  In the latter part of the film, the Chinese invade Tibet, and 
Kundun, the ancient term for the Dalai Lama, is forced eventually to 
flee.</P>
<P>The script, written by E.T. scribe (and Harrison Ford spouse) 
Melissa Mathison, is not only slow in development, it is also highly 
philosophical and experimental.  There are several "dream sequences" 
which are often difficult to follow, and much of the film's power comes 
from its breathtaking visuals and score.  Scorsese lets the film develop 
without rushing into anything: his cameras are fluid, but not rapid.  
They are instead an hybrid of the NY style used predominantly by the 
famed director with a sort of reverent bathing of the Tibetan culture, 
creating an interesting dichotomy.  The visuals are at once personal and 
extravagant, leaving the viewer an impression not only of the film being 
a portrait of a man, but a portrait of a culture as well.</P>
<P>Several sequences are absolutely stunning.  One in particular 
involves Kundun standing in the middle of hundreds of monks, dead, as 
the camera pans back to reveal those the Dalai Lama could not predict.  
It is a deeply religious, deeply philosophical moment that reveres all 
which is non-violent, and abhores that whcih causes death and 
destruction.  Scorsese is quite passionate about his subject, and his 
dichotomy of spirituality and humanity is far better here than in LAST 
TEMPTATION. 20</P>
<P>The performances of all the players are exquisite.  The score, by 
Phillip Glass, is also outstanding.  The movie is, however, a 
challenging viewing, and the majority of the viewers will describe it as 
boring.  But for the chosen few, KUNDUN is a visual experience like no 
other.  With tremendous artistry, Scorsese is able to transport an 
ancient culture into the rooms of America.  There is so much beauty in 
even the most gruesome of sequences, so much power in the movements of 
its characters.  It is a slow-moving, sometimes tedious chore to listen 
to KUNDUN.  It is a deeply philosophical movie that can be interpreted 
as preachy.  But KUNDUN is truly none of those.  It is instead the 
ultimate acheivement in the mixture of art, beauty, sound, dance, 
culture, and history, not a film triumph as much as a culture triumph.  
KUNDUN may lack a significant plot or buildup, but it exhibits so much 
beauty, grace, and sheer devastation that it is nothing short of a 
triumph.  One of Scorsese's most challenging, most difficult, and 
ultimately, most rewarding films, KUNDUN is a true masterpiece.</P>
