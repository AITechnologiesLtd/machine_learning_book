<P>
Looking it up on the IMDB, I think the only Sam Raimi movies I've seen
are "Darkman", "Army of Darkness", and the Sharon Stone western, "The
Quick and the Dead."  Except for "Army", I've missed the Evil Dead
movies that first put him on the map.  The strongest impression of
Raimi, though, comes more from "Hercules" and "Xena", if only because
Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell are regulars.  Much clever goofiness in
these shows.</P>
<P>I finally got around to seeing Raimi's "A Simple Plan" this weekend,
and you can't easily travel further in tone from "Xena" or "Army of
Darkness."  Here we have a moral fable, where reasonable decisions made
by decent folk lead down a path where decency is thrown out for the
sake of fear and greed, and where small, innocent choices spiral out of
control.  While good luck may be the reside of good design, the film
plays out a converse, with a simple plan contorting into disaster in
the face of accident and unforeseen consequences.</P>
<P>The basic plot is the story of a trio of friends who stumble on a lot
of money.  They decide to keep the windfall from themselves, even
though the circumstances look suspicious.  They have to hide it, for a
while at least, or questions will be asked.  We've seen this before,
but Raimi and his actors handle these familiar parts very well.</P>
<P>A recent, similar film is the British "Shallow Grave", where three
flatmates fall into a bundle of cash when their new boarder dies.  Not
a bad film, it is more a cautionary tale about the effective disposal
of unwanted corpses and why people may want hacksaws in the big city:
it's a body dumping black comedy.  While there's the familiar flavor of
desperate greed and paranoia in the film, the main difference is that
the people from "Shallow Grave" are all heartless urban assholes
(clearly shown in the first 5 minutes) whose ultimate fates you don't
particularly care about, while "A Simple Plan" features rural workers
scraping by meagerly, carrying believeable hopes and memories.
Skin-deep yuppies living in the present, whose windfall only increases
the degree of skin-deep yuppism, or ordinary folk with histories and
futures, for whom the cash is a desperately transforming experience:
which makes for the more better story?</P>
<P>I don't want to talk too much about the plot, mainly because there's a
certain pleasure in seeing it unfold, seeing how the innocuous choices
lead to treacherous ground, which leads to even worse choices.
Instead, I'll reassure you that the early animal metaphors, which seem
overly heavy and obvious, really do figure in the plot later.  They
don't exist in a vacuum, even if the whole fox in the henhouse thing
really is a laying it on a bit thick.  It's a fine film.</P>
