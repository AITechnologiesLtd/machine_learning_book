<P>     When it was announced that Clint Eastwood would make THE BRIDGES OF
MADISON COUNTY, many fans of the harlequin romance novel went up in
arms.  "How could he, he's Dirty Harry?".  Many thought Eastwood didn't
have the subtle touch that a Director needs when making a romance.  I'm
here to tell you Eastwood has proven all those who doubted him wrong.
He has crafted an instant classic, and probably the best American
romance in the last ten or so years.</P>
<P>     THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is told in a story in story
fashion.  The children of Meryl Streep's character congregate back in
Iowa for their Mother's funeral, and in reading her diary finds out
about an affair she had much earlier in life.  Streep, in probably her
best performance since SOPHIE'S CHOICE, plays an Italian immigrant
Francesca Johnson.  Obviously repressed, she is married to an Iowa
farmer and is seemingly set in her role as housewife.  Francesca's
family leaves for four days to go the Illinois State fair, leaving
Francesca for what would normally be a few days of work around the
house. Enter Eastwood.  Playing National Geographic photographer Robert
Kincaid, Eastwood drives into this small Iowa town and right into
Francesca's life.  What starts as simply a request of where the local
covered bridges are, turns into a four-day passionate romance filled
with beautiful nuances and gentle expression.  Fighting it at first,
Francesca eventually follows her obvious attraction for Kincaid and is
rewarded with the love she only dreamed of.  Along with Francesca, we
are all rewarded with many memorable scenes of passion and warmth.
Along with these many scenes are some captivating moments of dialogue
between the characters.  Francesca and Robert connect like no other
couple I've seen on screen in a long time.  We are seeing people, and
because of that their story is far more moving.  Eventually Francesca
must decide between her family and security, and her passion for
Robert.</P>
<P>     Simply, the most outstanding part of this film is Streep's
performance.  I think she is probably the best Actor/Actress working
today!  Her mastery of an Italian accent here is quite astonishing, as
is her ability to communicate with a simple look or smirk.  She was so
good that I not only wanted to find out what would happen with her
affair, but also just to follow her character and any path she took.
Eastwood is extremely good also.  He is very convincing in his
sensitive role and beams on screen when he is in the presence of
Streep.  His ruggedness is a good counterpart to Streep's timid
countenance.</P>
<P>     As he did two years ago with UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood proves he is
becoming one of the best Directors in America.   With a deft touch, he
portrays a passion filled yet gentle affair.  Again Eastwood's long
time collaborator Jack Green fills the screen with gorgeous images
also.  Whether the film stays faithful to the book or not is not
important, this film is moving and a joy to view.</P>
<PRE>Highly recommended.</PRE>
