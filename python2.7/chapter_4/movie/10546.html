<P>        WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? in a nutshell brings two worlds together that
many people have always dreamed about. The world of animated characters
and fantastical lore meet the real human world. Specifically the live
and wild one called, "Hollywood."</P>
<P>        If the special effects in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? had been done in a
poor manner, then the whole movie would be change. But fortunately, Ken
Ralston, of Star Wars and Forrest Gump fame, has done a splendid job in
meshing the two worlds together.</P>
<P>        As the tagline suggests, the film is about a man, a rabbit and a woman
in a triangle of trouble. The plot is set in Hollywood 1949, with the
sets and clothes perfectly matched for the time period. A mile away from
the Maroon Cartoon studios is a tunnel that leads to a town called Toon
Town, which is the home of the toons. "Every Joe loves Toon Town" except
for Eddie Valiant, a drunk of a PI, who's brother was killed by a toon
years back. Their team always cracked the important toon cases, and they
were admired until the accident.        Now Eddie is assigned to a new job, and
it unfolds into a plot to destroy Toon Town, and those loveable toons.</P>
<P>        Although the plot is a bit disjointed in a few spots, it holds together
well enough because of the magic of the toons. The toons are crazy, so
when the plot takes odd twists, it makes sense.</P>
<P>        There are many strengths in this film, and they do far outweigh the
weaknesses. The acting of Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) and Judge Doom
(Christopher Lloyd) make the picture soar in parts. Hoskins plays a
great burnt out PI, and on top of that, he's usually acting solo since
there really isn't a Rabbit named Roger speaking to him. He conveys
great emotion without even having another actor to speak to.</P>
<P>        Another strength is the humor. It's done in a brilliant way, with the
toons and humans, and you find yourself cracking up at things that you
normally wouldn't. The voice acting of the talented Charles Fleischer,
as he plays four characters in the film, also elicits some chuckles. The
simple premise of mixing these two worlds alone just produces laughter,
as it's a fresh, new idea.</P>
<P>        The humor, along with the suspense of the storyline create a good
atmosphere. I've always liked when movies are two or more movies in one.
Like this one, which is a mystery and a comedy in one. And Zemeckis
manages to pull it off without making it look too corny.</P>
<P>        Musical score can be 50% of a movie sometimes. In the case of WHO
FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, composer Alan Silvestri creates a brilliant score
that captures the very essence of the movie. Written with an old time
jazz feeling, the score soars at all times, making some scenes ooze with
a sense of completion. The music in this film deserved at least an Oscar
nomination, as it's wonderfully written and styled.</P>
<P>        Although the ending could use some adjustment, it is one of the most
suspenseful and hilarious closings to a movie that have come along.
Although movies don't need to always end with the bad guy getting
clocked, in this case it was almost needed, especially when the badguy
is seemingly invincible.</P>
<P>        The film passes along a message through the mayhem of the toons, which
is that laughter is important. Sometimes laughter is the only thing we
have. And with all the laughs produced by the film, it does carry the
message well.</P>
<P>        WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? ends with style, and you'll find youself
chuckling as the credits roll, recalling events that occured during the
film. Even though quirky, corny, and confusing a few times, the movie
creates a sense of funny wonder, and definately does not dissapoint.</P>
