 The Perfect Storm (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring George Clooney,
Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, Diane Lane and Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Music by James Horner. Screenplay
by Bill Wittliff, based on the book by Sebastian Junger. Directed by
Wolfgang Petersen.</P>
<P> "The Perfect Storm" could have been one of those classic man vs. the
elements sagas in which a group of individuals heroically battle nature
with all their heart, soul and courage.</P>
<P> And while director Wolfgang Petersen's dramatization of Sebastian
Junger's best-selling novel is at times breathtaking and awesome, it
lacks the emotional resonance of a "Captains Courageous" or "The Old Man
and the Sea."</P>
<P> The fault possibly lies in the screenplay, adapted by Bill Wittliff.
Wittliff is a fine writer, having adapted "Lonesome Dove" for
television. His screen credits include "The Black Stallion" and
"Barbarosa." On the down side, they also include "Legends of the Fall"
and "The Cowboy Way."</P>
<P> hat Wittliff has failed to do is create a bond between the audience and
the main protagonists, so when they meet their ultimate fate, the impact
is muted.</P>
<P> To be fair, this may not all be Wittliff's doing. He had to whittle
Junger's book down to a reasonable two-hour-plus running time. And in
doing so something had to be jettisoned.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, it was character development in lieu of the many shots
of giant waves crashing into the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail.</P>
<P> Thus we get penciled doodles instead of completed portraits of the crew
of the Andrea Gail. It also doesn't help that some of the dialogue
mouthed by these Gloucester, Mass., fishermen sounds cliched and
unnatural, as if it was written for them.</P>
<P> The real heroes of "The Perfect Storm" are the technicians at
Industrial Light & Magic who have created some stomach churning effects
that will have you reaching for sea sickness pills.</P>
<P> But "The Perfect Storm" is a human drama, a story of hubris,
stubbornness, tenacity and reckless moxie.</P>
<P> This true tale takes place in late October of 1991. Capt. Billy Tyne
(George Clooney) has endured a run of disappointing catches. His pride
is hurt moreso than his wallet, and he decides to make one last outing
for a big score.</P>
<P> Tyne gathers his crew. Among them are Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), who needs
the money to begin a new life with his girl, Chris (Diane Lane); Dale
`Murph' Murphy (John C. Reilly), a veteran seaman who is supporting his
estranged wife and son; and Sully (William Fichtner), a sharp-tongued
individual who does as little work as possible.</P>
<P> They set out for the Grand Banks, but when the fishing there proves
inadequate they push on to the Flemish Cap. Tyne ignores all the
warnings about an upcoming storm and, like a mini-Ahab, pursues his
prey.</P>
<P> What Wittliff's script fails to provide is a rational motivation for
Tyne's action. Is it pride because he has been outfished by a rival
captain (the lovely Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)? Is it guilt because of
the failure to provide a decent payoff for his crew? Is it a way to
prove to his boss, the owner of the Andrea Gail, that he's still a
top-flight skipper, a worthy seaman?</P>
<P> It might be a combination of all three, but the characters are so
weakly defined that we never know sure what galvanizes his decisions.</P>
<P>  The script's shortcomings are slightly compensated by the movie's
first-rate cast and ILM's computer graphic effects.</P>
<P>Clooney is scruffy and a bit sea-worn as Tyne, a proud man sure of his
knowledge of the sea and its fishing lanes.</P>
<P> Wahlberg is appealing, filled with puppy-dog sincerity as the young man
in love. But he really is given little to do except admire Tyne's
seamanship.</P>
<P> Reilly is tough and tender as a man with a hole in his heart. `Murph'
loves his son, and it devastates him that he must return to the sea
instead of being able to spend time with the boy.</P>
<P> Again, a script problem fails to explain the animosity between Murphy
and Sully, even though the pair finally do reach some sort of
understanding.</P>
<P> All in all, the characters merely seem like archetypes instead of
full-bodied individuals.</P>
<P> A James Horner score helps propel the action. It is not as bombastic as
you'd expect for a movie of this type. In some scenes it has a lyrical,
sea-chanty lilt.</P>
<P> Overall, "The Perfect Storm" is an imperfect feature. This is one movie
that probably could have used a longer running time for more character
exposition.</P>
<P> As it is, "The Perfect Storm" is a mighty adventure that lacks any real
personal warmth. It has a cold, detached feeling. The human dimension
that director Petersen brought to his other seafaring outing, the
classic "Das Boot," is the element most needed to hoist "The Perfect
Storm" into the pantheon of great sea movies.</P>
