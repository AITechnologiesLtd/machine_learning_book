<P>Susan Granger's review of "LIBERTY HEIGHTS" (Warner Bros.)</P>
<P> Filmmaker Barry Levinson says: "If I knew things would no
longer be, I would have tried to remember better." And this expertly
crafted coming-of-age tale is Levinson's fourth semi-autobiographical
film set in Baltimore - like "Diner," "Tin Men," and "Avalon."
Focusing on the changing times of the mid-1950s, it tackles the
provocative issues of race, religion and class distinction. A wry and
enormously touching remembrance, it spans exactly one year in the life
of an insular, middle-class Jewish family. With segregation coming to
an end, they struggle with the poignant dilemmas evoked by ethnic
diversity. One son finds himself attracted to a young black woman
whose family is as appalled by their friendship as is his own, while
the other son is dazzled by a luminous blue-eyed, blonde gentile who
wields a magic wand, offering him a tantalizing glimpse into a
lifestyle that's a marked contrast to everything he's ever known. Each
boy pursues his passion with a manic edge that's filled with pathos
and amusement. Plus, there's the traumatic upheaval caused by their
father's involvement in staging an illegal lottery that draws the
attention of the F.B.I..  Headed by Joe Mantegna, the superb ensemble
cast features Adrien Brody and Bebe Neuwirth, along with Justin
Chambers, Vincent Guastaferro, Orlando Jones, David Krumholz, and
Kiersten Warren. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Liberty
Heights" is an evocative, nostalgic 8. It's funny, feisty, and full of
life, as laughter and tears mix and mingle, characterizing the human
condition that Barry Levinson captures so deftly. Don't miss it - and
take your parents.</P>
