<P>MANSFIELD PARK (M).  
(Miramax/Village Roadshow)
Director: Patricia Rozema
Stars: Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, Alessandro Nivola, Embeth 
Davidtz, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan, Sheila Gish, James Purefoy, 
Victoria Hamilton, Justine Waddell, Hugh Bonneville, Hannah Taylor Gordon
Running time: 116 minutes.</P>
<P>The third, and most autobiographical, of Jane Austen's novels,
Mansfield Park tells the story of a young girl from an impoverished
family who is raised on the estate of wealthy relatives in the English
countryside.  This is a witty, articulate and beautifully observed
tale that retains the lyrical quality of Austen's prose as well as the
irony with which she observed the social mores and conventions of
British society during the late 18th and early 19th century.</P>
<P>This delightful comedy remains faithful to those themes common
to Austen's novels (Emma, Sense And Sensibility, etc), but gives the
material a decidedly feminist outlook.  It explores the class system
of England and savages the hypocrisy and double standards of the upper
class, who preach morality and virtue at home but practice debauchery
when abroad visiting their holdings in the colonies.  It also suggests
that marriage for wealth and status does not always lead to happiness.
And, while marriage for love is a more noble option, it also brings
with it some emotional baggage.</P>
<P>Sex has always been a part of Austen's novels, but until now
it has merely been hinted at, never seen.  In Mansfield Park, Canadian
director Patricia Rozema (When Night Is Falling, etc) brings it out
into the open, making for a bolder, more lusty interpretation that may
shock the purists.  Rozema has also drawn on Austen's own letters and
journals to flesh out the narrative.  Rozema may have taken numerous
liberties with Austen's novel, but her witty and intelligent script
and its modern sensibilities make Mansfield Park relevant for today's
audiences.</P>
<P>Australian actress Frances O'Connor (Love And Other
Catastrophes, etc) does a superb job as Austen's semi-autobiographical
heroine Fanny Price, who undergoes a rags-to-riches like
transformation.  At a young age Fanny is taken away from the squalor
of her impoverished family in Portsmouth and sent to the country
estate of her rich relatives, the Bertrams.  There she is put to good
use in the household, as well as gaining an education along the way.</P>
<P>Fanny blossoms into a beautiful, articulate, literate young
woman with strong opinions and an independent spirit, although some of
her ideas are met with disapproval by her guardians.  Despite her
forthright nature though, Fanny is also the typically virginal Austen
heroine, who finds herself caught between two suitors.  On one hand
there is the handsome but narcissistic and shallow cad Henry Crawford
(Alessandro Nivola, recently seen in Best Laid Plans, etc), who
showers her with protestations of love and happiness.  On the other
hand there is Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller, from Trainspotting,
etc), whom she has known since childhood, but who is retiring and
reluctant to admit his feelings for her.  Meanwhile, Henry's sister
Mary (Embeth Davidtz) has designs for Edmund and the Bertram fortune.</P>
<P>Rozema handles the romantic entanglements and machinations
with a dexterity that brings this potentially staid period melodrama
to life.  The characters are beautifully brought to life by the
wonderful cast.  O'Connor is superb and suffuses her character with
plenty of fierce determination and spunk.  Playwright Harold Pinter
brings plenty of bluster to his performance as the patriarchal Sir
Thomas Bertram.</P>
<P>While Mansfield Park may not be for the purists, it is a
vastly enjoyable, lavishly cinematic spectacle.  The production design
is superb, and Michael Coulter's cinematography simply luscious.</P>
