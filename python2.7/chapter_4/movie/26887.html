Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 18, 2000.</P>
<P>Director Don Roos' 1998 debut "The Opposite of Sex" was such an acid-tongued, 
wittily-scripted black comedy that there was no doubt in my mind his 
sophomore effort, whatever it may be, would be anything less than smart and 
confidently made. "Bounce" fulfills both of these things and goes a step 
forward to, as in "The Opposite of Sex," find the poignancy and truth that is 
required in any intimate relationship. Aided by a memorable supporting cast, 
and two couldn't-be-better performances from the film's leads, Gwyneth 
Paltrow and Ben Affleck, "Bounce" is the sort of romance that doesn't come 
around too often--intelligent without being saccharine, heartfelt without 
being condescending.</P>
<P>With the snow heavily falling outside, almost all planes have been canceled 
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Passing the time in an airport bar, advertising 
executive Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck), headed for his home in Los Angeles, has 
met up with the beautiful Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), going to Dallas, and 
kind businessman Greg (Tony Goldwyn) who desperately wants to get home to his 
wife and children. When Mimi makes it clear that she would like Buddy to 
spend the night with her, he gives his ticket to Greg (who is also headed for 
LA, but on a later flight), and slyly convinces the flight attendant at the 
door (Jennifer Grey), who has an on-again-off-again crush on buddy, to do so. 
When the plane crashes, killing everyone on board, Buddy (1) can't believe he 
was going to be on that flight, and (2) crushed that he more or less sent 
this family man off to die while he could have yet another one-night-stand.</P>
<P>Switch forward one year, Buddy is now a newly recovered alcoholic who has 
just checked out of the local Drug and Alcohol Recovery Center and is eager 
to get back to work. In an effort to come to terms with his insecurities and 
make amends, Buddy tracks down Greg's wife, real estate agent Abby Janello 
(Gwyneth Paltrow), and attempts to give her a big sale on a patch of property 
his ad company wants to buy. With Abby, at first, telling Buddy that she is 
merely divorced, and without Buddy having the guts to disclose his true 
identity with her, they unexpectedly click and begin to fall for one another.</P>
<P>In lesser hands, "Bounce" would be a romantic drama that is predictable and 
obvious every step of the way, offering nothing new in the way of plot 
developments or character motivation. But unlike so many movie romances, 
"Bounce," scripted by Roos, is based in the scary world of reality, where not 
everything always turns out as you'd expect, and where the characters seem to 
be real people, rather than pawns whose only purpose is to fall in love with 
a mawkish love ballad overscoring each scene. Its expertise in depicting 
everyday life while setting up an affecting romance is impressive and all too 
rare in movies nowadays.</P>
<P>Reminiscent in many ways with 1999's Harrison Ford-Kristin Scott Thomas drama 
"Random Hearts," which had virtually the same setup, "Bounce" is infinitely 
more successful because it isn't afraid to show its heart, while "Random 
Hearts," ironically, was cold and emotionally unfeeling. Buddy and Abby are 
both flawed, yet sympathetic people whom we care about and hope get together, 
despite the sticky situation they are in. </P>
<P>Since his Oscar win for 1997's "Good Will Hunting," Ben Affleck has 
skyrocketed to the top of the Hollywood A-list, but in doing so, has chosen 
far too many duds and not enough financial successes. Either appearing in 
brainless thrillers like 2000's "Reindeer Games" or trashy blockbusters like 
1998's "Armageddon," Affleck has finally returned to the type of emotionally 
centered motion picture he exceeds in.  Affleck may have the build to be an 
action star, but his sweet-natured features and puppy dog eyes make him far 
more qualified for character roles that exploit his acting talent, rather 
than muscles.  Here, he has a tough assignment--someone that has made many 
mistakes in his past and a nasty bout with alcoholism, but is struggling 
every day to put his life back together and be the best that he can be. This 
is arguably Affleck's most powerful and distinguished work, to date.</P>
<P>His match in every way, Gwyneth Paltrow (1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley") 
has proven herself time and time again that she is an extraordinary talent 
who has a string of successful films and a Best Actress Oscar statuette (for 
1998's "Shakespeare in Love") to show for it. Fearless in her portrayal of an 
average, working-class mother with two young children, Paltrow is fearless in 
the way she downplays her physical beauty here, and in doing so, is all the 
more radiant. Every performance choice that Affleck and Paltrow make--every 
facial expression and line-reading--rings with a resounding honesty that is 
inordinately refreshing to hear.</P>
<P>Roos' strongest asset, however, lies in the sharp dialogue he pens. Every 
word counts, and in making what the people say so memorable, has created 
quite a few good supporting roles, helped along by strong performances from 
the rest of its cast. With just a few scenes each, such top-flight actors as 
Natasha Henstridge (2000's "The Whole Nine Yards"), Tony Goldwyn (1990's 
"Ghost"), and Jennifer Grey (1987's "Dirty Dancing") make a lasting 
impression that stays with you throughout. Of special notice is Johnny 
Galecki (who appeared in Roos' "The Opposite of Sex"), as Buddy's confidante 
and gay assistant, who is so understated and effective that I would love to 
have seen a whole movie made about his immensely likable and naturalistic 
character.</P>
<P>Quietly emphatic, "Bounce" is never exactly earthshaking, but exactly the 
type of motion picture that will have its work cut out for it if it plans on 
making money. With so many expensive holiday movies being released now, a 
low-key drama about real people in real relationships is something that not 
many people will be attracted to, which is a shame. On its side are the 
wonderful turns by Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have enough chemistry 
to light up the darkness in a giant movie theater. "Bounce" is a truly 
worthwhile and appealing entertainment that is certainly worth a look, and 
reestablishes what a fine filmmaker director Don Roos is becoming.</P>
