<PRE>                        THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS is a
          modest, pleasant trading-identity comedy with at
          least a little serious thought at its core.  The
          plot is a bit contrived and far-fetched but its
          anti-lookist theme sets this film apart from many
          romantic comedies.  If only Michael Lehmann's film
          practiced what it preaches, this comedy would be a
          lot easier to recommend.    Rating: high +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" is a popular radio talk show for pet
owners to call in and ask questions of veterinarian Abby Barnes (played
by Janeane Garofalo of "The Larry Sanders Show").  Abby is intelligent
and very funny, but she feels she is short and plain-looking.
(Garofalo herself is actually attractive, but perhaps is plain by
Hollywood actress standards.)  To put it mildly, Abby is extremely
self-conscious about her looks, particularly when compared to her tall,
blond neighbor Noelle Slusarsky (Uma Thurman).  When a listener to her
program, Brian (Ben Chaplin), becomes interested in Barnes and wants to
set up a rendezvous with her, he needs a description, and on a lark
Abby describes Noelle.  So begins a love triangle in which Brian thinks
he loves a single woman with Abby's personality and Noelle's body.  He
believes Noelle is actually Abby and that Abby is the veterinarian's
friend Donna.  If the basic plot sounds familiar, it borrows no small
amount from Rostand's play "Cyrano de Bergerac" or perhaps that play's
reframing in modern terms, ROXANNE.  The result is the sort of light
romantic comedy with the two women trying to pull off the charade and
keep Brian from suspecting.  But eventually the plot gets beyond the
charade into the question of what is it that is the source of the real
attraction?  Is it the physical beauty of Noelle or is it the
personality of Abby?  The film makes some very serious, albeit sugar-
coated, observations about how our society discriminates by degree of
attractiveness.</P>
<P>     And if one wants to see examples of that discrimination in action,
one need only look at the billing of this film.  Top billing goes to
Uma Thurman who is not the main character, has fewer lines than Abby,
and who has less personality on the screen.  The practical fact is that
Thurman is more of a star, particularly after PULP FICTION.  As such
she has more marquee value.  Viewing audiences are perceived as having
precisely the same set of misplaced values about which the film is
complaining.  Had Janeane Garofalo gotten top billing one might feel a
little better about the film.  This is not to say that Thurman does a
bad job, by any means.  This may well be her best role to date.  She is
in some ways a mirror image of Garofalo's character.  Garofalo is
actually attractive but believes she is ugly.  This may have been an
artifact of bad casting or it may be intentional.  Thurman's character
is relatively bright but has convinced herself that she is all looks
and hairdo with nothing of any substance inside of her.  In any case
Thurman, knowing she has top billing, is content to let Garofalo be the
real star.  And Garofalo easily fills the vacuum with sparkle and wit.</P>
<P>     This is a first produced script by Audrey Wells whose previous
work includes being a jazz disk jockey and producing and directing
political commercials.  Some of her dialogue is very funny, though
often one gets the feeling that real people are not this witty
spontaneously and the conversations are too polished to be credible.
Of course the same complaint could be leveled at Woody Allen's screen
writing.  Probably more bothersome is the character of Brian who seems
to be incredibly dense not to realize that the shorter woman has both
the voice and the quick wit of the woman on the radio.  He seems
perfectly willing to believe that the tall blond who is afraid of his
dog and the radio veterinarian who has explained to him how to handle
and calm that dog could be the same woman.  The fact that Uma Thurman's
character has to consult with Janeane Garofalo's character before
treating a turtle does not seem to tip him off that there is anything
strange going on.</P>
<P>     The film boasts a bouncy score by Howard Shore, who is good when
he does his own composing, but the film relies a little too much on
source music.  Telephones seem to play a large part in THE TRUTH ABOUT
CATS & DOGS and it would not surprise me to hear that this film has
contributed greatly to the sale of cordless phones.  There is even an
advertisement for an identifiable long distance phone company played in
the background of one scene, which seems a somewhat crass touch.
Direction of this somewhat spotty is by Michael Lehmann whose own
career has been spotty, having directed HEATHERS, MEET THE APPLEGATES,
HUDSON HAWK, and AIRHEADS.</P>
<P>     THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS could have stressed its more serious
theme a little more, but it is an enjoyable comedy and rates a high +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
