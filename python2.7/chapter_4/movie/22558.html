<PRE>AIMEE & JAGUAR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>As World War II enters its cataclysmic last act, the Allied bombers are
reducing Berlin to rubble.  The city's inhabitants, much like those in
the recent end of the world picture, LAST NIGHT, have a fatalistic view
of their future.  They try to keep up a semblance of normalcy, going to
the zoo and to the symphony, but they know that the next explosion may
be the end for them.  And for those of Jewish ancestry, a bullet by the
Gestapo may get them even sooner.</P>
<P>Against this backdrop, Max Färberböck's AIMEE & JAGUAR, based on Erika
Fischer's book, tells the true story of an unlikely lesbian love affair
between Lilly Wust (Juliane Köhler), a married mother of 4, and Felice
Schragenheim (Maria Schrader), a Jewish member of the underground.  (The
private names they used for each other were Aimee and Jaguar, hence the
story's title.)</P>
<P>Lilly's husband, Günther (Detlev Buck), a frontline soldier, has visits
home.  Both husband and wife are openly promiscuous with neither doing a
great deal to hide the fact.  When Lilly catches Günther making out with
Ilse (Johanna Wokalek), the children's nanny, he explains his action as
the inevitable effect of a man's libido.  The unflappable Günther does
lose his cool when he first realizes that his wife has a female lover,
which is the same reaction that Lilly has when Felice kisses her for the
first time.  Although Felice is an in-the-open lesbian, Lilly has always
assumed herself to be completely straight.</P>
<P>As the prim and slightly silly Lilly, Juliane Köhler gives a strong
performance with equal measures of fiery passion and frightened
vulnerability.  In contrast, Maria Schrader, as Felice, approaches her
character with a certain detachment.  The result is a love affair that's
never quite convincing.</P>
<P>More effective are the film's impressive atmospherics.  As bombers light
the sky a burning red, the cameras pan over the monuments of the
would-be invincible Nazi regime.  When Lilly goes to the zoo to fetch
her children, she walks past huge mounds of rubble in the streets.  And,
as the Berlin Philharmonic plays Beethoven's glorious 9th symphony, the
concert is interrupted by an air raid, much to the consternation of the
conductor, who demands, without success, that his players finish the
movement.</P>
<P>After telling Lilly of the men in his unit who have died, Günther
reveals his secret for his remarkable longevity at the front.  "You have
to duck first, that's the secret," he tells her.  Lilly, however,
doesn't duck, leaving luck to protect her.  Loving her girlfriend openly
and naively, she doesn't even realize that Felice and Felice's friends
are Jews.</P>
<P>Like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the movie is bracketed by appearances of Lilly
today.  As she lives the last few years of her life in a nursing home,
she still pines for Felice.  Felice, a woman who always made the most of
her situation, had a favorite word, "now."  "I want lots of 'nows'," she
said, and she lived her life accordingly, regardless of the bombs or the
Gestapo.</P>
<P>AIMEE & JAGUAR runs 2:05.  It is in German with English subtitles.  The
film is not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity and some violence.
It would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film, which was released last year in parts of Europe, does not yet
have a United States release date.  It opened the Berlin Film Festival
in 1999 and will open the Berlin and Beyond Film Festival in San
Francisco on Friday, January 14, 2000.  You can find the Berlin and
Beyond Film Festival information at its web site:
