<PRE>The End Of The Affair Review</PRE>
<P>  "The End Of The Affair" is a dark and moody romantic period piece, that Neil
Jordan exquisitely writes and directs. Although it's slow and sometimes
confusing to follow, it still manages to give audiences a moving experience.
  Based on Graham Greene's novel of the same name, the film mainly follows 3
characters. There's Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) who has an affair with
Henry Mile's (Stephen Rea) wife Sarah (Julianne Moore). Sarah finds Henry to be
a bore, because well, he's just a normal guy. It's all work and no play with
him. While Maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with Sarah, and would
do anything for her. Unfortunately the two break up. This is all witnessed in a
serious of flashbacks, so that leads us to the present. It's a few years later,
and they both still think of each other, so Maurice hires a private detective
(Ian Hart) to see what Sarah is up too. While this may sound straight forward
it's not. It's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men,
unhappiness, and the ever lasting love. 
  All this may sound like a drag, but it really captures your interest. With
great performances by Ralph Fiennes (doing another English Patient type of
film, only this movie is better) and Julianna Moore who definitely deserves an
Oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999, I believe this was the role,
she had the most passion for, and you can see why. The story was also well
written thanks to Neil Jordan. Even though I didn't read the book, there's no
doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive. What's so moving
about it you ask? The tragedy of it all. It's not the typical romance, in which
a guy finds a girl, they fall in love and all is well, this is more complicated
and depressing. It really shows the complexity of a relationship, because
nothing is ever perfect. Everyone feels a different way and that is what tears
us to pieces.
  Back to Neil Jordan's script, it wasn't only red roses. There were times when
I felt it too be a little slow, but most Romances are. It also tended to be a
bit confusing, especially at the start. It keep jumping around from past to
present, so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things. Also a notable
was the superb direction by Neil Jordan. I'd have to say this is his finest
achievement to date, because quite frankly I've never really found his work to
be up to par. It just never did anything for me, until now.
  When it ends, it leaves viewers a little saddened, but provoked nonetheless.
This is definitely one of the best films of 99, and had some of the best
acting, most notably by Moore. Not for all movie goers, but for those who are
film buffs and want something of value.</P>
