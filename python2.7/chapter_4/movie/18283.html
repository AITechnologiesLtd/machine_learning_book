<P>CHARACTER  (director: Mike van Diem; cast: Fedja van Huet
(Katadreuffe),  Jan Decleir (Dreverhaven), Betty Shuurman (Joba
Katadreuffe), Victor Low (De Gankelaar), Tamar van den Dop (Lorna te
George), Hans Kesting (Jan Maan), 1997- Netherlands)</P>
<P>The somber experiences of a Dutch boy growing up during the 1930s in
Rotterdam and raised by a house maid mother who refuses her employer's
offer of marriage after he impregnates her after one time of lust.This
dark story is a tale of revenge and hatred for these three characters,
as they try to come to terms with each other. It is told in flashback,
with a voice-over.</P>
<P>The boy (Fedja) succeeds and becomes a lawyer despite all the obstacles
of a father's hatred, a mother's coldness and silence; and, his poverty
and illegitimate birthright. In the opening scene, we are left with the
impression that Fedja knifed his father to death. The police grill him
and, thusly, his life story unfolds. We learn of the boy's character:
how he is ruled by hatred for his father, making his life focus
singularly on succeeding at any cost, even giving up his one chance for
happiness by not courting the lovely bookkeeper (Tamar), who works in
his office. We never get to fully understand his mother's (Betty)
character, except that she is an enormously proud person, and shows
great strength in raising her son without any help. She does not hate
him, yet she displays no affection for him except to protect him with
her motherly instincts from the dangers of the outside world, a world
she has shut herself off from. She takes in a border, a young communist
(Jan), who lends some humanity to her rigid life. We don't know why, but
she never has another man after her marriage refusal.</P>
<P>The father is the most feared bailiff in town, collecting debts and
throwing people out of their homes when they fall behind in their
payments. His character is shown by his motto: "The law is without
compassion." His bravery is a result of his death wish, is the opinion
of those who know him best. He is a man deeply tormented by troubling
thoughts of demonic proportions, a character molded out of the Old
Testament.</P>
<P>Fedja tries desperately to escape from his karma, but can't. The lawyer
who hires him (Victor), believes in him and tries to show him some
humanity, becoming his mentor and counsel in his bankruptcy hearings.
But even he can't penetrate Fedja's severe emotional problems. The crux
of the film is about the battle of wills between father and son, and how
hatred reduces the family to have no future. The father is devastated by
Betty's refusal to accept his marriage proposal. The mother has given up
on life and has nothing more to give. And Fedja's pursuit of his goal,
has left him in a hopeless situation, with no chance for securing love
or happiness.</P>
<P>Tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent
story and exceptionally fine performances.This a dark film, and it is
grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood. What is troubling about the
film, is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored. In
any case, it is better this way than the usual sentimental Hollywood
rags to riches treatment of such a story.This film is more in the spirit
of reading someone like Dickens, with strong oedipal emotions added to
the bleakness of the story, as it is adapted from a novel by Ferdinand
Bordewijk .</P>
