<PRE>Lost In Space</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: * (out of 4 = poor)</PRE>
<PRE>1998, PG-13, 130 minutes [2 hours, 10 minutes]
[science fiction]</PRE>
<P>starring: William Hurt (Prof. John Robinson), Matt Leblanc (Major Don
West), Gary Oldman (Dr. Smith), Heather Graham (Judy Robinson);
written by Akiva Goldsman; produced by Carla Fry, Akiva Goldsman,

<P>Seen May 2, 1998 at 3:40 p.m. at the Crossgates Cinema 18, theater
#13, with Chris Wessell and Sean O'Shea for $5. [Theater rating:
***1/2: very good sound, picture, and seats]</P>
<P>        The big-budget, mega-hype "event" movie is becoming so trendy
now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal
one. Gluttony is Hollywood's favorite sin, but it is the movie-goers
who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an
ever-worsening basis. "Lost In Space" is the latest such offering - a
film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre. It's made
up of every element of science fiction, but at no time does it evoke
the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for.</P>
<P>        Audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is
the trend with such films, this one opens with a fast-paced space
battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film
(probably because it has "Star Wars" written all over it), but as the
producers' way of showing off their budget through the special
effects. Battle scenes are worthless without tension, and since we
have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about
anything that happens. In essence, the entire segment works like a
teaser for an arcade game, not a piece of filmmaking.</P>
<P>        We meet the Robinson family - a family of five that does not
get along but has been chosen to act on Earth's behalf in effort to
find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of
our natural resources. Each member of the family has a special trait
and personality, and yet none of them seem like actual
people. Professor John Robinson (Hurt) is the intelligent, quiet
leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and
marriage are suffering without his realizing it (it's obvious what
role this aspect will play). Of course this is all established through
extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing
and bickering among themselves and with each other, while the
necessary problems are "resolved" at the right moments. The only thing
worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely
serious manner without a trace of satire, and is so pathetic it's
laughable.</P>
<P>        The first act is not a building of a story, but a
juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in
all the required elements (such as plot, conflict, and
characterization - God forbid!). We're provided with the minimum
amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being
completely silent. In fact, it might as well be since the dialogue is
virtually non-existent. Yes, the characters do speak, but they do not
talk.  They say things that only relate to the conflict, but they
never really interact (unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes
between arrogant Major Don West (Leblanc) and uptight, unemotional
Judy Robinson (Graham)).</P>
<P>        It's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic
plot devices that so little happens. Eventually the pacing rapidly
increases, but the amount of genuine interest does not. The story
finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the
Robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to
defeat Dr. Smith (Oldman), the cartoony villain, and his plans for
sabotage.</P>
<P>        What ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated
conflicts. The first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship
and what ensues could best be described as "Alien"-lite. The story
changes again when the Robinsons crash land on an alien planet and
must act quickly to escape it and survive.  But there's never any real
notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders
aimlessly. Plotlines are developed, but each becomes totally
irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario. The
atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and
various time paradoxes, but it's presented in such a ridiculous way
it's utterly boring. By the time the last act rolls around, there is
no sense of a payoff building. The ending does not go out on a high
note with any kind of climax, instead, it seems to come to a sudden
halt (but at least it ends at all).</P>
<P>        "Lost In Space" is major film production at its worst. It's
frightening that a film so poorly written, directed, and acted might
be considered mainstream entertainment.</P>
