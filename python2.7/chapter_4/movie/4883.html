<P>High-quality German cinema and transfixing history combine 
beautifully in ROSA LUXEMBURG, a film I recommend highly. It 
covers mainly the crucial years 1898-1919 of "Red Rosa"'s 
life, when the Polish-born political activist, heroine and 
martyr of the Social Democrats, lived mostly in Germany. </P>
<P>On January 15, 1919, Rosa and her comrade Karl Liebknecht were 
murdered  by Freikorps troops of--ironically--the new Social 
Democrat German Republic.  Arguably, they were the first 
victims of the Nazi system to come. </P>
<P>Rosa was an idealist and a purist, intransigent in politics 
and love. She was a spellbinding orator, an indefatigable 
worker, speechmaker and writer, a firebrand who tolerated no 
timorousness, personal or ideological compromises or political 
cliches. Prison was a way of life for her--she was jailed nine 
times. </P>
<P>Margarethe von Trotta's film should fascinate all those who 
are interested in cinema that deals with big issues 
which--like this work--even transcend their main subject. And  
Rosa Luxemburg is a very tricky subject to handle. Today's 
standards are infinitely more exacting than the old ones of 
barefaced propaganda (e.g. films made under the Third Reich) 
or the old Hollywood biographies with their sentimentalities, 
heroics,simplifications and feeble-minded manicheism. </P>
<P>Now films like ROSA must re-invent the genre, case by case. 
Director Von Trotta does this excellently, balancing 
dangerously between documentarism and fiction, between 
personality and the wider historical context. </P>
<P>Rosa was  so  active and  complex  that any single film on her 
must be selective.  On my second viewing of ROSA in 20 months, 
I found the film's presentation of its intense heroine and its 
political background even more entrancing than the first time. 
There is enough here to feed a miniseries. </P>
<P>Before the movie came out, Von Trotta said :" I have collected 
so much material that I could make two more films....Some 
historians will find my film very incomplete. It wasn't my aim 
to create a work of history but a portrait of Rosa. But I feel 
that for all the people who don't know her, the film will help 
them discover her. Rosa is used in the East as in the West. In 
West Germany, the stamp showing her portrait was unacceptable 
to the public. In the East they use her for political ends and 
play down her opposition to Lenin."</P>
<P>Curiously, historians did not object to the film. Only  a few 
"instant-expert" reviewers criticized some of the movie's 
liberties--specifically the death of Kostia Zetkin, Rosa's 
lover and the son of her friend Clara Zetkin--when in 
actuality it was Hans Diefenbach, Kostia's successor,  who was 
killed in World War II.  </P>
<P>The big--and perhaps only--love of Rosa's life was Leo 
Jogiches (played with sober presence by Daniel Olbrychski), 
who, even after he was rejected by Rosa because he had cheated 
on her, remained her collaborator.</P>
<P>Neither Jogiches nor anyone else from the movie's Who's Who 
among the Social Democrats has a foreground role in ROSA. 
Wisely, Ms. von Trotta has concentrated on her central figure 
without diluting her two hours of Rosa with efforts to fill in 
details of Karl Liebknecht, Karl and Luise Kautsky, Clara 
Zetkin, August Bebel, Jean Jaures, and the other, by now 
legendary, political figures of the period. </P>
<P>Nonetheless, they are all there. By making every moment of 
their screen presence count in a forceful way, those activists 
are woven into history without being merely supporting cast. 
But it is, of course, Rosa who dominates the film, both by the 
way the script is written and through Barbara Sukowa's superb 
performance. She won the Best Actress Award at the 1986 Cannes 
Festival.  </P>
<P>Luxemburg-Sukowa is a true believer in the people, above 
parties and systems; she is a figure of utter resilience, 
passionate yet lucid; she is a woman deeply conscious of art, 
literature, and of nature (in contemporary German terms she 
would be both a Red and a Green). Rosa is also a woman of 
abnegation who suffers for others but not  for herself. </P>
<P>Of her  approximately 2,500 letters that von Trotta studied, 
one, addressed to Sophie Liebknecht, describes  in Rosa's 
wonderfully touching prose the mistreating of a wagon-pulling 
ox by a soldier in Rosa's prison yard. </P>
<P>Von Trotta has condensed it with skill, retaining its essence 
as well as its ending :"Oh my poor buffalo, my poor beloved 
brother, here we are, the two of us, powerless and helpless, 
united in our pain and nostalgia."</P>
<P>The writer-director originally tried to find a bilingual 
(German-Polish) as well as Jewish actress for the part . She 
was unable to do so. It was a stroke of luck, as she turned to 
Barbara Sukowa, who, although she looks nothing like the real 
Rosa, has absorbed her personality magnificently. She even 
learned Polish and uses a slight Polish accent in her German.</P>
<P>Rosa's Jewishness is not stressed in the movie. This is not an 
avoidance reaction on the part of Ms. von Trotta, but because 
at the time the intellectual Jews were totally assimilated 
into the German mainstream. Furthermore, Rosa herself had a 
world view of her mission, which precluded any feelings of 
nationalism or ethnicity. On the other hand, the predominance 
of Jews in the SPD (German Socialist Party) is obvious in the 
film.</P>
<P>The movie is one of much talk and dialectics, of considerable 
excitement if you are in the least curious about history. 
There are uncanny relevancies to our own day--not only to the 
situation in the Germany of the 1980s but also in Rosa's 
resounding, pacifist speeches. </P>
<P>Perhaps the most poignant moment of this hearfelt film is the 
1914 defection of socialists, all over Europe. Initially they 
resisted the coming war. Alas, pressures, conformism and 
chauvinism led to a mass betrayal of principles, of  logic and 
of sanity. It happened in Germany, it also happened in other 
countries. The door to the madness and tragedy of the guns of 
August was open.</P>
<P>Remarkable too is ROSA's powerful feminism--but not in the 
usual sense. Rosa herself was impatient with it and delegated 
this particular struggle to others. The feminism lies in the 
way that the movie's Rosa, though given a great deal of 
femininity, is not for a moment thought or spoken of as a 
woman, a female or an exception, whether within or without the 
socialist circles. </P>
<P>The question of sexism never comes up. The way von Trotta puts 
us before a moral-social given of equality and 
non-discrimination, the way it flows so naturally, ennobles, 
in this respect, the socialists of all hues, even those who 
were Rosa's ideological adversaries. We have not progressed 
much in one full century. </P>
<P>[Note: Review written Nov.20,87. A third, recent screening of 
the film changes nothing of its quality and validity]. </P>
