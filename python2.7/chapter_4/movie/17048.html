<P>It has been said that men achieve a piece of immortality through their
children. Fathers and sons in particular are a uniquely bound pair,
having a historical precedent of patriarchal family living. Some sons
aspire to be the great men their fathers were, while others live under
the shadow of their father's legacy. In the case of Wade Whitehouse
(Nick Nolte), his father's legacy was one of drunken abandon, a legacy
which now frightens him in a very personal manner in Paul Schrader's
character drama AFFLICTION.</P>
<P>Wade, a character essayed in fine form by the accomplished Nolte, is a
man who's being sucked into a black hole of desperate living. His wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) left him, and due to his reckless lifestyle, has taken
their daughter (Brigid Tierney) with only minimal visitation rights. His
life is plagued by a multitude of minor problems which snowball into a
giant, aggrivating circumstance: his car's transmission is bad, he has a
toothache, he can barely afford to pay his lawyer, and he's frightened
to death of becoming the man his father is. </P>
<P>His father (James Coburn), as we learn, beat him and his brother Rolfe
(Willem Dafoe) as children; the old man lives on now in a drunken stupor
of harmlessness. Yet the tensions between Wade and his father are now
greater than ever, due to a lifetime of silent confrontation. Nolte and
Coburn really accentuate this relationship, and through excellent
casting the father-son bond is truly authentic. Nolte, in particular,
offsets some of the horrible risks this film takes by wearing the
character of Wade like a second skin. </P>
<P>Some of the risks that AFFLICTION takes pay off, and some do not. For
instance, center-wrapping the movie around the character of Wade pays
off because of Nolte's excellent work. Deviating from the conventional
plot structure and allowing Wade to simply hit bottom does not work.
Using a particular deer hunting accident to emphasize Wade's crooked
mind does work; attempting to turn the accident into a mystery and then
dropping it does not work. Also, the script suffers when it discards the
characters of Rolfe and Margie (Wade's love interest, played by Sissy
Spacek), for they are the stabilizers of Wade's life and the audience's
only sympathetic characters. </P>
<P>In all, AFFLICTION is a dark and scary character study of the common
man. It has a very realist point of view, evident because the chain of
events is very plausible. And the atmosphere bears no hint of lightness.
This is a different kind of movie for a different kind of crowd. </P>
