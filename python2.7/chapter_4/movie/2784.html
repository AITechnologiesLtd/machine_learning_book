<PRE>                                   FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by John M. Bozeman
                        Copyright 1994 John M. Bozeman</PRE>
<P>     In general, I tend to avoid plays and movies that I think will be
sappy and/or overly sentimental--not because I have an intrinsic
dislike for them, but because they are such a hit-or-miss affair.  A
good production of DEATH OF A SALESMAN left me misty-eyed.  A STAR IS
BORN had me wishing that the guy had killed himself a lot sooner than
he did.  Thus, it was with much reluctance that I went to see FORREST
GUMP.  I must say, however, that I was most pleasantly surprised by
what I found.</P>
<P>     Forest Gump is a man with not particularly bright prospects.  Born
in rural Alabama, he has a curved spine and a low IQ.  He does have a
few things going for him, though:  a resourceful mother (Sally Field)
who loves him, one friend who helps him through school, a good heart,
and a lot of luck.  Running from bullies allows him to discover a
talents that carry him though college and the army and eventually to
run a successful business.</P>
<P>     But, as the cliche goes, arrival at the destination is not as
important is the journey.  Gump wears many hats along the way to his
destiny, and his simple, direct approach to life is usually a blessing
to those around him.  Indeed, while a lot has been said about the
film's spectacular special effects, these are overshadowed by the sheer
humanity of the story.  The plot itself is not terribly original
(boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-becomes-famous-and-maybe-gets-girl)
and the underlying theme (do your job, work hard, be yourself, and you
will do well) is rather conservative.  Instead the movie is successful
through old-fashioned cinematic virtues such as characterization,
pacing, and irony.  Gump, brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, allows us to
perceive our world through the eyes of a simpleton, and thus see how
funny--and how stupid, and how sad, and occasionally how heroic--people
can be.  The result is a film that is sometimes funny, sometimes sad,
but always engrossing.</P>
<P>Overall rating:  A (worth seeing even at full price)</P>
