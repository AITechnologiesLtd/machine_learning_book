<PRE>                             THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     THE LAST SEDUCTION is an excellent black comedy and thriller about
lying, betrayal, sex, and murder.  It is directed by John Dahl and
written by Steve Barancik.  It stars Linda Fiorentino as literally the
toughest woman in movie history.  She is tougher than nails, never
vulnerable, and would do absolutely anything to get what she wants.</P>
<P>     The movie bears some resemblance to the tough and double dealing
of Barbara Stanwyck in DOUBLE INDEMNITY (which I saw about a year ago
on cable - check it out some time, it is excellent too).  The script is
sharp and witty.  The staccato tone of the script reminds me of some of
David Mamet's writing especially in his movie HOUSE OF GAMEs.</P>
<P>     THE LAST SEDUCTION is about a woman (Fiorentino) who talks her
husband (Bill Pullman) into dealing drugs and then skips town with all
the money ($700,000) even though loan sharks are threatening to maim
and then kill him.  All of this happens in the first few minutes.  The
rest of the show takes place mainly into a middle American community in
upstate New York where she finds a "boyfriend" (Peter Berg).  He claims
he is just her sex toy.  One of the messages he leaves on her answering
machine is "I love you and I am sure the feeling is mutual - you love
you too".</P>
<P>     There are lots of plot twists - some predictable, some not, and
one quite surprising.  There are many great scenes.  The pick up scene
in the bar has never been done that way before and really worked well.</P>
<P>     In a typical Hollywood movie, we would eventually find
Fiorentino's character's sweet side, but not here - she is a complete
and perfectly evil character with no redeeming qualities.  It is
fascinating watching Fiorentino to see what she will do next.  It was
perfect casting having her play the lead.  Like the devil, it was easy
to be drawn to her.  She is quite an attractive actress.  The husband
and the boyfriend also are well chosen and do a good job.</P>
<P>     See if you like the ending.  At first, I thought it too abrupt and
then decided it was a good ending after all.</P>
<P>     I have no criticism of the show.  If you like black comedy like
say HAROLD AND MAUDE or DOUBLE INDEMNITY, you will probably like this
show.  It is not a movie for everyone, but I certainly recommend it and
award it ***.  The movie is not rated, but would be R for sex, some
profanity, a little nudity, non-gory and non-bloody violence, and an
adult theme.  I would not take teenagers to see it; it is an adult
show.  It runs a well edited 1:50.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
