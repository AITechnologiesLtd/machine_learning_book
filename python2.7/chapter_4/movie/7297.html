<P>     Jean-Claude Van Damme's third pairing with a renowned Chinese film-
maker-- director Tsui Hark, a veteran of fifty films including ONCE UPON
A TIME IN CHINA-- is wonderfully dumb fun.  And, I believe, even more
movie than either HARD TARGET (directed by John Woo) or last year's MAX-
IMUM RISK (Ringo Lam).  In fact, the plot is so convoluted that even *I*
couldn't follow all the twisty turns.  (Terrorists.  Counter-terrorists.  
Six-foot-eight arms dealers.  Pregnant wives in peril.  A Roman order of
Internet-surfing monks.  An island think tank of "retired" specialists.
And one big Bengal tiger.  Got it?) However head-spinning it sounds,
this is another movie of stunts and set pieces and explosions.  Lots of
explosions.  Forget the holes.  Forget the believability quotient.  For-
get the high-profile presence of Dennis Rodman, one of many internation-
al "stars" who appear here.  It's Hark, his editor, and his many stunt
coordinators and choreographers who take your breath away.  All you have
to do is buy a ticket.  And a Coke.  </P>
