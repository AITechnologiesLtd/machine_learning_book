<P>She's coquettish. She's defiant. She's a somnolent rag doll. She's a 
fiery feminist. She's Elizabeth I of England, self-proclaimed Virgin 
Queen and star of "Elizabeth," a revisionist historical drama that 
manages to entertain and annoy all at the same time. In his first English-
language film, director Shekhar Kapur tries to satisfy the Masterpiece 
Theatre and MTV crowds simultaneously. The result is an interesting, 
often frustrating work that suffers from a case of cinematic multiple 
personality disorder. </P>
<P>Cate Blanchett, so wonderful in "Oscar and Lucinda," plays the monarch 
who took the throne in 1558 and ruled England for 45 years. Emulating a 
statue of the Virgin Mary, she assumed the Virgin Queen moniker following 
a bizarre change in her physical appearance. After hours of work by her 
handmaidens, she stunned her subjects by striding out in a stylized wig 
and regal clothing, with an application of make-up turning her skin a 
stark, unearthly white. Basically, she became the 16th century equivalent 
of Michael Jackson.</P>
<P>The film is dripping with intrigue, as damn near everybody plots to 
either kill Elizabeth or co-opt her reign through marriage. Along the way,
 Kapur employs a variety of self-conscious stylistic tricks to give the 
film a hip feel. He's quite fond of rotation. During many sequences, if 
one character isn't circling another, the camera is circulating everybody 
(sensitive viewers may wish to bring some Dramamine). The twirling 
cinematography, as well as several fade-to-white segues, gets old fast. 
The most annoying camera gimmick comes when Elizabeth nervously prepares 
for a speech and Kapur uses quick jump-cuts to show her anxious rehearsal.
 The effect is wildly out-of-place for a historical piece, resembling the 
flubbed line outtakes that pop up during the closing credits of an 
episode of "Home Improvement." </P>
<P>Why Kapur felt compelled to jazz things up is beyond me. God knows 
there's enough drama in the screenplay's Byzantine plotlines. While 
virtually every major character in the film is scheming against Elizabeth,
 the Catholic Church serves as the prime villain, with Kapur helpfully 
supplying ominous music whenever the political intrigue moves to the 
Vatican. Speaking of characters, the film boasts some very colorful ones, 
ranging from the reptilian Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) to the 
Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel), the cross-dressing brother of the King of 
France.</P>
<P>While the supporting players are certainly interesting, the film centers 
on only three characters. Joseph Fiennes is bland as Sir Robert Dudley, 
Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth's duplicitous lover. Much more interesting 
is royal hatchet man Sir Francis Walsingham, a dark figure who casts a 
long shadow despite limited screen time, thanks to an extremely focused 
performance from Geoffrey Rush. And then there's Elizabeth, given a 
decidedly peculiar, but mesmerizing presence by Cate Blanchett. With an 
odd combination of side glances and secret smiles, Blanchett's Elizabeth 
often seems preoccupied, as if listening to distant voices or remembering 
happier times. </P>
<P>"Elizabeth" is full of lavish set pieces, violent imagery and eccentric 
personalities. The film may be messy, but it certainly held my attention. 
Ultimately, though, the story is so emotionally detached that I found it 
difficult to fully invest in the fates of the players. If Kapur had spent 
less time on jazzy camera moves and more time exploring the passion 
behind the characters' facades, "Elizabeth" might have packed the desired 
punch. As is, it comes off as merely a sterile, historically inaccurate 
period piece with way-cool visuals. </P>
