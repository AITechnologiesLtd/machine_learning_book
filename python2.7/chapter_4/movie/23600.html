<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>What can I say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots, was
driven by a fantastic performance by Bruce Willis as a contract killer,
but was disturbingly vulgar (the murder of an undercover cop is used as
part of the comedy routine), except to say that it was driven by
characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other. It
was also a more palatable of a film than I thought it would be. These
demented zany characters, not one of them who was without a blemished
soul (reminiscent of Pulp Fiction and Analyze This), is a popular
reworking of the gangster film into comedy, a phenomena of recent times
worth taking note of in the gangster genre. The result is a film that
gets over, more or less, as a parody. A film that is farcical and loopy,
but leaves a lot to be desired. It still looks likes like a sitcom to
me.</P>
<P>The plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more
characters are introduced. Oz Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a hapless
dentist living in Montreal with his harridan French-Canadian wife,
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), whose main asset seems to be her large boobs.
She also amusingly struggles with an improbable French-Canadian accent.
They have been living together for seven unhappy years, after her
father, a dentist whose partner was Oz, embezzled funds and committed
suicide, sticking Oz with the debt. She is disappointed that the likable
Oz can't make a good living out of his practice. So she hires a hit man,
or in this case a hit woman (Oz's new assistant Jill (Amanda), whose
role model is Jimmy the Tulip), to whack him to collect on his
life-insurance policy. But as coincidence would have it, Jimmy "The
Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a contract killer who killed 17 for a Hungarian
crime family in Chicago, the Gogolak Gang, becomes Oz's next-door
neighbor, in this middle-class suburban Montreal area. Jimmy got away
with just five years in prison after ratting out the gang's leader. He
has refused to go into the witness protection program. We first see him
confidently grinning, as his stammering neighbor introduces himself. The
trembling Oz recognizes who his neighbor is and the two start a
friendship which will be tested many times for how strong its loyalty
is.</P>
<P>Sophie talks Oz into giving Jimmy's location away to Jimmy's old mob
boss, Janni (Kevin Pollak). In return she will grant him a divorce. So
off to Chi town goes Oz, but who should meet him in his hotel room, but
a mammoth black man, about the size of the Sears Tower, Frankie Figs
(Duncan). He tells him he works for Janni and after punching the dentist
around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls, he
brings him to see Janni. The conversation from the heavily accented
Janni goes something like this, "I yust hate Yimmy. I vill kill the
wermin." Oz is then introduced to Jimmy's luscious wife Cynthia (Natasha
Henstridge) and is immediately attracted to her. What transpires is a
series of double and triple-crosses involving $10 million in cash, with
everyone except the dentist wanting someone whacked.</P>
<P>The British born director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny), after a
so-far mediocre career, has become more skilled at pacing a film, as the
non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly, which might
actually be its best asset. This is lighweight entertainment and should
work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script, questionable
values, and that there are no nice people in the film. Don't tell me the
dentist is a good guy, there should be no doubt about his character,
after he conspires with the contract killer to hide a series of murders!
But...the film is funny.</P>
