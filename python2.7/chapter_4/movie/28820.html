<PRE>THE SCORE
RATING: 6/10</PRE>

<P>PLOT:
An impenetrable building houses a very expensive European scepter. A pudgy rich
guy hooks an old school thief up with a new scammer on the block and asks them
to steal it. Once taken, the item would then be sold with monetary compensation
spread to all parties. Of course, the older thief is making sure that everyone
understands that this is his "last job" (yawn) and the rich, pudgy guy is Marlon
Brando. Aaaaaaaaand action! </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite its generic title and storyline, this film actually managed to entertain
me a little bit (a little bit, a little bit... ;). I liked watching it, dug the
score and the whole "shadowy" look, but mostly just went gaga over the three
generations of extremely talented and "method" actors appearing on the screen at
the same time. Not since DeNiro and Pacino went mano-a-mano in HEAT have I been
so excited. And as long as you don't go in expecting to see a fresh type of
caper movie, you might just enjoy some of it as well. In fact, the picture is
about 80% setup and 20% payoff, so most of the time you're just sitting there
watching DeNiro and Norton butt heads (which isn't an altogether bad place to
be, mind you). But the payoff paid off for me to a certain extent, and I
actually didn't see one of the twists coming (neat!). But let's not fool
ourselves here, this film would not have been made (or it might've been made but
gone straight to video), had it not been for the fact that it includes the big
three men on campus.</P>
<P>DeNiro, clocking in another solid performance, although not one that necessarily
stands out from his giant repertoire of films. Brando, in only a few choice
scenes, but making the most of his presence in the film by hamming it up,
splashing some French dialogue into his character and drinking water like it's
going out of style. And Norton, who surprisingly not only holds his own among
the legendary actors, but one-ups them with the strongest performance in the
whole movie. Granted, he's basically revisiting the same elements that scored
him an appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony for PRIMAL FEAR a few years
back, but it worked. Of course, I can't finish my review without mentioning the
fact that I was also a little taken with the film because it basically took
place in my backyard here in Montreal (and kudos to Oz for putting so much
French in the movie...yup, it's really like that here!).</P>
<P>But the bottom line with any film, especially those presented under the auspices
of the "heist" genre is that suspense, thrills and drama should be par for the
course, but unfortunately, this film lacked on all counts. Angela's Bassett's
presence was superfluous at best, and other than the film's final 15 minutes or
so, it barely had any tension whatsoever. But I'm still gonna recommend this
movie because I love all three of the main actors in it and had a blast watching
them here. Sure, the story could've used a slight tap of the originality stick,
but even though it was a little boring at times...I was never really bored!
(does that make any sense to anyone?). Anyway, see it if you dig the actors,
otherwise, just wait for video, a medium on which this film will likely be much
better appreciated. </P>
