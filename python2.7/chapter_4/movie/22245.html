<PRE>The "Mile" Well-Traveled
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>There is an underlying theme that runs through "The
Green Mile," which I think rings hauntingly true.  And
that message is this: Although love and brotherhood
are the pillars of society, evil constantly chips away
at its foundation.  Those who try to tirelessly uphold
goodness are subject to great duress.  Some grow weary
over time and give up.  Others continue their battle
through great sacrifice.  </P>
<P>"The Green Mile," set during the post-Depressionary
era in the deep South, is a touching and tender story
about two men who try to uphold these heavy pillars. 
Paul (Tom Hanks) is one of these men, whose outlook on
life is seriously challenged everyday.  He has taken
on some kind of ailment that causes him great pain. 
His best friend and warden of the Penitentiary (James
Cromwell) is suffering a personal tragedy.  And his
job immerses him in an environment that points toward
society's continual decline.  </P>
<P>Paul is a supervisor of correctional officers for Cell
Block E at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. 
Prisoners who come to this particular cellblock are
all convicted murderers who will soon be executed for
their heinous crimes.  One new arrival severely taxes
Paul's love for humanity.  Nicknamed ‘Wild Bill' (Sam
Rockwell), he is mean, vulgar, and openly invites
confrontation.  No one deserves a swifter death than
this morally depraved psychotic killer does.  Paul is
also baffled by the mean-spiritedness of one of his
officers, Percy (Paul Hutchison), who likes to lash
out at cellmates out of sheer petulance.  Percy is
nothing but a selfish wimp, but only gets his way
because he is the Governor's nephew.  These sets of
circumstances would be enough to tax any man's
patience.  Yet Paul believes that good exists in
everyone, and exercises compassion and charity in
everything he does.</P>
<P>One day, he receives a new prisoner name John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan).  He has been convicted of
brutally raping two young girls.  John is quite a
sight to behold.  With his muscular build and 300
pound, 7-foot tall frame, he could easily intimidate
the bravest of men.  But there's something gentile
about him.  "Do you leave the lights on after dark,"
he asks Paul in a deep, syrupy voice?  He's quiet and
simple-minded.  He's even afraid of the dark and
sometimes cries at night.  But what really humbles
Paul is John's unique gift of healing.  What John
possesses is a gift from God.  As Paul gets to know
him a little better, he begins to question his guilt. 
"I work with violent men everyday," he says.  "There
doesn't seem to be any real violence in him." </P>
<P>The "Green Mile" is a wonderfully told story,
purposeful in pace and thoughtful in its development. 
Characters slowly blossom like flowers in the morning
air.  It takes over an hour to meet before all of the
characters are fully introduced.  The result is an
emotionally compelling story filled with vivid
characters, each with affecting tales of their own. 
Tom Hanks effectively conveys fear and awe in light of
what he has seen as well as his personal anguish given
his duty at hand.  And the supporting characters all
add to the movies overall depth.  I only wished that
it were 30 minutes shorter.  It does take quite some
patience to be able to sit through a three-hour movie.
 And the first and last 15 minutes are not as
impactful as the rest of the film.  But your time will
be well rewarded, and when the Oscar nominations are
announced, I suspect that this film will be well
rewarded too.</P>
