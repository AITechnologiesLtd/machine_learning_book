<PRE>                                 NICK OF TIME
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The experiment was this:  Make an action/suspense movie that takes
place in *real time.*  That is, ninety minutes of film shows us ninety
consecutive minutes in the lives of the hero and villains.  Real time
has been done before (see also Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE, which is not
only in real time, but has the appearance of being one continuous shot
with no cuts).  Real time has never been done quite like this.</P>
<P>     In NICK OF TIME, director John Badham has taken a traditional
three-act thriller and jammed it into a sparse 90 minutes.  The plot
follows accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), now a single father of
seven-year old Lynn (Courtney Chase).  Arriving at Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles, Gene and Lynn are picked from the crowd by the
enigmatic Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) for a devious task.  Smith
gives Gene a gun and a little over an hour to commit a murder or else
his daughter will be killed.  The catch?  The target is the governor of
California (Marsha Mason).  Watson then has to balance the life of his
daughter with the far-ranging conspiracy he finds himself caught up
in.  And time is running out.</P>
<P>     The main problem is that the plot is basically silly, because
*everywhere* Watson goes, he finds another flunkie working for Smith.
Even some of those closest to the governor are in on it, any number of
whom could pull the trigger, certainly better than some accountant
picked from the train station.  But Smith's scheme is to frame Watson
as a nut case so Smith can walk off scott free, and because Smith
follows the flustered Watson around all the time, after forty-five
minutes you know he'd be better off letting Watson go and shooting the
governor himself, just to end the hassle.</P>
<P>     Good pacing and the experimental nature of the film tend to
overcome the lack of an engaging plot.  Of course, real time generally
means dead time, and Badham does a good job at keeping things moving so
you never get bored.  I'm not sure what it says about the film, but
keeping track of whether they're really on schedule with the frequent
shots of clocks is as much fun as watching the movie itself.  The
numerous scares indigenous to the thriller genre are also plentiful.</P>
<P>     Depp's acting is plain, and Walken hams it up until his character
has become the typical complete joke that he's becoming well-known
for.  The horrid Roma Maffia, as Smith's sidekick, almost manages to
bring the film crashing down, but she thankfully doesn't have enough
lines to cause too much damage.  Worth watching for is Charles Dutton
as a crusty, disabled shoe shine man who becomes Watson's only friend
and ally.</P>
<P>     Given that NICK OF TIME won't be a smashing success, it'll be some
time before the real-time experiment is tried again.  I'm looking
forward to another one, though.  But next time, folks, lets try to get
some criminals that aren't so completely stupid.</P>
