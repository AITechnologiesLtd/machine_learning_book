<P>Titanic
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Gloria
Stuart, and Bill Paxton
Written and Directed by James Cameron</P>
<P>    After months of speculation and delays, Titanic was quickly becoming
1997's Waterworld.  Incredibly overbudget, and hopelessly ambitious
(accroding to the insiders), this film had no chance, with no A list stars,
and all that money spent for a 3 hour, 15 minute love story.</P>
<P>Forget the negative hype: Titanic almost lives up to its price tag, and
its one heck of a great film.  From the beginning, this film grips you like
no other modern-day romance has.  It literally begins from the end, as we go
through Titanic, now at the bottom of the ocean.  We are looking through the
eyes of fortune-hunter Brock Lovett, who hasn't experienced Titanic, until
he meets actress Rose Calvert (Stuart), who claims to be a passenger.</P>
<P>Rose tells her story from the very first day.  She was a woman named
Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), whose family fortune is gone, and who is
being pressured into a marriage she doesn't want with a rich, powerful, and
unpleasant playboy named Cal Hockley (Zane).  Cal obviously wants Rose as a
trophy, and stops at nothing to get her.  He offers gifts by the dozen, he
gives her everything he has.  He courts her mother even more aggressively,
and the marriage is all but a done deal.</P>
<P>We also see our other main character, Jack Dawson.  Jack is a poor
artist, who manages to win his ticket onto the Ship of Dreams via a poker
game.  He is going home, to America.  Leonardo DiCaprio, in a role that
vaults him into stardom, plays this with an irrestible blend of charm and
exuberance.  We feel Jack's happiness, his dreams, and his life.</P>
<P>Rose, on the other hand, is a melancholy, depressed woman who is being
pressured into a world she doesn't want.  She makes a fateful attempt to
commit suicide, only to be stopped by Jack.  The two become close, and
during the course of a day fall in love.  Rose is trapped by her emotions,
and finally succumbs to Jack's charms.  On the fateful night, they are
together, and Rose declares her independence.</P>
<P>However, after the ship hits the iceberg, Cal, who is determined not to
lose his trophy, arranges for Jack to be arrested, and for Rose to come with
him.  As the ship sinks, Rose and Jack meet again, and they try desperately
for an escape, as both of them look to live and prosper together, as free
souls.</P>
<P>This may all sound like hackneyed Hollywood.  Believe me, it is.  The
dialogue is brilliant at times, and completely lousy at other times.
Cameron's writing is inane duirng much of the romance, and you get the
feeling this shoudn't work as a movie, despite a winning story.  But
DiCaprio and Winslet are irresistible.  Winslet gives the performance of a
lifetime.  She is brilliant, even better than the outstanding DiCaprio.
Zane plays his role with a nasty relish, and Kathy Bates, as the Unsinkable
Molly Brown, rounds out the superb supporting cast with a memorable
perfomance.  The cast makes the dialogue into gold.  You believe their
stories, you believe their fantasies.  So what if the character development
is lousy?  The acting makes up for it.  The details are so meticulously
drawn, the parties, the fun, the sheer pleasure of being young, of being in
love so much that nothing else matters, all of this contributes to a very
solid, very good romance.</P>
<P>Even then, the first 2 1/2 hours aren't great: they're merely very, very
good.  But Cameron becomes an inspired director at the end.  He is
frenetically brilliant, he directs with a passion, a fury, he crams an two
hours of anguish into one unforgettable hour of sheer fury, as he takes his
200 million dollar ship and violenty plunges it into the sea, taking 1500
people with it.  He matches his fury with the perils of the main characters,
blending in James Horner's beautiful music, contrasting the tragic beauty of
the supporting cast with the violence of the sinking.  The pity, the tragedy
hit the heart like nothing else. The little details, the playing of the
band, the children, the third class passengers, the commotion of the
sinking, all combine into a harrowing hour like nothing ever been done
before.  The emotional anguish of the sinking is still difficult to
describe.  The subtle touches, marked by brilliant performances by Victor
Garber and Bernard Hill as Thomas Andrews and Captain E.J. Smith are
wrenching.  The ending is simply devastating.  Nothing in film has prepared
you for this ending.</P>
<P>Cameron has created an epic that will live for a long time.  If only his
dialogue avoided cheesiness during the romance, this film could have been
one for all time.  As it is, the film is one of the best of the year.  Kudos
go again to DiCaprio, who will most certainly get an Oscar nomination, and
Winslet, who is the odds on favorite for best actress.  Horner's music is
something so emotionally captivating, it deserves best score of the year.
Bates and Stuart and marvelous, as is the underappreciated Billy Zane.
Frances Fisher, in her role as Rose's mother, is also very good.  Kudos also
to Jim Cameron, who had the will and the audacity to do something this
brazen and make it work.  This film is amazing.  Its not the best of the
year (L.A. Confidential's superb characters and plot are better), but damned
if its not the most emotional, and the most heart-wrenching.  This is
Hollywood entertainment at its very best.</P>
<PRE>FINAL: **** out of ****
