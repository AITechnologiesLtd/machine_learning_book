<PRE>                                THE SHVITZ
                       A film review by Linda Dubler
                        Copyright 1995 Linda Dubler</PRE>
<P>     Near the end of THE SHVITZ, a young man remembers a Yiddish word
that the old ladies of his childhood used to express their appreciation
of a visit to the steambaths.  "It's such a mecheieh," they'd say as
they splashed water on their ample bosoms, "such a pleasure."  The same
can be said of Jonathan Berman's intimate and affectionate film.  Shot
in a loose, cinema verite style, suffused with spontaneous humor and
propelled by a cast of natural storytellers, THE SHVITZ manages to make
the act of filming a bunch of naked strangers look effortless.  I
suppose it is relatively effortless to turn a camera on whatever or
whoever appears in front of the lens.  But to capture one's subject in
such a relaxed and casual a way, to present what would legitimately be
called oral history as a vivid and personal encounter, is  a challenge
that eludes many documentarians.</P>
<P>     What makes countless non-fiction films feel dull is the sense
that they are closed before they even open--they're codified,
defined, set up to deliver information and a point of view in the
manner of a dictionary or encyclopedia.  THE SHVITZ  is  dynamic in
part because it is structured as an inquiry.  Berman opens with the
most fundamental of questions--what is a shvitz?  From there, the
filmmaker launches into a search for the shvitz experience.  First stop
is Coney Island in the winter--a near empty boardwalk edged by
graffiti-splashed facades.  A conversation with a guy who remembers
the golden era when there were forty bathhouses in Coney Island alone
leads to a meeting with Ruby Jacobs, the owner of the Atlantis bar, who
once owned a number of baths himself.  An interview with a pack of
elderly fedora-hatted gentlemen, whose accents are as thick as their
mufflers, yields little but the comment that the shvitz is too
expensive now.  More helpful is a tiny old women with a face like a
dried apple doll's, who cheerfully extols the social pleasures of the
steambath:  "We tell jokes, we talk about intimate things, we laugh
about the men."</P>
<P>     Archival footage transports us back to the shtetl (village), to
the roots of the tradition.  A remarkably fit and sharp-witted man in
his eighties, the son of a cantor, recalls his first visit to the baths
at age four--"I couldn't take it" he says.  And then we're stepping
through the unassuming doorway of the Hope Avenue Russian Steambaths,
into the clutter of an ante room that looks surprisingly domestic.  A
few steps away lies the inner sanctum.  It's a simple chamber where the
patrons luxuriate like lazy walruses in the 260 degree heat, attended
to by a skinny naked man in a hat shaped like a flower pot, who lathers
them with oak leaves, splashes them with water, and at one point turns
to the filmmaker and says in stunning deadpan, "Kinda hot in here."</P>
<P>     Just as the advent of modern plumbing brought to an end the
widespread enjoyment of the shvitz, air conditioning has shaped a new,
less communal South.  THE SHVITZ may be a film about a northern, urban,
Jewish subculture, but the reason for its being--the need to
celebrate and preserve disappearing traditions--is close to
southerners.  Like an eager grandson, Berman has asked the right
questions and in THE SHVITZ he shares with us the loving answers.</P>
