<P>         Sandra Bullock often comes across onscreen as a slightly more
grown-up version of the girl who was everybody's friend in high school,
the one who always had a smile and some words of wisdom handy whenever
someone needed advice or comfort. That probably has a lot to do with why
her fans show up faithfully, even when her movies are dicey propositions
at best ("Forces of Nature," "Hope Floats," "Practical Magic").</P>
<P> Director Betty Thomas tries to get Bullock to turn on that old
charm again in "28 Days," in which Bullock plays Gwen, a writer who
spends more time mixing pills and cocktails than working on manuscripts.
But Bullock's not interested in coasting along on her charisma this time
out. Instead, she strains to come across as unbalanced, self-destructive
and defensive; she seems determined to show how much research she's done
on the subject, how much angst she can convey.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") insists
Gwen's alcoholism is presented in the sweetest, corniest fashion
possible, however, thereby undercutting everything the actress is
struggling to accomplish. The result is a 12-step misstep.</P>
<P> Because of the sizable number of romantic comedies she's made,
Bullock has often been compared to Meg Ryan, but if "28 Days" was
supposed to be her answer to Ryan's harrowing alcoholism saga "When a
Man Loves a Woman," it falls short in every category. Ripe with good
intentions and stuffed with bits and pieces ripped out of better films,
"28 Days" is a skin-deep dramedy that skillfully skates around most of
the nastier aspects of addiction. Anyone who's had a drinking problem or
participated in an intervention session will be offended by the offhand
way the movie trivializes the pain that substance abuse causes.</P>
<P> Gwen may have a tendency to misbehave when she drinks, but
she's still managed to somehow retain both her fresh-faced complexion
and a spacious, funky New York City loft. Even while going through a
series of life-changing crises, Gwen finds time to do her hair and
makeup flawlessly. She may be hitting bottom, folks, but the good news
is she still looks sensational.</P>
<P> After ruining the wedding of her sister Lily (Elizabeth
Perkins), Gwen lands in Serenity Glen, a rural rehab center where
recovering addicts chant empowering slogans and sing "Lean On Me" and
"Happy Trails To You" in between staging skits, attending silly lectures
(one is called "Are You a Blackout Drunk, Or Don't You Remember?") and
participating in the cutest group therapy sessions you've ever seen.
This might be where the Care Bears go for help if they fall off the
wagon.</P>
<P> With the exception of the requisite doomed roommate (Azura
Skye), all of Gwen's fellow addicts are cuddly eccentrics, as warm and
transparent as vodka. The movie trudges through all the usual cliches
(Gwen's mom was a lush who drank herself to death, Gwen's counselor is a
recovering cokehead who feels her pain, Gwen's boyfriend is an enabler
who only loves her when she's plastered, etc.) without offering
bothering to freshen them up.</P>
<P> "If you are young and drink a great deal, it will spoil your
health, slow your mind, make you fat -- in other words, turn you into an
adult," writer P.J. O'Rourke once said. In "28 Days," Bullock does
everything she can to take Gwen to full maturity, but Thomas and Grant
refuse to let her out of the playpen. James Sanford</P>
