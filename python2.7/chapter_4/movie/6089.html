<PRE>                          2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY
                       A film review by Dave Cowen
                        Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>The fact that this film's own promotional materials and private
reviews provide almost constant comparisons to PULP FICTION didn't 
keep me away from 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY is pretty sad: a comparison 
with PULP FICTION is nearly as much a kiss of death these days as 
knowing that a film was not shown to critics for review.  Perhaps 
MGM was trying to recreate the promotion of GET SHORTY, a tepid film 
that through the constant comparison of Elmore Leonard's dialogue 
with Tarantino, along with the presence of the ubiquitous John 
Travolta, made the film a commercial success.  The only link that 
2 DAYS has with Pulp Fiction is that there are small-time gangsters, 
and occasionally those gangsters do funny things.  To that end, I
offer my own comparison: "It's like PULP FICTION with PRATFALLS!"</P>
<P>James Spader plays hit man Lee Woods, a man obsessed with a single
unit of time, and who, with the help of Swedish sex bomb Helga 
Svelgen (Charlize Theron) and small-time thug Dosmo Pizzo
(Danny Aiello) murder the ex-husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher).
Soon after, an unsuccessful writer/director (Paul Mazursky), a 
snobbish art-dealer (Greg Cruttwell), and a homicide-department 
wannabe (Eric Stoltz) fall into the mix.  </P>
<P>What grounds 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY is the mistaken sense of 
sentimentality it presents: director/writer John Herzfield tries
to evoke as much sympathy for these characters in as broad a manner
as possible -- Mazursky's suicidal writer can't bring himself to 
kill himself because of the stares of his lovable dog, Aiello's 
small-time thug also happens to be a great cook, Stoltz's character
doesn't want to bust a massage parlor because of his affection for
one of the massage-girls.  Too many scenes play as being ridiculously
maudlin: the characters are those good-hearted sensitive types who
get things wrong at first but redeem themselves at the end.  You
know the kind of character I'm talking about -- and if you're like 
me, you've never met one in real life.</P>
<P>Not only has this film been compared with PULP FICTION, but also 
Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.  While Short Cuts offers an entirely
unsentimental look at the same community -- offering a glimpse into
the lives of real people and the way they are interconnected and
then cutting off from them without resolution -- 2 DAYS is compelled
like a bad TV movie to wrap everything up neatly in the last 
few frames.  The good guys win, the bad guys lose, everyone gets 
over their neuroses by carrying around guns and dropping their 
hairpieces for two days.</P>
<P>The film isn't entirely irredeemable, however: Greg Cruttwell's 
performance is lifted directly from his performance as the 
overpowering, abusive Jeremy in Mike Leigh's Naked, and his 
over-the-top histrionics are a lot of fun throughout the first
half of the film.  Ultimately, though, the schtick is played for 
too long and his character is dumped violently from the script by 
the end of the movie.  Also suddenly dumped, puzzlingly, is the 
partner to Eric Stoltz's character... who leaves the story in a 
strangely unsympathetic way. </P>
<P>Throughout the film, the Mazursky character talks about his film
"Lights Out", which was supposed to be a drama, but then suddenly
introduced an elephant into the mix for comedy.  The pratfalls in
this film seem equally overwheming: the comedy doesn't blend with
the rest of the film.  Amazingly, the comedy is not the kind of 
smirking Gen-X pop-culture humor we see so much of these days... it's
actually worse!  It's bonafide physical humor lifted from a million
bad films from the 50's, with double-takes, mistaken identities,
crazy animals, and every other old trick in the book.  Some of it 
works: Danny Aiello goes "UHHHH!" and almost shoots a sculpture of a 
dog with the face of Greg Cruttwell's character when entering a room.
Most of the rest of the comedy is, amazingly enough, much more broad
and little of it works at all.  Did I mention Danny Aiello's 
hairpiece keeps falling off?</P>
<P>It's not PULP FICTION, and it's not SHORT CUTS -- and it's nowhere 
near the calibre of those two films.  It's really pretty bad.  I 
wanted to give up long before these 2 DAYS were over.</P>
