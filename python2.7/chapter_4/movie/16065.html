<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>Melbourne's population of Trekkers littered the press screening of
Insurrection for a very good reason: they love their Star Trek.  When a
nervous presenter mispronounced "Jean-Luc Picard," all hell broke loose.
"Go away," screamed one distressed fan. "Piss off!" said another.  The
situation worsened when the presenter read a plot synopsis, only to hear
"don't tell us!" "Boooo!"  This unruly mob spoke the language of all
Trekkers; they didn't care what happened, as long as they got to see the
Enterprise on the big screen as soon as possible.  And that's the way
it's been for years.</P>
<P>For a show that was never popular in its original series, Star Trek has
certainly evolved miraculously.  The first six films involved the
adventures of Captain Kirk and his crew of quirky characters, whereas
films seven to nine have featured the stalwart Picard (Patrick Stewart)
at the helm of the saga.  In Insurrection (the ninth in the series),
Stewart is given the opportunity to act yet again as the rogue hero,
which he does so convincingly.  But this time Stewart is not given as
large a spotlight as he had in 1996's First Contact, for the sake of
developing some of the other main characters.  Director Jonathon Frakes
(who also stars in the film) combines fun elements of character
personalities and action scenes nicely, whilst not exceeding himself in
entertainment or excitement.</P>
<P>Insurrection is similar in tone to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, in
that its characters are placed in environments that are very different
to the ones in which they are accustomed (and believe me, that gag's
milked for everything its got).  For one reason or another, Picard and
his crew come across a strange remote planet belonging to a peaceful
race of people named the Ba'ku's.  This planet possesses a unique
value - it is bathed in radiation that reverses the aging process. That
is why the Son'a's - an aged and dying race - want desperately to get
their hands on Ba'ku territory.   But Picard becomes determined not to
let any harm inflict the Ba'ku's after developing a romantic
relationship with a sprightly native woman (who is over three hundred
years old).  The Enterprise are forced to break Federation rules in
order to protect the Ba'ku, whilst the Son'a's will do anything to
further their existence.</P>
<P>The primary problem of Insurrection lies in its script.  The synopsis
above indicates a simplistic one-way storyboard, but Frakes adds so many
subplots that the film's main focus is often forgotten.  The potential
destruction of a civilization strangely seems less compelling than what
some of our heroes go through, ranging from android Data's (Brent
Spiner) attempts to discover what it feels like to be a child, to Worf's
(Michael Dorn) experience of Klingon puberty.  Most Star Trek films are
very good at underlining the central plot and striving to build a
rewarding climax, but Insurrection has too many distractions along the
way. When the climax does come, it is nowhere near as spectacular as it
should have been.</P>
<P>Special effects are something that Star Trek films can never get enough
of.  Those featured in Insurrection are certainly good, but hardly
represent what the industry is capable of.  Insurrection would have
benefited from whiz-bang, spectacular visuals (achieving the standard of
1998's Lost in Space would have been a good feat), because often the
film feels a little too ordinary and much like something we have seen
before.</P>
<P>Patrick Stewart delivers his usual solid performance as the film's
anchor, and is especially good when he raises his voice - coming across
as a wild and unpredictable authoritarian.  The rest of the cast are a
wacky lot, and everyone seems to be having a lot of fun playing out
their roles, which is the way it should be.  Like most Star Trek films,
the makeup and costume designs are terrific and breathe life into
characters that only Star Trek could think of.</P>
<P>I can understand why some Trekkers would be disappointed by
Insurrection. This is not a traditional Star Trek film in style and
pace; it is more like an extended episode of the series.  Every
character discovers something about themselves, whilst the narrative
slowly moves along with occasional scenes of tense confrontations and
tasteful action (Star Trek has always been careful not to disgust or
irritate viewers).  Frakes has created a solid and generally
entertaining piece, without making Insurrection one of the best films of
the series or even the summer.  The Trekkers get to see the Enterprise
again - and that's probably all that matters.</P>
