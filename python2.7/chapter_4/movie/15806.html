<PRE>You've Got Mail
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>When the perception of America's downtowns became one of fear and
inconvenience, we decided that we'd rather shop in Disneyland. Thus began the
malling of the nation. Although it never happened, the original concept of
shopping malls was that they would become miniature towns.</P>
<P>What they've turned into are sanitized homogenous Everywheres. Walk into any
mall in any city and it doesn't matter where you are, you're in "The Mall".
You can buy the same pair of jeans from the same Gap in the same mall in
nearly every city in the country. The malls are safe and easy shopping but
they're remarkably boring.</P>
<P>Even worse they've resulted in the deaths of uncountable enchanting small
shops. As the managers of the mall stores are packing up the day's money and
shipping it off to the home office thousands of miles away, the owners of the
small shops are staying awake nights trying to figure out how to pay bills.
Eventually they can't.</P>
<P>Now that downtowns are regaining some of their appeal and becoming gentrified,
it's happening there also. Stick a Starbucks on every corner, an Old Navy and
Barnes and Noble down every block and soon we'll have one city multiplied many
times over across the continent.</P>
<P>Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of The Shop Around The Corner, a small
children's bookshop and she's just received terrible news. A Fox Books
Superstore is opening in her neighborhood and she knows that means the end of
the business that her mother started decades ago.</P>
<P>When she runs into Joe Fox (Tom Ryan), the youngest of the Fox Books
patriarchy, at a social gathering, they take an instant dislike to each other.
Joe is the ultimate businessman delighting in running competitors out of
business. ("It's not personal, it's business.")</P>
<P>At their homes they both wait for their lovers to leave each morning before
logging onto AOL to check emails. Booting up her Mac Powerbook  and signing in
as "Shopgirl", Kathleen has lost her cyber-heart to "NY152" whom she met in an
over-30 chatroom. They've never met and don't know each other's actual
identities, but exchange poetic messages across the ethers.</P>
<P>Since this is a movie, NY152 is Joe. In a real chat room Shopgirl would be a
13 year-old girl pretending to be a sex goddess and NY152 would be a German Shepherd.</P>
<P>A remake of the 1940's "The Shop Around The Corner", the film is a return to
light romantic comedies of bygone days. Reuniting Hanks, Ryan and director
Nora Ephron from "Sleepless In Seattle", this proves that you can use the same
actors, virtually the same plot and still produce an enjoyable film.</P>
<P>"Mail" has about a thousand things going for it. It's a feel-good film with
phenomenally likable actors. It's a Christmas release: just the time when
people need a break in their frantic schedule. It's about finding the true
love everyone searches for.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks is the all-American guy. His roles are generally those of highly
principled courageous men. He's easy to trust. He begins this film as a
hard-nosed businessman, but you just know he's going to warm up.</P>
<P>Meg Ryan is the closest thing to being America's sweetheart that the cynical
nineties can allow. Every single thing about her is perky and she brightens up
the screen whenever she's on. For the males in the audience she could probably
carry a film by just showing up.</P>
<P>These two are people that we'd like to have as friends or lovers and
desperately want to cling to the illusion (or reality) that they are the same
people offscreen as they are in the films. We want them in our lives even if
only for two hours. They are what makes the film work although their chemistry
is Love-Lite. There is a spark there, but no fire.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is fairly strong. Greg Kinnear is Frank, Kathleen's
Luddite boyfriend who is passionate about everything except her. Parker Posey,
the queen of independent films, plays Patricia, Joe's live-in. Patricia is a
hyper career woman who as Joe says, "makes coffee nervous." You get the
feeling that both couples lead such busy lives they haven't noticed that they
have fallen out of love. Until the chatroom.</P>
<P>The film is not completely wonderful. It's acceptable that everyone
anticipates the ending in advance, after all this is a romantic comedy. What's
not quite so agreeable is that everything is so damned cute.</P>
<P>Meg Ryan is adorable. We don't have to be reminded of that over and over.
Yeah, she looks good even in flannel PJs, but showing her prance around to a
cartoon music soundtrack is banging us over the head with the obvious. When
the two internet lovers pass on the street without realizing who each other
is, it's amusing. The second and third times add nothing.</P>
<P>Joe makes major changes through the film, but once he discovers who Shopgirl
is, he is still manipulative, always with the upper hand. There is a lack of
honesty in the character that is troubling.</P>
<P>Kathleen's struggling shopkeeper role is compromised by the fact that she has
far too many employees in a small store and towards the end seems able to live
comfortably without the shop's income. Her and Frank's breakup is the stuff of
fantasy, never to occur in the real world. But maybe it's looking too deep to
notice these things. This is a fairy tale. </P>
<P>Some of the film rings true especially for those of us who check email before
that first cigarette or cup of coffee. The comment that closing the shop would
be the "brave thing to do" because it would give her the chance to imagine her
life some other way is an intriguing idea.</P>
<P>Although I enjoy both actors, "Sleepless In Seattle" was not my favorite film,
suffering as it did from the same terminal cuteness. This one is better but it
could have done with some judicious editing. It's not a masterpiece, but it is
nice. I can live with that.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and in the current
spirit of confessing affairs that might result in a conflict of interests, has
to state for the record that he has never had an affair with Meg Ryan -- at
least not in the physical world. Email anonymous musings to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
