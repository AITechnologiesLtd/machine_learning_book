<P>Telling a love story amidst a tragic, historical backdrop isn't a new 
conceit. In 1998, James Cameron's "Titanic" captured the attention of 
audiences everywhere to make it not only the highest-grossing film in 
history, but also the Oscar winner for Best Picture. "Titanic" was clearly 
the most notable model for director Michael Bay (1998's "Armageddon") and 
screenwriter Randall Wallace (1995's "Braveheart") when they set out to make 
the $135-million, 3-hour-plus "Pearl Harbor." Unfortunately, all of its 
striking similarities only serve to expose "Pearl Harbor" for what it really 
is: a pale imitation of a brilliant, modern-day classic.</P>
<P>Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) are top-notch 
bomber pilots, circa 1941, who have been best friends since their 
Tennessee-based childhood. Their life is changed with an encounter with 
beautiful nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is clearly smitten, 
and after a glorious four weeks together, they are hopelessly in love. Soon, 
Rafe is gone to Great Britain to participate in combat, only to end up 
presumed dead after his plane is shot down. Turning to each other for 
comfort, Danny and Evelyn, now stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, begin 
their own romance, not yet knowing that Rafe is alive, after all. By the time 
Rafe walks back into their lives, causing turmoil in each of their respective 
relationships, December 7, 1941--"a date that will live in infamy"--is about 
to begin.</P>
<P>The thought of Michael "bang-bang-blow-things-up" Bay attempting a 
serious-minded, historical motion picture was disconcerting, at first. Bay, 
whose strong suit is most definitely not realism and three-dimensional 
characters, is acclaimed for making "popcorn" movies with quick edits and 
non-stop action, not a historical recreation of one of the most distressing 
occurrences in U.S. history. "Pearl Harbor" could have been a filmed disaster 
of a real-life disaster. It could have been an embarrassment for all of the 
creative forces involved in its production. And, most of all, it could have 
stood as a terrible, Hollywoodized disservice to a slice of American history. 
It turns out that it is, thankfully, none of these things, although it does 
have its own problems.</P>
<P>The movie can easily be divided into three sections, with each offering up 
varying degrees of success. The opening 90 minutes lay out the development 
and basic groundwork for the three central characters--Rafe, Danny, and 
Evelyn--as their unfortunate love triangle falls into place. The disastrous 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor takes up the next 35-40 minutes of screen 
time, as we follow each character's heroic role in the battle. And the 
remaining 50 minutes bring us back to settle the love story, as the aftermath 
of the Pearl Harbor attack is dealt with and General Dolittle (Alec Baldwin) 
puts into effect the 1942 raid on Tokyo.</P>
<P>The tragic, powerful love story of "Titanic" was so very effective because it 
dealt with characters who were deeply involved in the sinking of the cruise 
liner, and whose relationship and lives were changed because of it. Jack and 
Rose, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, stood for all of the 
passengers aboard the fateful maiden voyage of Titanic, and therefore, they 
meant a great deal more to the viewer. In "Pearl Harbor," the love triangle 
that arises does not garner the same potency, due to the flawed screenplay, 
and the fact that the outcome of the relationship has literally nothing to do 
with what happened at Pearl Harbor. The romance simply is not very 
convincing, and occasionally clangs with the real-life accounts of the months 
leading up to World War II.</P>
<P>In the world that writer Randall Wallace inhabits, human beings say things 
like, "Every time I see a sunset, I'll think of you," and "You've captured my 
heart." The dialogue is intermittently so cringe-inducing that you feel bad 
for the actors who have to utter those howlers, followed by a period of time 
in which you question why they didn't laugh at Wallace and tell him to 
rewrite it to match what real people might naturally say. Whenever one of the 
protagonists says such cheeseball lines, which luckily isn't so often that it 
completely destroys the movie's dignity, it sends the whole romance angle 
into jarring orbit.</P>
<P>More strong is the friendship between Rafe and Danny, whose bond ultimately 
can't be broken by the conflict of a woman in the middle. As portrayed by Ben 
Affleck (2000's "Bounce") and Josh Hartnett (2001's "Town & Country"), the 
outcome of their relationship is far more poignant and compelling than that 
of them and Evelyn, because the platonic love that they share for one another 
is so honestly felt. </P>
<P>All three main performers should be commended for taking what could have been 
stock roles, and turning them into seemingly real people, even when they are 
saying silly lines. Affleck's Rafe is a little too smarmy at the onset, but 
the view of him gradually warms up as the film progresses, and Affleck does 
well with his cocky charm. Josh Hartnett is even better as good-ol'-boy 
Danny, whose quiet, unforced innocence is unmistakably engaging. Rounding out 
the trio, Kate Beckinsale (1999's "Brokedown Palace") brings an intelligent 
sweetness to Evelyn that could be superior to both of her male counterparts. 
It is too bad, then, that her part of the story--that of the love 
story--works the least successfully.</P>
<P>In supporting roles, James King (2001's "Blow") and William Lee Scott (2000's 
"Gone in Sixty Seconds") are very good as a fellow nurse and fighter who fall 
head over heels for one another, with ill-fated results. Jon Voight (1999's 
"Varsity Blues") is emphatic as wheelchair-bound President Franklin 
Roosevelt, while Alec Baldwin (2000's "State and Main"), Dan Aykroyd (2000's 
"Loser"), and Mako (1997's "Seven Years in Tibet") make equally memorable 
impressions. On the flip side, Cuba Gooding Jr. (2000's "Men of Honor"), 
whose role of a real-life cook on one of the U.S. ships at Pearl Harbor who 
shot down two Japanese fighter jets, is superfluous and far too brief to make 
a notable impact. Gooding Jr. is a fine actor, but his appearance simply pads 
out the running time an extra ten minutes.</P>
<P>The centerpiece of "Pearl Harbor" is, of course, the Japanese invasion, and 
it does not disappoint. Suspenseful and frighteningly real, this is the one 
section in which director Bay made the correct choice in not hamming the 
proceedings up. With stark photography, tight editing, and magnificently 
rendered visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic, this middle interlude is 
certainly the highlight for sheer entertainment value. Incidentally, though, 
it is the only section in need of more palpable emotions. Ships are blown up 
and countless lives are lost, but viewer reaction to this is oddly mote, 
perhaps because of how fast it moves from one scene to the next.</P>
<P>"Pearl Harbor" is a difficult movie to review. It is in no way a great movie, 
but it also is far from bad. There is a lot to recommend, from the 
performances, to the two war sequences, to a climactic scene that is simply 
heartbreaking, but there are also a fair share of detractors. The film 
presses on for just over three hours with no clear destination or purpose, 
and the supposed-to-be cathartic final scenes are hampered by a needless, 
misguided narration that seems to cheapen the realities of World War II. 
Nonetheless, the calamitous events that occurred on December 7, 1941 are 
boldly brought to cinematic life, and it demands to be seen. "Titanic," it 
surely is not, but "Pearl Harbor" has enough finer points to pass as a good 
film that could have been better.</P>
