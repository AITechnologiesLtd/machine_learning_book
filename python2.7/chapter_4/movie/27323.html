<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira takes a sarcastic look at two
couples who are international jet-setters, he does this while examining
an obsessive flirtation between an aging Lothario and a beautiful, much
younger, married woman.</P>
<P>On St. Miguel island of the Azores, the wealthy Rogério and Leonor
celebrate their ten years of marriage with a garden party in their
splendid villa. They invite a large group of people over, most are
strangers to Rogério as they were invited by his wife. The hosts choose
to sit with Michel and Irene. Michel's a witty, impertinent seducer of
women, who thrives on his wicked reputation, while she's an aging Greek
actress, once famous for playing Electra, who is now Michel's lover.</P>
<P>An unlikely attraction occurs between the very tall and attractive
twentysomething
Leonor and the short, portly, much older middle-aged Michel, which
prompts them to get away from the others and head for a view of the sea
on the mountainous rocks that is out of sight from the party. Here,
Michel tells her of the maddening love he has for her. She is enthralled
by his love, but all we are able to determine, is that they talk about
it and don't act on it. Meanwhile, at the party, Irene and Rogério
chatter away, confessing what love means to them, which all sounded
rather superficial and theatrical. When Michel returns with Leonor, the
jealous husband tells Michel to leave his house, just as a strong wind
ends the outdoor party.</P>
<P>Five years later, upon Leonor's insistence, they get together for a
dinner in the museum-like house of Rogério. The couple are shown to be
avid collectors who like to pretend they care about culture but really
have these objects only to impress others. Bon mots fly off all their
lips, as they converse about the differences between men and women, what
is happiness, and offer their opinion about anything under the sun. It
is raining hard and Irene calls the rain insiduous, as Michel openly
says he loves Leonor and she tells him she thought about him every day
for the last five years. They disappear from the room, leaving Rogério
and Irene time to chat, with him expressing disillusionment with his
wife for ridiculing him in this way, while Irene says, "Only in despair
do I find happiness." She explains the absurdity of the world by saying,
"The world belongs to lunatics like Hitler and Mussolini -- there're the
ones who are most noticeable."</P>
<P>There's a surprise ending, which nicely resolves this little love
conundrum. The clues to the outcome are hinted at from a quote Rogério
made earlier on, when talking about his wife to Irene, "There's
virginity in the enigma of life." The film appeals to the intellect to
answer its questions about love, but fails to be appealing emotionally.
It was just too chatty and the characters always seemed to be symbols,
too unapproachable to be considered as real people. But I'm a big fan of
Michel Piccoli and Irene Papas, and I found their performances to be
very stimulating--which is reason enough to see this art house film.</P>
