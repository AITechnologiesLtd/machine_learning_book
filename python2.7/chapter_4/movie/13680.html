<P>   One basketball player gets $20 million a year for promoting
a company that makes sneakers.  In some countries, you're
as likely as not to be killed in the stands over plays on the
soccer field.  Baseball players vie with one another for
lucrative movie contracts, and many a marriage has dissolved
over absentee husbands who sit glued to the tube every
Sunday watching pigskin spectacles.  Yet at one time, so they
say, people enjoyed just going out into the field and lobbing
the horsehide around and frolicking about wearing a pair of
Keds.  Today most of us prefer to go to Wrigley Field or
Giants Stadium and, if we're into jogging, it's as much to show
off our $200 footwear as to trim down and stay in shape. 
"BASEketball," which bills itself as a sendup of organized
sports--particularly its gross commercialization--fights fire with
fire in out-vulgarizing its target.  A laugh-out-loud movie with
more hits than misses, "BASEketball" is obviously the work of
David Zucker, whose popular "South Park" TV show keeps
people glued to their sets whenever there's no sign of a game
to watch.</P>
<P>   The nonstop action begins when when Joe Cooper (Trey
Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) invent a new game,
one which can be played even by people with bad backs and
shoddy knees, putting them on an equal plane with the most
tanned and fit athlete.  Dubbing the action "BASEketball," the
sport uses a white horsehide about the size of a basketball,
but you don't have to run back and forth down the court like a
nut. You simply take a shot and, depending on where you
discharge the orb, you get a single, double, triple or home
run.  Nor do you have to "cover" your opponent on guard
duty.  Your task in defense is more challenging: you must
psych the guy out by doing something so offensive or saying
something so distasteful that the shooter is too distracted to
get off a good throw.  The opportunities for both verbal and
physical humor are obvious and David Zucker, who wrote and
directed this ribald film, keeps the action going without letup,
parading frenetic activity in both foreground and horizon.</P>
<P>   The three stooges, "Coop," Reemer, and a diminutive guy
named Squeak Scolari (Dian Bachar), evoke laughter even if
they do nothing but stand and look at the audience as if
singing a chorus of "duh."  As Joe Cooper, Trey Parker sports
an obvious blond rug over his dark hair, Matt Stone a pair of
disgustingly fashionable spectacles under his Afro, while Dian
Bachar gets the chuckles just by being himself.  The crowning
event of the picture is the world series-like competition for the
Denslow Cup. Though the sport had begun innocently in an
impromptu backyard basketketball court, it had grown by
leaps and bounds after its initial commercialization by
financier Ted Denslow (Ernest Borgnine)--so much that
promoter Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn) stands to gain big
bucks if the hero's team loses.  </P>
<P>   The romantic interest is sparked by a clean-cut beauty,
Jenna Reed (Yasmine Bleeth), who runs a charitable
foundation for kids with incurable diseases.  Trey Parker's
interest in the striking young woman sets the scene for some
productive, politically incorrect verbal humor.  When Joey
(Trevor Einhron), a lad about to undergo a crucial liver
transplant which he is not expected to weather, is asked for a
Big Wish, he fancies himself as a game hunter targeting
endangered species like pandas.  That dream rejected, he
asks for a go at Chelsea Clinton.  "That's a tall order,"
responds Coop dryly. "You'd have a better chance at Bill." 
When Coop asks whether the kids are "sick and dying,"
Jenna corrects him: "They're health-challenged and survival-
impaired."  After Coop and Remer take the kid out on the
town for a night of heavy drinking before the operation, Joey
lies on the hospital gurney, prompting the nurse to complain,
"He's eight years old and he smells like Robert Downey Jr."</P>
<P>   The jokes do not depend exclusively on sports and, in fact,
some of the funniest scenes occur early on.  In one situation,
Coop and Remer crash a party given by the ice-cold Brittany
(Cory Oliver) and, taking a drink from the house bidet,
smelling the undies in an upstairs room and testing a vibrator,
they find out that they're in Brittany's mother's room.</P>
<P>   The sports personality most bitingly satirized albeit without
mentioning his name is Michael Jordan, whose promotion of
Nike sneakers earns him an annual income greater than that
of the entire 30,000-strong force of largely underage
assemblers in Indonesia.  Flying to Calcutta, Coop discovers
a factory filled with eight-year-olds making the product and
wins Jenna's heart by effecting drastic reforms in the
workplace.</P>
<P>   Despite what you may have heard, "BASEketball" is not as
crude as such paradigms of coarseness as "Mall Rats,"
"Trainspotting," and even "Mafia!"  It's filled with solid comic
performances, equally effective as both physical and verbal
buffoonery.  </P>
