<PRE>DETROIT ROCK CITY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>How much luckier could 4 stoner types and would-be rock stars get in
1978 than being the proud owners of 4 tickets to the KISS concert in
nearby Detroit?  Not much, if they still had the tickets.</P>
<P>In Adam Rifkin's high energy farce, DETROIT ROCK CITY, 4 high-school
students -- Hawk (Edward Furlong), Jam (Sam Huntington), Lex (Giuseppe
Andrews) and Trip (James DeBello) -- share an undying love for their
favorite rock band, KISS.</P>
<P>Jam's mother (Lin Shaye), who takes bullhorns to rally crowds against
"Knights In Satan's Service," is a devout Catholic and is against the
band that she's sure is from Hell.  The chain-smoking mom uses the 4
tickets to light one of her cigarettes and then takes Jam off to
boarding school -- don't worry, his friends will bust him out -- to
shield him from the evils of the world, like KISS.</P>
<P>The story, full of sophomoric hijinks, has the kids off to Detroit once
they win 4 more tickets in a radio station call-in.  Needless to say,
all will not go as planned.</P>
<P>Along the way on the road to Detroit, they rumble with 4 disco-lovers.
In a fan war between KISS and disco aficionados, which side would you
bet on?</P>
<P>Later they encounter one of the disco girls, Christine, walking alone
along the highway. Christine is played with a sassy savoir-faire by
Natasha Lyonne from THE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS.  In six-inch heels, a
tiny skirt and enough make-up for a small circus, she's not someone
you'd miss noticing, especially if you were a teenage boy with raging
hormones.  In the funniest section of dialog in the movie, upon seeing
Christine alone, one of the lads observes, "They make horror movies that
start like this."  With a big grin, another remarks, "And porno movies
that start like this too."  Soon, they have the girl firmly ensconced in
the back seat of their car, which floats along the road with pot smoke
flowing out of it like a house on fire.</P>
<P>Once they get to Detroit, they're forced to find tickets yet again.
This time they're desperate.  Each devises his own scheme to come up
with the money to buy scalper tickets.  Typical is a plan to dance at a
strip-bar in front of a bunch of crude, tongue-wagging women of all
ages.</P>
<P>Many of the film's best lines are unprintable snippets of bathroom and
sexual humor.  The movie isn't exactly high comedy, but it does have
just enough laughs to recommend it.  Not surprisingly, the movie is
filled with a heavy, pervasive sound track.  The groups range from KISS
to Tchaikovsky.  Yes, that Tchaikovsky.  Now, that's a surprise.</P>
<P>DETROIT ROCK CITY runs 1:34.  It is rated R for strong language, drug
use and sex-related content and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
