<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going. It is set in the dank
countryside of New Zealand, amid bubbling and unpredictable mud springs,
tacky bars, and morbid hospital rooms. The murky tale, director Alison
Maclean's debut feature-length film, is about a journalist, Christina
(Donogh Rees), traveling with her American female lover to interview a
once-famous author, Colin (Zappa), living in an isolated fishing town.
He had once written a book of the year novel. The women car crash while
speeding around a bend and the literary critic has severe head injuries,
causing her to remain in the hospital in a coma. Her companion, Lane
(Marcia Gay Harden), the driver of the car walks away from the accident
unharmed and decides to visit the author the next day, after she first
peruses his book and steals her friend's notes on the author.</P>
<P>She meets the author's serious-minded 15-year-old daughter Angela
(Bossley) and takes her to a slinky bar after loaning her a hot dress.
Lane is a wild spirit, causing a commotion in the author's quiet
household by getting the timid author to go to bed with her and become
obsessed with her lovemaking ability. The kid soon turns against Lane
seeing her as a lying, hypocritical bitch, someone who shows no concern
for her friend, never even visiting her.</P>
<P>Lane pushes herself onto the author, now working at a fishing job, and
becomes his houseguest, against the cries of Angela. She recklessly
plays games with all the people she meets, looking down upon their
mundane lifestyles and dangerously plays with their emotions. She's a
vulnerable monster, who plays heartless with others to hide her own
insecurities. Meanwhile, Angela becomes obsessed with Christina and
visits her daily in the hospital, giving her spiritual sustenance and
getting her to start to talk in a limited way. She has been feeding
Christina poison about Lane and is trying to get the victim back on her
feet to confront her friend. But Christina shows signs of being mentally
unbalanced. In the hospital she takes pleasure in inflicting hurt onto
others.</P>
<P>The climax comes as Christina in a wheelchair becomes a houseguest at
the author's through the daughter's insisrence, and the story gets
played out as a bisexual revenge thriller; but, it never seems to be
totally convincing. It's always too enigmatic and bleak, and its
surprise ending falls like a dead weight into a waterfalls.</P>
<P>Marcia Gay Harden mops up the screen with her amoral and seductive
performance, while Donogh Rees shines in carrying out her malevolent
hidden agenda. It's a film that successfully and darkly explores the
motives of its three female characters and their ambiguous relationships
with others.</P>
