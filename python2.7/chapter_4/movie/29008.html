<PRE>"Ghost World"</PRE>
<P>Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) are two malcontented
teenage girls on the brink of graduation from high school and the very
threshold of adulthood. Outsiders to their parents and peers, the girls
carry on an almost non-stop caustic commentary that spares no one. When
Enid points her poisoned wit in the direction of a hapless, alienated
grouch, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), she realizes the he is much like her and
an unusual friendship develops in "Ghost World."</P>
<P>Director Terry Zwigoff hit the big-time with his much-awarded 1995
documentary, "Crumb," about the life and family of cartoonist Robert Crumb
(of "Keep On Truckin'" fame). Zwigoff, a close friend to the artist,
created an evocative, sympathetic look into a truly bizarre genius. With
"Ghost World," he joins with Daniel Clowes as they adapt the graphic
novelist's comic book creation for the big screen. The story begins with
Enid and Rebecca as a pair of intellectual sophisticates who know they are
too cool and smart for words. Their outsider status gives them the right,
they think, to whatever they damn well please for their own amusement.</P>
<P>One day, while going through the personals, Enid stumbles upon a plaintive
ad by a lonely guy looking for a woman in a yellow dress that he,
literally, bumped into at the airport weeks before. The girls decide to
have some fun and call the guy, pretending to be "the woman," and leave a
message setting up a meet. As they watch, from a distance, the poor schmuck
sit and wait - for nothing - at a local diner, Enid has the first stirrings
that, maybe, this wasn't such a funny idea. She begins a personal campaign
to get to know the man, Seymour, who, oddly, holds much in common with the
troubled teen.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Rebecca has graduated high school (Enid has to go to summer
school to finish her art class), secured a job and is saving for an
apartment that she and Enid have always talked of sharing. Becky is sorting
out her plans for the future while her friend rejects, outright, any notion
of conventionality. The two begin a parting of the ways as Enid grows
closer to Seymour, especially when her sad sack father (Bob Balaban) makes
noises about getting back together with his ex-wife, Maxine (Teri Garr),
whom the teenager can't stand. Enid makes it her goal to help Seymour find
the lady in the yellow dress, but this decision, and the separation from
Rebecca, leaves her to confront her coming of age alone.</P>
<P>Zwigoff performs the leap from documentary to feature films in a seamless
manner that makes "Ghost World" not seem like a freshman fiction flick.
There is some initial comparison to another teen angst film, "Heathers"
(1989), but where the older film, especially the violence, was fantasy
based, the comic book-inspired tale is firmly rooted in teen reality. Enid
and Becky aren't out to kill the popular people here, but are not beyond
using a sharp tongue to cut down "normal" people. The girls are not unique
in their views. Even I remember, as a teenager, knowing 10 times more than
any adult, holding the older folk in a benign, superior contempt. Enid,
especially, puts forth this teen philosophy when you don't quite fit in -
when in doubt, attack.</P>
<P>Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are co-billed in "Ghost World," but the
veteran Birch takes over early on and is the real star of the film. The
young actress has over a decade of experience under her belt, starting, at
age six in "The Purple People Eater" and made the leap to more adult roles
with her work in the Oscar-winning "American Beauty." As Enid, she's a
little over-weight and cloaks herself in Gothic-inspired costumes that
ensure that she hides her inherent prettiness. As she singles out Seymour
for her own brand of amusement, she begins to make the first, unconscious,
moves to maturity. Birch is solid in the role and puts a firm imprint on
the complexity and sometimes confusion that make up Enid.</P>
<P>In a brilliant bit of casting, Steve Buscemi is nothing less than terrific
as Seymour. The actor has a talent for playing the hapless misfit and can
be counted on to put a unique spin on each character. Seymour may be a
loser but, with his love for old jazz music and dedication to his old
78-rpm record collection, he has something that he believes in. Enid sees
that his geek world may not be much to look at, but it is his own. The
relationship and physical attraction that bond Enid and Seymour is frank,
believable and, sometimes, touching. Buscemi should get attention at year's
end for this gem of a performance.</P>
<P>Scarlett Johansson ("The Horse Whispered") starts off strong but, as
Rebecca starts to find herself, she sets what are, to Enid, conventional
goals and aspirations. As Becky gets "normal" she grows more and more
distant from her friend, eventually fading from the picture, both in screen
time and with her character's importance to the story. Johansson does a
solid job in the diminished role. The veteran actors that help to flesh out
the background are an odd, not always successful, mix. Illeana Douglas
gives a dead on perf as Enid's summer school art teacher, Roberta. The
woman is in a  position to help her wards, but is so inured in her own
vision of art that she is unable to recognize the talent behind Enid's
caricature drawings. Bob Balaban plays Enid's dad as a clueless dolt who
doesn't understand anything about his daughter. Teri Garr's cameo
appearance as Enid's soon-to-be-again stepmom does nothing for the film.
Brad Renfro, as the girls' friend, object of desire and target for teen
torment, gets little air time and less to do.</P>
<P>Techs are sharp, especially the outfitting of Thora Birch by Mary Zophres
("Fargo"). The music, especially, has a place as a character in "Ghost
World." Vintage jazz and blues tunes abound with particular attention paid
to the 1931 Skip James song, "Devil Got My Woman." Of course, contemporary
music is amply supplied, but the blues rules. Artwork, especially Seymour's
Cook's Chicken scrapbook and Enid's portfolio of drawing, are a nice
addition by Sophie Crumb, daughter of Robert.</P>
<P>"Ghost World" is a true teen movie, not just for girls. The angst,
confusion and growing pains depicted are not aimed at one sex or the other
and has a lot to say for both. I give it a B.</P>
