<P>     Earlier this half of the century in Sydney, Australia, there was an 
eccentric street person named Bea Miles who regaled passersby with 
rousing renditions of Shakespearean monologues.  Over the years, Miles 
became something of a local legend and cult figure, and the 
contributions she received for her "performances" allowed her to eke out 
a meager existence.  In 1984, author Kate Grenville published a book 
called LILIAN'S STORY, which told a fictionalized account of Miles' 
life.  Although the names and details had been changed, much of what 
made Miles special remained.  Now, a dozen years later, that book has 
been transformed into a motion picture, featuring several well-known 
Australian actors.</P>
<P>     Consider it SHINE 2, if you want, although it was developed at the 
same time (not after) its higher-profile counterpart.  Those who 
appreciated Scott Hicks' Oscar-nominated chronicle of David Helfgott's 
life will certainly find something to like about LILIAN'S STORY.  If you 
were among SHINE's detractors, however, you would do best to stay away 
from this movie.  Although it contains many of the same themes, ideas, 
and narrative points, it isn't as well-acted, well-directed, or well-
written.  LILIAN'S STORY is a competent, occasionally-moving tale, but 
it's not on SHINE's level.</P>
<P>     LILIAN'S STORY opens in modern-day Sydney, where sixty year old 
Lilian Singer (Australian stage luminary Ruth Cracknell) is being 
released from an asylum after a forty year stay.  She returns to the 
house inhabited by her brother and father (both played by Barry Otto), 
but is unable to stay in a place that holds such horrible memories.  
Through flashbacks, we see glimpses of how she became the person that 
she is -- the abuse, both physical and psychological, that she suffered 
as a young woman (Toni Collette) at the hands of her father.  Lilian 
decides to live on the street, reciting Shakespeare on corners for 
handouts.  Eventually, she meets up with an old friend (John Flaus), who 
was once the love of her life.  Now a burned-out, homeless drunk, he 
invites Lilian to share his meager shelter for as long as she wants to 
stay with him.</P>
<P>     Recently, I've seen a number of Australian exports dealing with 
mental illness -- LILIAN'S STORY makes it four in less than six months 
(in addition to the aforementioned SHINE, the others are ANGEL BABY and 
COSI).  This is not the best, nor is it the worst, but it lacks the 
freshness and urgency associated with SHINE and ANGEL BABY.  The point-
of-view is somewhat different -- director Jerzy Domaradzki, Polish born 
and schooled, views this story from an outsider's perspective, which 
places a little distance between the audience and the subject.  His 
cinematographer is former Kieslowski collaborator Slavomir Idziak 
(hence, the amber filters during the flashback sequences).  </P>
<P>     While LILIAN'S STORY is competently acted, every performer is a 
notch below their counterpart in SHINE.  Ruth Cracknell is wonderful, 
but she's not quite on the same level as Geoffrey Rush.  Toni Collette's 
bold performance is a shade less dynamic than Noah Taylor's.  And Barry 
Otto's controlling father falls short of Armin Mueller-Stahl's similar 
part.  What's more, LILIAN'S STORY doesn't envelop the viewer in the 
same way that SHINE did.  We never become as intimately connected with 
Lilian as we did with Helfgott.  There's an intensity missing here that 
SHINE possessed.  </P>
<P>     That said, however, LILIAN'S STORY is still a fine motion picture, 
and it has the guts and determination to visit unpleasant subjects that 
many movies still regard as taboo.  LILIAN'S STORY tells of an 
unorthodox triumph over adversity, but there are no bells and whistles 
indicating "feel good ending" at the conclusion -- it's a little more 
subtle than that.  Two comments made by Lilian sum up the movie.  The 
first, "At least [my life] wasn't mediocre," illustrates Lilian's 
character and determination.  The second, "Any tale is real if told well 
enough," is a fair statement to make about this motion picture.</P>
