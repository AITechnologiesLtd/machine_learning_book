<PRE>Music From Another Room</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Charlie Peters.</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jude Law, Gretchen Mol, Brenda Blethyn, Jennifer Tilly.</P>
<P>Once you've seen the first ten minutes of this movie (or even the
preview), you know exactly what's going to happen. This seems
to be the curse of the romantic-comedy. Of course, this doesn't
always have to be a bad thing - sometimes getting to a known
end can be heaps of fun - but a movie has to work a lot harder to
overcome this. </P>
<P>First, if I know that Danny (Jude Law) and Anna (Gretchen Mol)
are going to end up happily ever after from the get-go, why will I
keep watching? Since it's at the very beginning, we're not at a
point yet where I really care about these characters. The only
possibility is that the journey is going to be novel in some way,
filled with interesting characters and strange events. </P>
<P>Charlie Peters seems to have understood this point and filled
Music From Another Room with a cast of zany characters who
have eccentric hobbies/careers. Danny is a restorer of mosaics,
Anna's sister-in-law regularly draws a gun on the family at the
dinner table, Anna's father continually talks about the mating
habits of different animals, the wisdom dispensing Austrian
family that takes Danny in, the people at the night club, Anna's
mother with her magically reappearing and disappearing disease
- the film is filled with a plethora of quaint or just plain strange
characters. </P>
<P>Unfortunately turning a room full of odd beings into an
interesting, amusing movie rather than into a room full of
lunatics is a fine line to tread and the director seems to be
wearing Doc Martens. To take just one point, what is the story
with the sister-in-law and the gun? Her gun wielding antics
start out mildly amusing but quickly become psychopathic: and
there's not much humour in that. </P>
<P>Music From Another Room isn't a bad movie. In fact, there are
quite a few amusing moments and almost all of the
performances are good enough. It's just another predictable
romantic comedy with not much to recommend it, especially not
it's "I'm-so-hip" self-referential dialogue. Throughout the movie,
people make references to the fact that things are happening just
as if they were in a movie such as when Anna talks about the
typical romantic comedy where the interesting foreigner comes to
enlighten the up-tight female lead. Being a predictable, cliched
movie is bad enough but admitting it doesn't make it any better! </P>
<P>Some sort of change of direction would have made this a more
interesting movie: perhaps have Danny, in trying to woo Anna,
fall in love with Nina (Jennifer Tilly) or have Anna realise that she
has been up-tight till now but now she needs to go off to
experience life, not settle down with Danny. Something, anything
to get Music From Another Room out of the predictability rut. </P>
<P>Pleasant storyline, amusing moments, attractive people: clearly a
fine choice as a rainy afternoon video. Just be warned that you'll
have the song Truly, Madly, Deeply by Savage Garden on your
brain for the rest of the day. </P>
