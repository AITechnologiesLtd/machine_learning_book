<P>"Arlington Road" is an interesting thriller that lost its core
audience because of poor marketing. The film was supposed to have been
released in April after a teaser trailer would tell little but promise
a lot. However, this was not the case. The film's trailer gave away
many secret plot twists and basically told the entire story. Then, the
film's release date got pushed back to July 9th when the filmmakers
decided that they didnt want the touchy subject matter to coincide
with the aftermath of the recent school shootings.</P>
<P>That being said, "Arlington Road" is a movie starring Jeff Bridges as
Michael Faraday, a terrorism expert whose wife was killed in a
Waco-like shootout. He meets his new neighbors, Oliver(Tim Robbins)
and Cheryl(Joan Cusack) Lang, when he rescues their son after he is
wounded while using fireworks. Michael and his girlfriend, Brooke(Hope
Davis), befriend their neighbors while their kids bond
together. However, Michael starts to notice some very disturbing
things about the man next door. Is he just imagining these
things(because of his terrorism-laced mind) or are they real? I will
not give away any more, because hopefully you haven't seen the film's
trailer and might be surprised.</P>
<P>Director Mark Pellington made the romantic-comedy "Going All The Way"
a couple years ago, and "Arlington Road" has an entirely different
filmmaking style. Despite a few formulaic plot contrivances,
"Arlington Road" is a cut above most suspense flicks. Jeff Bridges is
at his Lebowski-best, while Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are absolutely
haunting as the neighbors from hell.  The ending of the film is
devastating and very disturbing, as conventionality takes a backseat
to the sad, slightly warped version of the truth.</P>
