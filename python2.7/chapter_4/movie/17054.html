<PRE>Freeway
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Kiefer Sutherland; Reese Witherspoon & Bokeem Woodbine
I used to think that The Conversation was the worse film I had ever seen.
Freeway is giving me second thoughts. Freeway is a modern retelling of
Little Red Riding Hood. Only in the nineties, Little Red Riding Hood is a
foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by Reese Witherspoon, and the Big
Bad Wolf is a serial killer (Keifer Sutherland). To top that pathetic
premise off -- Reese goes to visit Granny and you'll never guess who's
waiting under the cover's in Granny's bed.</P>
<P>Keifer Sutherland is one of Hollywoods most talented, yet underrated
actors, and Reese Witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely
become a major star. So what are they doing in this movie? After seeing the
end result, undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question.
You might be asking yourself why this is such a short review. The answer is
quite simple -- I dont want to waste any more of my time writing or
thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary. I wasted enough of my
time just sitting through it.</P>
<P>Note to Keifer: You wonder why you aren't a bigger star in Hollywood?
Because you keep making movies like this. Note to Reese: You were great in
Fear, what happened this time? Note to both: Don't worry about it too much,
no one saw this movie anyway.</P>
<P>Bottom line -- I'm still shaking my head. Don't waste your time on this
turkey. If you want to see a great Keifer Sutherland movie, go rent
Flatliners or Young Guns. Reese Witherspoon's abundant acting talents are
used to their full potential in Fear, a great thriller. Do yourself a favor
and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from Freeway as you
possibly can.</P>
<PRE>0/10 -- If this isnt the worst movie ever made, it comes in an extremely
close
second.</PRE>
