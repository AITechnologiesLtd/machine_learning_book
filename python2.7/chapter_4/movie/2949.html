<P>     If I were in a kind mood, I might say that THE SPECIALIST attempts
to be an atmospheric, dramatic thriller.  On the other hand, if I
wanted to be truthful, I could note that this film has two obvious
assets (both of which are used to maximum advantage): Sylvester
Stallone's biceps and Sharon Stone's breasts.  Everything else,
ultimately, is superfluous, as becomes apparent the moment you actually
start to think about the story line.</P>
<P>     Stallone is Ray Quick, an ex-CIA explosives specialist.  Stone is
May Munro, a woman bent on avenging the deaths of her parents.  When
she was a girl, she saw them murdered, and her whole reason for living
has been to kill Tomas Leon (Eric Roberts) and his two cohorts in
crime.  To do this, she has recruited Ray.  They talk on the phone and
communicate by e-mail, but they never meet.</P>
<P>     May, however, is not entirely on the level.  She has made a deal
with an old enemy of Ray's, Ned Trent (James Woods).  Ned's motives are
a little foggy, but it's clear that he wants to do something unpleasant
to Ray, and he wields enough clout to get almost the entire Miami
police force behind him in his search for the elusive specialist.</P>
<P>     This movie is excruciatingly dumb.  And, given the releases of
SPEED and BLOWN AWAY this summer, there's no dearth of explosion-based
motion pictures.  The only twist this one offers is that here, the
bomber is the good guy (and he only blows up bad people--Ray has a
creed about never catching an innocent bystander in a blast).</P>
<P>     The atmosphere of THE SPECIALIST is peculiar.  It's almost gothic
in nature, with dark settings, dim lighting, and a grandiose John Barry
score (which might have been impressive somewhere else).  The
cinematographer clearly has a sense of style far in excess of what's
warranted for this movie.  Several scenes take place in misty
surroundings, and the overall mood is relentlessly grim.  No one
appears to be having fun, least of all the actors.  All of them, that
is, except James Woods.</P>
<P>     To say that Woods goes over-the-top would be to vastly understate
what he accomplishes in this "performance."  His acting is as far
overboard as the director allows, and that's quite a distance.  This
sort of manic display is actually entertaining to watch, primarily
because everything else offered by THE SPECIALIST is so bland and
dreary.</P>
<P>     It's always a bad sign when the most impressive feature of a
motion picture is its visual effects.  In this case, the memorable
moments (if you ignore a scene where Woods literally foams at the
mouth) occur when buildings blow up.  Unfortunately, they don't take up
much screen time, and to get from one to another, you have to endure
the so-called plot that moves events along.  No amount of pyrotechnics,
bare flesh, and flexing muscles is worth that price.</P>
