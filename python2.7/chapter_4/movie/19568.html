South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</PRE>
<PRE>A Review</PRE>
<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Trey Parker
Starring: (voices of) Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, Isaac
Hayes</PRE>
<P>     This movie was doomed, or assisted by, depending on how you
look at it, to be a political hot potato.  Its release followed closely
the Columbine shooting, and the alleged "crackdown" on childrens' access
to R-rated movies by the Cinema industry.  Ironically, Parker and Stone
claim that the MPAA was more concerned about profanity than violence.
Another humorous aside was a quote I heard from a parents' rights group
that yearned for the "innocent" satire of Beavis and Butthead.  </P>
<P>     The basic plot of the film involves our heroes, Kenny, Kyle, Cartman,
and Stan sneaking into the R-rated film starring Canadian TV stars
Terrance and Phillip, and emerging with a whole new vocabulary of
extremely profane phrases that they of course think are cool.  This comes
after the opening musical number that waxes poetic on the virtues of the
small, quiet, virtuous, little mountain town.  Their parents and teachers
are shocked by their language and Kyle's mom, who is known for getting
into just about every cause possible, starts a snowball of anti-Canadian
sentiment that ends with Terrance and Phillips arrested and sentenced to 
death and the U.S. declaring war on Canada.   The children also discover
that Satan and his boytoy, Saddam Hussein will unleash the apocalypse if
the blood of Terrance and Phillip is spilled.  It's up to the boys to
prevent the end of the world and save Terrance and Phillip from the
anti-Canada crusade spearheaded by Kyle's mom.</P>
<P>     I'll wager that the primary draw of South Park for most fans is
merely the toilet humor, and yes, this film has a *lot* of toilet humor.
The profanity is frequent and un-bleeped, unlike the television series.
There is just about every kind of offensive phrase and image that you can
pack into a film, however for some reason they didn't really directly
insult any religious groups, which was a slight surprise to me.
Underneath all of this nastiness, however, is a very good message, one
that I wish was more of a part of all of the Columbine fallout: That
parents need to parent their children.  Rather than be outraged that such
a film was produced, they need to tell their kids, hey, this is wrong.
The parents in this film see nothing wrong with starting a war, but never
actually talk to their kids about why they shouldn't have seen the R rated
film in the first place.</P>
<P>     The script does peter out a bit in the 2nd half.  The first half had
me laughing repeatedly and uncontrollably.  The jokes have three levels.
There's the 1st level that most people probably expect from south park,
and that is the toilet humor.  Secondly, there's a gift of parody that
Parker and Stone possess that references a number of other films and
aspects of pop culture.  Third, there is the overall irony of people
thinking that violence is less harmful to children than nasty language.
The 2nd half, in my opinion, had too much Saddam Hussein.  I think it's
funny the way they portray him, but his antics got old very quickly.  The
thing I liked most about this film were the musical numbers.  The music
and lyrics were written mostly by Trey Parker and he truly has a gift for
lyrical humor, and the music was top-notch.  I believe that Trey Parker
has the juice to actually write a sucessful musical-comedy on Broadway if
he wished.  </P>
<P>     Overall the film is extremely funny, creative, and has a better moral
message than most so-called serious films and television programs.  I also
think that the film had a better message that anything spewed forth by
politicians on both sides of the aisle.  It is not meant for children, and
I would hope that very few parents allow their children to see it.  Stone
and Parker themselves have said that it's intended by adults, and it's up
to parents to keep their children from watching it if they don't approve.
Just as it was with Beavis and Butthead, people have knee-jerk reactions
and are incapable of looking past the 1st level humor and appreciate grand
satire.  </P>
<P>Of the $4.75 I paid for the film, it was worth $8.00</P>
