<P>     Sure as the turning of the leaves, this time of the year, fresh
with the scent of Oscars to come, brings the release of a new Woody
Allen motion picture.  Two years ago, his fall contribution was
HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  Last year, it was MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.  This
year, the entry is something called BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, which
represents Allen's first stint behind the camera without going in front
of it since 1990 (ALICE).</P>
<P>     It's odd how the director's personal life manages to intrude
itself into his films.  Throughout his career, this has been the case,
and circumstances haven't changed with BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.  The
greatest evidence for this comes in a theme that could have been taken
right out of Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: what, if any, ethical
constraints bind the conduct and conscience of a true artist?  Or, to
use Allen's own words:  does a man possessed of true artistic genius
create "his own moral universe"?</P>
<P>     BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is the most insightful and deliciously droll
look at show business since Robert Altman skewered Hollywood in 1992's
THE PLAYER.  Covering much the same ground as NAKED IN NEW YORK, albeit
in a different era (the 1920s) and with much greater success, BULLETS
OVER BROADWAY questions what real art is.  Just because a play is
compromised, does that make it a less valid expression of ideas?  And
is it possible to get anything made without giving in on some element
of artistic integrity?  Allen toys with those issues, taking playful
jabs at his audience, himself, and the entertainment industry as a
whole.</P>
<P>     David Shayne (John Cusack as Allen's alter-ego) is a playwright
with a brilliant script that no one wants to produce.  Since it's
"art", the belief is that it's destined for obscurity. ("If the common
people don't understand your work, you're a genius.")  Then, along
comes a gangster (Joe Viterelli) looking for a role for his manifestly
untalented actress girlfriend Olive (Jennifer Tilly).  For the price of
including her in the play, David can have all the money he needs.
Despite a pricking conscience and the warnings of his girlfriend
(Mary-Louise Parker), he agrees.</P>
<P>     To round out the cast, David chooses as his leading lady Helen
"Don't Speak" Sinclair (a wonderfully over-the-top Dianne Wiest), a
star with an ego to match her mammoth reputation, and as his leading
man, British thespian Warner Purcell (the always-reliable Jim
Broadbent), a food addict who falls off the dieting wagon whenever he
gets nervous.</P>
<P>     Despite noteworthy performances by Cusack, Wiest, and Broadbent,
the standout is Chazz Palminteri's Cheech, a hard-bitten wise guy
assigned the duty of chaperoning Olive.  Palminteri proves that his
performance in A BRONX TALE was no fluke.  This is an actor capable of
astonishing breadth and depth, who can effortlessly switch back and
forth from comedy to drama.</P>
<P>     In Jennifer Tilly, Allen has found the perfect actress to play the
helium-voiced, totally untalented Olive.  It's almost frightening how
good Tilly is in this role.  Other than perhaps Melanie Griffith, it's
difficult to conceive of anyone doing as credible a job.  Also making
appearances are Tracey Ullman, Harvey Fierstein, Rob Reiner (who has
all the best lines), Joe Viterelli, Jack Warden, and Mary-Louise Parker
(whose part here echoes that from NAKED IN NEW YORK, where she also was
the playwright's girlfriend).</P>
<P>     With its legitimate issues couched in laughter, BULLETS OVER
BROADWAY is a delight to experience.  Solid performances, a clever
script (which contains at least one truly outrageous twist), and a
jaunty soundtrack of '20s songs keep this movie a notch above many of
Allen's recent films.  And good Woody Allen is always a sure bet for
entertainment.</P>
