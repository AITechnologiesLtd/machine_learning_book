<PRE>Summer Of Sam
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Summer is a magical time. Young children run themselves until exhausted every
day. School kids, free of the tyranny of schedules, discover what they really
want to do. Even responsible adults traditionally take time off the workaday
grind to kick back and have a real life.</P>
<P>In the best of all possible worlds, the season is a time of possibilities.
Hours reading a novel on the front porch swing seem well-spent. Days in the
woods away from the constant electronic hum of civilization are invigorating.
The opposite sexes in their abbreviated warm weather wardrobe are so...err, fetching.</P>
<P>And like almost everything, summer has its darker side. The sweltering heat
and humidity can be oppressive. On a bad day, everything feels dirty and
grimy. Tempers flare.</P>
<P>In 1977, New York city is having a summer of all bad days. The temperatures
are unbearable. A power blackout results in massive looting. The Son of Sam is
murdering innocent lovers and has the city frozen in fear.</P>
<P>For a group of Italian-Americans in the Bronx, it's a time of change. Ritchie
(Adrien Brody) returns to the neighborhood after a few months living uptown
with spiked hair and a bad British accent. Hairdresser Vinny (John Leguizamo)
struggles with his desire to be faithful to his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino),
but repeatedly fails.</P>
<P>As the summer wears on and the murders mount up, paranoia takes center stage.
Women are wearing blonde wigs to throw the killer off track and everyone looks
at their neighbors with suspicion.</P>
<P>The guys start drawing up a list of possible suspects. The priest down the
street is a little odd. Even Reggie Jackson almost makes the list. And
Ritchie? Well, Ritchie's been acting strange since he came back and no normal
person would have hair like that.</P>
<P>Director Spike Lee has a talent for presenting his characters as sympathetic
even with their flaws. Vinny wants to be a good husband, but has bought into
the "whore or Madonna" view of women. He hungers for adventurous sex but can't
bring himself to approach his wife with the idea so he turns to extramarital
affairs. Dionna believes it is her fault he isn't interested in her. (In the
nineties she would have recognized that as co-dependency, the fashionable
psychological defect of the decade.)</P>
<P>Ritchie just wants to play rock and roll, but to buy a guitar he works as a
male prostitute. He looks like a dangerous tough guy, but underneath there's a
gentle side. When he falls in with local "bad girl" Ruby (Jennifer Esposito),
there's genuine affection. During their first time together, she starts to
perform a particularly intimate act on him and he tells her it's not necessary
- they can just spend time together.</P>
<P>At the core of the film is the relationship between Ritchie and Vinny. Friends
since childhood, their camaraderie takes some twists and turns during the long
hot summer, culminating in a Biblical allegory.</P>
<P>Lee has some touches of genius. During the beating of an innocent victim, the
participants discover their error and slowly drift away mostly wordless. It
seems so _real_. His use of varied film stock works to pull us right in. He
has the seventies down, from discos to Plato's Retreat.</P>
<P>But he falters occasionally. Other than the main four, the characters aren't
very well developed and sometimes slip into cliche. When Lee appears in a bit
part as a television reporter, we are pulled out of the film as we recognize him.</P>
<P>The director's biggest risk is showing David Berkowitz (Son of Sam). Although
those scenes are effective in themselves, the film would have worked better if
we had seen only the results of his actions, not him.</P>
<P>There's something undeniably authentic about this film and, considering the
events of the past weeks, hits a little too close to home for comfort.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and would like to
commend the family of Won-Joon Yoon and the Korean Methodist Church for a
subtle yet courageous demonstration of the unity of all people in their
full-page thank-you announcement in the "Herald Times". The message closed
with a quote from Starhawk, a practicing Wiccan.)</P>
