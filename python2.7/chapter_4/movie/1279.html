<PRE>                         MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN is a film directed by John Carpenter.
The script was written by Robert Collector, Dana Olsen, and William
Goldman, based on a novel by H.F.  Saint.   It stars Chevy Chase, Darryl
Hannah, Sam Neil.  Rated PG-13, for mature humor, mild profanity.</P>
<P>     MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN is an agreeable, likeable, barely-there
piece of special-effects fluff.  It's entertaining but it leaves you
wanting to see a real movie, with some substance.</P>
<P>     Certainly, this is Chevy Chase's most engaging and energetic
performance in years, although it cannot compare with the screwball
comedy-mystery he made with Goldie Hawn in the Seventies, except that
both films are set in San Francisco.  And we get to see him briefly nude
twice, which is a pretty high ratio of occurrence for a film in which we
can't see him at all half the time.  Chevy's character could have been
quite interesting: he's a non-ambitious yuppie, a coaster who makes
money despite himself, a b.s. artist, whose comfortable apoliticalness
should be more challenged by his predicament.</P>
<P>     The thing about this Invisible Man movie that is supposed to make
it interesting is its depiction what it would really be like, what would
be the unexpected disadvantages.  Except as a vehicle for the Industrial
Light and Magic magic and for the extended chase that makes up most of
the movie, this psychological (and physical) dynamic is given a pretty
short shrift.</P>
<PRE>     The less said about Daryl Hannah the better.</PRE>
<P>     Sam Neil, as the heavy, gets to turn in a likeably vile
performance.  Ever since the Garden of Eden, the bad guy's been stealing
the show and MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN is no exception.  Of course,
his viciousness and duplicity and ruthlessness are completely
unexplained as character traits.  There are just givens, that is, he's a
spook and that's all we need to know to understand him.  Too bad.</P>
<P>     Carpenter, who was hired on the strength of his STARMAN, does some
wonderful intercutting of Chevy visible and invisible to the audience.
The effects are pretty good, but frankly they are not convincing, that
is, they never fail to look like effects.  Indeed some of them are
amateurishly clumsy, such as the gun held to Neil's head and a headless
Chevy running through a park.  The best is the bubble gum bit and that's
about two minutes into the movie.  Chevy's voice-over hints at a darker
vision, probably inherited from the novel, but Carpenter lets it slide
every time.  Goldman's (et al.)  dialog is consistently intelligent, but
the ending is abrupt and screams sequelitis.</P>
<P>     I might be moved to recommend MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN to you at
matinee prices, but really it all so pointless, isn't it?</P>
