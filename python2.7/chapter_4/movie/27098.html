<PRE>"The Emperor's New Groove"</PRE>
<P>18-year old Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) is an arrogant, egocentric and
selfish young ruler whose philosophy on the lives of his subjects is "don't
know, don't care." Kuzco is so interested in himself and his own pleasures
he doesn't have a clue that his new summer home, Kuzcotopia, will displace
a caring and kindly peasant, Pacha (John Goodman), and his family.
Meanwhile, wicked advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) has her own designs on the
throne and turns the unsuspecting monarch into a llama. It's up to Kuzco
and Pacha to restore him to his human form, return him to the throne and
thwart Yzma's plans in Disney's latest animated feature, "The Emperor's New
Groove."</P>
<P>The one word that jumped into my head after seeing the latest in Disney's
long, long line of animated films is "serviceable." The history behind the
creation of "The Emperor's New Groove" goes back to 1994 when the project
was called "Kingdom of the Sun," a dramatic story inspired by pre-Colombian
legend. As the development process moved along, the tone of the project
changed from the serious to the silly. With the original dramatic intent
taken away, the film became a light comedy with state-of-the-art animations
and an insubstantial story, though a cute one.</P>
<P>Emperor K is a spoiled brat whose own wants and needs are first and
foremost in his mind. He summons peasant Pacha to the palace to inquire
about the beautiful hilltop where Pacha and his family live. Pacha assures
his master that his hill is so special, it makes music. This sounds so
good, Kuzco decides that his newest palace, with pool, will be built there
and tells Pacha to move. The despondent, but loyal, peasant heads home to
break the bad news to his pregnant wife, Chicha (Wendie Malick), and five
daughters.</P>
<P>As Kuzco blithely makes his plans, his ancient and conniving advisor, Yzma,
has delusions of grandeur of her own. The wicked counselor has, for years,
used her exalted status to insinuate herself into a position of power. When
the self-centered Kuzco, putting his own selfish desires aside for a
moment, realizes that Yzma is usurping his throne, he fires her on the
spot. But, since only Kuzco, Yzma and her loyal henchman, Kronk (Patrick
Warburton), know about the dismissal, she decides the best course of action
is to poison the egotistical sovereign and take over his kingdom. The plans
go awry from the start when Kronk gives Kuzco extract of llama instead of a
poison cocktail.</P>
<P>Kuzco, now a talking llama, has no choice but to enlist the help of Pacha
in getting back to the palace and changing back to human form. Meanwhile,
Yzma, realizing that Kronk could not kill the llama king (Kronk is your
basic nice guy), heads out with her muscle-bound assistant to finish the
job herself. It becomes a race against time and nature as Kuzco and Pacha
must brave fierce crocodiles, deadly scorpions and startled bats in their
journey to the castle. It is also an odyssey of change for Kuzco as the
selfish boy-king learns the value of friendship and generosity and becomes
a good man and better emperor in the end.</P>
<P>As Disney animations go you can see the force of skilled animators at work
beneath the surface of the movie. Visually the characters are finely honed
caricatures as they represent simple human virtues and flaws. The emperor,
as voiced by Spade, is really a spoiled brat, used to getting what he wants
whenever he wants. Good or bad, this self-centered attitude lasts through
most of the film, changing only when the final climax looms. The
selfishness and smart-ass attitude given the character by Spade gets tired
after a while. Fortunately, his one-liners, peppered through the film, help
get you by the rotten little kid aspect of Kuzco.</P>
<P>John Goodman is one of the serviceable aspects of the film, as is Eartha
Kitt. Goodman's Pacha is a big-hearted, good-natured peasant who loves to
give to those around him. It's rather inevitable, with such a companion by
his side, that Kuzco is going to learn some valuable, life-affirming
lessons. Kitt gets a low-rent version of Cruella DeVil to play with and
does a decent job breathing life into the old crone that wants the throne.</P>
<P>Stealing the show, though, is Patrick Warburton as the lovable Kronk. The
amiable big guy (he's a size 66 long with a 31-inch waist) is more
interested in the quality of his cooking than in his henchman's duties.
He's particularly proud of his spinach puffs, truth be known. Warburton and
his animation team and writers create a funny, likeable character that is
supposed to be bad but can't be. After all, he was a Junior Chipmunk as a
kid and learned how to talk to squirrels, so how bad can he be. Beyond the
four leads, though, there is little background activity for minor
characters, giving the film a flat feel.</P>
<P>The animation processes used here are the epitome of the quality that we
expect to come out of Disney Studios. There isn't any breakthrough
development as was the case with the "deep canvas" process developed from
"Tarzan," but the creators of "The Emperor's New Groove" utilize every tool
at their disposal to create a fine visual work. The combination of the
animation and, again I say, the serviceable vocal and writing talents
involved help create a light bit of comedy entertainment that will please
all ages, but won't make a lasting impression.</P>
<P>Animation director Mark Dindal co-wrote the story with screenwriter David
Reynolds. They succeed in making a Disney-lite effort that is fast-talking
and very, very hip - mainly due to Spade's chatter and Kronk's likableness.
It fills the bill for the holidays and will keep the kids quiet and adults
entertained. In the end, "The Emperor's New Groove" is a popcorn movie. I
give it a B-.</P>
