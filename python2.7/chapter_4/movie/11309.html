<P>   So you thought that New Zealand was a cute country
whose chief concern was the contemplation of koalas and
kiwis--a veritable Shangri-la far removed from the vexations of
civilization?  Appearances deceive.  The most romantic
hideaways have their closeted cadavers, the most placid
faces their saturnine sides.  In "The Ugly," first-time
writer-director Scott Reynolds hones in on one
of New Zealand's shadowy institutions, one far removed from
the chief tourist centers of Auckland, Wellington and
Christchurch.</P>
<P>   The picture about a serial killer who, like Ted Bundy, has
his charming side, is Grand Guignol, a slasher film which is
different from movies like "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"
in that it takes itself with deadly seriousness. One of its
characters, an unctuous doctor who directs an asylum that
resembles Peter Weiss's anarchic shelter at Charenton, and
two others who serve as guards, are so off-the-wall that they
approach the borders of camp.  Otherwise, "The Ugly" is an
impressive, graphic, genuinely scary feature whose startlingly
low budget belies its inventiveness and craft.</P>
<P>   Viewing do-gooders with a satiric pen that could have been
manipulated by a Rush Limbaugh or an Ayn Rand, Reynolds
focuses on the relationship of a publicity-seeking psychiatrist,
Dr. Karen Shoemaker (Rebecca Hobbs), and the imprisoned
murderer whose psyche she seeks to unsheathe.  As
portrayed by the remarkable Paolo Rotondo, a Napoli-born
actor who moved to New Zealand at the age of eleven, Simon
Cartwright meets the ambitious woman whose audience has
has requested.  yet he does not seem at all like a guy who
hopes the exchange will lead to his early release from the
hideous mental hospital which has contained him for five
years.  Head down at first, he soon responds to Dr.
Shoemaker's plea that he look her in the eye, while she
probes the convict's obsession with killing.  The more he
simply describes in vivid detail the method he uses to
terminate his quarry, the more the doctor insists on knowing
his motivation.  Not satisfied with the prisoner's glib assertion
that he simply enjoyed killing for its own sake (but now
considers himself cured and ready for release), Shoemaker
frequently shucks her sympathetic front to shout and provoke
her subject.  As Simon describes his macabre activities,
Reynolds dramatizes the action.</P>
<P>   Like other horror films, the plot itself is not daringly original. 
Of course the psycho suffered from a traumatic childhood in
the hands of an unhappy mother who alternately embraced
him and made habitual use of the whip.  Certainly he was
taunted by his schoolmates, picked on mercilessly because as
a dyslectic he could not read and therefore did not fit in with
the crowd.  Predictably he is sympathetically supported by
one person, a self-assured, assertive girl who deplores the
way her classmates beat up on the poor kid and who became
his haven against the turmoil.  What gives "The Ugly" its
particular fascination, however, is its style.  Reynolds lathers
the screen for the most part in antiseptic blue, the color of a
mint-flavored Scope, to emphasize the sterility of Simon's life,
occasionally and most effectively shifting to red to highlight
the violent blemishes which exist under Simon's composed
veneer.  When Simon slices his targets from ear to ear, the
blood spurts and gushes, sometimes in naturalistic red, at
other moments in green and black.  Reynolds has great fun
shifting from the present to Simon's past so instantaneously
that we cannot help both marveling at the velocity of the
changes while at the same moments wondering whether
these are simply techniques exploited by recent graduates of
film school.   Especially effective is Reynolds' shoehorning Dr.
Shoemaker into actual scenes of Simon's past, where she
migrates suddenly from her chair in the hospital's interview
chamber to a seat in the well-appointed restaurant to which
he has taken his date.</P>
<P>   The credibility is furthered by Paolo Rotondo's solid
performance as the unsmiling killer who feels compelled to
commit his crimes lest the furies he frequently sees in his
schizoid hallucinations pester him unmercifully.  Reynolds
goes astray only in these moments of torment, conjuring
Simon's victims in the juvenile manner of sophomoric horror
films--women with blood dripping from their lips mouthing
advice like "Kill the bitch."  The wide-eyed, attractive and
confident Karen Shoemaker is portrayed with a riveting
intensity by Rebecca Hobbs, the brutal guards who habitually
beat and harass the inmate are portrayed amusingly by Paul
Glover and Chris Graham, while Roy Ward in the role of Dr.
Marlowe, the warden, projects hostility and suavity with equal
aplomb.</P>
<P>   "The Ugly" may suggest to you an attenuated version of
Lars von Trier's "The Kingdom" in conveying the
hopelessness and corruption of a public hospital.  Politically it
makes a good case for locking up serial killers as incorrigible
and throwing away the keys.  Not Rated.  Running time: 93
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
