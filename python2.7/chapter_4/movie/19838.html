<PRE>The Sixth Sense
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) People have said they appreciate a warning when a
movie ought to be seen without any foreknowledge -- when a review might
somehow take away from the experience. I recommend The Sixth Sense
pretty strongly, and it is a movie that's better if you don't know too
much about it. If you think you might see it, don't read any reviews
until afterwards.</P>

<P>THE SIXTH SENSE may look like a horror movie, but it isn't one. The mood
is tense, but never outright frightening. The movie is not so much a
horror movie as a psychological, supernatural thriller.</P>
<P>Cole (Haley Joel Osment, age 11 -- he played Forrest Gump Jr.) is in a
constant state of fear: he is withdrawn, he wakes up screaming, he shows
signs of possibly self-inflicted scratches and scars. He has a secret
that he keeps from his mother (Toni Collette, of "Muriel's Wedding"), so
she is unable to help with, much less understand, Cole's condition.
Their best hope for Cole is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.</P>
<P>Dr. Crowe (Bruce Willis) is Philadelphia's best child psychologist. He
saw a case remarkably like Cole's once before, but in the end, he
couldn't help the patient. This time, however, he is determined to
succeed. </P>
<P>Dr. Crowe slowly builds trust in Cole, through psychological insight,
through humor, through constant attention. He is finally able to win
Cole's complete trust by baring his own soul: Crowe admits he's afraid
to lose his wife because of his obsession with Cole's case. Cole finally
confides in the doctor and tells his secret: he can see ghosts.</P>
<P>These undead souls are everywhere, in the physically gruesome state of
their deaths. Cole is wakened by them, terrorized by them, and sometimes
even assaulted by them. Dr. Crowe's job suddenly moves way out of his
league, but his promises to Cole and Cole's hard-won trust lock him in
to finishing the job, to doing what he can to help the kid cope.</P>
<P>The film is not perfect, but it is pretty darn good. Shyamalan's
direction is tightly controlled and very well executed. Willis breaks
from his tough-guy image and gives a surprisingly sensitive performance.
Osment is above average for a child actor, and he portrays fear expertly
(although his performance is a little uneven at times.)</P>
<P>But the best thing about the movie is not an individual trait. It is
that all the elements come together to produce the eerie atmosphere that
empathizes with the haunted child. The movie is shot under overcast
skies and cold, fluorescent lights. When night comes and Cole tenses
with fear, the audience tenses with him. The ghosts are rarely glimpsed,
and never for more than a creepy instant. We share Cole's hope that
Crowe can help, and his gray acceptance that he probably can't.</P>
<P>As I said, the film is not perfect. The introduction to Malcolm and his
wife is disgracefully clunky, and the ending is uneven, particularly
compared with the level tension of the rest of the film, but neither
ruined the picture, not by any means.</P>
<P>Look for this movie on my 1999 top ten list.</P>
