<PRE>TOUCH OF EVIL (1958)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Orson Welles
Writers: Paul Monash and Orson Welles (based on the novel by Whit
Masterson)
Starring: Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Orson Welles, Joseph Calleia,
Akim Tamiroff, Mort Mills, Joanna Cook Moore, Ray Collins, Marleine
Dietrich, Keenan Wynn, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joseph Cotten</P>
<P>Orson Welle's "Touch of Evil" and "Citizen Kane" are worlds apart as
films.  One's a hard-boiled old-school piece of pulp; the other is an
ingenius portrayal of a seriously flawed man and the deconstruction of
his myth.  Both are celebrated, but "Kane" has been dubbed the Greatest
Film of All Time by many critics (not believing I can rank any film as
the "Greatest," I refer to it as "possibly..."), while "Touch of Evil"'s
just celebrated.  One would almost feel inclined to diss it a bit, since
it is NOT "Kane," but if you, like me, are a believer in the critiquing
rule that a director's films are all measured on their own merits, you
won't.</P>
<P>Orson directed, co-wrote, and starred in this black and white, moody
little piece of pulp as an obligation to a studio (who first had him
co-starring, but then forced him to write and direct it against his
will), but, as John Travolta said in "Get Shorty" (where he watched it
for a scene), sometimes you do your best work when you have a gun
against your head.  It's another one of those films, like "Chinatown"
and "The Maltese Falcon," where all the elements of film storytelling
come into perfect or near-perfect balance with one another, creating a
satisfying and even rewarding film.  I mean, this is not JUST a piece of
pulp: it has some serious dramatic undertones to it that many pulp films
don't posess.</P>
<P>"Touch of Evil" takes place around the American/Mexican border and
centers around a mexican detective, Ramon Miguel "Mike" Vargas (get
this: Charlton Heston - yeah, HE looks mexican), who becomes involved in
the murder of a border town mayor who was blown up almost on the border
due to a bomb placed on his car in Mexico.  Vargas is merely an
"observer" to the detective work done by the area's celebritated
detective, Hank Quinlan (Orson - at his most obese), a beastly man with
a gimpy leg which he says gives him intuition, which he uses to solve
crimes.  When questioned how he thinks he solved the murder right away,
he says his leg told him.</P>
<P>Also in the story is Mike's new wife, an american gal named Susan (Janet
Leigh, three years before "Psycho"), a buxom but fiercely strong woman
who gets involved with a border town kinda mafia king, "Uncle Joe"
Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), who wants to screw over Mike due to some past
instances.  Although her opening scenes show a very strong will on her
part, she later becomes more essential to the film as an innocent
victim, and pawn in the screwing over of Mike.</P>
<P>Soon into the investigation, Mike discovers that Quinlan has set up a
boy to take the fall for the murder by planting evidence.  Knowing for
sure that he did it, Mike becomes enraged with Hank, and soon starts
spreading bad gossip as well as doing some little investigating of his
own, discovering that Hank, a major celebrity in the area, has been
planting evidence for his entire career.  Soon a desperate Hank joins up
with the weazel-like Grandi in setting up a scandal involving Susan and
some weed (which had to be kinda risque for the time).</P>
<P>What makes this film so great though?  Is it the story?  The plot is
very neat, with very little plot holes, and even some good old
characterization.  But, as the old saying goes, it's not what you tell
but how.  Welles has really created a wonderful little pot-boiler here,
setting up atmosphere, deepening the characters, touching on themes,
and, of course, doing some really nifty camerawork that's still
astounding.</P>
<P>A lot of this film takes place at night, and the cinematography deftly
captures the seedy world of a border town which thrives at night. 
Scenes are shot showing gorgeously ominous shadows lurking eveywhere,
and the darkness even conceals some parts of the town.  One of the best
scenes in the movie involves a murder shot in a room where a light
flashes up and down, creating tension throughout.  Even if the story
wasn't good, the film would still be great to look at.</P>
<P>The characters are very well-drawn, and surprisingly effectively
portrayed by the actors who play them.  While Mike, who is out to seek
the truth, but finds he has to do both while saving his wife, is the
lead character, he is not who the film is about (FYI, Charlton Heston
gives one of his best performances in this film - I was shocked to see
how good he was, as he is usually kinda hokey).  Hank is the target of
the film, as he is a fallen man who took the wrong course in life, has
lived happily with it, and has now found himself taking the plunge.  The
film shows his past life in the form of a woman he once knew (played in
a "guest appearance" by Marlene Dietrich), who symbolically mocks his
weight ("You shoulda laid off those candy bars").  Perhaps he was
tempted by the devil or at least by evil, and, as all evil deeds end up,
is finally learning the price of his choice.  In the film's final
moments, we see him contemplating his choice, but thinking about far too
late in his life to turn back.</P>
<P>The film not only touches on this, but on police corruption, and the
search for truth.  Throughout the latter part of the film, Hank's giddy
old buddy Pete (Joseph Calleia) tries to swade Mike from his exposing
Hank for what he is as he will destroy him as a man.  The film touches
on the question between truth or living with a lie, but says that in all
cases, truth must be told eventually, or all else that comes after will
be plagued.</P>
<P>And what would a Welles film be without cool camera tricks.  "Citizen
Kane" was one of the first films to use innovative camera tricks in such
large capacity which helps the storytelling, and "Touch of Evil" is no
different.  Every shot is brilliantly laid-out, and filled with all the
right atmosphere.  In fact, the opening shot is one of the top ten
greatest openings I've ever seen: a 3 1/2 minute long un-broken
steadicam shot which is one of the first of its kind (the latest
incarnations of this were in Altman's "The Player," and Anderson's
"Boogie Nights").  With a brilliant, pulsating, highly percussive scorse
by the great Henry Mancini, this film is not just brilliantly written
and acted, but brilliantly directed.</P>
<P>"Touch of Evil" may not be a "Citizen Kane" (it's deconstruction of Hank
is hardly up to the brilliance of the deconstruction of Charles Foster
Kane), but it's one of the best examples of film pulp/film noir of all
time, and an example of how directors CAN make brilliance under intense
studio pressure (in fact, in "Ed Wood," Welles - played by uncannily
Vincent D'Onofrio - bitches about how he has to make a film starring
Charlton Heston as a mexican).  "Touch of Evil" may not be a "Kane," but
on its own, it's still a work of a genius filmcraftsman.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
