<P>     Harry Stone (Danny Aiello) is a well-known director who has built
his reputation on doing films of depth and biting satire.  When he
finds himself in a financial bind, however, the lure of a big check
seduces him into compromising his artistic values and directing a
script that no self-respecting professional would associate his name
with.  THE PICKLE (the movie-within-the-movie) is a terrible story
about a giant cucumber that's actually a space ship.  As the premier of
this film approaches, Harry goes through twenty-four hours of intense
anxiety.  He's sure that it's a turkey; he tells everyone this.  The
people around him try to give him support, but little that anyone says
or does seems able to comfort the poor director.</P>
<P>     Paul Masursky's THE PICKLE is a film much in the tradition of such
other recent productions as THE BIG PICTURE and THE PLAYER.  Like those
other two movies, some of this picture is perhaps not ideal for general
consumption.  THE PICKLE is a fine satirical farce.  There are many
scenes that will extract laughs from just about anyone in the audience,
but some of the finer points are designed for those willing to invest a
little effort in understanding what lies beneath the surface of this
film.  THE PICKLE is quirky and, unfortunately, that generally spells
trouble at the box-office.</P>
<P>     For those who like to laugh, there are plenty of such moments in
THE PICKLE.  The humor ranges from the sublime to the bawdy.
Surrounding the lunacy is a fairly interesting story.  The issues of a
mid-life crisis and the battle between art and fame are not new ones,
but Masursky manages to breathe life into them.   He also provides a
few surprises along the way--something refreshing in a medium where it
has become routine to predict how a given film will end.</P>
<P>     THE PICKLE is semi-autobiographical for Masursky.  Not only did he
write, produce, and direct the film, but he has a small part in it.  He
cares about the characters and was able to get his actors to care about
them as well.  This feeling is translated to the audience.  Never for
one moment are we apathetic about the people on screen.</P>
<P>     There are a few cameos, although nowhere near as many as in Robert
Altman's THE PLAYER.   Donald Trump delivers a line and Spaulding Gray
has a brief-but-humorous part as "Doctor Spaulding."  In the
movie-within-a-movie, such notables as Griffen Dunne, Little Richard,
Dudley Moore, and Ally Sheedy make appearances.</P>
<P>     Speaking of that movie-within-a-movie, also titled THE PICKLE, it
is highly reminiscent of MANT, the so-bad-it's-enjoyable flick from the
John Goodman movie MATINEE.  Harry Stone's THE PICKLE is an awful
example of film making, but the bits and pieces of it we see are enough
to make us appreciate it--much in the same way that we can appreciate
sitting through a PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  Stone's THE PICKLE is high
camp--he knows it and so do we.  Fortunately, the same cannot be said
of the movie that frames it.</P>
<P>     The principal actors in Masursky's THE PICKLE all do excellent
jobs.  Danny Aiello, who has perhaps never given a bad performance
(that's not to say that he hasn't been in bad movies), has a good grasp
on Harry Stone and gets the role just right.  A significant range is
demanded, and Aiello is equal to the job.  Also turning in notable
performances are veteran actresses Dyan Cannon and Shelly Winters, as
well as the younger Clothilde Courau.</P>
<P>     Masursky's THE PICKLE is an intriguing combination of drama,
satire, and farce.  It's a credit to the director that he is able to
successfully blend such seemingly-disparate elements together.  There
are parts of the movie that don't work--several black-and-white
flashback sequences do little more than fill up space--but overall THE
PICKLE is certainly one of this year's better efforts.  It's an unusual
film with limited appeal, but for anyone who likes quirky films and
doesn't demand a big-budget Hollywood production, this picture is well
worth a look.  You may be very pleasantly surprised.</P>
