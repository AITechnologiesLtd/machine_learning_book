<PRE>TWO FAMILY HOUSE
----------------</PRE>
<P>Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli, "Summer of Sam") dreams of becoming a singer
after Arthur Godfrey catches him at an armed forces show and asks him to
audition.  Once Buddy's back from WWII, his fiance Estelle (Katherine Narducci, 
HBO's "The Sopranos") and her parents refocus him into a more
'practical' career working at a local factory and living with the in-laws on
Staten Island.  Eleven years later, when a ramshackle two family house is
within his financial reach, Buddy thinks he and Estelle can live upstairs and
convert the downstairs into a tavern where he can entertain in this year's 
Sundance Audience Award winner, "Two Family House."           </P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Estelle hates the house, but just knows that Buddy will lose it anyway.  She 
appears to be right when they can't get rid of their upstairs Irish immigrant 
tenants, the O'Nearys (Kevin Conway, "The Quick and the Dead," and Kelly 
Macdonald, "Trainspotting").  Things get even worse when the woman, Mary, who 
is hugely pregnant, gives birth to a black child.  Mary's abusive husband Jim 
abandons her and Estelle demands that Buddy throw her out to quell the 
neighborhood gossip.  This he does, but guilt nags at him and, even though
he's short on cash himself, he sets her and her child up in a pleasant little
local walkup.  Soon, Mary becomes the encouraging sounding board he's never
had in Estelle.</P>
<P>This is a nice little film, featuring some good performances.  Rispoli
is genuinely likeable, a decent man with modest ambitions.  His quandary
when Estelle demands he throw a young mother out on the street is written
all over his face.  When he finally lets his emotions out (to Mary), he
sinks to his knees and balls his fists in his eyes, then regains his
composure and tries to convince Mary (who's not buying it) that that really
wasn't like him.  His final scene with Estelle contains a simple gesture
that's incredibly moving.</P>
<P>Katherine Narducci makes Estelle frustrating for the audience when she
not only refuses to support Buddy, but belittles him to her girlfriends, 
yet we can only sympathize with her knowing that her behavior is driven by
fear and the parochialism of her 1950s community.  (De Felitta's script
helps her when Buddy's failed business ventures are chronicled in an
amusing montage.)  She's willing to help Mary until the color of Mary's 
child introduces concepts beyond her grasp.</P>
<P>Kelly Macdonald ("Trainspotting") is less engaging than the two leads,
initially suspicious, she barely warms up.  She is sweet when attempting
to purchase Italian groceries, mispronouncing everything, to learn cooking
from Buddy.</P>
<P>Writer/director Raymond De Felitta ("Cafe Society") has based his story
on his uncle, although he's given him a happier ending.  De Felitta shows
more strength in his direction than his writing.  While his dialog rings
true for its time and place (a lot of ethnic and racial slurs are flung
around), his story telegraphs its every move.  The film's climax begins
powerfully, but devolves into a stickily sweet romanticism that logically
doesn't ring true.</P>
<P>Still "Two Family House" is an engaging slice of life that I would particularly
recommend to the generation portrayed, the ones that begat us baby boomers.</P>
