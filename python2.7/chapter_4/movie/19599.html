<PRE>WANDAFURU RAIFU</PRE>
<PRE>AFTER LIFE
Written and Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda
With Takashi Mochizuki, Taketoshi Naito
Plan B     not rated   118 min</PRE>
<P>     One of the most endearing and enduring subgenres of cinema is the
peek behind the curtain to a glimpse of the Great Beyond.  The way we
choose to imagine the hereafter tells us a few things about ourselves,
and for the most part we seem to prefer a prosaic, familiar feel to
it.  For a Crossing the Bar Film Festival at home, check the video
store for some of the following: "Green Pastures" (1936), "Our Town"
(1940), "Here Comes Mr.  Jordan" (1941) -- remade as "Heaven Can Wait"
(1978), "Stairway to Heaven" (1946), "Truly, Madly, Deeply" (1990),
"Defending Your Life" (1991)...the list goes on and on, and most of
them are wonderful.</P>
<P>Which brings us to the latest, a Japanese film called, in
Japanese, "Wandafuru Raifu" ("Wonderful Life") and released here as
"After Life".  Writer-director Kore-eda's set-up here is a processing
station at which the newly-dead are politely interviewed by young
bureaucrats sitting at desks in a dingy office building, and asked to
think of one memory that they would like to take with them into
eternity.  Once they have chosen, all other memories of their lives
will be erased.  The memory is then recreated by the staff on film,
using props and makeshift sets that resemble the resources of a very
down-at-the-heels summer stock company.  Everything about this
production is simple and bare-bones, and this leaves room for the
complexity to express itself in the film's ideas.</P>
<P>How do you settle on the one memory?  It's a hell of a choice,
and after watching this movie's wonderful characters grin and scratch
their heads and wrack their brains to come up with the right choice,
you'll find yourself playing the game for the rest of the evening on
your own.</P>
