<PRE>THE LIMEY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Steven Soderbergh
Written by: Lem Dobbs</PRE>
<P>I've always disliked the saying: "A triumph of style over substance". This
might be because it is so overused when applied to movies with both style
and substance (like last year's "Fight Club"). However, I can think of no
more accurate description for Steven Soderbergh's ("Out of Sight") "The
Limey". Soderbergh's film is so steeped in style that you may not even
notice what a hollow movie it really is. You'll most likely be too busy
marveling at the way Soderbergh shifts time periods in a split second while
continuing one narrative; or the way he manages to make footage from old
Terence Stamp movies fit seamlessly into this current story to notice what a
frightfully boring and often incoherent film "The Limey" really is.</P>
<P>Wilson (Terence Stamp) is a man just released from prison after serving time
for armed robbery. He receives a letter from a man in America, named Ed
(Luis Guzman), telling him that his daughter, Jenny (Melissa George), has
just died in a car accident. Wilson travels from England to meet with Ed, in
order to determine who "snuffed" his daughter. His search soon leads him to
Jenny's ex-boyfriend, Valentine (Peter Fonda). Valentine is a rich music
producer who also dabbles in drug running. Wilson also meets up with Elaine
(Lesley Ann Warren), Jenny's voice coach in acting school. Wilson, Elaine,
and Ed decide to take Valentine down, with a little unwelcome help from the
police, who are looking for the money from Valentine's last run.</P>
<P>If you sit back and just look at the plot of this film, without any of the
style or interesting camera work, you'll see what a simple film it really
is. When you get right down to it, "The Limey" is nothing more than a
simplistic revenge story. While Soderbergh's direction may be innovative,
it's also rather confusing at times. Images we sometimes see in the middle
of the movie have already happend long ago, or will happen at the end of the
film. While we're being shown these scenes which may not have happened yet,
the characters in the present keep chattering on even though we can no
longer see them. It seems interesting at first, but eventually it's just
annoying. It also hinders the story because half the scenes shown during
these moments are never explained.</P>
<P>The acting in "The Limey" is certainly the film's strongest element. Terence
Stamp (who most of today's audiences will only know from his brief
appearance in "Star Wars: Episode One") is simply brilliant as a vengeful
man who was going to start his life over. Peter Fonda, who gave a great
performance in "Ulee's Gold", is sadly miscast yet still manages to do an
adequate job. Luis Guzman ("Magnolia") is one of those actors who shows up
in almost everything, and all you can think is "I know that guy from
somewhere". He does quite a good turn here as Wilson's rather reluctant
sidekick. Last, we have Lesley Ann Warren ("Twin Falls Idaho") giving a
great, understated performance as the mother Jenny never had. Unfortunately,
Warren and Guzman are given very little screen time considering what
interesting characters they play.</P>
<P>"The Limey" will certainly go down in history as one of the most fashionable
movies of the '90s, but I do hope people in the future are able to see it
for what it really is: candy coated outside, empty inside. The movie may
only run 86 minutes, but a lot of that time is filler because there is so
little plot. As a result, the subplot about Valentine's drug running and
troubles with the law are hardly touched upon. Instead, we get scenes like
Terence Stamp walking in front of a wall while he talks about his mates back
in England. I recommend "The Limey" to arthouse film students, but I can't
recommend it to anyone else because I guarantee the rest of you will be
quite bored. I give it three out of five stars for acting and technical
merit.</P>
