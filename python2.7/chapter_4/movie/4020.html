<PRE>==</PRE>
<P>There's actually a pretty good plot device at the center of this
overblown, undercooked vineyard romance.  Keanu Reeves stars as the
phony husband of an unwed, pregnant stranger (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon).
They meet on a train, and, later, a bus, where he learns that she's a
college student in need of an explanation for her Mexican-American
family.  He's a returned WWII GI who's already hitched, so he agrees to
play the "gringo" for just one night.  The plan, for him, is to leave
the next morning, but, ah, well, the rest is history.</P>
<P>The comic potential in this set-up is great, as producers Jerry and
David Zucker surely must have noticed, but director Alfonso Arau (LIKE
WATER FOR CHOCOLATE) has been saddled with two burdens:  a weak script,
and a stiff lead.  The dialogue is extra-bad, especially when overdoing
it on the life lessons.  (Most of which come from the mouth of Anthony
Quinn, also overdoing it as the lusty grandfather.) Then there's Keanu.
Well.. he tries.  He's just too stiff to be taken seriously.  And don't
call him Shirley.</P>
<P>Both of these demerits do wonders to cancel out the more appealing
aspects of the movie.  Sure, it's overdone-- the music, the drama, even
the golden-hued photography of Emmanuel Lubezki-- but the more playful
parts of this story suggest that, with a stronger core, A WALK IN THE
CLOUDS could've been heavenly.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>A KID IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT
============================</PRE>
<P>Twain keeps a-rollin' with this CONNECTICUT YANKEE update that sends a
14-year-olde little-leaguer (the charmless Thomas Ian Nicolas) back to
the 12th Century, via an earthquake.  He's there at the request of
Merlin (Ron Moody!), who has sent for a "great warrior" to aid King
Arthur and Camelot.  The King (Joss Ackland) needs help because he has
two royal daughters who need wooing-- as well as a scheming aide who
isn't (Art Malik, in the Frank Langella role).  Imagine the sorcerer's
surprise when somebody *other* than Richard Gere shows up.</P>
<P>This is dumb, inoffensive kid's stuff with hardly a whiff of innovation
about it.  The plot is the worst-- come on, how many teens carry a
flashlight (and a cd player.. and rollerblades.. and superglue..) in
their backpack?  And are those rubber tips at the end of their lances?
Surely you joust.  The whole thing is overscored and overlong, the
latter by at least twenty minutes.  But, hey, this is Disney, where
fluff is stuff and lame makes millions.</P>
<P>(To be fair, there are a few laughs, usually from the kid's reworking of
the Kings English.  Sample dialogue:  "Your chain has been royally
pulled."  The cast is also quite nice, though underused.  Look for
HEAVENLY CREATURES' Kate Winslet as Arthur's older daughter.)</P>
<PRE>SHORT NOTE:  Bundled with RUNAWAY BRAIN, the first new Mickey Mouse
             cartoon in 42 years.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
=======================</PRE>
<P>In SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT, aka A SOUTHERN WOMAN'S GUIDE TO INFIDELITY,
the characters don't really talk at all.  Sure, there's a confession
here, and a frank comment there-- the latter usually coming from Kyra
Sedgwick, smartly cast as Julia Robert's lookalike sister.  Instead,
most of the story time is spend on jokey outbursts, such as when Roberts
stands up in the middle of a meeting to ask if anyone *else* has slept
with her husband (Dennis Quaid, having a had hair day).</P>
<P>Scenes like these are too cutesy for what writer Callie Khouri (THELMA
AND LOUISE) is trying to dig at.  They disrupt the tone, much in the
same way that slapstick diminished the delivery of NINE MONTHS.  (Of
course, Hugh Grant wasn't married.  Oh, wait, that was real life.) By
the second hour, Khouri's point is lost as she inexplicably points her
characters toward a happily-ever-after finale that you can see coming
from a mile off.  Maybe *that's* her point.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>Briefly..
=========</PRE>
<P>Also check out CRUDE OASIS, the remarkable debut of writer/director/
producer/editor Alex Graves.  The story-- which centers on a depressed
Kansas housewife, and plays like an inverted BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY--
was shot in 14 days for a mere $25K.  Even blown up from 16mm, there's
still more dramatic potency here than almost all the other summer stock
combined.  An oasis, *indeed*.</P>
