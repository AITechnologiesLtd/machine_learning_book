<P>Synopsis: Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a male model in the twilight of his 
career who becomes brainwashed by fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell). 
Mugatu wants Zoolander to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, who 
plans to introduce new child-labour laws which will cripple the fashion 
industry. Mugatu's scheme is uncovered by reporter Matilda Jeffries 
(Taylor), who convinces Zoolander to join forces with his archrival, 
up-and-comer Hansel (Wilson), to stop Mugatu before Zoolander's 
programming is activated.</P>
<P>Review: "Zoolander" will no doubt invite comparisons with the "Austin 
Powers" movies, since both title characters are image-conscious dolts 
embroiled in global conspiracies. But whereas Austin was a satire on the
entire James Bond-style spy genre, Zoolander is just a pastiche on a 
specific profession: the male model, with the espionage elements grafted 
on rather arbitrarily. There is, therefore, comparatively less material to 
be mined in this release, but Stiller does a good job of working his 
premise for every last ounce of humour. As Zoolander, Stiller finds the 
right note somewhere between sympathetic dimwittedness and head-smacking 
stupidity. He matches up well with Wilson, whose performance here echoes 
his role in "Shanghai Noon"; his Aryan poster child, Hansel, exudes the 
right amount of brash confidence and, well, head-smacking stupidity. 
Taylor is more poorly served by the script, which provides her with little 
personality beyond "beautiful crusading reporter". And Ferrell is amusing 
-- and, fortunately, not overused -- as the fiendish Mugatu. Not all the 
jokes work, but there are flashes of brilliance, such as Derek's indignant 
reaction to the unveiling of a miniature school for underprivileged 
youngsters. And even when it's less than successful, the sheer vitality 
Stiller brings to "Zoolander" helps distinguish it from similar fare.</P>
