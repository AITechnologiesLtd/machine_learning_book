<PRE>Rush Hour</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan
Directed By Brett Ratner
Running Time: 1 hour 37 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>A standard buddy movie with the added delight of Jackie Chan. The little guy
from Asia is also dynamite on screen, and that's no exception in this
western interpretation of a Chan film. The trailer explains this one's
concept the best; "when the fastest hands in the east meets the biggest
mouth in the west." The biggest mouth in the west happens to be new
sensation Chris Tucker, fresh from The Fifth Element. Chan and Tucker play
Detectives Lee and James Carter, who are both on the case of finding a young
Asian girl who has been kidnapped. The standard buddy movie stuff happens:
big explosions, 'witty' one liners, and a silly plot. Rush Hour is more
amiable than most buddy films, however, due to the chemistry between the two
leads, and Chans outrageously fast action sequences.</P>
<P>This is definitely Chans film, and he lights the screen every time he
appears. His action scenes are much funnier and faster than anything Arnie
or Stallone has done, and they also rely much less on guns. His English is
also very good, and away from action he's still likeable and delivers a
rounded performance. Tucker is more unpredictable, he's a more immature
Eddie Murphy. He's high pitch whine could grate, and he doesn't get the
lines he deserves, but he could be worse. Still, something clicked with
American audiences, as this film was one of the sleeper hits of 1998. The
supporting cast are the usual stereotypical police, and the 'love interest'
is the amusing Elizabeth Pena. If you're an action freak, don't worry: the
film doesn't even attempt to provide any character development (except the
standard scene where the mismatched cops 'bond.') Tom Wilkinson makes an
unexpected appearance fresh from The Full Monty, and an embarrassed looking
Chris Penn also pops up (probably as a favour to someone.)</P>
<P>There's some reasonable action, and some impressive explosions which make
Rush Hour all the more enjoyable, if somewhat predictable. The soundtrack is
good, featuring the usual Def Jam tunes to a funny sequence where Chan puts
Beach Boys on the radio. ("Don't ever touch a black mans radio" Tucker
retorts.) The writers, Ross LaManna and Jim Kouf, have churned off an
average script, but it is somewhat likeable. There's nothing here that
hasn't been seen before, however. Director Brett Ratner also handles things
pretty well, but again it's somewhat average.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Rush Hour, like it's title, never lags, due to Chans quirky
charm and Tuckers "Eddie Murphy" shtick. The plot may be middle of the road,
the character development non existent, and the film does seem to have
nowhere to go about three quarters into the film, but there's nothing
fundamentally flawed with the movie. Jackie Chan fans should certainly take
a look: for everyone else, Rush Hour is an entertaining waste of 97 minutes.</P>
