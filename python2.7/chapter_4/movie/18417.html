<P>No, it's not the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, but it sure feels like
it.  Cuba Gooding Jr. (What Dreams May Come) stars as Theo Caulder, an
ass-kissing, ladder-climbing psych resident at the University of Miami.
Caulder's mentor (Donald Sutherland, Without Limits) gives him a dream
assignment – to clinically evaluate a convicted murderer just days
before his competency hearing.</P>
<P>The killer is Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins, Meet Joe Black), a
former anthropology professor at the U of M.  The mild-mannered Powell
disappeared while studying a family of gorillas in an African jungle,
only to re-emerge two years later as a crazy-eyed killer with long
hair.  He also hasn't spoken since his capture, so Caulder has his work
cut out for him.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Caulder must agree to evaluate the other kooks in Harmony
Bay prison.  The result is an annoyingly contrived peripheral plot that
does nothing but slow down the pace of the film, as does the strange
relationship between Caulder and Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney,
NewsRadio).  Of other interest is the prison battle between Powell and
the sadistic guard, played by eternal bad guy John Ashton (Meet the
Deedles).  Meet Joe Black?  Meet the Deedles?  Meet the back of my hand.</P>
<P>What could have happened in the jungle to turn the esteemed Dr. Powell
from Richard Attenborough in Miracle on 34th Street to Sean Connery in
the beginning of The Rock?  What ever it was, it couldn't have been as
horrible as sitting through this beast of a film.  Instinct drags along
like Keyser Soze's gimpy leg, stopping only to feature a few bad cliches
(namely a prison rebellion scene reminiscent of the football drama
Rudy).</P>
<P>On the plus side, Gooding is a lot better than Denzel Washington would
have been if he had won the role (and he probably would have three years
ago).  Gooding shows range and charisma, both words assumed to be
unknown to Mr. Washington.  The interaction between Gooding and Hopkins
is also better than average, but when they swap their roles of doctor
and patient, you can't help but think of the far superior relationship
between Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter and his evaluator, Clarice Starling.</P>
<P>Directed by Jon Turteltaub (Phenomenon), Instinct is based on a book
called `Ishmael' by Daniel Quinn and adapted for the screen by Message
in a Bottle scribe Gerald DiPego.  It features some very real-looking
fake gorillas, courtesy of Stan Winston, and has a classy Danny Elfman
score.  The good news is that the novel that will serve as the sequel to
Lambs comes out soon.  The bad news is that it may not be good enough to
wash off the stench of Instinct.  (2:04 – R for intense violent
behavior)</P>
