<PRE>                              CAPE FEAR
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     The Phantom was pleased to see that the classic "psycho stalks
innocent family" potboiler is alive and well in 1991; CAPE FEAR's 1962
plot still creaks like a porch swing in the wind and its dialogue is
still as wooden as the porch itself, but with his very up-to-date
remake, Martin Scorsese has done for the thriller what Brian DePalma did
for gangster films with his remake of SCARFACE: he's made a somewhat
tongue-in-cheek, fairly scary, and very enjoyable film that gives its
audience exactly what it wants and expects.</P>
<P>     Although Scorsese sticks pretty close to the original film (and
even scatters a handful of references to it throughout his version), the
new CAPE FEAR has been updated enough that it no longer feels like
something you might catch on late-night TV when the only alternatives
are program-length commercials and pitches for 900 "chat" lines.  Though
at times CAPE FEAR's plot gets bogged down under the weight of its own
unlikely machinations, it generally zips along from one predictable
scene to the next, moving quickly to an equally predictable climax and
denouement.  None of this is bad, mind you -- CAPE FEAR is hardly food
for thought, shot through though it is with enough references to
philosophers and famous authors to keep the conversations at three
pretentious art houses rolling long into the night.  It wasn't intended
to make people think thirty years ago, and Scorsese certainly hasn't
done anything to change that.  What it *was* intended to do was give
people a frightening situation and sympathetic characters with which to
identify, and a satisfying conclusion a little under two hours later so
that they could all go home a little bit happier than they arrived,
ready to face their own personal demons and dilemmas with renewed
confidence and vigor.</P>
<P>     Doing so is even easier now that Robert DeNiro plays the psycho,
doing things that likely never even crossed Robert Mitchum's mind in the
original.  He at times comes close to the lunatic performance he turned
in for Scorsese's 1976 classic TAXI DRIVER, though ultimately Max Cady
is a much less psychotic and a much more human character than was Travis
Bickle.  Max is a menace from first scene to last, and the fact that
Scorsese has made the family he stalks a little less perfect than
Gregory Peck's family was in the original does nothing to lessen the
empathy we feel for them.  In fact, it does just the opposite; in the
complex world of the 90s, it would be difficult for audiences to believe
that such a perfectly innocent family could possibly exist, and who
knows -- they might even start rooting for Max.</P>
<P>     Rooting for Max, though, is still a problem, as DeNiro is easily
the best thing in the film.  Unlike THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, wherein
audiences were awed by Hannibal Lector but ultimately rooted for Clarice
Starling, CAPE FEAR presents us with one very interesting villain and
one very uninteresting family.  Try as he might to spice up Sam Bowden's
family, Scorsese can't take what is essentially an unbalanced film and
turn it into something it was never intended to be.  By making Cady such
an impressive character (and by allowing DeNiro to start gnawing at the
scenery more than a few times), Scorsese gives us no other point of
focus, and when the film returns to Nick Nolte and his family, we feel
like counting the minutes until Cady's next appearance.  The film truly
revolves around him, rather than around Sam Bowden and his besieged
family, and that's just one of CAPE FEAR's fundamental problems.</P>
<P>     Another is that Scorsese piles on the directorial flourishes that
he's always used in moderation to enhance his other films.  In
GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL, the camera work and editing helped pull the
audience into the film, where they discovered that there was more to
each of these films than just what was apparent from a casual viewing.
But in CAPE FEAR, the nervous camera work, flashy editing, and excessive
and obvious tricks of cinematography are all for naught -- once we get
past them we discover that this film has no deeper meaning, no reason to
exist beyond what is apparent to us on the surface.  By the third time
he shows us the Spielberg-esque roiling skies over the troubled town,
it's difficult to think of anything other than POLTERGEIST and half a
dozen bad horror films.  Scorsese also seems obsessed by the meaningless
and distracting trick of turning color into black-and-white negatives;
once would have been visually interesting, though rather portentous, but
as with every other cinematic effect in the film, Scorsese overuses it.
All those negatives did serve to remind the Phantom that he was overdue
for his annual dental checkup, but beyond that it is painfully obvious
that the effects are in the film simply to be in the film.  By the end
of CAPE FEAR, the Phantom had new respect for the work of the Coen
brothers, whose flashy but similarly empty BLOOD SIMPLE is a far less
overwrought and a far more successful film.</P>
<P>     Having said all this, however, the Phantom should hasten to add
that CAPE FEAR was still a lot of fun to watch, especially if one
doesn't go into it expecting Scorsese's typically excellent work.  This
film doesn't hold a candle to GOODFELLAS, and truth be told it's really
one of his lesser efforts.  Still, there's a lot to be said for sitting
back, relaxing, and watching DeNiro become one family's worst nightmare.
And then there's his accent, which in the Phantom's opinion certainly
gives Al Pacino's hilariously bad Cuban accent in SCARFACE a run for its
money as the least plausible accent in modern film history (this is true
only if we discount Kevin Costner's performance in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF
THIEVES; Costner is without a doubt the Tony Curtis of our time, and
just as Curtis brought his unique Brooklyn accent to every one of his
roles, so too does Costner bring a little bit of California with him
into Sherwood forest where he is the least well-spoken in his band of
merry men).</P>
<P>     That accent -- and whatever it is that DeNiro constantly does with
his mouth -- brought a smile to the Phantom's own mouth more than a few
times; it also served to keep the Phantom from trying to read too much
into the somewhat loopy goings-on in the film.  As long as CAPE FEAR is
taken as pure, predictable entertainment, it works fairly well.  That
was the spirit in which the Phantom saw CAPE FEAR, and taken thusly, the
film is good for a solid two hours of fun.  Scorsese's overwrought (but
well executed) special effects will likely lose a lot on the small
screen, and Elmer Bernstein's adaptation of the wonderful score for the
original CAPE FEAR will similarly suffer when squeezed through the
2-inch speaker in your Sony, so the Phantom recommends seeing CAPE FEAR
while it's still in theaters.</P>
<P>     And now, because the Phantom's review is a little short this time,
here's an example of what "professional" reviewers can sometimes get
away with.  The Phantom's occasionally excessive alliteration typically
can't hold a candle to the delightful examples that Vincent Canby slips
into his film reviews for the New York Times every so often.  Here's
Vincent Canby on CAPE FEAR:</P>
<P>    [...]  Though their "Cape Fear" is no more realistic or socially
    significant than Mr. Thompson's, it moves with the same merciless
    melodramatic momentum as Mr. Scorsese's "Goodfellas."  The film is
    sleight of hand of high order and, at carefully calculated moments,
a
    blunt shocker.</P>
<P>    Unlike the original, this "Cape Fear" doesn't pretend to be a
picture
    of paradise in peril.  It is apparent from the beginning that all is
    not well [...]</P>
<P>     For all his faults, the Phantom has always been a phan of Canby's;
now if only someone would volunteer to pay the Phantom for his own
efforts he'd be able to quit his day job and attend more matinees.  Nice
work if you can get it...</P>
