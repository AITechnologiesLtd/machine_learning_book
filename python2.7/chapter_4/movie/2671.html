<P>     I LOVE TROUBLE is a perfect example of a truly lightweight motion
picture.  With its preposterous plot and MTV-like camerawork, this
movie survives--and occasionally even thrives--on the likeability of
its performers and the unexpectedly frothy chemistry between them.
This is a watchable film for those who don't expect or demand much from
their summer entertainment.</P>
<P>     Peter Brackett (Nick Nolte) has Chicago eating out of his hands.
As the star columnist for THE CHICAGO CHRONICLE, he can recycle
nine-year old pieces and still earn the plaudits of his numerous fans.
Thanks to his newly-published detective novel WHITE LIES, Brackett is
at the apex of his career.  His life and job have become soft and
easy--until Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts) comes along.</P>
<P>     Peterson is only in her second day of work for THE CHICAGO GLOBE
when she meets Brackett.  Their rivalry starts almost immediately, with
her scooping him.  Thus begins a duel of one-upsmanship that leads to
the pair entering into a tentative partnership in their pursuit of the
ultimate story:  who is behind the derailment of a train that caused
five deaths, and why did they do it?</P>
<P>     Taking this film at face value, one might be tempted to say that
the mystery elements are merely plot devices around which to build the
Peterson/Brackett relationship.  This certainly seems to be the case
early on.  However, somewhere along the way, screenwriters Meyers and
Shyer apparently decided that they had the makings of a decent thriller
on their hands.  As a result, far too much time is spent expanding upon
an element of the plot that makes very little sense and has almost no
audience appeal.</P>
<P>     I LOVE TROUBLE ends up being about 30 minutes too long.  The last
half-hour especially drags, as the interaction between Brackett and
Peterson is curtailed in favor of shoot-outs, chases, and a lot of
idiotic exposition.  We have yet another example of a villain holding a
hero at gunpoint and gleefully explaining his entire crime.</P>
<P>     When I LOVE TROUBLE is focusing on the interplay between Nolte and
Roberts, it's generally enjoyable, despite some atrocious dialogue.  A
lot of the so-called "witty repartee" between the two principals ends
up sounding horribly contrived.  The actors, however, hold things
together.  They're like Bogart and Becall or Tracy and Hepburn sparring
with each other good-naturedly, sexual tension crackling between them.
Stick a pair of mismatched, marginal performers in the roles of
Brackett and Peterson, and I LOVE TROUBLE might have been very, very
bad.</P>
<P>     Nolte rarely gives a subpar performance, and this is no exception
as he lends the full force of his not inconsiderable talent into
playing Brackett.  Julia Roberts generally does her best work in
lighter roles (even though it has elements of a thriller/mystery, I
LOVE TROUBLE is, at heart, a romantic comedy), and her Peterson proves
an apt foil for Brackett.  The pair work well together, regardless of
what they're doing or saying, and it's a credit to them both that
they're able to overcome so many of the script's faults and still keep
the audience interested.</P>
<P>     Alas, screen charisma and chemistry can only get you so far, and
that's the problem with this sort of film.  The dubious premise is not
well-executed, and the final product too often emphasizes its
weaknesses rather than its strengths.  The sad truth is that whenever I
LOVE TROUBLE relies on something other than its two stars, it's in
trouble.</P>
