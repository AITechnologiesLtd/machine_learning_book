<P>If you're shocked by the mayhem Mel Gibson perpetrates in "Payback,"
keep in mind that Gibson first rose to international stardom in
director George Miller's "Mad Max" movies, deliriously violent
spectaculars in which the only rule seemed to be "kill or be killed."
In the two decades since, Gibson has mellowed out considerably. True,
plenty of blood has been spilled in the "Lethal Weapon" movies, but
director Richard Donner has upped the levity quotient so much over the
years that last summer's "Lethal Weapon 4" was practically a sitcom
with occasional kung-fu interludes.</P>
<P>The extraordinarily brutal "Payback" could also be seen as a comedy,
albeit an extremely sick and twisted one that offers Gibson the rare
opportunity to play against type. Some of his fans will applaud the
stretch, many will be appalled, and no one should expect a film this
unrelentingly nasty to become a major hit at the box office.</P>
<P>But don't be surprised if, 10 years down the line, "Payback" is hailed
as a minor cult classic. It may be bloody, sleazy and populated
entirely by trashy people, but this picture is also subtly stylish,
sensationally acted and - if you appreciate extremely bitter humor -
pretty funny as well. Somehow, someday, somewhere, "Payback" will get
its due.</P>
<P>Fittingly, at the center of the movie is a guy who's just trying to
get what he thinks he deserves. Porter (Gibson) was swindled out of
$70,000 and left for dead by backstabbing former partners, one of whom
used the money to pay off a debt to "the outfit." Now Porter wants
arefund, and woe to those who stand in his way, be they man, woman or
dog.</P>
<P>In terms of plot, that's about all "Payback" has to offer. What makes
the movie crackle is a cast of powerhouse actors and the vivid colors
in the script by Terry Hayes and director Brian Helgeland.</P>
<P>Porter's wife (Deborah Kara Unger) is a junkie who hides her works in
music boxes and in the hollowed-out heels of platform shoes. The only
thing Porter's ex-friend Val (Gregg Henry) enjoys more than roughing
up others is getting pulverized by dominatrix Pearl (Lucy Liu of "Ally
McBeal").</P>
<P>"Payback" also manages to accommodate a nod to Neil Jordan's memorable
"Mona Lisa," as Porter finds himself drawn to the pricey call girl
Rosie (Maria Bello) he's been driving around town. But the dialogue is
anything but lovey-dovey. "I think all those stories about your being
dead are true," Rosie tells Porter. "You're just too thick-headed to
admit it."</P>
<P>It's juicy stuff, and Helgeland demonstrates a terrific feel for the
material.  "Payback" has been shot in a cool blue tint that makes it
seem like a snapshot from the past, an effect enhanced by disorienting
backgrounds that include New Jersey commuter trains alongside Chicago
street signs.</P>
<P>It's already been widely reported that the primary reason the release
of "Payback" has been held up for the past six months has been
differences between Gibson and Helgeland over exactly how dark the
movie should be. Not being able to see the original cut, we'll
probably never know for certain what it was like, but it's doubtful it
was any better than this vicious, jolting little amorality play. James
