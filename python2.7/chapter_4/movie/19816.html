<PRE>The Blair Witch Project (1999)
**** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard
Written and Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez
Running Time: 87 minutes
Date Reviewed: July 30, 1999</P>
<P>In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods
near Burkittsville,
Maryland, while shooting a documentary.  One year later, their footage
was found.  Thus
begins The Blair Witch Project, one of the best (yet extremely
frustrating) thriller/horror
movies to be released in a long, long time.</P>
<P>As this ultra low budget movie begins we follow the doomed film crew
consisting of Heather the director (Heather Donahue), Josh the
cameraman (Joshua Leonard), and Mike the sound guy (Michael
C. Williams) getting ready to begin their documentary.  They set out
to the town of Burkittsville, Maryland and begin to interview the
locals about an urban legend of sorts...  the story of the Blair
Witch.  Various soundbites are gathered, and then on day two the crew
sets off into the woods.  They are never seen again.  The audience
however, vaguely gets to see what happened to them over the next few
days, thanks to Heather's inexplicable urge to film every terrifying
moment of their ordeal.</P>
<P>All of the critical praise this film is getting might just work
against it with the casual moviegoer.  In countless ads and reviews
the word "scary" is used over and over again.  "It's scary as hell."
"The scariest movie ever."  Saying the film is scary is only going to
frustrate the casual moviegoer who is expecting Poltergeist or The
Haunting.  There are no special effects, no scary music, and no
monsters.  Don't get me wrong though, it is CREEPY as hell (especially
the film's final 30 seconds or so).</P>
<P>However slight, there is actually a difference between scary and
creepy.  A scary movie would be something that makes you jump or even
scream out loud, either by genuine terror or through those cheesy
music cues when a cat jumps out of nowhere.  A creepy movie like The
Blair Witch Project sets the stage for something scary to happen...
but ultimately never delivers.  Nothing ever makes you jump and
nothing ever makes you scream, even though the stage is fully set for
that to happen at any given moment.</P>
<P>Now let me give credit where credit it due.  When The Blair Witch
Project tries to be creepy it succeeds masterfully.  As the crew
settles down each night to sleep, that's when things start to get
creepy.  Basically, whenever the sun goes down, get ready to almost be
scared.  That's mainly what kept frustrating me though.  Sometimes the
night would go by too quickly.  If Heather is going to insist on
continuing to film these now nightmarish conditions they are being
exposed to, you would think that there would be more of these night
scenes.  Instead, there's more of the "human drama" which takes place
during the daytime.</P>
<P>The three principle cast members are all new to the film world, and
all are very good here.  I'm sure the casting was based simply on
budgetary constraints, but the film just wouldn't have been as
effective with any familiar faces.  As a result of the casting, you
feel like you're watching a real documentary.</P>
<P>In today's day and age of whiz bang CGI effects and no-brainer Kevin
Williamson crud, I'm all for the "less is more" approach for the
horror genre.  The Blair Witch Project takes that a step further,
opting for the "nothing is even less than less is more, so we'll give
you nothing" approach.  The filmmakers lull you into a false sense of
security with the first half of the film, which is basically just a
humorous story about low budget documentarians.  Then the creepiness
sets in which is very effective, but as I said it ultimately never
pays off.  We know just as much about what happens to these people
when the movie begins as we do when the final credits roll.  In a way
that bothers me, but the movie is entertaining and original enough to
make me overlook it's non-payoff.</P>
<P>Artisan Entertainment (the distributor of the film) has set up an
EXTENSIVE and very cool web site for The Blair Witch Project.  Check
it out.  Also, there's a special hour long documentary airing on The
Sci-Fi Channel called Curse of the Blair Witch that actually manages
to blur the lines between reality and the fantasy of this movie even
further.  [R]</P>
