<PRE>                                   RICH GIRL
                         A film review by Ken Johnson
                          Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>97 min., R, Comedy/Romance, 1991
Distributor: RCA/Columbia
Director: Joel Bender
Cast: Jill Schoelen, Don Michael Paul, Sean Kanan, Ron Karabatsos,
      Paul Gleason, Cherie Currie, Bentley Mitchum, Melanie Tomlin,
      Trudi Forristal, Ann Gillespie, Gail Neely, Dennis Holahan</P>
<P>      Young rich Jill Schoelen gets sick of her father Gleason using his
connections to get her what she wants.  In protest she leaves his house
and gets herself a small apartment.  She doesn't have any work
experience, so Schoelen ends up getting a job as a waitress at a club
run by Karabatsos.   There, while working, she sees singer Don Michael
Paul and falls in love with him.  Don Michael Paul has little schooling
and a police record.  Gleason doesn't like Schoelen's relationship with
Don Michael Paul and aims to break it up.</P>
<P>      I found RICH GIRL to be very entertaining.  I give it a four on a
zero to five scale.  I recommend this film more to teenagers and people
in their early twenties because I feel that they would enjoy the film
more than adults.  RICH GIRL is rated R for explicit language, adult
situations, violence, and female nudity.</P>
<P>      RICH GIRL was in the movie theaters in April of 1991, and I didn't
see it.  To my knowledge there were no reviews posted on it.  In
mid-December RICH GIRL came to video and that's when I saw it.</P>
<P>      I really enjoyed RICH GIRL and feel that it is a very good film.
The acting in the film is good and the plot is somewhat original, but
very enjoyable.  The comedy comes in small bursts around the romantic
moments in the film.  RICH GIRL has a good rock soundtrack.</P>
<P>      RICH GIRL is sort of like a reverse roll PRETTY WOMAN where Jill
Schoelen is the rich person (like Richard Gere in PRETTY WOMAN) and Don
Michael Paul is the poor one with little schooling (like Julia Roberts
in PRETTY WOMAN).  RICH GIRL is not quite as good as PRETTY WOMAN.  The
video box cover for RICH GIRL also seems to resemble the video box cover
for PRETTY WOMAN.</P>
<P>      For some reason RICH GIRL was not very popular in the theaters,
which I can't understand.  I don't think that RICH GIRL came to any
theaters in my area.  The reason that I know when RICH GIRL was in the
theaters is because I was on vacation in Washington D.C.  and there were
ads for the film on the sides of most of the MetroBuses there.  Most
video stores will only get one or two copies (mine got one), which means
that some people won't even give it a chance.  Don't be one of those
people.</P>

<P>[Moderator's note:  Ken is right; there were no reviews.  The February
1992 PREMIERE magazine discusses it (among other films) as having
suffered from an incredibly bad publicity campaign.  The posters were so
obscure that no one had any idea what the picture was about, and hence
no interest was generated.]
