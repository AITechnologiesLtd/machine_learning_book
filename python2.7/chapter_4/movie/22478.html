<PRE>THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY</PRE>
<P>I frequently twist my son's arm to go with me to an early show. We normally
seat one seat apart. As the show progresses, if the movie is boring me  I
lean hard across the empty seat and whisper in his ear, more or less after
the priest's sick mother in THE EXORCIST: `Son, why you do this to me? Why
you brought me here?'</P>

<P>Have you ever received a trivial present that is beautifully wrapped? Italy
is a spectacular place to photograph.</P>
<PRE>or</PRE>
<P>a well directed movie does not have to be good.</P>
<P>At The Talented Mr. Ripley I watched a shipping tycoon engage a poor young
man to go to Italy to persuade his son to return to New York. Then I watched
the young man stage the circumstances of his meeting with the mark and his
girl friend, and then I watched them be rich and lazy and grow friendly. In
the process I watched the poor young man share and get to like the good
life, conspiring with the rich playboy to deceive the father while not fully
acknowledging his deceptions to the son. Fill in a few similarly pedestrian
details and that is not a synopsis but all that happens in this movie for
about an hour. Fascinating? Hardly.  Son, why you do this to me?</P>
<P>The plot of The Talented Mr. Ripley is standard
murder-followed-by-assumed-identity fare with the usual hazards of inquiring
police and navigating between identities to avoid the usual contrived
perils. Of course in order to give novelist Patricia Highsmith a plot for 5
books and director Anthony Minghella a movie, the character stupidly stays
within reach of all who knew one or the other of his identities and they
keep bumping into him at inconvenient times. Yawn.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why the movie fails as intelligent entertainment is that
this kind of deception would be impossible to maintain while functioning in
the environment of the previous identity; and the resort to serial killings
does not overcome the objection. The plot is predicated on a transparent
contrivance which is unimaginative and unoriginal to boot, therefore
reducing the movie to ordinary, forgettable fare. Why you do this to me?</P>
<P>Matt Damon manages to get some measure of your support for his nefarious
plots, which means that he did a competent job of playing his part. A little
more make-up for the close-ups might have helped to conceal his bad facial
skin. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely as ever. Although her part was paltry
(ouch!) she had two strong scenes which were the acting highlights of the
movie. Cate Blanchett's acting skills were pretty much wasted in a smallish
part, although she did a conscientious job of getting into the mental set of
her character. The part of an irresponsible rich playboy is well played by
Jude Law, except for the fact that when the Paltrow character tells us that
he was also charismatic we just have to take her on faith, which according
to the apostle Paul is the manifestation of things not seen.</P>
<P>Did I wonder sometimes how the writer would get him out of one or another
predicament? Of course; am I not human? Do I not bleed if you cut me? They
did throw me some bones, but not the Monaco cut. Nor the New York strip for
that matter.</P>
<P>A 2 star movie which is well photographed and well directed deserves another
1/2 star (out of 5).</P>
