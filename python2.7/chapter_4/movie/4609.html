<PRE>                               URANUS (1991)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>URANUS *** (France, 1991) Directed by Claude Berri.  Adapted 
by Berri and Arlette Langmann from the novel by Marcel Ayme. 
Cast: Gerard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Pierre Marielle, 
Michel Blanc, Gerard Desarthe, Michel Galabru, et al.  A 
Prestige-Miramax release. 100 min. French with subtitles. Not 
rated.(might be PG for language) </P>
<P>The career of hugely talented and prolific writer Marcel Ayme 
took him from irony to mordant satire to scorn and black-humor 
sarcasm. During the German Occupation of France, Ayme wrote 
for some Vichy weeklies, including the notoriously 
anti-semitic "Je Suis Partout." </P>
<P>With the liberation of France came the settling of accounts, 
as some 4,500 collaborators  (real,suspected or imagined) were 
killed by the Resistance,that is, by genuine or fictitious or 
eleventh-hour "patriots". Later, in more formal purges some 
125,000 people were tried, 38,000 received prison sentences 
and 764 death sentences, as traitors or collaborators. </P>
<P>Although not found guilty of collusion with the enemy, Ayme 
was under a cloud. But he was also vehemently indignant at the 
hypocrisies and excesses of the purges which, it is a sad 
fact, only too often were a means of exacting petty personal 
revenge or settling scores. Films like HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR and 
THE SORROW AND THE PITY have illustrated those 
rush-to-judgment tendencies. The prevailing climate pre-echoed 
at times  the  American naming of names and  guilt by 
suspicion of the HUAC and McCarthy days. </P>
<P>Ayme was particularly vexed by the  ascendance of the 
Communists, who became most influential as they claimed to 
have been the pure body, heart and soul of the Resistance. 
Much of that was true, as were many of the accusations flung 
at collaborators. But as it often happens in democratic times 
of retaliation, reinless injustice can also reign -- and 
that's certainly not an exclusivity in the France of the 
mid-1940s. </P>
<P>Ayme published his novel URANUS in 1948 as his own settling of 
scores with the (in his view) false patriots and opportunistic 
(or misguided) Communists. His setting was a bombed-out town 
where, as elsewhere, many had guilty pasts yet all protested 
their purity, claiming to have been  Resistants, or denying 
collaboration. Ayme populated his stage with the spectrum of 
political pollution, from civilians to returning POWs to  
boot-licking officials.</P>
<P>Claude Berri (JEAN DE FLORETTE, MANON OF THE SPRING) and his 
sister have adapted as well as they could  Ayme's shortish but 
dense and complex book. Inevitably, cuts, condensations and 
simplifications had to be performed,  but the main characters 
are present and  played by a Who's Who of French 
stage-and-screen actors : loving, humanist professor Watrin 
,an Anatole France-like creation (Noiret); engineer Archambaud 
(Marielle) a cynical chameleon who, however, hides at great 
risk a wanted French Nazi ; the fugitive Loin (Desarthe) who 
faces death, yet has the odd "nobility" of sticking to his 
beliefs; still-thriving and still sickening black-market 
tycoon Monglat (Galabru); decent Communist Gaigneux (Blanc) 
whose family is billeted in Archambaud's apartment; bar-owner 
Leopold (Depardieu), a smalltime collaborator and  
black-marketeer, now a scapegoat for the Communists; and 
others. </P>
<P>The inevitable loss in the transfer is palliated by the fact 
that Ayme --also a scenarist and playwright-- wrote striking, 
easily adaptable dialogue. Both story and dialogue have a kind 
of furious immediacy that comes from Ayme writing while events 
were still hot. A scriptwriter originating this in the 1990's 
couls never sound so authentic.  The text's humorous, 
sarcastic narration (which, oddly, sometimes reminds me of  
Dave Barry's devices) is gone however. It finds a modicum of 
equivalence in sounds and images, especially in the original 
creation of the mountainous, extroverted, alcoholic Leopold, 
whom Depardieu hams to the hilt. He wears a little Hitler 
mustache and is, heart and mind,totaly enraptured by his 
newfound love,the neo-classic,alexandrine verses of Racine's 
play ANDROMAQUE. </P>
<P>The performers, even when they underplay, are mostly in the 
old French tradition of larger-than-life, rhetorical 
speakers--which  ought to  please those who miss grand screen 
dialogue. The production values are impressive in their 
precise reconstruction of a period, with its sights, sounds, 
artifacts and ruins. And the moral lesson is universal. </P>
