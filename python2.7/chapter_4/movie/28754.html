<PRE>THE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Marzieh Meshkini's THE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN (ROOZI KHE ZAN SHODAM) tells 
three short stories, the first touching, the second tragic and the third 
comedic, after which they are briefly brought together.  These simple 
episodes are all admirable but rarely engaging.  And, although the movie 
comes in at a mere 78 minutes, 10 would have sufficed.  After about 3 
minutes, each of the stories has made its rather straightforward point 
quite gracefully.  The next 20 minutes of each adds little other than 
needless reinforcement.</P>
<P>The first story concerns a 9-year-old girl named Hava (Fatemeh Cherag 
Akhar) who is about to lose her freedom and her childhood.  At that age, 
she is required to always be covered in a chador and not play with male 
friends anymore.  Using a stick as a crude sundial to tell when the 
dreaded hour of noon arrives, which will signal the end of her youth, 
she tries her best to enjoy the time she has left.  </P>
<P>The second story, which might be called "Pedal Ahoo Pedal," has Ahoo 
(Shabnam Toloui) in a bicycle race.  As she burns up the road, her 
husband rides alongside her on horseback, divorcing her on the spot with 
the help of a mullah who rides along on another horse.  The mullah, in 
the story's only memorable line, calls her bicycle, "the devil's mount."  
Toloui's acting is exquisite, showing her pain and determination with 
eye expressions alone.</P>
<P>The last story is about a senile grandmother (Azizeh Sedighi) who takes 
a large inheritance and goes on a big shopping spree.  Everything from a 
refrigerator to a bed, all in crates, follows her wheelchair like a 
Werner Herzog designed caravan.  </P>
<P>It's always hard understanding someone else's religion, but the images 
shown of Islam in this picture give one a feeling of sad repression.  
And it is the images alone that stay with you after this film is over.</P>
<P>THE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN runs a surprisingly long feeling 1:17.  The 
film is in Farsi with English subtitles.  It is not rated but would 
probably be a G since there isn't anything offensive.</P>
