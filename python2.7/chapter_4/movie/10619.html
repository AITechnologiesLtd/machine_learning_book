<P>   When a movie is ineptly acted by performers trying to make
sense out of silly dialogue, a director can sometimes excuse
himself by suggesting that his movie is campy.  Camp may or
may not have been writer-director Doug Witkins's motive in
bringing "No Ordinary Love" to the screen, where it apparently
received some favorable reviews by critics in Melbourne,
Australia.  But this work by Witkins, while showing some
promise, is obviously a debut for the man with its risible
situations, convoluted developments, and soap-opera
contrivances.  It may achieve some success in the gay circuit,
having already been introduced to the San Francisco
International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, but while "No
Ordinary Love" will have a regular, commercial screening in
cities like New York, it will probably not entertain much
crossover appeal.</P>
<P>   By bringing together a diversity of characters in one large
house, young people who have little regard for one another's
privacy, Witkins virtually guarantees that their coming
together, so to speak, will produce melodramatic outcomes. 
While its principal character Kevin (Smith Forte) looks like the
model of ethical behavior, he is drawn by circumstances into
predicaments of both criminal and sexual natures.  His
roommates include Wendy (Erika Klein), a punk singer whose
guitar playing frequently disturbs Vince (Koing Kuoch), a
Cambodian on a scholarship.  Vince spends what could be
valuable study time by cross-dressing and virtually asking for
trouble with the local gangbangers who take his habits as a
personal insult.  His other roommates include Andy (Robert
Pecora), a bisexual exotic dancer who could be the model for
New York's Times Square underwear posters; Ben, a tubby
bank teller with a secret stash of cash in the cellar; and
Ramon (Antonio Rosas), a Latino who discovers that his anti-
gay stance may be merely a projection of his own
homosexual desires.  The movie makes use a villainous drunk
Tom (Dan Frank), who either fell or was pushed to his death
early on but whose ghostly presence has an unnerving effect
on the household.</P>
<P>   If the movie works at all, it succeeds as a sendup of TV
soaps.  Stereotypical older women include a bourgeois
mother, Rona (Kathleen Gibson), who is aware that her son is
homosexual but nonetheless expect him to make her a
grandmother; and Ramon's mom, Gloria (Marina Palmier),
who is fooling around with a guy who is young enough to be
her son.  The gamin-like Wendy sums up the wisdom of the
production with her brand of logic: since Wendy loved the
now-deceased Tom; and since Kevin also loved Tom;
therefore Wendy and Kevin should get together.  Q.E.D.  
Ben, the new roommate with an infectious laugh, an
obsession about cleanliness, and some dirty money hidden
under the floorboards, brings amusement to the movie and
Vince evokes sympathy as the heartbroken, babyfaced chap
with a longing for the Latino gangbanger who saved him from
being beaten to death.  </P>
<P>   One suspects that a young Pedro Almodovar had this sort
of account in mind while he was first sketching out his plans. 
"No Ordinary Love" is just that, a blueprint with a pot pourri of
melodramatic elements. Mr. Witkins has his work cut out for
him.  Not Rated.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C) Harvey
