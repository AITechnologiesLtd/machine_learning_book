<P>        John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are in top comedic form in Pushing
Tin, a strange little movie about air traffic controllers.  Directed by
Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Enchanted April), the film is hilarious and
entertaining for the first hour and a half, but slumps into
senselessness for its conclusion.  The characters are well-drawn and
perfectly acted by the cast, and the movie works when it focuses on the
rivalry between the two stars.  But it could have been a great movie if
it had found the right way to end (which would have included no baptism
scenes in a Colorado mountain stream).  It also doesn't have a lot to do
with air traffic controlling -- we get the feeling this story could have
been about stock brokers on Wall Street.  Nonetheless, Pushing Tin has
more charms than annoyances, and is therefore worth a look.</P>
