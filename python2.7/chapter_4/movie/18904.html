<P>There was a late episode from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" which
had the new Enterprise crew rescue Scotty from the old series.  Through
the course of this episode, Scotty gets homesick, and, through the
magic of the holodeck, he visits the bridge of the old Enterprise and
reminisces over a bottle of Romulan ale (or somesuch).</P>
<P>I'm told that this old Enterprise bridge was borrowed from a Star Trek
fan club: the fan club actually went and built the bridge in precise
detail, and Paramount found it easier to rent it than build their own.</P>
<P>I'm surprised this story didn't make it into the documentary,
"Trekkies".  It would have fit in, alongside the stories of the
15-year-old fan whose club is making a movie -- he's doing the special
effects on his PC -- or the dentist who dresses up as a Star Fleet
officer to see his patients (and has his receptionists and assistants
dress in uniform, also).  Or, for that matter, with the Whitewater
juror who came to court every day in her Commander's uniform.  Such is
the energy and zeal being unleashed on things Star Trek by its fans,
and spilling out into the mainstream world.</P>
<P>I have to admit that I can identify an undisclosed number of Star Trek
episodes given only a five-second sample, but not all of them, and
probably not the majority from ST:DS9 or ST:V.  I have never worn
Vulcan ears and remain horrified by the "Q Virus" story from
"Trekkies".  As a more casual fan, seeing all this wackiness from more
ardent fans is a treat:  there's sufficient familiarity with the milieu
to identify with much of the more extreme behavior, and to be surprised
in a good way by the creative ways fan devotion is expressed.  Yes, I
know that Commander Sisko shaved his head and grew a goatee midway
through the series, but would I have imagined that a fan would take the
Sisko action figure, file off its plastic hair and paint a little
goatee on it?</P>
<P>And Star Trek is a positive force, with notions of public service
deeply embedded in its vision of the future (for an interesting
discussion, take a look at this Salon article:
<A HREF="http://www.salonmag.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/index.html">http://www.salonmag.com/ent/movies/feature/1999/06/15/brin_main/index.html</A>).
This moral vision has not been lost on its fans.  The woman who wore
the Commander's uniform to the Whitewater jury, for example, heads up a
local fan club, and her reasoning for wearing the uniform is that the
fan club is dedicated to community service, and what better represents
civic duty than serving on a jury?  The uniform is merely the visible
symbol of this ideal of service.  Indeed, the idea of community service
crops up here and there among the fans highlighted in "Trekkies", from
the aforementioned Commander to the local Klingon crew.  The dentist
who dresses up in uniform is just trying to make his patients feel
better -- the hokey transporter set up over the dentist's chair is
meant to transport the patient away from the root canal procedure.
Overall, Star Trek has been a positive influence, whether as a spark
for individual creativity or as a larger framework for public
consciousness.  There can be worse things than being a Trekkie.</P>
<P>So, is there a real difference between the story of Babe Ruth visiting
sick kids in the hospital and Kate Mulgrew, Capt. Janeway from ST:V,
doing the same?  Both are indulging the passions of their fans, giving
them a chance to feel a bit better in their illnesses.  Baseball and
other sports are more revered and accepted than Star Trek by the
mainstream -- we don't give weird and slightly disgusted looks to
people who know who won the Cy Young in 1966, and we think the guys who
paint their bodies in the team's colors and stand half naked in subzero
weather are just jolly clowns -- but it's just a particular pastime,
hobby or passion.  [A Userfriendly cartoon has nice swipe at this
silly bias:

<P>"Trekkies" is a good documentary, but like most documentaries, it
doesn't get much screen time.  In New York, it's currently playing at
the local 2nd-run movie house (known as the $3-movie theater in a city
where the average ticket is $9) without having actually made it to the
first-run houses.  A pity: it's worth it for both fans and non-fans to
see Trek followers at their most ardent, and see that, while their
behavior may appear kooky or extreme, it's not really a bad thing, all
things considered.</P>
