<P>     With a title that sounds like it belongs to a James Michner novel, 
ALASKA represents the latest children-and-a-cuddly-animal adventure.  As 
such, it includes a raft of requisite stock elements:  the kids are 
brighter and braver than the adults, there's a mammoth natural obstacle 
for them to overcome, and the wildlife they meet is inevitably helpful 
(no need to be afraid of a bear with Reg Powell's cheerful music 
playing).  The problem with this sort of script-by-numbers method of 
screenwriting is that rarely are even the most prominent characters 
invested with any depth or individuality.  ALASKA gives us cardboard 
people who struggle to engage our sympathies on even the most basic 
level.</P>
<P>     Another characteristic of this sort of movie is great 
cinematography.  Tony Westman, ALASKA's director of photography, offers 
up a portfolio of breathtaking, panoramic shots.  Admittedly, it would 
be difficult to mess up the look of a film set in such a gorgeous 
locale, but Westman takes full advantage of his surroundings.  In fact, 
this film is almost more successful as a travelogue than as an adventure 
-- too often, I was paying attention to the background while action was 
taking place in the foreground.  Remove the badly-developed characters 
and silly plot contrivances and film this using the IMAX process, and 
you might have a winner.  </P>
<P>     The story, such as it is, hinges on formulaic situations and 
difficult-to-swallow implausibilities.  Children under 10 might be 
impressed, but anyone who appreciates a degree of complexity in their 
motion picture entertainment will be galled by some of the film makers' 
choices.  There are some involving action sequences that enable the 
viewer to forget, however momentarily, about what got the characters 
into this hard-to-swallow situation.  Unfortunately, these scenes, which 
include riding rapids and climbing mountains, aren't involving enough to 
allow perceptive audience members to forgive the weakness of the linking 
material.</P>
<P>     When ALASKA opens, airplane pilot Jake Barnes (Dirk Benedict) and 
his two children, Jessie (Thora Birch) and Sean (Vincent Kartheiser), 
have moved from Chicago to Alaska following the death of Jake's wife.  
In the "starting over" department, Jake and Jessie are doing okay, but 
Sean misses his old life, going so far as to wish his father had died 
instead of his mother.  Then, one night, while Jake is winging his way 
home, he runs into a storm and crashes somewhere around a peak called 
Devil's Thumb.  When the rescue effort fails to locate him, the two 
intrepid children, accompanied by a baby polar bear cub they save from a 
poacher (Charlton Heston), set out to find Jake.</P>
<P>     One might wonder why an actor of Charlton Heston's status would be 
slumming in this sort of film, especially considering that the only 
other recognizable name is Dirk Benedict, a C-level personality best 
known for roles in TV's BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and THE A-TEAM.  The 
mystery really doesn't run all that deep, however:  the star of epics 
like BEN HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is director Fraser C. Heston's 
father.  </P>
<P>     The two children, Vincent Kartheiser (THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD) 
and Thora Birch (NOW AND THEN), are reasonably fresh faces, although 
both can boast previous screen exposure.  Neither is especially good or 
bad as a performer, although the script challenges their physicality 
more than their acting range.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending 
on your point of view), they are constantly upstaged by their four 
legged companion. </P>
<P>     ALASKA would have been marginally better without the heavy dose of 
Native American mysticism that has been injected into the screenplay.  
The poachers are also an unwanted distraction -- why add human villains 
when the terrain itself is enough of a hazard?  Yet, even had the 
writers trimmed these elements, ALASKA still would have been trapped by 
the confines of a formula-driven genre.  It would be a welcome pleasure 
to witness the results of someone taking a real chance with a movie like 
this.  As such, ALASKA is a lost opportunity.  This film plays it safe, 
and, as a result, will follow the similar-but-better THE AMAZING PANDA 
ADVENTURE on the fast track to the "family" section of the video store.</P>
