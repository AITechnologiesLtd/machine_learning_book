<PRE>                         SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Director Jan De Bont has yet to have a strong script to work with. Look at 
Twister and Speed. But what he's had going for him is a sense of fun in 
directing. Speed was not well received by critics, but the audience thought 
different, and the movie became an instant summer hit. This was rightfully so, 
Speed was a joyride and it was fun. Twister experienced the same from the 
critics and the audience. But Twister was not as fun as Speed, the main 
attraction there was its special effects. Speed 2 has begun to receive the 
warm reviews from the critics and how it will be received by the audience is 
still up in the air. For me though, Speed 2 is just like its older siblings, a 
fun movie that is a joyride and has some spectacular special effects to be 
seen.</P>
<P>Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new boyfriend Alex (Jason Patrick) are at a 
standpoint in their relationship. She's also not too happy about him being on 
"the suicide squad." He has the perfect plan though, a cruise. Geiger (Willem 
Dafoe) is a disgruntled ex-employee on the cruise also. Geiger has planted 
bombs all over the ship and is ready to sink it. But, why would he want to go 
through all this trouble to sink a ship? You'll have to see the film to find 
that out, he actually has two reasons for sinking the ship. Alex, being the 
tough guy he is, stays behind with some trapped cruise-goers to stop the 
madman. Annie stays to try to help Alex out.</P>
<P>How much can happen on a cruise boat? A lot more than can happen on a bus. 
There are fights with fires, fights with a 12-foot propeller, fun with 
grenades, fun on lifeboats, and even an elevator scene.
Sandra Bullock is still as likeable as she was in the original. I was 
pleasantly surprised with Jason Patrick's performance. His character was 
higher likeable and he did an excellent job at playing Alex. Willem Dafoe 
gives a mixed performance as Geiger. Although he is a sick crazed man, his 
character swings too much. Sometimes seeming very intelligent and other times 
acting like an idiot nuthouse.</P>
<P>The action sequences work really well, though they could have been better. I 
often wondered when watching the action sequences, "Who substituted the home 
hand held cam for the real camera?" The cinematographer, Jack Green, used some 
very shaky shots during the action sequences. And instead of showing how much 
chaos is really in the scene, it serves only to frustrate the viewer. The 
opening motorcycle sequence was a little contrived and had a TV feel to it. 
But after that, the action gets up to speed and is of a higher caliber. I 
enjoyed most the propeller sequence and the Cruise vs. Oil Tanker sequence.</P>
<P>The sound in Speed 2 is worth mentioning. The sound is incredible and should 
be seen in a DTS equipped theatre.</P>
<P>Speed 2 is an action movie and makes no other efforts, and that is what makes 
it so enjoyable. If you got a fancy for some tense action then go see Speed 2. 
This film is fun.</P>
