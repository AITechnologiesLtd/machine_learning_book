Reviewed by Dustin Putman, August 3, 2001. </P>
<P>A rare G-rated, live-action Disney movie that could have almost been filmed 
in the 1960s as a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills ("Pollyanna," "The Parent 
Trap"), Garry Marshall's "The Princess Diaries" evokes a time when so-called 
"family films" were completely harmless for all ages, as well as absent of 
bodily function humor. It's almost refreshing, really, to see a movie with no 
coarse language or objectionable material that is able to retain every bit of 
the effectiveness it might have had with a little bit of both of these things. </P>
<P>15-year-old Mia Thermopolis (bright newcomer Anne Hathaway) is a 
frizzy-haired wallflower who is terrible at public speaking and isn't a part 
of the cool crowd at her private San Francisco high school. Aside from her 
infatuation with a jock classmate (Erik Von Detten), Mia is perfectly 
comfortable with her no-name existence, and even has a best friend in the 
equally unconventional Lilly (Heather Matarazzo). When her distant 
grandmother (Julie Andrews), whom she has never seen before, pays a visit, 
she discovers that she is Queen Clarisse Rinaldi of the European country of 
Genovia. Even more, as the only living heir to her now-deceased father, Mia 
is set to become Princess of Genovia. Not exactly the royal type, Mia is 
forced to endure training on how to act and look the part, and must decide 
whether she wants to extend this honor as a lifetime title by the night of an 
impending ball. </P>
<P>Yet another take on the classic story of "Pygmalion," "The Princess Diaries" 
treads in well-worn territory and, thus, is neither surprising nor original. 
It is a charmer, however, and coasts on this simple quality for the entirety 
of its overlong 115-minute running time. About as innocent as a beach movie 
starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, the film is good-natured and 
sprightly, with just enough energy to also work as a particularly funny 
comedy. </P>
<P>Veteran actress and singer Julie Andrews, in her first starring role in over 
a decade, may add a touch of class to the proceedings as Mia's loving 
grandmother, but it is Anne Hathaway, in her film debut, who is the real star 
of the show. Hyped by director Garry Marshall as the next Julia Roberts (who 
shot to fame herself with Marshall's 1990 romance, "Pretty Woman"), Hathaway 
has a natural talent for both physical comedy and human drama, and the 
personal issues she struggles with are realistically brought to life. A 
genuinely likable presence, Hathaway definitely has what it takes to be a 
huge star. </P>
<P>Surrounding Andrews and Hathaway with varying degrees of success are a large 
supporting cast of familiar faces. Hector Elizondo (1999's "Runaway Bride" 
and Marshall regular) has a nice, little role as the Queen's tender-hearted 
limo driver, while Heather Matarazzo (best known for 1996's "Welcome to the 
Dollhouse") makes an impression as Mia's friend, Lilly. Pop singer Mandy 
Moore, as Mia's stuck-up classmate, Lana, makes Selma Blair in the recent 
"Legally Blonde" look like an absolute angel in comparison. Moore does fine 
with what she's given, and even has a fun scene in which she gets to sing, 
but her character has zero redeeming qualities. </P>
<P>Where "The Princess Diaries" falters is in the mixed messages it sends out to 
viewers. After Mia's obligatory makeover scene, her long, frizzy hair is 
trimmed down and straightened, and she replaces her glasses with contacts. 
After "becoming" beautiful, her popularity at school skyrockets and she is 
meant to look more like a Princess. Mia's makeover doesn't work, because (1) 
it doesn't stay true to her character's admirable, individualistic attitudes, 
and (2) it falsely tells impressionistic young audience members what the 
word, "beautiful," is supposed to mean. This entire plot point should have 
been extracted in the early screenplay stage, and the movie would have been 
stronger for it. </P>
<P>Flaws aside, "The Princess Diaries" is an enjoyably featherweight piece of 
fluff that does a good job of creating a motion picture exemplary for all age 
groups. Glossy and picturesquely photographed by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, 
painting San Francisco as a beautiful place to visit, the movie is 
entertaining, light-hearted, and maybe even a little wise. For all of its 
missteps in trying to portray what is conventionally attractive, it does have 
a lot to say about staying true to one's beliefs and dreams. Not exactly an 
innovative notion, but a good one, all the same. </P>
