<PRE>                               OLIVIER, OLIVIER
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Agnieszka Holland
Based on events of a true story
Stars a French cast
Rated (R)</PRE>
<PRE>     This is a very special film.</PRE>
<P>     You will see it at the video shop and think it is a romance or
maybe something on a subject you would like to avoid.</P>
<P>     Actually it's about *a lot* of subjects you would like to avoid
and that is why is a very special film.</P>
<P>     It is about the secret rituals of childhood too.  And in one
wonderful scene (a bit reminiscent of THE REFLECTING SKIN) there is
this image of pain and loss and grieving which may stay with you
forever.  Because these images are so powerful, I will not describe
them further.</P>
<P>     I have written about the work of this director before.  Agnieszka
Holland also did EUROPA, EUROPA and THE SECRET GARDEN.  Here, as in
EUROPA, there are deceptions and revelations, posings and discoveries.</P>
<P>     Olivier is a little boy who becomes missing.  After six years of
grieving and pain a teenage boy comes into the lives of his parents and
his slightly older sister, Elizabeth.</P>
<P>     Somewhat like the way that a stranger changes the lives of the
characters in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, here in OLIVIER we see a
marvelous and disturbing example of that quote from DEGREES:</P>
<PRE>                "Each person is a door into another
                 universe: six degrees of separation
                 between you and everyone else on the
                 planet."</PRE>
<P>     In OLIVIER that door reveals all in the end.  And it is well worth
your viewing time to get there.</P>
