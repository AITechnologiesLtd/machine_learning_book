<PRE>Quest for Camelot (G) * 1/2
Featuring the voices of Cary Elwes, Eric Idle
Directed by Frederik Du Chau
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>I challenge any film reviewer to find an animated film that is more sickeningly
bad, predictable, and stupidly sappy than this one. The winner (if one finds a
film worse than this) will receive the chance to remove this movie from all
video shelves across America.</P>
<P>Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) has always dreamed of becoming a knight of the round
table just like her father Sir Lionel (Gabriel Bryne) so when the evil Ruber
(Gary Oldman, who's character is scarier than he is) has his Griffin steal
Excalibur, he plans to rule all, but the Griffin drops it in the "Forbidden
Forest."</P>
<P>Kayley runs away from her mother (Jane Seymour) to find the famed sword where
she meets up with a blind man (Elwes) who has magically lived his entire life
in the forest alone with a falcon that helps him see.</P>
<P>Throw in a two-headed wisecracking dragon and you've got probably one of the
worst family films ever made. Never mind that the animation is pretty, and
Kayley always remains pretty and clean throughout the entire movie, this is
just plain bad material (that doesn't deserve this long of a review) and for
that I give it a paltry * 1/2 stars.</P>
