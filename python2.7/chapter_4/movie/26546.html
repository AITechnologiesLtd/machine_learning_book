<P>    DR. T & THE WOMEN kicks off with one of those trademarked Robert
Altman sequences of choreographed cacophany. We're in the waiting room of
Dallas OB/GYN Dr. Sullivan "Sully" Travis (Richard Gere) -- known to all
simpy as Dr. T -- where head nurse Carolyn (Shelley Long) tries to
maintain order despite a swarm of patients waiting long past their spot on
the doctor's overbooked schedule. It's a brilliantly economical way to set
up a potentially fascinating protagonist. Dr. T loves women so much (in a
purely spiritual, madonna-half of the whole madonna/whore thing sort of
way) that he just can't say no to any of them. The women love Dr. T so
much that they're willing to endure tremendous inconvenience for his
personalized stirrup-side manner. What a great character to study: a man
who idealizes women in a cultural setting -- upper-class Southerners --
where plenty of the women are just fine with being idealized.</P>
<P>     Only two things from that waiting room sequence forward keep DR. T &
THE WOMEN from being a provocative movie experience: Richard Gere, and
just about everything else. Altman's film itself is as tumultuous and
unfocused as Dr. T's life in the film, which starts getting complicated
when his wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett) has a mental breakdown and is placed
in a psychiatric hospital. Kate's illness coincides with preparations for
the wedding of the Travis's oldest daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), as well
as an extended stay by Kate's sister Peggy (Laura Dern) and her three
little girls. And to make matters even more unstable, there's the new
country club golf pro named Bree (Helen Hunt), who turns Dr. T's head with
her unique independent streak.</P>
<P>     Altman and screenwriter Anne Rapp make a huge mistake early on when
they define Kate's rare condition, and along with it Dr. T's own character
flaw. He's a man who loves too much, we learn, giving the women in his
life absolutely everything because he delights in being their guardian,
and scarcely even sees them as flesh and bone. This Act One diagnosis
underlines every action Dr. T makes for the viewer's benefit: ah, note is
instinctively sexist-gallant attempts to do everything for Bree! And note
further how he seems smitten by her insistence on taking charge!</P>
<P>     You'd think it might underline things a bit for Dr. T himself,
especially since he gets the dialogue explaining his wife's condition.
Instead, he spends the next several days of story time in a
well-intentioned fog, manifested in Gere's beatifically squinting
countenance. Gere has never been one of our more subtle actors, but here
he simply refuses to give Dr. T's pathological sanctification of women any
edge. Altman and Rapp let him off the hook by implicitly suggesting he's
just a man tossed about by the forces of estrogen rathern than an example
of a particularly unhealthy attitude. And it doesn't help that almost
every one of the film's dozen or so female characters is written as a
cartoon -- Dern as the champagne-swilling, unhappily married belle; 
Janine Turner as a pushy hypochondriac; Tara Reid as Dr. T's conspiracy
buff younger daughter -- making it even easier to see the befuddled Dr. T
as the victim rather than part of the problem.</P>
<P>     This misguided characterization reaches its peak during a late
revelation about the personal life of one of Dr. T's family members. It
should have been an opportunity to let Dr. T's true colors emerge, to show
him rocked by the notion that women aren't all what he believes them to
be. Instead, it's a cheap opportunity to make him almost absurdly
sensitive and understanding, when understanding is so clearly what he
lacks. DR. T & THE WOMEN flirts with the kind of symbolism and narrative
complexity that can make it seem deep -- be sure to bring an abacus to
count the number of connections between water and female sexuality -- but
it's actually terribly shallow where it counts. Without an actor willing
to make Dr. T a sexist anachronism in need of some self-awareness, the
film is reduced to a two-hour exhibition of limp farce. How depressing to
see that wonderfully evocative waiting room turned into the place where
the big payoff is someone getting tripped and banging her head on a coffee
table.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 female troubles:  4.</PRE>
