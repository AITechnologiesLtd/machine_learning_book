Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</PRE>
<P>     You will not find many family films which radiate the fundamental
warmth and decency that FLY AWAY HOME does, and somehow that makes it more
disappointing that it is not a better film.  It is a story with an
agreeably casual demeanor, positive messages to spare, and virtually
nothing which could give offense (except for a pair of gratuitous
profanities included in a calculated effort to avoid a "G" rating).  Yet
FLY AWAY HOME rarely manages to make the leap from agreeable to genuinely
involving.  In an era where most films seem to be striving to deafen you,
FLY AWAY HOME is a film so soft-spoken it may cause a run on the theater's
assisted listening devices.</P>
<P>     Based on a true story, FLY AWAY HOME tells of 13-year-old Amy Alden
(Anna Paquin), a child of divorce who returns to live in Ontario with her
father Tom (Jeff Daniels) after the death of her mother.  The two have
trouble re-connecting after a decade apart, leaving Amy rather lonely.
She finds unexpected companionship after she discovers a goose nest
orphaned after a tractor plows through, and she cares for the eggs until
they hatch.  The result is a dozen goslings who imprint on Amy, believing
her to be their mother.  The problem is that the geese will need someone
to teach them their southward migration route, leading artist and inventor
Tom to consider a unique solution:  teach Amy to fly an ultra-light
aircraft so that she can guide her geese to their winter home in North
Carolina.</P>
<P>     I don't think that anyone will argue that the first half of FLY AWAY
HOME is not simply lovely.  Director Carroll Ballard (THE BLACK STALLION)
inspires confidence in where he is likely to take us with a a credit
sequence in which the car accident which claims the life of Amy's mother
(after this film and BOGUS in consecutive weeks, will any child be willing
to let his mother drive again?) is given a mournful weight.  The sparkling
cinematography, by the gifted Caleb Deschanel, and Mark Isham's
multi-faceted score contribute to the charming scenes of Amy bonding with
her flock, and clever low-angle shots make them more comical.</P>
<P>     As sweet and unassuming as those scenes are, it soon becomes clear
that there isn't much going on beneath the surface of FLY AWAY HOME.  On
the one hand, it is refreshing that we are not beaten over the head with
the metaphorical significance of Amy's attachment to her avian orphans, or
with weepy professions of father-daughter love after the obligatory period
of estrangement.  On the other hand, Robert Rodat and Vince McKewen don't
give their characters enough substance, and the nominal family drama of
FLY AWAY home is muted by the absence of enough early scenes showing us
Amy's difficulty adjusting to her new circumstances.  Amy tells us that
school was terrible, but we don't see her experiencing any troubles; Tom
pays little attention to her, but we don't see how that affects her.  Jeff
Daniels, Dana Delany (as Tom's girlfriend) and Terry Kinney (as Tom's
brother) all do perfectly nice work, but the characters lack spark, and
the story lacks the drama to accommodate their one-dimensional benevolence.
It is almost as though Anna Paquin, still possessing the spooky detachment
of THE PIANO even with the nose ring she sports in the film's second half,
infects the entire production with her preternatural serenity.</P>
<P>     The first half of the film does include a nominal villain, a fish and
game warden (Jeremy Ratchford) who is made into a nastier character than
he needed to be when he threatens the geese with pinioning; the second
half tries to make up for the lack of conflict by including a handful of
potential heavies, including sport hunters, real estate developers, and
even the U. S. military.  There are some fanciful moments during that
flight, including Amy's late-night surprise at a military airfield, but
other episodes serve little purpose, and the film drags a bit as it
approaches its conclusion.  None of this is likely to matter tremendously
to young viewers, who will enjoy the adorable geese, and their parents,
who will welcome the fundamental warmth and decency which they haven't
seen nearly enough of.  I just couldn't help wishing that FLY AWAY HOME,
although it was based on a true story, had been pitched a bit less like a
matter-of-fact documentary and allowed the conflict between Amy and Tom to
matter a bit more.  On the one occasion where Amy actually raises her
voice, it is quite startling.  Perhaps a few more voices could have been
raised.</P>
