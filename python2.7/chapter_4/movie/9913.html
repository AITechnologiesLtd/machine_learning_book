                  MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL</PRE>
<P>Do not let the title fool you.   It could lead you to believe  this
was going to be one of the surreal films with corpses rising out of
graves.   Not at all . . . or at least only occasionally spooky.
Instead this is a tensely entertaining film about a murder and a
trial.   The acting by everyone is absolutely superb.   Good story
and great acting; what else could one ask for?</P>
<P>Based quite loosely on John Berendt's recounting of a murder in
Savannah, it will hold you in its grip from beginning to end.   John
Kelso (John Cusack) is a journalist who is sent by TOWN AND COUNTRY
magazine to cover a Christmas party given at the beautiful Savannah
home of wealthy, famous Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey) who is a
collector, an antique dealer, a restorer of 18th and 19th Century
homes.</P>
<P>What should have been a routine assignment for Kelso who would just
have to take notes on the lavishness of  the party, record who in
Georgia society attended, and other such trivia finds himself in a
room with Williams discussing the party.   Into  this room bursts
Billy Hanson (Jude Law), an obvious hustler who shouts at Williams,
knocks over an expensive antique grandfather clock and hurls threats
before he leaves in a state of drunkenness or excessive drugs.
All this is witnessed by the  journalist to whom it is obvious that
Billy lives with Williams as his lover.</P>
<P>When, a short while later, Williams shoots and kills Billy, (in
self-defense, he claims) the movie turns dark.   Williams is
arrested but because he is a prestigious member of Savannah society
he expects to be released at once on his own recognizance.  That
does not happen that quickly because the investigators have lots of
questions about Williams' version of what happened.</P>
<P>In a nice twist of irony, the film concludes exactly right.</P>
<P>Just about everyone in the cast is superb, from Cusack as the young
journalist, to Spacey, haughty, dignified, self-assured.   An
exceptionally able performance is given by Jack Thompson who plays
Sonny Seiler, Williams' defense attorney.</P>
<P>Special mention must be made of the transvestite known as The Lady
Chablis who is played by Chablis Deveau (a transvestite in real
life)  who provides both humor and pathos to the film, dominating
many of the scenes.  Add to the cast, Minerva, (Irma P. Hall) like a
one-woman Greek oracle who keeps popping up every now and then with
some pithy remark.  It was she who stole the film A FAMILY THING
with her performance in 1996.    Lastly, there is the entirely
unnecessary "love interest" played by Alison Eastwood who just
happens to be Clint Eastwood's daughter.</P>
<P>Do not expect the film to be faithful to the book.  See it on its
own merits which are plentiful.</P>
<PRE>                     Directed by Clint Eastwood.</PRE>
