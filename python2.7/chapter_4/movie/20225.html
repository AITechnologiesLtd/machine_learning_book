<PRE>Gimme Shelter (1970)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 69</PRE>
<P>In late 1969, the Rolling Stones headlined a
free concert at the Altamont Speedway, located
outside San Francisco.  It was billed as the
Western Woodstock, in comparison to the legendary
music festival held just a few months before.</P>
<P>And the two concerts had many things in common.
Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead performed
at both, there were hundreds of thousands of
fans in attendance, illicit drugs were rampant,
there was disorganization and transportation problems,
and many fans decided that they would enjoy the
concert more if they took off all their clothes.</P>
<P>But there was a significant difference between
Woodstock and Altamont: violence.  Whatever faults
Woodstock may have had, it was peaceful.  There
were four deaths at Altamont, including a gun-waving
fanatic stabbed and beaten to death by Hell's Angels.</P>
<P>The violence begins when the Stones arrive for the
concert.  Mick Jagger is punched in the jaw by
a crazed hippie before he can reach his trailer.
Even during the warm-up acts, the Hell's Angels,
foolishly hired as security, are clubbing concert
attendees, especially those rushing the stage or
messing with their motorcycles.  Airplane lead singer
Marty Balin is mistakenly assaulted by a Hell's Angel.
By the time the Stones are performing, there is a
constant melee in front of the stage, causing Jagger
to break off singing to plead uselessly for an end
to the fighting.</P>
<P>This story is jumbled with other scenes involving
the Rolling Stones.  We see them leaving their room
at a dumpy Holiday Inn (these guys needed better
managers), watch them listen with dazed expressions
to playbacks from upcoming album "Sticky Fingers",
and watch them watch themselves on monitors,
post-concert.  Jagger and drummer Charlie Watts
do the talking, guitarist Keith Richards and the
others are mostly seen smoking cigarettes or
playing onstage.</P>
<P>Among the concert performers is Tina Turner, who
treats her microphone like a giant phalanx symbol.
Among the many cameramen, some of whom were themselves
assaulted, was a young George Lucas.</P>
