<PRE>She's All That</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>She's All That is a teen version of My Fair Lady. I'm not a teen, so I
didn't expect to like it -- surprisingly, I didn't hate it. In fact, I very
much enjoyed this very rich scene in which, GQ-prep Freddie Prinze Jr., is
forced to improv at an avant-garde poetry/performance "event" (presented
tongue-in-cheek). For the first time in his life he's unprepared, slightly
intimidated, and liking it. He drops a bean bag on his foot: "Hack-e-Sack,
Don't let it drop. Hack-e-sack, Don't let it drop." As he juggles the sack
with his feet and repeats the line to dizzying background projections, his
character conflict is subtly and cleverly revealed.</P>
<P>After being dumped by blonde cheerleader and prom queen shoe-in, Freddie
bets his best bud that his mere presence can convert any woman into a prom
queen. The bud chooses Rachael Leigh Cook ... the dorkiest art geek he could
find. Personally, I don't think he tried too hard, even with glasses Cook is
still pretty cute. From then on, Freddie moves in on Rachael attempting to
glamorize her with his popularity.</P>
<P>Cook's father, a pool guy, is a warm and wonderful side character. I
particularly like a scene in which he talks back to the TV during Jeopardy,
"Which Medieval printer copied the Bible without using his name?" Alex asks.
Cook's Father replies... "Hewlett Packard." That's funny.</P>
<P>If you're a teen and you like MTV's The Real World, I think you might enjoy
this picture. If you're not a teen, there's probably better pictures out
there for you.</P>
<PRE>Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook.
Directed by Robert Iscove.
Rated PG-13.</PRE>
<P>Grade..........................Teens: B+, Non-Teens: C</P>
