<PRE>                                 ASSASSINS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Okay, I admit it.  I was expecting something horrible like JUDGE
DREDD when I sat down for ASSASSINS.  Instead, imagine my surprise to
find a nicely-crafted action thriller that does *not* feature Sylvester
Stallone making a bunch of "witty" remarks.</P>
<P>     ASSASSINS is essentially an updating of a well-established story
line.  Robert Rath (Stallone) is the best in the world at what he
does--killing people for money.  But he's getting tired of it all and
wants out of the business.  Unfortunately, you can't just give two
weeks notice to your faceless hit contractor; it's a bit more difficult
than that.  So it's understandable that Rath barely flinches when he
finds out Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), the #2 assassin, is after
him.</P>
<P>     When you throw into the mix the world's best actress (Julianne
Moore) as Electra, a surveillance expert and electronic thief, all hell
breaks loose.  Electra is his latest "mark," and, fed up with
everything, Rath elects not to kill her, as he was charged to do.
Instead they team together against a new, common enemy:  Bain, who
Banderas brings to life with a soul of pure evil.</P>
<P>     ASSASSINS starts out a little slow in setting up this tricky web,
but it pays off the first time Bain and Rath meet.  Thereafter, each
meeting grows progressively more intense--and more violent--as the two
square off like fighting lions.  These action sequences are some of the
best of the year, and together with Moore's turn as the enigmatic
Electra, ASSASSINS develops into a great entry for its genre.</P>
<P>     Yes, there are some cheap "dog-barks-suddenly" surprises, a few
sappy and overdramatic moments, and the story is just on the other side
of impossibility, but what the hell, it's an action movie, right?  That
it is, and it's a pretty good one to boot.</P>
