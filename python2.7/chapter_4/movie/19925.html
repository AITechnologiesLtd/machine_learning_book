<P>     "Dick" is a very funny 95-cent idea diluted by inflation to a
buck and a half.  There are good jokes and performances, but it's
essentially sketch humor stretched out to fill feature requirements.
The goodwill purchased by the early laughs goes a long way toward
carrying the flat stretches.  Eventually, though, there's no avoiding
the fact that things have run aground.  There's a noticeable gap in
amusement, and it extends beyond the legendary 18-1/2 minutes.
     Despite the fact that the central characters are a couple of
teenage girls, the appeal of "Dick" will be primarily to those old
enough to appreciate the minutia of Watergate trivia; if plumbers,
duct tape, and Rosemary Woods and the 18-1/2 minute gap mean nothing
to you, parts of this movie will be as impenetrable as puns in
Chinese.
     Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) are
teenyboppers in Washington DC with a serious thing for Bobby Sherman
(if you're under thirty-five I'm already losing you.)  When they sneak
out of Arlene's Watergate apartment at midnight to post a letter to
the pop idol's fan club, they tape a door to the building's garage for
purposes of re-entry.  At the same time a third-rate burglary is in
progress at the Democratic National Committee offices upstairs.  When
a security guard finds the taped lock he calls the cops, and sets in
motion the irresistible tide of events that will eventually sweep
Richard M.  Nixon from office.
     The girls get separated from their class on a White House tour,
meet the President and his minions, and wind up with a gig as official
dogwalkers for the mutt everyone insists on calling Checkers.  From
this vantage point they have a chance to observe plenty of chicanery
and dirty tricks around the Nixon White House, and even bring in some
specially baked cookies from home that influence world leaders and
events.  They develop a meaningful relationship with Woodward and
Bernstein, and the rest is history, of a sort.
     Dunst and Williams are squealy, girlish fun, but the best of
"Dick" belongs to the man who plays him, Dan Hedaya.  With his hunched
shoulders, bristling eyebrows, and dark jowls he seems born to the
role of Tricky Dick, and he makes Nixon entertaining enough that you
almost want him back again on Watergate's 25th anniversary to kick
around some more.
     "Dick" is uneven satire.  The high points are probably enough to
make the trip worth while, but be prepared for long stretches of
tedium.</P>
