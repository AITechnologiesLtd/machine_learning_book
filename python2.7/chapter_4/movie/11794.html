<PRE>The Newton Boys
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>There are twilight times in history: years where something that was gives way
to what will be. It's rare that individuals living during such a shift
perceive the transformation. Most are too preoccupied with putting food on the
table and a roof over their heads to see the big picture. It takes living on
the fringes of society to visualize the forest.</P>
<P>We seem to be living in one of those times of change now. Fifteen years from
now may be radically different from what we've experienced previously. In the
early years of this century the western United States was undergoing such an
alteration and it took a gang of bank robbers to see it coming.</P>
<P>The Newton brothers began their life of crime in 1919. They successfully
robbed over 80 banks without getting caught and pulled off the largest train
robbery ever at the end of their career in 1924. And they did it all with a
minimum of violence -- no deaths and few injuries.</P>
<P>Based on the exploits of the historical family (during the credits there are
interviews with the boys themselves including an appearance with Johnny
Carson), the film is an interesting study of the developing west. After a
failed daylight holdup that ends with crooks on horseback being chased by the
law in a motorized vehicle, Texan Willis (Matthew McConaughey) Newton realizes
that the days of Jesse James style plundering are over.</P>
<P>Convincing his brothers Joe (Skeet Ulrich), Jesse (Ethan Hawke), Dock
(Vincent D'Onofrio) and explosives expert Brentwood Glasscock (singer Dwight
Yoakam) that the dirt-poor life of sharecroppers is not for them, Willis sets
about modernizing bank robbery. He obtains a list of banks that still have the
older square door safes and, in a stroke of genius, realizes that the best
time to rob them is in the middle of the night when no one is around.</P>
<P>After years of successful crimes, the boys get greedy and go for a mail train
out of Chicago loaded with down with cash. Although they get away with $3
million, this is their fatal mistake. The Feds and Chicago cops are after them
and they're not about to give up.</P>
<P>The movie is too reminiscent of "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid". without
as many entertainment values. There's even a scene with Willis with a glass of
champagne soaking in a bathtub in middle of a fancy hotel room. Later his
girlfriend shoots photos of the guys. Sound familiar? Good buddies doing
crimes politely in the modernizing west with a light-hearted flavor worked
well for the earlier film and those aspects are the highlights in this one.</P>
<P>The film's main audience attraction is its downfall: the boys themselves. As
much appeal as the young men here have for the female gender, they just don't
have the acting chops of Paul Newman or Robert Redford. These actors in "The
Newton Boys" are interchangeable enough that at times it's difficult to
remember which brother is which.</P>
<P>Director Richard Linklater ("Slackers", "Before Sunrise") begins with a
slow-moving delightful western that rambles for too long and eventually grinds
to a halt. By the time that the two hours are up, you'll be wondering if most
of it was filmed in slow motion.</P>
<P>The supporting cast, especially "ER"'s Julianna Margulies as Willis' babe,
are interesting enough to provide some bright spots. Journeying through the
days of 70 years ago is fun but not enough to hold the film together by itself.</P>
<P>The clips at the end from the "Tonight Show" are the highlight of the movie.
That's unfortunate.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 4/2/98 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
