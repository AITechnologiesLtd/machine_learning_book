The Matrix</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it
for yourself," the radio ads drill. But, I can tell you this..."The Matrix"
(the movie) is a winding web of dream vs. reality vs. technological
dictatorship. It snatches you in your slumber, then challenges you to see
the real world as a dream. It won't insult your intelligence; in fact, like
Keanu, you'll spend most of the film trying to figure it out. As for the
rest: saliva will be evaporating from your wide open mouth as your jaw
lowers at the glass-shattering special effects.</P>
<P>I'm not sure why bullets are necessary to battle power-hunger software; but
it sure is cool to watch the empty shells fall to the ground in slow mo.
There are the times when the psychedelic, poetic, philosophic dialogue kind
of bogs up on itself and there's that lull in the second act ... but nothing
that a totally dope butt-woopin' climax can't blast from your memory. Now
that's why we go to see action movies!</P>
<P>The plot/concept is almost intricate enough to make you forget that fighting
technology with Kung Fu is essentially a silly idea. The acting won't steal
the show. It's the careful direction (unique, yet reminiscent of Terry
Gilliam, especially in "10 monkeys") and sensitive, creative use of
remarkable special effects that will burn this film in your memory. Buckle
up!</P>
<P>Starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe
Pantoliano.
Written and Directed by the Wachowski Brothers.
Produced by Joel Silver at Village Roadshow/Grocho II/Warner Brothers.</P>
