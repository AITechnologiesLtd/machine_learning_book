<PRE>                                    EXOTICA
                       A film review by Christopher Null
                        Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     EXOTICA is a new dramatic thriller from Canadian director Atom
Egoyan, who brings us this fascinating glimpse into the life of Francis
Brown (Bruce Greenwood), a Canadian tax auditor whose life intertwines
with a his brother and niece, an exotic animal smuggler, and, most
importantly, the denizens of a strip joint called Exotica.</P>
<P>     The action in EXOTICA jumps from one character to another, from
location to location, and back into Brown's past occasionally, teasing
the viewer with bits of information about how these people's lives are
eventually going to gel into a cohesive story.  As the story
progresses, there are plenty of blanks left for the viewer to fill in
as the action springs around.  The seamless editing makes this seem
natural, albeit a bit overdone at times, but eventually it all comes
together to make perfect sense in the end.</P>
<P>     Thematically, EXOTICA is a dense study of human nature, obsession,
and the difficulties of reconciling our perceptions with reality.
Egoyan's careful braiding of plotlines and characters makes this
reconciliation all the more difficult, but that's the point.  In the
end, the film gives us about five different viewpoints on a single
situation, an admirable effort that not many filmmakers could pull
off.</P>
<P>     EXOTICA is a beautiful sensory feast, studded with lush
cinematography and haunted by an outstanding score.  The sets are
excellent as well, particularly the seductive Exotica club itself.  The
performances are dead-on, especially Greenwood's slightly twisted
accountant and Mia Kirshner as Kristina, the stripper with whom Francis
is obsessed.  The convoluted plot line and rather mature subject matter
may make the film too esoteric for some, but you won't be able to get
EXOTICA out of your mind for days.</P>
