<PRE>                        KIDS IN THE HALL: BRAIN CANDY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Well, what have we here?  Let me say first-off that I'm a *huge* Kids
in the Hall fan.  This review is necessarily going to be tainted by the
fact that I've probably seen 300 hours of Kids in the Hall on TV...and by
my impression going into the film that, hey, another 1 1/2 hours wouldn't
kill me.</P>
<P>     If you aren't familiar with the comedy troupe, the Kids are five guys
(Bruce McCulloch, Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney, Scott Thompson, and Dave
Foley) who have appeared in 110 episodes of some of the funniest sketch
comedy television has offered up in recent years.  After ending the series
in July 1994, talk of a movie immediately began.  Two years later, the end
result is here.</P>
<P>     What the Kids have brought us with BRAIN CANDY is a 90 minute skit
about a drug company and its hapless employees who invent the penultimate
"happy pill," GleeMonex.  The only problem, they later discover, is that
those that take the pill commonly become comatose due to the ecstasy
caused by it...which isn't such a happy result after all.</P>
<P>     Plotline aside, the real question on everyone's mind is, "Is it any
good?"  Well...yes and no.  The Kids have brought back some 40 of our
favorite characters from the show (and some new ones), and their
performances as Canada's most ridiculous citizens are perfectly done.  The
problem, and it's quite a big one, is that the GleeMonex storyline gets
old--fast, although it has a certain charm and does serve to tie the whole
movie together.  In the end, the plot is little more than an arbitrary way
of getting to the funny bits of the script, which rarely have anything to
do with the BRAIN CANDY in question.</P>
<P>     Good characters in a crummy story don't make for particularly good
time, but there are plenty of laughs to be had by all scattered throughout
the film.  You're probably better off just watching three episodes of the
TV show at home, but for die-hard fans, the movie will probably carry at
least some appeal.  Just don't take any pills from strangers.</P>
<P>     (Special note:  *Yes!*  Paul Bellini (the guy in the towel) does
appear in one scene.)</P>
