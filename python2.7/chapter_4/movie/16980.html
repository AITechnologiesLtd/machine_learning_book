<PRE>Patch Adams (1998)
1/2 *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>What an offensive and repellent movie this is.  "Patch Adams" has garnered
praise from audiences everywhere, but that only underscores the idea that no
one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.</P>
<P>Drawn to some extent from a true story, it tells us about a fellow named,
yes, Patch Adams (Robin Williams), who checks into a mental hospital as the
movie starts.  He's suicidal, but he quickly finds that the patients are more
help to him than the doctors are.  A more cynical, knowing movie would have
addressed this by making Patch think, gee, maybe there are people worse off
than me, but instead we're subjected to the dishonest fiction that in the
asylum, it's the doctors who are really the sick ones.</P>
<P>Patch enrolls in medical school and is given the hardline about medicine by
Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton): "We are going to take the humanity out of you and
make you into something BETTER," he intones ominously.        Anyone who has seen
more than two movies in their lifetime will instantly realize that the
Walcott character is being set up for us as a strawman, and that this film is
a stacked deck.</P>
<P>Patch fights back against the "impersonality" of medicine by trying to be
every patient's best friend, a Holy Fool to the invalids.  The only problem
is that he does this by being an unholy pain in the ass.  He puts bedpans on
his feet and tapdances; he cuts off the ends of enema bulbs and sticks them
on his nose; he straps himself to a motorized bed and feigns being thrown
around on it. It's not that any of this stuff is unfunny, but that it's
wrongheaded.  Any doctor started jollying me up like this, I'd phone my HMO.</P>
<P>I said the movie was a stacked deck, and there isn't a scene that doesn't go
towards reinforcing that.  Adams is the free-spirited rebel, the
nonconformist, and everyone who stands in his way is just a stuffed-shirt
with no blood in their veins.  This is neither true nor convincing.  If the
movie had an ounce of honesty, it would show that people who assume the role
of the rebel or nonconformist do not often do it out of altruism or
benevolence, but out of immaturity or the need for attention.  Break a
window, and poof! you're a rebel.</P>
<P>The film's gears are loud and persistent.  Patch has (no!) a Love Interest
(Monica Potter), who serves no purpose in the story except to die at the worst
possible time and throw Patch into a (manufactured) pit of despair from which
he must climb out.  And once he does climb out, there's a giant piece of
speechmaking for him at the end of the movie, where Patch cries out against
modern medicine's cold heart, etc., etc.</P>
<P>This I could have tolerated, but there is one additional piece of shameless
manipulation that left me speechless.  On cue, the doors open, and in come a
whole slew of sick children, chemotherapy patients that Patch gave enema-ball
noses to earlier.  The scene is horribly false in so many ways that I can
barely count them.  One, if those children are as ill as we have been led to
believe, what are they doing out of bed?  And two, isn't this a blatant
ripoff of the equally bogus scene in the equally bogus "Dead Poets Society"
(also a Robin Williams vehicle) where all those kids stand on their desks in
"protest"?</P>
<P>It's one thing to be sentimental, but it's another thing entirely to use
sentimentality in the service of a foolish, exploitive story.  "Patch Adams"
is not a three-hanky movie -- it's a subsidy plan for a Kleenex factory.</P>
