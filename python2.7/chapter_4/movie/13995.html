<PRE>Review: Next Stop Wonderland</PRE>
<P>Starring: Hope Davis, Alan Gelfant, Victor Arag, Jon Benjamin</P>
<PRE>Directed by Brad Anderson</PRE>
<P>There are some truly funny lines in Next Stop Wonderland that are caught
up in a battle with forced, trendy screenwriting. It is hard to tell
which comes out on top, and it only manages to provide some likable
characters in an all-too-familiar situation. Erin (Davis) is a young
woman who is shattered when her goofy, activist boyfriend leaves her
because she doesn't support him. She then goes on a quest to meet Mr.
Right by way of her mother placing a personal add against her will. Erin
reluctantly ventures out into the singles world, makes headway, and
eventually starts making sport of the situation. </P>
<P>The film bounces back and forth between two characters who never meet.
Alan, a plumber who is working his way through school to become a marine
biologist, is also not burning up the dating scene. The film is utterly
predictable. We know all along that these two lonley souls are meant for
each other, though they seem unable to meet. Sadly, most of Alan's
screentime is dedicated to the film's subplot of political muscle,
trying to destroy the local aquarium for its prime real estate. It
involves the plans for a mausoleum and killing a balloonfish. Pretty
silly.</P>
<P>The film reminds me quite a bit of Sliding Doors in a number of ways.
Primarily, it deals with fate, Who are we supposed to spend the rest of
our lives with? and, How will we meet this person? There is also some
artsy but jarring camerawork and editing, but it dies down about a half
hour into the film. Strangely, that is when the dialogue perks up.</P>
<P>Next Stop Wonderland is not a very intriguing film, though it has a step
up on the more unique Sliding Doors in that the characters are more
likable. Hope Davis is really a joy to watch. She has a very accessable
beauty that makes the audience care about her, even if she is not being
particularly charming each moment. There are some truly funny lines, but
they are few and far between. Its a story of two people looking for
romance in the wrong places. It has been my contention that Hollywood
has done a poor job with romantic comedies in recent years, with, of
course, a few exceptions. The indie film world has done only slightly
better, but neither side has managed to produce a gem. Next Stop
Wonderland falls short of the mark too.</P>
