<P>Screenplay by Wayne Beach and Simon Davis Barry</P>

<PRE>(THEATER) R 117min</PRE>
<P>The Art of War is a movie that asks the question " How do you give a 
medal to someone who doesn't exist for something that didn't happen?" 
Specifically, it is Donald Sutherland who asks the question. Sutherland 
is the Secretary General of the UN, a post that this movie suggests is 
vaguely pathetic and faintly comical. He is speaking to the UN's head of 
covert operations, Anne Archer, to whom he sometimes plaintively 
suggests that maybe the UN shouldn't be doing this sort of thing. They 
are speaking of Wesley Snipes, the UN action hero who is under such deep 
cover that no one can acknowledge his existence. How anyone can break 
the amount of glass Wesley breaks and stay under deep cover is a matter 
of mystery. This is a man who will not go through the front door of a 
building if he can rappel down its face or crash through a skylight. 
When he does go through the front door, as he does at a diner, it's apt 
to be in a car. He has, quite literally, a chip on his shoulder.</P>
<P>This is neither as good a movie as you might hope, nor as bad as you 
might fear. There are some rousing action sequences, with Snipes showing 
off dazzling martial arts moves. He spends so much time leaping off high 
places he should get frequent flyer miles. There are flurries of clever 
dialogue. But it's a movie that gets lost in its elements, a movie that 
bogs down in a welter of plot and incident and action, a movie that 
ultimately fails because it is all trees and no forest. As the villain 
says, "You, like most people, fail to look at the big picture."</P>
<P>It's a movie built on racial profiling, a movie that believes that if 
you have one good Chinese you can make all the rest of them bad and 
you've covered your bases. You almost expect poor Wen Ho Lee to pop out 
of a closet waving some hard disks. Our good Chinese is Marie Matiko, 
who is Snipes's love interest, and who has something encrusted on her 
nose that you're relieved to discover is a diamond. There's no chemistry 
between them, but the movie comes up with a way of getting her naked 
that may catch on. Fleeing the scene of another explosion in a stolen 
car, Snipes tells her to get undressed. "Take all your clothes off," he 
orders. "How do you think they knew where we were? They've got you 
bugged!" What's a girl to do?</P>
<P>"The Art of War" is an ancient military text by Sun Tsu, who believed in 
winning by destroying the enemy from within. This movie is a step in 
that direction.</P>
