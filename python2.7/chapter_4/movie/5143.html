Rated R (extreme violence, bad language)</P>
<P>Accept no "Substitute." This blackboard jungle movie has almost nothing
to recommend it.</P>
<P>Shale (Tom Berenger) is a mercenary soldier who's just decided to hang
up his Uzi and is visiting in Miami his girlfriend Jane (Diane
Venora).  She teaches in a high school that's like an armed camp  plus a
hotbed of big-time drug dealing. Jane, gutsy and outspoken, incurs the
wrath of the Numero Uno gang-leader who has another male animal break
her leg.</P>
<P>Shale wants to investigate the bad guys, who are legion. As he has
done jobs for the CIA, he knows all about fabricating credentials, or so
we are to believe. Posing as an Ivy Leaguer, he appears at the school
and takes over Jane's class as a substitute.</P>
<P>In the tired old formula, he discerns the humanity in some of the kids,
becomes (natch) liked by them. His methods combine strong-arm
no-nonsense and the pathetic way of speaking to the students in "their"
language, as when he explains the Vietnam War as "the gangs in the North
wanted to take over the gangs in the South." In my book this comes under
the rubric of the Power of Primitive Thinking.</P>
<P>What Shale's investigations uncover is corruption in high places and
low, an industrial-strength drug-ring that extends well beyond the
school, murder and other such niceties. </P>
<P>This leads to the film's real "raison d'etre," and "piece de
resistance," a long, bloody confrontation between the bad guys and the
good. The latter are Shale's motley team of disbanded mercenaries, now
re-recruited in Wild Bunch or Dirty Dozen fashion. The battle is
absurdly unbelievable in its strategies, heroics and high-tech
equipment. </P>
<P>The film is an Equal Opportunity production. The huge majority of the
students are minorities: black, Cuban, Hispanic, Latino, American Indian
-- and since so many of them are gangsters, the portrait of such
minorities is neither P.C. nor kind. Of course there are a few people
who act with honesty and courage, but this feels like tokenism.</P>
<P>This is a cheap exploitation movie that's far cry from the fine "The
Blackboard Jungle" of 1955, the movie whose title became the expression
for delinquent and defiant high schoolers. That film was seen by some
American authorities here, and especially abroad, as showing a most
undesirable slice of US life. I shudder to think what "The Substitute"
's message will be for foreign countries.</P>
<P>While without saving graces, the film has some performers who are better
than their material. Venora sends good vibes in her unglamorous but
appealing small part.  Hudson has presence as the school principal with
a not so secret secret. Teacher Plummer contributes some good
African-American activism.</P>
<P>As for Berenger, in the early days of his career, he was often referred
to as the next Paul Newman. This did not come to pass. He is far from
untalented, but he's been in insignificant movies, with just a few
exceptions: "The Big Chill," "Platoon" (he was Oscar-nominated for Best
Supporting Actor), "Born on the Fourth of July," and the little-seen
"The Field" and "At Play in the Fields of the Lord."</P>
<P>In "Sniper"(1993), Berenger played a military hitman, a terminator of
drug-traffickers in a South American jungle.  It was not a good film,
but if Berenger has to be cast in more action movies, good scripts and
direction could at least make him a hero a la Stallone, minus pectorals,
plus brains.</P>
