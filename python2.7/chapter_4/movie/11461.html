<PRE>Review (c)1998 eric lurio</PRE>
<PRE>Hush</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Jonathan Darby</PRE>
<P>A few decades back, every comedian did what's called a `mother-in-law joke.'
You know the thing about the old battle axe who would make the hero's life
hell. </P>
<P>This is one loooooooonnnng mother-in-law joke.</P>
<P>Helen(Gwyneth Paltrow)  and Jackson (Johnathon Schaech) have been living with
each other for some time, and Jackson decides to take her home to meet mom.
Biiiiiiiiig mistake! </P>
<P>For Mom in this case is a psycho named Martha(Jessica Lange),  every
misogynist's worst nightmare.</P>
<P>She's a clawing, cloying, sarcastic lying bitch with murder on her mind. Lange
has a great time with her and shows that she can chew the scenery with the
best of them.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, Mother-in-law hates her Mother-in-law(Nina Foch) who is
given the best lines. So, of course, she becomes Helen's soulmate and Martha
tries to kill her. </P>
<PRE>Probably for getting the best lines.</PRE>
<P>The problem here is the script. In the words of Norman, patron saint of Movie
Critics, `It Stinks!' You know what's going to happen a mile away. </P>
<P>Gwyneth Paltrow seems lost here. She's been in lots of classy films in the
recent past and doesn't seem to know how she managed to wind up in a cheesy
thriller like this one. </P>
<PRE>Come to think of it, neither do I.</PRE>
