<P>Very similar in style to the film WILD ORCHID ( the first ), it deals with a
woman's adventures in Spain, where she basically comes to grips with her
femininity, if not her real womanhood.</P>
<P>However, what makes this film difficult to follow is the fact that much of
it takes place in the woman's mind, if the ending is any indication
whatsoever.  The whole thing may have not happened at all, although much of
it definitely did happen.</P>
<P>With an outstanding cast, and great music all over, this film moves along
exploring a woman's ability to relate physically to a world
that doesn't think about the physical part of themselves at all, in the
sense that they are not self conscious about it.  And the
American tourist is very self conscious, and many times denies herself
adventures, though her mind allows her to fantasize about
them.</P>
<P>All of the actors in this film look like they are on vacation and enjoying
their roles, which is very much the attitude we usually
pick up of the Spanish people.  The sex is up front, and honest, rather than
discussed in words, or in the mind.  One falls for the
feeling rather than wait for the mind to come along.  And in the end,
although it is clear that this woman's mind has learned much, it
still shows that she is partially trapped in her ideas, and is not capable
of true enjoyment.  The suggestion is that she will
return to America and continue playing games, rather than enjoy herself.</P>
<P>A very good film, and fun to watch, because many times we are not really
sure of what is really happening, only to find that
she was dreaming.  The cutting of the film is fast, and very suggestive, and
the dreamy music helps that mood.</P>
<PRE>VERY GOOD FILM.
GREAT IF YOU LIKE TO FIGURE THEM OUT TYPE OF FILMS.
