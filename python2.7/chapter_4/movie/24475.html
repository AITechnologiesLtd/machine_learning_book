<P>         Every so often, there's a pleasant surprise hiding inside an
unpromising package. Case in point: ``Kissing A Fool,'' which comes
with a laundry list of turn-offs attached to it.</P>
<P>  First off, it was directed and co-written by Doug Ellin,
whose previous film, the excruciating ``Phat Beach,'' was almost as
offensive as a minstrel show. Second, it stars David Schwimmer of TV's
``Friends,'' who didn't exactly set the screen aflame in ``The
Pallbearer.'' Finally, there's that awful title, which calls to mind
George Michael's gooey ballad of the same name.</P>
<P>  But ``Fool'' succeeds both as a look at the competitiveness
lurking underneath many friendships and as an offbeat romantic comedy
that allows Schwimmer to convincingly play against type. One of the
handicaps of ``Pallbearer'' was Schwimmer's by-the-numbers performance
in a role almost identical to his milquetoast Ross on ``Friends.''</P>
<P>  ``Fool'' is something else entirely, as Schwimmer plays Max
Abbitt, an egomaniacal Chicago sportscaster who greets everyone with a
cheerful ``Wuttup?'' and who'd be obnoxious if he weren't so
ridiculous.</P>
<P>  Max is blissfully hedonistic until his considerably more
sensitive best friend Jay (Jason Lee, who has few equals when it comes
to finding humor in misery) introduces him to book editor Sam (Mili
Avital). Following what Jay terms a three-week ``Love Boat'' episode,
Max and Sam are engaged and living together.</P>
<P>  Still nursing a heart shattered by his would-be supermodel
ex-girlfriend Natasha (Vanessa Angel), Jay tries to be happy for his
friend, with only semi-convincing results.</P>
<P>  Starting off as an acidic look at love, ``Fool'' begins as a
variation on ``Chasing Amy,'' which also cast Lee as the guy on the
outside of an affair and which sported the same sort of slightly
grainy/gritty look Ellin has given this film.</P>
<P>  But by its midpoint the movie has somehow reinvented itself
as a quirky romance that recalls, of all things, ``Moonstruck,'' with
Lee as Nicolas Cage, Avital as Cher and Schwimmer as Danny
Aiello. ``Fool'' also incorporates various other colorful characters,
including Sam's bratty cousin (Judy Greer), Max's libidinous co-worker
(Kari Wuhrer) and the much-discussed Natasha, who shows up late in the
game to declare ``I go by Nastassia now'' and to try to reignite Jay's
torch.</P>
<P>  Author John Patrick Shanley graced ``Moonstruck'' with a
magnificent finale that untangled all its plot threads in one
astonishing, hilarious sequence. Ellin isn't a gifted enough writer to
come up with that kind of climax to his story, so ``Fool'' wheezes to
a stop rather than wrapping up with any real punch.</P>
<P>  But that doesn't negate the considerable charms of Avital,
Lee and Schwimmer or the frequent bursts of wit in Ellin's script,
several of which deal with Jay's sappy taste in music. When Max chides
him for wallowing in self-pity while listening to Barry Manilow
albums, Jay protests he wasn't playing Manilow discs: ``That was a
radio special!'' he insists.</P>
