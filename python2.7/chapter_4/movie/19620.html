Susan Granger's review of  "DEEP BLUE SEA" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P> It's "The Poseidon Adventure" meets "Jaws."  Researchers
aboard the floating laboratory Aquatica have come up with an amazing
pharmaceutical discovery. Using mako sharks, they have discovered the
key to regenerating human brain tissue - thus curing Alzheimer's and
other degenerative diseases. Only a doctor has violated ethical codes,
genetically re-engineering DNA, making the experimental specimens
smarter and faster. Suddenly a tropical storm strikes, and chaos
reigns as the scientists are being stalked by the predators. The crew
of this underwater compound, stranded on various submerged levels,
must try to get to the surface - any way they can - as, one by one,
they're chased and attacked. That's the predictable plot concocted by
writers Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers & Wayne Powers. Director Renny
Harlin ("The Long Kiss Goodnight," "Cutthroat Island," "Cliffhanger")
focuses his attention on action and carnage. The sharks are
animatronic with some CG effects, not totally believable, but Harlin
effectively uses the elements of shock and surprise. British actress
Saffron Burrows is a dead-ringer for Harlin's ex-wife, Geena Davis,
and shark-wrangler Thomas Jane resembles Kevin Costner in
"Waterworld."  In the casting process, their looks were obviously more
important than their acting ability. Rapper LL Cool J, as Preacher,
the parrot-loving cook, is the most memorable character, along with
Stellan Skarsgard, the project director, and Samuel L. Jackson as the
financier whose company supports Aquatica. Of course, what you're
wondering is: who will survive? On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Deep Blue Sea" is a shallow yet scary 6. It's a monster movie that
will have you dreading water.</P>
