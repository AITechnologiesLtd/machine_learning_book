Pushing Tin</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Nice take off and landing, but the flight was rather uneventful. "Pushing
Tin" pits John Cusack against Billy Bob Thornton one-upping each other for
top air-comptroller status. The ego-dual isn't enough to move the plot
along, so wives get involved; changing the feel of the film from the air to
a worldly soap opera.</P>
<P>The two hot shots bump heads until one of them breaks. From there the
development of the relationship jumps a few thousand feet rather abruptly.</P>
<P>"Pushing Tin," sporting great dialogue, is very well acted. It's tense techy
setting is promising, but the meat of the movie seemed rather inharmonious
with it's dazzling slices of beginning and end.</P>
<P>Starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett and Angelina
Jolie.
Directed by Mike Newell. Screenplay by Glen Charles and Les Charles.
Produced by Art Linson at Fox 2000/Regency.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
