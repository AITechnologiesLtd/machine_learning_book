<PRE>                              BEFORE SUNRISE
                       A film review by Scott Tobias
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Tobias</PRE>
<P>     There's a key line of dialogue about halfway through Richard
Linklater's bittersweet romance, BEFORE SUNRISE, where Julie Delpy
explains that  the only real magic in the world exists in the space
between two people.  Much of the spaces in the film are filled with
dialogue but the most affecting and telling moments are the silent gaps
in between.</P>
<P>     The premise is disarmingly simple.  Ethan Hawke plays an American
touring Europe on a train, his last stop being Vienna, where he is to
fly home to Texas.  He meets a charming French woman (Delpy) on her way
to Paris and they start talking.  By the time the train stops in
Vienna, they've already made a connection and she gets off the train
with him for a romantic day and night, after which their future
together is uncertain.</P>
<P>     Like all great romances, BEFORE SUNRISE straddles the line between
romantic projection and reality.  We love CASABLANCA not just because
of the endearing connection between its characters but also because, in
the end, we know that this connection is so fleeting.  Even though
reality finally steps in, our memories of these emotions will stay with
us.  We'll always have Paris.</P>
<P>     Linklater leaves us with plenty of memorable scenes: from that
first awkward silence in a listening booth to the scene at the top of
the giant ferris wheel from "The Third Man" to an exchange of feelings
when the two pretend to talk to their closest friends over the phone.
The physical gestures of the two actors (particularly Delpy) also
linger in the mind long after the credits have rolled.</P>
<P>     Linklater's philosophy comes across better there than in his
previous films, SLACKER and DAZED AND CONFUSED.  He uses the train as a
perfect metaphor for time.  Before we reach our final destination, it's
these detours, these moments out of the rush of time, that are really
important.  Perhaps it's the greatest argument for this "slacker"
mentality.  We are far too preoccupied with moving forward in time that
we never stop to take the detours that make life worth living.</P>
<P>     BEFORE SUNRISE is a beautifully observed romance that really
distinguishes Linklater from his peers.  His film radiates with
emotion, not simply the cleverness of the Coen Brothers or the energy
of Quentin Tarantino.  It announces him as a major American talent, one
whose fascination with the connections between people holds infinite
possibility.</P>
