<PRE>                                TROUBLE IN MIND
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<P>A film by Alan Rudolph
Music by Mark Isham
Stars Kris Kristofferson, Keith Carradine, Lori Singer, and Genevieve Bujold</P>
<PRE>                           "When his ship comes in,
                            there's going to be a
                            dock strike."</PRE>
<PRE>                                 -- from TROUBLE IN MIND --</PRE>
<PRE>     Couldn't resist that.  My favorite line in the picture.</PRE>
<P>     This is an old film (1985).  Alan Rudolph is a special director.
I've written about his films such as CHOOSE ME and the MODERNS and also
EQUINOX which is his most recent starring Mathew Modine.</P>
<P>     There's a quietness about an Alan Rudolph piece.  And his pictures
are often set out of time and place.  Here, for instance, the scene is
a place which is a major metropolitan area simply called Rain City.
The cars on the street are autos like the 1971 'Batmobile' sharkback
Buick and also one of the earliest Barracudas or 'back-a-rudas' as the
old commercial had it:  Cool stuff in other words.</P>
<P>     A new friend lent me a personal copy of this piece: a purchased
copy.  So I expected something special.</P>
<PRE>     I got it too.</PRE>
<P>     Rain City, with all it's detail is just slightly skewed.  The
costumes are a bit different, the language is a bit different.  Oh yes,
and Divine is in this and she is a bit different as well.</P>
<P>     Kris Kristofferson (THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA,
THE SILVER BEARS, MILLENNIUM) was never my favorite actor.  Let's face
it, I hate the somebitch.  Having said that, I can still recommend
TROUBLE IN MIND.  The story is a fairly simple tale of low life in the
big city.  But with light, sound and a wonderful score by Mark Isham
(QUIZ SHOW and THE BEAST, something that was barely released but the
music was broadcast as part of a new age prog. on public radio) Rain
City becomes a magical place... a place that cities always seem to be
to those who don't live in them I think.  But magical anyway.</P>
<P>     It's about low life, small time hoods and ex-cops--the stuff of
which most B-movies are made.  A few elements appear here which on a
single viewing didn't make sense: a Shinto ceremony, an enemy killed in
the style of a Vietnam jungle fight, a shoot-out which has the effect of
looking like a custard pie fight in a Mack Sennet comedy at the end.</P>
<P>     And through all this strangeness, these images out of the mind of
the director, comes that landscape of art deco and modern, almost campy
stylishness there is ...  cool stuff.</P>
<PRE>     So TROUBLE IN MIND is a special film.</PRE>
