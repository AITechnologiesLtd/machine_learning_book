<PRE>                            EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                       A film review by Thomas Skogestad
                        Copyright 1997 Thomas Skogestad</PRE>
<PRE>Directed and written by Woody Allen
Plot: Love and family</PRE>
<P>I have seen several (but not that many) Woody Allen movies. I didn't
particulary like Radio Days, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Play it Again,
Sam.</P>
<P>I quite enjoyed Manhatten Murder Mystery and Everything ... Sex, and I
loved Might Aphrodite. However I found Bullets Over Broadway to be a
snoozing bore. And Bullets got some very raving reviews, but I didn't
think I'd like. But I finally saw it (double feature with Ready to
Wear I think) and hated it. Since ... I Love You also seems to be
getting raving reviews I wasn't sure if I'd want to see...</P>
<PRE>Thankfully I did!</PRE>
<P>People burst into singing and dancing, something I hardly ever
like. But this movie is so infectious. And funny! And entertaining!
(And unlike Evita, they only sing when they need to.) Sure some of the
actors may not be great singers, but they seems to be having a great
time, and so does the audience.</P>
<P>That's all I have to say. Really, if you think that is going to be a
dull movie, you're probably dead. And dead people should not be forced
into movie theatres. Is Mark Leeper dead? He said that "This is an
almost ghastly misfire". </P>
<P>The movie is rated R, for *one* use of the word motherf*****.
Rating: *** 1/2 out of ****</P>
