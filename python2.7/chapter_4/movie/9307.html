<PRE>                                DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Finding love in today's day and age is difficult enough, but when the girl
you fancy used to be a boy, it makes for some added complications.</P>
<P>The relationship between a straight guy and a transsexual (who also happens
to be straight) forms the root of "Different for Girls," a transmuted
romantic comedy that is only partially successful.  Tony Marchant's script
works best when it deals directly with the relationship between Prentice
(Rupert Graves), a free-wheeling, arresting young man, and Kim (Steven
Mackintosh), a repressed transsexual trying to come to terms with her
sexual identity.</P>
<P>The two were schoolboy friends back when Kim was Karl.</P>
<P>Twenty years later Prentice is working as a courier for a London dispatch
service and "hasn't really come through puberty."  At 34 he's still
listening to punk 45s from the late seventies--Stiff Little Fingers,
Wreckless Eric, the Buzzcocks, etc.--and has a volatile personality to
match.  Kim, "three years pre-op and one year post," writes creative verse
for a greeting card company, and the two run into one another on the city
streets, rekindling lost interests and emotions.</P>
<P>What's refreshing about their relationship is that Prentice, for all his
rudeness and crudeness, is so accepting of Kim.  His attraction to her is
unexamined and non-judgmental.  Kim refers to Prentice as an "odd sock";
like those you lose in the wash, they invariably come back together.  The
implication, of course, is that she's his match.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the events surrounding their social intercourse is the stuff
of pure soap opera, which wind up bogging the film down, such as when
Prentice is arrested for some indecent highjinks after a rant.  In
addition, there's a distracting and way too obvious subplot concerning
Kim's brother-in-law, whose infertility brings into question his definition
of manliness.</P>
<P>Writer Marchant's brushstrokes are far too broad: Prentice is rough-edged,
Kim is refined and softly-spoken (although in most scenes her masculinity
is as obvious as a five o'clock shadow).  When they groove to the sounds of
"The Only Ones" in Prentice's hovel of an apartment, it's oddly moving,
their contrasting dance styles distinguishing the roles they have chosen in
life.  But it's one of the few sequences that really work in the picture.
A voyeuristically uncomfortable scene, in which Prentice asks to see Kim's
surgically-altered body for himself, comes across as gratuitous rather than
pivotal, as if seeing a naked transsexual formed the initial conceit behind
this film.</P>
<P>At times director Richard Spence seems more concerned with the
industrialized landscape of the London Docklands than he does the
interaction between Prentice and Kim, utilizing unnecessarily dramatic
crane shots and thunderous rock music to contrast the unfolding human drama.</P>
<P>Graves and Mackintosh give a good account of themselves but "Different for
Girls" simply doesn't have the courage to examine forcefully the issues at
its center.  In fact, for a film that claims to be different, it's
remarkably--and disappointingly--mainstream.</P>
