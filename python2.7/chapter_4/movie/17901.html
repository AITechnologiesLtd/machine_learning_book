<PRE>                              PUSHING TIN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     PUSHING TIN is being promoted as a funny, endearing look at the
crazy-wacky lives of air traffic controllers, with a little romance in
the mix.</P>
<P>     PUSHING TIN is actually a droll, relatively lifeless look at the
crazy-wacky lives of two rival air traffic controllers (Cusack and
Thornton), neither of whom you'll actually like very much nor care
about.</P>
<P>     Same goes for their wives (Blanchett and Jolie, respectively, who
play shades of the same white trash bimbette - one blind to the world,
the other a drunk loony).</P>
<P>     TIN has a few things going for it, namely some mildly interesting
scenes where said tin is pushed around (the tin being a euphemism for
planes in the air), though the movie gets awfully pedantic and obvious
in pointing out just how stressful this job can be and what an awful
toll it takes on the personal lives of these guys.  And if you thought
air travel was dangerous, well, this movie won't help matters much.</P>
<P>     But TIN has much more detracting from an otherwise interesting
setup: namely, that the story blows.  It's too long, it's boring, and no
character is remotely likeable.  Even John Cusack, who made a name for
himself being likeable, is not.  Same for Thornton, imitating a deaf
mute air traffic wunderkind of some sort.  And while you think it may be
fun to watch Jolie slut around as the town ho, it's not.  Even Blanchett
(last seen as Queen Elizabeth) playing streak-haired Jersey is just
plain bizarre instead of compelling.</P>
<P>     What else to say?  PUSHING TIN is poised to be a substantially
overhyped flick that delivers on few of its promises.</P>
<P>     Consider this flight delayed at best, due to bad weather.</P>
