<P>   You may think that movies which depend on the hero's
racing against the clock are juvenile.  For the most part
you're probably correct.  After all, the bomb always gets
defused with two seconds remaining on its clearly marked
clock, and an investigation into the character of the
participants is irrelevant to the action.  In "True Crime," Clint
Eastwood's 21st film as director, Eastwood plays a reporter
who believes a convicted murderer is innocent and has just a
twelve-hour window to stop the poor guy's execution.  While
the competition against the clock does work the audience up
as an edge-of-the-seat nailbiter against its own best attempts
to resist, the sprint to save a life is not the principal theme of
"True Crime."  Eastwood's movie is primarily an analysis of
character made all the more compelling because the hero's
makeup is contrasted unfavorably with that of the prisoner. 
The alleged killer is a born-again Christian with a loving and
responsible attitude toward his wife and daughter, while the
reporter is a drunk and at the age of sixty-eight an
unreconstituted womanizer who ignores even his basic
obligations toward his small daughter.</P>
<P>   Eastwood, one of the world's most popular screen
performers, got his start with spaghetti Westerns by Sergio
Leone, making big box office bucks with such Italian cowboy
operas as "A Fistful of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More,"
and contributed his share of violence to the medium as "Dirty
Harry."  He acquired new prestige with the critics for his
revisionist Western "Unforgiven" just seven years ago, taking
a best-picture Oscar.  What's more he joins such notables as
Robert Redford and Warren Beatty in making age irrelevant
to sex appeal, though with "True Crime" he may stretch
credibility a tad by his ability charm women of twenty-three
while neglecting his wife, presumably because she had
reached the ripe old age of thirty-five.</P>
<P>   "True Crime" sets its tone in the very beginning by
centering not on Eastwood's role as a reporter eager to stop
a man's execution, but on his capacity to seduce women
forty-five years his junior.  As Steve Everett, a drunk who had
lost a job in a major daily and now works for an Oakland,
California paper under editors Bob Findley (Denis Leary) and
Alan Mann (James Woods), he works his wiles on a fellow
journalist, Michelle (Mary McCormack) in a local bar.  When
the twenty-something Michelle successfully rebuffs the man's
advances only to die in a tragic auto accident, Everett is
assigned to take Michelle's place and to interview convicted
killer Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) at San Quentin
prison just eight hours before Beachum's scheduled
execution.  Beachum was convicted of the murder of a
twenty-three year old clerk in a convenience store on the
testimony of just one witness, who testified that he saw the
man holding a gun and standing over the bloodied corpse. 
Though the exchange is to lead only to a human-interest
sidebar in the paper, Everett's keen sense informs him that
the man is probably innocent.  As he puts it to the convict in
the death house, "The nose is all I have...If it does not work I
might as well drive off the cliff.  The nose tells me you're
innocent."  </P>
<P>   As both actor and director, Eastwood milks the story for
both humor and pathos.  The most amusing scene finds his
boss, Bob Findley, phoning his own wife in order to get in
touch with the reporter, as the paper's honcho is convinced
that Everett is currently in bed with Findley's spouse, Patricia
(played with spirit and wit by Laila Robins).  Following up on
this tryst, chief editor Alan Mann appears to chew the
womanizing reporter out only to ask four or five times--in the
standard James-Woods manner--whether Patricia was good
in bed.</P>
<P>   Director Eastwood is at his best when contrasting the
deteriorating relationship between Everett and his wife
Barbara (Diane Venora) with the nurturing connection that the
condemned man enjoys with his spouse, Bonnie (Lisa Gay
Hamilton) and small daughter, Gail (Penny Rae Bridges).  As
the clock ticks down the final moments before the
treacherous chemicals leak into Frank Beachum's veins,
we're reminded of a similar scene in "Last Dance," but
sharper acting, a wittier script, and clever surprises peppered
throughout the drama make "True Crime" more compelling,
credible and whimsical than the 1996 vehicle for Sharon
Stone.  "True Crime" may not turn proponents of capital
punishment into abolitionists, but together with Viagra, it gives
considerable hope to aging men that they can find compliant
women simply by turning on the charm that their callow
competition simply has not developed.</P>
