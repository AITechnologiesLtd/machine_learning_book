<P>Dennis Quaid with a decent role in a good movie? Say it ain't so. But it is
so for Mr. Meg Ryan, a man who is still trying to live down his horribly
over-the-top impression of Jerry Lee Lewis in GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, and whose
film choices (UNDERCOVER BLUES, GANG RELATED, SWITCHBACK, etc...) haven't
exactly been prime career moves. Well, it looks like he's finally got the
right frequency... ;)</P>
<P>PLOT:
Now pay very close attention. A thirty-something year old man living in
1999, is able to contact his own father in 1966 via a ham radio and some
freaky astrological event which allows for this unbelievable circumstance to
take place. But that's only half the story. As the two men come to terms
with this reality and get to know one another better, they quickly realize
that anything they say or alter due to their conversations, will ultimately
change the future and their own fates therein.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Pretty gosh darn original! This film delivers on all fronts: solid acting, a
well-told and surprisingly believable story despite its fantastic premise,
some cool special effects, an emotional tug and plenty of thrills. Hollywood
should be proud of this release, a film which actually expects audiences to
use their brains and invest much of their attention, in order to fully
appreciate the film's intriguing story line. This movie makes you think,
think some more, and ultimately entertains while engaging the viewer with
non-stop brain-candy. Dennis Quaid succeeds in his part despite the goofy
accent, Jim Caviezel is rock-solid and definitely slated for bigger and
better things, and even the secondary characters, such as Andre Braugher and
Elizabeth Mitchell, deliver appropriately believable performances. Will some
people get confused with this movie? Sure. This film does flip-flop somewhat
between the different time lines, but unlike BACK TO THE FUTURE 2, which
also had a vaguely similar theme, this one presents you with all the needed
clues and explanations in order for you to keep up to date...that is, if
you're paying attention.</P>
<P>Having said that, the film actually begins on quite the slow note, with many
of the characters and situations gradually being presented to us with a
basic amount of "suspension of disbelief" needed to enjoy the rest of the
film. But once the initial premise is solidified and made to be very
credible, the movie turns into a very funky mystery murder thriller. Events
from the past alter those in the future, father and son work together to
solve a crime, despite living in different periods of time, and the movie
ultimately takes off in the second half, when all the ideal elements of a
thriller are successfully played out. The film's final 15 minutes are
probably its finest, with plenty of tension, creative license and surprising
turns to certify this film an original. Of course, if you're looking for
your everyday run-of-the-mill thriller, than you might just be disappointed
with this film's prerequisite for intellectual participation. But for anyone
else who likes thinking at the movies, enjoys watching good actors handle
great material, and has been looking forward to seeing an original film
break out of the early 2000 pack, wait no further cause this movie is the
one for you!</P>
<P>One of the things that I liked the most about this film was how its aura
seemed to remind me a lot of THE SIXTH SENSE. Despite not having much in
common thematically, it's obvious that both filmmakers expect their
audiences to pay attention during their presentations, and furnish them with
a sorted premise ripe enough for repeat viewings. Of course, some might want
to dig real deep in order to decipher the holes in plot, as did certain
detractors of the former film, but from my own experience, the film had me
...hook, line and sinker. No need to nit-pit here, folks...this film is a
fun, intelligent thriller with a heart. Enjoy.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Noah Emmerich, one of the co-stars in this movie, is the brother of Toby
Emmerich, the screenwriter of this movie.</P>
