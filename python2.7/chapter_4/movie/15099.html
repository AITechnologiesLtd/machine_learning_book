<P>Remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller originally titled DIAL M FOR
MURDER, pits Michael Douglas alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo
Mortensen, under the direction of Andrew Davis, the man behind the
1993's FUGITIVE (8/10) starring Harrison Ford.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Caught in a loveless marriage, Paltrow hooks up in an affair with
artist Mortensen. Paltrow's ultra-rich husband Douglas soon finds out
about the tryst, and develops a foolproof plan to murder his wife. The
plan does not quite go as planned, and all three characters are left
dangling in a plot filled with double-crosses, blackmail and intrigue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Effective, well-paced murder mystery set within the elite of New York's
high society, melds elements of intrigue and suspense, with some plot
holes and plenty of guesses as to what's gonna happen next. This film
kept me (and Mrs. JoBlo) guessing all the way through, and added to the
overall enjoyment of this imperfect mystery. I'd heard predictability
complaints from others that had already seen this picture, but let me
tell you that most of the stuff that went down in this movie was quite
the surprise to this guy! The performances, on the other hand, were
not.</P>
<P>All three characters were your basic Hollywood movie cardboard cutouts,
but still, the actors all managed to pull off some decent performances.
Michael Douglas has all but certified his position as the ultimate
rich-guy with rocks of steel, as this performance and his earlier
tours-of-force in THE GAME (8/10) and Gordon Gekko (my hero!) in WALL
STREET (8.5/10) have undoubtedly proven. Paltrow didn't really do much
with this role, but then again, it wasn't written with much in mind.
Her character seemed quite ignorant and aloof for most of the film. But
Viggo Mortensen, well heck, now there's an actor with some bite!! If
you have yet to hear much about this man, open your ears, and listen
wide. This guy can act...and act well goddammit! I have loved almost
all of his performances, with his role in THE INDIAN RUNNER (6/10) and
last year's G.I. JANE (6.5/10) standing out in my mind, and certainly a
force to reckon for all great future character roles. Watch for
him...he's hot!</P>
<P>On the whole, this film never bored me, always kept me guessing, and
offered some ripe performances from some decent actors, while never
overplaying itself. It will definitely not go down in the history of
film as one of the greatest mysteries to ever be shown on the big
screen, but then again, it ain't a stinker either. Curl up with your
loved one, shut the lights, inhale those nachos, and try to figure out
who's going to be doing what to whom next. You'll have a fun time,
despite the film's lack of major breakthroughs.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Viggo Mortensen actually painted the large murals in his artist's
studio in this film. He also lived in South America from age 2 to age
11.
Gwyneth Paltrow admitted that her romantic scenes with Michael Douglas
felt weird in this film, because he had practically seen her grow up
before his very eyes, since Michael and her father, Bruce Paltrow, are
good friends. On August 15, 1998, Gwyneth gave a $21,000 watch to
boyfriend Ben Affleck as a birthday present. She stands 5'9.
Michael Douglas won an Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Gordon
Gekko in 1987's Oliver Stone film WALL STREET (8.5/10). He also
produced the Oscar-winning film for Best Picture in 1975, ONE FLEW OVER
THE CUCKOO'S NEST (7.5/10), whose movie rights were owned by Mike's
father, Kirk Douglas, for a long time before his son finally started
the project.</P>
