<PRE>Dogumentary Style
Best in Show</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>If you can't get enough of the mockumentary genre ... here's another one 
from Christopher Guest (lead guitarist Nigel of "Spinal Tap") and Eugene 
Levy (bumbling father in "American Pie" and much earlier sketch comic 
with SCTV). These two funny men loosely drew up the script together, 
"Our outline gives a very solid blueprint to the actors so they know ... 
to get from point A to point B, but how they do it is largely up to 
them," says Levy. Both costar in the film while Guest directs. 
The Documentary follows five couples on their quest to win the Mayflower 
"Best In Show" cup for their pretty purebred pets. Out of fabulous Fern 
City, Florida comes the husband and wife team, Cookie and Gerry (Levy). 
Cookie's pre-marriage swinging provides the fuel for follies with nerdy 
hubby Gerry. 
Yuppie Starbucks types, Meg and Hamilton, broadcast most of the stress 
and dysfunction, with relationship tension as tight as the wires in 
their full-mouth braces. 
Harlan Pepper (Guest), a fly fisherman from North Carolina, can name 
every type of nut in the forest and moonlights as a veteran home 
ventriloquist. 
Scott and Stefan are the gay couple; while voluptuous Sherri says of 
wealthy aged husband, "We have a lot in common. We both like soup," and 
"We can always find something to not talk about for hours." 
Fred Willard nails the bit part of color commentator, a hundred times 
more knowledgeable about baseball than dogs. His canine-inanities are 
fielded by a low-key British expert. The frisky contrast of the two is 
sparkling. 
All involved do a strong job of improvisational acting. The direction 
and editing is tight and the humor very often delightfully dry. I 
enjoyed it. </P>
