<P>Perfect timing! This movie is being released at the best moment for me
personally, having just begun my "Hollywood movies are getting so cliched,
lame and predictable" stage, with the recent crop of summer flicks just not
popping any of my corn. But here comes a movie that doesn't let you just sit
down and watch, it rather asks that you stare in awe and experience a new
kind of movie! The kind that will have you taking notice whether you like it
or not. A breath of fresh air. A nice kick in the stomach. A visual feast.
It's nice to be back.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A serial killer who gets off on watching his victims drown to death is on
the loose, but not for long. As the FBI bust his ass, the killer falls into
a deep coma, while his final missing victim only has a few hours left to
live. Enter a therapist hip to a new technology that allows her to enter the
mind of a comatose person. Once inside the killer's mind, the doctor tries
to uncover the location of the missing girl.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Not for everyone, this film moves at a quick pace, delivers a decent serial
killer story, and seduces you through an infectious ride of cinematic
paintings, ripe with originality, surrealism and otherworldliness. A big
thank you to director Tarsem for slapping me across the face with this film
and forcing me to wake out of my year 2000 cinematic nap. This is the kind
of movie that sets a new standard for moviemakers. It takes the cinematic
canvas and rewrites the rules with its daring use of staggering imagery,
visual experimentation and camera tricks. Imagine a painting come to life. A
story unfolding in a dual world, one set in our day and time, with
characters attempting to find the solution to a mad man's insanity, and
another dripped in a dream-state, a place where the unseen thoughts, loves
and fears of one's mind are visually transformed into breathtaking sequences
never before seen on the big screen. I wasn't sure if the balance of the two
"worlds" would work, whether or not things would start getting complicated
or if the director would just slow the whole film down to a pretentious
halt. But my fears were quickly laid to rest, as the film grabbed me by the
balls at scene one and didn't let go until I was transported back to my seat
a little over an hour and a half later.</P>
<P>But there were many other things that I really liked about this movie as
well. I liked the pace of the film, which didn't waste much time on
scientific mumbo-jumbo or inappropriate romance. I liked all of the
performances, especially Vaughn, whose always been a favorite of mine and
who delivers a good showing here, and Lopez, who surprisingly really clicked
as the intelligent shrink with a big heart. And if you love her ass, you
also get a side shot of it hiding behind its underwear, right after Lopez
smokes a joint in front of her iMac. I also liked the soundtrack, which got
really chaotic and pronounced when downloaded into the subconscious world,
but perfectly so. And despite the actual story of the "serial killer chase"
not breaking any major ground, I did really appreciate the new way that they
decided to chase after the nutball in this movie. Go inside his head...it
works! Oh yeah, one more thing. This movie actually creeped me out in
several points. Not sure if it will give me any nightmares or anything
(although I might regrettably find that out tonite), but the visual panorama
of the serial killer's ultimate evil mindset just struck a chord of terror
right through me.</P>
<P>But in the end, it is the film's unique style that will set it apart from
all of the other serial killer movies in the years to come. It's a brave
move on the part of the filmmakers, attempting to visually portray the deep
rooted evil set inside the mind of a madman, and in this case...it works!
Suspense-wise, the film certainly doesn't compete with SEVEN (then again,
what film does?), but it more than makes up for it through its bold,
cinematic experimentation. Kudos to Tarsem and Protosevich for pumping some
life into this year's regurgitative movie season.</P>
