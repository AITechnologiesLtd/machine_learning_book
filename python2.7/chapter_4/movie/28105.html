<P>There's an ex-brother-in-law of mine who, like Jackson Pollock at one
time, was a starving artist (and not ever much more than that), and who,
like Pollock, drank heavily when he decided The World Was Against Him.
There's a good reason he's an "ex-"; and there's an equally good reason
that this ex- will probably never achieve even a small fraction of
Pollock's notoriety in his lifetime (or - sadly, more apropos for the
career of a painter - after his death).</P>
<P>Not that this ex-relative of mine is anywhere near the status of a
Jackson Pollock, mind you.  It's just that having known this wasted man,
helped me to see beyond the strange monotone drone this movie at times
had for me, and understand the demons Pollock faced, a wee bit better.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Let's get the largest spoiler out of the way now, so that anyone who
isn't familiar with The Life And Times Of Jackson Pollock, can start
hating me right away: Jackson Pollock is dead.</P>
<P>Though of course, this movie deals more with his life, than his death.
POLLOCK begins with a woman, bearing a copy of "Life Magazine", seeking
an autograph from a man who looks like the troubles of the world lay in
his steely eyes; then it flashes back to Greenwich Village, New York in
November of 1941, 9 years earlier.  At that time, Jackson Pollock (Ed
Harris) spent as much time drinking, walking through life in a daze, and
complaining to his brother Sande (Robert Knott) about the attention his
fellow artists were getting ("F*ck Picasso!", he raged), as he did
painting - much to the consternation of his pregnant sister-in-law.</P>
<P>Enter abstract artist Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden), who moves rapidly
into Pollock's life, his business, and his bed.  Impressed with
Pollock's work at the start, Krasner soon sets him up with gallery owner
Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan), who allows Pollock to work on commission
for her gallery.  The world doesn't seem to be ready for him, though;
he's seen as an original, but that doesn't immediately translate to
sales, and he becomes frustrated, and drunk, in waves.  Pollock and
Krasner eventually move away from the big city, into a more peaceful, if
not prosperous, existence on Long Island.   But even after he recreates
his abstract art style of painting - using thrown and dripped strands of
paint in a style called Action Painting, in which the process of
painting becomes as important as the finished product - that doesn't
seem to be enough to take Pollock to the next level.</P>
<P>That is, until "Life Magazine" takes a notice of his work, thrusting him
into the limelight.  Bringing with it, its own new set of demons...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
The most subjective of the creative arts, Art, I fear, is one of those
things in life that you either Get, or you don't.  That goes double for
movies about Art.  And so I'll tell you true: for a large part, I just
didn't Get POLLOCK.</P>
<P>Oh, I understood the "starving artist" concept, and the "they don't
understand what I'm trying to Say here" concept and the "tortured soul
in another plane of existence" concept and all.  I just don't Get folks
sitting/standing around trying to decide what a given painting "means";
especially one that - let us be for real, here - looks like a child made
a mess on the canvas.  Similarly, I didn't Get the gist of what this
film was trying to tell the audience, past the madness that comes with
coloring outside the lines, so to speak.  But most of all, I didn't Get
what all the people in this cast - especially "names" like John Heard
(as Tony Smith), Val Kilmer (Willem de Kooning) and to a lesser degree,
Sada Thompson as Pollock's mother Stella - had to do with anything in
Pollock's life.  Yes, I *know* they were real-life people, but looking
at the cast of characters, I can't even remember who half of them were.
For all the interaction they had with him, the filmmakers could've pared
the cast down easily by half, and spent more time delving into the Whys
of Pollock's madness, and his genius.</P>
<P>All that said, I certainly groked the main performances by Ed Harris as
the artiste Jackson Pollock, and especially the tour-de-force by Marcia
Gay Harden as Lee Krasner, fellow artiste, and - for want of a better
term - Jackson's keeper.  I failed to see what, exactly, Krasner
could've possibly seen in Pollock that would allow her to take so much
of his crap for so long, but Harden brought an intensity to the role -
especially in her closing scenes - that definitely earned her every
ounce of Oscar gold that she got.  Harris and Harden made a dynamic duo;
where Harris' Pollock was moody and tempestuous, Harden's Krasner was a
whirlwind, sure of herself, with the no-nonsense attitude of a woman who
"knew her place" - and welcomed it.  Hard to believe they could've
stayed together as long as they did, but, Strokes For Folks.</P>
<P>Combined with good showings by Amy Madigan (Harris' real-life wife) as
gallery owner Peggy Guggenheim and Jeffrey Tambor as art critic Clement
Greenberg, and the outstanding directing of Harris himself (I loved his
use of quiet shadows throughout; Jackson's and Lee's first love scene
was nothing less than a work of art), POLLOCK was an enjoyable, if
slightly irritating, peek into a way of life that I don't I'll ever
fully understand.  I only wish that with as large a cast as this movie
had, I could've gotten more from the big picture.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I enjoyed POLLOCK more on the strength of stars Ed Harris and especially
Marcia Gay Harden, than the overall movie itself.  But I appreciated
this literal art flick for its glimpse into the tortured soul of an
artist, even though the artist it put me in mind of, deserved all the
torture that came to him.  Who, me, bitter?</P>
<P>POLLOCK (rating: greenlight):
But sorry, some of Pollock's paintings *did* look like nothing more than
just dribbled paint.  Maybe I'm just not meant to Get It.</P>
