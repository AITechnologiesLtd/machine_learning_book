<P>         While attending the University of Michigan, filmmaker Aviva
Kempner worked as a cashier, selling movie tickets at the Michigan
Theatre in downtown Ann Arbor. Recently her name reappeared at the
Michigan, although this time it was on the screen: Her documentary "The
Life and Times of Hank Greenberg" played there last month.</P>
<P> The movie, a fond look back at former Detroit Tiger star
"Hammerin' Hank," is the product of 13 years of research, writing and
fundraising, which Kempner said was inspired by her family.
 "I grew up in Detroit and I grew up a big Tigers fan," Kempner recalled
in a phone interview from her office in Washington, D.C. "My father
would take my brother and I to games all the time, and hence, I became a
Hank Greenberg fan.</P>
<P> "(In 1986) when I heard Hank Greenberg had died, I knew I had
to make this film, because he was always my daddy's hero. My father had
always taught us that prejudice doesn't belong on the field or in
society, so for me, Hank Greenberg seemed an unsung hero, someone I had
to do a film about."</P>
<P> But Kempner's movie is not for baseball fanatics only.
"Greenberg" paints a vivid portrait of America in the first half of the
century, a world in which many different cultures and nationalities sat
uneasily side by side in big cities such as Detroit, New York and St.
Louis. Prior to WWII, ethnic and racial slurs that would get you booted
out of a ballpark today were regularly shouted and chanted by crowds,
which meant the Jewish Greenberg had to endure all sorts of demeaning
nicknames. Yet that didn't discourage him from playing.</P>
<P> "That Hank went to work every day, with all that catcalling,
and still performed, that's one of the things that makes him a real role
model for people," Kempner explained. "How many of us would have done
the same? I have such respect for the man because of it."</P>
<P> Kempner, a child of Holocaust survivors, said she wanted to
make a film to help shatter the stereotype of Jewish men as "nebbishs,"
weak-willed types who are easily pushed around by everyone else.
Greenberg was well aware he was someone the Jewish community (and not a
few Gentiles as well) looked up to, and he did his best to behave
accordingly. In these times when sports figures such as John Rocker and
Dennis Rodman flaunt their bad-boy reputations, it's mildly startling to
see a man who went out of his way to put forth a positive image for his
fans. Kempner's film reveals Greenberg as someone who took his faith
quite seriously as well and actually sought advice from rabbis about
whether or not he should play on Yom Kippur.</P>
<P> The most difficult part of putting the project together was
"sustaining it for so many years until it was done, keeping the faith
that I would eventually finish it," said Kempner. "I feel bad for two
things: that a lot of the people in the film, the fans and the players,
didn't live to see themselves; and two, if I'd raised the money a year
ago, maybe the film could have influenced the voting for the All-Century
Team (Greenberg was not included on that list)."</P>
<P> Although the movie is finished and has earned honors at the
Hamptons International Film Festival and the International Sports Video
and Film Awards, Kempner said she's still trying to get a little more
money put together to cover the rights on the music used in the film.
She's particularly grateful for a contribution from the Kellogg
Foundation and joked, in her best Blanche DuBois accent, "I have always
depended upon the kindness of strangers."</P>
<P> Kempner, who previously chronicled the Jewish resistance
movement in her 1986 documentary "Partisans of Vilna," was hesitant to
give many details on her next project, but she did allow it will
probably be another sports story, perhaps looking at a Jewish hockey
player she declined to name.</P>
<P> "Telling our history is an important vehicle in making sure the
prejudice doesn't happen in society," Kempner said. "That's why I do
it." James Sanford</P>
