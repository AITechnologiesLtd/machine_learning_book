<PRE>                  A REVIEW OF "CHINATOWN"
                   A RETRO REVIEW, 1974

<P>        "Chinatown" is one of those movies that you'd be better off
watching in black and white to get that real film noir
experience. Representing the very best in the tradition of film
noir, this classic was honoured by the American Film Institute
when they released their "100 Years, 100 Movies" list. It placed
#19 on that list, which ranked even higher than the Oscar-winning
"The Godfather Part II" of 1974 (which placed #32). "Chinatown"
is so layered, so well acted, so superbly written that it can be
watched many times and something different just might be noticed
with each viewing. Robert Towne's original screenplay (the only
Oscar this movie won) could be put in a vault, removed in 90
years, and it would STILL be among the sharpest ever written.
        The 11-time Oscar-nominated Jack Nicholson stars in this
picture about a monopoly over the California water supply during
a severe drought in the '30s. Nicholson plays Private
Investigator J.J. Gittes (a.k.a. Jake), a smooth-talking
slimeball who usually works on exposing marital infidelities to
unfortunate spouses. He occasionally apologizes for his foul
mouth and wears a fedora like nobody's business.
        After a hypnotic, saxophone-dominated credit roll, the film
begins in Gittes' office where Jake explains to a client (Burt
Young, Paulie of "Rocky" fame) that his wife has been two-timing
him. Right away it's obvious that Gittes is a puzzling
character--he's not a worthless rodent, but he's certainly not
your average "good guy" either. Gittes simply wants to make some
dollars. As he says, "L.A.'s a small town. I just want to make a
living." As the film progresses, we discover that Gittes has a
sordid past when we worked as a police detective in Chinatown
with his arch-rival, Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez). The story leads
to the final confrontation between the major players in Chinatown
where a helpless Gittes confronts some demons. But that's jumping
ahead.
        The investigator is visited by the infamous Mrs. Mulwray,
who claims her husband, Hollis, has been messing around and she
wants proof. He stumbles onto something much bigger than a simple
infidelity. Gittes follows Mr. Mulwray everywhere until he
discovers that the man turned up drowned. He's confused when he
is later confronted by the REAL Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (breathlessly
played by the beautiful Faye Dunaway). She wants him to find out
who murdered her husband. Gittes snoops around in more places
than he should and discovers that the water monopoly is a giant
conspiracy led by Hollis' partner and Evelyn's father, Noah Cross
(played by Nicholson's mentor, John Huston).
        In one of the most famous scenes in cinema history, Gittes'
nose is slit by a thug (director Roman Polanski) trying to deter
him from snooping. To protect his damaged proboscis, Nicholson
wears quite a distracting prop--a huge, white nose bandage.
Nicholson wore the prop for a realistic period of time to allow
such an injury to heal. Ironically, he plays a terribly vain
character in "Batman" (as Jack Napier before he becomes The
Joker), who wouldn't be caught dead in such a get-up. But that
shows the diversity of the 3-time Oscar-winner.
        Later, after sleeping with Mrs. Mulwray, getting beaten up
by two more thugs, totalling his car, and suffering through two
or three more plot twists, Gittes discovers that the phony Mrs.
Mulwray was a pawn hired by the sinister Cross. And, hold onto
your hats, Evelyn has a daughter who is also her sister,
Catherine. How could that be? Well, Cross was a naughty boy...
Actually, he's one of the best villains in Hollywood history. A
great director, Huston is also a fine actor. So, when Gittes
finally learns the truth, he helps Evelyn and Catherine escape
from the vile clutches of Cross, who wants Catherine--"the only
daughter I have left". That leads to the explosive night in
Chinatown. I won't reveal the ending, save for the immortal final
line, "Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown".
        Nicholson's smarminess and questioning grimaces reveal a
great deal about his character and ignite what could have been
slow and boring scenes. For instance, Gittes tries to light a
cigarette while explaining the conspiracy to Evelyn. He fails to
get the thing lit after several tries. He shrugs and gives up.
This looks like it was a failed scene where the lighter was
defective, but Polanski kept it because it works so well. After
all, when things are falling apart in this man's life, why should
a cigarette co-operate? Jack's "it figures" reaction is rather
funny, too.
        One of Polanski's gifts is the good sense to let the camera
linger on his actors and allow for a scene to develop without
constant dialogue. That technique hardly works these days and no
one seems patient enough to try it. Too many directors are
"cut-happy" and don't want to let their actors act. However,
Polanski was lucky enough to employ superstars like Nicholson and
Dunaway.
        The film shows the racist, sexist, and often cruel attitudes
of the economically-ravaged '30s. Gittes is not a hero, but he's
one of the more complicated characters ever portrayed on the big
screen. Perhaps this film also works so well because of the
smoldering sexual chemistry between the two leads. Contrast those
heated scenes with the macho exchanges between Nicholson and his
surrogate father Huston. This is as smart a film as you'll see
where nothing is as simple as it seems.
        As for Jack, he plays his ultimate tortured character.
Unlike The Joker or Jack Torrance, Jake Gittes is a complex
introvert. He says little and doesn't get to ride off in any
sunsets with the girl. Unfortunately, he didn't win his first
Oscar until the following year in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's
Nest", his fifth nomination. He's my favourite actor and he might
still win a 4th Academy Award to establish a record for male
actors.
        "Chinatown" is a four-star groundbreaker filled with
superior dialogue and plot twists that might easily confuse the
casual observer. You've got to pay attention to this layered
story because the pay-off is tremendous. Polanski and the
producers did everything correctly, right down to the detailed
period set design and the score by the great Jerry Goldsmith.
This is the very best film noir movie ever shot. Watch it again
and inhale a masterpiece because they don't make 'em like this
anymore.</P>
