<P>   Each year that I taught American History in high school I
became accustomed to a question from one of the 16-year-
olds, often, surprisingly in an honors program, which
challenged the evils of slavery.  "After all," a serious-minded
teen would pipe up, not ironically, but altogether in earnest,
"Slaves may not have been able to do as they chose, but
they had jobs for life, they were expensive and not likely to be
mistreated, they were taken care of when they got too old to
work."  Of course even given the possibility of some truth in
this, the whole question ignores the fundamental principle of
American democracy: that of freedom, which is just an
abstraction to kids who have had computers to play with, a
comforting home to take shelter in.  Unfortunately, the record
shows that many slaves were owned by sadistic masters who
would beat them ("they're just property, aren't they?") and
allow their young men to take sexual liberties with ("Boys will
be boys, won't they?")  </P>
<P>   I hope these kids will see Jonathan Demme's startling,
idiosyncratic new film, "Beloved."  Two of the African-
Americans focused upon have recently come out of slavery. 
One in particular, Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), is afflicted with
memories that would be enough to send a person with less
emotional vigor to an institution, where she would likely spend
her days climbing the walls or huddled safely in a corner of
the room.  It's 1873, eight years following the emancipation of
slaves nationwide, and Sethe is living with a teenaged
daughter, Denver (Kimberle Elise) in a ramshackle isolated
shack she was somehow able to buy on the outskirts of
Cincinnati.  Theirs is a humble home and, ironically enough,
as the saying goes, there's no place like it.  Nor are you ever
likely to see another movie like "Beloved," Oprah Winfrey's
visualization of the perfect vehicle for her style of acting. 
"Beloved" is more a lyric piece than a melodrama, a film that
has been faithfully adapted by Akosua Busia, Richard
LaGravanese and Adam Brooks from a Pulitzer-prize winning
novel by Toni Morrison.  As a film, it is as likely to be
respected by those for whom Ms. Morrison's writings are too
circuitous, too precious, and altogether too challenging; loved
by those who cherish her rhythmic means of expression.  It is
part horror story, both in the style of "The Exorcist" and in the
more earthy form of the genre like "Amistad."  And it is part
fable of fear, murder and redemption, which dangles its
central character between her horrific remembrances and the
possibility of a promising new life.  Particularly utilizing the
skills of photographer Tak Fujimoto and editor Carol Littleton,
Jonathan Demme directs a film of pathos, terror, and rescue
by the most serviceable procedure: the use of both fleeting
jolts of recollection to furnish us almost subliminally with the
inhumanities of the peculiar institution, and extended
flashbacks which provide us with a more substantial
illustration of slavery's barbarisms.</P>
<P>   The story opens dramatically in 1865 on Sethe's battered
Ohio quarters briefly having us believe that the movie was
influenced by William Friedkin.  Red lights flash and a dog
flies across the room, shaking in what appears to be an
epileptic fit.  124 Bluestone Road is a haunted house, yet one
which in which its inhabitants feel bound to stay, morally as
well as physically.  Eight years after this supernatural
demonstration, Sethe is visited by Paul D (Danny Glover), a
former slave whom Sethe knew and who has been wandering
by foot across the countryside for years.  Looking for a place
to roost, he asks Sethe for quarters: Sethe coyly agrees,
though the ghost which has taken root in the home shows her
displeasure at the visitor.   When a bizarre young woman
washes up fromthe river, scarcely able to speak, she is taken
in by the family, which learn that her name is Beloved
(Thandie Newton).  Beloved does not speak so much as grunt
as though she were raised by wolves and has just come into
the human world.  Despite her attractive appearance--
possessing the skin of a baby and feet that seem never to
have walked before--she is feral, eating like a beast, drooling,
and from time to time pushing Sethe, Paul D and Denver to
the limits of their tolerance.  </P>
<P>   For the remainder of the film's almost three hours, Demme-
-never straying from Toni Morrison's vision--evokes the terror
of slavery not so much as melodrama in the mode of Stephen
Spielberg's more earthbound "Amistad," but by hints,
allusions, at most brief moments of brutality.  Even in a scene
going back to the 1850's, depicting plantation owner School
Teacher's hooligan sons drinking milk straight from Sethe's
breasts, the vista is momentary as though a disembodied
dream bereft of vivid emotion.  At times the story apexes into
moments of high drama, particularly in scenes involving the
title character, who cries out in protest against the Medea-like
deed of her mother eighteen years earlier: "Why you have
me?  Why you leave me?" and it is at points like these that
the account, until then shards of activity that come across like
segregated pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, come together.  Sethe
has escaped from the plantation ironically entitled "Sweet
Home," has given birth on the Kentucky side of a river, and
has transported herself to freedom in Ohio.  But on her 29th
day of freedom, her owners have located her and Sethe,
rather than allow her one-month old daughter to become
subjected to bondage where the white men would soon be
"measuring her behind before tearing it up," she slits the little
girl's throat.</P>
<P>   While Oscar talk is already centered on Oprah Winfrey in
the role of Sethe and Danny Glover as her main man Paul D,
the real find of the film is Thandie Newton who rivets attention
each moment she appears on the screen as the ghost of the
murdered girl.  For those in the audience who, after a couple
of hours have gone by, still do not get the purport of the story,
Demme introduces another poltergeist, Baby Suggs (Beah
Richards), an old woman who is the novelist's raissoneur,
whose monologue to an assembled group of ex-slaves
delivers the essence: "Here in this place, we flesh, flesh that
weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass.  Love
it...Yonder they do not love your flesh.  They despise it....Love
your hands....Raise them up and kiss them...'cause they don't
love that either.  You got to love it."</P>
<P>   "Beloved" is a powerful tale yet one which requires patience
and attention, a willingness to allow an accumulation of detail
to yield a fleshed-out fable.  A story of a woman with a
frightful deed on her conscience, one which allows her no
peace, "Beloved" deals with a former slave who must
simultaneously raise a willful teen and a mutinous ghost, the
latter both victim and accuser.  To the production's credit,
nothing is dumbed down in this movie which is allegiant to the
author's vision, one which both stays true to the role of film as
a visual instrument and to its ability to cast itself as a literary
medium.  It is serious, entertaining, filled with laudable
performances, a must-see for people who respect the cinema
as a potent means of communication.</P>
