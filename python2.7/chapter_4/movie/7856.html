<PRE>                             FULL METAL JACKET
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1987, R, 117 minutes [1 hour, 47 minutes]
[drama/war]
starring: Matthew Modine (Private Joker), R. Lee Ermey (Sergeant Hartman),
Vince D'Onofrio (Leonard), Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman), written by Stanley
Kubrick, Michael Herr, Gustave Hasford, produced and directed by Stanley
Kubrick, based on the novel by Gustave Hasford.</P>
<P>It's hard to believe war exists. Most of us don't understand it's such an
insane way of solving problems, and that is what "Full Metal Jacket" tries to
comprehend for us. Unlike most films about Vietnam, this one only focuses on
the soldiers and their roles as pawns.</P>
<P>The film "stars" Matthew Modine as Private Joker, a typical slacker who
joined the Marines because he had nothing else to do with his life (I say
"stars" because all of the characters have few lines and are all treated as
numbers - which is the purpose of the film). </P>
<P>Unlike most war films, this one actually takes the time to show soldiers
going through boot camp. Here we meet some interesting characters here such
as Sergeant Hartman (Ermey), an extremely strict drill sergeant who is easy
to hate. There is also Leonard, AKA "Gomer Pyle" (D'Onofrio), a fat, cowardly
fellow  who tries his hardest to succeed, but is constantly punished by
Hartman because he can't cut it. The chemistry between the two is interesting
and often hysterically funny.</P>
<P>The setting shifts rather quickly after the first half hour or so, moving
from the rookies in boot camp, to their individual platoons in Vietnam. When
we see soldiers going off to battle we have no idea who they are and don't
feel sorry when one of them dies. Kubrick doesn't let you to get too attached
to his characters, as the focus constantly shifts between many different
characters, although always coming back to Private Joker. </P>
<P>There is really no plot to this film, it is just the atmosphere of war,
showing how hellish and insane it is. The soldiers have not been with women
in a long time, and they act like typical chauvinists, but here it seems
justifiable. Paying $10 for a prostitute is normal there. Being woken at all
hours to fight battles with gunfire raining down upon them does not seem that
strange either. </P>
<P>Hating the Vietnamese for no reason is the general consensus among the
soldiers. They subliminally define their hatred as they converse about how
the Vietnamese don't appreciate them at all, so why are they even there?
Freedom? Freedom for who?</P>
<P>Kubrick's films say something about our own society by taking us to totally
different ones. With "Full Metal Jacket" we go through something that
actually happened in our own reality but it seems just as surrealistic as
"2001." </P>
<P>(4/11/96) (1/29/97) (6/13/97) [also by Kubrick: "A Clockwork Orange," "Dr.
Strangelove," "Spartacus," "2001: A Space Odyssey"]</P>
