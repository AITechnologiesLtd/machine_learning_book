<P>     On the surface, it's easy to assume that SIRENS is a lighthearted
erotic romp through the secluded wilds of Australia's Blue Mountains in
the 1930s.  Like in some modern-day garden of Eden, there are snakes,
ripening fruit, and plenty of naked bodies.  However, SIRENS is not
content merely to churn through the frothy waters of a sex comedy.  By
introducing the issue of religious repression, John Duigan's script
ventures into an area it is unprepared to deal with.</P>
<P>     A young Anglican clergyman, Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant), and his
somewhat naive wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) have recently arrived in
Australia from England.  At the request of the Bishop, the pair pause
in their journey to Campion's new parish to visit artist Norman Lindsay
(Sam Neill), whose paintings are threatening to create a scandal at the
opening of an upcoming exhibition.  They are to attempt to persuade
Lindsay to withdraw something called "The Crucified Venus."  Once on
his estate, however, Tony and Estella find that life is far different
from anything they have previously experienced.  There are few taboos,
and the presence of three young models (Elle MacPherson, Portia De
Rossi, and Kate Fischer) begins to exert an influence on the visiting
couple.</P>
<P>     Filmed on the actual land once owned by Norman Lindsay (who died
in 1969), SIRENS does not attempt to be autobiographical, but instead
to draw upon the reputation of the artist to furnish background.
Writer/director John Duigan readily acknowledges that, with the
exception of Lindsay and his family, all of the characters are
fictitious.</P>
<P>     The potential is here for a delightful comedy/fantasy with a
decidedly erotic edge, but certain elements of the movie work against
that aim.  There is an underlying current of mean-spiritedness that
feels inappropriate in a film striving for a light tone.  The most
sympathetic character emerges from SIRENS with the "short end of the
stick."</P>
<P>     Also, the serious discussions involving the Church's repression of
eroticism suffer from two problems.  Not only are these weightier
portions of the script at odds with what the rest of the film is trying
to accomplish, but they're too sketchy and incomplete to add anything
noteworthy to the overall story.  They appear to have been included to
inject an intellectual aspect into what is an otherwise lightweight
motion picture.</P>
<P>     The acting is top-notch.  Hugh Grant and Sam Neill are both
excellent as friendly adversaries.  Tara Fitzgerald, who played Nancy
in HEAR MY SONG, gives an effective rendering of a woman caught between
two worlds.  Elle MacPherson's performance is limited in scope, but the
role thankfully doesn't require the model-turned-actress to overextend
herself.</P>
<P>     Atmosphere is another major element of SIRENS, and that's handled
well, aided by numerous shots of undulating snakes and lush vistas.  As
might be expected, nudity abounds, but most instances avoid seeming
excessive or gratuitous, and men as well as women are displayed in
various stages of undress.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, by trying to do perhaps too much with this film,
Mr. Duigan has limited its effectiveness.  As a vehicle for examining
the subject of religion versus the freedom of artists, SIRENS is
shallow, but the presentation of the issue dampens some of the
lighthearted fun.  Sometimes, it's better not to try for substance with
a basic premise this earthy.</P>
