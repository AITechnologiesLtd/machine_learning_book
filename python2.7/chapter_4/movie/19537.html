<P>Welcome to Mount Rose, Minnesota. So, you're a teen girl? Make sure to check
out the annual Mount Rose Miss America Teen Princess Pageant while you're here
- It's tradition for young girls. Make sure you've got three things though!</P>
<P>1. Your gun. 2. A bad attitude. 3. A plan to make sure no one else will win.</P>
<PRE>Got it? Good.</PRE>
<P>The ideal human example of what you need to win is the rich, spoiled brat,
Becky Leeman (Denise Richards), whose scheming mother, Gladys (Kirstie Alley),
was winner of the pageant when she was a teen. Becky Leeman is the favorite to
win this year, but has eight competitors, one of which is a serious threat to
her. That would be Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), a dedicated, hard working teen
who works at the local funeral home, applying makeup to corpses before their
burial. Unlike Becky, who lives in an enormous mansion, Amber lives with mother
Annette and occasionally Annette's friend Loretta (Alison Janney) in a trailer.</P>
<P>A crew has come to Mount Rose to film the contestants, and the pageant, for
their documentary film. Through this concept, we get to meet each contestant,
and learn a little about each one of them, including their talents. As the
pageant date comes closer and closer, the number of contestants becomes lower
and lower, as young girls are mysteriously being killed.</P>
<P>Drop Dead Gorgeous is a hilarious mockumentary, which will go down as one of
the funniest movies of the year, and also the best film about making a
documentary. (The overrated Blair Witch Project would be its only competition.)
The clever screenplay, which is written by first time film writer Lona
Williams, features dialogue which is fast, edgy, and funny. Drop Dead Gorgeous
is the type of film that I will be quoting lines from for years to come, as the
dialogue exchanged among characters is hysterical. Drop Dead Gorgeous' dark
humor may turn many off, but this politically incorrect comedy should go down
as a classic to fans of this summer's South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,
and 1998's There's Something About Mary.</P>
<P>In a summer full of blockbusters and special effects, Drop Dead Gorgeous is one
of the few that is worth the admission price, and of course it will flop at the
box office, as it made only 1.4 million on opening day, unless positive word of
mouth starts flying around fast about this surprisingly funny comedy.</P>
<P>All of the performances are up to par, especially those of Ellen Barkin's, who
is hysterical as the offbeat mother, and Kirsten Dunst, who makes the best of
the screenplay, which gives her much to do. Dunst's character is not only
funny, practicing her tap dancing gig while applying makeup to the dead, she is
downright realistic as a caring and sensitive contestant who realizes the
pageant is turning into something else - Get out before you die! Dunst, who at
17 has appeared in over ten films, including her brief, but funny performance
in 1997's Wag the Dog, is getting her big break with Drop Dead Gorgeous, as her
performance shows the audience the talented actress they will be seeing in many
films to come over the next few years.</P>
<P>Denise Richards is the ideal snob as she walks around, flashing her faky smile
to everyone, as her desperate mother just continues to route her on. Richards
is making a great career decision with Drop Dead Gorgeous, as she has already
done sci-fi (Starship Troopers) and drama (Wild Things), but is now showing off
her comedic abilities, and this fall in the next James Bond installment, The
World is Not Enough, will be showing off her action skills. Kirstie Alley is
equally perfect as her mother, not for a second showing a bit of kindness
towards the other contestants. Alley is making a career saving decision with
Drop Dead Gorgeous, as her television series "Veronica's Closet" is slowly
losing its popularity, and her last film, 1997's For Richer or Poorer didn't
perform to well at the box office, or with critics.</P>
<P>The entire first hour of the film is particularly strong, but in the last
thirty minutes the film starts to lose its edge, as it becomes a good comedy.
Now for me to say that it becomes good, (from great) is a marvelous compliment
for this underrated, overlooked film. A few guys filming a beauty pageant may
not sound particularly creative, but Drop Dead Gorgeous bursts with originality
and creativity, pulling numerous, consistent gags which had me in hysterics.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- A clever mockumentary with a great script makes for one of the
summer's best films. The title shouldn't be Drop Dead Gorgeous, it should be
Drop Dead Hilarious.</P>
