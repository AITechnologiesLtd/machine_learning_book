<PRE>Reviewed by Doug Skiles</PRE>
<P>The best way to review this film is to put it in one word: classic.</P>
<P>Yes, BATMAN (1989) is as much a classic film as is SUPERMAN (1978). 
It's Batman as he should be portrayed, living up to all that the classic
comics taught us as kids and all that they're teaching kids about the
character now.  It's not a bastardization of the Batman legend like the
old tv series from the late 60s with Adam West was, or the film, BATMAN
(1966), that spun off from it.  </P>
<P>Batman is a dark character.  As his core is an obsession with his
parents' murder, which he witnessed as a child.  That story, and the
obsession that springs from it, is portrayed perfectly here, and Michael
Keaton fills the Batman role nicely.  He seems like a very unlikely
candidate - not exactly the buff type of guy you expect for Bruce
Wayne.  But his acting makes up for his lack of physical presence.  As
Bruce, he's tormented, a little odd - everything you'd expect.  And when
he's in the suit, he IS Batman.  To this day, no actor yet has held a
candle to Keaton's portrayal.  Only the recent animated Batman can
compete.</P>
<P>And only the animated Joker can compete with Jack Nicholson's expert
portrayal, as well.  He's evil, as he should be, and very funny, as
you'd expect him to be.  Again, not exactly the kind of guy who looks
like the skinny fellow we associate the Joker with, but his acting
speaks for itself.  </P>
<P>Vicki Vale, the photojournalist, is a thankless role when dropped among
scene-stealers like Keaton's Wayne/Batman and Nicholson's Napier/Joker,
but Basinger fits in nicely.  She's not over the top, but at least she
doesn't blend into the background, and she doesn't disappoint in any of
her scenes.  As another plus, Wuhl gets a humorous and notable role as
Alexander Knox, her co-worker.</P>
<P>Speaking of the background, what a nice background it is.  The late
Anton Furst created a fantastic Gotham City, a dark and decadent land
with giant skyscrapers that spike up into the air and have a unique,
dominating presence all their own.  It speaks highly of a design when it
sticks in your memory, and Furst's does.  It's a very fitting look for
Gotham.</P>
<P>Danny Elfman's score is another element of the movie that is now the
stuff of legend.  The main theme is rousing and memorable on the level
of the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1979) theme, and that's high praise. 
Elfman's music is dark at times, fun at times, and always appropriate.</P>
<P>If you haven't seen the original film in the BATMAN series yet, don't be
put off by some of the later, lamer sequels.  This is a very different
vision, and much better one.  It's a true classic, and something that
must be experienced.</P>
