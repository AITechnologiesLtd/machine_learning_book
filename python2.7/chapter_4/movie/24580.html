<PRE>                                DINOSAUR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Leave it to Disney to finally come up with a family-friendly way to
explore natural selection.  Much like The Lion King's "Circle of Life,"
Dinosaur regales itself in survival of the fittest, only few people are
going to be humming "Hakuna Matata" after this one.</P>
<P>     For starters, Dinosaur is that rarest of Disney animation flicks
which is not a musical.  There's a thumping James Newton Howard score,
but the only singing here comes from trumpeting iguanodons and
brachiosaurs.  The story, on the other hand, is typical Disney kiddie
fare: Iguanodon Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) is orphaned as a wee dino-egg on a
remote island, where he is raised, Tarzan-style, by a family of lemurs
(er... okay).  When a freak meteor strike blows the island away, along
with much of the rest of the world, Aladar swims to the mainland with
his lemur family on his back, where he meets up with the surviving
herbivorous dinosaurs who have banded together to trek to "the nesting
grounds," a Waterworld-style vale which hasn't been reduced to desert
and ruins like, apparently, the rest of the earth.  (And never mind the
fallout; there is none...)</P>
<P>     Pushed on by embittered leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), the group
struggles across the wastelands, with Aladar quickly becoming the
dissenting voice of teamwork, goodwill, and intelligence.  Despite his
sheltered upbringing, Aladar soon proves to be The Smartest Dinosaur of
All Time, managing to save the clan time and time again by magically
learning how to dig for water in the desert, how to fight off carnotaurs
by banding together as a group, and even advanced tunneling-through-rock
techniques.  Part warrior, part motivational speaker, Aladar is your
dino-Spartacus.</P>
<P>     I won't bother to go into the various love-story subplots
(involving, quite naturally, Kron's sister Neera (Julianna Margulies)),
but suffice it to say there's at least one martyr who takes it for the
team, a triumph over evil, incredible odds shattered, and a happy Disney
ending.  Dinosaur does not go lacking for obviousness.</P>
<P>     As for its animation, computer-generated movies took two giant
leaps forward with Toy Story and Toy Story 2, yet fall far behind with
Dinosaur.  While the textures and movements of the dinosaurs look quite
realistic, the fur of the lemurs (which appear so prominently, Lemur
might have been a better title) look oddly like Muppets on a bad hair
day.</P>
<P>     Compounding the problems is the weird confluence of genuine
landscape photography with digital animation: Imagine animated beasts
splashing around in Wild Kingdom streams.  This does not convince the
audience in the slightest and is disarmingly reminiscent of 1970's TV
show Land of the Lost.  The effect is so cheesy I was expecting the
Sleestaks to show up.</P>
<P>     Some of the humor is funny, but a lot of the jokes are recycled
("Is he going to gum us to death?").  My personal favorite part of the
film is the anklyosaur Url, who plays the dialogue-free part of a
panting lap dog.  Not highbrow, but humorous.</P>
<P>     Kids will probably enjoy the film since it lets them see dinosaurs
as heroes of the past.  There's not much to think about, and by and
large it's all in good fun.  In its production notes, Disney
acknowledges it took liberties with history by placing lemurs and
dinosaurs in the same era.  However, its bigger liberty is not mentioned
at all: Dinosaurs could not speak English.  Oh well.</P>
