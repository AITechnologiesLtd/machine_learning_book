<PRE>Where the Money Is (2000, PG-13)</PRE>
<P>Director David Fincher gave the general public the idea of single-serving
friends in `Fight Club.'  Director Marek Kanievska (captain of the helms of
such cinematic Titantics as Less than Zero) and Canada 3000 introduced to me
the concept of the single serving movie.</P>
<P>Like the single serving friend, the single serving movie is largely
uninteresting, cheap, seemingly less intelligent than you are, and served to
you with a shrink wrapped set of headphones for five Canadian Dollars for
three showings.  On my flight from London to Toronto, I was granted the joy
of a triple whamme: Mission to Mars, Mickey Blue Eyes, and Where the Money
is… three films that are highly mediocre at best.</P>
<P>Where the Money is centers around Carol (Linda Fiorentino), a bored
housewife who works at a nursing home, has an on-the-rocks marriage with her
husband Wayne (Dermont Mulroney), and cares for ex-bank robber
extraordinaire Henry (Paul Newman).  Carol wants one more thrill, Wayne's
not getting her rocks off, so she figures she'll try Henry's screws (or
screwing Henry) and maybe even rob an armored car route in the meantime of a
couple of million dollars… who knows?</P>
<P>But, if the hackneyed and unoriginal names of the triad running the show are
any indication of the collective imagination of Where the Money Is (and they
are), you know you're not going to get an interesting caper of double
crosses rife with sexual tension a la The Wachowski's Bound.  You're going
to get a mass-marketable caper with a few jokes thrown in and the obligatory
Last Seduction rip off that comes with any time Linda Fiorentino steps onto
the screen.</P>
<P>Whether this is simply the result of a vapid imagination on the part of
screenwriters E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien, and Carroll Cartwright or part of
corporate decisions related to the typecasting of Fiorentino as the perky,
evil seductress you have to root for is both beyond my sphere of knowledge
and irrelevant to the issue: Where the Money Is just ends up too clear cut
for its own good.  The caper itself is predictable, not tense at all, and
this is the absolute high point of the movie.  This, of course, makes Where
the Money Is just like any other rental on the shelves, with all of the
appeal.</P>
<P>Fiorentino, Newman, and Mulroney are all capable performers handed terrible
dialogue to work with (Fiorentino actually says `I won't tell the police,
but I may make you play bingo.') and asked to make it sound musical, and
only their incredible prowess as thespians allows them to pull off a half
decent performance with material that chimps could have typed.  If only the
writers had tried to be original, or at least pick a good film like Bound to
carbon copy, then they would have been much better off.  As it is, Where the
Money is ends up being just another movie I can't recommend.</P>
