<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"The Filth And The Fury" is director Julien Temple's uncompromising
chronicle of the notorious, short-lived, but incredibly influential punk
rock band, the Sex Pistols. Formed out of the social transformation and
unrest that characterised Britain in the 1970s, the Sex Pistols existed
for only about two years and released just one album in that time. They
were torn apart as much by inner strife and a propensity for 
self-destruction as by any external pressures. But they gave a voice, an
outlet to the chaos gripping the youth and the lower classes of the time,
and are still remembered as one of the most culturally important acts in
modern music history.</P>
<P>Much in the style of the Pistols themselves, "The Filth And The Fury" is a
frenzied, at times disorienting  piece of filmmaking. Temple eschews any
sort of clear-cut, linear history of the band in favour of something more
representative and anarchic. He skips from interview to interview, clip to
clip, event to event almost without warning. The faces and milestones do
not present themselves as distinct facts to be absorbed, but instead the
whole movie blurs into a surreal impression of those two heady years --
some good, a lot of bad, and a generous helping of weird.</P>
<P>Temple draws his material from a variety of sources. There are modern-day
interviews with the surviving Pistols: John Lydon, the erstwhile Johnny
Rotten; Paul Cook; Steve Jones; and original bassist Glen Matlock. All
four are filmed with severe backlighting, obscuring their faces, as if 
seeing the Sex Pistols in middle age would somehow diminish their 
mystique. There is also a 1978 interview with the late Sid Vicious, who 
replaced Matlock, recorded shortly after the Pistols broke up. Commentary
from the band's notorious manager, Malcolm McLaren, airs over scenes of a
man in bondage garb -- emblematic of McLaren's own fetishistic 
tendencies. Temple contrasts this with news reports of the time, cartoons
of the Pistols, and even clips from the Laurence Olivier version of
"Richard III".</P>
<P>Fortunately, "The Filth And The Fury" is not a fanboy's version of Pistol
history, but instead takes a seemingly honest and frank view of their time
on the stage. Witness, for example, Lydon's critique of his own lyrics for
"Anarchy In The UK", admitting to the terribly forced nature of the
central "anarchist"/"Antichrist" rhyme. Some events would appear almost
too ridiculous to be believed if they hadn't actually happened: A TV
interview in which the Sex Pistols taunt and swear at the host, who is as
inebriated as they are. The refusal of major music magazines to list "God
Save The Queen (She Ain't No Human Being)" as the UK's number one album,
resulting in a blank space at the top of the charts that week. The
Pistols'signing by a record label, only to be dropped twenty-four hours
later (the film keeps almost mirthful track of how much money the band
racks up thanks to their association with no less than three different
labels, although in reality it was McLaren who pocketed the vast
majority).</P>
<P>There is also little reticence in Temple's portrayal of the Sex Pistols'
final months: Of the conflicts between those who supported McLaren (Cook
and Jones) and those who wanted to oust him (Rotten and Vicious). Of the
ill-fated American tour which finally shattered the band once and for all
(culminating in a notorious one-song performance in which Rotten asked the
audience ironically, "Did you ever get the feeling you were being
cheated?"). And of Sid Vicious' relationship with the seemingly
universally-reviled Nancy Spungeon, which many believe contributed to his
debilitating drug addiction.</P>
<P>It is Vicious' story which is without doubt the most bizarre, even though 
he did not became a Sex Pistol until long after the group's formation.
Hired more for his looks than his dubious musical talent (Lydon notes that
sometimes they wouldn't even plug in Vicious' bass because he played it so
poorly), he became as synonymous with the Sex Pistols as Johnny Rotten. 
Soon, though, the combination of his newfound fame and his romance with
Spungeon led to a heroin habit, souring his relationship with his
bandmates (it is interesting to note that, despite the rebellious nature 
of the Sex Pistols, they are portrayed here as taking a dim view of hard
drugs). Months after the dissolution of the group, Spungeon was found
brutally murdered and Vicious was arrested for the crime. Before his guilt
or innocence could be established, Vicious himself would die of an
overdose. Those unfamiliar with the Sex Pistols may find the persistent 
references to Vicious at the start of the film somewhat confusing; their
patience pays off by the end, however, as Temple paints a dramatic
portrait of the man -- the "poor sod", Lydon mourns.</P>
<P>If "The Filth And The Fury" has a failing, it is that it satisfies itself
with chronicling only the years when the Sex Pistols were together,
neglecting the legacy the band left which would continue to be
influential long afterward. Temple seems to agree with Lydon's assertion
that the Sex Pistols "had to end when it did" ("but not how it did", he
continues) because they were starting to become as institutionalised as
the cultural sacred cows they were railing against -- inspiring fashion
trends, for example, an event which almost seems to mock the true,
destitute origins of the Pistols' ragged dress sense. But he does not
pursue this to its natural conclusion, by investigating how the Sex
Pistols would be perceived over the ensuing two decades.</P>
<P>The fundamental question of why the Sex Pistols are important, and why
they deserve to be documented in a movie like this, is never really
addressed. Whether this is because Temple assumes we already know the
answer, or whether he simply doesn't feel it's germane to his film, is
not clear. Nonetheless, "The Filth And The Fury" ends feeling incomplete
-- like a movie review with too much synopsis and not enough critique,
perhaps.</P>
