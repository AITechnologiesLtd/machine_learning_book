<PRE>                               CARRIED AWAY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It is a small town which a passerby, if he gave it any thought
at all, would imagine to be like the thousands of small farm towns
that dot our country.  For the most part it would be true. It is the
little things that make the difference between one place and another.</P>
<P>     There is  Rosealee (Amy Irving), a war widow and there is Joseph
Svenden(Dennis Hopper).  Joseph had been a good friend of Rosealee's
husband before the war.  Over the years since the war ended, Rosealee
and Joseph have struck up a close friendship that became more than
that, much like husband and wife without an actual marriage and each
having a separate home.  Rosealee has a teenaged son, Robert
(Christopher Pettiet) while Joseph has an aging, dying mother (Julie
Harris).  Hal Holbrook plays her doctor.</P>
<P>     Both Joseph and Rosealee teach at the small local school.  When
the county extends its jurisdiction to include the school it is found
that all these years Joseph had never had a license to teach. . . and
the school is closed down.</P>
<P>     Although both Rosealee and Joseph have had sexual relations these
many years, the passion for each other has diminished in time.
Nothing exciting happens until the arrival of a beautiful, blonde, 17
year-old student and her father.  Joseph cannot help his eyes from
following this new student, Catherine (Amy Locane).  When her father
asks if Catherine can board her horse at Joseph's stable, he readily
agrees.  One day when he is in the stable but does not see Catherine,
he climbs the ladder to the hay loft where she is lazily lying.
Almost before he knows it, despite his being in his late 40s and she a
mere 17, she strips and the movie takes a new turn. For one thing, Amy
Locane has a stunning body and it is exhibited for a good part of the
film. Frontal nudity by Amy Irving and Dennis Hopper, as well as Amy
Lucane, make this a most sensual film.  No point in pretending
otherwise.</P>
<P>     Once this new relationship becomes known to practically everyone
in the village, the fireworks begin and the film takes on a new
aspect.  What do each of the characters do in this situation?    What
does the film's title, "Carried Away" mean if not that you have but
one life to live and you had better live it now.?</P>
