<PRE>FULL TILT BOOGIE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Most documentaries about the making of a movie are purely promotional
tools.  Occasionally, you'll run across a documentary such as Hearts of
Darkness, which breaks all the boundaries and reveals something beyond
the mundane techniques of the filmmaking process. Full Tilt Boogie lies
somewhere in-between, more than just a long advertisement, but never
quite as revealing as it could be.</P>
<P>Director Sarah Kelly takes us behind the scenes of the movie From Dusk
Till Dawn. The 1996 criminals-on-run-meet-vampires movie united writer
Quentin Tarantino with director Robert Rodriguez.  They added actors
George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Salma Hayek, and
created a unique, if only moderately successful horror film.</P>
<P>Unlike the traditional promotional film, we not only hobnob with the
"upper echelon" stars and director, but Full Tilt Boogie introduces us
to the assistants, the grips, the peons...the people who get things
done.  But the film never gets too much past the introductions. We never
really get to know these people.</P>
<P>There are times when the film seems to veer towards substance, such as
when it documents the union disputes over the film.  Rodriguez decided
to film From Dusk till Dawn with a non-union cast, a decision which did
not sit well with union leaders.  Threats of strikes and boycotts raged
on the periphery of the shoot.  Full Tilt Boogie documents some of
these, but merely skims the surface of the issues involved.</P>
<P>Fans of From Dusk Till Dawn may find parts of Full Tilt Boogie
interesting.  However, there's just not enough here to recommend it to
the general public.</P>
