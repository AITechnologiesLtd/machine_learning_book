<PRE>                                STALINGRAD
                       A film review by Gareth Rees

<P>     There is a documentary that gets shown from time to time on the
BBC consisting of archive film footage taken by the Russians during the
siege of Stalingrad.  After seeing these pictures of Russian soldiers
desperately defending every street, every building, every room of their
town (and dying in the hundreds of thousands) no fictional account of
the battle for Stalingrad can ever have the same emotional power.</P>
<P>     However, director Joseph Vilsmaier has made a courageous attempt,
courageous both because the current political climate in Germany may
not be appreciative of an epic account of one of Germany's worst
military defeats and because it is a difficult task to engender the
audience's sympathy for soldiers fighting for the army that killed
twenty million Russians.</P>
<P>     The film focuses on Hans Witzland, an officer in the German Sixth
Army newly arrived in Stalingrad.  Concerned about the treatment of
POWs he is branded a Russian-lover and from that point we see his
disillusionment with the war grow as he sees corruption among the
higher officers, worthless words from the leaders back in Germany, his
men provided with medals instead of food, and the terrible carnage on
both sides.</P>
<P>     Some of the scenes are very effective--a stupidly suicidal attack
on a machine-gun emplacement; soldiers hysterically attempting to get
medical help for their dying comrade; soldiers in a penal battalion
prodding gingerly with sticks at a snow-bound road in an attempt to
find anti-personnel mines.  There is a marvelously epic feel of the
tragedy of the war produced by the gradual attrition of Witzland's
company.  He arrives in Stalingrad with four hundred men, and
inexorably disease, frostbite and combat take their toll until at the
end all that remain are two men holding each other as they die of
cold.</P>
<P>     But the film founders on its lack of characterisation; the
characters aren't differentiated or individual enough to emerge from
their uniforms and from the horror of their experiences to stand out as
people and to enable the audience to empathise with them.  Instead of
being a harrowing and emotional experience, STALINGRAD is merely
numbing.</P>
