<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Clint Eastwood is back both in front of and behind the camera in this
dreadful adaptation of the Andrew Klavan novel.  In Crime, he plays
Steve Everett, a ballsy newspaper reporter best known for taking down
the Mayor of New York City, but, because of his penchant for bedding the
wives and daughters of his editors, finds himself writing metro stories
for the Oakland Tribune.  He's also married, has a young daughter and is
a recovering alcoholic.</P>
<P>After one of his colleagues is killed in a car crash, Everett is
assigned to write a `human interest' sidebar on Frank Beachum (Isaiah
Washington, Out of Sight), a man scheduled to be killed by lethal
injection for allegedly shooting a pregnant convenience store employee
in the chest over $96 and a bottle of steak sauce. After briefly
reviewing the facts (and I'm talking about thirty-seconds-briefly),
Everett decides that they have the wrong guy and immediately begins an
investigation into the incident.  Of course, nobody believes him and he
only has twelve hours to right the wrong made by our judicial system.
Unfortunately, these twelve hours seem like they are filmed in
`real-time.'</P>
<P>Unlike every other film about wrongly accused death-row inmates, Crime
doesn't concentrate on the condemned prisoner, but rather on Eastwood,
who plays a very unlikeable role.  He grits his teeth and utters each
line like it has some deep meaning, but they just don't.  And Father
Time hasn't been kind to Mr. Eastwood, either.  He looks like a ghoul.
Ned Devine looked more alive than Clint.  And there was one scene where
they show a close-up of his hand, which was as wrinkled and gnarly as
the root of a 500-year-old tree.  Dirty Harry?  Not anymore.
Incontinent Harry?  Probably so. (R – 2:05 for violence, adult language
and situations and brief nudity)</P>
