<PRE>                            THREE COLORS: RED
                      Evening Redness in the West
                       A film review by K. Leung
                        Copyright 1995 K. Leung</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Krzysztof Kieslowski</PRE>
<P>     Perhaps the opening sequence could have been more subtle.  That is
the only criticism I have of Kieslowski's last film, a glorious
celebration of the art of cinema and the vagaries of life, and a
tantalizing meditation on intersection between the two.  Elegiac,
self-referential, and full of world-weary wisdom and irony, RED is
widely considered an update of THE TEMPEST, with Kieslowski as
stage-manager/magician conjuring up sea-wraths, weaving intricate webs
of fate that link unsuspecting strangers and reconcile present to
past.  But the director, ever respectful of human freedom, would be
loathe to stuff alien words into his characters' mouths; instead, the
magic is mostly in the shades of light, the camera angles, the oblique
story-telling--the stuff of pure cinema.  Irene Jacob's character
(Valentine) comes upon dark suspicions, and shadows obscure her face;
Jean-Louis Trintigant's retired judge sets to unveal his secrets, and
the afternoon sun breaks through into his mauloseum-mansion.
Thunderbolts interrupt the "conversation in the theater," thus evoking
the Judge's tumultuous past and prefiguring an impending catastrophy in
one stroke, illuminating one brief moment in time against all
eternity.  The all-reflecting panes of glass that frame the characters'
isolation have never been more pristine, more revealing; every
coincidence, every glance out the window is a destiny missed, and every
turn into a side street is an adventure bursting with significance--as
if revelation is just around the corner.  Kieslowski does not invent
the conventions; the originality in RED lies in the exceptional power
of the symbols and imagery, and the propriety with which they fit into
the narrative, anticipating/recalling each other, until they seem to
sustain and animate the film all by themselves.  Indeed the color red,
in the guise of a Landrover, is used prominently as the vector of
narrative.  Nominally about "fratenity," in the master's hand it also
becomes the color of betrayal, of breathless expectations, a warning;
very early in the film (following the first fashion show), the
oppressive array of red objects and road-map of cautionary signs and
flashing lights (paced by Zbigniew Preisner's breath-taking score)
combine to establish a mood almost oracular in intensity that will
never go away.  The crafty director is not above throwing in red
herrings either: the red jacket is on the *other* fashion model as the
surprised camera pulls away; it tracks down Valentine as she glides
down the runway and then--with characteristic Kieslowskian
modesty--almost trips and falls on her high spiked heels.  In fact the
entire film has this disposition of a precisely choreographed fashion
show graced with humanizing glitches; it is a cosmic fairy tale told
with the power and certainty (as Dave Kehr suggested in "Film Comment")
of planetary alignment, yet it is also one that finally repudiates
design in favor of freedom and the chaos of life.  Kieslowski has set
out to create a masterpiece, and who can deny he has created the
cinematic landmark of the 1990's.  All in all, it seems like an
appropriate note on which to end his brilliant career.</P>
<P>     It is springtime in Geneva, but Joseph Kern's garden is full of
fallen leaves.  Tormented by guilt and sunk in irony and indifference,
he is really more Camus' judge-penitent than Kafka's Joseph K.
Trintigant gives a supremely controlled portrait of this black-hole of
accumulated cynicism, a deeply withdrawn man incapable of giving
anything away; only his still clear eyes reveal the madness that must
have burnt away so much of his life.  Having given up his worldly
titles, the Judge holds the world in contempt and spends his days
eavesdropping on his neighbors' phone-calls.  He is an impressive
wizard of technology, and his command of weather conditions, planetary
motion, and daylight also seems downright supernatural; but mostly he
is a haggard, bitter old man whose lightbulbs are running out.
Valentine is his opposite: she is open and radiant, the poster-girl of
red-blooded youthfulness that gives so much life and inspiration to the
film.  She meets Kern through an accident, when she runs over his
German shepherd while she is distracted by interference on her car
radio.  Initially Kern sends woman and dog away, prompting her to call
on him to "stop breathing." Later he sets her up to "discover" his
voyeurism; the display of self-flagellation is evidently meant as
revenge for his loss of idealism, to be wrecked upon the guileless of
the world.  His scheming fails, for Jacob/Valentine's face is finally
too sympathetic, and her compassion for him is too genuine.  The
subtle, poignant, and finely-nuanced portrayal of their emerging
friendship is reminiscent of the story-telling technique of the best
parts of BLUE.  Valentines tells Kern about her troubled brother, her
fears and admonitions; he gradually reveals his tribulations and guilt,
and tells her the story of his unfaithful lover who died in a
car-wreck.  He says he dreams of her (Valentine), and sets out to free
her from the cold comfort of her displaced, destructive love affair.
Round the corner from her apartment lives the earnest Auguste, a sort
of young, unspoiled "double" for Kern, whom Kern learns about while
spying on phone calls.  Not only is Auguste also involved in a ruinous
relationship, but it is clear that he shares Kern's dubious taste for
self-pity and futility.  (Kieslowski's concise characterization of
Auguste--using just scraps of dialog and a few short scenes--has the
clarity of self-knowledge.) Only the fairy-tale maiden Valentine can
save him from a fate like Kern's, but they stubbornly keep missing each
other in the streets, as though they were ciphers in an Altman tale.
It is finally up to the Judge to take drastic measures, to give them a
much needed hand on their way to their manifest destiny.</P>
<P>     RED is a fable about the mysterious, intangible links between
human beings, and as in THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE, these connections
are for the most part one-sided or blocked, if not missed completely
until too late.  There are the missed opportunities between Valentine
and Auguste, always a few heartbeats apart, and the miscommunications
between them and their respective ex-lovers.  Among the incidental
figures, Valentine's estranged brother Mark is always preying on her
mind.  Through the intercepted phone calls, we also learn about the
chasm between the closet-homosexual and his wife, as well as the
pathetic story of the attention-pandering elderly mother; these little
everyday tragedies seem to be growing in the air, flourishing behind
every closed door.  Kern, acknowledging his limited powers, tells
Valentine she can't live for others, but must just "be" (herself);
meanwhile he is secretly cultivating a redeeming love in the ruins with
the last summons of his powers.  It is amusing that Kieslowski chooses
the telephone as metaphor for both isolation and connectedness,
considering the days of wire-taps and crossed-up telephone lines he
must have endured in old communist Poland, where phone calls were
anything but private and insular.  Valentine, the crown jewel of a
Western culture that values individual freedom above all else, pleads
that "everyone deserves their privacy"; but when she calls at the gay
husband's home to blow the Judge's cover, she is shocked to find the
man's young daughter eavesdropping on the phone too, and seems none the
worse for having learned the terrible secret.  Perhaps people are more
complex and resilient, more understanding of others' weaknesses, than
the romantics and cynics would like to believe after all.  RED, the
most flamboyant and visually beautiful work among Kieslowski's films,
also has the most voyeurism, the most decrepit old women running around
with recycled bottles, as well as numerous other obscenities.  Death,
the greatest obscenity of them all, is present in particular
abundance.  It is as if beauty and its antithesis must exist side by
side, if not exactly in harmony, then at least with respectful
wariness, and a peculiar kind of grace.  During the second fashion
show, Valentine receives Kieslowski's coronation of light and is
showered with every tricks of flattery the camera can muster, and yet
she is completely distracted, scarcely thinking of herself at all, but
is looking all over for the disreputable dirty old man she has invited
to the show.  It is a remarkable scene, one that rivals in conception
and care the miraculous spinning shot from inside the tourist bus in
THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE.  It makes one wonder what divine grace
has given the young Jacob the centerpiece to two such memorable scenes
in a row.</P>
<P>     The conclusion to RED is more daring than the ending in BLUE, more
revelatory than that of WHITE, and far more subtle and mysterious than
both of them combined.  Valentine, Auguste, as well as Julie and her
assistant in BLUE and Dominique and Karol of WHITE are all assembled on
board the same ferry.  The thunderstorm, gathering force all this time
on (Auguste's unfaithful lover) Karin's computer screen, unleashes its
fury, killing all one thousand people aboard--only the principle
characters of the trilogy and an unknown English barman survive.  Also
perishing in the tragedy are Karin and her new beau yachting nearby,
but Kieslowski would only let us sympathize with Auguste's drowned pet
dog.  The Judge impassively follows the rescue on television; just
moments earlier he has been cradling his shepherd's new born puppies.
Safely landed, Auguste at last meets Valentine, whom he already knows
from her larger-than-life poster hoisted over Geneva.  The likeness of
that poster--Valentine's mystery-haunted profile caught in a blaze of
red--momentarily regenerates before him in freeze-frame.  The Judge
looks out the window, a shade more weary now, having passed one more
sentence too many; he allows himself a hint of softness in the eyes,
betraying the fondness expressed in his farewell and his gift of life.
He will not see her again.  With that, Kieslowski's long procession of
magicians and demigods--the camera buff transforming people and objects
into celluloid, the puppeteer Alexander honing his telepathy--have
worked their capricious deeds for the last time.  It is probably moot
to ask whether the Judge has condemned the many or spared the few.
Some die, others live on, and life regenerates itself--these are the
rules that the director's characters have always lived by.  On these
very terms, the dead Weronica sends warning to Veronique, her double,
and Ulla (NO END) is saved by her husband's ghost; Julie consents to
destroying the baby mice in her apartment in BLUE, and in return grants
legitimacy to the unborn child of her late husband's mistress.  Ignored
by them all, the decrepit old woman follows her relentless recycling to
all corners of the world.  Kieslowski's mythicism, dismissed as "new
age" by some frivolous critics, is ultimately as old as the Book of
Ecclesiastes, just as the conclusion to the trilogy is as harsh and
arbitary as the story of Eve.  Still, it is a tremendously moving and
fitting ending, the likes of which I doubt I'll ever see again.  Like
BLUE and WHITE before it, RED brilliantly subverts the ideal that the
color represents, turning the abstraction of universal comradeship into
the mutual congratulations of the lucky surviving few.  But if life in
our times is truly the uninterrupted aftermath of car accidents and
shipwrecks that Kieslowski's vision seems to suggest, then I suppose we
can all be doing a lot worse.</P>
