<PRE>KUNDUN
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
PG-13, 1997
Director: Martin Scorsese
Screenplay: Melissa Mathison</PRE>
<P>Martin Scorsese's KUNDUN, which chronicles roughly the first twenty years
of the life of the currently exiled Dalai Lama, has been criticized for its
lack of narrative structure. Personally, I don't think it needs one: it
works perfectly well as a study of Tibetan Buddhist culture and how
Communist China . Scorsese views the Dalai Lama the way many Tibetans
probably do, as a larger-than-life symbol of Buddhist spirituality and
political leadership: the only glimpses into his head come from several
interesting yet oblique dream sequences, but his portrayal is appropriate
for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the
personal. The set design and cinematography are outstanding, and while
Scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle, it
helps to augment the cultural contrast when the Dalai Lama travels to China
to meet Chairman Mao. Political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to
start shouting slogans, KUNDUN does not: it succeeds in delivering its
message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly
manipulative.</P>
