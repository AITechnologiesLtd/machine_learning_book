<P>If you've been wondering whether someone can make a film as moody,
atmospheric and downright disturbing as Se7en, you'll want to start pleading
with your local arthouse theatres to land Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. Actually,
it's more of a blend of Memento's amnesia, The Manchurian Candidate's
mind-control and power of suggestion, and the bent serial killer from the
aforementioned Se7en.</P>
<P>Yakusho Koji (Shall We Dance?) plays Detective Kenichi Takabe, a man clearly
beaten down from both dealing with his mentally unstable wife and his
inability to solve a string of bizarre murders.  The victims all have a
large "X" carved into their throat and chest, but the killings have an even
more bizarre link.  The murderers are always found near the crime scene but
have no recollection of committing any crime.  To make matters worse,
they're usually friends and acquaintances of the victims, too.</P>
<P>Enter a peculiar psychology student named Mamiya Kunio (Hagiwara Masato),
who might be connected to the murders but suffers from acute amnesia, making
him impossible to question as he can't remember anything that happened more
than a few minutes ago.  Mamiya keeps asking, "Who are you?" over and over
again (his memory is much worse than Leonard Shelby's), but is he merely
trying to figure out who you are, or is he trying to get you to question
your own identity?</P>
<P>Kurosawa, who won an award at Cannes this year for Séance, uses long shots
almost exclusively in Cure, which, amazingly, is his first film to be
released in the United States.  The result makes the film a bit creepier,
sort of like you're spying on the characters, which makes everything more
realistic.  It's one bleak film, and its ending would make Kevin Spacey
proud.  But if you're the kind of idiot that needs every loose end neatly
tied up before the credits roll, you'll want to skip this and see America's
Sweethearts again.</P>
