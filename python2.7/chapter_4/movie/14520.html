Screenplay - Scott Frank, Elmore Leonard (novel)
 Music - David Holmes</P>
<P>One of the marks of postmodern film is fragmentation; style,
visualization, writing direction, et cetera.  Very often that spills
over in the advertising for a movie and leaves surface moviegoers in
for a shock (see Boogie Nights for example; the ads are like hip Brady
Bunch episodes but the film is about the hardcore porn industry).  Out
of Sight sets itself apart with a convincing ad campaign that kept
with the feel of the movie and brought to mind the French New Wave and
European films of the '70s.</P>
<P>Steven Soderbergh - no stranger to textured European elements in
cinema - takes on Elmore Leonard's novel and brings it to a cohesive
whole on the screen.  He blends the talent effectively; from his nod
to François Truffaut's Jules and Jim by using stop-camera photography,
to choosing a good writer to handle the screenplay, to coaxing good
performances out of all the key players throughout.</P>
<P>Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a good thief.  He's done time in the
joint, he's street smart and always has a plan.  Two years before the
present story began he was in a Lompoc prison with his best friend
Buddy and the hapless felon Glenn.  One day Richard (Albert Brooks), a
wealthy prisoner, tells Glenn that he has two million dollars in
diamonds stashed in his house.  At the same prison is a fighter named
Snoopy (Don Cheadle) who is leaning on Richard to get some dough.
Eventually they are all released and Jack, after trying to hit Richard
up for a cozy job, promptly robs a bank that gets him thrown in a
prison in the Everglades.  Following the lead of two bumbling escapees
he escapes and is met outside the prison gates by Buddy, but also
there for an appointment is FBI agent Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez, in
a trademark Leonard role of the fiesty and profane female).</P>
<P>They nab her and load Jack in the trunk of her car with her.  He gets
to know Karen pretty well in their twenty-minute ride but as their
rendezvous is with Glenn, something goes foul.  It seems as when Jack
and Buddy were talking outside the car Karen convinces the loaded
Glenn to leave with the getaway car and avoid being an accessory to a
crime.  Jack and Buddy scram but they later learn that Glenn has had
an accident that landed Karen in the hospital.  She wants to see Jack
again and he certainly wants to see her.</P>
<P>Buddy has a problem with this though, as every time he commits a sin
he calls his sister, who works for an evangelist, and confesses
everything he has done to her.  So Jack and Buddy head off for
Richard's home in Detroit.  Karen follows under the guise of the
manhunt in the Everglades.  It seems that Snoopy has set up a boxing
rink in Detroit and has his eyes on the money as well;  the naïve
Glenn had given Snoopy a heads-up on the deal and shows up to do the
job.</P>
<P>Eventually Karen and Jack hook up and have a night of passion, both
too selfish to give up what they love; Karen for enforcing the law and
for Jack, breaking it.  The climax is set as Snoopy, his thugs, Jack,
and Buddy go to Richard's house.  There is no love lost between any of
these men and the only trust is between Buddy and Jack.  The diamonds
are found but the nexus comes when Karen confronts Jack in his vice
and demands his surrender.  Whether you like or dislike the ending of
puffery I found it a fun ride with an excellent ensemble performance.</P>
