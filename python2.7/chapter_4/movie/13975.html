<P>   Steve Prefontaine may not have been able to catch a
football as well as Air Bud, the other great athlete
photographed this year, nor could he sink baskets like that
strapping canine.  But take the two out for eight laps around
the track and he'd probably give the retriever a run for the
gold.  Steve Prefontaine, considered the greatest American
track athlete of his time, was a charismatic chap who could be
counted on the ignite the crowds from Eugene to Munich, a
young man who proved that you don't have to be a football
hero to get along with all the pretty girls.  Robert Towne
directs this story in a fairly straightforward way: it is, at base,
a conventional biopic.  Nonetheless--perhaps even because of
its orthodoxy--it is as inspirational as Hugh Hudson's 1981
"Chariot of Fire" albeit without that director's probing insight. 
Towne tends to throw in one too many close-ups of feet as he
did in his 1982 study of a lesbian relatioship during the 1980
Olympics, "Personal Best."  While Towne does not spend too
much time rummaging about Prefontaine's compulsion to win,
he knows how to excite his audience using Conrad Hall's slo-
mo photography with discretion and a booming sound track
pulsating with Randy Miller's original music.</P>
<P>   Towne introduces the young Pre, as he became
affectionately known, a grade-schooler frequently chased by
the town bullies presumably because of his German
background and accent.  Cut to his final year of high school
where the athlete is juggling several offers of full track
scholarships.  He has decided to choose his home state's U.
of Oregon if only its famed coach would personally invite him
to attend.  The principal conflict set up by Towne and Kenny
Moore's script is between Pre (Billy Crudup) and coach Bill
Bowerman (Donald Sutherland), the man who eventually
designed the Nike running shoe.  Pre stubbornly insists on
leading the race from start to finish, holding that "it's
chickenshit to win any other way."  Bowerman warns that
when world-class competition arrived in the coming Olympics,
his protege would have to pace himself and save his energy
for the final laps.  Morever, said the coach, the lead runner
would cut the wind from the second-place competitor, making
the latter's job all too easy.  Why the drive to be first at all
times?  Towne implies that the pressure came from Pre's
frequently having to outrun bullies a decade earlier.  But in
the less sympathetic film by Steve James, "Prefontaine"
(starring Jared Leto), the athlete was seen as a boastful,
somewhat unsympathetic young man who once refused even
to allow a nine-year-old to beat him for fun.</P>
<P>   Pre and Coach Bill exchange philosophies time and again,
with the runner holding that his ability to win came from his
willingness to endure pain more than the next guy. 
Bowerman countered with what is probably the truer
interpretation: talent is the key.  "Your heart pumps more
blood and the bones in your feet are made for the tough
asphalt."   Philosophy, of course, is not what we came to this
film for, and Towne gives us plenty of action, mostly on the
field, a little in the boudoir.  In the University of Oregon's
celebrated field, in Finland, and in Munich, Pre is the crowd
favorite, with thousands of fans stomping their feet and
shouting "Pre" as though the runner were the highest-paid
basketball player in his country.  In fact he remained an
amateur throughout his life, forced to fly tourist class and
given a pittance to live on while traveling.  He dated many
women but his favorite was the religious and celibate Mary
Marckx (performed by the terminally adorable Monica Potter),
a young woman who played hard-to-get at first as she was
put off by his popularity with the fair sex.  Ms. Potter,
however, does little more than look great and mug from time
to time for the camera.</P>
<P>  "Without Limits" is a sturdy, hero-worshipping picture that
underplays the boasting which made Pre less sympathetic in
last year's version by Hollywood Pictures.  It features solid
acting by Billy Crudup who obviously trained hard for the role
and Donald Sutherland who wears his characteristic grin for
the major part of the picture.  The crowd scenes look
authentic and each time Crudup lets the asphalt fly, any
feeling person in the audience must feel his heart skip about
as much as would a runner who is at least jogging the 5,000
meters.  For the record, Steve Prefontaine was killed at the
age of 24 by a hit-and-run driver, having just turned down an
offer of $200,000 to go professional.  He was intent on
competing in the Montreal Olympics, an event off-limits to
those who make a living from the sport.</P>
