<PRE>The Late Great Planet Earth (1976)
** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Orson Welles, Hal Lindsey
Based on the book by: Hal Lindsey and C.C. Carlson
Written and Directed by: Robert Amram and Rolf Forsberg
Running Time: 86 minutes
Date Reviewed: July 28, 1999</P>
<P>One-sided "doom and gloom" documentary about the possible annihilation
of the human race as foretold by the Bible.  Orson Welles narrates and
appears in the film in which he, along with best-selling author Hal
Lindsey, discusses various prophecies from the Bible and relates them
to recent (well for 1976 anyway) events.</P>
<P>The film is dated badly, as many things that are supposed to happen in
the "future" never do.  For example, the planets of the solar system
were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on
Earth.  We're still here.  The arms race between the Soviets and
America was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse.  We're still here.
Some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that
people like Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger may actually be the
antichrist (!).  Also, there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end
of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon
might be like.  If it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's
going to be incredibly boring.</P>
<P>The Late Great Planet Earth is available on DVD from VCI Home Video.
It contains the film in standard form (aspect ratio of 1.33:1),
although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed.  Also included
are brief bios on Orson Welles and Hal Lindsey, as well as a trailer
for another recent VCI Home Video release, Chariots of the Gods.
Audio is mono Dolby Digital, and the video is fair to good for a film
like this.  I believe this is the first appearance of this film on any
home video format so any condition at all is fine with me.  Certainly
I never expected a remastered print.</P>
<P>Curiously, the menu screens on this DVD look nothing like the menu
screens pictured on the back of the case.  But they're menu
screens... so who really cares?  [PG]</P>
