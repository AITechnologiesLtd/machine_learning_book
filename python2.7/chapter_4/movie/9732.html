<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     The computerized, synthesized and homogenized society we've built for
ourselves in the 90's takes its toll on one man in 'Mad City'.  Director
Costa-Gavras ('Z', 'Missing', 'Betrayed', 'Music Box') presents a
psychological, sympathetic and sometimes compelling portrait of a man whose
fight for simplistic values forces a nightmarish confrontation in a small
California town.</P>
<P>     John Travolta plays a security guard who loses his job due to economic
cutbacks at a museum where he was formerly employed and he walks in one
afternoon to ask the 
museum's curator for his job back.  He is dismissed quickly as a complainer
and is made to feel like a loser when he snaps.  He produces a shotgun and
fires off a round in anger.  While this is happening, a local television
reporter (Dustin Hoffman) happens to be on the scene and witnesses the
unfolding events from a crack in the men's room door at the museum.  To
further complicate matters, the shot Travolta fired off in anger ends up
wounding a fellow security guard who was friends with Travolta and the shot
was accidental and a group of children and their teacher are enjoying a
field trip at the time of the siege and needless to say, they're all held
hostage.  Hoffman is able to use the pay phone inside the men's room and
gets hooked up with his station to go live as the story is breaking.  He is
discovered by Travolta and becomes part of the hostage crisis.  The local
police, FBI and every media outlet in the area scramble for spot a the scene.</P>
<P>     For a film set basically in one location for almost two hours, 'Mad
City' is a well crafted but yet low-key story involving a man's loss of
dignity and the measures he will go to to get it back.  The film harnesses
its emotions to breed a look totally convincing and it refuses to become
pretentious while examining media ethics at the same time.  Involved in the
ensuing mayhem is a big time commercial anchorman from NYC (Alan Alda) who
used to be a colleague of Hoffman's and co-worker but the two of them had a
falling out when Hoffman embarrassed him during live coverage of a plane
crash back in New York.  Alda flies to California in an attempt to boost his
career by getting inside facts on the breaking story as it continues to unfold. </P>
<P>     'Mad City' drags at certain points and Dustin Hoffman is upstaged by
the nerve ending performance turned in by John Travolta.  Hoffman's
performance is not to be 
misunderstood.  He is in a desperate situation and remains calm and does a
good job of it.  It's just that Travolta's character is better written.  One
interesting piece of information to pass along revolves around the fact that
in the original casting of this film, Hoffman was slated to be the hostage
taker and Travolta the reporter but things changed and for the better I
might add as the characterizations are more believable in this dramatic
grandstand.</P>
