Reviewed February 8, 1999.</P>
<P>"Playing by Heart" is an always-entertaining and fairly thoughtful film 
on the subject of love, and how everyone hopes for it in one way or 
another. Obviously borrowing the structure of a Robert Altman film, such 
as 1975's incomparable classic "Nashville" and 1993's "Short Cuts," 
"Playing by Heart" does not reach the overall ambitiousness of those two 
pictures, but is nicely done all the same.</P>
<P>In Altmanesque fashion, "Playing by Heart" introduces us to various 
people one at a time living in L.A. and, switching back and forth 
between them, their personal stories begin to play out. Inevitably, 
these seemingly unconnected characters will somehow come together during 
the climax, and also not surprising is that the several stories vary in 
quality.</P>
<P>By far the most effective and involving, and thankfully the one that is 
given the most screen time, involves Joan (Angelina Jolie), a talkative, 
witty college student who, one night, meets Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), a 
good-looking and quiet clubhopper. Although she strikes up a 
conversation with him, and thus begins to pursue him, he blatantly 
states to her that he doesn't date, even though he obviously likes her 
very much as well. Heartfelt and realistic, this section of the picture 
is also helped considerably by the wonderful performances from the 
effervescent Jolie, who definately has "rising star" written across her 
forehead, and Phillippe, who gives his best performance to date. 
Whenever these two wholly original characters appeared on the screen, 
things would suddenly brighten up a notch, and I always looked forward 
to seeing them in their next scene.</P>
<P>Also highly moving, if not given quite as much time as I would have 
liked, concerns Mildred (Ellen Burstyn), who opts to stay with her son, 
Mark (Jay Mohr), in the hospital where he is dying from AIDS. Gradually, 
several truths are let out in the open between mother and son, and the 
sequences between them were handled very well by the performers, 
particularly Burstyn, who has a heartbreaking scene towards the end 
where she holds her ailing grown child for the last time. </P>
<P>Third on the success meter, and also intelligently written and often 
funny, deals with lonely, but scared, thirtysomething Meredith (Gillian 
Anderson), a theatrical director who is afraid to get involved in a 
romantic relationship, even when she meets the "too-good-to-be-true" 
Trent (Jon Stewart). With this film, Anderson was so affirmed and 
believable in her character that I did not think of "The X-Files," in 
which she stars, once. Stewart also proves he is definately someone to 
watch, a comedian who in the last two months has had two dramatic 
feature roles, the other being as a threatening science teacher in "The 
Faculty." Adding a great deal of comedic support to this story, as well, 
must go to Meredith's huge dog who, in one amusing sequence, jumps up on 
Trent revealing that he is as big as a grown man. "Suddenly, I am 
feeling a bit inadequate," Trent slyly quips.</P>
<P>In the fourth plotline, Dennis Quaid stars as Hugh, a man who, night 
after night, drifts from bar to bar making up elaborate fictional 
stories about his wife and children to tell to women (including Patricia 
Clarkson and Natassja Kinski). Although slight, a few interesting 
moments arise, including one scene where, at the end of his ropes, he 
goes to a gay bar posing as a homosexual and lets out his feelings to an 
understanding transsexual. </P>
<P>Out of all of the characters, the two matriarchs are Hannah (Gena 
Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery), a married couple about to celebrate 
their 40th wedding anniversary, coming to terms with Paul's recently 
discovered brain tumor and questions of his fidelity twenty-five years 
before. I was never really able to get involved in this particular 
story, even though, once again, many brightly written moments were able 
to seap through now and again, including an on-going joke about how Paul 
is always foolishly giving away the endings of movies Hannah happens to 
be watching on television. Rowlands is one of the biggest talents among 
her elder peers, and she is able to bring a great deal of humanity to 
her underwritten role. Likewise for Connery, who has made his first 
serious film in a long time (I'm sure he would like to forget that "The 
Avengers" ever happened).</P>
<P>Among all of these alternating characters, the only story that is a 
total waste, has to do with Gracie (Madeleine Stowe), a 40-ish woman who 
constantly is meeting a man (Anthony Edwards) at a hotel and indulging 
in a strictly sexual relationship, despite both of them being married. 
Luckily, this story only very sporadically appears, so it doesn't really 
affect the film as a whole even though I am not quite sure why it wasn't 
just completely scrapped. Stowe can be a wonderful actress, and is saved 
from being all-in-all wasted due to an earnest, somewhat-redeeming scene 
during the epilogue, in which all eleven main characters are revealed to 
be somehow interconnected (although I will not dare give away the exact 
details).</P>
<P>Even with its occasionally uneven structure, "Playing by Heart" 
ultimately turned out to in no way be a disappointment because when the 
film was good, it absolutely sparkled, thanks to the fast and quirky 
dialogue and the mature way in which the characters were handled. The 
Joan and Keenan story, especially, was good enough that an entire film 
could have easily just been about those two. In the first scene, Joan 
reminisces about a man she once knew who told her, "talking about love 
is like dancing about architecture." Tellingly, "Dancing about 
Architecture" was the original title of "Playing by Heart," but the line 
remains to stand for a lot about the way we, as human beings, all 
naturally yearn to love and be loved, even during its unavoidable ups 
and downs. </P>
