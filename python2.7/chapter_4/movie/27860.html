CITIZEN JAMES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"Instead of searching for the meaning of life, our story starts with the 
search for air-conditioning," our narrator sternly informs us.  James 
and his two buddies, Steffan and Fuquan, are beating the heat by taking 
in a movie.  In a major inspirational moment, James realizes that he 
could make a better movie than the one that they're watching.  After 
spending an entire day writing the script for his magnum opus, a movie 
about the life of famous radical Angela Davis, he's ready.  The only 
thing left is to cast the part of Angela -- via musical auditions -- and 
secure funding.</P>
<P>Doug E. Doug, from the "Cosby" TV series, produces, directs, co-writes 
and stars in CITIZEN JAMES, an irreverent, hip and good-spirited movie 
about James, a young filmmaker who, like Doug, is off to make his first 
movie.  James, a broke resident of the projects in Bedford Stuyvesant, 
tries to get financial assistance from renowned African-American 
filmmaker, Bleep Lee.  (Whenever anyone says the name Spike Lee, some 
sound has been added in postproduction to cover the word Spike.  It is a 
transparent joke since Bleep Lee's production company is also called 40 
Acres, and Bleep Lee looks similar to Spike Lee.  Every time they use 
this wink at the audience, it's cute.)</P>
<P>Filmed in grainy black and white, the picture has the look of a gritty 
1950's drama set in one of the New York City boroughs.  But CITIZEN 
JAMES never takes itself too seriously.  Many of the jokes don't click 
but those do make for an entertaining time.  It's a promising first 
effort for Doug as a filmmaker.</P>
<P>CITIZEN JAMES runs a breezy 1:16.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
