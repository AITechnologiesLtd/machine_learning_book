Susan Granger's review of "FINDING FORRESTER" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P> It's tempting to call this another version of Gus Van Sant's
"Good Will Hunting," because it's about a brilliant, struggling
student, or "Scent of a Woman," since it deals with a young man and
his mentor, but I think it stands on its own. Newcomer Rob Brown plays
Jamal, a South Bronx teen who's fascinated by "the window," a
mysterious man who stares down at the guys shooting hoops in the
'hood. On a dare, Jamal sneaks into his book-cluttered apartment,
where he's discovered by its occupant. Terrified, he flees, leaving
his backpack behind. The next day, the backpack is thrown down from
"the window" and his six journals, filled with thoughts and essays,
have been critiqued in red ink. Thus, an unlikely friendship
develops. "The window" turns out to be William Forrester, a reclusive
author - think J.D. Salinger - who, 50 years ago, published one
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. And Jamal winds up in a posh Manhattan
prep school where he's welcomed for his ability on the basketball
court but challenged about his incredible flair for creative writing
by a bitter, autocratic teacher, F. Murray Abraham, who accuses him of
plagiarism. Problem is: Mike Rich's screenplay is familiar,
predictable and not particularly believable. As the gruff, neurotic
novelist, Sean Connery is charismatic, exuding eccentricities,
defending his isolation, gulping J&B and wearing socks inside out. Rob
Brown is convincing, like rapper Busta Rhymes, as his brother, and
Anna Paquin, as his friend/love interest. Joey Buttafuco plays a
security guard and there's a "surprise" cameo near the conclusion. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Finding Forrester" is an
inspirational 7, proclaiming, "Family isn't always what you're born
with - sometimes it's the people you find, sometimes it's the people
who find you."</P>
