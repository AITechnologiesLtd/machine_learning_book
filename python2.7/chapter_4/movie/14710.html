<P>What do you get when you rip-off good movies like Woody Allen's
Bananas and Martin Scorsese's After Hours? You'd think you'd get the
best of both films. Instead you get Woo. Falling in somewhere between
Def Jam's How To Be A Player (which was awful) and Booty Call (which
was ok), Woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing
African-Americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons.</P>
<P>The whole film plays out as a black version of After Hours, as wild
woman Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith) goes out on a blind date with
straight-laced Tim (Tommy Davidson). Mayhem follows them. For some
unknown reason (read: contrived screenplay) Davidson puts up with all
of Woo's antics for the entire night, which include her destroying his
bathroom mirror, stealing things from his house, violently questioning
him (accusing and belittling him actually) about previous girlfriends,
causing a riot in an elegant restaurant, and other various infuriating
things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate. But for the sake of
this bad movie? Sure, why not?</P>
<P>There are a few chuckles in the film, the best being the scene swiped
directly from Bananas. In this case, Davidson is running from thugs,
gets into a subway car as the doors are closing, starts to taunt the
thugs, then the doors open back up again. A good joke, but a stolen
one. Another chuckle is provided by Billy Dee Williams' cameo as
himself.</P>
<P>Movies like Woo are seemingly released every three months or so, and
not one of them has ever been a hit. Woo won't be one either. So why
was it made? And more importantly, isn't there anyone else besides me
who thinks these films are offensive?  Everyone involved should really
reconsider their careers at this point.  [R]</P>
