<PRE>'Conspiracy Theory'</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Meet Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson).  He's a New York City cab driver who is
obsessed with conspiracies at every level.  Whether it's in government, big
business or anywhere else you can be sure that Jerry has a theory on it if
there is indeed any conspiracy at all.  Jerry lives in a very small apartment
which he has turned into a shrine complete with walls decorated with pictures
and news articles on such things as the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon
and the list goes on and on.  Jerry padlocks his refrigerator and has the
food and other articles inside it in containers with miniature padlocks while
his shelf food around the kitchen is kept behind an anti-burglar cage.  This
guy is really paranoid and believes that the drinking water contains
ingredients to make people slaves to the state.  He even sleeps at night with
multiple locks on his front door and balances a beer bottle on the top of his
inside doorknob which will tumble to the floor and break if anyone tries to
break in.</P>
<P>Jerry is in love with Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts).  She is a U.S. Department
of Justice attorney and as the story unfolds we learn that he saved her from
being mugged by two thieves and the two of them become friends while he
thinks it's more than platonic, she likes him as only a friend.  The two of
them become embroiled in a fight for their lives as one of Jerry's theories
apparently seems to be true but he doesn't know which one and the audience is
caught in the middle of it as the film looks for answers.</P>
<P>'Conspiracy Theory' is a film that has to be viewed to its conclusion in
order to judge it fairly. It is an extremely uneven motion picture which is
uneventful at times with a sense of muddled plot and a lack of focus but
there are genuine moments of action and excitement which are compelling and
the film has a sense of appeal to both men and women who will be equally
catered to in the film's running time which is a bit too long but prepare to
sit still and avoid making trips to the pay phone, rest room or snack bar as
it needs to be followed in extreme detail.</P>
<P>Uncanny as it may seem, Patrick Stewart plays a sharply unique villain and
the film would be obtuse and flat without his presence.  </P>
<P>'Conspiracy Theory' is a good film in a summer lacking in quality and
original ideas and with Julia Roberts involved, you may draw parallels to
1993's 'The Pelican Brief' but this one should entertain most people even if
you walk away trying to figure out exactly what happened.</P>
