<PRE>BLADE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     BLADE is the picture for those of you who have avoided Jackie Chan 
movies because you think he's a wimp.  As that fearless vampire killer 
known simply as Blade, Wesley Snipes kills more men in a single scene 
that Chan attacks in an entire movie.  This over-the-top action is, of 
course, either totally cool or completely ridiculous depending on your 
point of view.  </P>
<P>     Arguably the most fascinating part of the movie is the carefully 
constructed vampire world that writer David S. Goyer lays out for us.  
At the top of the vampire hierarchy are the pure bloods.  These elite, 
who meet in expensive board rooms to manage their investments, wear blue 
suits that would make them look like Wall Street brokers except for 
their walk, which gives the appearance that the suits are starched.</P>
<P>     In BLADE the vampire social structure is in the process of being 
upset by a group of rebellious youngsters of a less than pure strain.  
Stephen Dorff plays their leader, Deacon Frost.  Frost likes to take his 
minions to hidden raves in which blood pours from the fire sprinklers as 
the DJ plays heavy metal music.  Frost even arranges the procurement of 
humans for some late night snacks.</P>
<P>     Snipes, who has a wide acting range from action heroes (MURDER AT 
1600) to lovers (ONE NIGHT STAND), rarely gets offered the best 
material.  Regardless of the quality of script, he manages to put so 
much energy into it that it is usually worth watching.  Some actors 
possess great natural talent, but with Snipes it is more his intensity 
and commitment that make the difference.</P>
<P>     BLADE's director, Stephen Norrington, clearly wants to make a 
fast-paced, no-holds barred bloodfest, and he succeeds.  If vampire 
pictures are your cup of tea, this is one of the better ones.  
(Personally, I don't think I'll ever see a better one than HABIT, which 
I reviewed earlier this year.)  The problem with Norrington's approach 
is that it soon becomes highly repetitive.  A half-hour would probably 
suffice for most viewers, and some will be so grossed out by French 
kissing vampires with blood drenched mouths that they will leave before 
the film is over anyway.</P>
<P>     As Abraham Whistler, Kris Kristofferson plays an old character who 
makes the weapons for Blade to use in his attempt to wipe out the 
vampire nation.  Even if the guns are sleek and powerful, Blade's noisy, 
old black Dodge Charger provides as much visceral thrill as its aging 
mufflers growl.</P>
<P>     Although we learn that silver bullets and essence of garlic are the 
best vampire weapons, there are others.  The movie leaves you with a 
reason not to throw out that old cancer-inducing sunlamp you have in the 
back of the closet.  One ancient vampire, who would make Jabba the Hutt 
look svelte, is fried with just such a weapon.</P>
<P>     BLADE runs 2:00.  It is rated R for strong violence and vampire 
related gore and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
