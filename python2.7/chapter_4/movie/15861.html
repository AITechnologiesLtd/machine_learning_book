<PRE>                          YOU'VE GOT MAIL 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   3 out of 4 for Meg at her very best</PRE>
<P>Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Dave
Chappelle, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, Dabney Coleman.
Screenplay: Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron.
Producers: Lauren Shuler Donner and Nora Ephron.
Director: Nora Ephron.</P>
<P>    In the romantic, feel-good comedy of the year we once again have the
successful pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. This movie belongs to
Ryan, who is at her best - you won't see her smile or gesture more,
carrying with her an innate radiance that simply lights up the screen.
She has truly reached her prime, a remarkable, natural comedienne of our
time, who carries a unique, magical quality that will be remembered many
years from now. With Nora and Delia Ephron combining to write a
post-modern, romantic comedy that is well written, humorous and above
all intelligent, this story will bring cheer to everyone during the
holiday season.
     The story is about love on the Internet and love in real life. Ryan
and Hank's characters are soul mates by Net (known only to each other by
the pseudonyms ‘Shopgirl' and ‘NY152') and fierce competitors by day.
The dilemma lies in the fact that they despise each other in real life –
Hank's owns a megasize, chain of bookstores that is killing Ryan's
self-run, children's bookstore. The question posed to the viewer is
whether you can end up loving someone that you started out hating. With
frequent references to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the answer is
yes – the prejudiced Ms Bennet, does end up falling for the proud Mr
Darcy. But the answer is not so simple in this movie – not only do we
have computers, cyber-relationships and books to complicate the matter,
it is the fine tuning of wit, humour and circumstance, intricately
crafted by two sisters, that brings this difficult situation to a
believable, well-timed, lyrical ending.</P>
