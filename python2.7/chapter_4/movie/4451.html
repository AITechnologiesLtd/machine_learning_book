<P>     It's always a tricky proposition to make a motion picture based on 
recent history -- and the more public the episode, the more difficult it 
is for the film maker to balance drama with accuracy.  This is 
especially true when that film maker is Oliver Stone, a director known 
more for self-aggrandizement than for the thoughtful handling of 
difficult issues.  Under Stone, JFK turned into a three-hour paranoid 
ordeal with a conspiracy theory ten times less plausible than the Warren 
Commission's "one bullet" hypothesis.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS became a 
sickening display of indulgent ego-stroking.  </P>
<P>     It's entirely because of Stone's reputation that the even-
handedness of NIXON is such a surprise.  While not an unassailable 
portrait of the late president, this movie at least attempts to present 
Nixon as a human being, with all the failings and greatness inherent in 
a man of his stature.  Nixon is portrayed an neither demonic nor 
angelic.  This is a rare occasion where Stone's script is more concerned 
with executing a character study than pushing a political agenda.  The 
film even ends with a touching tribute culled from Nixon's funeral last 
year.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that Stone has stuck entirely to the historical 
record.  Unwilling to abandon conspiracy theories, the director comes up 
with a rather ridiculous connection between Nixon and JFK's assassins.  
The man linking the title character to November 22, 1963 is a rich Texas 
oil magnate, played by none other than Larry Hagman.  While his name 
isn't J.R. Ewing, the similarities are too obvious to ignore.  One 
wonders if Stone didn't include this bit just to incite controversy and 
raise a few eyebrows.</P>
<P>     NIXON is not a simple regurgitation of historical events.  In fact, 
history is used primarily as the backdrop against which this character 
study takes place.  Less a biography than an impressionist's vision, the 
film may disappoint those expecting a vitriolic attack on someone who is 
surely not among Stone's heroes.  But the lead personae, as realized by 
Anthony Hopkins, isn't reduced to an unthinking, unfeeling caricature.  
While Nixon is depicted as a paranoid, borderline-megalomaniac, he's 
also shown to have deep moral convictions, a strong sense of loyalty, 
and a love of his country.  The drama plays out in a Shakespearean 
fashion, with Nixon's tragic flaw of hubris clearly in evidence.  
Hopkins is not heavily made up -- and therefore doesn't really look like 
his character -- but his mannerisms are perfect and he is allowed a full 
range of facial expressions (unlike Robert Duvall in STALIN).   Hopkins 
does far more with acting than fake jowls could ever accomplish.</P>
<P>     The film's structure is disjointed, especially during the first 
hour, as the narrative skips back and forth through time from Watergate 
to 1960 to the 1920s and 30s.  Stone is giving us a snapshot of Nixon's 
life, but it comes in such a random and haphazard fashion that it dims 
the dramatic impact and dilutes early character development.  It's not 
until the film's second hour, as Nixon faces the dilemma of how to end 
the Vietnam War, that Hopkins' character starts to click.</P>
<P>     Stone's penchant for bizarre cinematography damages the film more 
often than not.  Many of the odd camera angles, film stock switches, and 
surrealistic superimposed backdrops are distracting rather than 
effective.  Unfortunately, this has become one of Stone's trademarks; he 
seems unable to make a film without making some kind of statement to the 
effect of:  "Look at me!  I'm an artist!"  NIXON would have been better 
focused without such grandstanding.</P>
<P>     There are several memorable scenes in NIXON and these, along with 
Hopkins' outstanding portrayal, keep the viewer engaged.  One takes 
place at the Lincoln Memorial, where Nixon faces a group of student 
protesters and tries to explain why he can't stop the Vietnam War.  
Another is a confrontation between the President and his wife (Joan 
Allen) as his whole life goes up in smoke.  Then there's a moment in the 
White House where Nixon and Kissinger (Paul Sorvino) pray as the 
President prepares to offer his resignation.  And, throughout the whole 
film, there's Nixon's ongoing competition with JFK, his most bitter foe 
in life and death.</P>
<P>     NIXON really doesn't offer any surprising insights, nor does it 
break new ground for the director.  This is a dynamic -- if flawed -- 
look at the man who, for better and for worse, changed America's place 
in the world and its perception of itself.  There are few who do not 
have an opinion of Nixon.  In this motion picture, Oliver Stone presents 
his vision of the forces that drove and motivated the late President.  
And, factual or not, there's no denying that NIXON has moments when it 
is nothing short of compelling.  </P>
