<PRE>                    THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The way I see it, any film starring Christopher Walken as a
quadriplegic gangster has to have something going for it.  And while
THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD has *something,* I'm not quite
sure what that is.</P>
<P>     Just you're typical gangster/melodrama/black comedy/romance flick,
THINGS TO DO... is a stylish story about a few days in the life of Jimmy
the Saint (Andy Garcia).  Jimmy plays a mobster-gone-good whose attempt at
legitimacy is a business known as "Afterlife Advice," where terminally ill
clients can videotape future advice for their loved ones.</P>
<P>     The Man With The Plan (Walken), Jimmy's old boss, soon calls him back
for a special job:  rough up the new boyfriend of The Man's son's
ex-girlfriend (got that?)--no big deal.  Jimmy then reassembles his old
team of hit men, including the leper "Pieces" (Christopher Lloyd),
Franchise (William Forsythe), Easy Wind (Bill Nunn), and the
beyond-hyperactive Critical Bill (Treat Williams in his fabled "comeback"
role).  In case you haven't figured it out yet, THINGS TO DO... is not
exactly long on tastefulness.</P>
<P>     To make the overly long story short:  the gang manages to completely
screw up the job, Jimmy finds himself falling in love with a girl named
Dagney (Gabrielle Anwar), and a whole lot of folks get whacked.  When you
sort all this out, you get a plot that's mildly interesting and sometimes
funny but is mainly a tedious exercise in attempted hipness. 
Incidentally, Scott Rosenberg's script was written in two weeks...and you
can tell.</P>
<P>     The film has its fun moments and first-timer Gary Fleder's direction
isn't too tough on the viewer (it's about as aesthetically pleasing as any
film made in Denver can get).  Williams's performance is further
over-the-top than I've seen since Jack Nicholson in BATMAN (not that
that's a bad thing), and Fairuza Balk also turns in a startling
performance as Jimmy's favorite hooker.</P>
<P>     Other than these elements, THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD is
merely average--a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to die there.</P>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2</PRE>
<PRE>\-------------------------------\
