<PRE>BESIEGED (M).  
(NewVision)
Director: Bernardo Bertolucci
Stars: Thandie Newton, David Thewlis, Claudio Santamarta, John C Ojwang
Running time: 95 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci's films often unfold on a
sprawling canvas (the epic 1900 and the Oscar-winning The Last
Emperor, etc), while others court controversy (Last Tango In Paris).
While some of his works are visually lush, many are also interminably
dull (The Sheltering Sky and Little Buddha, etc).  Bertolucci's latest
film is a far more intimate and personal story, yet it still embraces
many of his favourite themes.</P>
<P>Set in contemporary Rome, Besieged is a poignant tale about
the coming together of two strangers, lonely and lost people, who are
held hostage to matters of the heart.  Shandurai (Thandie Newton, from
Flirting, etc) is a refugee from an African nation in turmoil.  Her
husband, a school teacher and political activist, has been arrested
and detained by the military regime.  Shandurai is studying medicine
at a Rome university hospital, and earns extra money by cleaning the
apartment block in which she resides.  It is while performing these
daily duties that she first meets Kinsky (David Thewlis, the
narcissistic anti-hero from Mike Leigh's Naked, etc), a musician who
eschews the public forum.</P>
<P>Kinsky is infatuated by the beguiling Shandurai, but she is
still haunted by the palpable presence of her husband.  "If you really
loved me, you would get my husband out of jail," she snaps at him one
day.  And slowly but surely, Kinsky proceeds to do just that.  He
begins to sell off his valuable possessions, including his beloved
piano, to secretly negotiate her husband's release.  Shandurai is
ignorant of Kinsky's intentions until the end, when she is ultimately
forced to choose between the two very different men who have become
important parts of her life.  However, Bertolucci cleverly ends the
film on a hauntingly ambiguous, enigmatic but optimistic note, that
forces the audience to draw their own conclusions as to what will
happen next.</P>
<P>Bertolucci directs with remarkable restraint and
understatement, making this allusive, meditative film a surprisingly
powerful and moving experience.  Like a great composer, he slowly
pulls the various elements together for a rewarding emotional
crescendo.  However, many within the audience may find the pacing
rather slow.  Others will be deeply involved in the emotional journey
of the two characters.</P>
<P>The film is held together by the moving, engaging and quite
sympathetic central performances.  In particular, Newton, whose
anguished and painful performance as a former slave was the best
feature of the dire Beloved, gives another wonderful performance of
great vulnerability and depth.  Thewlis is full of nervous mannerisms
and jittery movements that wonderfully capture the energy of a man
uncomfortable and unsure of his place in the world.  The peripheral
characters add colour to the film, although dramatically they add
little.</P>
<P>Besieged has been ravishingly shot by Fabio Cianchetti, whose
use of hand-held cameras gives the story a more intimate perspective.
Music plays an important part in underscoring the emotional heart of
the film, and Bertolucci weaves in everything from classical sonatas
to primitive African rhythms.</P>
<P>Besieged reaffirms Bertolucci's reputation as one of the great 
craftsmen of contemporary cinema.</P>
