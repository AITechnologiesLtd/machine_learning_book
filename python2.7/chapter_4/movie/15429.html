<P>A Film Review (in the form of a Q/A session) by Mark O'Hara</P>
<P>Q: Tony Scott has a reputation as a solid director of action films.  
Describe scenes from "Enemy of the State" that perpetuate this idea.</P>
<P>A:  After a well-done but rather conventional opening, the credits roll, 
probably unwatched, over frenetic vantages of Washington D.C. exteriors, 
spliced into shots of high-tech monitors, screens showing vehicles 
tracked from satellites 155 miles above the Earth.  Several times the 
camera freezes and jerks in perspective, creating an effect both 
fascinating and dizzying.  Early on we witness chase scenes that leave 
us panting.  One idea established early is that the government 
agents-gone-wrong - the ones doing the chasing - are ruthless and 
amoral;  they are young and fleet of foot, their short hair standing up 
with gel.  What is noticeable is the frequency of their failure, 
especially after they stop merely trying to trace Robert Dean (Will 
Smith) and really try to rub him out.  This is a necessary convention.  
The pursuit we see is tense and original, showing the tenacity of one 
man, usually on foot, trying to recover his life.  In a sequence inside 
a tunnel, Dean flees on foot as the agents converge;  in a slick stunt 
he slips just in time out of a ventilation shaft and back into the 
tunnel, where he once again uses his wits to disappear. The vehicle 
chases are not as stunning as those in "Bullitt" or "The French 
Connection," but the scenes of Dean - and especially of Dean and Brill 
(Gene Hackman) escaping together -- are well choreographed and essential 
to the theme of individuals triumphing over a culture in which privacy 
is taking heavy hits.  Scott shows his experience as a director with a 
penchant for action.</P>
<P>Q:  Describe camera angles or shots that establish a mood of tension. </P>
<P>A:  There are nifty Dutch angles arranged during an argument between 
Dean and his wife Carla (Regina King), her canted face yelling back at 
him.  Clearly, Dean's life is being turned on end.  We watch a surplus 
of scenes taken from satellites, as the operatives for the National 
Security Agency track their prey, bodies or cars bracketed by target 
lines as if about to be smart-bombed.  Everywhere we look there is a 
sense of paranoia, including scenes in which the FBI is staking out an 
Italian restaurant.  In these aspects the film hearkens back to things 
Copollian - "The Godfather," "The Conversation," even the eerily dark 
"Apocalypse Now."  </P>
<P>Q:  Describe the qualities that veteran actors Jason Robards (as Senator 
Hammersly) and Gabriel Byrne (as the pseudo-Brill) bring to their brief 
roles.</P>
<P>A:  Their appearances are short but masterful.  As Hammersly, Robards' 
acting is as transparent as the prose of a well-seasoned writer.  We 
believe he is principled enough to refuse an offer he shouldn't have 
refused, and the plot hinges on his wrong decision.  In his role as 
"Brill," Byrne acts with smooth efficiency and assurance, completing his 
assignment of throwing off both Robert Dean and the viewer.  What 
casting!</P>
<P>Q:  How do you think the role of Robert Clayton Dean affects the career 
of Will Smith?</P>
<P>A:  A good move.  I heard it said that this is his first starring role, 
but wasn't he at the head of the ensemble casts - if they can be so 
called - of "Independence Day" and "Men In Black"?  (Plus, he's garnered 
the lines of James West, after first being touted as Artie Gordon, in 
"The Wild, Wild West.")  Smith once again proves likable and believable 
in the way he relates to others, and he even manages to pull off two or 
three stints of comic relief in this chase-heavy drama.  A cultural 
aside:  Smith makes a canny self-reference to race when a mobster makes 
a bad choice of words.  Other than this, Smith and his wife and son, 
along with Lisa Bonet as Rachel, are the only blacks in the cast;  not 
much African-American culture is reflected here.  And there are two 
Hispanics, one a nanny, the other a maid.  The last word:  I will pay to 
see Smith again, partly because I like his advocating of discipline and 
responsibility, both in his acting and in his music.</P>
<P>Q:  Critique Gene Hackman's performance as Brill.</P>
<P>A:  Ahead of the ideas and Smith's performance, Hackman is the best 
thing about the movie.  First, his looks are perfect - a sixty-something 
original "techie" who went underground after a debacle in Iran in 1980.  
He is appropriately grizzled and stoic, his hypoglycemia adding to his 
gruffness.  Brill has "disappeared" himself and surfaces only when 
contracted to gather information.  As he demonstrates through his 
expression, his easy way of characterizing complex personalities, and 
his collection of subtle mannerisms, Hackman is one of the very best 
living actors. </P>
<P>Q:  Explain the main conflict of the film.</P>
<P>A:  After a member of Congress dies mysteriously, a Washington labor 
lawyer, Robert Dean, finds his career ruined and his life in grave 
danger.  Officials in a renegade division of the National Security 
Agency are trying to recover a recording of the Senator's murder, and 
they stop at almost nothing along the way.  (At least they do not kidnap 
the wife or kid:  that would have turned the film into the worst kind of 
"jep" story.)  For quite a while Dean does not know the reason he is 
being hunted;  he thinks a mob boss is after him.  In an ingenious 
conclusion, the main narrative meshes into the subplot involving the 
mobster's videotape the villains on both sides meeting in the kitchen of 
the Italian restaurant.  Another twist is that something happens to the 
tape of the murder, and Dean enlists Brill's help to turn the tables on 
the government thugs.  Yes, this film will inspire paranoia among many 
viewers, but a little thinking about the real speed of most government 
agencies will provide a sense of security!</P>
<P>Q:  Is there too much action in the film?  Are there enough ideas to 
balance with the action?</P>
<P>A:    Having heard from one critic that the film was nothing but a 
collection of slick chase scenes, I went into the theater wary.  I was 
pleasantly taken aback when I was not only entertained by the action, 
but fascinated by the implications.  "Enemy of the State" is layered 
with meanings, ideas that build momentum just as surely as the plot 
builds to a climax.  Because of how subtly these ideas accumulate, the 
film is deceptive in its power.  We witness scene after scene of 
relentless pursuits, deteriorating personal lives, and a host of other 
cliches.  Nevertheless, the material works.  For one, we feel close to 
Dean and Brill;  the number of jams  they fall into and climb out of 
finally pushes the film well past mediocrity.  And the handling of the 
issues of personal privacy, loyalty, and morality provides the viewer 
with plenty outlets for intelligent thought.  I'm reminded of how a 
rather mediocre story like "Mr. Holland's Opus," through its time span 
and patient presentation of themes, became an outstanding film.  "Enemy 
of the State" is from a different genre, but I think some of the same 
patterns apply.</P>
<P>Q:  Would you recommend the film to a friend?  Why or why not?</P>
<P>A:  Yes, and I would urge the friend to feel free to hate it if he or 
she finds reason.  Over the last several months, I have come across many 
negative early reviews, only to hear later that a film is excellent.  
Will I stop reading reviews of films before I see them?  Of course not.  
But I'll remember how crucial it is to think for myself about the 
quality of a film, and I'll remember that part of that quality is highly 
subjective:  Was it pleasing to me, and if it has been judged a poor 
film, were the critics' words valid?  "Enemy of the State" contains some 
objectionable language, but mostly its R rating comes from violent 
scenes, especially one near the end.  I think most viewers will be 
captivated by both its quick wit and action.</P>
