<P>Reluctantly, I'll have to spell out much of the plot. "Guinevere" is 
a May -October love affair. Bohemian photographer Connie Fitzpatrick, 
is played by Irishman (b.1949) Stephen Rea. Harper Sloane, is played 
by Sarah Polley (b.1949). We meet them at her sister's wedding in 
July 1991., in San Francisco.</P>
<P>The Sloanes are an upper middle-class family, at least in income: Dad 
is a lawyer, Big Sister is a lawyer, her husband is a lawyer. There's 
symbolism here, but it is not especially exploited, except that 
Harper, a recent college graduate, has been accepted at the Harvard 
Law School and appears to be less than enthusiastic about it.</P>
<P>At the wedding she  seems to feel awkward, restless and uninvolved 
--until she meets its photographer Connie. The turning point comes 
later, when the pictures he took arrive. He's framed them so as to 
miss Harper, but the lot includes a presumably "catch the real 
person" picture of her, solo. The enchanted girl rushes to visit him 
in his proletarian studio-plus-apartment. He impresses her with his 
persona, she impresses him with her youth, things heat up and she 
moves in with Connie while lying to her family by saying she is had. 
in fact, not been accepted by Harvard and that she is now staying 
with a girlfriend. The Sloanes -- defying  logic --somehow accept 
both alibis.</P>
<P>Connie seduces Harper both physically and mentally, makes her his 
assistant and teaches her photography. You smell  immediately the 
Pygmalion thing --with a difference: it's like Rex Harrison going to 
bed with Audrey Hepburn first, and only then drilling her in the art 
of speaking. Here this is visual language, with a Nikon camera. 
Harper does well, but too soon for viewers  who are "au courant" with 
the skills of photography. Still, it is an interesting relationship, 
even though neither he nor she are interesting per se.</P>
<P>Following a mixed bag of small episodes, some fifty minutes into the 
film, Mrs. Deborah  Sloane appears in the twosome's abode. She is a 
handsome 40-year-old woman (Jean Smart, b.1959) who might have made a 
more appropriate mistress than her daughter. Ms. Smart steals the 
show in a rather short sequence. She does not throw a tantrum, does 
not recriminate, but coolly dissects the situation. She tells Connie 
:"You're even older than me, and you're [word deleted] my daughter." 
She also analyzes, with a clever subtext of regret, the fact that no 
woman who is not physically perfect would dare show her flesh to the 
experienced eyes of Connie. And she hits the nail on the head with "I 
know exactly what she [Harper] has that I haven't got. Awe" which she 
explains lucidly.  Connie- the-seducer's reaction is "You're quite a 
woman, Deborah." But she puts him down with "Mrs. Sloane. I am Mrs. 
Sloane" and departs.</P>
<P>This sequence is the best in the movie, especially as the 
well-sketched Mrs. Sloane can be at the same time a haughty 
socialite, a flutterhead,  a bitch on wheels., and wise.</P>
<P>The movie is, in part, about Harper's belated (she'll be 21 in a few 
months) coming of age. Now she is thinking of moving out and having 
her own small apartment near Connie's. He counters with "this is no 
time to go" adding that in five years' time she will know when that 
time comes. Nonetheless, Harper returns to her parents' home. At the 
dinner table, Deborah has the cowed group (her husband, two daughters 
and son-in-law) play a perverted fame involving fortune cookies. The 
young woman has had it. She returns to Connie who is throwing a 
surprise party for her 21st birthday. It is a bohemian affair, in 
which the various types seem to be as dull and stereotyped as the 
buttoned-up bourgeois.</P>
<P>Some time passes. The movie, neutral until now, takes a serious, sad 
swerve. Connie has to be hospitalized for detoxification. (We knew he 
was a hard drinker but the movie had not warned us that he was an 
alcoholic). More bad news: Connie is also broke. The couple drive 
from San Francisco to Los Angeles where he hopes to sell some 
pictures. Humiliation sets in when he has to get a handout from an 
old friend,. It increases when soon after, Connie, looking his age, 
loses some false teeth while eating. To pay the dentist they pawn his 
Nikon camera (there is abundant product placement for this brand 
throughout). In a motel room, he sends out Harper to buy booze. What 
follows should evoke in  cinephile minds a variant of "A Star is 
Born." It is not, however, the end. This comes four years later, when 
Harper, now a successful photographer, returns to the dying Connie, 
joining a quartet of former lovers and at the very end describing 
death to the man via a montage of fantasies. Both sequences are 
corny, dumb  stuff that goes against the movie's realism.</P>
<P>Technical credits are good. The principals' performances are 
convincing, credible (except for a silly, too-young number of Connie 
on a rooftop), and  Stephen Rea handles ably a non-Irish accent : I 
heard just one brief Irish lilt in his intonation.</P>
<P>The main supporting role, of Billie (Gina Gershon, whose small part 
in the recent "The Insider" was memorable) is underwritten. The rest 
of the characters are insignificant sub-supporters.</P>
<P>Guinevere is the name the photographer gives all his mistresses. The 
why of it escapes me. I see no connection to King Arthur's wife 
Guinevere, or to Sir Lancelot, her lover.</P>
<P>The movie is the first one directed by Audrey Wells, the writer of 
"The Truth About Cats and Dogs." It makes its points, several of them 
sharp, others rather vague. I wonder what was the input, if any,  of 
its army of producers (see the credits above).</P>
