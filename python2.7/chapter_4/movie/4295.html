<PRE>                                RAM SHRASTA
                       A film review by Sajida Mahdi
                        Copyright 1995 Sajida Mahdi</PRE>
<P>     I was going to see RAM SHRASTA on the big screen last night, but
before that I stopped into my video store to rent some movies.
Luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording RAM SHRASTA!  I
knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound
quality, but I couldn't help myself ... I got it.</P>
<P>     Well, after watching it (it indeed was a bad print) I was glad I
didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad
theatre watching a bad movie.</P>
<P>     This movie really sucks.  It had so many inconsistencies it was
driving me CRAZY!!  For example, how can Jackie Shroff grow two feet of
hair in just three or four days?  Jackie Shroff looked really stupid
with his Steven Seagal ponytail.  The songs are bad, the acting is bad
(especially Deepti Bhatnagar's), and the direction is the worst of
all.  The comedy scenes with Jagdish and Johnny Lever just made me want
to throw up.</P>
<PRE>     I didn't even finish the movie ... I couldn't take it anymore.</PRE>
<P>NOTE: But if anyone out there liked AATISH (by the same director), I
guess you'd like this movie.  It's practically the same except that
Sanjay Dutt is replaced with Jackie Shroff.  Aditya Panscholi is the
sidekick again.</P>
<PRE>Rating: 1/2 star (out of 5 stars)</PRE>
<P>     (I was going to give it a zero, but I personally like Jackie
Shroff, so I loosened up a little.  He looked fresh, wore good clothes
(as always), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was
the only saving grace of the movie)</P>
