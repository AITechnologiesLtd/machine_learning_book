<PRE>                          DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS
                       A film review by S. Elkins
                        Copyright 1995 S. Elkins</PRE>
<P>DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS:  Detective thriller in 1948 LA, based on a
book I haven't read.</P>
<P>Plot Kickoff:  Easy Rollins takes a job to find a white woman who's
gone missing.</P>
<P>Characters/Acting:  Denzel Washington is convincing as Easy; his
transition from a mild-mannered guy through anger and frustration make
his later actions convincing.  He also does a great job playing the
humor, and there is a lot of humor in this movie, straight so it shines
through.  Jennifer Beals (FLASHDANCE, THE BRIDE (opposite Sting as
Victor Frankenstein)) is fine as the woman on the run.  Mouse, Easy's
dangerous friend, is played by whoever plays the district attorney on
PICKET FENCES.  If they make a sequel I hope he's in it too.</P>
<P>Cinematography:  I liked the title sequence a lot, shot against a
painting (moving over the different scenes of the neighborhood in the
painting).  Still, as far as the picture goes, I think the big screen
isn't a must, if you want to wait to rent.</P>
<P>Sound/Score:  On the other hand, the great jazz soundtrack would lose
out unless you have a really good sound system attached to your TV.</P>
<P>Skin/situations:  Actually not that much skin per se, but there is an
earthy (and funny) sex scene.</P>
<P>Violence:  Yep.  Certainly not the most violent or gory I've seen in
the past few months, though.</P>
<P>Language:  Racial slurs, other profanity.</P>
<P>Analysis:  I really liked this movie.  The main character was smart
enough to put the puzzle pieces together (most of 'em, anyway), and I
liked the themes of loyalty, friendship, and community that kept coming
up.  There was more to this thriller than just the surface plot, and
yet it wasn't burdened by a lot of heavy-handed social commentary
either.</P>
