<PRE>Space Cowboys (2000)</PRE>
<P>Some movies you go to see for the special effects or plot. SPACE COWBOYS you 
go to see for the actors.</P>
<P>The old factotum Clint Eastwood produced and directed this one.  He also 
stars as Frank Corvin, a man who has been frustrated since 1958 when the Air 
Force turned American space missions over to the newly-formed NASA, and 
Frank and his three pilot cronies were replaced by a chimp, the first warm 
body to reach space for this country.</P>
<P>So here's the deal:  Corvin was not only a brilliant flyer but also a 
brilliant engineer.  He happened to design a guidance system that somehow 
made its way into a Soviet satellite.  When the satellite's orbit begins to 
degenerate, officials at NASA ask Corvin to train young astronauts so that 
they might capture the satellite with a space shuttle's arm, repair the 
satellite and set it back in orbit.  Why not let the satellite burn up upon 
reentry, or land in the sea?  This is a mystery until late in the story.</P>
<P>Complicating matters, NASA project manager Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) was 
the nasty boss who fired the crew forty years ago, and he is still around to 
aggravate Frank today.  When Frank demands that the original foursome be 
allowed to complete the mission themselves, Gerson agrees;  his agenda of 
course is to have his men trained, and then to dump Frank and his fellow 
oldsters.</P>
<P>The storyline immediately brings the plot of ARMAGEDDON to mind.  Instead of 
a crew of young and wild oil drillers, we have these vintage flyboys, but 
the premise follows them through similar episodes:  Frank goes to the 
various residences of Tank Sullivan (James Garner), Jerry O'Nell (Donald 
Sutherland) and Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), and he does not have much 
trouble in persuading them to want to blast off.  Then we follow the guys 
through training and testing, the hype around the mission growing and making 
it virtually impossible to throw the old men out on their wrinkled duffs.</P>
<P>The movie has its share of bad science, though it does not match the 
absurdity of ARMAGEDDON.  In fact, the premise of an unlikely crew making it 
into space is as far as the similarities reach.  SPACE COWBOYS is missing 
the frenetic music-video pace of director Michael Bay.  Here Eastwood 
ignores briskness in favor of character development, and because he has 
gathered actors of such maturity, he succeeds in crafting some very engaging 
relationships.  This over-the-hill gang is simply the best thing about the 
movie, and the main reason for viewing it.</P>
<P>Eastwood is big enough as an actor to fool around with self-parody, 
squinting his eyes and never backing down from a fight.  He also refrains 
from taking too much screen time for himself.  His Frank is bent on reaching 
his dream of outer space, but ultimately not at the expense of his friends.</P>
<P>Hawk serves as the focal point of the four.  He's the only one who seems 
reluctant to mount the mission, though he quickly shows up to drink with his 
old buddies and confirm he'll indeed go.  Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor 
here who is too young (53) to have piloted experimental planes in the late 
1950's, but he still does a convincing job.  His wife has died of cancer, 
and Hawk slowly grows involved with Sarah (Marcia Gay Harden), another NASA 
official.  The romantic interest of the film, this relationship never fully 
develops, though touches us with moments conveyed by solid acting.</P>
<P>Tank Sullivan has been a Baptist minister; we see him in his pulpit 
delivering an Old Testament lineage, when suddenly he spots Frank in the 
congregation, and embarks upon a story that apparently was the highest point 
his life will ever attain – about young men coursing through the blue 
yonder.  Except when he intones the first words of a Catholic prayer, Garner 
is very good in the role of Tank, though it is the smallest supporting role.</P>
<P>Donald Sutherland's character Jerry is supposed to be the ladies' man of the 
bunch, though we see him only once with a younger woman, hanging around the 
roller coaster he has designed for a large amusement park.  Like Eastwood, 
Sutherland is strong at not upstaging those he shares the screen with.</P>
<P>The senior ensemble can go only so far in affecting the film's quality.  
Though most of Eastwood's pictures are known for their clipped and clever 
dialogue, this one becomes hokey near the end, especially when Frank orders 
his mates to bail out of a damaged shuttle, and Tank replies with `We're 
staying.'  Oh, and the climax is not as weak as that of ARMAGEDDON or the 
more recent MISSION TO MARS, but it's close.</P>
<P>The final word about SPACE COWBOYS is that it's light but fun summer 
entertainment.  It won't be taking home loads of awards, but it's a good 
showcase for some leading men turned character actors, and come to think of 
it, the special effects are not bad either.</P>
