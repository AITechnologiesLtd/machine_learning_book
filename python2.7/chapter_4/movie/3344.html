<PRE>                         THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a moody Irish children's
          fantasy written and directed by John Sayles.  A
          ten-year-old girl goes to live with her fisherman
          grandfather's family and discovers her family
          traditions tied in with mythical selkies.  The
          photography is moody, but the story and the cold,
          wet landscapes are hard to warm up to.  Some nice
          animal photography also sets the scene.  Rating:
          low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The scene is an Irish fishing village in the late 1940s, and this
is the sort of story that might be told to children around the hearth.
Fiona (played by Jeni Courtney) goes to live with her grandparents so
she can get away from the city and so that her father can devote his
time to drinking.  There, amid the gulls and the fish and the seals,
she hears mysterious folktales of her family history, especially the
story that one of her relatives had really been a selkie.  A selkie, in
Irish tradition, is a seal who can turn into a human.  The "dark ones"
of her family are really just showing more of their seal heritage.  And
there is the tale of Fiona's own brother who was washed out to sea ina
boat-shaped cradle, but who some say is occasionally still seen.  Fiona
hears the folk stories from her grandfather (Mile Lally) and other
members of her family--"superstition" her grandmother (Eileen Colgan)
calls the stories.  But they send Fiona's imagination racing and the
somber, wet landscapes under what always seems an overcast sky (even
when it looks blue) only set the mood for the mystical and the
supernatural.  Before she is done Fiona's own experience will make for
a new tale to join the others.</P>
<P>     In Ireland this may well work as a family film, but it is a little
hard for American children to follow.  The Irish-American co-production
is written and directed by John Sayles in a style very different from
his MATEWAN or his EIGHT MEN OUT or just about anything else that
Sayles has done.  Sayles has taken as his source Rosalie K. Fry's
children's novel SECRET OF THE RON MOR SKERRY.  Indeed, in the United
States some children will enjoy this film, but the thick, sometimes
impenetrable, Irish accents and the generally somber tone and
photography may make this a children's film that can be appreciated
only by adults.</P>
<P>     Much of the interest value of the film is in its portrait of
fishing village life in Ireland.  The simple hearthside diet of fish
and soup in the thatched houses, the hard work on the fishing boats and
on the shore, and the eternal gray skies combine to make a portrait
that is bleak, but well-observed.  Sayles takes his time telling his
story as a combination of Fiona's experiences and a mosaic of the
stories told to Fiona.  Apparently this structure is hard on some
children.  Several of the children in our audience had to have the plot
details explained to them by parents who were probably having some
problems themselves, at least with the accents.</P>
<P>     Fiona is played by Jeni Courtney who seems already accomplished as
an actress in spite of her young age.  Lally and Colgan are each
enjoyable to watch in each's own way.  Veteran cinematographer Haskell
Wexler has managed some nice animal photography.  Irish music also
helps to set the feel of the film.  Not a bad film, but the story is a
little slow and unambitious.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
