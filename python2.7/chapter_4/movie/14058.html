<P>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:52 / 1998 / R (sexuality, language)
Cast: Jennifer Aniston; Paul Rudd; Alan Alda; John Pankow; Tim Daly; 
Nigel Hawthorne; Allison Janney; Amo Gulinello; Steve Zahn 
Director: Nicholas Hytner 
Screenplay: Wendy Wasserstein<HR>The girls of "Friends" have made some very wise big-screen choices, 
establishing the beginnings of fine film careers for themselves should 
that hit sitcom of theirs ever tank. Courteney Cox's flashy turns in 
"Scream" and "Scream 2" won her raves, Lisa Kudrow's dumb blonde act fit 
"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion" impeccably, and Jennifer 
Aniston's "Picture Perfect," while not as solid as her female co-stars' 
works, was agreeable, amusing fluff. But Aniston now joins their level 
with "The Object of My Affection," a tidy little romantic comedy-drama 
that's poignant, entertaining and, for the most part, pretty believable. 
In short, it's on a higher plane than the cookie-cutter, frothy fluff 
pieces that we've seen before, occasionally with other "Friends."</P>
<P>Aniston plays Nina Borowski, a New York social worker who strikes up an 
immediate friendship with gay schoolteacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd) 
when they meet at a dinner party one night. During the course of the 
evening, George's self-centered college professor lover (Tim Daly) dumps 
him for a student, so Nina offers the spare bedroom in her Brooklyn 
apartment to George. He graciously accepts, and the living situation 
seems ideal; even Nina's lawyer boyfriend Vince ("Mad About You"'s John 
Pankow) takes a liking to George. But before long, Nina unexpectedly 
finds herself amorously attracted to her roommate, and makes a surprise 
decision that puts a kink in her dilapidating relationship with Vince. </P>
<P>A large part of "Object"'s success is due to the performances of and 
chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. Because there's quite 
a bit of emotional weight in the story, Aniston's required to show 
range, and that she does; those who think of her only as her indecisive 
"Friends" alter-ego might be surprised. Rudd ("Clueless") exudes 
bonafide charm -- he plays George as a three-dimensional person, not a 
two-dimensional stereotype. Director Nicholas Hytner, best known for 
"The Madness of King George" and "The Crucible," also deserves some of 
the credit. His genuine knack for depicting character dynamics -- watch 
"The Crucible"'s Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen and take notes -- 
certainly doesn't hinder either actor, letting "The Object of My 
Affection" come off with a central relationship that's downright 
electric. </P>
<P>Despite these strengths, the story sometimes becomes a little hard to 
swallow in its dealings with vaguely-rendered Vince. Though ably 
performed by Pankow, Vince never quite turns into the superficial jerk 
that he at first seems to be, but, since he is a major participant in 
the film's conflict-heavy plot, matters would have improved if we were 
allowed to get to know him a little better; I questioned a few of his 
actions and reactions because I wasn't quite sure what was going on in 
his head. Some could also dismiss "The Object of My Affection" as too 
pat and sunny, but I think it's less that than the movie never loses 
sight -- even in its heavier moments -- of its upbeat cheerfulness. Pat, 
perhaps, but it's not contrived or manipulative like most romantic 
comedies. </P>
<P>A happy ending (but not the one you might expect) allows a few 
reassuring answers to those tough questions posed by the movie, thus 
capping off its satisfying meditation on the obstacles -- be they sexual 
orientation, heartfelt emotion or whatever -- that can affect platonic 
companionship for better or worse. And to further illustrate the 
importance of having friends, the filmmakers have gone one step further 
than just hiring one; they've widened their playing field to incorporate 
several priceless supporting roles, the apex of which is a sad theatre 
critic (Nigel Hawthorne, whom Hytner directed in "King George") who acts 
as a world-weary foil for Nina. Due in part to this nifty, 
character-emphasized focus, "Object" is more than worthy of its 
audience's affection.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"As my colleague Gene Siskel observed, ‘If the third reel had been the 
missing footage from Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons," this 
movie still would have sucked.' I could not have put it better myself."
