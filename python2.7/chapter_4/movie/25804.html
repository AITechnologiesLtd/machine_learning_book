BRING IT ON
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>"You want it.  I'm hot.  I'm everything you're not," cheerleader captain 
Torrance 'Tor' Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) leads her team in the opening 
cheer in Peyton Reed's BRING IT ON.  Soon thereafter, Tor raises her 
arms to the sky and accidentally drops her top in front of a gym full of 
stunned onlookers.  (We see her from the back.)</P>
<P>With this promising start, the film looked to be another sassy and 
raunchy spoof à la DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, which skewered the world of 
beauty pageants.  The hilarious DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, which also starred 
Dunst, was one of last year's most underrated comedies.  BRING IT ON, 
however, quickly goes downhill, taking itself too seriously and ladling 
on every cliché in the screenwriter's manual.  </P>
<P>There is a good boy, Cliff Pantone (Jesse Bradford), who is smitten by 
Tor.  She, of course, loves someone else, who is unworthy of her 
affection.  Tor has a smart-aleck brother who is part of her sitcom 
family.  Besides taunting her verbally, her brother jumps in the air so 
that he can break wind right in front of her face.  </P>
<P>Jessica Bendinger's script is rampant with homophobic humor.  "Are you 
trying to tell me that you speak fag?" inquires cheerleader Missy 
Pantone (Eliza Dushku) of her fellow cheerleader, Les (Huntley Ritter).  
"Oh, fluently," Les says with raised eyebrows and a slight roll of his 
eyes.  Whenever the script can't think of anything else humorous, it 
punctuates its sentences with homosexual epithets, figuring its audience 
will always find the word "fag" funny.  </P>
<P>The biggest cliché of all involves the poor black school, Clover, across 
the tracks.  The story's big scandal is that Tor's wealthy school, 
Rancho Carne, stole their cheerleading routine from Clover, a little 
known fact.  Rancho Carne is vying for its sixth national cheerleading 
championship in a row, and the Clovers look to be the squad to beat this 
year.  Poor and willing to lose rather than accept "any handouts", the 
Clovers, nevertheless, appeal to an Oprah-style TV host for funds to 
travel to the nationals.  Their mawkish letter to the host starts, 
"Where we're from, 'cheer' isn't a word you hear often."</P>
<P>There is the obligatory tryout scene in which people do just about 
everything but act like would-be cheerleaders.  Not one of these 
auditions is cute or original.  The movie ends with dull outtakes that 
are so clearly preprogrammed that they aren't really outtakes at all.</P>
<P>Every now and then, the story does have its moments.  Flirting with 
Cliff in the stands at a football game, Tor is accused of having cheer 
sex with him.  You know, like phone sex.  No sooner has the writer 
introduced the idea than she drops it entirely.</P>
<P>At other times, the cheerleaders start to get a little bawdy, but the 
camera cuts away quickly.  The few cheerleading sequences in THE 
REPLACEMENTS are better that all of BRING IT ON.  The former are 
unpretentiously funny, whereas BRING IT ON seems so embarrassed by its 
own basic material that it has to mix in everything from vomit sequences 
to pseudo racial conflicts.</P>
<P>In a movie in which little is fresh, there is one scene which doesn't 
feel borrowed from a dozen other pictures.  With mouths full of 
toothpaste, Tor and Cliff compete at the sink for shiniest teeth and 
most vigorous spitting.  Now that's certainly the start of a romance 
made in heaven.</P>
<P>BRING IT ON runs 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for sex-related material and 
language and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.</P>
