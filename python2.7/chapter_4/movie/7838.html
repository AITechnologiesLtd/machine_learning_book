<P>     Finally, the entire Barrytown Trilogy has made it to the screen.  
The process started back in 1991, when Alan Parker made THE COMMITMENTS.  
It continued in '93, when Stephen Frears filmed THE SNAPPER.  Now, with 
the addition of 1996's THE VAN, also from Frears, author Roddy Doyle's 
entire three-book series exists in cinematic form.  And the link that 
binds them together is actor Colm Meaney, the best thing about any of 
the movies.  Meaney's performance is especially noteworthy in THE VAN, 
where he's one of the few things worth watching during the draggy final 
thirty minutes. </P>
<P>     THE VAN, which is a reasonably simple story about a couple of 
unemployed men opening a rolling fish-and-chip shop, is a tale of two 
halves.  The first half is an engaging, and at times lively, comedy 
about friendship and finding meaning in good, honest work.  It's about 
the benefits of regaining one's self-respect, and how that affects both 
the individual and the family.  And, best of all, the early portions of 
THE VAN boast quite a few effective comic moments that work because the 
characters seem real.  These aren't just cardboard cut-out Irishmen -- 
they're a couple of likable guys who are easy to root for. </P>
<P>     Then, somewhere around THE VAN's halfway point, everything starts 
to go wrong.  The easygoing tone dissipates, and is replaced by 
something far less comfortable.  The film loses its way.  The humor 
becomes half-hearted and obligatory.  Cliches and tediousness rise to 
the fore, culminating in an ending that can only be described as jaw-
droppingly stupid.  This is the kind of conclusion that stands out as a 
hard-to-swallow writer's construct.  It's a sad way for a motion picture 
that started out with promise to crash land. </P>
<P>     The film opens with the woebegone Bimbo (Donal O'Kelly) literally 
crying into his beer.  After twenty-five years of loyal service, he has 
been laid off.  Now, all he has to look forward to are endless 
afternoons of golf (a game he hates) and watching game shows like "Where 
in the World?"  His best mate, Larry (Colm Meaney) is an old hand at 
being unemployed.  Even though he doesn't much like it, he hasn't worked 
in a long time.  But, while Larry has gotten used to doing nothing all 
day, Bimbo can't take it, and he hatches a scheme to buy an old van to 
use as a fish-and-chip shop.  Once he has picked out the perfect vehicle 
(filthy, engine-less, and dirt cheap), he invites Larry to come on board 
with him fifty/fifty.  With Ireland's unexpectedly good performance in 
World Cup soccer, Bimbo believes that parking the van outside a bar 
where people hang out to watch the games should provide a solid customer 
base. </P>
<P>     On the acting side, no one comes close to Meaney in this film.  His 
co-star, Donal O'Kelly, is okay, but lacks the screen presence to stand 
toe-to-toe with him.  O'Kelly's best scenes are those with his wife and 
kids, when there's no sign of Meaney.  In supporting roles, Ger Ryan 
(who appeared in THE COMMITMENTS) and Caroline Rothwell are solid as the 
wives, and Neili Conroy and Ruaidhri Conroy add a little spark as 
Larry's kids.  Both Conroys, unlike O'Kelly, can hold their own. </P>
<P>     Three years ago, Frears did a wonderful job with THE SNAPPER, and, 
for a while, it appears he is going to repeat his success here.  But, 
although I know what goes wrong with THE VAN, I'm not sure why it 
happens.  Perhaps there just isn't enough story to sustain a full-length 
feature.  Or maybe the episodic structure of the film wears out its 
welcome.  Either way, the result is that watching THE VAN is like 
sitting through two completely different movies -- one is a great deal 
of fun and the other isn't worth the price of admission.  Unfortunately, 
unless you walk out, you have to accept the latter to get the former. </P>
