<PRE>KISS THE GIRLS (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Kiss the Girls is not quite SE7EN, but not quite bad either. Kiss the Girls
is a good serial killer movie that entertains for two hours.</P>
<P>After seeing the previews, I thought Kiss the Girls might be a blatant
rip-off of SE7EN. It has Morgan Freeman, who was in SE7EN and it has an
intelligent serial killer whose identity is not known. Also, it is a movie,
like SE7EN, that is more interested in why the killer is doing what he is
doing more than about catching the killer. Catching the killer is only the
means of driving the movie forward.</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman is Dr. Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist. He finds himself
going to Durham, North Carolina to help out on an abduction case, the
abducted happens to be his niece. What he finds when he gets there is that
his niece is only one of many girls kidnapped by a serial rapist and killer
who calls himself Casanova. Ashley Judd is Kate McTiernan the only woman to
escape from Casanova (she knows kickboxing). Together Cross and McTiernan
go on the hunt for Casanova.</P>
<P>The movie is somewhat predictable. The most predictable is the identity of
Casanova, whom I guessed correctly after the credits finished. (Director
Gary Fleder should have taken note that David Fincher chose to not include
the name of the actor portraying the serial killer in SE7EN during the
opening credits). By the time the end rolls around, Fleder throws the
audience a fake bone to try to trick us into thinking that Casanova is
someone else, but it doesn't work.</P>
<P>It is quite easy to think that a comparison can be drawn between Kiss the
Girls and SE7EN, but the differences are there. Here's some: the ending to
SE7EN was quite a surprise and quite shocking. The ending to Kiss the Girls
is of the standard Hollywood fare. John Doe in SE7EN had a clear-cut
purpose for what he was doing. Doe had a message that he was preaching.
Casanova has a purpose to his madness also, but it is not so clear.
Casanova does spread the word of what he does, but he has no message that
he wants to preach. Though Director Fleder handles the director's duties
just fine, he doesn't come close to making the film look as good as Fincher
does.</P>
<P>With all this said, Kiss the Girls in the end is entertaining. This is
because of the great performances by the two leads. Freeman is always a
command presence on screen, and that does not change here with Kiss the
Girls. His performance is intense. Judd adds yet another great performance
to her list of great performances. She does very well in Kiss the Girls.</P>
<P>Though not as good as SE7EN, which Kiss the Girls will inevitably be
compared to, Kiss the Girls is nonetheless entertaining. It has its
frightening moments and its share of action. And it comes as a fairly
interesting film about a serial killer. This is a Don't Miss film, though
see it at a matinee showing. </P>
