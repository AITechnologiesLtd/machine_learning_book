<PRE>Rules of Engagement</PRE>
<PRE>by Max Messier

<P>The best thing about being a critic is getting to see unreleased films
weeks and sometimes months before the general audience does.  The
toughest thing about being a critic is being subjected to the waste
products of the movie industry, run by conglomerates that wouldn't know
a Cronenberg film from a bottle of Heineken.</P>
<P>Rules of Engagement is one of these waste products: pulling together a
great cast, a great story idea, and a great director, then letting it
all fall apart into a mess of things I wouldn't even blame Joel
Schumacher for.</P>
<P>The movie revolves around the trial of an accused Army officer (Samuel
Jackson) trying to subdue an attack on the US Embassy in Yemen, but who
ends up quelling the dispute by having his men fire into the crowd of
demonstrators.  All evidence that would justify his actions becomes MIA,
and he calls upon his friend and fellow comrade-in-arms, Tommy Lee
Jones, to defend him.  Jones complies out of a sense of honor, because
during a tour in ‘Nam, Jackson saved Jones' ass during a VC ambush.
Soon, everything turns against Jackson and his defense team, and then
the movie runs through about three or four different plot twists stolen
from such films as The Verdict, The Rainmaker, A Few Good Men, and
Courage Under Fire.  In the end, I was clawing at my seat, wanting to
run home and watch a decent film to remind myself why I like movies in
the first place.</P>
<P>Strangely, all the elements of the film were there.  It starts with a
great cast of Tommy Lee Jones, Sam Jackson, Guy Pearce (doing his best
De Niro impression), Philip Baker Hall, Ben Kingsley, Anne Archer, and
Kim Delaney.  Running the show is the great William Friedkin, of such
films as The Exorcist, French Connection, and To Live and Die in L.A.
There's a compelling story of a man's defense of his honor and the
comrades compelled the stand by him to defend said honor.  A background
littered with the conflict of war and the regrets of past defeats.  How
can you screw that up?</P>
<P>Well, you just can.  The film is flawed on many fronts:  The horrible
miscasting of Guy Pearce as a Brooklyn Navy lawyer "just trying to get
to the truth of things."  A ridiculous courtroom scene that had me
waiting for someone to scream, "You can't handle the truth!"  Choppy
direction, which feels like Friedkin was running the show at first but
then an assistant director took the helm.  The underdeveloped characters
of Jones and Jackson.  Any semblance of "acting."  And a really, really
bad ending that tells us sickly that the brutality of war is
justifiable.</P>
<P>The shoulders that carry most of the blame are the screenwriters, who
failed to piece together anything resembling a cohesive plot.  To wit,
two rules should be followed in the future whenever a studio is
considering to greenlighting a film. 1) Do not hire a former Secretary
of the U.S. Navy to write the screenplay. 2) Shy away from accepting
scripts from one of the uncredited screenwriters of I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer.</P>
