<P>"Mrs. Brown" is one of the years best films; a charming, unconventional 
love story that is refreshing and utterly captivating. The film deals 
with the British monarchy, but rest assured, this is not one of those 
slow, staid period films. Rather, "Mrs. Brown" is a warm, graceful and 
often funny portrait of two very striking individuals.</P>
<P>Set in 1864, "Mrs. Brown" introduces us to a deeply depressed Queen 
Victoria. Three years after the death of her husband, the Queen (Judi 
Dench) is still mourning, forcing her family and staff to share her 
seclusion in Windsor. She adheres to her daily routine religiously, 
seeing no one but servants and relatives and avoiding all political 
matters. She wraps her depression around her like a comforter. Of course 
she's miserable, but it's a familiar misery, and that familiarity offers 
some solace. The staff, dreadfully tired of being "prisoners of the 
Queen's grief" and fearful of the political ramifications of her 
isolation, send for John Brown (Billy Connolly), the Highland equestrian 
caretaker of her Scottish retreat in Balmoral. Their hope is that Brown, 
a friend of her late husband's, can at least get her outside for periodic 
horse rides, a potential first step towards emergence from her self-
imposed isolation.</P>
<P>Brown arrives at Windsor and makes an immediate impression. The brash 
Scotsman has his own ideas of how things should be done and refuses to 
let propriety stop him from speaking his mind. During their first meeting,
 he looks at her with alarm, stating "You look terrible, woman!" The 
Queen and staff are horrified at his impudence, but in short order, 
Victoria warms to Brown's bold, protective manner. The two become fast 
friends, with an unspoken, but obvious love that prompts scandalous talk 
in the sexually repressed nation. Victoria is soon dubbed "Mrs. Brown" by 
political wags, while the nation speculates on the true nature of the 
Queen's shocking relationship with this commoner.</P>
<P>The story, a blend of facts and speculation, allows director John Madden 
to present a detailed portrait of the era, while shrewdly satirizing the 
politics and manners of the time. But far more important is the 
extraordinary character study of Queen Victoria and John Brown. Dench and 
Connolly are magnificent, a wonderfully mismatched couple with amazing 
chemistry. Connolly is a marvel; a swaggering bull of a man who takes 
guff from no one. He speaks when he wants, drinks when he wants and is 
utterly devoted to her majesty. His impudent remarks, and the stunned 
reaction of the staff and family, provide some of the film's funniest 
moments. Dench is equally impressive as Queen Victoria. She is 
convincingly regal, yet totally human; a haughty, incredibly proper 
monarch who wants to savor life, but has no idea how to go about it. </P>
<P>The pairing of Connolly and Dench is sheer magic and deserves to be 
rewarded when the Oscar nominations roll around. Watching Victoria 
blossom through Brown's loving ministrations is exhilarating. One of the 
film's best scenes comes when Brown spirits Victoria away to visit a poor 
couple in the Highlands. The interactions between the four during their 
evening together leaves the viewer with an almost giddy feeling. The 
Queen's subsequent emergence from her shell is invigorating, a triumph of 
love and the human spirit over societal oppression. Director Madden also 
draws fine performances from the supporting cast, particularly Anthony 
Sher as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Achingly beautiful Scottish 
locations are used to great effect in conjunction with an excellent 
musical score. In fact, the film's only problem is that it had to come to 
an end.</P>
<P>So what was the true nature of Victoria and John Brown's relationship. 
We'll never know for sure, but consider this. Following Brown's death, 
Victoria maintained his room in pristine condition and placed a flower on 
his pillow every day until her death 18 years later. At her request, she 
was buried with his photograph in her hand. Draw your own conclusions and 
don't miss this jewel of a movie.</P>

<PRE>MRS. BROWN
Billy Connolly, Judi Dench
Rated PG, 4 and one half stars</PRE>
<P>One of the years best films; a charming, unconventional love story that 
is refreshing and utterly captivating. Set in 1864, a Highland equestrian 
(Billy Connolly) is summoned to serve a gravely depressed Queen Victoria 
(Judi Dench). Dench and Connolly are magnificent, a wonderfully 
mismatched couple with amazing chemistry. Rest assured, this is not one 
of those slow, staid period films. Rather, "Mrs. Brown" is a warm, 
graceful and often funny portrait of two very striking individuals.</P>
<PRE>AIR FORCE ONE
Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close
Rated R, 3 and one half stars</PRE>
<P>The President's plane is hijacked by terrorists in this entertaining "Die 
Hard" clone. The combination of extremely well-detailed lead characters 
and a constantly escalating sense of tension is what makes "Air Force 
One" succeed. Director Wolfgang Petersen is very good at creating winning 
action/thrillers out of preposterous scripts. "Air Force One" has holes 
in logic large enough to fly a plane through, but Petersen spins the tale 
so well that ultimately, it doesn't matter. Ford makes a great President 
and Oldman is effective as a Russian zealot.</P>
<PRE>FEMALE PERVERSIONS
Tina Swinton, Amy Madigan, Paulina Porizkova
Rated R, 4 stars.</PRE>
<P>Swinton plays a young lawyer on the fast track to success who becomes 
plagued with anxiety and misgivings, made worse by the arrest of her 
sister (Madigan). The film's fantasy sequences leave much to be desired, 
but the powerfully acted story effectively addresses fundamental 
questions about family, sex, and a woman's place in contemporary society.</P>
<PRE>GOOD BURGER
Kel Mitchell, Kenan Thompson, Sinbad, Abe Vigoda
Rated PG, 2 stars</PRE>
<P>Kiddie flick from Nickelodeon tells of two amiable goofballs and their 
misadventures in the fast food world. War erupts between the staff of 
Good Burger and rivals at the evil Mondo Burger that opens across the 
street. Adults will be bored silly, but the little ones should enjoy the 
familiar antics of Mitchell and Thompson.</P>
