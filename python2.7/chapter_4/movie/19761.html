<P>Born on the Fourth of July
Directed by Oliver Stone
Starring Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgewick, Willem Dafoe
USA, 1989
Rated R (realistic war violence, sex, and strong pervasive language)</P>
<P>The protagonist of Oliver Stone's biopic Born on the Fourth of July is
Ron Kovic, a man disillusioned by dreams of heroism, maimed at war, and
determined at making something of himself after part of him is lost
forever.  The movie has faults- it sometimes loses sight of what it
wants the audience to feel- but it is a strong film nonetheless: more
profound than Stone's earlier Vietnam epic Platoon and focused more on
one person than the other film, which is vaster.  However, despite what
you may have heard about Tom Cruise's performance, it is not an
improvement from his Rain Man-Top Gun shtick.  His is not bad acting in
this film, but it's nothing special- it's low on the depth and heavy on
false emotion.  (His first piece of great acting was in Jerry Maguire,
seven years later.)</P>
<P>Born on the Fourth of July follows Ron Kovic on his journey to
realization- the realization of the horrors of war.  As a kid, he is
fascinated with war and fighting and heroism and as a teenager, he feels
a need to be "somebody", a hero, a "man".  Tom Berenger plays a
stoneish, firm Marine corps recruiter who tries to convince Ron's high
school's men to be masculine and join the Marines- go to war,
basically.  For Ron, it is the final push that determines his destiny-
he will join the Marines, go to war and be a celebrated veteran.  He has
no idea what the Vietnam War is about, he doesn't want to experience the
violence of it, but he wants to be a "man" and he wants to prove
himself.  His parents encourage him to go but we see that he is still
looking for the right direction.  He is sure he wants to join the
Marines, yet he is doubtful of what it will bring him.  He prays to God
to show him the right way.</P>
<P>When he goes to Vietnam, he is immediately faced with an attack.  He
mistakenly attacks the homes of women and children and he accidentally,
in the bitter confusion of it all, kills a young man on his side.  Then,
he is shot in the leg.  Is this the price you have to pay for heroism?
He is now regretful that he ever decided to go to war.  He is crammed
into a rat-infested, non-hygienic hospital where he is mutilated,
becomes paralyzed, and is put in a wheelchair.  Oliver Stone spares us
nothing in his images of the hospital.  It is a disgusting place to be,
the pinnacle of filth.  It made me cringe.  All the while, Ron Kovic is
desperately trying to piece it all together- he's gone to war, he's lost
his manhood and the ability to walk, he is filthy and sweating, and no
one recognizes that he is the "hero" that he is.  What's the payoff?</P>
<P>When he returns home to his parents' house, everyone looks at him with
"I'm so sorry" looks and everyone speaks in "I'm so sorry" tones.  This
is not what he wanted.  He wanted his parents to hold him up like a
trophy, he wanted people to recognize what he did for his country.
Instead, he gets a bathroom specially designed for his disability.
There are now hippie anti-war activists around.  Ron believes what he
did was good and that it proves he loves his country.  He condemns the
activists, saying they can "love [their country] or leave it."  He wants
to justify the pain of the war by upholding it.  He still doesn't even
know what  it was all about.  He still carries the wait of the guilt of
killing the Vietnamese women and babies and a man on his platoon.</P>
<P>Ron's high school sweetheart (Kyra Sedgewick) is one of the many
activists and she tries to convince him that war is no good. He begins
to believe her.  He goes on vacation in Mexico where he fools around
with prostitutes to fulfill his emptiness.  Since the war, he has
changed.  He doesn't know what he wants- he knows it was his decision to
go to war, but he is thirsty for honor, fame, and recognition.  The
film's aim is often blurry at this point.  We realize that it wants a
lot from us: first it wants us to cheer for Ron who is pursuing his
dreams and going to war, then it asks us to feel sorry for him because
of all the harm war did to him- it also asks us to stand by Ron's
conviction that war is honorable, then it asks us to hate war.</P>
<P>Ron begins to hate war and join political rallies against the Vietnam
War.  First, we feel he is doing it out of compassion for the young,
disillusioned men suffering in Vietnam as he did, but then we realize
his motives are selfish.  He wants to scream to the country, "This is
what happened to me!  Feel sorry for me! Love me!  Give me heroism!"  He
longs to fill his void with something important like these rallies, but
what he says seems to be more of self-pitying talk like "This is what
happened to me!  I had to suffer!"</P>
<P>Tom Cruise's performance is often flat and emotionless.  He seems to
think a great performance lies in amazing, loud outbursts complete with
screaming and swearing.  There have been many great performances that
have indulged in such sequences- his sinks its teeth into fights with
activists, politicians, and his family but it all seems so passionless,
self-indulgent, and almost like showing-off.  Cruise seems to be holding
a contest of who can shout the loudest- if so, he'd probably win.  There
are some good moments but it isn't a really well worked-out performance.</P>
<P>Apart from the flaws, there is the masterful John Williams score, the
interesting, dull-colored photography of Robert Richardson, and a good
story.  The motives are sometimes shifty and the ending is vague but the
movie is like all good anti-war films- showing a man ruined by war and
trying to get back on his feet.</P>
