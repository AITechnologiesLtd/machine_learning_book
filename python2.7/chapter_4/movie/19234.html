<P>Susan Granger's review of "MY SON THE FANATIC" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P> This is an unconventional love story about a Pakistani
immigrant who strays from his wife and the stability of his home when
he falls in love with a British prostitute. But what makes it even
more compelling is that screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful
Laundrette") satirically reverses the conservative, middle-aged
father/freedom-loving son rebellion axiom, giving it an unexpected
twist. Acclaimed Indian actor Om Puri ("Gandhi," "City of Joy") is
superb and utterly convincing as a Scotch-drinking, cricket-loving,
jazz enthusiast who has spent 25 years driving a taxi in industrial
Bradford, England. He is worried about his beloved son (Akbar Kurtha)
who has broken his engagement to the Caucasian daughter of a British
police detective and is selling off his "capitalist pig" possessions
as part of a religious conversion to militant, fundamentalist Islam,
with all of its anti-semitic overtones, in order to find personal
identity after many years of being made to feel like an
outsider. Directed by Udayan Prasad with a cast that includes Rachel
Griffiths (Oscar-nominated for "Hilary and Jackie") and Skellan
Skarsgard ("Good Will Hunting"), the film probes universal conflicts,
using disparate lives to examine the broad moral themes of love versus
duty and happiness versus personal sacrifice - in addition to the
racial and cultural problems inherent in assimilation. It gets a bit
melodramatic towards the conclusion but, on the whole, it's quite
engaging, pursing the point that "After a certain age, there's no
point in saying 'No' to everything."  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, "My Son the Fanatic" is a bittersweet, compassionate 7. It's
engaging, off-beat art house fare but, for those with auditory
problems, it's often difficult to decipher the North London burr and
the Pakistani accent.</P>
