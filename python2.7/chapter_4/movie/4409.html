<PRE>     What is "Jumanji?"</PRE>
<P>     It is a board game.  A board game with supernatural powers.  A
board game that carries a terrible curse.  Those who play it must
complete the game or never see an end to the jungle perils it unleashes
upon them.</P>
<P>     The movie, JUMANJI, starts on a rainy night in 1869 as a pair of
brothers bury a chest a mile outside of a small New Hampshire town.  As
they throw the dirt upon it, jungle drums beat from within the chest,
calling to them.  They persist, but when done, the younger asks the
older, "What if someone else unearths it and plays the game?" The elder
says, "Then may God have mercy upon his soul." [Lightning crash!]</P>
<P>     Flash forward to 1969, when Alan Parrish, a boy of eleven or so,
hears jungle drums at a construction site.  He uncovers the chest and
retrieves Jumanji.  The game is so beautiful - a case of carved wood
and with ivory pawn paths, animal-shaped tokens of carved onyx.  What
kid wouldn't want this game? (See note at end).  He brings it home and
shows it to his friend, Sarah.  They settle in to play the game and
when Alan rolls the dice, he is sucked into Jumanji.</P>
<P>     Flash forward once more to 1995, when Judy and Peter move into the
abandonned Parrish family home.  No sooner do they settle in than they
hear jungle drums coming from the attic.  No sooner do they investigate
the attic than they find themselves playing Jumanji.  The game
unleashes jungle terrors upon them, but it also sets free the vanished
Alan Parrish - who has grown up inside the game.  The three come to
realize the only way to end the madness Jumanji has wrought is to
finish the game that was started 26 years ago.  But that, of course,
means facing all the perils Jumanji has to offer head on.</P>
<P>     (This is a lot more exposition than I normally do, but I found the
trailer confusing when I first saw it and the commercials aren't much
better.  As far as you can tell from them, this movie concerns a wild
man, a board game and animals running amok.)</P>
<PRE>     So what is JUMANJI?</PRE>
<P>     JUMANJI is a demolition derby.  There is more smashing, crashing,
blasting, and crunching in this movie than in any I've seen this year.
The utter mayhem of JUMANJI makes SPEED look as if it were directed by
Felix Unger.</P>
<P>     Do you remember those moments in JURASSIC PARK when your mouth
just hung open and your eyes felt like they were coming out of their
sockets?  JUMANJI has a bunch of these (albeit not quite as many).  The
most magnificent was the stampede sequence.  I was prepared to be
unimpressed, but was completely blown away.  You could almost smell the
elephant droppings.</P>
<P>     The sound was critical in working this effect.  Industrial Light
and Magic did a great job spawning a jungle of digital creatures, but I
wasn't as impressed by the cyber-beasts as by the sound design.  If I
may indulge in Oscar speculation at such an early stage, I think
JUMANJI will nab this year's Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing.</P>
<P>     JUMANJI is not a character-driven movie.  There is a dab of
character development thrown in - enough to keep the story from being
flat as a board game.  It is not a movie for small children.  Take kids
six years old or under to JUMANJI and I guarantee they will want to
crawl into bed with mom & dad until they are 18.  There were some kids
in the audience at tonight's screening, and they seemed no worse for
wear, but they all seemed to be eight or older.</P>
<P>     JUMANJI is not an actor's movie, but there were no bad
performances.  Robin Williams plays the grown-up Alan.  Kirsten Dunst
(the vampirette of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE) plays Judy.  Bebe
Neuwirth (Lilith from TV's "Cheers") is Judy and Peter's aunt.  David
Alan Greir (of TV's "In Living Color") plays a cop who's spends the
movie trying to get to the bottom of the weirdness.  And Bonnie Hunt
plays the grown-up Sarah.  Bonnie was the mother in the BEETHOVEN
movies and the best friend to Marisa Tomei's character in ONLY YOU.  I
like her - she's funny.</P>
<P>     JUMANJI draws a lot of laughs both from witty scripting and roller
coaster excitement.  But the emphasis is on the roller coaster.  This
movie is Busch Gardens, not the Comic Strip.</P>
<P>     If you are at all inclined toward seeing this kind of movie, see
it and see it on the big screen - preferably fifth row from the front
in a theatre with digital sound.  You'll have a blast.</P>
<P>Note:
     When I first saw the trailer for JUMANJI, I said to myself, "How
shameless! They're making a movie to promote a new board game.  I
wonder which will be greater, the box office receipts or the toy store
receipts."  But having seen the movie, I now wonder how they expect to
sell the board game?  What good is it if a kid rolls the dice and
nothing comes smashing through the walls?</P>
