<PRE>                       MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD
                     A film review by Too FAT Guys
                      Copyright 1992 by Roger & Me</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  A little less than a month ago, Jon Lovitz practically stole
        the show with his wry, sardonic humor in his bit part in A
        LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN.  In MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD he gets
        top billing.  So, this would be better then, wouldn't it?</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Well, it depends what you mean by "better."  MOM AND DAD SAVE
        THE WORLD is a science-fiction spoof starring Jon Lovitz as
        Tod "The Destroyer" Spengo, ruler of Spengo, Planet of Idiots.
        As Tod, in an effort to placate his inferiority complex,
        prepares to destroy the Earth, he spies Marge Nelson (Terri
        Garr), a middle aged Earth woman.  He falls madly in love with
        Marge and whisks her and her couch-bound husband, Dick (Jeffery
        Jones), off to Spengo.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  From there it degenerates into a typical bad guy wants the good
        guy's woman and tries to do away with the good guy to get her.
        I've seen it done a hundred times before and quite often much
        better.  The movie is obviously supposed to get by on comedic
        twists, not the strength or originality of its plot.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Certainly, this is not an original plot.  All sorts of films
        have used this plot successfully.  And yes, the numerous gags do
        carry the film.  Much like vintage Stooges, many of these gags
        are quite humorous, with a buffoonish brilliance.  I've seen
        Lovitz more "over the top" than in this film, but I think the
        several sub-texts make up for this lack.  For instance, I felt
        nothing but affinity for Marge, seemingly dragged down by her
        retiring husband -- this could be my family!  Dick's
        transformation into Flash Gordon is exciting in a very real
        way.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  I disagree.  One of the minor characters said, "What we lack in
        brains we make up for in good intentions."  I think this
        describes the filmmakers quite well.  I could spot all the
        scenes where they were trying to be funny, but for the most
        part they failed miserably.  At one point, Tod is contemplating
        the spare tire above his belt and attempts to become svelte by
        doing a short workout.  By the punchline, instead of laughing, I
        was envisioning the authoring committee pitching ideas to make
        the scene funny.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        I guess there's just no substitute for "getting it."  The scene
        you're complaining about, I found quite funny.  Very reminiscent
        of "Ren & Stimpy" and Tex Avery.  Oh well, your loss.  I give
        this film a fairly mild thumbs up.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  I'm a fan of both "Ren & Stimpy" and Tex Avery cartoons, but
        this just didn't do it for me.  I've seen all the gags before.
        Watching this movie was like hearing a joke for the hundredth
        time, the freshness is gone.  It's just not funny anymore.  Even
        the profusion of Bulldogs, which I appreciated greatly, wasn't
        enough to save this movie from a thumbs down.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Ignoring all of the originality and cleverness, I agree with
        you completely.  That said, this film earned one mild thumb up,
        and one thumb down.  That's all for now -- the tty is closed.</PRE>
