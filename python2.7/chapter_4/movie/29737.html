<P>PLOT:
This movie takes place over one day. It's a rookie cop's narcotics training
alongside a seasoned police veteran. The rookie doesn't know much about "street
justice", so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "real
world". How even cops like themselves have to "bend the rules" and "break the
law" every now and then, in order to catch the really bad guys.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board, some ups, some
downs and a thrilling ending, despite a couple of small flaws. I really enjoyed
this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations
which had me wondering about what I would do if I were in their place. The film
gets right into the "dirty" side of, well...the dirt on the streets, and
proceeds to teach the rookie cop (and us, the audience) how things really work
down there. Of course, we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a
lot of scum in his time, but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on
the up-and-up either. And therein, lies the fun of the film. Do you agree that
you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the
people who break the really big ones? Well, as the film moves along, we're given
two points of view in respect to this predicament, and to me, both sides made
sense at some point or another. And you gotta give a lot of credit to the
screenplay for that, the director, who builds the film up wonderfully (with the
darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script) and the two actors
who deliver their parts in spades. Hawke, first off, because he rarely plays
these "commercial" roles but does so perfectly here, with a vulnerable side
which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top.</P>
<P>And Denzel, well, what can you say about Mr. Washington that hasn't already been
said before? He comes through as per his usual high-level style here, and gives
the audience a completely different side to his talent, of which, I personally
would like to see more. He's nice, he's not so nice, he's smart, he's not so
smart, he's caring and he's a dog all the way. The few problems that I did have
with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point
(okay, we get it...you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty
people...move on) and this one really major "coincidence" which involved a
bathtub, that saved the day for one character, but seemed a little too
"convenient" for my taste. I also never really understood how Washington's
character got out of a certain dire predicament, only to be seen driving his car
in the very next scene. But obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall
enjoyment of this tense drama, a film that gets you right into the streets, into
the nooks and the crannies, and into the moral dilemma which lies between the
justice system and the day-to-day drug busts. See it if you want to wrestle with
some of these issues yourself, see it if you want to see Denzel and Ethan strike
up a palpable chemistry on-screen, and see it if you like holding on to your
seat-handles real tight during a movie. In fact, see it for the scene in which
Ethan Hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone...dang, now that's
intense!</P>
