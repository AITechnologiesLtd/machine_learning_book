<PRE>                                PREDATOR II
                       A film review by Ann Hodgins
                        Copyright 1990 Ann Hodgins</PRE>
<PRE>Imagine two species:</PRE>
<PRE>Species A: 8 feet tall
Species B: 6 feet in lifts</PRE>
<P>Species A: probably a reptile, lays eggs
Species B: a mammal, completely dependent on its mother for years</P>
<P>Species A: thick scaly hide, like armour
Species B: thin soft skin, filled with nerve endings</P>
<P>Species A: eats an ox raw every 3 days
Species B: likes a steak rare with baked potatoes and sour cream</P>
<PRE>Species A: consumes human flesh
Species B: adores truffles</PRE>
<P>Species A: special features - claws and teeth for ripping flesh 
Species B: special features - large genitals and forebrain, ideal
                for [censored] and computer games.</P>
<P>Species A: heavily muscled but graceless hands good only for striking blows
Species B: agile, sensitive hands ideal for knitting </P>
<P>Species A: long, sharp heavy claws
Species B: delicate nails for scratching puppies behind the ears</P>
<P>Species A: features of face mainly teeth grinding in every direction
Species B: big fringed eyes, delicately sculpted features, sensitive lips</P>
<PRE>Species A: heavily armed
Species B: not so heavily armed</PRE>
<P>        Imagine pitting species A against species B.  It should make a short movie.
Bambi meets Godzilla.  </P>
<P>        The crazy thing is, we are supposed to believe that Species B wins!
Armed with a strong sense of personal responsibility and love of
comrades, one member of Species B alone triumphs.  Impossible.  And
yet...  the moral is a good one.  </P>
