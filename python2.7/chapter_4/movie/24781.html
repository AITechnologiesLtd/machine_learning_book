<P>After 'Chinatown' he disappeared, and to this day everyone were anxiously
waiting for his comeback. Now Artisan Pictures presents Roman Polanski's
fresh thriller "The Ninth Gate". Polanski was fascinated by the concept of
good and evil, their effect and place in our lives. "The Ninth Gate" is no
exception. It is a more intelligent and elegant version of 'End of Days'</P>
<P>The Ninth Gate begins ominously – a comfortable-looking study takes on a
distinctly uncomfortable atmosphere as middle-aged man hangs himself with a
rope that dangles from the chandelier. Then we see Dean Corso (Johnny Depp,
'Sleepy Hollow') at work. He's a rare books expert, of `the lean, hungry,
restless type, who would stab friends in the back.' As the wealthy book
collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella, 'Dracula' ) observes, `It is easy to
trust a man whose loyalty can be measured in money'. Corso is highly skilled
at his work, a position which requires dexterity, cultural expertise, nerves
of steel...and few scruples. Known for locating rare books for wealthy
collectors, Corso is hired by eminent book-lover and scholar of demonology,
Boris Balkan. Corso's mission: to find the last two volumes of the legendary
manual of satanic invocation "The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom" - a book
surpassingly written by Lucifer himself. Corso has to compare them with
Balkan's first volume, supposedly the only one of its kind, and ascertain
the authenticity of the series. Corso accepts the challenge. From New York
to Toledo, Paris to Cintra, he immerses himself in a labyrinth full of
pitfalls and temptations, disturbing encounters, violence and mysterious
deaths. Protected by an angelic creature and guided by a force more powerful
than himself, the hunter solves one by one the mysteries of the dreaded Book
and discovers the real purpose of his mission...</P>
<P>Polanski carefully constructs his script and creates very interesting
characters. Among the other sinful types racing with Corso toward their
devilish goals are nymphomaniac rich widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), and her
menacing albino bodyguard (Tony Amoni), the angry-at-God wheelchair-bound
Satan aficionado Baroness Kessler (Barbara Jefford) and a mysterious blond
backpacker who appears everywhere and may possess supernatural powers
(played by Polanski's wife, Emmanuelle Seigner).</P>
<P>The film becomes a crazed journey into darkness. What starts as a quest for
money, goes deeper as he dives into his soul. Corso is a professional in his
area, nonetheless it looks like he is following his own shadow. The film is
greatly woven as Polanski plays with the definitions of good and evil. The
pure, real evil is not 'the end of days'. It's not an apocalypse, fire or
fury, but the dark side of the human soul and psyche. Satan need not show
himself with external signs, but can work entirely within ourselves -- our
minds and souls. Evil resorts in us and is as natural as goodness, only
easier to live by.</P>
<P>This film is at times funny, at times frightening, shocking and operating on
a slighter higher intellectual level than most of its genre. Like in 'The
Devil's Advocate' nothing is obvious and nothing is primitive. The Devil
doesn't puke blood or blow up buildings. And yet, he shows himself. He is
everywhere around us. And by taking the dark path, we're letting Him into
our souls. Sometimes he can be seen in a little girl, sometimes in a dog.
And little by little, Corso becomes the monster he seeks. As the Devil
brilliantly says in the slightly better 'The Devil's Advocate': "..Follow
the money..straight to the top..", Dean Corso persuaded the only thing
sacred for him. His path went through greed, lust, anger and finally led to
the key to the darkest place of his soul. He finally understood his place
and meaning..</P>
<P>The movie is one intense visual nightmare, based on the European hit "El
Club Dumas" by Spanish writer Arturo Perez Reverte. It is an ironic, tense,
literate story in which Lucifer and his minions and worshippers increasingly
erupt into everyday reality. 'The Ninth Gate' is a typical European movie,
made in the classic style. This means -- no expensive models, no action
sequences, no digital special effects. It is full of terrific locations, and
Polanski's eye has not faltered. He has a fine photo/design team, a good
score by Wojciech Kilar, and his knowledge of Europe puts him way ahead of
most American directors who could have been hired. Johnny Depp is a perfect
choice for the cynical and intelligent 'book detective' -- the master of
every situation. With a develish black beard and dark eyes, he coolly walks
the streets, smoking a dozen cigars a day. Depp is spectacular in a role
that is difficult and demanding. Perfect is Frank Langella as the mysterious
and deadly aristocrat. Interesting is Lena Olin as the deadly beauty and
Barbara Jefford as the sinister invalid, hungry for revenge. Worse is
Emmanuelle Seigner, who is perfect when the camera zooms into her diabolical
green eyes, but she is not much of an actress. She remains the Sofia Copolla
of this film.</P>
<P>"The Ninth Gate" is the latest horror movie by a master of the genre. It's
not a perfect film. It's not as provoking and energetic as 'The Devil's
Advocate' and it's not as genially frightening as 'Rose Mary's Baby'. It is
unfortunately a bit dull and boring at times, when Corso is desperately
running through the empty streets of European cities. And I wonder if
audiences will accept it that way. With "Scream 3" and "Battlefield Earth"
around the corner, will today's audiences accept intelligence or embrace the
usual blood, gore and technological marvels? I think that the answer is
obvious: this will not be a major hit at the box office. But for you all
serious movie goers -- this is quality. 'The Ninth Gate' is drained in
Polanski's specialties: rich dark humor, mysterious premise and overwhelming
atmospheres of doom and dread.</P>
