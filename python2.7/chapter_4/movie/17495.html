<P>_10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>It would be easy to do take the cutesy and oh-so-precious route and make
this review a list of "10 Things I Hate About This Movie," but the truth is
I didn't exactly hate this film.  At its center, in fact, is a major thing
to like: newcomer Julia Stiles, who effectively plays the improbably named
Katarina Stratford, the "shrew" who comes to be "tamed" in this teen
modernization of William Shakespeare's _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_.  Kat is
mercilessly bitter with the world, and she's not afraid to show it--to her
fellow students, her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), and even her
doctor father (Larry Miller).  Even so, Stiles subtly instills enough
underlying vulnerability to make her relatable to the audience.</P>
<P>Also relatable are Kat's reasons for lashing out; the characters that
surround her are so vacuous, it's completely understandable why she
wouldn't want to associate with them.  These people include, in addition to
Bianca, her shallow best friend Chastity (Gabrielle Union); Bianca's two
suitors, egotistical model/actor Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) and dull nice
guy Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); Cameron's geeky friend Michael
Eckman (David Krumholtz); and, to a certain extent, the guy who eventually
thaws our ice princess, mysterious loner Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger, who
actually has some nice chemistry with Stiles).  They're all nice, selfish
targets for the full concentration of Kat's venom.  The problem is, while
director Gil Junger and writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith often
let Kat bare her fangs, she is given little to no opportunity to actually
bite.  Though this is a reworking of _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_, the scale
is too heavily tilted toward the "taming" and not the "shrew."  Anyone
looking for the wickedness promised by the film's title or its taglines
("How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the ways" and "Romeo, oh Romeo, get
out of my face") will instead find a light dose of bile and a strong one of
the warm fuzzies.  (opens March 31)</P>
