<P>None of this is meant to say that O is a total waste of time.  At the
very least, it's a far better film than the obtuse 1995 version of
Othello, which starred Lawrence Fishburne and strayed far from the
original tale but still relied on cryptic Elizabethan-era English.  O is
far more faithful to the original story than I would have suspected,
even handling those tricky asides and character-hiding-in-a-closet
scenes with aplomb.  Ultimately, the source material keeps O mostly
afloat, telling a unique and tragic story about how a single,
well-placed rumor can ruin the life of somebody who otherwise has it
made.</P>
<P>Mired in the "marketing violent movies to teens is bad" controversy of
1999-2000, O has been sitting on the shelf for a while, building a large
volume of clips that claim it's the most violent thing since Natural
Born Killers.  A word to audiences -- this is far from the truth.  In
fact, those expecting a Columbine-style rampage (a ridiculous link which
I've nonetheless found in 538 articles on Nexis.com) will be
disappointed by the relatively tame ending -- comprising four gunshots
and a quiet strangling.</P>
