<P>           Ahh.....how do I start this review? I could start with
saying it's the best movie I've ever had the pleasure to see in
 my life. Or maybe I could start by saying that if you haven't seen
this movie you should turn off your computer right now and get your
butt over to the cinema of your choice. Yeah, one of those two would
be a good place to start. </P>
<P>               This was not a movie I'd been anticipating. I'd heard
test-screenings were positive, but it just didn't grab me. I was much
more anxious to see a movie that opened here a week after Titanic -
Alien Ressurection. I only went to see Titanic because a) It's James
Cameron (nuff' said?) and b) well, I see every movie that comes out.</P>
<P>               Titanic opened here a day earlier than anywhere else,
but stupid me didn't take this oppurtunity to see it early. It was
actually a week after it opened that I decided it was time to take a
look. Sold Out? Huh? A movie in Penrith selling out? And a week after
release? Whoa. Dissappointed and intruiged at the same time we decided
to buy tickets for the one of the later sessions. </P>
<P>               'Why the hell did I waste a week before seeing this?',
echoed around my head as we staggered out of the theatre
 after a 3 1/4 hour emotional roller-coaster. My brother, Chris, (an
amateur film-maker) walked from the theatre shaking his head and
muttering incomprehensively. All I heard was the occasional snippet -
'......wow...cinematography'. Me and Chris usually see every movie we
can and then drive everyone else nuts by talking about it endlessly in
the car home from the cinema. Strangely this time not a word
 was spoken on the way home, oh...except for -
'stop....need...food...service station', but that hardly counts.</P>
<P>        After that night, I honestly couldn't have cared less about
seeing Alien Ressurection. It couldn't possibly have topped this. And
as I discovered a week later - I was right. Titanic is the best movie
I've ever seen. Said it before and I'll say it again - best! You may
be sitting there thinking - 'but it's 3 1/4 hours long and it's a love
story! Not my thing'. That's what I  thought too....but I didn't
notice a second pass as soon as T I T A N I C  appeared on the screen.
Even though the ship doesn't start sinking till the last hour, the
first half is so intruiging, enjoyable and beleive or not -
even funny. </P>
<P>         The story of the two main characters - Jack and Rose, is so
engaging that I could have happily sat in that movie  theatre for way
longer than 3 1/4 hours. </P>
<P>               The movie's best scene is without a doubt the very
final scene. I'm not going to give ANY details about this part,
because it's easily my favourite scene in any movie I've seen and I'd
hate to ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet. The funny thing
about this movie is that the images and scenes that make the biggest
impression on you are not the big budget sinking parts (though
impressive) - it's the scene's following the actual sinking that haunt
you most. </P>
<P>               I'm not going to go into any more detail about this
movie at all, I just basically wanted to convey what a powerful
 impression it made on me, not ruin it for those who have neglected to
see it. If you have not seen this movie, then please do so. You will
regret not seeing this movie on the big screen. I have seen it three
times so far and plan to see it many more times. It was just as
powerful on viewing #3 as it was the first time, which is definitely
saying  something. If you have already seen it, then do what I'm going
to do and see it again and again and....... </P>
