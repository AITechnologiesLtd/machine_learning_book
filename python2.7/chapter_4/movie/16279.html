<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Aside from Japan's Akira Kurosawa, I had not really seen too many Chinese
film makers up until the time I wrote this review. And, as I sat and watched
this film, I really wondered what I was going to find.</P>
<PRE>Outstanding acting.</PRE>
<P>Very powerful story, and way to tell it.</P>
<P>A scathing political film denouncing the feudal lord system, who takes the
law into his own hands.</P>
<P>A style of cinematography, which is not boring, but is really quite
symmetrical.  All the shots are perfectly framed, reminding us of a  David
Lean film.  And the director allows us to feel the space, before he enters
it, much like David Lean did.  No surprises necessary, except for the
unsuspecting actors..... we are on the outside of the 'box' as it is called
in theatre.  In many ways, the style of cinematography is out-dated, which
could have been intentional, since the life of the Master, is also fading.</P>
<P>A nice mix of art and life, which is rarely portrayed as a unity, but as an
entity which interferes with life.</P>
<P>RAISE THE RED LANTERN is an excellent film, and although a bit slow for
American standards and tastes for most film, it replaces the slowness with a
theme, which fits the film.</P>
<P>The story is about a young woman who finally gives in to her mother's
wishes, and becomes another concubine for a rich man.  By doing so, she has
to give up her life, as a student, to become a slave to a past
( literally ) which she despises, but she has little choice.  The mother can
not work enough to afford the education of the daughter, and the father has
recently died.  And by trading in her vows as a concubine, she is
helping the mother with a dowry, which would keep her taken care of for
life.  And so she becomes the fourth mistress of a rich lord.  And no soon
does she enter into the marriage, she discovers that the house is
laden with petty jealousies, and evening politics, to try to entice the
master to one of his wives' beds.  And the competition, as she finds out is
as brutal, as it is vicious.  And the girls will not stand for second if
they can help it, and will go to many lengths to get their desire taken care
of.  The ultimate goal is to bear the master as
many boys as the wife can.  And between them all, they are not doing  very
well.  The last two have only produced one child each, and one of them is a
girl.</P>
<P>It is nevertheless, very soon that the fourth mistress discovers how to deal
with the others.  The third mistress was a professional opera  singer, and
is truly beautiful, but does not have a disposition to deal with competitors
( they say she is spoiled ) and in the middle of the night feigns sickness
and stubborn behavior, until the master leaves whom ever he is with to go to
her.  And the fourth mistress one day says that if he leaves, don't ever
return to her bed.  This time she wins.</P>
<P>The indiscretion of any one of the wives ( the third ) begins to show the
cruel fate of those caught in the act.  The young fourth mistress being
educated, has a knack for curiosity, and walks the immense grounds, and
checks out all she can find.  And one day she finds in one corner a small
place which has been used as an execution room for those who get involved in
bad acting, and get caught.  On one fateful day, when the master is out, the
third wife goes out to have her affair with the house doctor, and the
disappointed fourth mistress, who has been  drinking to celebrate her
birthday, accidentally mentions the indiscretion of the third wife.  In the
next few days, she is hung in that small room, on the far end of the castle.
The fourth mistress goes to check out the room, where she saw them take the
third mistress, and when she comes out screaming, she is changed.  She is
now 'mad'.  And soon, the master has a new mistress, a fifth one, younger
still.</P>
<P>The red lanterns, the central focal point of the story, refer to the
lanterns used to light up the street where the mistress lives, leading up to
her house.  The master likes the lights on, so he can see.  It is also a
custom which goes back many years, used to make sure no enemies of the
master walk in unawares.  Now it has decayed into a  symbol of decadence and
attention which the master uses to get the other wives interested in his
company.  It doesn't work for the first mistress, she has become the wise
old lady, has borne him a son, now full grown.  Despite her wiseness, she
can not seem to control the young ladies and their fierce competitive
spirit, which is so detrimental to them all.  And every evening, in front of
all the mistresses, he announces publicly, in whose house he will spend the
night, whereupon the red lanterns will be immediately lit, much to the
chagrin of the competing losers.</P>
<P>The film's outcome is as brutal as the competitive nature of the three
mistresses, culminating in the loss of two in the end, one to death, and the
other to 'mad'-ness.  In between, is an array of images set up very neatly
 it is the tradition!!! ) which keeps the house alive, and its servants
busy, from the aspiring maid who would like to be one of the mistresses
 the master does visit her once in a while ) in contrast to the fourth
mistress who does not.  She is also accused of an indiscretion and punished
by the matriarch of the family when the master is away.  Her indiscretion
was a desire to be one of the  mistresses, and her fate is that she has to
serve as mistress to the one wife she does not like, the one who is the
exact opposite of her own desire.</P>
<P>The film spends a lot of time, walking out of plot traps, with its favorite
line.... it's the tradition -- and it seems they even try to create new
ones... but it only shows the length to which many feudal lords will go to
keep their families in control, and profit from their own needs and desires.</P>
