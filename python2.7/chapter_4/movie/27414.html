<PRE>"AntiTrust"</PRE>
<P>Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) is a Bill Gates style entrepreneur on the brink
of deploying a vast, satellite-based communications system that will change
the world. He recruits a brilliant young computer nerd, Milo Hoffman (Ryan
Phillippe), to implement the final piece of software and bring the system
on line. But, Milo soon finds out that his benevolent mentor is no Mr. Nice
Guy in "AntiTrust"</P>
<P>You can tell when the movies of the New Year begin showing up at theaters.
We go from the sublime work with year-end films like "Traffic" and
"Thirteen Days," to the ridiculous dreck of the likes of "AntiTrust." The
sophomore effort by director Peter Howitt ("Sliding Doors") is a ho-hum,
routine action thriller that lacks any thrills, is badly paced and poorly
written.</P>
<P>The premise surrounding "AntiTrust" is a typical David versus the corporate
Goliath. The good guys, Milo and his friends, are on the verge of creating
a startup company that could shake things up in worldwide communications.
Winston, with his billions of dollars, is the main competition for the
lads. He uses his money and kind and friendly demeanor to tempt Milo to
come on board his precious project. The temptation is too much for the
young genius and Milo, with the encouragement of his girlfriend Alice
(Claire Foleri), goes over to the enemy, shirking his friends.</P>
<P>Things look bright and perky for Milo as Gary acts as his mentor and
provides for all his worldly needs. But, things aren't what they seem.
Winston, miraculously, can always "find" the software that Milo needs to
complete his piece of the project, called Synapse. Recent reports of the
bizarre deaths of some of the area's top programmers don't sink into Milo's
head until he learns of a supposed hate crime - the brutal murder of his
best friend and startup crony, Teddy (Yee Jee Tso). As the pieces fall into
place in his mind, Milo sees that Winston is the root of the corporate evil
that threatens to rule the world's communications system.</P>
<P>This David and Goliath yarn incorporates stock suspense items like racing
against the clock and risking capture to break into the company computer -
not once, but twice. We get the cheap, jump out of the dark scares that are
a trademark for a lack of imagination in writing. There are also twists and
turns in who is on Milo's side and who wants him dead, so not all the
characters, like his girlfriend Alice and co-worker Lisa (Rachel Leigh
Cook) are not who they seem to be. All these gyrations do not make the
story more interesting, just confusing.</P>
<P>I'm not a fan of Ryan Phillippe, finding the actor too mannered and wooden.
He is just that in "AntiTrust," evoking neither sympathy nor empathy for
Milo. Tim Robbins' Gary Winston is a near carbon copy of the role he played
in "Arlington Road" a year or two ago. The difference is, Robbins had a
well-developed character to play in the older movie. Here, he is given
virtually nothing to do. Supporting cast is nondescript.</P>
<P>Production values are decent, but, without a good story or characters to
hang them upon, they are a wasted effort. Let's hope that "AntiTrust" isn't
the new standard for Hollywood filmmaking. I give it a D-.</P>
