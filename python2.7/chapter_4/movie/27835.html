TATAWO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Psst!  Can I interest you in some hot tattoos?  As the beautiful Simona 
(Mercedes Ortega) dances by the big bonfire, her body, covered all over 
in tattoos, gets all warm and toasty.</P>
<P>Writer/director Jo Sol's TATAWO is about sex, nudity, drugs and, most of 
all, tattoos.  There's probably a plot hidden somewhere beneath this 
tattoo-laden tale, but you couldn't prove it by me.  When the characters 
speak, they are less than illuminating.  "You're like embracing smoke," 
a character known as the Cuban (Alexis Valdés) tells his wife, whom he 
calls Bug (Paulina Gálvez).</P>
<P>About the only reason to see the film is for the eye candy.  One of 
Simona's favorite pastimes is to undulate in the nude in a shop window.  
As haunting music plays, it is hard not to fall under the erotic spell 
that she weaves.  But this is a transitory pleasure and does little to 
compensate for the dreadful dullness of the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>TATAWO runs a long 1:29.  The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.  
It is not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity and drug usage and 
would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
