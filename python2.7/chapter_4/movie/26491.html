<PRE>DR. T AND THE WOMEN
-------------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Robert Altman is one of the great American film directors.  He's developed
a unique style, creating slices of life with large ensemble casts whose
stories interweave and bustling scenes where one can follow several strands
of overlapping dialogue.</P>
<P>With "Dr. T and the Women," Altman, again collaberating with screenwriter
Anne Rapp ("Cookie's Forturn") gives us one of his more middling creations.</P>
<P>The film opens in Dr. T's office, which is in a state of chaos.  Office
manager Carolyn (Shelley Long) is almost winning a losing battle, keeping
Houston society's elite ladies moving through three wittily named
examining rooms.  Dr. T's home life is also coming undone as his beloved
but mentally unbalanced wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett) jumps nude into shopping
mall fountains while his eldest daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson, "Almost
Famous") plans her wedding.  His alcoholic sister-in-law Peggy (Laura
Dern) has also moved into his manse with her three young daughters.</P>
<P>Dr. T relaxes on hunting and golfing trips with three male buddies, but
even the country club is invaded when a new golf pro, Bree (Helen Hunt), 
arrives and sets her cap for him.</P>
<P>Anne Rapp's fantastical script drips with female symbolism, from Kate's
diagnosed Hestia complex to the constant water references which culminate
in a fateful storm.  However, only a few of the characters manage to 
make themselves stand out admist the throng.</P>
<P>Gere is fine as the sympathetic gynecologist being trampled by life and
hordes of females.  He's softer than usual here and it befits his character
nicely.  Fawcett is quite good reverting to a childlike state.  Laura
Dern is a real standout as the champagne guzzling whirlwind who plays
at motherhood (Dr. T's maid Maria (Irene Cortez) is the one who really
keeps Peggy's girls in control).  Shelley Long gives a wonderful comic
performance as Dr. T's right hand woman who's maybe too happy to hear about
his marital woes.  Janine Turner (TV's "Northern Exposure," "Cliffhanger")
makes a welcome return to the screen as Dorothy, a serial patient who makes 
appointments only to get the reassurance she doesn't get from her husband 
(one of Dr. T's hunting pals).</P>
<P>Neither Kate Hudson nor Tara Reid make much of an impression as Dr. T's
daughters, although Altman vet Liv Tyler fares a bit better as a suspect
maid of honor.  Helen Hunt makes a convincing golf pro and down to earth
romantic foil for Gere.</P>
<P>However, why would the faithful Dr. T allow himself to be so quickly seduced 
after we learn that Kate's Hestia complex is suffered by 'women who are loved 
too much?'  An amusing sideline is developed between Dorothy and an elderly
woman in Dr. T's waiting room, but when the woman trips Dorothy with her
cane, Dorothy blames the incident on Dr. T - nonsensical.  The finale,
which could be viewed as either a return to the womb or homage to "The
Wizard of Oz," is pretty bizarre.  The film could even be seen as misogynistic.
The women are constantly presented as babbling hens (none of Altman's 
overlapping dialog here - instead we get a maelstrom of cackle!) whether
in the waiting room, getting dress fittings or at a wedding shower.</P>
<P>Altman also makes a couple of visual puns using store signs (he pans up
to the Godiva sign as Kate frolicks nude), but they seem out of place
when the device isn't carried through.  Big kudos to costume designer
Dona Granata ("Cookie's Fortune"), however, whose work really helps define 
the characters and adds comic touches.  Altman's son Stephen's production
design nails the lifestyle of a wealthy Houston doctor and his pampered
clients.</P>
