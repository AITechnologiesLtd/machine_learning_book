<P>"Nico and Dani" is a little film, focusing on a few days in the lives of
two young male friends. The story turns on the fact that one of the boys
is gay and in love with his straight friend and includes some modestly
staged sex scenes between underage characters (the actors playing them
are adults). But this is not an American movie, so the sexual exchanges
and related issues are presented as matter-of-fact instead of
scandalous. "Nico and Dani" works because it stays low-key. The
filmmakers understand that, regardless of whether one's orientation is
homo or hetero, once boys gets sex on their minds, they will do
virtually anything to make it happen.</P>
<P>Adapted from the play "Krampack," the subtitled tale is set in a
picturesque oceanside village near Barcelona, Spain. When Mom and Dad
leave for a trip to Egypt, Dani (Fernando Ramallo) invites Nico (Jordi
Vilches) to stay with him. The boys plan to hunt, fish and just hang out
together, but that changes when they bump into two young ladies, Berta
(Esther Nubiola) and Elena (Marieta Orozco).</P>
<P>Nico immediately clicks with Elena and Berta is attracted to Dani, but
he only has eyes for Nico. While the boys have often traded hand jobs,
Nico views the sessions as simply a means for sexual relief while on the
road to traditional sex with a woman. After just a few meetings, Elena
makes it clear to Nico that she is willing to help him realize his goal.</P>
<P>For Dani, the bedroom exchanges with Nico are the real thing and he
wants to carry the relationship further. As Nico and Elena become
closer, he grows increasingly frustrated. When his attempt to ruin the
relationship by telling Elena that Nico is gay proves unsuccessful, Dani
heads for the home of Julian (Chisco Amado), an adult writer and
associate of his father. Even though Julian has a girlfriend, Dani
senses an attraction and makes overtures to the man.</P>
<P>Back at the home front, Nico is experiencing his own confusion. While
Elena consents to sex, she only wants a one-night stand and Nico desires
more than that. To make matters worse, Dani is missing and he fears for
the safety of his friend.</P>
<P>Nothing earthshaking happens in "Nico and Dani." No matter how the
sexual politics work out, it is obvious that the boys will remain
friends. And both of them are likable despite the fact that they commit
some reprehensible acts, including serving narcotic-spiked drinks to the
girls. Anyone who looks back at their own youth will surely remember the
lousy things they said or did while trying to get laid. "Nico and Dani"
is merely a slice of life, but it's a well-observed, wonderfully-acted
slice of life that reminded me that, while adolescence is a nice place
to visit, I wouldn't want to live there.</P>
