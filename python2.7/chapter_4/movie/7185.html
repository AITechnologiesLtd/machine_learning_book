<PRE>                           BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This is the age-old fascinating tale of the beautiful girl and an ugly
beast.  The story is brought to life in this, the 30th animated
full-length Disney film and only the fifth classic fairy tale of Disney
films, (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs <1937>, Cinderella <1956>,
Sleeping Beauty <1959>, The Little Mermaid, <1989>, a Hans Christian
Anderson story, which became the most successful of all animated films
ever released.) Only through animation, it would seem, could the story
reach new heights of imagination.  Add to it some inspired voice
casting and clever songs and here is a film for both children and
adults to enjoy.  The music is by Alan Menken and the songs are by the
team of Menken and Howard Ashman.</P>
<P>It is the 1800s.  Belle (Beauty) lives in a French village where she
enjoys reading books.  There she is pursued by, a good-looking egotist
named Gaston who is always admiring himself but he is not at all what
Belle is looking for.  Richard White is Gaston's voice.</P>
<P>Her father, an inventor, wanders into a castle where he is taken
prisoner by a horrible-looking beast.  Belle offers herself as hostage
so that her father can be released. Aided by the castle's staff she
discovers that even an ugly beast can have a heart of gold unlike
Gaston who is more of a beast than the one in the castle.  This is
further revealed when he leads a crowd to the castle in the films
climactic denouement.</P>
<P>There's just enough growling and blustering by the Beast to give little
kids a thrill. . . and just enough pathos and personality to make them
love him.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is full of the kind of humor one
associates with Disney films.  From the broad brush given Gaston's
egotism, to the antics of the mantel clock, the teapot, candelabra and
wardrobe, the film is a happy romp.</P>
<P>Beauty's loyalty to her father and self-sacrifice will not be lost on
the viewers.  While the film is primarily for children, adults will be
happy to find they, too, are enjoying it.</P>
<P>Easily recognizable voices are those of the Narrator, Donald Ogden
Stiers, Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts, the castle's housekeeper, and Jo
Anne Worley as the Wardrobe and Jerry Ohrbach doing the candelabra
voice.</P>
<P>Beautifully animated, with lifelike scenery, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST will
entertain you and your children.</P>
<P>Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise.</P>
