<PRE>                             BREAKING THE WAVES
                        Copyright 1996 D & S Associates</PRE>
<P>"Breaking the Waves" is Danish writer/director Lars von Trier's odd
fable about a simple Scottish woman who marries a Swedish oil rig
worker and tries to save him after he's paralyzed in a work accident
by sleeping with other men and telling him about it, at his request.
It was recently awarded Best Actress and Best Director by the New York
Film Critics.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Breaking the Waves" is a truly unique film - it's concept and
execution are completely original, but once the story gets going
everything that happens is just what I expected.</P>
<P>Stage actress Emily Watson plays Bess in a star-making turn.  She's a
saintlike naif with big emotions and strong love and lust for her
husband. Yet an other Oscar calibre performance (it's that time of
year). Stellan Skarsgard is Jan, Bess' husband who looks upon her with
bemusement, adoration and concern.  Katrin Cartlidge is the dour Dodo,
Bess' best friend who has suffered through the death of her husband
with Bess' help and who now stands by Bess as she suffers the decline
of her man and the community turns against her.  Sandra Voe ("Local
Hero") is Bess' mother, a woman who cares for daughter but is too
caught up in the Calvinist church to turn against it in defense of her
daughter.</P>
<P>"Breaking the Waves" is divided into 8 chapters, beginning with "Bess
Gets Married".  Each chapter begins with a static shot of the Scottish
coastal scenery and a different classic rock tune ("Life on Mars"
anyone?). von Trier seems to be regressing in the technical aspects of
his style. His first internationally released film, "Zentropa", was
sharp black and white with splashes of red.  His television miniseries
"The Kingdom", was shot on video and transferred to film, giving it a
grainy quality. "Breaking the Waves" mostly employs hand held camera
that frequently (and annoyingly) goes out of focus - a strange choice
for a production this ambitious.</P>
<P>Bess runs to embrace her final destiny and joyously sacrifice all
for the love of her husband and we witness what can only be described
as a miracle.  von Trier rapturously provides a second miracle at the
conclusion of his oddly affecting film.</P>
<P>I was hoping for that "Breaking the Waves" would be what I call a
'movie rush' film (the last one I experienced was "Red" in 1995), but
it didn't quite achieve that masterpiece level for me - the technical
glitches and predictability of the story held it back.  But "Breaking
the Waves" is anything but unoriginal and features a truly noteworthy
character and performance in Emily Watson's Bess.</P>
