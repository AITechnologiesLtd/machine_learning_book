<PRE>                             BOOGIE NIGHTS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The ups and downs of the pornographic
          film industry in the 70s and early 80s come to the
          screen as we follow one porno super-star and his
          director.  The film is witty, intelligent, and
          occasionally a little raunchy, but always fun to
          watch.  This is a film with several eccentric
          characterizations and is a sort of HOLLYWOOD
          BOULEVARD for the porno film industry.  Rating: 8
          (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4) There are some light
          spoilers in this review.
          New York Critics: 14 positive, 3 negative, 5 mixed</PRE>
<P>     There certainly is nothing unusual in a film about a rise to fame
and a fall of some entertainment sensation. In the field of popular
music there is THE ROSE, IDOLMAKER, THE COMMITMENTS and THAT THING YOU
DO.  Another rise and fall film might be KNIGHTRIDERS, a personal
favorite.  If you want to stretch a point CITIZEN KANE is about the
same theme.  What is unusual is to see a good film set in the world of
pornographic films.</P>
<P>     Jack Horner (played by Burt Reynolds) is a super-mellow director
of pornographic films, but he has a dream.  He no longer wants to make
just good pornographic films, he wants to make good films that also
happen to be pornographic.  His dream is a continuing series with James
Bond-like plots framing his usual show-everything explicit sex scenes.
He wants his audiences to want to know how things come out, not just to
see what things come out.  But it is tough to be experimental in a
medium with such a high budget.  As Horner puts it, "Before you turn
around, you've spent maybe twenty, twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars
on a movie."  And Horner has a new star for his series.  Eddie Adams
(Mark Wahlberg) is a bus boy at a San Fernando Valley night club.
Eddie's home life is a mess and he is looking for an excuse to leave.
Horner sees something in Eddie that could make him a sex-film star.
When things get bad enough at home Eddie agrees to make one film for
Jack.</P>
<P>     At Jack's insistence he chooses a new name for himself and Dirk
Diggler sounds "sharp" to him.  But this is not just an invitation to a
one-time job.  It is an adoption into something between a repertory
company and a family, a tightly knit group who make Horner's low budget
films.  In fact, one of several running gags in the film is that it is
always the same faces showing up in the films, only in different parts.
Among the regulars are Rollergirl (Heather Graham) who never removes
her roller-skates, even when making love.  In spite of her silly-
looking persona she demands to be taken on her own terms, especially by
her lovers.  William Macy plays Little Bill whose wife's cheating on
him is about as subtle as a billboard on Broadway.  Perhaps the most
normal of the crew is Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) who is acting in
pornography only long enough to earn enough to open a hi-fi store and
whose country-western persona seems out of place for an Afro- American.
If the company is a family, the father is Horner and it has porno star
Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) as the nurturing mother.  Then funding the
who operation is The Colonel (Robert Ridgely) who produces and likes
what he produces.  The general format of the film is sort of a rise and
fall as Horner pulls his dream all together, but has problems keeping
it all together in the face of monstrous egos, the changing market, and
the easy availability of cocaine.  The film's longest segment takes
place in 1977, then has shorter and shorter pieces showing how the
group fares as the years go by.</P>
<P>     The best performance is certainly the super-mellow Burt Reynolds
who is trying hard to hold on to what pretensions his group has.
Julianne Moore is certainly a scene stealer, sustaining the group in a
motherly way, but unable to get custody of her own child because of her
business.  Bill Macy, who has become familiar in mostly unsavory roles
manages to generate real pathos in what is basically a comic
situation-a wife who cares so little for her husband that she is
willing to have sex on a driveway with a crowd standing around and
watching.</P>
<P>     BOOGIE NIGHTS creates a very plausible look at a moment in the
history of the pornographic film when it looked like it might get some
respectability from the mainstream.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10
scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
