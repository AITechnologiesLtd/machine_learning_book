<PRE>                       FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL!  KILL!
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     In 1966, Russ Meyer's classic, FASTER, PUSSYCAT!  KILL!  KILL!,
first hit the big screen.  1995 marks the re-release of what is
considered the director's best and most accessible work: still as fun,
twisted, and hilarious as ever.</P>
<P>     The picture opens with an ominous voice-over, reminiscent of an
old Ed Wood picture, warning us of the dangers of a certain creature
that often "travels in packs."  Of course this creature is none other
than ... the go-go dancer, which, when released after a hard night's
work, has the tendency to wander through the desert looking for
trouble.</P>
<P>     FASTER, PUSSYCAT! is the story of three such creatures (Tura
Satana, Haji, and Lori Williams) who, after a particularly competitive
auto race, wind up in a plot involving murder, kidnapping, and the lust
for an old man's "stash" of money.  It's a thin plot, of course, but
the ultra-hammy acting by the three ladies is what really carries the
story from one hilarious scene to the next.</P>
<P>     The Ed Wood comparisons don't stop at the narration.  In many
respects, FASTER, PUSSYCAT! is so bad it's good.  Satana, Haji, and
Williams couldn't act their ways--working together--out of a paper
bag.  But surprisingly, this works.  With the heavy use of '60's
hipster-slang and a cool jazz/thriller theme music soundtrack, the
three leads are portrayed as anti-heroines of a bygone age.  So what if
they haven't memorized their lines?</P>
<P>     And don't be fooled, Meyer knew what he was doing.  The script is
full of self-mocking references, with Satana referring to a "scene" or
"the screenplay."  And as a true master of low-budget filmmaking, Meyer
could turn this schlock into profits.  While appearing as
half-industrial film, half-farce, the sum result is an entertaining
fringe picture that's really quite suitable for the mainstream.</P>
<P>     As new prints of FASTER, PUSSYCAT! travel around the country,
you'll probably hear that Meyer was "a soft-core pornographer" with
films like BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.  But when you see this movie
(and you really should), you may not even notice:  despite the
sensationalistic topic and scantily-clad characters, PUSSYCAT has no
nudity, due to the heavy censorship activity of the era.  Of course,
Meyer's reputation is quite the opposite.  Meyer fools us all again.</P>
