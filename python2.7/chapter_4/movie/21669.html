Susan Granger's review of "FELICIA'S JOURNEY" (Artisan Entertainment)</P>
<P>      In 1997, Canadian writer/director Atom Egoyan made an incredible
splash with his wildly unconventional The Sweet Hereafter, but this
new thriller, while superbly crafted, is neither as compelling nor
original. But that doesn't mean it's unworthy. Adapted from William
Trevor's novel, it follows the insidious story of Felicia, a
good-hearted, pregnant Irish country girl (Elaine Cassidy), who goes
to England to search for the child's father (Peter McDonald) and is
befriended by Joseph Hilditch, a seemingly gentle and smiling caterer
(Bob Hoskins) who works for a factory in industrial Birmingham. While
the laborers would obviously prefer simple British fare, the portly
Hilditch diligently concocts elaborate recipes on his antique
appliances while watching old video-taped cooking programs hosted by
his glamorous French mother (Arsinee Khanjian, Egoyan's real-life
wife). Aside from his psychotic mother complex, which rivals that of
Psycho's Norman Bates, Hilditch has courtly, Old World manners and
lives in what appears to be the family mansion - which makes one
immediately suspect that he's a dangerous serial killer with corpses
in the back yard. Not the trusting young Felicia, however. She's
grateful for the "help" he solicitously offers.  Problem is: there's
no mystery. Egoyan gives away the sinister secret so early in the
story that we're just left there, sitting in our seats watching with
dread as the tapestry unravels. And it's much more conventional than
the quirky Atom Egoyan fare in The Adjuster and Exotica. The scenes
stretch on too long and the repetitive flashbacks defuse the
tension. Nevertheless, Bob Hoskins (Mona Lisa) delivers yet another
dead-on characterization, one that he describes as "a cross between
Jack the Ripper and Winnie the Pooh." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, Felicia's Journey is a stylish if shallow 7. It's a bizarre,
macabre trip.</P>
