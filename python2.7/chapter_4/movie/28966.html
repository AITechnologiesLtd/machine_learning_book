<PRE>"Under the Sand"</PRE>
<P>Marie (Charlotte Rampling) and Jean (Bruno Cremer) have been married for 25
years and, to the entire world, appear to be quite happy together. While
vacationing at their summer home at Lit en Mix in southern France, Jean
decides to go for a swim. When, a little later, Marie turns to look for
him, he is nowhere to be found. A frantic search turns up nothing and Marie
returns home convinced, in her mind, that her husband is still alive in
"Under the Sand."</P>
<P>Charlotte Rampling commands the screen with her character study of a woman
walking the fine line between madness and sanity. The shock over the
disappearance of her husband drives her into a world of denial as she
carries on with her life, believing that Jean is still with her. When out
with friends, she talks of him in the present tense. When shopping for
herself, she picks out a tie that she thinks he would like. Her friends,
especially best friend Amanda (Alexandra Stewart), fear for her sanity.</P>
<P>Marie  undergoes  a  continuous struggle between acceptance and denial over
the  loss of Jean. Her friends realize her conflict and do what they can to
help,  but  Marie's  denial is too strong for anyone, even Amanda, to break
through to her. When she meets Vincent (Jacques Nolot), it appears that she
may,  finally, accept he loss and get on with her life. But, Jean's hold on
her is too strong and she continues to live in her own delusional world.</P>
<P>Rampling gives an unabashed performance as a woman on the brink of madness.
The mental turmoil she undergoes is plainly evident on her face as her mind
battles  between  denial  over  Jean's  disappearance and acceptance of the
fact. Director Francois Ozon uses the actress's exotic looks and expressive
features  to  show the fight taking place within her mind. The actress lays
it  all  on  the line and gives a notable performance. The rest of the cast
does  well  enough  fleshing  out the background, but it is Rampling's film
from beginning to end.</P>
<P>Madness  is a tough subject matter for film and could be a turn off for the
viewer. Films like "Diary of a Mad Housewife" (1970) gave a no holds barred
look  into  the  frightening  world of mental illness and are harsh in that
depiction. "Under the Sand" has the same relentless grip, but with an oddly
hopeful  feel.  Marie  is  a  likable, complex and beautiful character that
deserves  happiness  and  continues  to live in he deluded world where Jean
still  exists,  alive  and  well. Rampling's stunning performance makes you
want  to  believe she is sane, even as she falls deeper and deeper into her
psychosis.</P>
<P>Charlotte Rampling's performance, alone, is worth the price of admission to
"Under the Sand." I give it a B.</P>
