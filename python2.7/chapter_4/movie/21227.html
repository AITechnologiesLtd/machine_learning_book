<PRE>Rating: * * *  out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Starring: Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix, Harland Williams, Mark
McKinney, Glynis Johns.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13 for sexual humor and language.</P>
<PRE>Running Time: 82 minutes</PRE>
<P>As an avid SNL (Saturday Night Live) viewer I sadly never got to see 'A Night
at the Roxbury'. The two brothers from that skit always cracked me up and I
enjoyed them on SNL. Of course they are silly, dumb and plotless but SNL films
are always funny and entertaining. 'Superstar' is one of those films. It's a
surprisingly warm and good-spirited movie that doesn't even feel like an SNL
movie. It has heart and at the same time lots of laughs. Molly Shannon's Mary
Katherine Gallagher character is a riot and at the same time a lovable, sweet
character that we instantly fall in love with.</P>
<P>Mary Katherine Gallagher is a young high school girl in hopes of big things.
One day she would like to be a superstar and has always wanted to have a big
screen kiss. She's not a very liked person in school. One of her worst enemies
is Evion (Elaine Hendrix) the head cheerleader and major bimbo. She's going out
with Skye (Will Ferrel) the most popular guy in school and captain of the
football team. Mary has always had a crush on Skye and one day would like to
kiss him. She lives a normal life, she has friends, she has a job and she has a
loving grandma whom she lives with. When she hears that there is auditions for
a talent show she knows she HAS to try out and prove to everyone she's a
superstar. </P>
<P>Her grandmother disapproves of it, but Mary tries out anyway. Rather she makes
it or not is what you'll find out when you see the movie. It's a clever movie
with plenty of laughs, as well as heart. Molly Shannon is a extremely talented
actress who makes us believe who she is and what she does. She has very funny
moments including make-out scenes with a tree, yes I said that right as well as
a stop sign. </P>
<P>Not surprisingly other critics are panning this movie and calling it dumb and
lame. But what people have to understand is that the film isn't supposed to be
an Oscar Worthy movie. All they planned when making this film was fun and
entertainment and that is what they made. I found many of the skits in the film
funny and the overall tone of the movie was surprisingly sweet. There's a few
offensive jokes (especially towards Catholic people) but none of them are
scarring or on bad terms.</P>
<P>Mary Katherine Gallagher is a sweet young girl who has many priceless lines
towards Evion. The ending is very satisfying and makes a warm, fuzzy feeling go
over us as we realize even movies like this can make us feel good. There are
still some good SNL characters who need their own movies. I know I was glad to
see this movie and I might even see it again. It's a great acted, funny, warm
and engaging film that works on many levels that appealed to me and may to you.</P>
<P>As long as you don't take it to heart 'Superstar' is a good movie. It actually
contains a good message embedded in it's storyline: People should not listen to
others on how they look or how they should act. They need to look inside
themselves and find the good things rather than the bad ones which is a real
winner. See 'Superstar' for fast-paced fun and entertainment with heart, no
more.</P>
