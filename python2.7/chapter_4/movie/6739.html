<PRE>                                    TURBULENCE
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show hosted by
Laura and Robin Clifford, running on Boston Cable TV. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<PRE>TURBULENCE
----------</PRE>
<P>In "Turbulence", it's Christmas Eve and only a handful of passengers
are on board the 747 bound for LA from New York. I t looks like an
easy flight for the crew, until four federal marshals, accompanying
psycho serial killer, Ryan Weaver, played by Ray Liotta, and psycho
bankrobber, Stubbs, played by Brandon Gleeson (Mel Gibsons sidekick,
Hamish, in "Braveheart") arrive on board, dampening any holiday cheer.</P>
<P>As the flight approaches a Level 6 (on a grade of 1 to 6) storm,
things get interesting in the passenger cabin as Stubbs decides to
change the order of things. The ensuing melee results in the death of
Stubbs, the four Feds and both pilots, leaving Weaver to stalk the
kind of prey he likes - the frightened, confused flight attendant,
Teri Halloran, played by Lauren Holly.</P>
<P>A cat and mouse suspense story follows  with Teri desperately trying
to land the plane, while Weaver, just as desperately, trying to crash
the 747 into LAX and go out in a blaze of glory.</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Well, there are bad films and there are "bad" films. The former kind,
films like "Jingle All The Way", "Dear God", "High School High" or
"Mixed Nuts" are just plain bad. If you saw them, unless I warned you
first, I feel sad for you. You wasted your time and money.</P>
<P>Then there are "bad" films, such as "Turbulence" and last year's "The
Substitute", starring Tom Berringer. These movies stack implausibility
upon implausibility in such a god-awfully groaning way that you simply
have to laugh. Coupling the real humor the filmmakers were injecting
into the story and dialogue  with the silliness of the scripts
stupidity makes this a not bad bit of mindless entertainment.</P>
<P>To its credit, "Turbulence" spends a good amount of the on-screen cash
on the terrific special effects, from the computer derived external
shots of the 747 flying through a most violent storm, to the giant
gimbals used to turn a life size 747 passenger cabin a full 360
degrees - with actors on board!</P>
<P>With the exception of Ray Liotta, who seemed to have a hell of a good
time mugging it up for the camera, there really is not a lot of
substance to the acting here. Lauren Holly, too often, gives the image
of a deer caught in the headlights on the road - her performance will
be compared with Karen Black's from "Airport '75".</P>
<P>"Turbulence" is a no-brain hoot if you have absolutely nothing of
worth to do as an alternate choice. Go to a matinee to see it on the
big screen, or wait for rental.</P>
<P>Teri Halloran, in the end, does find her man, you'll be glad to know.</P>
<PRE>I give "Turbulence" a guilty C+</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>This film's been panned, but I thought it was a hoot!  "Turbulence" is
one of those so-bad-it's-almost good kind of entertainments.  In fact,
it's far funnier than most of the so-called comedies that ended the
year ("Dear God," "Jingle All the Way").</P>
<P>The stage of unbelievability is set when a Christmas Eve 747 flight
from New York City to L.A. has only about a half dozen passengers.
Until, that is, a convicted armed robber and a lonely-hearts serial
killer (Ray Liotta) are brought on board by four federal marshalls.</P>
<P>Flight attendant Lauren Holly, just dumped by her fiance, is
vulnerable and only wants to meet a nice guy - why, just the type of
woman Liotta's serial killer preys on!</P>
<P>The dumb-as-a-post pilot and co-pilot are killed in short order while
the plane's heading into a level 6 storm with a serial killer who
means to thumb his nose at the autorities by ensuring the plane will
crash into a heavily populated area.  This, of course, results in
officials making a decision to send out a jet fighter to shoot the
commerical airliner down.  As if she doesn't have enough problems on
her hands, Lauren Holly must attempt to land the plane safely with the
radio assistance of a noble and handsome British pilot played by Ben
Cross.</P>
<P>The special effects are pretty good for such a silly plot, especially
during the hilarious climax when Holly's first landing attempt is
aborted after a low swoop over a parking garage gets a Ford truck
stuck to the plane's landing gear.  </P>
<P>Ray Liotta chews scenery and swills Mumm Cordon Rouge throughout!
Lauren Holly looks terrified!  The ground crew is conflicted!</P>
<P>It may have been dumb, but it was a guilty pleasure.</P>
