<PRE>   Note:  Some may consider portions of the following text to
          be spoilers.  Be forewarned.</PRE>
<P>The onslaught of film adaptations based upon Shakespeare's plays in
recent years (among them being RICHARD III, OTHELLO, and the upcoming
HAMLET and ROMEO & JULIET) continues with Trevor Nunn's first feature
in ten years, TWELFTH NIGHT, a comedy of mistaken identities and
genders. Despite a cast with impressive credentials, the end result is
a dreary film, punctuated with stacattos of bemusement.</P>
<P>After a shipwreck off the coast of fictional country Illyria separates
twins Viola (Imogen Stubbs) and Sebastian (Stephen Mackintosh), Viola
is distraught.  Mistakenly believing her brother to be dead, she
disguises herself as a young man and enters the services of Duke Orsino
(Toby Stephens), and on his behalf attempts to court Countess Olivia
(Helena Bonham Carter).  Confusion reigns as Olivia instead falls for
the disguised Viola, who's now going under the name "Cesario", while
Viola herself becomes enamored with Orsino. Meanwhile, boozing Sir
Toby Belch (Mel Smith) and wacky Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Richard E. Grant)
mischievously torment Olivia's repressed manservant, Malvolio (Nigel
Hawthorne), with a forged love letter.</P>
<P>Despite the classic material, the film seems to lose the comedy in the
circumstances, and most of the laughs instead come from various reaction
shots from the characters to the unfolding situations.  The subplot
involving Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Malvolio proves
to be both overlong and completely disinteresting, and is saved only
by a wildly amusing performance by Nigel Hawthorne from sinking the film.</P>
<P>The other bright spot in the film is a solid lead performance by Imogen 
Stubbs as Viola/Cesario.  Possibly best known in North America for her
performance as Lucy Steele in Ang Lee's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (1995),
here Stubbs invests a great degree of pluck in her character, making her
performance eminently watchable.</P>
<P>The film's pacing suffers greatly from the subplot; after investing much
time in setting up the situation and introducing the various characters,
the film's momentum screeches to a halt midway through as the subplot is
played out, before picking up again to the film's inevitable merry
conclusion.  TWELFTH NIGHT's look is surprisingly dark and cold
considering the general tone of the material.</P>
<P>Commercial prospects for TWELFTH NIGHT are probably modest.  The film
lacks A-list star power, and will likely not generate the raving
word-of-mouth required to convert this film into a mainstream hit.  As
such, TWELFTH NIGHT would probably expect a successful run in arthouse
theatres.</P>
<P>TWELFTH NIGHT is a passable and relatively faithful adaptation of
Shakespeare's classic play.  However, it fails to exploit the inherent
comedy of the situation, and one would expect more, particularly from
a cast of such calibre given such source material.  On my four-star scale,
I give TWELFTH NIGHT two stars.</P>
