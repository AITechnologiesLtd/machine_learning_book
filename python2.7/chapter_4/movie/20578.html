<PRE>                               TWO HANDS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Pandemonium erupts when an amateur
          criminal on an errand for a local hood loses
          $10,000.  The film certainly has its funny moments
          and if this was the first film of its type, this
          clever and inventive film could have been a real
          standout.  Unfortunately LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO
          SMOKING BARRELS came out first and there is
          insufficient reason to see both.  There are just
          too many similar films being made.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Things are starting to go right in Jimmy's world.  Until now Jimmy
(played by Heath Ledger) has been a street hawker for a second rate
Sydney strip club.  But Jimmy has fallen in love with Alex (Rose
Byrne), a woman he has seen outside the club.  And a local gangster
Pando (Bryan Brown) offers a small job as courier to Jimmy.  What Jimmy
does not know is that Pando killed Jimmy's brother.  Now Pando wants to
make things up to Jimmy and offers him a job that could lead to bigger
things if Jimmy does not screw up this first job.  Of course we would
not have much of a story if something did not go wrong.  In a careless
moment Jimmy loses $10,000.  Now Jimmy needs $10,000 to square things
with Pando and a few of his friends want to see Jimmy dead.  Before the
film PULP FICTION was made this all could have been a fairly serious
matter.  But now we expect crime films to have really strange dialog
and really weird interconnected plots with very strange twists and odd
characters.</P>
<P>     Heath Ledger is a good actor and carries his part well.  Bryan
Brown is particularly enjoyable as a vicious hood by profession but
also a caring and loving family man at home.  There are occasional
astonishing touches like the Narrator from Hell.</P>
<P>     This is not a bad little film.  One of the people in a Cairns
audience said it was the best Australian film he had seen in a long
time.  I can believe it.  The real problem is the timing.  TWO HANDS is
just one more creative, violent, semi- comedic crime film made in the
wake of PULP FICTION.  Its pacing and its plotting remind one a lot of
LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  And in the comparison it is
nearly but not quite as good.  My recommendation for Showtime Australia
is put this film in a vault for five years and release it again when it
will again be fresh and a discovery. I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
