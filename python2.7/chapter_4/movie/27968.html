IN THE DARK/Jonathan Richards</PRE>
<PRE>GEORGE WASHINGTON</PRE>
<P>Written & Directed by David Gordon Green</P>
<PRE>Plan B     NR     89 min.</PRE>
<P>      First off, let's be clear: this movie is not about George 
Washington.  Expect no powdered wigs, no wooden teeth, no dollars across 
the Potomac.  It is a movie about the end of childhood, the end of 
innocence, but despite one shocking tragedy, it is an innocence that 
trails off under the weight of its own inevitability.</P>
<P>     The movie centers around a group of pre-teens in a small, decaying 
southern town.  Most of them are black, but it's a racially mixed 
society.  The narrator is Nasia (Candace Evanofski), a self-possessed 
12-year-old who has just broken up with Buddy (Curtis Cotton III) 
because, as she tells their older friend Vernon (Damien Jewan Lee), he's 
too immature.  "He's thirteen, you're twelve," says the exasperated 
Vernon, "you're supposed to be little kids!"  Nasia has transferred her 
affections to George (Donald Holden), pretty much without George's 
participation or consent.  Buddy sighs "I miss having her to talk to 
about my feelings," which doesn't sound all that immature.</P>
<P>     Aside from the tragedy, nothing much happens.  This movie has 
little to do with story.  It has to do with moments.  It's 
impressionistic, bits of light captured with short strokes, the languor 
of everyday life reflected in a defiantly uneventful style, beautifully 
photographed by Tim Orr (on film, not digital, an unusual pleasure in a 
contemporary no-budget picture.)  Girls brush each other's hair and talk 
about boys and kissing.  Boys roughhouse and splash in the public 
swimming pool.  George adopts a stray dog, which he has to keep hidden 
because his Uncle Damascus (Eddie Rouse) hates animals.</P>
<P>     Perhaps as much as anything it's about dreaming.  Vernon and his 
nine-year-old white girlfriend Sonya (Rachael Handy) dream of getting 
away together, and abortively steal a car.  Buddy dreams of getting 
Nasia back; he also dons a rubber dragon mask to change his identity.  
Nasia dreams of what a great man George will be.  And George dreams of 
being a superhero.  "I want to be the strongest man in the world," he 
says.  George is soft in the head, both figuratively and literally - he 
has to wear a helmet. After he's acclaimed a hero for saving a boy from 
drowning, despite the fact that he's not supposed to go in the water 
because of his fragile head, he dons a superhero's cape and tights for 
the rest of the picture. </P>
<P>     First feature director David Gordon Green has assembled a cast of 
non-actors, and they're wonderful.  As a general rule, the younger they 
are the better they are; only some of the young adult men show a visible 
self-consciousness in front of the camera. </P>
<P>     Evanofski's narrative voice is reminiscent of Terence Malick's Days 
of Heaven, and so is the sleepy semi-pastoral style.  "I like to go to 
beautiful places," she says, "where there's waterfalls and empty 
fields." </P>
