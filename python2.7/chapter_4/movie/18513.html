<PRE>Five Easy Pieces (1970)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 95</PRE>
<P>"Five Easy Pieces" was one of three films starring
Jack Nicholson that were directed, co-written, and
co-produced by Bob Rafelson (the other films were
the weird Monkees flop "Head" and the more
successful "The King of Marvin Gardens").  The film's
lead character, an intelligent but angry drifter,
was ideally suited for Nicholson.</P>
<P>Nicholson plays Robert Dupea, who comes from an
upper-class family of classical musicians.  Nicholson
is a former pianist (the film's title refers to a
beginner's guide to the piano), but he currently
works as an oilman.  He again has the urge to run,
because he does not want to commit to his stupid,
clinging, pregnant girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black).</P>
<P>Robert learns that his father (William Challee)
has had an incapacitating stroke.  He returns home
to visit his family, which includes sister Partita
(Lois Smith) and brother Carl (Ralph Waite).
Robert soon finds something to do at home: start
a heated affair with Carl's fiancee Catherine
(Susan Anspach).</P>
<P>While Nicholson gives a fine performance, the
female supporting cast steals the show.  Black,
Smith, and Anspach are excellent. Helena Kallianiotes
and Toni "Oh Mickey, you're so fine" Basil have
terrific supporting roles as a pair of dike
hitchhikers.  Sally Struthers plays one of
Nicholson's 'girlfriends', and has a topless scene
(No, it isn't frightening).  There is also a score
featuring some of Tammy Wynette's best songs.</P>
<P>The film's most famous scene involves a confrontation
between Nicholson and a no-nonsense waitress.
He wants to order a simple breakfast that isn't
on the menu, but she'll have none of it.  If you
haven't seen the scene, it is certainly worth the
trip to the video store.  But the film's real
strength isn't the comic relief provided by Nicholson,
Black and Kallianiotes, but in the character study
of Robert Dupea.  He is a rebellious, philandering,
wandering bastard, but he is also ashamed of his
weaknesses, which are clearly out of control.</P>
<P>"Five Easy Pieces" received Oscar nominations for
Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay (Rafelson
and Carol Eastman).  Nicholson was nominated for Best
Actor, while Black was nominated for Best Supporting
Actress.</P>
