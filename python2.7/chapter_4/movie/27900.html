<PRE>FAITHLESS
---------</PRE>
<P>When Marianne (Lena Endre, "Kristin Lavransdotter") takes her and her husband's
best friend David (Krister Henriksson) as a lover, she never anticipates the
tragic events which will follow in writer Ingmar Bergman and director Liv 
Ullmann's "Faithless."</P>
<P>On a remote island, a writer named Bergman (Erland Josephson, "Scenes From
a Marriage") sifts through the contents of a desk drawer, trying to draw
inspiration from memories.  (Bergman purportedly wrote this script based on
an incident from earlier in his life that's continued to haunt him, although
he gave Ullmann complete control over the film.)  Marianne comes to him and 
begins to recount her painful story under his gentle prodding.</P>
<P>Marianne is a successful actress with a happy marriage to a world-reknowned
composer/conducter Markus (Thomas Hanzon, "Private Confessions").  They have
a 9 year old daughter Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).  Their friend, David, 
a film director with a messy life, frequently joins them for dinner
and acts as an uncle to their daughter.  When Marianne encounters David drunk
and distraught one day, she brings him home.  He suggests they sleep together.  
She laughs it off, proclaiming their relationship like that of brother and 
sister, but the idea takes root.  Marianne, who's won a scholarship to study 
in Paris while Markus is away on a U.S. tour, talks David into a 'happenstance' 
meeting on the continent.</P>
<P>Trouble rears its head almost immediately, when Marianne discovers David's
childish behavior coupled with intense jealousy.  When an initial incident
is smoothed over, their emotional bond becomes stronger - what Marianne had
convinced herself she was doing for 'fun' has become hurtful.  When she leaves
their Parisian hotel room, David pulls a red bedspread over his head and 
Ullman cuts to Isabelle with a white and red bedspread over her head.  This
connects David to the child as well as pointing out Isabelle as the next
victim of Marianne's hurt.  </P>
<P>Marianne can't keep herself from David when they return.  As his actors in
'A Dream Play' rebel, a distraught David asks Marianne to 'come look at your
idiot,' appealing to her vanity.  Markus discovers the lovers and promises
Marianne he will make her hurt, demanding custody of Isabelle.  That's just
the beginning of the hellish descent Marianne continues to agonize over with
Bergman, accusing him of laziness while allowing her, an actress, to shape
his drama out of her real memories.</P>
<P>This bleak and talky Swedish drama is like watching a train wreck.  Lena
Endre's expressive face (beautifully lit by cinematographer Jorgen Persson,
"Smilla's Sense of Snow") keeps our attention whether she's telling her
story or admidst the action of flashback.  Ullmann's deliberate pacing allows
a sickening, gut-wrenching sense of dread to build.  Her staging of Bergman
and Marianne suggest a mentor/student relationship which flows in both 
directions.  Again she uses duality as she shows Marianne and her reflection 
in a mirror, suddenly separated by the ghostly appearance of Isabelle.
Ullmann's direction is strong although Bergman's presence is always evident.
Lena Endre's performance is devastating.</P>
<P>"Faithless" is an open wound of a film, yet its humanity brings a heartfelt  
message.  When Marianne tells Bergman that talking about love is painful, one 
can't help but think that this film will make it far more difficult to ever 
take love for granted.</P>
