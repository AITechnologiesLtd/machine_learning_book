Play It to the Bone</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>There is little of interest in the first third of this film beyond
pretentiously quirky characters spewing meant-to-be-cute retorts at cliché
beats, devoid of punch.</P>
<P>Then comes Antonio Banderas' monologue. He intimately relives a scarring
fight experience at the garden. It's "Bone's" breath of life. From there,
the beat becomes more personal, the retorts more endearing, a few even evoke
deep laughter from this previously antsy viewer.</P>
<P>Used-to-be's, Banderas and Harrelson, now boxing buddies (who supposedly
have never fought each other) stumble across an opportunity to clear their
good names -- and of course, win a title shot. Lolita Davidovich plays the
domineering ex-girl who routes for them both.</P>
<P>The film crowns during the fight scene (big match between Woody and Antonio)
as many a star make a ringside cameos. This lengthy sequence is so
passionately directed and photographed, that it seems the rest of the film
is merely a convenient frame for its display.</P>
<P>I use the word "crown" instead of climax, because the picture never quite
pops. The writers seem to have gone out of their way to create a film with
absolutely no payoff. Perhaps it's some kind of inside joke that I don't
get.</P>
