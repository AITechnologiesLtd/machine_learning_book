<PRE>THE KING AND I
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The King and I at first seems like simply an animated adaptation of the
Broadway musical. But, upon closer inspection, it is a actually only
partially an adaptation, mixing in new "kid-friendly" (and very
familiar) characters and subplots. Unfortunately, the two never quite
mix, and the resulting movie is too adult for kids, and too childlike
for adults.</P>
<P>Those familiar with the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical will recognize
the rough outline of the plot.  A British schoolteacher, Anna (Miranda
Richardson, Christiane Noll singing), travels to Siam to be the tutor to
the children of the King (Martin Vidnovic).</P>
<P>Forbidden love is very much the subject of the film, occurring not once,
but twice.  Anna falls in love with the King, but, more unforgivably,
the King's eldest son falls in love with a servant girl.</P>
<P>The cartoon adds another plot, in an attempt to keep the kiddies
interested. The King's advisor, The Kralahome (Ian Richardson), is
plotting to steal the throne of Siam for himself.  He plans to use his
wizardly powers of illusion to convince the British to move in and
replace the King. To add comic relief, he has a bumbling (and rather
stereotypical) sidekick, Master Little (Darrell Hammond).</P>
<P>It is the addition of this secondary plot that leads to many of the
problems with The King and I.  Children will find the "forbidden love"
plot dull and uninteresting, and adults will find the evil wizard plot
painful and distracting.  Rather than seeming like one film, able to be
enjoyed on multiple levels, The King and I feels like two half-completed
films, neither of which is satisfactory.</P>
<P>This might be forgivable if both plots could stand by themselves.
However, the romantic plot has been gutted to a mere shell of itself.
And the scheming-royal-counselor bit was done much better (and with much
more humor) in Aladdin.</P>
<P>The animation of The King and I is better than your standard
direct-to-television fare, but not by much.  It certainly doesn't hold a
candle to most recent animated feature films.</P>
<P>The film's strongest point is easily its music.  Despite all of the
nonsensical distractions onscreen (whose idea was it to add a fire
breathing dragon to this story?), the tunes still manage to hold their
own.</P>
<P>The end result of The King and I is rather pointless.  Children who are
too young to be entertained by the main plot will find only slight
distractions in the questionable comic relief.  Older kids would
probably enjoy the 1956 musical just as well.  It's certainly hard to
recommend a film that plays better with your eyes closed.</P>
