<P>"Hanging Up" is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is the only one 
I can think of that made me want to pull out a gun and start shooting at the 
images onscreen. It's a horrible experience, as if somebody had discovered my 
pet peeves and decided to devote a whole film to winding me up. Although I 
own a cellphone and am acquainted with whiny women, they are both things I 
detest, and for emergencies only. Watching them for 95 minutes is not my idea 
of a good time.</P>
<P>The film is supposed to be the story of a man's family reacting to his 
descent into death. It's actually just an irritating bunch of phone 
conversations between three witless sisters, who might actually develop 
personalities if they cancelled their AT&T subscriptions and lived in the 
real world. Meg Ryan plays Eve, the one who stays by her father's hospital 
bed, deals with his eruptions of dementia, and calls up everyone else, trying 
to get them to visit him. Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), the youngest sibling, is an 
insecure little tramp who complains that nobody will take her seriously; she 
doesn't think it odd that at age 29 she was still dreaming of becoming a rock 
star, and in her mid-30s she expects she's going to be an actress. Georgia 
(Diane Keaton), the eldest, is smarmy, dishonest and lies about her personal 
life when it will bring her gain.</P>
<P>So much of "Hanging Up" takes place on the phone, with the annoying trio 
barking insipid platitudes down receivers, that when I left the cinema my 
ears were still ringing from clicks, beeps and dial tones. Perhaps this movie 
was inevitable, such is contemporary society's obsession with 
telecommunication. Delia and Nora Ephron, who wrote the screenplay, and Diane 
Keaton, the director, seem to think this presentation of people is normal, 
and that's rather sad.</P>
<P>Worse is the grating nature of the performances. Keaton plays her detestable 
character with the kind of glee that shoves right into our faces and makes us 
want to scream. Ryan is unconvincing, because she uses the same disorganised 
comic presence as in "When Harry Met Sally" and "Joe Versus the Volcano", and 
expects it to work when her character is supposed to be a cornerstone of 
emotional stability. As for Lisa Kudrow, well, she's a joke, who exudes 
stupidity from all of her phoney body, dead eyes, and flat, sarcastic whimper 
of a voice.</P>
<P>You know when you're on a crowded train, and you're wedged into the window 
seat when three other people need to sit in the same booth as you? "Hanging 
Up" is a lot like that, as long as the three people are vapid yuppie bitches 
whining and crying about their boyfriends and families into mobile telephones 
that play a little tune when they ring. This is a film that could get 
Gandhi's blood boiling. If it becomes your wife's favourite video, no sane 
jury will convict you of domestic abuse.</P>
