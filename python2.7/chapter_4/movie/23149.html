<P>Some words of warning: "Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch. The film,
which chronicles the events leading up to the December 30, 1993 death of
21-year old Teena Brandon, features images of intense brutality,
including an almost unbearably realistic rape scene. Even in its quiet
moments, a sense of impending doom washes over the screen. This is
powerful moviemaking. Over two months have passed since the critics'
screening of the film, but it still remains vividly etched in my memory.</P>
<P>So why should you subject yourself to "Boys Don't Cry?" Because it will
transport you to a place you (hopefully) have never been before. After
experiencing this film, you'll have a better understanding of
homophobia, of misogyny, of unbridled hated. You'll have a better
understanding of compulsive, self-destructive behavior. After spending
two hours in Falls City, Nebraska, those shrieking yahoos on "The Jerry
Springer Show" won't seem so comical anymore.</P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" is based on a true story. As usual, the filmmakers
change some facts, including a couple of significant ones, but the core
of truth remains. On a regular basis, Teena Brandon strapped down her
breasts, stuffed a tube sock into her jeans and headed out to live and
love as a man named Brandon Teena.</P>
<P>Teena was a fairly convincing man. His gait, mannerisms and vocal
cadences were credible. Only when he feared his physical gender was
about to be revealed did his feminine traits betray the disguise. Make
no mistake, Teena was neither a gay activist nor a gay saint. A product
of a socio-economic underclass where ignorance is the norm, Teena acted
out of a drive he couldn't explain or contain. Following heartfelt
warnings from friends and numerous scrapes with locals and the law,
Teena simply moved his actions to a neighboring town.</P>
<P>There Teena (Hilary Swank) becomes friends with John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III), a pair of ex-cons
given to heavy partying and bursts of violence. He also meets, and falls
in love with, young Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny), remaining oblivious to
the fact that Lotter and Tisdel had once been involved, and that the
volatile Lotter still pines for his ex.</P>
<P>And so the pattern for disaster falls into place. As Teena and Tisdel
draw closer, the good old boys get more twitchy. Sitting in the theater
knowing what's coming, you want to climb into the screen, grab Teena and
shout, "Snap out of it! These people are dangerous! Pack your gear, move
to a college town and hit a gay bar, for Christ's sake!"</P>
<P>No such luck. Teena continues his dance with doom, just as so many
others do. While the individual story of Brandon Teena is particularly
nightmarish, especially in light of the increase in violent assaults
against gays, it is just one of many. Teena also represents every woman
who stays in an abusive relationship with a man; every aging gay male
who pretends his trophy boy loves him for his soul and not his money,
every person who remains in terrible circumstances because they see no
alternative.</P>
<P>There's more. Watch the men in this story. Their contempt of women is
overwhelming and all too common. When they learn of Teena's true
physical gender, the motivation behind their horrific reactions is
blurred. Is it because of the deception, because of the gay thing, or
because they have learned that their buddy is (shudder) a lowly female?</P>
<P>The visceral power of "Boys Don't Cry" comes from the skills of director
Kimberly Peirce and a slew of amazing performers. Hilary Swank, a Best
Actress Oscar nominee for her work here, is astounding as Teena. At no
point in the film does she ever hit a single false note. Chloe Sevigny,
a nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category, works magic, using
her languid eyes and tentative smile to great effect. And don't overlook
the guys – Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III are skilled enough to
humanize their characters, making their outbursts all the more chilling.</P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" is difficult to watch, but I hope you'll make the trip.
In addition to seeing a hell of a good movie, you'll get a tour of the
darker portions of our societal landscape, where monsters in baseball
caps cruise the streets, striking out blindly at anything they do not
understand.</P>
