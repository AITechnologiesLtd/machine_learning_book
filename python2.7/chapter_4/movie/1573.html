<PRE>                              BOB ROBERTS
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1992 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     Tim Robbins plays a right-wing Christian fundamentalist folk singer
who is running for Senator from Pennsylvania.  The movie is supposed to
be funny (it started as a "Saturday Night Live" skit), with Robbins
singing songs like "Times are Changing Back" and "Complain, Complain,
Complain" (about welfare recipients).  But it's also supposed to be a
serious attack on our present political structure, as it raises several
familiar issues: for example, the import of drugs into this country to
finance the Contras and diversion of money from failed S&Ls into
right-wing causes.</P>
<P>     The problem with this film is that it never quite gets to be either
a parody or an "enhanced" documentary, like JFK.  You have on the one
hand Gore Vidal (as the incumbent senator) railing against the NSC
secretly running the country, and on the other hand song lyrics
something like "We marched for the poor, we marched to be free, we
marched for self-interest..." and "This land is my land, this land is
our land...."  It's a little too serious to be funny, and a little too
funny to be serious.</P>
<P>     It's still fun, though.  Giancarlo Esposito is great as the
anti-establishment reporter who follows Bob Roberts around and digs up
the dirt connecting him with a failed S&L and drug-running (somehow he
seems to have avoided being caught up with INSLAW, unless one of his
employees was discussing it in German or Japanese).  Tim Robbins himself
has just about the right blend of passion and humor that a right-wing
folk singer would have.  Some of his followers acquire the hypnotized
eyes of youth before an idol, and that's fun too.  The MTV videos are
quite good, blending the kind of quirkiness that would appeal to the
young with right wing passion.  And there are a lot of cameo
appearances; it's almost as if this film had the same kind of appeal for
stars wanting to make as statement with a day or two of work that JFK
did.</P>
<P>     But I wish that Robbins (who directed the film) had either
restrained himself and made the movie as an ironic send-up of right-wing
politics, or really let himself go, the way Oliver Stone did, and really
tried to convince us that all this was true, more or less.  These days,
with Bush all but defeated, in significant part because of the
prominence of right-wing fundamentalists during the Republican
convention, simply raising the spectre of the right wing doesn't provide
enough scare value to drive a film.</P>
