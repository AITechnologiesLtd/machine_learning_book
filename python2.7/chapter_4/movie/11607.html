<PRE>THE REAL BLONDE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Tom Dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in
superficial careers, all searching for deeper meaning. However, they
won't find much meaning in The Real Blonde, and not enough real humor,
either.</P>
<P>Joe (Matthew Modine) is a struggling actor, or he claims to be one, even
though he has no credits under his belt.  His girlfriend, Mary
(Catherine Keener) has no pretensions about her career:  she's a makeup
artist, working for the eccentric fashion photographer Blair (Marlo
Thomas) and supermodel of the month, Sahara (Bridgette Wilson).</P>
<P>Sahara, who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of
The Little Mermaid, has an on-again, off-again relationship with Joe's
best friend, Bob (Maxwell Caulfield).  However, Bob has gotten his
biggest break yet:  a starring role on a soap opera opposite the
beautiful Kelly (Daryl Hannah), who may be that illusive woman he's
always pursued: a real blonde.</P>
<P>There are some moments of good humor in The Real Blonde, but not enough.
The best stuff is in throwaway details in the background, such as
Sahara's perfume ads: "Depression - It's Not Just a State of Mind". But
to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot
fish in a barrel.</P>
<P>And, unfortunately, the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are
pathetic.  Take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and
her dog.  The story serves absolutely no purpose, makes little sense,
and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie.</P>
<P>Matthew Modine and Catherine Keener have the most sympathetic characters
in the film, but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines.  Modine
whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched
against someone stronger than Elizabeth Berkley, who appears as another
struggling actor.  Keener's character has a stronger edge, but the
insult self-defense class (taught by Denis Leary, no less) she is stuck
in makes little sense.</P>
<P>The movie's running time is under two hours, but it seems like it is
well over it. There's just not enough humor to speed things along, and
not enough meaning to propel any drama.</P>
