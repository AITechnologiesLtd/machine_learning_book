<P>"Varsity Blues" is an utterly formulaic teen sports, sex and suds 
potboiler that flirts with serious issues, only to dive back to the 
comforting safety of clichés. Aimed at young, uncritical audiences, the 
film dutifully trots out everything you'd expect from a hack exploitation 
movie. There's the idealistic hero, complete with a devoted girlfriend, a 
gorgeous temptress, and parents who just don't understand. There's the 
standard-issue football team, comprised of one all-American quarterback 
to be worshipped by all, one muscular party monster to whoop it up and 
bare his ass, one fat guy to be comical and sad, one black guy to suffer 
nobly, and, of course, the big, bad coach, a thundering racist bully who 
badgers injured players into taking steroid injections. Finally, there's 
the plot, which... well, suffice to say it all builds up to THE BIG GAME. 
Ain't Hollywood grand?</P>
<P>Rather than trudging through the usual review formalities, I'll just 
share a few minor observations about "Varsity Blues." SPOILER ALERT: The 
following contains references to key plot points. </P>
<P>1.  I understand the Hollywood convention of having actors play 
characters considerably younger than their actual age, but there is no 
way on Earth that any of this film's stars could pass themselves off as 
high school students. In fact, several of them look more like high school 
teachers.
2.  Because "Varsity Blues" is set in a small Texas town, some cast 
members strive for authenticity by adopting Southern accents ranging from 
a fairly credible drawl to twangs straight out of "The Beverly 
Hillbillies." As is the cinematic norm, most of the actors periodically 
forget their accents, only to recall them later. Other performers skip 
the accents entirely, sounding like their characters just moved to West 
Canaan from Santa Monica.
3.  In "Dawson's Creek," James Van Der Beek's head appears far too big 
for his body, but it looks almost normal here. Whatever you're doing, 
James, keep it up!
4.  Who in the world chose Ron Lester to play the team's obligatory fat 
guy? The young actor is so morbidly obese that I doubt if he could carry 
a sack of groceries up a flight of stairs without getting winded, let 
alone play a football game. It was hard to enjoy Lester's scenes because 
I caught myself fearing for his health - - and I am not joking. 
5.  You're a young, strong, intelligent black student being verbally 
abused and physically endangered by an authority figure. What should you 
do? Why, wait passively until a white student comes to the rescue! Oh, 
the wonderful messages Hollywood sends to teenagers.
6.  One of the film's subplots involves several team players visiting a 
strip bar, where they discover their sex-ed teacher moonlighting as a 
dancer. When she leaves the stage, she pleads with the boys to "keep her 
secret." Keep her secret?! Unless every other male in a 50 mile radius of 
the bar is gay, I'm betting word of her "secret" just might have already 
leaked out.
7.  Speaking of logic, here's a brief memo to Coach Kilmer: if you're 
going to illegally inject steroids into the leg of a seriously injured 
player... close the damn door.
8.  A bit more about the Coach. Here we have a guy with an unbelievable 
winning streak, a man so beloved that that town has built a statue of him.
 So why is he still coaching in Hooterville?
9.  A note to Jon Voight: For the love of Pete, would you please play a 
good guy for a change? And while you're at it, hold out for a better part 
next time.
10.  Finally, if you are trying to inspire your fellow players that the 
"winning is everything" philosophy is wrong, you'd be well advised to 
avoid urging them to "go out there and play like gods."</P>
<P>The bottom line is this. Formula movies don't have to be bad. "Hoosiers" 
used every genre convention in the book, but the film came splendidly to 
life because the filmmakers created an absolutely authentic feel and 
invested the story with genuine passion. As long as video stores stock 
"Hoosiers," there is no reason to watch pap like "Varsity Blues."</P>
