<PRE>                             THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE
                       A film review by Andrew Abramson
                        Copyright 1995 Andrew Abramson</PRE>
<P>     On September 26, 1969, the most annoying TV theme song of all
times aired.  The theme song to the Brady Bunch.  The show was sure to
be a bomb.  Who would have known, that twenty-five years and five
months later, the show would still be going strong, and a movie would
be made.  Yes the Brady Bunch remained on the air for five years, and
did great on syndication, and finally a movie was made.  The movie was
up to date for the rest of the world, but it was still the same old
Bradys.  The movie took place in 1995.  All of Califorina had evolved
into the 90's, except for the Bradies who still wore bellbottoms, and
listened to Davy Jones on 8-Track.  It was funny to see to see the rest
of the world, react to this time-warped family.  The family was as
great as the television family.  Shelly Long played Florence
Henderson's old role as Carol, and Gary Cole played Robert Reed's old
role as Mike.</P>
<P>     Much of the humor in the movie, was seeing the rivalry between
the middle-child Jan, and the oldest-child Marsha.  Marsha has all the
glamour, and everyone loves Marsha, and Marsha this, Marsha that.  As
for Jan, she thinks that she is left out because everyone thinks Cindy
(the youngest) is so cute, and Marsha is so beautiful.</P>
<P>     Many of the scenes from the movie, are taken from actual
episodes, just updated.  The movie makes fun at the episodes, and
exaggerates them extremely.  Some of the best parts in the movie, is
seeing Marsha say how beautiful she is, and Jan's "voices" in her
head.  Watch for Cindy's lisp, and Greg's "far-out, groovy" music.</P>
<P>     The movie also revolves around an interesting plot.  The man next
door has to sell every house in the neighborhood, so he has to somehow,
stop the Bradies from earning 20,000 dollars.</P>
<P>     Watch for some cameo appearances by the original Carol, Peter,
and of course, who could forget maid Alice.  If you watched the orignal
TV series, and enjoy humor, this is the movie for you!!</P>
