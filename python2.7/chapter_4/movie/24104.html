<PRE>`Keeping the Faith' – Praiseworthy
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>`Keeping the Faith' is a charming and entertaining
romantic comedy about friendship, fellowship, and
forgiveness.  The warmth that emanates from this film
lies within its message of
‘love-one-another-and-love-thyself.'  But the real
appeal stems from the sunniness radiated by cast
members Ed Norton, Ben Stiller, and Jenna Elfman who
play three old friends that reunite and who become
funnily entangled in a love triangle.</P>
<P>Brian Finn (Ed Norton) and Jake Schram (Ben Stiller)
have been close friends since the 8th grade, and as
they grew up, they answered similar callings.  Brian
becomes a priest while Jake grows up to become a
rabbi.  Things are going well for the both of them. 
They are now powerful spiritual leaders in their New
York West Side community.  Affectionately known as the
`God Squad,' these two give sermons in front of
standing-room-only audiences. </P>
<P>One of Brian's and Jake's fondest memories was that of
Anna Reilly, another 8th grader who was the coolest
and hippest girl that they had ever known.  She had
moved away that year, but is now returning to New York
for a job.  Anna is all grown up now. She's a single,
sexy, business professional.  The three reunite and
they are enraptured by her indomitable wit and erotic
power.  </P>
<P>She's a tremendously busy woman who has no time for a
relationship.  She's great at what she does, but she
works 100 hours a week and misses the emotional
satisfaction of being touched and held.  Yet, she
doesn't say this as some kind of empty confession. 
There's a soft smile and an inviting wink that
accompanies her statement.  Perhaps she's developed an
attraction for either Brian or Jake.  This development
creates a problematic situation.  As friends, it
causes an awkward tension.  Even worse, Anna's
magnetism is taxing Brian's vows of celibacy while
Jake realizes that dating someone outside his faith
would jeopardize his standing among his congregates. 
This issue is made all the more salient by Jake's mom
(Anne Bancroft) who seems adamant against interfaith
marriages.  When their desires finally play out, we
can only hope that these three lifelong friends will
continue to remain close because they are so likeable.</P>
<P>The movie also provides additional comical nuggets of
the two clerics' lives.  The beginning sequence charts
Brian's and Jake's earlier days with their houses of
worship.  We laugh when Jake faints during a
circumcision or when Brian accidentally sets his
cassock on fire.  Another funny sequence involves a
shopping trip for a karaoke machine.  The salesperson
uses every dishonorable tactic to get them to buy the
machine, unaware that he's lying to a man of God. 
There's also an ongoing story about the elder Jewish
women in Jake's congregate, who continually try to
introduce him to their daughters.  One introduction
results in the date from Hell.  Upon arriving back at
her apartment in a taxi, she openly invites Jake
inside and tells the taxi driver to leave.  He seems
very afraid but when she becomes overly insistent,
Jake virtually has to push his aggressive date onto
the sidewalk as he frantically commands the taxi
driver to leave as quickly as possible.   </P>
<P>The real surprise of the film is Jenna Elfman, the
star of TV's `Dharma and Greg.'  I've never seen her
television show, but I'll be sure to make an effort
now.  To watch her is to love her.  The success of the
drama rests squarely on her shoulders, but she
effortlessly rises to the occasion.  Her portrayal was
pleasing, balancing coltish femininity with a hint of
loneliness.  Meanwhile, Norton and Stiller are equally
affable.  The film moves along at a good pace and
there are plenty of lighthearted moments to keep the
audience smiling.  `Keeping the Faith' is a sweet film
that showcases cheery performances, a likeable cast,
and a sustained comical energy.</P>
