<P>     The words "A Film by Almodovar" conjure up images of the bizarre, 
the kinky, and the unapologetically unconventional.  Ever since his 1980 
debut, PEPI, LUCI, BOM, Almodovar has been lauded as Spain's golden boy 
film maker -- a director who will take any chance to obtain a desired 
result.  At times, he has been wildly successful (as in WOMEN ON THE 
VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN!).  On other 
occasions, things haven't gone nearly as well (KIKA).  But, through it 
all, Almodovar has never come close to conventionality -- until THE 
FLOWER OF MY SECRET, that is.</P>
<P>     First and foremost, barring the offbeat opening scene where two 
deadpan doctors explain to a woman that her son is brain-dead (we later 
learn that this is part of a training film, not an actual experience), 
THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET doesn't seem like Almodovar.  He treats his 
characters with an unexpected sensitivity, and his vicious, often-ribald 
sense of humor has been muted to the point of insignificance.  For the 
most part, THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET takes itself too seriously, which 
might have been okay if the primary story wasn't an example of dreary 
melodrama.</P>
<P>     Leo Macias (Marisa Parades) is a lonely author involved in a 
failing marriage.  Although she longs to write novels of substance and 
meaning, her income derives from popular, formula romances, which she 
pens under the pseudonym of Amanda Gris.  Meanwhile, her husband, Paco 
(Imanol Arias), has joined the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia to 
flee the homefront wars that he and his wife regularly engage in.  When 
asked if he thinks there's any chance to save his union with Leo, Paco 
considers for a moment before replying, "None."</P>
<P>     Much of THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET concerns Leo's journey from a lost, 
frightened dependent to someone who can stand on her own.  It's not 
always an interesting trek, but there are rewards for those who stick 
with the story.  Chief among these is Almodovar's examination of Leo's 
dual identity.  As a romance writer, she is adored by thousands of fans, 
and her next novel is awaited with breathless anticipation.  But, as a 
"serious" person, she despises Amanda Gris, even going so far as to 
write a blistering critique of her own work (under a different 
pseudonym).  The Leo/Amanda schism is fascinating, but it's often 
reduced to a background subplot, and the resolution is dissatisfying.</P>
<P>     It's strange seeing an Almodovar film without the bright, energetic 
presence of Victoria Abril, who has graced his three previous outings.  
For THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET, the leading actress is another Almodovar 
regular, Marisa Paredes, who does an excellent job portraying Leo's 
longing, insecurity, and other neuroses.  In addition to Imanol Arias as 
Paco, Juan Enchanove (as Leo's prospective suitor), Rossy de Palma (as 
her sister), and Chus Lampreave (as her mother) provide solid support.  </P>
<P>     While it's a different experience to view an Almodovar movie that 
respects, and even shows affection for, its female lead, THE FLOWER OF 
MY SECRET is far from a standout effort.  It's bland as often as it is 
affecting, and presents little that's new or original.  This is just 
another story of a woman grappling for independence while looking for 
love.  THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET shows hints of what a kinder, gentler 
Almodovar has to offer the motion picture world, but, on the whole, I 
prefer the flamboyant attitude he previously exhibited.</P>
