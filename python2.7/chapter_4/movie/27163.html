<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I can remember clearly the moment I knew "Vertical Limit" was going to be 
a disappointment. Chris O'Donnell walks through a camp at the base of K2, 
the world's second tallest mountain. Another climber, played by Izabella 
Scorupco, spots O'Donnell. And that's when The Look transpires between 
them. They look, and they look, and they look. So artificial and 
transparent is the scene that it would have worked better had Scorupco 
been wearing a big sign around her neck reading "O'Donnell's Love 
Interest" -- at least that would have been worth a chuckle.</P>
<P>But "Vertical Limit" is short on imagination, and long on predictability 
and shallowness. It is populated by characters into whom very little 
thought has obviously been invested; they exist purely to fill their roles 
in the paper-thin plot and, once they have served this role, they are 
dispensed with, one way or another. That's how you know that, inevitably, 
Scorupco and O'Donnell will end up together. Or consider the mountaineer 
Skip (Robert Taylor). His purpose in "Vertical Limit" is to use his status 
at the K2 camp to goad others into joining O'Donnell on a rescue mission. 
This accomplished, an arbitrary whim of the story shunts him out of the
action, and he practically vanishes from the screen.</P>
<P>No more inventive are the plot twists, most of which hinge on the 
canisters of nitroglycerine the characters carry with them as they 
speedily ascend K2. It's bad enough that the explosive force of the nitro 
seems to vary depending on the needs of the plot (at one point, an entire 
crateful barely destroys a shed; later, a single canister nearly 
devastates a mountainside). It's even worse that the stuff seems to 
survive any amount of jostling, unless the story demands that it suddenly 
become a peril. But the sheer stupidity of the characters around it -- 
leaving a crate, which had been carefully stowed away, open in the 
sunshine for no good reason; or, later, sitting five feet away from it 
when they know there's a good chance it might explode -- is positively 
criminal.</P>
<P>To be fair, there are some good, tense moments. Mountaineering is an 
extremely hazardous sport, and "Vertical Limit" effectively conveys the 
many disasters which can befall even the most experienced climber. One of 
the best scenes in the movie sees Scorupco trying to save a fellow 
mountaineer, who is clinging by his pickaxe to the edge of a snowy ledge. 
As Scorupco edges out toward him, the ledge slowly starts to break away, 
threatening to pitch them both into the abyss beyond. Similarly, a scene 
where O'Donnell jumps a wide chasm and barely manages to hook himself into 
the opposite mountain face is genuinely exciting (even if, in reality, he 
probably would have torn his shoulders from their sockets).</P>
<P>But the dangers become too repetitive, too quickly. There's only so many 
times a yawning chasm, an incipient avalanche, or the ubiquitous 
nitroglycerine can be brought into play and still make the audience 
anxious. Director Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "The Mask Of Zorro") 
simply doesn't find a way to make each danger seem new and rivetting.</P>
<P>Of course, it's hard to expect much from a movie which borrows from 
Sylvester Stallone's "Cliffhanger" from the word go. O'Donnell plays Peter 
Garrett, a climber along with his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and father 
Royce (Stuart Wilson). While scaling a sheer cliff face, the ineptitude of 
a couple of novice mountaineers puts the Garrett family in jeopardy, 
hanging from a single carabiner. Royce, who is on the bottom, tells Peter 
to cut him loose, since he knows the carabiner can't support the weight of 
all three of them. Reluctantly, Peter does so; in one of the movie's most 
gratuitous scenes, we then see Royce's body thud to the ground far below.</P>
<P>Three years later, Peter is a photographer for the National Geographic 
Society. He and Annie -- now a world-renowned speed climber -- are no 
longer on speaking terms, because she blames Peter for their father's 
death. By coincidence, Peter ends up in the vicinity of K2 at the same 
time as Annie, who is helping billionaire Elliott Vaughn (Bill Paxton) 
scale the peak as part of a publicity gimmick. Vaughn pretends that K2 
expert Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) is in charge of the ascent, but when bad 
weather hits and Tom wants to turn back, Vaughn goads him into continuing
on. Soon, the party is hit by a ferocious avalanche; everyone is killed 
except Vaughn, Annie and Tom, who fall into a crevasse. This leaves Peter 
to mount a desperate mission to save the trio before thirty-six hours pass 
and they all die from pulmonary edema.</P>
<P>Beyond this point, "Vertical Limit" transpires in typical disaster-movie 
fashion: a variety of supporting characters are introduced, only to be 
killed off one by one to show how truly fearsome the situation is. There 
is a villain, of course, and there is an old eccentric (Scott Glenn) who 
proves to be the key to the rescue mission, despite having a hidden agenda 
of his own. It is clear that scriptwriters Robert King and Terry Hayes 
have lifted this one step-by-step from "Screenplays For Dummies" -- 
there's not a single plot point you won't see coming a mile away.</P>
<P>Even worse, King and Hayes demonstrate no flair whatsoever for dialogue. 
"Vertical Limit" is full of overwrought, scarcely believable passages. 
There is precisely one good line in the entire film -- Taylor's 
description of Scorupco -- and even that probably won't have as much 
meaning for audiences outside of Canada.</P>
<P>Campbell does at least take good advantage of the tremendous Asian 
landscape; "Vertical Limit" is breathtaking visually, if in no other 
respects. But this is scarcely enough to save the movie as a whole. By the 
time the first wave of snow comes thundering down the mountainside, I 
found myself wishing it would sweep me out of the theatre, too.</P>
