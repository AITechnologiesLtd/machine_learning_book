<PRE>                              HEART AND SOULS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In some ways similar to ALL OF ME or A
     GUY NAMED JOE, HEART AND SOULS turns out to be a likable and
     endearing metaphysical fantasy and a real showcase for the
     physical acting talents of Robert Downey, Jr.  If this one
     catches you in the right mood, it works well.  Rating: +2 (-4
     to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The light "life after death" fantasy is still with us.  You know the
sort of film: TOPPER, A GUY NAMED JOE, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, HERE COMES
MR. JORDAN, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, even GHOST (though it had darker tones
mixed in).  They all have a nice, cushy, "death is just a change of state"
feel.  They were particularly popular during World War II when a comforting
view of death was needed.</P>
<P>     The latest entry, HEART AND SOULS, has a surprising degree of charm.
We are introduced to four people, each working out his or her life but
having unfinished business.  Destiny puts them all on the same ill-fated bus
which falls off the side of a bridge to avoid crashing into a car.  The car
just happens to contain a woman giving birth.  All four are killed along
with the driver, but the souls of the four passengers survive and are
somehow metaphysically attached to Thomas Reilly, the baby.  They are
compelled never to leave Reilly's side.  For a while they are visible to the
young boy, but when this appears to do more harm than good, they follow him
invisibly.</P>
<P>     When Reilly becomes a man (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) the souls
suddenly find they each have a mission and must appear to, and sometimes
physically possess, Reilly.</P>
<P>     Our four spirits are Charles Grodin as a singer with stage fright,
Alfre Woodard as a woman torn from the children she loved, Tom Sizemore as a
small-time hood with an attack of conscience, and Kyra Sedgwick as an overly
diffident lover.  But Downey outdoes Steve Martin's performance in ALL OF
ME, being in turn possessed by the four spirits.  Downey prior to CHAPLIN
never seemed to have much screen presence.  Now he is showing an amazing
flair for physical comedy and a tremendous versatility.</P>
<P>     There are some problems with the script.  All too often American
businesses are shown as having one conscienceless cut-throat and a bunch of
executives living off his kills.  This film falls into that same trap.  What
is more, the company that Downey's character seems to be liquidating is
apparently never save.  But in spite of that loose end, this is a likable
fantasy with some of its kooky special effects and its phantom bus.  It
might be a little sugary for some tastes, but it also has its share of
touching moments.  I rate this a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
