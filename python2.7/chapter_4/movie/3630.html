<P>     With the disaster in Oklahoma City, it's no wonder that 
distributors are so interested in Robert Palumbo's debut feature, 
FALLOUT.  The film centers around four characters trapped in an 
underground fallout shelter after their high-rise office building is 
devastated by an explosion.  With no apparent escape route, these 
executives must overcome their natural distrust and antipathy for each 
other if they're to survive.  But it's not easy, especially considering 
that one of them, Will (Keith Randolph Smith) has just been awarded the 
job of another, Dan (David Wasson), who was informed of his firing by 
hatchet-woman Rachel (Claire Beckman).  The last member of the quartet 
is Joseph (Mark Deakins), Dan's young protege. </P>
<P>     Actually, this film is far less about the explosion than about how 
the four victims cope with their situation, the inevitable feelings of 
hopelessness and alienation, and the realization that their continued 
existence depends upon each other.  With a shooting budget of $90,000, 
Palumbo couldn't film a disaster movie, so he did his best to simulate 
the catastrophe with sound effects, smoke, and fire.  FALLOUT reminds us 
that high-priced special effects aren't needed to create an exciting, 
involving story. </P>
<P>     This film could be considered a thriller or a drama -- either is 
applicable.  The taut atmosphere argues for the former; the character 
interaction for the latter.  The hallmark of FALLOUT is how these four 
plan and plot against each other.  The scene has shifted from the 
corporate boardroom to a dirty, poorly-lit basement, and the stakes are 
much higher, but too much water has flowed under the bridge for there to 
be any level of trust.  Even though Will keeps appealing for a truce, 
neither Dan nor Joseph believes him. </P>
<P>     Palumbo pays careful attention to fine detail.  At six o'clock, all 
the wristwatch alarms go off -- it's time to go home.  Cigarettes become 
expensive and water is more precious than gold.  There's a concern about 
sanitation and privacy -- facets of human existence we rarely consider 
in our day-to-day lives.  Of course, with the realization that there may 
be no rescue, the rules of civilization are stripped away, leaving 
behind four naked, barbarian souls. </P>
<P>     One of FALLOUT's few failings is a too-facile ending.  Another is 
the lack of character depth.  While we get an excellent snapshot of all 
four executives in the shelter, we learn little about their lives 
outside.  Do they have children?  Are they married?  Divorced?  In some 
cases, it's possible to infer the answers, but Palumbo doesn't seem 
especially concerned about three-dimensionality.  He's focused on these 
people as they are now, in the bunker.</P>
<P>     The men and woman of FALLOUT must face the ultimate question of 
mortality:  how to act if death is at hand.  For three quarters of the 
film, Palumbo does an excellent job exploring the issue.  With no food 
available, the characters' energy level is low, and this adds to the 
ominous sense of claustrophobia -- an atmosphere that becomes 
increasingly pervasive as the drama and tension build in tandem. </P>
