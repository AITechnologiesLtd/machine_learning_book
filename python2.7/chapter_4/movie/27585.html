<PRE>CHUNHYANG
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Beautiful but headache inducing.  Kwon-taek Im's CHUNHYANG can probably 
best be thought of as a Korean opera.  Featuring extensive sung 
narration in a type of ancient Korean music called pansori, which 
features a male singer whose singing sounds more like screaming, the 
movie can be jarring to untrained ears.  </P>
<P>I haven't wished for earplugs so much since years ago when I took my 
young son to a live performance of the Power Rangers.  The press notes 
include an article entitled "The Art of Noise," which quotes an 
ethnomusicology professor.  The professor says that he didn't like 
pansori the first-time he heard it but that most people like it once 
they get used to it.  That may be, but life is short, and I hope to 
avoid activities that assault my ears whether it be from the Power 
Rangers or pansori.  Then again, people's musical tastes vary.  To you, 
pansori may not be noise.  It may be, well, music to your ears.</P>
<P>The movie begins, ends and sometimes cuts back to documentary footage of 
a pansori concert by Cho Sang Hyun.  The singer, accompanied only by a 
drum, which his voice easily drowns out, is the film's narrator, and the 
movie is a dramatization of his long, narrative song.  The concert was 
four and a half hours long, but the film, thankfully, only runs two.  As 
they cut to the concert's audience, we see living proof that many 
Koreans are extremely moved by the music with reactions ranging from 
tears to dancing in the aisles.  </P>
<P>The very traditional story concerns a love affair that dares to cross 
class boundaries.  In the costume drama, Mongyong Lee (Seung-woo Cho), 
the governor's son, falls for Chunghyang Sung (Hyo-jeong Lee), the 
daughter of a courtesan.  There are no surprises in the script or the 
acting.  The same cannot be said of the production, which is sumptuous.  
The sets are impressive, the cinematography has a golden glow, and the 
costumes are intriguing.  My personal favorite was the tall black hat 
with the wide brim that many of the men wore.</P>
<P>Mark Twain once said that "Wagner's music is better than it sounds."  It 
may just be thus with pansori, but, for me, it's dominance of CHUNHYANG 
destroyed any hopes of my enjoying the film.  On the other hand, the 
minimal story and acting aren't particularly compelling on their own.</P>
<P>CHUNHYANG runs a very long 2:00.  The film is in Korean with English 
subtitles.  It is rated R for some sexuality and would be acceptable for 
teenagers.</P>
