<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>It's been a long while since Nicholas Roeg has done a film that suits his
ability.... that is, a film that is psychological, that is complicated, that
is hard to define, something that his work has not shown since the days of
PERFORMANCE, WALKABOUT, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, and to some extent
INSIGNIFICANCE.  This QUALITY adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novella stands
out as the directors finest piece in several years, and shows that he is
(still) quite a capable director.</P>
<P>HEART OF DARKNESS has been a well read story.  It also has been adapted in
many forms to the screen, the most famous of which is APPOCALYPSE NOW, by
Frank Ford Coppola.  But none of these adaptations, had ever been faithful
and close to the novella as this one has been.  The story is  in Africa
where the jungle was once considered a living hell, where the white man
could not survive the various diseases and the indigenous black people's.
As such, these jungle hells, were at one time considered the part of the
earth that associated with the horrors of man's mind, which had to be
conquered, and delivered from evil.  In the 60's, this kind of thought was
taken to Vietnam.  Today, it may be Bosnia, and  the former Yugoslav
republics.  Tomorrow it will be somewhere else, like South Africa.  But 100
years ago, Africa had it all.</P>
<P>And amidst the colonials that are out to make a fortune on ivory by killing
the elephant population, is a group that has mingled with the indigenous
cultures for various reasons.  Some for greed, some  because they got
stranded, and some for spiritual reasons. The story of the Commander Kurtz,
is one of a spiritual evolution, and one
that leaves behind its mark.  It is a dedicated attack on the mind of
everything that the industrial revolution has become.... a symbiotic evil,
where anything is killed in the name of progress, and greed. The English had
become the symbol of this type of people.  Their ruthlessness for adventure,
in the search for riches, took them to every corner on the face of the
earth.  And in every corner, there is a Kurtz, waiting to tell you his
story...... have we listened for the past 100 years...???? likely not... we
still rape, plunder, and plunge ahead, thinking our idealism is the law of
the land, and the mercy of the weak.  But the horrors will plague us as long
as this happens.... the horrors, repeats Kurtz, as he is dying.</P>
<P>The film has many of the bits and pieces which helped the story and defined
the Coppola film.  The fears which turn the characters into scared men, the
jungle diseases at the time, and of course, the enemy that stalks their
victims at every turn.  The enemy
always knows what is going on when we don't.  The enemy is powerful and we
are weak.  And Nicholas Roeg uses this, with close, tight angles of camera
work, to help define the novel even better... at every turn there is
something which can be seen,
but can not be defined.  And to those who are fearful, this can be a deadly
thing.  To those who have purpose and courage, this is a challenge for
life....... but as the novel tells us so well, a challenge of what....????</P>
<P>Outstanding set of performances, specially Tim Roth as Marlowe, the
adventurous captain, and John Malkovich as Kurtz.  The film was done in the
jungle'd places of Belize, and is nicely done.  It was originally done for
television, and later released on video. It is a very well done, and
faithful adaptation, of a master novelist, whose work still is of importance
today, still quite visible as the decaying industrial society still rapes
and plunders.</P>
