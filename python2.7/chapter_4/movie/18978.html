<P>Disney takes another animated shot at a legend with the infamous
jungle-man's big screen release featuring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie
Driver, Glenn Close and Rosie O'Donnell.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Small child is abandoned in a jungle after his parents are killed by a
tiger, and eventually brought up by a pack of gorillas. Once matured, some
humans visit the island and attempt to lure the ape-man back to their
civilization, and capture said gorillas.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Impeccably animated, this feature pulls you in with its incredible depiction
of a labyrinthian jungle tainted in emerald, majestic waterfalls and island
settings, a creatively scrawled Tarzan, and wonderful action sequences
featuring our main wild man frenetically swinging from vine to vine,
branch-surfing and roller-footing down limbs, and bellowing his way through
many a physical confrontation. The story, on the other hand, is one that we
are obviously all familiar with by now, and does little more to pull us in
further than any of its previous incarnations. All Disney animated films
generally take me over the top with a superior performance from either the
bad guy in the film (Jaffar from ALADDIN (7.5/10)) or the goofy sidekick
(Mushu from MULAN (7.5/10)). This film struck out on both counts, with a
less than compelling wicked character and no standout crony to speak of.</P>
<P>Having said that, I still found myself interested throughout most of this
picture because of its exquisite achievement in animation, with some
sequences eerily skimming the lines to reality, and other jumpin' jungle
shots suggesting three-dimensionality at their core. Pretty incredible up on
the big screen! If this was a live remake of the same story with the same
plot-line and characters, I probably would've dismissed it as hackneyed and
unimpressive in narration. But when you consider that it's a Mickey Mouse
Corp. feature starring many wondrous images and a familiar, yet oddly
original (in respect to its highly visual context), story, it has to be
appreciated on a much simpler playing field...that of a wide-eyed-child's
point of view. So I turn my head to its lack of overwhelming narrative and
the scary Phil Collins tunes, and applaud its ingenuity in animation,
musical numbers snub, fun action scenes and emotional effectiveness. Kids,
of course, will adore it!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Glenn Close was the person who dubbed Andie MacDowell's Jane voice in the
1984 version of Tarzan called GREYSTOKE.
In 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs first introduced the character of Tarzan to
the world. Since then, he has been featured in magazines, comic books, 26
authorized novels, radio and television programs, and more than 43 motion
pictures. Supposedly, Burroughs himself once toyed with the idea of an
animated version of his jungle hero, but nothing came of the project.</P>
