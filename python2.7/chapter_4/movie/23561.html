<P>   Contrary to the opinion of just about everyone in the 16-28
prime movie audience, people over 40 enjoy romance.  When
attachments are lacking, they may cover up their loneliness
to themselves and the outside world, but rest assured that
they need love in our lives like everyone else.  Among the
features that make "Bossa Nova" such a marvelous treat is
that the principal characters are over 40, the amorous
adventures of their youthful supporting actors communicating
erotic charges considerably less than those of the leading
personalities. Filmed by Bruno Barreto Rio, one of the world's
most charming cities, "Bossa Nova" recalls that director's
best known "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands," made in
1978 and starring the sultry Sonia Braga as a woman torn
between giving herself to her dead, irresponsible husband
who returns regularly to earth or to the bore who has become
her new spouse.</P>
<P>   Though not as rich in fantasy as "Dona Flor," "Bossa Nova"
departs occasionally from the roundelay of mistaken identities
and fluctuating love affairs to take flight, as when leading
man Antonio Fagundes in the role of Cariocan lawyer Pedro
Paulo imagines herself dancing Fred-Astaire style with the
woman who has caught him on the rebound, Mary Ann (Amy
Irving--who is the real-life wife of the director).</P>
<P>   Utilizing an adaptation of the novel "Miss Simpson" by
Sergio Sant'Anna by screenwriters Alexandre Machado and
Fernanda Young, director Barreto juggles a fine cast of actors
in the diverse roles of people of various ages and cultures
whose actions veer from the wacky to the tender, from
bewildered to centered, as courtships cross lines feverishly
under the hot sun of the Portuguese-speaking country.</P>
<P>   At the heart of the story is a widowed American, Mary Ann
(Amy Irving), a former air hostess whose pilot husband had
drowned two years previously.  Perhaps taking seriously the
adage that a woman over 40 has as much chance for
marriage as she has of winning the lottery, she has written
romance out of her life as she teaches English to a
boisterous lot of Rio's denizens in a well-appointed private
language school.  Her teaching brings her into contact with
Nadine (Drica Moraes), a computer buff who has been
enjoying a virtual romance with an American who calls
himself Gary (Stephen Tobolowski)--allegedly a loft-living
Soho artist with hair down to his waist.  On one fortuitous day
she shares an elevator with Pedro Paulo (Fagundes), who
becomes smitten with her and signs up for one of her classes
(though he already speaks English well).  Pedro Paulo is on
the rebound after his wife Tania (Debora Bloch) left him for a
Japanese tai-chi instructor (Kazuo Matsui), but Pedro Paulo
has competition from the brash soccer player, Acacio
(Alexandre Borges), who has just been bought out by a
British team.  </P>
<P>   When Acacio turns his attentions to Pedro Paulo's bright
but mercenary legal intern Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli),
Sharon must decide whether to shift her allegiance from the
sweet fellow who has been courting her, Roberto (Pedro
Cardoso), who is Pedro Paulo's half brother.</P>
<P>   It's small world after all.  As is typical in merry-go-
roundelays, a group of strangers ultimately find that somehow
they are all connected, and in the final scene, after some
comical incidents of mistaken identity, all players get the
mates whom they merit.  A hospital room makes the madcap
resolution a fitting conclusion to a romance that is more
mature, more complex, and with more real atmosphere than
the typical Hollywood production featuring bubbleheaded 20-
somethings.  Antonio Carlos Jobim's bossa nova soundtrack
adds zip to the proceedings while the entire package serves
as remarkable free advertising for the Government of Brazil
Department of Tourism.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2000
