<PRE>                                   STONED EXTREMES</PRE>
<P>When it comes to Oliver Stone movies, they can either run hot or cold but, at
least, you are riveted by the images, the sounds, and the persuasive
performances. Oliver Stone's newest film, "Any Given Sunday," an epic parable
about football, has lots of visual razzle-dazzle to spare, plenty of
bone-crushing sound effects, and some temporarily persuasive performances. It
is also a complete comedown from the director, a relentlessly torpid mishmash
of montages within montages that will make you want to take some Valium to
relieve the massive headache you will get.</P>
<P>Al Pacino stars as Tony D'Amato, a veteran football coach of the fictional
Miami Sharks, who drinks too much, hollers too much, screws around with
prostitutes, and is getting too old for the game. A spoiled, bratty rich girl,
Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), the late team owner's daughter, starts
telling Tony to "hold it together, you bull-headed moron!" She wants control of
the game, but in more economic terms. Tony also has a young star quarterback,
Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx), who is egoistic, has no team spirit, and is certain
that the game is his. He replaces the older, injured Jack "Cap" Rooney (Dennis
Quaid), who faces a wife (Lauren Holly) that demands he continue playing the
game for another couple of years. </P>
<P>In fact, there are many characters in "Any Given Sunday," but so few are given
more than a few minutes onscreen at a time. The cast is eclectic (James Woods,
Ann-Margret, Matthew Modine, Jim Brown, Elizabeth Berkley) but there are only
traces of them. That leaves us with Pacino, an excellent actor, who is given
shards of a character to play, but without any depth or dimension. Cameron Diaz
does as well as she can, but like everyone else, she sort of drifts in and out
of the frame barely making an impression. This is akin to watching football on
television, the cast resembles nothing more than stick figures in Stone's
arena. </P>
<P>The biggest problem lies with the editing. Stone has assembled footage in
extraordinary shifts of mood and excitement in films such as "J.F.K," "Natural
Born Killers," and "U-Turn," but here, it is the shift of one close-up shot
after another in rapid succession. This often feels like super MTV, shots and
whole sequences are so choppily edited that they leave a feeling of gradual
disorientation. The worst of it is during the actual football games. Instead of
showing us the mechanics and strategies of playing between the offense and
defense, we get close-ups of bodies flying through the air, lots of physical
poundings and flips, and twisting footballs, but no sense that any of this is
being played on the field. In other words, we never get a panoramic sense of
the field itself, and so everything is a blur, leaving us wondering as to what
exactly is happening on screen. To top it off, there are numerous montages
within montages, clouds speeding through the horizon, and the usual moonlight
shots, which Stone has shown us before. All this is draining to watch, and one
loses interest quickly. </P>
<P>It is also hard to judge the actors in the film since they are cut-and-pasted
in such randomness that Stone barely lets a take run longer than three seconds.
A theme is hidden somewhere in this mess about how football players have no
education and have nothing else to offer besides great games and reaping in
lots of profits. But all is lost in Stone's grandiose style that, for the first
time in his career, has no true rhyme or reason (celebrityism and lifestyles of
the players, not to mention physical abuses of their bodies, are given minimal
exposure). The overall effect is blurry, and casts a pale shadow of the once
great Oliver Stone. </P>
