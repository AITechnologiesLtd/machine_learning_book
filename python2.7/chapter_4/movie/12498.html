<PRE>                            WILD THINGS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                        1 :-)  for the wild life</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Denise
Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Carrie Snodgress, Jeff Perry, Robert
Wagner, Bill Murray
Director: John McNaughton
Screenplay: Stephen Peters</P>
<P>The sound of drums beat heavily in time with the throb of jungle life
thrashing in the Florida swamps. The lustful note of this movie opens to
the angry snap of alligator jaws, as wild things sound their mating
call. The scent of pheromones lingers in the tepid air of the humid
climate. However, the animals aren't caged or lurking in the nearby
jungle, instead, they exist in a civilised community of man made wealth
next door – Blue Bay Florida.</P>
<P>The elite in the Bay dine at exclusive clubs, fuck who they wish and buy
what they want. A philanthropic school counsellor, Guy Lombardo (Matt
Dillon) who has done too many rounds, gets accused of raping two
schoolgirls. One is a drug addict and school misfit (Neve Campbell); the
other is the daughter (Denise Richards) of a prominent Bay family. What
follows is a series of bizarre twist and turns, literally both in bed
and in death, which will keep you guessing till the end.</P>
<P>Some people may find the unpredictable style of this movie to their
liking. However, it can also be annoyingly and unbelievable, to reach
the end only to be rudely awakened by three successive changes of plot.
Which in ways is reminiscent of the SCREAM franchise, which relies
heavily on the ferocious unpredictability of the story line.</P>
<P>If you haven't seen Matt Dillon (IN AND OUT) in a while, be prepared to
see a lot of him in this movie. He gets to show how talented he is in
bed and how group therapy poses no problems in his acting department.
Neve Campbell (SCREAM), has fallen into a genre of shlock, shock and now
sex movies, and her role in this movie is merely wild and depraved.
Whilst Miss Goody-Two-Shoes, Denise Richards (STARSHIP TROOPERS), plays
out her school girl fantasies in the most adult sort of a way. Then
there is also Theresa Russell, who also gets her share of bedtime.</P>
<P>Lots of raunchy sex which may or may not be therapeutic.</P>
