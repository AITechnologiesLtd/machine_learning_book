<P>It's fairly easy to review a big-budget, studio released movie, 
especially when it's bad, and even more especially when it's 
irredeemably so.  After all, the kabillion dollars that's blown on Rilly 
Bad Flicks, just begs folks like me to come along and rip the movies' 
Powers That Be, a new one.  Such is not the case when I review an 
independent film for 3BC's "Spotlight On..." section.  If I think it's 
bad, I have the obligation to myself and my readers, to say so; but in 
doing so [she said, at risk of overestimating her value as a critic] I 
worry about alienating struggling indie artists, and that I might be 
contributing to the dearth of independent voices in the world of film - 
the very thing "Spotlight" was created to help remedy.  In many ways, 
it's a no-win situation for me, but I always try to go with my gut 
feeling.  And my gut doesn't feel too good right about now...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
In this unnecessarily convoluted tale, Army therapist Elaine Marshall 
(La Tamra Smith) is assigned to go to the Troyville military 
installation that serves as a prison for teen psychopaths, to do a 
profile of Naomi Richardson (Keana Jackson).  Naomi, accused of 
bludgeoning her father, mother, and prison roommate, is none too anxious 
to cooperate with Elaine.  It's par for Elaine's course, as she is also 
being sexually harassed by her superior officer, Colonel Brian Baxter 
(Don Wood) and not taken seriously by prison doctor Sanders (George 
Tovar) or the Warden (Audrey Morgan). </P>
<P>Though she starts out thinking of Naomi as an "animal" and a "freak 
show", Elaine's job is to get Naomi to trust her enough so Elaine can 
get at the root of Naomi's Issues with the world at large.  But what 
will Elaine find when she gets there? </P>
<P>The Upshot:
My sympathies for independent filmmakers aside, it was difficult for me 
to keep the sarcasm level to a minimum in writing the above movie 
synopsis.  If you knew the sheer number of punctuation marks and 
incredulous reactions I left out ("'...military installation that serves 
as a prison for teen psychopaths'???  Whathell?!?"), you'd understand; 
doubly so if you read the spiel on the tape's cover, which incorrectly 
calls Elaine a "Navy psychologist" (unless I read my uniforms wrong, 
she's clearly Army; and the Colonel is wearing an Airborne patch), and 
provided me an ironic chuckle ("As the body count mysteriously rises, 
genders bend without reason".  Oh yeah, "without reason" sums a great 
deal of this movie up nicely).</P>
<P>The story as presented made little logical sense, most likely because it 
tried to do too much in too little time, with actors only too eager to 
play it too broad.  Filled with plotholes wide enough to drive a 
semi-truck through, I found myself laughing hysterically in all the 
wrong places--which brought FINAL DESTINATION, itself a comedy 
masquerading as a thriller, immediately to mind.  Unfortunately for this 
film, it suffers even from *that* comparison.  My enjoyment of "Naomi" 
didn't reach the level of my guilty-pleasure fondness for "Destination", 
save for one aspect: Keana Jackson could act circles around any of the 
"Destination" teens.  Indeed, Jackson's actions kept this film from 
being a total disaster.  </P>
<P>A natural in a sea of overactors, Jackson rarely brought me out of the 
moment when watching her.  Even when presented with the most far-fetched 
of plot points (suffice it to say, I spent a lot of time screaming "Give 
me a break!" and "No way would that happen!" at the screen), I could 
almost take her Naomi at face value without too many questions.  If Ms. 
Jackson decided to tackle mainstream Hollywood (or for that fact, 
continue on in indies), she could do extremely well; she has the stuff 
to be a major star, given the opportunity.</P>
<P>Would that I could say the same for the rest of the cast, or for the 
situations written for them.  If I were cleaning house on this movie, 
I'd lop off the Colonel, along with the entire notion of a military 
installation that serves as a prison for teen psychopaths, first and 
foremost; it's beyond me why that disaster-waiting-to-happen was even 
included in the movie.  Besides, with that subplot gone, Wood's 
reminiscent-of-porno acting (hmmm...) would go right along with it.  And 
since I'm in a house-cleaning mood, I'd also excise all instances of 
Smith's "go girl" strident cadence, all too evident in her earlier 
scenes; it did not suit her character well, and was a major distraction 
every time she took that voice out of her bag.  "Go Girl" Elaine worked 
my last nerve, whereas the more professional--and paradoxically, 
softer--Elaine complimented the Naomi character quite well.  As for the 
silent [but unfortunately, not unheard-from] prison guard (Michael 
Raines), the wish-she-had-remained silent Warden (Audrey Morgan), and 
the why-the-heck-was-she-kept silent Judge (Diane Travis), the less 
said, the better.</P>
<P>To be fair, "Naomi" got better as it progressed; or to be more precise, 
Smith's acting and Elaine and Naomi's storyline, gradually worked 
better, albeit in fits and starts.  Resembling a soap opera moreso than 
a thriller, by the time "Naomi" came to its climax, I couldn't be mad at 
it for much (except the irritating repetition of the line "Oh what a 
tangled web we weave".  I got it, ok?), especially since I had almost as 
good a time laughing at it as I wish I could've had being thrilled by 
it.  </P>
<P>In the end, I found myself wishing for what could have been: a 
powerfully dramatic thriller told from a unique point of view.  My 
advice to co-writers Don Abernathy and Keana Jackson?  Take away the 
flotsam (why complicate matters by throwing in the military?  What was 
*that* about?), the jetsam (most of the supporting cast; Jackson and a 
neck-twistless Smith could easily have held the story together on their 
own), add more meat to the main story, and NAOMI'S WEB could really take 
off.  At base, it does have a story worth exploring, even in short-story 
form; it's just covered up with too much nonsense as-is.</P>
<P>But hey, I'm not picky: I could've dug it just as well as an intentional 
comedy.  It was already halfway there.     </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
You have to give Abernathy points for the sincere effort, and most def 
give Jackson praise for rising above the material--even though as 
co-writer, parts of that material were her own doing.  Taken in the same 
vein of its cousin-in-zealousness - the equally (and unintentionally) 
humorous FINAL DESTINATION - "Naomi" would be best viewed as a parody of 
the genre.  I can get with it as a soap; but it just does not cut it 
(uh, no pun intended) as a serious thriller.</P>
<P>NAOMI'S WEB (rating: yellowlight): 
More time devoted to the plot that needed it, less time to the subplots 
that didn't, and perhaps this web would not be so unnecessarily tangled.</P>
