<PRE>                        FAIRYTALE: A TRUE STORY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This fanciful retelling of a historic
          incident is too slow and dour and offers too little
          for the eye of a younger child and it is a bit
          patronizing for adults.  Still, its study of why
          people believe what they do will play better on an
          adult audience than a children's matinee.  Two
          school-girls create a sensation by apparently
          photographing fairies in their garden.  The film
          does a nice job of creating little people with
          dragonfly wings to come down on the side of
          claiming that the fairies were real.  Rating: +1
          (-4 to +4), 6 (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     When Richard Adams wrote WATERSHIP DOWN it was not really clear
who his audience would be.  The story seemed too violent for children
and a tale of rabbits looking for a safe warren seemed a little puerile
for adults.  It was a difficult task for Adams to get it published, but
once it was it remained a bestseller for years.  That book
notwithstanding, it is a good idea to know when you are telling a story
whom you expect to be your audience.  FAIRYTALE: A TRUE STORY is a film
that was made without too much thought as to who its audience would be.
As a result it is too slow and deliberate to be a children's film and
it is a bit too logically inconsistent to work well for adults.  The
story tells of how two young girls during World War I produced what
they claimed to be authentic photographs of fairies in an English
country garden.  At the time, the story caused quite a sensation.
Notables including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini
investigated the claims and Doyle became convinced.  FAIRYTALE: A TRUE
STORY is a fictionalized account of what happened told from the point
of view that the fairies were real.  To claim this to be a true story
and to have special effects fairies flitting around seems less than
strictly honest, though I suppose the filmmakers are taking the
viewpoint of believers.</P>
<P>     It is a miserable time in 1917 England, with men returning from
the war having been shot to pieces in battle. Nine-year old South
African Frances Griffiths (played by Elizabeth Earl) lost her father in
the war and comes to England to stay with her twelve-year old cousin
Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath).  [Historical note: the actual children's
ages were ten and sixteen respectively according to one source.
However, the "true" story plays better if they are younger.]  Elsie is
also mourning a recent loss, that of her older brother.  The two girls,
shown here as almost being too storybook perfect, build a bond of
friendship.  Then one day when playing in the garden, Frances sees a
fairy.  The fairies will not let themselves be seen by adults, but
Frances and Elsie determine to prove the presence of the fairies by
borrowing Elsie's father's camera and taking a picture.  That is just
what they do and resulting photographs cause a sensation.  Peter
O'Toole plays Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the hard-nosed
skeptic Sherlock Holmes, who nevertheless is ready to accept the
photographs as real.  He calls in master illusionist and debunker Harry
Houdini (played very nicely by Harvey Keitel).</P>
<P>     If one looks for it there is some material that is worth
considering in the film.  The story offers us a variety of people in
varying degrees of belief or skepticism and we can see their
motivations for their degree of belief.  Generally it is the people who
have been most injured by reality who are willing to turn from that
reality and embrace the fanciful.  Faith also works better on children
than adults in the film.  And the film seems very accepting of
skepticism.  The most sympathetic adult character is Keitel's Harry
Houdini. O'Toole, on the other hand, is not well-cast as Doyle.
Physically he is wrong to play the short and plumpish writer.  His
character seems too anxious to convince others to believe in the
supernatural, at one point even saying to be skeptical is to show
disrespect to him.</P>
<P>     But where the film is unsettling is in the question of whether the
photographs are genuine or not.  Certainly the film shows you fairies,
so it really says that they are real.  But the photos are the historic
originals or very good facsimiles and while we do not get much chance
to look at them on the wide screen, the originals clearly are fakes.
(Sorry, Sir Arthur.)  It does not take much examination of the original
photographs to conclude that the fairies shown are drawn by hand rather
than photographed from life.  The film suggests that may be the case
also, but never ties that end up.  Of course, there are many ends not
tied up in this film and left for the viewer to decide.  The level of
storytelling is confusing and will be more so for children. The telling
of the story is a little muddled and not helped by thick accents
occasionally obscuring the dialog. Often parallel action is inter-cut
and one time they add a chess game that seems to have nothing to do
with the rest of the story, but they inter-cut it with two pieces of
inter-cut action to create a third one.</P>
<P>     Some script problems and editing problems damage this well-
photographed and acted story of the Cottingly Fairies.  It could have
been a lot better and rates a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
