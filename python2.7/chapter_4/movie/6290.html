<P>     SLING BLADE, the directorial debut of actor/writer Billy Bob 
Thornton (who scripted ONE FALSE MOVE and A FAMILY THING), is a 
fascinating examination of a damaged man's quest to make restitution for 
his past crimes.  To a lesser extent, it also offers an atypical vision 
of the concept of "family" in modern society.  Thornton has developed 
SLING BLADE as a slowly-paced character study.  Nearly every scene is 
designed to reveal something about one of characters rather than advance 
the minimalist story.  The narrative is little more than a flimsy 
envelope -- it's the men and women who are sealed within that make SLING 
BLADE worth watching.  </P>
<P>     The best acting in the entire motion picture is by Thornton 
himself.  He plays Karl Childers, a "mentally challenged" man who has 
been incarcerated in the Arkansas State Hospital for the criminally 
insane since the age of nine, when he butchered his mother and her lover 
with a sling blade.  As the film opens, Karl is being released from the 
hospital.  According to the doctors, he has been cured.  By Karl's own 
admission, he doesn't reckon he's got a reason to kill anyone else.  But 
we in the audience aren't so sure.  His rough, gravely voice is 
intimidating, and his nervous mannerisms -- constantly rubbing his hands 
together, uttering "uh-huh"s every few words, and never meeting anyone 
else's gaze -- do not inspire confidence.  Is he still dangerous, or 
just the "gentle, simple man" others see him to be?</P>
<P>     It's not an easy question, and SLING BLADE doesn't insult us with 
an easy answer.  Despite his low IQ, Karl is every bit as complex as any 
other human being -- if not moreso.  There's a little bit of FORREST 
GUMP in him.  His mental simplicity makes him strangely compelling and 
likable, regardless of his bloody history and uncertain future.  </P>
<P>     Once Karl is out of the hospital, he goes to work as a mechanic in 
the small town where he was born (and where he committed his crime).  He 
befriends a fatherless young boy, Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black), and, 
after meeting Frank's mother, Linda (Natalie Canderday), is invited to 
live in their garage.  Frank is glad to have Karl around, not just 
because he yearns for a father-figure, but because he's afraid of 
Linda's often-drunk, abusive boyfriend, Doyle (Dwight Yoakam), and 
believes that Karl's presence will keep Doyle in line.  Meanwhile, 
Linda's friend and boss, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), is concerned 
about a stranger living with Frank and Linda, and decides to keep an eye 
on the newcomer.</P>
<P>     It could be argued that the ending is predictable, but I think 
"inevitable" is a better word.  The audience sees the resolution long 
before any of SLING BLADE's characters do, but that's because we're more 
removed from the situation than they are.  The film builds to a 
perfectly-fitting, climactic moment.  The key scene is not overplayed, 
nor are the ramifications.</P>
<P>     When we first meet Karl in SLING BLADE's prologue, he is a strange, 
sinister figure recounting his history to a local high school newspaper 
reporter.  As we get to know him, however, we come to understand the 
depth of his personality, and the manner in which personal tragedies 
have formed his character.  By bonding with Frank, Karl sees a path to 
redemption, a way to salve the wounds inflicted by his two long-ago 
misdeeds (the double murder and an equally horrifying crime that he was 
an accomplice to).  In the process, he illustrates how much more there 
is to being a father than supplying sperm and applying a "firm hand".  
Karl seeks to save Frank the way his own father was unable to save him.</P>
<P>     While Thornton's performance is obviously the standout, there are a 
number of noteworthy turns by supporting actors.  Lucas Black and 
Natalie Canderday are both believable, and John Ritter is surprisingly 
effective playing against type as an effeminate homosexual.  Dwight 
Yoakam goes a little over-the-top as the despicable Doyle, but that's 
the nature of the character.  SLING BLADE also features cameos by some 
impressive names:  Robert Duvall (Karl's father), J.T. Walsh (a fellow 
inmate at the hospital), and Jim Jarmusch (an ice cream salesman).</P>
<P>     SLING BLADE runs for a little longer than it needs to, and there 
are a few scenes that border on being too cute (such as one where Karl's 
"date" from the previous evening gives him flowers), but, in general, 
it's a fine motion picture.  Karl is sufficiently interesting to hold 
our attention for more than two hours, and, if the resolution of his 
dilemma is obvious, watching him arrive at it makes SLING BLADE 
worthwhile.  Billy Bob Thornton has done some interesting things with 
this film; his next project should be worth the wait.</P>
