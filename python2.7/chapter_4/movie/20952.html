<PRE>A Very Good Wild Man
Tarzan</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Tarzan" swings onto the screen with the power and grace of a charging
cheetah. The story of a lost infant in an African jungle is told richly with
music (Phil Collins) and colorful images. Kala, a female gorilla finds the
human baby and saves him from Sabor, the leopard. "I shall call him Tarzan"
she tells her un-approving dominant male, Kerchak. Terk, a young ape
retorts, "Tarzan? Okay, it's you're baby."</P>
<P>Tarzan and Terk become best friends as they grow into their teens.</P>
<P>You know the rest, British anthropologists, Professor Porter and daughter
Jane, come to observe while their bodyguard, Clayton, upsets the jungle
paradise.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, this is an action film! In one amazing scene, Tarzan rescues
Jane from an aerial stampede of perturbed baboons. Tarzan not only swings
with the greatest of ease, but literally "surfs" the mossy tree trunks that
wind like waves high above the jungle. This may just be the fastest paced
animated sequence ever produced -- easily rivaling the "Star Wars" pod race
in the exciting speed department.</P>
<P>Perhaps its only imperfection, the film puckers out a bit short of the home
stretch. But that lull won't stop me from heartily recommending this wild
action comedy to kids and adults of all ages. Go see it!</P>
<PRE>Voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell, and
Lance Henriksen.
Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck.
Screenplay by Tab Murphy.
Produced by Bonnie Arnold at Walt Disney.
Rated G.</PRE>
