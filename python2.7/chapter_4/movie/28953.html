<PRE>GHOST WORLD
-----------</PRE>
<P>Enid (Thora Birch, "American Beauty") and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson, "The
Horse Whisperer") are best friends and determined outsiders graduating from
High School.  While Rebecca's set on getting a job and finding an apartment
that she and Enid can share, Enid's having trouble finding a direction and
becomes fascinated by an older, nerdy record collector, Seymour (Steve
Buscemi).  Daniel Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff ("Crumb") adapt Clowe's
graphic novel, "Ghost World."</P>
<P>In the film adaptation, Enid's clearly the more caustic, artistic one
('That's really gonna happen,' she states to an over eager classmate who
suggest they get together during the summer), while quieter Becky is more
focused.  Ironically, Enid must make up art class during summer school in
order to complete her diploma, where she drolly endures the antics of
clueless teacher Roberta (Illeana Douglas, "Stir of Echoes").  She barely
puts up with her meek, single dad (Bob Balaban, "Best in Show") and is
horrified when he begins to see old flame Maxine (an almost mummified looking
Teri Garr), whom she really loathes.  </P>
<P>For entertainment, Enid and Rebecca lure a lonely-hearts loser out on a 
bogus date.  When they run into the man again at a yard sale, Enid, to Becky's 
complete mystification, is intrigued and begins an odd relationship with 
Seymour.  At this point Becky pretty much falls out of the picture.</P>
<P>What makes "Ghost World" worthwhile are the terrific performances from 
Thora Birch as the ultimate counter culture wiseass and Steve Buscemi, who
finds exactly the right note for a difficult character.  Seymour's pathetic,
but acknowledges it (he refers to himself as a cranky eccentric specimen).
Enid's fascinated because Seymour knows who he is and has housed himself 
in his own weird world of old 78s and vintage artifacts.  Birch, sporting
an overripe body and cats eye glasses, puts up a hip front to hide the fear
of growing up and eventually drags Seymour into her confused state of being.</P>
<P>Clowes and Zwigoff throw in plenty of amusing sidelines, too. Enid and Rebecca 
share a crush on Josh (Brad Renfro, "Apt Pupil") and constantly torture him
at the convenience store where he works and where the Greek owner is in a
constant battle with a hilarious mullet-head.  Enid's art
teacher Roberta is hilariously out of touch, preferring a jumble of coat
hangers with a pandering description to Enid's own Crumb-like artwork.  Enid's
stab at a job selling concessions at a movie theater is an amusing example
of knowing self defeatism.</P>
<P>But Zwigoff allows the central story to drift away, arriving at an
unsatisfying conclusion for both Enid and Seymour.  Becky steps over the line
into grownup land by becoming concerned with material household goods, her
rebellious move of skipping college landing her in a job at a coffee shop.</P>
<P>Production Design by Edward T. McAvoy, Art Direction by Alan E. Muraoka,
Set Decoration by Lisa Fischer and Costume Design by Mary Zophres provide
the film with a desolate, retro look in well chosen L.A. locations.  The
film's final scene is reminiscent of Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks."</P>
<P>"Ghost World's" ectoplasmic protagonists are haunting, but it's ethereal
conclusions leave us wanting.</P>
