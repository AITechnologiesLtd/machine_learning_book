                                 THE CEMENT GARDEN 
                        A Film Review by James Berardinelli 
                         Copyright 1994 James Berardinelli </PRE>

Screenplay:  Andrew Birkin based on the novel by Ian McEwan

Released by October Films </P>
<P>     Considering the rancid, nightmarish quality of his books, it's somewhat 
amazing that a writer like British author Ian McEwan could have three of 
his works filmed by now.  In addition to THE CEMENT GARDEN, THE COMFORT 
OF STRANGERS has been made into a movie (by Paul Schrader in 1991), and 
THE INNOCENT (directed by John Schlesinger) is due to be released.  The 
most controversial of these, however, is THE CEMENT GARDEN, principally 
because of its subject matter:  teenage incest.   </P>
<P>     Don't expect this film to spare the audience.  Those unaware of what 
they're going to see may be violently disturbed by what appears on the 
screen.  There is no moral to this tale, and morality is shown to be 
relative.  In other words, "good" does not necessarily triumph over 
"evil", and no fire explodes from the heavens to sear the sinners.   </P>
<P>     An entire family is together at the outset of the film, but not for 
long. After the father collapses and dies of a heart attack, the mother  
(Sinead Cusack) becomes confined to bed, stricken by a mysterious and 
debilitating illness.  This leaves the eldest sister and brother, Julie 
(Charlotte Gainsbourg) and Jack (Andrew Robertson), to care for their 
younger siblings, Sue (Alice Coultard) and Tom (Ned Birkin).  These four 
are not what most people would define as "normal."  Julie and Jack are 
drawn to each other by a forbidden sexual attraction that neither can 
deny, despite the obvious taboo.  Sue is withdrawn and given to writing 
in her diary, and Tom wants to be a girl. </P>
<P>     The incest issue is dealt with in a straightforward and non-prurient 
fashion.  Director Andrew Birkin is not attempting to shock his audience, 
but rather to candidly represent the factors that lead to this 
relationship.  His style is sensitive, not exploitative, which makes all 
the difference to the success of THE CEMENT GARDEN.  The film works 
because the characters are alive. </P>
<P>     As dark as the subject matter is (and I haven't even discussed the 
meaning of the title), Birkin still culls laughs from his audience.  This 
isn't the nervous tittering of uncomfortable viewers, but a genuine 
reaction to amusing moments.  Much of the humor is relatively harmless, 
although a few of the jokes (especially the double entendres) are off-
color. </P>
<P>     The relationship between Jack and Julie holds the film together.  This 
is a mutual seduction, and both play their parts.  Julie is the one with all 
the responsibility in the household, but she won't let her boyfriend 
touch her because he's not the one she wants.  Jack, on the other hand, 
gets away with doing as little as he can, preferring to spend his time 
masturbating in secret places or admiring himself in a mirror.  Julie is 
a more likeable character than her brother, but only because it's 
difficult to love a narcissist. </P>
<P>     Andrew Robertson and Charlotte Gainsbourg have difficult roles to 
play - their characters require a nakedness that goes beyond the physical 
to an emotional level.  The success of the actors becomes a key element 
in the film's overall triumph.  Julie and Jack work as individuals and   
together.</P>
<P>     THE CEMENT GARDEN makes no apologies - not to its characters or to 
the audience.  The quality of fascination is as much a credit to those 
producing the film as to the unorthodox - and grim - central theme.  THE 
CEMENT GARDEN is occasionally grotesque, frequently disturbing, and at 
times surprisingly humorous.  No matter what else it may be, however, 
this movie is always thought-provoking, and it's hard to imagine anyone 
leaving without the strongest of opinions. </P>
