<PRE>The Man In The Iron Mask</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1998 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: Randall Wallace movie
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, Gérard
Depardieu, John Malkovich, Anne Parillaud, Judith Godrèche and others</P>
<P>Most of us are familiar with the story of the Three Musketeers, or
rather four. The story of the Man In The Iron Mask, also written by
Alexandre Dumas, takes place 25 years later - our musketeers got
older and each of them is in a different business now. King of France
is no longer Louis XIII but Louis XIV, the man who built Versailles.
But in our story Louis is a spoiled brat, an arrogant adolescent who
only cares about his own pleasure while the people are starving in
the streets of Paris.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), Athos (John Malkovich), Porthos (Gérard
Depardieu) and Aramis (Jeremy Irons) all have their own good reasons
to want to get rid of the king. A carefully guarded secret works to
their advantage: Louis XIV has a twin brother who was taken away
right after he was born so as not to endanger the succession. He does
not know about his true identity and has been kept in a dungeon for
the last six years. An iron mask covers his face so no-one will
notice how much he looks like the king. The four musketeers conspire
to exchange Philippe for Louis to free the people of France from
their despotic monarch.</P>
<P>Even if THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK has nothing new to offer this remake
is worth watching, especially because of its top notch cast. The
"elderly gentlemen" seemed to have fun as musketeers. The women's job
in this movie is to look pretty, but that's just the nature of the
story.</P>
<P>Leonardo DiCaprio may be a surprising but nevertheless good choice
for the part of Louis XIV. He masters two very different parts. His
arrogant Louis reminds me of Jaye Davidson as Ra in Roland Emmerich's
STARGATE, but maybe that was just the similar hairdo.
One thing's for sure: There can only be one. It's either Louis or
Philippe, one of them must disappear.</P>
<P>The strangest character in the movie is Gérard Depardieu as Porthos,
although if you know the book you can hardly think of a better actor
for the part. The aging Porthos lost his peace of mind, thinks about
suicide and gets on his friends' nerves. They don't take him
seriously, but still they make a saw-cut in a beam in the barn to
prevent him from killing himself. Why Porthos has to be naked when he
tries to hang himself remains a mystery. Maybe because Depardieu
likes to drop his clothes. That doesn't mean that we all would like
to see him that way. After seeing him climb out of a bathtub in
GERMINAL I decided that I like cave bears better at the museum, but
once more I was given this very special treat. So what.</P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK isn't very original, but makes for two hours
of pleasant entertainment if you enjoy pretty costumes and don't
expect too much.</P>
