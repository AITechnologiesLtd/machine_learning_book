<PRE>                          HERBERT'S HIPPOPOTAMUS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     HERBERT'S HIPPOPOTAMUS is not kid's show, no matter how silly the
title sounds.  (The derivation of the title is less interesting than
you might suspect.)  The film is a serious documentary that examines
radical Professor Herbert Marcuse's fight against the University of
California system.  I saw the film as part of San Jose's Cinequest film
festival.</P>
<P>     The documentary is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s with
videos of several different University of California campuses, but with
most of the film set in San Diego where Professor Marcuse taught.
(Since I was a grad student at Berkeley at the time, I must admit my
eye was actively scanning the crowds there looking for my own image.
I do not believe I appear in the film, but then again, perhaps one of
those pixels is me.)</P>
<P>     You may remember Marcuse.  He was Angela Davis's friend and
mentor.  He was also a target of hatred at the time with his opponents
accusing him of being a Communist.  For the record, Davis did join the
Communist party, but Marcuse never did.  The documentary film footage
of him shows him as an assertive, but reasonable sage.  There is a long
sequence of a reporter trying to get Marcuse to say that he endorsed
violence.  He was a skillful verbal fencer and never did let the
reporter put words in his mouth.</P>
<P>     Documentarian Paul Alexander Juutilainen is effective at pulling
out old clips to make his points.  Reagan is shown as a buffoon, and
the filmmaker has interviews of people denigrating Reagan and the then
UCSD Chancellor McGill.  They accuse them of everything including being
ugly.</P>
<P>     The documentary is one-sided, which is fine -- most are, but
I wish it were better constructed.  The clips are categorized into
chapters, and yet they seem randomly organized.  I know that the
documentarian wanted me to empathize with Marcuse and rage against the
system as embodied in then Governor Reagan, but I could have gotten
that by reading the abstract.</P>
<P>     There are two things I will remember.  First, the people in the
small audience after the film seemed to share a single opinion.  As one
guy said, anyone who has read Marcuse and understood him, must agree
with him.  He claimed that those who do not agree with Marcuse must not
understand him.  This is a simplistic view that I don't buy.</P>
<P>     Second, there is a scene in which an army recruiter has been
invited to speak to the UCSD students, and the students take a vote on
whether to allow him to talk.  The First Amendment wins the vote by a
ten to one margin.  So what do the students who lost the vote and want
to deny this man his Constitutional rights then yell to drown him out?
"Fascist!"  I find this to be ironic.</P>
<P>     HERBERT'S HIPPOPOTAMUS runs 1:09.  It is not rated, but would be
PG for the themes discussed.  It would be fine for any kid old enough
to be interested.  Although it is a close call, the film is not
cohesive enough for me to be able to recommend it.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
