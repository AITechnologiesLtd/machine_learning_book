<P>     With FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Roger Moore's fifth appearance as Bond and 
the twelfth entry in the long-running series, 007 enters the 1980s with 
a return to the "glory days" of the '60s.  Realizing it would be tough 
to top the technical glitz of MOONRAKER, the film makers wisely chose 
not to try, opting instead for a retro-Bond adventure that takes the 
intrepid superspy back into familiar territory:  KGB involvement in a 
plan that centers on classified British secrets.</P>
<P>     But that's not the only aspect of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY that looks 
more to Bond's past than his future.  Blofeld, the constant nemesis 
during the Connery years, makes a brief return appearance, and the film 
opens with 007 visiting the grave of his dead wife, Tracy.  Regarding 
familiar faces, M isn't in this movie (Bernard Lee having died just 
prior to the start of filming), but Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and Moneypenny 
(Lois Maxwell) are.  Also, KGB general Gogel (Walter Gotell), who first 
came on board during THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, has a small part.  (Gogel was 
in every film from SPY through THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.)</P>
<P>     Bond's mission this time, "for [his] eyes only", is to locate and, 
if possible, recover Great Britain's ATAC equipment -- a ship-based 
weapons system that allows the user to take control of the country's 
nuclear submarines, ordering them to attack any target.  ATAC was on 
board a freighter that sank in the Ionian Sea, and Bond has at least one 
major rival, a sly villain named Kristatos (Julian Glover), who's after 
it as well.  Joining 007 on his quest is Melina (French actress Carole 
Bouquet), the daughter of a scientist killed by Kristatos, who has vowed 
revenge against her father's murderers.  Also along for the ride is the 
good-natured smuggler Columbo (Topol), who Kristatos set up as a fall 
guy.</P>
<P>     Locations in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY vary across Europe.  On a per-
minute basis, there are more stunts and chases in this film than in any 
previous 007 adventure, and some are quite spectacular.  There's a car 
chase, a shoot-and-dodge race down icy slopes and through a bobsled run, 
a tense mountain-scaling sequence, and nearly as much underwater action 
as in THUNDERBALL.  FOR YOUR EYES ONLY has its share of breathtaking 
moments.  As for the music -- suffice it to say that John Barry is 
missed.</P>
<P>     Alas, Julian Glover's Kristatos won't be remembered as one of the 
great 007 bad guys.  While the actor's ability is beyond question, it's 
usually not talent that makes for a memorable Bond villain, and Glover 
just isn't over-the-top or nasty enough.  (One wonders if the film 
makers might have done better keeping Blofeld around for more than the 
pre-credits sequence.)  Locque (Michael Gothard), Kristatos' henchman, 
is as dull as his master -- he looks evil, but in the wake of Jaws, 
comes across as rather pathetic.  </P>
<P>     Like Diana Rigg in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, Carole Bouquet 
is one of the few Bond girls who can actually act (although she doesn't 
get much chance to show it).  Lynn-Holly Johnson plays a young skater 
who's infatuated with 007, but this particular subplot, played for 
comedy, never works, and is occasionally painful to endure.  
Fortunately, it doesn't eat up much screen time.  </P>
<P>     In the final analysis, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is a solid adventure, 
although it could have been better.  There's enough action to hold those 
with even a short attention span, and Roger Moore's deft charm hasn't 
yet begun to wear thin (that starts with the next film, OCTOPUSSY).  By 
the end of the '80s, Bond would be viewed as something of a relic, but 
at least the decade opened with an enjoyable outing.</P>
