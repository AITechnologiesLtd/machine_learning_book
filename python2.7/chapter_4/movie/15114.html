<P>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 69</PRE>
<P>"Baby Jane" is a wicked comedy and thriller
starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.  It
is a good film, full of suspense and humor.
It is probably the most important film that
either star made after 1960, as its success
led to a series of older actresses in macabre
roles.</P>
<P>The story begins in 1917.  Baby Jane (Julie Allred)
is a child star and spoiled brat, pampered
by her smarmy show-biz dad (Dave Willock) while
older sister Blanche (Gina Gillespie) is ignored.
By the mid-1930s, the tables have turned.
Blanche is a moviestar, while the alcoholic
Jane is shunned by the studios.</P>
<P>Blanche's career is ruined when she becomes
paralyzed in an auto accident that Jane is
blamed for.  But Blanche (Crawford) and Jane
(Davis) continue to live together in the now
decaying mansion of their youth.  Blanche arranges
to sell the mansion, and to place the unstable
Jane in an institution.  Jane's response is to
isolate and terrorize Blanche.  Meanwhile, Jane
seeks a pathetic revival of her career with
impoverished pianist Edwin (Victor Buono).</P>
<P>The best part of "Baby Jane" are the opening scenes,
when Jane is a child.  Her wretched, maudlin singing
voice is a perfect send-up of manipulated (and
manipulative) child stars.  Perhaps someday there
will be a prequel to "Baby Jane", further exploring
this character.</P>
<P>Bette Davis looks awful.  Although only 54 at the
time, her pasty white makeup makes her appear grotesque
and much older.  Crawford, as the gentle victim of
Davis' bizzare cruelty, suffers many indignities.
Gossip about "Baby Jane" centers on the two star's
dislike of each other.  Supposedly, for the scene
where Davis drags Crawford, Joan hid weights under
her dress, helping to injure Davis' back.  Campy and
malevolent, Davis was perfectly cast for the role of Jane;
the baddest of all the 'bad girl' roles of her career.</P>
<P>Buono, a memorable character actor, makes his film
debut in "Baby Jane".  He earned an Oscar nomination
for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.
Davis was nominated for Best Actress, and Ernest
Haller was nominated for the cinematography.</P>
