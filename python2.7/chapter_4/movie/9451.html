<PRE>                         THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A never-losing Florida lawyer (played
          by Keanu Reeves) is brought to New York to be the
          hired gun for the most prestigious law firm in New
          York.  There his mentor (Al Pacino) turns out to be
          the quintessence of evil.  As the new job takes its
          toll on his marriage and his very soul, the young
          lawyer begins to suspect that there is more to the
          job than meets the eye.  This is glossy,
          beautifully staged horror film with an intricate
          plot that pays homage to several classic horror
          films.  This one will not stretch your mind, but
          there is a lot to see.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4), 7 (0
          to 10).  (Anyone who has seen a trailer for this
          film or seen another review probably knows what
          this film is really about.  However, the film
          itself does not confirm it until late in the story,
          so I will carefully not spoil the premise in this
          review.)
          New York Critics: 6 positive, 7 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Kevin Lomax is one terrific lawyer.  He has an uncanny way of
sizing up prospective jury members and knowing who will be sympathetic.
Sixty-four cases in Florida and he has not lost a case.  It does not
matter if the defendant is guilty or innocent, good guy or scumbag--if
Kevin prosecutes the defendant is found guilty; if he defends, the
verdict is innocent.  People start to notice.  Someone who has noticed
is John Milton, the head of a prestigious and extremely powerful New
York law firm.  Milton is a slick and charismatic lawyer.  He is in bed
figuratively with the rich and powerful.  He is in bed literally with
sleek and the sexy.  And his gifts to those he likes are nearly
everything that are really worth having.  Impressed with Lomax and his
wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), Milton is anxious to bring Kevin into
the firm, to use his genius, to pay him in money, with a palatial
apartment, to see Kevin's every sexual fantasy fulfilled. Mary Ann is
at first overjoyed at the success her husband is having and is willing
to give up some of his time and his intimacy for the success that is
everything she could not get back in Gainesville.  But a bit at a time
she discovers that her husband is making too many sacrifices of what
she shared with him and giving it to the firm.  Kevin never worried
about being a scrupulous lawyer in the past, but this job is taking too
much of a toll on his soul.  As he gets pulled deeper and deeper into
defending the guilty, Mary Ann is slowly disintegrating and Kevin is
powerless to stop it.  THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is a good old- fashioned,
well-plotted horror film in the style of the horror films of the 60s
and 70s.  No geysers of blood or crazed stalkers.  The first half hour
could be from a John Grisham novel.  Then weird things start happening.
The law firm seems to have its hands in evil, not just figuratively,
but also literally.</P>
<P>     In the past I have not been fond of Keanu Reeves's acting which I
generally find wooden.  Here perhaps that quality works to his
advantage, both to contrast to Al Pacino and to present the feeling
that there is something mysterious going on in his mind that we cannot
quite fathom.  And if there is not quite enough going on the screen
with Reeves's performance, there is more than enough supplied by
Pacino.  Pacino is far more expressive in part because his character
can afford to be.  He gives a high-energy performance that would steal
a scene from a puppy.  There are, however, two scenes in the film when
he turns the performance up too high and he goes into overload mode.
One is a pivotal scene involving the character played by Jeffrey Jones;
the other time is an extended scene very near the end of the film.
Both times his performance gets to be just a bit overripe.  Charlize
Theron is rather nice as the incredible dissolving wife. Also nice to
see is an uncredited part by the always watchable Delroy Lindo.  The
acting is all brought together by Taylor Hackford, who previously did
the under-rated THE IDOLMAKER, as well as AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN
and DOLORES CLAIBORNE.  The set design by Roberta J. Holinko is very
nice with some really memorable artwork.  Other effects by Rick Baker
are perhaps not up to some of his finest, but are still very worth
seeing.</P>
<P>     This may not be the most intelligent film of the autumn season,
but it stands among the best horror films we have seen on the screen in
the last few years.  I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
