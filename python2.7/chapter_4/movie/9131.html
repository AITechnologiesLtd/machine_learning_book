   In one scene of this film, Giles De'Ath (John Hurt)
announces its theme in a conversation with teen idol Ronnie
Bostock (Jason Priestly): "You can discover beauty and love
in unexpected places."  The central conceit is that two
opposites can form a bond of sorts, even a love however
unrequited.  "Love and Death on Long Island" features a tour
de force role for John Hurt, perhaps his best film ever.  He
seems to have cameraman Oliver Curtis on a long-chain set
of handcuffs: Hurt appears in virtually every scene.   His
performance is so professional--at once amusing and 
poignant--that we in the audience cannot tire of him, even if
the object of his affection, a teenaged movie store, ultimately
does.
   Yet another story of culture clash, a theme we have seen
recently in "The Edge" (the scholarly and passive Anthony
Hopkins teaming up with the dashing and sportive Alec
Baldwin) and in "Going All the Way" (the nerdy Jeremy
Davies finding a soulmate in the outgoing Ben Affleck), "Love
and Death" binds a duo who are radically different from each
other.  Yet you can't help believing the match.
   John Hurt inhabits the role of Giles De'Ath, a London-based
writer of scholarly books and lecturer in the museum circuit,
who enters a movie house to catch an adaptation of an E.M.
Forster novel.  Instead, the screen shows a vapid, teen-
targeted exploitation work, "Hotpants College II."  Befuddled
and bemused, De'Ath looks at his watch and is about to leave
when he catches its impossibly handsome young star, Ronnie
Bostock (Jason Priestley), and it's love at first sight.  The
aging widower shucks off his research into ethereal matters
and begins to collect what he calls Bostockiana--the star's
videos, magazine articles such as one about "Hollywood's
Most Snoggable Fellas!!" and assures his housekeeper
(Sheila Hancock) that he is too busy to have her cleaning his
room.  Flying to Long Island to meet his new hero on his
home ground, he flatters Bostock's supermodel girl friend
Audrey (Fiona Loewi) to gain entrance to Bostock's home in
Chesterton, meets the idol, and tries to persuade Ronnie to
eschew banality and return with him to Europe to pursue
arthouse fare.  "If Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be
writing 'Hotpants 3'," he assures the incredulous young man.
   "Love and Death on Long Island" scores most in its first
portion, before De'Ath leaves his London residence for the
states, in its sendup of a nineteenth-century sort of man who
is at bay with modern technology.  To capture Bostock's
movies, he buys a VCR--though he at first believes a
microwave machine can display movies--but has to be
convinced that he needs a TV set to hook it up with.  Asked
in an interview whether he has a word processor, he replies
indignantly, "I write: I do not process words."  When he sets
up an answering machine in his home, we know that the man
is driven by irrational impulses.  
   Maury Chaykin has a delightful role as the owner of the
Chesterton town dive, a salt-of-the-earth American who
assures his guest from London that he has "the best hash
browns you ever had."  "That goes without saying," responds
the newly-energized intellectual, taking a break from his
bangers and mash.
   "In Europe film can change the way people think," De'Ath
contends.  A clever and thoroughly entertaining "Love and
Death on Long Island" proves his point. Not Rated.  Running
Time: 93 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
