EQUINOX (1992)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Stories about identical twins separated at birth provide
excellent comedy material for millennia. However, when it
comes to drama or similar material of serious nature,
results are usually much worse. One of such examples is
EQUINOX, 1992 drama directed by Alan Rudolph.</P>
<P>Two twins (played by Matthew Modine in dual role) are Freddy
Ace, hit man and enforcer working for the mob boss Mr. Paris
(played by Fred Ward), and Tony Petosa, humble car mechanic
who works in the garage by his adopted father Pete (played
by M. Emmet Walsh). Two twins don't know about each other
and live completely different lives - Freddy is arrogant
gangster with rich apartment and trophy wife Sharon (played
by Lori Singer) who dreams about becoming boss, while shy
Tony has problems in the relationship with his girlfriend
Beverly Frank (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). Connection
between the two is discovered by morgue attendant and
wannabe writer Sonya Kirk (played by Tyra Farrell) who is
convinced that the twins are actually illegitimate children
of European aristocrat and set to inherit great fortune.</P>
<P>While majority of the filmmakers tends to treat audience
like idiots, Alan Rudolph goes to the other extreme. At
least this is the case in this film with plot and characters
understandable only to people with superhuman intelligence
or those ready to spend entire lifetime trying to decipher
its meaning. EQUINOX features plenty of bizarre characters,
some interesting scenes and situations, but only few of them
are actually connected to each other or make any sense. This
problem is alleviated by bad acting, especially by Matthew
Modine whose uninspired performance creates a lot of
confusion in the beginning, since the audience isn't aware
that he actually plays two different characters. Other
characters are either not necessary or not fleshed out, and
because of that EQUINOX is hardly anything else than
overpretentious "artsy" failure of movie.</P>
