<PRE>Goldeneye
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan; Sean Bean; Izabella Scorupco; Famke Janssen & Joe
Don Baker
This latest film in the 007 series finds the actor Pierce Brosnan in the
title role of the British secret agent. If a person were to compare Brosnan'
s portrayal of Bond to that of his predecessors, the most accurate
description would be to say that Brosnan is a cross between Roger Moore and
Sean Connery. Brosnan has the serious side that Connery brought to the
character. Happily, the element of campy humor that was present when Moore
played the Bond has returned. This is a welcome change from Timothy Dalton's
brooding incarnation in the previous two movies.</P>
<P>The premise of Goldeneye is simple. The Goldeneye is a killer satellite left
over from the cold war era that gets stolen by the usual collection of
villains that are always present in a good Bond flick. This includes one of
the most original "Bond girls" in a long while, played by the beautiful
Famke Janssen. Her outstanding trait is her ability to kill men using her
thighs. (Enough said) And while on the subject of female cast members,
British actress Judi Dench has taken over the role of "M", Bond's boss.</P>
<P>As with all Bond films, Goldeneye has its fair share of nifty spy gadgets
and car chases (and tank chases), enough to satisfy this James Bond fan
anyway. Unlike the previous Bond outing, this one never leaves you with the
feeling that the writers were struggling with the script.</P>
<P>All in all a solid value for your entertainment buck, and probably reason
that producers have signed Brosnan to star in the next bond film. Bond fans
will love this movie, and even folks who don't normally like James Bond
films are bound to have a good time as well.</P>
