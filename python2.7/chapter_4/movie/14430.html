<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Seen at the 16th Annual International Film Festival in Portland, Oregon.</P>
<P>Aside from the fact that this film appears ( technically ) to be a bit of an
amateur effort, at least a few things standout as very good.  The
cinematography is actually very good and well thought out, and were it not
for that this film would pass as a mediocre effort.</P>
<P>However, it isn't a bad film.  It is hampered, and obviously so, by the lack
of quality ( state of the art ) equipment with which a well done film could
have been made.  For an American audience, this will  look a bit like the
films of the fifties, in that almost the whole thing is simple, and straight
forward.  But it is the director's first film,  and as such shows excellent
promise for many years to come, despite a country whose economy is
horrendous.  There are times when the film appears to have been shot with
rather old stock of film, which is about all they probably had.</P>
<P>JERICHO is the story of Friar Santiago who is becoming frustrated with the
way the church does things.  They don't seem to have the enthusiasm for the
environment like he does, or seem to care about anything except their own
expansion.  And for this, he is sent away with a group of  conquistadors
into the jungle, hoping to find new people to deliver the message.  And no
sooner do they cross the first river, does he find the first obstacle.  The
river causes him to lose the books and most of his stuff.  And after the
first night, the group gets split when a band of thieves decides that
following a German commander into the jungle is not what they want.  The
gold is stolen in the middle of the night, and the priest happens to
overhear it and goes out to see it.
He gets caught and has to go with the thieves or lose his life.  He goes.
This group begins dwindling one by one until they get attacked by a group of
Indians, who kill all those running away.  The friar, sits and prays.  the
Indians spare him, because they find him funny.</P>
<P>He is taken in, and begins his job of teaching the Indians Christianity. All
is not well.  They are not agreeable to learning a new word or language.  So
he bides his time, and watches the naked Indians walk around.  One night, he
can't sleep, and one of the couples is in the process of making love.  The
Indian sends him a woman.  Fade to black, much to his embarrassment.  He is
laughed at, because he does not take
the woman.  Eventually, the tribe gets tired of having an outsider
constantly trying to change them.  So they do something about it.  They
inhale a mixture which makes them 'crazy' ( as do so many of those Indians
in the area ) and this time they force it up his nose.  Since the priest is
a stubborn one, he gets several extra doses, until he finally breaks down
his defenses.</P>
<P>In the next event of the tribe they are seen going around a totem pole, and
the priest is going nowhere.  He gets in the middle and is  moving in the
wrong direction.  He meets up with the woman who has taken a liking to him.
The group continues its dance until we  notice that the priest has gotten
rid of his garb, and joined them in  their dance.  He has joined the tribe.</P>
<P>Later, he finally gets to meet another set of conquistadors, and they take
him away.  The priest is now rejoined with another order, and is
encapsulated in a square mud room, where he must remain until he is rid of
the Indian ways, and become a holy man again.  He does not.  Basically, he
will die in this hut, rather than switch back to a faith that really doesn't
care about anyone, except their own motives.</P>
<P>This film is not for the squeamish, for it does have a few scenes which are
untactful, like a cannibalistic scene, and some violence, which is an
obvious comment on the ugly invaders next to the peaceful Indians.  And
there is a good amount of violence, in that the  conquistadors are merciless
in many ways.</P>
<PRE>GOOD FILM.
ONLY FOR THE FILM STUDENT.
RATED RRR FOR ITS MMMM MOMENTS.
FUNNY IN MANY SPOTS.</PRE>
