Entrapment</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Sean Connery (Mac) plays the "James Bond" of the art theft world. Catherine
Zeta-Jones (Gin) is the sexy insurance investigator who travels to England
after him. But who will entrap who? The film does a good job of keeping us
guessing all the way to the end. It's a careful balancing act not unlike the
gymnastics Gin shows off as she twists her body through a scattered array of
laser light alarms.</P>
<P>As always, Connery is terribly charismatic and I can't deny that he is still
handsome in his elder years, but I absolutely don't buy the manipulatively
clever Gin falling for him in a sexual way. Fortunately, all the contact we
have to witness is a short kiss -- which could have been more effective if
only implied.</P>
<P>The film is at its best when entrenched in clever thieving, planning,
gadgetry and execution. This it does very well. The film is at its worst in
its words; the dialogue dipping into immaturity at more than a few points.
All in all, "Entrapment" is a cute/clever, rather TV-esq picture that could
have used just a little more heart.</P>
<P>Starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel.
Screenplay by Ron Bass and William Broyles.
Produced by Sean Connery, Michael Hertzberg, and Rhonda Tollefson at 20th
Century Fox/Regency/Fountainbridge/Hertzberg.
