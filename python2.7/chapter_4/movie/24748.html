<P>         "Mermaids" could well be a Cher fan's dream come true, a lively
tale that allows her to play the kind of free-loving free spirit she
used to sing about in 1970s numbers like "Dixie Girl" ("waitin' on
tables and passin' myself around" went the lyric) and "He'll Never Know"
(in which she vowed never to let her husband find out "his son's only
mine").</P>
<P> As the flashy, uninhibited Rachel Flax, a single mom in 1963
who has some very 1983 ideas about how to handle both her kids and her
men, Cher is playing, if not exactly close to the bone, very close to
her public persona. It's the sort of star turn that could have added up
to one long in-joke, but the actress sells the character and Rachel is
far more likable onscreen than she was in Patty Dann's delightful novel.
By always staying just a little bit ahead of her audience, Cher manages
to cash in on her image and transcend it at the same time.</P>
<P> Matching her every step of the way is the ever-endearing Winona
Ryder, who brings a heartbreaking sincerity and magnificent comic timing
to Charlotte, Rachel's pious daughter who finds herself alternately
tormented by the flames of Hell and the fires of adolescent lust.
Charlotte is so desperate to become a saint -- or at the very least, a
nun -- she's immersed herself in the lore of the church, forcing Rachel
to remind her, in a snide voice, "Charlotte, we're Jewish." Everything
Rachel does seems to embarrass Charlotte, whether it's flirting
outrageously with a kindly shoe salesman (Bob Hoskins) or using cookie
cutters to trim the corners off sandwiches.</P>
<P> The only common ground between the two women is their affection
for baby Kate (Christina Ricci), the product of Rachel's one-night-stand
with an Olympic swimmer. Small surprise that Kate is as obsessed with
water sports as Charlotte is with Catholicism. Adorable without being
for a moment self-conscious or sticky-sweet, Ricci is a child star worth
celebrating.</P>
<P> "Mermaids" is loose and funky, drifting from episode to episode
as casually as Rachel swings from man to man. But while there's not a
surplus of plot, the movie is brimming with warmth, pure eccentricity
and good humor. Most importantly, it allows Ryder and Cher to play off
each other and the vivid, often hilarious clashes that ensue make this a
delight. James Sanford</P>
