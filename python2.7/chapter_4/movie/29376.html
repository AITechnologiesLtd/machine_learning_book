<P>Synopsis: Lifelong friends Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett) join the US 
Air Force and are stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Rafe goes to England 
to fight alongside British pilots and is seemingly killed in action. Danny 
falls in love with Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Beckinsale), but Rafe 
survives and returns to confront his former friend. Meanwhile, the 
Japanese sneak attack is imminent...</P>
<P>Review: "Pearl Harbor" is a perfect example of movies as product rather 
than as art. It is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo 
the masses, enticing them with big stars, big effects, and a big setting 
-- but no heart. It is difficult to criticise the actors, because they do 
everything the movie demands of them. Sadly, this amounts to barely more 
than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to 
see the script Randall Wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time 
as he was writing "Pearl Harbor" with his left. The plot here is pure 
cliche, and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop. There is no 
genuine exploration of what Pearl Harbor meant to the United States, and 
no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join World War 
II. Instead, there is just an assembly-line love triangle, some empty 
patriotic rhetoric, and a laughable attempt to placate Japanese viewers 
via the inclusion of some reticent Imperial commanders (when one intones, 
"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant", I nearly fell out 
of my seat). To the movie's credit, it does include a fantastic portrayal 
of the attack itself, an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers 
into the war. If only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such 
skill, perhaps this Memorial Day non-event would have been worth watching.</P>
