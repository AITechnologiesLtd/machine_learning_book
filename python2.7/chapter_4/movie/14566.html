<P>Produced or sponsored in the UK by the British Broadcasting Corporation,
British Screen, the Arts Council of Britain, Pandora Cinema, and Parallax
Pictures, The Governess is directed by first-timer (in features) Sandra
Goldbacher, and the film's credits are for more women than men. No doubt
about it, the gender gap is closing steadily. In countries like France it
is a fait accompli; in the USA, it is felt more among Independents than in
mainstream Hollywood. Good news.</P>
<P>Set in the early 1840s, the start of the Victorian era (1837-1901), the
film revolves around Rosina Da Silva (Minnie Driver), one of the children
of a wealthy Jewish family in London. What is immediately striking is that
those Jews are members of the Sephardic Community in London, a large,
lively group that, to my knowledge, has hardly been featured in British
cinema, except indirectly and in the person of Benjamin Disraeli who was
of Sepharad Italian-Jewish  descent and became twice Prime Minister under
Queen Victoria.</P>
<P>The Sephardim (from the Hebrew word Sefarad, meaning Spain) were originally
Spanish or Portuguese Jews who were expelled from their countries in the
late 1400s, moved to North Africa and other areas of the then Ottoman
Empire (including the Balkans and Greece) on or near the Mediterranean,
also to countries such as Italy, France, Holland, England. They mostly
retained their Judeo-Spanish language (Ladino),and mostly, too, contributed
hugely to the culture and life of their new homes. They formed the
second-in-size diaspora, after the Ashkenazi , mostly Yiddish-speaking
Jews, who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. (In the U.S.A the Ashkenazim
have always been far more numerous than the Sephardim).</P>
<P>American movies show a wealth of Ashkenazi-descended characters, but hardly
any Sephardim.  For that matter, except, no doubt, in Israeli cinema, very
few films anywhere have dealt principally with Sephardic Jews. Offhand,
only two come to mind:  Every Time we Say Goodbye (Israel, 1986), a
charming WWII romance starring Tom Hanks; and Novia que te vea  (Mexico,
1993) in Ladino literally "would that I could see you becoming a bride,"
directed by a Mexican woman, Guita Schyfter who is no doubt Ashkenazi.</P>
<P>In The Governess, there's a fascinating, long opening of a synagogue, its
mass prayers and its socializing aftermath, reproduced, I would think, with
minute and colorful precision, and introducing Rosina who has a will of her
own and would like to be an actress. But soon after, her father dies and
the family is left debt-ridden. Rosina, a girl with gumption, refuses the
easy solution of marrying a rich and much older fishmonger (who smells of
his product). At a time when women's options for employment were
microscopic, just one venue is open to Rosina: to become a governess. So
she scours newspaper announcements, finds a "wanted" ad, applies under the
Gentile name of Mary
Blackchurch (sic!), forges a false background for herself, and gets hired.</P>
<P>Her employers live on an island off Scotland. The exteriors were filmed on
the Isle of Arran, which filmgoers could perhaps confuse with the Aran (one
r), which is in Ireland,  of Man of Aran, the superb 1934 documentary by
Robert Flaherty. Still, both films happen to have this in common: survival,
physical in Flaherty and social-psychological in the case of Rosina-Mary.</P>
<P>She enters a big house where the first sight is a wall festooned with
trophies of stag-heads, a sight that chills as much as the lack of heating.
Neither is made a point of, but we do feel both in the background. The lady
of the house, Mrs. Cavendish, is bored to extinction, misses the bright
lights and social life of London. Why she accepts this provincial exile is
not spelled out. We might assume that it is because Mr. Charles Cavendish
needs this isolation for his work. A cultivated man with insatiable
curiosity, he is one of those lay, amateur scientists and inventors who
devote their all to research and experiments and often come up with
discoveries. His current passion is for photography.</P>
<P>Rosina slowly adapts, or pretends to, in the somehow Gothic-Gentile milieu,
in spite of ham being served, occasional Christian prayers, and especially
her charge, the bratty child Clementina. Rosina, who has guts, slowly tames
the little shrew. Eventually some affection is born between them. She also
impresses her employers with her culture, knowledge, foreign languages,
even her singing of Schubert. We could have done without the latter. Above
all, she proves to be also scientifically inclined, which leads to her
assisting Mr. Cavendish.</P>
<P>The man's main problem is that while he can make photographs with his
camera obscura, he cannot fix them, that is, find a way to keep the images
from fading. There is no known process for this yet.
(But, to get technical, it seems to me that before 1840 , Talbot in England
and Daguerre in France had
achieved this with the use of "hypo," sodium hyposulphite. I won't quibble
however).</P>
<P>Accidentally, as Rosina is secretly performing a Jewish prayer --note the
symbolism--she stumbles on the answer to the problem. Until now, it was a
given that Charles and Rosina would, for obvious reasons, fall in love. Her
"invention" strengthens the bond, yet at the same time poses ego-problems
for Charles, some stemming from scientific macho-pride (he later has a
scientist visitor but he gives no credit to Rosina), some from a murky
feeling that Rosina is overwhelming his life (later too he tells her "you
consume me, I cannot be consumed").</P>
<P>In-between, the affair proceeds inevitably and predictably, except for
details which add color, especially as Rosina  abandons her fake
eyeglasses, becomes more sexily dressed, gets better-looking, daringly
poses for photographs au naturel (including a Salome dance of the seven
veils), even photographs Charles asleep and naked in the fullest monty -- a
big step beyond The Full Monty movie where Tom Wilkinson (Charles here)
played the foreman of the male strippers. Risque stuff indeed in a story
that marginally smacks of Bronte-Austen novels.</P>
<P>Predictably, when  Henry, the Cavendish's son, is sent down from Oxford,
the boy, at an age when the sap rises quickly, becomes passionate about
Rosina. Predictably, Rosina quits her job, returns to London during a
cholera epidemic. With an abrupt leap in time, we next find Rosina
established as a commercial photographer and a recorder of Jewish life.
Charles appears to have his portrait taken. "I'm in your hands" he tells
her in a symbolic double-entendre. Then, at the end of the posing "Are we
done?" She replies with another double-entendre "Yes, quite done."  She
becomes sought after. "They tell me I captured the beauty of my father's
people." The end.</P>
<P>The Governess has some weak points, among them the nearly total
predictability of the events. But then, lacking this, the film could not be
what it is. On the other hand, there is too much purple prose in the
lovers' dialogue. Also, several scenes are both slow and protracted, as if
the movie's makers wanted to squeeze out every drop of every setup. This
can be a become a bit dull especially since this is a work with few
characters, all supporting except for the Charles-Mary couple. I say Mary
rather than Rosina since we're positive that if he knew that she is a
Jewess --a word frequently used here--he would never have had an affair
with her.</P>
<P>More ambiguous (in her first starring role) is Minnie Driver's presence.
She is no beauty, she does not exude sexuality, she is not captivating. Yet
this serves the movie's feminist side subtly and well, since it tells us
that you don't have to have radiant appeal to be attractive. This also goes
with several scenes of love-making or sex which are quite realistically
awkward or naive.</P>
<P>Overall The Governess score many a good point. I find both the start and
the finish of the movie excellent, the former in its non-cliche nature and
length, the latter in its brusqueness. One also ought to appreciate the
metaphor, the notion that photography means possession which some want but
others do not. Think of New World Indians and others who don't want their
soul stolen by pictures. And fixing the image stands cleverly for the
fixing of relationships, feelings and attitudes.</P>
<P>Without insistence, the movie sketches out a latent anti-Semitism that's
familiar to the director: "at my primary school the only two other Jewish
girls and I felt completely alien, and that was only 20 years ago." There
is no attempt to spell out actions, reactions, states of mind, or to engage
into anachronistic psychology. The cinematography and use of light are
beautiful, with burnished colors, chiaroscuro, candle-light, diffraction of
images seen through pieces of glass or in reflections, etc. The whole is
without forced artiness, including the several occasions when Rosina has
dreams or perhaps sees apparitions of her late, beloved father.</P>
<P>The movie won as Best Film at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival,
today the paramount festival in what used to be the Soviet bloc.</P>
