<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Julia Roberts has been digging herself into a very deep hole, beginning with
the release of My Best Friend's Wedding in 1997. She was cast in the lead role
again and again in the same type of dreamy romance movies, her recent credits
include Stepmom, Notting Hill, and Runaway Bride. After Bride, I was beginning
to get pretty tired of her. It just seemed like she was playing the same person
repeatedly. She has done a marvelous job of digging herself out of the hole
that I mentioned earlier. While she still retains much of the regular Julia
charm, she's able to use it in another way, and the results are a great
comedy/drama that many will enjoy.</P>
<P>Erin Brockovich, (Roberts) a woman with three kids, an interesting assortment
of plunging neckline outfits, and little money, is desperate for a job. When
misfortune leads her to a law office she begs for a job on a whim, right after
her claim is settled. Ed Masry (an amazing Finney) is the head of the small
legal firm. Erin convinces him she will do a good job, and she's hired.</P>
<P>Soon after they hire her, she notices a real estate file that looks suspicious
to her. She investigates the files she finds, which concern chemicals a Pacific
Gas and Electric factory have let get into the water of the small California
town of Hinkley. People in the town are dying of a large variety of illnesses
and everyone has some type of disease or another. For some reason, no one
really seems to do anything about it. They aren't wealthy enough to take care
of their families, and this could go on forever if someone doesn't do
something. Erin discovers that there is an extremely high amount of a deadly
chemical in the water for the town and is determined to help the residents
bring PG&E corporate down. Due to her low knowledge of legal expertise, her and
Masry must team up, in order to win the fight.</P>
<P>Winning performances here from Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. The two have
dazzling chemistry and their is much humor in their developing friendship. The
two make a great team, and writer Susannah Grant (who has also written the
screenplay for the upcoming Sandra Bullock film "28 Days") gives Julia some
great one-liners. It's really fun to see Erin jostle with the big time law
firms. Don't think this movie is all comedy though. It would be appropriately
suited in the dramedy category. The scenes of Erin's struggle with men and her
new love George (Eckhart) are the other part of the movie. The film doesn't get
too crowded, despite it's dramatic and humorous counterparts. Director Steven
Soderbergh (director of two superb pictures, "Out of Sight" and "The Limey")
use the slow fade to death, which makes the film's story appear to be in
chapters, a welcome thing that helps us keep track of the time this movie
covers.</P>
<P>A welcome addition to the Julia Roberts film library, this true story is a fun
drama that will probably appeal to young teenagers and up. Besides the heavy
use of the f-word this would be a good movie to take your kids to. At times
Erin's strife feels too easy, at times too hard, but by the end of the movie,
you'll be rooting for her. The real Erin Brockovich is in the movie, look for
her in the diner scene as a waitress named Julia. What fun, I can't wait to see
what Roberts does next. And maybe if the movie catches on, we'll even see a
line of Erin Brockovich clothing, now wouldn't that be interesting.</P>
