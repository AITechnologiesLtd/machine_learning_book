<P>World War II ended in 1945. A year later, in June 1946, the Soviet 
dictator Josef Stalin started a barrage of propaganda in the West, 
especially western Europe where there were many thousands of Russian 
émigrés. Stalin promised milk and honey, or more specifically, 
amnesty, a Russian passport, a warm welcome to the Soviet Union which 
the returnees would help reconstruct after its destructions during 
the Hitler War, and in fact make it even better a Workers' Paradise 
than it used to be.  Russians seem to be more sentimental and 
nostalgic for their country than other people. So a lot of the 
émigrés took the bait --and lived (sometimes very briefly) to regret 
it.</P>
<P>Among them was Alexei Golovin a young doctor from Paris, his young 
French wife Marie, and their 7-year French-born son Serioja.</P>
<P>No sooner had the ship reached Odessa, even before all the passengers 
were on terra firms, the Golovin couple and many others realized what 
a mistake their return was. The majority of returnees get jailed, 
executed or are sent to gulags. The Golovins are spared because the 
Soviets need doctors.</P>
<P>The family is sent to Kiev, in a horrible "kommunalka" apartment 
where at best one gets just room per family, shares facilities (an 
euphemism--we see a man coming out of the toilet carrying his own 
wooden seat!), have no peace, no privacy, and be subjected to 
miseries by others. The people are also always spied upon, informed 
on, betrayed. It's not a wonderful life.</P>
<P>Very, very soon Marie wants to return to France -- and she would be 
stupid if she did not--but in the Soviet Union, what's done cannot be 
undone. Stalinist paranoia and mass madness rule, no one is safe, not 
even in his or her thoughts, not to mention that the least act or 
action can and will result in catastrophes.</P>
<P>Alexei agrees with his wife, but being more realistic (as well as of 
Russian extraction) he advises patience --which will lead a split in 
the couple. It's all very believable and very well documented and 
shown. A third, important character, depending on your set of mind, 
may or may not be considered a melodramatic addition. He is Sacha, 
the teen-ager and star swimmer (played by the son of one of the 
film's writers) who, under circumstances that I find not at all hard 
to believe, enters into a special relationship with Marie and later 
becomes part of her scheme to be taken back to France. The latter is 
a thread (a fat one too) that runs throughout the plot as it deals 
with the failed efforts of the woman (partly because her French 
passport was torn up by the Soviets) to contact French authorities in 
Russia.</P>
<P>There is a great more in incidents, events, surprises, suspense and 
criticism of Stalinist Russia. The movie was filmed in Russia for the 
most part, and has an undeniable  visual authenticity. It is, of 
course, manicheistic, with white hats vs black hats, but there is 
really no way to maintain half-tones and subtleties in situations 
which, in real life, were black and white with little in-between.</P>
<P>Political films are becoming rare and more's the pity. Wargnier 
(pronounced Var-NYEH) had earlier won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for 
his also political "Indochine."
I hope he stays on the track of history and politics, which teaches 
audiences a great deal more than space travel fiction.</P>
