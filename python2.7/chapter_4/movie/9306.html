<P>     Sad to say, MOST WANTED is yet another poorly-executed government 
conspiracy thriller, joining the lackluster ranks of SHADOW CONSPIRACY, 
MURDER AT 1600, and CONSPIRACY THEORY.  MOST WANTED is intended as a 
vehicle for Keenan Ivory Wayans, action hero (as opposed to Keenan Ivory 
Wayans, talented comic).  But, while Wayans the actor has an undeniable 
screen presence, Wayans the writer lets him down.  Not only is the 
screenplay for MOST WANTED laughably absurd, but it contains line after 
line of the worst dialogue available in any film currently on a 
multiplex screen.  Yet the film makers still expect us to take MOST 
WANTED seriously.</P>
<P>     In general, action films are not known for their intelligence, but 
this one takes assumptions of the audience's stupidity a little too far.  
For a movie this dimwitted to succeed, it has to keep viewers under a 
constant barrage of pyrotechnics, gunfire, chases, and other assorted 
thrills.  It can't allow them a moment's pause to actually think.  
Inexplicably, this is not first time director David Glenn Hogan's 
approach.  So, although the action sequences are all well-choreographed, 
there are significant pauses between them.  The film makers have 
foolishly inserted exposition into those dead zones, and the more we 
learn about the conspiracy underlying MOST WANTED, the more we realize 
it would be better left unexplained.</P>
<P>     The movie opens with an offer.  General Adam Woodward (Jon Voight), 
the tough-talking head of a government-sponsored, covert assassination 
group, visits Sgt. James Dunn (Wayans) in a military prison where he is 
serving a life term for killing a superior officer.  Woodward gives Dunn 
a chance at freedom if he joins his team for "Operation Wrath" -- an 
officially-sanctioned hit of industrialist Donald Bickhart (Robert 
Culp), whose company specializes in the manufacture of biological 
weapons.  Dunn, a sharpshooter, is to be placed on a rooftop in downtown 
L.A. when Bickhart arrives in the company of the First Lady for the 
dedication of a hospital wing he financed.  It's supposed to be a clean, 
quick operation, but it doesn't go that way.</P>
<P>     Someone fires before Dunn gets a shot off, and the First Lady is 
killed.  Suddenly, Dunn is on the run, the fall guy for the 
assassination.  Joined by Dr. Victoria Constantini (Jill Hennessy), an 
eyewitness whose videotape can prove his innocence, Dunn finds himself 
pursued by mobs eager for the $10 million reward posted for his arrest.  
Meanwhile, Woodward, who is heading the official investigation into the 
incident, wants Dunn dead before he can talk, and the deputy director of 
the CIA (Paul Sorvino) suspects a setup.</P>
<P>     Where MOST WANTED gets into trouble is using a worn-out cliche 
(high-level government corruption) as the fulcrum of a totally 
implausible, unnecessarily convoluted story.  The conspiracy here has 
many levels, and the more diligently you try to figure out exactly 
what's going on, the more apparent it becomes how ludicrous the entire 
scheme is.  MOST WANTED features some adequate action sequences, but 
nothing that can suitably camouflage the weakness of the plot.  Plus, 
all the action film standbys are on hand:  a scene in an elevator shaft, 
a car fleeing from a fireball, and an LED countdown readout (Roger Ebert 
will be glad to know that this time it's green, not red).</P>
<P>     Wayans does the best he can with the role, but he only has himself 
to blame for its limitations.  Jon Voight, who lately seems to be 
choosing roles that allow him to chew the scenery (check out ANACONDA 
and U-TURN for other examples), goes at it full-throttle here, recalling 
images of James Woods and Donald Sutherland at their most over-the-top.  
Jill Hennessy (A SMILE LIKE YOURS) is bland but attractive as Dunn's 
hostage-turned-sidekick.  And Paul Sorvino's quietly dignified 
performance is completely wasted.  The supporting cast includes Robert 
Culp, Wolfgang Bodison as the real assassin, and Eric Roberts as 
Sorvino's assistant.</P>
<P>     I'm getting bored of dumb action movies, and there have been far 
too many of them this year.  When I go into a theater to see explosions 
and shootouts, I don't look for a script that resembles Shakespeare, but 
I expect it to make sense and keep my attention.  MOST WANTED does 
neither.  It's a poor excuse for entertainment, and, in the wake of THE 
GLIMMER MAN, this has me seriously wondering about Keenan Ivory Wayans' 
choice of motion picture material.</P>
