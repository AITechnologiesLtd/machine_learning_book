<P>The romantic comedy, "Keeping the Faith," marks the directoral debut of
Edward Norton and, as a director, Norton remains one hell of a terrific
actor. Not that this is a bad film. "Keeping the Faith" boasts three
appealing leads along with a host of charming supporting players. Many
scenes are quite effective and the New York City production is
refreshingly sunny.</P>
<P>But the movie is simply too much. Situations are resolved too easily.
The opening segment, featuring slapstick that does not fit the
characters, is too cutesy. The story is too talky and, at two hours and
seven minutes, it's too long for a romantic comedy. If the infinitely
more complex classic, "The Philadelphia Story," was able to tie its
storylines together in 112 minutes, surely Norton could have wrapped
this baby up in an hour and a half.</P>
<P>But first time directors are notorious for throwing in everything but
the kitchen sink. And when the first time director is working from a
script written by an old college buddy (Yale alum and former investment
banker Stuart Blumberg), the prospect of trimming the screenplay must be
especially hard.</P>
<P>Blumberg's story is a twist on the tried and true romantic triangle, not
to mention the beginning of countless old jokes that start with "A
priest and a rabbi…" Brian (Norton), Jake (Ben Stiller) and Anna (Jenna
Elfman) were childhood friends until Anna moved away, leaving her pals
broken-hearted. Years later, when the adult Anna returns to NYC,
circumstances have changed dramatically. Brian is an idealistic priest,
Jake a scrappy rabbi and Anna a high-powered executive with a cell phone
growing out of her hand.</P>
<P>Then Jake falls for Anna, Anna falls for Jake and the two secretly begin
dating, while Brian quietly falls for Anna and spends a lot more time
than usual praying and keeping his hands out of his pockets. Soon, the
friendship between the men begins to fray, as Jake slacks off on his
work for the interfaith community center that has long been their dream
project. Of course, Brian eventually learns the reason why and you can
take it from there.</P>
<P>The premise is sturdy enough, but the principal characters talk it to
death. For that matter, the supporting cast does a great deal of
yammering as well. And then there are the subplots and grafted on
slapstick (a rabbi who faints at a bris? Give me a break).</P>
<P>For the most part, Edward Norton's direction is solid, with one notable
exception. About two thirds of the way through, there is an extended
scene of Brian and Jake chatting outdoors. In each shot where the camera
is positioned behind Brian's head facing Jake, Brian's lines are
obviously dubbed in. When Jake finishes talking, we hear Brian, but his
jaw either doesn't move, or moves out of synch with his lines. Come on,
Norton, this is a romantic comedy, not a Godzilla movie.</P>
<P>As far as date movies go, "Keeping the Faith" is smarter and more
genuine than most. But with a tighter script and less shtick, it could
have been much, much better.</P>
