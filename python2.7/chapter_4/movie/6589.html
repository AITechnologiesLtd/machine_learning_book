<PRE>                        THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1948)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     The 1948 version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS is the exact sort of film
most people have in mind when they call something a "costume drama,"
usually implying sarcastically that the show is really all costume and
no drama.</P>
<P>     THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1948) was directed by the great musical
director George Sidney.  His pictures include ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, SHOW
BOAT, and BYE BYE BIRDIE.  His rendition of THE THREE MUSKETEERS is one
of his non-musical movies, but he cast a musical star, Gene Kelly, in
the title role of D'Artagnan.  Although you are convinced that the
scene where Kelly will either sing or dance is just around the corner,
it never appears.  To compensate for this Kelly has numerous athletic
jumps, and, of course, he fences in every other scene.  The chief
motivation to see this version is to marvel at the costumes by Walter
Plunkett and to watch the sword fighting.</P>
<P>     Gene Kelly has long hair and neither looks nor acts like himself.
His companions as the three musketeers are Van Heflin as Athos, Gig
Young as Porthos and Robert Coote as Aramis.  They dress in bright,
frilly outfits of powder blue, lavender, rose, and salmon colors.  It
strains credulity to think of these as clothes to fight in, but at
least they look magnificent.  The women's gowns are even more
outlandishly lavish.  The wide spectrum of bright colors makes the show
look like a test for a new film stock.</P>
<P>     If you are looking for a lightweight show where all of the actors
have a blast making it, then look no further.  This is it.  The good
guys are never in any real danger, and the bad are not particularly
threatening.  A great costume romp, and high camp too.  No one takes
his part seriously.</P>
<P>     A typical scene is when D'Artagnan first meets the three
musketeers.  One by one, he angers each of them and ends up being
challenged to consecutive duels, scheduled one hour apart.  These are
abandoned when enemies of the king arrive, and the four of them band
together to fight for the king.</P>
<P>     The show appears cast for stars rather than roles.  Lana Turner is
haunting as Milady de Winter, and June Allyson is radiantly lovely as
Constance Bonacieux.  Less well thought out choices are Angela Lansbury
who seems lost as Queen Anne, and Vincent Price who is never convincing
as Cardinal Richelieu.  Price flubs such already ridiculous lines as,
"When we think, our impulsive enemies are helpless."</P>
<P>     One of the old time classic lines is Athos's, "It's all for one,
D'Artagnan, and one for all."  Van Heflin takes this rousing anthem to
bravery and camaraderie, and turns it into a trivial one, much like,
"okay, let's go guys."</P>
<P>     The music by Herbert Stothart borrows liberally from Tchaikovsky,
which makes for some romantic tunes.  The colorful cinematography by
Robert H. Planck takes full advantage of the splendor of the costumes.
The sets by Henry Grace and Edwin B. Willis stick to dull grays and
browns, all the better to set off the colors of the gowns.</P>
<P>     This version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS is only one of many film
versions of the novel by Alexandre Dumas.  I suspect there is a better
version, but it has been so long since I have seen the others, I cannot
say this confidently.  I remember liking the 1974 version with Michael
York, but that was twenty-two years ago, and I no longer remember
precisely how good it was.</P>
<P>     THE THREE MUSKETEERS runs 2:00.  It is not rated, but would be G.
There is no sex, nudity, or profanity.  The violence is fairly
bloodless, and most people die by having the sword clearly thrust into
the air under their armpits.  My son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, gives it a
thumb almost up.  He liked the D'Artagnan part and the sword fighting,
but the little blood in the show scared him.  He says the film is for
kids 5 1/2 and up, and I agree.  I give the show a mild thumbs up for
mindless, swashbuckling fun, and I award it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
