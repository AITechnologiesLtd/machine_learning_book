<PRE>A Mesmerizing `Matrix'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>In some of the trailers, we hear that `the matrix is something that has
to be seen to be understood.'  And, I think that I will have to preface
this review by making this same statement.  Indeed, `The Matrix'
introduces so many clever ideas, that this science fiction thriller
deserves to be seen and not just read in a review. </P>
<P>You will not read any spoilers herein.  `The Matrix' of the movie is
some kind of entity that exists among us, but neither you nor I know
that it actually exists.  We just go about our daily business,
oblivious to it because `the wool has been pulled over our eyes.'  But
its purpose is heinous in nature and its destruction is something that
is seen as vital.  Only a few key people know the truth.  Those who do
face eradication by the Matrix and its loyal secret-service-like
enforcers, known as ‘Agents'.  These few key people include the
patriarchal leader, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and warrior princess
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Morpheus has been on a life-long quest to
find that one person who possesses the special ability to see through
the facade, understand the secret of the Matrix, and make things right.
 And he believes that he has finally found him in Neo (Keanu Reeves). 
The movie spends much of its time developing this premise.  Neo is
eventually convinced that what Morpheus has to say about the Matrix,
despite its hard-to-swallow absurdity and horrific ramifications, is
the truth, and he agrees to join.</P>
<P>Once this happens, the movie moves into high hear.  In order to prepare
Neo for what's out there, he is introduced to various training
programs.  Once such benefit is his teachings of the martial arts,
which creates opportunities for some very well-choreographed
hand-to-hand sequences.  Along with superb combat skills, he must also
develop his mind in an effort to be able to see the Matrix for what it
is.  Admittedly, I wasn't totally convinced at how he finally arrives
at that point, but getting there is terrific fun.  I hesitate to go
into more detail because the trailers don't give away any of the
secrets or the really good stuff of the film.  But I can say that the
best of science fiction isn't the power of the laser guns, the array of
wild humanoid creatures, or epic battles among spacecraft.  Rather,
they are the stories that give us a peek into our own humanity.  In
this case, as we are fast approaching a time when the line between
reality and simulation becomes increasingly blurred, the movie explores
the implications attached to making choices between what is real and
our fantasies.  But there is a fundamental question that the film never
answers.  What will happen next when everyone finally learns the truth?
 It's hard to imagine the answer despite the amount of imagination that
is present in this film.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, it's evident that a lot of thought went into the
progression of the movie and it's various sequences.  I really liked
the look and feel of this film.  It's atmosphere and enigmatic
characters (such as the Oracle and the chief Agent) suggested a world
with dark secrets.  The film is a dazzling feast of visuals and the
action sequences are terrific, especially one featuring a helicopter
rescue.  Even at 135 minutes in length, the energy of the film never
diminishes.  `The Matrix' doesn't give you all the answers, but it's a
pure adrenaline rush learning what you can.</P>
