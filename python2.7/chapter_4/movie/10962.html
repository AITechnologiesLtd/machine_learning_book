<P>Everybody... needs somebody... everybody...</P>
<P>THE BLUES BROTHERS.  It's a classic.  It's John Landis.  It's John
Belushi.  It's Dan Aykroyd.  It's blues music.  It's great comedy.</P>
<P>Now it's 18 years later.  Now it's BLUES BROTHERS 2000.  It's John
Landis.  It's Dan Aykroyd.  It's John Goodman.  It's Joe Morton.  It's
J. Evan Bonifant.  It's blues music.  It's good comedy.</P>
<P>BLUES BROTHERS 2000 starts off just the way you'd want it to - with a
card that says "for" followed by the names of John Candy, Cab Calloway,
and John Belushi.  Then, with "John the Revelator" playing over the
soundtrack, we watch Elwood Blues emerge from prison.  He stands and
waits for his brother Jake (originally played by John Belushi), until
the prison warden (Frank Oz, who was the corrections officer in the
original film) approaches him, puts his hand on Elwood's shoulder, and
says, simply, "I'm sorry."  Elwood understands.  He bows his head,
silently, in grief.  It's a moment that reminds us that these
characters, as screwball as they may seem, still have a heart and soul.</P>
<P>Elwood recieves a letter from Sister Mary Stigmata - now Mother Stigmata
- asking him to come see her.  He does, and when he arrives, he learns
that his surrogate father, Curtis (Cab Calloway in the first film), has
also passed on.  It's then that Elwood realizes that he's lost his
family, and, left yearning for his old friends, he decides that it's
time, once again, to get the band back together.</P>
<P>But Mother Stigmata wants him to a mentor to a young troublemaker,
Buster.  And Elwood wants his sort-of step-brother (the sort-of gets
explained by Stigmata and Elwood through a couple of dialogue
sequences), Cabel, who happens to be an Illinois state police captain,
to join the band.  And pretty soon Elwood meets a bartender who can
actually sing pretty well, Mack McTeer.  And of course, Mack joins the
band.</P>
<P>And pretty soon, also, the police are after the band, as are the Russian
mafia, a group of white supremacists, and a collection of orphanage
workers who fear Elwood's kidnapped Buster.  And they're all chasing the
newly reassembled Blues Brothers Band across state after state as they
head to a "Battle Of The Bands" contest in New Orleans.  Naturally this
results in lots of wacky chase scenes and the like.  It's a Blues
Brothers speciality.  </P>
<P>The comedy here is good.  It's fun.  But it's not on the same level as
the hilarious, classic stuff from the first film.  It does, however,
recreate the feel of the first film, and that's important.  The city
backdrops that line all the scenes as Elwood travels through Chicago
during the first half of the movie add to that feeling, too.</P>
<P>The music, though, IS pretty much on the same level, and offers a wider
variety of blues acts from both today and yesterday, ranging from Aretha
Franklin to Blues Traveler.  It's great fun, very exhilerating, and is
sure to get you moving to the beat with some area of your person.  It's
probably the film's strongest aspect.</P>
<P>As far as annoying aspects, well, the fantasy in this film is heavier
than in the first.  Both films ignore the laws of physics in favor of
wild comedy, but this one also tosses magic into the mix periodically. 
Of course, that's not too hard to accept, really - this is the Blues
Brothers, you weren't expecting something serious, were you?</P>
<P>But in all of this, the movie still has an underlying heart and soul to
it.  In the original, it was about getting the money to save the
orphanage.  Now, it's about Elwood getting a new structure for his
life.  Even if this isn't a major theme, there remains something
satisfying about seeing Elwood build himself a new family to hold his
life together, out of old friends from the band, plus new friends like
the large-yet-shy Mack and the lovable Buster, who feels the blues in
him even at age 10, and steals a lot of scenes.  Out of the four major
players, Cabel is the least characterized, but it doesn't really matter,
because Joe Morton always holds a presence on the screen.</P>
<P>The sign that, even if it isn't a classic, this is still a good movie,
is that it leaves you wanting more.  Does that mean there should be
another sequel?  I'm not sure about that.  I don't know where else the
band could go from here.  Even this one borrows a number of elements
from the first movie.  And while that's not a serious problem for this
sequel, as it still takes those elements in new directions, one has to
note that, if these elements were used a third time, they most likely
wouldn't be able to hold up.</P>
<P>So, see BLUES BROTHERS 2000.  Enjoy it.  It's fun, and the music is
great.  Maybe it's not nearly as hilarious as the classic first one, but
it still manages to be funny, and it's just likable.  Most importantly,
even though John Belushi's wild antics are obviously missed, this
manages to be a respectable, well-done follow-up to THE BLUES BROTHERS,
despite what many naysayers feared.  To have that be pulled off, after
18 years, is something to be proud of.  John Landis has made his best
movie in a long time, and it looks that, perhaps, Dan Aykroyd, thanks to
this and his memorable-yet-smaller role in GROSSE POINTE BLANK (1997),
may be entering into his renaissance after a long dry period.    </P>
