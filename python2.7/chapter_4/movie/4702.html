<PRE>                        THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1985) **1/2</PRE>
<P>        A woman claiming to be my #1 fan has begged me for 
months to watch and review this 80's staple and, not wanting to get my 
ankles shattered with a sledgehammer, I decided to oblige her. She 
told me THE BREAKFAST CLUB was her favorite movie and she'd 
watched it scores of times and even reenacted the movie herself with 
action figures. I expected it to be good--after all, this woman has the 
good taste to be obsessed with my writing. Of course, it turns out I 
didn't like THE BREAKFAST CLUB as much as I thought I would and 
only gave it a two-and-a-half star rating, so I may get the 
sledgehammer treatment yet.</P>
<P>        The movie works in theory--an ambitious teen comedy from 
John Hughes (WEIRD SCIENCE, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF) 
taking place almost entirely in a high school library where five 
completely different students are spending their Saturday in detention 
for one transgression or another. The concept appealed to me, as did 
the movie's opening, which featured voice-overs from each of the 
characters as they arrived for their punishment (to the background 
strains of an extended version of Simple Minds' "Don't You Forget 
About Me"). I kept waiting for some brilliant comedy dialogue to come 
along, but except for a few small laughs, not too much entertainment 
transpired.</P>
<P>        The characters are cut out of the basic teen stereotypes. 
There's the rebellious Neanderthal (Judd Nelson, who might as well be 
called Judd Dredd), the stuck-up "princess" (Molly Ringwald, entering 
her eighth minute of fame here), the wrestling-letter jock (Emilio 
Estevez), the brainy nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and the antisocial 
freak (Ally Sheedy). These five people would normally never associate 
with each other, but the circumstances force them to get to know each 
other and eventually, as the laws of predictability clearly state, become 
friends.</P>
<P>        Predictability reigns supreme in THE BREAKFAST CLUB 
without ever having any original insights to redeem it. When you have 
a movie that consists of 95% dialogue, the dialogue better be 
something good, alternatingly funny or poignant. The majority of the 
time, THE BREAKFAST CLUB is neither. And when the climactic 
moment you knew was coming finally arrives, it seems out of place. 
All of a sudden, the characters launch into speeches about how bad 
their lives are. Ringwald's got pressure from her friends, Estevez has a 
domineering father who's trying to regain his lost youth through his 
son, Nelson's home life sucks, Hall is flunking shop class and Sheedy 
is just plain nuts. These monologues should be dramatic or touching, 
but something's missing and I'm not quite sure what. The 
performances are all good, but something in the writing is lacking 
here and in the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>        THE BREAKFAST CLUB has always been touted as one of 
the quintessential teen movies of the 80's and, like I said, I was 
expecting it to be one, but it let me down by combining a predictable 
plot with bad writing. It's also unnecessarily depressing at parts, with 
an ending that's supposed to make up for all the angst-ridden 
arguments. [WARNING: Don't read this part if you don't want to 
know the ending.] Out of nowhere, Ringwald, who has stated 
repeatedly how much she hates Nelson and spent the movie arguing 
with him, suddenly starts making out with him for no reason at all. It's 
almost as contrived as having Ringwald give Sheedy a makeover. 
Suddenly she's a _beautiful_ freak and Estevez likes her. The end.</P>
<PRE>        I guess I'll have to notify my #2 fan that she's just been 
promoted.</PRE>
