<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A chic modern vampire tale that is visually pleasing in its presentation but its
scattered storyline seemed anemic, as it wavers between a love and horror story.
It also offers a facile philosophy tract on good and evil (the Chinese director
studied philosophy in England), as the director takes a stab at making this film
into a religious fable about finding the truth. The serial killer vampire at one
point says, there's something about goodness that brings out evil. That I take
to be the film's heavy statement, as it comes between the vampire's long stares,
heavy breathing sounds, and gushy looks at his women vics before he sates
himself on their blood. </P>
<P>It was a strange and stylishly modern vampire tale that is set in London, that
tried to be ever so cute and succeeded mostly in being enigmatic and weirdly
captivating as both a thriller and a romance story. Steven Grslcz (Jude Law),
his last name being a Bulgarian one, is a vampire posing as a medical researcher
and a portrait artist (he can draw with both hands simultaneously) while trying
to find the perfect mate. He only seeks vics who fall in love with him, as he
states all their emotions are stored in their blood. Their blood samples are
meticulously labeled, after he does his thing on them. </P>
<P>The film opens with Steven's last date dead because of a car accident, as her
wrecked car is suspended in the treetops. Steven next saves Maria Vaughan (Kerry
Fox) from jumping onto the tracks on the Underground and gives her his business
card with his home phone number (his pick up method of choice), and when she
calls he brings her to his fancy bachelor pad and does his vampire thing on her.
Then cleans the blood-splattered wall of his bedroom, wraps her body in a sheet,
and drives far away to dump it out at sea. </P>
<P>He writes in his diary after her death--disappointment. After the one in the car
wreck, he wrote--despair. When Maria's body turns up in a fisherman's net, he
calls the police but lies to them. He mentions that he went out with her, but
then broke up with her when she asked him to marry. The police, Inspector Healey
(Spall) and Sergeant Roche (Davenport), make him a prime suspect. </P>
<P>When Inspector Healey follows him and is attacked in the Underground by a gang
of vicious muggers, he's saved by Steven. This doesn't stop the inspector from
trying to get evidence against his most cooperative suspect. The relationship
between the cop and the suspect was grounded in reality and had the only
dialogue in the film that wasn't risible. </P>
<P>In the meantime Steven has met an attractive structural engineer who suffers
from asthma, Anne Levels (Elina Löwensohn), and she finds him exotic and
mysterious but plays hard to get. Their love blossoms after he saves her from
being raped by the teddy boy looking gang leader of the muggers. </P>
<P>Their perfect love is interrupted by some ridiculous dialogue between them,
especially the one about the theory of three-brains. He confides to Anne that
everyone has three brains: a human, a horse and a crocodile. The film isn't good
when it comes to following the script, it seems pleasing only because of the
visually chilling atmosphere it presents. </P>
<P>The incredulous ending indicates that the film had run out of the few ideas it
had and resorted to making Law act like a yuppie serial killer who chases his
vic across a roof and offers her some kind of hope for eternal love. This is the
kind of delicate horror film with artsy pretensions that has Law tell the pale
looking Löwensohn, that he needs the love that is in her blood. There were too
many lines like that for me to be pleased with the film overall, as it seemed to
me that it wished it could be more campy and funny yet it foolishly took itself
to be a serious drama. There was something comical in its blood that it couldn't
quite get out of its bloodstream. It also turns out that Law isn't even a
vampire, just a guy with a mysterious medical condition. He lacks a specific
component in his blood without which he will die. That doesn't give him long to
live, as he needs the blood of young women who love him to sustain him; for it
is only when their blood is at the height of passion that it crystalizes.
Unfortunately for his vics, the price they pay for loving him is their death.
Which makes it a morbid love that Law is after. </P>
<P>A good premise does not necessarily lead to a good script, and that's what does
this hazy puzzler in: the beautiful looking film just doesn't make sense and
can't be explained away by such weak attempts at philosophizing. </P>
