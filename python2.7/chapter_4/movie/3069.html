<PRE>"It's a tragedy."
"I'll say."
        - Palminteri back to Tilly</PRE>
<P>     Let's face it, Woody Allen never changes and his yearly movies
never disappoint.  That much we know.  His films always open with the
same nondescript titles, they always star an great ensemble cast, and,
lately at least, they always comment on the role of the artist.</P>
<P>     BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is set in the 1920's and stars John Cusack
as a young Village playwright with a mob boss as a backer.  The catch:
the boss's mistress (Jennifer Tilly) has to get a part.  The girl can't
act, but she's no worse than the material--dialogue that a needs
doctor and needs one badly.  Help arrives in the form of the bodyguard
(Chaz Palminteri), who has a better ear than the author and who starts
suggesting rewrites to the playwright.</P>
<P>     Light, loose, and a little bit overlong, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY has
several side-splitting sequences.  The best, by far, is the first
meeting between the playwright, the mobster, and mistress.  Who else
but Jennifer Tilly can pronounce "hors d'oeuvres" as "horse dervs" and
sound so natural?  Then there's Dianne Wiest, enormous fun as an aging
theater queen who bears no small resemblance to Norma Desmond.  Her
great line:  "Don't speak."</P>
<P>OSCAR WATCH:   Wiest and, maybe, Tilly and Palminteri.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:   Weighted with just a handful of heavy themes, BULLETS
               OVER BROADWAY is Woody Allen's lightest film in years.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
