<PRE>Safe Men
by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></PRE>
<P>For some reason, the rising tide of political correctness in Hollywood
still has not reached stupid people -- forgive me, the "differently
intelligenced".  It's still perfectly PC to make fun of the stupid,
which is convenient, as their ranks grow daily.  Safe Men has no other
purpose, no other reason for existing:  it is doggedly dedicated to
poking fun at its witless characters.  There's no one in this movie with
the motherwit to think themselves out of a wet paper bag.  The problem
is, the filmmakers make the assumption that the audience is every bit as
stupid as the characters.</P>
<P>The movies starts out promisingly enough.  There's a cleverly done
cross-cutting scene to open the movie, where we are introduced to inept
safecrackers Mitchell and Frank and horribly inept singer/songwriters
Samuel and Eddie (Sam Rockwell, Steve Zahn).  Samuel and Eddie's act is
just indescribably bad.  We see them doing their act at a Polish
fraternal lodge.  They're wearing these outfits on loan from the Museum
of Dorkiness, and they're playing some sort of odd technopop that just
beggars description.  This sounds like it could be funny -- like a last
half-hour sketch in a bad Saturday Night Live episode in an off-season
-- but instead, the movie audience has the same embarrassed and
uncomprehending stare that the elderly Poles have.  A conversation after
the show reveals that Samuel is a few links short of a kielbasa dinner,
and that Eddie is only marginally smarter, if that.</P>
<P>The plot begins when Samuel and Eddie are mistaken for the safecrackers,
and are intimidated by the Jewish Mafia into actually robbing safes.
Problem is, the Jewish Mafia is led by Big Fat Bernie Gayle (Michael
Lerner) and Veal Chop (Paul Giamatti) who are, themselves, a couple of
matzo balls short of a Passover dinner.  The plot meanders on from here,
driven entirely by the stupidity of the characters.</P>
<P>Safe Guys isn't just a movie about dumb people doing dumb things, it's a
movie that's been completely dumbed down.  The audience is expected to
believe, during the course of the movie, that:</P>
<P> -- the appropriate response to a mob death threat is a gift basket full
of country jellies
--  Samuel and Eddie, who aren't bright enough to crack open a comic
book, are somehow able to open safes
--  Big Fat Bernie actually believes that Samuel and Eddie can open
safes, in spite of obvious and manifest evidence to the contrary
-- Samuel and Eddie can't hear the operation of a band saw in the next
room, even with a stethoscope held up to  the wall, but can hear
whispers outside
--  Harvey Fierstein would be a good casting choice as a rival Jewish
gangster</P>
<P>And, of course, there are other sheerly incredible plot points that I
won't reveal here -- all converging in the one central premise that the
audience is a bunch of nitwits, the same as the characters.</P>
<P>The movie is odd in other ways as well.  It is ostensibly set in the
mid-90's, but the clothes and the decor seem to be from a weird
1975-1985 time warp.  Add in the Mafia tie-ins, and it's like a Quentin
Tarantino movie on Ritalin.  The sight gags are numerous and inventive,
easily the best part of the movie -- but not enough to make the movie
funny by themselves.  And the directing by first-timer John Hamburg...
well, let's just say that when I (not the most observant person in the
world) start noticing things like boom mikes appearing where they
shouldn't, there's a problem.</P>
<P>The performances are pretty decent.  Lerner isn't really a figure of
menace as the mob boss, but he isn't one, really, just someone who
spoils his kid rotten.  Giamatti has an eye-rolling monologue early on
about "Lawrence Nightingale Syndrome", but he's mostly wasted as
Lerner's cabana boy.  Rockwell is so convincing as an idiot that he
strays into Keanu Reeves territory.  Zahn might have been convincing had
his character been a shade better written -- as it is, he spends the
whole movie in a battle of wits with Rockwell's unarmed character.</P>
<P>Safe Men is a low-budget independent movie, so it's probably not nice of
me to be knocking it so.  However, there are plenty of low-budget movies
out there that exhibit good writing and interesting characters without
insulting the intelligence of the moviegoer.  Go see one of them
instead.</P>
