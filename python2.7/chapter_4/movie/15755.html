<P>     SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE offers an answer to 400 years' worth of high
school English students who wondered why the heck he wrote that way --
turns out he spoke that way, too.  As portrayed by Joseph Fiennes in this 
smart, sly and enchanting historical confection, Will Shakespeare is a
the quintessential artist as hopeless romantic.  Afflicted with writer's
block and surviving only by scamming advances on his next play, Will needs
a muse to inspire him.  When he finds one -- the beautiful gentlewoman
Vila de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) -- the words flow faster than he can
contain them, both onto the page and from his lips.  A poet awash in the
language he gives to his own grand emotions, he even annoys his
contemporaries into requests that he "talk prose."</P>
<P>     One of the many brilliant twists in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is how it
treats its protagonists' love with both utter sincerity and an ironic 
wink.  The affair between Will and Viola is, of course, doomed -- he's an
impoverished artist with an estranged wife and family, she's well-born and
promised to the haughty Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth) -- yet that's part of
what makes it so appealing for both of them.  Prohibited from pursing an
acting career by the era's prohibition of women on the stage (Elizabethan
drama cast men in drag in women's roles), Viola sees her alliance with
Will as a double rebellion against society; for Will, an ultimately
unattainable woman inspires the heights of romantic idealism his art
requires.  As the two fairly glow in each other's presence, it's always
clear that they're building a sense memory, not a relationship.</P>
<P>     Before it begins to seem that SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is merely a
meta-commentary on romantic love, it should be clear that it's a sharp
comedy which uses that theme for wonderful satire.  The central romance
becomes a parallel to the play Will is writing during the film -- one
which begins as the comedy "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter" but
morphs into something a bit more tragic.  While debt-ridden theater owner
Philip Henslowe (a great bit of comic acting by Geoffrey Rush) pleads for
Will to create a crowd-pleasing comedy -- "something with a shipwreck,
and a dog" -- the author secretly crafts what he believes is a more honest 
story.  We see that the story's timeless appeal comes from the fact that
it's as unreal as his romantic comedies -- it's a melodrama about two
teenagers treating love the way teenagers do.  Will Shakespeare is styled
as the first Hollywood screenwriter, creating a love story not as it is,
but the all-consuming way we all want to belive it is.</P>
<P>     The Hollywood motif actually runs throughout SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and
provides its best laughs.  A money-lender (Tom Wilkinson) becomes a
production partner with debtor Henslowe, suggesting net profit
participation ("monkey points") as payment for the actors; later, a
riverboat driver drops Christopher Marlowe's name as a previous passenger,
and asks Will to read a script he has written; there's even a great piece
of business where Will coaxes a prima donna actor (Ben Affleck) into
taking a smaller role in "Romeo and Juliet" by telling him the play is
titled "Mercutio."  Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard (a writer who knows a
think or two about deconstructing the Bard from "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead") create a whip-smart script which drops
unapologetic anachronisms and fanciful historical revisionism into an
already buoyant romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     Considering how many things SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE tries, the
astonishing thing about it as that it nails every one of them.  As a
period piece, it captures the glorious squalor of chamberpots raining down
on pedestrians in 16th century London.  As an allegory, it captures the
appeal of the theatrical life for all its vanity and shady business
dealings.  As an actors' showcase, it gives splendid parts to splendid
performers, notably Paltrow, Rush and Judi Dench (as a breathtakingly
regal and insightful Queen Elizabeth).  And as a pure romance, it has all
the swoon appeal you could hope for in a tale of star-cross'd lovers.
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is the kind of story that first delights as an
exhilarating simple trifle, then only becomes better when you think about
its layers and its language.  It's almost -- dare one say it --
Shakespearean.</P>
<P>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 tragical-historical comedies:  10.</P>
