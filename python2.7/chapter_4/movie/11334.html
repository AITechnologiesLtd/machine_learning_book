<P>     For quite a while, DANGEROUS BEAUTY tempts you with an irresistable
combination of compelling substance in a glorious package...quite fitting,
considering the premise.  Based on Maragaret Rosenthal's fact-based "The
Honest Courtesan," it tells the story of Veronica Franco (BRAVEHEART's
Catherine McCormack), a young woman of humble means in 1583 Venice.  With
no dowry to offer, Veronic has little hope of ever being a suitable match
for her beloved Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), a gentleman of high station.
In fact, her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) offers that Veronica's only hope
of a good life which can support her family is to become a courtesan to
the powerful men of Venice.  Though she initially recoils at the idea,
Veronica soon finds herself one of the most desired women in venice,
sharing her bed with senators, kings, bishops...and yes, even the
now-married Marco.</P>
<P>     If you smell a tale of degradation and class warfare in the making,
sniff again.  DANGEROUS BEAUTY actually paints quite a rosy portrait of
Veronica's life while presenting an intriguing history lesson in gender
politics.  While the noble ladies of Venice were able to marry well, they
paid the price with their tongues and minds.  Denied education, property
or participation in public life, a good wife faced a lifetime of staying
home, bearing children and sitting quietly in a corner with her sewing.
Veronica, on the other hand, learns that a courtesan is expected to seduce
not just with her body, but with her mind as well.  She learns of history
and art, writes love poetry and interacts with men as they discuss the
issues of the day.  When the other option is mute insignificance,
prostitution suddenly seems considerably less cruel a fate.</P>
<P>     Director Marshall Herskovitz wraps this tale in enough style, romance
and humor that it's usually as entertaining as it is provocative.
Sumptuous production design renders 16th century Venice in romanticized
colors and dark interiors, accentuated by Lucianna Arrighi's marvelous
costumes.  The central pairing of Sewell and McCormack generates heat and
tension as the two characters negotiate the tricky parameters of their
relationship.  Then again, McCormack never hits a single false note in her
performance, her expressive face registering emotions ranging from
innocence to astonishment to wicked wit.  Her sense of liberation as she
achieves a level of equality a "lady" could never achieve anchors the
film's strongest scenes, including a battle of verse with Marco's cousin
Maffio (Oliver Platt) and an encounter with oblivious Venitian wives
forced to quiz her on the war in which their husbands are engaged.</P>
<P>     For well over three quarters of its running time, DANGEROUS BEAUTY is
an unqualified pleasure.  You can feel free to leave the theater when the
plague strikes fair Venice, because at that point it quickly degenerates
into thematic proclamations and over-wrought courtroom confrontations.  It
certainly doesn't help matters that the court in question is an
Inquisition court charging harlotry and witchcraft as the causes of the
plague, providing plenty of opportunity for right-thinking audience
members to cluck their tongues at religious hypocrisy and demagoguery.
After offering well over an hour of subversive notions cloaked in costume
drama, Jeannine Dominy's script plants Veronica on a soapbox for the
deliver of an I-am-Renaissance-woman-hear-me-roar manifesto, inspiring all
and sundry to leap to their feet in an "Oh Captain, my Captain" show of
solidarity.  Don't let those cheap theatrics wash the good taste of the
rest of DANGEROUS BEAUTY out of your mouth.  McCormack's radiant
performance and an unusual exploration of primitive feminism give it the
real punch its forced conclusion tries too hard to provide.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 courtesan sessions:  7.</PRE>
