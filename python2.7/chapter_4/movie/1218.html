<PRE>                     PRINCE OF TIDES/FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>PRINCE OF TIDES: sweeping movie with big themes and big-star romance</P>
<P>Plot/kickoff: Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), an ex-football player and English
teacher in South Carolina, goes off to New York City to help his sister
Savannah by telling her psychiatrist Dr.  Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand)
his family history.  Characters/acting:  Streisand is believable, though
I wonder if her character's actions were entirely ethical.  Nolte's best
role yet, though one scene seemed a little forced (maybe the script's
fault).  Fun appearance by George Carlin as Savannah's neighbor; Blythe
Danner plays Tom's wife, though she doesn't get to do too much (see
MR. & MRS. BRIDGE for her best); I also liked Lowenstein's surly teenager
as played by Jason Gould, Streisand's and Elliot Gould's son.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX:   Ahhh, the South.  Beautiful shots of coastal
Carolina that made me want to visit Charleston (my college town) again.</P>
<PRE>Score:  okay</PRE>
<P>Violence:  Not too gory, but there are some upsetting scenes</P>
<PRE>Language:  don't remember</PRE>
<P>Skin/situations:  oh, some kissing, bodies in bed, nothing new or wild</P>
<P>FRIED GREEN TOMATOES:  a warm, intimate tale of love between friends
past and present</P>
<P>Plot/kickoff:  a timid housewife (Kathy Bates) meets an old woman
(Jessica Tandy) at a nursing home in Alabama.  As the old woman recounts
stories about Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson), Ruth (Mary Louise Parker)
and other memorable characters from her past, we see the friendship
between the women in the present grow, and Bates' character undergo a
transformation.  Characters/acting:  Masterson was natural, true and
real, a rare performance that makes me want to see her other movies.  I
wish I knew more people like her character in real life.  Many fine
performances by those who played other minor characters of the past.
Tandy was enjoyable, and Bates was good for the most part (though I
thought her timidity at the start was a little forced)</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX:  Ahhh, the South.  Not lush like PRINCE OF TIDES, but
whoever shot this knows how to make you feel like you're right there
(and I don't mean just by using close-ups).  The rural Old South
sequences certainly seemed accurate.</P>
<PRE>Score:  Good, as far as I noticed.</PRE>
<P>Violence:  Some, upsetting, but not big-scale or bloody</P>
<PRE>Language:  Some profanity, not much</PRE>
<P>Skin/situations:  None, except maybe some implications</P>
<P>Analysis:  There are quite a few similarities between the two movies:  secrets
from the past revealed through a sequence of memories mixed in with interesting
goings-on in the present, a strong Southern element in both movies, a little
audience manipulation (not enough to spoil things), and some more I won't get
into, to avoid spoilers.  The difference is in tone.  PRINCE OF TIDES showed
how people can become whole by dealing with the past.  FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
showed people whose courage and strength came from having good friends to lean
on, laugh with, and fight for.  I recommend both - but my guess is I'll want to
see FRIED GREEN TOMATOES again sooner than PRINCE OF TIDES.</P>
