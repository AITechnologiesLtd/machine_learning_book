<P>Honolulu-based detective Charlie Chan (Oland) comes to the City of Light to go
after counterfeiters. He has been hired by a London bank to investigate
fraudulent bonds. He's greeted at the airport by a bum asking for a handout, and
the same bum is seen at the scene of later crimes. His act becomes a gimmicky
part of the mystery. In the taxi Charlie hails, a rock thrown breaks the taxi
window and the note attached warns Charlie to leave town. He's to meet his
associate, Nardi (Appleby), who is a cabaret dancer, and after her show he is to
get important info on the counterfeiters. </P>
<P>In his hotel, Charlie finds Number One Son, Lee (Luke), and tells him he's not
on a vacation but is working secretly on a delicate case. He then visits the
son,Victor (Beck), of the banking head he is working this case for. Victor's
working as a teller in the Lamartine Bank, as his father wishes he start at the
bottom. Victor's friends drop in for a social call: an artist Max Corday
(Rhodes), his girlfriend, and Victor's girlfriend Yvette (Brian). Max makes an
ethnic slur against Charlie and then apologizes by giving Charlie a sketch of
himself. They go to watch Nardi perform, and the same bum from the airport bumps
into Max outside the theater. When Nardi concludes her dance, the bum kills her
backstage by throwing a knife at her while she's on a couch. Before she dies,
she tells Charlie to search her apartment. There he finds a note saying Albert
Dufresne (Miljan) is spending more than what he makes in the bank on gambling. </P>
<P>Charlie visits the head of the Lamartine Bank and tells him about the
counterfeit bonds. Yvette also visits her father for money but while there,
Albert, her father's assistant and her ex-boyfriend, threatens to show Victor
her love letters. At night she returns to Albert's apartment to get the letters,
but the bum sneaked in through the balcony and kills Albert. She gets blamed for
the murder when he throws the gun into the room and she is holding the gun as
the police arrive. </P>
<P>The story unfolds like a routine Charlie Chan mystery, except the plot is
well-executed. There will be one more suspect, someone who works at the bank,
Latouche, who seems to have an uncalled for curiosity about Chan's
investigation. </P>
<P>A solid action episode, featuring a chase through the Paris sewers. It also gave
one a tourist's eye view of Paris, which was actually the back lot of the
studio. </P>
