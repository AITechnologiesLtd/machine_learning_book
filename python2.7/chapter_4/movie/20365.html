4 and a half stars</P>
<P>"The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain
interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can
hope to tackle." -- the late Stanley Kubrick.</P>
<P>For those of you who were looking forward to seeing two and half hours
of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman going at it like dogs, let me say this
right off the beat: this movie is _not_ a porn flick.  And, contrary to
some disgruntled viewers, the late Stanley Kubrick did not film it with
his eyes wide shut.</P>
<P>In the Kubrickan universe, where war, sexual satire, and even the
evolution of man have been explored, infidelity in marriage doesn't seem
like an important topic in comparison.  Or perhaps it's the most
important of all.  Whichever way to decide to interpret it,
perfectionist and ultra-reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's historic
last film - he passed away shortly after completing post-production - is
about intimacy, or a lack thereof.  It's a film that will be studied and
scrutinized, criticized and praised, liked and loved, hated and loathed;
but it shouldn't be underestimated.  Kubrick's beautiful use of visual
art and music is spectacular, and his assurance in himself is
unmistakable.  'Eyes Wide Shut' is a story told by a director who truly
knew how to tell it.</P>
<P>Allegations that Kubrick became a dirty and perverted man in the last
few years of his life are, I'm certain, very false. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is
no more unsanitary than the violence in 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Full
Metal Jacket,' the difference between these films, obviously, are their
genres.  It's true that 'Eyes Wide Shut' is intentionally a film that
has some sleazy moments, but Kubrick was never a director to take cheap
shots.  He slowly, quietly constructs his New York settings as the seedy
undercurrents of American culture, then abruptly and powerfully reminds
us that the true terror of the surroundings lie in the behavior of those
who inhabit them.  This all contributes to the film's itchy
physiological feel - 'Eyes Wide Shut' is dark and cynical, and
reverberates in your mind like a nightmare that never quite leaves you
alone.  Who would have thought that Stanley Kubrick would have ended his
career directing with almost Poe-like quality, reaching the inner
recesses of the human mind, and revealing just a few of the evils that
lie within.</P>
<P>Once again Kubrick endeavors to film the un-filmable.  It's no
coincidence that 'Eyes Wide Shut' boasts some of the most startling and
disquieting screen moments you're likely to see all year; also no
coincidence was the immense hype surrounding its release.  Kubrick
reportedly masterminded the film's advertising campaign, by revealing
small tidbits every now and then (including the much talked about mirror
scene), refusing to provide media outlets with a synopsis of the story,
and billing 'Eyes Wide Shut' as a Cruise/Kidman/Kubrick collaboration.</P>
<P>Tom Cruise, however, takes the spotlight for the majority of the film's
160-minute running time.  He plays Bill Harford and Kidman plays his
wife, Alice.  They are a wealthy New York couple, married nine years
with a daughter, and seemingly have it all.   That is, until one
peculiar night in which Bill prowls around the grim streets of New York,
encountering sexual temptation after sexual temptation, longing for a
release, or even a vague sense of joy.  Without going into much depth,
some of his journeying  - both literal and metaphorical - results in an
encounter with a hooker, an all-too-young looking teenager (played by
'Deep Impact's' Leelee Sobieski), and, of course, the invitation-only
orgy that everybody's been discussing ("Does Tom Cruise really wear a
dress?"  "Is it true that he molests a goat?")</P>
<P>No wonder everybody's been talking about it - it's quite a scene.  But
just labeling this and a couple of the film's other breathtaking moments
as "visually stunning" or "money shots," I fear, doesn't give them
justice.  The "orgy scene" has every actor in it wearing bizarre yet
strangely charismatic masks, the kind which would suit a screen
adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Masque of the Red Death' (in fact,
that is 'Dark City' director Alex Proyas' next film), if you're familiar
with it.  Kubrick's use of imagery, editing and a recurring and chilling
music score inflates the already absorbing atmosphere he creates.   As
we gaze at the screen, fixated into the world that Harford penetrates,
it is clear that we are under the spell of Kubrick's full-throttle
direction.</P>
<P>If the film's characters seem lost to you, that's because they are -
they're confused, insignificant people floating around dangerous worlds
that are obviously out of their league.  'Eyes Wide Shut' flows like a
dream, like reality, and like a dream of reality; Kubrick never makes it
clear what we, as an audience, should be looking for, if we should be
looking for anything at all.</P>
<P>Managing to keep a frowned face for most of the ordeal is Tom Cruise,
whose performance is as much about daily behavior as it is the
unpredictable circumstances that his character gets swept up in.  Only
Stanley Kubrick could have made Tom Cruise walking down a street look
interesting, and only Kubrick could have refused to cut to a different
location until he well and truly needed to.  Cruise is strong - perhaps
his strongest ever - as is Kidman, although her dialogue at times seems
just a little lengthy and abstract.  Arguably the world's most famous
couple, Cruise and Kidman this time refrain from using their charisma to
slap a grin on our faces; instead, they relied on Kubrick to see them
through.  No one needs to tell them that this was a safe bet.</P>
<P>Whilst the film's advertising hype was a great commercial ploy, it will
also draw to the cinema people who wouldn't have come otherwise, and
many of these - I suspect - will dislike and be frustrated by 'Eyes Wide
Shut,' due to its slow, quietly menacing pace.  Already, Internet
message boards and newsgroups have been plagued by comments from
disgruntled viewers; some of them have dubbed it 'Eyes Wide Shit,'
others have suggested that the Cruise/Kidman combination should be
replaced by Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra.  If you don't think that
'Eyes Wide Shut' will grab you, I suggest you don't see it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, why miss out on such an extraordinary film
experience?  I'm certain that many viewers will be quick to contact me,
and inform me of their dissatisfaction with the movie, but allow me to
propose something first: perhaps you've missed the point.  'Eyes Wide
Shut' is a thoroughly dissatisfying film, yes, but this is (here's that
word again) intentional.  It remains a captivating physiological
thriller that builds a creepy, unsettling momentum, and leaves you with
a bad taste in your mouth.</P>
<P>Even the film's very last line of dialogue is bound to leave you in your
seat - if only for a few moments longer than normal - as everything
before it suddenly takes on greater resonance.  For those of you who
want to see 'Eyes Wide Shut' for its depth, not its sex, or for its
content rather than its hype, the following warning is for you: it's
sometimes hard to watch a film seriously when everybody around you are
there purely to satisfy their curiosities.  Whether you like it or love
it, hate it or loathe it, one thing's for sure - you'll have never seen
anything quite like it.  Kubrick's last hurrah is, thankfully, another
masterstroke to add to the list of a man who was truly one of
Hollywood's most audacious filmmakers.</P>
