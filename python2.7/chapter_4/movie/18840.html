<PRE>"Effffff.   Ooooh.  Ecccckks."</PRE>
<P>        Another misleading theatrical trailor led me to believe that this
film would primarily be about the two main character's courtship via the
internet, with them finally meeting each other during the last five
minutes of the movie.  Meeting as in finally revealing their identities to
each other.  Tom Hanks's Joe Fox finding out that his online love is his real
life rival so early was as shocking to me as "Psycho's" Marion Crane dying
20 minutes or so into the movie.  Well, maybe I exaggerate, but to me this
is where "You've Got Mail" worked.  With clever writing, the Ephron
sisters shrewdly avoided having the movie turn into just another
"Sleepless In Seattle" clone.  This way, Joe gets a chance to find out
another side of Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan's) persona that she does not
reveal in cyberspace.  If he hadn't know the "shopgirl" side of Kathleen,
Joe would not have understood that Kathleen's biting words were just an
effort of defiance; if Joe's "NY152" alter-ego hadn't found out that
Kathleen IRL (In Real Life, in cyberspeak <g>) was such a charming, funny
woman, he might never have fallen in love with her completely.   Another
bonus is that we get acquainted with two sides of Joe Fox.  On one side we
get the ruthless millionaire who sees everyone and everything as
competition, who will stop at nothing to destroy his enemies; when we sit
down with Joe at the computer, we see someone trapped in a hopeless
relationship, someone who is sympathetic to the underdog.  One side he's
flippant, reckless; on the other he's honest, serious.  As much as we would
like to hate Joe Fox for his lack of mercy, as hard as it may be to
reconcile his two personalities, we have to: I do, since I too have a side of
myself that I despise.  This movie demonstrates the best possible outcome
of an internet romance -- when you know someone inside        *and* out.</P>
<P>        "You've Got Mail" is merry, seasonal, spiced up with a jazzy
soundtrack that puts you at once in a romantic mood.  Albeit slow at times
and filled with sidetrackers (for example, I had not expected them to
delve so much into Kathleen's faltering business; I have no complaints,
though, since one of my favorite scenes from the movie stems from this
storyline - the memory sequence of Kathleen dancing with her mother in
the store.  Amazing score here), the film is satisfying.  Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan get my vote as the cutest couple of the year, and though both are
wonderful in their roles, I'd have to say Tom wins my heart with his funny
mannerisms and expressions.  This guy *does* deserve two academy
awards (and another one coming next year?).  I also enjoyed Parker Posey
and Greg Kinnear's wickedly annoying performances as the ex-boyfriend
and ex-girlfriend.  With a whimsical script and a playful score, "You've
Got Mail" is the Very Hollywood feel-good answer to all the cynicism we
see in our country right now.  </P>

<PRE>Rating: B (First viewing, 12/18/98)</PRE>
<P>* Kudos for the lovely opening sequence.  The dark colors created a lonely,
impersonal atmosphere; yet cyberspace never looked so amiable.</P>
