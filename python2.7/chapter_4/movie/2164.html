<PRE>                                    MALICE
                       A film review by Vijay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1993 Vijay Ramanujan</PRE>
<P>Cast: Alec Baldwin; Nicole Kidman; Bill Pullman and appearances by
      George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft</P>
<P>Plot: There's a serial rapist/murderer running amok on campus, and Andy
Safien (Pullman) is the unfortunate Dean of Student Affairs who knows
all the victims.  Meanwhile, his wife has abdominal pains, and an
arrogant doctor he "knew" in high school moves into his house.  How does
it all tie in?</P>
<P>     Well, it doesn't.  Once in a while, you come across a movie so bad
that the writers should have their licenses revoked.  This is one of
those.  This movie was very well acted.  The individual scenes were well
scripted and directed, but the movie was incoherent.  For me to enjoy a
plot twist, I have to be grounded first, I have to have a frame of
reference with which to see the twists.  This movie was twisting so
often and so wildly that you never get a chance to see what it is
becoming or what it no longer is.  The basic problem with the movie
seems to have been this: The writers wrote half the movie, and then
decided, "Hey, what if ...?"  So they put some twist in.  They never
bothered to go back and see if it makes sense with the rest of the
movie.  Often times, it not only doesn't fit in, but it contradicts
things that have already been said and seen.  And the ending is so
predictable that it made me laugh.  In fact, there were at least three
high tension scenes in the movie during which the audience I saw it
with started laughing out loud. (One involving a big, climactic fight
between the hero and the villain.)  The highlight of the film was a man
in the third row screaming "Put that bitch in her place" when Baldwin
slapped Kidman.  Sad comment.</P>
<P>So, examples of those incoherencies that I said were so prevalent:</P>
<PRE>SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS</PRE>
<PRE>SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS
------------------------------</PRE>
<P>1) Tracy Safien has been seeing a doctor for two years about a serious
medical problem.  His husband has never even talked to the doctor, let
alone met with him.</P>
<P>2) Hill is willing to throw away a practice in Cardio-thorassic surgery
for five million dollars.  That is ridiculous when you consider how much
such surgeons make yearly.</P>
<P>3) The blind kid across the street definitely  makes an effort, early in
the movie, to stare out the window at the Safiens.  Why?</P>
<P>4) How did Tracy Safien know that the surgeon who would operate on her
would be Dr. Hill? Is there only one surgeon on duty? And why call a
Thorassic surgeon to do an operation on ovaries? Hardly his speciality.</P>
<P>5) Why spend thirty minutes on the serial rapist scenes when the only
apparent purpose of said scenes was to establish that Andy was sterile?</P>
<P>6) Jed and Tracy have to have been planning this from before Hill moved
in.  (I assume that's why she suggested taking in boarders.) So why does
she seem so nervous around Hill, as in the bathroom scene?</P>
<P>7) Lillianfield is a front for Hill, apparently.  At least, we are led to
believe so.  But how can Lillianfield practice? His speciality is not the
same as Hill's, and there is no way a doctor can "double major" without
anyone knowing.  And if Lillianfield doesn't have a legit practice, why
have an answering service?</P>
<PRE>And one minor blooper/problem:</PRE>
<P>1) Hill and others talk, in the bar, about how the starting tailback for
the team on the television is out after failing a drug test.  One person
asks why he can't stay off drugs for a million a year.  Unfortunately, the
team being shown is USC, and there are no million dollar college players
who undergo drug tests.</P>
<PRE>And others, but my time is running out, so I will leave you with these
few.</PRE>
<PRE>Overall, a poor excuse for a film, probably the worst movie of the
nineties, and maybe longer.
(A low) 1/4</PRE>
