<P>This review is adapted from my comments to the Internet Movie Database
(www.imdb.com) on November 13, 1998.</P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black" is well written, gently paced, very funny and very touching
with tremendous performances from Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani
and Brad Pitt.</P>
<P>Yes, I said Brad Pitt gave a tremendous performance as Death-Joe
Black/Young-Man-in-Coffee-Shop.  He plays the part of Death using Brad Pitt's
classic body as if he has never been in a human body before.   As an actor
playing this role, Brad Pitt chose to walk stiffly with virtually no mannerisms
as if he were a spirit (`Death') inhabiting an unknown organism (a human body).
I enjoyed watching him act out the consequences of this decision.  He is also
very funny throughout the movie acting in ways unlike any of the other
characters.  He especially stands out from the crowd in the boardroom scenes.
He is amazing in scenes with a hospital patient who has recognized him for what
he is.  I enjoyed his Jamaican accent.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as William Parish, head of Parrish
Communications.   Parrish finds out a few days before his 65th birthday that
Death will take him as soon as Death is done experiencing life on earth.  He
knows the penalty for arguing the Death-Joe Black is instant death,
and yet he stays true to himself to the end.   This is seemingly casual
performance by Hopkins is very strong.  His heart attack sequence early in
the movie is gut wrenching.  He is tender with his daughters, decisive with his
board of directors and mystified by his relationship with Death.</P>
<P>Claire Forlani is a find as Parrish's favorite daughter.  There is a cool,
reluctant and yet trusting chemistry between her character, Susan, and
Joe Black.  Their body language is enhanced by close camera work in tender, slow
moving, emotion-filled scenes.</P>
<P>The movie is long.  I looked forward to spending 174 minutes with Brad Pitt.
But I hated his last movie with Anthony Hopkins ("Legends of the Fall") so was
instantly wary when I heard about the running length.  Watching the film, I
loved the care the directory takes with each scene, each line of dialogue, each
nuanced use of the word "yes".  The script is excellent.  The ending was very
satisfying.  The film requires thought from the moviegoer.  Some folks may not
get the nuances, and may miss one of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins best movies.
I hereby nominate Claire Forlani for best supporting actress.</P>
<P>There was one thing I didn't like about the movie.   Brad Pitt's makeup looked
heavy and dark in several scenes, especially in the hospital.   I kept wondering
what was being covered up.</P>
<P>Summary:  9.5 on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).</P>
