<PRE>
The Object of My Affection, 1998</PRE>
<P>  Seen on 20 April 1998 for $8.75 with Tony at the Village East Cinema.</P>
<P>   Wendy Wasserstein's screenplay of *The Object of My Affection* has
   borne out good movie. It's based upon Stephen McCauley's novel of the same
   name--one of my all-time favorites. The two works are, however,
   mutually exclusive. George Hansen (Paul Rudd) and Nina Barowski
   (Jennifer Aniston) are introduced awkwardly at a dinner party, when
   George's lover Joley (Tim Daly) breaks up with George via Nina. George
   discovers they have broken up when Nina offers him a place to stay in
   her Brooklyn apartment. Luckily, they soon become fast friends and
   actually get along much better with each other than they do their
   respective mates.</P>
<P>   When Nina becomes pregnant by the overbearing Vince (John Pankow), she
   ultimately decides she would rather have George raise the baby with
   her. What ensues is a struggle for George--wanting some form of
   fatherhood or a life of his own. Some people might object to the theme
   of the woman who goes over the unobtainable man because it's safer
   than facing her own issues (a la My Best Friend's Wedding). But, Nina
   comes to her own conclusions, and finds a way to be happy. There is
   also the overused device of ending the film in the future, and
   equalizing all the characters with fairy-tale happy endings. Expecting
   the movie to be completely awful, based on advance press and</P>
<P>   Wendy Wasserstein's admission that the George character was "a lump"
   and that she decided to play up the Nina story more, I was pleasantly
   surprised. Wasserstein's screenplay is both funny and touching, and
   the performances by Rudd and Aniston save this film from being a
   complete flop. In fact, Aniston's performance here alone was enough to
   win me as a fan. She's quite endearing.</P>
<P>   The supporting cast is also good: Tim Daly excels as the narcissistic
   Joley; Allison Janney as Nina's stepsister Connie and Alan Alda as
   Connie's husband do not overdo their comic roles. In fact, this is one
   of the first times I have not wanted to see Ald a shot to death on
   film (which he finally was in Murder at 1600). Nigel Hawthorne plays
   the older drama critic who points out to Nina, "What happens when all
   these homosexual men at your dinner table leave you for other men?"
   It's a nice change from the "lonely gay man" image.</P>
<P>   The weakest member of the cast is Amo Gulinello as Paul. It's hard to
   see why he and George get together and fall in love. It's pretty clear
   that he is only there to accentuate to Nina that George might not be
   hopeless devoted to her for long, as she grows very jealous.</P>
<P>   One frustration with this adaptation is that George was meant to be a
   lump--not a stud. There is little of MacCauley's sensibilities left in
   this story. Paul Rudd is one of the cutest actors alive, and he can
   also act. It's not difficult to see why both men and women would want
   to rope him in. He is actually cuter than most of the men Nina goes
   out with; why wouldn't she fall for him? It might have been more
   poignant of she fell for a man who was both gay and not absolutely
   stunning; Paul Rudd is the latter.</P>
<P>   Some of the best scenes are the ones in which Nina and George take
   dancing lessons. It showed both their growing fondness for one
   another, as well the passing seasons. Unfortunately, an otherwise
   funny and touching movie experience is marred by two very poor editing
   mistakes. One occurs when George and Paul go swimming, and the other
   is when we finally see Nina's baby born. It is obvious some
   last-minute editing was going on, and there is no excuse for such
   blunder in this day and age.</P>
<P>   Bottom line: If you feel you must choose, read the book. You will
   probably laugh a lot more at the self-deprecating humor of George.</P>
