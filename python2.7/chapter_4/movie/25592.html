Grade:  B+</PRE>
<P>For the uninitiated:  The X-Men are superheroes who are mutants.  Mutants, 
according to Marvel Comics, are born with a genetic change which makes them a 
different species and gives each mutant a unique superpower that is 
manifested during puberty.  Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) formed 
the X-Men to combat evil mutants and founded a School for Gifted Youngsters 
so that teenage mutants would have a place to hang.  Xavier's philosophical 
opposite is Magneto (Ian McKellen), a militant mutant leader who wants to use 
force to make a place for mutants in the world.</P>
<P>The X-Men were introduced in the comic books in 1963 and revived with a new 
membership in 1975.  The new team prospered and soon became the most popular 
comic book in America.  Over the last twenty years, Marvel has spun-off 
numerous titles and introduced dozens of mutant heroes and villains.</P>
<P>In adapting the comics to a movie, the filmmakers had to pare down the 
comic-book cast to the most popular characters.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has 
an indestructible metal skeleton, sharp metal claws, the ability to heal 
nearly any wound, feral senses, and a disagreeable disposition.  Rogue (Anna 
Paquin) sucks the life-force out of people with her touch.  Cyclops (James 
Marsden) shoots laser beams out of his eyes.  Storm (Halle Berry) controls 
the weather.  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) moves objects with her mind, and 
Prof. X is a telepath.</P>
<P>The X-Men's arch-enemy, Magneto, emits magnetism.  His Brotherhood is a 
hodge-podge of popular villains from the comic books.  Sabretooth (Tyler 
Mane) is a furry beast-man.  Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) shifts shape, 
and the wall-crawling Toad (Ray Park) licks people from hundreds of feet away.</P>
<P>Here's the plot:  Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) is proposing 
legislation to register all mutants because he sees them as a threat to 
normal folks.  This brings to a head the ongoing feud between Prof. X and 
Magneto (Ian McKellen)  While that's brewing, teenager Rogue discovers her 
mutant powers and darts off toward Alaska.  In a seedy bar in the frozen 
north, she meets Wolverine.  They hang together long enough to introduce 
Wolvie's various attributes before Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) crashes the party, 
trying to recruit Rogue and Wolverine for the Brotherhood.  However, Cyclops 
and Storm end up taking home the beleaguered pair.  But Magneto isn't done 
with them yet . . .</P>
<P>Although many cranky X-Fans will be lamenting, "But what about [name of fave 
mutant here]?," six heroes, four villains, and a senator are a lot of 
characters for one movie.  Consider how bloated "Batman and Robin" was with 
only three heroes, three villains, and a butler.  It's easy to see why movies 
about superhero teams are even more rare than comic-book movies in general.  
There just isn't enough time to introduce and develop all those characters in 
the downtime between slugfests.  The solution that director Bryan Singer and 
screenwriter David Hayter come up with is brilliant; they focus on Wolverine 
and Rogue and sketch out the rest of the characters only as much as needed.  
Not only does that trim down the amount of exposition needed, but it also 
allows the audience to come to the X-Men from the perspective of a bewildered 
outsider.</P>
<P>The script does miss a few beats, though.  Magneto has this big evil machine 
that somehow works off of his magnetic powers, but no one ever really 
explains how it does.  The last scene confused me completely, but I can't 
really do into it without giving away the end.  Some of the humor works 
wonderfully (particularly the taunts between Wolverine and Cyclops), but 
other lines fall miserably flat.</P>
<P>Despite its flaws, "X-Men" is the first Marvel Comics movie to approximate 
the thrills of the comic book without stumbling into campiness.  Hayter's 
script incorporates crucial X-Themes.  As in the comics, mutants are a 
metaphor for any oppressed minority, allowing for blanket commentary on the 
politics of fear and hatred that use minorities to threaten the majority.  
Another common Marvel theme:  superpowers are more a curse than a blessing.  
This is particularly true for Rogue, who is a troubled teen terrified by her 
own powers.</P>
<P>"X-Men" is visually impressive.  The special effects are amazingly lifelike 
and include Toad's long-distance licking, Mystique's morphing, and Wolvie's 
claw-popping.  Some of the sets were rather bland (Prof. X has a thing for 
stainless steel walls) while others were quite inventive.  I wish the black 
leather uniforms were more colorful.</P>
<P>The cast is lead by two Shakespearean actors, Stewart and McKellen, and their 
resonant voices enriched their parts.  I wish that the script had given 
McKellen more meat to chew, but despite an early scene where we see young 
Magneto's mother dragged away to die in the Nazi gas chambers Magneto seems 
to be the standard badguy-bent-on-world-domination.  The bulk of the acting 
challenges went to Jackman and Paquin, and they both did fine jobs.  
Jackman's Wolverine is younger and less hard-boiled than his four-color 
counterpart, but Jackman gives us a well-rounded character who is sympathetic 
and likeable in spite of his gruff manner.  Oscar-winner Paquin is also in 
fine form and makes Rogue a teenage misfit we can all identify with.</P>
<P>Any movie version of something that has an insular cult following has to pull 
off the difficult task of appealing to both the faithful and the general 
public.  Singer aims for a middle ground between the two.  If you stand 
outside a theater showing "X-Men," you'll hear the True Believers exiting in 
heated discussion of how many things were changed.  I found it more fun to 
focus on how much the filmmakers retained:  Wolverine's adamantium skeleton 
and amnesia, the way Storm's eyes go white when she uses her powers, the 
Blackbird jet, even the street address of Xavier's School.   And what about 
all those moviegoers who don't know a mutant from a muskrat?  As I watched, I 
tried to imagine how I would react to this movie if I had never read an X-Men 
comic book.  I concluded that I might suffer from information overload and 
have a hard time following parts of the movie.  "X-Men" may prove a hard sell 
to the average popcorn-cruncher.</P>
<P>I had a great time, though.  I hope the effort proves successful and spawns 
sequels and imitations of the same high quality.  (The cast of "X-Men" are 
signed for two more pictures, so there's a likelihood of a trilogy if this 
one doesn't tank.)  </P>
<PRE>Bottom Line:  Better than I X-pected</PRE>
