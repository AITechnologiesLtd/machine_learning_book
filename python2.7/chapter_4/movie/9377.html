JUDGMENT NIGHT
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1993) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This is one of those movies that's not all good, all bad or 
all mediocre, it just trades off between the three. There are parts in 
JUDGMENT NIGHT that achieve real tension, real action and real 
dialogue, almost equally matched by the scenes that don't. I don't 
know if there's another movie I've reviewed that I have on tape, have 
watched multiple times and love the cast of but still don't really like. 
Maybe JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY and AIRPLANE 2: THE SEQUEL, 
but those are comedies.</P>
<P>        JUDGEMENT NIGHT is an action flick built around the 
mistrust between economic classes and the common fear of being 
surrounded by people but still being completely without help. It also 
features another common fear -- Emilio Estevez. If you've read some 
of my other reviews, you know I never considered him one of the best 
of the '80s, which prompted one person to e-mail me with the 
question, "Do you have a problem with Emilio Estevez, or just his 
films?"</P>
<P>        No, I don't have a problem with him, although from the way 
he's disappeared from the movie scene, Hollywood seems to. He's not a 
terrific actor but he's likeable, even if he did usually pick weak scripts. 
It's only in JUDGMENT NIGHT that he's called on to carry a movie 
almost entirely by himself and, I have to say, as an action hero, he's 
not. He kind of walks through the movie, and it's only by time that 
JUDGMENT NIGHT is now better viewed as an ensemble work rather 
than an Estevez vehicle.</P>
<P>        Estevez, as the ex-wild guy now domesticated, is the main 
character, but his three friends are much more interesting. There's 
Cuba Gooding Jr. who, as written, is just generic and ambiguous (and 
probably his only performance where race isn't mentioned at all), but 
his own charisma lights up the movie. Jeremy Piven is the unlikable 
friend, the superficial wheeler-dealer who thinks he can get what he 
wants, and Stephen Dorff plays Estevez's younger brother with 
impulsivity control problems. None of the characters are terribly 
original, but in all four cases, the actors provide the appeal.</P>
<P>        This goes double for the movie's villain, played by Denis 
Leary. In other hands, the character would have been a run-of-the-mill 
action movie villain. Here, it's a run-of-the-mill action movie villain 
played by Denis Leary, which means a lot of sarcastic rants. He comes 
off as a disgruntled, gun-wielding stand-up comic and, although it 
makes him and his gang bangers (including the House of Pain guy) 
seem much less threatening, it makes the movie that much more 
watchable. This is why, and Hollywood executives should take note of 
this, Leary is always better as the likeable heavy than as the unlikeable 
protagonist. That's one of the reasons TWO IF BY SEA sucked so hard.</P>
<P>        The premise is a simple one -- the four friends are soft, 
middle-class twentysomethings who head into the city for a boxing 
match and end up in a horrible neighborhood, watching Leary pop 
Michael de Lorenzo. Leary chases them for the next 80 minutes or so, 
through four long set pieces. First is the railyard, followed by the 
housing project, the sewer system and the empty department store. 
All of this is fairly routine and predictable, and that's why I almost 
hate this movie, but every time you're reading to hit the fast forward 
button, one of these actors will do something to remind you they're the 
ones getting the big bucks. That's why I almost like this movie.</P>
