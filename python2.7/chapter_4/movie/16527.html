REVIEW:        PLAYING BY HEART</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        (in Alphabetical order) Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, 
                Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie,
                Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands,
                Jon Stewart, Madeleine Stowe</PRE>
<PRE>Written and
Directed by:        Willard Carroll</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>Playing by Heart has something for everyone.  There's a love story for
just about every age of viewer.   Unfortunately, that's also its main
drawback.  If you identify with one couple, you'll probably be bored or
upset by another one of the stories.  It does show how much the problems
facing lovers have changed.  The oldest couple, played by Sean Connery and
Gena Rowlands, fell in love and grew older without the issues facing the
younger lovers.   Their main concern centers on a possible affair that he
may have had numerous years before.    Most of the younger couples must
face AIDS or homosexuality, all too prevalent in today's society.  </P>
<P>Remarks have been made that the dialogue wasn't real; that no one really
speaks that way.   Strange because Connery and Rowlands spoke just like my
husband and I speak.  In fact, there is at least one `joke' that we
created over 40 years ago and have used often every since.  It is when
Sean says that "he never knew what true happiness was until he got
married….then it was too late!'</P>
<P>As to the younger couples, I couldn't help wonder what some of them saw
in each other.  Angelina Jolie (Jon Voight's daughter) stands out as a
free spirited, fun-loving club-goer.  Her initial attraction to Ryan
Phillippe seems odd.  He seems like such a loser that I questioned whether
she would have given him a second glance.  As she got to know him, he does
become more loveable.</P>
<P>The most desirable of the guys has to be Jon Stewart.  Again, I wonder
what he saw in Gillian Anderson enough to endure the pangs of the courting
process.  Randy Quaid's role is bizarre and seems a strange choice for
him.  Anthony Edwards' scenes are mostly in bed or the bedroom, and he
isn't all that likeable.  There's not enough nudity or sex scenes to
disturb anyone.</P>
<P>A different type of love story is the one between Ellen Burstyn and Jay
Mohr as a mother and son.  It is filled with memorable moments.  The
`game' that they play might be beneficial to a lot of people who are
hiding deep dark secrets in their lives.</P>
<P>It's not a great movie.  It's not a bad movie.  I wouldn't mind seeing it
again, but I'll probably wait until it's on free TV.  I give it a B-.</P>
