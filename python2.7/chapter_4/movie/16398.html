<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>Steven Spielberg, the so-called Peter Pan of cinema, was thought to have
reached the pinnacle of his filmmaking career with Schindler's List, his
docudrama of the Nazi Holocaust. Critics declared that he had finally
grown up. Saving Private Ryan, his brutal examination of another aspect
of The Last Great War, solidifies this declaration once and for all.</P>
<P>After a brief modern-day prologue,Spielberg takes us to the open holding
area of a seaborne landing craft, where we are huddled with a group of
American troops. A closer look at these men reveals that most are young,
barely out of their teens. An air of dread hangs over all of them as
they sit there hoping for the best, expecting the worst. Those who
aren't vomiting look like they are a boat-rock away from doing so. Our
heartbeats quicken pace along with theirs as the announcement is made
that they will be exiting the craft momentarily. And once the landing
ramp opens on Omaha Beach, the worst hell ever filmed begins and does
not end for twenty-four nerve-jangling minutes.</P>
<P>Never before has the terror of war been depicted so graphically, and
never before has the
boundary between cinema and reality been dissolved so cleanly as in
these opening
moments. The sounds and sights bombard us with a jackhammer frenzy, and
try as we
might, we cannot stop ourselves from the urge to duck our heads. The
blood and guts are
terrifying, but not as terrifying as the reactions of these soldiers --
some of whom we saw in detailed close-up just before the invasion -- to
the surrounding carnage. What would you do if one moment, you were
talking to the guy next to you, and the next moment, his head looked
like an exploded watermelon?</P>
<P>Tom Hanks is introduced in this opening sequence as Captain John Miller,
whose ability to
lead under the toughest of circumstances is put to the test as he and
his men storm the
German opposition's bunkers. After the threat is neutralized and the
battle won, Miller
receives new orders from higher-ups on the military chain: to find and
retrieve a Private
James F. Ryan. The reason? Three of the four Ryan brothers have been
killed within the
past week, and the U.S. government will be damned if it will let another
death notice be sent to their mother. Seven additional men are assembled
to help carry out the mission, including The Brothers McMullen's Edward
Burns and Heat's Tom Sizemore. Giovanni Ribisi does an effective turn as
the crew's medic, as does Barry Pepper as their crucifix-kissing,
cool-headed marksman. Adam Goldberg and Vin Deisel (actor/director of
1997's Sundance entry Strays) make their own memorable contributions to
the company. The odd-man-out of the bunch is Jeremy Davies' (Twister)
Corporal Upham, whose inexperience in combat is reluctantly ignored by
Miller because of his fluency in German. As the film progresses, the
uninitiated Upham comes to represent the lost innocence of his fellow
soldiers, and by the end, we know how the others got to be the way they
are.</P>
<P>Many war movies have suffered from fundamental flaws in
characterization. The soldiers are usually drawn in two ways: as
vengeful, heroic adventurers or as weeping boys who are so scared all
the time you'd wonder how the hell they made it through boot camp let
alone through a single battle. The soldiers in Saving Private Ryan are
presented as real people whose anger and fear can constantly be seen
lurking just below the surface, even as they perform such heroic acts as
throwing bombs at a tank or firing on the enemy from the safety of a
bell tower. Anger, fear, and even relief drive the eight travelers to do
what they do. They are boys, yes, but the horror of war has clearly
hardened the skin on the outside. Only in the dead of night, when they
are in the safety of darkness and seclusion, do the soldiers' pent-up
longings for home come through.</P>
<P>The search for Private Ryan moves the story along as Miller and his men
traverse the
French landscape. Janusz Kaminsky's beautiful but inobtrusive camera
work is
showcased throughout their harrowing journey. Several shots illustrate
how unfortunate it
was that the American soldiers had to experience the grandeur of rural
France with a rifle
rather than a camera on their shoulders. Even the images of bombed-out
towns suggest the beauty which was once there.</P>
<P>Spielberg remains for the most part invisible in the film, but even in
the few moments when
his touch is apparent, it does not push the audience away. Take for
example, a sequence
where an approaching line of German tanks approaches heard but not seen.
The effect is
just as canny as the approaching T. Rex in Jurassic Park, and even more
scary. And the
tour de force action climax shows that his training as conductor of
films like Raiders of the
Lost Ark and Jaws has been put to good use. Everything Spielberg has
learned and
perfected over his 25+ year career as a professional filmmaker has
culminated in this, one
of the most viscerally engaging movies ever made.</P>
<P>The script, a truth-inspired work of fiction by Robert Rodat, is
well-paced and logically
sequenced. There are no clear resolutions or fully-bared souls, a fact
which may frustrate
audiences at first. One must realize that Hollywood has accustomed us to
distinct
morals--solutions real life are never so pat. When Miller and his boys
find the lost private
and don't get what they expect, they don't flip out or get angry.
Rather, they are
understanding, and the reason for their understanding is subtly revealed
in their subsequent
interactions with Ryan. Audiences may at first be put off by the
blandness of Private Ryan's character, but the film's finale drives home
the point that it does not matter that his character was so thinly
portrayed. The point is that he was a man, and that his life was just as
important as all those around him.</P>
<P>The emotions in the film are neither forced nor manipulated. There is
one wrenching
moment halfway through the film where the usually opaque Captain Miller
steals away and
sobs. It is an easy thing to make a filmgoer feel the pain of a gunshot.
It is not quite so easy to make someone empathize with a soldier's
dismay at the realization of what kind of
person he has become. Saving Private Ryan succeeds at both of these. It
is a testament to
Ryan's power that, even days after watching it, the film continues to
haunt. Who will ever be able to forget the image of a disoriented
soldier stooping down to pick up and carry away his severed arm? Think
of it: images like these have haunted WWII veterans for the last 53
years.</P>
