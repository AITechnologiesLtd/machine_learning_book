<PRE>                            ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS
                       A film review by Marc Y. Wasserman
                        Copyright 1993 Marc Y. Wasserman</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  D-, 1 star out of four.</PRE>
<P>     ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS is another Mel-Brooks-produced film in
the classic tradition of movies like BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG
FRANKENSTEIN.  Mel Brooks is well known for his comic look at regular
life, his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS has none of the easy
going humor of BLAZING SADDLES, none of the fun acting of YOUNG
FRANKENSTEIN, is devoid of the charm of SPACEBALLS, and is even lacking
the good, solid dialogue of HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  It is, in short, one
of the worst movies I have seen Mel Brooks, or anybody else, produce.</P>
<P>     The plot borrows heavily from the well-received Kevin Costner
movie of last year, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES.  This is not
surprising in and of itself, and could have been used to great comic
effect, mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie.  Mel Brooks
does not take advantage of this, however, and uses the film to launch
several ideas into the air, none of which connect and none of which are
explained later on.  The movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any
order and one would be hard pressed to notice.</P>
<P>     Cary Elwes, of PRINCESS BRIDE fame, plays Robin of Loxley, a man
who was captured in the Crusades, fighting with King Richard.  He
escapes and, joining with a man named Achoo (I am sure you can see the
obvious joke), fights in England to reclaim his name and the throne for
Richard, which has been captured by evil Prince John, played by funny
comic Richard Lewis.  He also tries for the love of Maid Marian and
attempts to overthrow the evil "Sheriff of Rottingham".  A good
adventure plot that is sadly unused.</P>
<P>     Elwes and Lewis are both excellent comics, but the dialogue in the
movie is simply excruciating.  Neither actor has any good words to work
with, and the lines simply aren't funny, nor believable.  Perhaps the
worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man
playing a Macaulay Culkin clone from the hit movie HOME ALONE.  This
particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted, and followed by
so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas, that I really felt like
leaving the theatre.  Much of the audience continued to look at their
watches throughout, and some left the theatre.  Chuckles were few and
far between, and they mostly dealt with visual jokes (such as an old,
beaten up horse from "Rent-a-Wreck") then from any dialogue
whatsoever.  Scenes that could have been classics, such as the archery
contest, are ruined by poor acting.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply
offensive.  The basic plot, that Robin has received a key that will
unlock the chastity belt of Maid Marian, is not witty nor funny.  Mel
Brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and
others in the audience (not all Jewish, either).  The movie simply
tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails.  The addition
of a blind man who stumbles around, falling off cliffs, walking into
ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous
potential, but is also made terribly offensive.</P>
<P>     The only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end
who plays King Richard.  He is well worth waiting for, if you can stand
an hour and half of unfunny dialogue, excruciating visual humor, old
puns, ancient jokes and bad acting.  If you can't, don't even bother
watching this miserable film.</P>
