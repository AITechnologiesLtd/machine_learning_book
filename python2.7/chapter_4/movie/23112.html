<P>Year: 1999.

Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, George Carlin.
Written by Kevin Smith.
Directed by Kevin Smith.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Kevin Smith's "Dogma" shows that the young director of "Clerks" and "Chasing
Amy"  has learned to make a big-budget movie without turning it into the
overstuffed turkey "Mallrats" was. This film is, for the most part, a fun,
thoughtful romp through the Catholic religion. It's clever and funny while
asking some very worthwhile questions about what the church has become.
Rather than being a condemnation of religion, as some advocates have
claimed, it is really more of a devout meditation on this filmmaker's own
beliefs, ones that are probably shared by a great many Catholics. It's not
perfect, and Smith's indulgences get in the way of the narrative (such as it
is) too often, suggesting he hasn't completely mastered his use of a bigger
budget, but it's still a funny, entertaining experience. "Dogma" is humorous
and thoughtful at the same time, something that is rare in a film from a
filmmaker as young as Smith, but very welcome.</P>
<P>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon star as Bartleby and Loki, two renegade angels
trying to get back into heaven through a loophole opened up by the Catholic
Church. Because of a doctrine passed down by Cardinal Glick (George Carlin),
they find that they simply need to pass through the doors of a church in New
Jersey in order to be absolved of all wrongdoing. Unfortunately, since this
will prove God fallible, it will result in the universe being blinked out of
existence. To stop Bart and Larry, a messenger angel (Alan Rickman) who acts
as the voice of God enlists Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a Catholic abortion
clinic worker having a crisis of faith. Along to help her are Jay and Silent
Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) as unlikely prophets, Rufus the 13th
Apostle (Chris Rock), who was left out of the Bible because he was black,
and Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse who has taken human form, only to be
stricken with writer's block. Further complicating matters is Azrael (Jason
Lee), a demon with his own agenda who is actively trying to help the angels
and hinder the good guys.</P>
<P>Kevin Smith's best talent is as a writer, as the dialogue-driven "Clerks"
and "Chasing Amy" proved. In "Dogma," his fourth effort, Smith begins to
show some signs of growth as a director. He has begun making use of camera
movement and including action taking place behind the focus of the scene.
Smith has always been rather lackluster cameraman (by his own admission),
and his visual style is still mostly of the "talking-heads" variety, but he
shows a little more visual flair here than he has in previous films.</P>
<P>As always, when he concentrates on writing conversations, Smith tinges them
with just the right amount of wit to get his point across without becoming
preachy. His script is a little disjointed, with too much expository
dialogue, but it still contains enough worthwhile moments to overlook its
flaws. Smith does a good job of alternating between smart satire and the
"poop jokes" his audience has become used to. There are several priceless
bits, the standout being George Carlin's "Catholicism WOW!" program, in
which his Cardinal Glick announces that he will replace the "depressing"
crucifix symbol with the more jovial "Buddy Christ." Smith's idea of a Jesus
for the 90's is flat-out hilarious. Chris Rock has some good moments,
especially during his explanation of why his apostle was left out of the
Bible. Some other inspired bits have Matt Damon talking a nun out of
Catholicism and an unusual (to say the least) casting choice in the role of
God. Smith has a fine pop-culture sensibility, including references to
everything from "Sixteen Candles" to "Indiana Jones." Most of them work.</P>
<P>The performances in "Dogma" are varied. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have the
same chummy chemistry they exhibited in "Good Will Hunting." Linda
Fiorentino is passable as Bethany, but she's hampered by a lack of emotional
range and Smith's obvious discomfort with dramatic scenes. Her one "big"
emotional moment comes off like an excuse to get her into a wet shirt, and I
'm still wondering if anybody in the real world has ever actually uttered
the sentence, "I'm physically and psychologically exhausted." Chris Rock and
Alan Rickman have plenty of good moments, the latter delivering all his
lines with delicious sarcasm. Jason Lee (who seems to Kevin Smith what
Samuel L. Jackson is to Tarantino) continues to impress as a solid
supporting actor, taking the role of the heavy with devilish glee (please
excuse the bad pun). Salma Hayek has yet to prove to me that she's more than
a pretty face, while George Carlin's scenes are all wonderfully inspired
("The Catholic Church does not make mistakes!"). Jay and Silent Bob, the
recurring characters of Smith's filmography, get a much larger slice of
screen time here, and their Mutt-and-Jeff antics keep the film continually
lively, even when it gets bogged down in exposition. Jay's stoner quips are
consistently funny (that is, if you aren't offended by constant use of the
F-word) and Silent Bob's facial expressions never cease to amuse me.</P>
<P>Where "Dogma" really runs into problems is in its story. Smith may be
proficient at writing witty dialogue and one-liners, but he still has yet to
understand good pacing. One of the reasons I think "Clerks" is still his
best movie is that he didn't bother with a story, just piecing together
scenes from a day in the life of a convenience store clerk. Here, he's got
an action movie plot as a vehicle for his discussions of Catholic dogma as a
vehicle for throwaway jokes and gags. Very often, the story gets lost in the
shenanigans. What "Dogma" needed after its fast start was a quick wrap-up.
Unfortunately, we get a long, drawn-out climax that takes far too long to
dispatch of the many characters it has introduced and is soiled by far too
much violence (a shame, since some of Smith's better jokes come in the final
sequence). This is a clear example of Smith getting too caught up in his
comic book indulgences, though the most egregious example happens when he
has a monster composed entirely of human feces threaten our heroes, only to
have him taken care of in a ridiculously conventional manner. I don't know
why he decided to leave this scene in, other than the obvious reason that it
cost quite a bit of money to produce. Smith needs to learn restraint before
he can be considered a "great" filmmaker. I do give him credit for trying,
though, because I see some signs of improvement here. He definitely didn't
indulge himself as much as he did in "Mallrats" (his other big-budget
production), which was a lifeless mess, save for Jason Lee's performance. If
he keeps on track, he should have a good grasp on what it takes to make a
complete motion picture.</P>
<P>"Dogma" is far from a perfect film, but it's nevertheless a worthwhile
experience, and sure to please fans of the director. (Note to Smith
devotees: Look for cameos by the two original stars of "Clerks," Brian O'
Halloran and Jeff Anderson.) Smith is a filmmaker with his own voice, and as
a practicing Catholic, he has clearly made a work that comes from the heart.
His discussion of Catholicism is intriguing, often exhausting, and always
honest, while his trademark wit remains firmly intact. Smith is a writer and
novice director who is clearly still learning his trade, but he is also
showing improvement. He has the pop-culture sensibility of Quentin Tarantino
and the scattershot politics of Spike Lee. If he keeps this up, he could
make some truly great movies in the future. "Dogma" is merely a good one.</P>
