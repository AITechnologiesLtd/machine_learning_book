<PRE>                             BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
                       A film review by Lewis C. E. Butler
                        Copyright 1992 Lewis C. E. Butler</PRE>
<PRE>In short:
        DRACULA, the newest offering from Francis Ford Coppola, is not
        all that it sets out to be.  While reaching for greatness it
        fails to attain anything better than mediocrity.  There are some
        wonderful performances on the part of Oldman and Hopkins, but
        overall, though enjoyable, it fails. (+1 of -4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Francis Ford Coppola has once again taken on the task of making a
movie from a classic book.  Where before he created a remarkable film
(APOCALYPSE NOW from HEART OF DARKNESS) this time he has not done quite
so well.  Bram  Stoker's novel is a chilling Gothic horror, recommended
reading for everyone.  What Coppola has done is remove the element of
horror from the story and transform it into a love story.</P>
<P>     Strangely enough, in terms of plot, this version follows the book
far closer than any Dracula movie I've seen.  There are some remarkable
inconsistencies, and the film feels as if it was not quite ready for
release.  The editing is choppy, there are incongruous scenes and scene
changes, and the occasional voice over.  These details add up to a
fairly steady diet of distractions.</P>
<P>     Oldman is a wonderfully powerful vampire.  His performance manages
to bring a certain sympathy, much as Karloff's Frankenstein's monster
did.  Dracula is not evil in this film, just misunderstood.  Perhaps
this film reflects our times in the belief that no one is evil, and no
one beyond redemption.  Interstingly enough, Oldman's undead Dracula
seems to be most alive of all the main characters, with the possible
exception of Hopkins' Van Helsing.</P>
<P>     Winona Ryder is disappointing.  Her performance is not poor, but
it is uninspired.  Though her character seems to be broiling in inner
turmoil, we know of it only through her diary.  The character of Lucy
was far better drawn by Sadie Frost.</P>
<P>     Keanu Reeves is just dreadful.  He is completely dull, and seems to
be walking through the role from start to finish.  By far the worst
performance in the movie.  I am quite disappointed, as I like Reeves,
but it is quite obvious that this role was far beyond his meager
abilities.</P>
<P>     Hopkins turns in an inspired performance as the good doctor, Van
Helsing.  He and Oldman make the film worth seeing.  He manages to be
humorous without quite crossing into something incongruous.  If you are
as impressed with Hopkins as I am, though, THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT allows
him a little more time on screen.</P>
<P>     Tom Waits (the singer?) plays Renfield, and does an amazing job
with him.  It's a shame he wasn't cast as Jonathan Harker instead of
Reeves; I'm quite sure he would have done a much better job.</P>
<P>     The problem with Dracula isn't so much the actors though, it is
that it does not quite work as a love story.  Perhaps it is a failing on
the part of Ms.  Ryder, but I believe it was more a problem with the
script.  The effects are very good (especially the shadows, which never
seem to be in sync with the Count) but still there is something missing.
If Coppola wanted to make a love story, he should have taken a hint from
the makers of GHOST and made us *believe*.</P>
<P>     Still, with all its problems, Dracula does have something going
for it.  Coppola's hand is evident throughout, and Oldman's performance
is compelling enough that I have no doubts the movie will be successful.
Come Oscar time, though, and Oldman is the only one deserving of any
recognition, though I wouldn't be surprised to see a nomination for
Hopkins anyway.  Of course I am not including the effects work, which
certainly deserves some accolades.  Oldman's makeup artists does some
amazing things, but in terms of major recognition, Gary Oldman is the
only actor who might deserve a nomination.</P>
<PRE>     See it at a matinee for cheap.</PRE>
