<PRE>BOYS AND GIRLS
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>Boys and Girls plays like a college version of When Harry Met Sally,
with just as much fun and fewer contrivances.  Here, the key couple is
Ryan and Jennifer, who meet by chance on a plane as pre-teens, and
continually bump into one another until their lives bisect at
Cal-Berkeley.  Ryan, played by Flavor of the Moment Freddie Prinze, Jr.,
is a bright, sometimes awkward engineering student who loves planning
and order; Jennifer, Meet Joe Black's Claire Forlani, majors in Latin
for no particular reason and aims to travel.  Both wish they could apply
their positive personality traits to their floundering relationships,
but it just doesn't work.</P>
<P>The smart script for Boys and Girls, written by the humbly-credited
`Drews', succeeds in part because Ryan and Jennifer nurture their unique
friendship for nearly all of the film.  While the inevitable Hollywood
ending may be in viewers' minds from the get-go, The Drews and director
Robert Iscove keep us guessing if this pair might ever connect with each
other, and the sweet performances by Prinze and Forlani keep us
interested.. The couple's interplay, and the machinations of their
separate, frustrating lovelives, are satisfying enough that a sunshiny
ending is not required.</P>
<P>Iscove, a TV veteran and director of Prinze's She's All That, provides
so much screen time between the leads that there are times when
sequences seem almost too long – until we realize we're seeing Ryan and
Jennifer weeks or months later, and not the same night as the previous
scene.  It's one of the many subtle surprises in Boys & Girls, and it
keeps the film floating with an infectious energy.</P>
<P>When movies like these create supporting roles, it's usually to provide
basic comic relief or other plot motivation that minimizes the
characters – not the case here.  Jason Biggs, becoming famous and good
very quickly, is Hunter, Ryan's roommate who changes hair color every
semester and stories with every girl he meets; Amanda Detmer garners
sympathy as Jennifer's nervous, jealous roommate, desperately trying to
find her way while being overly reliant on her therapist.  This pair
become neatly woven into the story, rather than existing just on the
fringes.  It's more effort than you'd find in say, Nora Ephron's
standard Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan romances.</P>
<P>One of the best compliments that can be paid to Boys & Girls is that it
recalls Cameron Crowe's work.  Sure, there's the basic story of young
adults trying to get comfortable in their own skin, but there's more.
Iscove injects the film with the total atmosphere of college life,
Berkeley, and San Francisco, creating a fuller environment for his
characters and story.  Crowe showed similar skills with Singles and …Say
Anything, and that kind of detail adds a real flavor and maturity to the
movie.</P>
<P>When John Hughes created The Breakfast Club in the mid-80s, he added
substance and humor to his characters, making a seemingly `teen' movie
appeal to a broad audience.  The makers of Boys and Girls were obviously
affected by Hughes (aside from Ryan and Jennifer going to a Hughes
double-feature): moving against the grain of recent films, Boys and
Girls glides by with no nudity, no gross-out humor, and minimal
stereotyping, and yet should still appeal to the high school and college
audience.   It avoids cheap laughs and respects its young characters,
and that's a welcome change.</P>
