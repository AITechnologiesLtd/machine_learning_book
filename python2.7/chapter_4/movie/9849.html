<PRE>AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
(PG-13)</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>In 1967, Austin Powers, British secret agent, was the hottest thing to walk
the streets of England. His main enemy? Dr. Evil, a blatant spoof of Dr. No
(from the James Bond film of the same name). Dr. Evil narrowly escapes into a
space-bound cryogenic freezing capsule and is launched into space. Thirty
years later, Powers, whom himself was frozen in order to save the planet from
Dr. Evil should he ever reappear (which he has), is unfrozen and more of a
mockery of the decade he once held in the palm of his hand. Thus is the
simplified plot of AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.</P>
<P>"Stupid" comedies are probably the most popular, especially among teenagers.
That is to say, movies that play to satire, parody, and general looniness.
The sad thing is that "stupid" comedies that actually possess intelligence
are rare. Films such as AIRPLANE!, TOP SECRET, BETTER OFF DEAD, THE NAKED
GUN, and even DUMB & DUMBER are good examples of "stupid" movies that are
well done and can actually garner a decent critique. Woody Allen, the Zucker
Brothers/Jim Abrahams team (although not so much after THE NAKED GUN), and
Mel Brooks are the more popular (and talented) examples. Such hits as TAKE
THE MONEY AND RUN and SLEEPER by Allen and BLAZING SADDLES, SPACEBALLS, and
YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN by Brooks are great movies that are well done, even for
being moronic.</P>
<P>AUSTIN POWERS cannot even closely come to being classified among these. It
cannot even come close to being classified among TOMMY BOY, BILLY MADISON,
HAPPY GILMORE, and even WAYNE'S WORLD, all of which were pretty good really.
It is better than BEVERLY HILLS NINJA however, but that's not too hard to
accomplish.</P>
<P>AUSTIN POWERS is an extremely crude and vulgar film. Sure, most of it is
enuendo and double entendres, but I still question if this movie shouldn't
have gotten an "R" rating. Even among the wild vulgarity and sex that is
prevelant in PG-13 films, AUSTIN POWERS manages to cry out in excess.</P>
<P>The fact of the matter is that AUSTIN POWERS is, for the most part, idiotic
and unfunny. Mike Meyers, who plays the lead character, also has a problem
with showing off. Some bits are obvious show off segments that have no
purpose in the story. It is also obvious that teenagers are going to make up
the bulk of those who see the film, so one must wonder if they'll even
recognize the 60's satire and James Bond parodies. Alas the cheap, cliched
teenage saving point . . . the aforementioned vulgarity.</P>
<P>AUSTIN POWERS will likely be hailed among some as hilarious, and it isn't
awful or unwatchable, but that doesn't make it a good movie. Two stars is
plenty for this lame, vulgar farce.</P>
