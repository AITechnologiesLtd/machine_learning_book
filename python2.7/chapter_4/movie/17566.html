10 Things I Hate About You (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>

<P>Shakespeare is spinning in his grave.</P>
<P>Picture this figure of speech.  It's not so much poetic as graceless and 
gross, much like Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate About You, a film loosely 
based on the Bard's The Taming of the Shrew.</P>
<P>Here's the premise:  two beautiful sisters living in Washington state 
stand for opposite worldviews – one superficial and pleasure-seeking, 
the other feminist and intelligent.  The position of Bianca Stratford 
(Larisa Oleynik), peeved that she is not allowed to date boys, worsens 
when her obstetrician father changes the rule.  Now Bianca can date only 
when Kat dates!  This seems unlikely, as Kat is the shrew of 
Shakespeare's title, a determined little termagant who shuns guys only 
after she has mentally outshone them. Here now – complications.  At 
wit's end, Bianca exploits a boy with a crush on her, a new kid in 
school named Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt).  In a convoluted series of 
schemes, a handsome bad boy (Patrick Verona, played by Heath Ledger) is 
paid to woo Kat.  Hence Bianca is free to date the slimy Joey Donner 
(Andrew Keegan), although she had suggested she'd be dating Cameron in 
return for his favor.</P>
<P>Still with it?  The basic love stories are promising, especially a minor 
one involving a friend of Cameron's and a friend of Kat's.  But the 
turns of romantic plot are too predictable, and the resulting 
relationships fall flat.  How can viewers believe a repulsive young man 
like Verona can become a desirable, even noble character?  Does Bianca 
truly overcome her shallowness and attain a mantle of decency?  And most 
crucially, why is the shrew tamed so relatively easily?  Heaps of 
questions occur to the watcher of this film.</P>
<P>Julia Stiles is the most striking cast member, and does a strong job 
portraying Kat's feminist bent.  Karen McCullah Lutz's screenplay, 
though, casts Kat as a closet Barbie, ready to comply when she is 
pleased.  A strong facial resemblance helps Oleynik in being convincing 
as the sister.  Oleynik is fine as Bianca, especially in portraying the 
occasional shallowness that is such a strong contrast to Kat's cultural 
politics.</P>
<P>Larry Miller plays the father of Kat and Bianca as an overprotective 
buffoon.  He's an undeveloped caricature about whom we ultimately care 
very little.  Let it be enough to say that the writing has him telling 
us about his character, when real characters show themselves.  Needless 
to say, his wife is missing from the scene.  The result does not make us 
sympathize for the plight of his single parenthood, as much as it makes 
us wonder if screenwriters don't kill parents off just to have less 
characters to flesh out fully.</P>
<P>In a couple of small roles, David Leisure and Daryl Mitchell play 
teachers who add funny moments to the film.  But the tones of their 
characterization again intrude, and the viewer wonders if she is 
watching realism or over-the-top camp.  The filthy language and personal 
insults used by Mr. Morgan (Mitchell's teacher) are downright 
unbelievable.  It's almost as though the film is trying to exaggerate in 
the same way the situations in Clueless were exaggerated – but 10 Things 
is much less successful.</P>
<P>The film's faults are many.  For one, Budweiser must have paid dearly 
for product placement.  How advisable is it, however, to place your 
product in the hands of hundreds of actors playing underage drinkers?  
Another, larger flaw is the sense of irresponsibility.  Again and again 
the youngsters peopling the film do nasty things to  each other and fail 
to pay for them.  From silly schtick – Bianca shooting her coach with an 
arrow – to major deception, 10 Things I Hate About You reinforces the 
notion that horrible behaviors often don't carry consequences.  Yes, 
there are the conventions of teen movies:  references to sex, scanty 
clothing (enough navels, already!) and endless sight gags.  Not that a 
film must be politically correct, but this one also points out several 
cliques, poking fun at each of them.  The satire is done nicely, but in 
the end the tone is less than tolerant.  Oh, besides Mitchell, there is 
one African-American actress, Gabrielle Union, as one of Bianca's 
shallow friends.  The lack of diversity is one shortcoming, but it's the 
film's careless accenting of reckless attitudes that crosses the line 
from harmless fluff to become offensive drivel.  In the current flood of  
teen-oriented films, when is a director going to respect this line?</P>
<P>The tie-in with Shakespeare is what drew my attention.  No similar 
relation exists with the spate of new teen flicks.  So for the millions 
of moviegoers not targeted by filmmakers exploiting this genre, do not 
hesitate to miss them.  Even the use of Good Will could not add weight 
to this piece;  come on, how much more lightness do the young people of 
the world need?</P>
