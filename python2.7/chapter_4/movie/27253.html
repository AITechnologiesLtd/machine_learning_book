<P>In 1922 an original, and very scary film came out called "Nosferatu"...he was 
the first image of a character of Dracula...and now almost eighty years later 
Dracula is resurrected to the big screen once again in this mind-numbing 
effort from first time director Patrick Lussier, who is Wes Craven's editor. 
This is the billionth Dracula film ever made, and to me it seems the more 
they make them, the worse they make them.</P>
<P>The last good Dracula film (actually the last Dracula film) was 1992's 
lavishly made "Bram Stoker's Dracula" which gained critical and audience 
raves, and made a ton of money at the box office. Sixty years before that was 
the movie that made Bela Lugosi popular and that was "Dracula". This year we 
get a new Dracula film for a new generation.</P>
<P>"Dracula 2000" opens with an interesting montage of scenes from a ship years 
ago, with dead and bloody people on the ship, obviously attacked by some 
creature. We then shoot to London, England 2000 where we meet Simon (Jonny 
Lee Miller) and his father like figure Abraham Van Hesling (Christopher 
Plummer). They run a museum with a very special exhibit locked away deep 
inside a vault. When the vault is robbed of it's exhibit, Abraham reveals 
what was locked away in this vault: Dracula himself...now he is on the loose 
in modern day London.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Mary (Justine Waddell) is having visual nightmares of a black 
haired man who haunts her in her dreams, he stalks her, finds her, and then 
disappears as she wakes up. Her friend Lucy (Colleen Fitzpatrick) thinks she 
is just lacking sleep, but Mary knows something is wrong, something deep 
down, something in her family. After Abraham reveals yet another shocking 
secret, he and Simon must find Mary and save her from Dracula, before it's 
too late, whilst Dracula stalks around town, making even more vampires appear 
in the town.</P>
<P>Wes Craven's lead editor Patrick Lussier clocks in his directorial debut 
(although he directed last years direct to video "The Prophecy III") and he 
does a good enough job keeping the film on it's heels, but somewhere towards 
the fourty-minute mark the film takes a turn and starts to get oddly 
confusing, and the rest of the film I was so confused I had to ask my friend 
what just happened, he couldn't answer my questions, for he was as confused 
as I was.</P>
<P>Lussier seems to want to make more of an action film, than a hardcore Vampire 
film, in the ending climax "The Matrix" technique using slow-motion while 
showing the trail of a bullet is excessively overused, and gets really old, 
really fast. The acting on the other hand is very well done with Justine 
Waddell clocking in a grat performace as the lead woman Mary, Christopher 
Plummer and Jonny Lee Miller are great as well, and the rest of the 
supporting cast with Jennifer Esposito (who is as beautiful as she is 
talented) is the stand-out in the supporting cast.</P>
<P>Lussier also wrote and edited the film, which only one he did successfully, 
the writing is not that good at all, and this film I can safely say has a 
terrible script, with some bad dialogue and bad jokes, however the editing is 
fantastic and Lussier seems to be able to do at least one thing good. Overall 
Dracula 2000 is a so-so horror film, that isn't scary at all, but seemed to 
keep my attention throughout it's short runtime of 97 minutes. See it with 
caution, and don't expect to see too much.</P>
