<P>The French have a knack for unusual stories. This one is another one of
those.  And, while its subject matter is serious in many ways, at a bad time
in their history, somehow they manage to get some humor and intelligence
added to it, and we end up enjoying it. Such is French film. It can be dark
comedy, and often this is vicious and vitriolic that it renders the work
rather obtuse and left behind.
Or it may be a comedy making fun of comedies, in which case the humor often
comes off as obscure and no one understands it.</P>
<P>This film could easily fit anywhere between comedy and tragedy. Somewhere,
in the middle are the films that try to tell stories about France's
involvement in WWII, which often is considered a non-involvement, in hope of
preventing itself from being totaly destroyed by the Germans, or anyone
else. To help with these efforts, the French organized "La Resistance" which
co-operated with the western anythings for a long period of time. The
question is, the film brings about by accident, where does it start and end?
But the obvious reason for it is clear. Survival of the fittest and the
cleverest, if not for themselves, at least for their families.</P>
<P>Albert Dehousse has an advantage over some people. He does his homework, and
rehearses his act, and prepares himself for many eventualities, which is not
quite the case in others examples. We are learning by the various interviews
in the film, that there were many people that lived this kind of life, and
that enjoyed some success in these things. Some were not so obvious, but
others were pretty obvious. But Albert's case, if not any different from any
one else, shows that he has the gift of staying cool under fire, and
eventually finds himself working for the French resistance, in the later
stages of the war, when their greatest job was to flush out those who had
defected to the German German side. He does very well in this job, because
he has the steel nerves of any superior officer, at least on the outside,
and displays the intelligence and efficiency that brings about some respect
and support within his own ranks, where many are upset that this outsider,
with no visible record has passed them all for a post.</P>
<P>One day, though, he has to perform the ugly duty of ordering the killing of
his own country men, who have been caught in German uniforms. And this sets
about his "resignation" from his post, and admittance that he was a fake.
The French authorities are embarrassed, but realized the amount of work this
man apparently has done for them, and decide to let him go.</P>
<P>But another impropriety, the smaller one he overlooked, is the one that
lands him in jail. He had married before he disappeared in the middle of the
war. And in Baden-Baden, he married again. And a judge saw fit to throw him
in jail for three years.... of all things.</P>
<P>While the film, not any kind of spectacular production per se, is
fascinating, as a study of the times in France, it also shows how confusing
the whole thing was. And this combination, can be frightening for the simple
minded film goer that is not used to thinking ahead, or suspending any
belief long enough to find their way out of any situation. The dialogue in
this film is critical and it is magnificently written and designed to
display what it has taken for these people to survive.  Cunning, clever,
answers, vague, and reversed, the actual answer is never given, and this
seems to be a slightly intellectual attitude that many French love to take
in the sidewalk cafes, and evening discussions. But it works, for them, and
they were capable of using it for their own survival.</P>
<P>This is a very good film. It is very talky, and dependant on the quality of
the translation of the sub-titles, because there are nuances in the wording
of it that change the meanings all around. These are difficult for foreign
audiences, and yet, even with the subtitles, this makes it through. But,
nevertheless, it makes for an ok exercise, because likewise the characters,
in the film, who are being "swindled" by the changing of the truth and the
reversal of the questions, so is the audience. We are watching something,
that we do not know how to take at all.... except as another story, being
told in retrospect, by an elder Dehousse ( Trintignant ), with some
interviews by many people who may have been around at the time as public
figures of some sort. The film tries to use some of the "facts" from these
findings, but they are shady at best.</P>
<P>So people like Albert Dehousse, survived, and even did their duty for the
country in a bad time. Wether they were part of the Resistance or not, if
this film is any indication, one could say that Albert was. This had been
one of the most important questions, since it became the definition of a
hero, or not. But, the whole thing does not take away from the fact that
Dehousse could make up stories based on truth and whatnot. What made his
special, is that he took the hint from a writer in the beginning, he borrows
the story and then "blends" in. In many cases, in one that helped him
display his ability to command, was one that pretty much summarized where
many failed. A group of people, all memorized the same story. And Dehousse
realizes that it is a story, and arrests these people, because the same
story was in a magazine that they all read, right in front of them. And
Dehousse, takes hi scue, and immediately adds the support of someone under
his command, as a way to distract the obvious attention on him, as a person
that did not deserve the post in the first place. As it turns out, the
French authorities, probably had the right man at the post, because all the
others were fighting each other for points and superiormanship, which at
times, seems to have undermined their own work.</P>
<P>With some very good acting by Mathieu Kassovitz,  and a very good supporting
cast, this film does in a small anount of time, what most films really can
not do. It tells a story and then some.</P>
<P>Very good film, with some very entertaining exchanges, and stories. It is
also, a look at a very peculiar time in France's history.</P>
