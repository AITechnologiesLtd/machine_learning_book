<PRE>The Filth And The Fury </PRE>
<P>Rock 'n Roll is a musical canvas artists have used to express themselves for 
over half a century now. Since its inception it's always been considered a 
threat to the establishment and many musicians have come along and made good 
on that threat while others are just fronts for big-business record 
companies. In this age of glamor boy bands, sultry teenage girl singers and 
bubblegum pop that rivals the 1950s for sheer cheese value there's never been 
a more appropriate time for "The Filth And The Fury." This is a documentary 
about The Sex Pistols, one of the most controversial and shocking bands due 
to the fact they were absolutely 100 percent authentic in their rage against 
the machine. </P>
<P>Most bands you hear today are just watered-down versions of a better artist 
that isn't in the limelight anymore. I've read about The Sex Pistols and 
heard of their outrageous behavior but I've never truly understood or 
appreciated how influential they've been on rock music for the past quarter 
century. If their story were told as fiction today it would probably be the 
most trite thing you could imagine. </P>
<P>"The Filth And The Fury" lives up to its name right from the get-go. There's 
a considerable amount of time spent in depicting England in the mid-1970s 
which apparently was on the verge of a revolution, a civil war or just pure 
anarchy. We're shown real footage of news broadcasts of the time - of garbage 
piling up all over London due to a labor strike, of people rioting as if it 
were their full-time job and of the punk scene where the youth did everything 
and anything outrageous and rebellious to lash out against the system. Then 
along came The Sex Pistols, a rock band born and raised in these deplorable 
conditions that utterly symbolized the people's outrage. They weren't trying 
to be evil and shocking for kicks, this is really how they lived their life. </P>
<P>The band consisted of four members; lead singer Johnny Rotten; bassist Glen 
Matlock; drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones. Matlock later quit the 
band and was replaced by Sid Vicious. They dressed in ripped t-shirts, 
ripped leather held together by safetypins with dyed hair and sometimes 
adorned themselves with Swastikas. Their fans had even more outrageous hair 
designs and clothing, often looking like monster out of an Ed Wood movie. The 
music was probably the "hardest" rock of the day although by today's 
standards it's almost run-of-the-mill. What put it overboard was Rotten's 
lyrics and vocals - an all-out assault of outlandish behavior and 
anti-establishment messages that added up to a big middle finger to world (of 
course that gesture was employed a lot too). Their first gigs took place in 
the back of strip clubs and S&M shops, attracting the kind of people we'd 
think of as the most twisted and perverse. But it's not like they were out to 
make radio-friendly unit shifters and sell records. The band was each of the 
members' reason for living, otherwise they could just wallow their lives away 
like so many other people of the time. </P>
<P>What's most interesting about this film is that it's the story of The Sex 
Pistols in pretty much their own words. There's present-day interviews with 
the band members individually (they still hold grudges against each other and 
their former managment). Each has his own chance to tell his perspective of a 
story or of an event - there's no neutral narrator. There's no interviews 
with musicians of today discussing the influence they had. About 95% of what 
appears on screen is original footage shot before, during and after their 
rise to fame. It's almost unbelievable how much was captured on film, so much 
so that you wonder if a lot of it is re-enactments because there's so much 
footage of such significance. </P>
<P>Director Julien Temple and company keep the motif of the dark and dreary 70s 
rich and consistent. This is the REALLY ugly side of the 70s you never read 
about in history books or see in mainstream rock documentaries. The mood is 
so wholly "underground" that when stuff like the occasional S&M scene is 
throw in, or when psychedelic animation shows the band in a dream-like state, 
or we see real documentary footage of The Sex Pistols live shows and how 
insance their fans were it never seems out of the ordinary. This whole movie 
is practically one step away from being hardcore pornography or even an snuff 
film, the only difference is those vices come in the form of the Pistols' 
existence  - of being the most dangerous thing to the English empowerment at 
the time. </P>
<P>I do have a few bones to pick, though. Firstly, the editing style is a bit 
strange, with constant cuts from footage of the Pistols performing live to 
backstage footage to newsreels to bizarre S&M and punk footage that has 
little to do with the band themselves. If Oliver Stone had this made this 
movie then I could understand it. Also, the modern-day interviews with the 
band are shot in shadows - why? Are they ashamed of themselves? It's probably 
meant to keep with the overall darkness of the film, but it seemed out of 
place to me. I didn't even enjoy the music that much, I find their sound 
bland and repetitive and Rotten's singing is grating and unmelodic. That's 
why these guys aren't recoginized so much as musicians as they are performers 
and revolutionaries (they only have one studio album). </P>
<P>For the most part this is a pretty enjoyable film, certainly an educational 
one at the very least. "The Filth And The Fury" is a must-see to anyone whose 
ever thought ANY form of mainstream entertainment could be a public enemy. 
The Sex Pistols might not have changed the world for the better, or in any 
way at all, but the fact they shocked the establishment as much as they did 
and were persecuted for simply being themselves is scary. </P>
