<PRE>                                  SUSPIRIA
                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Ranks with HALLOWEEN and PSYCHO as one of the most viscerally
terrifying pieces of moviemaking ever. An artful and visually sumptuous
scare.</P>
<P>For all of his other shortcomings, Dario Argento has made some of the
best-looking horror movies in existence. And some of the most mortifying.
SUSPIRIA is the creme de la creme of his career, a *really* scary story
that will give even sophisticated audiences a good jolt.</P>
<P>Jessica Harper stars as Susie Banyon, a ballet student who has gone to a
special conservatory in Austria to study dance. The movie sets her up
quickly and efficiently: she's not a genius, but she has a kind of taciturn
stubborness about her that's endearing, and will help see her through the
more ghastly moments in the movie. The night she arrives, it's raining and
thundering (of course), and she blunders into a student who's running out
of the conservatory. She half-hears her shout out something, but it's lost
in the wind. The next night that girl is murdered horribly, in a scene
which had many of the seasoned horror fans around me raking the fabric off
of the couch arms. (The brawny arms of the killer, by the way, are the
director's -- a consistent visual device of his which he refuses to discuss
in interviews. Hmm.)</P>
<P>At the conservatory, Harper is instantly surrounded by all manner of
eldritch characters. Some are a lot less innocent than others, of course,
and the way Harper pieces together what's *really* going on behind the
walls (literally) is ingenious. I will not reveal the deeper aspects of the
plot, even though it's not too difficult to figure out. It's the tone and
mood of the movie that matters more in this case, both of which are superb.</P>
<P>Be warned that SUSPIRA delivers some incredibly gruesome moments. One scene
has one of the girls falling into a pit of barbed wire and being slashed
horribly -- and then having her throat slit as she's trying to climb out.
Another scene features an unbelievable number of maggots coming through the
walls and ceiling. (The last one is especially memorable because the
explanation turns out to be relatively mundane!)</P>
<P>Technically, the film is excellent. This is a beautiful movie -- the screen
fills with bright, garish colors (mostly red, of course), and the set
design is eccentric and striking. I watched the uncut US laserdisc edition
from Image, which is now regrettably out of print, but is letterboxed and
features the full-length version of the movie plus two trailers. If you can
find the uncut edition, watch it in lieu of all others. On an empty
stomach.</P>
