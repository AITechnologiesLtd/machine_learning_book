<P>Anyone up for a nice game of demonic tag? In the supernatural thriller 
"Fallen," the demon Azazel can transfer from body to body by mere touch. 
It happens instantaneously, so quickly that the next party doesn't even 
have time to react. There's a great scene in the film where Detective 
John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) finally realizes the truth about the 
creature when it follows him down a crowded street, transferring from 
body to body with remarkable ease while taunting the terrified officer. 
Director Gregory Hoblit exhibits perfect timing in this nifty scene, his 
camera flowing smoothly from actor to actor as Azazel body-hops. It's 
words and expressions seamlessly transfer from one person to the next, 
and the effect is dazzling and truly creepy. Ah, if only Hoblit could 
have maintained this level of tension for the whole film. 
He didn't, of course, which is why "Fallen" has been released in January, 
a month designated by the studios for dumping those films that couldn't 
cut it during the highly competitive holiday season. It's a shame, 
because "Fallen" had real potential.
The idea is nothing new. The stylish sci-fi thriller "The Hidden" focused 
on a hedonistic alien murderer that moved from one human host to another 
and the central storyline of David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" involved the 
demon BoB, who killed Laura Palmer while inhabiting her father's body. In 
those stories though, the transfer was traumatic, to say the least. The 
ingenious twist of "Fallen" was in making the transfer instantaneous and 
painless. When the demon moves on, the previous host has no memory of 
what just happened, making the procedure all the more insidious. How does 
a detective follow an investigation when the body that did the killing 
may actually be innocent? Unfortunately, "Fallen" only toys with the 
notion, rather than diving in completely.
The story begins as Hobbes attends the execution of his nemesis, serial 
killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in a brief, but electric performance.) 
Hours before his death, Reese requests, and receives a visit from Hobbes. 
In one of the film's best scenes, Reese moves about his cell like an 
animal, grinning maniacally at Hobbes while tossing off lines like "What 
goes around really goes around" between explosive bursts of a language 
not used since Biblical times. In the gas chamber, Reese continues 
grinning, singing "Time Is On My Side" right up until the end. 
Immediately following his demise, the camera moves to a point of view 
shot above the body, providing a hint of things to come.
In short order, Hobbes learns that something very weird is up, as the 
streak of murders begins again. His investigation leads him to 
supernatural notions he cannot begin to accept and to theology student 
Gretta Limano (Embeth Davidtz,) the daughter of an officer who was killed 
by Azazel. 
All the elements for a successful thriller are present in "Fallen," yet 
the film never quite catches fire. A large part of the problem lies in 
Denzel Washington's performance. Washington is a charismatic actor, but 
generally behaves like a Scoutmaster with a broomstick jammed up his ass. 
He is at his best in films such as the charming "The Mighty Quinn," where 
his stiffness was incorporated into the story. Here, his behavior simply 
appears too proper and subdued for the situation. His muted reactions to 
the incredible circumstances around him puts a damper on audience 
reaction as well. 
There's also the matter of Reese. When Hobbes learns the truth about 
Azazel, he surely would realize that, as one of Azazel's host bodies, 
Reese may have actually been just another victim of the demon. It would 
have been nice to see Hobbes give at least a moments thought to the 
notion that he might have sent an innocent man to his death, but it never 
happens.
Instead, the sole focus of the film is the cat and mouse game between the 
demon and the cop, while the supporting cast twiddle their thumbs. John 
Goodman is wasted as Hobbes partner, Donald Sutherland does his usual 
sinister shtick as the commanding officer, and Embeth Davidtz just rushes 
about looking grim. A promising subplot involving Hobbes live-in brother 
and nephew is never explored.
We do, however, get lots of footage of a dreary Philadelphia and an 
annoying voice-over from Denzel Washington that drips with clichés. Now 
don't get me wrong, "Fallen" isn't a terrible film. There's a genuinely 
intriguing idea at play here, and in a few scenes, the premise comes 
alive, showing just how juicy the film might have been. Had the 
filmmakers taken a little more time to think the story through and flesh 
out the supporting cast, "Fallen" could have been a real corker instead 
of just another January throw-away.   </P>
