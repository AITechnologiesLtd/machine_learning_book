<P>     Once, Hollywood framed our vision of the Old West as a place of
gallantry and bravery, where the good guys and bad guys would shoot it
out, and right would always triumph over wrong.  Women, when they had
parts in these films, had few lines, and rarely broke from the
stereotypes of dancing girl or meek, dutiful frontier wife.  Lately,
however, the images given to us by the film industry have been
changing.  UNFORGIVEN showed that the line between good and evil is
blurred, and Posse made sure that the role of the black cowboy isn't
forgotten.  Now, THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO comes along to clear up a few
more misconceptions.</P>
<P>     Once Josephine Monaghan (Suzy Amis) lost her virginity and gave
birth to a bastard, her future was ruined.  With her past sins hanging
over her like a hangman's noose, she has no choice but to flee the
constrained, pampered socialite's world she knew in the East, and head
West.  There she discovers that the best life she can lead as a woman
is that of a prostitute, so she makes the bold decision to grab at
freedom and independence by masquerading as a man.  Whiskers and
muscles aren't necessary.  The mere appearance of a female as a male in
a time when it's "illegal to dress improper to your sex" is enough to
convince just about everyone.</P>
<P>     THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO follows UNFORGIVEN in presenting a gritty,
dirty view of America's Nineteenth Century frontier.  The scenery is
still nice, but it's hard to appreciate a beautiful vista when an
innocent family is getting butchered in the middle of it.  There aren't
many heroes here; shooting people turns out to be a lot more difficult
than plunking tin cans.</P>
<P>     Loosely based on the true-life story of a woman about whom little
is known, the story of LITTLE JO is a masterpiece of detail and
intelligence.  Maggie Greenwald has done her homework, piecing together
an engrossing tale that movies quickly enough to keep the easily-
distracted involved, but not so rapidly that it misses the nuances of
the situation.  Touches of humor are mixed nicely with drama as LITTLE
JO explores the entire spectrum of human emotions.  And just because Jo
has chosen to live life as a man doesn't mean that she can't yearn for
her lost femininity.</P>
<P>     The focal point of this film is Jo.  As played by Suzy Amis, the
character is perhaps not perfectly developed, but the actress gets
better as the movie unfolds.  I was particularly unimpressed with her
early scenes (when she's openly female), but after the
"transformation," she settled into the role.  Amis is not an especially
emotive actress, and her Jo is reserved--perhaps occasionally too much
so.  The most effective scenes are those of quiet emotion, such as when
Jo sheds a tear.</P>
<P>     Physically, Ms. Amis is not so classically beautiful that she
can't be made up to look like a boy.  It's amazing how much a change of
clothes and a haircut can do.  Certainly, the transformation here is
far more believable than in ORLANDO.  I was never able to accept Tilda
Swinton as a man; it's less difficult with Amis.  Then again, she's
only acting like a man, not actually trying to be one.</P>
<P>     The standout actor in LITTLE JO is Bo Hopkins, who gives a
boisterous performance as the cursing, gunslinging Frank Badger, a
rough man with as good a heart as they come.  Hopkins makes Frank come
alive, and his relationship with Jo, which deserves far more screen
time than it's accorded, is one of the most real and interesting
elements of the movie.  Would that all the other character interaction
was as good.</P>
<P>     The last scene belongs in another movie, however.  Throughout
LITTLE JO, the humor is of the subtle variety, but as the film draws to
a close, there is an overt attempt at outright comedy.  It works as far
as getting laughs, but the presence of this moment somehow cheapens the
twilight of an otherwise mostly-effective motion picture.  LITTLE JO
doesn't need complete closure, and certainly not in the manner by which
it is attained.</P>
<P>     LITTLE JO is successful in capturing the atmosphere of the Old
West.  Camerawork and musical score deserve credit for this--especially
the latter.  From the first notes of the opening theme, it's apparent
that the choice of David Mansfield was perfect for composer.  Rarely
has a score so expertly matched the tempo of a film--it becomes a vital
part of LITTLE JO without forcing itself upon the audience.</P>
<P>     If you like films about the "new Old West," THE BALLAD OF LITTLE
JO is not to be missed.  Even for those who aren't particularly fond of
Westerns, this movie still has a lot to offer.  Keeping the conventions
of the genre to a minimum, it strikes out in bolder directions,
reflecting personalities and lifestyles through the eyes of a woman
whom everyone accepts as a man.  LITTLE JO loses its focus on a number
of occasions, but never for very long, and never in such a manner that
seriously jeopardizes the viewer's overall enjoyment of Maggie
Greenwald's film.</P>
