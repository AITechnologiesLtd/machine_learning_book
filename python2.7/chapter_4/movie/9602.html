<PRE>                             THE TANGO LESSON</PRE>
<P>While the story is an integral part of the film, the real joy is in
the exquisite dancing,   Sally Potter, best known for her film,
ORLANDO, the writer and director, wanted to combine her life
experiences with a tinge of unreality.  A film maker since she was
a teenager,  as well as a professional dancer, she fell under the
spell of the tango . . . as will you when you see this film.</P>
<P>Realizing that she must have authenticity to bring off the film she
decided to ask the renowned Argentinean tango dancer, Pablo Veron,
for dancing lessons. In return she promised to put him in a film,
his first leading role.  They shortly became dancing partners and
eventually he and she starred in the film with exciting
choreography by Veron.</P>
<P>Sleek, slick and sexy, the tango is a delight to behold when in the
hands of dancers who know and understand the subtleties of that
dance; the closeness of the dancers, the sexy kicks between the
partner's legs, and the smooth moves to the driving rhythm are a
joy both to the dancer and the audience.   While not all of the
tango's origins are known, it is a fact that it first showed up in
the barrios of Buenos Aires, as well as the bars and brothels. And
that it is definitely ethnic with overtones of African dancing and
footwork.</P>
<P>Both Potter and Vernon dance up a storm and, in the end, that is
what is best about the film.   Watching them go through their steps
is worth the price of admission, story or not. Provocative and
entrancing, the dance will grip you in its fascinating twists and
turns.</P>
<PRE>              Written and directed by Sally Potter.</PRE>
