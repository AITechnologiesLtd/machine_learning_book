<P>Juzo Itami, has been doing films, which, on the surface are comedies.  But
in every aspect, they are deadly serious.  A TAXING WOMAN, is a story about
a auditor for the local IRS system, which the Japanese have.  She has the
task of sniffing out the whole situation, and then get the law enforcement
agents to take over the corrupt companies.  And she gains respect, and a
promotion, on the way to doing her job well.</P>
<P>This time, her target is a Mr.. Gondo, who is laundering money, to avoid
taxes.  And her efforts are endless, and they almost fail, were it not for
an accidental moment in the film.  Mr.. Gondo looks innocent indeed, but all
the purveyors he works with do not seem to show the bills correctly... they
all are mis-matched.  The large place, where men take on many mistresses
looks awfully busy ( and they are proud of doing such nice business ), but
their books do not reflect this.</P>
<P>Ms Itakura gets on the ball and finally begins cornering everyone, except
the elusive Mr.. Gondo.   They are about to quit, frustrated, when a slight
accident reveals the hidden room where many of the
artifacts and receipts she is looking for are hidden.  And the invalid Gondo
is finally caught.  An aging man, whose sole purpose in life has been to do
well, and succeed, as he was brought up to do.  And as the taxing woman
 nice pun on her job ), is ruthless enough to be considerate, but never
gives in to him, who wants to take her on as a mistress.  She has become
more modern ( I suppose ) and her view is less historic.  She is not about
to become a mistress to someone she does not have a reasonable respect
for.... and Gondo is in her way of succeeding as well, although, by all
intentions,
hers is honest, whereas Gondo's were not.</P>
<P>There are moments when the film breaks into a satire, which it is meant to
be.  And the film has gags a plenty to keep everyone satisfied.  But the
inevitable question is, where does the satire end, and the story start....
they both go together.</P>
<P>In between, the film has sight gags that are Monty-Python'esque... scenes
where a crowd walks by in front of the camera at a fast pace, too busy, and
the like.  The un-impressed Itakyra, knows darn well that if this happens
they are hiding something, and  they leave enough doors open for her to do
her job.... and she jumps on it.</P>
<P>A few things are showcased here.... the film is also an interesting comment
on the rise of women in Japanese society.  Their work is being noticed as
being worthy of much more than a mere mistress, something which Gondo is
fond of, but is incapable of correcting.  And it is a woman, that undresses
him one more time, for taxes.  The only thing that Gondo does not see, a
throwback to the old times, is that he could very easily hire this woman to
do his books, and accomplish the same thing....</P>
<P>Fun film to watch.  Clever photography, which tends to corner people with a
camera when they are caught, and leave them in wide open spaces, when they
can not be reached.... well thought out, and,
FUNNY.</P>
