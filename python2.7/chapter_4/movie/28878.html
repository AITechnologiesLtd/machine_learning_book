<PRE>           THE HUMAN VAPOR (American version 1964)
          Re-edited from GASU NINGEN DAIICHIGO (1960)
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Toho Films of Japan made this story of a man who could change
from solid to gas and back.  While the English-language version is
hard to find and badly edited, it is a more accomplished story than
some of Toho's later and better-known films.  It makes for a decidedly
offbeat science fiction film.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
+4)  This review contains plot spoilers.</P>
<P>Toho Films, probably the premier film company of Japan, is probably
best known for their Godzilla films and some of the finest Samurai
films.  In the late 1950s they produced at least four science fiction
films on the subject of humans who could change their physical
properties.  For some reason they are each also crime films in
addition to being on a science fiction theme.  They made a film in
1954 called THE TRANSPARENT MAN, but it is very hard to find in this
country.  Humans turn into a sentient viscous fluid in THE H MAN.  THE
SECRET OF THE TELEGIAN features a man who can transform himself into
electronic impulses and transmit himself where he wants to go, not
unlike the later British film THE PROJECTED MAN.  The man in HUMAN
VAPOR, their fourth film, has the power to go back and forth into a
state like water vapor.  He can make himself invisible, he can fit
through small spaces and he can ride the wind.</P>
<P>While HUMAN VAPOR did get a 1964 release in the United States on a
double feature with another very different Japanese science fiction
film, GORATH, it is almost unknown in this country.  It also is a film
that is about themes that most American mass audiences cannot
appreciate.  A large part of the motivation of the main character is
his desire support a famous classical dancer and to help her to reach
perfection in her art.  Americans understand lust as a motive, or
love, but it is very hard for us to accept that someone can respect an
art like classical dance to such an extent that it becomes his primary
motivation.  I have always interpreted the story of THE PHANTOM OF THE
OPERA that the Phantom is not physically attracted to Christine Daae
but instead believes through her he can potentially create a perfect
operatic voice.  This is just not a theme that Americans seem to
appreciate, but it is easy to believe that the Japanese would accept
this motivation more easily.</P>
<P>Perhaps another reason this film is not frequently shown is the fact
it is Japanese with a title almost suggesting it is about people
vaporized by a nuclear explosion, making HUMAN VAPOR further seem like
it will be an unpleasant film to watch.  However the American edition
does more to make the film unpleasant than anything in the plot.  In
any case HUMAN VAPOR was poorly dubbed, poorly edited, and poorly
distributed.  For most American fans of Japanese science fiction films
it was unavailable or showed up very rarely on late movies.</P>
<P>In addition the film has been crudely re-edited for American
audiences. The Japanese editing is far superior.  The plot of the
Japanese version has the police facing some crimes that are baffling
to them and to the audience.  Slowly they track down the culprit who
has the strange ability to turn into a gas and return to human form.
The American version begins by telling the secret to the audience,
robbing the film of much of its suspense.  It also appears the
Japanese version lavishes much more footage on the Japanese dance
sequences.  These are very transparently chopped down for American
consumption.  The American editor has done everything possible to
dumb-down what looks like a fine and subtle film for an American
audience.</P>
<P>In the American editing, the film begins with Mizuno (played by Yoshio
Tsuchiya) granting an interview with a newspaper.  It is clear he
knows that this meeting is a trap for the police to catch him, but he
has no fear of the police and he wants to tell his story.  He then
tells how he became the Human Vapor in flashback.  He had originally
been a test pilot or astronaut, but was washed out for health
reasons.  Embittered, instead he takes a job as a librarian.  A
mysterious scientist, Dr. Sano (Fuyuki Murakami), seeks him out
wanting to use him as the subject of an experiment.  Sano lies about
the purpose of the experiment, and Mizuno agrees to participate
without question.  Mizuno is locked in a chamber and appears to be
reduced to a coma.  When he awakes he finds he has "become the Human
Vapor," a man who can at will turn his body into a gas and return it
to its solid form.  He discovers Sano has performed the experiment
several times, but that he was the first test subject who has lived.
In a rage Mizuno kills Sano.</P>
<P>Mizuno turns to a life of crime, robbing banks.  However, he announces
the crimes ahead of time, in order to save lives.  He clearly has no
fear that the police can stop him.  If someone does try to stop him he
can use his powers to make himself invisible, he can escape from the
bank through any tiny hole, and he can float into the sky and ride the
winds.  This makes him almost impossible to kill.  The police track
stolen money to a famous classical dancer Fujichiyo Kasuga (Kaoru
Yachigusa) and her instructor (the miserable looking Somesho
Matsumoto).  Police detective Okamoto (Tatsuya Mihashi), who has been
leading the investigation of the mysterious crime wave, discovers that
Mizuno has been supporting Fujichiyo.  Okamoto uses her as bait for a
trap to catch Mizuno.</P>
<P>The special effects are minimal by modern standards, using mostly
animation and/or smoke to show the presence of the vapor man.  He will
appear as a suit of clothing with smoke rising from it.  It is not
clear that smoke could hold up a suit of clothing, but it looks good
on the screen.  Throughout the 1950s Toho science fiction had used
more intelligence than money to create their special effects.  The
American version threw out the Japanese musical score for the film and
instead uses pieces of Paul Sawtell's score for THE FLY (1958).
Veteran actor James Hong dubs Mizuno.</P>
<P>THE HUMAN VAPOR can hardly be considered a classic of science fiction,
but it certainly has its rewards and is worth seeking out.  I would
rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
