                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     How do you make a Serious Movie about someone who never took
anything seriously at all?</P>
<P>     This Andy Kaufman biopic has been in the works and has been talked
about for so long, it's become as cultish as the man himself.  Will
Carrey get the Oscar nod he didn't get for THE TRUMAN SHOW?  My
prediction: yes.  Will viewers of the film finally come to understand
the infamous comedian?  No, and he wasn't a comedian, it turns out.
Andy Kaufman, in what may be the greatest revelation MAN ON THE MOON has
to offer, was a self-stylized `song and dance man.'</P>
<P>     It's hard to fathom a more difficult subject to tackle, which
explains why this picture has languished in development for such a long
time.  Kaufman, as even passing fans are aware, used elaborate pranks to
entertain the audience – and more importantly, to entertain himself.</P>
<P>     With co-conspirator and writing partner Bob Zmuda (see our
interview, coming soon), Kaufman wrapped his entire life in mystery.
>From his well-documented obsession with wrestling women, to made-up
lounge singer Tony Clifton, to his hatred for having to play dumb on the
TV show `Taxi,' to his funeral after struggling with lung cancer,
everything was a big joke to Kaufman.</P>
<P>     Or was it?  MAN ON THE MOON gives us a teeny peek inside Andy
Kaufman's skull before sealing it shut.  I can't say that I know any
more about Andy Kaufman than I did before I went into the theater.  And
while Kaufman may have been unknowable to all but his innermost circle,
I find that a failing of the film.</P>
<P>     But mind you, there's more to like.  Jim Carrey, as Kaufman's
doppelganger, is haunting and devastatingly accurate.  The man is
virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, and he deserves some
serious credit for his work here.</P>
<P>     Courtney Love, on the other hand, comes as close to ruining a
picture as she ever has.  Playing Kaufman's girlfriend, she has far less
screen time than she did in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (also written by
the same team that did MOON), but she just does just as much damage to
the story with her abrasive, out-of-place presence.</P>
<P>     `There is no real Andy,' someone says during the film.  I'm
inclined to agree.  Kaufman was a awesomely complex individual, and he
lived his life as much in front of the camera as he did behind it.  What
is there left to explore?  Movies, books, miniseries – I don't think
we'll ever know.</P>
<PRE>     I don't think we were supposed to.</PRE>
<P>     Note to self:  The title of the film, taken from the R.E.M. song of
the same name, is never explained.  I'll have to ask Zmuda about this.</P>
