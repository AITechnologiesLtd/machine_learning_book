<PRE>                                   NIXON
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A long, dark, bleak, often
          bewildering biography of one of this century's most
          controversial figures mixes large doses of fact and
          speculation.  Sometimes it is insightful, sometimes
          it is not very credible, and occasionally it even
          becomes muddled and incoherent.  It falls well
          short of the great film everybody was hoping for
          but, it has some very good points.  Rating: high +1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Some critics complained earlier this year when THE AMERICAN
PRESIDENT portrayed some Republicans as sitting in dark rooms hatching
dark conspiracies.  That film was mild compared to Oliver Stone's cold
expressionist painting of America's most controversial President.
NIXON is the bleak story of a man who had a harsh, unpleasant
childhood.  He parlayed that experience into life of power and pain
only to be brought down and destroyed by the powers he unleashed.
NIXON is a look inside the head of Richard Nixon that comes up with no
revelations beyond that it was a dark and scary place haunted by images
of his youth, a place as frightful for Nixon as it was for anybody
else.</P>
<P>     The film begins with a sales training film that may or may not
present Nixon's philosophy of dealing with people.  It is being watched
by the Plumbers on their way to Watergate.  The scene makes no earthly
sense in saying that these people would be watching this particular
film at just this instant of time.  But it is the sort of artistic
liberty that Oliver Stone takes in NIXON.  From there the film jumps to
points all over Nixon's life, flashing back in time for a few scenes
only to flash forward again and then to jump to some third point.  We
see Nixon's stern Quaker upbringing and his love/fear relationship with
a mother who had a power over him all his life.  Flash forward and we
see the deals he is making as a President after the Watergate story
broke.  Flash back and he is making other deals with J. Edgar Hoover or
with shady businessmen in Texas who seem to know before the
assassination that Kennedy will not be running for office in 1964.
Yes, this is an Oliver Stone film and secret deals and conspiracies are
salted into the plot.  In Stone's view, Nixon was a man who repeatedly
conspired with others and who saw conspiracies against him and
betrayals nearly everywhere.  He is a natural subject for an Oliver
Stone film.</P>
<P>     Under Stone's direction Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Nixon as a stern
vengeful man who must always assign blame for every misfortune,
sometimes bizarrely inappropriately.  Nixon is a man who remembers
every slight that he has ever received or imagined.  The 190 minutes
spent in Nixon's world is more than enough time.  Or more accurately,
it is far too much and yet not enough.  It is too much because of the
personality Stone gives Nixon is so sullen and unpleasant to be around.
And it not enough because the narrative is strangely out of kilter.  It
seems to assume the viewer already knows much of Nixon's history.  The
film spends an hour on Nixon's involvement with Watergate but not
enough to explain coherently the Watergate scandal to someone who does
not already know it.  Stone assumes the viewer knows the facts and
instead gives us a sequence that could be called "Famous Scenes from
the Watergate Affair."  I pity the foreign audiences who will try to
understand Watergate from what Oliver Stone tells them about it.  And
on top of that, Stone handily sidesteps the question of whether Nixon
knew in advance of the break-in.  In another odd sequence the film has
Mao and Nixon admitting to each other that they are tyrants.  Even if
the thought crossed Mao's mind, he would hardly tell Nixon.  Stone's
idea of what heads of state say to each other in private is almost
surreal.</P>
<P>     Some of the characterizations of the people around Nixon will be
equally controversial.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are played by perennial
screen slimeballs James Woods and J. T. Walsh.  While Haldeman is as
slimey as any of Woods's characters, Ehrlichman comes off as
surprisingly troubled by Nixon's actions.  Pat Nixon (played by Joan
Allen) is elevated to almost heroic stature, torn between love and
loyalty on one hand and moderation and conscience on the other.</P>
<P>     The Hollywood Pictures production is a prestige film and has a
superior cast of actors led by Anthony Hopkins but including Powers
Booth, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, E. G. Marshall, David Paymer, Paul
Sorvino, and Mary Steenburgen.  Hopkins is, of course, a terrific
actor, but his Richard M. Nixon is one of his worst performances in
recent memory.  He neither looks nor sounds much like Nixon, but worse
yet he exaggerates Nixon's slight slouch giving him a round-shouldered
hunched look.  Making matters worse the make-up artist has given him a
much more serious case of five o'clock shadow than the original ever
had.</P>
<P>     While Stone was bending reality he threw in more than this film's
share of surreal and experimental scenes including sequences that were
highly under-cranked to show cars or clouds zipping by or shots printed
in negative.  Rarely do these convey much to the film but a touch of
pretentiousness.  Certainly in an epic film of this length a few of
these strange effects should have been cut.</P>
<P>     On the other hand it is hard to rate NIXON too low as a historical
film that tries to analyze a figure as complex--not to say pivotal--as
Richard M. Nixon.  This is not a film that reaches for easy and pat
answers, even if it does at times seem overly harsh on the man.  It
covers a broad swath of history and presents it in a way that does not
underestimate its audience.  Like Nixon the man, NIXON the film has
major problems and major virtues.  I give the film on balance a high +1
on the -4 to +4 scale, still a rather tepid rating for so lavish a
production.</P>
