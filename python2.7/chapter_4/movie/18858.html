<P>     Tom Tykwer's RUN LOLA RUN is pure cinema at its most maddening and
invigorating.  Few films this year will leave viewers as charged from 
experiencing the film medium in the hands of someone who knows how to use
it; few films this year pack so much reckless energy into a tight 81
minutes.  And few films this year not directed by George Lucas will put
more effort into telling a tale about people who don't really matter as
characters.  RUN LOLA RUN is a giddy exercise in overkill combining
splendid bursts of audacity with a largely "who cares" narrative.</P>
<P>     The story opens with an 11:40 a.m. call to Lola (Franka Potente) from
her luckless boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a smuggler's courier,
about an impending crisis.  It seems that Manni left 100,000 marks of his
boss's money in a bag on the metro, a problem he has little time to solve. 
If Manni and money are not at the designated pickup spot at noon sharp the
same day, Manni is almost certainly a dead man.  That leaves Lola twenty
minutes to track down the cash from her wealthy banker father (Herbert
Knaup), twenty minutes which could end any number of ways depending on the
slightest caprice of chance -- a stumble on the stairs here, a moment's
hesitation there.</P>
<P>     The crux of Tykwer's premise is showing us three alternate fates for
Lola and Manni based on those caprices of chance.  It's a gimmick that
allows him to turn a short film into a feature, but it works better than
you have any reason to expect.  Each segment comes with at least one
surprising twist, the kind of detail that shows Tykwer's rare talent for
being ingenious without being self-congratulatory about his ingenuity.
The most surprising twist of all may be the welcome flippancy in his gloss
on the usually heavy topics of fate and chance.  His best-executed running
gag involves staccato, freeze-frame asides in each segment showing how
Lola's encounters with complete strangers -- changed by a matter of
seconds in each variation -- change those peripheral lives as well.
Tykwer uses his marginalia better than many filmmakers use the entire
page.</P>
<P>     Often, however, it's all just a bit...much.  The collisons of
animation, video, still images and film seem to exist as much because they
can as for any practical reason; surrealist touches like Lola's ability to
shatter glass with a scream are more befuddling distraction than artistic
nuance.  All the busy-ness of Tykwer's business does an effective job of
distracting from just how emotionally weightless it all is.  The quiet
interpersonal moments between Lola and Manni, inserted between the
alternate reality segments, should have been striking for the insight they
provide.  Instead, they're striking because they're about the only chance
you have to catch your breath.</P>
<P>     Still, it's hard to resist a film that maintains such a relentless
pace and squeezes so much pleasure from such a simple concept.  It's also
hard to resist the charisma of Franka Potente, the wild-eyed star whose
furiously pumping legs fuel RUN LOLA RUN.  If there had been the hint of
a person behind that personality, RUN LOLA RUN could have been sheer
brilliance.  Even without that strong human story, it's still the sort of
action-packed crowd-pleaser that makes so many blockbusters look so sadly
bloated.  The sheer momentum of Tykwer's techno-pop-pulsing direction
makes the film an entertaining jolt to the system, even if it's all
ultimately auteurist eye candy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 running narratives:  7.</PRE>
