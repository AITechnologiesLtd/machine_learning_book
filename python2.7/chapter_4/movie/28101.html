<P>Directed by Kenneth Lonergan, from his screenplay. Starring Laura Linney,

<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Let's be honest: movies don't often deal with reality. Filmmakers tend to 
prefer high drama, incredulous farce, or invented fantasy, and while 
these genres can be effective and entertaining, their connection to our
daily lives is often tenuous. In cinema, there's usually a beginning, a 
middle and an end, all punctuated by moments of great suspense and 
emotion. In real life, the highs aren't so high nor the lows so low, and 
there's nothing but middle.</P>
<P>"You Can Count On Me" is a film which is as close an approximation of 
reality -- real reality, not movie reality -- as I've seen. The story it 
tells is one which began before the theatre curtains went up, and which 
continues on past the credits. Those looking for a plot in which 
everything is ultimately wrapped up in a neat, tidy package will probably 
be somewhat disappointed; the movie has an ending, but it is not the 
ending. On the other hand, audiences desiring a genuine portrayal of real
people with real problems should be very satisfied indeed.</P>
<P>Sammy Prescott (Laura Linney) is a loan officer in the small town of 
Scottsville, trying to raise young son Rudy (Rory Culkin) all by herself. 
Her parents died in a car accident when she was young, and this left her 
and her brother Terry to raise each other. Sammy had her wild phase but 
survived it. Terry, on the other hand, is a drifter who checks in with his 
sister only every few months and seems to be going nowhere in life.</P>
<P>One day, Terry (Mark Ruffalo) returns to Scottsville. He only plans to 
stay long enough to borrow money from Sammy, but ends up sticking around a
while longer. Terry begins bonding with Rudy, who has never had a father 
figure -- he takes him to a bar to play pool, and lets him help out with 
the plumbing. This meets with the disapproval of Sammy, however, who is 
concerned that Terry -- never having properly grown up himself -- is a 
poor role model for her son. At the same time, straight-laced Sammy is 
experiencing turmoil of her own: not only is she involved in a 
dispassionate relationship with her on-again, off-again boyfriend Bob (Jon 
Tenney), but she starts an affair with her nerdy new (married) boss Brian 
(Matthew Broderick).</P>
<P>"You Can Count On Me" is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, a 
filmmaker who clearly understands people. Beyond an opening flashback to 
the accident which claimed the lives of the elder Prescotts, cinematic 
artifice is all but absent from the movie. This is a simple story told in 
a simple style, which is nonetheless absolutely perfect. Lonergan's 
approach is to be direct and sincere, neither too harsh nor too tender, 
thereby lending his situations and the characters a stronger sense of 
realism. Nothing happens simply for dramatic purposes, and even the 
picture's warm humour arises naturally from the goings-on, as opposed to
being artificially grafted onto the proceedings.</P>
<P>But this technique cannot be successful unless we believe in, and are 
engaged by, the main characters. Let's be honest again: more often than 
not, everyday life just isn't that interesting -- there's a reason why 
most movies don't follow this realistic approach. In the end, then, "You 
Can Count On Me" is an actors' movie. Without performances which are 
believable but still captivating, "You Can Count On Me" would be no more 
interesting than this morning's office gossip.</P>
<P>How fortunate we are, then, that Lonergan has assembled such a splendid 
cast. It is Linney who has received the most accolades, and for good 
reason -- quite frankly, it is Linney and not Julia Roberts who deserved 
the Academy Award. Sammy is a strikingly multifaceted character. On the 
one hand, she is a doting and responsible parent, straightlaced and
dependable. On the other hand, she's emotionally confused, and in the 
space of the film's running time we see her involved in no less than two 
ill-advised and potentially disastrous romantic liaisons. Linney 
demonstrates tremendous range, but does so without losing sight of the 
character she's playing. Too often, actors translate their roles into just 
a handful of convenient default demeanours. Linney approaches Sammy as 
though she is a real person, complete with a dizzying array of emotions 
and responses; as a result, Sammy becomes real.</P>
<P>No less impressive is Ruffalo. Screw-ups and black sheep are a staple of 
the family drama, but Ruffalo ensures that Terry does not fall so easily 
into these categories. Terry is a man who makes mistakes. Sometimes he 
learns from them and sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he makes up for them 
and sometimes he doesn't. One thing he isn't is a man who behaves 
according to type. The complexity of the character is particularly 
evident in his interaction with Rudy: Terry is neither a godsend for the 
child nor a devil on his shoulder. Their relationship follows not a 
straight line but instead experiences any number of twists and turns, and 
is all the more satisfying because of it. </P>
<P>Also fine is Broderick as the nebbish Brian, a man who is never entirely 
loathsome (or else Sammy's affair with him would be tough to swallow), but 
who always finds a way to rub the audience wrong. And Culkin shows that, 
like older brother Kieran, he is capable of genuine acting and not just 
mawking for the camera. Rudy is not preternaturally intelligent nor laden 
with problems nor unbearably cute; he's just a regular kid unique in ways 
all his own, and there aren't enough of those in the movies.</P>
<P>By the end of the picture, both Terry and Sammy have changed. And while 
the implication is certainly that they have both benefitted from the 
sometimes tortuous renewal of their family bond, I liked the fact that 
Lonergan doesn't overemphasise this development. Both siblings still have 
lives that are full of questions and problems, and futures with plenty of 
uncertainties. Just like you, me, and everybody else.</P>
