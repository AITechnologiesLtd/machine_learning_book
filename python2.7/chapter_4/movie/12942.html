<P>One of my favorite television shows ever was a Discovery Channel
documentary on squirrels.  The show was investigating different
contraptions designed to keep squirrels away from bird feeders.  The
plucky squirrels were so successful (after a couple of dozen hilarious
attempts) at defeating the stratagems placed against them that the
producers finally created the world's first Squirrel Obstacle Course.
The heroic squirrel had to make impossible leaps, walk a tightrope,
climb a ladder, and even (I think) pedal a little squirrel bicycle, all
to get to the seeds in the bird feeder.  A true representation of the
triumph of the squirrel spirit.</P>
<P>Primary Colors isn't anywhere near as good as the squirrel show, but the
theme is the same, nonetheless.  John Travolta plays... um... an
empathetic baby-boomer Southern Governor with gray hair and a high, yet
hoarse voice.  The movie is about Governor "Jack Stanton", his 1992 race
for the Presidency, and the various obstacles along his path to the
White House.  Like our friend the squirrel, Stanton has to persevere
through all sorts of odd situations.  We see Stanton soliciting votes on
a New Hampshire streetcorner in the driving rain as if he were homeless
and looking for handouts.  We see him wearing a yarmulke and chatting up
Florida retirees about Medicare and Israel, and dealing with lesbian
hecklers in New York City.  We see him selling satellite technology to
the Chinese... wait, that's for the sequel.</P>
<P>We see a lot of the sheer physical effort it takes to survive a
Presidential campaign in Primary Colors, but the movie is mostly about
the moral effort expended.  Primary Colors raises deep moral questions
in the pragmatic context of politics:  When is it appropriate to run
negative ads?  How do you ask the candidate's wife if he's been sleeping
around behind her back?  If it's moral to research your opponent, is it
moral to use that research against him?  The mantra you hear in election
season is that campaigns should be about "the issues."  To its credit,
Primary Colors is about moral issues and the buffeting those issues
receive on the campaign trail.</P>
<P>It's also about politics.  Political junkies will find much to carp
about in the presentation of politics in the movie -- you never, ever,
not even once hear any reference to fundraising, which is unthinkable in
a novel about campaigning -- however, director Mike Nichols manages to
capture much of the energy, nerves, and confusion that surround a
political campaign.   The set design, from the motel rooms to the
storefront headquarters is authentic in its shabbiness.  The casting is
phenomenal.  The large roles are famously well-cast (especially Billy
Bob Thornton as James Carville), but the smaller roles are filled
imaginatively:  Rob Reiner as a schmaltzy Miami talk-show host, Larry
Hagman as a ghostly Presidential contender, former Dukes of Hazzard
actor-turned-Congressman Ben Jones as a media advisor.</P>
<P>The script follows the famous novel closely -- perhaps too closely --
and although the twists in the storyline are awkward, they parallel the
awkwardness of the 1992 campaign.  I was, for a while, incredibly
distracted by the comings and goings of the assorted staff members, the
subplots that sputtered and went nowhere, until I realized that
campaigning is distracting in just that way, and that real-life subplots
don't always play out.</P>
<P>However, Primary Colors qualifies as a disappointment because what we
see on the movie screen is so at odds with what we know of real life.
Part of this is due to the unhealthy, interest we show in our leading
politicians.  Travolta plays a character based on a man whose private
life over the last six years has been scrutinized to an extent surpassed
only by the fictional protagonist of The Truman Show.  As a result, we
all think we know the President, and although Travolta does a fine job
of impersonation, he doesn't measure up.  Primary Colors gives us
nothing more than a superficial caricature of the real candidate.  His
worst enemies will concede that Bill Clinton is a thoughtful and
intelligent man, well-versed in public policy.  Travolta's character has
no grasp of public policy other than a desire to do big things, very
little personal warmth or charisma, and seemingly compulsive eating
habits.  The vague, buffoonish and broad characterization of the Clinton
character strikes me as more than a little unfair -- and this is coming
from a reviewer who is a confirmed right-winger, mind you.</P>
<P>In the same vein, Billy Bob Thornton may be perfectly cast as James
Carville, but he is wretchedly underused and cheaply stereotyped as an
ignorant redneck, no smarter than the role he played in The Apostle.
Adrian Lester has a smarter role as the narrator/campaign manager, but
he's saddled with a naive idealism worthy of the misfit volunteers who
people the storefront offices and make copies.  Only Maura Tierney, in a
too-brief role as media spokesman, has the appropriate level of
intelligence and cynicism you'd expect from a veteran political
operative.</P>
<P>Paradoxically, both the least and most most crudely drawn performances
in Primary Colors are the best.  Emma Thompson sheds her English accent
to play Travolta's long-suffering wife.  She manages to wrench a
profound and moving performance from the lines she's given, playing a
character with the intelligence, sensitivity and guts to deal with the
stress of the campaign and her husband's cheating heart.  Kathy Bates,
as a political troubleshooter -- or "Dustbuster", as she terms herself
--  is the most broadly overdrawn character in a movie full of overdrawn
characters.  She acts like a cartoon character throughout the movie,
screaming and brandishing guns, she redeems that performance with a
touching and pivotal role in the movie's climax.</P>
<P>But placing these performances aside, the heart of Primary Colors is
Travolta's Clinton.  With the tragic death of Phil Hartman, Travolta may
be the best Clinton impersonator out there today.  It's unfortunate that
Travolta's performance in this movie is more "Saturday Night Live" than
"Saturday Night Fever".  Primary Colors is a dishonest look at a
frequently dishonest political culture, and a misuse of quality actors
and moviemakers.  Nevertheless, there are enough positive things about
the movie to make a trip to the video store worthwhile -- unless, of
course, the Discovery Channel runs that squirrel documentary again.</P>
