<P>The title of this film initially appears to refer to Sir Robert
Chiltern (Jeremy Northam), who is a respected member of Parliament. He
is popular and has a bright future, apparantly on the fast track to
higher offices. He is married to the equally respected and upright
Lady Gertrud Chiltern (Cate Blanchett). Sir Chiltern is put in a bind
when the coniving Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore) appears on the
scene. She has uncovered evidence of a past indiscretion by Chiltern,
and threatens to expose it if he does not support a dubious piece of
legislation in which she has a vested interested. He had already taken
a position against it, thinking it a scam, but now he must choose
between saving his reputation and career, or acting in his country's
best interest.</P>
<P>The common link to these three characters is the primary character,
Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett). He is a close friend of both the
Chilterns, and was once engaged to Mrs. Cheveley, and because of the
entangled relationships, he is drawn in to the blackmail scheme. Added
to all this is Sir Chiltern's sister, Mabel (Minnie Driver), who has
been turning down a regular series of marriage proposals because she
desires Lord Goring. Goring is by far the most entertaining character.
He is an avowed bachelor, much to the consternation of his father, the
stuffy Earl of Caversham (John Wood). Goring epitomizes the
self-absorbed bachelor, taking nothing besides himself seriously. He
is utterly vain and dismissive of those things he does not care for.</P>
<P>Like a typical story by Oscar Wilde, this one has plenty of wry
dialog. The humor is derived from mistaken identities and crossed
communication. The situational variety of comedy is initially amusing,
but becomes annoying when it is overused in the climax. However, the
dialog never becomes tiresome, with all the best lines delivered by
Lord Goring.</P>
<P>Recommended. Although the story lacks depth, it is entertaining. The
characters' wrestling with morality and ethics is mostly
uninteresting, but the story is redeemed by its humor. The situation
comedy eventually becomes tedious, but the verbal fencing is
continuosly delightful and engaging.</P>
