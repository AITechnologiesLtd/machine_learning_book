<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>The top rated program on television is called `Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire?' Think about it; millions
of viewers across the world tune in a couple times a
week to watch someone else try to make a million
dollars (which, sadly, isn't that much anymore). Why?
`Small Time Crooks', Woody Allen's latest charmer, is
about a money-obsessed New Yorker who realizes that
there's more to life than striving to make the big
buck. </P>
<P>Playing the money-grubber is nothing new for Allen; a
filmmaker whose first movie was called `Take The Money
And Run'. In a recent discussion at UCLA, the comic
genius (who says he was a poor student) claimed that
after being denied a spot in the NYPD because of his
height, he planned to become a bank robber. However,
fate turned him into a comedian, and he decided to
live out his criminal fantasies through the language
of film. </P>
<P>In `Small Time Crooks', Woody Allen is Ray Winkler, an
ex-con dishwasher who lives a stable Manhattan life
with his wife Frenchie (Tracey Ullman), a manicurist.
The only things missing from Ray's world are
excitement and lots of money. So he decides to call up
his dimwitted jail buddies (Michael Rapaport, Tony
Darrow, Jon Lovitz) and plot a bank robbery. </P>
<P>The plan is to buy the flower shop next to the bank,
run a business as a false front, dig a hole under the
bank, take the money and run. Their business is a
cookie shop in which Frenchie is the only employee,
baking all the treats. Her baking is so good that the
shop soon becomes wildly popular, with patrons waiting
in line for hours just to buy one or two cookies.
Because of the store's newfound popularity, a cop
starts to notice the drilling sound that seems to
originate in the basement. When the bumbling criminals
attempt to break in to the bank, the cop catches them
and asks for a piece of the action. So the bank is
robbed, and the Winklers are millionaires. And this is
just the first segment of `Small Time Crooks'. </P>
<P>In an unexpected, clever move, Woody turns the tables,
changing the film into a comic study of the newly
rich. Ray and Frenchie are now wealthy and notorious,
living a life that is beyond stable, and gradually
losing touch with their relationship. Frenchie hires a
devious, strikingly handsome Brit named David (Hugh
Grant) to give the couple lessons in affluent
citizenship, while Ray would like nothing more than an
average lifestyle in which he can eat cheeseburgers
without feeling guilty. `Small Time Crooks' is
enjoyable Allen fluff, a film that is more engaging in
its first half, but more insightful in its second.
Film critic Andrew Hicks once discussed Woody Allen's
films, saying that `he also has quite a catalogue of
low-key movies that are entertaining but not
particularly noteworthy; movies like ‘Manhattan Murder
Mystery' that get three-star ratings in every movie
guide you check - no more, no less.' `Small Time
Crooks' is one of his aforementioned low-key movies,
and it gets three stars in my book. </P>
<P>Even in his 60's, Woody Allen is the hardest working
filmmaker in America, putting out at least a film a
year. He has gained the respect of `cinephiles' and
critics all over the world (and lost the respect of
good-natured people with family values), but has never
achieved financial success. The funny thing is that
`Small Time Crooks', which I perceive to be Woody's
admittance that one can't have it all (especially at
the box office), is Allen's first film of a three-year
deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks company, after
years of making his films with independent studios,
and is doing pretty good business in the U.S. </P>
<P>`Small Time Crooks', while not as entertaining as
Woody's superior `Sweet and Lowdown', should be a
breath of fresh air for his fans. After a short acting
hiatus, he again casts himself in the lead role,
perfectly evoking the Manhattan nerviness, which he
portrays so well. The supporting cast, featuring the
multitalented Tracey Ullman, fares quite well, and in
the end, `Crooks' is like watching `Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?', except its more truthful, educational,
and self-affirming. </P>
