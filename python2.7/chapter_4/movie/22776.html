<PRE>Mock Spock
Galaxy Quest</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Tim Allen, Commander Taggart of the hit TV series "Galaxy Quest," is
mistaken for a real space captain by Aliens desperately in need of his
courage. After reviewing the "historical documents" (broadcasts of the TV
show), the aliens beam him aboard bowing happily to his reluctant
leadership. Allen and crew of actors eventually decide to honor the
misguided recruitment and help defend these goofy aliens from the nasty
Sarris, a "A Bug's Life" grasshopper-like space bad guy.</P>
<P>It's pretty darn funny; though, you might be expecting a spoof, and while
elements of Star Trek mockery appear, they don't dominate. In fact, they
seem almost out of place in this stand alone space-comedy.</P>
<P>Since this alien race virtually worships "Galaxy Quest" they've built their
ship to the specs of the show's NSEA Protector. Therefore, pilot Daryl
Mitchell, though only an actor, should be able to step on board and do what
he does on the show 26 half hours a year. In a hilarious scene where he
first takes control, de-docking the ship from the star port, Mitchell drifts
a bit from center, the huge vessel screeches, scrapes and sparks against the
side walls.</P>
<P>Then there's crew member six, ever afraid of being killed off since his
character isn't important enough to have a last name. He mans the radar
after Sarris fires on the ship, "Uh Commander, there's this red thingee
moving closer to the green thingee - I think we're the green thingee."</P>
<P>Tony Shalhoub, the ship engineer, is awesome, "I'll get someone to spray
that with WD-40." Alan Rickman packs a whole lot more acting power than his
Spock-mock character demands; but that in itself is rather funny. Still,
it's the overly-friendly aliens themselves that keep this film rolling,
translating their shrieks into perpetually pleasant English for their idols,
"We've prepared some of your more Esoteric dishes, we hope you enjoy these
Monte Christo Sandwiches."</P>
<P>Focusing on fun, the direction of this film steers like a spaceship through
a mine field, dodging in and out from strong to "Dr. Who cheesy" and back.
Of course, the film doesn't take itself seriously, but should it have, while
maintaining its current level of fun, this could have been one of the finer
films of the year. Still, a good solid fun time. You'll laugh a lot.</P>
