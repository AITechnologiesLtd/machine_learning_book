<P>"Star Maps," an independent film that premiered at the Sundance Film 
Festival in 1997, is a decidedly weak drama that simply isn't tightly 
enough written or plotted to be satisfying, despite some notable 
performances.</P>
<P>Carlos (Douglas Spain), a young man in his late teens, returns to his 
Latino family's home in Hollywood and immediately is hired by his 
troublesome father, Pepe (Efrain Figueroa), to sell star maps, which 
point the way to the homes of celebrities, even though it actually is 
secretly a prostitution job. Carlos goes along with it, despite the 
warning of his caring older sister, Maria (Lysa Flores), and ill mother 
(Matha Velez), because what he really wants to do is become an actor, 
which his father assures him his job will eventually lead to. When one 
of Carlos' customers, Jennifer (Kandeyce Jorden), an actress on a soap 
opera, tells him she will get him a gig on her show, Carlos begins to 
think everything is turning up for him, but his father has different 
plans for him.</P>
<P>"Star Maps" is a technically well-made film, but one that is overstuffed 
with subplots, and not particularly successful when dealing with its 
characters. Aside from the central story, we've also got subplots 
involving Pepe and his own girlfriend (Annette Murphy); Maria's 
relationship with a kind-hearted pharmacist (Vincent Chandler); Carlos' 
mother, who is suffering from a nervous breakdown; and a lot of 
goings-ons involving the soap opera. Director Miguel Arteta might very 
well be a fine director, but in his film debut, he seems to have taken 
all of his ideas and mixed them up together into a 90-minute film. 
Because of this, there is not nearly enough time with any of the 
stories, and it eventually comes off feeling empty.</P>
<P>Flores, as Carlos' sister, gives a strong and poignant performance as a 
young woman who longs for a relationship but does not want to leave her 
ailing mother. And Jorden is also fetching as the actress who may be 
Carlos' answer to fame. I believe it is Jorden's acting abilities, not 
the screenplay, that makes her character feel wholly three-dimensional. 
Murphy is also memorable as Carlos' father's girlfriend, who is 
unknowing of how much of a liar Pepe actually is. All of the 
performances are quite good, but all of their individual stories would 
have fared better if each one had been made into a separate film, since 
they are all interesting people.</P>
<P>If there is one plotline that doesn't work, it is, unfortunately, the 
central one. Although the premise of people selling star maps, and 
themselves as prostitutes, is captivating enough, not enough is done 
with it, and so it feels like a missed opportunity, and just a gimmick 
to hang all of the other stories on it.</P>
<P>There is a lot that's good in, "Star Maps," and yet, it is clear after 
seeing it that it desperately needed another rewrite. Ultimately, the 
film plays like a rough draft in search of a final one.</P>
