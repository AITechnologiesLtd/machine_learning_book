<P> Despite being based on true events (key word there is based), "Erin
Brockovich" isn't about a story, it's a star vehicle.  Ostensibly, the film
is about people having their water polluted by an evil corporation.  A
well-endowed, twice-divorced mom named Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts),
comes to their rescue by digging up the dirt on this corporation and then
she gives her eunuch of a boss, a lawyer named Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the
cajones to go after them.  As David Spade might say, I liked this movie more
when it was called, "A Civil Action," or "Silkwood" for that matter.</P>
<P>The film, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh, the man who helped put
independent film on the radar, is so irritating that I wanted to throw
something at the screen.  Unfortunately, the three people behind me who were
jabbering throughout the entire showing were too heavy.  Just as an aside, I
've must say that going to the movies has become oh so pleasant nowadays.
People put their feet on your armrest, kick your chair, talk through the
movie, answer their cell-phones and all of this comes complete for the low,
low price of nine bucks.</P>
<P> Julia Roberts is considered America's sweetheart, but I guess here is where
I admit to being out of touch.  In movie after movie, she treats other
characters terribly.  In "My Best Friends Wedding," she is awful as she
connives and plots against Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz.  She is
reprehensible in how she treats Hugh Grant's character in "Notting Hill,"
teeing off on him for no good reason and the worst part is, he takes it.
Wasn't the whole point of that film the idea that he was different and
unlike everyone else, not tolerant of spoiled-brat, movie star behavior.  In
"Runaway Bride," she keeps dumping men at the altar when she gets the
jitters.  Gee, let's make a charming little film about a guy who bails on
his brides to be and see how charming audiences find that.
And now she plays an obnoxious woman with horrible taste in attire that
attempts to cash-out on a frivolous lawsuit.  When she loses, she demands
her lawyer give her a job because he "owes" her and then she continues to
talk back to him whenever it suits her.  In addition, she goes off on her
fellow office assistants, in particular, making fun of an overweight woman
whose only crime was criticizing Erin for not properly doing her job.  And
when Ed, her boss, tells her that perhaps she ought to wear something other
than the micro-miniskirts and revealing tops with her gazungas hanging out,
her reply is, "as long as I have one ass instead of two, I'll wear what I
like;" Wow, what a role model.</P>
<P> Instead of feeling bad for the people who were poisoned, I just began to
get more and more disgusted by Roberts' character since in this film, the
victims, like everyone else, are really just incidental to her.  Unlike any
other good legal drama, there is no compelling conflict created in regards
to the tragedy.  Soderbergh and his writer Susan Grant are more interested
in making Roberts look good by having everyone else look like a schmuck.
Finney comes across as a dolt as do all the other lawyers in the film.  The
office co-workers are all portrayed as fat and stupid.  The love interest,
George (Aaron Eckhart) seems like a decent guy but like Hugh Grant in
"Notting Hill," he takes so much trash from her that we can't care about him
either.   Even the poor folks who have been injured are portrayed as
pathetic which is upsetting because theirs is a sad story that should have
been told properly.  I feel terrible for what happened to them and I think
that Universal, Roberts, and the rest of the above-the-line talent should
donate their entire earnings from this film to make up for exploiting their
plight.</P>
<P>The biggest disappointment is that Soderbergh, after doing two good movies
("Out of Sight," "The Limey"), has so completely gone south here.  Maybe he
did it just so he could get a pet-project made or something lofty like that.
However, I think the reality is that all independent filmmakers, with a few
exceptions such as John Sayles, just want to sell out and make movies about
Julia Roberts' breasts.  That's fine, breasts are great, but let's cut the
pretense and the "I'm an artist" routine.</P>
