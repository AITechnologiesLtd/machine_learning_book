<P>"Even the guardians let down their guard."</P>
<P>Starring Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan
Skarsgard, Bruce Dern. Directed by Daniel Sackheim.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The Glass House is a fun little piece of schlock, a
soft thriller with some good ideas and a proactive
heroine. Its plot is too obvious to provide any real
what-happens-next suspense, but there are still
moments here to treasure. And, if after seeing her in
some seven movies, I still say that lead actress
Leelee Sobieski "shows promise," it's because she
hasn't been given a real role yet (no, Here on Earth
doesn't count, and I haven't seen her in the title
role of the tv movie Joan of Arc).</P>
<P>Here she plays Ruby Baker, a relatively average
teenager who goes to school, smokes up and has wild
nights out with her friends unbeknownst to her
parents. When said parents are killed in a car
accident, Ruby and her younger brother have to move in
with the Glasses, a rich couple with an amazing house
in Malibu and seemingly unlimited funds at their
disposal.</P>
<P>But in this house, as the film's advertising didn't
fail to tell us a thousand times, things are not as
they seem. It soon becomes obvious to everyone but the
main character that the Glasses, well-played by Diane
Lane and Stellan Skarsgard, plan to use Ruby and her
brother as their "personal piggy-bank," using the
money left to them in their parents' will, as well as
incidentals like their private school tuition, to pay
off their enormous debts.</P>
<P>The Glass House really doesn't come together as well
as it could have, what with the lapses in logic and
virtual lack of tension outside of neat individual
moments. But the movie is well-photographed by
tv-veteran director Daniel Sackheim, and it has a
marvelous production design: the house itself, with
its imposing architecture and, appropriately, glass
walls, has its own menace aside from that of its shady
occupants.</P>
<P>I also liked the back-and-forth between Ruby and her
brother, a series of authentic exchanges that is a
welcome respite from the contrived trappings of the
thriller's main storyline. Sobieski, true to form,
manages to build a character from a screenplay that
doesn't give her one; I'd still like to see her pull a
Thora Birch and do something unconventional. If she
can do this much with a script that actually exhibits
below-average level of writing, he sky's the limit.
And comedy remains an entirely unexplored field.</P>
<P>Diane Lane has slipped under Hollywood's collective
radar -- I don't think I've ever actually seen her
name in print outside of the obligatory "starring"
blurb -- but she is a dependable actress, skilled at
portraying seemingly everyday characters with
something else under the surface. And you almost feel
sorry for Stellan Skarsgard, a pure character actor
who doesn't seem to be having a good time; this script
is a deathtrap.</P>
<P>A better film could have been made from this material.
I could have used more careful plotting and less of
the characters having to catch up to us. I'm
recommending The Glass House, though, because there's
something inherently appealing about its plot (it's
hard to completely screw up an orphan-makes-good
tale); perhaps also because I watched it right after
The Musketeer, which momentarily destroyed my faith in
cinema. </P>
