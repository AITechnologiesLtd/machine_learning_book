<P>Dude, why on Earth do you think Premiere magazine picked us to be one of the
films that would gross over $100 million in the summer of 1998? Dude, I have
no idea, but another politically-incorrect comedy, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY (7.5/10), made over $150 million! Dude, are you for real? Dude, our
film kicked that film's ass all over the place!! Dude, ours didn't feature a
couple of bra-shots of Cameron Diaz, or a shot of cum in her hair. Dude,
where can I rent that video, dude !?!?</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two losers with little hope or ambition, create an amalgam-sport which falls
somewhere between baseball and basketball, called baseketball. The sport
rises to popular new heights, and tests its original non-commerciality
promise, and the friendship of a couple of air-headed dude buddies.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Sophomoric comedy barely curves a few laughs over home plate, pops up a lot
of corny and repetitive jokes, but hits a homerun for originality and strong
performances by the new kids on the block, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This
movie starts off with an original premise, a healthy cast of campy actors,
but slowly deteriorates into a "one-joke" movie, with a weak plot line and
flat sight gags. Don't get me wrong, I chuckled at quite a few of the jokes
in this film, but unfortunately for its makers (The Zucker Brothers of
AIRPLANE and the NAKED GUN series fame), there weren't enough to carry the
weak story in which they were stirred. I mean, how many times can you show
the audience cheering, the "sexy" cheerleaders leading, and the players
trying to "psyche each other out", before you look for a little more? I
would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a cute basis for a comedy,
with a little zing, but not much zang.</P>
<P>Also, if you're a fan of TV's "South Park", I'm sure you'll want to see it
for the big-screen debut of the creators of that show, Stone and Parker, who
actually work perfectly in this film, and really seem at ease and very
natural before the camera. So if you don't think the premise of this movie
is cute, and you don't care for either one of these two individuals, I
suggest you skip this hit-and-miss comedy, and check out the funnier THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Also, keep in mind that most of the humor in this film
is based in the pool of "stupid humor", which I personally enjoy, but others
might not. All in all, a so-so time at the videostore. By the way, if you do
get to see this film on video, there are about 15 minutes worth of outtakes
at the end of the film, which you could definitely skip out on. They are
absolutely NOT FUNNY, and actually carved away from the little smile that I
had at the end of the movie. Dude, why would you even put those unfunny
outtakes there to begin with? Dude? Duuuuuuuuude ????</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kato Kaelin, of OJ Simpson Murder Case fame, has a small cameo as a
driveway-game announcer.</P>
