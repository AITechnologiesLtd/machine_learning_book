<P>The author of 'The Thin Red Line' is the man who wrote the novel that
made for my fourth favourite film of all time, 'From Here to Eternity'. 
I'm talking about James Jones.  Jones' autobiographical 1962 novel, 'The
Thin Red Line', about American bravery, is certainly some of his best
work.  Jones' life was examined somewhat in 1998 in the film 'A
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries' which told the story of a successful
writer from the point of view of one of his children, and the novel on
which it is based was written by Jones' daughter Kaylie.  Jones died of
heart failure in 1977 at the age of 55.  His legacy as one of America's
best contemporary writers is still intact.</P>
<P>If you need twenty years off from the time you made your last film, what
better way to make a comeback than with a war film.  Certainly the most
harrowing of all genres, 1998 serves as a reminder that the greatest
conflict in human history, World War II, never seems to get tiresome and
audiences will pay big money to see stories about it.  'Saving Private
Ryan' decided to make its first half hour better than the rest of the
film but it never faltered for a second and Tom Hanks' performance can
be summed up by asking one question: "Would you want to go to war with
this guy?"  The answer is an overwhelming "yes!"</P>
<P>'The Thin Red Line' marks the return of director Terrence Malick, whose
last film, in 1978, entitled 'Days of Heaven', earned an Oscar for
cinematography, and Malick knows how to visualize his films in an almost
flawless fashion as he plunges his camera into 'The Thin Red Line' and
stirs it around until the picture on the screen comes to a boil. For
many, the film will be considered too graphic and that's just fine. 
Like 'Saving Private Ryan', it details a mission of American soldiers,
this time in the Pacific and details the Guadalcanal conflict which is
one of history's most written about events in dealing with the American
war effort.</P>
<P>Malick uses poetic metaphors in many sequences as a haunting afterglow
instead of any narratives that may have accompanied the film and it
works on several levels but 'The Thin Red Line', in many scenes, is more
about the illustration of motion picture technology than it is about
war.  Too much of the film details battle and not enough attention is
given to characterizations.  How can a war film be truly great unless
you care deeply about its effects on people you've come to know after
some rich character development.  This puts the film in a rather quirky
situation.  Is it disappointing?  No.  It's never boring and it's use of
explosive imagery is impressive for the most part but with a cast of
such noted people as Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson and some
lesser known actors, not considered stars but still worth their weight
in talent such as John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, Adrien Brody and Elias
Koteas, 'The Thin Red Line' works only on a superficially modest level
and time will tell if it will obtain classic status.  Some films take
time to be regarded for what they are but others, like 'Saving Private
Ryan', are instantly recognized and are truly the great films.  </P>
<P>Terrence Malick should receive an Oscar nomination as Best Director but
the film probably won't receive a nomination for its script, adapted by
Malick or for Best Picture as it lacks that touch of greatness that
Oscar looks for.  It doesn't have that one talked about scene that will
stir up conversation like the opening battle scene in 'Saving Private
Ryan'.  'The Thin Red Line' is only a series of vignettes strung
together with one big mid section that have a documentary style about
them.</P>
<P>'The Thin Red Line' is excellent film making but only average story
telling and while the latter is clearly more important as an audience
takes it with them through the exit doors at the movie theatre, this
film will still please fans of the war genre, but a lot of them will
only want to view it once.</P>
