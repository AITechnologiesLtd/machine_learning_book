* * * out of five</PRE>
<P>   Well, it's been a little adventure... watching the Scream flicks evolve and
generate it's stir over the course of the past five-or-so years.  Overall, as a
moviegoing experience, it was satisfying.  Scream brought back an entire genre,
and to a new generation.  Bringing forth both the good (The Faculty), the bad
(Urban Legend) and the ugly (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer). Along with
some loose ends in between. Though, not one exceeded the influence or even
entertainment value of it's predecessor</P>
<P>   The first was an excellent movie.  It had a dark satirization of the horror
genre that many a moviegoer appreciated very much.  Taking stabs at not only
the over-the-top content, but also some hilarious irony towards pop culture as
two characters discuss their relationship in relation to film ratings; "Could
you settle for a PG-13 relationship?"</P>
<P>   The problem with the second, the one I liked the least, was it seemed to
take itself more seriously than the others.  It was trying too hard and seemed
to get lost and become, as itself, part of the genre which it was formerly
poking fun at.  The ending was less than appealing, and the characters were
extremely flat in most cases.  But, it had it's moments also.</P>
<P>   As for the third (and supposedly final) sequel... aside from it's shockingly
disappointing ending and the fact that they kill off the best actor (not
necessarily character) during the opening, it was fairly better than decent. 
It provided some humor, although more in the form of slapstick, as opposed to
satire.</P>
<P>   Scream 3 is flawed, very much so. But, generally, an ending in a film of
this type can literally make or break the film.  And in this case, while not
breaking fully in half, it fractures in nonetheless. And I'm still in awe at
how completely gutless and amateurish the ending was.  Everything is wrapped up
in a "neat little package" and everyone (who's still alive) lives oh so happily
ever after.  C'mon, dare to be interesting. Ehren Kruger, who also wrote
Arlington Road (for which he won the prestigious Nicholl Screenwriting
fellowship award for acheivment in screenwriting) and the soon-coming Reindeer
Games with Ben Affleck and Gary Sinise, writes, and while Williamson, the
original writer of the first two, is no brilliant mind, we loose the series'
style (even knowing I disliked the second).</P>
<P>   Kevin Williamson's scripts seem like they were written on a plane trip from
Hollywood to Los Angeles, but they are always engrossing.  A good waste of
time, in most cases.  Though, to my surprise, Williamson supposedly nominated
Kruger for the job, and while he won praise and did win a very prestigious
award for achievements in screenwriting for Road, I feel, well, disappointed at
the simplicity of the picture,</P>
<P>   As for Williamson's works, The Faculty is merely a reminiscent of a typical
50's drive-in horror flick, Teaching Mrs. Tingle was pretty enjoyable even
though definitively "campy," and the Scream series has a heavy cult following
now.  He can write a good reminiscent of a certain genre.  I'm pretty sure he
could have improved the ending.  Even if as a cheap surprise ending (i.e.: I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer).</P>
<P>   Scream 3, at times, does break back into the satire of the original.  Not
too often does it, but when it does, it does so well.  Direct comedy towards
trilogies, stereotypes-of, etc., though not as impressively as it had in the
original.</P>
<P>   In general, I'd recommend it.  For a good time.  If you're going there for
any other reason you'll be disappointed.  Very typical and nothing
extraordinarily new or groundbreaking appears.  Rather predictable and
tolerably cheesy, as well as consisting of some seemingly forced performances. 
But I'd rather see this over the second any day. It's worth the money,
regardless of the flaws (which come plentiful). My advice: wait for video, get
all three and stay up 'til three in the morning watching them.</P>
