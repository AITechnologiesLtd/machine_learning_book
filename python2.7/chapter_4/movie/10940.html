<PRE>*** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Principal Cast:  Peter O'Toole, Rose McGowan, Jennifer Going, Ben Affleck,
Liev Scribner</P>
<PRE>Screenplay:  Dean Koontz (from his 1983 novel)
Director:  Joe Chappelle</PRE>
<P>I'll be the first to admit it.  I think Dean Koontz is a fabulous writer.
But translating the work to the screen will never measure up to a
novel's standard.  That said, this is the best adaptation of a Koontz
novel that has been produced by Hollywood.</P>
<P>The plot, in brief, is fairly simple.  Two sisters come home to a small
mountain town only to find that it's deserted.  A few surviving deputies
are left, but the force that took the town is still there.  And it starts
to toy with them.  The military gets called in and is wiped out and only
an old man with an unusual theory has any idea as to what is going on.</P>
<P>Major subplots get thrown out but most of the book's spirit remains
intact, despite major cuts to the story.  The action gets streamlined as
does the character development.  The suspense, however, remains intact.
There's a marvelous use of sound to put people on edge.  </P>
<P>Joe Chapelle does a good job with the material.  Confronting the monster
unfolds a lot like John Carpenter's "The Thing."  In fact there are shots
that are obvious homage's to that scarefest.  That's perfectly fine.  </P>
<P>I haven't had much experience with the movie horror genre and I imagine
that more experienced critics have ripped this movie apart with some of
its cliches.  I got my entertainment.</P>
<P>Koontz has said that he won't allow anymore of his books to be made into
movies unless he's writing the screenplay and producing in some fashion.
If this is an indication of the work that gets produced, then I'm looking
forward to more.</P>
