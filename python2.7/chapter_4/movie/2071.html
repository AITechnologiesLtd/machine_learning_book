<PRE>                         MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY
                       A film review by Rob Slater
                        Copyright 1993 Rob Slater</PRE>
<P>     I just got back from a special screening of Woody Allen's new
movie MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY sponsored by the Jewish Federation.  I
apologize for the unpolished nature of my review, it is late and I am
tired, but it is a very hectic week at work this week and I felt that
if I did not get something out ASAP I would let it slide.</P>
<P>     MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY stars Woody Allan, Alan Alda, Diane
Keaton, and Angelica Huston and is a movie about a couple who lives in
an apartment in midtown Manhattan and suspects that their neighbor
murdered his wife.</P>
<P>     In my opinion, this was one of Woody's best films.  Where he got
the time to make such a witty movie with all that was taking place in
his life in the past year is a real Manhattan Mystery, but nonetheless,
this is one of his most enjoyable films.</P>
<P>     For once, the character that Woody played is the best one in the
film.  His one-liners had me and the rest of the audience laughing
throughout the entire film.  In fact when I see my parents this
weekend, I am going to have to take them because I missed many of the
jokes.</P>
<P>     That is not to say that this film is a mindless comedy.  As usual,
Woody has done a wonderful job developing his characters.  The plot
also flows quite well.</P>
<P>     This film reminds me of some of his earlier works when, IMHO, his
movies were a lot more fun.  To be sure, Woody's characters have some
minor psychological problems (needless to say all of the major
characters visit a shrink), but unlike some of Woody's recent movies,
he does not belabor the point.  While it certainly helps to be a New
York Jew to enjoy this movie, it is not a prerequisite.</P>
<P>     MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY opens this Friday at a theater near you.
I strongly encourage you to see it.</P>
