<PRE>"Nurse Betty"</PRE>
<P>Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is a waitress at a little diner in
Kansas City.  She's married to an abusive bully named Del (Aaron
Eckhart) who sells used cars and is involved in some pretty shady
dealings. It's no wonder that the highlight of Betty's day is to watch
the videotape of her favorite soap opera, "A Reason to Love" each
evening. While watching her show one night, she witnesses the murder
of her husband by two strangers over a drug deal. The killers don't
see her and Betty goes into a kind of amnesiac state, forgetting her
real life and suddenly believes she is the ex-fiance of the fictional
Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) from her television story. She leaves
Kansas for LA in search of her beloved (in her mind) doctor, not
knowing she has two very upset hit men on her trail in director Neil
LaBute's "Nurse Betty."</P>
<P>Neil LaBute is not known for his bouts of lighthearted whimsy - if you
witnessed his previous films, "In the Company of Men" and "Your
Friends and Neighbors," you'll know what I mean. "Nurse Betty" hardly
seems the kind of story the more darkly natured director would take on
for his third work. But, it is a good decision and marks LaBute as a
multitalented up and comer in the industry.</P>
<P>The rather conventional concept of the heroine going on the lam to
escape the vengeful bad guys is skewed 180 degrees, in the script by
newcomer James Flanberg, with the intro of Betty's unusual amnesia,
triggered by Del's untimely, violent (though not entirely undeserved)
death. The sudden shock to the system propels her to fall under the
delusion that "A Reason to Love" is real life and that she jilted
Dr. David a year and a half before. Realizing the error of her ways,
in her confused mind, she packs her stuff up and heads to LA to make
things right with her handsome ex-fiance.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the two hit men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris
Rock), are frantic when they realize that both Betty and a Buick
loaded with their drugs are gone. They, too, head across country
looking for clues as to where Betty will show up. Charlie, at first,
thinks that Betty is a "cunning, ruthless woman" who coldly took off
with the drugs that were the cause of Del's death. As he and his
cynical partner Wes try to find her trail, Charlie begins to fall for
the pretty Betty as he gazes at her photo and builds an image of her
in his mind as they cross the country. By the time the pair hit LA,
Charlie is thoroughly smitten by the idea that he has fallen for
Betty.</P>
<P>Just when I was wondering how the heck the upcoming collision between
Betty and the boys would be handled, the charming, darkly funny
screenplay by Flanberg takes a twisty turn when Betty performs a
heroic act while searching for her beloved Dr. David. (This is where
the "nurse" in "Nurse Betty" comes into play.) The real fun of the
film is watching this part of the story unfold, so I'm not going to
discuss it. Let it be said that LaBute and his team of filmmakers - on
both sides of the camera - make the twists work in a way that is
funny, sad, entertaining and, in the end, extremely satisfying.</P>
<P>Renee Zellweger is an interesting actress who made a successful splash
with "Jerry Maguire," but hasn't had a chance, since, to show her
acting talent in a larger venue. With "Nurse Betty," this
changes. Zellweger shows the comedic talent to hold the lead of the
film and acquits herself in both the funny and dramatic bits. Morgan
Freeman, one of America's finest actors, hasn't had the chance to
really show his acting chops for quite a while. (Of course, the great
actor always gives his best to his films, even if the films themselves
don't.) Here, he gets the chance to create an interesting, sympathetic
character - who happens to kill people for a living. As Freeman goes
from the tough, deadly businessman to the romantic, smitten "suitor"
of Betty, you can see why he is one of the best in the business. The
rest of the cast is first rate, too. Chris Rock, as the acerbic,
cynical Wesley has an inherent mean streak that gives his no-nonsense
killer an edginess that lingers right to the end. The comedic
background of the actor helps to lend a dark funniness to the edge.
Crispin Glover ("Wild at Heart"), as Kansas reporter Roy, and Pruitt
Taylor Vince ("Heavy") as Sheriff Eldon Ballard have small, but
significant roles - displaying good humor, too - especially in the
film's shoot 'em up finale. Greg Kinnear gives the right note to his
dual perf as soap star George McCord and his TV doctor
persona. Allison Janney, as George's producer, helps flesh out the
background with a tight, funny performance. Tia Texada ("Paulie") is
both bright and sassy as the Hispanic women who befriends Betty
(remember the heroic act I mentioned?) after "Nurse" Betty saves her
boy friend.</P>
<P>The production team behind the camera complements the telling of this
offbeat tale with a nice harmony. Veteran cinematographer Jean-Yves
Escoffier ("Cradle Will Rock") gives a unique and interesting look to
each locale the characters visit in their separate journeys. Costume,
by Lynette Meyer ("Your Friends & Neighbors"), is sometimes kitschy,
especially with Betty dressed in her waitress outfit looking like
Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz." (To reinforce the Kansas image, Betty
is called "Dorothy" at one point.) Helmer LaBute moves the story and
its characters right along with nary a moment wasted.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a dark, funny, sometimes caustic, comedy that is
a challenge to the mind - something the summer film fling doesn't
often allow - make tracks to the theater and ask to see "Nurse Betty."
It will be the right prescription. I give it an A-.</P>
