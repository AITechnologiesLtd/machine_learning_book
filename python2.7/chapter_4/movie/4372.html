<P>     Black is white and white is black.  It's a clever gimmick, but,
ultimately, as depicted in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, that's all it is.  Once
the premise is set, writer/director Desmond Nakano doesn't know what to
do with it.  Added to that is the consideration that the basic story was
developed in a screenplay written thirty years ago, when the entire
concept would have seemed a lot more radical and original.  Nowadays,
seeing a prosperous black man isn't at all unusual.  Likewise, it
doesn't take much searching to uncover underprivileged whites.</P>
<P>     In order to make it clear what's going on--that the blacks are
the "haves" and the whites are the "have nots"--WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
falls into a pattern of gross stereotyping and oversimplification.
Indeed, without painting characters and situations in the broadest
possible manner, there wouldn't be a concrete way to recognize the role
reversal.  Yet it's this reliance upon archetypes and cliches that
undercuts the film's message.  Something a little more subtle is needed
than a group of black cops beating a white man with night sticks.</P>
<P>     The situation set forth in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN naturally raises a
lot of background questions, none of which are answered.  Are whites a
racial minority, or have they simply been reduced to the lowest rung on
the economic ladder (a sort of South Africa in reverse)?  Were whites
once slaves and blacks plantation owners?  What is the country's
political structure like?  What color is the indigenous population of
Africa?  When you enter the Twilight Zone of an alternate reality, these
are the kinds of things people are interested in, yet this film
sidesteps them all.</P>
<P>     There isn't much of a story in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.  John Travolta,
virtually duplicating his PULP FICTION personae, decides to kidnap black
CEO Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte).  Travolta's Louis Pinnock, who
used to work for Thaddeus' candy-making company, was fired as a result
of a mistake by his bosses.  So, in order to pay the rent and keep his
family together, Louis decides to take matters into his own hands by
demanding his lost wages from the man at the top of the corporate heap.</P>
<P>     The idea of a relationship developing between a kidnapper and his
victim is nothing new, and not much of interest is added here.
Ultimately, however, in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, the race reversal gimmick
overshadows everything.  The director is so busy pointing to skin color
that he loses sight of the characters under the pigmentation.  There's
nothing compelling about either of the leads.  They never connect with
each other or the audience.  Sure, there are some nice touches, like the
scene where Louis teaches Thaddeus the best way to put salt on his
French fries, but there aren't enough moments like that.  It often seems
that there's a good story trying to break free, but WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
is so loaded down by contrivances and the need to get its message across
that it smothers creativity.</P>
<P>     After playing three similar characters in a row (see PULP FICTION
and GET SHORTY), Travolta can probably do this kind of role in his
sleep.  And, of everything the actor has accomplished since Quentin
Tarantino brought him back into the spotlight, this is the least
impressive of his performances.  Harry Belafonte, who has been largely
absent from the screen for the better part of two decades, has chosen an
odd movie for a comeback attempt.  He's okay here, but this isn't the
kind of part that will earn him raves.</P>
<P>     The plot of WHITE MAN'S BURDEN is capable of holding an audience's
attention for most of its running time.  Based on the premise, however,
viewers have a right to expect more than they get.  Skin color swapping
and facile assumptions about the relationship between race and economics
are used more as cheap plot devices than as a basis for a probing
examination of real issues.  While it's the film makers' task to form
something solid and meaningful out of their alternate reality, in this
case, the burden appears to have been too great.</P>
