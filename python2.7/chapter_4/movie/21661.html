<P>I've always loved director Spike Jonze's original music videos ranging from
the Beastie Boys' "Sabotage" to Bjork's "It's so quiet" to Daft Punk's "Da
Funk", so I was one of the first to applaud his transition to movies with
this, his motion picture directorial debut. With Jonze's obvious penchant
for the creative, I expected nothing less that a film that would be unlike
any other. And boy-oh-boy, did he deliver on that expectation.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An unemployed puppeteer finds himself a temporary "regular job" as a file
clerk in an office on the 71/2th floor of a corporate building. One day, he
discovers a tiny door and a room which apparently leads into the brain of
actor John Malkovich, allowing anyone who enters the portal to automatically
be inside the thespian for about 15 minutes before being spit out and onto
the side of a New Jersey Turnpike. Got that?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This is one messed up movie! Messed up in a good way, of course. This is
probably the most creative film of the year with a script loaded with layers
of surreal cream, a cast playing against type and scoring with solid
performances all around, and an inventive look inside the infamous
Wharhol-annointed "everyone will get their 15-minutes of fame" parable. On
top of all that, this film actually makes sense (for the most part) unlike
many of the other "weird" films which attempt to break the calmness of
Hollywood's arrangement with the mediocre (see BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS) and
is genuinely funny! I could see Dali and Frued sitting around with some
over-salsa'd nachos and having a blast with this movie! Oh, and how I
wouldn't mind being a fly on the wall when they attempted to interpret this
film's many zings and zangs. Fry this egg, why don't you.</P>
<P>What was even cooler about this film was that I never knew what was going to
happen next. In fact, its main plot force of a portal leading inside actor
John Malkovich's head was just the springboard from which an even wilder
ride through one's own conscious and subconscious feelings of identity,
life, love and sexuality took form. Wonderfully written, succinctly directed
by Jonze, who could not have picked a more appropriate script for his own
paranormal sensibilities, and featuring an unrecognizable great performance
by Cameron Diaz, another solid show from Catherine Keener, and Cusack
showing us that he can play more than just a wise-cracking smart-ass. It
also needs to be said that actor John Malkovich, besides being a good sport
about the whole thing, plays himself and all the other characters extremely
well, and does quite the job of convincing everyone that he is himself (?).
Looking back, there were no specific scenes in this film which were
particularly memorable, and the script may have gone a little over-the-top
in certain respects (did they really have to be living with a monkey?), but
one cannot blame the genius when running rampant and dropping a couple of
their eccentricities by the wayside. All in all, an entertaining surreal
ball of confusionary psychological fun for the strange one in all of us.
Also, look for a couple of pretty cool cameos by some of Hollywood's
hipsters. Definitely, NOT for everyone!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Spike Jonze's real name is Adam Spiegel. He was born in St-Louis,
Missouri, and recently married the daughter of legendary director Francis
Ford Coppolla, Sofia. This union would make actor Nicolas Cage his
cousin-in-law. Some of you may remember Spike as an actor in this fall's
critically praised flick, THREE KINGS, in which he played Conrad Vig, Mr.
White Trash himself.
Charlie Kaufman's next screenplay is an offbeat romantic comedy called HUMAN
NATURE and will feature Patricia Arquette as a woman with too much body hair
in love with a man with the world's smallest penis who, in turn, is in love
with a perfect French beauty. When a man, raised as an ape, enters the
picture, it throws things out of balance. Spike Jonze will co-produce.
Catherine Keener is married to fellow actor Dermot Mulroney.
Look closely and you will see actor Gary Sinise sitting behind John
Malkovich in one of the pictures of his upbringing, as he and Sinise
co-founded Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre. Malkovich recently broke up a
street fight in Spain and lives in France with his family.
Cameron Diaz was set to play Sonya Blade in 1995's MORTAL KOMBAT, but broke
her wrist prior to filming and was replaced by actress Bridgette Wilson.
Yes, one of the producers of this film is none other than the lead singer of
the rock band R.E.M., Michael Stipe.
Orson Bean, the man who plays Dr. Lester in this film, was blacklisted by
Hollywood in the 1950s.</P>
