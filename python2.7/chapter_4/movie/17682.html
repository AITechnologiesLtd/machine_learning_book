<PRE>                            NEVER BEEN KISSED
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     Wow.  It's only April, and I've already been to *three* proms this
year.</PRE>
<P>     They are: SHE'S ALL THAT, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, and now,
NEVER BEEN KISSED.  All treading some familiar ground: high school
sucks.</P>
<P>     Maybe I can relate, and NEVER BEEN KISSED is certainly the best of
three, but really, if I have to sit through this story line one more
time, well, I'm liable to spike the punch the next time out, just to see
what happens.</P>
<P>     KISSED starts pretty incredulously: we are supposed to believe that
Drew Barrymore is a copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times.  No, that's
not the stretch:  The jaw-dropper is that she has both an office *and*
an assistant!  If you're not in the publishing biz, let me say that
that's about as crazy as Drew Barrymore being the executive producer of
a feature film.  (Uh, wait a second.)</P>
<P>     So here we have a lovable, 25 year-old, copy-editing virgin named
Josie (Barrymore), who is sent--"undercover"--back to high school in
order to get the hot story about today's youth.  Sadly, Josie is a
big-ass loser whose personal freakshow is the best story going.  She's
alienated by the cool crowd, and only when her genuinely cool (but dim)
brother (Arquette) comes to the rescue, is she able to become Miss
Popular (and prom queen to boot).  Never mind also dropping 20 pounds
and getting a decent haircut and some fashion sense.</P>
<P>     There's also a subplot about Josie's somewhat creepy
would-be-affair with teacher Sam (Vartan), but ultimately it's KISSED's
frequent, unapologetic jokes and good-natured fun that redeem it above
its competition.  It may be the same old story, but at least it isn't
completely mindless.</P>
<PRE>     Stay tuned for the sequel: BEEN KISSED ONCE.</PRE>
