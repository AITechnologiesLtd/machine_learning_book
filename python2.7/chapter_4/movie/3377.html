<PRE>                               LOSING ISAIAH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jessica Lange, Halle Berry, David Strathairn,
           Marc John Jefferies, Samuel L. Jackson.
Screenplay:  Naomi Foner.
Director:  Stephen Gyllenhaal.</P>
<P>     It is one of film criticism's most ubiquitous put-downs--one
I frequently use myself--to compare a theatrical feature to a
TV-movie.  Such a description is intended to describe both subject
matter (usually topical or sensationalistic) and manner of
presentation (usually didactic or sentimental).  LOSING ISAIAH has
garnered more TV-movie comparisons than I can count, but the
comparison isn't entirely appropriate.  True, the subject of birth
mother/adoptive mother custody conflict is a television staple;
there were probably three such films on the small screen in the last
month.  But TV-movies generally feature one-dimensional characters
and a specific agenda.  LOSING ISAIAH features one-dimensional
characters and a steadfast refusal to adopt a point of view.</P>
<P>     LOSING ISAIAH opens in 1992 in Chicago's housing projects,
where Khaila Richards (Halle Berry), a young black crack addict,
leaves her infant son Isaiah in a box by a garbage dumpster.  He is
found and brought to a hospital, where social worker Margaret Lewin
(Jessica Lange) becomes attached to the child and decides to bring
him home.  Three years later, Margaret and her husband Charles
(David Strathairn) have finalized the adoption, and Khaila is
struggling to make ends meet after a stint in a rehab program.  Then
she discovers that Isaiah is not dead, as she had believed.
Enlisting the aid of an activist attorney (Samuel L. Jackson),
Khaila decides to attempt to regain custody, prompting a court
examination of race, culture and the best environment in which to
raise a black child.</P>
<P>     The subject of inter-racial adoption is a challenging and
complex one, and no one would expect the makers of LOSING ISAIAH to
deliver the final word on the matter.  It isn't the absence of a
patently obvious opinion from writer Naomi Foner and director
Stephen Gyllenhaal which is the problem, but that there is only a
cursory examination of any of the complexities involved.  The
inevitable court battle features the predictable array of speeches
and finger-pointing, but none of these academic arguments are of
much use to the audience.  We need to see more of Isaiah (the
adorable Marc John Jefferies) interacting with the Lewins, perhaps
even being interviewed so his point-of-view could be understood.
There is an attempt to deal with Isaiah's state of mind in some very
effective late scenes which show him responding to a new
environment, but those scenes are too little, too late.</P>
<P>     Similarly, the characters of Margaret Lewin and Khaila Richards
are not characters so much as they are representatives of the two
perspectives.  Jessica Lange is a dynamic actress, and she pours
tremendous emotion into Margaret; there simply isn't much to her
character, particularly a sense of why this particular child, out of
all those she has seen over fifteen years as a social worker, won
her heart.  Some token marital difficulties are meant to fill in the
blanks, but they don't do the job.  The fact is, LOSING ISAIAH is
far less about the Lewins' life with Isaiah than it is about Khaila,
whose redemption is the heart of the story.  Halle Berry is
impressive in the early scenes as Khaila the addict, but in the
film's later stages she becomes the 12-step version of the "hooker
with the heart of gold," too squeaky clean to be real.  It seems to
be the film's idea of balanced presentation not to give both mothers
a character outside of their fierce conviction that the other one is
wrong.</P>
<P>     Stephen Gyllenhaal's direction is usually best when no one is
speaking.  Two scenes are particular standouts:  one in which Khaila
first sees the 3-year-old Isaiah and follows him to a park, and
later when Margaret and Khaila's black attorney (the under-used
Samuel L. Jackson) share an uncomfortable cigarette break.  Those
scenes, and those from Isaiah's perspective, suggest that if LOSING
ISAIAH had been more intimate with its characters all the way
through, the story could have worked.  As it stands, a controversial
subject becomes a minor plot device connecting the stories of two
rather bland characters.  LOSING ISAIAH's contrived ending is
somehow appropriate for this wishy-washy effort.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 custody battles:  4.</PRE>
