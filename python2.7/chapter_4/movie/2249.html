     A genetically designed guard dog opens a big can of whup-ass on
everyone/everything in sight.</PRE>
<P>Tak Summary (I couldn't resist SOME low-grade guessable spoilers)<HR>     Dogs.  Man's Best Friend.  Trusted for thousands of years to guard
us, guide us, and give us companionship.  But, no, that's not good
enough for the mad dart-gun-wielding doctor (okay, I forgot his name
already ... but is it really that important?  He did play Bishop in the
Alien/s saga ...  good whup-ass there too).  He designs the perfect
guard dog, the Max 3000, a huge St. Bernard with the genetically
inherited speed and climbing of a cougar, eyesight of an owl, abilities
of a chameleon, strength and endurance of a bear, viciousness of some
sort of snake, and a heap of intelligence just for fun.</P>
<P>     Sounds great, right?  Well, apparently the good doctor hasn't
gotten all the kinks worked out yet, for the dog goes dangerously
psychotic and tends to munch on the lab help unless he gets his
periodic tranquilizer shots.</P>
<P>     Which wouldn't be of much concern to us except that Max is freed
from the vivisection-practicing lab by an investigative reporter who
befriends him.  Max, much to her surprise and delight, ends up staying
with her and her animal-disliking boyfriend.</P>
<P>     Max's drugs hold out for the night, so he remains calm.  But the
next morning he's feeling rather frisky: he offs a cat (defying gravity
to do so), a parrot, a mailman, a hydrant (I won't spoil it for ya),
makes two attempts at the reporter's boyfriend, and stops briefly for
some frolicking with a nervous neighborhood collie.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile the reporter (who still thinks Max is a big cuddle
beast) decides to give Max away so he won't be killed, found, or
returned to the EMAX lab. She takes him to a junkyard owner who
apparently has a dog-heaven ranch outside town.  She leaves, and before
she's out of sight, he beans Max over the back o'the head with a shovel
(he coulda used some spider sense ...), and chains him up for a career
as a junkyard dog.  Max will have none of it--he breaks his bonds,
gets a beauty mark, dispatches the owner (guys, you might not wanna
watch this scene ... ouch) and bounds home.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile the doctor has finally convinces the police to stop
investigating him for murder, and has them send the troops after his
million-dollar dog.  The bumbling police arrive just in time to save our
heroine, but not so-in-time for her boyfriend, whose face will never be
the same again (Max must drink too much cranberry juice).  We're then
treated to a five-car chase scene, low-budget car crashes
(fender-benders really), some goofy dog catchers, and the required
computer graphics.</P>
<P>     We pause briefly for breath, then jump right back into the thick
of things with many dead policemen, bullets, more car crashes and a
climactic showdown back at the Lab where it all began.  In true B-movie
style, they manage to include all sorts of goodies in the climax.  They
start with a chase, elbow-fu, projectiles, a car crash.  And it doesn't
stop until they've combined an impressive array of gimmicks, including
a series of chases, rubble, lurking psychotic dogs, the stuffed-dog
variant of the spring-load-cat scare trick, a shotgun, electrocution,
needles, big knives, tense hiding in dark spooky labs, bleeding (lots
of bleeding), a tender moment, and poetic justice by a cute dog that I
thought shoulda shared the parrot's fate.</P>
<P>     The movie ends on a sad note, but then turns things around
with ... anyone? anyone? ... hope for ... anyone? anyone? ... a
sequel!</P>
<PRE>Technical Comments
------------------
     Nothing really obnoxious to got in the way of your enjoyment of
this gem.</PRE>
<P>     Okay, okay. There *was* one bad edit that looked like they dropped
about five frames from a chase scene.  And a tree-climbing scene
reminded me of those old live-actor spider-man movies where you can
just *tell* the camera is sideways.  But that's what makes a truly good
B-movie.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     I do so love bad movies.  This one was a fine example.  It was fun
to watch, the plot was dealt with early on so we could got down to the
action, and we got to laugh, cheer and cringe.</P>
<P>     The blood-splashing was kept to a minimum, mostly at the
beginning.  And they never do show much maiming actually going on ...
just enough to let your imagination do all the work, which I prefer
anyway.  The St.Bernard wasn't actually *shown* attacking complete
people--lots of close-ups of limbs and suggestive action cuts.  But
there was the scene where some kids sic Max on a cat (yea! there's too
many of these foul creatures anyway), where Max ingests the whole cat
in bloodless snake-like fashion.</P>
<P>     They got pretty thick with the animal rights moralizing at times,
(again near the beginning--was their boss watching then?) but it was
bearable.  There were lots of familiar cookie-cutter movie characters,
but that's okay too.</P>
<P>     We hear some classic lines from the doctor: "In the right hands
Max can save lives, but in the wrong hands he can be a deadly weapon."
I've heard *that* one a lot.  The parrot even gets some good wise-cracks
in before he turns into a feathered kibble.  (I wonder if they actually
taught it its lines?)  A security guard with all of three lines gets a
one-liner where he calls the mad doctor "jerk"--I guess you had to
be there.  It did get a chuckle from the audience.</P>
<P>     The plot's not terribly original, and looks rather tattered under
good lighting.  What's up with the laser-sighted dart gun?  Or the
throw-away comment about Max turning on the doctor?  Why'd the police
go from disbelief and laughter to fully supporting the doctor with a
five car chase, a stake-out and blazing guns? Just imagine: "you want
us to shoot the dog??"  But that's just picky afterthoughts.  We don't
need no steenkin plot!</P>
<P>     And the types of -fu were amazing.  We got to see (in alphabetical
order): barrel-fu, bat-fu, brake-line-fu, bullet-fu, cage-fu, claw-fu,
dartgun-fu, elbow-fu, fang-fu, knife-fu, mace-fu, rat-poison-fu,
shotgun-fu, shovel-fu, uric acid-fu, welding torch-fu, and I'm sure I'm
forgetting others.</P>
<P>     A light-hearted, fun, low-gore, love-conquers-all, whup-ass
movie.  Entertainment for the whole family.  This would make a good
installment in your whup-ass matinee diet.  You'll need a break from
all the smarmy feel-good holiday movies coming up anyway.</P>
