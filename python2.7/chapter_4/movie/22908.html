<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A minor noir film, originally made for radio. But its motif, about how
someone can attempt to change his dismal past after getting amnesia, is
pure noir. When Eddie Rice (John Payne), a war hero with the Silver
Star, gets some shrapnel in his brain, he develops amnesia and is being
treated for it in a San Francisco hospital by Dr. Kemble (Crane), who
explains to him that his amnesia will be permanent because it is organic
and not psychological. The doctor tells him, "Since the only thing we
know about you, is that you enlisted in Los Angeles, go back there and
maybe someone will recognize you and you can start your life over as a
new person."</P>
<P>In Los Angeles, Eddie, who is prone to talk to himself, which the viewer
hears as a voiceover, is immediately recognized by the police and told
that he is a gangster named Eddie Ricardi. The police captain, Anderson
(Evans), tells him to get out of Los Angeles, your presence here only
spells trouble. Lieutenant Joe Williams (Rhys), who knows Eddie from
having worked on his case before, doesn't believe his amnesia story and
doesn't believe a person can change and go from bad to good, at least
someone who was as bad as Eddie was.</P>
<P>Eddie meets Nina Martin (Drew) at an orangeade stand, but he doesn't
recognize that she is his ex-wife. She brings him to the hotel he used
to reside in and calls his old crime partner, Vince Alexander (Sonny),
to warn him that Eddie is in town. She now works for him in his casino
and also does odd errands for the crime boss. Vince, when receiving her
call, is busy with a petty criminal, Kelly (Harmon), who just got his
bail bond posted by Nina. He squealed about Vince's slot machine
operation to the police and is being worked over by the boys, who will
then waste him.</P>
<P>When Vince pays Eddie a visit with his henchmen, they rough him up after
telling him only a sucker would come back. Vince tells him I grew up
with you, we took a lot of raps together, and then you turned stool
pigeon on me, turning state evidence on me so that you could beat the
rap, making me serve a two year sentence for manslaughter. He warns him
to leave town or else.</P>
<P>After the beating by Vince, Eddie returns to his hotel room and thinks
to himself, "Why didn't Vince kill me?" "I should call Dr. Kemble!" But
Kemble is not available. So he goes to Nina's luxurious apartment and
tries to tell her that he is a different person, he is now Eddie Rice,
the past is forgotten. She can only tell him that he brought her into
this crime lifestyle and she likes it.</P>
<P>Vince changes his mind about Eddie leaving town and has Nina try and
seduce Eddie to stay in town. But Nina now looks at Eddie differently
and starts to believe that he has changed, as she tells him he better
leave or Vince will kill him.</P>
<P>Eddie foolishly walks into the Golden Horn casino and meets Nina as she
is sweet talking  some fat cat customers, trying to get them to lose
their money at the tables. Vince's boys in the casino take Eddie away
with them, and Vince senses the change of mood coming over Nina and
decides to get her later, after he takes care of Eddie. Meanwhile Joe
Williams has Eddie tailed to the casino and when he goes there to get
him, he is told by Nina that Vince's men have him.</P>
<P>At Vince's place, Williams is getting too close to what Vince is
planning to do to Eddie and is shot by him. Vince has the best line in
the flick, looking at the dead cop, he says, "Just when he was coming up
in the department."Vince, thusly, frames Eddie for the killing, knocking
him out and leaving him where they dumped the cop's body and also
placing Eddie's fingerprints on the murder weapon. The police now want
him for the officer's death, sending out an All Points Bulletin. Eddie
doesn't help matters by robbing a gun store and taking a gun, as he
tries to get away with Nina by his side. She has a shoulder wound from
one of Vince's henchmen, and Eddie decides to leave her with a doctor.</P>
<P>The film's finale is done in grand noir-style, filmed in a Santa Monica
warehouse, where one of Vince's flunkies, Petey, played by the rotund,
minuscule veteran character actor with the high-pitched squeaky voice,
Percy Helton, my all-time favorite bit player, who must have had
thousands of uncredited parts in a variety of films. He is hiding out
with his cat Samson after following Kelly, for Vince, and now he knows
that Vince killed Kelly. Petey wheezes and coughs, reluctantly letting
Eddie into his hideout, then calling Vince to let him know that Eddie is
there.</P>
<P>The final shootout is well-done, as Vince comes looking for Eddie, and
Vince winds up holding a gun to Eddie, using him as a shield to get away
from the police, but Petey distracts Vince, allowing Eddie to go free,
and Vince thereby turns on the police but is shot by them.</P>
<P>In the hospital, Nina and Eddie start over again, hoping that they can
both overcome their past mistakes.</P>
<P>What distinguishes this film as not the normal crime-type of film, with
a happy ending, but as a noir-work, is how it captures the changing
societal attititudes of the protagonists, who desperately want to fit
into postwar American society despite their prior misdeeds. This is seen
mainly through the dark Los Angeles settings depicted by the camerawork
of probably the best noir cinematographer ever, John Alton, and not
through the thin plot structure of the film. What leaves a lasting
impression on the viewer, is the warehouse shootout, as we see these
antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react. The darkness of
Vince's past and current life is contrasted with the John Payne
character, who has a second chance in life to redeem himself, something
noir characters think is impossible for them to ever get. That is the
happy ending here, but its optimism is muted on the belief that his
amnesia is permanent and because of that he won't revert back to his old
self. It all seems credible because John Payne has the look of someone
who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung
out to dry.</P>
