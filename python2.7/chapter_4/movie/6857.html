What do you get when you cross repetitive slapstick and wooden
direction?  Enough to fill a five minute skit.  Unfortunately 'Beverly
Hills Ninja' runs an excruciating eighty eight minutes and its bad
qualities and juvenile antics are visible in the first few minutes
which dominate the entire film.  Chris Farley stars as a ninja wannabe
who becomes involved with a sexy girl and a counterfeiting plot and
ends up on a journey from his Asian home to Beverly Hills, California
where he travels to follow up on a job he's performed for the beautiful
Nicolette Sheridan who plays the girlfriend of the movie's bad guy
who's really out to set him up as revenge for the death of her sister.
Chris Farley has appeared in supporting roles in 'Coneheads' and
'Wayne's World 2' (both 1993) and has since had leading roles
co-starring with fellow SNL comedian David Spade in 'Tommy Boy' (1995)
and 'Black Sheep' (1996).  'Beverly Hills Ninja' will be remembered as
one of the worst films of 1997 and perhaps of all time as Farley
projects a fake wisdom of the ninja culture in his dialogue while
coming off as phony and unfunny.  He just doesn't have it as a
slapstick comic and the entire movie runs like a single handedly played
out Three Stooges skit.  The plot holes and unresolved conclusion will
satisy anyone under the age of 12 and that's fine but is that the
extend of Farley's reach as a comedian?  The repetitive and
outrageously insulting so called gags in 'Beverly Hills Ninja' will not
do much for the career of director Dennis Dugan who made 'Problem
Child' (1990) and the people who will cheer for this movie will be
those who felt that 'Tommy Boy' and 'Black Sheep' were stiffed at the
Academy Awards.</P>
