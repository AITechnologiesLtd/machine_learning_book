MVP: MOST VALUABLE PRIMATE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>The worst hockey team imaginable -- think rejects from THE MIGHTY DUCKS 
-- become winners in Robert Vince's MVP: MOST VALUABLE PRIMATE, thanks 
to the help of a hockey playing chimpanzee named Jack.  (Boy, that's 
original.)  And the movie itself, which starts off as by far the worst 
kids' movie of the year, improves only marginally by the canonical big 
ending game.</P>
<P>Jack, a genius we are told, is the subject of a California college 
class.  After the professor in charge dies in an on-the-screen heart 
attack, Jack, while being chased by an evil college administrator, ends 
up on a Canadian junior B league hockey team called the Nuggets.  Don't 
ask.</P>
<P>Among the story's many problems is the character of the maintenance man 
who is Jack's caregiver.  He is either a cliché of a mentally-deficient 
man for whom we are supposed to feel sorry or a hammy actor whose bad 
slapstick is supposed to make us laugh.  We end up just feeling awkward 
whenever he is on the screen as he speaks in baby talk to Jack.</P>
<P>Excellent hockey player Steven Westover (Kevin Zegers) joins the Nuggets 
after he moves to Canada from California.  Steven lives with his parents 
and his deaf sister Tara, who is played charmingly by Jamie Renée Smith.  
Smith's performance is the only likable part of the entire movie.</P>
<P>The Nugget's practice consists of a half dozen simultaneous wrestling 
matches.  The players are only interested in horsing around and couldn't 
care less if they continue to be slaughtered in every game.  One kid is 
so bored that he knits on the ice.  You'll wish that you had brought 
along your knitting materials to the movie.  During the games, the 
audience likes to throw snowballs at the players, and the guy in charge 
of the music wears protective gear.  In short, the story by Anne and 
Robert Vince is completely ridiculous and far from funny.</P>
<P>The Nugget's goalie is a semi-blind athlete who can't even see the puck.  
His name is -- you guessed it! -- Magoo.</P>
<P>I suppose that if the mere sight of a chimp in human clothes does it for 
you, then you might like this movie.  I've never been a fan of monkey 
comedies, but this is one of the worst that I've ever seen.  If Jack is 
such a genius, why did he agree to be in this stinker?</P>
<P>"You want to go home?" Jack's caregiver asks him, reading Jack's sign 
language.  You'll want to head for home about five minutes into MVP.  I 
wish I could say that this movie should have gone direct to video rather 
than to a theatrical release, but I can't.  The film stock for this 
movie should have gone direct into the incinerator.</P>
<P>MVP: MOST VALUABLE PRIMATE runs 1:33.  It is rated PG for some mild 
language and would be acceptable for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave it just * 1/2, complaining about how stupid 
many of the characters acted, especially the caregiver and the old man 
in the stands.  His friend Steven, age 12, gave it only *, saying that 
he thought it was corny and fake.  Steven's twin, John, liked the movie, 
giving it *** and saying that he liked the way the movie was about 
hockey.</P>
