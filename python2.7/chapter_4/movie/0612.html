                                 MILLENNIUM
                       A film review by Robert Dorsett
                        Copyright 1989 Robert Dorsett</PRE>
<P>     MILLENNIUM starts with an incredibly fake model of a Boeing 747 skipping
the tops of clouds, bumping all over the place.  We go to the cockpit, where
the crew is drawling ATC clearances, and the captain, for some reason, so
senile that he's taking orders from his first officer.  Inexplicably, the
airplane has a mid-air with a DC-10.  On the way down, the flight engineer's
sent to the back.  He returns as promptly, shouting "The passengers are all
dead!"  And thus is the crux of the story.</P>
<P>     Kris Kristofferson plays the chief investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  You know he knows his stuff: he looks
unkempt, walks like he has more aches and pains than James Gardner, and growls
out the smallest line.  When he smiles, it looks like his face is going to
collapse from the effort.  Clearly an expert.</P>
<P>     As he investigates the crash, he discovers various oddities: watches that
run backwards, for example.  And a "thing" that manages to stun him.  </P>
<P>     Spoilers are at the end of this article.  The above makes the plot sound
pretty interesting, right?  *Wrong*.  This is a *horrible* movie.  The pits.
Pure, un- pretentious, regurgitated crap.  The acting sucks.  The direction
sucks.  The production values are non-existent.  The special effects are
laughable.  The dialog is lousy, fake, and contrived.  Technically, the
producers clearly haven't the foggiest idea of how the NTSB works
(Kristofferson to press conference: "We'll have our findings for you in a
couple of days, just hold your questions").  The thing which eventually gets
Kristofferson in hot water with his bosses in Washington is SOP for the "real"
NTSB.  Cheryl Ladd looks like a high-school girl who's just discovered makeup.</P>
<P>     Suffice it to say that this movie isn't worth seeing.  Five minutes into
it, I seriously debated running out and negotiating a ticket-swap with "The 
Package."  This movie is pure trash.  A zero rating (out of four).  An utterly
forgettable movie, one which I am embarrassed to even admit having spent the
time watching.  But even worse, since about a quarter of the movie is run
*twice*, in the form of an alternative-future flashback.  So we get to see the
same, horrible acting and implausible situations for *1/2 the running time of
the movie*.</P>
<P>     In other words, yes, folks, we finally have an SF flick this summer that's
worse (*much* *much* worse) than STAR TREK V (makes STV look like Academy Award
material, folks).</P>
<PRE>Spoilers</PRE>
<P>     The whole point about the movie is that there's this sort of commando team
from the future that runs about picking passengers off doomed airliners,
replacing them with dead bodies.  The idea's to "seed" them in the distance
past or far-off future.  A humanitarian effort, right?  Well, why do they even
bother?  If the passengers are seeded in the far-off future, they're just
fucking up someone *else*'s future.  And seriously, are airline crashes the
most significant tragedy that people 1000 years in the future will be concerned
about?   This is one hole the movie never overcomes.  Nor do they ever explain
why life is such hell in the year 3000.  Nor how the robot at the end is able
to get all misty-eyed and cry.  Now how these jokers are capable of producing
dead bodies that are *identical* with other people (without ever seeing the
subject), yet lack the technology to produce medicine.</P>
<P>     I could go on and on about the incredible conceptual problems in this
flick, but it's simply not worth it.  </P>
