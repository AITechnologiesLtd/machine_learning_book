<P>"I wrote "Scream" to draw attention to itself," said Kevin Williamson in 
a interview earlier this fall. "I sat down and said "All right Kevin, 
stop being an artist, you're unemployed and starving, be a businessman". 
I looked around to see what was missing, what wasn't happening in the 
film market, and decided to take a shot at scary movies. I thought if 
people saw the script they might think I had a voice for something else. 
Then it sold. Who could have dreamed all of this would happen?"</P>
<P>Williamson's basic concept was a great one; a slasher movie populated 
with slasher movie fans who knew all the rules of the genre. No one would 
mistake "Scream" for great art, but the cagey mixture of comedy and 
horror, packed to the hilt with pop culture references, was wildly 
entertaining, and the film blew the roof off of theaters last December. </P>
<P>"Scream 2" was created quickly, both to capitalize on the success of the 
original and to insure the availability of Williamson, director Wes 
Craven ("A Nightmare On Elm Street") and those actors whose characters 
survived the original film. Like the "Star Trek" movies, "Scream 2" 
operates on the assumption that audiences have seen the original and 
remember who's who. For those who came in late, here's a quick refresher 
course. </P>
<P>On the anniversary eve of her mother's murder, Sidney Prescott (Neve 
Campbell) is horrified to learn that two of her classmates were brutally 
killed. In short order, she receives a call from the killer, a movie 
freak who taunts her with questions about slasher films. Sidney barely 
survives an assault from the maniac in a ghost mask, then finds herself 
in the center of a media circus. Tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney 
Cox) relentlessly pursues Sidney and her friends, enlisting the aide of 
Deputy Dwight "Dewey" Reilly (David Arquette) in her attempts to get the 
story. Sidney hates Weathers for cashing in on her personal tragedy with 
a book that questioned her mother's morals and challenged Sidney's 
identification of Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) as the man who killed her 
mom. After a night of incredible violence, Sidney learns that Weathers 
was right.</P>
<P>Jump to a year later, as Sidney attends college and tries to put the 
horror behind her. "Scream 2" begins a few blocks from the school, at a 
sneak preview for "Stab," the film based on Gale Weather's book about the 
murders. The unusually generous promoters pass out Ghostface masks, cowls 
and plastic knives to the excited young audience, who have a ball hooting 
at the cheesy horror film (when the "Stab" heroine receives the initial 
call from the killer and panics, an audience member shouts "Bitch, hang 
up and Star 69 his ass!") until a real killing happens right in the 
theater. For Sidney, Dewey (now a security guard at the college,) fellow 
survivor Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Gale Weathers, the nightmare has 
started again.</P>
<P>Williamson and Craven knew exactly what made "Scream" click, and they get 
the same elements cooking here. Sidney is a drama major and Randy is a 
film student, creating a natural context for the requisite movie 
references and in-jokes. "Stab," the film within a film, offers more 
opportunities for pop culture riffing. Luckily, Williamson was smart 
enough not to overdo the humor. There's lots of laughs in "Scream 2," but 
not so many as to undermine the fear factor. In fact, the attacks are 
actually a bit more intense here than in the original, thanks to some 
innovative set pieces. The ingenious opening in a darkened theater, with 
dozens of audience members dressed as Ghostface, delivers just the right 
blend of horror and giggles. An outdoor scene, with the four survivors 
standing together in an large open area as the killer taunts them by cell 
phone, generates real tension. 
The highlight of the film comes as Sidney rehearses a play, surrounded by 
a robed, masked Greek chorus. Scored by Danny Elfman, the sequence 
becomes more and more surreal as Sidney tries in vain to suppress her 
fear amidst the swirling masked figures. Craven's camera work in the 
segment is exceptional, reminiscent of the best classic horror films.</P>
<P>Despite many strong moments, "Scream 2" is slightly less satisfying than 
the original. There are simply too many characters (when the identity of 
a key character is revealed, my first thought was "now which one was he?
") and the climax of the film is convoluted and awkward. Still, winning 
performances (particularly from Arquette and Cox, who create sparks 
together,) some exceptional set pieces, and the sheer ingeniousness of 
the concept keep the franchise afloat. "Scream 2" may be little more than 
cinematic fast-food, but the stuff is still pretty tasty. </P>
