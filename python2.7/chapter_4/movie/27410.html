<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"Traffic" accomplishes a rare feat indeed. A movie about one of the most 
prevalent issues confronting modern society -- the drug trade -- it 
nonetheless manages to rise above simple proselytising and offers a 
brutally uncompromising, essentially unbiased perspective on its subject 
material. In a world where even the best dramas tend to take sides, this 
is remarkable; even more noteworthy is the fact that it happens within the 
confines of one of the most gripping films of the year.</P>
<P>Directed by Steven Soderbergh, and vastly superior to his crowd-pleasing 
but underachieving "Erin Brockovich", "Traffic" tells three stories about 
lives affected by drugs. These are tangentially connected, but mostly 
stand up on their own -- it would not be difficult to remove any of the 
plotlines from the movie and view those segments in isolation.</P>
<P>In one story arc, Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, an Ohio judge 
who has been named by the President to be the nation's new drug czar -- 
the nominal head of America's war on illegal substances. But unbeknownst 
to Wakefield or his wife Barbara (Amy Irving), their own daughter Caroline 
(Erika Christensen) has been lured into the drug culture.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Douglas' real-life bride Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Helena 
Ayala, whose husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) is secretly one of the 
country's top importers of narcotics. This is revealed to Helena only when 
Carlos is arrested by Agents Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Castro (Luis Guzman) 
following the apprehension of a lower-level dealer (Miguel Ferrer). Helena 
is soon embroiled in Carlos' world when the cartel he worked with 
threatens their son's life to keep Carlos from betraying them to the 
authorities. The only help Helena can turn to seems scarcely preferable -- 
including Carlos' perfidious business partner (Dennis Quaid) and a cunning 
cartel head (Benjamin Bratt).</P>
<P>Finally, there is the tale of Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez 
(Benicio Del Toro), who fights against drug trafficking from his side of 
the border. Javier becomes caught in a war between two cartels (one of 
them Bratt's) and discovers that neither his partner (Jacob Vargas) nor 
the army general who professes to Mexico's biggest anti-drug crusader 
(Tomas Milian) are as dedicated to the task as they would have him 
believe.</P>
<P>Soderbergh's direction stands out in "Traffic". He employs a rigid, 
realistic style which thrusts the audience directly into the drama. Events 
unfold at a sometimes feverish pace, but Soderbergh keeps things lucid, 
often helped by focussing on a handful of very strong characters. He also 
distinguishes each of the three plotlines by filming each of them (or 
rather, each of their principle locations) in a different style. The 
Washington and Ohio locales of the Wakefield storyline look cold and blue, 
reflecting both the bureaucratic nature of the judge's new environment and 
the downward spiral which has gripped his family. The Mexico scenes, on 
the other hand, look hazy and washed out, as though the sunlight is
raining down on the desert and barrios. And the California locations for 
the Ayala segments are more lushly, naturally lit.</P>
<P>Each of the storylines boasts a number of fine performances. Douglas is on 
the mark as a man who is expected to serve a nation, but who finds he 
cannot even help his own flesh and blood. His desperation, as the 
pressures of his job conflict with his desire to heal his family, is 
effectively conveyed. Del Toro, meanwhile, is excellent as a little fish 
in the big and tumultuous pond that is Mexico, unable to completely trust 
anyone and often finding himself on the side of those whose actions seem 
no better than the criminals'. </P>
<P>Zeta Jones is less successful as Helena, her character lacking consistency 
from scene to scene. To an extent, this is because the entire California 
subplot feels a little rushed. Unlike the other two storylines, which 
chiefly concentrate on just one character (Judge Wakefield and Javier 
Rodriguez, respectively), Helena competes for attention with other 
individuals, most notably the entertaining double act of Gordon and 
Castro. Indeed, Cheadle brings such intensity to his role that it seems a 
shame he does not feature more prominently in the film. There is a lot 
happening in the Ayala segments -- legal maneuvering, financial 
maneuvering, Helena's efforts to deal with Carlos' cohorts, the agents'
investigation -- and at times it feels rushed and jumbled. </P>
<P>The same cannot be said of the superb Mexico scenes, which offer a 
blistering look at the blurred line between those who run the country and 
those who run the drugs. Here we see how easy it can be for a lawman to 
abandon his duty and turn the other cheek -- not only because it can be 
tantalisingly lucrative to do so, but because the deck already seems so 
overwhelmingly stacked against him.</P>
<P>The story of the Wakefield family is probably the most familiar and 
accessible to mainstream audiences, and the tale of a girl hooked on drugs 
and unwilling to commit herself to rehab is nothing new. But "Traffic" 
depicts this subplot with such stark honesty that it is far more effective 
than most treatments of the material. What happens to Caroline is horrible 
and sobering. The explanation offered by her boyfriend (Topher Grace, from 
"That '70s Show") for the stranglehold drugs have on the population is 
equally so.</P>
<P>"Traffic" reaches no conclusions, favours no sides. Some aspects of the 
film support the controversial notion of legalising narcotics, and suggest 
that the drug war is futile and doomed to failure. Others offer a spark of 
hope that, slowly but surely, America is winning this most insidious of 
battles. In the end, it is not clear that current policy is at all 
effective, but nor is it indisputably misguided -- the possibility for 
both exists.</P>
<P>What "Traffic" does accomplish is simply to raise the level of awareness 
of just how complex an issue this really is. Politicians and activists who 
attempt to dismiss or address the problem with glib words and handy 
catchphrases are neither helping nor, increasingly, fooling anybody.</P>
