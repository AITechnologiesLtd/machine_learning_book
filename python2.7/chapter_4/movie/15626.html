_Rushmore_ (R) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Of all the surprises to be had in the 93 wild minutes of _Rushmore_, the
biggest comes right at the beginning: the appearance of the Touchstone
Pictures logo.  It's amazing that a Disney subsidiary would produce a film
so decidedly off-center.  It's also amazing that a major Hollywood studio
could produce something so refreshingly original that it almost defies
description.</P>
<P>The quirkiness of _Rushmore_ should come as no shock to anyone who has
seen director/co-writer (with Owen Wilson) Wes Anderson's first film,
1996's quirky and enjoyable trifle _Bottle_Rocket_ (which he also
co-scripted with Wilson).  Like that film, _Rushmore_ has a loose narrative
structure that feels like it finds its way as it goes along.  The film
traces five months in the life of one Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an
eccentric 15-year-old attending posh Rushmore Academy courtesy an academic
scholarship.  However, ever since coming to Rushmore, academics have taken
a backseat to extracurricular activities, and one hilarious montage gives
the rundown of his numerous club affiliations, from the presidency of the
fencing club to beekeeping club.  Closest to his heart, though, is "the Max
Fischer Players"--a theatrical troupe that regularly performs his own
original plays.  (In another memorable scene, the players put on a
production of _Serpico_.)</P>
<P>If there is a central plot thread to _Rushmore_, it is Max's hopeless love
for Rushmore first grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), which
leads him to pull off elaborate schemes to win her favor, but instead he
ends up getting expelled from his beloved school.  While this story, which
is complicated by Max's friend/romantic rival Herman Blume (Bill Murray),
is involving and achieves unexpected moments of poignancy, it is almost
moot--individual moments like the ones touched upon earlier are what matter
here: Max giving a speech to his couldn't-care-less classmates at the
public school; Max and Miss Cross talking for the first time on the
bleachers; Mr. Blume drunkenly taking a dip in his pool during his twin
sons' birthday party.</P>
<P>Of course, the key to the film's memorable moments are the engaging
characters.  Mr. Blume could have been either a stock villain or a pathetic
loser, but Anderson and Wilson give him a nicely human balance, which is
brought to multidimensional life by Murray, who delivers a performance at
turns funny, sad, and strangely likable.  Williams, freed from the junkpile
that was _The_Postman_ displays immense charm and, crucially, strength as
Miss Cross, who still has a torch burning for her dead husband; it's easy
to see why Mr. Blume and Max would fight over her.  But the film's most
fascinating character is Max, flawlessly played by newcomer Schwartzman.
Max may be a loser, but Schwartzman exudes the right mix of intelligence,
youthful naivete, self-deprecating humor, and everyguy likability that
prevents the character from ever coming off as pathetic.  He's the
perfectly unconventional lead for such an unconventional film.</P>
<P>As good as Schwartzman is, the clear star of _Rushmore_ is Anderson, a
young filmmaker with a uniquely warped vision--one that, not so
surprisingly, plays well with film festival audiences, which embraced this
film.  I doubt general audiences will be so receptive to something so far
off the mainstream radar, and it's more than likely that this film's
one-week Oscar-qualifying run will not result in any nods from the
staunchly conservative Academy.  But _Rushmore_ is certain to find its just
rewards in passionate, if somewhat limited, fan base that can appreciate
its singular brand of bizarre brilliance.</P>
