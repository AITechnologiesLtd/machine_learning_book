<P>As part of a community service sentence, Richard (Kenneth Branagh)
becomes the caretaker of Jane (Helena Bonham Carter), a headstrong young
woman stricken with ALS, the degenerative neurological disease better
known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.  It sounds like a garden variety
disease-of-the-week TV movie, but director Paul Greengrass and writer
Richard Hawkins have managed to come up with something fresh and offbeat,
focusing not on Jane's illness, but her desire to lose her virginity
before she dies.  This is not, however, to suggest that the film is a
downer; in fact, the tone of the film is quite light and never sappy,
thanks to the eccentric characters and often comical situations they get
themselves into.</P>
<P>But it's one thing to be offbeat and unconventional and quite another to
be unbelievable, and what keeps the film from truly taking flight is that
too much of Richard's behavior falls under the latter category--namely,
his scheme to rob a bank to buy a gigolo's services for Jane.  In fact,
his main character quirk--to achieve flight with a homemade plane pieced
together from unwanted articles from his past--is also a bit hard to
swallow.  Nonetheless, the film does achieve some emotional resonance,
due to solid performances by the leads (Bonham Carter is especially good,
barely recognizable and completely convincing) and their effortless
chemistry.</P>
