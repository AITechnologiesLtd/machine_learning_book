<P>     THE CROW is a gothic nightmare.  With a view of Detroit that is 
every bit as bleak and dazzling as the urban panoramas presented in 
BATMAN and BLADE RUNNER, this film makes it clear from the outset that 
wherever its flaws may lie, they will not be in the realm of visual 
presentation.  Indeed, not only is THE CROW a feast for the eyes, but 
it collides violently with another sense, utilizing a high decibel 
soundtrack to keep the energy level up. </P>
<P>     There can be few in the audience upon whom the tragic irony of this 
picture will be lost.  Lead actor Brandon Lee met his death in the 
final days of filming, killed as the result of a gun accident while 
acting the part of a man who returns from the dead to avenge his 
murder and that of his girlfriend (the film is dedicated to Lee and 
his fiancee, Eliza Hutton).  It is a case of "art imitating death", 
and that specter will always hang over THE CROW.  Fortunately, 
however, the vision of director Alex Proyas lifts this film above its 
sad history. </P>
<P>      Lee plays murdered rock star Eric Draven, who returns from the grave 
one year following his Devil's Night slaughter.  His task is simple 
and bloody - avenge his death and that of his beloved Shelly by taking 
out each of the four killers.  This he proceeds to do in some of the 
most grizzly manners possible.  Along the way, he teams up with a 
friendly cop (Ernie Hudson) who sympathizes with his goals. </P>
<P>     THE CROW allows no room for the viewer to take a breath, as it 
blazes with breakneck speed from scene to scene.  Proyas displays talent 
similar to that of a John McTiernan or James Cameron in the way he 
packages the action scenes.  This motion picture moves, and that makes 
up for a number of character and plot deficiencies.   </P>
<P>     Admittedly, the appeal of THE CROW is entirely visceral.  There's 
nothing intellectual about frying eyeballs and impaled bodies.  No 
matter how stylish the direction and how captivating the action 
scenes, it's hard to see this film as much more than a highly-
accomplished entry into the "revenge picture" genre.   </P>
<P>     The decision to tell the story - at least in part - from the 
perspective of young Sarah (Rochelle ) is an effective choice.  By 
utilizing her point-of-view, THE CROW attains an emotional level that 
it would not otherwise have reached.  This is one of the few occasions 
when a voiceover works to advance, rather than hinder, the story.  </P>
<P>     Most of the comic relief is provided by Angel David's Shank, but 
this character grows wearisome quickly, and lingers for a few too many 
scenes.  Conversely, we probably don't see enough flashbacks of Eric 
and Shelly together before the violence, although admittedly the 
inclusion of such scenes might have damaged the film's pacing. </P>
<P>     Over the past few years, the flow of action movies has slowed, but 
that hasn't meant an overall increase in quality.  THE CROW is rare 
exception - something that stands out because it's different and 
exciting.  As something that the director and producer finished in 
memory of their young star, this film is a fitting epitaph. </P>
