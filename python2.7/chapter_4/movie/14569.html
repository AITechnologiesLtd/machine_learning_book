<PRE>                          SMALL SOLDIERS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   0 :-) out of 4 for the abuse of toys</PRE>

<P>What promised to be entertaining kids fun, in the name of TOY STORY,
turned out to be a disappointment, with a scary twist. What if your
favourite toys - Care Bears, Barbie dolls, G.I. Joes, Power Rangers or
Transformers were to come to life and start attacking you?</P>
<P>The story begins with a group of toy soldiers who have been
electronically designed to interact with children and each other.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art military-defence CPUs, are mistakenly
introduced into the toys. So it is not surprising that they take a life
of their own, and begin World War III in your backyard. This is where
safety ends and mayhem begins, as small soldiers make weapons of
destruction that can kill a human being – nail guns, bombs and vehicles
wielding sharp utensils. It's surprising that no one actually gets
killed in this movie. It's no longer as simple as a kid choking on a
lego block - these toys fight back. It is sad that SKG has to resort to
guerrilla tactics and the abuse of toys, in order to gain an audience.
Changing a toy into a weapon and representing it to a child is highly
irresponsible. It is one thing to make toys in the image of warfare and
quite another, to make it workable.</P>
<P>If I were a child, I would have nightmares about my toys coming to life
and hurting me. The prime example, is when a girl's collection of
‘Barbie' dolls, come to life and attack her. If you ever had an
inclination to pull a doll's head off, think again, these miniature
demons can do the same to you! There isn't a strong moral lesson at the
end of the movie - the bad toys are destroyed and the good toys sail
away into the horizon. Unfortunately, because this movie needed a good
explanation in order to give some meaning to the mayhem it causes. Not
recommended for young, sensitive mind's who want to keep their sanity
about user friendly toys.</P>
