<PRE>Hideous Kinky ***</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
starring Kate Winslet, Said Taghmaoui, Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan
based on the novel by Esther Freud
written by Billy MacKinnon
directed by Gillies MacKinnon</PRE>
<P>Congratulations to Kate Winslet for defying the odds, by choosing to
play the lead role in the small, but beautiful HIDEOUS KINKY as a
follow-up to her Oscar nominated turn in TITANIC, the highest grossing
and most expensive film of all time. But was this really such a
surprise? Not at all, once you look at the wide range of films that
the British actress appeared in before TITANIC. She showed incredible
talent at a young age in such films as JUDE, HEAVENLY CREATURES and
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY(for which she recieved her first Oscar
nomination).  Her latest, HIDEOUS KINKY, is an exotic odyssey that is
much more than a star vehicle.</P>
<P>HIDEOUS KINKY is not a plot driven movie, but it tells the tale of a
hippie named Julia(Kate Winslet) who has brought her two young
girls(Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan) to Morocco to find peace, love,
and faith in the early 70's. While in London, the children's father
thrives as a poet, Julia has no money.</P>
<P>It is then that she meets Bilal(Said Taghmaoui), a Moroccan ex-con who
is hiding from his past. He wins the affection of Julia and her
children and he becomes like a father to them. Bilal seems to be a
nice man, but he often vanishes at times when he is needed.</P>
<P>For all the wonder of HIDEOUS KINKY, the real pleasure comes from
watching the two little girls onscreen. They both run around screaming
wild phrases like "hideous kinky!"  and each character is a presence
on her own. It is rare for children to dominate a film, especially
when matched up against Kate Winslet, who gives one of her better
performances.</P>
<P>HIDEOUS KINKY reminded me a little of this year's A WALK ON THE MOON,
because both are similar tales of a woman trying to find herself
during the same time period. HIDEOUS KINKY's wondrous soundtrack
combines Moroccan music with 60's hits, and John de Borman's luscious
cinematography makes the film what it is.</P>
<P>Director Gillies MacKinnon(REGENERATION, A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE) has
crafted a spritual gem, scripted by brother Billy. MacKinnon lets Kate
Winslet show depth unseen in TITANIC, and he shows a talent for
working with young actors. As for the film's title; it's a bit
misleading, and I still haven't figured out what it means. But HIDEOUS
KINKY is an independent film that takes us to places we've never been.</P>
