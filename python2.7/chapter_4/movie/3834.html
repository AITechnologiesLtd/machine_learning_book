<P>     It's said that the worst thing for a parent is to watch the burial 
of their child.  But what about watching the burial of someone murdered 
by their child?  In Rafal Zielinski's insightful and unsettling FUN, the 
premise is that two teenage girls meet, form an immediate friendship, 
and go in search of something "important" to share.  That "something" 
becomes the brutal and conscienceless slaughter of an elderly woman 
whose only crime was to trust them. </P>
<P>     FUN is presented in two time lines:  the present, when Hillary 
(Renee Humphrey) and Bonnie (Alicia Witt) have been tried, convicted, 
and sentenced; and the past, when events before and after the murder are 
recounted in flashbacks.  Although the different time frames are 
interleaved, there's little opportunity for confusion.  The sequences in 
the correctional institute, which feature Hillary and Bonnie's 
interactions with a counselor (Leslie Hope) and a magazine reporter 
(William R. Moses), are in black-and-white, while the flashbacks are in 
color.  Not only do the different cinematographic styles separate time 
periods, they emphasize tone.  The "fun", reckless day of freedom is 
saturated by color; the aftermath is presented in bleak, monochromatic 
16 mm. </P>
<P>     The meat of the story focuses on the psychology of the girls' 
actions.  Together, neither is likely to commit such a crime, but, as a 
pair, they become lethal.  There is no guilt or remorse.  The killing -- 
a bloody, sadistic crime -- is shrugged off as just another way to enjoy 
life.  It's the source of an adrenaline rush, a way to get high without 
drugs.  It forges the kind of permanent bond in a new friendship that no 
mundane act can accomplish.  And it's a way for the killers to prove to 
themselves that they exist outside the boundaries of normalcy. </P>
<P>     Hillary and Bonnie's friendship is neither traditional nor healthy.  
>From the moment they meet, the pair experience a mutual, instant 
connection.  The gradual development crucial to most relationships is 
bypassed.  This is love at first sight, and it leads to one intense, 
passionate day of sharing everything -- life stories, secrets, and a 
murder.  There is no moderation, and the desperate neediness with which 
these two interact is disturbing.  Hillary and Bonnie are no longer 
individuals -- they have acquired a single, psychotic identity. </P>
<P>     Character development in FUN is superior.  Not only does Zielinski 
delve into the personalities of his protagonists, but he gives us random 
pieces of information to flesh out the less important characters.  The 
counselor, for example, is not just a mouthpiece of judicial platitudes 
-- she's constantly fighting to overcome a misspent past.  And the 
journalist, despite the scavenger-like nature of his job, learns to care 
about the subjects of his latest article. </P>
<P>     But, of course, everything comes back to Hillary and Bonnie, and 
the marvelous manner in which their characters are written and realized.  
These girls have deeply rooted problems.  As a child, Hillary was 
repeatedly sexually abused by her father, and it's indicative of her 
nature that she claims he didn't hurt her -- he just raped her.  Bonnie, 
with a wild, flamboyant personality that contrasts with her friend's 
introspective moodiness, is desperately in need of love, and will do or 
say anything to get it. </P>
<P>     Obviously, there will be no Academy Awards for FUN; even if it had 
a U.S. distributor (which it doesn't), this isn't the sort of movie to 
attract the necessary publicity.  That said, however, Alicia Witt's 
remarkable performance is far better than that of most Oscar winners.  
Renee Humphrey is good in her own right, but she is constantly eclipsed 
by her co-star.  Only when the two girls are separated does the strength 
of Humphrey's performance come across. </P>
<P>     Zielinski has a tremendous sense of mood and atmosphere, and he 
uses all the tools at his disposal to fashion the perfect tone.  His 
choice of music ranges from the heavy metal rock of a group called the 
Armagedoon Dildos to the classical strains of Handel's MESSIAH (this is 
probably the most unique usage ever of the choral "And He Shall 
Purify").  The camera work is impressive, and the choice of mixing color 
and black-and-white works to better effect here than in MRS. PARKER AND 
THE VICIOUS CIRCLE. </P>
<P>     With themes and ideas in common with the likes of HEAVENLY 
CREATURES, HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and 
Kieslowski's A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING, FUN is an example of a motion 
picture willing to tackle more than one thought-provoking concept.  The 
intelligent, gripping result succeeds impressively, and presents a more 
complete and provocative portrait of relevant issues than any of those 
films.  Above all, however, FUN gives us a chance to peer into the 
psyches of two memorable characters.  The images we come away with will 
not soon be forgotten. </P>
