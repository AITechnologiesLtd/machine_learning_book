<P>In 1996, screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven created 
"Scream," a low-budget slasher film that revitalized the horror genre, due to 
its innovative approach of having the characters be "in-the-know" about the 
conventions of movies concerning killers hacking away at nubile victims, so 
when a psycho really does begin to dispatch of the teenage residents in the 
town, they know how they should handle it. But even more than that, "Scream" 
was the very first horror movie in a long time that was actually smart, 
scary, and genuinely suspenseful, a twist on the "stalk-and-slash" films from 
the late-'70s/early-'80s. The $14-million picture ultimately went on to gross 
$103-million, a whopping number that is virtually unheard of for this type of 
movie. </P>
<P>But lightning struck twice, as "Scream 2," with most of the same cast and 
crew, was released exactly one year later, in 1997, and set new box-office 
records on opening weekend. The $25-million sequel ended its cume at 
$101-million, but while making virtually the same amount as its predecessor, 
the film left audiences divided, with some saying it was actually superior, 
while leaving others a little disappointed. My opinion fits somewhere in the 
middle--while "Scream 2" didn't even come close to the level of ingenuity 
that the first one had set, and was more than a little sloppy, looking as if 
it had hurriedly been thrown together (with 11 months, 3 weeks separating 
their releases, it was), it still had enough of its token wit and intensity 
to be a satisfying venture. </P>
<P>Over two more years have passed, but the (supposed) final film in the 
financially and creatively successful trilogy, "Scream 3," has arrived, and 
to say it was well worth the wait would be an understatement. Despite the 
disappearance of Williamson in the screenplay credit (Ehren Kruger was handed 
the writing reins), Craven has remained faithful as the top-notch filmmaker 
of the series, as have ongoing stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, 
David Arquette, and Liev Schreiber. And, in its own way, "Scream 3" is a 
groundbreaking motion picture itself--a second sequel that has somehow 
accomplished the daunting task of being every bit as fresh and thoroughly 
gratifying as the now-classic film that started it all. The hanging story 
threads from the previous ones are brought to the forefront, as the natural 
evolution of the characters, as well as the series itself, skillfully comes 
around full circle.</P>
<P>It has been several years since the bloodbath that occurred at Windsor 
College, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) now lives in a secluded, rural, 
Californian home, working from her house as a crisis hotline counselor under 
a false name. Unable to lead a regular life anymore, and plagued with 
nightmares of her deceased mother, Maureen, Sidney is distraught to find that 
one of the people from her past has been murdered (seen in the token opening 
death scene) in Hollywood, where "Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro" is well 
underway in its production on a studio backlot. Determined cutthroat news 
reporter Gale Weathers, who now hosts a television show called "Total 
Entertainment" after her brief gig on "60 Minutes II" fell through, is 
contacted by Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) to join him in his 
investigation of the multiple murders. Illegally getting onto the set of the 
film, Gale has a surprise run-in with Dewey Riley (David Arquette), recently 
retired from the police force due to his handicap, and currently an advisor 
for the movie. Although they briefly had a relationship with each other after 
the goings-on in Part 2, their varied personalities have since broken them 
up, but it is obvious the spark between them is still very much alive.</P>
<P>One of the elements that is so ingenious in "Scream 3," however, is in its 
movie-within-a-movie approach (there is a stunning, showstopping sequence in 
which Sidney finds her way to the sets from the production, which are the 
spitting image of real places in her hometown of Woodsboro), and in the way 
the mystery killer--once again dressed in that spooky Ghostface 
costume--kills off the characters, which is by the order in which they are 
whacked in "Stab 3." Adding confusion to the mix, (1) three different 
versions of the screenplay were created, in order to throw off Internet fans, 
but it is unclear which one the killer has gotten ahold of; and (2) with the 
real Gale, Sidney, and Dewey, as well as their three actor counterparts, in 
Hollywood together, will the killer want to get rid of the real people, the 
performers portraying them, or both?</P>
<P>Whereas any old second sequel to a slasher franchise would be more than 
showing its age by now, "Scream 3" is that rare case in which it is not 
merely here to cash in on the big bucks, but was all along planned as a 
trilogy. One could possibly question if this is actually true, or just an 
excuse by the filmmakers once the original struck paydirt, but "Scream 3" 
does a fabulous job of wrapping things up and filling in the missing pieces, 
all the while delivering what fans have grown accustomed to--scares, snappy 
dialogue, believable characters, and some sort of unique spin on the 
otherwise cliched formula. While "Scream 2" was the most straightforward of 
the series, in terms of its violence and occasionally messy plot 
developments, "Scream 3," like its 1996 precursor, is a multi-layered 
funhouse of chills that does a more-than-sufficient job of keeping the 
surprising twists coming, and the final unveiling of the killer is not only 
unanticipated, but the details for his/her motive come off as more plausible 
than they have any right to be.</P>
<P>Aside from the aforementioned scene where Sidney stumbles upon the movie sets 
and, subsequently, is chased by the killer as she relives her past, there is 
a clearly innovative and exciting sequence coming every ten to fifteen 
minutes. The 35-minute climax, set in an eerie mansion, complete with secret 
passageways and dark corridors, is literally non-stop in its intensity, and 
in the perverse fun Craven, Kruger, and the gang are obviously having. 
Moreover, the in-jokes about moviemaking and Hollywood are occasionally 
satirical and often biting, with a few people turning up in enjoyable cameos. </P>
<P>Neve Campbell, fresh-faced and well-cast in "Scream," has done nothing but 
develop into an even more talented actress with clear star qualities within 
the last three-and-a-half years. Wisely choosing to downplay the sullen 
Sidney from the middle chapter, her character is now a young woman stuck in a 
rut in her life, filled with understandable paranoia that she can never be 
safe until she has completely disappeared from the rest of the world. The 
progression Sidney goes through is both touching and truthful, and Campbell 
is able to surpass her performances in both of the other pictures.</P>
<P>Courteney Cox Arquette, now married to co-star David Arquette, are both up to 
par with their consistently entertaining turns as Gale and Dewey. Of the 
three central characters in the series, it is Gale who has gone through the 
most changes. Starting off as a fairly heartless wench in "Scream," Gale was 
still very much ruthless in "Scream 2," but her sweet relationship with Dewey 
humanized her character into a slightly warmer individual. In the latest 
addition, Gale has finally learned there is more to life than just getting a 
juicy story, and helping out the police in the investigation of the 
increasing death toll, and rekindling her romance with Dewey, are now the two 
things most important to her.</P>
<P>A wide array of new faces are introduced, as usual, and the actors all have 
great fun. The highlight is easily Parker Posey, as Jennifer Jolie, a vapid, 
relatively ditzy actress who has been cast in the Gale Weathers role, and 
takes pride in portraying the character even better than Gale herself. Posey 
is a comic delight, as usual, and she single-handedly steals almost all of 
the scenes she is in. Relatedly, there is a very funny rapport that develops 
between Jennifer and Gale, who are stuck together like glue through the 
second half. When it is Gale who is to die next in the script, Jennifer 
figures that if they are always side-by-side, the killer will just attack 
Gale and leave her alone.</P>
<P>Also in a memorable appearance is Jenny McCarthy, as Sarah Darling, an aging 
35-year-old starlet tired of always being cast as teenagers and especially 
angered that her character in "Stab 3" only appears in two scenes and then is 
killed off (Guess which real actress appears in only two scenes in "Scream 3" 
and is killed off?). Rounding out the cast is Patrick Dempsey, nice to see 
after a sizable absence from the spotlight, as Detective Kincaid; Scott 
Foley, big-headed and appropriately pretentious, as "Stab 3" director Roman 
Bridger; Emily Mortimer as Angelina Tyler (Sidney in "Stab 3"); the 
always-beguiling Matt Keeslar as Tom Prinze (Dewey in "Stab 3"); and Lance 
Henriksen as Sunrise Studios producer John Milton (who may or may not have 
known Maureen Prescott years before). Also showing up is Liev Schreiber, the 
fourth returnee from the other "Scream" movies, as Cotton Weary.</P>
<P>In the director's chair, Wes Craven has somehow been able to keep the energy 
level as high as possible in "Scream 3," as if it was the first movie he has 
directed in the series. This being his third go-round, in retrospect, may 
actually be nothing but a positive thing, as Craven has treaded similar 
horror territory so many times in the past that he could do it in his sleep. 
What cannot be denied is that Craven is a master at setting up absorbing 
horror set-pieces, and no matter what, is constantly adding a stylish flare 
to the proceedings. </P>
<P>With the wholeheartedly satisfying conclusion of "Scream 3," perhaps the most 
widely popular horror movie series of all time has come to a close. The way 
each of the surviving characters' lives receive closure is an excellent 
touch, and the final few shots are filled with subtle, yet remarkable power. 
Who would have guessed that the ending of a film called "Scream 3" could be 
so poignant? Certainly not I, but it is. Now how's that for an unexpected 
twist?</P>
