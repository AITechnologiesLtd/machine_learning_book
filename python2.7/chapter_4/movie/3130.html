<P>     If you've seen TRAPPED IN PARADISE, you have my sympathy.  (Or
would condolences be a more appropriate term?)  One piece of advice,
though: in no circumstances, even under threat of torture, admit to
anyone that you were suckered into seeing this, one of the worst movies
of the year.  Then again, if you actually endured all one-hundred
eleven minutes of this motionless picture, there's probably little
anyone can do to you that would be less pleasant.</P>
<P>     Okay, so perhaps that's overstated, but words like "bad,"
"ill-conceived," "unforgivable," and even "putrid" don't do the film
justice.  Except for one laugh--and a pretty feeble one at
that--TRAPPED IN PARADISE is devoid of any characteristics that even
the most undiscriminating movie-goer hopes for in a film.  On top of
all this, the production is unnecessarily long.  In this case, less
would have been a whole lot more--or at least a whole lot more easily
endured.</P>
<P>     The storyline is a sloppy and ineffective mixture of failed
slapstick, humorless jokes, stock characters caught in predictable
situations, and feeble attempts at mawkish sentimentality.  TRAPPED IN
PARADISE centers on an inept bank robbery pulled by the three Firpo
brothers (Bill, played by Nicolas Cage; Dave, played by Jon Lovitz; and
Alvin, played by Dana Carvey) in the small, postcard-perfect town of
Paradise, Pennsylvania.  Masked to avoid recognition, Bill and Dave
burst into the bank, while Alvin waits behind the wheel of the getaway
car.  Things immediately start going wrong, and they get worse during
the high- speed chase that ensues.  Alvin crashes the car and the trio
finds themselves without an escape vehicle.  But the citizens of
Paradise are a neighborly lot, and the car-less brothers are invited to
Christmas dinner by the man who rescues them from the accident, and who
also happens to be the son of the man whose bank they just robbed.</P>
<P>     The quality of this film, with its formula car chases, endless
running around, and incredibly moronic protagonists, is an all-time low
for a Three Stooges takeoff.  None of the actors acquit themselves even
passably.  Even the normally-reliable Nicolas Cage looks like a man
aware that he's on the deck of a sinking Titanic.</P>
<P>     Actually, Cage's presence, along with the repeated use of the sign
"Welcome to Paradise," may conjure up images of the far superior RED
ROCK WEST, which was also about being stuck in a small town.  The best
solution for anyone intrigued by the premise of TRAPPED IN PARADISE
would be to rent the John Dahl noir thriller.  It would certainly save
a lot of grief.  TRAPPED IN PARADISE is, after all, a horrible
misnomer.  Even Dante's seventh circle of Hell isn't this
inhospitable.</P>
