<P>PLOT:
A media-savvy cop joins a young arson investigator on a case featuring two
nasty Eastern European immigrants searching for their fifteen minutes of
fame.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very original and timely movie which connects on various levels. Now I
know that I've said this before but here's yet another great performance by
Robert DeNiro, charismatic, funny and as intelligent as ever, an interesting
script which takes the "hot" elements of the day and turns them into a
digestible story and even a little bit of action and humor. In fact, I
probably wouldn't know how to qualify this movie exactly, but one thing that
I can say about it is that it'll definitely have you talking. It'll have you
talking about its meaning, its truth, its fiction, its message, its
reality...pretty much everything that the film tries to address. Unless of
course, you think the movie sucks, in which case, I doubt you'll care to
look over any of it... :)</P>
<P>You see, this film is basically about busting the balls of all the "good
folks" in the media who cannot seem to look past their ratings to ask
themselves if what they're doing is right. Is what they are doing the right
thing to do? Should they be setting couples up on an island filled with
pretty single people just to see if anything will happen? Should they be
showing live child-births on TV? (for journalistic purposes, of course) And
ultimately, what are we gonna do once things start getting really out of
hand? What are we gonna say to live executions on the air, a hostage
negotiations gone awry or maybe even the telecast of an actual murder. Is
that newsworthy? Perhaps...but does that mean that we need to show it on TV?
Has the media lost all sense of decency, morality and self-control? Well, I
won't bore you too much with my own opinion regarding all of this stuff,
other than to say that I am very much against the sacks of human garbage who
continue to propagate this type of sensationalistic so-called "journalism",
but that's another story and column altogether. <Now back to your regularly
scheduled movie review></P>
<P>This movie softly touches on all of these questions and concerns, and does
so in a very convincing and entertaining manner. It reveals all of the
hypocrisies by which most of these people live, and also exposes the
manipulative ways by which many of them achieve their goals. Sure, there are
a few weak spots in the script, with the impulsive "bad guys" always seeming
to be one step ahead of their "good guy" counterparts, despite their obvious
nonchalance, and a certain amount of farfetchedness in their ultimate goal,
but overall, I bought most of it with a mighty big spoon. Another great
thing about this movie was its element of surprise. There I was sitting in a
theatre and literally not knowing what would happen next. Quite the unusual
position to be in, let me tell you. It was refreshing to watch a movie in
which originality actually replaced cliches and the characters helped guide
you through their world of real emotions. What else can I say about this
movie? It's basically got a lot of different elements working within it and
most of them worked for me. There are touches of humor, some cool action
scenes, a genuine sense of unpredictability, a little romance, an undeniable
message and many questions left to be discussed. In fact, how many movies
can you name that are actually able to entertain and make you think and
engage in conversation at the same time? Not many, eh? Well, for me this
movie was one of this year's early nice surprises. You go, Bobby!!</P>
