My Dog Skip</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Sweet and schmaltzy, 1940's small town America. Formulaic, aside from an
abrupt slap in the face that comes out of left field to solidify this
endearing tale (or is that tail?).</P>
<P>A warm homey opening sequence brings us gently to Harry Connick Jr's first
word, "Memories" which breaks the dawn into a mellifluous yarn of a young
boy desperately in need of a best friend. Though Connick never appears in
picture, his voice shapes and buffs its glossy finish.</P>
<P>Like "October Sky," our young boy is parented by a stern (but underlyingly
loving) father and a strong demonstrative mother. Kevin Bacon finds his part
a bit awkward at first, leaving one hoping a Jon Voight or Christopher
Walken would have taken the role, but eventually Bacon hobbles up to the
call. (Don't get me wrong, I like Bacon ... it's just that he looks less
like a stern parent than he does an innocent kid.)</P>
<P>The mother also, is almost too beautiful, but does well with an undemanding,
standard role. Frankie Muniz, as the nine-year-old Willie Morris, is
charming. And Skip, well, everyone will leave the theater wanting to take
him home.</P>
<P>Very good, but a bit slow in the first half coupled with Bacon's shaky
start, I contemplated giving this picture a "B+." But, admittedly the
charming mutt and ensemble succeeded at choking me up more than just once
while cajoling an impressive round of applause from the handful of paying
customers at its conclusion. So, I rounded up! If you've got a 5 to 10 year
old, take a family trip to see this wholesome story.</P>
