 Where the Heart Is (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Natalie Portman,
Ashley Judd, Stockard Channing, Sally Field, Joan Cusack and James
Frain. Written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel from the novel by
Billie Lett. Directed by Matt Williams</P>
<P> "Where the Heart Is" is a movie overflowing with heart.</P>
<P> Based on the novel by Billie Letts, and popularized as one of Oprah's
Book Club selections, the story is the odyssey of Novalee Nation, from a
17-year-old girl pregnant and abandoned at a Wal-Mart in the middle of
nowhere Oklahoma, to a self-sufficient single mother who discovers her
self-worth and true love.</P>
<P> Yes, I know, it sounds hokey, cliched. And to a small extent it is.</P>
<P> But the warm-hearted screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who
have co-authored "Parenthood", "City Slickers," "A League of Their Own"
and "EdTV," among others, transcends the familiar.</P>
<P>The characters in "Where the Heart Is" are compassionate, loving and
caring. You root for them, you like them.</P>
<P> Director Matt Williams makes an auspicious debut behind the camera. He
took what could have been an overly schmaltzy pot-boiler and gives it
respectability by not being condescending to his protagonists. He has
genuine affection for these characters and it is evidenced throughout.</P>
<P> Call me a sentimental softy, but I enjoyed "Where the Heart Is." And
the reason is the cast.</P>
<P> Natalie Portman, in her first real adult role, brings a childlike
understanding to Novalee. George Lucas' Queen Amidala grows from a
plucky, but frightened teen-ager to a wise young woman who overcomes her
self-doubts about her status on the social structure. She is a woman who
grows to realize that she has earned the right to accept love.</P>
<P> A wonderful supporting cast of women surround Portman, most notably
Ashley Judd as Lexie who finely blends comedy and pathos as the single
mom of five who always is finding the wrong man.</P>
<P> The always-grand Stockard Channing plays the loving Sister Husband who
takes in Novalee and treats her and her baby like family. Channing is
such a sharp actress that she can take what is a Shirley MacLaine-"Steel
Magnolias"-type of small-town eccentric and elevate the character into a
full-bodied individual filled with kindness and charity.</P>
<P> In a smaller role Joan Cusack delivers some comic moments as a
Nashville music promoter, while Sally Field is flinty in a brief cameo
as Novalee's wandering mother.</P>
<P> James Frain is touching and warm as Forney, who runs the town library
and falls in love with Novalee and her daughter. Frain, best known for
playing pianist Daniel Barenboim opposite Emily Watson in "Hilary and
Jackie," at first is a bit caustic and snobbish. But he softens and
becomes more sympathetic as the movie progresses.</P>
<P> "Where the Heart Is" will delightfully surprise you. It's a film that
elicits smiles. And if you own shares of Wal-Mart stock, get ready to
earn some dividends. After Where the Heart Is, every woman is going to
want to deliver her baby in Aisle 4.</P>
