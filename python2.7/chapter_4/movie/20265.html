<P>Mystery Men
Starring Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo,
Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush
120 Minutes Long, Rated PG-13 for some violence and crude humor.</P>
<P>Mystery Men is a very innovative and clever comedy that benefits from
a wonderful cast.</P>
<P>   Every summer we always get hit by the big blockbuster films that have
special effects and a big name cast.  And every summer we always see these
films get toasted by critics and never live up to their full potential.  At the
beginning of the summer, Mystery Men was shaping up to be another
blockbuster film with a great cast, and we were waiting to see if it would fail
or not.  Unfortunately, this clever comedy got lost in the mix of The Blair
Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  What got lost was a very clever
and innovative comedy, which spoofs superhero films.
   The graphics in this film are great and add to the spoof.  They are very
colorful and outrageous, which adds to the comic book feel of the film.  It is
in a futuristic setting with Captain Amazing, played by Greg Kinnear, as the
protector of Champion City.  Then, there is the trio of Mr. Furious, The
Shoveler and The Blue Raja, played by Ben Stiller, William H. Macy and Hank
Azaria, respectively.  They are the superhero wannabes.  Things go afoul when
Captain Amazing starts to lose popularity.  He has done such a good job that
there are no superheroes left to take out.  Therefore, Captain Amazing sets up
a plan to set his arch-nemesis, Casanova Frankenstein, played by Geoffrey Rush,
free.  Chaos ensues as Casanova traps Captain Amazing and it is up to the
wannabes to help Captain Amazing.  They do some recruiting and eventually add
Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Spleen (Paul Reubens), The Bowler (Janeane
Garofalo) and The Sphinx (Wes Studi) to their team.  
   As stated before, the cast is nothing short of excellent.  Movies can
always enlist A-List celebrities, but they need to mesh in order to be
successful.  In Mystery Men, the cast blends perfectly.  Ben Stiller and
Janeane Garofalo are the perfect combination and they interact terrifically.  
Hank Azaria stands out as well as The Blue Raja, whether it be practicing his
cutlery or arguing with his mother.  William H. Macy gives another strong
performance as The Shoveler, and his demeanor and wit will have you chuckling
throughout the film.  But perhaps the funniest performances come from Paul
Reubens, a.k.a. PeeWee Herman, and Wes Studi.  Reubens plays the flatulent
Spleen and Studi plays the &quot;prophetic&quot; Sphinx.  These performances
are great and contrast the clever humor of the rest of the cast perfectly.
   Unlike Ben Stiller's last comedy, There's Something About Mary,
Mystery Men is a clever and innovative comedy.  It will not have you
rolling in the aisles, but you will still be impressed and laughing.  
   Are there any problems with this film?  Of course.  This could have been
a great film, but despite the two-hour length, it could have benefited by being
longer.  The script is underwritten due to the great cast.  They are so funny
they need more time.  Kinka Usher, the director of this film, tries to get each
cast member his or her own amount of screen time, which takes away from the
film.  In particular, Stiller and Macy could have used more screen time, along
with Janeane Garofalo.  Despite all of this, the rest of the cast usually
delivers with comedy when they are featured on screen.
   And the other detraction from Mystery Men is the ending.  The
spoof ends in the last ten minutes.  Instead of having a spoof ending, which
would have been funnier, they have a typical superhero ending.  In this case,
each member of the cast gets to shine in their own particular way.  This
detracts from the rest of the film considering the rest was a spoof.
   Overall, Mystery Men is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a
spoof of not only superhero films, but also blockbusters as a whole.  This may
be one of the few A-list casts that meshes together so well, so you do want to
check this film out.  Unfortunately, stiff competition from films like The
Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense and Runaway Bride will
keep Mystery Men from achieving the box office results that it truly
deserves.</P>
<P>Rating: 3 Stars Out of 4 Stars.
