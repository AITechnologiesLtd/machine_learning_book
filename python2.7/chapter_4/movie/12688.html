<PRE>Cool World (1992)
1/2 *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Wretched, supposedly fanciful combination of animation and live
action that puts a fat nail in Ralph Bakshi's career coffin.</P>
<P>COOL WORLD was stalled and then re-started when ROGER RABBIT took theaters by
storm. Based on what's on screen, it should have remained stalled. It's a
haphazardly-assembled movie that nobody thought very much about,
except in how it would look. And even there they didn't do much thinking.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt (called Frank Harris) opens the movie, shortly after "the war".
After coming home, he rides on a motorcycle with his mother, gets into an
accident, and somehow manages to breach a path into a parallel dimension
called, none too surprisingly, Cool World. The inhabitants are cartoons,
called Doodles -- although based on the mouth/dialog mismatch, I suspect they
were originally called Toons before the ADR people decided to avoid trouble.</P>
<P>Flash-forward. Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne) is a comic-book creator who's about
to get out of prison. We learn though various incompetently-placed bits and
pieces of exposition that he landed there when he murdered the guy who was
duking his wife, although like a lot of things in this movie, that kind of
behavior is not shown to really be a part of his personality. It's just sort
of dropped in. But Deebs has bigger problems: he keep sliding back and forth
between reality and the world of his comics, which is, of course, Cool World.
And then one day he lands there for keeps, and is instantly hit upon by
sexbomb Doodle Holli Would ("realized" by Kim Basinger, who has gone on to
prove that she is, in fact, a very capable actress).</P>
<P>COOL WORLD tries to set up the "rules" about its universe and falls flat on
its face. For instance, Doodles and humans are never supposed to have sex, for
reasons that are never made clear. Worse, the consequences of such intercourse
are depicted later in the movie, but they're so confusing and nonsensical that
we don't even care.</P>
<P>The movie's look is frantic and inconsistent. Bakshi's animation has never
been long on clarity, and COOL WORLD looks like a hashish-crazed version of
those Jack Davis cartoons in MAD, where grotty-looking maniacs all chase each
other around the room. The art direction, staging, 'tweening, and everything
else are pitched so hard and so far over the top that it's impossible to FOCUS
on anything. There is less imagination at work here than
anthologizing. Everything looks bizarre for the sake of being bizarre, and the
"ironic" contrasts (the little fluffy bunnies, etc.) are just witless.</P>
<P>The live-action backdrops also don't look credible. Bakshi, in an interview,
lovingly described how the sets were created by simply projecting cels of
animation onto them and then having the builders paint using the projections
as guidelines. The results aren't like a cartoon come to life; they look like
a very bad set for a school play. One of the walls vibrates disturbingly when
Pitt throws Byrne against it.</P>
<P>The story shows the signs of a script, and a movie, that were hacked to shreds
and then pieced back together on the editing table. An interesting way to find
out about tampering is to read the comic-book tie-ins or novelizations of
movies: you frequently see a lot of material that existed in the shooting
script, provided to the artists or writers of the tie-ins, but never made it
to the screen. COOL WORLD's tie-ins not only have a totally different ending,
but show the fingerprints of meddling all the way through. At no point, I
guess, did anyone take a look at his story and decide it simply wasn't enough
-- that there needed to be a clear line of logic from beginning to end, that
the characters had to be motivated by other things than passing whims, and
that we get more out of the movie than a juicy headache.</P>
<P>Ralph Bakshi seems to have been an artifact of a very particular time. His
earlier movies, like HEAVY TRAFFIC and STREET FIGHT, were inconsistent, but
also funny and nasty in hallucinatory ways. Then he tried to create more
upscale work, like the spastic WIZARDS and the over-touted LORD OF THE RINGS
productions. Now this. He hasn't done anything since, has he?</P>
