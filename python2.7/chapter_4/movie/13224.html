<P>In 1990, first-time director Whit Stillman gave us one of the best films of
the year, Metropolitan. For those who pay attention to the occasional wheat
of independent filmmakers over and above the  regular chaff of Hollywood,
Metropolitan was a revelation. It received one  Oscar nomination, for
writing.(The Best Movie nominees for that year were Awakenings, Ghost, The
Godfather III, Goodfellas, and the winner, Dances With Wolves).
Metropolitan made instantly of Stillman not only a maverick but also an
"auteur."</P>
<P>His film was about Manhattanite preppies and debutantes, a sharp but
affectionate satire whose motor was talk, talk, talk. Then, in his second
movie, Barcelona (1994), took on former preppies and such, older yet still
young, and pursuing careers in Catalonia in the early 1980s. The Last Days
of Disco, set in the Manhattan of the "very early 80s," in time and
characters inserts itself between the two earlier films. Its main people
are preppies turned yuppies-- although someone in the film splits hairs
about that definition and adds that yuppies are always "the other." Not a
silly statement since the focus group correctly see themselves as still
struggling to attain upward mobility.</P>
<P>The motleycrowd centers on Alice and Charlotte, twenty-something Eastern
college graduates working as lowly editorial assistants in a publishing
firm. More companions than real friends, they make a mismatched duo that
labors by day and boogies by night at the same disco. Alice is the
(presumably) sensitive and shy. She is supposed to be brainy, but I was
far from convinced and would trust neither assistant editor with a
manuscript. Charlotte is hard and manipulative. The film's end proves that
there is divine justice as it finds her pairing off with someone she
deserves.</P>
<P>The trendy, unnamed dance club's main Cerberus at the door decides who can
get in and who cannot. We're talking here of inclusion and exclusion that
go beyond the disco and can involve mini-subplots. Acceptance, in the
widest sense is  emblematic  of the characters' lives and mentalities. The
men whom the two girls meet at the club are mostly Harvard graduates. Chief
among them is Des, a sort of assistant manager who snorts coke (he
protests: "I am not an addict, but a habitual user") and pretends that he's
just discovered he is gay whenever he wants to dump a girlfriend.</P>
<P>Admission to the disco is about as hard as entering Fort Knox, yet the
standards, vestimentary to start with, are otherwise vague and capricious.
Some clients are bare-chested, and an older habituee, the Tiger Lady, is
bare-breasted. There are no color- or sexual preference- lines. It's a
strange microcosm of semi-hedonism, mating rituals, and social contacts.
The non-plot's main focus is on Alice. She apparently has no bad hair days,
but did have a bad social life in college, is still self-doubting and
insecure, politely sleeps around and pays the price -- an easily curable
one compared to other aspects of the early 80s. The first year of the
Reagan presidency was when herpes was common and AIDS was identified</P>
<P>Writer-director Stillman has wickedly good eyes and ears for his creatures.
These make up an un-detailable criss-cross of relationships. Males and
females are all Closely Watched Yuppies who talk pretty incessantly --about
anything. Stillman knows those people inside-out. He comes from a
high-caste family, went to Harvard, and before making films he held various
jobs that added to his perceptions of the human comedy. He makes his
characters jump through hoops, feeds them lines, yet this is no artifice
since his movie is like a "fictional documentary" of real-life, a stalking
of people who might as well be wearing lapel mikes.</P>
<P>Jumping from subject to subject  Alice, Charlotte, Des and Co. engage in
conversations -- some can be outlandishly funny-- that overwhelmingly have
in common pretentiousness, false intellectualism, forced wir, smugness,
dumb paradoxes, or analyses that ape the ponderous jargon of a certain
academic criticism. Those people think they're all so smart, but don't
realize that a little learning is not only a dangerous thing but that it
can change literacy into sub-literacy.</P>
<P>The result is that Stillman's devastating reproduction of shallowness and
all-around insecurities may score a perfect 10 but can leave one royally
uninterested in those people, if not downright bored and irritated by them.
The basic mold from which so many of the characters are cast is a good,
anti-Hollywood move by the director, although the several males, unlike the
two girls, can  take some time to sort out.  Add to this that the dialogues
are not always clear to the audience, while, oddly, the characters can make
their interlocutors hear everything over the disco's din. Not to mention
that hardly any dancer sweats.</P>
<P>With his films Whit Stillman has broken new ground but there are limits.
Unlike some genres, Westerns for example, this specialty is not too
repeatable. I hope those are the last days of Stillman's pursuit of
immature pre-thirties types, and that he will come up with his own takes on
thirty-somethings and beyond.</P>
