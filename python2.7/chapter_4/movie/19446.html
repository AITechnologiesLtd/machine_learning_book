<PRE>"The Haunting"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>Directed by Robert Wise.  Written by Nelson Gidding.  Starring Julie
Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, and Russ Tamblyn.  1963, 112 min., Rated
G.</P>
<P>     In 1963, as movie-goers were being treated to a new Hitchcock experience
that would leave them afraid of birds, director Robert Wise ("The Body
Snatcher," "West Side Story") brought to the big screen a chilling, literate
adaptation, thanks to screenwriter Nelson Gidding, of the classic Shirley
Jackson novel "The Haunting of Hill House."  A haunted house story, how scary
can it be?  Well, it is fairly nerve wracking and lots of fun to behold, in
this instance.  </P>
<P>     Hill House has a long history of depression and death and  it is
supposedly haunted.   Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) is the expert on the
supernatural who has asked a few people who've had otherworldly experiences or
gifts, to join him in a stay at the house, during which time he'll be
investigating and hopefully observing the reported paranormal events that occur
in the house.   Eleanor (Julie Harris) is an emotionally fragile woman whose
life, until recently, has been consumed by caring for her ill mother, which she
greatly resents but feels somewhat ashamed to admit.   This provides a bit of a
parallel between Eleanor's fate and that of a young woman who was once brought
to Hill House to care for one of it's original inhabitants.</P>
<P>     Theodora (Claire Bloom), who was chosen for her acute sixth sense, is one
of the first screen lesbians to not be written or portrayed as evil and
predatory, which is refreshing.   However, the overtones concerning Theo and
Nell aren't all that subtle at times, which becomes distracting. Rounding out
the group is skeptic Luke (Russ Tamblyn), heir to the mansion.   At first he
cares only about how much money the house and it's possessions will fetch him
(as his aunt puts it, he has intended to live off the house, but never in it),
but that will eventually change.</P>
<P>     Gripping, great entertainment with a bravura Harris performance that many
Sandy Dennis roles evoke.  Bloom's nicely underplayed Theodora, and Tamblyn's
wisecracking Luke were my favorite characters, though Johnson is appropriately
authoritative as Dr. Markway.   Wise employs a visual style that was ahead of
its time, and Gidding's script is first-rate.   Moody lighting and the Gothic
mansion look beautiful, and the story never panders to the "I've gotta see it
to believe it" notion, which makes the suspense all the more delightful.  </P>
