<P>"U-571" is the kind of movie that cannot be taken seriously. In fact, it 
is absolutely imperative that you don't take it seriously. At all. If 
you do, you'll hate it. But this isn't a terribly serious movie; it's 
cotton candy cinema. You pays your money, you gets your thrills, and you 
shouldn't expect anything more. It's also somewhat pointless to harp on 
the obvious: "U-571" is filled with war movie clichE9s, stands as a =
retread of previous submarine movies ("The Hunt for Red October," 
"Crimson Tide"), and therefore doesn't have much in the way of original 
material to offer. But I liked it. Why? Because this movie manages to do 
something that a lot of bloated Hollywood blockbusters don't: give the 
audience no-frills, old-fashioned entertainment. I didn't gain any great 
insights from "U-571," but I had a blast watching it.</P>
<P>The plot? OK, so there are these men, see, and they're on a submarine, 
see, and they're trying to steal something from another submarine, see, 
and it doesn't quite go as planned and . . . oh. You want names, don't 
you? Fine: Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) is the executive 
officer (i.e. second in command) aboard an American submarine during 
World War II. His captain (Bill Paxton) doesn't think he's ready for his 
own boat, so despite Tyler's impressive service record, he has withheld 
his recommendation. While on shore leave, the crew of the sub is called 
into action: A German sub has been disabled somewhere in the Atlantic, 
and that sub, the U-571, contains a special encoding device called the 
Enigma. Since its capture means they will be able to crack the German 
code, the Allies want to get their hands on this device, and the mission 
is to board the ship disguised as German sailors, steal the Enigma 
machine, and get out without anyone knowing. Unfortunately, the plan 
goes awry when the American sub is destroyed during the raid, leaving 
Tyler and a skeleton crew stranded aboard the disabled U-571 boat.</P>
<P>But as I said before, specifics don't matter. What matters is that 
director Jonathan Mostow manages to hit the proper marks with a simple 
premise, so "U-571" has very little to bog it down. There is a simple, 
straightforward narrative, nary an extraneous subplot, and a simple 
goal, and that's all you need to make an effective adventure movie. 
You'd think it's an easy thing to do, but recent action films have 
repeatedly failed to get the point. Either we got murky self-importance 
("End of Days"), annoyingly "clever" self-parody ("The Mummy"), or 
pointless and underdeveloped subplots ("The 13th Warrior"). Compared to 
some of the action-oriented duds thrown our way in the last year, 
"U-571" is remarkably unpretentious. Mostow keeps it simple: The 
Americans are the good guys (duh), the Nazis are the bad guys (double 
duh), and the Americans have to fight improbable odds to beat the Nazis. 
This gives us ample opportunity for nail-biting action sequences with 
plenty of leaking water, shaking subs, and the requisite big explosion 
to top it all off. Mostow handles this all with marvelous economy; there 
are few unnecessary scenes, and action sequences don't run any longer 
than they have to. Any director wondering how to properly make a big, 
dumb, entertaining movie should give this guy a call.</P>
<P>The cast, most likely realizing they are only around as props, just say 
their lines and get out of the way. In a movie like "U-571," this is as 
it should be. McConaughey, Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi (your 
guess is as good as mine), and a score of hard-nosed sailors deliver 
their frequently dopey one-liners and patriotic soliloquies with 
square-jawed conviction. That's all they're required to do. After all, 
we don't root for these guys because they're fully-realized human 
characters (and they most definitely aren't); we root for them because 
they're remarkably less evil than the Nazis. Most of the actors' lines 
practically scream "Exposition!" or "Foreshadowing!" But that's okay -- 
if you're looking for character development, you're in the wrong place. 
Let me see, if McConaughey's character has been held back because he's 
"too close to his men," will he have to make a difficult decision later 
in the film to sacrifice one of his crew? If there's a German captive 
kept -- alive -- on board the sub, will he try to sabotage the 
Americans' chances? Will the good guys win out in the end? Don't worry; 
you don't have to answer those questions.</P>
<P>So yes, the plot developments in "U-571" are awfully predictable. They 
also happen at reasonable times, and nothing is overly contrived. When a 
young sailor has to display some selfless heroism, it happens at the 
right time. When the Nazi gets his comeuppance, it happens at the right 
time. Once it gets past the fairly quick character introductions and 
becomes focused the accomplishment of a simple goal, "U-571" is 
astoundingly well-paced. It's also Hollywood entertainment, which means 
that it should not be confused with a history lesson. Controversy has 
arisen about the film's decision to depict the main heroes as Americans, 
despite the fact that the first Enigma machines were actually captured 
by the British Navy. The film does include some end credit title cards 
to document these achievements, so it's at least managed to cover its 
bases, but to me, this controversy seems like much ado about nothing. Is 
anybody going to mistake "U-571" for a factual document? I hope not.</P>
<P>It's easy to complain about historical inaccuracies in an action film, 
just as it's easy to snipe at cardboard characters and a thin plot. In 
fact, after watching "U-571," there isn't a whole lot to say in its 
favor, at least not from a quantitative standpoint. I found that the 
film fell apart quite easily upon even a cursory reflection. But therein 
lay my problem: I was *thinking* too much. "U-571" is not the kind of 
film you have in-depth discussions on; it's the kind of film you watch 
and appreciate how much the armrest-grabbing suspense and spectacular 
action is making you forget you're watching trash. You're not in a movie 
theater; you're 200 meters below the surface, much deeper than the 
submarine was meant to go, the Nazis are dropping depth charges on your 
head, and you're scared as hell. That's where "U-571" shines. Jonathan 
Mostow hasn't made an intelligent, thought-provoking film out of 
"U-571," but he didn't try to. He just wanted to give us two hours of 
solid entertainment. That he has.</P>
