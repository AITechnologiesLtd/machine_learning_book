# [film] "Pi"
A Postview, copyright 1999, P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>Max, a reclusive mathematician (Gulette), sifts through the dataflow 
of the financial markets looking for a unifying pattern.  His 
computers misbehave and break down, he suffers a series of terrifying 
psychotic attacks and two separate groups pursue him: a group of 
stockmarket brokers and an enigmatic clan of Talmudic scholars ...</P>
<P>"Pi" is possibly the best science-fiction film of the year.  There are 
those who might argue that it isn't SF - hair-splitting in my opinion 
- but even then, "Pi" is possibly the best psychological thriller of 
the year.  Loopy, paranoid, daring and unnerving, it may herald the 
arrival of a major new directing talent.</P>
<P>It is also another entry in the extremely low budget film stakes.  (To 
get the tried cliches out of the way: "young filmmaker ...  couldn't 
get backing ...  shoestring budget ...  masterpiece ...  one in the 
eye for Hollywood ...  blah, blah ...")  To my mind, this is both 
irrelevant and important for the movie viewer.  Relevant, because (of 
course) budget does have an impact on the look and effectiveness of 
the final problem.  Although director Aronofsky makes excellent use of 
washed out B&W footage and found locations, at times the jerky camera 
and shadows conspire to make the action hard to see.  Conversely, low 
budget films are important for they stand in contrast to the resource 
gobbling Hollywood behemoths, and remind us of all the films that 
aren't getting made because of ridiculous budgets and star salaries.  
(Is "Titanic" 2000 times better than "Pi"?  Is "Out of Sight" 20 times 
better than "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"?).</P>
<P>Max's beliefs are not so far removed from those scientists working in 
complex systems, and the Platonic idealism of Roger Penrose and Paul 
Davies.  (Indeed, some years ago a group of complexity theorists set 
up a company to look for and exploit patterns in the stockmarket.)  
Maths is pure, maths is reality.  Everything happens because of maths.
If only life was like maths, predictable and comprehendible.  If only 
we could understand the maths of life ...  Max is a king in his own 
world but, like so many savants, at a disadvantage outside of it.  At 
the mercy of mental illness, tormented by the sounds of lovemaking 
coming through the thin walls of his apartment, frustrated by fallible 
hardware, he tries to extend maths to rule over the rest of the world.
It's a intense portrayal of a paarnoid and claustrophobic life.  And 
thankfully the script has the courage to avoid portraying Max as a 
freak genius.  Although maths is easy to him, we see him working 
at it, spending his life trying to understand and grasping for the big 
questions.  I can't think of another movie that has had the guts to 
portray science as long hard work.  Actually, "Pi" may be the one of 
the most scientifically hip movies to ever be made.  There are passing 
references to childhood experiments with potatoes and iodine, 
antfarms, the golden ratio and cellular automata.  Perhaps I speak 
from a biased perspective, but it's great to see these things 
acknowledged.</P>
<P>There are those who would argue the premise of "Pi" is ludicrous.  
(Here I must be circumspect to avoid giving away the plot.)  Mileage 
will vary of course, and towards the end "Pi" starts going off the 
deep end, but this argument seems a little churlish to me.  Did people 
really expect a movie to suggest a plausible and revolutionary 
discovery in mathematics?  All science fiction "fakes it" to make a 
story work, which it will as long as the lies are consistent and not 
too outrageous.</P>
<P>The cast asides from Max do well, from the his tormented teacher 
(Margolis) to his his sensual neighbour (Shoaib).  A driven and 
compelling movie, "Pi" is good value on every level.  [****/mustsee] 
and a childhood electronics kit on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
