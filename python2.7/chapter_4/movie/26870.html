"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Everybody is making such a big deal about Ben Affleck, Gwyneth Paltrow
and their highly publicized `are they or aren't they' relationship.  I
couldn't give a rat's ass what any Hollywood star does with their
personal life (unless it actually involves a rat's ass), but even I have
to take my hat off to Affleck and Paltrow for their performances in
Bounce, the new three-hankie chick-flick starring the
former/current/future real-life couple.  I don't know if their
off-screen relationship has anything to do with it, but their chemistry
in Bounce is terrific.  The Oscar-winning duo seem so comfortable in
their roles that it doesn't appear that either is acting.</P>
<P>Affleck (Reindeer Games) stars as Buddy Amaral, a smooth-talking
advertising salesman who appears to be an extension of Affleck's Jim
Young from Boiler Room.  As the film opens, he has just landed the Big
Account but finds himself stranded at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a
snowstorm.  He meets a married father of two from Los Angeles named Greg
Janello (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss the Girls).  Buddy has a boarding pass for
the next flight to L.A. but gives it to Greg so he can make it home for
his son's Cub Scouts Christmas tree sale the following day.</P>
<P>Greg's plane ends up crashing, killing all 216 people onboard.  His
wife, Abby (Paltrow, Duets), assumes Greg is okay, since he wasn't
supposed to be on that particular flight.  Eventually she gets
confirmation that her husband is dead, leaving her two sons fatherless.
Without seeing a dime from a class-action suit against the airline, Abby
makes ends meet as a struggling commercial real estate agent.</P>
<P>In the meantime, Buddy goes on a one-year bender.  It's hard to tell if
he's just freaked out from narrowly escaping death or if he's bothered
by indirectly killing a nice guy with two little kids (the character
doesn't even acknowledge the latter scenario).  As part of his alcohol
rehab, he's forced to take that dreaded eighth step, where you're
supposed to make amends with all the people you hurt as a drunk.  He
finds Abby, pretends to be a complete stranger, and hooks her up with a
peach of a real estate transaction.  Buddy only means his atonement to
be financial, but he ends up falling for Abby when she orders a grilled
cheese sandwich at a diner after the big closing.</P>
<P>The rest of the film shows the budding relationship between Buddy and
Abby, but as a viewer, you know it's only a matter of time before she
finds out about the boarding pass swap that left her a widow.  It's
obvious that Buddy really wants to be honest with Abby but knows the
truth will crush her.  The further he gets into the relationship, the
worse his secret becomes.  He's the first person who has been nice to
her without knowing she's a widow … except he really does, but has to
pretend he doesn't.</P>
<P>Bounce's ending is kind of a cop-out, compared to the quality of the
rest of the script.  I won't go into why here, as it could ruin the
ending, but it seems like it could have been mistakenly inserted from a
completely different film.  Admittedly, it's different than what you'd
expect from a typical chick-flick, but it still doesn't work.</P>
<P>As I mentioned earlier, the acting in Bounce is fabulous.  The smart
script and direction (from The Opposite of Sex's Don Roos) is also much
better than average.  Both of Roos' main characters are more flawed than
we're used to seeing on the screen, and the flaws aren't your typical
Hollywood defects.  Roos doesn't hit you over the head with emotional
stuff, either.  You don't see the plane crash, and the scene where Abby
learns that her husband was on the flight is surprisingly tasteful,
while most other films would have exploited both of these scenarios.
Credit Atom Egoyan regular Mychael Danna for keeping his score in check
throughout the film.</P>
