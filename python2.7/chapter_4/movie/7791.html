<P>     Nicolas Cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his
role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama CON AIR.  The
opening credits sequence introduces us to Cage as Cameron Poe, a Gulf War
veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after
an ill-fated bar-room brawl.  The prison scenes are accompanied by
voice-overs in which Poe, in a languid Southern drawl, describes prison
life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he
has never met.  If the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity, it
probably should.  Cage appears to realize that CON AIR is going to be
utterly dim-witted and ridiculous, and that he's going to have to do
something to keep himself entertained.  And thus he slips into a familiar,
surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- Cage plays
Cameron Poe as a buffed-up version of RAISING ARIZONA's H. I. McDonnough.</P>
<P>     Cage should have known what he was getting himself into.  He got a
paycheck from Jerry Bruckheimer last year for THE ROCK, and if there's one
thing you can count on from a Bruckheimer production (even without his
late partner Don Simpson), it's that you can count on seeing everything
you saw in the _last_ Bruckheimer production.  The critical difference
between THE ROCK and CON AIR is Cage's performance.  In THE ROCK, Cage
appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray
for the first time.  That sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry
self-awareness.  While the plot of CON AIR finds Poe a parolee on board a
hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home, Cage's
goal is different but just as simple:  to get out of the film with some
measure of dignity intact.</P>
<P>     Audiences, too, should know what they're getting themselves into with
a Bruckheimer production.  In fact, the marketing people are counting on
it.  No one who loathed THE ROCK for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness
will be converted by CON AIR; no one who loved THE ROCK for exactly the
same reasons will be dissuaded.  Director Simon West (yet another TV
commercial auteur plucked by Bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent
of the Schwab's soda fountain) delivers exactly the kind of
adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology
lecture (it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most
of the flight nearing a diabetic coma; like insulin, CON AIR does the
work of a gland).  What he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense.  A
Bruckheimer film has no use for Hitchcock's notion that showing you the
bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up
the desk; a really, _really_ big desk and a really, _really_ big bomb will
serve the purpose nicely.</P>
<P>     If either West or Bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension,
they might have done something with CON AIR's creepiest set-up.  At a
desert stop for the plane-load of convicts, serial killer Garland Greene
(Steve Buscemi) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little
girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool.  Their tete-a-tete is
eerie and menacing, providing a welcome shift in tone and giving Buscemi a
chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains (Danny Trejo, Ving
Rhames and a characteristically reptilian John Malkovich among them).  In
fact, CON AIR usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest
measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many 
characters, too much editing, too many dopey punch lines, too much of the
cheap, ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many Bruckheimer
efforts.</P>
<P>     It is that kind of exhausting excess to which Cage is responding with
his detached performance.  While Malkovich goes for the outrageous and
John Cusack (as a U. S. Marshal) goes for earnest, Cage looks like he just
wants to go to sleep.  His recycled RAISING ARIZONA performance is a means
of escape, his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit
of that big box of Huggies.  It doesn't bode well for Cage's appearance in
FACE/OFF later this month; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do
in action films is more of the same over and over.  There's a word for
people like you, Nicolas.  That word is called recidivist...repeat
offender.</P>
