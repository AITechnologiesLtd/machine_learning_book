 ChickenRun (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal talents of
Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson, Jane Horrocks, Imelda
Staunton, Benjamin Whitrow, Lynn Ferguson, Tony Haygarth, Timothy Spall

Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Rated G.</P>
<P>While a student at Ohio University in the late ‘60s (1960s, that is),
the university had a program called the MIA, which stood for Movies in
Auditorium.</P>
<P> Every Friday and Saturday night, students would troop to Mem Aud, as we
called Memorial Auditorium, to see a not-so-old movie.</P>
<P> Two of the most popular - they were screened every quarter - were "The
Magnificent Seven" and "The Great Escape." I saw the latter so many
times that by my senior year, I'd be whistling along with "The Great
Escape's" music track over the opening titles.</P>
<P> What brought this wave of nostalgia to mind was "Chicken Run," a
wonderfully daft Claymation comedy from the team behind the popular
Oscar-winning `Wallace and Gromit' shorts.</P>
<P> Trapped behind barbed wire, a group of prisoners plot their escape.
Time after time, they try and fail to flee their barbaric surroundings.</P>
<P> Only these prisoners are chickens and their stalag is Tweedy's Chicken
Farm where certain death awaits any chicken who doesn't meet her egg
quota.</P>
<P> Led by Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawahla of "Absolutely Fabulous" fame),
the hens devise plan after plan, including such classic ruses as
tunneling under the compound and cutting through the barbed wire.</P>
<P> "Chicken Run" utilizes all the clichés from the classic p.o.w.-escape
genre and, in doing so, brings off one of the most entertaining vehicles
of the year.</P>
<P> For the movie takes all the stereotypical elements found in such
adventures and endows those characteristics in chickens. There's the
Scottish engineer who's always calculating the probability of success or
failure and the veteran sergeant-major type who believes in maintaining
discipline and tradition even under the most dire circumstances.</P>
<P> Then there''s the solitary Yank, the cocky American who assures the
chickens he can lead them in a successful mass exodus.</P>
<P> Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) crash lands in the compound, creating the
mistaken belief that he can fly. Rocky enjoys all the clucking and
fussing. But he neglects to inform the others that the only way he can
take to the air is to be shot out of a cannon. Rocky, it is learned, is
an escapee from a nearby circus.</P>
<P> Cocky Rocky (he calls himself `the lone free-ranger') bamboozles the
hens until the truth is uncovered. But the indomitable Ginger won't give
up, leading to a soaring, splendid finale.</P>
<P> "Chicken Run" is witty and charming in that veddy, veddy understated
British manner. As directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park, you soon forget
the characters are merely clay figures moved frame-by-frame by hand.</P>
<P> There are no computer-generated images here. This movie was done the
old-fashioned way, one shot at a time. And the care shows.</P>
<P> "Chicken Run" contains some wonderful moments. Continually thrown into
`solitary' (actually a coal bin) for her many escape attempts, Ginger,
at one point, begins bouncing a wall off the coal bin wall, a homage to
Steve McQueen and "The Great Escape."</P>
<P> A wonderfully scary sequence concerns a Rube Goldberg-like contraption
purchased by Mrs. Tweedy who has decided the farm would make more money
selling chicken pies than chicken eggs.</P>
<P> Ginger, caught in the deadly machinery, is rescued in the nick of time
by Rocky in an exciting sequence.</P>
<P> The movie's vocal talent is first rate. Gibson gives a sturdy comedic
performance as the self-assured cock of the walk.</P>
<P> Sawalha is all determination and grit as the leader of the hens, while
Miranda Richardson exudes menace as the evil Mrs. Tweedy, a character
who could cause nightmares for the very young viewers.</P>
<P> "Chicken Run," at about 80 minutes, never falters. The uplifting finale
will have you cheering. It is an original, entertaining feature the
entire family can enjoy.</P>
