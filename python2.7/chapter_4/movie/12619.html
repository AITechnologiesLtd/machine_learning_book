<PRE>                      TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                3 :-( :-( :-(  for a boy and not the man</PRE>
<P>Cast: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddingham
Director: Carl Schenkel
Producers: Stanley Canter, Dieter Geissler, Michael Lake
Screenplay: Baynard Johnson and J. Anderson Black based on the "Tarzan"
stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs</P>
<P>I'm not sure how people usually like their heroes, but when it comes to
Tarzan, I usually picture a man's man. I don't mean size, cause Casper
Van Dien (STARSHIP TROOPERS) doesn't come small by any means, he's just
too petulant a schoolboy to be the brooding, dark Lord of Greystoke.</P>
<P>Having said that, Casper can't act, and even his growling, chimpanzee
noises and jungle call comes a little mediocre when compared to last
years summer hit GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE – a far superior movie by my
accounts. Little things that don't help are the poor quality of the
script ie when Tarzan tells Jane: ‘I taught myself to read' ???? Also,
Tarzan's ape brethren look like men in monkey suits flying through the
trees. This made me laugh, but doesn't help with the poor credibility of
costume design.</P>
<P>Lots of unfavourable comparisons can about this movie to the early
Weissmuller films, Tarzan the series or even GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN – which I believe to be the best dramatic version to date. This
movie tries to bring back the adventure and fun of the 1940 films, but
that is another time and place, where Tarzan (Weissmuller) retained a
lot of his mystery by grunting and saying very little – and rightly so,
considering he was raised in the jungle. Casper Van Dien has too much
too say and looks like he's on a Contiki-fun-adventure-holiday in
Africa! Jane (Jane March) on the other hand, is sweet but very plain and
flat chested. However, the major criticism is not her chest, but the
fact she lacks any spark and charisma to be a viable jungle man love
interest. When both Jane and Tarzan are ‘boring', then you have a major
problem on your hands.</P>
<P>As for the Lost City of Opah, it looks someone has torn a picture of a
pyramid out of a National Geographic Journal, and very cleverly computer
pasted into the movie. The ending makes little sense, and comes as
suddenly and unexplainable as a bolt of lightning striking the bad guy
dead. Don't bother asking why, it's just because. As for Tarzan and
Jane, I don't think there will be a sequel, at least not if Casper Van
Dien is staring in it.</P>
