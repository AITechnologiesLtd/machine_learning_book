Rated R (Violence, language, sex)</P>
<P>     The latest Antonio Banderas Movie Of The Week was helmed by
respected stage director Peter Hall (knighted in 1977).  Between 1967
and 1974, Sir Peter also directed six films, mostly adaptations of
plays and mostly unpraised.</P>
<P>     The writers of NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS are not movie celebrities
either, although Jordan Rush must be a favorite son in Carbondale,
Illinois, since he graduated from Southern Illinois University.  There
is also another, more tenuous Illinois connection.  This movie's
Hungarian cinematographer has shot several American films, including
the 1990 JOURNEY OF HOPE (Oscar for Best Foreign Film), which was
co-produced by University of Illinois alumnus Bill Hartman.  All those
tie-ins however do not make a movie worth watching.</P>
<P>     It starts fairly promisingly as bright criminal psychologist Sarah
(Rebecca De Mornay) has another one of her sessions in jail with
accused serial killer Max (Harry Dean Stanton).  Character actor
Stanton is always good and has, in fact, improved a lot of films with
his presence.  Here he claims that he suffers from Multiple Personality
Disorder, so that other selves are guilty.  Ergo, I, Max, am innocent.</P>
<P>     We also meet Sarah's womanizer pal Dennis Miller, with whom she
once slept (she was drunk then).  He then moved into her building, but
now Sarah gently rejects his advances.</P>
<P>     As a stand-up practitioner, actor and talk show host, Miller is
too coarse, questionable and smug.  He is in character here as he
points out to Sarah that he is not after an involvement but only after
sex. (His succinct, explicit phrasing was unprintable in the main paper
I write for.  But for the censorless Internet it was: "I just want to
fuck.")</P>
<P>     Sarah also has somewhere a boy-friend who once day disappeared.
She and Puerto Rican biker Tony (Banderas) meet cute at a liquor store,
where tattooed Tony discourses like a connoisseur of fine wines.  This
is one of the many mistakes of the film, since he looks as though he
should be drinking out of a paper bag.</P>
<P>     In quick succession, Sarah goes to his pad for wine-tasting, which
means immediate, vigorous sex.  Later the two reluctantly exchange
information about themselves.  Tony works in surveillance, electronic
and otherwise.</P>
<P>     Soon the plot thickens to impenetrability.  Sarah is visited by
her estranged and--it's hinted broadly--once abusive father.  Her
off-on relationship with Tony goes with incrementally kinky sex.  It is
uninteresting, even though the bodies are in fine shape and Miss De
Mornay is not siliconed.</P>
<P>     Sarah receives a gift package of dead flowers, then another with
her dead cat.  Later she reads her own obituary in the paper.  The
audience is theoretically supposed to suspect everyone, including Max
who was released for lack of evidence.  But the audience doesn't give a
hoot.</P>
<P>     Intermittently suspecting Tony, Sarah engages a shabby private
investigator.  Now the surveillance man is under surveillance, on the
"set a thief to catch a thief" principle--while Hitchcock is crying
in Movie Heaven.</P>
<P>     Sarah learns that Tony is lying about his trips.  There's an
attempt on her life via an electric heater that is HANGS LOOSELY RIGHT
OVER HER BATHTUB and is magically supposed to fall and electrocute her
at the right moment!</P>
<P>     That's about the only electricity in the film, since there is none
between De Mornay and Banderas.  Instead, this awfully plotted picture
throws our way a shipload of red herrings as it gets exponentially
incoherent, improbable, impossible, unclear, dull, uninvolving and
stupid.  It uses a plethora of flashbacks and/or visions.  The parts
don't join or hold together.  The proverbial "holes so big that you can
drive a truck through" are here fit for locomotives.</P>
<P>     The production values are good, with slick-and-somber camerawork.
There is an overabundance of shots from various angles that stress
enclosed spaces or suggest partitions such as freight elevator bars,
railings and the like, all heavily symbolic of cages, jails and
separations.</P>
<P>     The film is a waste of everything and everyone, especially Old
Reliable Harry Dean Stanton, whom we see too little of.  It was dumb of
the plot to have had him released from jail.  It was even dumber to
have had this movie released.</P>
