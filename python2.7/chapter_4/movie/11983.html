<PRE>CITY OF ANGELS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Angels are a hot pop-culture item right now.  So it was only a matter of
time before someone got around to making an adaptation of Wim Wenders'
film Wings of Desire, about an angel who falls in love with a mortal.
Although not a perfect film, City of Angels is perhaps the best
Hollywood could do with the story.</P>
<P>Seth (Nicholas Cage) is an angel.  He spends his days wandering the
earth, with his other angelic kin (including Cassiel, played by Andre
Braugher), observing humanity unseen, and helping to comfort mankind.
One of the duties of the angels is to accompany the recently deceased to
heaven.  Obviously, a popular haunt for the angels then are hospitals,
and it is there where Seth meets Maggie.</P>
<P>Maggie (Meg Ryan) is a heart surgeon, struggling with the concept of
mortality.  Even if she does everything right...sometimes she still
loses her patients.  She begins to lose hope...</P>
<P>But then Seth decides to make himself seen to Maggie.  He finds himself
falling in love with her, and must decide whether or not to make the
ultimate sacrifice:  give up being an angel for the brief passion of
being human.</P>
<P>Only loosely based on Wings of Desire, City of Angels has a stronger
emotional core, but can't hope to match the former film's superb visual
style.  Still, though, City of Angels does create some interesting
visuals, but some of them are unintentionally creepy. The legions of
black clad angels can't help but to recall the strangers of Dark City.</P>
<P>But perhaps the biggest difference between the film is the
schlock-factor. The film's new age attitudes range from cute to cuter.
Towards the end, the film struggles to grasp some important topics...but
the film has never attained the weight needed to deal with anything of
substance.</P>
<P>City of Angels also suffers from occasional bouts of misdirection (from
director Brad Silberling).  The most notable example occurs in its final
act, where a critical error treats the audience contemptibly. A crucial
twist is grossly mishandled and becomes ridiculous.  As a result the
emotional climax of the film is muted and loses its depth of meaning.
Still, the point of the movie is made, if a bit heavy-handedly.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage plays most of the film with blinkless moist eyes, but is
given a chance to stretch near the end of the film.  Meg Ryan's role is
very familiar.  Her Maggie is a minor variation on her staple "romantic
comedy character", seen in everything from When Harry Met Sally to
Sleepless in Seattle.  But the film never quite explains a central
question:  Why does Maggie fall for Seth?  His initial appearances seem
rather eerie and disturbing...perhaps a little more development would
have been able to explain things.</P>
<P>The supporting cast does a good job here.  Andre Braugher does a good
job as Seth's angelic partner.  But the true scene stealer here is
Dennis Franz as Nathaniel Messenger, one of Maggie's patients who has
keen insights into how the world really works.</P>
<P>City of Angels is far from subtle, hitting you over the head with
everything from passion to pathos.  You may not respond as strongly as
the film intends you to, but it does have its moments.</P>
