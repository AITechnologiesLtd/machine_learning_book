<PRE>                        HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I am dumbfounded about where to begin writing about this
experiment-in-filmmaking-gone-terribly-wrong, HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN
QUILT.  Some of the best actresses working in film (Anne Bancroft,
Ellen Burstyn, Winona Ryder, Jean Simmons, Lois Smith, Samantha Mathis,
and Claire Danes, to name a few) appear in this movie.  And I can't
begin to imagine how such a wide array of talents agreed to appear in
such a dreadful picture.</P>
<P>     Ryder plays the cheeky Finn, a precocious grad student pondering a
marriage proposal.  Having second thoughts, she decides to spend the
summer with a gaggle of quilting relatives and their friends, just to
sort things out.  Well, we see right off the bat that this probably
wasn't such a great idea, because each and every one of these people is
completely insane.</P>
<P>     For some bizarre, sadistic motive, each of the ladies begins to
tell Finn the warped story of her life, wherein we have the luxury of
viewing cutesy flashbacks which inevitably include adultery, self-pity,
insecurity, more adultery, pathetic whining, and/or a lot of just plain
bad advice.  And get this:  all this so-called "wisdom" is the "theme"
for the latest quilt they're working on--Finn's wedding quilt.</P>
<P>     After an O.D. of this idiocy, Finn is driven into the arms of Leon
(Johnathon Schaech), a muscle headed loser with no redeeming
qualities.  When she feels bad about it later, one of the quilters
(don't even bother trying to keep them straight, as some 8 zillion
characters are introduced in the first 5 minutes) advises her to
*never* tell her fiancee about the affair.  Well, how comforting.</P>
<P>     Maybe I didn't get it because I'm just a guy.  Maybe I just don't
understand "quilt humor."  But this film is simply awful.  The way I
see it, there's nothing wrong with the acting; it's the story and the
actresses' parts.  (I do give Bancroft and Smith a few kudos for making
me laugh ... twice.)  Director Jocelyn Moorhouse and especially
screenwriter Jane Anderson should both be blacklisted.</P>
<P>     Be warned, stay away from this one.  If this is really how to make
an American quilt, I'll just sleep on the floor covered with a burlap
sack.</P>
