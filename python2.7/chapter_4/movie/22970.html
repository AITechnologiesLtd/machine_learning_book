<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very pleasing rendition of a Woody Allen film, directed and written by
Woody. It is a fictional docudrama that smacks of Woody's playfulness
and love for jazz, and his inability to tell a straight story, but his
great ability to tell a very personal one, which in this case is a very
suitable way of telling it. The film, also, is in many ways, a homage to
Woody's favorite directors, Fellini and Bergman, both of whom he is
obsessed with, just like the Sean Penn character is obsessed with a
fellow musician, Django Reinhardt, in the film.</P>
<P>The film also has the good sense to reach for Woody's unique wit to get
it through a few dry spells in the story. The joke that made me laugh
the loudest, was when Sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for
about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell
him, what do you expect, it's a Jewish holiday! It was the timing and
the facial expressions seen on Sean Penn that made those kind of jokes
work.</P>
<P>Casting Sean Penn in the lead as the fictional, flamboyant jazz
guitarist, Emmet Ray, was undoubtedly a wise choice on Woody's part, as
he fits the role remarkably well, playing the second-best jazz guitar
player in the swing world of the 1930s, who was also a pimp, drunk,
egomaniac, wastrel, kleptomaniac, womanizer, and oddball, besides
actually being a great artist. He explains all his moral deficiencies
away, by saying, he is an "artist."</P>
<P>There are some marvelous Sean Penn jazz riffs on the guitar dubbed in by
Howard Alden and some musical scores updated from the work of Django
Reinhardt by Bucky Pizzarelli. The music was just beautiful to listen to
and was played often enough during the course of the film, which should
be pleasing to the aficionados of jazz.</P>
<P>To highlight his story with an air of authenthicity, Woody uses a number
of experts on jazz to drily add information on the life of the invented
second-greatest guitarist in the world, Emmet Ray, whose awe for Django
Reinhardt, the French Gypsy guitarist, whom he considers to be the
greatest player in the world, borders on hysteria, as the only two times
he met him, he fainted. One such expert is the current writer for the
Village Voice, Nat Hentoff, who plays himself.</P>
<P>The film relies on the quirkiness of Penn's performance to tell its
lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness, which captures the
flavor of that period. It also tells of how as an artist he is a
natural; he just knows how to play and has a certain grace to him when
he plays, but when he is away from his music, he is a born loser and a
braggart, messing up his life because he is a shell of a human being,
afraid to fall in love or talk in earnest about himself, instead always
showing off that he can throw any woman aside. His other peculiarity is
to dress outlandishly in outfits that you need to wear sunglasses to
kill all the glare coming from them. He also has a Hitler-like mustache,
that looks comical on him, making his very expressive facial features
flash with moods of sadness and a zany mischieve in his eyes. He is not
really a good fellow away from his mistress, the guitar; he is much too
self-absorbed to care a lick about someone else. His hobbies include,
stealing knick-knacks, watching the trains go by and shooting rats in
the town dumps.</P>
<P>What changes his life for awhile and should have made him a happy man,
but turned out in the end to be just another mess up in his life, is his
relationship with the mute laundress he picked-up on the Boardwalk in
Atlantic City, Hattie (Samantha), who looks like the silent screen star
Mabel Normand. She has a heart of gold and offers him her unconditional
love. Her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies,
as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was
feeling at the time were clearly seen; all the long- sufferings that she
has gone through. She also has a most pleasing smile, that anyone could
understand. She is a physical person, loving to eat, have sex, and
listen to his music; and, that she can hear, means that she also has to
hear all the crude remarks directed at her by Emmet, who cannot open
himself up to how he truly feels, but has to put her down constantly.
What he is good at, besides playing the guitar, is foolishly spending
money and living without a concept of how he is living. If he sees a
flashy car that he likes, he only knows that he wants to buy it. When
his manager Sid Bishop (Guastaferro) tells him he can't keep spending
money he doesn't have and puts him on an allowance, he still tells Sid
that he wants the car and can save the money, he will do that by telling
Hattie to cut out desserts.</P>
<P>Eventually dumping Hattie, like he has done to all his other women, he
meets a socialite hussy, in need of inspiration from the artist, by the
name of Blanche (Uma), who thinks of herself as a writer, always
questioning the inarticulate artist about what he is thinking about when
he is performing. On a whim, he marries her and their doomed marriage
goes downhill when the unreliable Emmet loses his latest gig because he
doesn't show up and she starts an affair with a gangster (LaPaglia), the
bodyguard for the nightclub owner who fired him. When Emmet trails them
to follow up on the gossip he hears that his wife is having an affair,
several versions are told through the stories the jazz experts heard.
All the stories are so far apart, that none of the ridiculous versions
could be verified by any of the experts, but what all the stories have
in common, is that he hid in the backseat of the gangster's car and
heard for sure that they were having an affair.</P>
<P>In the end there is pathos, as Emmet is left alone, not understanding
what he had until Hattie left his life for good and he was unable to
make real contact with another woman. The woman he loved and who loved
him, couldn't result in a happy relationship because he was so full of
hubris. That he, at least, realizes this, doesn't make him a happier
person, it is too late for that, but the jazz experts tell us that he
became a better musician, able to put more of his feelings into the
music. Though they have no more stories to tell about him; he seemed to
disappear off the face of the world.</P>
<P>Woody's film is an appealing look back at that age of swing music and
maybe a composite glimpse of how some jazzmen lived their lives. The
great music played incudes the following renditions: "Sweet Sue," "All
of Me,"  "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I'll See You in My Dreams."
It also brings to the greater public's attention a real legend in guitar
music, Django Reinhardt, the gypsy jazz guitarist from the Paris of the
1930s-1950s; he played a great guitar despite having lost his fingers in
a childhood accident.</P>
