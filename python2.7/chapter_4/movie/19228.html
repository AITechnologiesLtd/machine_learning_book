<PRE>THE KING AND I (G).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Richard Rich
Stars: the voices of Miranda Richardson, Martin Vidnovic, Ian Richardson, 
Darrell Hammond
Running time: 88 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Rogers and Hammerstein's enduring musical about the prim
English governess who tamed the humourless king of Siam returns to the
screen in this animated tale from Warner Brothers.  For most, the role
of the stern but enlightened king is indelibly associated with the
late Yul Brynner, who performed it countless times on stage, in the
film version (for which he won an Oscar), and even in the short-lived
tv series.  Although he does a moderate job of voicing the character
here, Martin Vidnovic lacks Brynner's commanding presence.</P>
<P>Miranda Richardson provides the voice of Anna, the English
widow who travels to Siam in the 1860's to educate the king's
children.  She unwittingly becomes caught up in the intrigues of the
villainous Kralahome (voiced with sinister relish by Ian Richardson,
from Dark City).  With his incompetent, overweight sidekick Master
Little (Darrell Hammond), the Kralahome attempts to usurp the throne
away from the king.  It is this character who provides the bulk of the
film's humour.  Anna also helps the king see the error of following
traditional ways when his attitude threatens the romance between the
crown prince and a slave girl.</P>
<P>Created mainly in Asian studios under the direction of Richard
Rich, the standard of animation is largely uninspiring and fairly
straightforward, and the film lacks real impact.  The King And I
follows the formula for this type of animated film long set by Disney,
but without the same sense of flair or imagination.  Amazingly, there
are numerous continuity goofs throughout the film.  The producers have
deliberately aimed it more at juvenile audiences, who will probably be
unaware of the original movie.  Many of the familiar songs (including
Getting To Know You and Shall We Dance?) remain, but there have been
numerous other changes made to accommodate younger audiences.  Thus,
in true Disney fashion, we get a number of cute animals, including a
troublesome monkey, a black panther, and a pair of rare white
elephants, which will appeal to children.  Adult audiences will find
little here to excite or entertain.</P>
<P>For the most part, this version of The King And I is rather
dull stuff, and many in the audience will quickly tire of it.</P>
