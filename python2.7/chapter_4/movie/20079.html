                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Hugh Grant hit paydirt once this summer, in NOTTING HILL.  Can he
do it again if you take away Julia Roberts?  And throw in an unlikely
comedy about murderous gangsters, an auction house, and a botched
wedding?  <Drum roll...></P>
<P>     Yes he can!  MICKEY BLUE EYES, against all odds, is nothing short
of fall-down funny – on par with NOTTING HILL, SOUTH PARK, and AUSTIN
POWERS 2 as one of the best comedies of the summer.</P>
<P>     The plot involves Grant's milquetoast auctioneer, who, after three
months of dating, proposes to his girlfriend (Tripplehorn), whom he
doesn't realize is the daughter of a major New York Mafioso (Caan).
Hilarity ensues when the mob family tries to rein Grant in for various
money laundering schemes, dubbing him `Mickey Blue Eyes.'  Enter the
FBI, and accidental shooting, nocturnal shallow-grave burials, and a
payback/revenge scheme, and you've got some pretty weighty elements here
– but BLUE EYES usually makes the most of them all – in a comic sense,
of course.</P>
<P>     Don't be fooled: Grant carries this picture all by his lonesome.
Tripplehorn is fine, but uninspiring.  The mob guys are broadly drawn
stereotypes.  Caan is playing his usual tough guy and doesn't have a
whole lot of screen time.  With the exception of a few bizarre
supporting characters (see also NOTTING HILL, again), Hugh Grant owns
this show.</P>
<P>     And therein we see what a comic talent he really is.  Essentially,
MICKEY BLUE EYES is a fish out of water tale, only the water finds the
fish this time around.  And watching this fish squirm is one hell of a
good time.</P>
