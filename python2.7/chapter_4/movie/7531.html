<PRE>                              FATHERS' DAY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>There are few productions that are more risky than taking a perfectly
good movie and doing a remake.   How do you improve on a movie that is
just about perfect . . . and why would you want to do that?     In this
case, the film was a subtitled French comedy that despite  raves from
audiences and critics played only in  art-houses for no other reason
than that subtitles are anathema to American audiences.    To insure
that this remake will not be a fiasco, some  heavy professionals were
brought in:  the director, the screenwriters and the cast.  Needless to
add, the movie is hilarious, a worthy successor to Les Comperes which
starred, in 1984, Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu.</P>
<P>This time around the film is called  FATHERS' DAY.   Several of the
gags in the original film are used again  such as the head-banging.
The story, with but few exceptions, remains the same.   In Les
Comperes,  (The Godfathers) Depardieu's role was that of a journalist
with some Mafia-types after him.   Here, Jack  (Billy Crystal), is a
well-to-do lawyer.</P>
<P>The story is of a married woman, Collette Andrews (Nastassja Kinski)
whose 16-year-old son. Scott (Charlie Hofheimer) has run away from
home.   When Collette feels that her husband, Bob, (Bruce Greenwood, is
not up to the task of finding their son, she embarks on her own.  First
she visits an old boyfriend, Jack, to enlist his aid in looking for her
son. Jack asks why, after 17 years of their not having seen each other
does she suddenly think of him as someone who would help her.  "Because
you are his father."  She explains that when last they saw each other
she was pregnant but did not tell him.  He asks if she has a picture of
the son;  she shows him a photo. Examining it, offhand he sees no
resemblance.  Collette tells him that when Scott smiles, you can see
the resemblance.   "Do you have a photo of him smiling? " he asks
her.   That funny line was also in the original film.</P>
<P>Feeling that Jack is probably not going to help her, she goes to the
home of Dale with whom she spent some sack time  in Berkeley, also 17
years ago.  Same routine: "because you are his father."    A very funny
bit (also in the original) is Dale about to commit suicide, a gun in
his mouth when the phone rings.  He talks with the gun in his mouth.
Dale is a "nebbish" for whom nothing ever went right.  He has all kinds
of phobias, cries easily and has a few suicide failures.     But
hearing that he has a son, he is delighted and asks no hard questions.
Yes,  he will be very happy to search for his son.</P>
<P>Then begins the search which includes visiting the father of the girl
with whom Scott ran away. Then visiting the girl's mother.  Each of
these adventures is very, very funny as only a one-two punch such as
Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, good friends in real life, can
deliver.   They work extremely well together to make this a most
enjoyable film. When you also have the two funniest screenwriters,
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who together wrote Night Shift, Splash,
Spies Like us, Parenthood, City Slicker I and II, A League of Their
Own, Greedy, Mr. Saturday Night  . and more, you cannot miss.</P>
<P>Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who is best known for starring  on the Seinfeld
show on TV, has a rather small part as Jack's wife.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Ivan Reitman
