<PRE>Galaxy Quest: neck deep in character</PRE>
<P>As we all know, Earth started polluting interstellar space with television
signals in 1939. Fast-forward 60-odd years now, into a reality for all
intents and purposes ours, except here Star Trek isn't Star Trek, but the
all-too similarly cloaked "Galaxy Quest." During those 60-odd years, too,
some of those escaped television signals have cultured an audience, in the
literal sense. Specifically, an alien audience without any notion of
'fiction,' meaning, to them, the cast of characters who comprise "Galaxy
Quest" are real, capable of heroics, etc. And yes, this has been done
before, once in Twilight Zone and more recently in Futurama, but now it's
feature length and packed with stars: Tim Allen as James Nesmith playing
Captain Taggart; Sigourney Weaver as Gwen Demarco playing busty Tawny
Madison; Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane reluctantly playing Dr. Lazarus;
more.</P>
<P>Too, it starts where all Trekkie-type stuff lives and breathes: at the
ubiquitous convention, done up per SNL. A cast of characters still wearing
their costumes 20 years after the show was cancelled, all of them fully
aware both of how ridiculous this all is and how, without it, they would
have nothing. Well, all of them are aware except for Nesmith, the 'captain,'
who's so addicted to the ego-rush associated with star treatment that he
continually ostracizes his fellow hangers-on. Soon enough he cues in that
he's a joke though, meaning his self-confidence dwindles to nothing. Which
of course sets Galaxy Quest up as now having somewhere to go, something to
do, a narrative arc to follow: regain Nesmith's self-confidence for him,
make him believe in himself again.</P>
<P>The bad thing about this is, though, that Nesmith's lived with 'Captain
Taggart' so long that the two are inextricable. Or, more than that, the
Taggart character is even the dominant one, where Nesmith really exists.
Solution? Get Taggart his self-confidence back, which is where the
ultra-naïve aliens enter: the best way to boost a starship captain's
self-confidence is to give him a real starship, one they've painstakingly
modeled after the cardboard one on television. It's the old Narnia fantasy,
where, if you're nobody in your 'real' life, just step into the closet, into
another world, where everybody knows your name.</P>
<P>Of course, however, restoring Taggart's faith in himself is just the aliens'
function. Their motivation, as it has to be, isn't so charitable: they just
want Taggart and crew to save them from some scary looking, Men in Black-ish
aliens. Which proves to be quite entertaining, watching the "Galaxy Quest"
crew come together as a team and wing their way through their old roles.
And, no, nothing that happens is really unexpected--including their
'savior,' who gets sorethumbed early on--but all the same, it's funny enough
and fast enough that it doesn't really matter. You don't go to Galaxy Quest
to be moved, after all, you go for the send-up, the adventure, the space
bloopers, for Tim Allen in another good role (The Santa Clause, Toy Story),
for Sigourney Weaver back in zero-gravity, with blond hair, fighting aliens
again. Really, the most difficult part of Galaxy Quest is trying to endure
all the kiddy trailers that are part of the package. If you can make it
through that, though, it's all 'second star on the left and on till dawn'
stuff from there on out, which is precisely the mix of Never-Never Land and
space opera we need, now that Kirk's out of the picture.</P>
