<PRE>Jackie Brown
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) There are a lot of things right in JACKIE BROWN, and they
all combine to form an entertaining, stimulating movie. </P>
<P>First, the plot is a twisty little caper which Tarantino adapted from an
Elmore Leonard novel (whose GET SHORTY also made the favorable jump to
the big screen). It involves a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who's a
small-time smuggler on the side. When the cops catch up to her and tell
her she either informs or to goes to jail, she informs. Then she tells
her "employer" about the cops. We can't tell what she's got in mind
because she's playing both sides, which keeps us interested and involved
in the story. </P>
<P>Second, the performances are top notch. The most surprising comes from
Robert Forster, a character actor who plays Max Cherry, a bail bondsman.
One is convinced that the person on the screen really is a bail bondsman
and not an actor. Samuel L. Jackson as crime boss Ordell Robbie and
Robert De Niro as his stoned sidekick Louis check in with their usual
badass performances. Pam Grier makes a solid showing as the title
character, though I don't see how she is irreplaceably perfect for the
role, as Tarantino has suggested (maybe he sees himself as the great
reviver of pop culture icons of the ‘70s). </P>
<P>Third, whether you like the look or not, Tarantino and production
designer David Wasco (who worked with Tarantino on PULP FICTION) have
created a unique style that successfully mixes elements of several
decades. The cop-funk music, the orange and brown interiors, and the
presence of Pam Grier all suggest the movie is set in the ‘70s. But
Jackson's millinery and long hair puts the movie in the ‘80s. The
pot-smoking blond beach girl and her VW bus pins the movie in the late
‘60s, while "Chicks with Guns" on the VCR reminds us that the real
setting is the ‘90s. </P>
<P>Finally, The cinematography and editing are fresh and interesting, but
they also serve the story  - they're not just there to show off.
(Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro has worked with Tarantino before.)
Early on, JACKIE BROWN looks like a student film. Long takes with a
static camera let scenes play out how they will. In fact, one of the
first shots of the movie is a long take showing Ordell and Louis on a
couch. After quite a while, Jackson orders his blond groupie to get some
ice. She was framed out of the picture and we didn't even know she
existed until the men became thirsty. It was a clever way to show
Ordell's disdain for women. </P>
<P>Toward the end, a critical scene is played out from a few different
perspectives, each revealing new and important details about the scene.
It was a nice little RASHOMON bit (or a CLUE: THE MOVIE bit for the
cynical among you) that drew out the tension of the scene and gave the
whole sequence some extra weight. Since it is critical to the story, the
extra weight is appropriate. </P>
<P>One final point is well worth mentioning. I am constantly surprised (and
pleasantly so) by how NORMAL people look in British movies. Actors are
chosen for how well they fit the parts and not for how many glamour
magazine covers they have filled. I think it's great that a 44-year old,
nonanorexic woman is the hero in this hip, slick, American movie. </P>
<P>Congratulations to Tarantino for proving himself an able filmmaker who
promises to change the face of Hollywood movies.</P>
