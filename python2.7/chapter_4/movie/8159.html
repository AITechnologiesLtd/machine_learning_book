<PRE>QUIZ SHOW 1994
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, John Turturro, Paul Scofield, David
Paymer, Mira Sorvino, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson Director: Robert
Redford Screenplay: Paul Attanasio based on REMEMBERING AMERICA: A VOICE
FROM THE SIXTIES by Richard N. Goodwin</P>
<P>Ask me a question, and I will guarantee you a correct answer (but first
tell me what the questions are before hand).</P>
<P>That's what cheating is all about. This is the subject of Quiz show. A
scandal that occurred in the 50's when ‘Twenty-One' was the biggest
ratings game show on television. Whenever the ratings fell, the network
would find new contestants to replace the sagging ones. They found their
biggest ratings winner in Charles Van Doren (Fiennes), the son of one of
America's leading intellectual family. That was until a inquest was made
into the affairs of the show.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the network (N.B.C.) escaped non-implicated. The
scapegoats for this embarrassing scam fell on the producers of the show,
and it's star contestant Van Doren, who bravely owned up to the
cheating. The issues of money, ratings, and human character are nicely
explored  in this movie. It probes the viewer's mind, as to whether you
would also cheat, if placed in a similar situation as Van Doren.</P>
<P>Crisp directing from Redford, intriguing movie material, and solid
performances from Fiennes and Turturro.</P>
<P>Comment: I'd like to see them try it on Jeopardy.</P>
