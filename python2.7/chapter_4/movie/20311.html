<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A most improbable but engaging romantic mystery that holds our attention
and teases our sensibilities. The first word out of Jay's (Novo) mouth
is sh-t, as he stands on the boardwalk at San Sebastian, ready to commit
suicide, after being jilted by his girlfriend and unable to work for the
last 4-years as a rock singer, with his group called Flies. Suddenly a
motorcycle crashes over the boardwalk railing onto the night's deserted
beach, and Jay foregoes his immediate suicide plans to rush to the aid
of the helmeted victim. To his surprise, he discovers that it's a
beautiful girl and upon questioning her discovers she is suffering from
amnesia and has no ID on her. As an impulse, when the ambulance arrives,
he tells the driver that her name is Lisa and that he is her boyfriend,
and proceeds to give her a big kiss. At the hospital, he supplies the
night receptionist, Salvador Fuentes (Lera), information that he makes
up about her, giving her the surname Fuentes that he takes from his
nametag. Later on, he will discover that the receptionist is her
brother.</P>
<P>Lisa sticks to her amnesia story and Jay sticks to his pursuit of her,
feeling rejuvenated by her presence in his life. When he is about to be
questioned in detail about her by the hospital staff, he sneaks her out
of the hospital and they take off together, heading for a camping resort
called "The Red Squirrel."</P>
<P>At the resort, they meet a meddlesome family who help them pitch a tent
and invite them over for dinner. There are signs that what is happening
to the two lovers is getting to be heavy, and what seems to be is not
exactly what is. But what is definetly happening, is that they are
making passionate love, and he is constantly inventing things he says
she did before she lost her memory. But, she doesn't passively accept
from him what he tells her.</P>
<P>When a radio message comes over the air, saying that a man named Felix
(Carmelo) is looking for his mentally deranged wife who ran away, the
description of her appearance is exactly like that of Lisa, even though
the name given for her is Sofia Fuentes. Well, the game is up for the
two lost souls, as the people in the campsite are not fooled and Felix
is tipped off where to find her, and when he arrives at the resort to
reclaim her, a battle begins with her new boyfriend.</P>
<P>The storyline is awkward, melodramatic and incredulous, and the ending
is somewhat ludicrous and overplayed, but what becomes interesting is
the psychological games played  by the couple. They explore their
identities and sexual cravings, trying to find out who they are and what
love means to them, all in the face of their insecurities and death
wishes and lies. The Basque director/writer has created a story with
enough twists in it to keep you guessing at what will happen next, but
the film left me with a bitter-sweet reaction to the romance.</P>
