<PRE>MAN ON THE MOON
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        It takes a comic genius to play a comic genius.  Andy Kaufman was
indeed that.  Jim Carrey is indeed that.</PRE>
<P>        "Man on the Moon" is Milos Forman's biopic of the late "Taxi" star
who succumbed to a rare strain of lung cancer following a short-lived
career carved out by an eccentric style of humor and elaborate pranks that
kept his audiences guessing.</P>
<P>        As brilliantly realized by Carrey, Kaufman was a neurotic (some say
psychotic) who turned traditional notions of stand-up comedy on their head.
Kaufman's idea of entertaining a room full of college students, for
example, is to read them "The Great Gatsby," cover to cover, with a dubious
British accent.  "Now *that's* funny."  We never really know what makes
Kaufman tick in "Man on the Moon," but it never seems to matter--the road
traveled is a sad, funny, and remarkable one, made all the more remarkable
by Carrey's unnervingly accurate portrayal.</P>
<P>        Forman pulls us into the comedian's twisted, singularly manic world
early on, with black and white, pre-credits footage of Kaufman (Carrey)
telling us that this film is over before it even begins.  In some ways, it
is.  And for Kaufman, in a lot of ways it was.</P>
<P>        Kaufman is discovered by agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who
witnesses his cutting-edge stand-up act in an improv comedy club.  "You're
insane, but you might also be brilliant" he tells Kaufman over dinner.
Soon after, Shapiro offers Kaufman a part in a sitcom called "Taxi" (with
Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, and Christopher Lloyd all reprising
their roles; the years have been kinder to them than you'd expect).
Believing sitcoms to be the lowest form of entertainment, Kaufman will only
agree to the contract if certain conditions are met.  His terms include his
own television special (creative control assumed) and four guest
appearances on "Taxi" by some no-name Vegas lounge singer called Tony
Clifton.  Tony who?  The network top brass don't seem to care and Kaufman
is on the payroll.</P>
<P>        Tony Clifton, it turns out, is really one of Kaufman's many
alter-egos.  Keep 'em guessing indeed.  "Kaufman is Clifton, and Clifton is
Kaufman" waxes Shapiro.  "You get two Kaufman's for the price of one."
Actually, *we* get two Carreys for the price of one (and one Carrey is
usually more than enough for any one movie).  Like everything else in
Kaufman's repertoire, Tony Clifton is just another gag, just another
fabrication to get him onto that next rung of the show business ladder.
Unconsciously, the abrasive Tony Clifton signaled the beginning of
Kaufman's self-inflicted decline.  The self-proclaimed "song and dance man"
was beginning to alienate his audiences now and, while Kaufman could still
fill auditoriums with ease, he was often times guilty of playing to an
audience of one.  Himself.</P>
<P>        Successful and unsuccessful appearances on "Saturday Night Live"
follow.  Then "Taxi" is canceled.  His transcendental meditation doesn't
seem to be helping.  Kaufman starts a new gig--inter-gender wrestling in
Memphis--where he meets a woman called Lynne (Courtney Love, powder fresh
from Forman's previous biopic "The People vs. Larry Flynt"), pisses off a
whole lot of God-fearing Southern women, and starts a brawl on "Letterman."
Oh, and then he gets cancer.  All part of the act?  Many--family members
included--aren't convinced.</P>
<P>        Andy Kaufman was a wild and crazy guy.  Jim Carrey is a wild and
crazy guy.  Together, they make for fascinating cinema in Milos Forman's
stellar "Man on the Moon."</P>
