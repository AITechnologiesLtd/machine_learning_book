'Ronin'</PRE>
<PRE>by Simon Calloway</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Robert De Niro; Jean Reno </PRE>
<P> Ronin is easily the best car-chase film I have ever seen.  It contains scenes
so thrilling, I had to grip my seat til the car came to a crash ending.  The
film reminded my of the 1997-Kurt Russell film Breakdown, in the sense that
both films are breathtaking at filming suspense-filled chase scenes.</P>
<P> The story of Ronin is rather complicated.  All I can say is that a bunch of
international espionage, ex-KGB, ex- CIA operatives form an elite in Paris to
thwart a briefcase from a power man who is hand-cuffed to it.  What is in the
case, I will not say.  Although, Sam (De Niro) really wants to find out.</P>
<P> The rest of Ronin contains the group (also including Reno) trying to get the
case from the "unlucky blok" with ways that even James Bond may have looked
negatively at.  But, Ronin looks 100 percent real, compaired to 1997's 007
Tomorrow Never Dies.</P>
<PRE> Do Sam and the gang get the briefcase?  I won't tell.  </PRE>
<P> Ronin is a fast-paced, thrilling, expertly-crafted, excellently acted spy film
that put my faith back into action movies (1997's Con Air pretty much destroyed
all of my expectations).</P>
