<PRE>                           OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     The latest entry on the long list of follow-up disappointments will
have to be OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE, a film sort-of from the Farrelly brothers
(THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) with practically none of its charm.</P>
<P>     Based on an old novel by Peter Farrelly, this is the (obviously
autobiographical to some extent) tale of a good-for-nothing, super-poor
kid called Dunph (Hatosy) growing up in Pawtucket, Rhode Island (you
know, outside Providence).  When he gets high and smashes the car into a
police cruiser, dad somehow works a deal to get him sent to a prep
school in Connecticut, where he finds himself a fish out of water.</P>
<P>     Now Dunph is so stupid that he actually thinks Arizona is on the
coast.  But when he meets a cute girl (Smart) she mends his evil ways
and gets him to study.  There's wacky hijinx along the way (a pale
imitation of DEAD POETS SOCIETY), which really amounts to a collection
of random scenes involving heavy drug use, various pranks, mean school
authorities, and George Wendt's character inexplicably coming out of the
closet.</P>
<P>     Most notable among the players here is Alec Baldwin, apparently
doing his best grumpy Jackie Gleeson impersonation as Dunph's father.
All of the other players are pretty much forgettable.  Which is why,
ultimately, this is a movie that goes nowhere after close to two hours.</P>
<P>     Is it funny?  Occasionally, and fans of the coming-of-age genre
will probably be satisfied.  Is it Cameron Diaz-hair gel funny?  Not
even an outside chance.</P>
