<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Who is The Eye?  We learn from the opening scene that he's some kind of
stealthy spy with enough hi-tech gadgetry to make Q drive off the road.
He totes a cool digital camera that can not only capture sound and
images from great distances, but also serves as a rifle.  As the film
opens, The Eye snaps some photographs of a guy putting the stones to the
company floozy in his office located across the street.  Before the guy
can even pull his pants up, The Eye has sent the pictures to every
computer and fax machine in his workplace.</P>
<P>After this initial episode, we learn a little more about The Eye.  He
checks in with his headquarters via a bossy liaison named Hilary (k.d.
lang), who fills in a few more blanks – The Eye is a loner that prefers
video conferencing to actual human contact.  Presumably he's like this
because of some tragedy that happened to his wife and daughter, the
latter of whom haunts The Eye's days and nights.  Hilary tells him that
his next assignment is to tail the boss' son, who is pilfering funds
from his trust fund.</P>
<P>As The Eye begins to work the case, he becomes infatuated with a
mysterious woman (Ashley Judd, Double Jeopardy) and abandons his work to
peep at her every move.  He's drawn further into her peculiar world
after witnessing her murder a gentleman caller and washing the blood off
of her naked body in the middle of a rainstorm.  Instead of making him
back off, The Eye proceeds to follow her around the country and watch as
she bumps other men off.  He trails her to Pittsburgh, New York, San
Francisco and all points boring and, at one point, stops to fondle the
wall of his hotel room bath while the mystery girl washes up on the
other side (yes, you get to see both of her Judds and the crack of her
Ashley).  And just when it seems like things can't get any dumber, in
marches Jason Priestley, who does a bottle-blond impression of James
Gandolfini in True Romance.</P>
<P>Oh, yeah, The Eye is played by Ewan McGregor (Phantom Menace), who
successfully makes his character seem creepy, tortured and
sleep-deprived in each scene.  It's the second McGregor film in a row
where the Scotsman doesn't show `little Ewan,' and, ironically, these
are his only two films that have opened number one at the box office.
Moral:  Keep it in your pants.    It's too bad he doesn't have a better
story to show off his talent (I mean big Ewan).</P>
<P>The script was written by Aussie director Stephan Elliott (The
Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert), who adapted it from Marc
Behm's novel of the same name.  And, brother, it's a mess.  You never
get a clear idea of what The Eye is trying to accomplish by stalking
this girl.  Is he trying to be her guardian angel?  Is he trying to
catch her?  Is he focusing his attention on her to make up for not
paying enough attention to his kid?  Or is he just a dirty Peeping Tom?
Don't ask me – I have no idea.  In the book, The Eye actually follows
his dream girl for ten years.  Here, it seems like two weeks.  Tops.</P>
<P>There are some pretty cool things in the film.  There are decent
visuals, especially when Elliott uses snow domes to blend into reality.
The score (Marius de Vries, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet) is
moody and atmospheric, and the cinematography (Guy Dufaux, Jesus of
Montreal) is pleasantly bleak.  There are some things that don't work,
either, like the fact that The Eye tries to remain inconspicuous in
public while wearing a bright red coat.  But the main problem is with
the story, which seems oddly foreign.  Eye was filmed in Quebec with a
French-Canadian crew and has actually already been made into a film –
1993's Mortelle randonnée (Deadly Run), with Michel Serrault and
Isabelle Adjani.</P>
<P>1:47 - R for some strong violence, nudity, adult situations, language
and brief drug content</P>
