<P>He does his own stunts. He has broken almost every bone in his
body. He has survived hardships that no one can imagine. But for the
past 18 years, Jackie Chan has not survived the importation to
America. While his previous films have been enjoyable (some are
classics of the genre), their inherent foreignness has left Middle
America with a lukewarm appreciation of the man and his
abilities. Compiled with the fact that all of his previous films have
been severely edited for western consumption, have left most viewers
with only a glimpse of what Jackie Chan is.</P>
<P>Jackie has tried to enter the U.S. market before. Back in 1979 with
the release of "The Big Brawl" which while amusing was a half baked
concoction of ideas, that never really let Jackie's abilities shine
through. Add to this, the embarrassing "Cannonball Run" films and you
can pretty much appreciate why no one out side of the coasts knew who
this funny looking Asian was. A pitiful attempt to mold Jackie into a
'Dirty Harry' character in the James Glickenhaus directed
embarrassment "The Protector" did nothing here stateside, in fact
almost becoming a direct to video release.</P>
<P>In 1996, New Line Cinema released "Rumble in the Bronx"
nationwide. The film opened at # 1 in the box-office becoming the
first dubbed in English foreign film in history to do so. It stayed on
top long enough to make over $30 million. Jackie was now a star in the
U.S. But there was still a problem. American studios still felt that
his films were too foreign for the multiplexes in North Dakota and
Wisconsin. So all of Jackie's subsequent releases have been truncated,
reprocessed and re-imagined for the American Market. Now after all of
this tampering and off-handed redesigning of who is called the modern
day successor to Buster Keaton, we have New Line's latest release
'RUSH HOUR'.</P>
<P>"Rush Hour" starts off in Hong Kong on the eve of the British handover
of the Island colony to mainland China. Detective Inspector Lee
(Jackie Chan) busts a smuggling operation in the harbor, recovering
millions of dollars worth of Chinese art and historical artifacts from
the criminal mastermind Juntao. Detective Lee reports to his superior
Consul Han (Tzi Ma) during a celebratory dinner in honor of his new
position as American Consul to the U.S. for the new government. Upon
arriving in America, Consul Han's daughter, Soo Yung (Julia Hsu), is
kidnapped and held for ransom.</P>
<P>We cut to downtown Los Angeles where Detective James Carter (Chris
Tucker) is undercover making a buy of illegal
explosives. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong and Carter is on
reprimand until the FBI request his aid in retaining Detective
Inspector Lee who is on his way to Los Angeles to help his friend
Consul Han and his unofficial goddaughter Soo Yung.</P>
<P>As the plot develops, it seems that the villain, Juntao is responsible
for the kidnapping. The constant bickering and animosity between
Carter and Lee creates more confusion than help, until the two men
grudgingly decide to work together, outside of the official
investigation.</P>
<P>The plot of "Rush Hour" is workable if not too demanding. There are a
couple of surprises, but nothing that we haven't seen before. As
written by Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna the plot moves along at a fast
clip making for an enjoyable diversion. What makes the film work is
the casting of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as polar
opposites. Tucker's character is a voracious self promoter, always
ready to spin his destructive procedures into positive ones by coning
his way through reprimands. Jackie's, on the other hand is an
honorable policeman, upholding his duty and his responsibility to both
his title and his friends. The humor that develops through these
situations is what makes 'Rush Hour' so enjoyable. Chris Tucker is
from the same mold as Eddie Murphy in the '48 hours' films, fast
talking and always ready to prove himself in a foolish attempt of
machismo. It's the inclusion of Jackie Chan (who is reigned in here,
not so much by the script but by insurance concerns), that brings this
film up to a higher level. As the two characters conspire against each
other, it's Jackie that takes center stage with his trade make fight
choreography (absolutely some of the most startling and inventive
fight scenes in an American film). A fight in a seedy pool hall is a
tour de force of jay dropping amusement.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Brett Ratner's direction is rather flatly
handled. Everything is standard framing with nothing to enliven the
action or emphasize the drama. In most cases the camera is locked down
with little or no movement. The cinematography by Adam Greenberg
(Terminator, Terminator 2) is acceptable in as much as this film is
produced with the video release kept close at hand. Everything is
framed within the center of the frame with very little moving off to
the outer edges. This is the most maddening essence of the film and
one of the damming situations that the video entertainment industry
has left us with. Very few filmmakers now, film for the theatrical
screen.</P>
<P>But all that aside, how does "Rush Hour" fit into the overi of Jackie
Chan? Well to be honest, this is less a Jackie Chan film as it is a
Chris Tucker film. But that being said, Jackie is anything but window
dressing in the film. This is no where as unimpressive as 'The Big
Brawl' or as insulting as "The Protector". Jackie's character while
being a harder edge man than is usual in his films, still manages to
apply his light hearted approach to action. Also, the handling of
Jackie's accent and difficulty with the English language is used to
remarkably humorous result (wait till you hear his rendition of the
rock classic "WAR.. what's it good for"). There are some scenes of
racial insensitivity, but those are in keeping with the stranger in a
strange land essence of Jackie's character and Chris Tucker's
loudmouth fast-talker. There is nothing here that is meanspirited or
offensive in and of itself.</P>
<P>And Jackie does get two or three great scenes to show of his daring
do, and since most Western audiences have yet to witness Jackie at his
most intense (check out "POLICE STORY" or "DRAGON'S FOREVER") for some
hair-raising action), "Rush Hour is a fine introduction to the man and
his mania.</P>
<P>Despite it's short comings "Rush Hour" delivers a solid two hours of
entertainment. While some of the language is harsh, this is much more
friendly than any other buddy cop movie that's come down the pike in
the last ten years.</P>
<P>On a scale of 5 stars. 'Rush Hour' rates 3 and one half.
A fun and enjoyable piece of escapism that serves both stars well.
Now.. when does Jackie get to direct?!</P>
