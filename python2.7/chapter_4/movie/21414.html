<P>   The latest food fight between France and England appears
to be about the quality of beef, but look below the surface
and you may find the talk of boycotts and vengeance to be
little more than an excuse to communicate hostility.  I suspect
that the folks in these two neighboring countries don't like
one another very much.  Given the length of European
memories, who could blame them?  The two formerly great
powers have been at each other's throats a number of times
during the past millennium dating back at least to the 14th
century when they fought the so-called Hundred Years' War. 
Who today sides with the French in that disaster?  Among
others, Luc Besson is one--naturally--and he directs "The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" with a decidedly
Francophile bent.  The English are portrayed as a bunch of
sadists with caricatured features, full of obscene speech and
reckless taunts, in one case even engaging in a mind-
boggling act of necrophilism.</P>
<P>   Though not the first version of the epic story of the teen-
aged heroine who inspired her people to victory against the
invaders, Besson's "Joan" has a distinctly 1990s flair,
pandering to the MTV generation with swiftly-edited
flashbacks and surreal visions, abandoning poetic pretensions
in favor of a simple, rustic dialogue.  To his inestimable
credit, however, Besson--whose contributions to cinema
include the dazzling "La femme Nikita" (about yet another
sort of puckish French heroine)--avoids the excesses of Baz
Luhrmann's "Romeo and Juliet," an all-out kowtow to teens
and 20-somethings.  By genuflecting to modernity in language
and cinematography within moderation, Besson bestows on
us the most audience-friendly and humorous of cinema and
TV's productions about the legendary French fighter.  If Milla
Jovovich, who dominates the 140-minute film, looks older
than the nineteen-year-old she plays, that flaw can be easily
overlooked when we consider that her passionate
performance is nuanced enough to give us pause.  After
viewing "The Messenger," we wonder whether one of French
history's greatest persons, who was made a saint half a
millennium after her noble needs, may have been not so
much a devout visionary but an out-and-out lunatic, even a
schizophrenic--her disabilities actually contributing to her
heroism.</P>
<P>   Photographed in the Czech Republic and in the Loire
Valley region of France, Besson's rendition of the familiar tale
selectively runs through aspects of Joan's life that every
schoolchild used to know by heart.  At the time of Joan's birth
in Domeremy 1412 or thereabouts, the French and the
English were in the midst of a Hundred Years' War.  While
English invaders were harassing French soldiers, the region
now known as France was undergoing a civil war of its own,
the province of Burgundy actually fighting on the English side. 
Charles VII is intent on holding on to the territory under his
command and on being crowned king by the Church in the
traditional manner, in the city of Rheims--now under English
control.  Nothing short of a miracle appears able to liberate
Rheims from the invader, and Joan is to supply that marvel.  </P>
<P>   When Joan as a young girl witnesses the burning of her
village by the English and the rape-murder of her beloved
sister by a crazed English soldier, she is bent on vengeance
against all the enemy and, devout though she may be is
unable to forgive or to turn the other cheek.  Five years after
the trauma, Joan (Milla Jovovich) is determined to raise an
army under her command, but to do so she needs to
convince Charles, the Dauphin (John Malkovich), to turn his
army over to her command.  By this time, Joan has become
known throughout her world as the woman who hears the
voice of God commanding her to throw the invaders out. 
Convincing Charles of her mandate, she gets the army, fights
fiercely in vigorously photographed battles, but at the very
point at which Paris is within her grasp, she is sold out by the
now crowned King Charles VII--who is tired of her ravings
and eager to end hostilities against the English by diplomatic
compromise.  What happens to Joan after that is the stuff of
legend or chronicle, depending on your feelings about the
accuracy of the historical record.</P>
<P>   Though Milla Jovovich looks older and more sophisticated
than the illiterate 19-year-old peasant, she performs her role
well, with an acting range that goes from off-the-wall
dementia to testosterone-flamed semi-lunacy.  Jovovich, not 
a well-known performer except to those who remember her
from Spike Lee's "He Got Game" and Luc Besson's "The
Fifth Element," seems to have captured Joan's fire and, for
all we know, her outrageous visions that in a person of lesser
scope would be dismissed as schizoid ravings.  John
Malkovich at Charles VII provides much of the comic relief as
the man who would be king even if the coronation results in a
sell-out of his adjunct.  Being John Malkovich, he is
alternately coy, befuddled, weak-willed and amusing.  I
suspect, though, that audience judgments about this latest
"Joan" will depend on its tolerance, nay its enthusiasm or
lack of same, for Besson's determined modernization. 
Though the MTV-like flashbacks lack variety and the images
of God appearing first as rays of light piercing fast-moving
clouds, then as an actual, human Jesus caressing His
messenger, may strike some as kitsch, I found myself
sponging up the director's conceits throughout.  My view is
this: if in the 15th century, the characters in the armies would
appear all-too-human, their language filled with the local
slang and colloquialisms, why not translate those signs into
the current vernacular--even utilizing expressions as
obnoxious as this century's favorite filler, "y'know"?  If the
armies react to the burning arrows and speeding horses with
wide-eyed, caricatured wonder, why not come right out and
show the battle-weary troops with all their exaggerated
gestures and tics?</P>
<P>   The redesign works best in three scenes.  In one, a
bloodthirsty, barbaric English soldier, impatient with his
squirming rape victim, plunges a sword through her middle
and proceeds to rape the lifeless body to the amazed stares
of his slightly less brutal compatriots.  In another, Joan is
severely wounded by an arrow fired at close range as she is
ascending the fortress walls of the English.  She falls twenty-
five feet into the hands of her fellow soldiers in much the way
a modern-day purveyor of weekend "trust" seminars would
allow herself to plop limply and happily into the waiting arms
of her pals-in-therapy.  An extended scene between the
imprisoned Joan and her Conscience (Dustin Hoffman) allows
the viewers to raise doubts in their own minds about the
validity of Joan's visions and her motivations.</P>
<P>   When Aristophanes penned the play "Lysistrata" some two
and one-half millennia ago--a comedy about how the Greek
women locked their husbands out of their bedrooms until the
men lay down their arms--he hinted that wars and violence
are the exclusive province of the testosterone-bearers.  If
true, credit Joan as an exception.  If women must
occasionally lead the men into the fray, the cause, though,
would have to be just, the women convinced of its rightness.
Luc Besson adds to this contention with a film that does not
have the grandeur, the poetry, the range of "Lawrence of
Arabia" but makes up for its shortcomings by being eminently
user-friendly.</P>
