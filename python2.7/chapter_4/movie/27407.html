<PRE>                                  DOUBLE TAKE
                         A film review by Max Messier

<P>New year, new pile of movies straight from the Hollywood dumping ground
of badly test-screened, obscure, unfunny, and badly acted garbage. 
Double Take is the first pony out of the gate.  I don't know which is
the worst part of the film: Eddie Griffin's overacting, Orlando Jones'
non-acting, or the ugly mutt that passes as Griffin's sidekick.</P>
<P>Orlando Jones does a better job in those 7-Up commercials than in the
role of Darryl Chase, an uptight investment banker set up by a
combination of the CIA, the FBI, a Mexican drug cartel, the Federales,
and an emu farmer as part of a double murder/embezzlement scheme. 
Running from the law, Chase changes clothes and identity with Freddy
Tiffany, a two-bit hustler named played by Eddie Griffin he encounters
on the street.  Together, the pair travel across the country to Mexico,
where a certain CIA agent holds the key to Chase's freedom.  And of
course, during the journey, Darryl Chase rediscovers his roots as a
black man while Freddy Tiffany shucks and jives his way through every
situation like he's the bastard son of Eddie Murphy and Jerry Lewis.</P>
<P>After numerous car chases, way too many plot "twists," the
aforementioned annoying dog, the bad acting of Vivica A. Fox, and too
many jokes about a glass eye, the movie becomes a science project left
in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer.  Orlando Jones, a
genuinely talented actor/writer, seems out of place here, annoyed by the
film and especially by his costar's lack of acting ability.  Griffin has
the energy of Tito Puente, the humor of Richard Pryor, and the acting
ability of former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth.  Jones
deserves better material and collaborators.</P>
<P>It's a shame that Double Take is as bad as it is, because this cinematic
travesty was written and directed by George Gallo, the screenwriter of
one of the funniest films of the 1980's, Midnight Run (the plot of which
bears a striking similarity to this film).  Here are a few bonus facts
to consider if you haven't bought my evaluation: The film is based on an
obscure 1950's English film starring Rod Steiger called Across the
Bridge.  It took more than a decade to get the green light for
production.  It describes itself as a cross between "film noir, a
thriller, and a comedy."</P>
<PRE>I call it pure crap.</PRE>
