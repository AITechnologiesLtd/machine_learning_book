<PRE>                            THE WINSLOW BOY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: David Mamet reworks the classic play
          by Terence Rattigan.  A 12-year-old boy accused of
          stealing a five-shilling postal order maintains his
          innocence.  Like the Dreyfus case in France, this
          legal case throws all of Britain into controversy.
          Well-acted, but this film is too faithful to a
          stage play that frustratingly distances the
          audience from the characters and the action.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Every medium has its own constraints that pull it away from being
realistic.  Silent film acting is very much pantomime that must convey
much more than photo-realism would.  A three-act stage play must tell
an entire story from three points in time.  Each must have a single or
perhaps two locations.  This is why plays adapted to film often seem
claustrophobic and stagebound.  There is an entire art to adapting
stage plays to the screen without making them unbearable.  Connecting
scenes set in the out of doors will frequently be inserted.</P>
<P>     The play THE WINSLOW BOY by Terence Rattigan is an old favorite in
England.  Supposedly every little English hamlet with a theater company
has performed it one time or another.  It is a David and Goliath story
or one small boy against the British Admiralty.  A young naval cadet is
accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order.  The boy maintains
his innocence but is expelled from school nonetheless.  The Admiralty
insists they need only satisfy themselves of his guilt.  The Winslow
family supports the boy and resolutely demands a trial.  Meanwhile
somehow the case gets national attention and the country is torn on the
issue.</P>
<P>     David Mamet has adapted the play for the screen and has added some
generally inconsequential short scenes around the original major
scenes.  The major scenes all take place in the Winslow mansion, which
means they are divorced from the action.  In a more standard film
format, the storyteller would have the choice of showing or not showing
the stealing of the postal order and the resulting trial.  A three-act
stage play has too much territory to cover to have a scene at the
school or in a courtroom.  After the first scene in which we find the
boy has been accused of the crime, suddenly and jarringly we jump
forward months and the issue is already a national controversy.  How
such a minor issue could have become so important is totally lost.
Most films would have many scenes covering the interim.  And perhaps in
Britain what happened might also be common knowledge.  Here it appears
like there is a great whopping chunk of missing narrative.  One woman
near me in the audience was convinced for a while that reels were being
shown out of order because we had missed so much of the narrative.</P>
<P>     The actors are all playing people of the British upper crust.
They are people who have been trained to be dry and detached, even
among their own family.  This makes the film seem rather dry and
bloodless though one has a good idea what emotions are going on just
under the surface.</P>
<P>     Guy Edwards plays the accused Ronnie Winslow and Nigel Hawthorne
plays the father who is so standoffish to the boy but is willing to let
his family be destroyed rather than allowing what he accepts as a false
accusation stand.  Much like Dr. Stockmann in Ibsen's AN ENEMY OF THE
PEOPLE, he clearly loves his family but is willing to let his health be
ruined and his family be destroyed over a principle.  The central
characters however become Rebecca Pidgeon (of Mamet's THE SPANISH
PRISONER) as Catherine Winslow, Ronnie's older sister, and Jeremy
Northam as Sir Robert Morton, whom the family has defend Ronnie.  There
is a definite romantic tension between them on the screen.  Both seem
to recognize an attraction between each other but being oh-so-veddy-
proper it always remains frustratingly just below the surface.</P>
<P>     That seems to be the problem with THE WINSLOW BOY.  There is just
too much following of rules.  The two main characters cannot get
together; Mamet cannot show us the most dramatic scenes of the Winslow
case.  The whole thing is so correct and reserved that the viewer feels
a little cheated when all is said and done (with too much on the screen
said and not enough done).  Mamet is to be commended for setting
frustrating constraints on himself and for sticking with them at the
expense of dramatic impact.  But he probably should have cheated a
little to make this a better narrative.  I rate THE WINSLOW BOY 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
