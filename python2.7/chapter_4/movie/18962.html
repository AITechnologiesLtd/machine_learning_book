<P>SCREAM 2 by DeWyNGaLe (John Sylva)    Rating: A</P>
<P>In 1996, Scream took moviegoers by storm, giving them a new type of film to
enjoy and look forward to.  The slasher genre was reborn, and a new generation
was introduced to the popular 80s film type.  Many were skeptical about a
sequel to the classic film, saying that the entire horror genre was destroyed
by sequels, and if a sequel to a great one was released, it would ruin it once
again.  That's not the case with the worthy sequel Scream 2 though.  </P>
<P>Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott, now a student at Windsor
College, a nice school in southern Ohio.  She has moved on from the terror the
occurred when she lived in Woodsboro, California, where her mother, and a
various amount of friends were murdered by a killer dressed in a black robe and
a ghostface mask.  Since the events two years ago, survivor Gale Weathers,
played by the returning Courteney Cox, has written a book based on the events
that she experienced, called The Woodsboro Murders.  Much to Sidney's
disliking, a movie based on the popular book has been made, called "Stab." 
After the murders start occurring once again, Dewey, another survivor from the
original makes his way from California to Ohio to protect Sidney.  Along with
Dewey, Sidney's friendly roommate Hallie, played by the lesser known Elise
Neal.  She is the most likable character in the movie, and Neal makes you feel
for her character, especially when she comes face to face with Mr. Ghostface.  </P>
<P>Also attending Sidney's college is survivor Randy Meeks, played by the funny
Jamie Kennedy.  Now that all of the survivors are together once again,
including Gale Weathers, the killer has them right where they want them.  The
killer begins copying what Billy Loomis and Stu Macher, the killers from the
original, accomplished two years ago, only this time they want Sidney, Dewey,
Gale, and Randy dead.  The killer ends up going beyond the point where they
just want to kill the surviving foursome, killing anyone that they have a
problem with or that gets in their way.</P>
<P>Compared to the original, Scream 2 lives up in almost every way. One key point
that didn't live up, which hurt the overall effect, to the original was the
opening sequence.  In the original, (spoiler) Casey Becker, played wonderfully
by Drew Barrymore, was murdered while getting ready to watch a movie in her
very own home.  Scream 2 tries to copycat the original, making another
horrifying opening scene, but falls short in predictability. (End spoiler)  </P>
<P>Throw together Neve Campbell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O'Connell, Jada
Pinkett, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, and you get one of
the best teen casts you could ever ask for.  Neve Campbell and Sarah Michelle
Gellar's names alone will bring hundreds of teenagers to the movie, wanting to
see their teen idols.  Just because Scream 2 appeals to teens, and mostly
teens, that doesn't mean it isn't a high quality film.  It's amazing what an
actor can do when you throw a killer with a knife at them.  For that two hours
the film lasts, Neve Campbell and company become different people, and you feel
like you are watching real beings, not characters that were created by Kevin
Williamson's imaginative mind.  Especially in the eerie movie theater scene, I
felt a little like I was in the movie myself.</P>
<P>The entire premise of the film is that sequels are bad movies, but Wes Craven
made a film about sequels being bad without actually making the movie bad. 
Writer Kevin Williamson must have had a lot of courage to write a screenplay
this edgy.  Speaking of Williamson, he is becoming one of today's best known
movie scribes.  After penning the marvelous Scream and Scream 2, I Know What
You Did Last Summer, The Faculty, and the upcoming Teaching Mrs. Tingle, he
should become a legend.  I felt that in Scream 2, Williamson tried a little bit
too hard to make it as good as the original, where he didn't need to at all.</P>
<P>On the edge of your seat is where you will be while viewing Scream 2, because
the suspense level is much greater than in the original.  More chase scenes,
more hiding scenes, and yes- more gore.  Scream 2 lowers the level of the
original on pop outs, which is disappointing, but the chase scenes are very
memorable.  Unfortunately, Scream 2 falls to the predictability level at some
points, as many slasher films do.  Those trailers gave away a little too much
if you can piece it all together.</P>
<P>Scream 2 will open up the door for the slasher genre even more.  It already has
somewhat, with films being released such as Halloween : H20, Urban Legend, I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer, among many others.  All of these have been
worthy horror films, but they are starting to go downhill.  Let's hope Scream
3, which will be in theaters December 10th, will revive my faith in brilliant
horror films. </P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Keep us screaming Neve! </P>
