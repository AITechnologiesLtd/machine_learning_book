<P>   "Closure" is a fashionable word nowadays.  People want
closure, meaning, they want to avoid the tension of having
something hanging in the air, or, to be more specific, if you
shave one side of your face, you're not going to feel
comfortable until you finish the job.  Jerry Bruckheimer
believed that the audience would leave the theater tense after
"Pearl Harbor" unless he threw in a feel-good ending that had
nothing to do with the attack at Oahu.  But here's an
exception.  Watch "Tortilla Soup" and you won't get that
feeling of ahhhh.  You'll leave the theater hungry, and that
means the picture worked.  Featuring food and menus
created and designed by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan
Feniger of TV Food Network's "Too Hot Tamales," Maria
Ripoll's "Tortilla Soup," which was inspired and based closely
on Ang Lee's Oscar-nominated "Eat Drink Man Woman," stars
the delicious food which is brought virtually and enticingly to
our mouths by closeups from Lulu Zezza's food photography
(though the principal camerawork is by Marian Sanchez de
Antunano).  If this film were in IMAX 3-D you'd have the
added frustration of putting the gourmet morsels into your
mouth without tasting a thing.</P>
<P>   Without tasting a thing is the unusual plight of Hector
Elizondo, the human star, in the role of Martin, an
extraordinary chef who cannot taste what he prepares in his
successful L.A. Mexican restaurant.  He must rely on his
sense of smell to knock out dishes that, we are told, are
traditional to Mexican cuisine exclusively--but darned if I had
ever seen mouthfuls like these in any Tex-Mex, Cal-Mex, or
even the gourmet eateries in Mexico City's Zona Rosa.  When
we're not spending time watching Ms. Ripoll's version of The
Mexican Chef, we're absorbed by the tribulations of the three
daughters that Martin has brought up as a single parent, his
wife having died some 15 years earlier.  The three sisters are
Chekhovian in their own way.  While they have no desire to
go to Moscow, they do want to have their own lives but are
kept in tow by their traditional dad who uses food to glue the
family together.  The young women are so different from one
another you'd scarcely know they are family.</P>
<P>   Using a script by Tom Musca, Ramon Menendez and Vera
Blasi, Maria Ripoll displays for us some closely bound people
who, like a breakfast dish of chilaquiles can salsa roja look
festive on the outside but are simmering within.  A food movie
containing more romance than "The Big Night" and none of
the surrealism of "Like Water for Chocolate," "Tortilla Soup"
allows us to look in on the lives of the family beauty: Carmen
(Jacqueline Obradors), who must choose between taking a
well-paid high-tech job in Barcelona and remaining in L.A. to
serve as a chef in her dad's restaurant; Letitcia (Elizabeth
Pena), a chemistry teacher, whose love for Jesus seems to
exclude the possibility of men; and the flippant Maribel
(Tamara Mello), whose plans for college seem ready to
change after she meets the free-spirited Brazilian, Andy
(Nikolai Kinski).  The romantic interludes are mirrored in
Martin himself, who is being hit upon by his motormouth
neighbor, Hortensia (Raquel Welsh, who at 61 looks as good
as she ever did).</P>
<P>   "Tortilla Soup" is a family drama that's just made for
ensemble acting, and we are not disappointed by any of the
group who play so well together. Hector Elizondo, who has
been in eighty-five film and TV productions, stands out for his
ability to coax a thoroughly natural performance as patriarch
who is never really as stern as his girls make him out to be
and who must learn to hang loose and acquire some taste.  If
you'll excuse me now, I'm hungry.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C)2001,
