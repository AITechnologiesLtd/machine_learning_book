<PRE>                              JERRY MAGUIRE
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1996 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>On the way to the theater today, I was in a huge rush and I almost
missed the coming attractions (something I hate to do.)  In fact, I
almost said "skip this movie" all together.  But I'm glad I didn't.</P>
<P>This movie started out with Mr. Cruise himself playing sports agent
Jerry Maguire. He's a hot shot and a hotdogger all the way.  Until one
seemingly normal night he's watching TV.  He thinks for a second, then
starts writing on his computer.  He keeps writing for 25 pages until he
finally comes up with his "mission proposal".  He makes copies for
everyone.  The one quote everybody see "Less Clients, More Attention".
For saying this, he's fired from SMI, an office of agents, (I bet they
have one heck of a Christmas party!) and consequently lose almost every
client he has.</P>
<P>This is something I stick to, no plot details.  I think many reviewers
go too far and give away most of the movie, but not me.</P>
<P>Anyway, here's why I enjoyed this movie.</P>
<P>The cast was super.  Everyone and I mean EVERYONE turns in great
performances.  Especially Johnathan Lipnicki, a small tot, that couldn't
have been more than about 3 or 4.</P>
<P>Also, excellent writing and direction.  The script showed Maguires
downfall with in-your-face force, you can't help but leave your seat
without thinking about what you just saw.</P>
<P>Excellent cameos.  Sports stars from Troy Aikman to Roy Firestone and a
great cameo by Eric Stoltz.</P>
<P>This overall was a super movie.  It shows Mr. Cruise in a new, fresh way
that everyone will appreciate.</P>
