<P>     There are two basic kinds of "family films" that come to your local
multiplex.  In one category are those that genuinely deserve the name
"family film," the kind that can actually keep an adult entertained while
remaining appropriate for kids.  In the other category are the generally
inspid, generally TV-based tales made exclusively for non-discriminating
sub-teens.  With no experience of the television series on which it was
based, I went into DOUG'S 1st MOVIE expecting the latter.  Instead, I
found something halfway between the two:  a good-natured, good-humored
kids' film that actually treated young viewers as though they had
intelligence.</P>
<P>     The plot for DOUG'S 1st MOVIE returns to some recurring threads from
the "Doug" show which originated on Nickelodeon before moving to ABC
Saturday mornings.  Doug (voiced by Thomas McHugh), a 12-year-old student
at Bluffington Middle School, is still trying to catch the eye of Patti
Mayonnaise (Constance Shulman), the long-time object of his affection;
Doug's best friend Skeeter (Fred Newman) is still seeking the monster of
Lucky Duck Lake.  In the film, however, Skeeter actually finds the
creature, a friendly amphibious beast he dubs Herman Melville (Frank
Welker).  Herman is also proof that local big-wig Mr. Bluff (Doug Preis)
is polluting the lake, which presents Doug with a moral dilemma.  Should
he risk derision by helping Herman and taking on Mr. Bluff, or focus on
staying in Patti's good graces?</P>
<P>     In fact, it's not really much of a dilemma at all.  Doug is the
nicest of nice guys, an easy guy for his peers to relate to.  He has
superhero fantasies, he mopes when Patti spends time with cocky 
upperclassman Guy Graham (Guy Hadley), and he trusts his faithful dog
Porkchop.  Like most adolescents, he's a little insecure, but he always
tries hard to do the right thing.  That's the basic, simple appeal of
DOUG'S 1st MOVIE:  it's a message movie for kids in which the message is
"be decent," and where the message isn't obscured by special effects or
infantilism.  Sure, it moves at a fairly pokey cartoon pace, but that's a
welcome respite from animated films that behave as though kids will only
sit still for frantic action.</P>
<P>     Parents may even be sitting still for some of the funny asides in
DOUG'S 1st MOVIE.  Though Ken Scarborough's script is hardly heavy on
adult references, it does feel slightly smarter than most cartoon scripts.
I don't think a single line in the film would be over the head of a
12-year-old, yet somehow I still felt in on the joke despite the fact that
most of the humor centered on schoolkid types (the whiz-kid nerds, the
stuck-up rich girl, the minor-league bully and his cronies).  The best
point of comparison for DOUG'S 1st MOVIE is probably the "Peanuts"
television specials and features of the late 60s and 1970s -- they were
both sincere and engaging, and easy for families to share.  DOUG may not
stand "Peanuts'" test of time, but it's a solid choice for parents who
like the idea of a film that doesn't condescend to their kids.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 faithful Dougs:  7.</PRE>
