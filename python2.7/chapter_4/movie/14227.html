Knock Off (Reviewed Sept. 6/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Paul Sorvino </P>
<P>"Knock Off" is exactly that: a cheap knock off of an action movie.  It's
also the worst movie I have seen thus far this year.  I figured it would
be at least a couple of months before I saw the worst film of 1998, but
alas, it has already been found.</P>
<P>Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as (I think) a designer jeans executive who
discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods.  Rob
Schneider plays Van Damme's partner, and Rochon plays ... actually, I have
no idea who Rochon was supposed to be.  She just sort of popped up halfway
through without an explanation as to why she was there.  Many things are
not explained in this film, but I do know that for some bizarre reason,
Van Damme seemed to be doing a Jackie Chan impression throughout the
flick.  Where Chan comes off as endearing in his "normal guy" character
seen in many of his films, Van Damme just comes off as a wimp.  We're
never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions.
To be more clear:  I did not even know who he was supposed to be until
about an hour into the movie, and even then, it was not made too clear.</P>
<P>The film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment
gone horribly wrong.  Tsui Hark (who directed Van Damme's last movie, the
bad, but not nearly as bad as this, "Double Team") never lets the camera
rest for a second, and that's no exaggeration.  We are even treated to a
five second shot from the point of view of Van Damme's foot entering a
shoe.  Fabulous!  Seriously, though, I have no problem with directors who
want to play around with film conventions, as long as they don't get
carried away.  For example, look at Sam Raimi.  "Army of Darkness", one of
his best movies, features some of the most inventive camera work I have
ever seen, but Raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of
story.  That's a concept that Tsui can't seem to grasp.  The special
effects and outrageous camera angles *rule* "Knock Off" to the point where
the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more.</P>
<P>Another problem with the film is that it looks cheap.  The film stock used
is of such low caliber that I thought I was watching one of those Chinese
films shown really late at night.  And for some inexplicable reason,
everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed.  Even the stars.  And even the
special effects, seemingly the only aspect of the film the director
actually cared about, are inconsistent.  For example, there is a scene in
which Van Damme drives a car out of a window.  The car slams into the
ground, and the left wheel is completely destroyed.  Seconds later, the
car drives off at full speed.  Hey, I have no problem suspending my
disbelief in an action movie, but a line must be drawn somewhere.</P>
<P>Finally, the acting.  Nobody gives a good performance in this film.  Van
Damme, an actor I usually like, is way off the mark playing "everyman". 
And Schneider, here to provide comic relief I assume, is totally unfunny
and over acts his way through every scene.  Even the usually solid Paul
Sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as... Once again, I have
no idea who he was supposed to be.</P>
<P>In case I haven't yet made it clear enough, "Knock Off" is the worst movie
of Van Damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade.  And
it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny.  It's too
inept to be funny.  There are no redeeming factors in "Knock Off" and I
seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that
somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased.</P>
<PRE>You have been warned.</PRE>
<PRE>no stars out of ****</PRE>
