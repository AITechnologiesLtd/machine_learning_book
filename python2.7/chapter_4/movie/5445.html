<PRE>                                MOLL FLANDERS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Potential taglines for this movie...  MOLL FLANDERS:  *Less* than just
a bad title.  MOLL FLANDERS:  *Not* a shopping center in Belgium.  MOLL
FLANDERS:  Total waste of time.</P>
<P>     The last one is the most appropriate for this:  a picture which wastes
a lot of raw acting talent and pretty photography on a boring,
groaning-in-your-seat story which hinges on every clich in the book.</P>
<P>     MOLL FLANDERS is the most recent entry in the disturbing trend of
pictures made out of "classic" novels (in this case, Daniel Defoe's).
Regular readers pretty much know my opinion of how well this has been done
lately, but I'll say it again:  these movies haven't been too good.</P>
<P>     Robin Wright plays the titular character, a tempestuous woman born to
a death row-incarcerated mother in 18th century London.  She goes through
the ringer during the next two hours, going from nun to maid to whore to
respectable artist's wife to a voyage for the New World... none of which is
very interesting.  Along the way, she is befriended by Hibble (Morgan
Freeman, a character wholly invented for the film), a servant to the wicked
Lady Blystone (Stockard Channing), mistress of the bordello where Moll
plies her whoredom, and the two become friends.</P>
<P>     The story is told in flashback -- with Hibble finding Moll's long-lost
daughter, Flora (Aisling Corcoran), and telling her the story of her
mother.  As it turns out, Flora is a truly snotty little kid, and we
quickly find out that her mother is a snotty big kid.  Neither one carries
too much appeal as someone for us to look up to, and I was hoping against
hope that every time Flora would try to run away from Hibble, she'd escape.
She didn't.</P>
<P>     The big problem in MOLL FLANDERS, as mentioned earlier, is its very
poor and outdated story line.  Maybe the line "I'd had sex many times but
never made love" was new 150 years ago... but not any more.  Literally
*every* scene is predictable.  *Seriously.*  We've seen this all before in
a hundred movies -- mostly the kind that play on cable, late-nights.  Yawn.</P>
<P>     Even worse:  the humor in the film plays to the lowest common
denominator, alternating between sex jokes and genitalia jokes.  Not
exactly for the highbrow.  And there are lots of scenes with Moll acting
drunk, inexplicably insane, or both.  That's acting?  If I wanted to see
that, I could go back to college.</P>
<P>     The two saving graces:  very lovely cinematography and a clever
ending.  Enough?  Hardly.</P>
<P>     Hopefully I've made my point.  And judging from the audience's
reaction, I wasn't the only one with this opinion.  Best comment I heard
after the film:  "It was better than SPY HARD."  I couldn't agree more.</P>
