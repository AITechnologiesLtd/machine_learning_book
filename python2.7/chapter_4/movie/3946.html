<PRE>                               MORTAL KOMBAT
                       A film review by Thomas Mix
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Mix</PRE>
<PRE>MIXER SCALE(1-10) 5</PRE>
<P>     The one thing this movie had going for it was the intense fight
scenes.  The plot needed a major overhall as it left people hanging as
to what the hell all the fighting was about.  In any case the special
effects were enlightening.  No wonder comming from the prducers of
TERMINATOR 2 and TRUE LIES, both special-effect-dependendent films.</P>
