<PRE>BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Raja Gosnell</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Darryl Quarles</PRE>
<P>Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) is an FBI agent who takes his work a 
little too seriously. He will dress in any disguise, no matter how 
ridiculous or embarassing to catch a culprit. His latest assignment 
involves both he and his partner, John (Paul Giamatti), going down south 
to stake out the home of massive elderly woman Big Momma (Ella 
Mitchell). They're trying to catch Big Momma's grand-daughter, Sherry 
(Nia Long), who they think was involved in a bank robbery several years 
ago. Sherry worked at a bank which her boyfriend robbed, and the money 
was never recovered. Unfortunately Big Momma has been called away to see 
a sick friend, and she won't be home when Sherry arrives. Seeing his 
chance to catch Sherry slipping away, Malcolm decides to try his most 
embarassing disguise yet, playing Big Momma. This involves him dealing 
with such tasks as acting as the neighborhood midwife; dealing with a 
sadistic karate instructor (Anthony Anderson); trying to live up to the 
expectations of Sherry's son, Trent (Jascha Washington); and fending off 
the very unwelcome advances of an admiring suitor (Carl Wright).</P>
<P>I often hear Martin Lawrence called a poor man's Eddie Murphy. I've 
never agreed with this because the two actors have very different acting 
styles. Murphy is a bit more quiet and a lot more vulgar. Lawrence is 
often hilariously over the top, and he is great at playing a fish out of 
water type character; but he's obviously not as good an actor as Murphy. 
What Lawrence lacks in serious acting talent he usually makes up for in 
energy ("Blue Streak", "Nothing to Lose") or originality ("Life"). Such 
is not the case with his latest outing, "Big Momma's House", which 
destroys the validity of my arguments for Lawrence having a style of his 
own. This movie is nothing more than a blatant rip off of Murphy's 
similar role in "The Nutty Professor". However, all the pent up energy 
that usually makes Lawrence so entertaining is strangely absent. 
Instead, we get Lawrence looking very bored under a ton of makeup, using 
a scratchy, high-pitched voice that somehow sounds worse than 
fingernails on a chalk board. The saddest part of all this is that 
despite the tons of makeup they have piled on poor Martin, I could never 
believe he was an elderly, overweight woman.</P>
<P>In a movie where the star appears bored with the proceedings, it's left 
to the supporting cast to hold the show up. Thankfully the supporting 
actors in "Big Momma's House" do a fairly good job. Nia Long ("Held 
Up"), in particular, does an admirable job as the only straight 
character in a movie filled with bizarre types. Paul Giammati ("The 
Negotiator"), who usually plays a little weenie of a character, actually 
plays a fairly competent one here; even more shocking is that he does it 
pretty well. The most entertaining character would have to be Anthony 
Anderson's ("Romeo Must Die") hilariously incompetent security guard. 
Anderson was one of the best things about Jet Li's "Romeo Must Die", and 
if he keeps playing his characters like he does here, he'll have quite a 
comic future ahead of him. The funniest scene with Anderson involves his 
teaching a karate class to a group of old ladies and being taught a 
thing or two himself by Malcolm, as Big Momma. Unfortunately, comical 
scenes like this one are few and far between. The funniest scenes are 
Nia's initial meeting with Malcolm as Big Momma, Malcolm trying to help 
deliver a baby, and one where Nia goes to sleep in Big Momma's bed.</P>
<P>One of the worst things about "Big Momma's House" is its use of 
gross-out jokes. There is one scene (and you'll know it when you get 
there) that almost had me running out of the theater, ready to lose my 
lunch. Of course, I've never been a big fan of gross out gags like some 
people are. If you find the sight of something utterly repugnant to be 
amusing for some reason, maybe you'll enjoy the film for that reason. 
Another major fault with Darryl Quarles' script is that several things 
are never explained. For example, when Nia first shows up at her 
grandmother's house, she's convinced that Big Momma is going to be angry 
at her and they haven't spoken in some time, but we never find out why. 
Nia also carries around a cross which seems to hold some signifigance to 
both her and her grandmother, but this significance is never explained. 
The romantic subplot between Malcolm (when he's out of his Big Momma 
garb) and Nia feels about as rushed and tacked on as is humanly 
possible. Last, we have the grating soundtrack. If you don't know what 
kind of music is in a Martin Lawrence movie, you've been living in a 
cave for the past couple of years. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this 
movie to Martin Lawrence fans, because they might lose what little 
respect they have for him after seeing it (I know I did). "Big Momma's 
House" runs a decent 98 minutes, though most of this run time is 
pointless fluff. I give it three out of five stars.</P>
