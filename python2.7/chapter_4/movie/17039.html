                               THE WATERBOY
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow

<PRE>     "Now that's what I call high-quality H20."
            -Billy Boucher (Adam Sandler), "The Waterboy"</PRE>
<P>        Call him juvenile, call him sophomoric, call him annoying,
but don't call him poor.  Adam Sandler, the most recent "Saturday
Night Live" alumnus to graduate to the big screen, has made a
career out of playing eccentric, offbeat characters that terrify
critics while simultaneously endearing themselves to the masses.
(Witness "Airheads," "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore.")
Appealing primarily to teenage boys, Sandler's movies perform
respectably at the box office, even as confused adults scratch
their heads in bewilderment.  But 1998's "The Wedding Singer,"
co-starring Drew Barrymore, broke with convention and allowed
Sandler the chance to experiment with a more low-key acting
style.  The result was arguably his best film to date, and the
new, more "mature" actor seemed poised on the brink of bigger
and better things.</P>
<P>        "The Waterboy," alas, is a step backwards.  Full of
cheap humor, stereotypes, and jokes that misfire as often as
not, the film drags us through a story which contains not an
ounce of freshness or originality.  One set-up leads to another
so predictably that the only thing that surprises us is the fact
that director Frank Coraci thought he could get away with it.</P>
<P>        Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a 31 year-old Louisiana
simpleton whose only passion is serving as waterboy for his
local college football team.  After the despicable Coach
Beaulieu (Jerry Reed) fires him, our lowly hero accepts a
similar position with a rival team, headed up by the eccentric
but friendly Coach Klein (Henry Winkler, in a performance
that's definitely the movie's bright spot).  Although Bobby
lives for the team, they despise him and his feeble mind.  Even
though he's kind and friendly to them, they call him names and
subject him to cruel pranks.</P>
<P>        But when the shy, introspective waterboy is finally pushed
to his breaking point, he reveals a side no one previously suspected:
sheer animal rage.  Noting this, Coach Klein devises a plan to end
the team's losing streak.  Giving him a defensive position on the
team, Klein instructs the confused Bobby to pretend that their
opponents are people who have personally insulted him.  With this
mental trick, Bobby becomes an unstoppable tackling machine.</P>
<P>        From this point on, things progress exactly the way we
expect them to.  The team gradually gets better.  The people who
hated Bobby at the outset of the story will eventually come to
respect him.  Everything will culminate in a big game, which Bobby
will have a chance to single-handedly win or lose.  And naturally,
our hero will fall in love.</P>
<P>        The gal in question is Vicky, a tomboy played by Fairuza
Balk (the spooky gal from "The Craft").  Her character serves no
purpose whatsoever other than to provide the requisite sexual
titillation and "falling in love" scenes (once again proving the
BArlow Theorem of Cinematic Amour (B.A.T.C.A.), which states:
"A movie's main character is never in a happy relationship at the
outset of the story").  Balk is a fine young actress, but I wish
she'd actually had a reason to appear in this film.</P>
<P>        Other facets of the movie are also disappointing, not the
least of which is the silly voice Sandler uses throughout the
tale.  A high-pitched, mumbly, lip-smacking Louisiana drawl, it
starts out moderately amusing, but begins to grate on one's ears
after... oh, three minutes or so.  Sandler uses the exact same
voice for a character called The Southerner in some of the
stand-up routines on his comedy CD, "What the Hell Happened to
Me?".  It's funnier on the album, possibly because the skits
last no longer than two minutes each.  After twenty minutes of
hearing him speak in "The Waterboy," I wanted to crawl under
my chair.</P>
<P>        Henry Winkler, on the other hand, is tremendous from start
to finish.  His performance as Coach Klein is eccentric, goofy, and
impossible not to like.  I admired the way Winkler threw self-
consciousness to the wind, going all-out for a role that certainly
didn't deserve his considerable talents.  But Kathy Bates is more or
less wasted as the fretful mother who wants to make sure her Bobby
isn't playing "da fooz-ball."  She's a walking stereotype, included
only for cheap comic effect.  This is the same actress who won an
Oscar for "Misery?"</P>
<P>        Is "The Waterboy" funny?  Yeah, at times... like when Bobby
tells his mother that his black eye was caused by a rampaging gorilla,
to disguise the fact that he's playing football.  Other scenes, such
as those involving the mule that the Bouchers keep in their house (as
though it were a cat), border on the surreal and are equally
entertaining.  But most of the other gags are standard physical comedy
fare (including a shot of the former Fonz's uncovered bottom, which I
quite honestly could've done without).  The movie's not exactly
overflowing with intellect, but it does have spirit, and is neither
the best or worst of Sandler's offerings.</P>
