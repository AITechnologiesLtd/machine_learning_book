<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A fine production about the fall of Norway during Germany's invasion in
1940. It tells the historical tale of Norway's quick capitulation to the
Nazi forces. It questions the military leader's decision not to even
fire a shot, though outmanned and sure to be defeated, but offering no
resistance or support to their countrymen. That seemed hard to believe,
considering they had an armed force of some three thousand. It is seen
through the eyes of a senior citizen in his sixties, Thor Espedal (Espen
Skjonberg), who just retired from the Merchant Marines. He is spurred on
to action by the death of his friend at the hands of the Nazis and his
patriotism, as he astonishes his wife Anna (Rut) and the younger
soldiers by his enlistment. The result is a straightforward,
old-fashioned drama that shows his mettle and crustiness, in a film
noted solely for his sterling performance.</P>
<P>The film ably depicts the peaceful nature of the Norwegian people and
how they found war to be a very difficult position for them to be in,
and how confused everyone was at the time, as there was a lack of
leadership from the top.</P>
<P>Thor makes love to his wife and then goes to Army HQ. There is mass
confusion and no strong leadership present there. But that doesn't stop
the men from laughing at Thor, who is dressed in his outdated uniform
and is so much older than anyone else at headquarters.</P>
<P>He wins the soldiers over when he detonates a bridge and stays on to
fight a Resistance campaign in the hills with a cowardly captain
(Larssen), who decides to leave when the commanding general surrenders
to the Germans. Thor takes over command, putting together a purely
volunteer amateur army. He is joined by a socialist, Krogh (Sund-quist),
who in civilian life is an engineer. Krogh has recently returned from
Spain, where he fought the fascists in the Civil War, and has lost his
citizenship because of that.</P>
<P>The only battle scene that is emphasized, is when the Resistance
fighters ambush a German patrol and capture 150 Germans. But after that
victory, reality sets in and the men are fearful that the Germans will
send in a brigade and destroy them. Thor gives the volunteers a choice
of going home or fighting. The volunteers have lost their taste for
battle, so they scatter and return to their homes. Thor remains alone,
waiting for the Germans to come. The scene was carefully done, showing
the unsaid fear that swept over their camp when the men realized they
might become martyrs if they stayed.</P>
<P>The Last Lieutenant doesn't have anything new to say, but what it says
about one's loyalty to country and how its military leaders were faced
with difficult decisions, was deftly handled by first-time director Hans
Petter Moland. It is a film for those who want to see a different
approach to war films, one where the study of character is more
important than the battle scenes and the arguments of ideology. The film
told a decent story. It's only problem was, that it just wasn't that
exciting a picture.</P>
