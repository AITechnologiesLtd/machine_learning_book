                               STEEL MAGNOLIAS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Six women go through folly, friendship,
     and tragedy together.  If the basic formula is familiar, at
     least the writing by Robert Harling--based on his own stage
     play--is usually crisp and often genuinely funny.  Rating:
     low +2.</P>
<P>     STEEL MAGNOLIAS is about as formulaic a "women's film" as any film I
can imagine.  You have a set of two or more women whom you get to know very
well through relatively mundane circumstances.  You get a feel for what they
do in life's more ordinary moments.  The tragedy (usually medical) strikes
and having known them already you feel for their tragedy.  Suddenly any old
antagonisms seem small.  But they are stronger for having known each other
and the remainder of their numbers will abide and endure.  That's BEACHES,
that's TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, that's lots of other films, and that's STEEL
MAGNOLIAS.  All that makes one of these films good or bad is whether the
viewer is really brought into the characters during the normal, mundane part
and is that part enjoyable.  In STEEL MAGNOLIAS the mundane part is quite
good.  As it so often is, it's not silly or cute or whimsical.  It is
genuinely funny.  And as such it leaves most of the other films of its
formula behind.</P>
<P>     STEEL MAGNOLIAS is the story of six women from a small town in
Louisiana.  The women are played by Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly
Parton, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, and Julia Roberts.  Much of the story
takes place in a beauty parlor--as did all of the play the film was based
on.  But the film greatly benefits from the opportunity to get out of the
beauty parlor and see the world. There are really three pairs of women: a
mother and daughter, the beauty parlor owner and her assistant, and two
older women who are often at odds with each other.</P>
<P>     As is almost the requirement for this sort of film, there is a soft and
sentimental film score by George Delerue.  Nobody plays these soft and
sensitive strings like Delerue.  Also reasonably good, but obviously of
secondary interest, are the men, played by Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, and a
few others.  Also this film boasts (?) a view of the most revolting cake
ever baked.</P>
<P>     STEEL MAGNOLIAS obviously has a good cast and is diverting and
enjoyable.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
