<PRE>                          THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder,
Antonio Banderas.
Screenplay/Director:  Bille August.</P>
<P>     Early in THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, the narrative voice of Winona
Ryder describes her mother's reason for keeping extensive diaries:
"Everything happens so fast that we don't have time to understand
events."  And that just about covers most of what is wrong with this
adaptation of Isabel Allende's novel.  There are plenty of other things
wrong--inappropriate tone, dreadful miscasting, laughable acting--but
the fundamental failing of THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is a screenplay
which races from scenario to scenario without any apparent concern for
the establishment of character.  When this two hour-plus "epic"
concluded, I felt nothing for the characters and embarrassment for the
cast.</P>
<P>     THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS spans forty-five years in the life of
Esteban Trueba (Jeremy Irons), an ambitious man in an unnamed South
American country.  Esteban soon becomes a wealthy landowner, and
eventually decides to marry Clara (Meryl Streep), the sister of his
former fiancee and a woman with supernatural gifts.  Also coming to the
Trueba home is Esteban's spinster sister Ferula (Glenn Close), who is
strangely fascinated by Clara.  Esteban and Clara have a daughter,
Blanca, who as a young woman (Winona Ryder) falls in love with poor
laborer Pedro (Antonio Banderas).  Pedro becomes a leader of the
socialist wave sweeping the country, and Esteban forbids their
romance.  As the country is torn apart by civil strife, so are the
Truebas torn apart in many different ways.</P>
<P>     It is difficult to comprehend how Bille August thought he could
accomplish everything it seems he wanted to accomplish in only 140
minutes.  In fact, after only twenty minutes I could tell that THE
HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS should have been a miniseries, and should have
been directed by someone else.  There is no texture, no depth and no
life to any of these characters; August directs as though he is
interested only in getting in, doing a scene, and getting out.  As just
one example, the scene in which Clara asks Ferula to come live with her
and Esteban should have been packed with emotion, as a woman who has
lived her whole life doing for others has kindness shown to her,
perhaps for the first time.  But Close has just a few minutes of screen
time before this scene, giving Ferula no chance to develop that
history.  Later, Blanca and Pedro meet after Blanca returns from
boarding school, a meeting we are told has taken place over several
summers.  The problem is that this scene is the first time Ryder and
Banderas are on screen together, making her profession of love ring
totally false.  Everything is too densely compressed and without
resonance, and THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS blasts through six decades
without leaving any emotion in its wake.</P>
<P>     With such a basic flaw at the core of the film, all other
criticism seems like nit-picking.  However, it is difficult not to note
that THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS could have been much better with a cast
that seemed at all comfortable in these roles.  The primary culprit is
Jeremy Irons, whose performance here is, quite simply, appalling.
Esteban is the pivotal character in this story, but Irons gives no
subtlety to his systematic alienation of his family.  In his defense,
he does have to deliver his lines through an obviously annoying set of
false teeth, but he still mugs his way shamelessly through scenes which
required an understanding of traditional Latino conceptions of
masculinity which he clearly did not have.  Winona Ryder continues to
act out of her depth, although she has some good scenes in the final
half hour when the political drama takes center stage.  Close has a
thankless, twitchy role, and Streep merely looks radiant without having
any real presence.  Only Banderas and Joaquin Martinez, as Esteban's
bastard son, show any spark.  How curious ... that two Hispanic actors
should seem to grasp this material.  It sort of makes you wonder what
might have been.</P>
<P>     Miramax must have looked at the pedigree on this film and thought
it had a purebred winner on its hands.  Instead they got a hyperactive
shaggy dog.  I hope someday someone films THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS as a
miniseries.  In Spanish.  The material deserves a second chance.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 spirits:  3.</PRE>
