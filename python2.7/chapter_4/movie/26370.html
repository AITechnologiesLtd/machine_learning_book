<P>'Ghost Dog' is a strange-looking movie with a unique atmosphere. It's
built of offbeat rhythms, outlandish jokes and a strange sensibility
in which cultures and subcultures of Japan, Sicily, Port-au-Prince and
the Wu Tang Clan seem perfectly harmonious. The experience is deeply
hypnotic and almost haunting.</P>
<P>In director Jim Jarmusch latest picture the main character is a
reclusive and mysterious inner-city hit man who lives and breathes by
the code of ancient Japanese warriors, and moves with so much
conviction that he barely needs to speak. Alone on the rooftop he
calls home, silhouetted against a smoky sky and the ragged chimneys
and TV antennas of neighboring buildings, Ghost Dog lives with the
pigeons and his books. His life is simple, harsh and bizarre. When he
is not on a mission, he writes his poetry with his sword. His only
friend is the ice cream-man in the park. Though the ice cream man
doesn't know English and Ghost Dog doesn't understand French, they
seem happy with their relationship. Ghost Dog has the heart of a
warrior, but he moves on little cat feet. As every samurai, Ghost Dog
has a master in the form of a mafia chieftain. They communicate with
the help of a carrier pigeon that lives on Ghost Dog's roof.</P>
<P>The film is divided into multiple chapters, where quotes from
"Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai", which is basically Ghost Dog's
bible, are projecting the events unfolding before our eyes, explaining
at times Ghost Dog's behavior and state of mind. Animated parables of
sex, envy, power and violence comment on the film's action as
well. Jarmusch moves dreamy and unhurried, slowly capturing the
audience in his world. At times it feels like no body is directing at
all, that the movie kind of lives on its own. But there are times when
you feel a powerful force behind the images. The clever parallels
between dream and reality and time and space. The comparisons,
philosophy and human emotions -- everything is implanted in a
strangely complex picture. It's an action movie for maverick
intellectuals, a noir thriller with a prankish streak, a genre film
that knows and mostly obeys the rules but keeps cramming in odd
insights, goofy jokes, offbeat allusions to cinema and literature. An
exploration of the mind and deeds of a man who moves mysteriously and
yet purposefully through a life filled with danger. There is also a
strange connection and complete understanding of the main character,
who is lost in dreams, space and time. He has simply lost all touch
with reality. There is a strange surrealism in Jarmusch's picture,
where parallel worlds virtually float into each other, co-existing
simultaneously. Ghost Dog's alienation from human society, his
loneliness, his attempt to justify inhuman behavior (murder) with a
belief system (the samurai code) has no connection with his life or
his world. The act of vengeance, a dream to return to the ancient
traditions - the purity of mind and soul and the nearest you can get
in our modern world is murder.</P>
<P>Ghost Dog appears in virtually every scene, yet he doesn't speak for
almost an hour and when he does, it is only in short, concrete
sentences. Yet, his presence is felt tremendously throughout the whole
movie. Every minute he's on screen, Whitaker makes "Ghost Dog" worth
watching. He basically carries the film on his shoulders, making the
diffirence between success and failure. There are moments where his
eyes and body language say more than any words ever could. It's
nothing less than an awesomely grave and sensitive performance.</P>
<P>"Ghost Dog" might feel too close to a genre film, but it resembles no
other mob story or action-revenge picture ever made.  It splices
together 18th century Japanese teachings, martial arts, mob
iconography, the military primer, The Art of War, hip-hop, mythology
and pop entertainment. There's the contrasty cinematography of Robby
Muller, for one, the pulsing score by the RZA, for another. And there
are those little Jarmusch touches -- the empty black spaces between
some of the scenes, for instance -- which give the film an utterly
unique sensibility. But there are times when the director's unhurried
style and slow pacing seem tiring, close to dull, which certainly is a
not very good element. In such moments Whitaker's presence helps a lot
and saves Jarmusch from a close flop. In the end you'll sit amazed and
a little confused by what you have seen. It's certainly not an action
film that will rock the box office. It won't make any headlines until
many years later, when many will wake up, remember embrace the
original and misunderstood director Jim Jarmusch.</P>
