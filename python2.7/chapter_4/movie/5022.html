<P>      Flying rhinos, enchanted crocodile tongues, and one very large
piece of fruit.  It's all business as usual for Roald Dahl, whose 1961
children's book has been brought to partially-animated life by director
Henry Selick (THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and producer Tim Burton
(same).  Book-ended by extended live-action segments, the pit of this
PEACH is a plum of a stop-motion story about a boy's adventure with
several human-sized insects.  (They are enlarged along with the peach.)
The animation is dazzling, the voices are well-cast, and the humor is
very droll.  (Says one bug of another, "he's committing pesticide!") Too
bad the story drags.  The ending is also a wash, and the songs, by Randy
Newman, sound like, well, songs by Randy Newman.  Of course, it's not
every day that we get to hear Richard Dreyfuss and Simon Callow
performing showtunes together!  (The former's musical range has
marginally improved since MR. HOLLAND'S ANUS.) Speaking of Freud, adults
should wholly enjoy the many darker aspects-- and psychological
possibilities-- of this story, even as they fidget, even as their kids
don't.</P>
