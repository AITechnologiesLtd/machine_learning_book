 </PRE>
<P>There should be a special place in purgatory for filmmakers who dig into a
wonderful subject and ruin it for everybody else by making a bad movie.  Maggie
Greenwald's Songcatcher ventures into the mountains of Appalachia at the turn of
the last century to mine the rich traditions of the folk music that had come
over with immigrants from the British Isles a couple of centuries before and had
survived, almost unchanged, to that time.  The music is good.  But the story,
the writing, and the direction are a travesty.  Songcatcher is artistic strip
mining, leaving the territory it plunders bare, forlorn, and unusable.</P>
<P>Greenwald has researched her subject and drawn on historical characters,
but the fictional characters and situations she has created don't suggest real
people in that place at that time.  Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) is a
musicologist at an Eastern college.  She's a feisty one, aggressive sexually and
ambitious professionally.  When she's rejected for tenure because of her gender,
it riles her up.</P>
<P>This happens in the first scene, and it's a revealing scene for its
self-conscious exposition.  She's been passed over in favor of a male
musicologist -- "Cyrus Whittle,' her department chairman announces smugly, `who,
as you know, has almost singlehandedly created the revival of the English folk
song."  Scene after scene will follow this lead – uneasy, unconvincing moments
between badly drawn characters assembled to advance a forced narrative and an
afterthought of a love story, all in the service of a set of late-20th century
perspectives on social issues.  </P>
<P>After her snub in academia, Dr. Penleric heads off to Appalachia to visit
her sister Elna (Jane Adams) who has started a mountain school with her friend
Harriet (E. Katherine Kerr).  When Lily discovers the two are lesbians, she's
disgusted, but she finds a welcome distraction in the treasure of old folk songs
that the mountain people sing.  She starts collecting the songs, on paper and on
wax cylinders, but she runs into opposition from a local named Tom (Aidan
Quinn), who suspects that she's out to exploit his people.  </P>
<P>How he comes to change his mind about her, how she gradually sheds her
uppity, pedantic airs, how the lesbian cat escapes the bag and triggers
melodrama, heartbreak, and destruction in paradise, are matters best left for
the movie to unfold.  Sequences like the one in which Lily runs in panic through
the nighttime woods and emerges into a field in broad daylight provide the
respite of puzzlement.  The music makes some of it bearable, but even the
musical scenes are not an unalloyed gift.  There are a few pure moments, such as
the great bluesman Taj Mahal being trotted out for one brief guitar riff and
then packed off again into the wings, but Aidan Quinn, fine actor though he is,
fails to convince either with his playing of the banjo or the guitar or the
character.  The orphan Deladis (Emmy Rossum) and the old granny Viney (Pat
Carroll) sing us a number of ballads, and do pretty well with the music, but the
acting is a burden.  McTeer is a former Oscar nominee, but here the odds are
stacked against her.</P>
<P>Any movie that can arouse compassion is worthy of notice, and this movie
does arouse compassion for the poor actors, exposed in scene after scene without
the decent covering of adequate dialogue or direction.</P>
