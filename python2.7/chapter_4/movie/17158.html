<P>_Cruel_Intentions_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Before she found widespread recognition as TV's vampire-slaying heroine
Buffy Summers, Sarah Michelle Gellar first made quite a different name for
herself on the ABC's _All_My_Children_.  In her two-and-a-half year,
1993-1995 stint on the daytime drama, the then-teenage Gellar made a
striking impression as Kendall Hart Lang, a conniving hellraiser in her
mid-20s.  Kendall did everything she could to make her mother's (Susan
Lucci's Erica Kane)--and just about everyone else's--life miserable: she
made numerous attempts to seduce her stepfather; bedded his son, then cried
rape at his father's hands; perjured herself on the witness stand and
served a jail sentence--and this was all in her _first_ year.  In the
process, Gellar earned two Emmy nominations, one Emmy win, and a legion of
loyal fans--including myself (though not Lucci, whose working relationship
with Gellar reportedly mirrored their characters').</P>
<P>_Cruel_Intentions_ marks Gellar's big return to the type of role us
original fans know and love the best--the no-holds-barred bitch--and the
act has only gotten better with age.  Now in her 20s herself (though now,
ironically, playing a teen), Gellar exudes a captivatingly carniverous
carnality as Kathryn Merteuil, a bored, insanely wealthy NY prep school
student for whom selfish psychosexual mindgames provide the ultimate
thrill.  The film is at its tawdry best during her erotically-charged
scenes with Ryan Phillippe, who stars as Sebastian Valmont, Kathryn's
stepbrother and comrade in sin.</P>
<P>If the characters' surnames sound familiar, they should--writer-director
Roger Kumble's film is a high-gloss, ultracontemporary, youth-infused
revamp of Choderlo de Laclos's 1782 novel _Les_Liasons_Dangereuses_, whose
most notable film adaptation was Stephen Frears's powerful 1988
_Dangerous_Liaisons_.  Despite the '90s setting and adolescent characters,
Kumble hews fairly close to his source material in telling the story of how
Merteuil and Valmont wager on whether or not he can bed a virtuous girl
(here, Reese Witherspoon's Annette Hargrove).  Of course, with the change
in time and age demographic come new wrinkles: while Sebastian's prize is
indeed an encounter with Kathryn, hers is his vintage Jaguar car; and
Annette initially catches the attention of Sebastian by writing a virginity
manifesto in an issue of none other than _Seventeen_ magazine.</P>
<P>The latter touch is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as is a lot of
_Cruel_Intentions_.  The film's first hour fits Sony's description of the
film as a "wicked comedy," offering some gleefully mean-spirited laughs as
Kathryn and Sebastian not only plot Annette's ruin, but that of the
innocent and naive (to put it mildly) Cecile (an effectively over-the-top
Selma Blair, Zoe of the sitcom _Zoe,_Duncan,_Jack_&_Jane_), whose boyfriend
rejected Kathryn.  Kumble gives Gellar some choice catty lines, and one
bold scene between her and Blair is bound to make viewers see the two WB
stars in a whole new light.</P>
<P>But Kumble ultimately remains faithful to his tragic source material, and
as the tale becomes more and more serious, the casting of the dramatically
limited Phillippe becomes increasingly problematic.  His natural woodenness
is an adequate fit for Sebastian's cold detachment, but when the script
inevitably has Sebastian fall for Annette, the pathetic Phillippe can't
follow.  No convincing expression, let alone emotion, registers on his
blank face, making Sebastian's purported change wholly unbelievable.  With
this latest colorless performance (following _Playing_by_Heart_ and the
disastrous _54_), former _One_Life_to_Live_ star Phillippe--unlike the
ever-impressive Gellar--reinforces the stereotype that actors with a soap
pedigree have no discernible acting talent.  On the other hand, Witherspoon
(Phillippe's real-life fiancee, as it is) holds up her end of the romance,
radiating purity, vulnerability, and a crucial underlying strength.  But
without an at least equally involving match, her efforts are for naught,
and the outcome of the story fails to make any profound impression.</P>
<P>Even if the dramatic pretensions of literary fidelity get the better of
him in the end, it is Kumble's sense of humor that makes _Cruel_Intentions_
a step above recent then-to-now translations such as
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_ and _Great_Expectations_.  While
those two films got bogged down with the self-importance of their "radical"
artistic ambitions, Kumble has the keen sense to not take himself too
seriously, making _Cruel_Intentions_ something that those films never
were--entertaining.</P>
