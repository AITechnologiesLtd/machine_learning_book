<PRE>                                   PRIEST
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is the film that is being bashed by the Catholic heirarchy
despite their not having seen it.  Boycott of advertisers, Miramax and
Disney have been declared.  For me, it was a fascinating film which I'd
like to recommend.</P>
<P>     Liverpool is one of the more difficult cities for the Church to
work in because of its impoverished parishes.  Father Ellerton (James
Ellis) has found it too much for him; Young Father Greg Pilkington
(Linus Roache) is sent to replace him.  Pilkington is a sincere,
devout, ethical Catholic.  Before long he is beset with problems he,
too, is unable to handle.</P>
<P>     For one thing, he is astonished and disturbed when he finds that
Father Matthew Thomas (Tom Wilkinson) has given up on his vows of
celibacy and is sharing the bed of his housekeeper, Maria (Cathy
Tyson).  In the confessional, where the priests are not permitted to
divulge what has been told to them by the "sinner," a fourteen-year-old
Lisa (Christine Tremarco) reveals she is being sexually abused by her
father.  How is Father Greg supposed do deal with that?</P>
<P>     Among the many other questions Father Greg must face is that of
homosexuality.</P>
<P>     PRIEST is a film about honesty and toleration of others' actions,
of compassion for those for whom desire outweighs the behavior the
Church would espouse.  Beautifully done.</P>
