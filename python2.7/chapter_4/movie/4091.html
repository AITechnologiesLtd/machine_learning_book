<P>     With apologies to author and talk-show host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger, a better title for this movie might be SEVEN WOMEN WHO DO
STUPID THINGS TO MESS UP THEIR LIVES.</P>
<P>     Winona Ryder stars as "Finn," a Berkeley grad student who is
spending the summer with her grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) and great aunt
(Anne Bancroft).  She's taking a break from her
boyfriend-turned-fiance, because she's scared, and because she finally
wants to finish her thesis.  Grandma's house is also the longtime home
of a quilting bee, made up of seven women who have all suffered from
the tragedies of love.  Or, at the very least, from the results of bad
decision-making.  They each have a story to tell and they do.  So much,
in fact, that poor Winona and her character's fear of commitment are
practically lost in the shuffle.</P>
<P>     As a naysayer`s portrait of marriage, this spring's MIAMI RHAPSODY
was much funnier.  Sarah Jessica Parker as a bubbly neurotic beats an
angst-ridden Winona any day of the week.  Part of the problem is the
actress; Ms. Ryder still looks like she's in high school and it's a
stretch to think of her thinking such serious thoughts.  (Which she
really doesn't.  The story allows virtually no examination of her
character's feelings about engagement or marriage.  Instead, the plot
provides a silly stud-boy for "Finn" to be distracted by.)</P>
<P>     HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT is a "chick flick" that many may
embrace wholeheartedly.  The story shoots for anecdotal appeal and, in
some ways, succeeds gracefully.  Who can fault the flawless chemistry
between Burstyn and Bancroft?  Or the relaxed pace that so well suits
the, uh, patchwork narrative?  Or the unusual supporting cast that
includes everyone from Rip Torn to Ester Rolle to legendary poet Maya
Angelou?  Go with the flow and you're fine.  (At least until the hokey
final reel, which starts with a stormy, weather-related metaphor,
continues with a character-by-character recap of each woman's story,
and finally ends with fair Winona-- wrapped the a quilt, no less!--
following a crow into an orange grove.  Hilarious!)</P>
<P>     Stand back to think about the movie's message and reasonable doubt
comes into play.  A woman who sleeps with her sister's husband.
Another wife who accepts her husband's philandering.  Another
wife-turned-widow who answers her grief with an affair.  And so on and
so on.  How can we view these characters as anything other than
failures?  When we turn to Winona, with an optimistic look toward youth
and the future, we find *her* character in the arms (and more!) of
another man, because she's too afraid to face her own feelings!
[Insert head shaking.]</P>
<P>     To the credit of all parties involved, HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN
QUILT is no less honest than Clint Eastwood's well-received BRIDGES OF
MADISON COUNTY.  Both are warm, well-acted features that return plenty
for anyone willing to just "go with flow."  And what more does a movie
ask, these days, than mere physical attendance?  Go with flow, Sheldon,
and you're fine.  Stop, look, and listen... and you may come away with
a different opinion.</P>
