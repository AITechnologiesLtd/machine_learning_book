<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This Irish crime charmer has 'the gift of gab.' It's a shaggy-dog type
of story, filled with colorful characters and the color of the Irish
countryside. The film should be valued for its amusing dialogue, despite
the difficulty to understand what is being said because of the thick
brogues.</P>
<P>Just out of prison for a petty crime he didn't do, the taciturn Git
Hynes (Peter McDonald) comes to the rescue of his friend Anto (Wilmot)
in a pub where he is visiting his former girlfriend. Anto is about to
have his fingers smashed by the henchmen of Dublin crime boss Tom French
(Doyle). Why Git comes to the rescue, since his girlfriend from
childhood Sabrina Bradley (Byrne) has left him while he was in prison
for Anton, is not clear. Maybe, he's just a good guy, or a bit naive, or
perhaps he is a bit short on smarts. But this rescue of his friend,
resulting in the severe beating by him of two of Tom's boys, cannot go
unpunished. He is asked by the crime boss to go to Cork and bring back
Frank Gorgon (Caffrey) with the money that he owes Tom. This brings him
together with a gangster in debt to Tom, the flamboyant ex-con Bunny
Kelly (Gleeson). Bunny's wife has left him, which is about the only
other thing he has in common with his much younger partner. The crime
boss explains that the two as partners can keep an eye on each other, so
this way they can blame the other if the job is a bollix.</P>
<P>Bunny is a first-class character and screw up, who pictures himself as a
know-it-all. When he pulls into the gas station he can't open the fuel
cap in the car he stole and gets peeved at Git for watching him, saying
he always gets nervous when someone is watching. Having a craving for
chocolates, he decides to stick-up the gas station.</P>
<P>In Cork, they rescue Frank from a gang that is holding him. This hostage
turns out to be quite a character himself. The boys don't know if what
he is telling them is true or not. Since they have no idea of what is
really going on they decide to do just as French wants and deliver him,
but Git insists that he will not let Frank get killed. But Frank insists
that he teach Git how to use a gun, just in case there's trouble. Of
course, he teaches him incorrectly how to use the gun, but that turns
out to be no big problem for the two lucky Irishmen.</P>
<P>It is mostly a road movie, showing what it's like to bring Frank back to
Dublin. There are a lot of sudden twists in the story that keep you
guessing as to what happens next. The three men try to get to know one
another, but any relationship with the blarney talking Frank is out of
the question. But Bunny and Git form a warm and surprising friendship,
as they are trying to figure out Tom French's plan. The violent
conclusion is done with style and adds to the comic mood the film set.
It is a rather cheerful film-- despite the violence, the lowlife
characters, and all the peat bogs the duo come across. It also has
something to say about being loyal as opposed to being greedy. Its
ethics are blurred by what society considers right and wrong, but by
going over that line of decency, the film gains most of its charm.</P>
