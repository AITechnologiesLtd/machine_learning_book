<P>FREQUENCY (2000) by JOHN SYLVA, associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)</P>
<PRE>Rating: C</PRE>
<P>It's a wonder of a concept, isn't it?  The thought of reaching back in time,
changing a certain something that in turn alters the course of your life
forever- Is it really possible?  Screenwriter of the new film "Frequency," Toby
Emmerich, would try to pass the idea off, but perhaps the concept would be a
good one for him, which would allow the first time scribe to reach back in time
and fix all of the plot holes and mistakes his script bares.  "Frequency" has
its ups and downs, but when it's all over, there's nothing that the film holds
effective or memorable enough to have any lasting effect on the viewer.</P>
<P>John Sullivan is a modern man with a modern life, living in the year 1999.  He
is a dedicated police officer, with a great deal amount of affection for his
single mother, as his father Frank died in 1969.  Everything about John's life
is modern.   Frank Sullivan is a man in the past, living in the year 1969.  He
is a dedicated firefighter, with a great deal amount of affection for his son,
John, and his wife.  Everything in Frank's life is just an element of the past.
 How could it be, that parallel universes on Earth are in existence
simultaneously?   </P>
<P>"Frequency" tells the complicated story of the son, John Sullivan (James
Caviezel), who will communicate with his father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid),
over his dad's old ham radio- Who's been dead for thirty years.  The two unite
(reunite for John) over the radio like friends would at school after their
summer vacation, very un-father/son like, and then play catch up, as Frank has
no knowledge that his future has death in store, and John is still shocked that
there's a â€˜lil John living thirty years before him.  After the two are pretty
much on the same page, "Frequency" becomes more of a thriller, as Frank has now
overcome what would have been his death, resulting in everything in the future
being different- Including the fact that John's mom lost her life long ago to a
serial killer.</P>
<P>Quaid and Caviezel are major letdowns in their starring roles, as neither one
ever convinces the viewer that they're witnessing an occurrence of the
supernatural.  They rehearse the already dull dialogue without caring, and
handle scenes of intense drama with mellow mediocrity.  </P>
<P>The screenplay isn't written convincingly or focused enough for the idea of the
parallel worlds existing to be believable, which is a major chip on this film's
shoulder, as in order for us to believe "Frequency," we must suspend our
beliefs about the laws of physics, the element of space and time, and the
ability and capacity of the human memory.  Emmerich's script is full of too
many holes to pass anything off in the film as realistic.  Time is certainly on
the character's sides in the film, and it would have been to Emmerich as well
if he had polished his work before having it produced into this mess of a
feature film.  </P>
<P>Gregory Hoblit's follow up to the eerily intense "Fallen" is mostly a letdown,
as "Frequency" doesn't seem to build strong enough roots before delving into
the numerous subplots that it has.  The film seems to be trying to make a film
as magical as quite possibly the best fantasy film ever made, "Field of
Dreams," but never even thinks about making a film that plants its own roots.
"Frequency" is a perfect example of when too much is too little, as constant
twist after turn is taken, which is usually something I look for in a film, but
the catch is: The screenplay isn't written well enough for us to really care.</P>
<P>Although "Frequency" is a film of numerous problems, it certainly has its
undeniably touching and exciting moments, but the sloppy screenplay and acting
make for a film that is nothing extraordinary. For a good portion of the film,
you're feeling positive about the general environment and story, but as the
film progresses, the intriguing setup transforms into an aimless, shallow film
possessing a "Sixth Sense"-ish ending that may encourage one to stand up and
cheer for a moment, but then after the credits roll, you're left with the
burning question, "That's it?"  Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for
sentimental, crowd pleaser endings- Just not when a film is as unsatisfying,
incomplete, and average as "Frequency" is.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line: "Frequency" is a film of mystery, suspicion, murder, love,
reunion, and family...Somewhere, among it all, the effect vanishes into thin
air.</P>
