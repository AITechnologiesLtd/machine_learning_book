   If you're a lover of theater, you might imagine Jean Genet,
Bert Brecht, and Peter Brook meeting by a lovely lakeside
somewhere in Quebec to fashion a new work of art.  Genet,
of course, insists on gender-bending, role-playing, and racial
mixtures.  Brecht want to distance the audience by having the
actors announce each scene before playing it out.  And
Brook, well, he insists that there must be a least some
mayhem and cruelty, though he realizes it will never equal
that of "Marat/Sade."  What emerges is "Lilies," a film that can
hardly be a model of job-creation for women in the movie
industry, one which underscores homosexuality, theatricality,
religious hypocrisy; utilizing vivid imagery, some deliberately
laughable acting at spots, and stark contrasts.
   "Lilies," based on the play with the same name by Michel
Marc Bouchard--who adapted his staged drama for the wide
screen--has already garnered heaps of awards at such events
as the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the
San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, and
has won four Genie Awards, which are the equivalent in
Canada of the U.S. Oscar for best motion picture.  As vivid a
dramatization as it is, "Lilies" is also a mess, one which may
have you unduly pondering the unfolding plot, a storyline
which is tied together only at the very conclusion.  You may
leave the movie house wondering just how important the gay
theme is--even though the characters' homosexuality is of
paramount consideration--since one could imagine the story
played out by heterosexual characters as well albeit without
some of the edge which all-male casting affords.
   Filmed in Montreal which stands in for the town of Roberval
in Northern Quebec, the movie shifts easily from 1952 to
1912, from the somber gray ambiance of a grim, well-guarded
prison to a romantic setting of the kind that film-makers fondly
position with gauzy lensing.  When a Catholic bishop (Marcel
Sabourin) visits the prison allegedly to hear a dying man's
confession, he is locked into the confessional booth by the
chaplain (Ian D. Clark) who invited him.  Just opposite him in
the prison-within-a-prison is not a dying man but a prisoner
who was forty years earlier his friend, Simon (Aubert
Pallascio).  The startled bishop has essentially been given a
free, front-row seat to witness a play put on by prisoners
which recreates some seminal events which occurred in the
year 1912.  
  Moving back and forth in time, from 1952 to 1912, director
John Greyson shows the bishop watching in mixed terror and
sadness a tragedy which befell his young friend Simon (Jason
Cadieux) in the early part of the century.  Simon and Vallier
(Danny Gilmore) are homosexuals who are involved with each
other, until Simon decides "it's time to become interested in
girls." Completing the male triangle is the bishop as a young
man, Bilodeau (Matthew Ferguson), who is consumed with
jealousy at the attraction of his two friends.  When Vallier's
mother, the Countess de Tilly (Brent Carver) encourages the
relationship, a series of dire events transpires, leading
ultimately to Simon's engagement to a woman, Lydie-Anne
(who is played by a man, Alexander Chapman).
   Plays often do not translate well to the screen, but one
could scarcely imagine a more stylized production of the
staged work, known in French as Les Feluettes, than the one
we witness on the big screen.  The film has considerable
metaphoric weight, not the least being its very title, "Lilies,"
which means everything from the lilies of the field (a Biblical
reference) to the fleur de lys (symbolizing the royal Countess
who is Valliere's mother), to sexual imagery.  "Lilies" could
have been a smashing production given its boldly imaginative
romp, but its characters are strangely off-putting.  In fact it
would be difficult to sympathize or empathize with any of
them, perhaps because the gender-bending is all too
unsubtle. The 18-year-old Simon (Jason Cadieux) could pass
for a young Peter Gallagher, representing perhaps the Brad
Pitt of 1912 French Canada, his presence obviously stirring
the envy and longings of the cast hub.  In their relatively small
roles, Marcel Sabourin as the bishop and Aubert Pallascio as
the older Simon who is serving a term for murder perform
their parts professionally.  The remainder of the cast look just
plain silly a good part of the time and should cause audience
laughter at inopportune times. Rated R.  Running Time: 95
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
