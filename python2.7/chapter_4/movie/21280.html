<P>Nightwatch is finally coming out.  This film has been scheduled for
release more often than I masturbate.  It's never a good thing when a
studio continuously delays an opening, but they had a good reason to
with this one.  The procrastination was presumably due to last minute
attempts to somehow edit Ewan's cock into the picture.  He loves to
display his meats.  That's just my theory, but until somebody comes up
with another one, we'll just stick with mine.</P>
<P>A remake of Bordenal's allegedly superior Portuguese film (called
Nattevagten), Nightwatch follows the poor employment choice of law
student Martin (Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting).  Martin takes what he
thinks will be an easy gig - as a night watchman at the city morgue.
Even Catherine and James (Patricia Arquette and Josh Brolin, Flirting
with Disaster), his whiny girlfriend and whack-job best friend, can't
persuade Martin that it is way too creepy while Martin is convinced that
it will be easier to get his studying done in the ultra-quiet confines
on his new employer.</P>
<P>On his first day, Martin is given a quick, but funny, walk through of
his job responsibilities, courtesy of the crusty old guy who previously
held the position.  Now, I don't know how a real morgue works, but there
are apparently the magical keys spread all about the morgue.  In an
attempt to prove that he's actually patrolling the place, the watchman
has to take this lock-box thing around to the keys in a bizarre hourly
Easter egg-like hunt.  Of course, one of these keys is in the room where
they keep the bodies.  When Martin is told to be careful because the
door doesn't open from the inside, you can only imagine what will happen
on the last reel.  The cadaver room also has these creepy white
pull-cords that hang down from the ceiling, which are evidently used in
case someone mistakenly brings a living person in.  Just the fact that
this ever happens kind of creeps me out.</P>
<P>Anyway, Martin finds himself caught up in this stupid paint-by-number
rape/murder mystery.  Did I mention that he is the dumbest law student
since JFK, Jr.?  The smartest thing Martin does is comparing his
situation with a USA network movie.  You're not too far off, pal.  It
does boast a powerhouse collection of hip modern rock songs.  Songs that
you just don't hear on the USA.</P>
<P>Nightwatch does have a terrific dark and gritty look to it, similar to
last year's disappointment Mimic, which Bordenal produced and
Cinematographer Dan Laustsen shot.  The story is a big letdown,
especially coming from Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies & videotape).  The
identity of the killer is fairly obvious pretty early on, unlike the
current sexy thriller, Wild Things.</P>
