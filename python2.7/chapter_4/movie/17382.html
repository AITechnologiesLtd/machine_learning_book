CON AIR</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Simon Calloway</PRE>
<P> Recently, I saw Nicolas Cage in City of Angels and Snake Eyes.  Now, neither
were great films, but Cage supplied two excellent performances in them.  So, I
went back and took a look at Cage's other films, most notably I saw The Rock
(again; I forget he is in that), and Con Air, both produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer.</P>
<P> The Rock wasn't good.  I didn't like the mindless action scenes and
incoherency of the screenplay.  Now, Con Air is even worse.  A plethora of over
the top action sequences and ugly acting by Cage and such other wonderful
actors as Ving Rhames and John Malkovitch.</P>
<P> Cage plays military man Cameron Poe.  When he accidentally kills a thug who
harrasses his wife, he is sent to prison for seven years.  His sentence is up,
so he, along with many other convicts, ride home in Con Air, a plane made
especially for rapists, killers, kidnappers, etc.  All these grease balls make
for some predictable mayham.</P>
<P> A prisoner escapes him clutches, kills the pilots, and fly the plane to
Arizona.  All this makes for a mindnumbing blurr or a film.</P>
<P>Case No. 1: How did the con escape?  The film never fully explains.</P>
<P>Case No. 2: There just happens to be a con on board who knows how to fly.</P>
<P>Case No. 3: There happens to be a female security guard on the plane.  A
perfect match for the rapist who needs to have sex even during a plane crash.</P>
<P> Con Air pretty much destroys all expectations of action films.  It is the
anti-Spielberg.</P>
