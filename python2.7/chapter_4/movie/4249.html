<P>     THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN is in some ways both like and unlike Whit
Stillman's METROPOLITAN (1990).  Both are first films, both are
independent productions, both are funny, warm, ironic and high on
conversations.  But while METROPOLITAN dealt with fashionable,
high-class preppies and would-be intellectuals, THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN
is close to the other extreme.  Its main characters, three brothers,
are lower middle-class Irish-American Catholics.</P>
<P>     In a clever opening, after the funeral of Mr. McMullen, Mrs.
McMullen and her middle son Barry (the film's writer-director) stand
alone by the grave.  Sweetly but firmly she announces that she's
returning to Ireland.  She will join the man she has loved for
thirty-five years, during all of which, with Catholic patience and
principles, she had remained ill-married to Mr. McMullen.  Here and
later we learn that the husband was a drunkard, a bully, a
wife-and-children abuser.  "Don't make the same mistake" Mom tells
Barry, that is, don't enter into a bad marriage.</P>
<P>     Five years later we meet all three brothers in the Long Island
house of senior brother Jack.  Jack and Irish-American wife Molly are
the ideal couple, married five years, joking, joshing and loving each
other to perdition.  Barry, a budding script-writer just out of
college, takes his religious faith rather lightly, feels lost outside
the academic cocoon, and is cynically-humorously afraid of
commitments.  The youngest, Patrick, makes his to-the-bone Catholicism
as clear and loud as the call of angels' trumpets.</P>
<P>     As Pat andf Barry live temporarily at Jack's, all three brothers
exchange advice and opinions and try to influence one another.  The
talk is almost exclusively about women.  The funny thing is that Pat,
who is more Catholic than the Pope, has a girlfriend, Susan, who is
Jewish.  Their prudent love-making is not for procreation.  The funny
thing about diffident Barry is that after he meets for a second time
beautiful Audry (Maxine Bahns, Burns' real girl-friend), the "thief"
who "stole" an apartment from right under Barry, a very nice
relationship develops.  The funny thing about wife-adoring Jack is that
Anne, a married woman, comes on to him blatantly, calculatingly (and
ludicrously), until the reluctant fellow yields.</P>
<P>     All this  sends the McMullen men into a series of tizzies.  What
with two out of the three having a well-developed sense of sin, and the
third (Barry) being smart enough to realize what a sophisticated gem
Audry is, moral, guilt and conscience problems swell like hot-air
balloons.</P>
<P>     The most complex quandaries belong to bewildered Pat, in whose
life also enters old school-chum and co-religionist Leslie.  She too
has problems with superego and id.  Or something like that.  Smiling,
without rancor, she declares: "You can't be a Catholic and have a
healthy sex life." "Unless" retorts Pat "you meet your true love."</P>
<P>     The plot's details can be quite charming.  While the unknown
actors lack the glamour, acting savvy and smooth delivery of
professionals, this is, not so paradoxically, what makes the male
performers ring true.  In case your attention wanders a bit, Jack is
the athletic one who looks rather like a younger, trimmer and classier
Joey Buttafuoco; Barry is the one with the not very good skin and not
very good voice; Pat is the shorter one and has the most eloquent
face.</P>
<P>     The female performances are a mixed bag.  The film's construction
has awkward bits, minor holes and gauche moments.  Neveretheless the
whole stands up well.  The characters are not really terribly
interesting, but then I seem to be saying that about the huge majority
of recent pictures.  The story is clear, the three men are not all cut
from the same cloth, and the absence of whiz-bang photography, editing
and blind cinematic ambition is restful.</P>
<P>     The film was made over a long series of weekends, with funds from
relatives and friends, for (depending on what you read) anywhere from
$15,000 to $25,000.  Turned down by several festivals (the usual venues
for independent works) it was accepted by the Sundance Film Festival.
Before (so far as I could find out) it was shown there, it came to the
attention of the president of Fox Searchlight Pictures, who took the
film, put some of his people plus Mr.  Burns to work on revamping,
re-editing and shortening it and improving the sound.  He had THE
BROTHERS MCMULLEN blown up (very sharply) from 16mm to 35mm.  The total
cost climbed to $400,000 or $500,000 (reports differ), which is still a
peanutty sum.  Then, at the Sundance Festival, the movie walked off
with the 1995 top award.</P>
<P>     I suspect that the inner monologues were added too--a clumsy
device.  The music was also "revised," whatever that means, and that's
a blessing: the light, lilting Irish or Irishy music by Seamus Eagan is
a delight, and a relief from the heavy, generic scores that prevail
these days.</P>
