<PRE>                             MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     You heard it here first:  When big "Mission: Impossible" fans leave
the theater after seeing the film version of their favorite TV show, the
most common opinion will be, "I'm pissed off."</P>
<P>     Telling you why would spoil what little plot MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
actually has, so I won't.  Instead, let me try to shed a little light on
what is a messy, uneven production that had so much promise but delivers so
little.</P>
<P>     Tom Cruise, surprisingly, is not to blame.  The only A-list name in
the production, Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, the disguise expert in the IMF
gang.  Something of a rebel in the bunch, Hunt finds himself embroiled in a
mission-gone-wrong that should have been a cakewalk.  With the whereabouts
of his crew unknown (including Emmanuelle Beart, Kristin Scott-Thomas, an
uncredited Emilio Estevez, and Jon Voight as boss-man Jim Phelps), Hunt
finds himself the target of a "molehunt" from IMF bigwig Kittridge (Henry
Czerny).  Hunt then tries to play cat and mouse to expose the real mole and
the bad guys and save his skin in the process.</P>
<PRE>     But not before blowing up a lot of stuff!</PRE>
<P>     And getting to the blowing up of stuff is director Brian De Palma's
primary goal here.  In the process, he lets the story fall into new realms
of ridiculousness and "What the hell is going on?" Syndrome.  Respected
writers David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK), Robert Towne (CHINATOWN), and Steven
Zaillian (SCHINDLER'S LIST) appear to be running on fumes.  After a dozen
silly and unlikely plot twists, you really stop caring about the whole
thing and just sit back in the hopes of an impromptu explosion.  (And there
are many fewer of these than the trailer would have you believe.)</P>
<P>     MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE's success (or lack thereof) hinges on two big
scenes:  the big break-in scene (in the trailer, where Cruise is hanging
from a wire in a computer room), and the big finish (in the trailer, where
Cruise is propelled from an exploding helicopter onto a train).  While both
scenes are good, there's nothing new in them.  In fact, the break-in is
virtually identical to a similar scene in SNEAKERS.  Yawn.</P>
<P>     The free and inaccurate use of high-technobabble makes the production
look worse than it is, and Danny Elfman's score is surprisingly flat.
While the acting is on-target, never getting too far over-the-top, the
movie simply starts with a whimper... and, you guessed it... self-destructs.</P>
