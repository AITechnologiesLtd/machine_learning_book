Susan Granger's review of "THE BACHELOR" (New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>  There have been a number wedding-theme'd comedies like
"Runaway Bride" and "The Best Man" but this is the weakest of the
group. Chris O'Donnell plays a billiards heir who realizes that it's
time to give up his beloved bachelor status and make a commitment to
the photographer, Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire"), whom he's been
dating for three years. But when the moment to propose occurs,
O'Donnell lamely grins at her, offering an engagement ring, saying,
"You win." Offended by his ambivalence and obvious insincerity, she
leaves him flat. Shortly thereafter, he discovers he will lose his
grandfather's (Peter Ustinov) $100 million fortune if he's not married
by the age of 30 - which is less than 24 hours away. So, following the
advice of the family attorney (Ed Asner) and stock broker (Hal
Holbrook), he desperately arranges for a priest (James Cromwell) to
wait in the limousine, ready to perform a quickie ceremony, while he
rides around San Francisco looking for a bride. Mariah Carey, Brooke
Shields, and Jennifer Esposito pop up in cameos as his former
girlfriends.  His buddy (Artie Lange) spills the dilemma to the
newspaper which results in a climactic stampede of 1,000 wannabe
brides clad in white gowns. "It's like Larry King's living room!"
Lange quips. The screenplay by Steve Cohen was adapted from Buster
Keaton's "Second Chances" (1925) with a nod to "Brewster's Millions"
(1945) in which an ordinary guy had to spend $1 million in a month in
order to receive a major inheritance. And director Gary Sinyor ("Stiff
Upper Lips") must be an ardent fan of over-acting.  On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Bachelor" is a totally predictable,
pre-feminist 4 until, finally, the bland "hero" realizes the
non-materialistic merits of matrimony.</P>
