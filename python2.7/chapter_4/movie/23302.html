<PRE>[LIGHT SPOILERS]</PRE>
<P>Your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the
movie you're about to see: It's heavily Christmas-themed and its
release date is, oh, say, at the end of February.</P>
<P>Your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the
movie you're about to see: Charlize Theron, one of the movie's dubious
stars, makes an appearance on The Daily Show in which, when asked if
her new movie's any good, she replies with the equivalent of a verbal
sigh... assuring us that, yeah, it sure is a movie, all right!  And
there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie, and
there's some action... and there's other...  stuff... too.</P>
<P>How to immediately grab my attention: Open your movie with five dead
guys in Santa Claus suits.  Then show a caption reading "Six days
earlier..."  Ya know, I was honestly interested to find out what
killed all those poor Santas...</P>
<P>How to immediately lose my attention: Follow your opening scene with a
terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene.
Write a line for the one of prisoners like "I just want to go home and
eat Christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad."  Then, have Ben
Affleck actually say that line, on film, and forget to leave it on the
cutting room floor.  For good measure, throw in a poorly motivated
prison riot and have Affleck's best buddy stabbed... aw... and just
two days before his release, too.  Already the cliches are piled on
thick, and when it rains, it pours.</P>
<P>How to take my attention, dash it violently against the rocks, and
make it so that I'm contemplating my strategy for calling "shotgun"
about an hour before I know the credits will roll: Deny your
characters the ability to think.  Have Ben Affleck, for some reason
I'll never understand, pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he
can get his girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron.  Have Gary Sinise
show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned
casino heist.  The villains' big idea?  Kidnap Affleck because he used
to be a security guard at the casino, force him to tell you where all
the doors in the place are, then dress up in Santa suits, create some
"diversions" and rob the place.  On paper, it seems like the stuff of
a potential caper comedy, but veteran director John Frankenheimer
wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the
makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller.  It's not like
the man isn't capable... far from it.  He's the man responsible for
classic political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate and Seven
Days in May.  He wowed me with some the most memorable car chases I've
ever seen in last year's Ronin.  But he's certainly guilty of churning
out some certifiable losers... put Reindeer Games on the shelf of
shame with his 1996 version of The Island of Dr. Moreau.</P>
<P>Step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible: Cast
Ben Affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero.  He gets no
good one-liners, he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new
and interesting ways, and all we know about him is that he regrets his
past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of
pecan pie.  His name is Rudy (short for Rudolph, in all likelihood.
See, it's called Reindeer Games.  Get it?  Get it?  Shut up.)  In the
past, Affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor, and Reindeer
Games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man.</P>
<P>Step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible: Gary
Sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook
a filmmaker could have some up with.  He's dirty and potty-mouthed,
he's got long, scruffy hair and a goatee, and I fully expected him to
walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them.
He's also extremely inept at what he does.  He thinks garish cowboy
costumes and Santa suits make acceptable disguises, and he trusts
Affleck's character to pull through even after, time and time and time
again, he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him.  But
instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role, Sinise
seems to think he's playing some sort of tough, smart, and smooth
criminal mastermind, rather than the complete moron that was obviously
written into the script.  [On a side note, Gary Sinise wins this
week's "Title!" award, as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the
name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings.
Last week's winner was Natasha Henstridge for The Whole Nine Yards.]</P>
<P>How to take your bad idea and make things worse: Include two or three
plot twists that, instead of making the apparently stupidity of the
plan seem suddenly intelligent, make the plan seem even more
ridiculous and unlikely.  This is a bad movie.  And what's worse is
that, except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as
the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous, Reindeer
Games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad.
If they'd done that much, at least I would have been entertained.</P>
