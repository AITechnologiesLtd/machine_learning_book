Fight Club</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This picture "coulda been a contenda!" The flimmakers' fancy foot work in
matching up richly odd (yet achingly familiar) characters for a round of
painful redemption is nothing short of excellent. Unfortunately, the young
fighter (the film) starts slurring its punches, slipping and sliding in its
own sweat by the sixth round. Though still standing at the bell in the
ninth, "Fight Club" voluntarily hands over the title by squandering it's
award winning lead.</P>
<P>Upon the everyday canvas of life, a bizarre fighting ring is erected as a
stinging remedy/answer to it. I was (metaphorically) jumping out of my seat
and routing this picture on! Norton plays the stereotypical
materialistically-reassured yuppie with an atypically acute dose of
depression. Seeking some sense of purpose, he stumbles into a spectral
variety of support groups to which he becomes contentedly addicted until he
meets Brad Pitt. This is where the already powerful film shifts into
hyperdrive. Let's leave the plot line at that, shall we?</P>
<P>In the Tarantino spirit, this hard-hitting (at times plainly gory),
psychologically challenging film is also a comedy. Unfortunately, comedy
slips from this wondrously hybrid mix in rounds six through eight (reprising
in the ninth). Also, the motif of fists to flesh is slightly overdone.</P>
<P>Norton is great; Pitt, nothing less than mighty. Whether or not his
posterior is worshipped by half the population, Pitt is one of the greatest
actors of our time (and you can quote me on that).</P>
<P>"Fight Club" is simply rough and thick! Even though it loses punch during
its extended running time (about 2 hours 20 minutes), it is still a vibrant
contribution to the film world and has all the magnetically therapeutic
attraction to which cult-movie-goers will no doubt cling. "This is a good
life and it's ending one moment at a time." Enjoy it if you dare -- what are
you afraid of?</P>
