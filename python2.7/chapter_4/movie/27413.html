<PRE>O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?
A film review by David N. Butterworth

<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Fans of the Coen Brothers--they made "Raising Arizona," "Barton
Fink," "Fargo," and "The Big Lebowski," among others--are going to eat up
their latest film, a Depression-era musical comedy/drama loosely based on
Homer's "The Odyssey."  Others may be less appreciative, or downright
flummoxed.  Like those films before it, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
showcases the Coen's absurdist humor, their amazing ear for dialogue and,
mostly, their unrivaled inventiveness.  This is not a film you can easily
categorize or compartmentalize.  It's unpredictable, it's unorthodox, it's
occasionally quite funny (but, oddly, not as funny as it should be or,
perhaps, thinks it is).  And that, my friend, is the overriding problem
with the film: it's all a bit too much.  You come away with the feeling
that the boys have gotten a little full of themselves.  Brilliant has
always been a tough act to follow, I suppose.  "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
(the title comes from the Preston Sturges film "Sullivan's Travels" and,
not surprisingly, the Coen's latest feels like a Sturges comedy for much of
the time) follows the trials and tribulations of three chain gang escapees
in rural Mississippi, circa 1937.  Our heroes are played by George Clooney,
John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is
the smooth-talking one; he's obsessed with his hair and getting to $1.2
million's worth of buried bank notes before the state troopers catch him,
or the dam bursts.  Clooney is really the pivotal character in the film,
since Turturro and Nelson just act dumb and vacant around him, heightening
Clooney's Dapper Dan appeal.  The film, like Homer's lengthy poem, is
episodic, with the boys' journey interrupted by various colorful
characters.  There's a black guitar player they meet at a crossroads who's
just sold his soul to the devil (he wasn't using it) and with whom, as The
Soggy Bottom Boys, the foursome cut a hit record.  There's a one-eyed bible
salesman (played by Coen regular John Goodman); a gangster, Babyface
Nelson, who prefers to go by George; and a wife (Holly Hunter) with seven
kids in tow.  In addition, there are three seductive sirens washing clothes
in the river; a Governor (Charles Durning) whose campaign is being done-in
by a midget; and the Ku Klux Klan.  On top of all this, cinematographer
Roger Deakins makes this the yellowest film you have ever seen!  Nobody has
ever accused the Coens of going mainstream, and they're certainly not going
to start now.  However, like that traveling bluegrass guitarist Ulysses,
Pete, and Delmar encounter along the way, "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
seems to be missing just one thing: a soul.</P>
