Mystery, Alaska</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>For as cold as it gets up north, these people sure make a warm picture.</P>
<P>Russell Crowe (of "LA Confidential" fame) is convincing, compelling and
infinitely likeable as John Biebe the anchor of the Mystery city Saturday
pond-hockey team. Mystery is a snow-covered town where everyone knows
everyone (occasionally a little too well). The heart and pride of the small
community is solidly routed inside that little black puck.</P>
<P>Enter Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a former Mysterian displaced to the east
coast. He arranges to copter in the New York Rangers for a bit of high
sticking on the cold ice. "Mystery doesn't have much, but it does have its
dignity and its illusions," Judge Walter (Burt Reynolds) warns, "I suggest
you cling to both." It's an interestingly different role for Burt, though
his stern caution is ignored and Mystery goes on to mix it up with the NHL
team.</P>
<P>David E. Kelley of "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" (to name just a few fine
credits) provides a quality script appropriately backed up with equally fine
direction, acting and a powerful score. Aside from a sad moment where my
throat was all caught up in knots, I was smiling. I love the opening
sequence: a lone player skating atop a winding frozen river.</P>
