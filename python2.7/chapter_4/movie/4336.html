<P>     Ever wonder how toys apparently get from one place to another with
no human help?  TOY STORY, Disney's first feature-length foray into
computer animation, postulates that they do it all by themselves.  Toys
have their own magical world which comes to life any time the lights
are out or people aren't around.  Any who doubt this should take a look
a t TOY STORY.  You'll never again feel quite the same way about Mr.
Pota to Head, Monkeys in a Barrel, or Slinkies.</P>
<P>     Of course, the visual aspect is the centerpiece of TOY STORY.  T
he computer-generated effects are a marvel.  Rich in unexpected detail
( the grain of a wood floor, fingerprints and chipped paint on a door,
reflections in polished surfaces, and so on), this colorful and
brilliantly-rendered aspect of the film would alone be worth the price
of admission.  It's something of a bonus that the characters, dialogue,
and story provide entertainment value of their own.</P>
<P>     TOY STORY is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated
lesson about the value of friendship.  Parents might also be able to
use some of what transpires to encourage their offspring to put away
toys after playtime.  While the screenplay isn't a marvel of
originality, it is capable of holding the attention--light, undemanding
fun that n ever gets too immature or syrupy.  There's also quite a bit
of intelligent wit that will go above the heads of younger
viewers--that stuff's for Mom and Dad.</P>
<P>     The two main characters are toys:  cowboy Woody (voice of Tom
Hanks), the old-time favorite, and space ranger Buzz Lightyear (voice
of Tim Allen), the battery-operated newcomer.  The supporting cast
includes a dinosaur (voice of Wallace Shawn), Mr. Potato Head (voice
of Don Rickles), a piggy bank (voice of John Ratzenberger), a slinkie
(voice of Jim Varney), Little Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts), and an
army of tiny plastic soldiers who scout out the new arrivals on
birthdays and Christmas.  The humans who appear in TOY STORY are
intentionally rendered to look artificial.  In this movie, people are
"unreal"; all the vividness and multi-dimensionality is saved for the
toys.  But that's a typical convention of animation.</P>
<P>     TOY STORY opens with Buzz's arrival.  Woody is upset that this
high-tech neophyte has usurped his rightful place on the bedspread an d
in his six-year old owner's play time.  The disgruntled cowboy comes up
with a plan to eliminate Buzz, but it backfires, and soon the two rivals
are out in the real world, forced to help each other in their
struggle to escape the clutches of a toy-torturing juvenile
delinquent.</P>
<P>     How does TOY STORY compare to Disney's more conventional animated
features?  They're really very different types of productions.  This
film is less artistic and more technologically impressive.  Despite a
few Randy Newman songs, it's not really a musical.  Of course, the
target audience is the same, and everything from Disney embraces
"family values", but it's difficult--and unfair--to make an effective
contrast of the two film making styles.</P>
<P>     The one big negative about TOY STORY involves Disney's
overcommercialization.  Already, Woody and Buzz dolls line store
shelves.  Burger King is coming out with figurines.  It won't be long
before the movie is drowned in hype.  So, from the perspective of pure
entertainment, it's a good idea to see TOY STORY before the deluge of
promotions becomes so excessive that it turns off every adult.  Frankly,
the movie deserves a less ignominious fate than the marketing
overkill which will surely overcome it.</P>
