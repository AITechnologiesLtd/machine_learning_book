<P>IN SHORT: Smart Sharks. Human sushi. Yum.</P>
<P>As far as investment dollars are concerned, this week's wide release of
The Blair Witch Project has got the majors running scared. As far as us
folk that pay hard earned dollars for thrills and chills, the better
investment (as far as Cranky is concerned) is Renny Harlin's Deep Blue
Sea. The e-mail that's come in to Cranky indicates folks either adore or
detest Witch, with no evident middle ground. Deep Blue Sea, on the other
hand, almost requires an extra large popcorn and soda, so that the
greasy golden topping stuff can go splattering all over your date when
you applaud at the end of the flick. Even if you don't rave, you won't
feel cheated by this top notch popcorn flick.</P>
<P>OK, enough preaching. Let's get down to the nitty gritty chomp chomp.</P>
<P>A lovely moonlit night. Two collegiate couples on a sailboat. Girls in
bikinis, men pouring wine and a boombox booming out suitably appropriate
music. This night was not made for skinny dipping, or anything else
previously filmed 20 years ago in Jaws. This time out, it isn't a case
of prehistoric killing machine following genetic programming to lunch on
human flesh. This time the mako shark, bred in captivity as part of
experiments designed to find a cure for Alzheimer's Disease, has
deliberately attacked. How he escaped from captivity at the Aquatica
research lab is unknown. What is known is that, when Wall Street hears
the story, prime investor Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) is going
to be out $200 million or so. With 48 hours to prove her experiments can
keep Franklin out of the poorhouse, Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron
Burrows) pushes her research team to the limit.</P>
<P>One thing you should know about the mako. It's fast. It's intelligent
and illegal DNA enhancements as part of the experiments have made it
even smarter. You know this from the trailer and commercial. What you
don't know, yet, is that there are two generations of mako shark
resident at Aquatica. Gen-1 tips the scales at an even ton in a fifteen
foot package. Gen-2 adds ten feet and three more tons of mean. They hunt
in packs. They can swim backwards. They know where all the security
cameras are. Just like any prison inmate, they are biding their time,
taking stock of the human sushi on the station: shark expert Carter
Blake (Thomas Jane), who likes to swim with the beasts; marine
biologists Janice Higgins (Jaqueline McKenzie) and love-of-her-life Jim
Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgard); engineer Tom Scoggins (Michael Rapaport)
and evangelist cook Sherman "Preacher" Dudley (LL Cool J). Pick your
favorite and place your bets on who survives.</P>
<P>The gimmick is great: it isn't man hunting shark on the wide open ocean,
which is the classic. It's shark hunting man inside all of the security
precautions designed to keep man safe and protected from the elements
(until a freak accident and a raging storm break those defenses) and
from the power of the genetically bred animals (who are a lot stronger
than they look). The effects, a combination of animatronics, real
footage and CGI look "real" for the most part. The killing effects occur
so quickly that there is little time to react with more than shock.
These sharks are so big they can swallow their prey whole, so the gore
isn't exploited, much.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Deep Blue Sea, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<PRE>Popcorn flick. Pure and simple.</PRE>
