<PRE>                           THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by Paul-Michael Agapow
                        Copyright 1997 Paul-Michael Agapow</PRE>
<P>Chaos mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), having had nothing to
do in "Jurassic Park", is given a second chance when his
girlfriend (Moore) is dispatched to another island of dinosaurs.
Going out there with the obligatory cute kid and lots of vehicles
that can be wrecked by rampaging dinos, they meet up with company
representatives on a rival mission.  After hearing their English
and South African accents, the dinosaurs eat the corporate goons
and later rampage through San Diego.  At that point there is no
more room left on the back of the Minties wrapper the plot was
written on, so the film ends.</P>
<P>If your brain is the size of a peanut and in your tail, have I
got a movie for you!</P>
<P>In case you haven't heard, "The Lost World" is distinctly 
ordinary.  "Jurassic Park" was no great shakes on the braincell 
scale, but at least it had some story, novel and rather wonderful 
special effects and some halfway decent action.  (Remember the 
raptors hunting the children in the kitchen?)  But "The Lost 
World" just hauls its surly carcass up onto the screen and slops 
out the warmed over leftovers of "Jurassic".  The writing is 
criminally stupid and derivative.  I found myself groaning aloud 
as I second-guessed every plot twist.  (And let me assure you 
that i mean _every_ plot twist.)  It is interesting that "The 
Lost World" does not bother to remind you of the previous film or 
explain anything again (assuming you remember JP well), but still 
expects you to be amazed by serving up exactly the same dish.  
(The cinema here had teamed it up with "Beavis and Butthead Do 
America" which had a certain sense: "Hehe, hehe, dinosaurs ...  
this is so cool.")</P>
<P>The lacklustre plotting of "Jurassic Park' was to some extent
made up for by its SFX. Despite much touted improvements, those
of "The Lost World" are only incrementally better, some of the
matting being downright clumsy.  Now that CGI can do anything,
special effects alone are not enough to push a film.  The
direction and photography are reasonably accomplished, given the
story problems.  (One notes Spielberg's total inability to scare
anyone except with in-your-face surprises and loud noises.)
Conversely, the acting fails to survive the travails.  Jeff
Goldblum (the thinking man's Christopher Lambert) loses his
luddite speeches of the first film and gets some neat one-liners,
but fails to convince us that he is in anyway in jeopardy during
the film.  Julianne Moore's career is going straight to movie
hell if she doesn't break out of bland roles like this.  Her sole
function seems to be to accidently endanger the rest of the
party.  It's difficult to care about anyone else during the film,
because it's difficult to even catch their name.  Only Pete
Postlethwaite shows any depth as a hunter with a philosophical bent.</P>
<P>The film finally comes to life at the end with a T. Rex rampaging
through the city.  Unfortunately the cuteness of this part is
diminished by the no-brain setup.  (The dinosaur kills everyone
on the boat, including those below deck or in the small rooms,
and locks itself in the cargo hold?  Right ...)</P>
<P>In summary, "The Lost World" is only slightly more stupid than
predecessor but more lazily plotted and vastly less original and
hence much less interesting.  This is nowhere near the worse film
you could see this year, but it is one of the least inventive.
It might also be added that it is amazingly violent for the
rating it got and is unsuitable as a children's movie.

casserole on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
