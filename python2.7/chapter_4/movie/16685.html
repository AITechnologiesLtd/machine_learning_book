<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece): 
4 and half stars</P>
<P>Shakespeare in Love's recipe for success is a simple one.  Due to the film's
superb screenplay and sound acting, director John Madden is able to pick and
match the best parts of three different genres.  Clever comedy, charming
romance and absorbing drama fit neatly into this period piece, which has a
distinctly contemporary feel.  Ordinarily it would be fair enough to point out
that a director probably shouldn't attempt to have the best of both worlds (so
to speak); but here, Madden has the best of three.  </P>
<P>Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has writers block.  He's just begun working
on a proposed play titled "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter," but
struggles to find inspiration to express himself.  But, like the play's title,
Shakespeare's life soon changes for the better.  He finds motivation in the
form of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is destined to marry the snobby Lord
Wessex (Colin Firth) at the command of Queen Elizabeth herself (Judi Dench, in
a cleverly arrogant performance).  Shakespeare and Viola live out their doomed
romantic fantasy, whilst the formalities (and informalities) of producing a
theatrical production blare in the background.  </P>
<P>Those interested in Shakespearean times will appreciate the film's suggestions
and insights into what happened during this era.  Shakespeare in Love suggests
how the mysterious death of famous playwright Christopher Marlowe (played by
the always dependable Rupert Everett) occurred, and hints at how the
prohibition of women on the stage was eventually revoked (during the era, men
had to play women in drag).  On the other hand, those who desire two hours
worth of solid entertainment will get more than they paid for. Comic
performances from Geoffrey Rush as a struggling theatre owner and The Full
Monty's Tom Wilkinson as the play's producer aid the film in keeping it
accessible for everyone.  </P>
<P>Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow shine in the two meatiest parts.  Scenes in
which Shakespeare puts pen to paper work better than you may expect; each
bringing a magical touch and an involving atmosphere.  As he writes, we can
almost feel the love that inspires him.  Paltrow delivers one of - if not the
- best performances so far in her career. She has always had enough talent to
make a difficult part work, and should have made a performance like this a
long time ago (her roles in A Perfect Murder, Hush, Sliding Doors and others
restricted her charisma).</P>
<P>With so many films nowadays that try to tell too much in too little time (or,
alternatively, films that tell too little in too much time), here is one that
never oversteps the mark.  There are so many paths the film could have taken,
but Madden focuses almost entirely on the central relationship and the first
ever production of "Romeo and Juliet." Shakespeare in Love's recipe for
success is a simple one, but not an easy one to pull off.  Its carefully
crafted screenplay interlaces drama, romance and comedy smartly and
efficiently in this charming and passionate tale.  Shakespeare in Love has a
big heart, but never loses its grasp on reality or the tragedy of forbidden
love.  Not only does it work as an upbeat period piece, but also as just about
anything you want it to be.</P>
