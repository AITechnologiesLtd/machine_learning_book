<P>'Stepmom' has the worst screenplay I've ever seen for subject matter
contained within its genre.  Contrived, pretentious, corn ball, and
shallow are just a few adjectives that would be accurate in describing
it.  Releasing it during the holidays and using two cute kids in
marketing it is shameful as this is NOT a family film.  Don't
misunderstand.  It is about family but the bad taste it leaves in the
mouth is unacceptable for children.  It starts out by telling you that
two women who interact with the same man---one the ex wife, and one his
current lover, will naturally hate each other at first but will come to
accept and even like each other later on.  I've known families and have
seen it within my own family and circle of friends that once somebody
hates another person, it's permanent.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts is a photographer in love with lawyer Ed Harris (in a
completely wasted role).  Harris' ex-wife (Susan Sarandon) lives alone
and the couple have an older daughter and a younger son.  The kids hate
dad's new main squeeze and despite her attempt to like and please them,
they stick it to her every chance they get.  Every time Sarandon and
Roberts see each other, they are like oil and water.  One thinks the
other is a b**** while the other sees her rival as inexperienced and
unable to cope with family.  Caught in the middle of all of this,
naturally, are the children.  One of the kids has a laugh that is so
irritating that it will make you shriek to the point of wanting to throw
stuff at the movie screen.</P>
<P>This film is like a rock that has been thrown into a pond.  It sinks
straight to the bottom.  It goes nowhere in a credible fashion in a
running time of more than two hours.  The performances in 'Stepmom' are
somewhat admirable but it's too bad the actors didn't have the wisdom to
realize that by making the most of a bad script can't make for a good
movie.  'Stepmom' has the worst poker face I've ever seen.  It's obvious
and doesn't know how to cover-up its sugar coated shortcomings and
therefore it fails.</P>
<P>Chris Columbus ('Home Alone', 'Mrs. Doubtfire') directs this film
without a clue as to how you go  about the usual input of a director's
own idea of how a film is shaped to decide its final outcome.  Upon
reading a script, a director can make a fairly good film from a
superficial screenplay and therefore a film can be redeemed at least
part of the way.  The screenplay by Gigi Levangie, Jessie Nelson, Steven
Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ron Bass (five people?) has enough
laughably bad dialogue to insult the intelligence of even the most
casual movie fan who only sees about five or six movies per year.</P>
<P>As studios continue to take away more and more of a director's artistic
licence, movie audiences will find less and less to appreciate,
especially film buffs.  With standards being lowered, box office figures
continue to rise, not because audiences are pleased with the results of
a final cut and keep coming back but because movie theatres are being
built with bigger and better technology to distract us away from the
movie and into the theatre's coffee shop, restaurant or arcade which
sometimes are more entertaining.</P>
