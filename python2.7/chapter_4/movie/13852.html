<P>Third installment of the infamous NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET horror series
which features a young Patricia Arquette excelling in her role as the
screaming ingenue of the day.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Freddy Krueger is haunting the dreams of the remaining children from
the famous Elm Street. The kids are afraid to fall asleep, and are
placed in a medical facility for evaluation. Unfortunately for them,
the nightmares continue, as Krueger continues to exact his revenge on
the kin of the people who torched him alive many years ago. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Enjoyable enough for a horror/fantasy film. This movie never bored me
at any point, and has many cool scenes featuring violent and gross
deaths. This is the film that made Freddy cool, and distanced the film
from the real horror flic genre, while simultaneously approaching the
kitchy fantasy realm. Patricia Arquette is perfect as the shrieking
victim, and the rest of the cast is adequate as the stereotypical
misfits wrestling with their unexplained bad dreams. </P>
<P>This movie explains more of the reason why Freddy became what he has
become, and adds some pretty neat special effects (the first death at
the hands of the "Freddy puppet" is by far the coolest). Having said
that, some of the effects near the end of the film are horrible (when
Freddy's bones "come alive"), and the movie never really terrifies you,
more than anything, it grosses you out! Fun stuff if you're sitting
around the house on a dark Saturday night, looking for a flic to give
you the heebie-jeebies.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Writer Frank Darabont went on to pen, and direct, the Oscar-nominated
adapted screenplay for SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (8/10).
"The" Elm Street is located in Potsdam, NY (a small town just south of
the Canadian border, in northern New York). Wes Craven was a student
there at SUNY (State University of New York), Potsdam. 
When Laurence Fishburne was 14, he worked on APOCALYPSE NOW (7/10),
after lying about his age. He also landed a part of Cowboy Curtis on
"Pee-wee's Playhouse".
Patricia Arquette is married to actor Nicolas Cage, and is sister to
fellow actors Richmond Arquette, Alexis Arquette, David Arquette and
Rosanna Arquette </P>
