<PRE>Election **1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
starring Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, Jessica
Campbell, Delaney Driscoll
based on the novel by Tom Perrotta
written by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor
directed by Alexander Payne</PRE>
<P>It is 1999, and America, for the most part, is tired of politics. In
1998, the year of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, we had 3 political
comedies: PRIMARY COLORS, WAG THE DOG and BULWORTH. This year, we have
the unlikely teenage political satire ELECTION, which is the first
mildly ambitious film from the folks at MTV Films, but even that
cannot fully save the movie itself.</P>
<P>Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, 3-time Teacher of the Year at
Carver High School. As you may have guessed from the title, it is the
time of year for student council elections. The only presidential
candidate is Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon), an ambitious
goody-two-shoes who takes the election quite seriously.</P>
<P>But Mr. McAllister has his second thoughts about Tracy. A couple years
before, Tracy had been carrying on an affair with a teacher at the
school(Mark Harelik), who happened to be McAllister's close family
friend. When the news broke out, the teacher's wife, Linda(Delaney
Driscoll), filed for divorce immediately, and since then,
Mr. McAllister has been constantly with her, helping her run errands
while Mrs. McAllister(Molly Hagan) helps her take care of her son.
Mr. McAllister is just dying to to take his friendship with Linda to
an adulterous level.</P>
<P>So, that seems to be a basic motive for Mr. McAllister to want to
sabotage Tracy's election campaign. And the battle begins. The first
pawn that he throws her way is Paul Metzler(Chris Klein), who was the
school's quarterback until he broke his leg in a skiing accident. He
doesn't really care too much about running, but Mr. McAllister seems
to inspire him enough. Paul has no hard feelings for Tracy, and
infact, he wants her to win. But Tracy feels nothing but genuine rage
for McAllister.</P>
<P>Then, there is Tammy Metzler(Jessica Campbell), Paul's younger sister
who just happens to be a lesbian. After her best friend/lover starts
gettin' jiggy with Paul, Tammy declares all-out war, and becomes a
nominee herself. She feels that people shouldn't vote at all in this
phony election.</P>
<P>Sound familiar? Probably, if you've ever followed a real election
campaign, which ELECTION attemps to satirize. Director Alexander Payne
is no stranger to satire. He made the abortion comedy CITIZEN
RUTH. And ELECTION, his latest film, is a very smart, very funny, very
witty satire itself. But the problem lies in the characters. The only
marginally likable character is Paul Metzler, and this guy's a
dumbass.</P>
<P>Reese Witherspoon, who should remind many of a young Holly Hunter, is
one of the finest young actresses working today, but her character
isn't given any attractive or likable qualities. That is not to say
that this isn't one of her better performances; I just wish she had a
role that would let her do more. And as for Matthew Broderick, why oh
why? Forget FERRIS BUELLER; Matthew Broderick is a bad, bad actor, and
his performance in ELECTION proves my point exactly. And to have to
listen to all this voice-over whining makes the film bad enough.</P>
<P>To all the critics who said Max Fischer in RUSHMORE was unlikable, I
ask you to think a little bit about the characters in ELECTION. But,
needless to say, if ELECTION was trying to prove a point that all
politicians are unlikable, they have got that job done. But after the
presidential scandal of 1998, did we really need any more proof of
that fact?</P>
