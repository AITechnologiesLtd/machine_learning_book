<PRE>The Edge (1997)
Rated R for language, and graphic violence and gore
----------     Out of 4 stars: *** (3 Stars)</PRE>
<P>Starring: Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Harold Perrineau, Elle MacPherson</P>
<P>I swear I have seen The Edge before.  In fact, it reminded me of THE
BEAR, THE RIVER WILD, and other various films mixed into an entirely
different film.  However, The Edge has done something that most action
films should do, and that is add heart and characters we like to the
plot.  In doing so, The Edge draws many more suspenseful moments out
of cliched scenes than, say, THE PEACEMAKER.  Unfortunately, because
of those overused moments, we can pretty much guess the outcome of the
film.  But leave it to screenwriter David Mamet to add humor and a few
surprises to mess with your head.  One surprise, in particular, left
me smiling just because Mamet actually had the guts to add it to his
script.</P>
<P>Action films are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, and while they are
somewhat successful at entertaining us, they lack the one thing which
would make them a more respected genre: intelligence.  Even horror
films have learned this, a genre which is probably the least respected
of them all.  THE RIVER WILD was one of the best action/suspense films
I have seen from the 90s.  The intelligence of the screenplay, and the
suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to
this day.  The Edge has the intelligence and smart characters, but
this time the lack of originality is the downfall.  I must admit that
it was very suspenseful, and had an original third half, but the first
hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes.  This is an
example of the final act saving the film, instead of the other way
around (as in The Lost World).  If only the screenplay had maintained
the final thirty minutes' intensity, it could have become a great
action film (and I use the term loosely).</P>
<P>The Edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film.  But taking
SCREAM's lead, The Edge makes fun of the genre's cliches, and then
uses them (though not quite as effectively).  Charles Morse (Anthony
Hopkins) is the main character, a rich and very intelligent man who
wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to
him.  For once, we don't immediately care for the main character.
Instead, we like Bob (Alec Baldwin), a photographer who is going to
take pictures of Charles' wife, Mickey (Elle MacPherson), out in the
wilderness.  They board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the
Arctic.  Charles' birthday is the same day, and he receives a gold
watch from his wife, and a pocket knife from Bob.  As action films go,
these items do have importance to the rest of the story, but quite a
bit more than we first expect.</P>
<P>Soon, however, Bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because
of his "personality."  Charles, Bob, Bob's assistant Steve (Harold
Perrineau), and the pilot head off to find him, and as shown in the
previews, hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter.  Down the
plane goes, the pilot is killed, and the three are left to survive in
the wilderness.  Director Lee Tamahori is aware of the silly plot
which is about to follow, and therefore has to create original ways to
approach the situations.  He succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the
film.  Take, for instance, the entire man-hunting bear plot.  This has
been done many times in films with different animals, and even bears.
But given the Charles' intelligence, and Bob's uncertainty, many of
the cliches are given fresh twists.  Even Charles himself seems to
have seen these action films before.  My favorite line of the film
comes from Charles: "Most people die in the wilderness because they
didn't do the one thing that could save their life... thinking."</P>
<P>Despite the predictability of the main plot, a subplot develops late
in the film which took me by surprise, and made me smile when I
realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore.  I have to write
cautiously as to not reveal this surprise, so instead I will avoid it
entirely.  The first two-thirds of The Edge have many humorous moments
to push it along, and some of Charles' survival techniques seem
possible, even making fire from ice.  Tamahori is able to create a lot
of suspense from the stalking bear, but whenever the bear is present,
the characters lose all sensibility.  I have always wondered why
characters in films walk over a log to get across water.  Why not do
what an intelligent person would and crawl across?  I guess getting
chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while.
Thankfully, we already have begun to care for the characters, and so
we let this small detail slide.  But some of the technical details are
awkward, such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that Charles
and Bob make (where did they get thread and needles?).</P>
<P>The acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this
nature, and borders on phenomenal.  Anthony Hopkins gives a terrific
performance, creating his most likeable and layered character since
REMAINS OF THE DAY.  Hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles,
but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy, something he
definitely did not do in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Alec Baldwin gives one
of his best performances I have ever seen (it sure is better from his
FAIR GAME).  Baldwin can be a good or a bad character, and here he
succeeds at both in a way.  You can never quite guess if he is a nice
or a vllainous character until the end, and Baldwin is able to handle
the double-natured photographer.  Elle MacPherson gives a good
performance, albeit slight.  She isn't in the film all that much, but
for the scenes she does have, she handles as an actress, not as a
model.  Harold Perrineau is a good actor, and his scenes are nice and
underplayed.  He is eliminated early, and I reveal nothing by saying
this because it is inevitable and predictable.</P>
<P>The Edge is rated R for graphic violence, some gore, and language.
Some of the violence is a little too disturbing, even for me.  This
film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to,
but too many cliches bog it down.  Director Tamahori has created a
very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts.  David
Mamet's script, though, has a lot of humor to keep the first hour
afloat, and the acting is solid.  The best thing about the script is
the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action
sequence, but with a small detail involving a certain gift.  It's a
nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear.
And by the way, most people laughed when the film faded to black due
to a large credit to Bart the bear.  Way to go, Bart.</P>
