<PRE>                                QUEEN MARGOT
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1995 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>French, with subtitles
Directed by Patrice Chéreau
Cast: Isabelle Adjani, Virna Lisi, Vincent Perez, Julien Rassam,
Jean-Hugues Anglade and Pascall Greggory</P>
<P>     (Warning: very bloody violence and explicit sex; all justified by
the actual historic events depicted.  Do not attend if you cant stand
visceral brutality.)</P>
<P>     This is a GREAT movie: fascinating, entertaining, enlightening,
sensual, top-notch performances and very very accurate for 16th Century
historical look and feel.  Although the costumes are magnificent, they
are often sweaty and bloodstained.  You can almost smell the crowd.</P>
<P>     Set in 1572 France, torn by religious wars between Catholics and
Protestants.  Queen Mother Catherine DeMedici (Virna Lisi in an
astonishing performance) continues to rule France, even though her son,
King Charles IX, has come of age.  The film opens with a marriage
between the Kings Catholic sister, Margot (Adjani), and Henri of
Navarre (Daniel Auteil), a protestant King.  Dimly light scenes
accurately capture sweaty, night interiors as we see tensions mount
between Catholic and Protestant roommates on the eve of the
celebration.</P>
<P>     The St. Bartholomews Day massacre of Protestants (who were wedding
guests of the court) is depicted with visceral realism.  It leads to
intrigue and blood letting that would make any DYNASTY viewers head
spin.  Not for the squeamish or feint of heart.  The screenwriter chose
not to soften the incredible atrocity of the massacre, which provides
for some intense imagery; ladies of the court delicately stepping over
bloody corpses that are being stripped by looters.</P>
<P>     The photography is magnificent, and this is the first historical
film in recent memory with highly believable lighting.  Except for one
dramatically overlight cathedral, most of the interiors seem to be lit
only by grimy windows or candlelight.  Much of the plot revolves around
the newly weds being held in the Louvre as virtual prisoners.  You
share their paranoia about what might be lurking in the inky dark
shadows.</P>
<P>     A good portion of this films visual gifts are provided by four
handsome French actors, who intersect with Margot in a variety of ways
as her brothers and/or lovers.  Its easy to imagine that Pascall
Greggory, as Anjou (next in the line of succession) may well be drawing
from past life memories.  He looks gooood in that long hair and
mustache, and he knows how to broadcast a sense of authority by the way
he rides a horse.  Jean-Hugues Anglade, the smoldering male lead from
BETTY BLUE, plays King Charles.  Heart throb Vincent Perez is luscious
as the Protestant lover, despite the grimy makeup and sweaty costumes.
Queen Margots motivation is no mystery here.  Isabelle Adjani has
evidently discovered a secret fountain of youth; no face lift scars,
and she looks virtually identical to her film persona of 20 years ago.
Be prepared to hate her.   ;-)</P>
<P>     This film will stick with you for a long time.  I highly recommend
seeing it on the big screen, which would prove more revealing for the
magnificent costume detail.  I fear that much of the subtle nighttime
detail would fade into black pixels when viewed on video.  I also find
subtitles more subconscious in larger type in a darkened theatre.  This
is also the kind of film that stirs a lot of audience energy that you'll
miss in your living room.</P>
<P>     Due to the film's historical accuracy, there are no clear cut
protagonists.  Like the courtiers themselves, you may find yourself
dizzied by the constantly changing tides of power and intrigue.  Unlike
most popular Hollywood films, QUEEN MARGOT does not rewrite history to
make any of the characters more appealing than they probably were in
real life.  Thats one of the reasons I liked the film.  Its also one of
the reason others may hate it.</P>
