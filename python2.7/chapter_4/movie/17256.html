                                 RAVENOUS
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeffrey Jones,
                David Arquette
DIRECTOR:   Antonia Bird
WRITER:     Ted Griffin
RATED:      R
RELEASED:   1999</PRE>
<PRE>                 RATING: * 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Black comedies have always courted the concept of
cannibalism, but few have done so with the fervor of Antonia
Bird's "Ravenous."  Like so many recent films, the idea
probably sounded better on paper: a group of soldiers develop
a taste for human flesh, and are forced to deal with the
conflicting emotions this stirs within them.  But "Ravenous"
uses its perch not to entertain but to preach: it's a thinly
disguised morality lesson on mankind's animal tendencies,
told with some of the most disquieting violence I've ever seen
on the big screen.</P>
<P>        I'm willing to believe that cannibalism can be funny--
those of you who are Monty Python fans will no doubt recall the
comedy team's famous skit about an outbreak of the practice among
the British Royal Navy.  "Ravenous," however, takes the same three
minutes of humor and pads it out to two hours, losing the focus
and immediacy of the comedy along the way.</P>
<P>        Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce), a decorated veteran of the
Mexican-American War, finds himself transferred to the wayward Fort
Spencer in the mountains of California.  The outpost is a small one,
staffed by only eight people, but Boyd doesn't mind: it sounds like
the perfect place to recuperate from his recent combat trauma, not
all of which is physical.</P>
<P>        He's not the only new arrival, however: a Scottish man
named Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) is found nearly frozen to death
in the snow outside the camp.  He soon recovers, and tells his
hosts a strange tale involving the cannibalistic habits of his
former traveling companions when they were trapped in a cave
together during a fierce winter storm.  Colqhoun escaped, he
claims, just in time to avoid becoming their next meal.</P>
<P>        Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones, the bumbling principal from
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off"), leads the group to the nearby cave
to investigate Colqhoun's story.  What they find there I will
not reveal, except to mention that multiple members of the party
eventually succumb to the temptation of tasting human flesh,
which has ramifications they do not initially suspect.</P>
<P>        "Ravenous" is essentially a vampire movie without the
fangs, as the characters who develop a taste for human meat are
forced to deal with their unnatural cravings without arousing the
suspicion of their companions.  Had the film been clever enough
to further develop these ideas, we may have been treated to a fine
psychological thriller, or at least a decent black comedy.  But
no: the tale repeatedly goes for cheap shots and cliche'.  Robert
Carlyle, so charming in "The Full Monty," enjoys playing the
demented madman here: observe how he cackles like a mad scientist
while dragging his latest victim into a cave.  Carlyle is no
stranger to playing psychotic characters: he was the dangerous
Begbie in "Trainspotting."  But he is less convincing as Calqhoun,
probably because the character is so thinly sketched.  He
contradicts his story so many times over the course of the movie
that I never knew whether I was supposed to feel horror, sympathy
or mirth towards him.</P>
<P>        There are some interesting avenues for character
development, which the film unfortunately chooses to ignore:
Boyd's experiences in the war are fascinating enough that they
deserve their own movie, not the cursory flashback that "Ravenous"
allows them.  David Arquette's portrayal of the cackling drug-
addicted camp cook seems so inconsequential that I wonder if it
was improvised.  He has few lines, preferring instead to giggle
continuously throughout the movie.  The two Indians who live in
the camp also appear to have larger stories to tell, though the
film doesn't give them the opportunity to become anything more
than dialogue placeholders.</P>
<P>        It's possible that the movie may have been a worthy
thriller if it had stayed within its psychological boundaries;
Calqhoun's tale, for example, hits a fine note of tension and
horror, and we are at least able to understand the reasoning
behind his actions, even if we don't condone them.  But "Ravenous"
goes for cheap horror cliches time and time again: Dead people
repeatedly spring back to life, ala "Friday the 13th."  People
who are on death's door can be completely healed by a simple taste
of human flesh, since the meat gives supernatural powers to any
who might eat it, or some similar nonsense.  By the time the
film attempted to explain itself, I'd quit paying attention.</P>
<P>        There are a couple of nice touches.  The landscape
photography is beautiful (I've always been a sucker for well done
snow photography).  Also, the musical score from Michael Nyman is
unconventional, seeming to consist of three notes played over and
over again, conveying a sense of looping, sonic madness.  I liked
the subtle but disquieting effect this generated.</P>
<P>        There are a few entertaining moments in "Ravenous," but
they are few and far between, a fact that is not helped by the
story's slow pacing.  The movie is much too long to justify a
plot this miniscule; a more liberal fat-trimming during the
editing stage (or a better script) would have made it more
watchable.</P>
<PRE>        ("Ravenous" munches its way into theaters on Friday,
          March 19th.)</PRE>
