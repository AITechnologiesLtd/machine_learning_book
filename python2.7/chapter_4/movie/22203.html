<PRE>Dante's Peak
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan; Linda Hamilton; Jamie Renée Smith; Jeremy Foley &
Elizabeth Hoffman</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan stars as volcano expert Harry Dalton who works for the US
government's geological department. He is sent into the quite town of
Dante's Peak when geological readings indicate a higher than normal level of
activity around the dormant volcano on which the small community is built.
When Harry arrives, he also notices a variety of other factors which lead
him to believe that Dante's Peak may have some very big problems on its
hands in the not too distant future. Harry tries to warn the mayor (Linda
Hamilton) and town council of the impending danger, but is over ruled by his
boss who prefers to take a wait and see approach to the possible problem. Of
course, in the end, Harry is proven right, and the volcano awakens with some
of the best special effects that movie producers can buy.</P>
<P>While the special effects are great, Dante's Peak is more about the story
leading up to the impending disaster than the disaster itself. Which is not
to say that when the volcano eventually erupts that the producers don't milk
it for all it's worth. Now at this point, there is probably some fool out
there thinking "gee thanks for spoiling the movie for me by telling me that
the volcano blows". To that guy I say – hey moron, what did you think was
going to happen in a movie about a volcano? That they were going to spend a
pleasant day looking at it while eating a picnic lunch? Although I guess
that kind of is a small problem with movie like Dante's Peak -- you pretty
well know from the get go that massive property damage is going to occur at
some point in the film.</P>
<P>While most of the movie takes place before the actual eruption, there is
enough tension in the air to keep the audience interested. I really didn't
notice that the movie isn't filled with high-end special effects. And
towards the end of the film when the computer-generated lava rears its ugly
head, it makes the wait well worth it. I think a good deal of credit for the
tension should go to the amazing score of the movie. I don't think it would
be possible to match up a score to a movie better than what was done in
Dante's Peak. When we do get to the eruption, the volcanic effects are
impressive and very realistic. Pierce Brosnan does a great job in the
leading man role here, although this should come as no surprise to James
Bond fans. An impressive supporting cast backs up Brosnan and Linda
Hamilton. Most of whom are relative unknowns, but they all do a very solid
job.</P>
<P>There will be no doubt in your mind that this is what it feels like to be in
the midst of a volcanic event. My hat goes off to director Roger Donaldson
for the film's impressive realism. This was the first of 1997's two lava
movies, the other being Volcano. Of the two, Dante's Peak has the stronger
story and is just a tad bit more on the realistic side. While it might not
have the dizzying number of special effects that populated Volcano, I think
it is fair to say that Dante's Peak's effects budget was put to slightly
better use, by concentrating on making the volcanic activity look more
realistic as opposed to simply over the top. Good movie -- well worth
checking out.</P>
