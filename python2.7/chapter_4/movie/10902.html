<P>Capsule Review:
    To audiences used to movies that tell you how to feel, director Atom 
Egoyan's new film may seem like a cold, lifeless ordeal. The more 
discerning and patient viewer, however, will find this to be a mournful, 
absolutely shattering cinematic experience, possibly the best of the 
last year. Ian Holm gives a magnificent performance as an ambulance 
chasing attorney whose self-serving attempts to heal a small Canadian 
community's pain after a horrific accident only ends up ripping new 
wounds. Egoyan, previously best known for the dark puzzle EXOTICA, 
displays an astonishing mastery of the medium here, freely mixing 
timelines in order to view the tragedy from all sides. (He makes an 
especially resonant and inspired connection with the fable of The Pied 
Piper of Hamlin.) The result is a film that affects the watcher in a 
delayed, haunting fashion; you don't realize you've been hurt until 
you glance down and see the blood.</P>
