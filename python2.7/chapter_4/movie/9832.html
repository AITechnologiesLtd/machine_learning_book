<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The situation is explosive.  A lone former employee has commandeered
   the Museum of Natural History.  Armed with a shotgun and explosives,
   he's wounded a security guard, and holds a few museum employees and
   a visiting class of young children hostage.  Holed up behind the
   relative safety of museum's security implementations, his sole
   liaison to the police and outside world is -- a ruthlessly ambitious,
   ethically bankrupt TV investigative reporter?  Uh-oh.</P>
<P>   Such is the scenario for Costa-Gavras' MAD CITY, which, through
   exposition of the increasingly-compromised ethics and outright
   dishonesty in modern television reporting, wants to be a searing
   indictment against the media, but ultimately produces little more
   than a singe.</P>
<P>   Chief in its problems is its lack of originality; this is simply a
   story which is too familiar to be told in such a straightforward
   manner.  Not only has the theme of media manipulation been addressed
   in similar fashion in several other films, but it's safe to conclude
   that by now the increasingly mistrusting and suspicious public is
   jaded enough to fully realize that the reporting it absorbs through
   print, radio, and television comes with a spin courtesy of the
   source which delivers it.  Tom Matthews' screenplay for MAD CITY
   tells us nothing new in this respect; it's preaching to the
   converted.</P>
<P>   Essentially a character study which focuses on the everchanging and
   curiously symbiotic relationship between gunman Sam Baily (John
   Travolta), a museum security guard recently laid off due to budgetary
   constraints who accidentally triggered the hostage siege when
   returning to attempt to plead his case to museum director Mrs.
   Banks (Blythe Danner), and reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman),
   a former network star desperate to regain his ace status after being
   demoted to local coverage, MAD CITY is relatively intimate and staid
   enough that it could function in a glossed-down form as a stage
   production.</P>
<P>   Sam is not a bad man: he's effectively a slow-witted simpleton
   played by Mr. Travolta as a lost puppy dog who haplessly bumbled his
   way into the volatile situation presented in MAD CITY.  The film
   takes great pains to assert his relative innocuousness -- his
   shooting of the other security guard (fine character actor Bill
   Nunn, curiously billed extremely low considering his substantial role
   in the film) was accidental -- by presenting him with a childlike
   mentality: he frolics with and wins over the captive schoolchildren,
   and perpetually turns to Max for guidance.  In this treatment, MAD
   CITY tries to be a bit too cute for its own good at times, which
   undermines the tension inherent in the situation.</P>
<P>   Of course, Max is happy to pull the strings behind this story and
   milk it for all it's worth -- this is his ticket back to the big
   time.  While the film is often simply blatantly unsubtle with its
   theme of media manipulation and sensationalism, as evident by a
   recurring thread in which Max tutors Sam on how to play up the
   situation in order to win public support (and of course, in his own
   self-interest, create high ratings), as well as a scene where Max
   edits and syncs interview footage until the final product corresponds
   with what he wants his subjects to say, one can almost relish his
   forthright, unapologetic lack of scruples.  While not disturbing as
   the film would seem to like, Max's aggressive naked ambition
   occasionally proves to be quite amusing: a particularly good moment
   in the film is a flashback sequent which depicts the cause for Max's
   demotion -- a moment of on-air grandstanding histrionics which
   humiliated network anchorman Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda).  However,
   in a move which seems arbitrarily artificial, MAD CITY ends up trying
   to play it both ways by having Max be as slimy and manipulative as
   the system the film cries out against, and then do a sudden
   about-face as the plot requires and grow a conscience; it rings
   patently false.</P>
<P>   Yet, although it's anticlimactic and often a little too heavy-handed,
   MAD CITY is always engaging and maintains interest.  Well shot by
   Patrick Bloosier and paced well, the film unfolds in a logical
   progression which is predictable but ultimately inevitable.</P>
<P>   It's helped by good performances from its cast.  MAD CITY is
   essentially a showcase for Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Travolta, who are
   solid in their respective roles.  I couldn't help but enjoy Mr.
   Hoffman's depiction of a character who discards objective reporting
   and puts a spin on his story with nonchalant efficiency, and Mr.
   Travolta, despite my best efforts to resist, is occasionally
   endearing through his character's bewilderment at the escalating
   situation in which he finds himself.  He does tend to substitute the
   use of slang for obliviousness in his character here, much as he did
   for a remarkably similar character in another performance -- in
   Desmond Nakano's WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, Mr. Travolta played a
   lower-class, uneducated working man whom, after being laid off from a
   menial job, took his employer hostage.  On the note of drawing
   parallels to previous work, the theme of chastising media
   manipulation isn't new to Mr. Hoffman, as can be witnessed in Stephen
   Frears' HERO (titled ACCIDENTAL HERO overseas).</P>
<P>   Mia Kirshner has a lot of spunk as the protege videographer Laurie
   who falls under Max's wing and learns the tricks of the trade
   all-too-well, eventually becoming seduced with the glamour of
   'making' the news.  Ms. Danner is good in a small role as the museum
   director and lends dignity to the part, although most of the time she
   just gets to stand around.  Mr. Alda is fine, although it's somewhat
   dubious to cast him as a network star anchorman -- he just doesn't
   have the gladhanding aura about him.  William Atherton rehashes a
   variation of his most famous role from as unscrupulous reporter
   Richard Thornberg in DIE HARD (which, in its own way, was even more
   effective and less self-righteous in its skewering of the media) --
   here, he plays a transparently-vacuous local anchorman.</P>
<P>   While MAD CITY thankfully avoided overt parallels to the O.J. Simpson
   media circus, and was wrapped production before any references to the
   Princess Diana incident could be made, the handling of the race card
   in the film struck me as far too heavy-handed, and the montages of
   T-shirts being sold outside the museum and folk singers strumming
   odes to Sam pushed the film too far into satire.  Granted, as can be
   seen from coverage outside the L.A. courtroom from 1996, it's not at
   all unbelievable, but the film would have been more effective and had
   a stronger impact had the emphasis on the carnival-like atmosphere
   which prevails along with media events been lessened.</P>
<P>   MAD CITY can be neatly encapsulated with one particular sequence, in
   which Max chastises Laurie for aiding the wounded museum guard --
   she can't film him and help him at the same time, and the former
   clearly takes precedent.  It's a heartless sentiment, but the
   sequence, like the film itself, is neither quite as disturbing or
   shocking as it's intended to be, because we already know the film's
   angle.  For a potentially potent story, MAD CITY, while eminently
   watchable, is curiously hollow.</P>
