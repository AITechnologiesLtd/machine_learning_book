<P>If you're reading this, the first thing that catches your eye is the **
rating. It is sadly low for those who, like me, know and appreciate much of
John Frankenheimer's "oeuvre."</P>
<P>Frankenheimer  (now 68) was big in the 1960s,  with a succession of
notable, often great movies including Birdman of Alcatraz; the political,
paranoid cult-thriller The Manchurian Candidate; the political conspiracy
thriller Seven Days in May; the WWII Resistance adventure The Train; the
affecting melodrama of skydivers, The Gypsy Moths; the haunting, chilling,
humanistic sci-fi Seconds, and arguably the best film starring Rock Hudson.</P>
<P>By the 1970s Frankenheimer had crested but still made some gems: The Iceman
Cometh; the sequel French Connection II -- which my minority opinion rates
above the original French Connection;  Black Sunday, a suspenseful,
intelligent entry in the terrorist sub-genre. Then came a decidedly mixed
bag, although when Frankenheimer returned to television in the 90s, he did
very well with TV features (Andersonville, The Burning Season, George
Wallace). On the big screen he stumbled in 1996 with the ludicrous yet
campy The Island of Dr. Moreau.</P>
<P>In Ronin he shows an amount of pizazz that would put most younger
filmmakers to shame, but he does not add the wisdom, logic and
thoughtfulness that ought to come with age and experience. A combination of
The Dirty Half-Dozen, Mission Improbable and flicks of older decades, this
movie-movie belongs to what might be called "Explosive American Cinema,"
all action and no substance.</P>
<P>A bunch of mostly older, experienced mercenaries -- the old "motley group"
cliché-- is hired by  Deidre, a young Irish woman, to recover a case, a
metal thing like those used by photographers to carry their cameras in. The
(too) atmospheric beginning in a  (too) seedy Paris cafe gives no clue as
to who is who, what is what, whose orders Deirdre is passing on. This
murkiness will prevail throughout the picture. In bits and pieces we get
vague crumbs of information about the "motley group" (itself an old
cliche), none about anyone's (on all sides) psyches, motivations, and zero
about contents of the case. The soldiers of fortune (if this is what they
are) are of various nationalities (not all of them clear), individually
specialize in this or that, may or may not be renegades or operatives of
such outfits as the CIA, the KGB,the IRA...One man handles complicated (and
probably not yet invented)  computer stuff that tracks cars which whoosh by
at the speed of rockets.</P>
<P>"Less is more" is a wise formula, but less can also be less, as here, while
"more is more" (overkill, as here, in the action) is  always definitely
less, a handicap. When the action gets going, man, does it go!  Never
flagging for a moment, the chasers and the chased (who are also mysterious,
undefined types) shoot it up, then shoot some more (both en masse and
individually), then yet more, and get involved in triple,quadruple, perhaps
even quintuple crosses.</P>
<P>Above all, there are endless car chases that take us from Paris to the
Riviera and back. It is painfully clear that Frankenheimer is out to beat
all records of vehicular movie pursuits, such as those in Bullitt, among
others, and especially in French Connection I which was directed by
Willliam Friedkin, the man who in 1985 tried to top himself with To Live
and Die in L.A. Here Frankenheimer comes up with a movie in contemporary
settings but in the spirit of actioners of past decades.</P>
<P>The South of France, the scene of incredible mayhem, is also shown in a
colorful (and genuine) way that ought to make French  Tourist Offices
recommend that the filmmakers be awarded the Legion of Honor. We go from
the Hotel Majestic in Cannes to the Corniche--the sinuous mountain highway
by the sea where Princess Grace of Monaco had her fatal accident. (Later,
the whizzing within Parisian car tunnels recalls Princess Diana's demise).
We go, always with guns and bazookas blazing whilst the cars bounce off
civilian property, through villages, Mediterranean resorts, the city of
Nice. What happens in the streets of Nice has to be seen to be believed. In
fact, the more it is seen the less it is believed. How the chasers and the
chased elude each other, how too little and too late the cops are, how so
few pursuers, pursued, innocent Nicois and others are killed or maimed,
beggars the imagination. But since, already quite early into the movie
imagination has been so anesthetized, it plays no role.</P>
<P>The Duels in the Sun continue in the city of Arles (170 miles west of
Nice), mostly in the old Roman Arena where the opposing sides, made
increasingly confusing, fight it out mano a mano as well as group vs.
group. By now Frenchman Jean Reno and American Robert De Niro are pals but
still keep their secrets. Somewhere near the return road to Paris, Reno
takes his wounded friend to the country house of mysterious (read:
illogical and undefined) Michael Lonsdale who is not a doctor, but has all
sorts of surgical equipment which he does not know how to use. So De Niro
operates on his own self. It's all done with mirrors, literally.</P>
<P>In Paris, more dumbness takes place.How fast the searchers locate the
Russian Mafia re-boggles the non-mind, for example), and exploits,
coincidences, and more get complicated by a traitor, the Russian Mafia, and
an ice-skating show starring "Natacha Kirilova." She is played by the
real-life German (made Russian here) Olympic champion Katarina Witt whose
gyrations provide the only --and unplanned-- sexy moments of the movie.</P>
<P>After she is shot dead by a sniper (don't ask) and the other side  (don't
ask either) gets hold of the precious case, AND there is another
double-crossing, AND unexplained persons come and go, De Niro gives a 100%
unbelievable car chase all over Paris at Mach II speeds, destroying in the
process chunks of the city and a fleet of innocent automobiles.</P>
<P>The breathless action is a single-minded series of messes on top of
unexplained and inexplicable messes. And we never do find out what's in the
case. Think of Luis Bunuel's Belle de Jour and the mysterious box that a
Korean client brings to a high-class brothel -- but then, Bunuel had a
teasing sense of humor and mockery that "Ronin" lacks. The case may be like
Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffins, but "Ronin" is light years away from
Hitchcock's clean story lines, his humor and mischievousness, the richness,
fascination  and humanity of his characters.</P>
<P>A text that opens the movie tells us that in feudal Japan, those masterless
samurai who wandered the land and hired themselves out as swords or
bandits, were known as Ronin. Later there is some verbal elaboration of the
legend (from fact) of "The Loyal 47 Ronin" which was made into a filmic
two-part classic (1941, 1942) by Kenji Mizoguchi. But "Ronin" hardly fits
those references.</P>
<P>Frankenheimer's movie is another case of the desperate attempts to find
something to replace the Cold War duels that sustained action flicks over
decades. There's no doubt that "Ronin" has excellent technical values and
great photography, that its performers are mostly striking within the
limitations of their one-dimensional roles. But the human side is absent,
the dialogue minimal and unrevealing, the entire thing a mindless
tour-de-force. Its writer J.D.Zeik is a first-timer. David Mamet was called
in as script doctor and rewrote most of the scenario as "Richard Weisz."
Doctor Mamet should have healed himself.</P>
