<P>Two movies by Mexicans in one week: Maria Novaro directs the Mexican
³Danzon² and Luis Mandocki (³Gaby-a True Story² and ³White Palace²) directs
³Born Yesterday.²</P>
<P>In 1946, Garson Kanin¹s ³Born Yesterday² was a Broadway hit. In 1950 it
became a movie directed by George Cukor. Both works made a star of Judy
Holliday. The current ³Born Yesterday² claims to be based on the play, but
it is closer to the movie.</P>
<P>I am getting tired of comparing originals and remakes, as I have done
recently for ³Sommersby,² ³The Vanishing² and ³Point of No Return.²  This
time, I will make only passing remarks.</P>
<P>The 1950 film is by far the better of the two. It is also good in itself,
even though the comparison is, understandably, making some critics
overpraise the original. The new version, though only fair, does make an
unboring  time-passer.</P>
<P>Crass and shady millionaire Harry Brock (John Goodman) goes to Washington
in order, not to clean it up like Mr. Smith, but to push some crooked
senators already on his payroll into saving a military base adjoining his
mammoth development.  He is accompanied by his mistress Billie Dawn
(Melanie Griffith), a ditsy blonde ex-Vegas hoofer whom he loves but treats
like dirt. Also with him are his "consigliere"  Edward Herrmann and Harry¹s
nephew Max Perlich.</P>
<P>In a world of luxury, name-dropping, phony chic and dachshund limos, and in
a series of scenes -- some funny, others not -- Billie¹s unbelievable
mega-stupidity and ignorance prove to be embarrassments. Harry hires
smarty-pants journalist Paul Verrall (Don Johnson) to tutor her. At first
Paul refuses, but then a $500 a day fee (plus expenses, I would imagine)
overcomes his principles.</P>
<P>Even a pea-brain can guess what will happen, starting with Billie¹s ³I
don¹t want some stuffy old tutor.² Guess whom the camera shows next? Right
away, she makes blatant passes at Paul, and after some bits o¹ business
(funny and non-funny)Billie blooms instantly into wisdom, learning and
Paul-crush.</P>
<P>She asimilates learning with the speed of a movie E.T., learns about the
Constitution, reads Tocqueville, discusses him -- when in reality she might
have learned, at the very most, to speak like tabloid headlines. Educating
Eliza Doolittle or Rita was credible, but educating Billie?</P>
<P>The hors-d¹oeuvre to this menu is in ³Being There² mode, as Billie learns
the eight responses for all occasions. Cued by Paul, she applies them. It¹s
dumb, it¹s entertaining, and it includes the goof ³That¹s about as funny as
a Democrat  being elected President. ² The movie must have been made during
the Bushian post-Desert Storm glow.</P>
<P>Among the howl-inducers is Billie¹s profundity. She contemplating a Van
Gogh in a museum.  ³It¹s so small but it feels bigger than the whole room.²
Another is her mnemotechnical trick to remember Constitutional Amendments.
At a posh Washington restaurant she sings them to the tune of ³The Twelve
Days of Christmas² with band and co-eating celebrities obligato. Just
recalling this can make one blush from embarrassment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back at a dude ranch, Paul has been falling for Billie faster
than the "blitzkrieg,"the lightning-fast initial  German victories in World
War II.  This is infinitely less credible than in the 1950 edition. But
then Paul himself is unbelievable, a pallid character with a deep tan that
keeps reminding you that you are watching Don Johnson, a.k. a. Mr. Melanie
Griffith, Hollywood  Actor, here transferred from the streets of Miami to
the power corridors of Washington Vice.</P>
<P>Everything is telegraphed and marked like runway lights in an airfield.
It¹s no surprise that the pliant Billie (in whose name Harry has most of
his properties) will rebel and show Harry and Washington a thing or two.</P>
<P>She also shows her legs. I had not intended to see this film until I saw an
ad that showed, intriguingly, a pair of beautiful legs with a man¹s leg
(contortionism?) draped over the gams (a word used  in the original play¹s
period). My curiosity was not libidinous but nostalgic and cine-referential
: the photograph somehow brought memories of ³The Graduate²¹s poster and
Mrs. Robinson.</P>
<P>Lackaday!  Even if Billie becomes a graduate of sorts, this movie is no
³Graduate.² But it does have some small surprises. Item.  The legs in the
photograph must be those of a body double. Item. Don Johnson is short,
shorter even than Melanie. I bet that, as in Alan Ladd pictures, they used
a lot of boxes and special camera angles to play down the differences in
size. Item. Edward Herrmann is wasted. Item. In his microscopic role, the
small Max Perlich is totally superfluous. Perhaps he was edited out in the
final cut. Perhaps Perlich knew somebody.</P>
<P>Item. Goof or subtlety? Paul, a writer and savant who also teaches at
Georgetown, tells Billie: ³If I get involved with you I¹m no different THAN
Harry.² Billie, seconds later: ³You¹re no different FROM  Harry.²
(Capitalization mine).</P>
<P>Item. Paul: ³Hello, how have you been?²  Billie: ³Very GOOD  And you?²
Paul: ³Pretty GOOD.²  To think that in spelling bees, some kids age 11 to
13, in my town, can spell ³sporran,² ³cerography, ² ³zaibatsu² or
³wapentake.²</P>
<P>Among the sins of ³Born Yesterday². First, not any two characters ever
connect or show rapport. Secondly, Johnson and Goodman are both miscast,
the first being made into a phony intellectual, the second into a massive,
crude ball of dumbness that lacks the nastiness of his predecessors, Paul
Douglas on the stage, Broderick Crawford on the screen.  This Harry is so
ludicrous that his contorsions on a dance floor conjure up Barnum and
Bailey¹s kneeling elephants.</P>
<P>The movie misses a major opportunity : to illustrate that a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing by taking many of the Washington celebs who
scoffed at Billie and expose them as mere possessors of tidbits and
veneers, morsels handy for posing as smart, educated, literate or chic. In
the kingdom of the blind, one-eyed people are kings. There¹s a whole
comedic expose to be made on this subject.</P>
<P>"BY"has an ostentatious look of unbridled capitalism and profiteering. The
hotel where much of the action takes place is the luxurious Willard, gutted
in 1986 and restored as the Willard-Intercontinental. But Harry¹s
imperially Presidential  penthouse suite is an imaginary construct of 4,000
square feet where charges for a few days can be more than the average
American¹s yearly salary. The skillful setup of this suite allowed a great
deal of camera mobility and deep-focus shots.</P>
<P>The better news is that overall the picture  does not bore and does
entertain, even though there are no major laughs, because, perhaps of the
underlying, mean-spirited mood of the picture.</P>
<P>The Golden Raspberry Foundation has awarded Melanie Griffith the prize for
Worst Actress of the Year (for ³Shining Through² and ³ A Stranger Among
Us²). But now she redeems herself as the best of four choices to replace
Judy Holliday. Melanie, a Black Belt among cerebrally challenged stars,
fits her part so effortlessly here that you are not even conscious of her
notorious little-girl voice. But then again, Judy Holliday convinced us
that inside her uncultured dumdum persona a smart, sharp ³natural² was
waiting to come out.  With Melanie Griffith, this takes a leap of faith.</P>
