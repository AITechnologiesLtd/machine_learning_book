<P>WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</P>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If you've been following William Fichtner's career (and there's absolutely
no reason why you should have), you might have noticed that he's played
some rather similar roles over the years.  Like Sully in "The Perfect
Storm"--tough, gruff, and a little bit scary.  Or Law in "Albino
Alligator"--tough, gruff, and little bit scarier.  Or Colonel William Sharp
in "Armageddon," or Dwayne Engelman in "Strange Days," or even his brief
appearance towards the beginning of "Pearl Harbor," as the abusive father
of Danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough, gruff,
hard-hitting roles.</P>
<P>Which is why his performance in "What's the Worst That Could Happen?" is
such a shock, such a delight.</P>
<P>In the film, Fichtner plays a blonde haired, meticulously dressed, overtly
effeminate, dog-loving detective.  As Alex Tardio, Fichtner's performance
borders on caricature but goes beyond it.  It borders on offensive but
doesn't really manage it.  And it borders on clichéd stereotype but doesn't
quite succumb to that definition either.</P>
<P>In a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we
should have seen it coming, Fichtner isn't perfect--you can see him
struggling a little at times, concentrating a little too hard on the look
as he swishes his hand through the air, or nuzzles a coiffed canine up
close and personal--but he's pretty damned good, and silly, and without
question the best thing in the film.  In fact, had it not been for
Fitchner's sudden and bizarre appearance, and his jarring screen presence
thereafter, I would have walked out, for "What's the Worst That Could
Happen?" is mesmerizing in its awfulness, a poorly written, haphazardly
edited, and totally unfunny (yes, it stars Martin Lawrence and Danny Devito
so how could that be possible?) moviegoing experience.</P>
<P>Fichtner's performance doesn't exactly save the film, and it's not like
I'm recommending "What's the Worst That Could Happen?" solely on the
strength of the actor's dramatic turnaround, but his contributions do raise
the film's rating from no stars to one-and-a-half.</P>
<P>Thumbs up to Fichtner then, and thumbs down--way, way, down--to everyone
else involved in this sorry mess, a movie so dull and pedestrian and
nonsensical it doesn't even warrant discussion.</P>
