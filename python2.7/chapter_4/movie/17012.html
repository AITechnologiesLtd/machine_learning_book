<P>Back in the early 1980's, there was a slasher movie craze, and it 
eventually burned out because the films simply weren't any good, 
reaching for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking. But then 
1996's "Scream," a genre-shattering horror flick, suddenly revived the 
genre, and since then we have been bombarded with new horror movies, and 
the strange thing is, ever since then, they could be divided easily into 
two categories: the great ("Scream," "Scream 2," "I Know What You Did 
Last Summer") and the awful ("An American Werewolf in Paris," 
"Wishmaster," "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"). Usually you can 
tell before you see one of these little fright items whether they are 
going to be worthwhile or not. And luckily, the new slasher film, "Urban 
Legend," directed by newcomer Jamie Blanks, fits in the former category: 
the great. </P>
<P>"Urban Legend" stars Alicia Witt (TV's "Cybill") as Natalie, a student 
of the fictional northeastern college Pendleton University, who becomes 
convinced after several dead bodies show up that a psychopathic killer 
is on the loose, murdering people in ways that are based on urban 
legends (i.e. an axe-wielding killer hiding in the backseat of your car, 
a babysitter receiving threatening phone calls that are coming from 
inside the house, etc.). Complicating the story even more is the myth 
that at the college 25 years ago, a muder spree took place, and the sole 
survivor was Mr. Wexler (Robert Englund), who, surprise!, is currently 
teaching the American Folklore class at Pendleton U.</P>
<P>As in the "Scream" movies, "Urban Legend" has a lot of fun toying with 
its audience on who the killer is: could it be Mr. Wexler; Paul (Jared 
Leto), a journalism major and potential boyfriend of Natalie; the 
school's janitor; or any number of the other students and staff. 
Regardless of this minor similarity to "Scream," "Urban Legend" is an 
original because of the extremely clever, ingenious storyline. 
Practically no popular legend is left unturned, and all of them are used 
to spooky effect. </P>
<P>There are many things that separate this from those 80's stalk-and-slash 
movies: the characters aren't all one-dimensional airheads, and the 
performances are from mostly talented up-and-coming actors; the writing 
is sharp and often funny, with many in-jokes and tributes to other 
movies, most noticably "Halloween"; the killer's identity is, for most 
of the running time, unpredictable; and most importantly, it is actually 
scary, with many effective, suspenseful set-pieces. Two particular 
moments that are especially nerve-wracking is the opening scene, set at 
a gas station, and the other is set at a radio station. The picture runs 
at a brisk pace, and is consistently entertaining. The technical credits 
are superb, particularly the moody cinematography which casts the 
college as an ominous character of its own, and the down-beat music 
score by Chrstopher Young. Another plus is that there are very few songs 
in the movie, compared to other recent "hip" films aimed at young 
adults, and like some of the great genre works, like "Halloween" and 
"The Exorcist," it relies more on an instrumental scores. </P>
<P>If there is a negative thing about the resurgence of the horror genre, 
it is usually the climax, which reveals the killer's identity and then 
becomes an example of overacting, and loses its frightening grip. Not 
here. In "Urban Legend," the villain, whom will remain nameless, 
obviously has a lot of fun, and it becomes both menacing and strangely 
humorous. Oh, and one last thing that is worth mentioning: Loretta 
Devine, who plays the school's black security guard who is obsessed with 
Pam Grier and blaxploitation movies, is a standout, stealing every scene 
she's in. The same thing goes for Tara Reid (last seen in the Coen 
Brothers' "The Big Lebowski), as Sasha, Natalie's friend, and DJ at the 
college's radio station. "Urban Legend" is one of the very best of the 
recent slasher offerings, because it mixes its laughs and chills with 
more smoothness and grace than usual, and it proves that just because 
it's a horror movie that includes people being murdered doesn't mean it 
still can't be intelligent and impressive filmmaking. </P>
<P>The DVD edition of "Urban Legend" comes to you in a wonderful package 
filled to the brim with interesting and insightful special features. The 
film is certainly the best horror film to be released since "Scream," 
but the extra supplement material buoys it over to being an absolute 
must-buy on DVD.</P>
<P>First, the DVD transfer and sound is top-notch, like all of Sony's 
releases, and includes clear, precise colors, with an appropriate 
emphasis on shades of blue. Aside from maybe one or two instances, there 
are no noticable hints of bleeding or grain, and the sound perfectly 
compliments the the picture quality, with an especially powerful 
transfer of the memorable music score. The orchestral accompaniments 
were actually noticed more on DVD than when I saw this film in theaters 
last September. Like usual, I ignored the Full Screen version of the 
film and did not even take a look at it since any well-knowledged film 
buff will know that Widescreen is incomparably superior, capturing the 
theatrical aspect ratio that the movie was meant to be seen in.</P>
<P>As for the Special Features, Sony deserves a round of applause for going 
out of their way to bring us many enjoyable bonus'. The "Making-Of" 
featurette, which runs about ten to fifteen minutes, was fascinating 
because Director Jamie Blanks narrated the footage, which shows us 
filming of some of the major sequences, including the opening scene at 
the gas station; the parking garage death scene with John Neville; and 
the set-piece in the forest with Alicia Witt and Joshua Jackson (as 
Natalie's wise-cracking friend, Damon). Also among the featurette is an 
intriguing deleted sex scene between Michael Rosenbaum and Tara Reid in 
which they are attempting to mimic the positions of the Kama Sutra. 
Although fun to watch, the scene was wisely cut since it was rather 
pointless to the story and concluded with an odd occurrence happening 
that didn't really make much sense in the context of what follows. The 
Filmmaker's Commentary was done in my favorite commentary format, in 
which Director Jamie Blanks, writer Silvio Horta, and actor Michael 
Rosenbaum discuss the making of each scene as the film moves along, 
adding surprising and often funny anecdotes about the making of the 
picture, as well as stories of the cast and how they actually managed to 
get the film made in the first place. A particularly amusing on-going 
discussion that they bring up throughout is how they found the late Gene 
Siskel's negative review rubbish, since he claimed the film was far too 
bloody and gruesome. The filmmakers repeatedly point out, however, that 
they purposefully tried to stray away from excess blood and gore in the 
film, making it appear with tight edits that the viewer has seen more 
than they actually have. Other intriguing anecdotes during the 
commentary were that several lines were improvised; Loretta Devine's 
part grew more and more as they discovered how very good she was in it; 
and that the self-referential scene in which Jackson turns on the radio 
to hear Paula Cole's "I Don't Want To Wait" (the theme song to TV's 
"Dawson's Creek," which Jackson stars in) was actually thought of on the 
spot and was filmed during the last take. Finally, other Special 
Features include actor biographies and filmographies, which come in 
handy if you are interested in learning about each star and what else 
they have previously been in, and the film's atmospheric theatrical 
trailer.</P>
<P>With such a splendid compilation of Special Features on a film such as 
"Urban Legend," which was one of the more entertaining films of 1998 
(and on my runner's-up list of the year's best), this DVD is one of the 
better presentations that I have come across since buying my DVD player 
in September of 1998, and judging from the fine commentary, Director 
Blanks is a talented new filmmaker whom I expect a bright future from.</P>
