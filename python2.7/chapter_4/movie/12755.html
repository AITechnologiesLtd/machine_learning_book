<P>   As Michael Moore points out so incisively in his
documentary "The Big One," greedy corporations will do
anything to amass profits.  Even companies on a roll thanks
to the faithful toil of their workers will throw their hirelings to
the wolves if doing so will garner more specie for the
stockholders.   "Clockwatchers," neither as flat-out hilarious as
"The Big One" nor as lacerating, treats the dilemma of
downsizing in a more heartfelt way.  In Jill Sprecher's sincere
motion picture, educated women are unable to find permanent
jobs, implicitly because American companies prefer to hire
temporary workers in order to avoid paying benefits.  These
temps are kept on simply because the enterprises who hire
them can get away with doing so.  What had been during the
1950s simply a small sector of the economy has now become
almost a norm.  Lower-level workers are anonymous and
dispensable, shunned as pariahs and as people of little
consequence by their colleagues who are "permanent" as well
as by the executives who exploit them.</P>
<P>   Obviously, their low status on the corporate totem pole is
going to have effects on the temps' character.  Jill and Karen
Sprecher have captured the consequence of company policy
so well that they've either done their homework or have been
temps themselves.  The Sprechers are not so doctrinaire that
they blame the economy for every blemish in the employees'
make-up: they are more interested in providing us with three-
dimensional portraits of four particular women working for a
large credit firm, women who even without the abuse they
abide are quirky gals and therefore thoroughly entertaining.</P>
<P>   Take Iris (Toni Collette), for example.  Here's a young
woman whose flaws were likely present long before she took
on a job as a temporary worker.  Not so much announcing
her presence at her new assignment as skulking into the post,
she acts like a scared deer gazing in terror at the headlights
of an oncoming Mack truck.  Asked to have a seat while the
manager is fetched, she remains hunched over in a chair for
two hours before the appropriate person greets her with
astonishment: "Why didn't you tell me you were here?" 
Luckily, she is befriended by the office extrovert, Margaret
(Parker Posey), who steals the movie from that point. 
Margaret shows her the ropes.  If a client phones, she may
simply hang up ("If its' important he'll call back") or gives him
advice on buying and selling as though she were really
instructed by an executive to do so: ("He says go ahead an
sell").   Jane (Alanna Ubach), yet another temp, whines that
nobody mixes with her kind or tells her anything of
importance, illustrating her gripe by an experience she had
while working at a bank: "There was this button on the desk
and I kept looking at it every day for a month and finally I just
pushed it.  It was the alarm."  Paula (Lisa Kudrow) lives a
fantasy, allegedly going to auditions and telling her co-workers
that she's a temp only until she gets the starring role she
deserves in a movie.</P>
<P>   Aside from this clearly differentiated quartet, director
Sprecher hones in on familiar office types such as the anal-
retentive supplies person who seems to develop stomach
pains when he has to issue a pencil; the suave and
handsome junior exec who looks right through the women
who help him out and seems never to learn their names; the
efficient office manager who chirps instructions on how to
arrange the papers on the desk for maximum neatness; the
CEO who baldly insists that everyone in the office is like
family.</P>
<P>   The movie gets its name from the principal activity of the
officer workers, which is to stare at the big wall timepiece with
the passion of fourth-graders eager to get out of school and
watch the Jerry Springer show.  While we in the audience are
unlikely to gaze at our own watches, we do become aware of
the passage of time during the second half of the movie,
when a contrived element is introduced into the plot.  A series
of thefts puts the office on security alert, making the daily
grind at once more exciting and more strained.  Naturally
everyone concludes that the temps--who have no roots in the
job--are the culprits.  What should have been a passing plot
point changes the focus of the movie, which begins to lose its
comic good will.</P>
<P>   Sprecher never really goes for the throat the way Michael
Moore does in "Roger and Me" and in "The Big One," but her
laid-back and frequently mirthful film serves as a gentle
warning on the way our society is headed.  The dissolution of
the bonds connecting labor and management may lead to
higher profits, at least in the short run.  But what sort of
country will we have as wealth continues to become
concentrated in fewer and fewer hands and the majority of the
population are as alienated as Karl Marx's proverbial
proletariat?  Rated PG-13.  Running time: 96 minutes.  (C)
