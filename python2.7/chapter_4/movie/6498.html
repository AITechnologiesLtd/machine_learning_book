<PRE>                               TOMMY BOY
                       A film review by Will FitzHugh
                        Copyright 1996 Will FitzHugh</PRE>
<P>I saw this one on video and I consider it an ominous sign when 6
previews are tacked onto the beginning of the tape.  Is the movie that
short?  Is anybody who rents this a sure bet to see just about
anything?  Apprehensions aside, let's continue (the answers to those
questions, by the way, are 'no' and 'probably').</P>
<P>'Tommy Boy' is Chris Farley's first major role after smaller,
moderately amusing parts in 'Airheads' and 'Wayne's World'.  Here he
plays a fat, dumb recent college graduate who gets a do-nothing job at
his father's (Brian Dennehy) auto parts factory.  There's some amusing
stuff of his last days at college; drinking, smoking, passing out and
running into things.  If Jim Carrey is the Jerry Lewis of the 90's (a
stupid comparison, in my opinion) then Farley is the Buster Keaton and
Charlie Chaplin (two guys put together, get it?) of the, um, well,
let's put it this way: he's got the hair of Nicholas Cage, the body of
John Candy and the face of, uh, well, forget it.</P>
<P>So his father marries Bo Derek whose son is Rob Lowe who actually turns
out to be her husband.  Dad has a heart attack at the wedding (the
prospect of spending the rest of his life staring into Bo's blank stare
probably pushed him over the edge) and Bo and Rob's plan to take over
the business goes on the fast track.  Tommy is forced to take over his
father's sales route to save the business and Farley and weenie David
Spade hit the road.  See, the trip is not only a literal journey to
riches but a spiritual quest for self-discovery (a la 'Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance: the Series' or Dennis Hopper's wistful
'Flashback') which leads them to the brink of failure and then to
ultimate success.  Plus Farley gets hit with a two-by-four and runs
into some more stuff and there's several witty masturbation jokes
thrown in.</P>
<P>Did I mention the obligatory love interest?  Luckily, the director
(Peter Segal, whose only other film was 'Naked Gun 33 1/3') has the
good sense to leave any love-making off-screen (which is bad enough for
those of us with vivid imaginations).  Or maybe it was cut to satisfy
Jack 'Off' Valenti, along with the bong-inhalation shot that was
clipped almost to nothing.  Whatever.  The final analysis reveals that
Farley has too much talent to waste in watered-down John Landis-type
retreads like this.  He should be playing Puck in Kenneth Branagh's 'A
Midsummer Night's Dream' or Baron Harkonnen in the David Lynch version
of 'Dune' (can you imagine? David Lynch doing 'Dune'.  How could it
fail to be cool?) or a replicant in 'Blade Runner II' (now that my
first choice, John Candy, is no more).  Don't go for the quick kiddie
cash, Chris.  Pursue your artistic vision.  Scare people.</P>
