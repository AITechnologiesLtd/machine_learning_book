<PRE>.                            THE SPANISH PRISONER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     "What I learned while watching THE SPANISH PRISONER," by Christopher
Null.</P>
<PRE>     1. Don't trust nobody.</PRE>
<P>     2. If you develop a secret formula for the company you work at,
*especially* don't trust nobody.</P>
<PRE>     3. Steve Martin and Campbell Scott - wow!  Who knew they had such
talent.</PRE>
<P>     4. David Mamet's still got it, even though HOUSE OF GAMES will remain
his masterpiece.</P>
<P>     5. When a girl says she knows an FBI agent, don't call the number on
the card!  Look them up in the phone book and make sure she ain't lying
through her teeth.</P>
<PRE>     6. A bad title doesn't matter.</PRE>
<P>     7. Ed O'Neill will never appear in a better film, however briefly.</P>
<PRE>     8. Never carry a package on a plane for a stranger.</PRE>
<PRE>     9. This is probably the best movie you'll see this year.</PRE>
<PRE>     10. Don't trust nobody (except me).</PRE>
