<PRE>Godzilla (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 21 May 1998 with Andrea for $18 at the Sony Lincoln Square and on
22 May with Tony for $8.75 at the Cineplex Odeon Chelsea.</P>
<P>There is a good news and bad news about *Godzilla*. The good news is that
*Godzilla* does not destroy anything above 60th Street, so my
rent-stabilized apartment was never in danger. The bad news is that the
only good thing about Godzilla is the lizard itself; the acting, story,
and script is flawed. So why did I see it twice? Well, that's a
Seinfelding saga not worth repeating. </P>
<P>Actually, seeing it twice made me notice some subtle humorous touches I
didn't notice the first time, but was it worth spending in excess of $25
for it? Well, no, but I have done enough sneak-ins and seen enough
Godzilla (and Mothra!) free on cable to see the karmic justice in this. </P>
<P>Directed by Roland Emmerich (of *Independence Day* fame) and from the
makers of Tylenol, *Godzilla* has been promoted since I saw the preview at
*Men In Black*, and the audience went wild. A lot of secrecy surrounded
the new look of the monster, and with good reason. It's not as "human" as
the original Toho version, and it's face is amorphous.  As Andrea put it,
"They do the feet the best."</P>
<P>An interview with the director reveals that until *ID4*, a lot of filming
was done in New York, and the monster was added later with computer
graphics. So the result is some fairly realistic scenes of authentic
destruction of New York. In fact, the monster destroys the area a block
away from my office, which was spared. Damn. Also, seeing Godzilla
diving over the West Side Highway and into the Hudson River was pretty
neat. </P>
<P>There are also some neat homages to other movies here. The opening scene
of the sinking of the Japanese fishing boat is right out of the Japanese
monster movies that inspired this movie. The Mayor's first scene is
reminiscent of the umbrella scene in Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent and
the finale at Madison Square Garden reminds me of the final scene of the
Birds..</P>
<P>That's about it for praise. As Dave points out, a big flaw in these
special effects blockbusters is that there is too much talk. Also, the
acting budget is scuttled, so we get a shrill, vapid Maria Patillo (as
Audrey) instead of a Helen Hunt or a Minnie Driver. It's like two
different movies there for a while. Effects-laden monster suspense one
minute, B-grade comedy straight-to-video the next. Matthew Broderick as the
atomic scientist hero is not an asset either. However, he does fulfill the
traditional role of the little boy Godzilla loves.</P>
<P>Everyone seems rather two dimensional and bumbling. There's the stuttering
military man O'Neill (Doug Savant), the New Yawk cameraman "Animal" (Hank
Azaria) who embodies every stereotype (including an annoying wife who
lovingly calls him a "dumb wop."), Harry Shearer as the sexist pig
newscaster, Michael Lerner plays Mayor Ebert--complete with Gene, the
campaign manager he abuses (that seemed bizarre--I guess the director
hates Siskel *and* Ebert).. The only character that is truly humorous and
not annoying is Jean Reno as the French secret service man who feels his
country's responsibility in creating Godzilla inadvertently by doing
nuclear tests in Polynesia. It's a shame that the joke of his assistant
spies being named Jean-Claude, Jean-Paul, and Jean-Philippe is hidden
until the final credits. Oh, and who keeps a top-secret videotape in a
tent TOP SECRET written with big red letters on it?</P>
<P>There are some inconsistencies as well. It's pouring rain half the time,
but that effect is turned on and off like a faucet. It's supposed to be
raining, yet there's a pushcart vendor flipping burgers on the grill? The
It's pouring rain when people first see Godzilla but when there's a chase
scene minutes later, the rain stops. It starts again when the chase is
over. A movie that costs this much should be able to afford some
continuity. The city is really ravaged, but there is electricity flowing
freely. No gas main explosions or watermain leaks either, which we have in
New York *without* a visit from Godzilla. It's PG-13, and while some
people are killed off camera, there are no injuries and no hospital or
medical scenes.  Godzilla puts a hole in the Pan Am Building in the middle
of a workday, and there is no mention of casualties? It's PG-13 all the
way. </P>
<P>The love story and the "news story" angles are silly and two-dimensional.
The original Toho productions usually kept the human stories fairly
message oriented about the environment. The film's opening sequence does
this; it's too bad that the rest of the film didn't do that. </P>
<P>The original music by David Arnold is good in the opening sequence, but
not as good throughout, and the hokey Japanese trumpets of the Japanese
version is sorely missed.   </P>
<P>Add a star if you loved *Godzilla* movies as a kid, or if you are a kid.</P>
