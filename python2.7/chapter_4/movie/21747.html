<PRE>Rating: * * *½ out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Rated: R for graphic horror violence and gore, and some sexuality. (And TONS of
heads)</P>
<P>Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien,
Michael Gambon, Christopher Walken, Christopher Lee, Martin Landau.</P>
<PRE>Running Time: 106 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Only Tim Burton could to it: Make a big-budgeted horror flick based on the
classic tale by Washington Irving....and make it great. 'Sleepy Hollow' works
on so many levels that in the middle of the movie, I had a huge smile on my
face and thought 'Man this is awesome!'. Of course most of you know the Legend
of Sleepy Hollow and the book by Washington Irving which has always been one of
my favorites. TIm Burton directs with such skill that he has created one of the
most beautiful films put on print.</P>
<P>The movie opens with a creepy and scary little montage of the Headless
Horseman's first victim. From there on we meet Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) New
York's constable who is sent in my the judge of the town to Sleepy Hollow where
many people have been losing something there. Here in Sleepy Hollow he stays
with the Van Tassel's. He hears the story of the headless horseman and does not
really know what to believe, he meets the Van Tassel's daughter Katrina
(Christina Ricci), who's mother and father are Lady Van Tassel (Miranda
Richardson) and Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon). He really doesn't believe
in the fairy tales of the headless horseman until he himself has an encounter
with him which scares him out of his wits. He however sets out to find the
headless horseman, and for once and for all stop him from killing
again....before he becomes the next victim. </P>
<P>I must say the best things about this movie are: Johnny Depp's wonderfully
comical performance which he does so good it would almost surpass his Edward
Scissorhand's performance. Christina Ricci seems to also give one of her best
performances to date with strong back-up from Miranda Richardson (always good)
and Michael Gambon. I think the strongest thing of the movie however is the
Headless Horseman himself. Part CGI part man in suit, he is nothing more than
astonishing. He looks incredibly like he has no head, and when you see him a
chill goes down your spine. When he rides his horse its very creepy and when he
chops off someone's head it really does make you scared. For the person who
plays the Headless Horseman he was well-cast and very scary when they tell how
he died. </P>
<P>Astonishingly enough this isn't the kids story it was before. This is a very
mature film that has so much smartness and cleverness in it, that you have to
wonder why it could not have been made before. It has a dark, creepy atmosphere
and a beautiful setting with incredible costumes. The whole film has a sort of
gothic feel to it, and may be too dark for some people. It is also incredibly
gory and bloody with over twenty beheadings, all resulting in bloody messes.
The beheadings are also very graphic and only one or two are off screen. The
violence and gore may not appeal to everyone so I am just trying to warn you so
you know about it. For those fans and even non-fans of the horror genre I don't
think you will be disappointed.</P>
<P>The directing was also incredible and Tim Burton did just like he did with
Batman and gives it a special touch to be something you didn't think it would
be. He did a great job with shadowing and in the end it's very surprising and
satisfying. One flaw was some slow parts in the movie and one scene that went
on forever, but besides that 'Sleepy Hollow' doesn't have much wrong with it.
The performances are all strong  (except Casper Van Dien YUCK!)as is the clever
writing with a surprising amount of comedy.</P>
<P>Even though the story has been done many times before, this one seems to the be
the best of them all. The 65m dollar budget shows quite clearly and in the end
pays off. It is a beautiful film, with some amazing camerawork, along with the
neat little opening titles. The film is very intense, with some downright scary
moments that had me holding on to my arm chair. 'Sleepy Hollow' does have a few
changes in it than the movie did and adds some surprising twists especially in
the end, and the person who plays The Headless Horseman was quite scary and
well-cast.</P>
<P>'Sleepy Hollow' will go down as a new classic in the horror genre, and shall
not be remade anymore. I would not be surprised if this movie is a hit with
both the young and old crowd. The movie is all entertaining, scary, funny and
gory. It has a touch of this and a touch of that and should have something to
impress or please someone. TIm Burton gives us a great film worthy of the
rating above. With its creepy atmosphere, its graphic violence and witty comedy
'Sleepy Hollow' is nothing but a great movie.</P>
