<PRE>                             UNSTRUNG HEROES
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Acting in Woody Allen films and her friendship with him have
influenced and enhanced her many talents.  UNSTRUNG HEROES is not a
Woody Allen type movie nor story.   It is totally Keaton.  However, the
perfection and intelligence she displays in making the film are
something Allen has always attempted and usually succeeded in
accomplishing.   There the resemblance ends.</P>
<P>     UNSTRUNG HEROES is a gripping tragic-comedy.   The tragedy is that
Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) early on in the film  becomes ill with
what appears to be a malignant brain tumor.    Selma is the wife of Sid
(John Turturro).  They have two children, Steven (Nathan Watt) and his
younger sister Sandy (Kendra Krull).</P>
<P>     Sid, the father of the family, is an eccentric inventor who has
yet to come up with something salable.   He is very bright but he talks
to his children (Danny is twelve and his sister is seven) as if they
were adults.   Nevertheless, Danny, who has a high I.Q., understands
much of what Dad is spouting.   This is a wonderful loving family that
is suddenly hit hard when the housemaid angrily blurts out that "You
know your mother is dying!"</P>
<P>     Others in the family are Dad's brothers, even more eccentric than
Dad.  There is Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin.
They provide the much needed comedy breaks.  Uncle Danny wants Steven
to be called Franz so he would be Franz Lidz (which happens to be the
real name of the author of the book on which the film is based)   Uncle
Arthur and Uncle Danny live together.  There are hundreds of stacks of
newspapers which they expect, one day, to read.  Because Steven cannot
bear to watch his mother's illness he gets permission to live with the
two uncles for the summer.</P>
<P>     The film has Oscar written all over it.   Its direction is so well
balanced, its photography of the 1960s and all the attention paid to
every detail, with a great cast doing fine work make this a great film
such as few others that have been released this year.</P>
