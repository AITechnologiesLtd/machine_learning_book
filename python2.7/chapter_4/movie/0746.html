                                    Q & A
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Sidney Lumet directed a very adult look
     at police corruption, racism, and politics.  The story is
     complex and often hard to follow but it has a strong feel of
     authenticity.  Rating: +2.</PRE>
<P>     I generally claim that a film can tell the same story you could tell in
forty to sixty pages of prose.  That rule is not infallible.  Q & A is a
long film (at 132 minutes) but it is amazing how much happens in the course
of this realistic thriller looking at police and politics.  It is difficult
to believe this hard-edged film could have been directed by the same man who
last year directed the much softer FAMILY BUSINESS.  Q & A is complex and
frankly, difficult to follow, with many more major characters than one
expects to see in a film.  It is nice to see a film that does not talk down
to its audience even if perhaps it goes a little far in the other direction.
Not making the film any easier to follow, much of the dialogue is spoken in
(realistically) thick accents.</P>
<P>     Q & A opens with policeman Mike Brennan (played by Nick Nolte)
murdering a Puerto Rican drug pusher and then intimidating witnesses into
saying the dead man pulled a gun on him.  Called in purportedly to
investigate (but actually to whitewash) is Al Reilly (played by Timothy
Hutton), the new D.A.'s assistant.  Reilly was formerly a policeman and the
son of a much-loved legend on the police force.  The case does look simple
enough to start with, but a friend tips off Reilly that there may be more
going on than is immediately apparent.  The more Reilly digs the more he
finds.  His chief subject, Brennan, is a big, easy man instantly likable and
quickly detestable.  He has an open love of crude, though often funny,
ethnic jokes that soon gives way to an obvious racism.  Brennan is finding
himself in an increasingly multi-ethnic, multi-racial New York and resents
how things have changed since the "good old days."  In fact, there are many
ethnic and other minorities represented in the plot--virtually every
important character is from a minority--and the hatred each group has for
the others is part of what the story is about.  The plot involves Irish,
Italians, Puerto Ricans, gays, and Jews--Sephardic and Ashkenazic.  The plot
also involves a D.A.~with higher political aspirations (played by Patrick
O'Neal) and a drug runner (played by Armand Asante) involved with both the
victim and with Reilly's former fiancee.  There is no chance I can do a
reasonable job of explaining a complex and highly inter-woven plot such as Q
& A in a paragraph or two.</P>
<P>     Q & A has a very downbeat feel to it, without the sorts of heroes this
sort of film would usually have.  Lumet is not trying to make us like his
characters but instead just wants us to see the way things are.  It is set
in a New York City that is as easily recognizable by the feel as by the
buildings.  The music is by Rube'n Blades, who also wrote the song under the
titles.  (Blades, incidentally, is reportedly very likely to announce soon
his candidacy for the presidency of Panama.)  For Lumet Q & A represents a
return to a more serious style of filmmaking, such as his PRINCE OF THE
CITY.  I rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
