<PRE>Rating: * * *½ out of * * * * </PRE>
<P>Starring: David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, Edna Holt,
Lynn Mabry, Steven Scales, Alex Weir, Bernie Worrell. (All band members)
Unrated contains no offensive material.</P>
<P>Release Date: September 15, 1999 in New York, then spreads throughout the
country after that.</P>
<P>I will admit now, I've never heard of The Talking Heads. In fact I've never
even heard any of their songs, but after watching this brilliant film I wished
I had known more about them before. </P>
<P>This concert film which is nothing but the group performing before a live
audience (Cut the word which). So you say, well the performers are so good,
especially David Byrne who gives a great performance on stage, and along with
their groundbreaking songs, the whole film remains a classic after 15 years the
film is still recognized and popular.</P>
<P>Jonathan Demme directed the film, which contains sensational editing, amazing
camera shots, and spectacular songs. The Talking Heads were a group between
1976 and 1988, and in 1984 they made this film which was a taped concert of
sorts (featuring) of some of their greatest songs which Include 'Burnin' Down
the House', 'Psycho Killer' and 'Once in a Lifetime'.</P>
<P>What makes 'Stop Making Sense' such a good movie is the fact that it has
excellentcamerawork, that we feel we are actually part of the concert audience,
rather than watching a filmed record of the show. Being remixed in Dolby
Digital sound, it is surely crisp and fresh. The picture is sharp and clear,
and is amazing. The songs are even more amazing, starting with David Byrne the
lead singer, walking out on stage with his boombox and guitar, starts singing
and eventually his whole band and back-up singers appear. </P>
<P>What makes the film even more interesting is the performances that David Byrne
gets, not by acting but by singing: he lives out the songs and entertains us
while we listen to them. At one point he wears a big suit, that looks like his
head is smaller than the rest of his body, which became his trademark for
several years to follow. </P>
<P>We get in the feel of the movie as it progresses, the songs made me want to get
up and dance my brains out since they are all good-natured and bright, fun
songs. Some may get bored by 'Stop Making Sense' and want more to happen
besides songs but, the songs are what make the movie. They are the dialogue of
the movie and instead ofDavid talking them he sings them. Brilliant,
innovative, and probably one of the best rock performances I've seen in my
life. </P>
