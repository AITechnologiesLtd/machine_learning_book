<P>starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton
screenplay by Ron Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
directed by Jon Amiel</P>
<P>Sean Connery is permitted use of his native accent in Entrapment (or,
as Connery pronounces it, Entchraphmint) while theWelsh Zeta-Jones is
not. Her character's exotic beauty and worldly ways are at odds with
her bland, midwest dialect. It doesn't help that Zeta-Jones is no
Meryl Streep when it comes to vocal gymnastics. But then, most (men,
at least) aren't likely to notice that Zeta-Jones' lips are even
moving as they watch Entrapment; slinking between security devices
like a hungry feline (she's a cat-burglar, har har), Zeta-Jones is
adept at real gymnastics. Her impeccable physique takes centre stage
in a film that elevates thievery into performance art.</P>
<P>Connery plays Mac, an infamous robber baron who takes Zeta-Jones, as
rookie thief Virginia Baker ("Gin"), under his wing. She wants to
steal a priceless Chinese mask; as Connery proves quickly, she's
flexible but not as cunning as he is. I should mention at this point
that Gin is a double agent, if you will: she's working for the
treasury to bring Mac down. Her tutelage is a ruse.</P>
<P>Or is it? Twenty minutes into Entrapment, I determined just what kind
of movie it is: the type that throws red herring after red herring at
the audience, peeling away story layers like pieces of a Chinese box.
Yet the experience of watching Entrapment is not nearly as frustrating
as sitting through the similarly plotted Wild Things, a film that 
unwrapped its bandages only to reveal the invisible man. (Entrapment,
unlike Wild Things, is not out to deconstruct a genre; for all its
twists and turns, it is a conventional, mainstream picture.) One
element of Entrapment does remain pleasantly constant throughout, and
that is the bizarre tango between Connery and Zeta-Jones. Whatever 
their motivations, it's clear that they're smitten with one another
from their first scene together. (Aside: note the phallic imagery the
first time Mac meets Gin-she is naked in this scene, and his gun
provides an amusing and subtle gag.) While their romance doesn't quite
conjure memories of such old-fashioned pairings as Cary Grant and 
Grace Kelly, the two actors achieve a level of intimacy that Eastwood
could not with any of his young, female co-stars from the recent True
Crime. (I mention Eastwood-who is close in age and stature to
Connery-only to emphasize the May-December nineties trend; sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't, though the time is nigh for both men
to admit their age on screen, as Beatty did in Bulworth.) Entrapment
also features a freakish performance from Canadian actor Maury
Chaykin, who invests his bit part (as a Confuscious-quoting guru to 
burglars) with a ferocious energy that recalls early Nicolas Cage.</P>
<P>Jon Amiel has had a spotty career (his Copycat is a series of missed
or botched opportunities). Entrapment is directed efficiently but only
the set pieces show real visual flair. I felt the break-and-enter
sequences in DePalma's Mission: Impossible were the best things about
it; Entrapment's are similarly thrilling. For the Chinese Mask number
(which left me breathless), the filmmakers may have created a new
sport: laser ballet. I also enjoyed the extensive training before the
second heist: movies of this ilk rarely acknowledge the rehearsals
that take place before the main events.</P>
