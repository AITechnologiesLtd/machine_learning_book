<PRE>HANNIBAL</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Ridley Scott
Written by: Thomas Harris (novel), David Mamet, Steven Zaillian</P>
<P>It's been some time since Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) escaped from 
prison and FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster then, Julianne Moore 
now) made a name for herself by catching a dangerous psychopath. Now Agent 
Starling is under attack from the FBI and from the media because she shot a 
drug dealer who was carrying a child. Leading the attack is Justice Agent 
Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). Meanwhile, Lecter is living the good life in 
Italy, but he's drawn the attention of local law enforcement officer Pazzi 
(Giancarlo Giannini), who plans on turning Lecter in to the FBI for the two 
hundred thousand dollar reward. Also working against our wayward cannibal is 
billionaire Mason Verger; a crippled, hateful man whose face Dr. Lecter 
convinced him to remove some years back. Verger is helping Agent Starling 
determine Lecter's whereabouts in an effort to bring him into his own 
clutches to exact revenge. Despite the multitude of enemies working against 
him, Lecter holds all the cards and seems unstoppable. In fact, his only 
weakness might be a growing affection for Clarice, which might lead him 
right into her hands.</P>
<P>I've made it clear on several occasions that I don't think <i>The Silence of 
the Lambs</i> is all it's cracked up to be. That said, I walked into Ridley 
Scott's (<i>Gladiator</i>) film with certain preconceived notions about what 
I'd think of it. Now, I don't care what other critics tell you about being 
able to walk into a movie without any bias one way or the other. The moment 
you see a preview, or read one review, or even read the cast list, you form 
an opinion about the movie. It might be an unconscious decision, but it's 
human nature to form impressions about something before we've experienced 
it. Alright, enough with the shallow philosophical musings, and on to why I 
don't think <i>Hannibal</i> was much of a film. What surprised me about 
halfway through the proceedings was the absence of any real suspense. It 
became quite obvious what was going to happen to each character who appeared 
on screen, so when that character found himself in a desperate situation, 
the tension was killed. Of course, that wasn't the only thing that set the 
film back, but it's one of the larger problems to be found.</P>
<P>I might not have cared for <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, but it was hard 
to deny that the acting was superb. Anthony Hopkins went a long way in 
defining creepy in terms of movie serial killers; and Jodie Foster was an 
outstanding choice for a young, naive FBI agent. Things are a little 
different this time around. Hopkins is still fun to watch as Lecter, and 
it's obvious he's having a good time, but the character's menace is gone. In 
its place we get a few chuckles (pitch black though the humor may be), one 
or two startles, and a touch of gore. As for Julianne Moore, marvelous in 
some endeavors (<i>The Big Lebowski</i>), useless in others 
(<i>Magnolia</i>, not that that's her fault), she falls somewhere in the 
middle this time around. This isn't exactly her fault for two reasons: one, 
the character of Clarice Starling is woefully underwritten this time around 
(strange, since she was somehow overwritten last time); two, Julianne Moore 
may be a fairly talented actress, but she's no Jodie Foster, and 
comparisons, unfair or not, are going to be drawn. The only other actors 
with any screen time are the excellent Giancarlo Giannini (<i>A Walk in the 
Clouds</i>), who leaves quite an impression with a small role; and the 
sleepwalking Ray Liotta (<i>Goodfellas</i>), who is given a hideous role, 
and it's obvious he knows it. Tempted as I am to tell you who the actor 
playing Mason Verger is, I won't since his name isn't mentioned in the 
credits. Let's just say this actor does an outstanding job, as always.</P>
<P>What is it that made <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> work for so many 
people? Since I'm not a member of that group I can only venture a guess, but 
I'm willing to bet a lot of the film's appeal is due to the interaction 
between Lecter and Starling. People would sit there, fascinated at this game 
of cat and mouse; watching the brilliant Lecter at first toy with Starling 
from behind his glass prison, and then slowly begin to regard her as an 
equal. Obviously, I didn't find any of this too fascinating, but I can 
understand why many people did. These same people will probably be 
disappointed to find that this interaction between Lecter and Starling is 
absent from <i>Hannibal</i>. In fact, the two don't speak to each other till 
about halfway through the film. Otherwise the focus of the film is generally 
split between the vaguely interesting story of Pazzi's attempts to capture 
Lecter, and the exceedingly uninteresting story of Starling being hung out 
to dry by her colleagues. Unfortunately, the film's trailers pretty well 
give away what will happen in Pazzi's story, and Starling's story contains 
nothing even resembling tension. I wish I could say things improved once 
Starling and Lecter meet up, but their game of cat and mouse has been turned 
into a cutesy (if moderately disturbing) string of flirtations.</P>
<P>With a director like Ridley Scott behind the wheel, some things are bound to 
work. The shots of Italy and the cinematography in general by John Mathieson 
(<i>Gladiator</i>) are quite nice. Despite what you may have heard about 
this being the goriest film of all time, Scott shows remarkable restraint 
with the gore, and I can only think of three scenes which might really 
disturb audiences. Otherwise Scott wisely chooses to shoot what could be the 
goriest scenes in a hazy, obscured way so as not to turn too many stomachs. 
On the whole, Scott's direction is efficient and suitable to the film. He 
only gives in to Oliver Stone syndrome once or twice, jumping suddenly to 
slow motion, fast motion, or something similarly juvenile. He also makes 
excellent use of yet another brilliant score by Hans Zimmer 
(<i>Gladiator</i>, noticing a trend here?). Zimmer's score is low and 
remarkably creepy, perfectly highlighting the film's darkened mood. 
<i>Hannibal</i> runs a touch too long at 131 minutes. I'd recommend anyone 
who enjoyed the first film, and doesn't mind some stomach turning gore, see 
the film. Just don't go in with your expectations too high. I give the movie 
three out of five stars.</P>
