<PRE>Men In Black
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This irrelevant romp through a battle with goofy aliens is everything that
"Mars Attacks" promised last summer and failed to deliver: it's comical and
almost has a plot.</P>
<P>Back about the time of the Roswell landing -- or crash dummies in a weather
balloon, depending on which outlandish tale you chose to believe -- the "scum
of the universe" began moving to earth. Now there are 1500 disguised as humans
living mostly in New York City, although anyone who has spent time in the Big
Apple might have estimated a higher number. Think of it as "Casablanca without
the Nazis" as Special Agent K explains.</P>
<P>As with everything else in our brave new world, these offworlders need to be
kept track of and the public protected from itself. That task falls to the Men
In Black, members of an agency so secret that even the government doesn't know
about it. Agents K and J (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) are at the forefront
of immigration control. ("Jones" and "Smith": now those are names that aliens
might take.)</P>
<P>Disguised as humans (notably Newt Gingrich, Dennis Rodman and Sylvester
Stallone) they mostly live normal lives until a viscous insectoid illegal
alien arrives on an assassination mission. Mission completed, the bug goes on
a killing spree while the planet is in danger of destruction.</P>
<P>Director Barry Sonnenfeld ("Addams Family", "Get Shorty") has taken a little
known Malibu comic book and turned out a witty film filled with subtle jests
as well as the expected slapstick and outer space goo. The almost-overlooked
material is as comical as the longer more obvious scenes. J's delivery of the
tenacled baby and  K's shakedown of a reluctant dog are hilarious. So is the
notion that the supermarket tabloids are the only ones to print the truth and
the throwaway "Elvis isn't dead, he's gone home" line.</P>
<P>Jones' deadpan delivery is perfect for the blasé agent who's seen too much and
is training his new partner in the ways of the unexpected. (After shooting off
the head of a pawnshop owner who promptly grows it back and reveals a cache of
high-tech weapons hidden behind the jewelry, K asks his associate "Did you
notice anything strange?")</P>
<P>Smith, in his return to the science fiction battles after "Independence Day",
is the tall handsome leading man for the end of the century. If Eddie Murphy
were still making quality movies, he might have had this role. Since Murphy's
career fell apart a few years back due to some bad choices, Smith fills his
wise-cracking over the edge shoes admirably.</P>
<P>The supporting roles are filled with competent actors (Rip Torn, Linda
Fiorentino) but don't get much screen time. The exception is Vincent D'Onofrio
who plays the giant cockroach in ill-fitting redneck skin suit. As his face
constantly slips around and scrunches up in the corners, the bug doesn't quite
have the "walking around in human skin" gig down and steals every scene that
he's in.</P>
<P>There are a few problems. The buddy bit of this buddy film doesn't come
across, the film seems a bit short and some portions underdeveloped. But it's
an energetic comedy and the effects are impressive without burying the humans.
It's one of the few films of the genre that you won't regret seeing.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman as penned these words of wisdom for over 21 years and would
like to congratulate Chet Chmielewski and Jennifer St. Dennis on the birth of
their daughter Kathryn Claire who has nary a tentacle in sight. Electronic
