<P>     DRAGON is less a strict recounting of the life of Bruce Lee
(played by Jason Scott Lee--no relation) than it is a tribute to him.
Based on the book BRUCE LEE, THE MAN ONLY I KNEW by Linda Lee, this
film tells the story of an icon.  Since Bruce is regarded as a hero by
this picture, how much we actually get to learn about him is
uncertain.  At any rate, the film follows his life quickly through
childhood, then begins a more detailed account of events as Bruce heads
for America.  DRAGON ends shortly before the title character's death,
leaving one of the most talked-about aspect of his existence
unexplored.  Perhaps it's better that way.</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that, even more than Danny DeVito's HOFFA, this
picture was devised to show Bruce Lee in the most positive light
possible.  He is larger than life throughout the film, whether he is
fighting human foes or the demon that stalks his nightmares.  DRAGON
captures the energy and exuberance of Bruce Lee, but it fails to give
more than an incomplete picture of the man behind the personae.  In
that way, it is unlike HOFFA, CHAPLIN, or MALCOLM X, three other
recent, high-profile screen biographies that attempt to present a more
balanced portrait.</P>
<P>     The Kung Fu fights, well-choreographed and obviously overdone, are
executed in the same unforgettable way that similar scenes were done in
Lee's own movies.  In addition to being a homage to the late actor,
they're fun to watch, and add an element of action to what otherwise
would have been straight melodrama.</P>
<P>     Dramatically, there isn't a whole lot of substance to DRAGON.  It
isn't going to make anyone cry with its power of human insight.  There
are some nice scenes--especially those early in the relationship of
Bruce and Linda (Lauren Holly).  Also present is a subtle-but-forceful
point about racism in 1960s Hollywood (as Lee is refused the chance to
play the lead character in the series KUNG FU, which he helped
develop).</P>
<P>     Jason Scott Lee is a good choice to play Lee.  The physical
resemblance may not be perfect, but Jason matches Bruce for energy and
screen presence.  His acting is not superior--there are two scenes
(one in the hospital after Bruce is seriously injured in a fight and
another in Hong Kong when his wife tells him she's taking the children
back to America) that are horribly overacted--but Jason has charisma
and that covers for a great many faults.</P>
<P>     An eerie dimension has been added to this picture by the tragic
March death of Brandon Lee, Bruce's only son.  It shifts the focus of
Bruce's climactic battle with the demon, in which he fights to save not
himself, but his son.  An unexpected level of poignancy has been added
to this--and other--scenes by a cruel twist of fate that the producers
could not have foreseen.  The movie is dedicated to Brandon.</P>
<P>     DRAGON is a fun experience, but far from a great film, and those
expecting a probing examination of Bruce Lee's life are likely to be
disappointed.  Still, as a celebration of the first international
Chinese-American movie star, the movie keeps the audience interested
and entertained for its full running time, which is not an
insignificant feat.</P>
