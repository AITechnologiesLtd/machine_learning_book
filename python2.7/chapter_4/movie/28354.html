THE ROAD HOME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>THE ROAD HOME (WO DE FU QIN MU QIN), by acclaimed director Zhang Yimou 
(TO LIVE and SHANGHAI TRIAD), is an exceedingly modest love story that 
is saved by its gorgeous filming, haunting scoring and heartfelt acting.  
Although your mind may wander since so little happens, your eyes may 
tear up during some of the striking visuals.  The result is a 
disappointing film that's still worth seeing.</P>
<P>As the story begins, Yusheng Luo (Sun Honglei) has returned to his 
hometown, the small, remote village of Sanhetun in Northern China.  His 
father has died in another town, so his mother insists that, following 
an ancient tradition, they carry the body back to Sanhetun on foot 
rather than by car or tractor.  The snowy landscape of the present is 
filmed in stark black and white.  Most of the movie takes place in the 
past when Yusheng's father and mother first met.  This part is shot in 
radiant colors, which perfectly capture the rich yellows and golds of an 
autumn forest.</P>
<P>Yusheng's mother, Di Zhao, a petite young beauty, is played with a 
bright eyed spark by Zhang Ziyi.  You'll remember her from CROUCHING 
TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.  Di's husband, Changyu Luo (Zheng Hao), is a tall 
man with a big smile who has come from "the city," where he was 
unemployed, to be Sanhetun's only teacher.  </P>
<P>As soon as Di lays eyes on Changyu, she knows she has found her Mr. 
Right.  She is the certified "most beautiful maiden" in the village, 
since the woman so designated is chosen to make the red banner that will 
be placed on the ceiling in the new school house that the men will 
build.  The story explains how it was considered bad luck back then for 
women to take part in constructing buildings.  She tries to win his 
heart by making the most scrumptious of all of the dishes that the women 
prepare daily for the men raising the new school house.</P>
<P>The film's pervasive theme music, which repeats every few minutes, could 
become a sort of Chinese water torture if you didn't like it.  
Personally,  I didn't care how many dozen times it played, I couldn't 
get enough of it.  A week from now, I suspect that this tune will be the 
only part of the production that will prove memorable.</P>
<P>THE ROAD HOME runs 1:29.  The film is in Mandarin with English 
subtitles.  It is rated G since there is nothing to offend anyone of any 
age.  Kids less than 13, however, are not likely to find much to hold 
their interest.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 8, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera theaters.</P>
