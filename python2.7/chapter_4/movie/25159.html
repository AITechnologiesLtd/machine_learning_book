<PRE>ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly
Written by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly, Mike Cerrone</P>
<P>Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey back in comic form) is a member of the 
greatest police force in the US, the Rhode Island state police. He's got 
three children (Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, Jerod Mixon) who he loves 
with all his heart, even though they clearly aren't his (as one character 
says, they seem to have a year round tan); a wife who loved him till she ran 
off with a midget limo driver; and another personality named Hank. Charlie's 
life now consists of backing down from everything resembling a 
confrontation, or allowing Hank to take over and confront everything. His 
captain (a sadly underused Robert Forster) is giving him one last assignment 
before he may have to let Charlie go. Charlie's last assignment is to drive 
young Irene (Renee Zellweger) upstate to another precinct so she can settle 
a ticket her boss, Dickie (Danny Green), got while driving her car. After a 
short trip, the two arrive at the precinct and meet Lt. Gerke (Chris Cooper) 
and EPA Agent Boshane (Richard Jenkins). The two have questions for Irene 
about Dickie, and things get more than a little complicated from here.</P>
<P>I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey, even back when he was known as the 
white guy on "In Living Color". The man's an absolute master of physical 
comedy and over-the-top facial expressions, and he displays even more of 
this ability in "Me, Myself, and Irene". In fact, during those all too brief 
moments when Carrey is allowed to do his thing with complete abandon, the 
movie is absolutely hilarious. The problems are with the rest of its running 
time, filled with the Farrellys' trademark gross out jokes, which I have 
never cared for. For example, one scene showed a dog doing its business on 
Charlie's lawn while his neighbor watched. Half the audience exploded into 
laughter, while the other half (this was the half I was in) stared at the 
screen in silence - obviously missing the joke. Perhaps watching something 
like this is just too high-brow for me, and I'll always lack the 
intelligence to understand. The scenes I did find funny were ones where 
Carrey beat himself up far worse than what was done to him in "Liar, Liar" 
and one where Charlie and Hank argue about jumping over a bridge. These were 
the kinds of scenes that have made Carrey famous, and I wish the Farrellys 
had thought to include more of them.</P>
<P>"Me, Myself, and Irene" does boast a great supporting cast, but everyone in 
it is sadly underused. Robert Forster, who was terrific in "Jackie Brown", 
is given a total of about five minutes screen time. Chris Cooper, who turned 
in a stellar performance in "American Beauty" as the ex-marine father, is 
given one of the most useless characters in the film (and there are quite a 
few of them). Then we have Anthony Anderson, who is making quite a name for 
himself with hilarious performances in both "Romeo Must Die" and "Big 
Momma's House". Anderson is given one of the funniest parts, along with 
newcomers Brownlee and Mixon as the three beyond intelligent but also 
incredibly vulgar children of Charlie. I've heard the three might get there 
own movie, and I personally look forward to it. Last we have Renee Zellweger 
("Empire Records") as the only relatively normal person in a film full of 
crazies. Zellweger does an excellent job moving back and forth from being 
infuriated with Hank to crazy over Charlie and treating it like it makes 
perfect sense.</P>
<P>So, now that I've gotten through saying what wonderful performances were 
given by some of the cast members and how hilarious Carrey was, you're 
probably wondering why I rated the movie like I did. Well, there are two 
reasons besides the abundant use of gross-out gags. First, the plot is 
useless, cliched, boring, predictable, and a lot more complicated than it 
needed to be (that probably sounded like five reasons, didn't it?); Second, 
I hate movies that run past the point where they're welcome and "Me, Myself, 
and Irene" wears out its welcome with nearly a half hour to go. The movie 
runs a ridiculous 116 minutes, and it should have been only 90. There are 
actually three or four scenes that could be taken as climaxes when I promise 
one would have sufficed. There is one other redeeming quality thankfully, 
which is the nice, quiet soundtrack. It's full of older songs, which play 
softly in the background rather than covering up what the characters are 
saying (as seems to be the current trend). If you enjoyed "There's Something 
About Mary", there's a good chance you'll get a kick out of "Me, Myself, and 
Irene" since it does contain some of the same sexual humor. I'd recommend 
the movie to fans of the Farrellys and give it a slightly generous three out 
of five stars.</P>
