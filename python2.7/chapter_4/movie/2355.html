                                - Andrea Beaumont to Bruce Wayne</PRE>
<P>     BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM belongs on the small screen. Based on
TV's acclaimed "Batman: the Animated Series," this modestly intriguing
film is undercut by second-rate animation that was clearly intended for
television viewing only.</P>
<P>     The plot introduces Phantasm, a fog-shrouded phantom who's preying
on key figures in Gotham City's underworld.  Dressed in a billowing
black shroud, the villain has the police thinking that "The Bat" is
behind the crimes.  The crooks, fearing for their lives, contact the
Joker to contract the Batman.  Soon, fights erupt on both fronts as
Batman battles both Phantasm and the Joker.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, back at stately Wayne Manor, key subplots emerge which
include the reappearance of Bruce Wayne's one-time flame, Andrea
Beaumont, and, yes, the origin of the Caped Crusader....</P>
<P>     MASK OF THE PHANTASM proves that, in the case of cartoons, what
works on television doesn't always work in the movies.</P>
<P>     With the exception of a nifty computer-generated opening, the
animation in MASK OF THE PHANTASM is stiff and very awkward.  The
blending of foreground and background movement is lousy and there's far
two little detail hidden amid the simple but stylish backgrounds.  The
fight scenes are fluid and Gotham City looks the part, but that's about
it.</P>
<P>     The characters lack any expression, which makes watching any
non-action a virtual chore.  There's a load of lively dialogue in this
film--you just can't tell it from spying the speakers!  Only the
Joker, voiced by a surprisingly talented Mark Hamill, seems to get
around this problem.  With his grisly grin and gangly gait, he's the
only lively thing in the film.</P>
<PRE>     There are a few other problems to speak of.</PRE>
<P>     Plot holes frustrate as only comic-book creations can, a couple of
key settings are nearly indistinguishable from one another, and the
story relies way too heavily on flashback.</P>
<PRE>Zowie!</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line: BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM belongs on the small
             screen.  Only kids and comic-book fans are likely to
             to forgive the stiff animation and messy narrative.
             Let's hope that Joel Schumacher does a better job
             in 1995 with BATMAN 3.
