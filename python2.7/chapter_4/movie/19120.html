Starring Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu
Directed by Tom Tykwer
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>"The ball is round and the game lasts for 90 minutes, everything else is
theroy." A soccer ball is kicked up into the air, and it's what begins this
madcap, incredibly original tale of fast-paced running and love. Lola (Potente)
has 20 minutes to deliver the 100,000 marks that her boyfriend, Manni
(Bleibtreu) has left on the subway. If he does not deliver them to his gangster
boss on time, he will be killed. The movie plays out in three different ways
each of them are special in their own way.</P>
<P>One: Thinking of the people in her life that have a lot of money, Lola sprints
to her father's bank and interrupts a private meeting there.</P>
<P>Two: Lola attemps to rob the bank (definately the best of the three) to get her
money.</P>
<P>Three: Lola tries her luck at the casino.</P>
<P>The best parts of the movie come in fast photos of the people she passes by on
the street. For instance, after banging into a women walking with a stroller
the screen lights up in flashes that show her stealing the child from the real
parents. Other flashes into the future include love between two bank workers, a
lotto winner, and an unfortunate thief. One and Two are followed with great
scenes filmed at an odd angle in red light that show Lola and Manni in bed
together talking about the outcome of what happened in that particular
20-minute rush. The film also gets my award for the best soundtrack so far this
year. It has plenty of cool techno beats that the Go soundtrack needed. What
chances does this soon-to-be art-house fave have at the Best Foreign Film
Oscar? Not much, but it's still enough to make Run Lola Run the best Foreign
film (and perhaps independent film) so far this year.</P>
