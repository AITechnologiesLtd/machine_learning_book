<P>Review: Well, The Matrix has to be one of the most difficult reviews I've ever
had the pleasure of writing. I say "difficult", because it's an incredibly
difficult movie to critique without giving away too much of the plot. Like so
many movies which have intricate, weaving plotlines, a lot of the fun is
watching the twists and turns unfold. As such, I will not go into a long
explanation of what The Matrix is about, but will instead talk about some of
the hits and misses for this film.</P>
<P>First and foremost, I expected a lot from this film. I should say out front,
though, that the filmmakers' previous effort, Bound, did not impress me at
all. I thought it was pretty standard fare, and suffered from a plot line
which dragged intensely at some points. Still, though, there was certainly a
dramatic flair, and a touch for those things odd. This is what excited me
about The Matrix, I didn't expect it to be standard fare, and I was right.</P>
<P>The Matrix is a movie that almost everyone can enjoy. I've heard some older
critics complain that the soundtrack is too loud, but I found it fit the look
and feel of the movie perfectly. This movie has the same art director as Dark
City, and it shows. It also shares more than a few plot elements with Dark
City, but goes places Dark City should've gone. The Matrix owes a lot to Dark
City and Terminator, but in most ways expands upon the ideas presented in
those films. I would have to say that The Matrix is much better than Dark
City, and (here is a huge compliment) as good as The Terminator. This movie
will be a science-fiction/action film classic.</P>
<P>First the pros: The art direction, set design and special effects are
outstanding. As is Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith
and Joe Pantoliano as Cypher. The action sequences are incredibly well
filmed, and the movie clips along at an incredible pace. Warner Brothers gets
bonus points for not giving away the whole freakin' movie in the trailer.
Most of the "COOL!" shots in the trailer take place in the first three to
five minutes of the film (!), there's a LOT more here than the trailer shows.
The plot line is beautifully intricate, and keeps you guessing at various
points in the movie. It has a tendency to go left when you expect to go
right, except when you start to expect it to go left, then it goes right.
Great stuff!</P>
<P>The cons: Keanu Reeves is (as usual), quite wooden. I can't offer a better
casting suggestion, because quite frankly, his "look" is perfect for this
film. Still, though, I think any director using Reeves in future projects
would be wise to avoid having his character use the phrases "NO WAY!" or
"WHOA!". Flashbacks to Bill and Ted are inevitable at points. Surprisingly, I
found Laurence Fishburne to be somewhat wooden at the beginning of his
performance. He seemed to get more into it as the movie progressed, but I
have come to expect more of him. Also, there is a series of three
rear-projection shots used in the film which look absolutely terrible. You'll
know the shots I refer to when you see them. I suspect this wasn't re-shot
because of the relatively small budget for a film of this type($63-68
million). Last, and definitely least, I found the sound mix to be a little
underwhelming. The theatre I saw the movie in was Dolby Digital equipped, and
I found the directional effects limited and the low frequency range muted. It
wasn't terrible, it just seemed like it wasn't "enough". The next time I see
this movie (and I will be seeing it again, probably later this weekend), we
plan on going to The Coliseum here in town. The cinema it is playing in at
the Coliseum is THX certified, and if my opinion of the sound mix changes I
will let you know. <NOTE:  I went to see the film again, this time in a THX
certified theatre.  The sound mix was significantly better, but still nothing
fantastic.></P>
<P>That's it! It doesn't tell you much, I know, but I don't want to go into
specifics for fear of spoiling the movie. All I can really say is "go see it."
You won't be disappointed. This movie kicks some serious ass, and is the best
action film I've seen in a long time. It has a complex, but still coherent
plot, and relatively few plot holes considering the gaping possibilities that
were opened. Great stuff, and I hope the rest of 1999 is this good!</P>
<PRE>Go see it. Period.</PRE>
