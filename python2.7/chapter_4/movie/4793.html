<PRE>                                 THE BIRDCAGE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's a rare event when a remake of a film rivals the greatness of the
original.  THE BIRDCAGE, based fairly closely on LA CAGE AUX FOLLES,
achieves just that, memorably updating the earlier film's script with
modern humor and a distinctly American setting.</P>
<P>     The story has been done a thousand times, but LA CAGE AUX FOLLES was
one of the originals.  Armand Goldman (Robin Williams) is an openly gay
drag club owner in South Beach, Florida.  Albert (Nathan Lane, best known
as the voice of the weasel in THE LION KING), aka Starina, is Armand's
feature performer...and his "wife."  When Armand's son-via-one-night-stand
Val announces his impending marriage to Barbara (a dead ringer for Audrey
Hepburn), Armand freaks.  When Barbara's arch-conservative parents (Gene
Hackman and Dianne Wiest) drop by for a visit, it gets even worse.</P>
<P>     The most choice parts of the story involve Albert's attempt at
transforming his very non-butch persona into a faux "man," from his John
Wayne swagger to his mustard-spreading technique.  In the process, Lane
manages to do what has heretofore been impossible:  to upstage Robin
Williams, who plays a distant second (or even third) fiddle to his
costars.  The potential second is an almost unrecognizable Hank Azaria as
the couple's unbearably hilarious Guatemalan house boy.</P>
<P>     Of course, bits and pieces are lacking in THE BIRDCAGE, most notably
stuck-on subplots involving Val's real mother (Christine Baranski) and the
tabloids coming after the gang, but on the whole the film is a hilarious
modernization of its acclaimed predecessor.</P>
<P>     And while THE BIRDCAGE isn't really what I'd call insulting to any
particular group, don't expect any political correctness awards to be
handed out for the film.  Instead, just expect to hear a whole lot of
light-hearted laughter.</P>
