<P>Pi is the name of a mathematical term used primarily in determining the
area or circumference of a circle.   As well as I can remember from my
high school Math class, Pi = 3.1416__and on and on.</P>
<P>In the movie, Pi, Max Cohen spends much of his life carefully locked in
his small apartment, surrounded by computers and other electronic gadgets.
 He is trying to find some unknown mathematical equation.  Coming into his
life is a former teacher, and a group of Hebrew men on a religious search
for a missing 216 digit "word".</P>
<P>The film is in black and white, and it jumps from scene to scene with no
rhyme or reason.  At one point I felt that I was watching "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy"  without the humor!  I couldn't tell if Max ever
solved his mathematical problem, but I know that I didn't figure anything
out.  It's still a big puzzle.</P>
<P>No, I don't ever want to see this again, not even on late night
television.  The very best I can give it is a D.</P>
