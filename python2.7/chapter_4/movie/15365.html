<P>There's a way of bringing romance to the screen without tipping your
hand. Successfully, a romantic picture will have finesse rather than
power, and style rather than substance. It will also have a chemistry
between lead roles that is thick and palpable -- nobody wants to watch a
pair of deadbeats fall in love. The script will be skillfully drawn out,
with devotion to both realism and fantasy, and it will have at least one
important thematic element to deliver. This definition is just as well
the description of Martin Brest's latest film, MEET JOE BLACK, an
inspiring drama about life and death and the love that falls within. </P>
<P>Director Brest made the original BEVERLY HILLS COP, but hasn't directed
a feature since 1992's SCENT OF A WOMAN.  He makes a fine return here in
masterfully helming a picture that runs nearly three hours in length -
never an easy task. The script he's given to work with isn't fantastic
in terms of extensibility, for it does not spread itself out over the
three hours. There are moments when it proceeds at an interminable pace,
making sixty-second conversations into five- or ten-minute affairs.
Brest takes advantage of the script's shortcomings, however, by styling
the movie around them -- and thus MEET JOE BLACK ends up having a
thoughtful air about it. The audience definitely ponders the same
questions that the characters do. </P>
<P>The cast does their best to highlight the plot, and the names involved
are certainly worthy of note. Anthony Hopkins has the main character but
in an interesting shift of dynamic, he's relegated to a supporting role
as Brad Pitt takes center stage. Pitt plays Death, in the body of Joe
Black, a young man killed in a car crash at the movie's open. And so
Death visits successful communications exec Bill Parrish (Hopkins) to
let him know that his time is up -- but before they travel to the next
world, Death wants Parrish to show him around Earth a bit. And so
Death's vacation becomes a life experience as he learns what the human
way is like; the crux of the trip, however, is the love that begins to
grow between Death and Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). So
when Bill's time is up, it becomes a pivotal point in time for all three
characters. </P>
<P>The acting corps does a fine job all around. Hopkins is the highlight,
delivering many spectacular lines in fine form (although he does wax a
bit poetic too early on). He lends a sense of robust energy to his
character that sharply contrasts the appropriate lack of emotion in
Pitt's Death. But the grounding factor in the movie is Claire Forlani,
who gives an excellent turn as the daughter of one character and the
love interest of another. She lends a passive sensuality to the movie
that strengthens the romance as well as the life story of Bill Parrish,
and the movie is certainly greater because of her. The other supports
are in fine form as well, from Jake Weber's bad guy to Jeffrey Tambor's
comic relief. All in all this becomes a very inspiring and thoughtful
movie to watch, and it's questionable only for its three-hour length.
Compared to other films of such length, like the recent BELOVED, MEET
JOE BLACK is definitely worth the price of the ticket.</P>
