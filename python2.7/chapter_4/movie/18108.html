<P>Andrei Rublev (1969, Andrei Tarkovsky)</P>
<P>A retrospective review by David M. Arnold</P>
<P>Andrei Tarkovsky might very well have been the most gifted filmmaker in the
short 100-year history of the medium.  Tarkovsky is the other of the two
Soviet filmmakers apt to be familiar to American film dilletantes (the first
being Sergei Eisenstein).  With "Andrei Rublev", Tarkovsky elevates
filmmaking to an Art that requires as much intellectual investment on the
part of the observer as does the poetry of T.S. Eliot or the novels of James
Joyce.        And, he produced the this, as well as the bulk of his film output, in
the Soviet Union during the late '60's and '70's under a political regime
that, although not the most repressive, was still notorious for suppression
of creative art. The greatest irony is that "Andrei Rublev", a decidedly
uncommercial film made on an epic scale, could ONLY have been produced by a
subsidized film industry within a centrally controlled economy not driven by
the profit motive. It could not have been made in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Andrei Rublev was a Russian historic figure who flourished during the end of
the 14th century.  Rublev was the most important medieval Russian painter of
religious icons and frescos.  He is considered the father of the first native
Russian style of iconography.  Tarkovsky uses Rublev as the central figure in
his long, meditative reflection on the the meanings of Life, Faith and Art.</P>
<P>The film has no real plot and no protagonist:  Rublev (played by Anatoli
Solonitsyn, who portrayed Dr. Sartorius in Tarkovsky's brilliant sci-fi film,
"Solaris") is more an observer than a participant.  The first scene in the
film is a prologue featuring an improbable event.  A group of peasants
construct a crude hot air balloon and one of them takes flight in it.  We see
the earth from the balloonist's perspective, until the balloon ruptures and
crashes, killing its passenger.  Then, the film unfolds as a series of
vignettes representing historic events in Rublev's lifetime.  He is a monk. 
He meets Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), the renown Byzantine
iconographer and becomes his pupil.  He is commissioned to paint the
Cathedral in Vladimir. He encounters a summer solstice worshipping group of
pagans and witnesses their persecution.  He has just completed the cathedral
in Vladimir when the town is viciously sacked by the Tatars.  His entourage
of assistants and helpers is scattered.  He endures famine.  He grapples with
his conscience, and for a time renounces painting and speaking.  He is
finally reconciled to his responsibility to his art as the custodian of a
God-given talent. At this point, the film shifts from black and white into
full color and we are presented with an epilogue of photographs of Rublev's
actual art.</P>
<P>"Andrei Rublev" is very realistic and frank about the value placed on life in
Russia during the middle ages.        We see inhumanity in the form of arrogant
noblemen and the Tatar invaders.  We see men being tortured and we see
brutality to animals.  There were several scenes that made me wince; I
especially dislike seeing animals being mistreated, whether or not through
the use of special effects (I suspect in some cases these were not effects). 
Tarkovsky was explicit in portraying this evil to underscore Rublev's
internal struggle.</P>
<P>The lack of a definite story arc and the brutal scenes of peasant life mean
that this film is not for everyone.  It is certainly not idle entertainment,
Tarkovsky expects the observer to be an active participant.  He provides a
series of images and leaves it to the viewer to tie it all together, and a
complete understanding of the film requires multiple viewings.        The film is
recommended for Tarkovsky's brilliant cinematic technique, for his long,
complex and lyrical tracking shots.  Like Steven Spielberg, Tarkovsky is not
encumbered by a sense of the Proscenium Arch.  His shots put you right in the
middle of the action.</P>
<P>Production on "Andrei Rublev" started in 1966, and the film was re-cut in
1969.  The Soviet authorities didn't quite know what to make of such a
personal and spiritual work, so it sat on the shelf until its premier in
1971.  "Andrei Rublev" is available in its original, uncut form on DVD from
the Criterion Collection.</P>
