<P>Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:</P>
<PRE>RUSH HOUR</PRE>
<P>So what's the problem with 48 Hours clones these days?  They always try
for the same thing that Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte had.  That was the
problem that plagued these clones, not to mention the actual sequel:
Another 48 Hours, a complete waste of film.  But, at last, someone has a
different take on the matter, and it's director Brett Rainer.</P>
<P>Rush Hour features Jackie Chan in his first U.S. action movie, playing a
Chinese detective who's being flown to the US to investigate the
kidnapping of the Chinese Consulate's daughter.  Of course, the FBI is
upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation, and stick him
with an LAPD office with a big mouth- of course, that's Chris Tucker.</P>
<P>What makes Rush Hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the
energetic Chan and the absolutely hilarious Tucker.  Tucker mouths off
to Chan at every given opportunity ("I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito."),
and Chan delivers a few zingers of his own, as well as some terrific
fight scenes.  The story's pretty much your average fare, but with a
decent twist involving the main villain, a highly clouded figure named
Jun Tao.</P>
<P>At least it's entertaining, and the concept is excellently realized.  A
particular fight scene in a Chinese office, where Chan and Tucker duke
it out with the bad guys, is funny and energetic at the same time.  And
the finale's a real treat as well...Chan delivers yet another fantastic
stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop.</P>
<P>Rush Hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night
of the week.  Just make sure you don't look for anything culturally
different and you'll be fine- Drunken Master II this ain't.</P>
<PRE>RATING: 9 (out of 10)</PRE>
