<PRE>                         IN THE COMPANY OF MEN
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Chad and Howard are a couple of suits from the head office of some
nameless corporation.  They've been sent on a six-week business trip to
a branch office so, as guys will, ever cocky Chad proposes a game to
pass the time.  Afterall, "Life is for the taking, is it not?" reasons
Chad.  Although somewhat reluctant, Howard welcomes the idea of some
excitement so he agrees to go along.</P>
<P>     As the harmless looking trailers for IN THE COMPANY OF MEN argue,
this film has no sex, no special effects, and no monsters, only
conversation -- so how scary can that be?  In the press kit, first-time
writer and director Neil LaBute describes the movie thus, "It's a
simple story: boys meet girl, boys crush girl, boys giggle."</P>
<P>     Like its female counterpart, THE LAST SEDUCTION, the strength of
IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is that it never pulls its punches.  Movie goers
used to Hollywood endings, where bad guys eventually get their due, may
find IN THE COMPANY OF MEN disquieting, but there will be few
complaints about the quality of the presentation.  The acting is
superlative, and the imaginative script has minimalist cadence a la
David Mamet.  The result is at once devastating and compelling.</P>
<P>     Bitter white collar workers, Chad and Howard, are indignant about
being passed over for promotions and paranoid about the future.  Their
anger extends to the women in their lives, both of the men having
recently been jilted.  Chad proposes a scheme whereby they will find an
especially vulnerable woman and both of them will romance her.  The
coup de grace?  "One day out goes the rug with us pulling it hard, and
Jill comes tumbling after."  They will string her along for the full
six weeks before administering the final blow.</P>
<P>     Aaron Eckhart plays Chad with macho evil and is one of the best
screen villains in a long time.  His hearty laughter and charming smile
glosses over a malevolent nature always lying just below the surface.
"Never lose control, that's the key," he advises Howard.  And Chad is
someone who follows his own advice.</P>
<P>     Howard, as the pseudo-innocent who always bows to peer pressure,
is played by Matt Malloy.  Whereas Eckhart gives his character an
alluring likeableness, Malloy makes his such a wimp that his is the
easier of the two to despise.  Chad masks his devilish behavior with a
beguiling nature, but Howard has no such mask.  The audience, although
not the female victim, can always see through the more transparent
Howard.  When presented with "the game," Howard goes along even though
he admits, "it's way out there."  Howard is as unsure as Chad is
super-confident, but Howard is quite willing to hurt others to go along
with his buddy.</P>
<P>     The object of their cruelty is a sweet, deaf woman named
Christine, who is a lightning-fast typist and temporary clerical worker
in the branch office.  Beautiful and svelte Stacy Edwards plays
Christine as a big hearted, but shy and unsure woman.  Christine has
not dated in quite a while and worries that men no longer find her
attractive or interesting.  While smooth talking her, Chad ridicules
her behind her back.  He says her voice sounds like Flipper and claims,
incorrectly, that she slobbers when she tries to talk.</P>
<P>     To press the point that Chad's maliciousness extends to more than
women, LaBute includes scenes of Chad disparaging his male coworkers as
well.  In language most foul, he goes through a picture book of the
company's employees telling a room full of men what he thinks of some
of them not present.  In private he humiliates a black intern so
completely that you are sure than the scene will cut before he strips
the intern of his self-respect, but as in the rest of the story, Chad
never pulls back.</P>
<P>     The director has the good sense not to make all of the classic
mistakes of most first-timers.  He does not try to pack the film with
all of his ideas.  And thankfully, he avoids shaky handheld cameras and
cute angles.  Filmed by first-time cinematographer Tony Hettinger
almost totally in the office with the actors' faces lit by the glow of
desk lamps, the audience's attention is riveted to the screen without
needless distractions.  Editor Joel Plotch follows the director's
minimalist style so that the focus stays on the characters and their
conversations.</P>
<P>     Chad's depravity knows no bounds, but as the weeks pass, the
scheme must unravel.  The question is how.  Suffice it to say that the
intelligent dialog and engrossing story continue to the very last
minute.</P>
<P>     Studies of evil are by very their nature controversial, but this
is a film that demands to be seen.  And with three such wonderful
performances, it is a film well worth going out of your way to find.</P>
<P>     IN THE COMPANY OF MEN runs a fast 1:33.  It is rated R for mature
themes and some profanity.  The show would be acceptable for teenagers
if they are mature.  For adults, I strongly recommend the picture and
give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
