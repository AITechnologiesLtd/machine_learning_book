<PRE>                           THE SANTA CLAUSE (1994)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "Not too hot.  Extra chocolate.  Shaken, not stirred," is how
Santa likes his favorite drink.  This is one of the details we learn in
the expanded Santa legend known as THE SANTA CLAUSE.</P>
<P>     Released by Walt Disney in time for Christmas in 1994, THE SANTA
CLAUSE covers much of the same ground as the MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET
films.  In both plots there is a man who claims to be St. Nick, but who
is not believed except by some of the children.  Although not as good
as the others, THE SANTA CLAUSE is a charming little picture in its own
right.</P>
<P>     As is a popular theme in Hollywood, the parents in the story are
divorced.  The ex's are fighting over the proper treatment of the
existence of Santa Claus.  The dad, Scott Calvin, notice the initials,
is played by Tim Allen, who was the voice of Buzz Lightyear in TOY
STORY.  The mom, Laura, is acted by Wendy Crewson, who was the blind
date Kevin Danford in TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY.  Their son,
Charlie, is done by Eric Lloyd, who was Kyle in DUNSTON CHECKS IN.</P>
<P>     After a disastrous Christmas Eve with his Dad, where his Dad has
to use the fire extinguisher on their flaming dinner, Charlie is awaken
that night by a noise.  Santa has fallen off their roof and died.
Scott wants to know who this dead kook is in their front yard.</P>
<P>     Scott pulls a card out of Santa's coat that has a "clause" that
says to put on the jacket and the reindeer will know what to do.  Scott
does this, and the next thing they know, Scott and Charlie are flying
through town finishing up the gift giving.  This is all done in a
spirit of fun and high adventure.  My son's eyes were glowing watching
it all.</P>
<P>     When they finally get to the North Pole, lead elf Bernard (David
Krumholtz) wants to know what happened to the old Santa.  Scott
explains, "The other guy fell.  It was an accident.  I've got good home
owner's insurance."</P>
<P>     All the elves are children, which provides a special bond with the
young viewers of the movie.  Later, Charlie's teacher, however, will
correct him with, "We don't say elves.  We say little people."</P>
<P>     The elves are all precious.  Best is a sweet one named Judy (Paige
Tamada).  She has an infectious smile.  Just looking at her makes you
happy for inexplicable reasons.  My favorite line of hers is when she
explains to Scott, "Seeing isn't believing.  Believing is seeing."  A
better summary of the spirit of Santa Claus, I have not heard.</P>
<P>     The bright and humorous script is by half of the four writers from
SPACE JAM, Leonardo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick.  When Scott worries
about the return trip, he asks, "Can we take a direct flight back to
reality or do we have to change places in Denver?"</P>
<P>     When Scott does get back to reality, his body starts changing.  He
puts on 45 pounds in a week, and his beard turns white and grows at a
prodigious rate.  His boss, Mr. Whittle (Peter Boyle), suggests, "You
should see a doctor, a shrink, a dietitian, anything."</P>
<P>     His "fantasies" that he is Santa Claus get him in big trouble
south of the North Pole.  After the inevitable capture by the
authorities, his elves send out a flying squad, elf commandos if you
will, to save the chief.  In my son's favorite piece of dialog, the
head of the liberation forces tells his boss's jailer, "We're your
worst nightmare.  Elves with attitude."</P>
<P>     There is a potential problem for this as a family show, and it is
the duality of the belief about Santa Claus.  Children will have
certain assumptions about Santa, and this film could be viewed as
presenting another set of possibilities.  We worried about this a bit,
but decided to let our son see it anyway.  He was able to take the film
as fiction without causing him to reexamine his theories about Jolly
Olde St. Nick.  Whether this could prove troubling to other and
especially to younger kids remains problematic.</P>
<P>     The two leads, Tim Allen and Eric Lloyd, give solid performances,
and John Pasquin directs with careful precision.  THE SANTA CLAUSE is a
pleasant little fable.  A good choice to kick back and enjoy during the
holiday season.</P>
<P>     THE SANTA CLAUSE runs a fast 1:37.  It is rated PG for reasons
that escape me.  There is no sex, nudity, violence or bad language.
Yes, someone dies, but that happens too in many kid's movies from THE
WIZARD OF OZ to BAMBI.  Perhaps death is enough to get a PG, but except
for the Santa legend already discussed, the film is fine for kids of
all ages.  Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, said that the movie was "really good.  I
loved it!"  He kept rewinding the tape to see his favorite scenes again
and again.  I recommend this family fare to you and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
