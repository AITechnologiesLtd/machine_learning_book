                A film review by Ivana Redwine

Moore, Joss Ackland, Peter Eyre, Jeanne Lapotaire, Diane 
Venora, Joan Plowright. Directed by James Ivory. Screenplay

Destroyer" by Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington. Running 
time: two hours, three minutes. MPAA rating: R.</P>
<P>WARNING: This review contains spoilers!</P>
<P>Although SURVIVING PICASSO is a good-looking, easy-to-
watch film, I found it to be more like a good cable-TV docudrama 
than the big screen character study I was hoping for. It seemed 
more concerned with lovingly recapturing the details of period 
costume and setting than probing the depths of the 
characters' psyches. It even goes so far as to recreate the look 
of old photographs of the characters from the popular 
magazines of the day. In addition, the actresses seem to have 
been picked more for their physical resemblance to the people 
they are playing than for their acting ability.</P>
<P>I think that the script is the film's weakest point. Rarely 
lingering long enough on any one scene to explore anything in 
depth, the choppy and heavy-handed script relies on an 
intrusive voice-over narration to keep the story from falling 
into chaos.</P>
<P>I expect a lot from Merchant-Ivory, and in some ways this film 
does deliver. It has high production values, wonderful settings, 
and a fine performance by Anthony Hopkins that almost 
overcomes the script. But the film lacks the sensitivity and 
complexity that I have come to expect from Merchant-Ivory. 
However, I base my expectations on their earlier films adapted 
from literary fiction, while the credits for SURVIVING PICASSO 
claim that it was adapted from "Picasso: Creator and 
Destroyer" a best-selling biography by Arianna 
Stassinopoulos Huffington.</P>
<P>SURVIVING PICASSO is actually a Merchant-Ivory-Wolper 
production, and so it is not surprising that it has that big-
budget biopic feeling. I think that fans of Merchant-Ivory will be 
disappointed that the main characters, Francoise Gilot 
(played by Natascha McElhone) and Pablo Picasso (Anthony 
Hopkins), have been dumbed down to comic-book level. The 
performance of Hopkins is strong enough to give the character 
of Picasso some resonance. However, McElhone's portrayal of 
Gilot consists mainly of projecting an aura of sad grace and 
giving a resigned smile once in a while. It could have been that 
McElhone needed better direction or that the material she was 
given to work with was simply intractable. In this connection it 
should be mentioned that even though Gilot is the point-of-
view character, she is delineated even more sketchily than 
Picasso. </P>
<P>The movie focuses on the period from about 1943 to the early 
1950s when Picasso shared his life with Gilot; it also takes 
brief excursions into his romantic relationships with other 
women. However, instead of fully developed characters like 
those in HOWARD'S END and A ROOM WITH A VIEW, I never 
gained much insight into any of the characters in SURVIVING 
PICASSO, including Picasso and Gilot. Also, I didn't perceive 
any chemistry between Hopkins and McElhone, which made 
their whole relationship seem not quite believable.</P>
<P>When I heard that Merchant-Ivory was making a film on 
Picasso and Gilot, I was excited, recognizing the rich dramatic 
and emotional potential a story about these two people has. I 
was disappointed to see that Merchant-Ivory opted instead to 
present these dynamic people as one-dimensional 
stereotypes. Picasso's artistic oeuvre shows him to be a multi-
dimensional man whose emotions ran the full spectrum, 
ranging from the tenderness and serenity of his Rose Period 
to the chaos and violence shown in his portraits of weeping 
women. Instead, in SURVIVING PICASSO we are presented 
with an overemphasis on only one facet of Picasso--he was an 
"enfant terrible" who saw it as his privilege as an artistic genius 
to selfishly use people in general and women in particular. </P>
<P>I am starting to re-read Gilot's memoir "Life with Picasso." 
>From it I can gather that she was more complex than the 
woman portrayed in SURVIVING PICASSO and her 
relationship with Picasso had more nuances than this film 
even hints at. In the film, Gilot is presented as little more than 
a long-suffering angel who eventually awakens to what a cad 
her man is.</P>
<P>There are good scenes in the movie, but their strength is often 
undercut by the overall heavy-handedness. For example, there 
is a scene where Picasso shows pictures to his dealer, 
including work on what critics now call his Weeping Women 
Series. (Although the paintings used in the film are not actual 
Picassos, they are close enough to be effective.) The scene is 
used to reinforce the unrelenting theme of the film--Picasso's 
self-absorption eventually turned all the women he loved into 
the living, breathing equivalents of his portraits. The scene 
isn't bad in and of itself, but the point it makes is made too 
many times and in too many ways in the film, and it is made at 
the expense of creating fully-faceted characters.</P>
<P>Another strong, yet heavy-handed, scene also illustrates 
Picasso's "enfant-terrible" persona. Picasso forces Gilot to 
watch as a bird of prey swoops out of the sky, takes a scrawny 
cat in its talons, and carries it away to its death. I found this to 
be a powerful visual metaphor that draws parallels between the 
predatory bird and Picasso, the predatory man. Again, the 
scene taken by itself is good, but in the context of the rest of 
the film, it becomes trite because it is yet another didactic 
episode.</P>
<P>There are some films that merely entertain, while others go 
beyond that and take us to a deeper understanding of the 
human heart. This film doesn't get beyond the point of mere 
entertainment, and while there is nothing wrong with 
entertainment, I was hoping for something more given 
Merchant-Ivory's reputation and the rich subject of Picasso 
and Gilot. I think this movie is worth seeing, but I wouldn't 
blame anyone for preferring to wait for it to come out on 
videotape.</P>
