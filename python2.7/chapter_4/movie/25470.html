<P>You don't send a boy to do a man's job. Roland Emmerich -- the director of 
such dreadful action films as "Independence Day", and the recent "Godzilla" 
remake -- should not have been assigned an epic about the American 
Revolutionary War. It's nonetheless unsurprising that my opening maxim never 
occurred to anyone involved with "The Patriot". After all, they did approve a 
script in which two small boys are given guns and told to shoot at British 
people in the woods.</P>
<P>The tots are about ten years old, or maybe a little younger. The film's hero, 
played by Mel Gibson, is a widower whose farm is unjustly attacked by 
'Redcoats' (the nickname for the Brits); he's also the one who supplied the 
kids with their weapons, and ordered them to commit murder. After their 
shooting spree, when Gibson is tucking the lads into bed, one of them reports 
"I'm glad I've killed, pop!"</P>
<P>America -- although a film as blindly patriotic as this would never admit it 
-- already has enough gun-crazed maniacs. Their defence for bearing arms is 
that 1) the constitution allows it, and 2) they need to do so for home 
protection. With scenes like the one above, "The Patriot" serves as an 
incitement of those freaks, and also of the pathetic flag-wavers who wear 
stars-and-stripes shorts at street parades and recite "We really do live in 
the land of the free and the home of the brave!" as if paraphrasing a line 
from one's national anthem is the same thing as seriously examining one's 
country.</P>
<P>"The Patriot" is being advertised as the Revolutionary War equivalent of 
Gibson's great Scottish epic "Braveheart", but it's nowhere near as 
entertaining, and does a much more methodical job of demonising the British 
while glamorising a revolt. The narrative essentially consists of Gibson and 
a small band of merry men wandering around the country discussing "the 
cause"; although now and again Gibson meets up with his family, or there will 
be another attack from those horrid Recoats. Of course there is a token black 
character among Gibson's troupe, who gets some racist comments at first, but 
then apologies, so none of the Americans come off looking evil.</P>
<P>When the level of the storytelling becomes apparent, we hold out hope that we 
can at least expect some spectacular sequences of dumb action. But there is 
hardly any fighting until the climax, when comes a highly implausible battle 
scene, with Gibson running through the bloody lines unharmed, carrying the 
American flag. Then he thrusts it into the ground and has a ridiculous clash 
with a British officer (Jason Isaacs), where each man wields two swords in 
each hand, and juts them at each other in time to swashbuckler music chords. 
To picture this, recall the Jim Carrey comedy "Cable Guy", with its parody of 
the famous "Star Trek" fight.</P>
<P>Gibson opens every scene with a flustered, confused expression and then turns 
it into a frown. It's like "Braveheart" going senile but sporadically 
returning to his old self. The dialogue that he and all the other actors have 
to speak varies from horribly stilted ("Men! Richly fight for the cause about 
which you spake!"; "Father... this yonder boy be two years younger than I!") 
to nonsensical ("I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles") to 
lazy and pedestrian ("Daddy, daddy, come back!"). And there are scenes of 
ineptitude, such as when Gibson's platoon creep up behind a British ship, and 
then Emmerich cuts to a wide shot to show the boat blow up. How the hell did 
that happen? Did they throw a hand grenade? Where did they find one of those, 
being in the 1770s an' all?</P>
<P>Like "U-571", another dreadful recent war movie, "The Patriot" has drawn fire 
for its reworking of history. The real-life figure Gibson's character is 
based on was known for shooting civilians for sport, and raping his slaves 
(in the film, he doesn't even keep slaves; the Negroes working his land are 
free men). And William Tavington, the English colonel who the screenplay pits 
him against, did not murder children or use any unorthodox tactics. Even if 
you don't care about the facts, "The Patriot" is incompetent and 
disappointing. I dragged a buddy to the screening with me, and felt compelled 
to apologise both during and after. I think I'll ring him again right now.</P>
