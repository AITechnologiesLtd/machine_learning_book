<P>     On one hand, THE NEW AGE takes a blistering look at a section of
modern American society--the materialists who, in the process of
amassing their possessions, lose track of morality.  This is material
worthy of the writer of THE PLAYER.  On the other hand, the film takes
a murky and uncertain plunge into the diverse worlds of spirituality,
and emerges bankrupt.  This is too reminiscent of the efforts of the
writer/director of a tedious movie called THE RAPTURE.</P>
<P>     Both people are the same man:  Michael Tolkin.  He's at both his
best and worst in THE NEW AGE, a film that's scathing as a satire but
soulless as a drama.  One of Tolkin's intentions may have been to make
a spritual statement, but it's never clear exactly what he wants to
say.  There's a lot of mystical mumbo-jumbo, but it never does much
more than eat up screen time.  In the end, it all amounts to a lot of
pointless words.</P>
<P>     The possession-oriented couple at the center of the story are
Peter (Peter Weller) and Katherine (Judy Davis).  Their life together
is crumbling due to infidelity and fiscal problems, so they embark upon
a radical dual solution: open up the marriage (e.g., start sleeping
with other partners) and start a chic clothing store where belts go for
$400.  One is supposed to help their emotional isolation; the other is
designed to reverse a negative cash flow.  Unfortunately, neither
really works.</P>
<P>     Because of the basic nature of the two lead characters, it's
difficult to find much sympathy for them.  They're the kind of
loathesome, self-absorbed yuppies that are so disliked by everyone
outside of that social circle.  The inability of the audience to
identify with Peter and Katherine gives the satire its bite, but at the
price of the drama.  Unfortunately, Tolkin affords the two sides of his
film equal attention, and the failure of one hamstrings the entire
production.</P>
<P>     THE NEW AGE is gifted with a spate of talented actors giving good
performances.  Despite a terrible hairdo, too much lipstick, and a
pasty-white complexion, Judy Davis is fabulous.  Peter Weller, no
longer stuck behind the Robocop suit, emotes far better as a human.
Adam West and Paula Marshall are solid in supporting roles as Peter's
father and mistress, respectively.  And, in a cameo not easily
forgotten, Samuel L.  Jackson shows why he's one of today's hottest
commodities.</P>
<P>     Despite its obvious wit and bite, THE NEW AGE is plagued by too
many problems to be engaging.  Every time the movie seems ready to
settle into a nice groove, someone mentions something about karma or
initiates some quasi-religious rite.  These things just don't work,
especially considering the spiritual hollowness of the main
characters.  During one ceremony, Katherine complains that she's not
experiencing anything.  Watching THE NEW AGE, those of us in the
audience know exactly how she feels.</P>
