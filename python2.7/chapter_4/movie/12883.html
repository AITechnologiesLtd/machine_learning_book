<P>     Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont have commented that one of the
reasons they made CAN'T HARDLY WAIT was that "nobody was making those good
John Hughes teen comedies any more."  That's probably why CAN'T HARDLY
WAIT feels so much like a Greatest Hits compilation, peppered with
recognizable elements from the entire Hughes oeuvre of the mid-80s and a
dozen other teen comedies of the last 25 years for good measure.  The
events center around a huge party on the last day of high school, where
characters of every social stratum congregate [DAZED AND CONFUSED].
Nondescript nice guy Preston (Ethan Embry) hopes to make a connection at
the party with popular, seemingly unattainable Amanda (Jennifer Love
Hewitt), whom he has long adored from afar [SAY ANYTHING], before he
leaves for college the next day [AMERICAN GRAFFITI].  Preston has a girl
as a best pal, tomboyish and anti-social Denise (Lauren Ambrose) [SOME
KIND OF WONDERFUL].  Meanwhile, geeky William (Charlie Korsmo) and his two
even geekier cohorts [SIXTEEN CANDLES] hope to use their superior minds to
get back at Amanda's jock ex-boyfriend Mike (Peter Facinelli) and his
buddies [REVENGE OF THE NERDS], until geek and jock find a chance to bond
over their shared insecurities [THE BREAKFAST CLUB].</P>
<P>     That's one hefty dose of deja-vu, enough to overwhelm most films this
slight.  Fortunately, Kaplan and Elfont prove as adept at entertaining as
they are at reminiscing.  CAN'T HARDLY WAIT may be familiar and
predictable, but it's never out-and-out dumb, and at times it's
surprisingly funny.  The appealing cast features solid work from Lauren
Ambrose as vulnerable wiseacre Denise and Seth Green as a tries-too-hard
homeboy with whom she ends up locked in a bathroom.  Consistently goofy
scenes spring up out of nowhere, from the karaoke performance of "Paradise
City" which turns a drunken William into a sex symbol, to the arc of a
high school band's career from inception to breakup to reunion without
ever actually playing a song.  Some of the forced whimsy does fall flat
(notably Jenna Elfman's cameo as an "angel" offering advice to the
lovelorn Preston), and Kaplan and Elfont probably toss a few too many pop
culture references on the fire.  For once, however, the problems in a teen
comedy spring from over-writing rather than under-writing.</P>
<P>     If there's one noteworthy hole in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, it's the central
plot of Preston's pursuit of Amanda.  Ethan Embry is pleasant enough in an
unrequited puppy-dog way, but this is the kind of role John Cusack defined
a decade ago; you root for Preston not because his entire demeanor sells
his longing, but because the machinations of the plot point you in that
direction.  Similarly, Jennifer Love Hewitt provides a merely-adequate
object of desire, her performance doing little to emphasize that Preston
could be more interested in what she has inside than what she has outside.
Of all the plot threads running through CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, theirs is by
far the least interesting, though it's the one inevitably destined to
provide the happy ending.</P>
<P>     Still, it's hard not to find charms in a teen comedy that's lively,
moderately intelligent and effective in its portrayal of high school
social dynamics.  It also features a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack which
runs the gamut from Guns 'N' Roses to Smashmouth, from Third Eye Blind to
Run-DMC, from Parliament to the title tune by the Replacements.  CAN'T
HARDLY WAIT even manages to include a bit of social commentary in its
adolescent craziness, promoting environmental awareness, safe sex and
responsible drinking and driving behavior.  Sure, the latter is emphasized
when party attendees drop their car keys into a bowl, which is yet another
detail swiped from SAY ANYTHING.  CAN'T HARDLY WAIT shows off its
antecedents unabashedly, and still comes up with something satisfying on
its own level.  Looks like John Hughes didn't have to worry about telling
a generation of movie-goers "Don't You Forget About Me."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 re-Hughes-able premises:  6.</PRE>
