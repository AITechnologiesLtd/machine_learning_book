<PRE>AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Hollywood / 1:39 / 1997 / R (language, gore, brief nudity, muted sex)
Cast: Tom Everett Scott; Julie Delpy; Vince Vieluf; Phil Buckman; Julie 
Bowen; Pierre Cosso; Tom Novembre; Thierry Lhermitte 
Director: Anthony Waller 
Screenplay: Tim Burns; Tom Stern; Anthony Waller </P>
<P>It's a sad, ironic thing when a werewolf movie lacks bite, but such is 
the case with "An American Werewolf in Paris." This pseudo-sequel's tiny 
feet fail to fill the sizeable shoes of John Landis' 1981 cult hit "An 
American Werewolf in London," and sorely missed is the original's deft 
one-two punch of dark thrills and darker humor. This effort is decent 
but could benefit from a Mike Nichols makeover -- his 1994 "Wolf" was a 
biting satire, a sizzling romance and a supernatural thriller, all of 
which "Paris" obviously aspires to be. The film dangerously courts 
disaster, but a few weirdly charming elements keep things watchable. </P>
<P>The movie opens as a trio of horny college grads arrive in Paris, the 
latest destination in their "daredevil tour of Europe." Andy (Tom 
Everett Scott) plans to show buddies Brad (Vince Vieluf) and Chris (Phil 
Buckman) up by climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower and swan-diving 
off -- bungee cord tied tight, of course. But Andy's stunt is 
interrupted by the presence of a beautiful, distraught French beauty 
(Jule Delpy) also prepared to pounce from the landmark, but with 
suicidal intent. He saves her, much to her chagrin, and escapes the 
ordeal with a couple of nasty bruises and one of the girl's shoes. </P>
<P>Cinderella she's definitely not, though. Her name is Serafine, and when 
the moon is full ... let's just say she sprouts hair in more places than 
the armpits. But the recovering Andy thinks he has seen the love of his 
life, and devotes his vacation to tracking her down. The pursuit leads 
him into the underground of a Paris club -- actually a lycanthrope-run 
front to lure scum like American tourists to their snack-food doom -- 
where he is chased and attacked by a werewolf, and thus becomes one 
himself. Brad is killed in the ensuing havoc, and is doomed to follow 
Andy in the form of a decomposing nag, whose only release is the murder 
of the creature that mauled him. Andy, on the other hand, must eat the 
heart of his attacker to reverse his curse. </P>
<P>The first half-hour or so is pretty solid silliness, but things take a 
turn for the worse once Andy begins his induction into the wereworld. 
"Paris"' agenda quickly becomes overstuffed; everybody's either a wolf 
or a zombie, and the movie seems so intent on delivering the bloody 
goods that it forgets to step back occasionally and let its audience 
breathe. It's good when a film moves fast, but not this fast -- it's all 
too easy to lose track of what's going on, who's after who, how 
character motivation relates to the unfolding action, etc. The hyper 
editing doesn't help, turning already-sloppy sequences into visual 
disasters (watch how abruptly and haplessly a particular bedroom 
interlude segues into an all-out chase through the streets). </P>
<P>"American Werewolf"'s computer-generated creatures aren't as polished as 
those of recent fare like, say, "Starship Troopers," but I rather liked 
their design. These and other generally modest effects shots somehow 
manage to work despite being released in the year of "Titanic"; the 
afore-mentioned Eiffel Tower plummet (scored, by the way, to an 
excellent remix of Better Than Ezra's "Normal Town") isn't by any means 
spectacular, but is a nice, ludicrous scene nonetheless. Despite that 
famous Paris landmark's cameo, though, the movie utilizes none of the 
city's swank ambiance. If the natives didn't keep speaking with French 
accents, this might as well have been "An American Werewolf in Peoria." 
Also unwisely nixed is a stunner of a transformation scene -- "Paris"' 
prequel showcased both colorful London locale and creepy mutation 
effects that bagged it an Oscar. </P>
<P>Tom Everett Scott (so wonderful in "That Thing You Do!") and Julie Delpy 
(ditto for "Before Sunrise") have a nice chemistry and are genuinely 
appealing performers. Vince Vieluf stands out among the supporting cast, 
displaying a goofy charm that will hopefully lead to future projects. 
There are some priceless sight gags (one involving a flying condom, 
another with a discharged eyeball) caught up in the middle of this mess, 
but their effect is muted by lengthy stretches of inane exposition. "An 
American Werewolf in Paris" isn't as horrid as last fall's forgettable 
"Bad Moon," but it's no howl either. </P>
