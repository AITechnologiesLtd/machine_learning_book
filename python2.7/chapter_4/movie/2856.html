<P>     Woof!  Too bad that LEAP OF FAITH was the title of a 1992 comedy
starring Steve Martin and Debra Winger, because that's what's required
to watch this incredulous howler starring Bruce Willis as--of all
things--a psychologist.  Not since the Reagan Administration has there
been an acting stretch of such magnitude!  Alas, Mickey Rourke, we
hardly knew ye.</P>
<P>     Story opens with a campy kick--Willis is treating a patient who
abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since
Charles Durning dove in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  She goes splat, he goes
ugh, and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind.
Really.  The good doctor then moves to sunny L.A., where he rooms with
an old college chum (Scott Bakula), a therapist who's getting death
threats from someone in his Monday evening group.</P>
<P>     Buddy bites it in the second reel (no surprise there) and Willis
agrees to take over both the group and the death threats.  For his
troubles as Therapy Man, Willis gets to share some cut-from-NC17 love
scenes with THE LOVER's Jane March while dodging nails, cars, and
rattlesnakes.</P>
<PRE>     Why'd it have to be snakes?</PRE>
<P>     COLOR OF NIGHT is the worst movie of the year.  Period.  Forget
NORTH, CLIFFORD, or, heaven help us, even ON DEADLY GROUND.  Here is a
movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can't help but wonder how
the actors all kept straight faces while filming.</P>
<P>     For starters, the "group" is a collection of mixed nuts better
suited to Bob Newhart than Bruce Willis.  These are realistic
portrayals of the mentally unhealthy?  Playing a prissy
obsessive/compulsive, CUCKOOS NEST alumni Brad Dourif, alone, may set
the psychology profession back ten years.</P>
<P>     The plot's a wreck with laughable dialogue, pointless POV shifts,
and the one Big Secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes.  Director
Richard Rush, who once helmed FREEBIE AND THE BEAN, doesn't seem to
mind.  Unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations, he
overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set-pieces
to make the effort almost worth watching.  His token freeway chase is
OK, but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala (most
recently) FATAL ANALYSIS.</P>
<P>     Acting credits are across-the-board awful.  Willis can be forgiven
because he's filming DIE HARD 3 as we speak.  But what about Ruben
Blades insulting presence as The Cop?  Or Lesley Ann Warren's
stereotypical sex addict?  Or Worst Offender Jane March as a
mystery-girl-who's-no-real-mystery?  Shudder.</P>
<P>     BOTTOM LINE:  How they all kept straight faces, I'll never know.</P>
<PRE>Grade: F</PRE>
