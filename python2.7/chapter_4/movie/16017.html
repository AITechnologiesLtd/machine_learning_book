<PRE>`Patch Adams' – A Good Bedside Manner Isn't Enough
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Hunter `Patch' Adams could probably be considered something of a
pioneer during his day.  He was a knowledgeable doctor for sure.  He
tried to introduce into the world of medicine at that time something
called TLC – tender loving care.  Appalled by the snobbery and the
holier-than-thou attitudes that many doctors exhibited, Patch tried to
develop a bond with those that he treated.  It was a bond that went
beyond the traditional doctor-patient relationship that stretched into
unconditional friendship.  As he put it, `if you treat the disease,
you win, you lose.  You treat the patient and…you'll win every time.'</P>
<P>`Patch Adams' (starring Robin Williams) is based on the true story of
this compassionate medicine man.  We learn about the turning point in
his life that redirects him towards the field of medicine.  We
accompany him to medical school and familiarize ourselves with the
obstacles that try to sway his optimism such as his competitive
roommate and a militaristic college Dean who doesn't accept his kind
of enthusiasm.  We also see that which inspires him.  These include a
budding romantic interest, the support of a meek but loyal friend,
and, of course, the anticipation of finally being able to treat
patients with his own special brand of TLC.  It is a noble ideal
indeed, but while Patch himself has a big heart, this film seems to be
missing one.  Of course, he acts like a clown and tear ducts will
begin to fill when he bonds with several children suffering from
cancer.  And there is an extremely funny scene involving a convention
of OB/GYNs, which I dare not say anymore about.  But all good stories
about ‘battling the system' must have some evidence of drama as well
as some kind of seemingly insurmountable obstacle.  This is especially
true when any movie incorporates a pivotal courtroom scene, which this
one has.  Instead, what we get is Robin Williams acting coy and
innocent while hamming it up just before the movie goes into a lull. 
What was most odd was that not once do we see Williams's character
actually practice any medicine.  That seemed like a big element that
should have been incorporated.</P>
<P>When I walked out of the theatre, I couldn't help but draw a
comparison between this movie and another film/tv show that
successfully combined grit, humor and medicine.  Remember M*A*S*H? 
You'll probably see more than just a passing resemblance when you
think about the doctor that never seemed to take things seriously, a
snooty roommate from the upper class, a cold-as-ice female colleague,
and a timid supporter.  Still, I will tip my hat to the real `Patch'
for making the inroads that he did.  Anyone who can remove the pall of
indifference from a doctor's waiting room deserves a salute.</P>
