<PRE>                                      MICHAEL
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show hosted by
Laura and Robin Clifford, running on Boston Cable TV. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<PRE>MICHAEL
-------</PRE>
<P>Nora Ephron, who showed mixed talents in "Mixed Nuts" and "Sleepless
in Seattle," takes advantage of the rejuvenated career of John
Travolta in "Michael" the story of the earthly visit by the archangel
and his 'discovery' by the tabloid press.</P>
<P>Also starring William Hurt, Andie MacDowell and Robert Pastorelli as
the reporters for the Weekly World News-like Daily Mirror, "Michael"
is a not-so-heavenly story of the journey by the four principals from
the Milk Bottle Motel in Stubbs, Iowa, to the glass and glitter of
Chicago. </P>
<P>Along the way, Michael performs miracles, both minor and major.</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>As you can tell from her filmography, Nora Ephron has proven herself
to be a hit-or-miss director.  Fortunately, mainly on the strength of
Travolta's on-screen charm and humor, "Michael" is a good-natured,
rambling little film that has its heart in the right place, even
though its point is muddled. </P>
<P>Travolta, who must have jumped at the chance to do a film where he,
mainly, gets to smoke buts and grin a lot, brings such a relaxed
quality to the screen that you can't help but like him.</P>
<P>Andie MacDowell gives her second best performance, yet - her best
being "Unstrung Heroes" - and shows no small talent as a county &
western singer.</P>
<PRE>William Hurt is adequate.</PRE>
<P>Robert Pastorelli does yeoman's work as a second-banana character,
lending some light humor to the light screenplay.</P>
<P>Speaking of screenplay, aside from the not-so-original concept of an
angel come to earth, the story is a cliched road/buddy film, with a
cute dog who is the focus of some cheap sentimentality.  Cheap enough
to hurt the otherwise entertaining little story.</P>
<P>I'm still not a Nora Ephron fan, but had a pleasant little meandering
visit with "Michael" and give it a C+.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Yet another unoriginal piece of product from Nora Ephron and the
Hollywood machine, "Michael" still manages to charm due to Travolta's
star wattage as an angel who drinks, smokes, has sex, likes a rumble
and piles obscene amounts of sugar and salt on everything he eats
(which strangely does not seem to include meat - maybe a
non-vegetarian angel was just pushing things too far :-).</P>
<P>Of the supporting cast, Robert Pastorelli ("Murphy Brown's" Eldon) is
the most appealing as a tabloid journalist who manages to keep his job
because his boss (Bob Hoskins) loves Pastorelli's dog Sparky. </P>
<P>William Hurt and Andie MacDowell are both serviceable as the bruised
characters gently nudged to try love again by Michael.  In fact,
MacDowell has one of her most appealing roles in "Michael" (although
she shone brightest in "Unstrung Heroes"), and even trots out quite a
lovely singing voice.</P>
<P>Jean Stapleton is whimsical as the Iowa motel owner who harbors the
angel. Bob Hoskins is gruffly clueless as the editor of the Daily
Mirror.  And there's a delightful turn by an actress whom I am unable
to name from the information given in the press kit as a pie-serving
waitress who gives in to Michael's charms.  Terri Garr also makes a
surprise appearance as a judge whose verdict is swayed by Michael in a
most unusual way.</P>
<P>There is some clever dialogue to bolster the stale story line,
particularly Michael's witticisms.</P>
<P>However, we get to see yet another dog saved (is this becoming a trend
or what?) and I'm afraid Ephron's just another safe Hollywood
hitmaker.</P>
