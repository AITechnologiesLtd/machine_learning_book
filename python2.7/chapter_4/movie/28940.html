<PRE>BROTHER
-------</PRE>
<P>In the world of the Japanese Yakuza, 'brother' signifies both a bond 
stronger than blood and the immediate underlings of a clan Yakuza's oyabun,
or father.  Writer/director/star Beat Takeshi is Yamamoto, saved from 
execution by the rival gang who've killed their boss by Harada (Ren Ohsugi, 
Hana-bi"), who's switched loyalties to save his skin.  Instead, Yamamoto
is banished and travels to L.A. in search of his younger, half brother Ken
(Claude Maki), a small time drug dealer.  Yamamoto quickly recreates the
Yakuza lifestyle in L.A., slaughtering Ken's suppliers and building his own
empire in "Brother."</P>
<P>Known as Aniki (brother), Yamamoto forms a particular attachment to Ken's
friend Denny (Omar Epps, "Love and Basketball"), ironic seeing as when
he first ran into him anonymously on the street, he shoved a broken bottle into
Denny's eye.  Aniki's ability to outfox Denny in the bets Denny constantly
proffers builds a humorous rivalry between the two.</P>
<P>Not much else is too funny in the violent world Yamamoto forms around himself.
Once the Latino drug connection's been wiped out, they form an alliance with 
young Japanese hotshot Shirase (Masaya Kato), respectful of Yamamoto after the
loyal Kato (Susumu Terajima, "Afterlife") stakes his life to prove Yamamoto's
worth.  Shirase proves too headstrong, though, eventually embroiling Yamamoto's
clan in a war with the Mafia which Yamamoto realizes will prove their undoing.</P>
<P>Fans of Takeshi's stylish violence will delight in the gunplay, Yubitsumes 
(the removal of a finger joint as apology), hari kiri and death-by-chopstick
scenes peppered throughout his film, although newcomers may be left scratching
their heads.  Takeshi's characters are always men of few words, but his Aniki
is too inscrutable, his motivation mystifying.  His script is like a mosaic -
it gives an impression, but leaves us to fill in the connective tissue.
Yet Takeshi's exploration of the meaning of family has a resonance which
helps us overlook his film's flaws.</P>
<P>Takeshi's Tokyo backstory is confusing to follow, only gradually making
sense as the film progresses.  The violence ingrained in Aniki's being
could explain why he allows his clan into an unwinnable war, yet it doesn't
explain Denny's loyalty, which costs him everything.  (It doesn't help that
Epps, after facing a shattering revelation, plays a revenge scene too
lightly.)  Kitano introduces a flighty mistress (Joy Nakagawa) for Aniki out 
of nowhere, then dispatches her just as abruptly.  Still Kitano's Aniki 
is a striking figure with his elaborate Yakuza back tattoo, black suits and
dark sunglasses and his final, prophetic gesture is that of a larger than
life iconic figure.</P>
<P>While Director of Photography Katsumi Yanagijima's ("Sonatine") Tokyo
scenes look like claustrophobic stage sets, he captures an outsider's
look at L.A. emphasizing horizontal lines in the architecture and landscapes.
Joe Hisaishi provides the typical, retro-orchestral Kitano score.</P>
<P>"Brother" is not likely to win new fans for Takeshi Kitano, but it's an
intriguing, if not wholly satisfying, addition to his oeuvre.</P>
