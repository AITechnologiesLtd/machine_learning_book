<P>The War Of The Worlds
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1953, not rated, 85 minutes [1 hour, 25 minutes]
[science fiction]
starring: Gene Barry (Dr. Clayton Forrester), Ann Robinson (Sylvia Van
Buren), Les Tremayne (General Mann), Lewis Martin (Pastor Matthew Collins),
written by Barre Lyndon, produced by George Pal, directed by Bryon Haskin,
based on the novel by H.G. Wells.</P>
<P>        "The War Of The Worlds" is a good film that wonders just how smart and
powerful humans really are. Here in the United States we'd like to think
we're the most powerful nation ever. We can win wars, but are we prepared to
take on invaders from another planet?</P>
<P>        Gene Barry stars as Dr. Clayton Forrester, the token genius scientist who is
called into a Californian town when a huge meteor crashes in the nearby
mountains. The opening scenes are not very intense, so everything seems
normal. The dialogue and storytelling style is interesting, as it adds a bit
of suspense when we realize the meteor is not all it seems. There is also a
good sense of humanism here as we meet Sylvia Van Buren (Robinson), a regular
woman who is fascinated by Dr. Forrester's work, and her uncle, Pastor
Matthew Collins (Martin), who is one of the most realistic clergy characters
I have ever seen in the movies.</P>
<P>        Three men are left to watch the meteor as it has been causing some fires in
the area in which it landed. One of the men notices a long, metallic probe
sticking out of the meteor. The design to this probe is simple, yet it is
frightening because of the mood. We know nothing about it, only that it must
be  extra-terrestrial in nature. A catastrophe ensues but what makes the film
so intense is that it doesn't move too quickly. It's obvious what's going to
happen in the long run, but it takes the time to establish the necessary
details which are quite exciting. </P>
<P>        When Dr. Forrester and the local sheriff look for the men, we then see,
through their perspective, an alien spaceship in its entirety which proceeds
to attack and shows just how powerful and ruthless it is. Obviously these
aliens are not friendly, and we get an old fashioned military defense set up
for resistance. </P>
<P>        Haskin does a good job in establishing the presence of the aliens. We see a
reporter talk about similar events happening all around the world saying,
"Once the alien crafts move on, no news continues to come out of that area." </P>
<P>        Since the story already has a good sense of humanism to it, it uses that
element to transition to moods of fear and suspense. When one of the main
characters approaches the crafts they are incinerated, after which the
military opens fire to no avail. This entire scene might not be completely
original, but it is interesting to watch because it shows just how primitive
the humans are compared to the aliens.</P>
<P>        Dr. Forrester and Sylvia try to escape via an unreliable airplane. They
crash land and hide in an abandoned farmhouse, which is later surrounded by
three alien ships. This is one of the best scenes in the film and it is
really scary because the suspense has been built up. The fear of the unknown
comes to a boil when the two find themselves face to face with one of the
aliens.</P>
<P>        The two escape and manage to make it to the authorities, all the while we
have really learned a lot about the invaders through the scientific logic and
the characters' rationale. The military resorts to atomic warfare, but even
this effort is futile.</P>
<P>        The last act starts to crumble a little as Forrester and Sylvia are
separated. All we really see are scenes of devastation by the aliens and
people fleeing for their lives. The ending can only been seen as either very
weak or very strong  as it is a case of classic, literary irony, but does
give a sense of poetic justice.</P>
<P>        "The War Of The Worlds" proves everything in nature has a purpose, but it's
far from a work of thematic genius. It's your basic science fiction film and
it works. </P>
