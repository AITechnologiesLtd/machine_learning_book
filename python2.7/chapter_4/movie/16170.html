<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>OK. Here's a movie about five people with fifty guns and unlimited ammo.
Robert de Niro with his pleasant little mole is our friendly neighborhood
ex-CIA mercenary. The mathematician from Good Will Hunting is our favorite
ex-KGB traitor. The guy from The Professional? He's a nice French mercenary,
probably ex-French Secret Service. All of them are killers, all of them
darkly comic and all of them after one thing: a nice steel box which has
something in it that both the IRA and the Russians want.</P>
<P>It's a movie of one-upsmanship: each scene is better than the last. Each car
chase claims more cars, each shootout more lives, each scene, more time.
>From the French countryside to the highway tunnels under Paris, Ronin takes
you, willing or unwilling, along a complex winding plot of people searching
for a mysterious box because of the money… not to mention one or two of them
may have an anterior motive.</P>
<P>Somehow, this psychotic inner child has a brain all of its own, coming up
with its own plausibility and interesting traits (not to say it would be
standard without them… it's one of the finer action films I've ever seen),
such as the title itself (a Ronin is a Samurai without a master). Then it
turns around and has a car chase that makes Speed look like a little kid on
a scooter. Yeah, come to think of it, it has so much fun shooting this way
and that, it makes any action film look like a kid on a scooter… or worse.
Some of them are still learning to walk next to this sweet thing.</P>
