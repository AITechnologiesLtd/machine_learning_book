<PRE>                       THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS

<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs? Do 
you? Well, as this movie shows us, they make good companions but 
pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships 
can bring. Unfortunately, there's a giant roadblock set up in our 
culture that only certain people can get through while the rest 
of us mill around outside, feeling sorry for ourselves. A Checkpoint 
Beautiful kind of thing, and Janeane Garafolo's character Abby relates 
to it well.</P>
<P>        Like a certain oversized teenage movie critic, she is 
intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the 
opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive, and 
the men seem to be backing her up on that. Meanwhile, her gorgeous 
neighbor Nora (Uma Thurman... Uma being the only woman's name 
worse than Nora) attracts men like flies. As Abby tells her, "You burp 
and they think it's cute. You barf and they line up to hold your hair 
back." But Nora's down on herself for being too shallow and 
superficial. We all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian 
Abby's talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates 
off his basset hound. (Oh come on, any idiot knows how to handle 
that problem!) He likes her personality and professional demeanor 
and asks to meet her in person. Abby, though, knows her body 
doesn't match her personality and that she probably won't have a 
chance with him once he sees her. So she gives him Nora's body 
description and stands him up.</P>
<P>        Nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the 
dog man comes by and Abby asks her for a big favor. She goes along 
with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun, 
Abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named Donna. The 
dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful, she's not quite 
as intellectual or confident about herself in person, but he doesn't 
suspect anything, realizing he's not living in a "Three's Company" 
episode.</P>
<P>        The charade continues, with Abby furthering the 
relationship over the phone (including a decidedly unnecessary 
phone sex/masturbation sequence) and Nora furthering it in person, 
while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man. Like 
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, this comedy/romance is predictable 
all the way through, but we care enough about the characters 
that we root them on and will the romance to blossom.</P>
<P>        THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS isn't quite as 
entertaining as I was expecting it to be, but it handles well a 
theme I could identify with. The thing is, I find Janeane Garafolo 
rather attractive. She's no Uma but I'm sure in real life she'd have 
no problems attracting men. I, on the other hand, couldn't attract 
a man to save my life... and am rather proud of that fact.</P>
