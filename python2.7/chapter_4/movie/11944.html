<P>I find it a marvel that Species II was even made.  Species was,
perhaps, the most disappointing film of 1995:  it was (and still is)
nothing more than a long, violent, and unoriginal excuse to show off
Natasha Henstridge's anatomy in various flattering positions.  And, as
far as I could tell, most people agreed with my position on that film. 
It did make about $60 million in domestic markets, so I suppose it
wasn't a total flop.  However, it doesn't seem like the kind of picture
that warrants a sequel.  Most sequels are shoddy remakes of critically
acclaimed box-office successes.  Species II, however, is a sequel to a
critically lambasted film of marginal box office success.  </P>
<P>And, almost miraculously, it is a better film than the original.  It's
goofy in a lot of the same ways, but the story is more interesting (and
stays interesting through the end, unlike the original film), the acting
is better, and the film is more exciting.  It's not a great film--it
does suffer from numerous cliches of the genre, and lacks in other
areas; but it's an exciting and watchable film.  In other words, it's a
big surprise.  Actually, my expectations of Species II were so low that,
in retrospect, I suppose a pleasant surprise like this was inevitable.  </P>
<P>The film begins with all-American astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin
Lazard) landing on Mars to pick up soil samples.  It turns out that the
vile alien DNA that created the alien in the first film, Sil, is in this
soil.  Naturally, Patrick gets infected with the DNA.  The hook of the
Species series is that the aliens are really big on procreation:  they
constantly crave violent and athletic sex.  And the sex always ends in
the bloody birth of a new alien child.  In Species II, these birth
scenes are even more gory:  the women Patrick takes to bed inflate like
balloons, and subsequently their stomachs explode so the small
human-looking aliens can emerge.  Of course, it's almost a direct
rip-off from the Alien birth sequences, but it didn't bother me too
much.</P>
<P>The government, it turns out, is growing another alien to study.  This
one is named Eve, and is played by Henstridge.  When Patrick returns
from Mars, he and Eve develop a bond so strong that all they think about
is sex.  And, for everyone going to see this film for a shot of
Henstridge in the buff, you won't be disappointed.  (It makes me wonder
if this entire film was created just as an excuse to show us her
breasts.)</P>
<P>I liked the special effects.  It's interesting to see good old models
instead of digital stuff, but I imagine this will be one of the last
films to use them.  And the obligatory big-alien battle in the
conclusion is surprisingly well-done.  Lately, we've had a few really
irritating conclusions that feature big, poorly-animated aliens; Lost in
Space and Mortal Kombat:  Annihilation come to mind.  Species also has a
scene like this, but this sequel beats out all the contestants.  The
alien looks great, and the battle is well-choreographed.   </P>
<P>The acting here is also fun to watch.  Michael Madsen and Marg
Helgenberger reprise their roles from the first film, and they both do a
good job.  Henstridge is entertaining (though I don't really think she
can act).  I especially liked Lazard as the bad alien, but I wondered
what James Cromwell was doing in the small, useless role of Patrick's
father.  The characters, overall, suffer from the same element that most
sci-fi and action characters suffer:  they aren't very interesting.  </P>
<P>The film, overall, is pretty formulaic.  It doesn't do anything out of
the ordinary, and many of the death scenes are needlessly graphic (and
sometimes unintentionally funny).  And it ends with that awful "It still
isn't over!" cliche.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film.  Species II is
exciting, and it has a flash of intelligence and interest that most
entries into this genre lack entirely.  And the very fact that it
exceeds its predecessor is a feat in itself.  </P>
