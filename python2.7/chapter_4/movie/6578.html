<PRE>                                    SHINE
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1996 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>I admire the way foreign films manage to tell a story without standard
Hollywood trappings.  This is a good thing most of the time but in the case
of 'Shine' the emotional impact needed to sustain a film of family, genius,
insanity and redemption is missing.  Based on a true story, the Australian
made 'Shine' is the story of a musical pianist/genius (Geoffrey Rush) driven
to the brink of insanity through the pressure of obtaining success and the
break-up he has with his family after turning against his father's wishes to
leave home in Perth, Australia to pursue his studies in London, England.
 Given the fact that most psychological studies have concluded that genius is
often associated with insanity is a factor as well.  His father (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) disowns him but the emotional bond between them remains.  The
film opens on a rainy evening in the present day and Rush's character is
approaching 50 and the movie is then told in flashback from his days as a boy
growing up in Australia and becoming a legend at 14 with his gift of tickling
the ivories.  I wasn't moved by this picture the way I thought I would be and
'Shine' doesn't have a lot to offer the average movie goer as it is a film
better suited to film buffs rather than for general audiences.  It's art must
be appreciated and I suppose the film's admirable qualities depend on your
point of view and for a look at the life of a musician with emotion and
Hollywood running rampant you can look at 1995's 'Mr. Holland's Opus,' a film
many considered overly sentimental but a balance is not struck with 'Shine'
as it is just the opposite and my preference is the former.  Judge for
yourself.  Other notable members of the cast are Noah Taylor, Lynn Redgrave
and Sir John Gielgud.</P>
