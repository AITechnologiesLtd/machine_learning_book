<PRE>                           GEORGE WASHINGTON
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     What astonishes is not that George Washington is a good film, it's
that the movie can tell such a powerful and complicated story in just 89
minutes.  Its length is a telling reminder that length does not equal
gravity.  In fact, thinking over the last year or so of 2 1/2-hour-plus
epics that never got around to saying much of anything, I'm inclined to
believe that the opposite is true.</P>
<P>     Recalling Days of Heaven and Sling Blade, George Washington takes
us on a tour of the Deep South, centering on a preteen African-American
named George (Richardson, not Washington -- played by Donald Holden), a
boy whose skull bones have never fully developed.  With his soft head,
he wears a helmet wherever he goes and isn't allowed to go swimming, as
the water would in some way soak into his brain, causing extreme pain.</P>
<P>     George and his friends live the idle lives of teens on a
near-permanent summer vacation, goofing off in the woods, breaking into
abandoned buildings, stealing cars, and what have you.  One day, the
adventures get a little rough, and one of the children end up dead. 
Without really thinking about it, George and his friends simply cover it
up, staging an accident and leaving the body to rot where it won't be
found.  And they go on with their lives.</P>
<P>     But something changes within George, and he slowly begins assuming
the role of a superhero.  After risking his own life to save a drowning
boy, he eventually dons a cape and dog-skin cap to direct traffic
through his Podunk town.  George's life gets ever more mysterious, and
still the film's title is not explained.</P>
<P>     It's a slow burn and harrowing ride through what would otherwise be
a standard coming of age flick.  Partly scripted and partly improvised
following David Gordon Green's amazing direction (this is his first
film), the junkyard panoramas and organ music that punctuate the movie
belie a sophistication you wouldn't otherwise expect from a movie like
this.  George Washington will not be a film for all tastes (and a
cryptic, pedestrian title won't have 'em rushing to the theaters), but
the film is simply so urgent it's hard to ignore.  Worth looking around
for.</P>
