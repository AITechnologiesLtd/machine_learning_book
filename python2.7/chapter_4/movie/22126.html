<P>     For more than forty years -- certainly since the 1956 film version of
THE KING AND I -- Yul Brynner has been the King of Siam, and the King of
Siam has been Yul Brynner. Actors often define roles, and roles often
define actors (the latter much to the actors' chagrin), but rarely as a
role/actor identification been so strong, and so reciprocal. A Yul Brynner
impression without the words "puzzlement" or "et cetera" just isn't a Yul
Brynner impression; a King of Siam without a bald dome just isn't the King
of Siam.</P>
<P>     ANNA AND THE KING may not be Rodgers and Hammerstein, but Chow
Yun-Fat still faced a vexing challenge: re-defining a part so distinctly
connected to one man. It is the authoritative grace with which Chow pulls
off that feat that makes ANNA AND THE KING such an unexpected pleasure. 
The familiar story is based on the diaries of Anna Leonowens (Jodie
Foster), a Victorian era Englishwoman who accepts a unique employment
opportunity. A widow with a 10-year-old son (Tom Felton), Anna travels to
Siam to serve as tutor for the children of King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat),
the country's revered monarch. Though Anna bristles at some of Mongkut's
customs, she grows eventually to respect his commitment to progress and
learning. But the meeting of East and West becomes political as well as
personal, as Siam faces threats from the Eurpoean-colonized nations
surrounding it.</P>
<P>     Since the story is ultimately an epic romance, nothing is more
important to ANNA AND THE KING's success than the connection between its
principal characters. Foster, not surprisingly, is quite good as Anna,
striking an effective balance between her edgy independence and prolonged
mourning over her husband. Her tough-love teacher routine with Mongkut's
eldest son Chulalongkorn (Keith Chin) is a bit overly familiar, but she
comes thoroughly to life when she's on screen with the King. Chow then
proceeds to do everything one could possibly ask of an actor. When
necessary, he is convincingly aloof and regal, looking and behaving every
bit the stern ruler. He also shows a wonderfully light touch, lending a
devilish smile to his jabs at Anna's strong will. Even the more overtly
emotional scenes -- clearly meant to pound home the heaviness of the head
that wears the crown -- are nicely under-played. Those familiar with Chow
primarily as an action star should take note: his versatility keeps the
romantic angle in ANNA AND THE KING fresh and convincing.</P>
<P>     He's not quite so lucky with the political angle. Much of the film's
second half is dedicated to an attempted overthrow of Mongkut by unknown
forces, leading to battle scenes and narrow escapes. The double-dealings
are pretty conventional stuff, leading to an exploding bridge climax that
feels like it belongs in an entirely different film (one directed by Jan
De Bont, perhaps). In fact, ANNA AND THE KING stumbles whenever director
Andy Tennant draws too much attention either to finger-wagging at cultural
imperialism (a blowsy British merchant insulting Mongkut at a dinner
party) or to his own direction (an operatically staged beheading). Even in
a film that runs two and a half hours, there's just not enough time to
spend away from its complicated central relationship.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, ANNA AND THE KING is ultimately redeemed by its
splendor. No, not the splendor of Luciana Arrighi's production design or
Caleb Deschanel's cinematography, though both pieces of work are
exceptional. It's the splendor of Chow Yun-Fat that carries ANNA AND THE
KING through its occasional stretches of anachronistic anti-colonial
posturing and trite palace intrigue. Creating the image of a king is a
difficult enough task; re-creating a king who is already an icon would
seem to be thankless. Chow is nothing less than a presence that takes over
ANNA AND THE KING -- with his humor, his poise, his majesty ... et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 yes, Siams:  7.</PRE>
