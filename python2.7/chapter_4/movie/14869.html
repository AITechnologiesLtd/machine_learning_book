<P>Some stories are meant for movies, but then again, there are times when I
wish some stories remained stories, unless we had a French film director do
them.  Laura Ezquivel's novel is a treat.  It stays with you as a fine
dessert, or a fine food, and she knows it so well, and revels in it.  In the
film version, this gets lost because it can not translate.  The twelve
recipes for each month get reduced to an occasional side story.  In the
novel, it is the food that brings about the results, and Tita has learned to
make the most of the secrets of the culinary delights.  The movie couldn't
possibly show us how Tita and her mentor ever decided the reasons why such
and such a dish were done for whatever occasion.</P>
<P>This loss reduces the richness of the story into a film that is missing a
third dimention, but never the less, it is still good.</P>
<P>Tita, is the last girl born in a family, and as is the tradition, she is
destined to be the slave daughter to take care of the mother.  This Tita
rejects, and because of it, she becomes one of the slaves and reduced to
kitchen servant.  But her downfall into the kitchen has placed he in the
hands of an old maid that really knows her food, and discusses it as the
greatest love affair and event on the face of the earth.  To the maid,
the food is the monumental moment when one can place her mark on the world.
Tita learns well, and goes better.  Gertrude cooked.  Tita has learned to
affect changes in people because of her choices.</P>
<P>Sometimes the food is sad.... the whole table has a tremendous cry upon
eating such a magnificent dessert.  Other times the food is so hot that the
older sister has to leave to cool off, which is not enough even after a cold
shower.  And trot off she does in the hands of a military opposite to what
the mother stands for.  Tita's revenge is working.</P>
<P>But it doesn't work.  Tita is in love with the young man, who loves her, but
is forced to marry her older sister, because Tita is marked to take care of
the mother.  Pedro never really loves the older sister, and as they get
older, and the sister gets uglier, the thing between Tita and Pedro never
really cools off, and eventually is answered.</P>
<P>Tita has grown, and a good man, an American comes along and he relieves the
suffering she has, but he is no match for her desire and love for the one
man she has been wanting all her life since that one night.  Tita confronts
the ghost of the mother one more time, and returns.</P>
<P>Finally free to meet and enjoy Pedro, they finally do.  And we will keep it
this way for all the viewers.</P>
<P>I, personally, love the writing of Laura Ezquivel, much better than I do the
movie version.  But I think that much of this problem may have been because
I saw a version that was DUBBED and the voices were repetitive, unemotional,
and so glaringly
bland, that it ruined what looks like a good film.  It also appears to have
taken away the food part of the whole story, which is as tasty as anything
else.... it matches the desires
in all the film, but then, that must have not been the reason to make a
film, or to distribute it to other nations.</P>
<P>Superb performances, if you can get by the lousy translations and often
screwy sub-titles.  Read the novel first, and then watch the film without
the voices.</P>
<P>But a great novel, nonetheless... see it and read it afterwards.</P>
