<PRE>                         IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This is the true story of the victims
     of a conspiracy by British police to scapegoat eleven
     innocent people, many from a single family, for an IRA
     bombing.  The main character spent fifteen years in prison
     before an enterprising lawyer uncovered the conspiracy and
     was able to overturn the conviction.  Pete Postlethwaite is
     particularly effective as the main character's father who is
     imprisoned in the same cell as his son.  Rating: low +3 (-4
     to +4).</P>
<P>     In 1974 eleven people from Belfast were sentenced to prison for an IRA
bombing of a Surrey pub--four charged with the bombing itself, seven with
complicity.  Fifteen years later that conviction was proven in court to be a
gross miscarriage of justice.  Though this conviction could not have been
obtained without a conspiracy to subvert justice and knowingly to scapegoat
innocent people, the British government has yet to acknowledge wrong-doing.
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER tells the whole story of one of the men falsely
imprisoned from his background several months before the bombing to his
eventual exoneration.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a petty thief
who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and is railroaded to prison
along with several members of his family.  Gerry, who has never been able to
get along with his stern father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), finds he now
must share not a house but a small cell with that father.  Where the film
could have bogged down as standard prison movie fare we find an engrossing
father-son relationship that gives more meaning and poignancy to the court
proceedings that will eventually clear the names of both father and son.
The insertion of this father-son theme would seem contrived in a fictional
account, but since it is true, the film uses it well.</P>
<P>     It almost goes without saying that Daniel Day-Lewis's performance turns
in a good performance.  He is a first rank actor.  Surprisingly, Emma
Thompson is considerably less memorable in a script that does not use her
considerable acting ability.  The real surprise is Pete Postlethwaite as
Guiseppe.  He had roles in ALIEN 3, HAMLET, WATERLAND and with Day-Lewis in
THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, but none was particularly memorable.  This film
may be a breakthrough for him as a man of character and older values trying
to impart those values to his son.  The relationship that the two are able
to forge only when locked in together is one of the most moving features of
the film.</P>
<P>     Jim Sheridan, who previously directed Daniel Day-Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT,
both directed and co-wrote the screenplay.  Even though the film is 132
minutes, it tells a complete story and never bogs down.  Instead it gets
more engrossing as we come to see more of the pain inflicted by the
miscarriage the degree of wrong-doing on the part of the police.  By the end
of the film Sheridan has really roused the passions of the audience.</P>
<P>     This is a well-crafted film in all regards.  While self-critical
British films are not really a rarity, this is probably among the most
powerful.  I would give this film a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale and will
almost definitely include it among the top ten films of 1993.</P>
