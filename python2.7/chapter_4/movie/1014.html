                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a tasteless, sexist film about
     why it is bad to be a male chauvinist in a strange world that
     bears little resemblance to mine.  A brainless man is
     murdered and returns to earth as a brainless woman.  SWITCH
     is Blake Edwards begin part of the problem and pretending he
     is part of the solution.  Rating: -1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     I think everybody knows that Blake Edwards is a successful filmmaker.
I get the impression that he retreated into Beverly Hills some time around
when hula hoops were in and he has not stepped out into the real world
since.  That is fine by me.  He writes funny movies like the Clouseau films
set in a never-Never-Land-Europe or set in his hermetically sealed world
where you can go to one store to buy clothes and spend $41,000, and where if
you catch someone by surprise she has only $3000 in her purse.  (These are
plot elements from SWITCH.)  That is fine.  Edwards bragging about how much
money people in his class have is no worse than Bob Fosse bragging about how
much sex he gets in ALL THAT JAZZ.  Edwards has made a lot of people laugh
and he is welcome to his world.  Where the rub comes is where he starts
making comedies with supposed social relevance.  In SWITCH, Edwards tackles
the thorny issue of male chauvinism in an Edwards-Never-Land among his usual
assortment of under-dressed buxom women and mannequin men.  The sexism in
his world is the blatant stupid sexism of boors and is of an entirely
different character from the subtle and ambiguous sexism that occurs in my
world.</P>
<P>     Steve Brooks (played by Perry King) is successful in advertising.
("Advertising" is Hollywood shorthand for he isn't a policeman and he
doesn't make films.  Ever notice how often advertising shows up as an
occupation in films.  How many films can you name where the main character
is in plumbing supply or auto parts or has made a career of software
engineering?  How many people work for a corporation with more than one
level of management above them?)  Brooks is going about his humdrum life--he
is having a hot tub party with three naked women--when he is murdered.
Heaven, appalled by his sexism, sends him back to earth where he must stay
until he can find a woman to like him.  But he is sent back as a woman.
This situation has a lot of possibilities, some comedic, some silly, some
interesting, some controversial.  Edwards toys with most of the
possibilities, but flinches every time he gets too close to ideas that might
be interesting or controversial.  Mostly we see Amanda Brooks (Ellen Barkin
as the female reincarnation) feeling herself, feeling other women, and
wearing skirts too short and sitting with her legs apart like a man so the
camera can get crotch shots.  Most irritating is the misfire running gag of
her stumbling around on high-heeled shoes.  It is intended to get funnier
each time and it simply gets more and more annoying.  Apparently high-heeled
shoes are the only kind women wear in Edwards-Never-Land.  Barkin goes
through the movie oscillating between playing a really boorish male
chauvinist and getting fed up with men treating her the way she treats
women.  Edwards's idea of what sexism is about seems to be more connected
with men who get too much sex or who proposition strange women in the
street, actions more common in Edwards-Never-Land than in my world.  It does
not seem to have much to do with equal pay for equal work or even about
filmmakers doing films about naked women in hot tubs.  Incidentally, equal
pay is notably NOT and issue in this film.  The main character is paid more
as a woman than she was as a man for the same job.</P>
<P>     SWITCH is a film that leaves a very bad taste in your mouth, and more
so the more you think about the film.  SWITCH this one off.  For the sake of
a good, if not very well-chosen, acting job by Barkin and for some
competence in being entertaining I rate this film a charitable -1 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
