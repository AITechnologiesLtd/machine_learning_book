<P>Hungarian salami is one of the joys on life. U.K ham is another
--figuratively speaking. (So is Italian ham, literally, as found in Parma
and figuratively, as found in Cinecitta).  English ham is that
extraordinary, bigger-than-life quality one finds in a certain class of
English (Scots, Irish, Welsh, etc.) actors, often stage-trained, who can
mesmerize you with their voices,over and above their other talents. Whether
the voice is thunderous, insinuating, scratchy, snobbish, lyrical or
anything else, it is as characteristic of the player as a fingerprint.</P>
<P>Here's an extremely incomplete roster: Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence
Olivier, Sir Alec Guinness, Basil Rathbone, Robert Morley, Roger Livesey,
Claude Rains, Charles Laughton, James Mason, Robert Newton, Richard Burton,
Trevor Howard, Laurence Harvey, Noel Coward, Alastair Sim, Michael Caine,
Michael Gambon, Richard Harris, Alfred Hitchcock (yes), Stephen Fry --I'll
stop here before I drown  in nostalgia. Most of them are now dead.</P>
<P>Ian McKellen (b.1939) is alive and well. His voice falls on our ears like
heavenly manna. In Gods and Monsters, you almost expect him to address
Brendan Fraser as "dear boy", the way so many of the thespians above (and
others). I don't think he says it, but  it's there alright.</P>
<P>The movie is about the last days of James Whale. James who? Well, this is
what separates the men from the boys, the film fanatics from the fans, the
connoisseurs from the kibitzers.</P>
<P>Whale (1889-1957) the son of very poor, working-class Britons, started out
as newspaper  cartoonist  then served in the British army during World War
I. He discovered theater in a German P.O.W.camp. After the war he began a
stage career, was eventually successful as a set designer and director.
Hollywood's Universal Studios brought him to America. He hit paydirt  with
his fourth film, Frankenstein (1931), folllowed by the successful The Old
Dark House (with Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas,Charles Laughton), and six
more movies, notably The Invisible Man (with Claude Rains, his voice and
extraordinary special effects). The apex of his career was Bride of
Frankenstein (1935).</P>
<P>In 1936, financial difficulties at Universal added complications. Whale
also complained that he, the studio's star director, was ill-treated and
that the studio had butchered his The Road Back (1937).This was a sort of
sequel  to Universal's own classic All Quiet On the Western Front (directed
by Lewis Milestone). It wa about German ex-soldiers'  problems when they
return to civilian life.</P>
<P>In spite of interesting movies that included Show Boat, The Great Garrick
and the Man in the Iron Mask, by 1941 Whale had had it. He retired totally,
to paint and to enjoy his openly gay lifestyle.</P>
<P>Gods and Monsters, based on a novel about Whale is an invention rather than
a biopic, yet its essence, well-informed by the real  life and character of
the man, is true. Whale lives in Pacific Palisades, in a very nice house,
not a mansion. His health is rapidly deteriorating after a stroke. His
gayness is not. When his eyes land on a twenty-something garderner, the
hunk and ex-Marine Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), he makes friendly
advances and asks him to pose for drawings.</P>
<P>What Whale's inititial intentions were is left beautifully hazy and
ambiguous. The young man knows little about movies or about life beyond his
working-class milieu. He is properly --for the naive 1950s--shocked to find
out that Whale is a homosexual. But the undeniable fascination the older
man exerts makes Clay tolerate Whale's otherness, one that goes beyond sex.
The former director opens for him a new world of past and present. It's
done through a constantly serpentine succession of excellently staged,
graduated and never blatant touches.The two men keep their physicalities
apart yet bond in odd but believable ways.</P>
<P>For Clay, this is a kind of introduction to another culture, an immense
expansion of his horizons, a most original psychological and deviously
sentimental education, to paraphrase Flaubert. His relationship to Whale
moves along the lines of one step back and two steps forward.</P>
<P>For Whale, Clay fills the need for an audience and a sounding-board,
although he is not immune to thoughts of carnality. Through Clay's physical
appeal, Whale recaptures not the fact, but the idea of a past where
handsome young men would gather au naturel in the director's swimming pool
as a prelude to weekend follies.</P>
<P>The film has a complex structure,with real or surreal flashbacks to Whale's
destitute youth (that's after he stops posing as a patrician); to scenes of
World War I and Whale's love for a comrade. The connections between wartime
carnage and horror films are unavoidable.</P>
<P>Excerpts from The Bride of Frankenstein dot the movie. As poignant as any
is the meeting of the two pariahs, the Monster and the Blind Man, in a
celebration of friendship that  prefigures the Whale-Clay rapport.</P>
<P>There is also a reconstruction of filming The Bride. For me, it's the only
fly in the ointment, since so many of us have vivid remembrances of the
movie. No matter how cleverly and skillfully depicted, the substitute
actors remain just that.</P>
<P>The title comes from the Bride,where Dr. Frankenstein's teacher, then
collaborator  Dr. Praetorious (the unforgettable Ernest Thesiger) exclaims
"We have created a new world of gods and monsters!" (There is another Dr.
Praetorious in film history. He is the mysterious, generous professor Cary
Grant in 1951's People Will Talk).</P>
<P>Subtleties come at a quick pace.Whale sees in Clay a kind of continuity of
his Monster. The young man's head shape and flat-top haircut help . Whale
sees ( deftly and discreetly) his own self as both "creator" of Clay and as
a monster, a wronged artist  outside the main stream of Hollywood, doubly
so since his unabashed gayness in times of strictly closeted homosexuality
had its price.Clay gets no flashbacks. Yet he too has a secret from his
days in the Marines. Not a world-shaking secret, but enough to have given
him a trauma that Clay will help cure.</P>
<P>McKellen-Whale's sense of irony, humor, wit and the outrageous is
succulent. It's one of the picture's pillars, along with remembrance of
things past, the growing rapport between the two men, and the sick old
fellow's intimations of mortality. There's a "piece de resistance" in which
he takes Clay along to a garden party given by crypto-gay director George
Cukor in honor of Britain's Princess Margaret, shown as a pre-airhead.
Cukor (more than once) is the butt of Whale's acerbic jokes. Other barbs
and one-liners fly. "My driver Clay" he tells Margaret "is impressed.He's
never met a Princess before - only queens."</P>
<P>That McKellen is superb comes as no surprise.That Brendan Fraser is so
good, does. His impressive debut was in School Ties (1992), as a  boy who
in the 1950s goes to an exclusive prep school, hides the fact that he is
Jewish and comes out of this particular closet as a reaction to bigotry.
Perhaps the connection of "being different" between the two movies inspired
Fraser who's been in mostly lesser films. Here he does himself proud in all
in details in speech, tone, gestures, body English, expressions-- from the
way he eats new foods, handles drinks other than beer from a bottle, to how
he smokes an unfamiliar cigar, sucking it his gauchely. Whale sucks his
Freudianly.</P>
<P> A nice supporting role goes to Lynn Redgrave, practically unrecognizable
as Whale's stern but sweet, familiar,outspoken but polite (it's Mister
Jimmy this, Mister Jimmy that), clear -sighted housekeeper. Her strong
accent is a puzzle-- a blend of Transylvanian, German, Irish and more. She
gets the spotlight near film's end when, on May 29, 1957 she and Clay find
Whale, fully clothed, floating in his pool a la Sunset Boulevard. (It was
suicide, since the man knew his days were counted). Unexpectedly, this is
the moment when a splendid bit of black humor comes in.</P>
<P>G & M was nominated for 3 Oscars: Actor, Supporting Actress, Screenplay
from previously produced or published material. It won the latter.</P>
