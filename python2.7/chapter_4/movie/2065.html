<PRE>                        SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     This is the story of the discovery of a ten-year old chess genius,
and the conflicts between the intense study and concentration needed to
reach the highest ranks of chess and the more prosaic pursuits of a
young boy.</P>
<P>     I thought the tension between chess and normal family life was a
little overplayed.  After all, this movie would not have been made if
the father or teacher had been successful in pushing the boy to be
obsessed about chess only, so why create a dramatic conflict over
whether they will be able to do this?  The conflict over the boy's
playing speed chess in the park seems a little silly, too.  But it's
interesting how it all gets turned into chess, to the boy "bringing his
queen out too early".  And the fight between our hero and the "evil
chess robot child" is not believable or interesting.</P>
<P>     But the movie is rescued by the sweet and compelling performance
of Max Pomeranc, as the young Josh Fisher.  He's such a nice boy, you
want to see him succeed.</P>
<P>     There's a level of chess that was alluded to in interviews I've
seen about this film, which is based on a true story: the level at
which chess is a complete psychological conflict. I suppose this is the
heart of this film, but it doesn't really come across, though perhaps
it could not, in a film based on child actors.</P>
<P>     Joe Manetegna plays the father: I wish he'd stick to roles where
he can show more anguish. Browbeating ten-year olds just doesn't make
it. Ben Kingsley is the teacher, and he is adequate if a little too
Gandhi-esque to be believably pushy. Laurence Fishburn is the
speed-chess playing counterweight to Kingsley; I liked his
performance.</P>
