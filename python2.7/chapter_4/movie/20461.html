<PRE>Bowfinger
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) The situation is a little too wacky for BOWFINGER to be a
great, lasting comedy, but it is funny.</P>
<P>Steve Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a (very) small-time director trying
to complete one last picture before he turns 50. His accountant Afrim
(Adam Alexi-Malle) has written a great script, so now all he needs is
funding and a big-name star. </P>
<P>Martin's Bowfinger would be a great director. That's not to say he could
make a good movie, but he has all the schmoozing techniques down pat.
When he needs help from above, he can dress to impress (including
ponytail, cell phone, and convertible, all "borrowed.") When he needs
help from below, he calls people, tells them what to do, then hangs up
before they can say no.</P>
<P>Martin uses his schooze to "run into" a big producer (Robert Downey,
Jr.), and even manages to get some conditional funding. All he has to do
is sign the biggest action star in Hollywood, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy),
to his picture and Renfro (Downey) will pay for it.</P>
<P>Bowfinger's next stop is the Ramsey mansion, where Kit won't give him
the time of day. Things look hopeful after Bowfinger lies about being in
"Mind Head," a psychological/religious organization that Ramsey puts his
faith in, but as soon as Bowfinger pulls out the script, he's out the
door.</P>
<P>Kit Ramsey is extremely paranoid, and Murphy is really not that fun to
watch in the role. He plays the part perfectly for this movie, but he's
got a nervous tension that's not as likeable or entertaining as the
other characters in BOWFINGER. It's unfortunate because it changes the
timbre of the movie when he's on screen.</P>
<P>Bowfinger realizes Ramsey will never agree to be in the movie. He tries
to break the news to his crew, but doesn't have the heart. Instead he
tells them that he's going to make the movie WITH Kit Ramsey, as
planned. And he is, too, only Ramsey won't know about it. He's going to
stalk Ramsey from afar, and have the actors walk up to him and say their
lines.</P>
<P>He hires a lookalike (Jiff, also played by Eddie Murphy) to do
reverse-angle shots, and action sequences that they can't stage with
Ramsey. Murphy's Jiff -- a dumb, goofy lug whose career aspiration is to
be an errand boy -- is much more fun to watch.</P>
<P>Rounding out Bowfinger's cast and crew are an aging actress (Christine
Baranski) who has worked hard without making it big -- she hopes this
movie will be the one; his cinematographer who has the means to "borrow"
professional equipment from a studio; his leading lady, fresh off the
bus from Ohio (Heather Graham), who sleeps her way to the top of the
little production, but somehow never cheapens herself by doing it, and
four undifferentiated Mexicans Bowfinger nabs crossing the border, who
throw themselves into their new vocation and start learning about
lenses, f-stops and "Cahiers du Cinema." </P>
<P>BOWFINGER has been getting a lot of praise, most of it deserved. But
it's not a perfect movie, and there are lots of uneven spells. The jokes
are used one or two times too many, and as short as it is (98 minutes),
it's a little too long.</P>
<P>But it's still a funny movie, and credit should go to the great cast.
Everyone really did a good job overacting, each person trying to upstage
everyone else. They were having fun, and it showed.</P>
<P>Best of all, though is Steve Martin in another role that's just perfect
for him. He's energetic, optimistic, enthusiastic, and just a little
naïve. His philosophy seems to be "damn the laws, we're shooting a
MOVIE!"</P>
