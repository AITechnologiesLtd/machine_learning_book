THE IN CROWD
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>"Welcome to the lives of the rich and tasteless," Bobby (Nathan Bexton)
tells Adrien (Lori Heuring) as she enters her first party hosted by
members of "The Club."  The club is an exclusive beach and sports
facility where wealthy kids, not currently in rehab, like to play and
party.</P>
<P>Actually, "the rich and boring" would be more apropos.  Tasteless would
have been a decided improvement.</P>
<P>THE IN CROWD, lamely directed by Mary Lambert from a vapid script by
Mark Gibson and Philip Halprin, isn't the teen comedy that you might
expect.  It is a ploddingly plotted thriller that moves slowly in creaks
and groans.  So devoid of energy, the movie will have audiences calling
out suggestions for the characters.  In ours, some of the audience's
catcalls would have been an improvement.  To be fair, almost any change
would have been an improvement.  It is easy to see why the movie wasn't
screened in advance to critics.</P>
<P>The title refers to Adrien's lack of status since she isn't one of "the
in crowd."  Recently released from a mental institution -- where she was
placed somewhat capriciously -- she is effectively on parole to work at
the club.  If she gets fired, it is back to the hospital for her.  She
will, of course, prove to be just about the sanest person in the story.</P>
<P>As the lead princess, Brittany (Susan Ward) sets her eyes on Adrien and
fakes a suicide just so that she can get some mouth-to-mouth action from
her.  Closet lesbianism is one of the movie's few subplots.</P>
<P>The superwealthy, we find, have incredible bodies -- with waists the
size of small tree limbs, tans over every millimeter of their skin and,
in the case of the girls, prominent breasts.  It is amazing what money
will do for you.  Brains and manners, however, don't seem to come with
riches.</P>
<P>People will die, but you will not care.  People will be falsely accused,
and, again, you will be completely indifferent, as there isn't a genuine
moment in the story.</P>
<P>The movie does ask two important questions.  Does excessive use of lip
gloss lead to deviant behavior, and what is the proper gift for a recent
rehab graduate?  The answers are yes and a brand new Hummer.</P>
<P>THE IN CROWD runs a long 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for violence,
sexuality, language, drug content and brief nudity and would acceptable
for most teenagers.</P>
