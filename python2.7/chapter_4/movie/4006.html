                                 DRUNKS
                               [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Mike Ryan
                        Copyright 1995 Mike Ryan</PRE>
<P>Director: Peter Cohn (debut)
A cast of dozens including Richard Lewis, Faye Dunaway, Dianne Wiest,
Spalding Gray, Howard Robbins, Christopher Lawford, and George Martin.</P>
<P>     This film debuted tonight at the Boston Film Festival, on the
heels of a glowing review by the Boston Globe's Jay Carr.  I can't
concur--I found it a self-conscious actor's movie--pretty much like
watching an audition tape.</P>
<P>     If you're not afraid of spoilers, here's what happens: There's an
AA meeting, at which each member tells their story.  Richard Lewis'
character goes first, then takes off and goes on a binge.  That's
it--that is literally the entire movie.  There's nothing here but the
barest of frameworks for a bunch of (admittedly talented) actors to
give their individual interpretations of alcoholism.  Each story is
told as a monologue, with no connection to the rest of the film, and no
relationships developed between characters (wait, that's an exaggeration
- two of them did talk for a minute in the women's room).  Each actor
works in isolation, which makes it impossible to forget for a moment
that you're watching actors performing rather than flesh-and-blood
characters.  You could extract each monologue from the film into a
distinct short, and watching neither the short or the film would you
ever guess there was anything missing (other than interest).</P>
<P>Plot - non-existent
Cinematography - yawn
Acting - generally forced and self-conscious, a waste of some talented
people (only Spalding Gray seems to know how to make an isolated
monologue ring true)</P>
<PRE>Recommended only for students of acting.
