<P>     For six months, Karen McCoy (Kim Basinger) has been serving time
for a bungled bank robbery she committed for Jack Schmidt (Terence
Stamp).  Naturally, Karen isn't too fond of the man she blames for her
prison sentence, and he's mad that he didn't get the contents of the
vault.  Upon her release, she finds herself surrounded by corruption,
all of which is designed to get her back into the burglary market.  Her
parole officer (Gailard Sartain) is in Schmidt's employ and very soon
her son (Zach English) has been kidnapped.  Her only friend appears to
be Schmidt's cousin's son, J. T. Barker (Val Kilmer), who agrees to
help her out.</P>
<P>     At first, I wasn't sure if THE REAL MCCOY was supposed to be a
thriller, a drama, or a comedy.  Fortunately, it quickly became
apparent that it didn't matter: this film is too bad to be worth such
noble classifications.  With a plot that has no conception of reality
and a bunch of characters put together in uninspired fashion, THE REAL
MCCOY has little, if anything, to recommend it (unless you're desperate
to hear Terence Stamp's awful Southern accent).</P>
<P>     The interaction between Karen and her son is hideous.  I'd be
surprised if anyone bought these scenes, just as I'd find it hard to
believe that anyone sensed even the most remote indications of
chemistry between Basinger and Kilmer.  Put simply, these two are dull
together.  Maybe Val is still thinking about his role as Elvis in TRUE
ROMANCE.</P>
<P>     I'd like to know who convinced Kim Basinger that she could act.
More appropriately, perhaps, is who convinced production companies that
she could act.  Aside from not having an on-screen presence, she can't
deliver dialogue with any degree of credibility, has the range of a
potato skin, and isn't nearly as stunning to look at as her reputation
would indicate.</P>
<P>     Of course, the movie is bad enough that Basinger's lackluster
performance doesn't really hurt it.  Given a dumb script and plain
directing (by HIGHLANDER's Russell Mulcahy), THE REAL MCCOY can't
really be further sabotaged by the presence of a mediocre troupe of
actors.  It's sort of like spilling gasoline on an already
oil-encrusted garage floor.  Who's going to notice?</P>
<P>     There are a couple of mildly clever moments during the course of
the big break-in, but these are swamped by a plot that keeps getting
more and more ridiculous, and takes far too much time to get there.
Whatever minor incidents of entertainment are present, they're not
worth the price required to get to them.  The movie if the real thief:
not only will it cost you money, but it will steal your time as well.</P>
<P>     THE REAL MCCOY is filled with innumerable cliches.  After escaping
from the clutches of the bad guys, Karen and her son flee to their
hidden getaway car--which obviously fails to start right away.
Karen's ex-husband is, of course, a complete and total sleaze.  The
cops are all either interminably stupid or on the take.  And the list
goes on, except I can't reveal the most absurd of these without
spoiling the ending (as if it really makes any difference).</P>
<P>     Even Basinger fans (are there really such people?) will likely be
disappointed by this movie, which has even less to recommend it than
the rather putrid FATHER HOOD.  Lifelessness is the film's chief
characteristic, and that perhaps is being kind.  Far too many motion
pictures get filmed when they should be stopped at the planning stage,
and THE REAL MCCOY is firmly in that category.  If you want to see a
movie about burglars, you'll have a better time (or at least a few
laughs) watching the unredeemably campy HUDSON HAWK.</P>
