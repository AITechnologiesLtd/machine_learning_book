<PRE>Mystery Men (PG-13) ** 1/2
Starring William H. Macy, Ben Stiller
Directed by Kinka Usher
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Mystery Men was supposed to be one of the biggest box office draws of the
summer. It had a hip cast, (get this cast list: Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo,
William H. Macy, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, Ben Stiller, Wes Studi, Greg
Kinnear, Lena Olin, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Waits, Eddie Izzard, and Pras just to
name a few) an interesting premise, and great special effects, but somewhere in
the midst, someone had forgotten about the script.</P>
<P>Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is losing his superhero pop deal with Pepsi,
he's almost wiped out all of the crime in the city and is losing publicity
fast. What he needs is one of his old evil villains to battle with, the only
one still alive is Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) and he releases him
immediately. But Cassanova is smart, and soon captures Amazing and holds him in
his mansion of evil.</P>
<P>Enter Mr. Furious, (Stiller) the Shoveler, (H. Macy) and the Blue Raja, (Hank
Azaria) they are your b-movie type superheros. They go around each night and
try to protect the citizens of Champion City from extreme evil. When their idol
Captain Amazing is captured, they soon make it their quest to rescue him before
the entire city is blown to a pulp. They hold superhero auditions for more
people to join their gang and go to an old carnival where a man sells lots of
weird weapons.</P>
<P>That's exactly what Mystery Men is, the film has some extremely inventive
situations but smothers them in stupid, unfunny dialog. The performances are
surprisingly mediocre with only Rush and Garofolo standing out from the crowd.
It's also full of characters that we are supposed to find amusing that come off
more annoying than funny. Universal put $68 million into the picture, and so
far it's only made about $25 million, and it's probably not going to make $35
million either. While well cast, Mystery Men can't make the cut, so it gets
**1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains a scene of someone's eyeballs and face being
disoriented and burning (it's not that bad) it also contains some gross humor
and language. Good Age: 9 & Up</P>
