<P>Before going into Spike Lee's Summer of Sam, I knew that it wasn't
actually about the serial killer who terrorized New York citizens before
his capture in 1977.  It actually centers around a group of people who
lived in the same neighborhood as the Son of Sam, and focuses on the way
they reacted to a feeling of confinement based on fear.  John Leguizamo
and Mira Sorvino star as Vinny and Dionna, a married couple sexually
unsatisfied with one another.  The film emphasizes their relationship,
in addition to Vinny's relationship with his friends in the
neighborhood.</P>
<P>Summer of Sam is an ambitious, visually striking picture.  It reminded
me very much of Lee's previous film, He Got Game, and also has many of
the same problems.  The picture is very unfocused, and often doesn't
seem to have much momentum (it's also needlessly long, and meanders
towards the end).  The focus is distractingly skewed between the
troubles with the married couple and the neighborhood paranoia.  And
there are numerous scenes featuring the Son of Sam himself, and Lee
dramatizes most (if not all) of the killings; I found all of these
sequences unnecessary and gratuitous -- the film isn't a psychological
thriller about the killer himself, and his presence doesn't feel right.</P>
<P>Problematic as it is, Summer of Sam still harnesses an amazing sense of
tension; the film actually features one of the most suspenseful scenes
I've seen in recent years (those who have seen the film will remember
the scene in which we expect both Vinny and Dionna to be killed by the
Son of Sam).  The performances are all very good, with particularly
strong work from Leguizamo and Adrien Brody (as Vinny's punk-rocking
friend).  I liked parts of the movie very much, and I found it to be an
authentic painting of the period, but I left the theater not knowing
entirely what to make of it.</P>
