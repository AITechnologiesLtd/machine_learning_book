<P>I love movies. I really do. Every time I watch great movies like Goodfellas
(1990) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), a tear comes to my eye due to the
awesome talent, skill and entertainment that is on display. Even lower grade
films such as The Naked Gun 33 1/3 (1994) or Ghostbusters II (1988) while
not exactly brilliantly well made, are certainly not a waste of celluloid
and present entertainment value. Then there's My Favourite Martian, the
exact opposite of what a movie should be: a hurried, poorly written and
acted movie with one goal, to make money. Disney, ever since The Lion King
(1994) have lost their magic touch, but this dross just shows how far Disney
have sunk.</P>
<P>Christopher Lloyd plays a Martian who crash lands in front of T.V reporter's
Tim O'Hara car (Daniels), and soon Tim finds the Martian in his home, trying
to recover and fix his spaceship. Along with his 'Zoot' spacesuit, voiced by
Wayne Knight, must fix his spaceship before it explodes, and also try to
stop his identity being revealed to the public, firstly by O'Hara, but later
by rival T.V presenter Brace Channing (Hurley), by calling himself Tim's
'Uncle Martin.' 'Laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events,
but never does.</P>
<P>Many bad films have good intentions, but My Favourite Martian doesn't appear
to try to provide any entertainment. Filled to the brim with wham bang
special effects,  My Favourite Martian offers little more than some nice eye
candy. Christopher Lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie, I've never
seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now. Jeff Daniels plays 'staple
nice guy' and his role is useless. His performance is incredibly lazy,
although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance
he gives. Darryl Hannah looks as pretty as ever, but her role is somewhat,
erm, limited. Hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a
twit' and wins the David Wilcock award for 'Most Irritating, Godawful
Performance in a Moving Picture.' Way to go Liz! For the supporting cast,
Disney manage to assemble every character actor out there, during the film I
was going 'he was the guy in...ah..er...' before finally giving up and
switching off.</P>
<P>Another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick.' Unfortunately, the
writers (Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver, if anyone cares) forget that a
comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny.' Instead, they deliver Zoot, the
Martians deeply unfunny sidekick. Although meant to be a manic character no
doubt, every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud. A real dud. Citizen
Kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester.
Even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character: not one child
even bothered to smirk. It's a nice special effect, though.</P>
<P>Another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves. Or rather, the
lack of them. My Favourite Martian reaches a new level of toilet humour: it
goes past the bowl, down the pipe and into the sewer. Now, toilet humour can
be funny, as Dumb and Dumber (1994) humorously showed. But here, characters
farting, belching and almost getting crapped on (literally) is not
'amusing.' It's insulting. There's one good gag right before the credits,
but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny
twin continued. Either that, or they were hoping that easy to please six
year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by Men At Work in
the funny stakes. Yes, Men At Work. Yowza!</P>
<P>The fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film, and that they
actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more.
There are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get
distribution, yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease.
Thankfully, as soon as it makes it's money, it will never be seen again, and
My Favourite Martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the
end of the movie: down the toilet.</P>
