<PRE>                                  BACKDRAFT
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  BACKDRAFT loses points for squandering
     a good idea on a prosaic plot structure, but some of its
     scenes are breathtaking.  I would have liked a better and
     more original story, but the film still is exciting.  Rating:
     high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The first movies were all non-fiction.  The early filmmakers simply
shot the world they saw around them.  One of the more common subjects was
firemen fighting fires.  In 1902 Edwin S. Porter (who the next year made THE
GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY) made what is considered to be the first non-documentary
film.  He took previously shot footage of firemen and edited the pieces
together to tell the first fiction story in cinema.  He called it LIFE OF AN
AMERICAN FIREMAN.  As time went by, however, the subject of firefighting
showed up less and less.  It is difficult to think of a sound film that is
mostly about firefighting.  Films such as TOWERING INFERNO occasionally have
firefighting as a substantial subplot, but rare is the film with
firefighters as its main characters.  That is perhaps unfortunate since
there is great dramatic potential in the idea of the firefighter.</P>
<P>     There certainly seem to be enough films about soldiers fighting an
enemy who, in the case of most American wars, will be vanquished within five
years or less.  Firemen fight battles in a war they can never in their
lifetimes hope ultimately to win.  Films such as GHOSTBUSTERS turn to the
supernatural to provide a towering dramatic force that a few brave people,
with whatever equipment they can carry, have to stand up to.  It is not hard
to see parallels to firefighting, in which a person can be called on to
fight an enemy ten stories high.  As one of the characters in BACKDRAFT
describes fire, "It's a living thing.  It breathes, it eats, and it hates.
The only way to beat it is to think like it....  The only way to truly kill
it is to love it. a little."  The dramatic potential for a powerful and
frightening film about firefighting is there, but unfortunately it is only
partially fulfilled by BACKDRAFT.</P>
<P>     As the film opens in 1971, we meet a young firefighter idolized by his
two sons.  He takes his younger son, Brian to watch him fight a fire, not
knowing that Brian will also be seeing him martyred by his hazardous
occupation.  Flash forward twenty years and the older son is now a hotshot
lieutenant in the fire department.  Lt. Stephen McCaffrey, now nicknamed
"Bull," is played (as his father was) by Kurt Russell.  The younger son
Brian McCaffrey (played by William Baldwin) has been unsuccessful at several
abortive careers and now is himself trying his hand at firefighting.  Brian
is assigned to the same fire company as Stephen is.  This opens the way for
the first of several themes, the rivalry of the two brothers.  Complicating
matters is an alderman intent on budget-cutting by shutting down fire
companies.  And one more complication: there is an arsonist loose setting
small but very explosive sorts of fires.  Fire Inspector Donald Ringate
(played by Robert DeNiro) is doing the detective work to try to track down
the deadly firebug.</P>
<P>     In the war against fire it is possible to win battles, but the war
never ends.  There will always be another fire.  This is probably why the
plot relies so heavily on its arson subplot.  A film does not feel right
unless it has a conflict which is resolved.  Since it is impossible to
conquer fire the script, unfortunately, creates an enemy that can be
conquered--a single arsonist.  That unfortunately turns this film into a
rather pedestrian mystery story.  Too much of BACKDRAFT is about people
against other people; not enough is about people against fire.  Too much of
the script is very unoriginal, including one sequence toward the end that is
very nearly a direct steal from another current thriller (or at least from
books by the author of the thriller).  While visually this film is a genuine
spectacular, some of the touches of the script are very weak.  In one scene
Stephen is talking to someone on the street while his friends surprise him
by hooking up a fire hose and spraying him.  It does not seem that there can
be an unobtrusive way to hook up a hose four inches in diameter.  That sort
of thing attracts attention!  In the last fifteen minutes the writing and
even the acting seriously deteriorate.  There are some incredibly cliched
scenes.  William Baldwin seems to stop at one point during an alarm and he
poses on the firepole for Ron Howard's cameras.  There is an action sequence
to match any in a James Bond film, but it seems designed mostly to give
BACKDRAFT a punch finish.  It is extremely melodramatic.</P>
<P>     The fire photography is very much the star of BACKDRAFT as much as any
of the humans.  Assisted by Industrial Light and Magic effects crews, the
camera shows many different textures of flame.  Sometimes the flame is
beautiful enough that some audience members may go out and try to duplicate
the arsonist's crime.  There are many fire sequences, but there are two
extended sequences that are particularly exciting.  Hans Zimmer's score
makes a very impressive contribution to the film also.  I would give
BACKDRAFT a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
