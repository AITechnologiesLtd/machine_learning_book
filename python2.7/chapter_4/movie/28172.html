<PRE>"The Tailor of Panama"</PRE>
<P>British MI-6 agent Andrew Osnard (Pierce Brosnan) really screwed up his
last assignment and is reassigned to the armpit of the Foreign Service -
Panama. Trying to make the best of a bad assignment, Andrew recruits the
local tailor to the Panamanian elite, Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), for
information and unleashes a series of events that may lead to America
taking back the Canal in the John Le Carre story, "The Tailor of Panama."</P>
<P>Andrew Osnard is the antithesis of the always-honorable James Bond
character that we have viewed, for many years, as the quintessential
example of the British secret agent. Brosnan, himself, has made a career
playing the legendary 007, and takes a dark departure with his spy who is
left out in the cold by his bosses for his previous "indiscretions." Andrew
is the kind of suave, yet slimy, guy who can seize opportunity when he sees
it. That's when he has the idea to bring Harry into his control and milk
the tailor for information about his well-to-do clients, to get the pulse
of Panama, so to speak.</P>
<P>Harry has built his business on a Saville Row reputation and has become
quite well off as the clothier to Panama's stars. But, a bad, costly
investment in a failing farm forces Harry to act as an info-for-pay
resource for Andrew. To get enough money to cover his debts, Harry invents
a story about the country's "Silent Opposition," led by a former Noriega
foe, Michelangelo Abraxus (Brendan Gleeson). Mickey, Harry reports to
Andrew, is the new hope of the Panamanian people to end the government's
continued repression. The only trouble is, Mickey, Harry's good friend,
isn't told about the deception. As the money starts to roll in, the
indebted tailor perpetuates his lies with even bigger ones, digging himself
in deeper and deeper into a quagmire.</P>
<P>Andrew's controllers in Britain aren't satisfied with Harry's reports and
demand hard proof before giving their tailor a penny more. Desperate, Harry
involves his own wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), assistant to the manager
of the entire Canal, without her knowledge. As things spiral out of Harry's
control, he sees everything he has so carefully built for so many years
come crashing around him.</P>
<P>As I watched the first two thirds of "The Tailor of Panama" I could not
help but to compare it to the 1960 Alec Guinness spy spoof, "Our Man in
Havana." Both films are about a hapless everyman who is drawn into the spy
game. But, since there is nothing, really, to spy on, he invents intrigue
and develops a fake spy network. In both films, the hero's intentions are
the best, but go wrong nonetheless. Both start out whimsically, but only
"Our Man in Havana" sustains it. Le Carre's story departs as it moves away
from its early whimsy and takes on a dramatic tone that reps a sudden
change of direction for the story.</P>
<P>This is where "The Tailor of Panama" runs into problems. The light-hearted
nature of the bulk of the film is smothered by the serious episodes that
represents Harry's final fall, losing him nearly everything he has worked
for - including his beloved wife. This sharp turn in the story occurs very
late in the film and is handled perfunctorily, making the viewer shift
gears abruptly. This may be faithful to Le Carre's novel, but the
screenplay, cowritten by the author, is, on the whole, unsatisfying in its
conclusion.</P>
<P>Performances, both in front of and behind the camera, are uniformly solid.
Geoffrey Rush is always a pleasure to watch and he gives nuance and
dimension to his Harry Pendel. Harry is not all he seems or says, but
preserving his family and life are his reason for his deceptions. He is a
good man who, in the end, must pay the price for trying to grab the gold
ring.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan appears to being having one heck of a good time as the
anti-Bond. His out-of-favor Andrew is cunning and underhanded enough to get
his way. He is not beyond using Harry's misinformation for his own gain,
even feathering his own nest with millions of dollars of espionage funds.
Brosnan comes across as sexy and sleazy at the same time.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is made up by a bevy of talented actors, from Curtis
and Gleeson to Leanor Varela as Harry's disfigured (from the Noriega days)
secretary Martha, keeping the supporting cast close to the central action.
There is also a plethora of small and cameo performances, including
Catherine McCormack as Andrew's foreign service lover, Francesca, Jon
Polito as a deceitful banker and Harry's supposed friend, and Dylan Baker
as a gung ho US Army general. Playwright Harold Pintner plays the pivotal
role as Harry's dead Uncle Bennie, who appears to the tailor at critical
times, advising his nephew to give up his dangerous life.</P>
<P>Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot gives the film a lush, crisp look that
has a coolness belying the heat and humidity of the Panama location. As you
would expect from a story about a tailor, costuming, by Maeve Paterson, is
exceptional, especially the suits of Harry's design and the casual suavity
of Brosnan's attire.</P>
<P>"The Tailor of Panama" had me for the bulk of the film, but its sudden turn
from whimsy to drama left me out in the cold. I give it a B-.</P>
