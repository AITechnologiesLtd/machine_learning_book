Paramount release. 131 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence, 
sex,language). </P>
<P>Alas poor Archbishop Rushman! Chicago knew him, Horatio: a 
fellow of infinite resources, of most excellent connections. 
But the Primate never had a chance to become a Prince of the 
Church. Someone gorily slashed him to death. </P>
<P>Into the fray steps Martin Vail (Gere), a prosecutor turned 
opportunistic super-lawyer. Clever, cool, calculating, chic 
Vail--currently the cover boy of a glossy magazine--has 
attained fame and fortune. To get more media attention, he 
takes on "pro bono" (free services for the public good) the 
defense of Rushman's suspected murderer.</P>
<P>Blood-covered Aaron Stampler (Norton), fleeing the scene of 
the crime, is caught after a chase on foot. Everything points 
to him, everything that is, except motive. Aaron,  from rural 
Kentucky, may or may not be innocent but he certainly looks 
like an innocent, a simple-minded young man. He was devoted to 
the Archbishop who had rescued him from the big city's mean 
streets and made him an altar boy. Aaron tells Vail that he 
didn't do it, that he was at the prelate's place, that a third 
party did it. But he, Aaron, did not get a look at the 
murderer because he "lost time," which is how he describes his 
frequent blackouts, some of which Vail witnesses.</P>
<P>The script, co-written by Oscar-winner ("Save the Tiger") 
Steve Shagan, is convoluted. It involves Chicago politics, 
financial schemes, the Rushman Fund, Church-owned land, 
prosecuting attorney Janet Venable (Linney) who had been 
Vail's lover, her boss the State's Attorney, influential 
figures, an honest Alderman, an underworld figure, and more... </P>
<P>Everyone wants to direct movies these days, even the clergy. 
"Primal Fear" is the first feature by TV's nine-Emmy winner 
Gregory Hoblit who some years ago was taken off the film "Sea 
of Love." Growing up in Berkeley, Hoblit did the usual Sixties 
thing, an irony as his father was an FBI man. He made his name 
mostly with series like "Hill Street Blues," "LA Law," "NYPD 
Blue." </P>
<P>The influence of the jazzy, fast-cut, elliptical, multi-imaged 
TV style of such programs is evident in "Primal Fear." This 
does not hurt. What does is the murky tangle resulting from 
the subplots, allusions and implications. It is common for 
television series to place in certain episodes additional 
characters who may get developed in future segments. But in a 
single big-screen, detection-and-courtroom movie this clutter 
can distract and make the picture less interesting than 
Inspector Morse or Hercule Poirot whodunits. </P>
<P>There are also contradictions, loose ends that dangle yet 
cannot be revealed without giving away too much. It doesn't 
help either that Vail and Venable are now conveniently on 
opposite sides; that the resumption of their affair is 
telegraphed with semaphores; that we get no information about, 
or a sense of those two, their earlier relationship, their 
private lives. The duo may be adequate to the task of their 
current legalisms, but they remain unidimensional. </P>
<P>What you get is only what you see, and that is pretty 
interesting: Vail's and his staff's procedures, the 
strangeness of Aaron, the lawyer-client relationship. Best  of 
all is the acting by Norton and Gere. Edward Norton, in his 
film debut as the inarticulate, timid, bewildered and pathetic 
Aaron gives a rich, original performance with unexpected 
turns. His phone must be ringing with offers. Already we can 
expect to see him in Woody Allen and Milos Forman movies.</P>
<P>Norton steals the show, but Richard Gere is quite good doing 
his specialty, the man you cannot warm up to. His career is a 
puzzle. He's had some triumphs, like "Days of Heaven," "An 
Officer and a Gentleman," and many duds, like "Breathless" and 
"King David." Later two good films went unnoticed: "Miles from 
Home"  by Richard  Pearce (("A Family Thing"),and the flawed, 
nasty but effective "Internal Affairs" by Mike Figgis 
("Leaving La Vegas").</P>
<P>The hit "Pretty Woman" was Gere's box-office comeback. Yet 
after it, Akira Kurosawa's  excellent "Rhapsody in August" 
played only briefly in art houses and was under-appreciated. 
So was Gere's against-type sensitive performance as a 
Japanese-American. Five failures or mediocrities followed, the 
last one being "First Knight." </P>
<P>Now "Primal Fear" (an irrelevant, forgettable title), does a 
repair job on the Gere image. It also boosts the talented 
Andre Braugher of TV's "Homicide" fame.(He was still an 
unknown when Hoblit directed him in the Spielberg-produced 
1993 pilot "Class of '61"). As the investigator who works for 
Vail, he has some good moments and one wonderful short scene 
testifying on the stand with  ironic answers. </P>
<P>The movie is essentially old wine in new bottles, even though 
the product placement is not for wine but for Bud Light beer. 
Still, it is helped by surprises and revelations, a peculiar 
Jekyll and Hyde reprise, Oscar-winning ("Raging Bull") 
cinematographer Chapman, designer Oppewall, and an unobtrusive 
score. As courtroom drama, it breaks no new ground, but as 
momentary entertainment it is OK.  </P>
