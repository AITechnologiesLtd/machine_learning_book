<P>The Last Days of Disco (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Like writer-director Whit Stillman's previous films, _Metropolitan_ and
_Barcelona_, his latest is all about talk and nothing more--it's just that
the faces and the setting are different (New York City in the "very early
1980s," where the cultural phenomenon of discotheques and their
accompanying musical genre were in their dying days).  But the incessant
barrage of verbiage is forgivable when it is as smartly, wittily written as
it is here.  The main gabbers of this film are the naive blonde Alice
(Chloe Sevigny) and her best "friend" and roommate, bitchy sophisticate
Charlotte (an unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale, sporting a perfect American
accent and looking like a cross between Nicole Kidman and Parker Posey),
both of whom are recent college grads who work in a publishing house by day
and frequent an exclusive dance club at night.</P>
<P>The film is essentially a portrait of their and their friends' lives, but
Stillman shows little concern for any of them.  The emphasis is so strongly
centered on their impossibly verbose conversations that all character and
plot developments seem like throwaways.  For example, when club manager Des
(Chris Eigeman, a Stillman regular) develops a what is supposed to be a
serious drug habit, it comes off as more of a minor step down than a
plunging descent.  In spite of its failings on the dramatic level, _Disco_
is still a very entertaining film, thanks to an appealing cast (which also
includes Beckinsale's _Much_Ado_About_Nothing_ love interest, Robert Sean
Leonard, and a briefly-seen Jennifer Beals) and those wordy discussions.
Even though a number of the characters are Ivy League graduates, I'm not
sure there are real people who talk the way these people do.  But since the
exchanges are as funny as they are (a sociopolitical deconstruction of
Disney's _Lady_and_the_Tramp_ is the highlight), that complaint is moot.</P>
