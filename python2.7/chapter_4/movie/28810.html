PG-13.</P>
<P>What's the Worst That Could Happen? sneaks up on you.
It starts out direly, then unexpectedly gains
momentum, finally surviving on the charisma of star
Martin Lawrence and the experience of co-star Danny De
Vito. There's nothing brilliant here, but enough funny
throwaway gags for the film to just squeak by and pass
itself off as "entertaining." It strings together
conventions in an amusing way. Perhaps the best praise
I can give this movie is that I was rarely bored.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence, who has starred as a criminal in four
out of his last five movies, plays Kevin Caffrey, a
professional thief. He and his partner-in-crime,
played by John Leguizamo, rob a house owned by Max
Fairbanks (Danny De Vito). Fairbanks was ordered to
stay away from the mansion by a bankrupcy judge, but,
never one to obey something as frivolous as a court
order, he goes there anyway with his Playboy
centerfold girl-toy. He catches Caffrey red-handed
and, as the thief is being handcuffed by the police,
he steals Caffrey's lucky ring simply by saying that
it's his. It's the millionaire's word against the
crook's, and who's kidding who?</P>
<P>Caffrey will do anything to get his ring back, but
Fairbanks is convinced that, since the ring
coincidentally has his company's old logo on it, it's
his lucky ring. Bernie Mac plays the stolen goods
dealer who tries to help him. Wildly inconsistent
chaos ensues.</P>
<P>Lawrence is an extremely talented comedian, who has
risen above his material and rescued his films from
the gutter on many occasions. But he can't seem to
carry this one, which may explain why the opening
scenes have a clunky feel. Whenever he is on screen by
himself or with his love interest, the movie up and
dies. But whenever De Vito, Bernie Mac or William
Fichtner are on screen -- the latter hysterical as
slightly feminine detective Alex Tardio -- What's the
Worst That Could Happen? suddenly picks up steam.</P>
<P>Perhaps this is because Kevin Caffrey isn't a terribly
interesting character. He's the stereotypical "thief
with a conscience" that we always see in sappy movies
like this; he falls in love with a girl who thinks
that he is a "businessman" and swears to reform, but
something happens and he has to continue on his
less-than-righteous path. That's really all there is
to him, which isn't much to laugh at.</P>
<P>The point at which I realized that I was enjoying
myself came when Max Fairbanks was testifying before
Congress. Provoked, he suddenly starts spouting
profanities at the distinguished lawmakers. A dumber
movie would have left it at that -- look, he's cursing
at stiff high-class types! -- but What's the Worst
That Could Happen?, in what may have been its single
stroke of near-brilliance, also includes a
sign-language interpreter who gets a little carried
away. That's Stephanie Clayman, by the way, as the
iterpreter; I've never seen her before, but will look
for her in the future.</P>
<P>What can I say about a movie like this? It's not
inspired, it's not consistent, it's doesn't have a
terribly good script. But it's well-acted, it has some
good gags, and it held my attention for 97 minutes. I
can't ask much more of a movie from which I expected
so much less. </P>
