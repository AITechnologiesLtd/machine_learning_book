<P>     It's 1693 and a trio of witches (Winifred, played by Bette Midler;
Sarah, played by Sarah Jessica Parker; and Mary, played by Kathy
Najimy) are preparing a spell that will ensure them immortality and
eternal youth.  However, before the magic is complete, the people of
Salem capture and execute the three for consorting with the devil.
Before their deaths, the witches vow to return on some future All
Hallow's Eve.  Three hundred years later, a skeptic by the name of Max
(Omri Katz) ventures into the ruins of the witches' house, daring the
supernatural to manifest itself.  Heedless of warnings of his sister
Dani (Thora Birch) and schoolmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights
the dreaded Candle of Black Flame.  Suddenly, the three Sanderson
sisters have a second lease on life, and this time they don't intend to
waste it.  Now it's up to Max, with the help of Dani, Allison, and a
talking black cat, to correct his error and stop them before it's too
late.</P>
<P>     Like so many films that mix genres, in trying to do too much,
HOCUS POCUS succeeds in very little.  The comedy is sporadic and not
often tremendously funny, the horror won't frighten anyone over 8, and
the adventure is dull and routine.  As a family film, HOCUS POCUS is
passable--you can take the kids to it and they'll probably have a good
time--but there doesn't seem to be any great advantage in venturing
into a theater to see this movie.  It's unremarkable enough that it
won't lose much on video.</P>
<P>     It seems that the root of HOCUS POCUS' weaknesses lies in its
inability to develop believable characters.  In the absence of nonstop,
uproarious comedy or pulse-pounding action, strong characters are
needed.  What we get, however, are a number of poorly-written creations
that are taken from the writers' stock of readily-available
personalities.  For the most part, the scenes that are intended to set
up relationships are laughably absurd and difficult to accept.</P>
<P>     Poor acting comes into play.  Omri Katz is a bad choice for the
hero of this piece.  Actually, "hero" might not be the right word for
his role--Max is so stupid and annoying at times that we wish the
witches would stick him in their kettle and boil him alive.  He treats
his little sister like a burden (which is not entirely unrealistic for
someone his age) and does some of the most amazingly stupid things.
Everything that happens in HOCUS POCUS is essentially his fault.</P>
<P>     The normally-steady Bette Midler has some fun chewing on the
scenery in a part that is played as intended:  over-the-top.  Clearly
in Ms. Midler's shadow, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy give such
muted performances as to be virtually invisible.  They do a lot of
Three Stooges' physical gags, but without having mastered timing.</P>
<P>     Generally, HOCUS POCUS lacks energy.  The direction by Kenny
Ortega (who began his career as a choreographer) is flat, and the
camerawork workmanlike (this is surprising considering that the
cinematographer is Hiro Narita).  The audience's basic disconnection
with the characters is part of the problem, but that's not all of it.
HOCUS POCUS is not a lot of fun.  The film basically amounts to a great
deal of pointless running around.  The inventiveness that we keep
expecting never materializes and by the end we're still wondering if
and when something's going to happen to either galvanize us or cause us
to double over with laughter.</P>
<P>     The previews for this film give a good indication of the movie's
overall quality--it's like a live-action "Broom Hilda."  The best part
of the movie--a couple of cameos by brother and sister Gary and Penny
Marshall--are also highlighted by HOCUS POCUS' theatrical trailers, so
they aren't much of a surprise when they happen.</P>
<P>     There are a few special effects in HOCUS POCUS, but nothing new or
ground-breaking.  The walking corpse isn't a masterpiece of design, but
it's done well--neither too real to be genuinely frightening nor too
fake to be laughable.  The parts of the film with the zombie try too
hard to be campy, the results of which are less-than-successful.  For
fun at the expense of the dead, see Sam Raimi's latest directorial
venture, ARMY OF DARKNESS.</P>
<P>     At any rate, HOCUS POCUS is an occasionally dull, mostly pedantic
motion picture with little to recommend it.  It belongs on the long
list of summer movies that will quickly be buried and forgotten until
it surfaces on video in another six months.  Frankly, that's the fate
it deserves.  It isn't putrid but, for my money, there are quite a few
other films I'd see before this one.  HOCUS POCUS never lives up to
what little potential the premise has.</P>
