<PRE>SPANKING THE MONKEY (1994)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: David O. Russel
Starring: Jeremey Davies, Alberta Watson, Benjamin Hendrickson, </P>
<P>Now, first off, the title doesn't really do the film a lot of justice. 
It's more of like that joke about writing the word SEX in big capitols,
and then saying in little writing below, "Well, now that I have your
attention..."  This film does deal with the topic of masturbation, but
it also deals with such non-conformist topics like incest, rape (not the
real kind, the legal kind), and insanity.  It's not just one of the
members in a long line of films that are in some way trying to be the
90s answer to "The Graduate" (an impossible task, in my opinion), but
also an ingenius black comedy and intense character study.</P>
<P>Jeremey Davies is an MIT student, coming home for a week or two in the
summer to take care of his bedridden mother (Alberta Watson)who has just
broken her leg.  His father (Benjamin Hendrickson) is a travelling
salesman and can't afford to stay home for a summer and take care of his
wife, especially since they both don't share any kinds of feelings other
than belonging anymore.  So he shocks his son, who was supposed to
attend a summer program dealing with his major, by telling him he'll be
spending the entire summer at home with his mother, who is totally
depressed.</P>
<P>The film starts off funny in that kind of off-beat way.  You giggle at
some of the little things that happen, and laugh out loud at some of the
funnier parts.  But then your jaw begins to drop at some of the weirder
and more outrageous plot twists, like when he has to hold his naked
mother up while she takes a shower, and he begins looking at her...</P>
<P>He also begins a little relationship with a soon-to-be junior in high
school who wants to go to MIT, and watches as they begin to have sexual
feelings for eachother.  But of course, he has his mother to not only
take care of, but there's that bond between the two that cannot be
broken, and that will gradually drive him into a bit of insanity.</P>
<P>What's great about this film is how well the characterization is.  The
bond between the mother and son is a very intense one.  Through talking,
we find out that she wanted to do the same thing he is studying, but she
made a deal with his father to give it up and have him.  So he's the
price she paid for her loneliness and manic depression, and she seems
hell-beant on keeping him, even if it causes him some emotional
depravation.  By the films climax, we are shocked and deeply moved, but
not in that crap sentimental way.</P>
<P>Also great in this film is the great acting from all involved,
especially the two leads.  Davies shows promise as a young actor, while
Watson gives an Oscar worthy performance on par with that of Anne
Bancroft in "The Graduate."  While this may not be as great as "The
Graduate," it's at least as close as we're gonna get to recreating it,
even if it's the more liberal "Graduate."</P>
<P>It's hard for me to reccomend this film.  Afterwards, I felt horrible. 
Of course, that is precisely what David O. Russel had in mind, so I can
say that this is a great example of fine cinematic craftsmanship.  The
film is utterly depressing in every way, in such a way that I would have
to wait a long time to see it again.  Yes, it's funny, but it's such a
miserable-inducing film that I'd only reccomend it to those who are very
mature.  Any horny sophomoric from junior high who wants to view it as a
prerequisite for entering the Beavis and Butthead club should just skip
out and go for that porno with the same name.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
