<PRE>Kundun (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Withdrawal. It has to be withdrawal. This is now Day 2 of my lovely vacation
and here I am thinking about it. No CNN. No printer. No Internet. And, come
to think of it, no cheesy movies. I suppose, having become accustomed to the
bad for so long, I have accepted them, learned to deal with them, and become
addicted to the destruction of them in a well thought out review. I suppose
its ironic that the film that makes me want to tear a film apart, that
should make me learn that the bad films, the suffering, is a part of my life
as a movie critic, should be one focused on Buddhism. And it's also ironic
that it should stir the violence in my blood.</P>
<P>The film I'm talking about is Martin Scorscese's Kundun, the Dahlia Lama
film of 1997 that was nominated for four academy awards but walked away with
none (sadly). With a cast that no one's heard of it still managed to pull
off what is becoming impossible: make a great film about a religion that is,
for the most part, misunderstood. Make you sympathize with the Tibetans, and
hate the Red Chinese, and, at the same time, illustrate the drama of the
Dahlia Lama's early life.</P>
<P>It wasn't bad. No, in fact, the film itself was relaxing to watch, and a
helluva lot better than Seven Years in Tibet, the other Dahlia Lama film
that came out at about the same time. Not that it wasn't good to watch: no,
sir, I'm left enjoying almost every frame, the beautiful photography of the
film, the exquisite locations and vistas that it offered. It wasn't even the
direction and acting in the film: they were fine, too. Dramatic content,
writing, miscellaneous technical aspects that I don't even know why I
bothered to learn the names of them. None of them have serious flaws. None
of them annoy me in any shape, way, or form. What annoys me is that I have
become used to, no, addicted to, the ripping apart in a film in my review.</P>
<P>And that's what I'm missing. I'm not just missing it; I'm aching for it. If
I keep seeing films this good, all the time, with nary a bad film, then I
will cease to function as a critic, lose my cruelty and my respect for the
great films, like Kundun, and then I'll REALLY be unable to do my job.</P>
<P>I'll be stuck doing nothing, and be bereft of my moviewatching experience. I
suppose it's taught me something, this movie about a religion I hardly know
outside of the cinema: not only is suffering a part of my life: as a critic,
inflicting suffering is a part of my life too.</P>
