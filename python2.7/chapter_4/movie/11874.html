<P>     An educated concubine in feudal China (RAISE THE RED LANTERN).  A 
prostitute caught between two childhood friends during the 1940s 
(FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE).  A wife and mother facing tragedy in the 
aftermath of the Cultural Revolution (TO LIVE).  A sultry temptress in 
the heart of the '30s Shanghai gangland (SHANGHAI TRIAD).  These are 
some of the roles essayed by Chinese actress Gong Li, and they have one 
thing in common – all of them take place decades or even centuries ago.  
Even in THE STORY OF QUI JU, a contemporary tale, Gong's character comes 
from a remote village where the technology and customs are those of the 
past.  Not until CHINESE BOX has any director given Gong the role of a 
modern woman.  Considering how good she is as Vivian, a Hong Kong 
nightclub owner, one wonders why it has taken so long.  The actress is 
luminous in jeans and sunglasses, and, although she has trouble forming 
the unfamiliar English words that comprise much of her dialogue, she 
proves that she has the screen presence to play a character in any era.  
Sadly, CHINESE BOX is not the best forum for a display of her talent.</P>
<P>     This is the latest feature from Wayne Wang, the film maker who was 
behind the small, Brooklyn-based dramas, SMOKE and BLUE IN THE FACE.  
Instead of adapting the quirky tone that suffused those films, Wang has 
taken a 180-degree turn into melodrama for this examination of Hong Kong 
during the months and days preceding its transition from British to 
Chinese rule.  Given all of the tension and cultural upheaval generated 
by the events of July 1, 1997, this would seem to be an event capable of 
inspiring a great motion picture.  Unfortunately, Wang chooses to plunge 
viewers into a soap opera, a decision which robs CHINESE BOX of much of 
its potential power.</P>
<P>     Jeremy Irons, looking gaunt and unhappy, plays John, a British 
photojournalist who lives and works in Hong Kong, and who is suffering 
from unrequited love for Vivian.  With the approaching political 
changeover, John is feeling a deep sense of melancholy that is deepened 
when his doctor gives him some bad news.  The bulk of the film follows 
him as he makes one last, desperate play for Vivian.  However, his 
attempt to win her over is thwarted not only by the changing political 
tides, but by a series of dark secrets that emerge from both of their 
pasts.  A subplot of greater interest centers on John's endeavor to 
record the life story of Jean, a street hustler (Maggie Cheung).</P>
<P>     This is one of those films where the background elements are far 
more interesting than those in the foreground.  I didn't care much about 
what happened between John and Vivian, primarily because I never felt 
much for his character.  Irons is lifeless in this role, and his 
uninspired performance does little to draw us into John's world.  
Perhaps this individual is supposed to be a living metaphor for the 
rapidly-diminishing worldwide influence of the once-mighty British 
Empire, but symbols rarely make for interesting protagonists.  The most 
intriguing aspects of the movie are the political and economic 
implications of the changeover, but those are relegated to the 
background and shown primarily through CNN news clips.  Businessmen are 
nervous, but the only way we know this is through snatches of 
conversations that Wang allows us to overhear.</P>
<P>     Even though Gong is wonderful, I wish a lion's share of the time 
given to the sketchily-developed Vivian had been granted to Jean.  
Played by the wonderful Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung, who starred in 
IRMA VEP, Jean is lively and energetic – a welcome contrast to Irons.  
Her story, which we learn in bits and pieces, might have made for a 
better motion picture than the one Wang assembled.  Instead of getting 
the full narrative, however, we are fed the short version in a series of 
interludes sandwiched between the cliched development of the tortured 
romance between John and Vivian.</P>
<P>     It's doubtful that CHINESE BOX will be the last fictional effort to 
be fashioned from the events surrounding July 1, 1997 in Hong Kong.  
However, it's questionable whether any other motion picture will have 
such a top-notch level of talent in front of and behind the cameras.  
CHINESE BOX is not a terrible film – it offers a series of semi-
satisfying moments for those who crave a sudsy romantic tragedy – but it 
is a disappointment.  The real puzzle of this CHINESE BOX is how so much 
dramatic potential could result in a film of so little consequence.</P>
