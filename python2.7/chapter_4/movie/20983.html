<P>Random snores? Not for me, but my buddy to the left who, admittedly was
surviving on only two hours of sleep, did happen to nod off from time to
time during this film's two hours and fifteen minute run. I managed, but did
find this to be a passable film at best, with Ford offering us the worst
haircut of his career, and proof that "range" is not his strongest suit as
an actor.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A police sergeant's wife dies in a plane crash. As if that wasn't bad
enough, he soon finds out that she was on the plane with a man with whom she
was having an affair. For closure's sake, the cop decides to track down the
widowing wife of the man who she was banging. It turns out that the widow, a
congresswoman, was also unaware of their secret relationship, and would
rather just leave it under wraps. Over time, the grieving duo find more than
just betrayal in common and begin to "console" one another.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Do you really need 133 minutes to tell a pretty standard story? The answer
is no. This film goes about half an hour too long, offers a solid
performance by Kristin Scott Thomas, a stoic showing by Ford and his
goofy-looking earring, a completely forgettable subplot, but ultimately,
didn't bore me. The closest film to which I could compare this one would be
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE (6.5/10) with Kevin Costner. It's about grieving,
getting over someone, needing closure, and yes, finding love in places which
you'd least expect it. I liked MESSAGE a little better because of the
Costner factor (Ford lacks the charm and the romantic appeal of a
better-looking Costner), and the more believable romance scenes. On the
other hand, I did appreciate the ending to this film much more than the one
offered by the BOTTLE, but enough about the comparisons!</P>
<P>The two things which could have easily made this film so much better is 1)
If they had gotten completely rid of the ridiculously obvious plot device
involving Ford and his job as a cop, which was not only uninteresting, but
ultimately swayed our interest and made the film 20-25 minutes longer, and
2) Given the part played by Ford to a better looking man, a bigger charmer
and an actor who would have been able to convey a little more emotion than a
simple raised eyebrow every now and again. If you pay close attention to
Harry's "crying scene", you will note that it actually lasts less than three
real seconds (Don't hold back, Indy!). Very weird. Kristin Scott Thomas, on
the other hand, managed to hold a decent American accent for the most part
of the movie, and did convey a deeper sense of loss and grieving, two
feelings which seemed completely absent from Ford's "despondent" (?)
character.</P>
<P>So why am I still recommending this film, albeit barely? Well, the premise
is interesting, the development is well done, Sydney Pollack is really good
in it, and the lightly surprising ending kind of helped levitate this film
past my basic cinematic recommendation line. No need to see it in the
theatres though. Definitely a lazy night rental with the loved one, so that
you could forward the parts which should have been cut out. And remember,
this is a character-driven film, not plot. If the characters don't seem
interesting to you, skip this adult drama and drum up a romantic evening of
your own. You can never have too many of those!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ironically, director Sydney Pollack lost his own son in a plane crash in
1993. Sydney was born in Lafayette, Indiana.
Harrison Ford is listed as one of 50 people barred from entering Tibet.
Disney clashed with Chinese officials over the 1997 Martin Scorsese film
KUNDUN which Ford's wife, Melissa Mathison, wrote. She also wrote the
screenplay for the worldly popular Steven Spielberg film, E.T. the
EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.
Over the past 15 years, at least five different screenwriters, two
directors, James L. Brooks and Ivan Reitman, plenty of actors, including
Dustin Hoffman, have been connected to this film based on Warren Adler's
1984 novel. Of Adler's 25 published novels, ten have either been bought or
optioned for films. His novel "War of the Roses" became a film starring
Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.
Screenwriter Kurt Luedtke won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay based on
Material from Another Medium for his work with Sydney Pollack on OUT OF
AFRICA, which also won Best Picture, and Best Director for Pollack.
Nepotism-alert: As we see director Sydney Pollack let brother Bernie Pollack
take care of the costume design for this picture. To be fair to ol' Bernie,
he has a reputation of his own in this industry. He also dressed the cast of
MESSAGE IN THE BOTTLE, SABRINA (Sydney Pollack film) and HAVANA (Sydney
Pollack film), amongst others... :)
This film had a reported budget of $54 Million.</P>
