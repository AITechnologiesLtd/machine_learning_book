<PRE>                     LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A prominent British author becomes
          infatuated with young American heartthrob actor.
          He travels to Long Island to find the actor.  John
          Hurt gives a good performance, but the film is too
          leaden to work as a comedy and but is not serious
          enough to work as good drama.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10),
          low +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 14 positive, 1 negative, 2 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Thomas Mann's short intense psychological novel DEATH IN VENICE is
unlikely material for a contemporary comedy-drama.  And while nothing
in the credits or publicity acknowledges the connection, that would
seem that that is the basis for this updated story taking place in
London and Long Island.</P>
<P>     Giles De'Ath (played by John Hurt) is one of the great living
English authors, his ivory tower insulating him from anything modern,
just the way he likes it.  An unlikely series of events puts him in a
movie theater showing a cinematic trifle called HOT PANTS COLLEGE II.
Giles is about to turn away from the film in disgust when he notices
Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley).  Bostock is an attractive young actor
who simply put infatuates Giles.</P>
<P>     Now Giles has a reason to get interested in the technology of the
20th Century.  He wants to see all of Bostock's films.  Like a fish out
of water he wades in to try to understand the intricacies of renting
films and of understanding the home video revolution.  He wants to see
every film ever made by Bostock.  And an unpromising assortment it is.
But Giles is unsatisfied by worshipping from afar.  Instead De'Ath
takes a holiday and hops a plane for the United States to find the
actor and then to insinuate himself into Bostock's life.  First he has
to find where Bostock lives.  Then he approaches first Bostock's live-
in girlfriend, Audrey (Fiona Loewi).  And finally he will move in on
Bostock himself.  None of this is easy for the man in both an
unfamiliar place and time.  Audrey is impressed by the stature of this
famous writer so fascinated by her boyfriend, but she little guesses
the trouble it can cause.</P>
<P>     The major attraction of the film is John Hurt's performance, which
manages to combine sinister and pitiable aspects.  He is a stalker
bedeviled by his ignorance of the modern world.  The film is an uneasy
mix of the resulting comic situations with the tragedy of the Thomas
Mann novel.  It is not clear how much comic potential this story could
have had, but Richard Kwietniowski's screenplay and direction seem
leaden.  The humor is just a bit off somehow.  Jason Priestley plays a
callow but empty actor whose questionable career echoes his Priestley's
own.  Fiona Loewi has a little more depth to her part, but it clearly
is Hurt's film for whatever he can salvage from it.</P>
<P>     The film is shot by Oliver Curtis who manages to give three
distinct visual styles to the film, one for London, one for Long
Island, and a third one for the excerpts we see of Bostock's crude
filmography.</P>
<PRE>     What we have is a bleak and downbeat comedy that never really gets
off the ground.  I rate it a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
