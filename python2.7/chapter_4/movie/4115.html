<PRE>                             KICKING AND SCREAMING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Opening night of the Austin Film Festival and Screenwriters'
Conference brought me this little gem, a story of five guys who just
got out of college, the three women that float amongst them, and the
question that haunts them all, "What the hell am I going to do with my
life?"</P>
<P>     I wouldn't look to KICKING AND SCREAMING for the answer.  Rather,
the movie is a hilarious example of what not to do when you graduate.
The guys, Chet (Eric Stoltz), Grover (Josh Hamilton), Max (Chris
Eigeman), Skippy (Jason Wiles), and the show-stealing Otis (Carlos
Jacott), can't seem to give up the college life.  They hang out at
college bars, woo freshmen, and sneak back into classes.  Otis can't
even seem to get out of his pajamas.</P>
<P>     Women are only half the problem.  Jane (Olivia d'Abo) is Grover's
lover, but she jets off for Prague after graduation, leaving Grover in
despair.  Miami (Parker Posey) is Skippy's trouble-prone, flighty
girlfriend.  And Kate (Cara Buono) is Max's latest attachment, a
cafeteria worker he picks up while haggling over an extra potato.</P>
<P>     The plot basically follows the series of perpetual indecisions
that plague the friends, an ironic reality that most of us seem to face
at some point in our lives.  The so-called "touching" moments are
unfortunately pretty drab, and the mushy flashbacks where Jane and
Grover's fledgling romance is built up are real snoozers.  The film is
rightfully a study of misery.  This happiness stuff just gets in the
way.</P>
<P>     The acting and direction by Noah Baumbach (who also wrote the
script) are perfectly dead-on.  Carlos Jacott should gain a lot of
notice (and at least one of the various movie awards) for his
outrageously droll part as Otis.  If the script had avoided the
over-sentimentality, the film would have been even better.  And oddly,
a real ending seems to be mysteriously lacking.</P>
<P>     KICKING AND SCREAMING pokes fun at the pretense and phoniness of
virtually every college clique imaginable.  If you're one of those
sensitive types, you'll probably be offended at some point along the
way.  But hey, look on the bright side, at least you'll have it better
than these guys.</P>
