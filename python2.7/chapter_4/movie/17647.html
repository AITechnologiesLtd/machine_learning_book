<PRE>JUHA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>At a time when American filmmakers like to dichotomize the film world
into teen comedies and action dramas, some of the foreign directors are
taking some pretty risky approaches.  Finnish writer and director Aki
Kaurismäki, for example, has just made a silent movie, JUHA, in a
handsome and highly detailed black and white.</P>
<P>Based on Juhani Aho's 1911 novel, JUHA is the novel's fourth film
adaptation.  Told with broad strokes, JUHA never tries to be more than
an enjoyable little parody.  Without a pretentious bone in its body, the
movie isn't strictly silent since its contains large helpings of
wonderfully over-the-top, melodramatic music, as well as a few hokey
sound effects.</P>
<P>As the story opens we meet a farmer named Juha, played with good-natured
innocence by Sakari Kuosmanen, and his wife, Marja (Kati Outinen).  The
big, beefy Juha has trouble getting through doorframes, and his bed is a
foot too short.  A powerful man, who walks with a limp, he drives an
ancient tractor.  His plain-Jane wife dresses herself to look like a
hag.</P>
<P>One day, Shemeikka (André Wilms), an old cad with thinning hair, who
fancies himself as some sort of playboy, stops at their farm.  It seems
his Corvette has broken down nearby.  Juha, uses his favorite wrench --
it's a 3-foot long classic that he sleeps with at night while his wife
sleeps on the floor --  to remove 4 of the pistons from Shemeikka's car.
This means they will have to ask the stranger to spend the night in
order to have time to get the proper parts.</P>
<P>Shemeikka starts making explicit overtures to Marja, who responds
hesitantly but warmly.  After his departure, she changes dramatically,
gussying herself up and limiting food preparation to microwaving
packaged meatballs.  This causes a hard rift in the family, especially
when the rogue returns.  The rest of the picture concerns his less than
honorable plans for Marja.</P>
<P>JUHA, which admittedly would have been better as a short, easily wins
over the audience with its simplistic charm.  It's a fun little film to
kick back and savor.</P>
<P>JUHA runs 1:18.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for mature themes,
sexual situations, and brief violence and would be fine for kids 12 and
up.</P>
