<PRE>                           THE PEACEMAKER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon

<P>After watching too many movies where the bad guys are the Russians, the
Chinese, the entire Eastern block and now the Bosnians, AND the good
guys are none other than the Americans (once again), I badly need to see
a movie where the American's lose big time. And I think the most likely
place to find the product of such a fantasy would most likely be in Iraq
i.e. Hussein productions. Not that I have anything against the Americans
winning all the time, but I'm in great need of a different perspective
on life.</P>
<P>Once again in this movie 'The Peacemaker' the safety of the United
States is once again under threat by some very angry Bosnians who blame
the US and the UN for their problems. This brings to mind that too often
repeated statement by Nicole Kidman - "I'm not afraid of the man who has
ten nuclear warheads, I'm afraid of the one who only wants one." My
trite reply to this is - "Give me ten nuclear warheads and I'll show you
who to be afraid of." I'm a peaceable, easy going kind of a guy, but in
this movie I had this incredible urge to want to see the terrorist
succeed. Of course I wouldn't want anyone injured, but I felt the dire
urge for the bomb to go off, and with it that grand delusion that the
United States is the greatest nation on this earth.</P>
<P>Of course I've seen New York, Washington and Dallas enveloped in flames
i.e. "Independence Day", but that doesn't really count. When the world
is under threat from big bad aliens, of course I'm going to side with
the Americans. So this new movie from SKG productions aims at the heart
of the great nation, drawing on the wild card of patriotism and a threat
to the people. It's a safe tactic to play when the plot and script isn't
solid engrossing material. The SKG team has decided on the leading man
for the moment (George Clooney) to help boost this movie's popularity
and banked on an actress who is both attractive and a constant solid
performer (Nicole Kidman). However, this does not save "The Peacemaker"
from its otherwise very ordinary make. The ending gets as improbable as
Nicole Kidman dismantling a nuclear device with a pen knife in 2.5
minutes; which is more ludicrous than an American President kicking butt
on a hijacked plane if you ask me.</P>
