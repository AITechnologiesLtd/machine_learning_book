<P>     While filming SMOKE, writer Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang
became aware that there was a wealth of untapped potential in the
secondary characters.  So, after devising a number of thumbnail sketches
for scenes, they approached Miramax to request funding for a second
movie.  The outcome is BLUE IN THE FACE, a low-budget companion piece to
SMOKE that was filmed in less than a week.</P>
<P>     BLUE IN THE FACE had no script and the direction by Auster and Wang
was minimal.  This resulted in an improvisational picture the likes of
which is rarely seen in theaters.  There is no plot to speak of--just
a series of disconnected vignettes.  The directors gathered their actors
together, started rolling the cameras, and told the men and women to
talk until they were "blue in the face."</P>
<P>     Those expecting something of the emotional and narrative depth of
SMOKE will be disappointed.  BLUE IN THE FACE is an entirely different
sort of film.  From start to finish, it's pure experimental fun--faux
cinema verite, philosophical ramblings, lengthy dialogue between
characters, musical interludes, and video inserts.  And, whereas SMOKE
was a drama, BLUE IN THE FACE is undeniably a comedy.</P>
<P>     The central element of BLUE IN THE FACE--the glue that holds
everything together--is an appreciation of Brooklyn.  During the
course of the film, we're exposed to the Brooklyn of the past, the
Brooklyn of today, and an idealized Brooklyn that exists only in
memories tinged by fondness and nostalgia.  BLUE IN THE FACE explores
the sense of community that makes this New York borough unique, and
examines how the loss of the Dodgers created a vacuum that nothing has
since filled.  There's also a discourse on Belgian waffles, the
"official" food of Brooklyn, which, as we learn, have little to do with
any food actually served in Belgium.</P>
<P>     The lack of continuity is one of BLUE IN THE FACE's charms.  At the
outset, Harvey Keitel comments, "I doubt any of this makes sense any
more..."  He's right, but it doesn't really matter.  The film is so
exuberant that we don't care whether we're listening to Lou Reed's
off-the-cuff comments about New York, watching Mel Gorham do a sexy
dance in front of a mirror, or hearing Jim Jarmusch's ramblings on the
romance of the smoking culture.  In every scene with every character,
you can feel the spontaneity.</P>
<P>     There are numerous cameos, most of which are successful.  Lily
Tomlin plays a man in search of Belgian waffles, Michael J. Fox is an
oddball survey taker, Victor Argo strums the guitar, and RuPaul comes
strolling by.  Not all the guest shots add value, however.  Madonna's
brief turn as a singing telegram messenger is superfluous, and Roseanne
displays an amazing lack of screen presence in her two scenes.  To
further highlight the TV star's lack of acting ability, she appears
opposite Keitel, who is in top form.</P>
<P>     Ignoring Roseanne (which is easy to do, since, mercifully, she's
not on screen for long), BLUE IN THE FACE has few missteps.  Sure, it's
a little raw, but polish is an undesirable quality in this kind of
production.  This film is designed simply to entertain--a task it sets
about in a most unconventional manner.  With BLUE IN THE FACE, Auster
and Wang may just be blowing smoke, but it's a colorful and aromatic
concoction.</P>
