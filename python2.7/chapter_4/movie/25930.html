BILLY ELLIOT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Stephen Daldry's BILLY ELLIOT, originally titled DANCER, can be thought 
of as an English working-class version of FLASHDANCE but without any of 
the latter's glitz and production numbers.  Telling the story of an 
11-year-old boy named Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) who cuts his boxing 
lessons in favor of ballet lessons with a bunch of girls in frilly 
tutus, the movie is a somber production that could stand to lighten up a 
bit.  Set against the grim background of a miners' strike in which his 
dad (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are participating, the movie 
wants to be as much a morality play as a dance movie.  And, of course, 
its surroundings will remind viewers of the setting for THE FULL MONTY.</P>
<P>Without his father's knowledge, Billy begins to spend his 50 pence not 
on boxing lessons for which they were intended on a ballet class run by 
the tough, chain-smoking and sarcastic Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).  
After asking her piano player to play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," 
she remarks, "Fat Chance!"  She almost immediately recognizes Billy's 
raw talent, figuring that he would make a prime candidate for the Royal 
Ballet School.  </P>
<P>The problem with the movie's choreography is that Billy, as he hams it 
up dancing and jumping around, is so awkward that it's hard for us to 
recognize the abilities that his teacher sees.  Moreover, his prancing 
around, which makes up large portions of the story, isn't that 
compelling.  It's rather like watching your neighbor's kids hamming it 
up in the living room.  Most of the picture has the boy leaping about 
joyously but stiffly.  These are heartfelt moments but not particularly 
convincing ones.  </P>
<P>Set in a dirt-poor area of County Durham in Northern England in 1984, 
the accents are so thick that you could cut them with a knife and so 
unintelligible at times that you'll wish that the picture had subtitles.  
The authentic dialog features the F-word in just about every sentence.  
It's a depressing tale with the inevitable light at the end of the 
tunnel, which is another of the film's problems.  No matter how 
depressingly bleak the situation, the story follows too predictable an 
arc.  The widower father is a completely angry caricature until, late in 
the picture, he makes the miraculous conversion that you can see coming 
a mile away.  </P>
<P>The early scene in which the father first finds out that his son has 
been spending the family's little disposable money on ballet lessons is 
dramatic.  Looking so red that he might ignite at any moment, he 
lectures his son, "Lads do boxing, and football, and wrestling, not 
friggin' ballet."</P>
<P>The supporting characters are little more than stick figures, which 
leaves the boy alone to carry the movie.  The young actor does his best, 
and, whereas we certainly root for his character, the movie is just too 
formulaic to be able to recommend it.  </P>
<P>BILLY ELLIOT runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language and would be 
acceptable for teenagers.  Younger than that is the parent's call, but 
since it was rated R only for language, we allowed our son to give it a 
try as he wanted to.  After all, it is a dancing movie about a boy his 
age.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, didn't like much about the movie and gave it * 
1/2.  He found the dialog hard to follow and felt the story got strained 
at several points.</P>
