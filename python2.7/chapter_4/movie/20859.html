DR. NO
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Endless trailers for THE PHANTOM MENACE were telling us that
every saga had a beginning. So was the case with the most
enduring and probably the longest-running movie franchise in
history - James Bond films. That series, that had spawned
eighteen (or nineteen, depending on the count) films through
almost four decades of its existence, was famous for its
successful and almost always winning formula - spectacular
action, exotic locations, plenty of beautiful (and
promiscuous) women and impressive villains with megalomaniac
ambitions. The formula didn't change through the years, but
almost everything else did, including the actors playing the
lead character. There were five of them, but almost everyone
agrees that the original one, Sean Connery, represents the
best incarnation of James Bond. The reputation of the lead
actor followed the movies that introduced him - first five
James Bond films are regarded as classics. On the other
hand, the first among those classics, DR. NO, directed by
Terrence Young in 1962, has relatively obscure reputation,
being either ignored or not favourably compared with the
other films of the series.</P>
<P>Relatively bad reputation of the film shouldn't be much of a
surprise, although DR. NO happened to be a huge commercial
hit in its time, big enough to launch both the series and
the stellar career of Sean Connery. It was made on
relatively low budget, with producers very doubtful of its
future potential. Ian Fleming, the creator of the character,
wasn't too thrilled about the producers' choice for the lead
role, preferring more established actors like David Niven,
Cary Grant or his own cousin Christopher Lee to relatively
unknown Scot like Connery. The movie wasn't even supposed to
be based on the novel DR. NO; producers had been forced to
abandon their original choice THUNDERBALL because of the
legal entanglements (that novel was later adapted twice). The
insecurity of its creators and the lack of budget (at least
relative to all the latter films) mirrored itself in the
film, although Young, as a capable director, managed to hide
most of it.</P>
<P>The plot begins in Jamaica, when British secret agent
Strangways and his secretary get killed by some mysterious
assassins. Chief of Secret Service, mysterious and grumpy M
(played by Bernard Lee) summons one of his best men, agent
James Bond (played by Connery), who is the perfect man for
this job, equipped not only with the superior training, but
also with the code name "007" with "00" that indicates the
license to kill enemy agents without any legal procedures.
As soon as Bond comes to Jamaica, he becomes the target of
various assassins. He survives all attempts on his life and
begins discovering the reasons why Strangways was killed.
They all have something to do with the radio signals that
sabotage American space program, and the source of this
signals is most likely Crab Key, isolated island owned by
mysterious Chinese character named Dr. No. After initial
suspicions, he is joining forces with CIA agent Felix Leiter
(played by Jack Lord), Bond and Leiter's assistant Quarrel
(played by John Kitzmiller) travel to the island to
investigate. There they stumble on Honey Ryder (played by
Ursulla Andress), voluptuous shell hunter that would help
them evade Dr. No's guards.</P>
<P>DR. NO has the every obligatory element of the Bond formula
(action, exotic women, locations, villains) and it is as
entertaining as an average Bond film, but something is
missing. First of all, film lacks spectacle usually
associated with the Bond classics. Jamaican locations and
characters seem somewhat too real, too ordinary and many
viewers, unaccustomed to Bond, would mistake this film for a
conventional spy thriller. Realistic tone of the movie is
also underlined with the use of local calypso music (which
is also a nice opportunity to hear Jamaican sounds before
that island became famous for its reggae.) Realism is here
partly due to a limited budget (legendary Pinewood studios
were used only for the last scenes of the film, with the
sets rather lame compared to the latter Bond adventures),
and partly due to Fleming being able to influence the film
more than in all latter films. As a result, even the Bond
character is closer to original Fleming's vision - he is
cynical and scruples when it comes to achieving his goals.
Contemporary moralists (including Vatican, which issued
official communique condemning the film) were outraged with
the scenes like Bond shooting helpless enemy in cold blood
or Bond having sex with a female enemy agents before turning
her to authorities. On the other hand, DR. NO is more
realistic than other Bond films because here 007 lacks his
usual spy gadgets and must rely solely on his wits in order
to survive. And the realism also works the other way around
- Bond is perhaps meaner than in other films, but he also
gets his comeuppance by having been tortured, beaten and
humiliated more than usual.</P>
<P>Sean Connery was, of course, splendid in the role that
clinched his career. His Bond is a classic Bond - stone-cold
deadly killer, intelligent yet witty and loveable, able to
bring every woman to his bed. First time we hear those
immortal words "Bond, James Bond" we hear the very same
confident voice that would be a trademark of this character
for decades to come. Connery's charm is unstoppable; because
of it, we are able to enjoy his presence and take for
granted lines that would otherwise sound ridiculous and
trashy. And the script by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood
and Berkley Maher was very suitable for Connery to show his
acting abilities; non-Superman Bond in DR.NO even has some
opportunity to express fear, panic and repulsion, something
we don't see very often in the latter incarnations of his
characters.</P>
<P>The other two obligatory characters - Bond's partner and
Bond's chief opponent - weren't that lucky. Many say that
Ursulla Andress, Swiss actress who had the honour of being
the very first Bond girl, actually happens to be the best
from the bunch. It is truth that the scene of bikini-clad
Honey Ryder coming out of sea really belongs among classic
Bond scenes. It is also truth that Ursulla Andress one of
the shinier careers among all the Bond girls. But her
character is ruined by the weak script and the writers not
able to decide whether to treat her as a tough woman and
equal partner to Bond, or just an ordinary damsel in
distress. Joseph Wiseman as enigmatic Dr. No is also very
good, but the script left too many plot holes concerning his
intentions and didn't really explain some of his actions.
The other characterisations are even worse - for example,
Quarrel as Bond's sidekick has a role that borders parody
and even some racial stereotyping. PC police of today
probably wouldn't appreciate the fact that the all the
villains, except one, happen to be dark-skinned or Asians.</P>
<P>DR. NO, seen by itself, is a still entertaining, but rather
inferior Bond film. However, since it was the first in the
series, it established the character of Bond, his
trademarks, recognisable musical theme by John Barry and
Monty Norman, and even some of the regular side characters
(M, Miss Moneypenny). All that makes it essential for all
those who want to be introduced to the series and all those
who are already fans of Bond films.</P>
