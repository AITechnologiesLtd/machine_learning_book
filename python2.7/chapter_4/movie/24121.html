<P>(Dialog in Vietnamese, English subtitles)</P>
<P>The climate of Vietnam passes through three seasons, and just as the
seasons endlessly disappear and return, so to the human spirit cycles
through periods of loss and redemption. This sentimental film follows
the parallel stories of several characters in Vietnam and details the
similar journeys of the different people.</P>
<P>The narrative is comprised of several distinct, and occasionally
intersecting stories. The first consists of a young woman who joins
the employ of a scholarly leper who raises and sells lotus flowers.
Another follows a former American Marine (Harvey Keitel) who has
returned to search for a daughter he abandoned years ago. Another
follows a young urchin who ekes a living by peddling trinkets. Another
presents a cyclo (cycle rickshaw driver) who yearns for a young woman
apparently unavailable to him.</P>
<P>The common element to the stories is that they all embody loss and
rejection. The Marine and the urchin depict people coping with loss,
and the flower seller and the cyclo embody the power of redemption.
The narrative deftly cycles between the subplots, and tempers the
drama of each with the context switches. The characters are well
drawn. It is obvious that they all have a past, but exactly what it is
is implied, and left as an exercise for the viewer. This is the
antithesis of formulaic filmmaking, where the story overexposes its
character to make up for a lack of depth.</P>
<P>When presenting a story with such weighty themes, a weak film will get
bogged down by melodrama. Filmmaker Tony Bui avoids this trap by not
overstating the emotions that are presented. The actions and events
are neither extreme nor manipulative. The film successfully uses
subtlety and symbolism to craft a moving story.</P>
<P>The film is both well written and well acted. Its only real flaw is
that at times it relies on stereotypical characters, and one cliche
relationship. However, it generally avoids convenient resolutions, and
thus remains an enjoyable film.</P>
<P>Recommended. This is a slow, sentimental film that is captivating. The
beautiful cinematography captures the oppressive heat, the drenching
rain, and natural beauty of Vietnam. Its symbolic stories also reflect
the power of the human soul, and its ability to persevere. Although it
has shortcomings, it is a moving and pleasant film.</P>
