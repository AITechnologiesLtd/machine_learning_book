<P>Let me begin this review by saying that I am a huge fan of professional 
wrestling, and
I'm not ashamed to say it. I'm not too fond of Ted Turner's World 
Championship Wrestling,
however, and after this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie they 
have put out, I have 
even less respect for them.</P>
<P>Gordie Boggs (Arquette, aptly cast as a moron, as he is one) and his 
best friend Sean Dawkins 
(Scott Caan. The son of James Caan should not be reduced to garbage like 
this!) are two losers from 
Wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends, who look up to World 
Championship Wrestling champion 
Jimmy King (a terribly casted Oliver Platt), as he is everything they 
are not. They finally 
get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil, 
ruthless promoter Titus 
Sinclair (a wasted Palitaliano, in a role originally meant for real-life 
WCW President Eric 
Bischoff, whose name was written all over the role!). Gordie and Sean 
track down King in 
Atlanta and discover that he is not really the English king the WCW 
writers created for him, 
but a drunken, ignorant Southerner who is as irritated by these two 
lunkheads as Bob Newhart 
was by Larry, Darryl, and Darryl. They sneak him back onto WCW TV, after 
which Sinclair 
agrees to book him in a steel cage match in Las Vegas at WCW's next 
pay-per-view, against 
his rival, Diamond Dallas Page. If he wins, King gets his title and his 
career back, plus one 
million dollars. </P>
<P>WCW President Eric Bischoff, knowing his promotion was desperate with 
bad writing and ratings
skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior World Wrestling Federation, 
came up with the idea
for this movie hoping it would save WCW. He was then fired and rehired 
two months ago, but by the 
time he'd left, they had already been contracted to do the film, and 
Bischoff could not play Sinclair 
(which, in itself, is for the best, as anybody who has seen him on WCW 
programming knows that 
Bischoff is NO actor!). The characters of Gordie and Sean show you 
exactly what Eric Bischoff
thinks of his fans. He thinks of them as young, dumb pathetic idiots who 
will believe anything 
that will be put out in front of them is real. That is why he doesn't 
take the fans into 
consideration when he books a Nitro or a pay-per-view. I have news for 
you, Eric: NO wrestling fan in
this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling 
isn't for show, unless they 
are four years old. This is 2000, you know, not 1985. Bischoff will try 
to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy, but I have no 
doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic, ROCKY-style
film (which it probably should have been. Professional wrestling is 
ridiculed enough as it is, why 
should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy?), Gordie and 
Sean would have been
portrayed in the same light.</P>
<P>Anybody who has seen the documentary WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS, documenting 
WWF owner Vince McMahon's
double-crossing of Bret Hart, will probably realize via the reviews and 
previews of READY TO 
RUMBLE, that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the 
poor man's Wayne and
Garth thrown in for comedic affect. You can tell Titus Sinclair is 
supposed to poke fun at
Vince, but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that Sinclair is more 
inspired by Bischoff
than Vince, and that Vince did what he had to do to Bret Hart. All of 
these aspects of the film,
needless to say, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan.</P>
<P>Another thing I found disturbing about the film was the romance between 
Gordie and Nitro Girl
Sasha (The lovely Rose McGowan). Wouldn't it have been easier to bring 
something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only 
working on Gordie at Sinclair's insistance? I hate that cliche!</P>
<P>The World Wrestling Federation would have made a better film. They are 
the promotion everyone
cares about, they are winning the ratings, they have better wrestlers, 
and they take their fans
into consideration and don't treat fans like morons. So, Vince, how 
about a movie?</P>
