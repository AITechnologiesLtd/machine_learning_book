As reviewed by James Brundage
It was the end of an era. The year was 1992 and the movie was Batman
Returns. It marked the end of the Batman franchise as a series of good
movies. It was, friends, the last great Batman.</P>
<P>Gotham was dark and so was the script. Darkly comic, darkly romantic, and
darkly dramatic. This tale told of Michael Keaton as Batman in a love/hate
relationship with Catwoman, of a freak raised by penguins, of a power hungry
industry giant who sought to leave the legacy of a polluting power plant.
The Penguin: a man raised by what became his namesake, seeks to discover the
identity of his parents, and then exact vengeance upon the world. Selina
Kyle was a lowly secretary who got pushed out of a window for opening her
mouth: exhausting one of nine lives, and then becoming Catwoman. And Bruce
Wayne was a man haunted by his past and compelled to fight crime at night as
Batman.</P>
<P>Bruce Wayne's and Selina Kyle's lives intersect… twice, once as two normal
people falling in love and again as Batman and Catwoman, trying to decide
whether to sleep together or kill each other. The dark comedy that ensues by
this is only the beginning. A smartly written script care of Daniel Waters
(Demolition Man) also gives us such scenes as the Batmobile being driver
from the campaign trailer of Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin… right into every
civilian in sight.</P>
<P>On the action level, this film exceeds its sequels and matches its
predecessor, having good old Batman go for the gut with every punch. On the
plotline, the same occurs. The performances are the fine things we expect to
see from Tim Burton. The directing: the same darkly satiric motif we have
always known with him.</P>
<P>But what makes Batman Returns worth watching, aside from all of this, is the
foreknowledge of what happened after. Joel Shumaker took over the Batman
franchise and turned Gotham into a bright, sunny place. After Batman
Returns, the franchise turned to crap. So, if you're a current Batman fan,
see it for a glimpse of the better past, and, if you haven't seen it, see it
for the opportunity to show why its so much better than the modern day sunny
Jewel-on-the-soundtrack Batman.</P>
