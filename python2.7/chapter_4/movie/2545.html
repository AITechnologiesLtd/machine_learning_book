                                   WITH HONORS 
                       A Film Review by Michael J. Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael J. Legeros</PRE>
<P>Forget that the ads hint at something more silly, WITH HONORS is a calm 
college comedy cum drama about a homeless man (Joe Pesci) who enters the 
lives of four Harvard roommates (Brendan Fraiser, Moria Kelly, Patrick 
Dempsey, and Josh Hamilton).</P>
<P>The plot device is a 100-page thesis, lost by Monty (Fraiser) and rescued 
by Simon (Pesci), a "financially challenged" individual who lives under 
the college library. Simon offers a trade: one page for one favor.  Said 
favors range from a "pristine glazed donut" to a place to stay for the 
winter. In comes the bum, out comes astonishment (from Monty's roomies) 
and everyone ends up with a squishy life-lesson for their troubles.</P>
<P>William Mastrosimone's dialogue is rather ripe, but director Alek 
Keshishian (TRUTH OR DARE) keep a tight reign on both the tone and Pesci. 
The diminutive Oscar-winner doesn't have much room to expand, much less 
scene-steal, and that's probably the point. At least up until a cornball 
ending which reunites the bum with his son.  P-l-e-a-s-e.</P>
<P>Watch for Gore Vidal, a stitch as a Monty's mentor. A sample of his 
dialogue : "I don't agree with what your brain has produced."</P>
<P>If nothing else, WITH HONORS makes a pleasing alternative to the abandon-
hope-all-ye-under-30 outlook portrayed in REALITY BITES.</P>
