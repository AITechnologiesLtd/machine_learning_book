<PRE>CITY OF ANGELS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>How many days have you watched the sun rise and fall?  What does a pear
taste like?  How does a kiss feel from the one you love?  What does the
touch of a hand on your hand feel like?  What is it like to love?  When you
die, what will be the best thing about your life?</P>
<P>Seth, the angel from City of Angels, wonders all of these things.  Angels
are fearless, can't feel pain, are not afraid of heights and live for
eternity.  But what good is eternity if you can't be with the one you love?
 Or as Seth puts it, "What good would wings be if you couldn't feel the
wind on your face?"</P>
<P>One day a heart surgeon, Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan), is working on a patient.
She's almost finished when the patient suddenly dies.  Watching over this
event is the benevolent angel, Seth (Nicolas Cage).  Seth is so emotionally
thrown by this event that he suddenly becomes visible to Maggie.</P>
<P>Seth wonders why she saw him.  He also finds himself in love with Maggie,
and returns to the hospital to follow her around, watching Maggie in
distress. Seth finds himself increasingly attracted to Maggie.  Then one
day he makes himself visible to Maggie and tries to ease her pain.  Just
how well could a relationship between an angel and a human work?  Seth
finds out from a former angel that he has a choice to be human.  But, in
order to be human Seth needs to take a fall from Heaven and give up his
eternal life.</P>
<P>City of Angels is not a spiritual film nor does it have any deep insights
into the "life" of angels.  It is a near-formulaic tearjerker and works for
only one reason:  Meg Ryan, who is radiant in her part as Maggie.  This has
to be her best work since Courage Under Fire.  It is Ryan that makes the
story wonderful.  Ryan brings us into the love story and we do start to
care for her Maggie much more than we do for Cage's Seth.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage, who has been toting guns lately (The Rock, Con Air,
Face/Off), takes a break from the macho side of celluloid to return to some
familiar ground.  His portrayal of Seth the angel is not as good as it
should have been. Cage spends too much time with puppy dog eyes and a soft
voice.  He seems just too mellow as the angel Seth. </P>
<P>There are many things worth mentioning about City of Angels.  First off is
the ethereal and stylish cinematography by John Seale (The English
Patient).  Seale films Los Angeles in such a fashion that what could look
stale and flat now looks dynamic and large.  The shots of solitary angels
standing in high places are just wondrous.  Kudos to John Seale for
bringing such a different look to Los Angeles.  Please look for the scenes
in which angels congregate at the beach for sunrise and sunset.  These are
the most inspiring images that the film contains. </P>
<P>Worth mentioning is Andre Braugher from TVs "Homicide."  Braugher, as the
angel Cassiel, puts in a better angel performance than Cage.  Dennis Franz
from TVs "NYPD Blue" makes an appearance in City of Angels and, next to Meg
Ryan, his is the best performance in the whole film.  </P>
<P>The score by Gabriel Yared is haunting and memorable.  In addition, the
music by other artists fits the film well.  Listen for Alanis Morissette's
"Uninvited."</P>
<P>I didn't care for one flaw.  It's not a huge flaw, but it is noticeable.
The "twist" at the end is set up mechanically from the beginning of the
film and I continued to wonder when it would happen.  This renders the
ending unclimactic, and I would have liked the film to end a few minutes
earlier.  However, as Cassiel reminds Seth, "That's living."</P>
<P>The script, written by Dana Stevens, is based on Wings of Desire, a 1988
film by Wim Wenders.  I have not seen Wings of Desire so I can't comment on
how these two films differ.</P>
<P>City of Angels is one of the best angel movies to be released lately.  I
admit that the film tugged a few tears from me.  See City of Angels for the
wondrous imagery and for Meg Ryan.  Don't Miss City of Angels on the big
screen and bring a loved one to see it with you; this is definitely a date
film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch the sun go down.</P>
