<P>When it was released in the spring of 1989, 'Field of Dreams' was a
film that people talked about until the very next year when the film
received three Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Screenplay
Adaptation and Best Original Score.  A movie theatre manager at the
time, I can recall people's acute observations on the film.  One
gentleman commented that after seeing the film, "You wanted everybody
in the world to be your friend".  The film managed to find a theatre
in my city that would show it for practically the entire year leading
up to its Oscar race, and it eventually came away empty handed from
the Academy.  Perhaps the most preposterous shut out was in the Best
Original Score category when Disney's easily forgettable score to 'The
Little Mermaid' beat James Horner's lovely and emotionally feel good
notes.  It looks like Horner is poised to receive a long overdue Oscar
for the 'Titanic' score, but that remains to be seen.</P>
<P>Acutely obvious but not easily done by other films, 'Field of Dreams'
rides a wave of continued success for its overbearing simplicity.  As
the 1998 baseball season is about to get underway in less than a
month, 'Field of Dreams' is a classic motion picture that commands
every baseball fan to see it.</P>
<P>Written for the screen by its director Phil Alden Robinson, based on
the book Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella, the phenomenal success the
film enjoyed was derived from the fact that you didn't have to be a
baseball fan to enjoy it and it appealed to people from all walks of
life.  Baseball was used only as a metaphor to enhance the story of
one man's search for redemption and finding it in a baseball field he
builds by sacrificing some of his rich farmland in the heart of Iowa
after a strange voice tells him "if you build it, he will come".</P>
<P>Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) was a man always fascinated by the
greatest game in the world, baseball.  It was one of the things that
kept him going but also reminded him of the painful relationship he
shared with his father, deceased in the film, and how an ugly exchange
of words forced Ray and his father to become alienated from each other
over a disagreement about the status of 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson,
portrayed in 'Field of Dreams' by Ray Liotta.</P>
<P>Jackson had been a player banned from baseball for life for throwing a
World Series in the era of Babe Ruth (Ruth saved baseball after the
scandal by being a top drawing card of the sport and symbolizing all
that good about baseball) and the detailed examination of the infamous
Black Sox scandal can be seen in the brilliant film 'Eight Men Out'
(1988) from director John Sayles.  Ray took exception to the fact that
'Shoeless' Joe had been his father's hero and said he "couldn't
respect a man whose hero was a criminal".</P>
<P>Ray is excited that spirits from the past other than 'Shoeless' Joe
have also come to his Iowa baseball field to play ball.  One early
evening, Ray hears the mysterious voice again, the same one that
inspired him to build the baseball surface, and this time it tells Ray
to "ease his pain".  This leads Ray to Boston where he makes contact
with Terence Mann, played splendidly by James Earl Jones.  The two of
them form an awkward relationship and travel to Minnesota to find a
former baseball player turned physician (Burt Lancaster in his last
big screen appearance).</P>
<P>The clever thing about 'Field of Dreams' is that it seems to have no
point until the film's final scene when it all becomes clear.  The
film's dreamlike atmosphere and fantasy enhanced theme, displayed in a
perfect flow of emotion from start to finish are symbolic to the very
essence of its genre.</P>
