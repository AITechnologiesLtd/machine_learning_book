<P>     As a young boy, Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton), an aspiring
writer, develops a brain tumor.  When he's wheeled into the operating
room and his skull is opened, the tumor turns out to be the undeveloped
remains of a twin that Thad had incorporated into himself while still
in the womb.  Over twenty years later, Thad is a successful writer with
a wife named Liz (Amy Madigan) and two infant children.  The books he
writes under his own name are "literate," but to keep his income up, he
writes violent, formula fiction under the pseudonym of George Stark.
When a blackmailer threatens to reveal his double identity and threaten
the profitable secret, Beaumont goes public himself, "burying" George
Stark.  That's when the murders start.  As the body count mounts,
Beaumont becomes the prime suspect--his fingerprints have been found
in the victims' blood--but Thad has no idea what's going on.  The
question that needs to be answered is whether Thad has a split
personality or whether there is some sort of evil entity--connected to
Thad--is loose in the world.</P>
<P>     Recently, when it comes to movies, everything the name Stephen
King has been associated with has turned to dross.  In some cases, King
has denied any association with the productions (PET SEMATARY TWO, THE
LAWNMOWER MAN), but he was much in evidence in one of 1992's worst
films, SLEEPWALKERS.  Now, King's name is back on the marquee with THE
DARK HALF and, while this isn't a masterpiece of the genre, it's an
often-entertaining and sometimes-intelligent production.</P>
<P>     George Romero, an accomplished horror film director, is at the
helm for this movie, and it's undoubtedly his skill that prevents THE
DARK HALF from sinking into the realm of the unwatchable.  It's easy to
see how this could have happened, but Romero is able to keep the
characters real and the situations (mostly) believable where a lesser
filmmaker might have botched things up.</P>
<P>     Key to the success of THE DARK HALF, as is the case with almost
every horror film, is the need to suspend disbelief, and it is here is
where the movie stumbles.  The setup, as well as most of the every-day
character interaction, is so normal and "real" that when the
consideration of a supernatural explanation arises, it becomes a little
difficult for the audience to swallow.  Had Romero created a slightly
more skewed vision of America (akin to David Lynch's towns in BLUE
VELVET and TWIN PEAKS), the eventual transition might have been easier
to accept.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, there's a lot that's positive about THE DARK HALF in
its examination of a Jekyll and Hyde personality.  While the resolution
is pure formula (not to mention more than a little silly), the events
leading up to it are not.  For roughly the first hour of the feature,
we're treated to a slick psychological thriller and a whodunnit all
rolled into one.  The characters are well-written and well-developed,
the cinematography is effective, and the special effects are a cut
above the norm.</P>
<P>     Timothy Hutton, who's other recent role in THE TEMP was an
unmitigated disaster, shows excellent range here.  Amy Madigan brings
some personality to the thankless role of "the wife."  If there's a
sub-par performance, it belongs to Michael Rooker as the local sheriff,
but even his acting is far better than most of what emerges in typical
films of the genre.</P>
<P>     While there's little doubt that most Stephen King fans and lovers
of horror movies in general will enjoy this film, there's enough in THE
DARK HALF to attract a wider audience.  The gore is not excessive and a
successful effort has been made to keep the picture from collapsing
into a grade-B flick.  While this isn't a complete comeback for screen
adaptations of King's work, it's a worthwhile step.</P>
