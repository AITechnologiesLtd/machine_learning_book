<P>AIRPLANE! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making.
After all, it's brought to us by one of the best known satire
writing/directing teams. Even if most people don't recognize the names behind
the films, they are bound to recognize the titles: AIRPLANE!, TOP SECRET, THE
NAKED GUN, and HOT SHOTS to name a few. But although the
Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team was first introduced with THE KENTUCKY FRIED
MOVIE in 1977, AIRPLANE! remains the true cornerstone of their work, and
their directorial debuts.</P>
<P>In the seventies, disaster films seemed to be at an all time high. Films like
EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE were big hits.
There was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by
plane - a series that spanned the entire decade. And so, in 1980, we were
introduced to a new airplane disaster film. This time the disaster had
nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . . it
had to do with bad fish.</P>
<P>AIRPLANE! is the story of Ted Striker (Robert Hays) - an ex-fighter-pilot who
has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of
war led to the death of six, er, seven comrades. Unable to stop living in the
past, Ted's world fell apart. He spent his time moving from city to city
without ever having a stable job, and eventually, as we begin this film, is
getting dumped by his lover, flight attendant Elaine Dickinson (Julie
Hagerty).</P>
<P>In a desperate attempt not to lose her, Ted buys a ticket for the same flight
Elaine is working. Unfortunately, she is unsympathetic and even criticizes
Ted for following her, which leaves him wallowing in self-pity. In the midst
of it all, something happens. Someone gets sick. Then another. Then another.
Soon, the whole plane is full of deathly-ill Chicago-bound people . . . and
when the pilots get sick (played by Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and
Frank Ashmore), who will save the day? (Gee, I wonder)</P>
<P>Of course the main draw here is the non-stop "whiz-bang" comedy, with a hefty
dose of both visual and spoken gags. Although I had seen this movie a few
times before, I was still laughing thru the entire thing. The most fun
character by far is the doctor, played by Leslie Nielsen. He's a dry, subtle,
sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest
lines of the film.</P>
<P>In a film like this, you're not really expecting an elaborate production, so
one can't complain about the amateurish quality. What you can complain about
is the absolutely annoying Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker. This character
is pointless, nauseating, and very unfunny. I don't know why he was put in
there, and I don't think anybody will find a good excuse. And when the film
nears an end, it slows down quite a bit, almost getting old. You gotta give
it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long. Aside
from that, AIRPLANE! is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be
known as a spoof classic. It would be a good choice to pop in the VCR with a
group of friends, especially if they haven't seen it. And if they ask what
the plot is, just tell 'em "It's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the
film, but that's not important right now." If you've seen the film, you'll
understand ;-)</P>
