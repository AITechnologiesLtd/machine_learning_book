<PRE>BREAKING THE WAVES (1996)</PRE>
<P>For all of my admiration of the work of director Lars Von Trier
(particularly ZENTROPA, in my opinion one of the most visually
enveloping films of the last decade), I've always been left with a
slightly chilly feeling, as if the director had expended so much care
and energy on the look and texture of his films that he forgot to
include emotional content. After seeing Von Trier's new masterpiece,
I'm pleased to report that my worries have been put to rest; in every
regard, this was the most deeply felt film of 1996, with an
astonishing performance by Oscar-nominated newcomer Emily Watson. (I
wasn't all that surprised when Watson failed to win the award; her
performance was entirely too bold and uncompromising for the Academy
to feel comfortable with.)  Visually, Von Trier is still up to his old
tricks (using a technique that he pioneered in his epic haunted
hospital miniseries THE KINGDOM, the image was transferred through
several different formats of film stock and video, resulting in a
picture that is constantly shifting in quality - sometimes
intriguingly washed-out, sometimes painfully clear), but rather than
distracting the viewer, the results serve to instead blur the
boundaries between reality and fiction, further drawing the audience
into the events on screen.  This is a film that should probably be
experienced without knowing too much in advance, so just let me say
that, much like the long-suffering heroine, it is necessary to get
through some excruciating scenes before reaching the transcendent
finale (this is rated `R' for a reason, folks!) but stick with it if
you can, you won't soon forget it.</P>
