Grade:  C-</PRE>
<P>Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) cleans fish tanks.  Yeah, I didn't know that was
a real job either.  One of his customers is Antoine LeConte (Oded Fehr), a
successful gigolo.  When Antoine has to go to Sweden for three weeks, he lets
Deuce use his house to look after an ailing $800 fish.  Fooling around, Deuce
sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a $6000 fish tank.  After taking a try at
one of Antoine's clients and earning $10, Deuce decides to prostitute himself
to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fiery-tempered Antoine
returns.  </P>
<P>Enter T. J. (Eddie Griffin), a pimp for "man-whores," who arranges for Deuce to
service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating. 
There's an enormous woman (played by transvestite porn star Chi Chi La Rue) who
hides food in her clothes.  There's Claire (Gail O'Grady) whose narcolepsy
causes her to fall asleep every few minutes.  Tina (Torsten Voges) is so tall
her face doesn't fit on the screen, and Ruth (Amy Poehler) has Tourette's
Syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning.  Finally there's Kate (Arija
Bareikis) whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare.  She seems perfect,
and Deuce quickly falls in love with her.  (She does, we discover later, have
an imperfection, but Deuce decides it isn't important.)</P>
<P>Deuce's life is complicated by a bothersome cop (William Forsythe) looking for
information on Antoine and by Kate's discovery of his man-whoring.  However,
neither threat generates much suspense.  The formula is so familiar that we
know how it will end from the start.</P>
<P>"Deuce Bigalow" is the first project from Adam Sandler's company Happy Madison,
the formation of which assures that we'll be seeing the Sandler style of comedy
mass-produced at an increasing rate in years to come.  Be afraid.  Be very
afraid.  </P>
<P>The good news is that Sandler doesn't actually appear in "Deuce" and that Rob
Schneider and Eddie Griffin are funnier than Sandler.  Schneider has a
sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted Deuce believable.  Griffin's
delivery is dead-on, especially in the coining of "technical terms" for T. J.'s
profession, as in "Don't make me he-bitch man-slap you!"</P>
<P>There's the expected amount of toilet humor in "Deuce."  (For one thing,
Deuce's dad is a men's room attendant).  Does anyone over the age of eight
actually find bowel movements that funny?  For most of us, I think that
childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side
of puberty and discover how funny sex is.  I, for one, will be glad when the
toilet trend is finally flushed.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  "Deuce" doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently
funny.</P>
