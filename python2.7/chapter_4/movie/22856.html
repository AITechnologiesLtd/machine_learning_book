<PRE>Down To You  * *  (out of * * * *)
Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>Rated PG-13 (brief graphic language, other mild language, sensuality and
related themes), 100 minutes, 2000. Miramax. Freddie Prinze, Jr, Julia Stiles,
Henry Winkler, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Selma Blair, Ashton Kutcher, Rosario
Dawson. Directed by Kris Isacsson.</P>
<P>When he defined morality, Hemmingway said that if you felt good after doing
something it was fundamentally good, and if you felt badly it was fundamentally
evil. I felt bad after watching Down To You. Hyperbole, you say? Yes, of
course, I retort, but youâ€™ll thank me in the end.</P>
<P>Maybe it was that neither of these characters are especially good people that
we can even begin to care about. Maybe it was that they did and said wretched
things to one another throughout the course of what some critics are calling
The Story Of Us-lite. Maybe itâ€™s that the screenplay isnâ€™t the least bit
involving, or original, and instead volunteers tired teen and college clichÃ©s.
But, even after all that, Iâ€™m pretty sure it was the ending.</P>
<P>Down To You begins and develops in what is becoming a much too common way to
tie up your narrative. It must have been in the latest edition of "How to Write
The Great American Screenplay," or something. The characters speak directly to
camera (which, you would think, would be weird to the people around them; see
Wayneâ€™s World for the real way to do this) and relate their trite and
exhausted tale of romance passed.</P>
<P>Al, played by the incomprehensibly effete Freddie Prinze, Jr., begins weaving
the story of how they met, his "first love," he says. Cut to a bar a couple of
years back, Alâ€™s in his sophomore year of college, sitting in a booth at a
bar ("We thought it was cool â€˜cause they didnâ€™t check I.D.") discussing
with a friend the latterâ€™s venture into the porn industry, and another friend
who wants to get into the business through this guy, Monkâ€™s, connections. (A
timeline in the forthcoming relationship is basically provided by how far up
the ladder Monk travels in the industry: first low-key star, then director,
then withdrawalâ€'like Boogie Nights for the kiddies.)</P>
<P>Anyway, somehow Al catches a glance at Imogen (Julia Stiles, not as clever or
quick witted here as her heroine of last yearâ€™s 10 Things I Hate About You,
although that film earned the same two-and-a-half stars), a freshman who spends
a lot of time drinking and doing drugs (not always on screen), but is somehow
constantly sober enough to pop out the occasional one-liner. They start
talkingâ€'something about Patsy Clineâ€'and eventually begin dating. There are
a few useless subplots, like constant flirtation between Monkâ€™s co-stars and
Al, problems between Al and his dad (Henry Winkler), etc., etc. But mainly the
movie centers on the budding relationship of Prinze, Jr. and Stiles. </P>
<P>Things start off well, but then itâ€™s like a three-year-old with access to a
light switch. On and off. On and off. The bickering never ceases, and neither
does the making up, which, according to Al, is when "it feels best" to be with
her. So we get into this constant cycle, allowing them to have their odd little
"relationship high," cursing and blaming one another just to get back to making
up. Then it starts to fall apart, and after seeing these people fight for 90
minutes we finally get to see what we know would, at long last, make them just
shut up so we can go home. And then, ugh, the Hollywood clichÃ© machine kicks
into gear, tosses us our happy ending, and says "everything will be all right
now, you can go".</P>
<P>Watching Down To You, which is the directorial debut of Kris Isacsson, I came
to realize what Hollywood is missing out on. When I saw the ultimately
disappointing 10 Things I Hate About You, I celebrated the performance of Larry
Miller, who played the concerned father of two teenage girls. Here, I noted the
dazzling performance of Henry Winkler. And while Winklerâ€™s role is not as
well written as Millerâ€™s, it came to me. What we need is not a movie about
teenagers starring teenagers, but rather a movie about teenagers starring
parents, because, apparently, they lead lives which are much more interesting
and creative than their children. At least then, rather than lamenting over the
silly college affairs of immature losers we could go behind-the-scenes of a
t.v. show Winkler pitches as an on-air chef: "Cooks." Like "Cops", but not.</P>
