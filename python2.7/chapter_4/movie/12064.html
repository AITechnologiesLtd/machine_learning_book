<PRE>"The Gingerbread Man" (USA, 1998)
A Film Review by James Kendrick
***1/2 (out of ****)<HR></PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Altman || Screenplay: Robert Altman (based on an
original story by John Grisham) || Stars: Kenneth Branagh (Rick
Magruder), Embeth Davidtz (Mallory Doss), Robert Downey Jr.
(Clyde Pell), Daryl Hannah (Lois Harlan), Robert Duvall (Dixon
Doss), Tom Berenger (Pete Randle), Famke Janssen (Leeanne), Jesse
James (Jeff), Mae Whitman (Libby) || MPAA Rating: R<HR></P>
<P>Whenever writer/director Robert Altman works in a specific genre,
he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms. He made the
West dirty in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (1971), he parodied
hard-boiled detective stories in "The Long Goodbye" (1973), and
he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "Popeye"
(1980). The same holds true for his most recent film, "The
Gingerbread Man," which reinvents a genre that has developed at
an exponential rate over the last five years: the John Grisham
Movie.</P>
<P>By the time "The Gingerbread Man" was completed, there was very
little evidence that it was ever based on a story by Grisham.
There's no idealist young lawyer ala Tom Cruise, Matthew
McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell or Matt Damon, and it doesn't
feature a great showdown in a courtroom. Instead of being a grand
ode to the powers of the legal profession, "The Gingerbread Man"
is a rain-soaked, Southern Gothic noir thriller with wildly
eccentric characters, a twisting plot line, black humor, a
somewhat bleak ending, and even Altman's trademark full-frontal
female nudity.</P>
<P>The central character of the film is Rick Magruder, who is unlike
any of Grisham's other lawyer heroes. He is older, experienced,
and rich; he drives a cherry-red $80,000 Mercedes that never gets
dirty, even in the incessantly pouring rain of Savannah, Georgia,
where the story unfolds. Rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce
with his wife, Leeanne (Famke Janssen), and he rarely gets to see
his two children, Jeff (Jesse James) and Libby (Mae Whitman). A
reason is never given for the divorce, but it isn't hard to
surmise that Rick's womanizing had a large part in it. Whenever
he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days, Leeanne
always assumes it's because he's been "screwing around."</P>
<P>After an office party celebrating another of his court victories
(he hasn't lost in eight years), Rick becomes involved with
Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz), one of the catering waitresses. He
drives her home because her car has been stolen, and they end up
in bed together. Rick finds out that Mallory is being terrorized
and stalked by her slightly psychotic father, Dixon Doss (Robert
Duvall), a grungy, stringy, bare-footed old man who leads a
commune of other greasy old codgers. It was actually Dixon who
stole her car that night, and when Rick asks why, Mallory replies
that he always does "weird" stuff like that. As another character
puts it, Dixon is "a few beers short of six-pack."</P>
<P>Rick ends up convincing Mallory to have Dixon brought to court
and tried for competency. He succeeds with information dug up by
Clyde Pell, a private investigator friend (Robert Downey Jr.),
and testimony from Mallory's begrudging ex-husband, Pete Randle
(Tom Berenger). Dixon is put in a mental hospital, but his
commune buddies succeed in breaking him out. From there, the
story delves into kidnapping, murder, double-crossing, and even a
hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the
action.</P>
<P>Altman's cinematographer, Changwei Gu, gives the film a dark,
soaked look. If it isn't night-time, at least it's raining. Gu
shoots the interiors, which are almost all dark wood paneling,
with a minimum of light. A great deal of the action takes place
in the leafy Georgia backwoods, which Altman uses to create an
acute sense of dread and vulnerability. In the city there is
danger enough, but when Rick has to venture into the woods, you
can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he
literally enters another world.</P>
<P>Altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre, from
westerns to epic dramas to comedies. But, no matter what the
genre, he is always sure to give it the Altman stamp, which
usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little
details that are often missed without repeat viewings. "The
Gingerbread Man" is no different, although his style is much more
restrained here. However, without those little touches, the film
could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller.</P>
<P>A great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to
the actors, especially Branagh, who rarely works outside of
period pieces and his own direction. Here, the British actor
consistently maintains a serviceable Southern drawl, while making
an essentially contemptible character interesting and
sympathetic. Rick is an extremely flawed man, but Branaugh brings
real humanity to his character. Without it, the entire film would
fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience
feeling Rick's pain and frustration.</P>
<P>The supporting actors also put in fine performances, including
Embeth Davidtz, who is probably best known for her heart-breaking
role as the Jewish maid in "Schindler's List" (1993). Tom
Berenger provides some gruff comic relief, and Robert Duvall
spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird. It doesn't
seem like he does much because he has very little spoken
dialogue, but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom
scene: his entire performance is in his eyes and his body
language, and few actors could have pulled it off without being
either silly or overbearing.</P>
<P>While "The Gingerbread Man" isn't in league with Altman's
greatest works like "Nashville" (1975) or "The Player" (1992), it
is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking, which may prove
a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career. Some
critics love to stamp films like this as "commercial," as if
Altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are
aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money. Altman has done
something much better: he took what could have been a generic
movie, and by investing artistry and effort, he made it into
something more.</P>
