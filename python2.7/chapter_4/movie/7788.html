<P>The Lost World: Jurassic Park (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>On paper, Steven Spielberg's The Lost World: Jurassic Park has the
makings of a vast improvement over the entertaining but wildly overrated
original film: the most remotely interesting human in the original cast,
Jeff Goldblum, is the only major returnee; the blah Laura Dern and Sam Neill
are supplanted by the vastly more interesting Julianne Moore and Vince
Vaughn;  a wider menagerie of dinosaurs is featured; there are enhanced
dinosaur effects; and all of the necessary exposition is already covered in
the first film.  Yet despite all of the basic improvements going into the
production, the perfectly entertaining finished product still somehow
manages to fall short of the original film.</P>
<P>This time around, Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) very reluctantly joins
girlfriend and paleontologist Sarah Harding (Moore), environmentalist
videographer Nick Van Owen (Vaughn) on an expedition to Site B, a second
dinosaur-populated island, where the creatures were bred for the ill-fated
Jurassic Park.  Add a child stowaway for the trip--in this case, Malcolm's
daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester)--and you have your perfunctory framework for
prehistoric mayhem, thrills, and chills.</P>
<P>The promise appears to be fulfilled in the first major dinosaur
suspense sequence, involving two very angry T-rexes and our heroes trapped
in a double trailer dangling off of a cliff.  This scene, which features a
tense moment with Sarah on top of a slowly cracking horizontal window pane
and some choice dino feeding action, comes quite early in the film, and it
sets the stage up for greater thrills.  But they don't come.  The problem?
Miscalculations and missed opportunities.  Other than this early scene and a
T-rex attack on a camp (complete with the return of the image of quivering
water), the major set pieces don't quite go for the kill.  Especially
dismaying is the showcase raptor sequence.  With the raptors chasing our
heroes in, on, and around an abandoned, run-down building, it is an
effective, suspenseful scene... until the end comes.  Jurassic Park had its
share of corny moments (the bonding-with-kids-while-feeding-the-brontosaurus
scene comes to mind), but it never crossed the line to outright camp and
cheese, which is what Spielberg and scripter David Koepp let The Lost World
do in its resolution of the raptor scene.  I won't give it away, but it left
me and the audience with which I saw the film completely aghast at its
idiotic awfulness.  Certainly, a film about dinosaurs in the present day
requires a suspension of disbelief, but to even the most openminded viewer,
the end of the raptor scene will ring completely false.  The film's third
act centers on an unexpected twist involving the T-rex, but the
possibilities this surprise idea brings aren't satisfactorily realized.  The
T-rex is roars a lot, breaks stuff--but, shockingly enough, he doesn't
really help himself to the veritable buffet of people running from him.
What's the fun of a T-rex who's not hungry?</P>
<P>On a similar note, the promise of the casting does not pay off,
mostly due to Koepp's lazy screenplay.  Once again, Goldblum is the only
remotely interesting human, getting all of the best lines.  Moore does not
fall into the same trap that befell the original's overwrought Dern, who
attacked her role as if she wanted an Oscar nomination.  However, once the
deadlier dinosaurs arrive, her brilliant scientist is reduced to being a
token screamer, and there's precious little left for the talented Moore to
work with.  Vaughn is a very lively actor (see Swingers), but you would not
get that impression from his "role" here, which is a mere one-dimensional
placeholder.  Pete Postlethwaite's character, a determined hunter after a
T-rex, is potentially interesting, but he goes nowhere.  Chester, despite
having a key part in the horrendous raptor resolution, is a big step up from
the first film's kids, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards (who both,
unfortunately, resurface in a cameo, albeit mercifully brief), but anyone
would have been an improvement over that annoying duo.</P>
<P>After all my griping, my giving The Lost World: Jurassic Park a
passing grade may seem a bit hypocritical, but up to this point I have been
focusing on what the film isn't rather than what it is: an enjoyable
adventure that never bores, even with a two-hour, fourteen-minute running
time.   It delivers exactly what one would expect from a dinosaur movie--a
wide array of very convincing animatronic and computer-generated prehistoric
reptiles (even more impressive than in the original) destroying things and
people in more than a few reasonably thrilling set pieces.   And as such, it
fits the bill of summer popcorn entertainment.<HR></P>
