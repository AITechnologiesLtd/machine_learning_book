<P>  BOYCOTT (director/writer: Mohsen Makhmalbaf; cinematographer: Faraj Haydari;
editor: Roobik Mansoori; cast: Majid Majidi (Valeh), Zohreh Sarmadi (Maryam);
Runtime: 85; Facets Video; 1985-Iran) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>In some respects Mohsen Makhmalbaf's fourth feature draws on his youthful
experiences as a political activist who was jailed. In this bleak but almost
painfully comical look at a leftist terrorist who becomes martyred for a cause
he no longer believes in, there's a chance to see how the director became more
enlightened because of these experiences. </P>
<P>Mohsen had an uprooted childhood because his father left his second wife,
Mohsen's mother, and his mother took him to live with his aunt and grandmother.
He got religion from his grandmother (becoming a strict Islamic fundamentalist),
learned to read from his aunt, and from his lawyer stepfather absorbed politics.
He was soon working as an activist against the Shah's regime. When he was 17 he
attempted to steal a gun from a policeman and in the process stabbed him and was
shot. After his arrest, he was interrogated and tortured. He served a four year
jail sentence and was released in 1979. This experience he clearly used in
Boycott, and that plays a major part in understanding the director's continual
growth and ability to change. He has reinvented himself as a director and has
since received international acclaim for his unique films, and is the most
popular Iranian filmmaker along with Abbas Kiarostami. </P>
<P>The film is a rambling, action-packed Hollywood style (for the most part),
surreal, and politically motivated thriller--with car chases and shootouts. It
seemed like an apology for a youthful error he made in his personal life that
didn't have to turn out with a happy ending. He could have been shot by a firing
squad and falsely made into a Marxist hero just as easily as the film's hero
was, Valeh (Majid Majidi-a noted director of The Father/Color of Paradise/The
Children of Heaven). The director has currently come to be a thorn in the side
of the present Iranian regime, as a voice for women's rights and a continual
critic of the state's policies and cultural attitude. </P>
<P>The film opens as Valeh's wife Maryam goes into labor and he disappears to carry
out a leftist guerrilla operation with his cohorts Ali and Fatima. But the
Shah's Secret Police are ready and kill the couple and capture him. He's
tortured in his interrogation and hopes to avoid further cruelty by going along
with whatever his jailers want of him, but finds he's caught by those on both
sides who won't let go of him and he can't find a way out of his dilemma. </P>
<P>The film's power is in its nightmarish presentment of prison life, where the
captive is trapped with brutal prisoners and government police officials who
both want to capture his soul. The film gets its title when all the political
prisoners he was once friendly with completely ignore him, at the request of
their leader, for not still being committed to the Marxist party line. He's also
troubled by thoughts of leaving his wife and child alone, and only sees her
during prison visits--where their phone conversation is secretly monitored. </P>
<P>The film never convincingly showed Valeh as anything but a political lightweight
without guts, so when he explains while in prison how naive he was to join the
terrorists it sounds almost laughable when he says: "I fight, therefore I am.
But now I doubt whether I really exist, and therefore I don't care to fight." </P>
<P>Not a very good film in Mohsen Makhmalbaf's opus, but still worth a look to see
how much he has developed as a filmmaker, an international personality, and
human being since his misspent youth and beginnings as a filmmaker. This
remarkable director was born in 1957. </P>
