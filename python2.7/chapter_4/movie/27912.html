<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I attend and work at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Virtually every 
structure on the campus -- academic, administration and residence -- is 
linked in some way, either via skywalk or by a sometimes labyrinthine 
network of underground tunnels. Fortunately, I don't actually live on 
campus, so at the end of every day, I escape that closed network for the 
real outdoors. Not everyone is so lucky; I've known people living in 
residence who have purposely planned their schedules so that they never 
actually need to go outdoors. For them, MUN is a sealed environment: they
experience the world beyond only second-hand.</P>
<P>So I can relate to "Waydowntown", directed and co-written by Canadian 
helmer Gary Burns. "Waydowntown" is set in Calgary, Alberta, which sports 
a similarly enclosed downtown complex, complete with restaurants, 
corporate offices, shopping malls and living accommodations: it's a 
universe unto itself. Four employees working for a company headquartered 
somewhere in this amalgamation of edifices have made a bet to see how long 
they can last without actually going outdoors; the losers each give up a 
month's salary.</P>
<P>The movie begins four weeks into the wager, when it's beginning to take 
its toll on all the participants. Slick but manic Curt (Gordon Currie) is 
longs for the pleasures of the flesh, and has set his sights on vulnerable 
co-worker Vicki (Jennifer Clement), whose relationship with her fiance is 
on the rocks. Randy (Tobias Godson) passes time engaging in meaningless 
conversation with dorky security guard Phil (James McBurney). Sandra 
(Marya Delver), newly saddled with the responsibility of keeping an eye on 
her kleptomaniacal boss, finds herself suffocating in the recycled air of 
the downtown. And the competitive Tom (Fab Filippo) finds himself assailed 
on all sides -- by an attractive but flighty woman with a possibly 
suicidal boyfriend, by his oddball officemate Bradley (Don McKellar), and 
even by fleeting visions of a superhero in tights.</P>
<P>Burns and co-writer James Martin have devised a clever concept in 
"Waydowntown". The general set-up may seem like something out of a 
"Seinfeld" episode, but it's also a nice reflection of the way modern 
society has become so focussed, centralised and ultra-efficient that the 
simple beauty of life is sometimes forgotten. Being able to, say, go for a 
walk in the park might seem frivolous and superfluous -- especially when 
there are "more important" things to do -- but imagine actually being 
unable to indulge in that kind of activity. All of a sudden, it doesn't 
seem so frivolous and superfluous. It's the sort of thing that places the 
pursuit of money and power and achievement in context; what's the point in 
making millions of dollars if it becomes the sum total of your existence?</P>
<P>Burns directs the film at a manic pace, evoking the hectic state of 
everyday existence. He even slips occasionally into the mindstate of his 
characters. For instance, Tom feels like he's just floating through life, 
and Burns actually portrays him levitating down the corridors and walkways 
of the downtown. Burns also nicely captures the claustrophobia and 
sterility of the complex, a feeling enhanced by his decision to shoot the 
movie digitally and then transfer over to film afterward. "Waydowntown" is 
relentless from start to finish, sucking the viewer into its warped vision 
of reality right from the unusual opening credit sequence, and not letting 
go until the very end.</P>
<P>But as good as the premise of "Waydowntown" is, Burns is never quite able 
to elevate his script above the central idea. There are a lot of funny 
sequences -- I liked the way Sandra kept chasing after her elderly yet 
elusive boss only to become a shoplifter of sorts herself, stealing 
perfume inserts out of magazines to give her something to breathe in 
besides the stale downtown air. And a scene in which Brad attempts to 
replicate a local legend with a pop bottle full of marbles is downright 
hilarious.</P>
<P>But too often, Burns and Martin fall back on rather dodgy sitcom-style 
humour. An extended subplot involving Tom and an expensive crystal vase 
plays out, for the most part, like something that might have been on last 
night's rerun of "Three's Company". Other elements just feel like they 
could have been milked for more: Curt's bathroom-stall conquest of Vicki, 
for example, ends not with a bang (excuse the pun) but with a whimper. And 
in some areas, the script simply feels as though it needed tightening. 
Randy's entire existence is never really justified: he enjoys no 
interesting subplot like the other three participants in the bet, and is 
really only takes part in a couple of genuinely funny sequences (one 
involving Sandra and a cell phone is delightful, but Randy's presence 
isn't particularly germane).</P>
<P>Still, Burns does manage to encourage a number of good performances. 
Filippo -- despite the distracting affectation of wearing dark lipstick 
throughout -- hits all the right notes as Tom, whose natural state of 
climbing the corporate ladder is challenged by his awakening appreciation 
of a broader view of life. Initially appearing as little more than a 
corporate smooth-talker, Tom steadily develops a conscience as 
"Waydowntown" progresses, and Filippo does a good job of portraying this 
growth. Meanwhile, McKellar plays his oddball part well, making Bradley 
sufficiently weird and distant without losing a sense of reality (or 
humour). Currie is saddled with a rather stereotypical role as would-be 
jock Curt, but handles his material well all the same. Also noteworthy in 
a smaller role is McBurney, who steals practically every scene he's in. 
Phil's abortive efforts to stand up to the businessmen who are oblivious 
to his existence account for some of the movie's most sublime scenes.</P>
<P>Given all this, then, it is unfortunate that "Waydowntown" isn't as funny 
as it could and should have been. Burns is clearly on to something here, 
but isn't aggressive enough in complementing his high concept with an 
equally challenging execution. But despite its flaws, "Waydowntown" 
remains an effective, entertaining and incisive parable for our times.</P>
