<PRE>Quirky.</PRE>
<P>There's a word I'm sure was on the tongues of Fine Line execs
and publicists alike, talking up this unlikely comedy from
first-time writer/director Steven Baigleman. They must have
seen the potential for another "quirky" comedy from an
idiosyncratic director, one who would follow in the footsteps
of, if not Quentin Tarantino, then at least David O. Russell
or the Coen brothers.</P>
<P>FEELING MINNESOTA tries real hard to be "quirky." And part of
the problem is that its quirks are part of an impossibly
contrived plot. The slapdash storyline is pure surface -- you
can't see any of the twists coming, but they don't exactly
surprise you because the story has no interior logic. Like so
many films in the Age of Tarantino, this one coasts into
theaters on the strength of insincere characters and glib
violence.</P>
<P>Your guess is as good as mine why a romantic comedy featuring
stars like Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz is allowed to
degenerate into generic gunplay and chaos. The opening scenes
are almost sweet, with Jjak (Reeves) arriving back at the
family home outside of St. Paul for the marriage of his
brother Sam (Vincent D'Onofrio). Jjak left home when he was
just 8 years old, but mother Norma (Tuesday Weld) welcomes
him to the ceremony with open arms, at least until she learns
that he had the poor manners to arrive without a present.
>From that point on, sibling relations grow a little more
strained -- reluctant newlywed Freddie (Diaz) screws Jjak on
the bathroom floor minutes after she takes her vows with Sam;
Mother drops dead of a heart attack after Jjak makes a scene;
Jjak takes the bride with him when he leaves town four days
later.</P>
<P>Sounds like a pretty terrific set-up, right? Hell, I was
hooked. Reeves plays a charming loser whose best romantic
idea is to loot a pet store on the way out of town, breaking
the window to steal a dog and a bag of puppy chow. Diaz is,
finally, a starlet who performs as advertised. She's sulky,
seductive and beautiful, and she and Reeves seem made for
each other. As the two of them cruise down the highway with
their dog, singing along with The Replacements' "I Will Dare"
thumping from the stereo of their stolen car, the goofiness
really clicks. Anything, it seems, could happen.</P>
<P>Too bad, because it's here that the movie makes a U-turn.
Almost immediately, Freddie convinces Jjak to go back to the
family spread and steal the money Sam has embezzled from his
small-time gangster boss, Red (Delroy Lindo). Naturally, Sam
catches him in the act and points a gun at his head. If Sam
actually shot Jjak at this point, FEELING MINNESOTA would be
a really short movie. So instead, we have to endure another
hour or so of Jjak and Sam shouting, pointing guns, and
beating the hell out of one another. This idiosyncratic
romance has suddenly become a guy movie with "black comedy"
aspirations, but to no real effect.</P>
<P>Freddie is the film's lone female catalyst, but no matter --
she disappears at the end of the first act, victim of a
nonsensical plot twist. Courtney Love is billed fairly
prominently, but she winds up looking good doing remarkably
little. She plays a waitress, pouring coffee and making small
talk with D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio is an irritating putz, which
is the role he was hired to play, so good for him. Dan
Aykroyd is better than you would think as a local cop who
gets involved as the sibling rivalry turns nasty. The
performances are all quite good, and I can't really fault the
direction per se. But the script, I think, needed a thumping.</P>
<P>Movies these days have a new amoral fascination with guns.
It's easy to blame Tarantino for this, but he's so far made
pretty good movies about criminals, movies that try hard to
honestly exploit, if not understand, the relationships
between men and how they involve violence, loyalty, and
power. FEELING MINNESOTA, though, hands out the loaded
handguns so early on that they become just props. Everyone in
this movie has the power to kill everyone else at some point,
so when murder is committed, it doesn't come as a shock.</P>
<P>It would have helped to have a little more in the character
department, as well. Sam, it turns out, cooked Red's books to
make it look like Freddie was stealing money from him;
Freddie was forced to marry Sam as her punishment and his
reward. Even so, there's little else in the movie to
distinguish loathesome loser Sam from loveable loser Jjak --
good thing Keanu's the cute one, or we might not know who to
root for. Freddie's cut from the same cloth. Her idea of
success is the kind of part in a Vegas floor show that set
SHOWGIRLS in motion. These characters are truly morose, and
their dialogue is even worse. Freddie on life: "Time is like
an orange." Jjak on his own misery: "I've never felt ...
whatever that word is. Happy."</P>
<P>I kept thinking about Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD, a
similarly "quirky" comedy that took a sudden, startling left
turn into nightmare territory and hit a jackpot. FEELING
MINNESOTA isn't nearly as ambitious as that movie, and maybe
that's the problem. Mucking about in low-key gloom, Baigleman
can't find the energy or exuberance that would make us care
at all whether his characters live, die, or join a Vegas
floor show. FEELING MINNESOTA is low-rent filmmaking that
feels slugglishly, disastrously low-rent.</P>
