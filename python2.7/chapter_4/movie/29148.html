<PRE>"Rush Hour 2" - Feels Kinda Slow
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>What has fueled the excitement around "RH2"? 
Arguably, the team of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is
the best cop/buddy combo since those guys from "Lethal
Weapon."  Summer moviegoers are looking for a fun
time, which is almost guaranteed when you watch either
of these two flamboyant stars.  And, the first "RH"
was so much fun that you can't help but have high
expectations for this one.</P>
<P>With expectations as high as a mountain, it's almost
impossible for a movie to overcome this kind of
barrier.  And this one can't, falling short on laughs
and defining moments.  In fact, many will think that
the most memorable moments were the outtakes at the
film's end and the cameo by actor Don Cheadle who
speaks Cantonese and displays the Tiger Claw fighting
style.</P>
<P>But the film is not all bad thanks to Chris Tucker,
who as Detective James Carter, is the life of the
party.  In the film's first act, he's in Hong Kong
visiting his old pal, Inspector Lee (Chan).  However,
Lee is always on the job and is currently trying to
solve a recent bombing, suspected to have been carried
out by Ricky Tan (John Lone), a notorious Triad gang
leader.  </P>
<P>Carter just wants to have a good time, and when he
whoops it up at a Karaoke bar, Lee begs him to remain
incognito for this is where Triad gang members tend to
hang out.  However, you just can't shut him up.  "I'm
from LA; we invented gangs," he says.  Turning to the
crowd, he screeches, "All the Triads and the ugly
women on the left side, all the f-f-i-i-i-n-e women on
the right side."  Tucker's brassy demeanor, his
down-with-it attitude and his cluelessness about the
culture and the language make him hilarious to watch.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, after the first 30 minutes, our duo
leaves Hong Kong and all the fun behind.  The
investigation leads them to Los Angeles and Las Vegas
where it's Chan's turn to play the fish-out-of-water. 
But, he looks uncomfortable when speaking English and
doesn't possess Tucker's insouciance.  Chan seemed
statelier and more at ease in the first "RH."  His
role was more dramatic in nature, and he didn't have
to speak too much English.  This film lightheartedly
acknowledges Chan's broken English when he asks,
"don't you understand the words that are coming out of
my mouth?"  Tucker replies disgustedly, "don't nobody
understand the words coming out your mouth!"  Even the
outtakes show many scenes where Chan is trying to
force his English lines.</P>
<P>Also missing are the great stuntwork and fight
sequences that are hallmarks of Chan's work.  The only
good sequence occurs early on where Chan goes against
a cadre of gangsters atop rickety scaffolding several
stories above.  But the other sequences seemed tepid
or looked cartoonish.</P>
<P>"RH2" is only marginally fun to watch while short on
drama.  Yet, it received so much press and hype that
it succeeded in grossing over $69 million in its
opening weekend.  This is an incredible
accomplishment!  And considering the fact that August
is the slowest of summer movie months (the previous
opening record in August was "Sixth Sense" which took
in about $27 mil.), moviegoers couldn't wait to see
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reunite.  But what's the
hurry?  "RH2" felt kinda slow.</P>
