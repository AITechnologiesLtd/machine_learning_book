                       A film review by Mike Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Mike Joyce</PRE>
<P>When I first heard that Romeo & Juliet had been "updated" I shuddered. I
thought that yet another of Shakespeare's classics had been destroyed.
Fortunately, I was wrong. Baz Luhrman has directed an "in your face", and
visually stunning piece with this film. It revolves around the two rival
families, who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises.
These rival companies/families are the Capulet's and the Montague's. The
younger generation of these two families have formed gangs, who despise one
another. As the storylines goes, Romeo Montague (played by Leonardo
DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet (Claire Danes) meet at a fancy dress party,
and it is love at first site. I never believed love at first site was
possible until I saw this film, the scene in which Romeo's eyes meet
Juliet's through the fish tank is one of the most memorable. Of course,
they cannot publicly reveal their love, for their families are arch
enemies. So they marry in secret, this is where things begin to go wrong.
The story, as with all good Shakespeare, ends in tragedy.</P>
<P>The cinematography is spectacular to say the least, and the soundtrack
provides the perfect atmosphere in which to "lay our scene", as the film
says. There is very little to criticise. The performances are convincing,
and several of the film's younger stars may find that it provides a launch
for their careers. The modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever.
Despite the well known storyline, this latest version still manages to
cause tears among many members of the audience (especially the younger
generation), and this is certainly a great credit to the film.</P>
