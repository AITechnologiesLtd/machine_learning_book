<P>`Rules of Engagement' is not the standard Hollywood treatment for
glorification of patriotism in battle. When covering this ground, the
film achieves adequate success, and poses some interesting questions
surrounding the line that separates heroic bravery from cowardly murder.
However, the film is the standard Hollywood treatment of the aftermath
of this patriotism. A textbook courtroom drama plagued with irksome,
ho-hum plotting straight out of `A Few Good Men', it's quickly apparent
that `Rules of Engagement' is a shameless indulgence in the worst of
Hollywood dramatization. Hence, it's nothing new.</P>
<P>Momentum is achieved promptly by seasoned director William Friedkin
(`The French Connection'), who, despite some vapid implausibility's,
manages to stage some brutally realistic and effective battle sequences.
We open in 1968 during the Vietnam War, where marines Terry Childers
(Samuel L. Jackson) and Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) are engaged in
battle. When their platoon is separated, Childers winds up saving
Hodges' life in extreme and courageous circumstances. Cut to 28 years in
the future, where both men are now highly decorated colonels. Hodges is
retiring to fly-fishing in relaxing backwood trout streams, but Childers
continues his service, and is called into action for an operation in
Yemen that requires the rescue and retrieval of the American Ambassador
(Ben Kingsley) and his family. Due to extremely hostile rioting by
Yemeni civilians and high-perched snipers surrounding the embassy,
Childers loses three marines, while another lay critically wounded. He
orders an open-fire into the crowd, mowing down over 80 rioters
including women and children, in a disturbing sequence of images that
Friedkin once again directs with nimble expertise. When Childers is
court-martialed under the charges of murder and defiance of the standard
rules of engagement for battle, his position in the marine core and
future is at stake. He heads to Hodges and requests that he represent
him in court. `I'm a good enough lawyer to know you need a better lawyer
than me,' is the stern reply.</P>
<P>`Rules of Engagement' is a superbly structured military drama so far, a
top-drawer model with stellar performances filling any cracks in the
inconsistent foundation. And then Hollywood sneaks under the radar and
takes hold of a potentially gripping story-line. The villain, played by
Canadian Bruce Greenwood, is U.S. National Secuirity Advisor William
Sokal. A cowardly weasel determined to find a scapegoat at any cost,
Sokal destroys evidence of the rioters opening fire that would clear
Childers' name. Like virtually everything in the film, the role seems
cluttered and unfinished, although Greenwood plays Sokal with enough
panache for forgiveness. Similar exoneration cannot be granted for the
remainder of the choppy, uninvolving second half, which nose-dives into
courtroom formula and the standard offering of gaping plot holes.
Accepting Childers' position is initially difficult, because he have
reluctance to scrounge up much sympathy for a man who slaughtered 83
people... and many of them innocent civilians. Future plot movements
make this easier, but the actions of Jackson's character are too often
inconclusive. Jones is also subject to unconvincing characteristics.
While Hodges openly admits he is an inexperienced attorney, he still
acts in feeble-minded ways, snapping pictures with a camera that looks
like those waterproof Kodak models you purchase at the grocery store.</P>
<P>The star performances are one of the strong suits of `Rules of
Engagement'. Jones and Jackson whole-heartedly convince us of their
friendship and military background. Both have done far better work, but
their high-powered verbal exchanges ignite the screen - particularly in
a few tantalizing moments of courtroom confrontation that rise above the
rest of the mundane triviality. Another key factor in these scenes is
Australian Guy Pearce (`L.A. Confidential'), who fiddles around quite
successfully with a New York accent to play prosecuting attorney Biggs,
and adds more fuel to the fire. Mostly everything else in `Rules of
Engagement' fizzles quietly, like a bad batch of pop rocks. Philip Baker
Hall (as Hodges' father) and Blair Underwood (as a fellow testifying
marine) are both solid but perpetually under-used. All promise of a
stirring, pensive drama is plowed over by the transparent clichés of
Stephen Gaghan's screenplay. Large portions of the script appear to be
in shambles, perhaps the indication of material tampering that goes
right to the core.</P>
<P>Any messages about war violence and its posterior consequences are lost
in a haze of Hollywood formula. In `Rules of Engagement', you can't
overlook the stellar acting and direction, but the remainder of this
sloppy military drama will leave you in awkward state of ho-hum
indifference. Sacrificing moral issues and fascinating war themes for
tedious plotting and an inconclusive finale? Only in Hollywood, my
friends.</P>
