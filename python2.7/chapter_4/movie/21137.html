<PRE>BOYS DON'T CRY (1999)
by George Wu</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>She was born Teena Brandon in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she introduced herself
to everyone as Brandon Teena. She dressed like a boy, acted like a boy, and
had girlfriends whom she apparently treated better than had she been a boy.
Even after she was found out, raped, and murdered, Brandon's girlfriends
remained enraptured of him, for in every case aside from Brandon's
biological gender, Brandon was a "he."  Susan Muska and Gréta Olafsdóttir
produced The Brandon Teena Story, a documentary released last year
recording these events.  That film was poorly-made, unintentionally
exploitative, but nevertheless, enormously powerful owing to its subject
matter alone.  Now comes first-time filmmaker, Kimberly Peirce's dramatic
narrative version, Boys Don't Cry.  It's well-made, non-exploitative, and
enormously powerful owing to Peirce's creative direction and her stars
bravura performances.</P>
<P>Following actual events pretty closely, Peirce and her co-writer Andy
Bienen pick up the story from Brandon's move from Lincoln to Falls City,
Nebraska, where Brandon meets and falls in love with local girl, Lana. This
incurs the wraths of Brandon's heretofore friends, John Lotter and Tom
Nissen, both ex-cons.  What is impressive about Boys Don't Cry is that
Peirce doesn't sensationalize the material, which is easily done in lesser
hands with such subjects as gender-bending, rape, and murder. Nor does
Peirce, a lesbian, exude an agenda.  Brandon is shown warts and all as a
thief and habitual liar (about far more than his gender), while John and
Tom are welcoming and amicable before they uncover Brandon's secret. Peirce
even allows that John's loathing for Brandon may derive more from his
jealousy of Lana than homophobia, though homophobia abets his actions. 
Brandon does not come off as a martyr, but very much an individual. Brandon
refuses the label of lesbian. The subtext is gender fluidity and the
questioning of why we have to categorize sexual orientation at all.  Labels
emphasize difference, and difference is a code word for misanthropy.</P>
<P>Peirce intersperses wonderful time-lapse sequences of the horizon, the
clouds, the stars, even a refinery throughout the film.  While these could
just be throwaway flourishes, their beauty and timing point to a
transcendent hope in the characters' dreams, no matter how stupid they may
be, like Brandon's preoccupation with Memphis or Lana's wanting to become a
karaoke singer.  Only at the end, does Pierce's romanticization get the
better of her, in a fictional love scene between Lana and the doomed
Brandon.</P>
<P>The entire cast is superb.  Actress Hilary Swank holds nothing back in
giving the character of Brandon brashness, longing, hope, naivete, and
denial.  Matching her every step of the way is Chloë Sevigny as Lana, and
their chemistry together is wholly convincing.  Sevigny (along with Sarah
Polley) is among the great actors of her generation.  Peter Sarsgaard
imbues John with both humanity and barbarous malevolence.  In two smaller
roles of great merit are Alicia Goranson, who plays Candace, Brandon's
first friend in Falls City, and Jeanetta Arnette as Lana's outlandish mom.</P>
