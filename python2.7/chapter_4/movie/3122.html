<PRE>                               FEDERAL HILL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule: A circle of five friends is destroyed by
          the selfishness of one of their number.
          Author/producer/director Michael Corrente takes
          stories from his youth and creates a loose drama
          reminiscent of MEAN STREETS.  The plot is familiar,
          but Corrente's direction keeps the film fresh.
          Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Michael Corrente is a young filmmaker who has financed, written,
and directed his own film.  Both the director's story and the film's
story have a ring of familiarity.  Corrente's history is a parallel of
Barry Levison's.  Each chose as a first film to tell the story of his
small ring of friends, but somewhat fictionalized.  Each made a good
film on a very low budget.  And though Levison had a much better feel
for memorable characters in his DINER than Corrente does with FEDERAL
HILL, each made an impressive first film.  One thing we can conclude is
that Levison grew up in a better neighborhood.  Much of what Corrente
tells of his friends has a sting reminiscent of GOODFELLAS and MEAN
STREETS.</P>
<P>     Ralph, Nicky, Frank, Joey, and Bobby (played respectively by
Nicholas Turturro, Anthony DeSando, Michael Raynor, Robert Tutano, and
Jason Andrews) are friends who grew up together in Federal Hill, the
heavily Italian-American section of Providence, Rhode Island.  Each of
the friends is connected with crime in one way or another.  Ralph robs
houses; Nicky deals cocaine; Bobby is a loser who deals in counterfeit
money and owes the big boys $30,000.  Joey is nearly straight.  He did
time after doing a job with buddies who left him holding the bag.  Now
he has a wife and his worst crime is violating parole by gambling with
his buddies.  Frank is the only one of the guys who is straight and who
tries to keep the others out of trouble.  He can afford to be straight-
--his father is a local boss in the syndicate.  When Nicky meets a
cute, rich Brown student (Libby Langdon, wife of Michael Corrente) he
has visions of marrying her.  But getting in the way is Ralph, a loose
cannon who is getting into bigger crime.  He wants to pull his
housemate and best friend Nicky in with him, but he is willing to
settle for dragging in Bobby.</P>
<P>     The plot of FEDERAL HILL works just a little too predictably and
melodramatically.  Following the well-worn conventions of films like
THE GODFATHER, the plot gets more and more taut as the story proceeds
until it seems inevitable that there will be violence.  The formula is
followed down even to the cooking scene where we learn how to make some
terrific Italian dish (in this case a tempting Aglio e Olio with
Parmesan cheese).</P>
<P>     Whether this film will be a star-maker the way DINER was is still
in question.  Certainly none of the actors in the film has the same
sort of screen presence of the characters of DINER.  Nicholas Turturro,
who gives the film what modest acting flash it has, has gone on to
television work.  Libby Langdon is attractive as Wendy, but she simply
fails to do much with her character beyond what was on the printed page
of the script.  Probably what sets this film apart from others in its
class is the mood effect created by black-and-white photography.</P>
<P>     As a first film this low-budget, semi-autobiographical crime film
is polished and has some interesting moves that make the familiar
aspects seem a little fresher.  The true test for Corrente will be the
second film.  This one gets a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the second film should be THE MAKING OF FEDERAL HILL.
Corrente has a number of interesting stories to tell about how the film
was made.  One of the better ones involves his refusal to use a union
crew in order to save money.  Apparently the local union wanted to hire
an enforcer to break Corrente's legs to teach him a lesson.  "I can't
do that," the enforcer said, "Michael Corrente is my little brother."
"Oh.  Okay," the union rep said.  "Gee, what a small, funny world this
is!"</P>
