<P>I really wish they would make more films like THE FISHER KING. Movies these
days seem to have lost sight of one of the most unique aspects of visual
storytelling: its capacity to portray dreams and fantasy. That's not to say
that movies don't ever stretch the boundaries of reality any more, but they
do so cynically and cheaply, littering the screenplay with enough
tongue-in-cheek one-liners so everyone can just relax. "Of course we don't
*really* want you to think that a giant asteroid is going to hit the
earth," filmmakers seem to be saying, "but it sure is fun to watch, isn't
it?" Even Steven Spielberg, who brought such extraordinary stories as CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T. to our screens, has now tuned his
sensibilities either to fantasies that are essentially negative and
destructive, as in THE LOST WORLD, in which dinosaurs are brought to life
only so they can chase people around and kill them, or to big-budget
historical re-creations (not to take anything away from SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN, of course, but the point's the same).</P>
<P>The preceding paragraph might give readers the mistaken impression that THE
FISHER KING is a fantasy film. It isn't, really: in fact, it takes place in
'90s New York City. The genius of THE FISHER KING is that rather than
simply being an escapist fantasy, it argues for the place of escapist
fantasies in the real world. Director Terry Gilliam is on familiar turf
here, but never before has he given the opposition so much screen time: the
"realists" in his films have previously been either obviously corrupt and
evil (the totalitarian regime in BRAZIL) or almost cartoonishly dull and
crotchety (the parents in TIME BANDITS and the medieval town leader in THE
ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN).</P>
<P>In THE FISHER KING, protagonist Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is a bona fide
'90s cynic if there ever was one. When we first meet him, he's a Howard
Stern-style radio host who makes a living spouting off and insulting his
callers. One night, after making an off-hand comment about "stopping the
impending yuppie takeover," he turns on the TV to find that one of his
listeners apparently took him seriously and shot up a posh restaurant.
Three years later, having quit his showbiz job and freeloading off of his
girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl), he's depressed and on the verge of
suicide when he's attacked by a pair of muggers, only to be rescued by a
homeless man named Parry (Robin Williams) who believes he's a medieval
knight on a quest for the Holy Grail. He knows where it is, too, and
explains this to Jack, who quickly realizes that Parry's actually talking
about a sports trophy in a wealthy New Yorker's home collection.</P>
<P>Parry's wife, as it turns out, was killed in the restaurant shooting three
years ago, and the personal tragedy is what has spawned his delusions. Jack
understandably feels partly responsible, and decides to try to help Parry,
which can be a rather exasperating task at times: Parry is often distracted
by a "Red Knight" that he believes is chasing him, and talks to "Little
People" who come to visit him occasionally. He's also fallen in love with a
lonely woman (Amanda Plummer) that he sees pass through the train station
every day. Jack and Anne determine to set the two of them up, and Gilliam
handles the goofball romance that develops particularly well, letting them
stay true to their quirky personalities without mocking them or allowing
their scenes to degenerate into farce. Meanwhile, Jack and Anne start to
rediscover some of the magic in their own relationship, which had been
going slowly downhill due to his depression and aimlessness.</P>
<P>In the hands of someone other than Gilliam and screenwriter Richard
LaGravenese, the story might easily have ended here: Jack makes his act of
redemption, Parry is "cured" of his fantasies, and the two couples live
happily ever after. Not in THE FISHER KING. Parry has a relapse, slipping
away into a coma and leaving Jack bewildered. Eventually, he realizes that
the only way to bring Parry out of it is to find his Holy Grail for him.
This is the film's grand gesture: it requires Jack to join Parry in his
fantasy before the two of them can really finish what they started. THE
FISHER KING is a long, hard-fought , and ultimately well-deserved victory
for romanticism and imagination over today's cynical brand of pragmatism.</P>
<P>That's not to say that THE FISHER KING is perfect. It starts to get a
little unwieldy towards the end of its 137-minute running time, as another
crisis for Jack and Anne is unconvincingly introduced. This seemed like a
waste of screen time, and it really wasn't necessary to make Jack rehash
all  his previous conflicts in the final half hour; the unfinished business
with Parry would have been enough. For the most part, however, Gilliam
keeps the story on track, mixing in the right amounts of doubt and
disappointment so that the film's essentially optimistic viewpoint comes
through without seeming sappy or undeveloped. Too many films nowadays stage
an uplifting finish without the story or characters to back it up. THE
FISHER KING is one movie that earns its happy ending.</P>
