<PRE>                               NO CONTEST
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>No Contest (1994) ** out of ***** - Cast: Shannon Tweed, Robert Davi, Andrew
Clay, Roddy Piper. Directed By: Paul Lynch. Running Time: 98 minutes.</P>
<P>"No Contest" is a VERY blatent rip-off of "Die Hard", just on a much lower
level of intelligence, credibility, and creativity.</P>
<P>The film opens as Sharon (Shannon Tweed) is hosting some sort of silly
beauty pagent. Ms. Galaxy, or something like that. We are told that Sharon
is a famous action film star, and immediately all common sense is thrown out
the window. A group of terrorists, led by the "Diceman" himself Andrew Clay,
then takes over the hotel where the beauty pagent is being held. If there
was any residual common sense left over, throw it out the window too, cause
it's "Die Hard at a beauty pagent!!!" They apparently are trying to kidnap a
congressman's daughter who is participating in the pagent.</P>
<P>Robert Davi, who was actually in "Die Hard", plays a private security agent
assigned to the congressman's daughter. It's an odd bit of casting, making
Davi a hero. But Tweed is supposed to be a kickboxing champ, so nothing
matters at this point. Wrestler Roddy Piper has a brief, but menacing role
as one of the terrorists. Basically, he's the Alexander Godunov character.</P>
<P>In a strange way, "No Contest" is almost fun. ALMOST. It's just so silly,
you might just be entertained. Clay is subdued in his role, but he does a
good job with it. Davi is interesting to see as the good guy, and Piper is
always fun to watch no matter how bad his movies are. And Tweed? Well, she
doesn't even get naked in this one, and really, 99% of the people who rent
Shannon Tweed movies are only after that one thing. I seriously doubt anyone
will care that Tweed (well, actually a horrible body double filmed as far
away from the camera as possible) is kicking the bad guys in the groin.  [R]</P>
