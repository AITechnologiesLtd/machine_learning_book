        It is New Year's Eve in New York, 1981.  Punk rock is in its
death throes.  This is a more innocent time, before the era of
political correctness, smoking bans, and the spectre of AIDS.  This
low budget comedy follows a disparate group of twentysomething New
Yorkers as they look for love and a hot time in the city in the hours
leading up to midnight.  The common link is that they have all been
invited to a party in a loft apartment.
        While Monica (Martha Plimpton), the hostess, grows
increasingly frustrated with the fact that no-one has yet shown up,
her potential guests are sorting out a number of personal
relationships and trying to organise their dates for the evening.  The
film cuts between the various characters, but we never really get any
feel for them as real people.  If the film has anything resembling
central characters it is Lucy (Courtney Love) and Kevin (Paul Rudd,
from Clueless, etc).  Both long time best friends they are without a
date for New Year's Eve, and gradually come to realise that may well
be perfect partners as the night wears on.
        First time screen writer Shana Larsen doesn't get overly
sentimental about the spirit of the celebrations here.  Rather, her
script offers up some witty and acerbic observations on relationships.
The film is also suffused with a nice touch of irony that is oddly
appealing.</P>
<P>        200 Cigarettes is the first feature from director Risa Bramon
Garcia, a former high powered casting agent, who has assembled an
ensemble group of hot young things and rising young stars to bring the
characters to life.  They deliver enthusiastic performances that
capture the spirit of the film.  Love in particular is superb, and her
flamboyant, brassy screen presence reminded me of a brash, younger
Bette Midler.  Janeane Garofalo lends her lacerating wit to a small
role as Kevin's past lover, a pretentious performance artist named
Ellie.
        Ben Affleck is wasted in a small and meaningless role as a
bartender, while younger brother Casey is solid as a young punk who
attracts the attention of Val (Christina Ricci), a tough and feisty
teeny bopper.  Jay Mohr (from Jerry Maguire, etc) plays the womanising
Jack, who is desperately trying to ditch the clinging Cindy (Kate
Hudson), with whom he spent the previous night.  Comic Dave Chappelle
is enjoyable as a spaced out cabbie who ferries many of the characters
around the city.  Singer Elvis Costello contributes a brief cameo for
the film's final, delightfully ironic joke.
        But the film's setting is also a good excuse to crank out yet
another great soundtrack of '80's songs, which, in hindsight, is one
of the major plusses of this rather slight, but nonetheless
entertaining, nostalgia trip.  The costumes also beautifully evoke the
era.  200 Cigarettes will largely appeal to audiences who still
remember this era with a great deal of fondness and who have not yet
grown sick of this whole '80's shtick.</P>
