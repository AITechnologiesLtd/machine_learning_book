                        SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                  1 :-)  for this ongoing Tibetan Saga</PRE>

<P>In that distant far off ‘Shangri-La' known as Lhasa,
Lived a monk with a music box known as the Dalai Lama.
He carried a love for worms and picture theatres,
And a thirst for knowledge about how the world works around us.</P>
<P>>From the midst of troubled Europe on the brink of worldly war,
Journeyed a fair hair adventurer with wife and child unwanted.
Escaping the strife of Nazi patriotism, angry and bitter,
Come to conquer a Himalayan mountain with virgin snow uncharted.</P>
<P>An Avalanche stops this most noteworthy climb,
And flings the man into a British prison bind.
Escape he does to roam the winter wild,
Short on food, with scarcely little water.
With frost bitten feet and bruised from bandit bashings,
This lost soul somehow finds his way to ‘Shangri-La'.</P>
<P>Starved and hungered,
Made to feed on the scraps of dogs,
Pity falls on those in greatest need.
Favour finds its way to the highest seat,
With shelter and clothes made to fit this European man in deed.</P>
<P>Love finds its way in the strangest place,
Whether tinker, tailor, soldier, spy,
I think love falls on the one with the prettiest eyes.
Behold two men in love and only one object of affection,
Methinks the winner is not the one with the fairest complexion.</P>
<P>Friendship grows from the roughest ground,
This young man shunned once to often in love,
Finds a friend in the young Dalai of Lamas.
So from this strange company of men,
One finds healing and the other information.</P>
<P>So I wish this tale could have a happy end,
But alas the Opera continues as China forces Tibet to be her concubine.
So methinks it's time for a formal separation,
But I think I had better leave this issue in the hands of the United
Nations.</P>
