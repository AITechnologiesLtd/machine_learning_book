                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>A sappy independent, Two Family House creates a romantic dramady out of
the two unlikeliest characters -- a tubby married Italian guy who lives
in Staten Island (Michael Rispoli) and a pregnant, Scottish import
(Trainspotting's Kelly Macdonald) married to a bum.</P>
<P>Love at first sight?  Not quite, but you can be sure writer/director
Raymond De Felitta is going to get us there in short order.</P>
<P>Indeed, if you buy De Felitta's rosy outlook on life, all it takes is a
pair of dreamers to make a love connection.  Buddy (Rispoli) has failed
at every entrepreneurial venture in his life; his latest scheme is to
open a bar in the house he just bought while he and the wife (Katherine
Narducci) live upstairs.  He even plans to provide the entertainment via
his celebrated crooning.  Too bad the place upstairs is occupied by a
drunk and his pregnant wife Mary (Macdonald) -- and we soon discover
she's pregnant by yet another guy when a half-black, half-white baby
pops out.  In fact -- the whole film is narrated by the newborn, even
while he's in the womb.  (Er... okay.)  Soon enough the bum is gone,
Mary is evicted, and somehow she and Buddy are in love and having an
affair.  Not one of those dirty, adulterous affairs -- one of those
nice, movie affairs.</P>
<P>All of this sounds sickly sweet to describe and it's even worse on
screen, where you have to contend with non-stop, mind-numbing narration
plus endless, syrupy mandolin music to remind us that Buddy is Italian. 
It all comes off like a bad episode of The King of Queens, just moved to
a different borough.</P>
<P>Not that it isn't without its moments.  Macdonald is cute (though
unlikable) and the same goes for Rispoli, too.  Nice house to visit --
but I wouldn't want to live there.</P>
