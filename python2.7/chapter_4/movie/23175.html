<P>When I envision a beach, I think of an undisturbed sandy white plain,
with waves of glaciated water lightly caressing the shoreline in
peaceful transition. Leonardo DiCaprio's latest offering, vaguely titled
`The Beach', is nothing of the sort. It's more like a rocky terrain of
jagged frustration and unneeded obstacles, with the oncoming waves
pounding the shore with such force that the effect should be deafening.
Instead, it's nothing more than a repressed whisper. But enough with the
metaphors.</P>
<P>Unlike a large fragment of the population - namely younger females - I
do not consider myself to be a diehard Leo fanatic. I do concede that
the kid has acting abilities, which were showcased in a certain boat
movie involving an iceberg.... Oh, yes - `Titanic'. Given the incoherent
catastrophe surrounding him, DiCaprio's resolute performance is actually
one of the positive aspects of `The Beach'. Playing Richard, an American
boy wishing to seek refuge from the boring squabble of everyday living,
DiCaprio is believable and compelling. I wasn't concerned about being
properly persuaded by the actor, and he delivers sufficiently. Sadly,
Danny Boyle (whose work includes the maniacally macabre `Shallow Grave'
and `Trainspotting') offers no sign of destination in the director's
chair. After a set-up bubbling with intriguing promise, Boyle reveals
his movie serves no purpose. Perhaps after the first half of shooting
was completed, the director sat back to contemplate the question
`Sooo... where are we going from here?'</P>
<P>The script is weak and meandering, but at least `The Beach' looks
pretty. The story follows Richard, who hooks up with a French couple
(Guillame Canet and Virginie Ledoyen) in a cockroach-infested Thailand
hotel and goes on a mission to reach a secret beach. A map to this
supposed paradise was given to Richard by an eccentric Brit named Daffy
(Robert Carlyle), who commits gory suicide immediately following. Once
the determined trio reach the destination, they find 1) an enormous
marijuana plantation; 2) a band of willful civilians led by the
authoritative Sal (Tilda Swinton); and 3) an enclosed island paradise
unlike anything they've ever seen. This is where the seductive visual
radiance of `The Beach' really proves to be a valuable asset. Aside from
that, DiCaprio and a terrific soundtrack, the film is nothing more than
a pulpy mirage of lost meaning. Even through a series of weird and
supposedly profound events leading up to the denouement, I was unable to
determine the real purpose of `The Beach'. Perhaps I'm just daft, but I
was confused.</P>
<P>Some of Boyle's irregular humor helps matters....like a surreal sequence
that pits Richard, bordering on insanity, into a live-action video game
in the jungle. But unfortunately, all other vital aspects are drowned in
favor of the meaningless plot. The romance between Leo and co-star
Ledoyen is flat and uninviting. For such a fuss to be made over their
romantic connection, more sparks should have definitely been generated.
Tilda Swinton is quite good as ring leader Sal, but she also gets dealt
a character too conventional to be really striking. It all boils down to
the prettiness of `The Beach'. Those nice aerial shots of the lightly
tinted ocean, the glimmer of the sand once they arrive.... all this
photographic style and glamour seems to be in a movie different from the
murky final product.</P>
<P>Also be forewarned of the violence level, which is extreme, particularly
due to some of the grisly after-effects of a shark attack. At any rate,
the plentiful swarm of young ladies dedicated to Leo are going to find
squat to like about `The Beach' (save for Leo himself). It's also not a
film for those who enjoy inner meaning and moralizing with their cinema.
Although it goes to great lengths to achieve a purpose, `The Beach'
simply cannot find a satisfying comfort zone. Those looking for a
rewarding experience are going to be frustrated, so take my advice:
avoid `The Beach'. You'll find the waters too rough.</P>
