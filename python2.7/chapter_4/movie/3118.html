<PRE>                             THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Linda Fiorentino, Peter Berg, Bill Pullman, J. T. Walsh.
Screenplay:  Steve Barancik.
Director:  John Dahl.</P>
<P>     John Dahl has to be considered one of the most unlikely success
stories of recent years.  Last year, his made-for-cable film RED ROCK
WEST found a second life in a few art houses around the country, and
became something of a cult hit.  THE LAST SEDUCTION also made its first
appearance on cable earlier this year, but from the looks of things,
Dahl will be able to make a few films directly for the big screen if he
so chooses.  Film noir has been a hot genre lately, and few directors
with more established reputations are making them better than John
Dahl.  THE LAST SEDUCTION is a wonderfully nasty piece of work, sparked
by Linda Fiorentino's bad-to-the-bone lead performance.</P>
<P>     Fiorentino plays Bridget Gregory, a New York City telemarketing
manager with ambition and attitude.  After her husband Clay (Bill
Pullman), a shady doctor, scores $100,000 selling pharmaceutical
cocaine to pay off a loan shark, Bridget takes the money and runs.  She
ends up in Beston, an upstate town too small for her big plans, but
she's forced to stay put to avoid being found by Clay.  In Beston
Bridget hooks up with Mike Swale (Peter Berg), an earnest young fellow
who falls hard for her.  With Mike in the palm of her hand, and Clay
and his detectives hot on her trail, Bridget sets in motion a
convoluted plan manipulating everyone and everything in her way.</P>
<P>     The critical error many recent film noir attempts have made (the
abysmal COLOR OF NIGHT comes most quickly to mind) is that they operate
on the premise that all you need are minimalist lighting and a few plot
twists to maintain audience interest.  Characters become props holding
up a plot, rather than the elements that drive the plot.  Dahl and
screenwriter Steve Barancik do not make that error.  Everything
revolves around the interactions between Bridget, Clay and Mike, and
all three are well-constructed characters.  Bill Pullman, who has been
making a career out of playing the spurned nice guy (SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE, MALICE) takes on the role of spurned not-so-nice-guy Clay and
attacks it with gusto.  His seething disgust at having underestimated
Bridget once becomes a fierce determination to get back at her, but he
is completely unprepared for the lengths to which she'll go.  Peter
Berg is excellent as the big-hearted small-town boy who longs to break
free to the big time, and latches on to his love for Bridget as his
best chance to motivate himself after a disastrous first attempt to
leave Beston.  In order for THE LAST SEDUCTION to work to the fullest,
Berg has to convince us that there's a reason besides simple naivete
that he stays with Bridget, and he makes Mike's need genuine.</P>
<P>     However, everyone else is just renting screen time from Linda
Fiorentino; she owns the show.  Her Bridget is a creature of pure ego
and ambition, and as such there is always the chance that she might
seem beyone accepting as a real person.  Occasionally, that seems to be
the case.  Because Barancik deliberately avoids providing us with any
easy motivation for Bridget's actions (a troubled childhood, for
example), her calculation becomes a bit difficult to swallow in one
gulp.  But Fiorentino is so alive in this part that she makes Bridget
real, and her glee is infectuous.  She is at her best when using
stereotypical assumptions about women to her advantage, such as a scene
where she brings cookies out to the detective who is keeping an eye on
her so that she can plant nails under his tires, or one where she
convinces Mike that she loves him by plainting a note showing his name
in a little heart for him to find.  Bridget's most valuable asset is
that nobody quite believes that she can be as amoral as she seems, and
consequently she is able to catch everyone at their most vulnerable.</P>
<P>     THE LAST SEDUCTION's plot does have the requisite twists, turns
and surprises, but none of them are particularly jaw-dropping.  Dahl
and Barancik are more concerned with tone and character, and deliver in
both categories.  But if there is one aspect of the story which is
truly impressive, it is what *doesn't* happen.  The formulaic qualities
of so many movies have conditioned us to expect a comeuppance for
characters like Bridget at a specific plot point; however, at crucial
moments when it seems that she's made a critical mistake, she's still
one step ahead.  Clockwork plots like THE LAST SEDUCTION can sometimes
seem too contrived for their own good, and some viewere might find it
simply too cold.  Many others will find Fiorentino and THE LAST
SEDUCTION the perfect antidote to the recent glut of stylish but
vacuous blockbusters.</P>
