<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   In terms of filmgoing, there is little which wounds the heart more
   than watching an accomplished talent having their services wasted in
   an unambitious film project.  It was maddening enough to suffer
   through Mira Sorvino wallowing through a determinedly generic MIMIC a
   few months ago, but the suspense-thriller KISS THE GIRLS is a far
   more egregious offender, ensnaring the stellar talents of Morgan
   Freeman and Ashley Judd in a formulaic film which proves to be far
   beneath them.</P>
<P>   I sat through the screening stupefied, bewildered as to what could
   have drawn these two gifted performers to this project.  Mr. Freeman
   is surely one of the truly great actors currently working -- his mere
   presence onscreen commands attention like no other American actor,
   and his marvelously expressive voice conveys bountiful wisdom. 
   Meanwhile, Ms. Judd is one of today's most exciting young actors,
   turning in a flurry of astonishingly accomplished performances since
   her feature film debut in Victor Nunez's RUBY IN PARADISE -- not even
   the sheer brevity of her turns in Wayne Wang's SMOKE and Oliver
   Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS (where her footage was ultimately
   excised for the domestic theatrical release) could prevent her from
   outshining the vast majority of lead performances seen in recent
   film.  What on earth could these two have seen in KISS THE GIRLS
   which would have drawn them to the film?</P>
<P>   It surely couldn't have been David Klass' screenplay, which is
   woefully uninspired and formulaic -- one can literally tick off every
   tired convention in KISS THE GIRLS like a checklist.  The film opens
   most unpromisingly with the obligatory scene to establish the prowess
   of Washington D.C. forensic psychologist Alex Cross (he faces a
   suicidal woman) -- which, incidentally, seems rather superfluous with
   Mr. Freeman onboard as the character; it goes without saying that the
   instant he appears onscreen, the audience immediately associates his
   character with supreme competency -- and continues to throw in every
   hoary staple of the serial killer thriller genre: the stakeouts, the
   taunting messages from the killer, the near-captures, chase scenes
   galore, preferably on foot in some gloomy, obstacle-ridden area.  To
   capitalize on the cyber-craze, there's even an Internet reference
   (although thankfully it's not as overblown as it was in Jon Amiel's
   otherwise superior genre entry COPYCAT).  While it's bad enough that
   the screenplay by Mr. Klass is so by-the-numbers, what's even worse
   is the lack of interesting or inventive dialogue to buoy the film; in
   every aspect, this is a remarkably bland script.</P>
<P>   Many have drawn parallels between Mr. Freeman's similar character
   types in David Fincher's SE7EN (where he plays veteran homicide
   detective Somerset) and in KISS THE GIRLS, but despite their shared
   genre, there is clearly no comparison between these two vastly
   disparate films in terms of effectiveness -- only one of these films
   generates anything remotely close to resembling a facsimile of
   suspense or tension.  It's rather abysmal that the inherently
   gruesome situation of a crazed abductor on the prowl can wind up
   being so bla, and rather amazing that the film's protagonists do
   not prove to be compelling, even when they're placed into jeopardy.
   One ends up watching KISS THE GIRLS with a great deal of disinterest.</P>
<P>   KISS THE GIRLS focuses on the hunt for a North Carolina man (who goes
   by the name Casanova) that "collects": he methodically stalks,
   kidnaps, imprisons and rapes (and occasionally kills) young, pretty,
   college-age women. The film attempts to intrigue by teasing at the
   killer's identity; until the film's climax, his face is
   systematically obscured, although anyone not lulled by the film's
   sheer familiarity into a comatose state should realise his identity
   within the first fifteen minutes (and, if not, the tactless lingering
   shots on Casanova's alter-ego by sophomore feature film director Gary
   Fleder should be a sure giveaway), but one can hardly even care who
   he is, given the lacklustre attention paid to him in the film.  For a
   serial killer/rapist film, KISS THE GIRLS is mighty disinterested in
   the serial killer; Casanova's actions are obviously supposed to be
   construed as monstrous and lurid, and yet the film distinctly
   neglects him and never really delves its focus into his twisted
   world.  We can't even really stir up much compassion for his captives
   either, as we barely see them onscreen and they barely register.
   When one contrasts Brooke Smith's terrifying struggle in the well in
   Jonathan Demme's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS with KISS THE GIRLS' group
   of imprisoned girls catatonically assembled in the killer's chamber
   of horrors while Alex's niece Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera) plays the
   violin, it is clear how much the filmmakers here have missed the
   mark.  Even the subterranean dungeon, glimpsed all-too-briefly, lacks
   any foreboding aura of dread or menace.</P>
<P>   Kate McTiernan (Ms. Judd) is a interning med student who's snatched
   from her home by Casanova in the early goings, and locked into a
   dungeon-like cell.  Forbidden to call for help and warned not to try
   to use any of her kickboxing arsenal on him, she naturally does both.
   (The scene in the dungeon where Kate persuades her unseen fellow
   captives to reluctantly call out their names in an act of defiance to
   Casanova is meant to be powerfully haunting and creepy, but frankly
   reminded me of a television commercial.)  After Kate unloads on
   Casanova and manages to escape from the dungeon, she finds herself in
   a madly dashing through a nondescript barren forest, her abductor in
   hot pursuit.  Even Kate's flee through the woods, clearly intended to
   echo the similar scene in Tobe Hooper's classic THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW
   MASSACRE, is merely a pale imitation: the sequence in Mr. Hooper's
   film depicted terror in its most primal form; in KISS THE GIRLS, it
   just looks like cinematographer Aaron Schneider kept falling over.</P>
<P>   In fact, Mr. Fleder, whose first film was THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN
   YOU'RE DEAD, seems to be a fan of using disorientation as a
   substitute for dynamism, both in Kate's escape scene and in her
   kickboxing scenes, where a flurry of shots of flying fists, swinging
   legs, and sweaty torsos make do in place of a choreographed,
   simple-to-follow kinetic sequence.  It's distracting and nonsensical,
   and ultimately makes for rather aggravating viewing.</P>
<P>   By the climax of KISS THE GIRLS, I had gone from shaking my head in
   disbelief to holding it in disgust, as the heroes and the villain
   face off in typical fashion, and seem to lose 50 I.Q. points along
   the way.  The predictable battle-to-the-death conclusion is tired
   material, and this film takes the policy of dispatching the villain
   in an original fashion to ridiculous new ends; as the heroic music
   swelled in its aftermath, it was all I could do from laughing aloud.</P>
<P>   There are a lot of leaps in the storyline for KISS THE GIRLS, and
   numerous characters who essentially serve no point are are probably
   carry-overs from the novel (which, clearly, I haven't read).  The
   film's strengths are predictable -- the performances of Mr. Freeman
   and Ms. Judd, who customarily turn in solid, professional work and
   manage to elevate the film to near-mediocrity; they're literally the
   only reason to catch KISS THE GIRLS.</P>
<P>   So why did Mr. Freeman and Ms. Judd sign on for this project?  I'm
   guessing here, but it's probably the case that they were both fans of
   James Patterson's best-selling novel, which served as the source
   material for the screenplay.  I, however, would like to delude myself
   into believing that they had signed onto this project for the
   opportunity to work with each other, and that consequently KISS THE
   GIRLS didn't end up being a complete waste for them.</P>
