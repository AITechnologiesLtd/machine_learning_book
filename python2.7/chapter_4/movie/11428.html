<PRE>CRIMSON TIDE (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
(re-watched and re-written March 8, 1998)
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Looking at some of Tony Scott's movies (Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and The
Last Boy Scout) it is hard to accept that Crimson Tide is a movie of his.
It is even harder to accept that Crimson Tide is a Jerry Bruckheimer and
Don Simpson production. As you look at the visual style of Crimson Tide it
is obvious that this is a Tony Scott movie and it is a Bruckheimer and
Simpson production.</P>
<P>Why do I say that it is hard to accept that Crimson Tide is a Tony Scott
movie? Because Crimson Tide is so intelligent, so character focused, and
the action so tight that it seems anomalous to previous
Scott/Bruckheimer/Simpson productions. In previous Tony Scott movies, such
as Top Gun, the action was wildly over-the-top and the characterization
mere one-dimensional -- enough to keep the movie going and enough to keep
the action coming. But, this anomalous movie, Crimson Tide, from Tony Scott
shows that he can do a movie that is all gloss but filled with characters
that we care for and are truly dimensional and layered.</P>
<P>Gene Hackman is Captain Frank Ramsey, captain of the nuclear submarine
Alabama. His XO, executive officer, is out with appendicitis, and he needs
a new one. Why? Because his boat is about to set sail to take care of some
hostile rebels in Russia who have seized a military base and is threatening
a missile attack on the US. The new XO that Ramsey picks is Lt. Commander
Hunter, played by Denzel Washington. These two men are exact opposites.
Ramsey is a simple man that follows orders without having to know why.
Hunter, a Harvard trained officer, wants to know why before doing
something. This puts the men at odds when trouble arises. And trouble
arises when they are forced to consider firing their nuclear missiles. It
is a broken EAM (Emergency Action Message) transmission that puts these two
men at odds. Should they fire their missiles? Or should they get confirmation?</P>
<P>The script by Michael Schiffer gives the audience many things to think
about when all hell breaks loose on the Alabama. Both Ramsey and Hunter are
correct in what they are doing on the ship -- but in the same sense both of
them are also completely wrong in what they are doing. Ramsey and Hunter
cause a mutiny aboard the Alabama and the crew is split between the two
head men. Both men believe that they are correct and in my eyes I believe
that they are both correct also. So, there lies the dilemma proposed by
Schiffer: Who is right onboard a nuclear missile submarine when there is no
chain of command left? And following this why is the chain of command
important?</P>
<P>Early in Crimson Tide, it boldly mentions other great sub movies as if to
taunt the audience to compare those classics with Crimson Tide. And, if one
were take the challenge up and compare Crimson Tide to the movies mentioned
--The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep -- Crimson Tide would stand
proudly next to them. Instead of putting out a completely mindless action
movie where the two men battle it out with flying bullets and fists,
Crimson Tide is the battle of will between the two men. The film makes the
audience think with the two men, about the consequences of their actions
and who is really right. Though I was more sympathetic and understanding to
Washington's Hunter, Hackman's Ramsey was not all wrong either.</P>
<P>Washington gives a great performance as Hunter. He presents Hunter as a
strong willed man who is not afraid to take a stand -- against even a
superior -- when he believes that he is right. Hackman also does a great
job with Ramsey. Hackman gives a layered performance, putting a happy easy
going exterior to Ramsey, but showing the darker interior from time to
time. It is the performances of these two that carry Crimson Tide. But, the
supporting cast also gives great performances. These include Matt Craven,
Rocky Carroll, Danny Nucci, and Lillo Brancato. The strongest supporting
actor in Crimson Tide would be a toss up between Viggo Mortensen as the one
man that holds the second set of keys to the nuclear missiles and George
Dzundza as the by-the-books Chief of the Boat.</P>
<P>Crimson Tide has a lot of action in it; but surprisingly enough the action
is not the main focus of the film. Rather the focus of the film is of the
two main characters and of the two ideologies that these characters carry
with them. The action is handled well by Scott, but it seems that Scott has
a newfound way of integrating the action with the characters.</P>
<P>By all means, Crimson Tide is one of the most enjoyable films made. It is
well directed, well acted, and well scripted. Tony Scott knows how to build
up emotions throughout the film and does it well. The film will not only
makes you think, it will also entertain you. Crimson Tide is a film that
works on two levels: One while you're in the theatre gasping for breathe
along with the sailors on the screen when they are in danger. And the
second when you leave the theatre it works on a level that makes you gnaw
over what was presented to you. Sure, this doesn't feel like a Tony Scott
film at first, but you'll get used to it. And I hope Tony Scott can put out
more great films like Crimson Tide. Don't Miss Crimson Tide.</P>
