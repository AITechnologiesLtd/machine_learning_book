<PRE>CECIL B. DEMENTED
-----------------</PRE>
<P>Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) is in Baltimore for the world premiere
benefit of her latest flick, an event chosen by Cecil B. Demented (Stephen 
Dorff, "Blade") for her kidnapping.  Demented and his band of Sprockets
are cinema guerillas who promote anarchic filmmaking and the death of the
multiplex mainstream in director John Waters' "Cecil B. Demented."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>John Waters has just about attained respectability in recent years with
his sweet natured "Pecker," satiric "Serial Mom" and nostalgic "Hairspray."
"Cecil B. Demented" begins with the audacious mania and low budget looks
of his earlier cult flicks.  Unfortunately, it can't sustain its cool
concept and devolves into a drive-in dumpster denouement.</P>
<P>The film begins promisingly, with movie marquees touting either "Star Wars"
or "Star Trek" in all of a six screen multiplex, "Scream 4," a Pauly
Shore marathon and (gasp) "Patch Adams, the Director's Cut."</P>
<P>The gloriously spoiled Honey Whitlock, so pampered she demands her 
assistant find out whether Pat Nixon had sex in her 'presidential' suite,
puts on her fake face for the dignitaries she's just dissed while 
turning her ugly face to everyone else.  Meanwhile, back at the Senator
Theater, Cecil and his Sprockets, all employed by the theater, are
setting their trap.  When Whitlock wiggles her way onto the stage, Cecil
and his gang grab her.  Weapons are drawn and a bomb goes
off.  'Power to the People!' and 'Punish bad cinema!' they cry before
loading Honey into their van and absconding to their closed movie theater
lair.</P>
<P>Here we get introduced to the gang, who have been sworn to a vow of celibacy 
for Demented until their film is completed.  Cherish (Alicia Witt, TV's "Cybil")
is a former porn star and Cecil's horny girlfriend.  Lyle (Adrian Grenier,
"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole") an actor zonked out on drugs of every
sort ('Before I was a drug addict, I had so many problems.  Now I only have
one.').  Aggressive cinematographer Pam (Erika Lynn Rupli, sound person and
aspiring rap star Chardonnay (Zenzele Uzoma), art director by way of staple
gun Lewis (Larry Gilliard, Jr., "The Waterboy") and satanic makeup girl Ravel 
(Maggie Gyllenhaal) comprise most of the crew.  Hairdresser Rodney (Jack
Noseworthy, "U571"), who hates himself for being straight, terrorizes
Honey with his harsh dye jobs ('I hate roots!').  The weakest link to
Cecil's cause is Fidget, the costumer, whose parents (Patricia Hearst
plays his mom) still have too much control over him.</P>
<P>After threatening Honey to star in his movie, Cecil and the sprockets
hit the streets for guerilla filmmaking, terrorizing film audiences
everywhere.  Soon Honey becomes bound to the cause, especially as she
realizes her new outlaw notoriety is the best thing to happen to her
career in ages (Eric Roberts makes a cameo as her ex-husband on Roseanne
Barr's talk show).  They fight parents of small children ('Family's just
another word for censorship!' Honey screams), crash local film events
(where Cecil convinces Honey to jump off a roof) and invade the filmming
of "Forrest Gump II" starring Kevin Nealon (as himself).  Lives are
lost, but the cause is strong, and local kung fu fans and a porn house
help protect them (the porn house is showing one of Cherish's old films
in which she has an adventure with a gerbil).</P>
<P>While all this may sound like inspired lunacy, it's only fitfully funny.
Water's best and sliest joke is his parody of former SLA terrorist
and heiress Patty Hearst within Honey Whitlock's transformation.  His
screenplay has several fizzy ideas, but on the screen they play flat,
particularly the film's climax which is simply filmed anarchy.  To his
credit, Waters' film looks like the guerilla filmmaking he's portraying.</P>
<P>Melanie Griffith is more than a good sport here - she was meant to play this 
role and gives it her all.  Stephen Dorff is over the top as the maniacal 
Demented, with his punk hair style, rolling eyes and tattoos (all the 
Sprockets boast tattoos of cult directors such as Herschel Gordon Lewis and 
Werner Rainer Fassbinder).  None of the Sprockets particularly stand out, 
although Witt goes to town in her porn piece.  Former Waters' stars Mink Stole 
and Ricki Lake have cameos.</P>
<P>While it was initially exciting to see the 'old' John Waters style 
back on the screen, it looks like he should stick to what works for him
now.  "Cecil B. Demented" is the personification of the adage 'You can't
go home again.'</P>
