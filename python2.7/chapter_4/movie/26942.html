<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An amazingly strange film, confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable, but a
film I found more interesting than I thought possible at first viewing.
This experimental film in minimalist story telling, a film consisting of
disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue, had a concept that was
greater than how the film turned out. It felt at times like I was
watching paint dry on the wall, but the reward for sitting through those
excruciatingly redundant scenes, was in seeing something different,
something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident, as I
believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice
in commenting on the violence in American society, especially against
women. The film uses its impressions of the Marine base as a metaphor
for the social violence in today's American society, and to give it its
startling look of reality, marines were used as the actors. It was
filmed at Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., the largest Marine base in the
country, which is located in the Mojave Desert.</P>
<P>The plot is simple. It is about a real incident that happened to a U.S.
Marine returning from the Persian Gulf War who murdered his wife and was
caught at sunrise digging her grave in the Mojave Desert by a military
patrol. The film tells its story by showing the military police by the
murder site making small talk while awaiting for the arrest to be
completed and the marines off base relaxing in a country-and-western
lounge, as some marines lewdly dance in front of some female patrons.
The film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in
conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to
little snippets of, hearing mostly their curse words. The captain in
charge of the arrest is Tinka Menkes, the director's sister. She tries
to get the male marines to take this incident seriously and act
professional, as they treat her as an outsider but with proper military
respect. Because the film had no linear story and followed no
chronological order, and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base
and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is
filmed, it appeared surreal.</P>
<P>For whatever reason, Nina Menkes (The Great Sadness of Zohara (1984)/
Magdalena Viraga (1987)/Queen of Diamonds (1991)), a director I am not
familiar with, has chosen to put parts of "Macbeth" into the film (the
disembodied voice of the murdered wife is heard at times as the voice of
a violated spirit), along with scenes from northeast Africa (Tinka is
sitting naked in the forest clearing, writing unreadable words on her
arm). There is also a riderless black horse going on the base, and the
film ends on a quote from the Book of Genesis, about Lot's wife turned
into a pillar of salt when she looked back. I thought these additions
seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext.</P>
<P>The arrested marine is not seen in total, but is viewed from side
glances of him in the same car as his bloodied dead wife. A military
policeman is seen shoving the marine's face into his dead wife's bloody
lap and yelling some nearly inaudible obscenities at him. The film tells
nothing about the why and how of the murder, but touches on the reality
of life on the Marine base, making it seem like a wasteland inhabited
only by those sent to purgatory. The unsettling milieu in which the
crime took place, speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken
place.</P>
<P>The film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what
we've seen. Though the film was dull and did not move me while I was
watching it, it did something to me afterwards intellectually, it made
me think of a military base, the Persian Gulf War, and of marital abuse,
but it made me think of them without the usual concepts I bring to my
thinking cap. Does that make this a great film? No. But it makes it an
interesting one, a film that I can't easily dismiss. Its filming of the
arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary
about the crime scene, is the understated reason for the origin of the
violence, contrary to the way Hollywood films portray violence. Here it
is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but, perhaps, one
doesn't really understand
or want to understand what evil society has created.</P>
