<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Open Secret is a quality story, but is a cheaply produced B-film with
similar themes about anti-Semitism as "Crossfire" and "Gentleman's
Agreement." A young couple, Paul Lester (Ireland), and his attractive
bride Nancy (Randolph), on their honeymoon, call up Paul's army buddy Ed
Stevens (Waldron). He tells them he has to go out an emergency, but he
will leave them the key with his landlord and they are welcome to stay
with him. When he doesn't show up the next day, they get concerned. The
landlady (O'Neal) is told her tenant is missing and she keeps Nancy
company while hubby investigates; she also tells them Ed had lost his
job recently.</P>
<P>They find anti-Semitic literature in the apartment, and Paul says that's
not like the Ed he knew. A man from Snap magazine (Farley) comes by and
says Ed promised him a story, but didn't say what it was. With Ed still
missing, Paul calls his friend from the police department Detective
Sergeant Mike Frontelli (Sheldon Leonard) to investigate. This is one of
the rare occasions that Leonard played a cop instead of a gangster.</P>
<P>Paul soon uncovers that Paul belonged to a secret anti-Semitic
organization with a bunch of white supremacists from the neighborhood.
When it is discovered that Ed is murdered, Paul decides to stay in town
and clear his pal's name. The couple innocently bring in photos
they took on their honeymoon to have Harry Strauss (Tyne) develop them.
They find out from him that there is prejudice against the Jews in the
neighborhood recently, as Strauss tells them there's a group trying to
put him out of business because he's a Jew.</P>
<P>The couple discovers when looking at the photos returned to them, that
Ed was secretly taking pictures of the extremist group members and was
ready to turn it over to the magazine. The hate group now goes after the
couple to try and get the pictures back. When Paul figures out that the
group framed Ed for the murder of another Jewish man, he decides to
confront one of the weaker members by showing him a picture they have of
him in the act of the crime. But Paul's overtaken by the group and his
life is threatened, as he is taken back to the bar the group hangs out
in.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>The climax is action-packed as Strauss is also taken by the group when
he comes looking for Paul, but he leads them into a trap by taking one
of them back to his photo store for the negatives. He is able to
overtake his captor and call the police. The twist in the story, is that
the magazine reporter is an ambitious politician who used an alias and
is really the secret leader of this group.</P>
<PRE>The story should hold your interest.</PRE>
