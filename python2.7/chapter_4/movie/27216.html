<P>Can you ever have enough Dracula movies? Yeah, probably. But this time
around, filmmakers have given the ol' man a little MTV twist for the kids
and a new look at his origins. Was I looking forward to seeing this movie?
Certainly not. The trailer was pretty lame and it basically looked like
another generic teen horror flick with Dracula in there just for kicks. I
was expecting bad acting, plot holes galore and some pretty bad effects.
What did I get? Find out below.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The most popular vampire in the world, Dracula, is once again unleashed upon
an unsuspecting modern-day world. This time around, the bloodsucker wants to
grab himself a specific soul, one that belongs to the daughter of the man
who caught and incarcerated him for over 100 years.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A fun vampire movie. This film was quite the surprise for me. It actually
featured some okay acting, an interesting plot line, lotsa blood and some
pretty cool effects. It also wasn't as cheesy as I thought it was gonna be,
and featured plenty of bloodsucking, decapitations, neck bitings and sexy
women with heaving bosoms. Now how could you go wrong with that? Seriously
though, this flick is sure to be a nice treat for anyone who enjoys vampire
flicks and heavy soundtracks, and those who don't mind a new twist on a
renowned character. In fact, the revelation at the end of this movie about
the origins of Dracula is both unique and believable. I bought it and I
certainly bought most of the movie, which despite a nice groove, doesn't
really offer a lot of depth (if that's what you're looking for). But the
movie never bored me either, as it moved from bloody impalings to bloody
Matrix-esque fights to bloody heads flying all over the place. And you gotta
admire that in any vampire movie! God knows that any film featuring a man
who sucks blood for a living, is required to have lotsa crimson wetness
splashing around.</P>
<P>I was however disappointed with the lack of T&A in the movie. I mean,
there's a time and place for T&A and this was it! Mardi Gras? Sexy
vampiresses? C'mon! If you're gonna have this much violence in a movie, how
about lightening up our mood every now and then with some nifty boob shots.
Then again, maybe that's just my Jerry Ryan fixation talking...hehehe. In
the end, the movie entertained me and that is what I generally look for in
most films. If the film manages to entertain me during its entire runtime,
it's generally worthy of at least one look (according to me). One thing did
kinda stick out in my mind though. Despite enjoying the lead Dracula's
performance in the film, I do think that a "cooler" looking Dracul would've
been a better choice. This dude just looked too much like that singer from
the 80s, Richard Marx, and his puffy hair just bothered me throughout. A
slicker Prince of Darkness might've been able to elevate this film to a
certain cult-ish level. But in the end, I still consider this movie to be a
novel adaptation of an old time legend. Definitely geared more towards the
teens, but enough cheap scares for pretty much anyone looking for some
enjoyable bloody fun.</P>
