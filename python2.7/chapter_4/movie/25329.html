<PRE>_X-Men_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>As geeky as it sounds, I must admit it--when it comes to _X-Men_, I am
what is called a "fanboy."  I grew up fervently following the comic book
exploits of the team whose membership is made of genetically evolved,
superpowered "mutants."  Seeing a group of guys and gals kicking serious
ass with their superhuman abilities is undoubtedly a major factor in my
(and many others') interest, but what has made _X-Men_ so popular--and
very passionately so, at that--are the realistic characters, authentic
people who just happen to have powers.  And while most comics treat their
heroes' and heroines' abilities as simply a cool gift, for the X-Men and
mutants in general, it is also very much a curse; much like any other
minorities, mutants face severe prejudice from the rest of the
population.</P>
<P>So adapting _X-Men_ and its sprawling, 30-year-plus history into a
100-minute feature film is a dicey proposition for any filmmaker, and
even moreso for one who was not a fan to begin with--such as Bryan
Singer, who is at the helm of Fox's lavish, long-awaited $80-million
extravaganza.  Not only must he appease the fanboys by not deviating too
far from the source material, he must also make what is essentially a
three-decade-long-and-counting soap opera accessible to the non-fan.  And
contrary to fans' greatest fears, Singer's _X-Men_ is an exciting,
fast-paced adventure that will satisfy both audiences.</P>
<P>For a summer blockbuster--especially one based on a comic book--an
$80-million budget is a pittance, but it's an appropriate figure for
_X-Men_.  Spectacular visual effects are called for (and are effectively
employed) to bring the team's powers to life, but the budget limitation
forces the filmmakers to make the effects a carefully used enhancement of
the story and characters, which are hence given more weight (as they
always had been in the comic).</P>
<P>For the most part, credited scripter David Hayter and a gaggle of
uncredited scribes (including Singer's Oscar-winning _Usual_Suspects_
partner Christopher McQuarrie and _Buffy_ maestro Joss Whedon) succeed in
making the characters mirror their counterparts on the page.  The X-Men
is a team of mutants led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a
powerful telepath who runs a school for "gifted youngsters" and fights
for mutant tolerance.  As the film begins, his team consists of Jean Grey
(Famke Janssen), a telekinetic (i.e., can move objects with her mind) and
a telepath herself; Scott Summers, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden), who
cannot control his deadly optic blasts; and Ororo Monroe, a.k.a. Storm
(Halle Berry), who can control the weather.</P>
<P>Those established members, however, take a backseat in the film to the
new recruits, Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna
Paquin).  The wild, mysterious Wolverine is perhaps best known for his
retractable, razor-sharp claws made of the indestructible metal
adamantium (his entire skeleton is also bonded with it), but his mutant
abilities are heightened senses and a rapid healing factor.  Rogue can
absorb a person's lifeforce, personality, and memories (and, in the case
of other mutants, powers) with a single touch.  After discovering her
ability after kissing her boyfriend, a distraught Rogue flees her native
Mississippi for snowy Canada, where she meets Wolverine.  When the two
are attacked by the evil and animalistic Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), it's
Storm and Cyclops to the rescue, and Wolverine and Rogue soon find
themselves getting acquainted with the ways of Xavier's school.</P>
<P>Jackman, an unknown Australian actor known for his musical theater
credits, and the teenage Paquin were Singer's two most controversial
casting choices.  Only one will completely win over skeptical fans:
Jackman, who completely inhabits Wolvie's wild, woolly persona; from his
first scene, fans should have no doubt about the actor's ability to
embody the character's trademark ferocity.  Paquin will have a harder
time of convincing the fanboys.  Young, waifish, and unglamorous, she in
no way resembles (in appearance and temperament) the sexy, sassy,
voluptuous, and now-20something comic book Rogue (the team's most popular
female member).  But within the context of the film's story--that is, as
a "starting point" Rogue--her casting is understandable, and aside from
an inconsistent Southern accent, Paquin is perfectly adequate.  Even so,
for the inevitable sequel, I suggest Singer pull an Anakin Skywalker and
age Rogue a few years by way of a recast--and thus bringing to the screen
the true Rogue fans know and love.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Rogue is the character that is least true to her
printed incarnation.  In addition to the change in age, she is given a
real name (Marie), and her upbringing by evil mutant shapeshifter
Mystique (and, hence, Rogue's history as a villain) is completely
jettisoned.  Mystique does appear in the film (played by Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos), but only as part of a fairly faceless support team (along
with Sabretooth and the aptly named Toad, played by Ray Park) for the
film's central villain, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto is an old friend
of Xavier's, but the two drifted apart over their difference of
philosophy.  Xavier believes that there is hope for regular humans to
accept mutantkind, but Magneto doesn't, preferring to go to war with
them.</P>
<P>Magneto's dastardly scheme to bring humans and mutants to level genetic
ground is the focus of the plot, and this thin story is indeed the film's
weakest element.  But the shortcoming is easy to forgive when the
atmosphere and smaller details feel so right.  The whole allegorical
issue of "mutant hysteria"--perpetuated by bigoted U.S. Senator Robert
Kelly (Bruce Davison)--is well-developed and played with the earnestness
it deserves, as is a WWII-era-set prologue that faithfully details
Magneto's beginnings.  In fact, the serious--though never
pretentious--tone of the film perfectly matches that of the comic, never
veering into the camp sensibilities that have marred other
comic-to-screen adaptations.  Singer and the writers must also be
commended for doing a bang-up job with the character relationships.  The
tense triangle between Scott, Jean, and Logan is perfectly played out;
and Wolvie's bond with Rogue is also nicely handled.</P>
<P>But, being a fanboy, I'm not above nitpicking over certain things. 
While the Wolverine/Rogue relationship works in the film's context, in
terms of the comics it bears more resemblance to his bond with two other
young mutants, Kitty Pryde and Jubilee (both of whom have cameos in the
film), than anything he ever had with Rogue.  Another throwaway mutant
appearance, that of Iceman (here referred to only by his real name,
Bobby), is sure to upset purists; he's a teen and Rogue's kinda-sorta
boyfriend at Xavier's school.  Rogue's young age also means the erasure
of the fascinating sexual tension between her and Magneto, which could
have come into play at a crucial juncture of the film.  And pity poor
Storm.  While Berry gives the character appropriate poise and elegance,
the writers give her very little to do.  Her forceful leadership
abilities are gone, as are her claustrophobia (which should have been a
factor in one scene) and sisterly relationship with Jean.  Plus, what is
the deal with that woefully unconvincing wig and her brown eyes (they
should be blue)?</P>
<P>But some things have to give when adapting a comic to film (much like
any book-to-screen translation), and for this fanboy, it's a relief that
overall _X-Men_ the film bears uncommon fidelity to its source material. 
And as a critic, it's a relief to see an effects-laden popcorn movie
offer a bit more meat than is traditionally required of such films.  That
said, _X-Men_ is best seen as just the jumping-off point for a possible
big screen franchise--one whose full potential can be realized in
subsequent installments.</P>
