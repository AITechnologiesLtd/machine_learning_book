<PRE>The Last Supper (1995) 92m.  </PRE>
<P>Drawing-room comedy for the 90s.  A group of postgrad students
(Cameron Diaz, Courney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, and others) meet every
Sunday for dinner to socialize and discuss politics, art, and
philosophy.  After sharing their table with an unexpected guest they
come to the conclusion that talk is cheap, and that the only way to
make the world the better place they dream of is to set themselves up
as judge, jury, and executioners, and rid it of all the people that
would impede their vision.  From that point on, the dinner parties
become trials.  Film will hold your attention - its characters are
literate and varied enough to encompass a range of opinions - but is
really a one-note symphony.  The first dinner party is essentially a
setup for the last: looking back you'll see there is no need for the
several similar scenes other than to chart the development of the
characters' convictions or doubts.  To give us a sense that the story
is going somewhere, screenwriter Dan Rosen trails a subplot through
the film involving a police officer and a missing girl, but the fact
remains that the two dinner conversations that bookend the film
outweigh the others inbetween.  The first of these, with Bill Paxton,
blends wit and tension effectively enough for us to look forward to a
rematch with the postgrad's nominal nemesis Norman Arbuthnot (Ron
Perlman, who plays his TV broadcaster like Rod Serling in narrator
mode).  Paxton and Perlman are great, and certainly more likely to
remain in your memory than the walk-ons by Charles Durning, Mark
Harmon, and Jason Alexander.</P>
<P>Message of film can be summed up with tried and true 'what goes around
comes around' and when the students start turning into the persecutors
that they hate, the only real surprise is why none of them were ever
bright enough to see it happening (although Diaz is the first to voice
her disapproval).  They're also too caught up in what they're doing to
see that the people they are setting up as targets are becoming
successively less extreme and increasingly marginal as candidates for
their agenda.  It was an interesting choice to make the group's only
black character the most fascistic of the group.  Best moment of film
is also its most subtle, when at the height of their fanaticism the
characters are suddenly reminded of the real, normal world existing
outside their house by something as simple as a hold signal on a
telephone.  Problem: if we are to assume that one of the students is
responsible for the paintings we see in the credits, how does that
explain the last picture?</P>
