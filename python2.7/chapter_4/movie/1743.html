<PRE>                                SCENT OF A WOMAN
                       A film review by Anton J. Panagos
                        Copyright 1993 Anton J. Panagos</PRE>
<P>     SCENT OF A WOMAN is one of the best movies of the year.  The main
reason for the above statement: Al Pacino.  This is Pacino's best film
role since DOG DAY AFTERNOON.  The role is a fully rich one for Pacino,
and he plays it to the hilt.  SCENT OF A WOMAN is the story of a college
kid, aloofingly played by Chris O'Donnell, who spends the Thanksgiving
weekend as a paid housesitter for a blind, and totally obnoxious,
Vietnam vet, Al Pacino.</P>
<P>     Without spoiling the movie's many wonderful surprises, the movie 
contains a nice mix of drama and comedy.  There is also beautifully
filmed tango danced by one of the principal characters and newcomer
actress Gabrielle Anwar.  (This is not a spoiler, just look at any movie
ad for SCENT OF A WOMAN in any newspaper!)</P>
<P>     What makes the story fascinating?  The explanation of Al Pacino's
character by others and Pacino himself.  His relationship with the young
and innocent O'Donnell, who becomes his protege in life.  Pacino
"teaches" O'Donnell about basic instincts of life and surprisingly
Pacino learns a few things as well.  The movie's ending was fittingly
great.  SCENT OF A WOMAN may  be nominated for an Oscar in April, but Al
Pacino definitely deserves an Oscar for this winning role of a lifetime.</P>
<P>I'd rate SCENT OF A WOMAN **** stars out of possible ****
The film is rated (R) for profanity.</P>
