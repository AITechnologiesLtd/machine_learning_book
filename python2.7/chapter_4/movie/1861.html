<PRE>                             STRICTLY BALLROOM
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Who would have expected a subtle and
     very funny satire of bad movie making in an Australian film
     about competition ballroom dancers?  This film may be more
     on-target than THE PLAYER.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Society has its rules.  Because of these rules everybody knows where
they stand and what is expected of them.  Who c Scott Hastings started to go
wrong.  He came from a good family.  His parents ran a ballroom dancing
studio.  Scott himself had the makings of one of Australia's great ballroom
dancers.  Then one day Scott broke society's rules.  In the middle of a
minor ballroom competition Scott just snapped.  Suddenly he was dancing his
own steps--steps not accepted by the Australian Ballroom Dance Federation.
Here in Technicolor and stereophonic sound is the story of Australia's
Spartacus of ballroom dancing.</P>
<P>     Here also is a delightful satire of really bad over-ripe dramatic
story-telling.  It is all here: the boy with the dream, the girl from the
wrong side of the tracks, the pushy mother, the conspiracy to fix the big
dance competition, the dark secret from the past, and, of course, the
climatic dance competition.  And not one un-telegraphed plot twist.  In
fact, everything is here to make the plot feel like an old friend.  The
target is contrived film plotting and STRICTLY BALLROOM hits the mark with
deadly accuracy.</P>
<P>     The film stars Paul Mercurio as Scott Hastings, who instinctively knows
that a man has got to dance the way a man has got to dance.  Actually, this
particular man DOES dance very well, not that that is really the point of
the film.  Scott's love is Fran (played by Tara Morice).  She has glasses
and a bad complexion, and is ugly and surprisingly clumsy, but inside she
knows she has what it takes to be beautiful and a great formal dancer.  Bill
Hunter plays Barry Fife, who wrote the videocassette on ballroom dancing.
But does he hide a sinister secret?</P>
<P>     This is a film that has echoes of what is wrong in even the most
popular films from 42ND STREET to ROCKY and HOOSIERS.  I give this one a low
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale.  It's a hoot!</P>
