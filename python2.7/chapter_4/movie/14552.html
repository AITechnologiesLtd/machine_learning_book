A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jamie Banks</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Silvio Horta</PRE>
<P>Starring: Alicia Witt, Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart, Robert Englund</P>
<P>Ingredients: College kids, mysterious murders, urban legends</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
The plot of URBAN LEGEND revolves around Natalie (Alicia Witt), a
Pendleton College girl who discovers that everyone associated with her
is being killed off. The catch is that they're dying in accordance with
the plots of popular urban folk tales such as the story of the ax
murderer hiding in the back seat. Just like in SCREAM, Natalie's young
peers are familiar with these folk tales, so they know how death might
possibly occur.</P>
<P>Police never show up, and attractive college kids wander around and run
off to be alone in dark places where a villain who wears a hooded winter
parka in warm weather stalks them. People always run the wrong way
straight into danger. Evidence and bodies disappear, and in the end, as
tradition dictates, the villain is revealed to be someone who can't
possibly do all that lifting, clean up all that evidence, and survive so
many bullet wounds. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
Urban legends are fictional modern folk tales passed off as true. A
couple examples are: the cat in the microwave; alligators hiding in the
sewers; a famous actor (you know his name) going to the hospital with a
gerbil in his intestine; feeding alka seltzer tablets to seagulls to
make them explode; seeing a girl walking down the street and finding out
later she died years ago; the kid who gets his pecker chopped off in the
bathroom; the choking Doberman;  et cetera, et cetera.</P>
<P>URBAN LEGEND features some of these, but I haven't heard of some of the
others. It's a somewhat campy movie that's not really suspenseful. But
at least we get to see who lives, who dies, and who the villain in the
winter parka turns out to be.</P>
