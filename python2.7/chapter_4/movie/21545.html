<P>Starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Dina Meyer, Bob Gunton. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Bats is this year's camp flick. With the world's worst dialogue,
cheesiest premise and stupidest editor, this one should be heaven for
those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity. As for the rest of us,
well... I'd say skip it, but looking at the box office figures for this
one, it seems as though most of America is following that advice
anyway. Follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your
life and 8 bucks to boot.</P>
<P>I love Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, almost as much as I love the short
story on which it is based. It saddens me even more, then, to see that
American Treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock
such as Bats. When mysterious bat attacks occur in a small Texas town,
the authorities call in a batologist (Dina Meyer) to investigate. It
turns out that a creepy scientist (Bob Gunton) has genetically enhanced
a couple bats that escaped from his lab, making them smarter and more
vicious. Why has he done this, you ask? Because, you see, it is
apparently a scientist's job to make things "a little better," even if
that means the death of all mankind.</P>
<P>So the batologist, her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff (Lou
Diamond Phillips) have to kill all the bats and save the world. Of
course, that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo (bat shit,
for the uninitiated), get up close and personal with some truly
repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations
ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture. Consider, for
example, a scene where two people are in a bat cave. The bats are all
sleeping, but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can
get out. What do they do? Do they get the hell out of there as fast as
they can? Nope. They stand there for a while, transfixed by the
thousands of bats opening their eyes.</P>
<P>What keeps Bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing
in most of the attack scenes. We don't even get to see what's going on;
the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick. All we know is
that bats are attacking. How they are attacking and what exactly is
happening remains a mystery. A little technical proficiency does
wonders for horror movies, and Bats sure could use some.</P>
<P>Of course, director Louis Morneau tries to liven things up with some
intentional humor, but it is so conventional it doesn't really go
anywhere. Most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's
wisecracking sidekick (Leon), who takes every opportunity to sputter
ingenious lines like "I hate bats!" Some of these are so bad that they
take on a double quality: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because they are so inept. I hate characters who
exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners. Playing such
characters does not help actors' careers.</P>
<P>Still, I suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is "so bad
it's good," you could do worse than Bats. It does have a tremendous
amount of camp value. I'm not "recommending" the movie because, quite
frankly, it sucks, and I know that this might convince some people to
go out and see it. More power to them.</P>
