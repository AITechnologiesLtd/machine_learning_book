<PRE>                                  Three Comedies
                       Film reviews by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1992 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>[Yes, I know Roger says one is not a comedy.  But it is marketed and
perecived by most as one, so ....  -Moderator]</P>
<PRE>                            MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN</PRE>
<P>Starring Chevy Chase, Daryl Hannah, and Sam Neill
Directed by John Carpenter</P>
<P>     The trailer of this film does its best *not* to make it look like a
comedy, but unfortunately, it succeeds.  If someone were to go into this
film expecting a comedy, they would probably be sadly disappointed.  I
mean after all, Chevy Chase is in it, right?</P>
<P>     I am sad to say, however, that MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN is *not*
a comedy.  It can be considered a curiosity, and is definitely much
better than some of John Carpenter's earlier ventures (THEY LIVE, PRINCE
OF DARKNESS, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA).  The special effects (done by
ILM) are of course first-rate, but I think casting Chevy Chase as an
invisible man and not making the film a comedy was a big mistake.</P>
<P>     The film is good if it is not considered as a comedy; this is the
kind of movie you just go to vegg out for.  Just watch as the invisible
man eavesdrops on conversations, chews gum, brushes his teeth, and even
digests food before your very eyes.  Don't pay attention to the story
too much--I don't think you will have as much fun.  This seems to be a
movie that is banking on the "Wow"-factor (like TERMINATOR 2), but I
don't think it has the budget nor the story to count on that too much.
Nevertheless, it is an interesting movie; worth at least a viewing at
the local dollar movie theater.</P>
<PRE>                                 MY COUSIN VINNY</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio</PRE>
<P>     MY COUSIN VINNY starts out slow--it's not the most gripping of
beginnings.  And when Joe Pesci's character comes into the picture, the
storyline shifts from Ralph Macchio's character and his buddy directly
to Joe Pesci.  Okay, we can forgive them a little digression.  But once
this movie gets going, it's not bad.</P>
<P>     I found this movie to be surprisingly funny.  Not hilarious, just
funny.  Joe Pesci hasn't been running a good streak of luck lately (THE
SUPER), which is why I was a little adamant about this venture.  But I
believe he succeeds in this movie, and the supporting cast is really
good.</P>
<P>     I have to admit that this movie took me by surprise.  I thought it
would be another run of the mill comedy that Hollywood churns out
because it believes it has the right formula.  But MY COUSIN VINNY is
worth at least a matinee price at the box office, if anything at all.</P>
<PRE>                                  WAYNE'S WORLD</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Dana Carvey and Mike Myers
Directed by Penelope Schipps</PRE>
<P>     WAYNE'S WORLD is a wonderfully stupid, offbeat, ridiculous kind of
farce that you want to watch at least a hundred times.  Given forty days
and twelve million dollars to work with, Penelope Schipps and the crew
of WAYNE'S WORLD have churned out a consistently stupid movie, one that
requires no brains and no intellect.</P>
<P>     The cameos in the film a in plenteous supply; some good, some just
plain silly.  This movie is truly WAYNE'S WORLD, not anyone else's.
When to go to see this movie, you are in his world, not your own.  And
WAYNE'S WORLD may delight you, or just outright repulse you.</P>
<P>     I have reviewed movies like this in the past; the kind that are
subject to interpretation.  Well, if you spend too much time trying to
interpret this movie, you'll be expending way too much energy and
missing the entire point.  This is a vegg-out movie, something so stupid
that you don't even have to know how to breathe in order to watch it.</P>
<P>     So if you're in that "in-limbo" kind of mood, go check out WAYNE'S
WORLD.  IMHO, it;s worth full price at the box office.  Who knows?  You
may wind up liking it!</P>
