<P>        Jennifer Love Hewitt may be a limited actress, but she does have two
sizable assets: a robust scream, and a gift for filling out a clingy white
tank-top. Both her talents are put to use in "I Still Know what You Did Last
Summer," a pointless sequel to last year's hit about four teens stalked by a
fisherman they mistakenly believed they killed during a post-graduation
celebration. The original at least offered a couple of suspenseful moments
and a genuinely creepy cameo by Anne Heche; "Still" throws all logic out the
window, raises the gore quotient and offers more offensive racial
stereotypes than any WB or UPN sitcom.</P>
<P> The key addition this time around is R&B singer Brandy (star of the
not-bad UPN comedy "Moesha") as Karla, new best friend to troubled Julie
James (Hewitt), one of the two survivors of last year's murderous mayhem.
While there are a few giggles to be had listening to the squeaky-clean
Brandy's attempts to swear, what's not so funny is the movie's depiction of
young African-Americans as having nothing more on their minds than sex and
violence. One can only hope Mekhi Phifer, as Karla's walking hormone of a
boyfriend, was well-paid for portraying a character as one-dimensional and
grating as the shuffling, wide-eyed servants black actors used to be
relegated to playing back in the pre-Civil Rights era.</P>
<P> Of course, no one goes to a movie like this expecting sharp
performances or strong writing, but "Still" is so stupid even the dopiest
viewers may give up on it before the film's ridiculous finale. Julie, Karla,
Tyrell (Phifer) and Julie's potential new boyfriend Will (Matthew Settle)
wing down to a remote island in the Bahamas, hoping for a bit of summer fun.
But when Julie's old nemesis the fisherman turns up, partytime is over and
the movie becomes one scene after another of scream-run-stalk-slash.</P>
<P> All the tired old tricks are trotted out by director Danny Cannon,
including "shocker" dream sequences and the deathless "oh my God, it's just
you" scenes, in which someone realizes what they thought was a killer is
actually just a friend creeping silently around in the dark for no
particular reason. Those looking for a real cinematic scare should check out
"The Siege" and take a look at Bruce Willis' toupee -- it's far more
frightening than anything Hewitt and company have to offer.
