<PRE>Review of  PALMETTO and WILD THINGS</PRE>
<PRE>By Jerry Saravia </PRE>
<P>Film noir has lately seeped in many corners of the film industry. We've seen
examples of deadpan noir (an Ebert term applicable to "Destiny Turns on the
Radio"), farce noir ("Clay Pigeons," "Fargo"), revisionist noir ("Pulp
Fiction," and a slew of rip-offs), old-fashioned, hard-boiled detective noir
("L.A. Confidential"), time-bending, surreal, neo-noir ("Lost Highway," an ode
to "Detour") and, finally, daylight, Florida noir. As far as current noir, I am
most impressed by "Lost Highway" because it is so unconventional and a sign of
the new cinema to come where there are no boundaries with structure or logic. I
am less excited with Florida noir, a hark back to Elmore Leonard's shenanigans
in the ordinary "Stick." Not that Florida is a flat setting (it was ideal for
1991's "Cape Fear"), but it doesn't build for the kind of atmosphere that noir
needs - that air of desperation. That desperation is well-handled in
"Palmetto," but it fails miserably in "Wild Things" - two of the newest
additions to noir. </P>
<P>"Palmetto" stars Woody Harrelson as a rambunctious former reporter just out of
prison for a crime he didn't commit - he was apparently framed in a police
cover-up. Now he starts life over with his sexy girlfriend (Gina Gershon), an
artist, and is offered a job with the police department! He resists the offer,
and finds himself neck deep in trouble with a flirtatious blonde siren
(Elisabeth Shue). After stealing money from her purse, she asks him to
participate in a scheme involving the kidnapping of her sister. Before you can
say murder, corruption, conspiracy, double indemnity, Woody gets in a jam he
can't get out of. The desperation begins. In an ironic twist, he's hired by the
police department to cover his own story, which involves him as a possible
murder suspect. </P>
<P>"Palmetto" is breezy fun for a while, but it takes much too long for it to go
anywhere. An inordinate amount of time is spent on Woody's couplings with Ms.
Shue before the plot kicks in gear. The problem here is that Harrelson and Shue
have no believable sultry sparks between them - Shue's best leading man has
been Nicolas Cage by far, and he played a drunk! The film has the perfect
sweltering atmosphere to convey hidden passions and desires, but its tone is
too uneven. It goes from completely deadpan, to wildly over-the-top, rainy
climaxes, to deadly serious innuendoes of the "Gingerbread Man" variety -
witness the gory shenanigans of the Michael Rappaport character that belongs in
a different movie. </P>
<P>At least "Palmetto" floats with Woody's charisma and comic timing (not to
mention the more lustrous Chloe Sevigny), but "Wild Things" has no one
dependable to keep things interesting. The story has Matt Dillon (wildly
miscast) as Lombardo, a respected high-school teacher who is convicted of
raping two local teenage beauties of the "Scream" variety, the rich blonde
Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), and the girl from the alligator nests' living
in a trailer, Suzie (Neve Campbell). And that's about as far as I can go in
describing the plot except to say that Kevin Bacon shows up as a clean-cut cop,
and Bill Murray hilariously plays a shyster. </P>
<P>Although "Wild Things" is sleazy, exploitative to an extent, and often cheesy,
the film's twists and turns are much too apparent. Perhaps, I've seen too many
film noir thrillers but I could anticipate its every move, excluding Kevin
Bacon's stunning reversal of roles that I'll keep mum about. The other flaw is
that the complex weaving of twists reveals little about the characters or their
humanity. In the best tradition of film noir with classics that range from
"Double Indemnity" to "Chinatown," there was always an identification with the
protagonists and an understanding of their motives for their actions, no matter
how depraved. Here, there is no one to identify with on any level, possibly
because no effort was made to make the characters' personalities real or
consistent - they appear to be cartoon characters out of a Vogue fashion
spread. The only character worth caring about is Neve Campbell's Suzie, but
then we learn she's not quite what she seems either.</P>
<P>"Palmetto" is the better film to see, but I miss the old days of film noir
when the dialogue sparkled and cut the air like stabbing someone's back. The
atmosphere was always there, but it served as an existential backdrop for the
sins of mortal men and women. Desperation hung like an endlessly dripping wet
blanket - it was omnipresent. "L.A. Confidential" and "Lost Highway" are the
best recent examples of that type of noir. The rest is disorganized, silly and
counterproductive. </P>
