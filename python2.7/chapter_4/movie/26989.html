<P>In "The Opposite of Sex" (1998) his first film as both director and 
scenarist, writer Don Roos had composed an offbeat, blackish comedy. 
Now, in his second feature, he gets closer to the melodrama-for-TV 
genre, which is acceptable but even without commercials tends to 
become a yawner.</P>
<P>Los Angeles hotshot advertising executive Buddy (Affleck), having 
closed a great contract in Chicago, is flying home. As bad weather 
makes for delays and cancellations at O'Hare, Buddy kills time at an 
airport bar, garrulously chatting with two strangers: Greg (Goldwyn) 
who is anxious to get back to his wife and kids in L.A., and sexy 
businesswoman Mimi (Henstridge) who is going to Dallas.</P>
<P>Even in the age of AIDS, brief encounters are tempting. When, with 
the briefest economy of means, Mimi signals Buddy that a night of 
sex would be welcome, he generously gives his ticket to grateful 
Ben. But the Infiniti Airlines plane crashes.</P>
<P>The film, moving from fast sex to the old twist of mistaken 
identity, switches to the confusion of who's who and to the agony of 
Ben's wife Abby (Paltrow). Those sequences are effective. So are 
those of Buddy who is suffering from massive survivor's guilt.</P>
<P>Matters become colorfully dramatic. The airline, which happens to be 
a client of Buddy's firm, has it produce outrageously and phonily 
sentimental TV commercials which mourn  the crash victims - for PR 
reasons of course. The commercials are revolting, both to us and to 
Buddy whose personal involvement make him  aware of their crass 
nature for the first time in his career no doubt. With its 
additional mix of business and ad-people's lingo, the script scores 
good points as an expose. </P>
<P>Alas, artificiality sets in. Buddy now drinks heavily. He attends a 
major do of publicity firms. He gets top honors for "his" airline 
commercial. His drunken acceptance speech points the finger at his 
trade. It's too much, too phonily Hollywood.</P>
<P>Buddy undergoes a cure for drinking. Cut to some time later. 
Permanently sober, Alcoholics Anonymous member Buddy is back in 
business.</P>
<P>He feels compelled to do something for Abby, the widow he has never 
met. Guess what? Right. She turns out to be attractive, appealing in 
the awkward, rookie ways she tries to sell real estate. She says she 
is a divorcee. Why?  That's what gave me the most food for thought. 
Is it a sign of the times that a divorced person is more appealing 
to the opposite gender than a widowed one?  Is there a curse on 
people whose spouses have died? And to think that the 1934 
Astaire-Rogers musical "The Gay Divorcee" came from the play "The 
Gay Divorce" but the Hollywood Code  demanded the change!</P>
<P>Abby has no idea of what connects Buddy with her husband's death. He 
keeps mum on that subject. But guess what again? The two are 
mutually attracted. Buddy gets her a big deal with his firm. He 
likes her is good with them --the old cliché. Their relationship 
escalates to love. They kiss at 50 minutes into the movie.</P>
<P>I hate to say it, but up to now, save for some sequences, the film 
has been dull. The twosome's episodes have been played in the lowest 
key of anything I remember on the screens of the AD. 2000. This 
would have been a virtue, had  the script managed to combine it with 
discreet psychological excitement. But even when at 70 minutes the 
big crisis comes, the movie stays dull.</P>
<P>The performances are, grosso modo, competent, even good. But the 
basic situations and developments remain artificial and 
unconvincing. Not the least aspect of this is a courtroom twist in 
which the stewardess who had originally accepted Ben's gift boarding 
pass and ticket is being chastised.</P>
<P>Next time a nice flight attendant breaks a rule in your favor, think 
twice before asking her or him.</P>
