<PRE>                                  CLERKS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Made on the very meager budget of under $30,000, by a dropout from
film school, CLERKS is one of the funniest, good-natured and vocally
raunchy movie in a long, long while.  Originally slapped with the
dreaded NC-17, on appeal it was given an R rating.</P>
<P>     Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is a clerk at the Quick Stop
Groceries, in New Jersey, a convenience store where the nuttiest
customers in the world seem to frequent.  There is, to cite but one
example of many, the elderly man who asks to use the employee restroom
but who then requests to borrow one of the porn mags on the shelf to
take with him into the toilet.</P>
<P>     "Working" in a miserable video store next door, where he treats
the customers with utter disdain, is his friend, Randal (Jeff
Anderson).  Throughout the film, where every other word consists of
four letters spoken in a most offhand relaxed manner, are the customers
with whom the two have to contend, each of who is odd in his own way.
Randal is of the belief that every customer should be insulted.</P>
<P>     Writer-director Kevin Smith who himself worked on and off in a
convenience store does a masterful job in this his first film.  But
this is much more than a mere recounting of his experiences as a
register jockey.  This is one funny film.</P>
<P>     Also starring are Marilyn Ghigliotti (as Dante's devoted
girlfriend, Veronica) and Lisa Spoonauer (as Caitlin, the high school
ex-sweetheart who has just announced she is getting married).</P>
