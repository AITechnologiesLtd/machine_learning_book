<PRE>SHORT REVIEW</PRE>
<P>The Lost World is the sequel to Jurassic Park, and let me start by
saying that it is not as good a film as the original.  A return is
made to a different island populated by dinosaurs brought back to 
life through modern science, and a big melee ensues as 20th century
man starts to interact with the Dinos.  The thing is that in the 
original movie, although it didn't have terrific acting, the action
sequences with the dinosaurs were tense and smart, the special effects
were incredible and novel, and there was a fairly coherent story
line.  In The Lost World the special effects are the only solidly 
positive thing I can point out about the movie, but they really
aren't worth the price of a ticket, even with THX.  This film
might still be very entertaining/scary for kids, but I doubt you
would enjoy it if you are an adult.</P>
<PRE>SLIGHTLY LONGER REVIEW (Contains specific descriptions of 
                        scenes in the film, might be spoiler,
                        if you have not seen the film or trailers)</PRE>
<P>I left Jurassic Park knowing there would be a sequel, and
already hoping that it would be like Aliens was to Alien, 
a surprising improvement.  Unfortunately, The Lost World 
is not an improvement on, or even comparable to Jurassic Park.  
I was particularly surprised by this because I read the novel
The Lost World awhile ago, and was pleasantly surprised by it
(You might read it; it bears little resemblance to the movie),
and felt it would make a very passable sequel.  The reason that
The Lost World is not very entertaining, in my opinion, is that
(a) the story is convoluted and gratuitous (did a T-Rex really 
need to make it to shore in the US), and (b) the action
sequences were not up to what I usually look for from Spielberg.</P>
<P>The following discussion doesn't give away any of the movie's plot,
but is probably more interesting to someone who has seen the film, 
and recalls the specific action sequences. Many people say that you
need to suspend your belief when you walk into a movie like The 
Lost World, and I do up to a point.
I accept that I'm going to see movie where dinosaurs come back
to life, but not where people get to defy the Laws of Physics 
for the sake of big pyrotechnics.  
Let me give an  example of the types of action sequences I find 
good and bad.  In Jurassic Park there was a scene where
a Velociraptor chased a kid into a kitchen, and the child gets the
Velociraptor to run into a reflection of itself in a stainless 
steel door, knocking the raptor out.  I could believe this sequence, 
and it was extremely tense.  In The Lost World, in a similar 
scenario a velociraptor breaks into an equipment shed, and then
waits patiently while Jeff Golblum's daughter performs a parallel
bar routine before kicking the raptor through the wall.  It was the
longest setup for a joke that I have seen in a while.  
The trailer over the cliff scene in The Lost World was similarly
implausible, if someone had gotten a piece of their clothing 
caught on the trailer as it slid over the cliff after they 
climbed up, and then got pulled halfway to oblivion, I would have 
liked the scene a lot better than seeing three people hanging on one
rope slide through the center of the trailer.  Anyways, I have
ranted enough, suffice it to say that I expected the kind of
action I've seen in Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park, but got the
kind of scenes that seem to be proliferating in movies like
Mission Impossible, The Rock, etc.</P>
