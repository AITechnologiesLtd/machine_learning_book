<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Here we have it: "Bring It On", the first feature film targeted at ten
year-olds with the sensibilities of an adult. Or maybe at adults with the
mindset of a ten year-old; frankly, it's hard to tell. Either way, "Bring
It On" is an uncomfortable melding of an After-School Special plot with
distinctly mature humor. It's not quite paedophilia, fortunately, but at
times it comes disturbingly close. Whereas movies like "American Pie" are
up-front about their attitude toward sex and profanity, "Bring It On"
couches its mature content in a maudlin, juvenile storyline. Who is this
film aimed at? The swearing and sensuality is clearly not for the young.
The story will bore anyone out of knee socks and pigtails. "Bring It On"
tries to appeal to all demographics, and in doing so becomes a peculiar
hybrid suitable for none.</P>
<P>Torrance "Tor" Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the
cheerleading squad at Rancho Carne, a high school in a well-to-do San
Diego neighbourhood. Although the school football team is a perpetual
disaster, the cheerleaders are champions, having placed first in the
Nationals for five years running. The squad looks set for another easy
victory until new recruit Missy (played by Eliza Dushku, the psychotic
Slayer Faith on TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") realises that all their 
routines have been cribbed from the cheerleaders of East Compton High in
urban San Diego. Tor is faced with having to develop an entirely new set
of cheers in just three weeks, before the big showdown with East Compton
and its captain, Isis (Gabrielle Union), at the National Championships.</P>
<P>"Bring It On" reads like a litany of teen-melodrama cliches. There are, of
course, the snobby white girls and the hip but poor black girls. There's
Tor's unfaithful college boyfriend and the new boy who's perfect for her
-- if it weren't for the misunderstandings which keep them apart. There's
the leadership challenge Tor must endure, and the inevitable climactic
meet which will decide everything. Oh, and let's not forget the
syrupy-sweet conclusion in which all wrongs are righted, and everybody
goes home happy.</P>
<P>But most damning of all is the fact that, for long stretches of time,
"Bring It On" just isn't funny. Partly this is because the filmmakers seem
uncertain about whether they're making a satire or a serious movie, and so
the jokes just cease while they go about advancing the plot. And partly 
this is because the raunchy humor is such a poor fit with the general
attitude of the picture. Several jokes aroused only uncomfortable chuckles
from the audience during the screening I attended, accompanied by much
squirming and shifting in the seats. Scenes in which the cheerleaders
parade about in their underwear, or one in which a male cheerleader
"inadvertently" lets his fingers slip while holding up a pantie-less
female cheerleader, sit uncomfortably next to the simple moralising of
Jessica Bendinger's screenplay.</P>
<P>Indeed, "Bring It On" feels like a movie which underwent a major rethink
halfway through production. I'm not sure if it started out as a sharp
pastiche on cheerleading which was subverted into something more
homogeneous, or if it was originally just a standard kids' movie
later spiced up to bring in the adults. Without a doubt, I would have
preferred either to the end result.</P>
<P>To be fair, there are some good moments. For example, a sequence in which
a desperate Tor hires a professional choreographer to discipline her
troupe is a lot of fun, as the dancer (Ian Roberts) proceeds to tear apart
each and every member of the Rancho Carne squad. Dunst manages to preserve
her natural charm despite the poor quality of her material. She makes a
real effort here, but she's fighting an uphill battle and just can't make
the movie succeed on her own. Dushku is also very good, although the
script never really finds anything for Missy to do after her introduction
as a rebellious gymnast. She spends the rest of the film acting like
Dunst's shadow, the third wheel in the romantic subplot involving Tor and
Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).</P>
<P>Less laudable is the movie's treatment of the East Compton squad. Their
appearances are so brief that none of them benefit from any character
development whatsoever, not even Gabrielle Union's Isis. This is
unfortunate because when she is on screen, Union demonstrates a real
presence, and I was hoping to see more of her. Further, the flimsy
portrayal of the East Compton troupe ensures that their rivalry with the
Rancho Carne cheerleaders is all but devoid of tension or excitement. It
is difficult for the audience to get excited about a competition when one
side is virtually unknown.</P>
<P>Also unimpressive is Peyton Reed's pedantic direction. Whereas movies of
this sort often excel at showcasing their subject material, if nothing
else ("Center Stage"'s exposure of ballet is a good recent example),
"Bring It On" does cheerleading no real favours. Despite the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast, their routines are filmed in a dull and
commonplace manner. As much time is spent on sending up the sport as it
is on portraying the real trials and tribulations it incurs. There is
little in "Bring It On" to suggest that cheerleaders are, as Roberts'
choreographer puts it, anything other than "dancers who have gone
retarded".</P>
<P>An ill-conceived motion picture from start to finish, "Bring It On" is one
of those rare films which isn't just dull or insipid, but is occasionally
embarrassing to watch. Only some lively performances save this from the
scrap heap of the truly dreadful. "Bring It On"? Do us all a favour --
please, don't.</P>
