<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Let's say one thing first. Anyone who was expecting to find a really good
movie inside of something that combines Wolfgang Peterson, the director of
"In the Line of Fire" with Harrison Ford of the Star Wars Trilogy and Gary
Oldman, who played the slack-jawed sociopath in the worst movie of the
summer, "The Fifth Element", couldn't be good. Granted, "In the Line of
Fire" was one of the best assassin stories told since "Seven Days in May"
and the Star Wars Trilogy is at least a fun bunch, but the
two-out-of-three-ain't-bad rule just doesn't apply to movies.</P>
<P>In fact, in this movie, what you'd expect is almost reversed.</P>
<P>Gary Oldman is the only one who shows anything worth watching on the screen
while Peterson's copycat style and Ford's Rambo with wrinkles simply don't
work.</P>
<P>Air Force One is supposed to be a story about the hijacking of the
president's plane, but is really simply the hijacking of about five other
plane movies in disguise.</P>
<P>Having somebody go into the machinery and cause mischief? Sound like
"Executive Decision"? Having people being pulled from one plane to another
by a wire? The robbery sequence in "Cliffhanger". Having a kills quick and
never dies superman on the plane? An obvious shoot off of Passenger 57. And
having a demented sociopath in control of a flight? "Turbulence" or "Con
Air", take your pick.</P>
<P>For me this was one of those movies in which I was wondering why I saw it in
the first place as I came out of the theater. That and it was one of the
movies in which you know exactly what is going to happen makes those two
hours ones in which I wish life had a return policy on it.</P>
