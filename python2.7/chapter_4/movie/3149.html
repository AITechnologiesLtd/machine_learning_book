<PRE>                              THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Edward W. Felton
                        Copyright 1994 Edward W. Felton</PRE>
<P>     My father, bless him, has taught me two valuable lessons in life;
learn to tie your own bow ties, and steer well clear of made-for-TV
movies.  Honest advice, I thought; most TV movies seemed to feature
Jaclyn Smith or some other fading star, and almost always seemed to
have  Mommy  in the title.  However, a few years ago, a strange thing
happened; both HBO in the United States and Channel 4 in England
started coming out with carefully crafted, creatively budgeted movies
of extremely high quality.  Prominent among these was HBO's RED ROCK
WEST, an odd little film noir  that caused quite a stir when first
released.  I saw in the cinema about two years ago, as it got a
theatrical release in Europe.  A quirky tale with an excellent cast,
with Nicholas Cage as the nice guy, Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy
(a real stretch, presumably) and Lara Flynn Boyle as the pasty-faced
love interest.  With lots of guns, dusty country roads and fun cameos,
RED ROCK WEST was a lot of fun.  THE LAST SEDUCTION is a similar HBO
effort, but simply doesn't match it for quality.</P>
<P>     So basically what happens is that killer babe from hell, Linda
Fiorentino, robs her unpleasant husband of a bag of cash and goes
underground in a small town.  She stays nicely incognito, ludicrously
strutting into the redneck bar in with high heels and power
shoulder pads.  Still, we learn a great deal about her character.  She
can write backwards.  Insightful stuff.  Tumbling into the sack with
the local Brad Pitt, without the acting talent, we get what we really
came for ... cue moodily lit limbs and arched backs-a-plenty.  Irked
hubby sends heavies after her, only to be foiled by the witty, sassy
and invincible Wendy Kroy.  An hour of transparent plot devices and
tacked-on characterizations later, and nothing much has changed.</P>
<P>     Critics have raved over Fiorentino, describing her as both sex and
talent incarnate.  I wouldn't go that far; although certainly not
unattractive, and more than willing to get her kit off in the name of
cinema verite, she's just not that special.  Hers is a big, and
therefore admirable role for a woman, though curiously
one-dimensional.  She's tough, she's cool, she's sexy.  But then so is
Paul Newman, only he doesn't have to break out the skimpy underwear to
achieve it.  As far as I know.  Anyway, the lack of an adequate male
lead to balance the movie although this isn't so important in reverse
lessens the range of the film considerably.  Small, boring country
towns are by definition, small and boring, one wildcat in high heels
doesn't exactly set the screen on fire.  The scenes between her and the
himbo lover are laughable;  What are you running from, Wendy?   There's
some original innovative dialogue for you.  The New York scenes, merely
familiar, include that damn location under the Brooklyn Bridge, used
for the bazillionth time.  Add to that a moronic plot twist (remember
De Niro as Louis Cypher in ANGEL HEART?  Yup....) and a plethora of dull
characters, and we re checking wristwatches an hour into the film.  An
irritatingly repetitive jazz score, vaguely reminiscent of The Firm, is
constant and grinding.  Great legs emerging from car door, the sort of
thing normally smothered in a sax solo, receive the same bouncy eight
bars as the chase through a building, and hero in contemplative mood.
Fiorentino, however, has definite potential for the future, but she's
not enough to carry this movie on her own.  The conclusion, after a
tortuously convoluted final reel, the inevitable triumph of the female
will, is nicely tied up, and the movie becomes At Last Seductive: too
little, too late.  A disappointing two out of ten.</P>
