<P>     Let me start by saying that HERCULES, Walt Disney Pictures' 35th 
animated feature, makes for good family entertainment.  Good, not great.  
While this film is capable of providing a ninety minute diversion for 
both kids and adults, it's a far cry from such recent classics as THE 
LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN.  A mere five years 
ago, Disney was developing top-notch animated movies on a regular basis.  
Now, in 1997, the studio's efforts have become dull and routine.  
Complacency has set in.  No one is pushing Disney and revenue is up -- 
where's the incentive to stop the assembly-line animated feature 
production and get back to creative movie making?  HERCULES has the 
dubious distinction of being the least-enchanting cartoon Disney has 
fashioned in over a decade.</P>
<P>     Students of mythology may be irritated by the changes made to the 
legend of Hercules.  Many of these are understandable, given the 
studio's espousal of family values.  After all, how much light-hearted 
fun can you have telling the tale of the bastard son of a god and mortal 
who grew up to kill his wife and children?  So, instead, Disney has made 
Hercules the divine offspring of a couple that represents Olympian 
marital bliss:  Zeus and Hera.  Unfortunately, Hades, who is preparing a 
"hostile takeover bid" of the big mountain, has it on good authority 
that Hercules is the only one who can foul up his plans.  So, using his 
inept assistants Panic and Pain, he has Hercules turned into a human.  
When Dad and Mom learn about this, they realize that their son, who is 
no longer immortal, cannot live on Olympus, and they allow him to be 
raised by Greek foster parents.</P>
<P>     The majority of the film centers on the adult Hercules performing 
all sorts of grueling tasks to clean up the ancient city of Thebes ("the 
Big Olive" -- if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere) and 
establish his status as a hero.  His mentor is a satyr named Phil, who 
fills the role of the irascible-but-lovable sidekick.  Meanwhile, Hades 
is out to get Zeus' son, throwing all sorts of obstacles in his path -- 
hydras, giant boulders, and a Mae West-type damsel in distress named 
Megara.</P>
<P>     HERCULES comes close to being a remake of the THE LITTLE MERMAID 
with a male hero.  One could easily argue that all Disney animated films 
are similar (for example, the hero is always a loner who proves 
herself/himself through some deed of self-sacrifice), but HERCULES is a 
little too blatant in its cannibalization of past themes and plot 
points.  Besides that, this film has a distractingly episodic feel.  
Instead of coming together as a cohesive story, it's like a bunch of 
thinly-related events strung one-by-one to reach a ninety-minute running 
time.</P>
<P>     The most disappointing aspect of HERCULES is the amateurish quality 
of the artwork.  The "excuse" for this is that the animators at Disney 
were trying a new, angular style (one that is attributed to production 
designer Gerald Scarfe).  In fact, this approach makes the film look 
rushed and, at times, incomplete.  It is never a visual marvel -- even 
the computer-generated scenes fail to impress.  The sequences intended 
to offer the biggest spectacle -- Olympus and the Underworld -- provoke 
little more than a yawn.  </P>
<P>     With HERCULES, composer Alan Menken is scoring his sixth animated 
Disney feature.  His work on three (MERMAID, BEAUTY, and ALADDIN) has 
been noteworthy.  It has been adequate on another (POCAHONTAS).  
However, the songs for last year's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME were generic 
and lifeless, and there's little sign of improvement here.  The fact 
that Menken tries a different style for this music (the Greek Chorus is 
a gospel soul group) doesn't change its inherent banality.  Simply put, 
this is a boring soundtrack. </P>
<P>     On the other hand, HERCULES' vocal characterizations are uniformly 
good.  Joshua Keaton and Tate Donovan team up effectively as the title 
character.  Susan Egan (who played BEAUTY AND THE BEAST's Belle on 
stage) is suitably sassy as Meg.  Danny DeVito is a riot as Phil, as are 
Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer as Pain and Panic.  Rip Torn makes for 
a nicely authoritative Zeus.  Cameos include the likes of Amanda Plummer 
(one of the Fates), Paul Shaffer (Hermes), Hal Holbrook (Hercules' 
foster father), and Charlton Heston (the narrator).  But the real star 
of the show is James Woods, whose Hades is the most vibrant Disney 
creation since Robin Williams' Genie.  Hades is a lively villain with a 
great repertoire of one-liners.  And, although Woods isn't as much of a 
vocal chameleon as Williams, he's close enough that it hardly matters.</P>
<P>     HERCULES is saturated with cultural references -- points should be 
awarded for anyone who spots them all.  There are nods to MacDonald's 
(over 5,000,001 served), "chariot chasers", I LOVE LUCY ("Zeusy, I'm 
home!"), Siskel and Ebert ("two thumbs way, way up for our leading 
lady"), and other pop phenomena.  Most amusing of all, however, is the 
way HERCULES willingly lampoons its own reputation, taking several jabs 
at the inevitable merchandising whirlwind that surrounds its release.  </P>
<P>     So, although HERCULES is undoubtedly one of the summer's most 
lightly enjoyable motion pictures, I couldn't shake the feeling that it 
could have been and done more.  Those on the lookout for another Disney 
masterpiece won't uncover it here.  However, anyone with the modest goal 
of finding a screen solution to the problem of a family outing need not 
worry:  Disney's 35th animated motion picture fills the prescription.</P>
