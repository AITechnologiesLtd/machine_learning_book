                       A film review by Eric Brochu

<PRE>DRUNKEN MASTER II (1994)</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jackie Chan, Anita Mui, Ti Lung, Felix Wong
Directed by: Lau Ka-Leung</P>
<P>        General Introduction:  Well, Jackie Chan has just 
made his big North American debut (again), this time with 
the high-energy Asian hit Rumble in the Bronx.  Not one 
to miss an opportunity to sing the praises of one of my 
favorite film stars, I am writing this series of reviews, 
each about one of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong movies, all 
highly recommended to both fans of Jackie Chan and those 
who are simply curious about the man currently being 
billed as "the world's most popular action star."  The 
only real problem might be finding them.  While they is 
not available at the local Blockbuster, pretty much any 
city of any size is likely to have at least one video 
store catering to an Asian audience.  Find it and rent 
them.  I promise you won't be disappointed.</P>

<P>        I confess: I'm not much of a fan of martial arts 
films.  Bruce Lee never impressed me with his macho down-
with-one-punch fighting; I have trouble taking Jet Li's 
wire stunts with the seriousness I'm supposed to; and, 
like many people, I tend to think of the generally 
interchangeable chop sockey films on the shelves of my 
local video store as tripe-wannabe.  
        But I love Jackie Chan, and Drunken Master II, one 
of Jackie's most martial arts-heavy films of the last few 
years, is a major cause of my admiration.
        In Drunken Master II (I haven't seen Drunken Master 
I, and I didn't get the impression I was missing anything 
in this film) a lavish (by Hong Kong standards) period 
piece, Jackie Chan plays Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hong, 
whom he presents here as a kind of turn-of-the-century 
Chinese generation Xer, who spends his time hanging out 
in the market with his friends and goofing off with the 
family servant.  Fei-hong is a good-but-not-great martial 
artist regularly, but he is a master of "drunken boxing," 
which means that when he's drunk, he becomes a 
staggering, unpredictable dynamo.  Early in the film, 
Fei-hong fights with a mysterious stranger he finds 
acting suspiciously while on board a train waiting to 
cross the border.  The fight is just one of the film's 
many stunning set pieces, starting under a train in 
quarters so cramped you're amazed the actors can move, 
let alone fight, and it continues under a boardwalk and 
into a barn.  During the fight, Fei-hong's box of ginseng 
is mixed up with the stranger's box, which, to Fei-hong's 
surprise and distress, contains an Imperial Jade seal.  
Naturally both the good guys and the bad guys want it 
back, and Fei-hong finds himself in the midst of a plot 
of the British Consulate to steal Chinese artifacts and 
ship them off to England.  It all comes to a head in the 
film's stunning climax in an iron foundry, which features 
some of Jackie Chan's very best stunt-work, including a 
scene where he crawls backwards over a bed of hot coals!
        Unlike most Jackie Chan films, the plot here holds 
together relatively well.  Sure there are a few holes 
(and a couple of big ones), and no one will mistake it 
for The Godfather, but it serves its purpose: it connects 
the fights and jokes, and it manages to work in real 
character development, pathos and a sociopolitical 
subtext about the relationship between a colony and the 
mother-state.  
        This film gives Jackie a chance to really show off 
what he can do physically.  The fights are thrilling, 
breathtaking pieces of imaginative and complex 
choreography, easily the best I've ever seen.  They do a 
great job of showing off Jackie Chan's incredible grace, 
skill and timing, and to top it off, he has a great 
screen presence and a real comic sensibility: Jackie 
Chan's fights come across looking like all the best parts 
of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Buster Keaton and Charlie 
Chaplin movies.  His trademark use of props is readily 
apparent, and he deftly swings and tosses around chairs, 
benches, tables, fans, flowerpots and wine bottles with 
remarkable regularity.  At one point he tosses a purse 
into the air, ducks a blow, catches the purse and places 
it on top of his opponent's head, punches him several 
times, and catches the purse as his foe falls, all in one 
fluid motion over the space of a single shot mere seconds 
long.  The scenes where Fei-hong fights while intoxicated 
in order to use his "drunken boxing" are particularly 
impressive; these scenes give Jackie an opportunity to 
make faces and stagger from punch to punch, dodge kicks 
while falling against walls or guzzling wine, toss 
bottles into the air to keep them from being knocked out 
of his hand, and generally clown around.
        Jackie Chan is as warm and charming as ever, and 
looks good enough at forty that he is not too 
unbelievable in the role of an aimless but well-
intentioned twenty-something living with his parents.  
However charismatic and watchable Jackie is, though, he 
is not a good enough actor or strong enough personality 
to hold a film on his own.  It's fortunate, then, that 
this film has such a great supporting cast, especially 
Fei-hong's parents.  Ti Lung plays Fei-hong's strict 
father, Wong Kei-ying, as a man of wisdom and strong 
emotion.  In the movie's most heart-wrenching scene, Kei-
ying throws Fei-hong out of the house after he drinks so 
much he accidently strikes him.  You can see on his face 
the conflict between his rage at what he sees as a lack 
of proper respect and his love for his son: surprisingly 
human emotions for a martial arts film.
        Anita Mui, who is woefully underused as the shop 
owner in Rumble in the Bronx, also shines here as Fei-
hong's pregnant, adoring stepmother, who is a little too 
eager to use her own kung fu in her delicate condition.  
It's a great role, and she plays it for all it's worth, 
camping it up with an infectious enthusiasm.
        The direction and editing are superb.  The pacing, 
in particular is very good.  The fight scenes never get 
to be boring or exhausting.  They always leave you 
wanting to see just a little more, to watch Jackie just a 
little longer, a technique which works well in this film, 
which can actually deliver on the promise of more and 
better things to come later while still impressing you at 
the time.  And the rest of the film isn't just filler: it 
is very funny, sometimes moving, and always engaging.  
The opening scenes, where a train pulls into a station 
and is mobbed by vendors selling food to the passengers 
through the windows, while Fei-hong and the family's 
servant wander the train have such a great energy that 
the first fight feels like icing on the cake, rather than 
the start of the action.  As a footnote, the man that 
Jackie fights under the train in that first fight scene 
is the film's director, Lau Ka-Leung, who is rumoured to 
have been replaced during the shooting, with the 
director's job given to Jackie Chan.  Regardless of who 
did the job, though, it's excellent work.
        The film's weakest point is the villains, whom we 
never really get to know outside Jackie Chan's fights 
with them.  The character who should be the main villain, 
the sadistic British politician in charge of the art 
treasure smuggling, is only on-screen to boss around his 
henchmen, and eventually just disappears, without facing 
any sort of punishment.  The henchmen are appropriately 
despicable, especially after one strips Fei-hong and ties 
him up in the town square after he fails to provide a 
good fight, but they are not particularly memorable.
        This weakness is just a nitpicking point, however.  
On the whole, Drunken Master II is an excellent film, and 
first class entertainment.  I personally feel that New 
Line made a big mistake in releasing the comparatively 
lackluster Rumble in the Bronx instead of Drunken Master 
II as North America's reintroduction to Jackie Chan.  
This film has far superior fights, stunts, acting, 
writing and direction, and showcases Jackie Chan's 
talents far better, and I LIKED Rumble.  I give this 
movie my highest recommendation.  Fortunately, it is 
slated to be released in North America late in 1997, 
provided Rumble in the Bronx is a hit, but there is no 
reason to wait that long: do yourself a favour, make the 
extra effort and rent this movie, even (or perhaps 
especially) if you didn't like Rumble in the Bronx or, 
like me, you don't like martial arts movies in general.  
Even if it doesn't make a hard core Chan fan out of you, 
it is still more exciting, entertaining and generally FUN 
than any of the sterile megabudget Hollywood action 
blockbusters of the last five years.</P>
