<PRE>                             HONEYMOON IN VEGAS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     HONEYMOON IN VEGAS is a film directed and written by Andrew
Bergman.  It stars James Caan, Nicolas Cage, Sarah Jessica Parker, with
Pat Morita and Ann Bancroft.  Rated PG-13, for sexual situations.</P>
<P>     HONEYMOON IN VEGAS is a romantic comedy with an excellent cast and
a first-rate director-writer.  Andrew Bergman was once called by New
York magazine "The Unknown King of Comedy" for writing some very funny
comedies, such as BLAZING SADDLES, THE IN-LAWS, and SOAP DISH, inter
alia.  In 1981 he stubbed his toe directing SO FINE, but in 1990 he did
the wonderful THE FRESHMAN, a much neglected and underappreciated gem
that starred Matthew Broderick and Marlon Brando (in one of the boldest
and bravest self-parodies I have ever seen).</P>
<P>     Then we've got the considerable talents of the cast.  James Caan,
looking slim and healthy, an actor who broke my heart by being brilliant
in THE GAMBLER and then pissing away his career for years, is perfect as
the charming, vicious gambler.  Nicolas Cage, mercifully minus his most
mannered affections, is the straight man and plays it without a single
wink at the camera.  Sarah Jessica Parker, who impressed a lot of people
in last year's L.A. STORY as the spacy, hyper-kinetic beach girl,
SanDeE, is a lot smarter here, but still the slightly dense, slightly
innocent love interest of Caan and Cage.</P>
<P>     The situation -- a boobish everyman caught up in the wiles of a
gangster and an increasingly absurd solution -- is familiar Bergman
territory.  As if the basic situation were not absurd enough, Bergman
goes over the line with a running joke about Elvis impersonators that
culminates in a scene so full of plot holes and so unlikely as to
qualify as a contemporary version of the deus ex machina who has solved
so many dramatic and comedic situations throughout the history of
theater.  There is also a problem with way Bergman handles his villain,
Caan's Tommy the gambler.  He sets him up as a sympathetic, if
unprincipled, character, not unlike Brando's Godfather parody, and then
in the last ten minutes turns Tommy into the blackest and most vile of
men, destroying the dynamic and ambiguity that had made the rest of film
complex and interesting.</P>
<P>     I recommend HONEYMOON IN VEGAS for its virtues and for its
interesting flaws, but you should go to a discount matinee to see them
and it.</P>
