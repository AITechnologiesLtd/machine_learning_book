<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:   <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>One of the surest signs that your impending wedding may not be the
wisest of life choices is when your grandpa keels over at your bachelor
party.  If that doesn't change your mind, try having Gramps telling you,
on his deathbed, that he never loved your grandmother.  Despite these
colossal warning signs, Ben (as in Affleck, Armageddon) decides to
proceed as planned with his nuptials to his bland but beautiful fiancée
(Maura Tierney, NewsRadio).</P>
<P>As if that wouldn't make things stressful enough, the two New Yorkers
decide to take separate flights to Savannah, Georgia - where the wedding
will take place - because Ben wants to spend time with his ailing
granddad.  His best man (Steve Zahn, You've Got Mail) stays behind with
Ben, but, as they're about to board their flight, bails out because he
forgot his shoes and the all-important rings.</P>
<P>Again Ben ignores this as an omen and hops on the plane, even though he
is deathly afraid of flying.  He is seated next to a woman named Sarah
(Sandra Bullock, Practical Magic), who looks like Ally Sheedy heading
back home for her 10-year Breakfast Club High School reunion.  As it
takes off, a seagull flies into the plane's engine, causing it to crash
into that lovely `Welcome to NY' sign that graces the end of the runway
at LaGuardia.  This forewarning also goes unnoticed by Ben.  Starting to
get the impression that he's no super genius, eh?</P>
<P>Long story short, Ben saves Sarah and hauls her body out of the
wreckage.  After she comes to, he finds out that she also needs to get
to Savannah tout suite in order to sell a failing bagel shop.  The two
decide to travel together and the following eighty or so minutes unfolds
just like Planes, Trains & Automobiles, with each mode of transportation
being less successful than the previous.  But their predicament only
seems to invigorate the dopey Ben except, of course, for that fact that
he (duh!) falls in love with Sarah.  Unfortunately, there is no `Where's
your hand?'  `Between two pillows.'  `Those aren't pillows!' scene.</P>
<P>Don't let the ads fool you – Forces is no chick-flick.  It's
surprisingly funny and has a terrific look, thanks to director Bronwen
Hughes (Harriet the Spy) and cinematographer Elliot Davis (Out of
Sight), and culminates in an amazing finale that merges a big outdoor
wedding and a powerful hurricane.  As far as acting, Affleck does his
best to make you forget about that abominable `animal cracker' scene
from Armageddon, while Bullock does okay with her less meaty role.  In
spite of the strange transformation that her character goes through
(from thick black eye makeup and crazy hair to…well, to Sandra Bullock),
she gives her least annoying performance in years.</P>
<P>1:49 – PG-13 for some adult language and adult situation</P>
