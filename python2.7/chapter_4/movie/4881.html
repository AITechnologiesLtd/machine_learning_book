<P>When years ago I revisited Italy, what impressed me most was 
that Italian women had suddenly become so beautiful and so 
chic that they were almost stealing the thunder from 
Parisians. When I returned to Spain after Generalissimo 
Francisco Franco's death (1975), a rise in street pulchritude  
was also evident. What really struck me though was that people 
were now talking openly in the cafes and that sex magazines 
were hanging on kiosks like leaves on the trees of a rain 
forest. It was astonishing but not unusual. Those things go 
together, as reaction (and overreaction) to generations of 
traditionalism, prudishness and repression . </P>
<P>These days in Madrid there is something that the media call a 
movement, and have baptized "La Movida," a no-holds -barred 
flowering of swinging art and lifestyles in which filmmaker 
Pedro Almodovar figures with outrageous prominence.  </P>
<P>LAW OF DESIRE is Almodovar's sixth and latest feature. His 
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS? which was recently shown in 
the US, opens in a martial arts academy with the impromptu 
lovemaking between a charlady and a stranger.  </P>
<P>LAW OF DESIRE 's start is an even greater provocation to the 
squeamish, with a prolonged autoerotic scene by a man.  You 
may call it  graphic or  not-so-graphic as it does leaves 
enough to the imagination--it's a matter  of semiological and  
semenological interpretation, and of cultural standards. 
Having, however, produced his initial shock, "enfant terrible" 
Almodovar seems satisfied and tones down the descriptions in 
the balance of the movie. </P>
<P>This first scene turns out to be a movie-within-a-movie, and a 
hit with its Movida-type public. The film's maker is Pablo 
Quintero, a writer-director of plays and films, and an idol of 
the avant-garde Madrilenos.  </P>
<P>Pablo is a homosexual, although in his case and those of his 
companions, there are strong hints of bisexuality too. He is 
promiscuous, but, as I see it, not so much in absolute terms 
than as a form of autoeroticism, the psychological equivalent 
of the opening scenes. Just as any artist--including 
Pablo--wants to be admired, the private/public Pablo also  
wants to be desired. This is a rather messy state of mind. </P>
<P>To complicate matters further, Pablo is also in love with 
young Juan who responds yet is not quite sure that it's the 
way to go for him. To complicate the complication, Pablo has a 
beloved sister, Tina (Carmen Maura) who used to be his brother 
before he-she had a sex change. (Maura is perfect in her 
sexual ambiguity). </P>
<P>Tina has taken over the peculiar raising and education of a 
little girl, Ada, who, along with Tina, is prone to some 
delightfully kooky religious spasms. </P>
<P>Ada really belongs to another Ada, her mother, who used to be 
Tina's lover but is now searching for the perfect mate in 
Italy. Ada Senior is the most beautiful woman in the film. I 
thought for a moment that she was Ali MacGraw. Later I found 
out that she is Bibi Andersen, spelled almost like the name of 
an Ingmar Bergman star. Later yet I was told that Bibi is a 
famous transvestite in Madrid.</P>
<P>More to come. ( I'll do what I can, even though I keep 
laughing as I write these lines. They have to be written 
because, in the odd, fragmented way people and events are 
presented, it takes a long time for them to sink in and be 
sorted out.) </P>
<P>Pablo and another admirer, Antonio, the son of a well-to-do 
politician, pick each other up. Antonio has slicked down black 
hair, so brilliantined that it's like the surface of a 78 rpm 
phonograph record. (This must be an in-joke, a throwback to 
the looks of  male Spanish stars in films of earlier days).</P>
<P>Antonio is--or was until now--heterosexual. Pablo initiates 
him in the love that dare not speak its name, but shouts it 
from the rooftops in this movie. For Pablo this is another 
exercise in conquest (he's of the race of the Conquistadores), 
but for Antonio it's a "coup de foudre, " "l'amour fou" of the 
old surrealists, "el amor brujo" (love the magician). </P>
<P>Antonio becomes insanely jealous of Juan, finds him in the 
country and kills him. In the meantime, Pablo has given his 
sister the stage part  in Cocteau's one-woman play, "The Human 
Voice," (which became Giancarlo Menotti's "The Telephone").</P>
<P>After Juan's murder the film shifts into a silly story of 
police detection, with black humor clues all over. (The 
critics have by and large decreed this second part weaker than 
the first, but I find it, on the contrary, a funny 
reinforcement to the movie's campiness). It's handled  
Spanishly, yet also like one of those French thrillers that 
imitate US thrillers. The movie advances in a series of 
intended howlers, getting lurider and insaner by the minute. </P>
<P>Antonio destroys a piece of evidence,(a garish shirt which is 
just like Pablo's) while finding phony alibis for his snoopy 
German mother. Comic  inspectors suspect Pablo and search his 
place. The senior man finds coke. It's not enough for 
evidence, so he snorts it. He also has this advice for his 
young companion:" To be a good cop it is not enough to be 
unscrupulous, you got to have a sense of humor."  </P>
<P>Pablo, disconsolate at his boyfriend's death, smashes into a 
tree and suffers (or does he really?) from amnesia. At the 
hospital, trying to bring back his memory, Tina out-lurids the 
lurid with the tale of her past, her love affair with their 
father who had Tina (Tino?) become a woman, took her to 
Morocco, then dropped her, leaving her with a distrust of men. 
Except that now she's found her ideal, who turns out to be 
Antonio, which leads to a superbly ridiculous, Wagnerian 
ending. </P>
<P>In between we have also witnessed  a bizarre  interview by one 
of the ugliest women in Spain (or is she a man?);  a queer 
rehearsal (or was it?) of "The Human Voice";compromising 
letters by Juan signed "Laura P";an erotic gag of Tina asking 
to get doused by the hose of a street-cleaner; a befuddled  
priest; plus many more Almodovarian grotesqueries.  </P>
<P>Almodovar claims he's a romantic making romantic films. I 
won't argue the point, since he works marginally along the 
lines of the melodramas by Douglas Sirk in  Hollywood and  of 
R.W. Fassbinder in Germany,  while at the same time mocking 
them as well as overheated movies by other directors. Even his 
titles  reflect this.Naming his films LABYRINTH OF PASSION or 
LAW OF DESIRE is an irreverent homage to those hard-breathing 
flicks that were reined in by the "good taste" of older times. 
But in Amodovar there's little of Sirk's commercial eagerness 
or of Fassbinder's despair and masochism. The Spaniard is at 
peace with himself and contemplates a world (his own) with a 
tongue within a cheek that must stretch from Castille to 
Catalonia. </P>
<P>Not only does Almodovar include a film within his film, he 
keeps throughout a running commentary (sometimes too indirect 
to be grasped immediately) about himself and the main film he 
is making. Serious points are not absent, but these  are 
somewhat obscured by Almodovar's demented inventions. </P>
<P>Typically, these are set in garish surroundings and shot in 
garish color. To what extent the architecture and interior 
sets of this movie are intentionally awful, I cannot tell.I am 
ready and eager for the next movie by Almodovar, but not for 
his designer to redecorate my house. </P>
