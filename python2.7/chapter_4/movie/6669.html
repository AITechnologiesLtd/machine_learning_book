<PRE>                      A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>A Thin Line Between Love and Hate (1996) NO STARS out of ***** - C:Martin
Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Bobby Brown, Della Reese, Roger E. Mosley.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence stars in, wrote, produced, directed, and supervised the
music of this absolutely dreadful "movie" about what might be one of the
most unlikable main characters in movie history.</P>
<P>Lawrence plays a "ladies man" who has dedicated his life to the pursuit of
women, just so he can have sex with them once and then dump them.
Immediately, NO ONE should care what happens to this man. He soon meets his
match (Whitfield), who leads him on for days and then decides to take
revenge when she realizes she's been used and lied to. Immediately, EVERYONE
should be rooting for this woman. However, the film is written so that
Lawrence is the good guy in the situation, and Whitfield is just a crazy
psycho.</P>
<P>Pauly Shore is a brilliant comedian compared to Lawrence, and I absolutely
HATE Pauly Shore. Also, like Adam Sandler in "Billy Madison", not once in
the film can Lawrence say a line of dialogue normally. At least one word in
each sentence has to be exaggerated for no reason whatsoever and after about
five minutes it couldn't be more irritating. "A Thin Line Between Love and
Hate" is easily one of the worst films of the year and most definately one
of the worst "comedies" of all time. I think that being murdered would be
funnier than this movie.</P>
