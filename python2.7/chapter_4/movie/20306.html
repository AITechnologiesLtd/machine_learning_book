<P>'Runaway Bride' is such a bad film that it's difficult to know where to
begin.  The poster for it certainly made it look like it was more interested
in showing the physical attributes of its stars rather than their talents.
Their smiles, their smirks, their way with each other that was all seen in
1990's 'Pretty Woman'.  The mismatched man and woman who dislike each other
at first but later fall in love in such an unconvincing manner that not only
is it an insult to the audiences intelligence but takes two very serious
subjects like prostitution (the background subject of 'Pretty Woman') and
libelous journalism ( the background subject of 'Runaway Bride') and sugar
coats them in a shameful manner.  If you're going to make a film like this,
why inflate it with such an overblown cast of characters who mean nothing to
the story except to the actors playing them as well as the people calling
the shots?</P>
<P>I think if you asked most movie audiences, they probably would have wanted
to see a sequel to 'Pretty Woman' nine years after the original with more
admirable qualities rather than another pairing of its two leading stars in
a movie with different material.  Look at 1997.  The cast of 1988's 'A Fish
Called Wanda' teamed up for 'Fierce Creatures' an abysmal attempt to go home
again and capture the magic of the original chemistry that 'Wanda' was able
to project.  Better yet, how about a prequel to 'Pretty Woman' showing how
the character's lives progressed into their eventual choices to make a
living and eventually meeting each other.  But no, director Garry Marshall
chooses to take his skill that has never really amounted to anything above
the level of television entertainment and make a movie that appeals only to
a certain audience and has very little to offer to anyone else.</P>
<P>In 'Runaway Bride', Gere plays Ike Graham, a journalist for USA Today who
writes a story that causes a firestorm of controversy.  His source, an
intoxicated guy in a bar, tells Ike that there's a woman in small-town
America named Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) who has developed a habit of
being a man-eater.  She has allegedly dumped several would be grooms at the
altar and earned the nick name "runaway bride" because she literally runs
away, bridal dress and all and one incident shows here managing to escape on
a horse at full charge.  After writing an anti-female article that knocks
Maggie at every turn, women rap Ike on the head with a copy of the newspaper
as he walks the big city streets and his editor and ex-wife (Rita Wilson)
fires him after she says that the stuff he wrote is "actionable" on the part
of its subject.  Determined to stand by his story win vindication for
himself and investigate Maggie herself, Ike travels to her small town and
encounters its culture with all of its people and, of course, Ike and Maggie
fall in love but do they stay together?  You'll have to see for yourself.</P>
<P>'Runaway Bride' had me wanting to scream in disgust at many of the obvious
phony scenes of a relationship that is not in the least bit convincing and
its climax which involves the news of how the two leads lives turn out for
the moment, has all of the films characters receiving the news one way or
the other and projecting their reaction to it like you would react to a plot
twist in your favourite soap opera.  To further complicate things, there are
even some in-jokes about 'Pretty Woman' which aren't even funny.</P>
<P>The most manipulative film in the last ten years is 1989's 'Dead Poets
Society' which saved itself by giving the audience an original story to fall
back on and the outcome was both believable and flowed naturally and didn't
look manufactured.  When a film can manipulate its audience and disguise it
as genuine entertainment, it's still sort of a cheat but at least it can
make up for its shortcomings by injecting a sense of convincing traits.  The
manipulation here is both obvious with no redeeming qualities and a style
similar to fast food which is digested quickly and forgotten even faster.</P>
