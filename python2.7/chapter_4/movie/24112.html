<PRE>                           KEEPING THE FAITH
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Fresh, pleasant, and funny, KEEPING
          THE FAITH manages to give new life to the tired
          "romantic triangle comedy" by introducing a lot of
          fun (and some material that is serious) about
          Judaism and Catholicism.  Ben Stiller plays a rabbi
          and Ed Norton plays a priest, both of whom are in
          love with their mutual childhood friend who is now
          a stunning beauty.  Jenna Elfman has a really
          magnetic screen personality.  The main storyline is
          familiar territory, but there is more than enough
          going on in this film to keep things popping.
          Edward Norton stars, co-produces, and directs.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), 2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is not easy to write a film about a romantic triangle and not
cover territory that has been covered by countless other romantic
triangle films like HIS GIRL FRIDAY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.  Stuart
Blumberg's script for KEEPING THE FAITH does it by filling in what
would be dull spaces with insight and comedy about Judaism and
Catholicism.  Two of the three main characters are clergymen wanting to
try unconventional approaches to make their services more enjoyable,
relevant, and in general more inviting.  Each has to buck an
establishment tied to more traditional approaches to religious
services.  The two men's presence pits the more conservative and
generally older members of their congregations against a younger
generation more open to newer ideas.  KEEPING THE FAITH can flit back
and forth from the main plotline to the religious subplots and never
get dull.  On the whole the film mixes two parts humor with one part
seriousness.  And one thing that sets this film apart from so many
other films is just that the jokes really are funny.  It is unusual
these days to find a writer who can be funny without sacrificing taste.
Perhaps there will be small numbers of Catholics and Jews that will be
uncomfortable with some of the "new approaches," but it is done in a
much more loving fashion than similar sorts of humor in last year's
DOGMA.</P>
<P>     Back in Junior High both Jake Schram and Brian Finn became fast
friends with cute and plucky Anna Reilly.  Sadly, after a year or so
Anna had to move away.  Jake and Brian both had ideas on how to make
their respective religions more fun and more relevant.  Jake (Ben
Stiller) became a rabbi and Brian (Edward Norton) becomes a priest.
Each tries to modernize his religion, sometimes with surprising and
unorthodox results.  Brian mixes services with stand-up comedy.  Jake
mixes new forms of music into the Jewish service.  Then comes the day
that Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) contacts Brian and tells him she is
returning to New York.  Anna, who has matured into a stunning beauty is
now a workaholic repairing businesses.  She is addicted to her cell
phone.  The story goes back and forth between the two men's religious
careers and their attraction to the woman both love, but who is
forbidden to each of them.  Jake is looking for a wife, but is only
willing to marry a Jew.  Brian is Anna's religion, but the vows of his
priesthood force him to remain celibate.  Like a Seinfeld episode, for
a long time nothing much happens but the characters discussing their
situation.  But Anna's attraction is too great to resist forever.  Each
of the men must gauge how deeply he feels about Anna and how deeply
about his religion.</P>
<P>     It was claimed that watching just Spencer Tracy listening was more
interesting than watching other actors speak.  That seems to have been
a lesson learned by Jenna Elfman.  If the name is familiar, she is
married to a nephew of film composer Danny Elfman.  Jenna Elfman never
just stands waiting for her next line.  She is inconstant motion and
reacts to every line spoken.  This is just the sort of actor other
actors hate to play opposite since she grabs the attention of most of
the audience, certainly most of the males.  Edward Norton demonstrated
in PRIMAL FEAR, AMERICAN HISTORY X, and THE FIGHT CLUB that he can do
some dynamic personalities.  But in KEEPING THE FAITH he comes off just
a bit bland.  Ben Stiller is more serious here than in films like
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, but he carries the serious moments as well as the
comic ones.  In addition there are some veteran actors in smaller roles
including Anne Bancroft, Ron Rifkin, and Eli Wallach.  There is even a
small role for director Milos Forman.</P>
<P>     Anastos N. Michos gives us some moderately good photography of New
York and this film gives us a counter-example to the usual wisdom that
no good film ever starts with an overhead shot of New York.  One
quibble: one of the women Jake dates is a Jewish news commentator who
specializes in the Middle East and frequently is sent to Iraq and
Libya.  I do not believe that Jewish women get a lot of cooperation in
the Arabic countries in the Middle East.</P>
<P>     This is a film that beats a lot of odds to be an intelligent
romantic comedy that is constantly entertaining.  While the end seems a
little strained, it is better than one might expect.  I rate it a 7 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
