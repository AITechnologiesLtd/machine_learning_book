<PRE>It's Cool To Be `Cruel'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Have you ever been so rich that the hardest thing in life was to find
new ways of entertaining yourself?  Forget about boring plays or
humdrum sports spectacles.  These venues are just the imagination of
someone else's world.  When you're incredibly rich and spoiled, you
can bring others into your world.  And in the world of Kathryn  (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) and her stepbrother, Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe),
theirs is a cruel game featuring a swirling atmosphere of deception,
tease, and sex.   </P>
<P>Schoolmates and acquaintances become their pawns, unsuspecting guys
and girls become casual targets of their sexual conquests and
manipulative whims, and those that find their way into their game of
one-upmanship will find it to be a ruinous experience.  For Kathryn,
she has set her sights on the sweet, incoming freshman, Cecile (Selma
Blair).  Her goal is to destroy her reputation.  It's not that Cecile
did anything wrong.  But  Kathryn's boyfriend recently ended the
relationship to be with her.  To usurp her in popularity is
unforgivable.  To exact revenge on him, she will befriend her while
secretly plotting her downfall.  Make her into damaged goods just to
hurt him.  And how will she strip her of her good name?  To start, she
gives her a personal lesson on how to French kiss and from there her
journey towards adulthood grows more lascivious. To further deflower
her innocence, she introduces him to the conniving Sebastian. 
Sebastian is quite the charmer and as a sexual conquest, she would be
far too easy.  He currently has his sights on Annette (Reese
Witherspoon), daughter of the headmaster at his expensive private
school and who was featured in a magazine article stating why she
wanted to remain a virgin until she got married.  `A paradigm of
chastity and virtue, she'll be my greatest triumph yet,' he boasts to
his stepsister.  Of course in this kind of film, you can't brag like
that without backing it up with a wager.  The bet is made and if
Sebastian fails, she wins his classic roadster.  But what if he wins? 
`Then,' says Kathryn while caressing herself, `you can have what
you've always wanted since our parents got married.'</P>
<P>By now, you probably have a good idea of what this film embodies. 
It's a film that is filled with twisted sexual innuendo and endless
seduction.  There's no doubt that this is a film for adults (with
adult-oriented language that is shocking yet forthright) even though
the stars are twenty-something.  But there's actually an entertaining
film in here that might surprise you.  The thing that I found
satisfying was how well it utilized its 100 minutes of film time. 
It's a tautly written and well-paced film.  We know that these two are
cruel and we know that someone's going to get hurt really bad.  The
story never detours or strays as it makes its way to its ending.  The
actors do well as people brimming with fake smiles, ulterior motives
and insincerity.  But it's not the acting that merits the
recommendation, although they Gellar and Phillipe carry themselves
confidently.  There's an undeniable sense style and wit that makes
this film wickedly fun and Machiavellian intentions that are
delectably cruel.</P>
