<PRE>Freaks (1932)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 78</PRE>
<P>After director Tod Browning's big success at Universal
with "Dracula", he was given freedom at MGM for his
next film project.  "Freaks" was the result, with its
unusual cast of people with various birth defects, and
its chilling finale involving poisoning and mutilation.</P>
<P>The film was too strong for contemporary audiences.
After the previews went poorly, a half hour was cut
(and unfortunately, lost).  Still, "Freaks" was pulled
from release after a few weeks.  The film was a disaster
for MGM, not just financially, but for the studio's
image as well.</P>
<P>Today, "Freaks" has lost some of its ability to
shock audiences.  But it is still startling to see
Johnny Eck, a man without a torso who walks around
using his hands, and Prince Randian, who has no limbs
at all.  There's the Siamese twins, Daisy and Violet
Hilton, each married to a different husband.  And
there's more: people without arms, severely retarded
pinheads, a bearded lady, dwarves, and midgets
Hans (Harry Earles) and Frieda (Daisy Earles, Harry's
sister).</P>
<P>The 'freaks' are all part of a travelling circus.
Hans, who has inherited a fortune, has a crush on
Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova).  Cleopatra, who is
normal-sized, decides to marry Hans for his money,
and then poison him.  She is in cahoots with venal
strongman Hercules (Henry Victor).  But the closely-knit
'freaks' get wind of Cleopatra's schemes, and plan
an appropriately hideous revenge.</P>
<P>Browning's message is that Hercules and Cleopatra are
the real 'freaks'.  We should be judged by our character
and not our appearance.  This message was certainly
lost on the 1932 general public, but Browning has
been subsequently vindicated.  Today, "Freaks" is
considered a classic, and not an exploitation film
(unlike the embarrassing 1930s midget western "The Terror
of Tiny Town").  While the 'freaks' exact a ruthless
revenge, the actions of Hercules and Cleopatra are
so despicable that they fully deserve their fate.</P>
<P>While "Freaks" is a very good film, it is not
outstanding.  One of the minor "comic relief" characters
stutters, and perhaps Hercules and Cleopatra are too
crass to be credible.  First billed and all around
good guy Phroso (Wallace Ford) isn't interesting,
while the character of his girlfriend Venus (Leila
Hyams) is muddled.</P>
