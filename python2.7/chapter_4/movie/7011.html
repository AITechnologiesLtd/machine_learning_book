<PRE>Twice Upon a Time (1983) 77m.</PRE>
<P>Inventive animated tale produced by George Lucas and directed by John
Korty and Charles Swenson.  The minds of sleeping Rushers (humans) are
being influenced by the dream-dispensing land of Frivoli and the
nightmare-inducing Murkworks.  The key to their power struggle is the
mainspring from the Cosmic clock, which controls all time.  Fast,
witty story isn't for all children, especially those who won't have
patience for its unique look and flippant, incidental storyline. 
Visually, film is a combination of rainbow-hued watercolors, pen and
ink, live action, and still photographs.  Its endearingly scrappy look
is matched by its throwaway dialogue - I can imagine this being the
kind of cartoon Robert Altman might produce. </P>
<P>Hip characters provide many laughs, especially overenthusiastic
superhero Rod Rescueman (James Crenna), and a nonchalant fairy
godmother (Judith Kahan Kampmann).  There's also the nominal lead
character Ralph, a thing that looks like an extra from YELLOW
SUBMARINE (voice actor Lorenzo Music).  Film's main basis for
characterization is to play against stereotype - an idea we're overly
familiar with now, but don't mind in this case because the whole
production has such an easygoing feel about it.  The animators slip in
many visual gags, mostly to do with film and television - one of the
characters is an aspiring actress, another an aspiring writer, another
an aspiring heroic lead.  Consequently, story treats the manufacture
of dreams and nightmares as being akin to the movie-making industry. 
Most interesting visual effects occur when we see a nightmare
activated in the world of the Rushers. </P>

                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     ANGEL BABY, a tale of love, loss, and mental illness from Michael 
Rymer, swept through the 1995 Australian Film Awards, winning seven, 
including best picture, best director, best actor (John Lynch), and best 
actress (Jacqueline McKenzie).  However, unlike SHINE, which was 
similarly lauded at the 1996 AFIs, no overseas distributor rushed to 
pick up ANGEL BABY.  The reason?  Despite certain thematic similarities, 
SHINE is an upper; ANGEL BABY is a downer.  </P>
<P>     Depressing or not (I suppose it depends on your point-of-view), 
there's no denying ANGEL BABY's emotional power.  This is the sort of 
film that lays it all on the line, and requires the kind of intense 
commitment from its lead actors that few motion pictures demand.  John 
Lynch (SOME MOTHER'S SON) and Jacqueline McKenzie (ROMPER STOMPER) 
deliver intense, passionate portrayals that obliterate the barrier of 
the screen.  In large part, ANGEL BABY succeeds because of their work.</P>
<P>     Lynch plays Harry, a schizophrenic who, thanks to medication, is 
able to move through society in a relatively normal fashion.  Harry, who 
lives with his brother (Colin Friels), sister-in-law (Deborra-Lee 
Furness), and nephew (Daniel Daperis), is an outpatient at a psychiatric 
clinic called "the Club House".  One day, while there, he catches sight 
of Kate (Jacqueline McKenzie), a new client.  She ignores him, but, shy 
and smitten, Harry decides to follow her as she makes her way from the 
clinic to the halfway house where she lives.  Realizing that she's being 
shadowed, Kate confronts Harry, and, after a few tender getting-to-know-
each-other scenes, they are frantically in love.  The sheer intensity of 
their emotion has disastrous consequences, for, although Harry and Kate 
believe their love is strong enough to overcome anything -- even 
insanity -- the reality is far less romantic or forgiving.</P>
<P>     Watching this film, I was reminded strongly of a couple of recent 
motion pictures:  JUDE (which is based on Thomas Hardy's JUDE THE 
OBSCURE) and BREAKING THE WAVES.  Both of those films, like ANGEL BABY, 
deal with the effects of a powerful, all-consuming love.  JUDE ends in 
tragedy, disproving the cliche that love conquers all.  BREAKING THE 
WAVES centers on a potentially-schizophrenic young woman who clings 
desperately to both her husband and her sanity.  In one way or another, 
both of these threads are echoed in ANGEL BABY, which explores not only 
the transcendent power of love, but its limitations, as well.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Michael Rymer's imperfect narrative contains a few 
contrived missteps, but the characters and their relationships are so 
effectively conceived and expertly realized that it's difficult to fault 
the film much for this.  ANGEL BABY is well-focused on an emotional 
level, and I found myself unexpectedly touched by this unconventional 
love story.  There's far more than mental illness and its attendant pain 
to Harry and Kate's relationship.  The tenderness, eroticism, and 
ecstasy of their interaction leaves the most forceful impression.  We 
can't help becoming involved as they walk an uncertain mental tightrope, 
clutching at each other all the way.</P>
<P>     For those watching the film in the United States, it's worth 
acknowledging an unusal bit of cross-cultural trivia.  Kate is a WHEEL 
OF FORTUNE addict (she believes the words in the puzzles are actually 
private messages from a mystical spirit), and it's a rather curious 
experience to note just how similar, yet different, the Australian 
version of the game show is from its North American counterpart.  </P>
<P>     Having seen ANGEL BABY, it's easy for me to understand why major 
distributors like Fine Line and Miramax stayed away.  Much like BREAKING 
THE WAVES, it's a raw, intense, carnal film that will appeal most 
strongly to adventurous movie-goers.  Actually, it's ironic that the 
very qualities which scared off everyone except Cinepix Film Properties 
are those that give ANGEL BABY its unique identity and make it such a 
compelling viewing experience.</P>
