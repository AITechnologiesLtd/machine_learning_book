<P>This film is wonderful!  Superb acting by Helen Hayes and Ingrid Bergman (who
won an Oscar in a comeback role) brings out the best of a clever and powerful
script.</P>
<P>The story centers around the efforts of a con man, Bounine (Yul Brynner),
once a Russian prince, to pass off a lovely refugee (Ingrid Bergman) as the
Princess Anastasia, last of the Romanovs.  As the story progresses, however,
an interesting twist emerges: she may actually be the real Anastasia. As the
pair head to Denmark to meet the Dowager Empress (Helen Hayes) in hope of
obtaining recognition for Anastasia, a furtive, unacknowledged love affair
blossoms between the brooding, imperious Prince and the confused yet
vivacious Princess.</P>
<P>Three pillars of strength hold this story up: strongly-drawn characters, a
restrained, witty script and exceptional acting. Despite its dependence on
universal themes of love, family and identity, the film never lurches into
the vulgar or obvious. Yul Brynner, always a treat, does a sterling job
portraying a man caught in an emotional undertow. Helen Hayes is especially
delightful as the crusty, suffer-no-fools Dowager Empress. There are some
truly exquisite scenes. The recognition scene between Bergman and Hayes is
tremendous, two fine actors at the top of their game. The scene in which the
Prince informs the Dowager Empress of his feelings is also quite moving. The
ending, which could have been incredibly mawkish and sentimental, is handled
with such grace and understatement that it leaves the viewer completely
satisfied without feeling stuffed.  I'd give this one 5 out of 5, good
offbeat fare for those nights when you're pacing the aisles at Blockbuster
and nothing looks very interesting.</P>
