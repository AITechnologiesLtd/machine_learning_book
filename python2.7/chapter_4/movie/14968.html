<P>starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Martin Donovan, Queen Latifah
written and directed by Richard LaGravanese</P>
<P>LIVING OUT LOUD started production as "The Kiss" (borrowed from
Chekhov's story), a title dropped because of its associations with a
best-selling, non-fictional account of a father and daughter's
incestuous relationship. LIVING OUT LOUD is not about such family ties;
it's not about much of anything---a sheep dressed in "Girl Power"
clothing. LIVING OUT LOUD is the directorial debut of a wonderful
screenwriter (LaGravanese adapted The Bridges of Madison County and The
Horse Whisperer, in addition to receiving an Oscar-nomination for his
original screenplay The Fisher King) who should stay behind the
typewriter.</P>
<P>A blonde Hunter plays Judith, caregiver to an old, rich woman (Lin
Shaye) and recent dumpee of husband Dr. Nelson (the always-charismatic
Donovan). Judith fantasizes some of the time: about suicide, about
meeting her idol, torch singer Liz Bailey (Latifah)... These day-dream
sequences are weaved into the film without warning; sometimes, we're not
sure whether a scene is unfolding inside or outside of her head. (Echoes
of Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie, Louis Buñuel's anti-narrative
masterwork.) DeVito plays Pat, the down-on-his luck elevator operator of
her building; his teenage daughter has just passed away, so he Judith
unite over their common losses. He falls in love with her quickly, but
she has her sights set on the mysterious stranger (Elias Koteas) who
accidentally (yes, accidentally) made out with her at her favourite
nightclub. Actually, Judith has her sights set on any man who is the
exact physical opposite of chubby, stubby Pat, though the filmmakers
gloss over her shallowness.</P>
<P>LaGravanese has an ear for dialogue-born and raised in a household of
women, he writes exceptionally good, complex female characters. But this
movie has all the trappings of a first-timer's feature: no sense of
economy-otherwise known as I'm-in-love-with-every-frame Syndrome
(DeVito's daughter's silent death scene is covered in so many shots the
cutting disrupts the mood), no sense of pace (though never boring, the
middle section is lumpy), and no idea what to do with anybody else but
the main protagonists (with the exception of Latifah, who has a presence
which extends beyond her slightly underwritten role-I wouldn't be
surprised if she received a Supporting Actress nomination come next
February). DeVito gives it his all-this is the warmest performance of
his career, which makes Judith seem all the more like a cold fish for
shunning his awkward advances; we are supposed to see a little bit of
ourselves in Judith, but I lost my affection for her once she hired a
studly masseuse before DeVito's despondent eyes. Reactions to Hunter's
character will surely vary from person to person (after all, selfishness
is our nature, and to some degree, Judith is a refreshingly flawed human
character), but her actions, compounded by a head-scratching "Mary Tyler
Moore"-esque epilogue, are ultimately what prevent me from recommending
the film.</P>
<P>I have mentally dwelled upon LIVING OUT LOUD for weeks since my initial
viewing, only to come to the above conclusions. At the very least,
DeVito begins a new career path with this film-were he and Latifah only
reason enough to see it.</P>
