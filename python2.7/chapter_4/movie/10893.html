<PRE>The Game</PRE>
<PRE>Summary </PRE>
<P>    Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) has quite a dull
life. Although he is a very wealthy investment banker he lives alone
in a giant house and has no social life to speak of. On his 48th
birthday his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) surprises him by giving him a
strange present - an appointment with Consumer Recreation Services
(CRS). Conrad does not explain anything about the company or what they
actually provide, just to call and use the appointment. "It will
change your life" Conrad explains.
    After some thought Nicholas agrees. He spends an entire day at CRS
filling out questionnaires and getting vague responses from a CRS
employee (James Rebhorn) to his specific questions about the company
and its services. All he is told is that the company provides a game
that differs per client. Nicholas does not know what his game entails
or when exactly it begins. A previous CRS client explains to Nicholas
"The Game provides what is lacking in your life".
    Nicholas' Game begins. A message and a strange key are left in a
creepy clown puppet in his driveway. It is a sign of strange events to
come, including a night with a mysterious woman Christine (Deborah
Kara Unger) that consists of a fake ambulance rescue, a seemingly
broken elevator (that his mysterious key fixes), and fleeing arrest
from police and police dogs. Was the woman part of the game, or was it
a chance meeting?
    Events soon take a turn for the worst. Nicholas is linked to a
trashed hotel room (that his credit card paid for), that is littered
with pornography and cocaine. Soon Nicholas finds possible evidence
that CRS may be running a scam to steal money from clients at any
cost. It seems murder, bribery and blackmail are also part of CRS'
business practices. Running for his life, Nicholas must try to end the
game. Or is it all part of the game?</P>
<P>Commentary
    This is a somewhat familiar formula. Bad stuff happens to our
hero, and just when it cannot get any worse, it does. At one point the
Michael Douglas character is drugged and wakes up in Mexico with no
money, no passport and no food.  Ouch. The first movie that came to my
mind with this formula was "Pacific Heights", where Michael Keaton,
playing the tenant from hell, played landlords Matthew Modine and
Melanie Griffith like a violin until hope was (almost) lost.
    This is a better movie than "Pacific Heights", which bordered on
absurd.  Some parts of "The Game" was a little far fetched of course
(would firing blanks shatter glass?), but because the performances
were well done (especially Unger as the mystery woman), I overlooked
it. The story kept me interested, including a nice link between
Nicholas and his dad who (told in flashback) committed suicide when he
was 48, and the strained relationship between Nicholas and his
ex-wife, and Nicholas and his brother.
    The best part of the movie is the depiction of the strange
company, CRS.  Its employees are friendly, yet vague and misleading,
leaving a reason for distrust.  There are also some funny moments
involving some fake company names that are obviously a part of CRS. I
couldn't help but grin when Nicholas jumps into a cab only to see the
same exact CRS letters staring him in the face, or when he is chased
by the cable company van, conveniently called "Cable Repair Service".
    This is a good thriller. I cared for the hero and hoped he
survived unscathed. I hoped the hero and the mystery woman would
further their relationship. Do they? I'll let you find out for
yourself.</P>
