<PRE>ANY GIVEN SUNDAY</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Cameron

(novel)</P>
<P>The worlds of professional sports and movies are very similar in a lot
of ways:  both involve spending vast sums of money for the sake of
entertainment; both bring adoration and fame to highly paid, instantly
recognizable stars, and both feature central figures upon whom all the
pressure rests.  When they succeed, they are respected and admired,
sometimes even immortalized.  When they fail, they shoulder the blame
and often lose their jobs.  Whether you call them 'directors' or
'coaches,' their lives are usually summed up, rightly or wrongly, in
terms of their work.  Which brings us to Tony D'Amato, the fictional
football coach and central character in nonfictional director Oliver
Stone's Any Given Sunday.  It's not hard to see why the beleaguered
Stone wanted to do a film about a guy whose passion remains firm despite
being second-guessed, criticized, and told he's washed up.  It's this
passion, both D'Amato's and Stone's, that makes the film worth watching.</P>
<P>D'Amato (Pacino, looking a bit like Pat Riley after a huge loss) is the
coach of the Miami Sharks, a team whose four-game losing skid is
compounded by the injury of star quarterback Jack "Cap" Rooney (Quaid)
just as the playoffs are approaching.  Luckily, third-stringer Willie
Beamen (former sitcom star Foxx) is an undiscovered talent, and he gives
the team a much-needed boost in the late season.  Not so luckily, he's
as mouthy as he is talented, and his public remarks about the team and
particularly D'Amato quickly cause friction as his fame increases.  To
make D'Amato's problems worse, he's got to deal with ice-cold Christina
Pagniacci (Diaz, attacking the role with unsmiling relish), the
win-at-any-cost owner who has inherited the Sharks from her father.  To
her, the players-- and coach-- are mere stocks to be traded away when
their value shows signs of diminishing.  Then there's team doctor Harvey
Mandrake (Woods, in fine snarky form), who uses the players' willingness
to sacrifice their bodies as justification for his lack of medical
ethics.  Worst of all is sportswriter Jack Rose (Stone film regular John
C. McGinley), who attacks D'Amato relentlessly in print and on TV.  If
there were any lingering doubts as to Stone's opinion of critics, they
can now be safely put to rest.</P>
<P>None of these characters are particularly original, and the football
games that drive the plot are no less predictable in their melodramatic,
down-to-the-wire outcomes than any other standard sports-movie fare.
This is not to say that the games aren't exciting to watch.  The camera
pans in blurry zigzags and quick shots of bodies in motion;  linebackers
crouch like hunting tigers, stalking their quarterback prey.  The hits
are huge, bone-crunching affairs punctuated by loud, beat-heavy music.
What really makes Any Given Sunday work, though, are the characteristic
Stone touches:  his fascinating depiction of the machinations behind the
scenes, his lengthy scenes of charged dialogue, and especially his
moralistic approach to the effect of television and big money on
athletes, coaches, and the game itself.  Football players have often
been called modern gladiators; Stone takes the metaphor one step
further, using the famous Ben-Hur chariot race to make his point.  Like
the hapless charioteers who fall and are crushed by their onrushing
rivals, today's pro football players are slaves to the spectacle, meat
for the grinder of televised entertainment.  The only thing the
highlight reels crave more than a Hail Mary pass, Stone points out, is
footage of a player puking or a blown knee.  Even more than Quaid's
aging star quarterback, the tragedy of this fate is embodied in the
character of Luther "Shark" Lavay, who is willing to literally risk his
life for his performance bonus.  Former New York Giants great Lawrence
Taylor gives the role a naturalness and depth of feeling that could only
have come from living it.</P>
<P>Any Given Sunday is both a nostalgic remembrance of professional
football's storied history, and an ultimately optimistic look at how
today's game relates to that tradition.  It may be bigger, richer, and
more slick than ever before, but the love of the game is still the most
important thing.  In that, the worlds of sports and movies are very
similar indeed.</P>
