<PRE>                                    THE CRUCIBLE
                       A film review by Deborah Kelley-Milburn
                        Copyright 1996 Deborah Kelley-Milburn</PRE>
<P>I should begin by stating my prejudices.  "The Crucible" is one of my
favorite plays.  In my opinion  Nicholas Hytner is a gifted director and
Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor alive.  When I discovered that they
were filming "The Crucible" practically in my back yard, I was thrilled,
and I have followed its creation with great interest.  Imagine my delight=

when I was lucky enough to get a ticket for a preview screening last
Thursday.  However, my excitement quickly turned to trepidation.  I'd
heard a lot of Oscar buzz and the production has stellar credentials.
Were my expectations too high?  Would they blow it?  How could any film
live up to such anticipation?  Well, "The Crucible" lives up to the
highest of expectations and then some.  It is brilliant!</P>
<P>As you  probably know from high-school English class,  Arthur Miller wrote
the play in the 1950s when it was interpreted as a thinly veiled allegory
for McCarthyism. But the year is 1692.  A group of teenage girls are
caught dancing in the woods and to escape punishment they begin to cry
witch. One of the girls, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder), has another
motive. She had a brief affair with the upstanding farmer John Proctor
(Daniel Day-Lewis) and she wants to dispose of his wife Elizabeth (Joan
Allen). Magistrates are brought in, lead by Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield)
to ferret out the Devil and hangings begin.  If accused, the only way to
save oneself is by confession.   Then the accusations reach the Proctors'
door...</P>
<P>The screenplay, written by Arthur Miller is very close to the original.
It retains the language and only adds a few scenes not in the play.  Thus
the essence of the play is intact.  Great pains were taken to ensure the
historical accuracy of everything in the film, right down to the actors'
underwear, but this is no historical set piece - you should leave your
high-school English expectations at the door.   Hytner has added a
pulsating, dynamic feeling to the film that carries the audience along
with the principals as they struggle with the exploding hysteria.   Hytner
and Miller aim to transcend  1692, and the 1950s for that matter, and they
succeed.</P>
<P>This film is so good in just about every way that it is hard to single out
specific elements or performances.  All the actors do a superb job, from
Daniel Day-Lewis all the way down.  I was worried that Winona Ryder might
not have the range to handle the role of Abby, but she is excellent.  She
endows Abby with an appropriate complexity.  She is strong, passionate,
intelligent and  - damaged.  In another place and time she might have been
a leader; in this piece she is quite believable as the ring leader of the
hysterical girls.  Then, all you have to do is take one look at Paul
Scofield and you know that he was born to play Judge Danforth.  He  looks
the perfect Puritan and he sounds it, delivering lines such as "And now we
will touch the bottom of this swamp!" just right.</P>
<P>But the film belongs to Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen.    Day-Lewis is
restrained for the first half of the film, conveying in subtle ways John
Proctor's stature in the community.  He projects strength and sexual
magnetism along with the guilt for his sin.  Joan Allen has few lines but
makes the most of them as the wise but worried wife who loves her husband.
At the outset, their marriage is in trouble, and by the end they have
reconciled.  Their scenes together are some of the film's finest,
particularly one stunning scene shot on the beach where they ask each
other for forgiveness.  I had to restrain myself from sobbing; it is
positively heartbreaking, one of the most moving love scenes I have ever
seen.  Together, they create an unforgettable portrait of a marriage.</P>
<P>Miller and Hytner have shrewdly made the Proctors' relationship the
centerpiece of the film.   In doing so, they skillfully blend the personal
and the political.  Like another Day-Lewis film  "In the Name of the
Father" where the father-son relationship grounds the movie, we care very
much what happens to the Proctors.  Thus Hytner and Miller escape the fate
of some "political" dramas such as the recent "Michael Collins" that are
all politics and history without enough emotion.</P>
<P>In fact, all of the characters are multidimensional;  even the accusers
are not painted with a singularly dark brush.  We learn, for example, that
Abigail Williams witnessed the brutal slaying of her parents.  One of the
women who first cries witch, Ann Putnam, is made sympathetic by the
revelation that of her eight children all but one has died.  When her last
child is "afflicted" she is terrified and desperate for an explanation.
Why have all her children been taken from her???  Her fear and rage fuel
her accusations.</P>
<P>I've seen numerous articles which ask how "The Crucible" is relevant
today, focusing on modern day "witch hunts" such as the lurid child sexual
abuse cases. While there is one scene in the film where the girls get down
on their hands and knees and  call for Jesus,  evoking contemporary
evangelical Christianity,  I think to focus on specific parallels misses
the point.  I don't believe Arthur Miller was writing specifically about
anti-communism any more than he was writing specifically about witchcraft.
Rather, "The Crucible" is a chiaroscuro of human nature.  It's about fear,
pain and the need for scapegoats.  It's about corruption and the abuse of
power.  And ultimately it's about morality, justice, righteousness and the
power of truth.</P>
<P>Miller and Hytner have created a timeless modern masterpiece in  "The
Crucible."  It is not to be missed.</P>
