A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Kevin Lima and Chris Buck</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White. Based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs
classic.</PRE>
<P>Starring: the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnel, Glenn
Close, Lance Henriksen, and Wayne Knight</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Orphaned as an infant when his parents died in the African jungle, Tarzan
(voice of Tony Goldwyn) is adopted by the she-ape Kala (voice of Glenn
Close) and raised among apes as her surrogate son. Tarzan becomes adept at
jungle skills, but because of his obvious differences he is not quite
accepted as an ape by his adopted father Kerchak (voice of Lance Henrikson)
and others. When Tarzan stumbles across friendly zoologists Jane Porter
(voice of Minnie Driver) and her father as well as evil poachers he must
decide between his ape responsibilities and the lure of becoming human.
Rosie O'Donnel offers comic relief as Tarzan's buddy Terk, a gorilla with a
New York accent.</P>
<P>Opinion:
This animated gem puts an interesting spin the tale of Edgar Rice
Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes, this time painting a story about earning
acceptance. </P>
<P>Adults will enjoy watch this version of Tarzan because he's not a wimpy,
passive, politically correct hero. With knife in hand, young Tarzan goes
one on one with a killer leopard and roars the Tarzan victory cry. And when
he gets trapped in the hold of a ship, he gets a crazed look in his eye and
begins to exhibit the wildness and claustrophobia of a cornered animal. </P>
<P>On the other hand, children will LOVE this flick because it tells the tale
from a kid's point of view. Here's this young kid Tarzan growing up
slightly hyperactive, trying to come to grips with himself while surrounded
by big adult figures approving and disapproving, encouraging and
discouraging. He surfs down winding branches and careens through the trees
like a monkey to the tune of rhythmic pop music. He faces down danger or
runs away from it. He has exciting adventures and sticks to his values. He
finds his way.</P>
<P>Take the whole family. This one's worth it.</P>
