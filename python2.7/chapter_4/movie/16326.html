<P>Ken Loach's "My Name is Joe" is his greatest film. He has returned to
the gritty world of the earlier "Riff Raff", one hemmed in by poverty,
drug addiction and slum housing. What is different this time is that
he has created characters whose humanity soars above their miserable
settings. Out of the depths of a mean Glasgow neighborhood Loach has
fashioned a love story that is among the greatest I have seen in a
movie. What gives this love story such poignancy is that while wanting
to see it succeed--partly because of the charisma of Joe, the central
character--one can not forget for a moment that it will likely fail
because of the weight of the social conditions.</P>
<P>Joe Kavanagh (Peter Mullan) is a recovering alcoholic on the dole. He
supplements his meager income with an odd job picked up here and
there. His main passion is the soccer team he coaches, which is made
up of losers like him. Not only are some on the dole, they are also
petty thieves and recovering junkies. On the afternoon of a game, he
runs into Sarah (Louise Goodall), a public health social worker out to
visit Liam, one of his players. They argue whether Liam (Davie McKay)
should stay for the interview she has set up with him, his girl-friend
Sabine (Anne-Marie Kennedy) and their young child, or go off with the
team. She is a bit too insistent for Joe and he says that people like
her must think the sun shines out of their arses. Since he says it
with a disarming smile, and since she is a trained social worker used
to working-class resentment, she lets it slide.</P>
<P>Later that day, Joe spots her fumbling with some rolls of wallpaper
that have fallen out of the trunk of her car. He stops his van and
goes up to help her out. He proposes that he and a mate can come round
that weekend and do the job for her, at half the price of a regular
contractor. Even if the sun is shining out of her arse, she asks him
with a smile.</P>
<P>In a classic Loach comic interlude, as Joe and Shanks (Gary Lewis),
his best friend, drive out to Sarah's place to do the job, they fret
over how they've never wall-papered anything in their lives. In
particular they worry if a ceiling has to be wall-papered as part of
the job. Of course when they step foot in the apartment, the camera
reveals a scraped ceiling all set to be papered. Shanks and Joe try to
con her out of doing the ceiling. Who's living upstairs, Shanks asks.
A couple of students, she replies. Ah, that won't be good--students
have parties and the wallpaper won't stand up to the pounding.</P>
<P>In the course of the job, Joe takes a tea break and joins Sarah in the
kitchen. They discover that they share a love for classic
rock-and-roll and quiz each other about who wrote each song that they
sing to each other off-key. By the end of the afternoon, they are
flirting good-naturedly with each other. When Joe and Shanks return
that evening to Joe's place for a game of chess, they discuss the
possibility of Joe taking Sarah out for a date. How much is a dinner
nowadays, ask Joe. When Shanks tells him, Joe just winces. Shanks
suggests a cheap date: why doesn't he take her bowling.</P>
<P>They do go bowling and this is the start of a romance between the two
that is unlike any I have ever seen on the screen. While Joe is
ruggedly handsome, his hair is thinning and there is a suggestion of
the need for some dental work. He is turning thirty-eight and it is
clear that all the years of hard drinking have taken their toll. Sarah
is attractive in an unadorned sort of way, but Joe's passion for her
seems more related to her honesty and warmth than her physical beauty.
In their love-making scenes, there is more chemistry than in all the
Hollywood movies starring Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Val Kilmer and
Julia Roberts put together. The reason for this is that Joe and Sarah
are real people who you can identify with, and real life is much
sexier than the plastic fantasy-world Hollywood specializes in.</P>
<P>In addition to their love, Joe and Sarah share the frustrations of
having to deal with Liam and Sabine, who can barely keep their family
going. He had been released from jail the year before for dealing
drugs and now she has picked up where he has left off. He wants her to
stop dealing, but she needs the money to support her own habit.</P>
<P>Her supplier is a thug named MacGowan (David Hayman), who is always
accompanied by a posse of hulking men in leather coats. Joe used to be
in MacGowan's gang when he was on the booze, but has nothing to do
with him nowadays. Unfortunately, events have conspired to bring them
back together. Sabine owes MacGowan money from drugs she has shot up
instead of selling on the street. He gives Liam a choice. Either
Sabine will go to work as a whore to pay off the debt, or his legs
will be broken. When Joe finds out about this, he goes to MacGowan to
intercede on Liam's behalf. Fine, MacGowan tells him, do a couple of
jobs for me and the debt will be forgiven.</P>
<P>When Joe decides to take up MacGowan's offer, not only does he finds
himself sliding back into his old ways, he discovers that Sarah will
not accept him now that he has become a gangster himself. He tries to
defend himself: in his world, you sometimes have no choice. His plea
falls on deaf ears and Sarah leaves him.</P>
<P>The clash between the hardscrabble world of survival in a Glasgow slum
and the love of a man for a woman, who is not part of that world,
grows out thematically from what some critics would ascribe to Ken
Loach's quaintly old-fashioned notions of what movies should be about.
Rather than making films about monsters set loose on rocket ships, or
love affairs between people who never have to worry about where their
next meal is coming from, Loach pays full attention to the lives of
real people facing real economic hardship.</P>
<P>He is a throwback to the Depression era in many ways. His camera
studies the same landscape of artists like Ben Shahn or novelists like
Henry Roth. As critic David Shapiro points out in the introduction of
his book on social realist art, this school's "only landscapes are at
least partly cityscapes--a decaying mining village, or shacks along
the railroad tracks. A variety of genre painting, Social Realism takes
as its main subject certain significant or dramatic moments in the
lives of ordinary poor people. The moments in their lives selected
(and it is always a moment in someone's life--it is hard to think of
Social Realist painting that does not include a human being) are
almost always those that in some way focus on the indignity or pathos
of their situation--the hard work they perform. the inadequate rewards
they receive for it, or the miserable conditions they work under.
There is almost always, implied or explicit, a criticism made of the
capitalist system."</P>
<P>It is the rest of the movie making industry that is out of touch, when
you stop and think about it. If the purpose of art is to stir our
emotions and make us think about the human condition, Ken Loach is a
bigger success than anybody. There is nothing old-fashioned about a
Ken Loach movie, especially "My Name is Joe," because loneliness and
economic hardship are alas very much still with us.</P>
