<PRE>                             REVIEW: CHAIN REACTION
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>For some reason director Andrew Davis decided to remake his own movie
"The Fugitive" and had the brainstorm to cast Keanu Reeves in the
Harrison Ford role. This must be why he's making the big bucks out in
Hollywood while the rest of us are slaving away for peanuts.</P>
<P>Eddie Kasalivich, a nice Chicago boy genius, is a grad student techie
working on the mysterious Hydrogen Energy Project (mysterious partially
because the science doesn't make much sense) when things start to go a
little wrong. Immediately after they finally get the thing to work, the
chief scientist is murdered and the project blows up, leveling eight
blocks of the Windy City. Of course Eddie is on the run from the FBI
because they think he is selling secrets to whoever our enemy is
nowadays, but it's really the one-armed man...no, wait, that's the other
film.</P>
<P>Blazing through this non-start adventure film, Reeves looks as
uninvolved as possible, which appears to be the extent of his acting
ability. There are a few good scenes -- the explosion in Chicago is well
done, although you've seen that on the previews already -- but most of
the so-called action scenes will leave you begging for less. The ice
boat on the frozen lake sequence is a masterpiece of bad logic,
implausibility and poor cinematography.</P>
<P>As various organizations join the chase, the main theme of the film
becomes which governmental agency is the most evil: the Chicago Cops,
the FBI, the CIA or the CIA Front. Morgan Freeman is the best bad
guy/good guy  (Fred Ward is definitely not Tommy Lee Jones) owing at
least partially to his god-like voice. Although Freeman takes his
character as far as possible, we're just talking a short drive in the
country.</P>
<P>Davis says that the film was made up as they went along. I believe it.
Of all the "Destroy The Cities" films out this summer, this is one that
should have been saved for the late show along with the Godzilla movies.</P>
<P>[This appeared in "The Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana, 8/8/96.
