<PRE>                                 SLEEPER
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1973) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It was easy for me to forget after watching films like 
Crimes and Misdemeanors and Mighty Aphrodite 
that Woody Allen began his career making light-hearted slapstick 
comedies. SLEEPER, the incredibly funny follow-up to BANANAS, 
continues the antics by taking a premise and going seemlessly from 
location to location, uniting all sorts of sitcom-like situations. One 
minute Woody is using a giant inflatable suit to escape from his 
enemies and the next he and Diane Keaton are posing as doctors 
who must perform an operation they know nothing about, a set-up 
that's been used countless times since, most notably in SPIES 
LIKE US and HOUSEGUEST. (I'm not implying there was anything 
notable about the movie HOUSEGUEST.)</P>
<P>        The premise that provides all this has Miles Monroe 
(Allen), owner of the Happy Carrot Health Food Store, being 
thawed out in the year 2173, two hundred years after he went 
into the hospital for a "routine operation." The country has since 
become a police state and the doctors who revive him ask all sorts 
of questions about the long-since forgotten era of history he came 
from.</P>
<P>        For instance, a video clip of Howard Cosell yammering in 
monotone about some sport -- a torture device used on the most 
brutal prisoners? "That's exactly what that was," Allen replies. 
Woody also finds comedy in the doctors' passing revelations that 
the health food he and other people so faithfully devoted themselves 
to was actually destructive to the body. One doctor offers nervous 
Woody a cigarette to calm him down. "Tobacco is one of the 
healthiest substances for the body."</P>
<P>        We soon find out the real reason he was thawed out -- to 
help lead the underground resistance. As the only person alive 
without massive amounts of government data compiled about him, 
he could be invaluable to them. All this comes into play toward the 
end, in a hilarious climax involving the leader's nose, but for most of 
the movie, he's Dr. Woody Kimball, fugitive from the law, running 
and hiding in multiple comedic scenes, many of which offer 
extended silent sequences hearkening back to the silent Chaplin 
and Keaton films.</P>
<P>        And why not? Woody's done his take on almost every 
other era of movie making, from the romances of the 30's (Purple 
Rose of Cairo) to the documentaries of the World War II era 
(ZELIG) and even ancient forms of entertainment like radio (RADIO 
DAYS) and Greek tragedy (MIGHTY APHRODITE). His talent for 
mixing silent slapstick with his hilarious-as-usual one-liners (after 
he is given a pet robot dog as a gift, he asks, "Is this dog 
housebroken or is he going to be leaving little batteries on the 
floor?") makes SLEEPER just one of the many classic films 
Woody Allen has brought us.</P>
