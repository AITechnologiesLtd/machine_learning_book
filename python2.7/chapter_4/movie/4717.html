<P>An old French saying goes: "Within every man, there is a pig  
asleep." "Man" does not refer to humanity, and "pig" does not 
refer to gorging oneself with food. What this means is that 
within every male are dormant,lewd, sexual tendencies. How 
true this may be is not the business of this review, but Billy 
(Mulkey),one of the two male protagonists of "Patti Rocks," 
does support this theory with a vengeance. The swine is not 
simply dozing off in him, it is wide-awake. </P>
<P>Mid-thirtyish Billy works on the river in Minneapolis-St. 
Paul. He is as sex-obsessed a macho compulsive as has ever 
ungraced the screen, and then some. The expression 
"working-class stiff" takes on a new meaning in his case. At 
Christmas time,his latest girlfriend (who lives far away) 
informs him on the phone that she is pregnant. He panics, 
wants to tell her that he is married, with two kids, but he 
lacks the necessary guts. He calls up his former best friend 
Eddie (Jenkins) who is older and a garage supervisor. They had 
not met ever since Eddie had fired Billy. Billy talks his 
reluctant pal into driving with him to the city where Patti 
(Landry,Mulkey's wife at the time of filming) lives and  
somehow help him break the news to her and talk her into an 
abortion. </P>
<P>The drive through a bleak Midwestern landscape takes up much 
of the movie. The two men are skillfully photographed and 
recorded in a moving car as they talk and talk and talk,  
exclusively about sex. The car becomes like a barracks plus a 
locker-room on wheels as Billy, guzzling beer and tossing the 
empty cans on the back seat, delivers a non-stop commentary on 
his urges, accomplishments, and nauseating notions about 
women. His exploits may be in part fantasies, but the language 
is very real. Even by low-life standards, it  breaks records 
for grossness, foulness, scatology, pathological male 
chauvinism and misogyny. Eddie shares the drinking and  
supplies the amen-type reactions. But he laughs so much and so 
loudly that we suspect he is unconvinced by his friend's  
notions,lifestyle and verbal excesses. Indeed,Eddie, a rather 
gentle and sad-looking man whose wife left him, has his own 
problems. At one point he refuses to stay on the trip. </P>
<P>The  long ride is interrupted by an encounter with a skunk. 
This forces Billy to throw away his pants and undershorts and 
to borrow Eddie's shorts, which he will wear, trouserless in 
the snow (mercifully the winter is  mild) to the end of the 
film. There's also a very crude -- and funny -- encounter with 
a faded prostitute who challenges Billy to prove his  phallic 
boasts. </P>
<P>Up to now, much of what's happening  may seem  pointless. In 
fact, the first meeting between the two men made me think that 
there was a homosexual subplot somewhere, an impression 
reinforced by Eddie's looks and manner. When this turned out 
to be a wrong lead,"Patti Rocks" felt like a movie trying to 
get out of a non-plot. Yet when the two men reach Patti's 
place, you realize that the film had already emerged, that 
what seemed to be a protracted overture was actually Part One 
of Two. </P>
<P>Patti turns out to be a surprise, a human being and not, as  
advertised by Billy, merely a piece of you-know-what.   
Neither a floozy nor a romantic heroine, she is sensible, 
self-controlled, natural, and in her simple way, likable. She 
may be a sucker for Billy as a bedmate, but she has realism, 
allies resilience with compassion and a kind of proletarian 
generosity. She has decided to have the child, and laughs at  
Billy's menace of suing her "for theft of semen." When Eddie, 
urged on by his friend, goes into her bedroom to tell her 
about Billy being married -- which Patti calmly suspected all 
along -- a bond of sympathy born of newly revealed   
sensibilities is formed between those two. It leads to some 
sweet, pathetic love-making, then to a temporary outburst by 
Billy, followed by a friendly breakfast "a trois," where Billy 
gets maudlin with the photos of his kids. It also leads  to 
Patti's friendly dismissal of Billy. Eddie, long womanless and 
affectionless, may  have started a new relationship.  </P>
<P>As both men ride back to the Twin Cities, the unreconstructed  
Billy, always seeing himself as God's gift to women, explains 
that the ideal would be pay-as-you-go sex. Without 
complications or commitments, he can get the flesh he needs 
the way you shop for beef in a supermarket. </P>
<P>It goes without saying that "Patti Rocks" is not for all 
audiences, or even for most. Billy's disgusting language and 
"philosophy" ("it's a man's world, baby" is the mildest thing 
he says) make it a turn-off. But if an amply forewarned viewer 
does watch this film and does not walk out prematurely, a 
great deal of truth surfaces: about men, women and male-female 
relations; about loneliness, incommunicability;  above all the 
violent reaction of men scared by women as equals. </P>
<P>Truth is not beauty here. Billy seems aberrant, even by 
extreme standards, yet a nagging suspicion remains that behind 
the exaggerations the characters essentially  represent 
attitudes that are far from unusual. </P>
<P>This is a maverick movie that cannot be judged by ordinary 
screen standards. Interestingly, this work where women get so 
very demeaned and verbally mauled, ends up as an oddly 
feminist film. </P>
<P>Most of the time the acting is very  convincing, as if the 
players were behaving rather than performing, and we were 
observing them voyeuristically with a hidden camera. In fact, 
the three  actors and the director built this film on 
improvisations. Filmically there is a questionable area 
though, as  Billy is too much of a dumb jerk to make his 
relationship with either Eddie or Patti really credible. </P>
<P>Director Morris is the Minneapolis independent who made "Loose 
Ends" in 1975. "Patti Rocks" is a sequel. This explains the 
"12 Years Later" mention at the film's start.  "Loose Ends" 
starred the same men as "Patti." It was written by Victoria 
Wozniak, who became, then unbecame, Morris's wife. By 
"Patti"'s release, everyone was on a second or third marriage. 
This somehow adds to the film a lot of veracity -- and not 
much hope.</P>
<P>"Patti" was made for only $350,000, a pittance, but one that's 
just right for the subject. The problem was with the original 
rating, an X given for its piled-up verbal obscenities. Upon 
appeal it was changed to an R, a very strong R no doubt, yet 
one that goes naturally with a picture that should perhaps be 
placed in a time-capsule, so that beings of the future can 
find out how a certain segment of our population sounded and 
behaved in the late 1980s, if not also before and after. </P>
