"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Former Japanese game-show host Takeshi `Beat' Kitano wrote, directed and
stars in this flawless follow-up to his critically acclaimed Fireworks
(Hana Bi).  Fans of Kitano's previous work may be surprised that there
are no bloody shoot-outs between cops and Yakuza gang members in this
film - Kikujiro is a surprisingly touching yet achingly hysterical story
about a kid that spends his summer vacation searching for his mother
with the help of a two-bit hoodlum.</P>
<P>Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi, in his screen debut) is a nine-year-old boy
that lives with his grandmother (Kazuko Yoshiyuki, Fireworks) but longs
to see the mother that he has never known (he is told that she is busy
working in another city and that his father is dead).  Armed only with
an address and a photograph, Masao plans to make the journey on his own,
but ends up being escorted by his neighbor, the lazy, cantankerous
Kikujiro Takeda (brilliantly played by Kitano) after his no-nonsense
wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) orders him to accompany the boy.</P>
<P>What unfolds is basically a road movie where the two characters learn
that they really have more in common than they thought.  At one point,
they even buy matching Hawaiian shirts, so you can think of Kikujiro as
a cross between Planes, Trains & Automobiles and Twins.  Kikujiro stars
out hating the youngster, making Masao stand outside a restaurant while
he eats comfortably inside.  Then he blows all of Masao's money at the
track, causing the rest of the journey to be a little `bare-boned.'</P>
<P>There's a bit of a surprise when the two weary travelers finally arrive
at their destination, and Kikujiro spends the rest of the film trying to
salvage Masao's school break.  To say that this is accomplished via two
bikers and several comedic skits (complete with makeup and costumes)
probably wouldn't make much sense, so I'm not even going to get into
that here.  I will say that Kikujiro has a lot of funny and insulting
lines that he gets to hurl at just about everybody in sight. `Joker,'
`Baldy,' `Brat,' and `Smart Aleck,' are among his favorites, while the
memorable line, `Dummy, you're no genius,' may have lost something
during the translation into English.</P>
<P>Kikujiro is told mainly though flashbacks using Masao's `How I Spent My
Summer Vacation' school project to title the different segments of the
film (with uproarious names like `Mister is Crazy,' `It Didn't Work
Out,' and `Mister Fell Down Stairs').  The film effortlessly floats
between slapstick and heart-tugging drama, and if this project was about
the Holocaust and had Miramax's publicity juggernaut behind it, Kitano
would probably be a Benigni-esque triple Oscar nominee next spring.</P>
<P>2:02 – for cartoon-like violence and some mild adult language</P>
