<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>To many fans of modern cinema, the name Kenneth
Branagh is synonymous with Shakespeare, and rightly
so.  He has adapted the Bard's work in the films
`Henry V', `Much Ado About Nothing' and `Hamlet'
(which is widely considered to be the finest of many
film versions of the play), and enjoyed major success
with each.  His devotees claim that Branagh is the
only working filmmaker who truly understands
Shakespeare, presenting it in a form that is
simultaneously creative and faithful.  I wonder what
those folks will think of his latest foray into the
Bard's creative genius, the amusing yet forgettable
musical treatment of `Love's Labour's Lost'.<p></P>
<P>Shakespeare's play has been moved to the 1930's, on
the heels of World War II, in fair Navarre.  Four
eligible bachelors, Berowne (Kenneth Branagh), Dumaine
(Adrian Lester), Longeville (Matthew Lillard) and the
King himself (Alessandro Nivola) have sworn off women
and fine food in order to devote three years to the
study of philosophy.  But a diplomatic visit from the
Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her three
beautiful attendants soon attempts to disprove the
men's belief that they can live without love.</P>
<P>Each man, unbeknownst to the others, carefully breaks
the pact and woos one of the women, setting off some
genuinely Shakespearean wordplay and visual comedy. 
The main difference is that, in this production, the
characters break into song at random moments of glee. </P>
<P>Branagh's decision, to make `Love's Labour's Lost' in
the style of a 1930's musical (with classic songs by
George Gershwin and Irving Berlin), is surely a
welcome one, considering the lowly status of the
modern movie musical.  However, while the choreography
and singing are top-notch (all the actors recorded the
songs using their own voices, and did all the dancing
as well), only a couple of the musical interludes add
to the story.  It is as if the characters are so bored
with the material that they choose their own agenda.</P>
<P>This we should be thankful for, as the dramatic side
of Branagh's film is underdeveloped.  Shakespeare's
characters often referred to women as the `weaker
vessels', and this production does little to disprove
that theory.  Alicia Silverstone, attempting some kind
of dramatic comeback, is severely miscast, showing
Valley-girl type problems with her lines, and her
three female companions fail to make any kind of
impression.  As a result, parts of the 95-minute
running time drag, since the romance in `Love' is
what's truly lost.</P>
<P>However, this comedy still has a lot going for it. 
The story is lighter than a feather, and the film's
all-around joyfulness makes it a breath of fresh air,
especially in the wake of recent angst-ridden Bard
adaptations like Michael Almereyda's Gen-X `Hamlet'. 
Also, while `Love's Labour's Lost' retains much of
Shakespeare's original language, it is relatively
easy-to-follow and enjoy, the story being as
straightforward as it is.</P>
<P>Kenneth Branagh's `Love's Labour's Lost' is certainly
an intriguing project; one that refreshingly lacks the
cynicism found in his earlier films.  Sadly, though,
it will not reinvent the movie musical, nor
reinvigorate the work of Shakespeare.  However, it's
still more fun than you're likely to find in the
multiplex.   </P>
