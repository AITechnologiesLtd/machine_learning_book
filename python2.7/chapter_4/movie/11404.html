<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        For three and a half years, I've been saying, "What's the big deal
about The Fugitive?"  I never really knew.  Now that I've seen U.S.
Marshals, I think I finally understand.  I can't fathom why the
Kopelsons chose this complicated, convoluted, and often strikingly
uninteresting script to carry the sequel to one of 1994's biggest
films.  This is a long film, and it doesn't need to be.  There are a lot
of characters, and there don't have to be.  On top of all this, the
basic framework for U.S. Marshals is basically identical to that of The
Fugitive, which takes the film dangerously close to the level of
"rip-off" rather than "sequel."</P>
<P>        One of the seventeen main characters is Sheridan, played by Wesley
Snipes.  He is a tow truck driver, but only in the beginning.  Later, he
is arrested and charged with the murder of two secret agents.  So, he
gets stuck on a plane.  Conveniently, U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee
Jones) is also on that plane, but because of another prisoner that he
captured in the obligatory introduction-action sequence (the one that
shows us our hero doing his best).  </P>
<P>        The plane crashes.  Sheridan escapes.  Gerard is allowed to say his
line from the first film:  "We've got a fugitive!"  This is about thirty
minutes into the story.  Sequences shortly after this take place in a
swamp, and there are moments when Sheridan takes people hostage while
Gerard has him at gun point and could just shoot him in the face without
harming anyone.  </P>
<P>        We learn of new characters.  Robert Downey, Jr. plays agent John Royce
who is forced into Gerard's team despite Gerard's protest.  This leads
to an involvement with Royce's employers, who turn out to be somehow
related to Sheridan, and this opens up a subplot involving a murderous
Chinese diplomat.  Oh, and let's not forget the other U.S. Marshals, for
whom the film is named:  Joe Pantoliano, whom I like, reprises his role
from the first film; there are, in actuality, about five Marshals in the
film, and all of them are given too much screen time for me to have not
remembered their names just one day later.</P>
<P>        Sheridan has a girlfriend, Marie.  Marie is played by the wonderful
Irene Jacob.  I'm not sure why the character is in the film, though, and
Jacob's considerable talent is wasted (though she does make her scenes
easy on the eyes).  </P>
<P>        U.S. Marshals didn't strike me as a goofy movie as I watched it, but I
think of it that way in retrospect.  The story is silly and complicated
for no reason.  It's not even very plausible.  Not only that, but the
makers don't trust the audience:  when Gerard makes an important
revelation towards the end of the film, we are force-fed a flashback of
an earlier scene in the film that provides information needed to solve
the puzzle.  </P>
<P>        The action sequences are good.  I liked the scenes taking place in a
home for old folks, and that sequence culminates with a leap, from a
roof onto a train, that is truly spectacular (although you can see that
in the preview).  I also liked the acting.  Jones is charismatic and
continues in the manner than got him an Oscar for the same role in the
earlier film.  Snipes makes a good hero, although our sympathy is torn
because his character is too complicated for easy audience involvement. 
The other Marshals are all nice, and the bad guys are adequately bad,
but everything here tastes a little too familiar.</P>
<P>        Harrison Ford is basically what makes The Fugitive a good movie.  He
played a nice, normal guy (I even remember his character's name, and I
haven't seen the film in years) with whom everyone can identify.  We
really wanted to see him succeed.  But Sheridan is a special forces
agent--there is really no suspense in his situation, and almost no
payoff in the conclusion.  And, by the end of the film, director Stuart
Baird has truly lost sight of what the film is--and should--be about: 
Gerard chases Sheridan.</P>
<P>        This isn't a terrible or even extremely mediocre film.  As a strict
action film, this one has good acting and nice set-pieces.  But what
about the story?  What about the involving characters that made the
original film a satisfying and entertaining picture?  That's what got
lost in this sequel.  U.S. Marshals has too much plot on which it must
focus, and ends up flailing wildly and not really getting anywhere.</P>
