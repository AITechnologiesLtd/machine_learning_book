<P>Harmless, silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans Gordie
and Sean (David Arquette and Scott Caan) who idolize current World
Championship Wrestling heavyweight champion Jimmy King (Oliver Platt). 
When King is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter (Joe
Pantoliano), Gordie and Sean take it upon themselves to find their
fallen hero and restore his glory.</P>
<P>My biggest fear about Ready to Rumble was dispatched early on, as the
filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed (but
not fake, mind you).  The hook of the movie is that Gordie and Sean are
just TOO stupid to realize that.</P>
<P>Arquette and Caan are suitably over the top with their performances,
which is exactly what a movie like this requires, and Oliver Platt (one
of my favorite actors) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion. 
Many have scoffed at the idea that Platt should be playing a heavyweight
champion wrestler with an unbeaten record, but for me it just added to
the "silly factor" of the film, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it. 
One casting complaint however: Rose McGowan as a sexy dancer?  Please...
if Rose McGowan is sexy then I'm Marilyn Manson.</P>
<P>Given the current state of the actual WCW, if Oliver Platt were
appearing as Jimmy King right now on WCW programming, he'd be the most
popular guy they have.  On a similar note, the "plot line" of the
wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the
WCW writers have been able to come up with in the last two years. 
Although one does have to ask... why would any wrestling promoter fire
the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely
popular with the fans?</P>
<P>Director Brian Robbins (you'll remember him as Eric from TV's "Head of
the Class") just knows how to make good dumb movies.  This movie fits in
nicely with his previous efforts Good Burger and Varsity Blues.  And
screenwriter Steven Brill (the epic Mighty Ducks trilogy, Late Last
Night) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same
time, with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me. 
The only exceptions to that were: 1) a scene involving a van full of
singing nuns and 2) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan. 
Those moments made me cringe and/or groan.  As an added bonus though,
the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits
roll.  [PG-13]</P>
