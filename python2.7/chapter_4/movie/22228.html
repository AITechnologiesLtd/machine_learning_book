<P>   Given the concern of the Catholic church to movies it
believes defamatory such as "Stigmata" and "Dogma," the big
surprise is that no pickets have been thrown outside
screenings of "The Cider House Rules." The book by John
Irving, wonderfully adapted to the screen by the author
himself under the direction of Swedish helmer Lasse
Hallstrom, makes a clear statement in favor of a woman's
right to choose.  The principal performer, who has been
coached by an experienced physician in the art of delivering
babies, refuses on moral grounds to join his mentor in
aborting fetuses of women who ask him to do so.  Yet he
sees the light later on and freely helps a woman who is the
victim of incest and who is desperate to end her
two-months'-old pregnancy.</P>
<P>   The film is only peripherally about abortion and is in no
way designed as a clever masquerade for pro-choice
propaganda.  John Irving's screenplay--which condenses his
massive book's study of 15 years in the life of a man into just
one and one-half--is a coming of age drama in the best sense
of the term.  Devoid of sticky sentimentality and utilizing
cutesy images sparingly, this 131-minute film features
ensemble work of high order particularly from Michael Caine
(once accused of a willingness to make just about any movie
for money) and from Tobey Maguire as a lad who needs to
break out of an insular, though happy, environment to find out
who he really is.  Box office can hardly be damaged by the
presence of the dazzling Charlize Theron, perhaps the most
attractive young actress in the business, who shows this time
that being an astronaut's wife earlier this year was simply a
redeemable error.</P>
<P>   Opening in St. Clouds, Maine, during the mid-1940s shortly
after America's entry into war, the story focuses on an
orphanage run by the good-hearted Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael
Caine), who not only delivers babies from women who do not
want them but takes the infants into his friendly institution
until they can become adopted.  Though this is no Dickensian
establishment--Dr. Larch shows movies, reads to the kids at
bedtime, and wishes good night in an authentic New England
accent to "you princes of Maine, you kings of New
England--the tots are nonetheless eager to be adopted.  They
paste on their most adorable expressions when would-be
parents come to look them over.  The doctor's favorite,
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), is twice adopted and twice
returned, but Larch takes him under his wing and, as the boy
matures, he is taught how to deliver babies though the lad
has never been even to high school.  </P>
<P>   While Homer is understandably the happiest of the
orphanage's inmates, he has not been out of Maine nor
has he seen the ocean. Impulsively he quits the
establishment and hitches a ride with a soldier, Wally
Worthington (Paul Rudd), and his girl friend Candy Kendall
(Charlize Theron), and takes a job picking apples at Candy's
mother's place where he befriends a group of migrant
workers under the supervision of Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo). 
Two dramatic occurrence are to change Homer's life: his
intensifying relationship with Candy after Wally departs for
service in Burma; and his dilemma when a victim of incest
asks him to perform an abortion.  Not until Homer confronts
the prospective father--who, like Ray Winsome's character in
Tim Roth's searing "The War Zone" becomes incensed with
the accusation--does director Hallstrom kick in with the story's
melodramatic flourishes.</P>
<P>   Homer learns that he is not the only person faced with
making big decisions with his life.  Candy, who has fallen in
love with him, must decide what she will do when her boy
friend comes home from the war.  Rose (Erykah Badu), who
is the victim of incest, must overcome her reluctance to make
a decision about her pregnancy.  Her dad must face up to his
responsibility and determine a course of action for himself. 
Ultimately, Homer has seen enough of life to make a
decision about his own future.</P>
<P>   Curiously enough, the film--which is a winning one in all
respects--does not become more involving once the conflicts
go into high gear.  Its most pleasurable aspects for the
viewer are taking in the gorgeous autumnal atmosphere of
Maine (actually filmed in Massachusetts), gazing at the
exceptional beauty of Charlize Theron, and observing the
interplay between Dr. Larch, a childless father to a band of
lovely youngsters, and his protege, the impressionable and
wholesome Homer.  Coincidentally, Tobey Maguire, in a lead
role in Ang Lee's "Ride with the Devil," connects with an
actress who is primarily a singer (Jewel) while in "Cider
House Rules" he plays adviser to still another performer who
is known principally as a vocalist (Erykah Badu).  The title
comes from a list of regulations posted in the apple orchard,
rules that are not made up by the migrants who must follow
them and who therefore do not feel compelled to obey them.
Presumably, this serves as metaphor for Homer's situation:
as a disciple of Dr. Larch, he must go by the rules which an
outside force imposes on him.  Not until he finds his own way
can Homer truly comply with more authentic directives--which
must come from his own head.  John Irving's book about the
need for family and purpose fits perfectly on the screen.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 131 minutes.  (C) 1999
