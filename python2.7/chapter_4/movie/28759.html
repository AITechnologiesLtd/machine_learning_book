<PRE>SMELL OF CAMPHOR, FRAGRANCE OF JASMINE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Bahman Farmanara's SMELL OF CAMPHOR, FRAGRANCE OF JASMINE, tells the 
story of an aging filmmaker, Bahman Farjami (Bahman Farmanara), who for 
20 years has been forbidden by the Iranian government from making films.  
Described by some as an Iranian Woody Allen, Farmanara is more of a 
poignantly tragic comedian.  When Farjami confronts life's insults, from 
a doctor who wants him to eat only things that taste bad to his own 
grave plot being sold before he take up residence, his reaction is 
palpable injury, shown more in the scowl on his face than in his words.  
Farmanara gives the story's best line, "Abstinence is the best diet," 
not to himself, but to a minor character, Farjami's doctor.  With its 
references to Poe and Dickens, this slice of the end of a man's life 
strikes universal themes.  As you might guess, the film has certain 
autobiographical elements in that Farmanara was himself kept for 20 
years from making films.</P>
<P>SMELL OF CAMPHOR, FRAGRANCE OF JASMINE runs 1:33.  The film is in 
Persian with English subtitles.  It is not rated but might be PG for 
mature themes.</P>
