<PRE>                                    BANDIT QUEEN
                       A film review by S. Ananthasubramanian
                        Copyright 1996 S. Ananthasubramanian</PRE>
<P>Shekar Kapoor's Bandit Queen is not an entertaining movie. It is made 
with the sole purpose of making us realize the atrocities done to lower 
caste people, especially women, in India. It is the real story of a woman 
who lead a group of bandits in the late seventies in India. </P>
<P>Peppering the scenes with foul language and without a single known actor or 
actress in the movie, the director manages to create realistic and brutal 
characters and tear your heart apart. In the end, he makes us wonder 
whether there is anything to be happy about being an Indian.</P>
<P>The movie begins with a quote from Manusmrithi(an ancient book on social 
values in India) that equates the women, the uneducated and the 
lowercaste people to cattle and justifies beating them 
for making them obey.</P>
<P>The early parts of the movie deal with Phoolan's marriage when she is a 
kid. Sold by her father to a man thrice her age for a cycle, a cow and 
Rs.100 ($3.00) the 11 year old Phoolan is beaten and sexually assaulted, 
which damages her personality completely. The film crew, with their 
artistic and candid work, take you to dry, poverty ridden villages of Madhya 
Pradesh ( a poor state in central India). This part ends with helpless cries 
from the kid that fill your ears and pain that fills your heart.</P>
<P>A teenage Phoolan is branded a hooker by the village when she refuses to 
comply to the sexual advances of a young Thakur. As the story goes 
on Phoolan is kidnapped by a group of gangsters whose leader takes 
pleasure in raping her day in and day out. Now, coming to the 
picturization of these rape scenes, Shekar Kapoor has taken Indian cinema 
to the next level. </P>
<P>So far rape in Indian movies has been portrayed in only two ways, either 
in a symbolic way or as a cheap substitute for love making scenes. Showing a 
painting  of a tiger feasting over a deer or a flower burning in the oven 
with appropriate music has been enough for Indian film fans to understand 
the happenings on the screen. The pictures made with cheap actors and
advertised with obvious posters, which have rape scenes with erotic music 
and obscene images to satisfy the front bencher, make up the second category.</P>
<P>In B.Q., as in real life, rape is painful, vulgar, repulsive and an 
expression of the beast inside every man. Phoolan's voice filled with pain 
is heard initially, and as the camera moves in, one can see the most 
obscene and hurting image ever shown on Indian screens. The semi-naked 
rapist lying over Phoolan goes on raping her violently as we remain 
helpless and bewildered. After Phoolan is rescued from  her tormenter by 
the smart Vikram Mallah, another gangster, Shekar Kapoor  portrays the 
affair that develops between these two with equal vigor. Their 
relationship is short lived, as everything in Phoolan's life is.</P>
<P>Once Vikram is killed by another gangster, Sriram, she is taken away by  
Sriram's gang. All the 16 members of this gang rape her one after the 
other. After  this, she is paraded naked in the streets of Behmai as the 
whole village  watches on. Though there is a very strong possibility for 
this scene to get censored in India, there is nothing cheap or vulgar 
about this when you see it on screen. In an industry set up where, 
"double-meaning" lyrics and dance movements with obvious messages are 
shot for the mainstream cinema, an anti-Bollywood (Bollywood - the 
heart of film production in India) scene like this, which 
does not portray woman as a sexual object, is sure to evoke flames. As 
Phoolan is "punished" for not behaving like a lowercaste woman the 
biased social set up in India looms large in our minds. </P>
<P>Coming out of such a nasty experience is not easy. Phoolan manages to and 
takes the gun in her arms. Even now, no move by the director justifies 
her taking the law in her hands. Most importantly, you don't see action 
packed scenes for clapping or whistling. The director is just a narrator 
and thankfully he hasn't brought in commercial elements to hinder the 
flow of the story. The rise and fall of Phoolan as the bandit queen and her 
eventual surrender are shown with equal sincerity.</P>
<P>Seema Biswas in the title role gives a very powerful and memorable 
performance that is sure to fetch her critical acclaim and numerous awards.
With her ordinary looks she may not make it big in mainstream cinema, 
but, this is what they call, "role of a life time". She's definitely 
given her best and that is more than enough.</P>
<P>Fateh Ali Khan's (remember the voice in Oliver Stone's "Natural born 
Killers" ?) music adds depth and soul, thankfully not color, to the images. </P>
<P>A very strong heart is a must for watching this film. Accepting the 
negative points of our society needs a much stronger one. If our society 
is/was half as bad the one portrayed in this movie then there is no point 
in being proud about our social set up.</P>
<P>Reports say that this is one of the biggest box office hits of the year 
in India. Let's hope its an eye opener to those who breed social injustice.<HR>Sivakumar Ananthasubramanian
