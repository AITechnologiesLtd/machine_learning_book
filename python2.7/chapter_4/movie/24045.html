<P>"28 Days" would like to be an honest portrayal of a person attempting to 
rehabilitate from an alcoholic pill-popper to someone who is able to live a 
normal life, but it simply isn't. With themes similar to that of 1988's 
"Clean and Sober" and 1994's "When a Man Loves a Woman" (with a remarkable 
performance by Meg Ryan), "28 Days" is the black sheep of the trio--a sketchy 
and predictable dramedy with little insight or intelligence, and a story 
outline that is merely skin-deep. Welcome to planet Hollywood!</P>
<P>For the past fifteen years, Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) has lived her life 
in the fast lane, speeding along from one drink and pill, from one party and 
bedroom romp, to the next, without any clear destination as to where her life 
is headed. After yet another round of late-night partying, Gwen awakens with 
her equally troubled boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) only to realize that it 
is the wedding day of her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins), and she is 
already late. Making a scene at the reception (where she arrives drunk), Gwen 
accidentally falls into the wedding cake and, following a car accident in 
which she drives into a home while trying to find a cake store, is 
immediately sent to Serenity Glen Rehab Center, where she is to serve 28 
days. </P>
<P>At first, Gwen refuses to admit she even has a problem, and finds it 
difficult to believe she is like her fellow drug patients, including her 
teenaged, heroin-and-soap-opera-addicted roommate, Andrea (Azura Skye); a 
divorced mother (Marianne Jean-Baptiste); and a light-hearted gay dancer 
(Alan Tudyk). But the more difficulty she has sustaining an abruptly sober 
life, and the more she flashes back to her childhood when she was living with 
her now-deceased alcoholic mother, Gwen realizes the discouraging footsteps 
in which she has followed thus far in her adult life. It's time to set things 
straight, for once, she believes, and that includes getting off drugs, 
mending her rocky relationship with her sister, and dealing maturely with her 
boyfriend, whom she cares about but knows is not the best influence for her.</P>
<P>Written by Susannah Grant, the mastermind also behind this season's biggest 
hit, "Erin Brockovich," "28 Days" is a sloppily made motion picture with nary 
the depth nor the realism to be a truly powerful or even memorable 
experience. Quickly moving from one scene to the next, none of the supporting 
characters are given the space or time to break free of their one-note, 
stereotypical roles, while the workings of the plot fail to overcome its 
cliches. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Sandra Bullock remains in the forefront from the first scene to 
the last, and she is her usual good self, but in a decidedly less glamorous 
role this time, respectively. Bullock injects the flawed Gwen as a likable 
character, even when she is being reckless, since we realize that she is a 
woman with a great deal of problems, both exterior and interior, that 
decisively need to be worked out.</P>
<P>Surrounding Bullock are a parade of stock characters, with only Elizabeth 
Perkins, as Bullock's fed-up sister, and Azura Skye, as Bullock's troubled 
roommate, particularly standing out in effective performances that are given 
more than a few fleeting moments of screen time. Late in the picture, hints 
of a romance are brought up involving Gwen and a new patient, the ruggedly 
handsome alcoholic baseball player Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), but there is 
little chemistry between the two, and even less interest in them within 
Grant's oversimplified screenplay, which basically disregards the subplot 
before the silly conclusion.</P>
<P>"28 Days" may be a so-called "feel-good" comedy-drama, but it is rarely 
funny, and its emotions, which thankfully never go overboard in the schmaltz 
department, nevertheless neglect to exude much tangible feeling. Alcoholism 
and drug abuse are serious diseases that are never solved or overcame; 
instead, they are life-long battles that rely on willpower and the amount of 
desire a person has to stay clean. The recovery process, as delineated here, 
is a relatively easy and sugarcoated one, at a loss for any signs of 
authenticity. The final minutes of "28 Days" particularly fail to do this 
idea legitimate justice, as we are led to believe Gwen has, once and for all, 
gotten her priorities in order, and will never go back to drinking. Maybe she 
will, and maybe she won't; who knows? Sigh...if only the big L (as in 
L-I-F-E) was really so simple.</P>
