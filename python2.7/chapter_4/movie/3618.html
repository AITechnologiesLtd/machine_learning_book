<P>     FORGET PARIS has a split personality.  It's not the mixture of 
comedy and drama--plenty of films manage to intertwine the two with 
aplomb; rather, it's the vastly different performance levels of the 
leads.  Debra Winger, a mature and competent actress, has developed a 
dramatic style that she uses to good effect.  Billy Crystal, on the 
other hand, is his usual character:  self-deprecating, glib, and 
entirely unconvincing in scenes requiring emotional displays.  Put 
simply, when Winger shines, Crystal is awful, and when Crystal is at his 
best, Winger fades into the background.  The most apparent result is 
that the characters never really connect. </P>
<P>     Taken together, MR. SATURDAY NIGHT and FORGET PARIS offer 
compelling evidence that Crystal in his capacity as director/actor 
should stay away from films that require dramatic range.  The man is 
more of a personality than a performer.  He writes good jokes and has a 
funny delivery.  In this film, his best moments occur when he's trying 
to make the audience laugh.  His take on "The Phantom of the Opera" and 
his scenes with William Hickey are examples of the comic in top form.   </P>
<P>     FORGET PARIS comes from the ANNIE HALL school of chronicling the 
development and disintegration of a relationship.  The script, however, 
goes for slick one-liners in place of Woody Allen's insight, and the 
ending lacks emotional honesty.  But what else have we come to expect 
from Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, kings of the happy ending?  These 
two dribble so much honey on every screenplay they touch that it's a 
wonder audiences haven't gone into sugar shock. </P>
<P>     Debra Winger plays Ellen Andrews, an airline customer relations 
executive in Paris.  She meets Mickey Gordon (Crystal) when the airline 
loses the body of his father, who was being transported to France for 
burial.  After the funeral, the pair spend some time sightseeing and 
falling in love.  Alas, after a week, Mickey must return to the United 
States:  he's an NBA referee and the season's about to start.  He and 
Ellen continue their relationship long-distance, each pining for the 
other during the separation.  Eventually, Mickey hops on a flight to 
France and surprises Ellen with a marriage proposal--which, for 
reasons she explains, she is unable to accept.  But even this unexpected 
turn of events can't break the lovers apart. </P>
<P>     Mickey and Ellen's story is narrated by several of the couple's 
close friends (played by Joe Mantegna, Julie Kavner, Richard Masur, John 
Spencer, and Cathy Moriarty).  This is one of those rare occasions when 
voiceovers actually work--they allow for moments of comic flair to 
punctuate a story that often gets too sentimental.  Unfortunately, this 
also means that a fine supporting cast gets very little screen time. </P>
<P>     Presumably, Crystal is attempting to provide a romantic alternative 
to the early summer action blockbusters (CRIMSON TIDE, DIE HARD WITH A 
VENGEANCE, etc.).  If so, he's missed the mark.  With its uneven tone, 
FORGET PARIS doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse 
its faults.  Crystal and Winger don't make a vibrant couple, and the 
various tribulations in their characters' relationship seem like 
episodes designed to set up the "wonderful" ending.  In his second 
directorial stint, Crystal has repeated most of the faults of his first 
(the aforementioned MR. SATURDAY NIGHT).  At least this time, we don't 
have to endure the terrible old-age makeup on top of everything else. </P>
