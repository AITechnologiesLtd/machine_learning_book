<PRE>SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>With hundreds of sonnets, comedies, tragedies, and patriotic histories 
to his name, William Shakespeare seems an unlikely candidate for 
writer's block.  But that's the conundrum facing the illustrious Bard at 
the outset of "Shakespeare in Love," a deliciously witty and inventive 
comedy drama that reminds us once again of the true genius of England's 
greatest writer.</P>
<P>London, 1593, and Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes, no doubt sick of 
being referred to as "Ralph's little brother") is struggling with his 
latest play.  He needs inspiration in the form of a muse and finds it in 
Viola De Lesseps (a radiant Gwyneth Paltrow), who auditions for the male 
lead (since women weren't allowed on stage in Elizabethan England).  It 
isn't long before Viola, still in drag, starts canoodling in the wings 
with the smitten playwright.</P>
<P>Unfortunately Viola is to be wed this fortnight to the odious Lord 
Wessex (Colin Firth), which puts a bit of a crimp in our heroes' 
romantic future.</P>
<P>It goes without saying that this is a purely invented account of what 
inspired Will to write "Romeo and Juliet" (working title: "Romeo and 
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"), but it's absolutely credible and great 
fun in what it supposes.  Like any good Shakespearean work, "Shakespeare 
in Love" is filled with love, sex, villainy, despair, tears, sword 
fights, men dressed as women, women dressed as men, buffoonery, ribald 
humor, intimidating penmanship...and a dog!</P>
<P>Writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard (who's been down a similar road 
before with "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead") take great delight 
in mirroring the diction, the meter, and the sentiment of Shakespeare's 
English.  Their screenplay is punctuated with earnest soliloquies, 
anachronistic asides and, most effectively, the kind of adult humor 
missing from so many mainstream scripts.  Where else but in "Shakespeare 
in Love" might you find "But, soft! what light through yonder window 
breaks?" within spitting distance of "for sixpence a line I'd cause a 
riot in a nunnery."</P>
<P>As sophisticated as the writing is, it's not the be all and end all of 
the piece.  "Shakespeare in Love" is a real team effort, from the fine 
direction of John Madden ("Mrs. Brown") to a superlative cast.  
"Shine"'s Geoffrey Rush plays the fool, Judi Dench plays the Queen, and 
Tom ("The Full Monty") Wilkinson, Ben ("Armageddon") Affleck, and Rupert 
("My Best Friend's Wedding") Everett all give fine accountings, with 
Everett brief but fun as Will's rival playwright, the ill-fated 
Christopher Marlowe.</P>
<P>Fiennes and Paltrow, of course, are terrific and make a handsomely 
engaging couple, even if the latter's nude scenes do seem cheap and 
somewhat distracting in this otherwise high-class production.</P>
<P>That said, "Shakespeare in Love" remains a wicked and wonderfully 
mature period romance, one with which the Bard himself, no doubt, would 
have been proud to be associated.</P>
