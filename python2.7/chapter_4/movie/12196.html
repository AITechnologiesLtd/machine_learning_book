<PRE>STRIPTEASE
* of **** grade is D-</PRE>
<P>Striptease is supposed to be a funny, sexy film that offers the goods --
Demi Moore's goods.  It fails on all levels but one, and that level
barely regesters.  This film does offer looks at Demi's chest and
g-string clad butt on a few ocasions.</P>
<P>That is all the film has to offer.  Most of the acting is terrible (Ving
Rhames survives best), the jokes are lame and very lame (I didn't laugh
once).  Demi has a straight delivery on her jokes, and that is wrong for
the part, surrounded by colorfully dreadful characters who overact, and
sometimes try.  So what is a film that just offers looks at Demi's body?</P>
<P>At least Showgirls wasn't as terrible as this film.  We had
unintentional laughs with that one.  This films a miracle.  It can't
even get me to laugh accidently.  Some bad films can be good, thanks to
camp, look at The Substitute or Barb Wire.  </P>
<P>The story of Striptease has Moorelosing custody of her child to a
no-good ex-husband, becoming a stripper at the Eager Beaver (ha-ha) to
earn money for a court appeal.  She meets many colorful characters, the
highlights being: a congressman (Reynolds), and a bouncer (Rhames).</P>
<P>I've meantioned that the film has hardly any appeal and thus not much to
talk about in terms of "comedy."  What you have left is Demi Moore's
naked body.  This is impressive, and somewhat voyueristic watching a
bigtime hollywood celebrity prance her pretty self up on the screen,
amidst the dreck. </P>
<P>Even Moore's nude and semi-nude scenes aren't even what they've been
cracked up to be.  Articals about her addiction to showing skin, a
somewhat sexy Late Night apperance, teasing trailers, even the title
promises SKIN.  This movies doesn't even deliver on that promise, the
way the public wants.  Lets be honest, I say public because people who
see or saw Striptease aren't going to see a good movie, they will see
Demi in next to nothing.</P>
<P>12.5 million dollars is the sallary Demi got paid to do this film.  That
was a large steping stone (and deserving one) for women actors in
hollywood.  Yet signing that paycheck to do this movie is a slap in the
face to women.  I see Demi's choice of this film in two ways.  Either
she wants the public to be aware of the curves of her body, in ways that
only Bruce Willis knows OR she was trying to lose all inhibitions about
her body by public nudity, like Madonna did with her book SEX.  Moore's
is a very good actress, in some movies.  First rate in pivital role in A
Few Good Men.  In Striptease all she wants is for us the public to know
what her butt looks like in a thong and what her chest looks like
without minus bra and shirt.  She took it all off and will leave you
with less money and an empty feeling.  What a waste!</P>
