<PRE>"In and Out" Lacks Umphh
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>With the high ratings generated last season by Ellen's coming-out
episode on her self-titled hit television show, it seemed like only a
matter time before the big studios released something along those same
lines.  The line, in this case, is the one that people cross when they
admit to others that they are gay.  Issues surrounding gay lifestyles
have increasingly crept up into mainstream Hollywood over the last few
years.  Most have been farcical looks at gayness such as the inanely
funny The Birdcage.  Other films feature gay characters to add
contrast and shock value to the story line as in Bound.  But this is
perhaps the first film that tries to take a semi-serious look at
someone exploring  his sexuality, discovering, in fact, that he might
be gay.</P>
<P>Semi-serious, of course, because the film focuses on high school
teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline).  In a small town somewhere in
America's idyllic heartland, Howard teaches romantic poetry, sits with
his legs daintily crossed, and wears a bow tie.  He is also outwardly
effeminate and also loves Barbara Streisand (he's seen Funny Girl a
dozen times).  Yet despite all of this evidence, he is engaged to a
wistful love, fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack).
As the wedding quickly approaches, fate steps in.  One night while
watching the Oscars, one of his former students, Camerron Drake (Matt
Dillon), garners the gold statuette for Best Actor.  In his acceptance
speech, he graciously thanks everyone, including his teacher, but also
announces that Brackett is gay to the millions of TV viewers, not too
mention the population of the town.  </P>
<P>Howard is stunned.  The town is stunned.  His parents quickly rush
over.  "Is there anything that you want to tell us," they gingerly
ask?  He exclaims, "I'm not gay!"   Soon after, the media storms into
town.  He becomes hounded by a second-rate reporter named Peter Malloy
(Tom Selleck) who is looking for his big break.  Moreover, Peter is
gay and has come out, and he urges Howard to do the same.</P>
<P>Ultimately, after a hilarious scene that focuses on Howard's
masculinity test, which he fails with flying colors, he realizes after
all these years why he runs around with a limp hand.  The rest of the
movie shifts its attention to how Howard copes with his new-found
lifestyle and how the town copes with him.  Under the direction of
Frank Oz, who breathes light comedy, we see Howard's life slowly
disintegrate around him.  Emily is furious, the faculty and students
become wary, his father is in disbelief (a wholesome-as-can-be Wilford
Brimley), and the dreams of his wedding-needing mother (a perky and
belligerent Debbie Reynolds) is shattered.   </P>
<P>Shattered is also how this reviewer felt after leaving the theatre.
In it's quest to explore breakthrough material, this movie seemed to
try too hard to remain politically correct.  It took great strides not
to mock anyone.  For a movie about gayness, it seemed
amazingly...uh...mainstream.  It seemed to be void of any major
conflict that demanded a resolution.  It seemed to lack any conviction
in trying to give this film bite.  It failed to connote the fragility
of the experience and seemed all to willing to let Kline's comic charm
lead his way nonchalantly in and out of precarious situations that
surrounded his sexuality.  The ending reeks of schmaltz as it looks
for a feel-good way to wrap it all up.</P>
<P>Perhaps the intent was not to rock the boat or to offer a
groundbreaking film.  That's probably better left to the independent
filmmakers. The movie is certainly not a work of comic - or
philosophical - genius either.  However, it's strong showing at the
box office signals a growing acceptance for movies that explore this
topic.  Your reward for seeing this film, though, is a great cast of
characters, especially Tom Selleck and Debbie Reynolds and also Bob
Newhart who plays the nervously cautious high school principal.  But,
that's the only reward you'll find.  Like the gay community, I'm sure
that I'm in the minority when I say that this film is a tepid comedy
at best.  In and Out meanders in and out of sometimes-amusing scenes,
but it never seems to quite go anywhere at all.   </P>
