<PRE>CHICKEN RUN
-----------</PRE>
<P>"No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!" is the challenge taken on by one
plucky chicken named Ginger (Julia Sawalha). Ginger wants a better world for 
herself and her friends, the other inmates at the Tweedy's Egg Farm, so she 
attempts one breakout after another, only to end up in solitary every time. 
But, the clock is running out for Ginger and her fowl friends as the evil Mrs. 
Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) finds a new way to feather her nest - instead of 
gathering their eggs, she plans to turn her chickens into pies! With the help 
of a new arrival, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), the self-acclaimed Lone Free 
Ranger, Ginger hatches a spectacular and daring escape plan, a plan that will 
free them all in "Chicken Run."</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>The makers of "Chicken Run," co-directors and co-producers Nick Park and Peter
Lord, have elevated the art of claymation to a pinnacle with such works as the
Oscar nominated animated short, "Wat's Pig" and Oscar winners, "Creature
Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers" and "A Close Shave." The latter two established
the characters, Wallace and Gromit, as figures of international popularity. So,
the anticipation among the fans of Aardman Entertainment for their first
feature has been long and expectant. And the word?</P>
<PRE>No worries, mate!</PRE>
<P>"Chicken Run" is a parody of and homage to all the great POW and prison break
movies we have seen over the decades. Most prominent is the best of them all,
the 1963 John Sturges classic "The Great Escape," which the Park/Lord film so
lovingly recreates. At the very opening, Ginger is in the midst of breaking out
of her prison, only to be thwarted by the "goons," Mr. Tweedy and his vicious
guard dogs. The following montage shows the indefatigable Ginger trying again
and again, only to fail and end up in the hole. Her spirit never flags, though,
so, when Rocky, quite literally, flies into her life, hope for escape to the
fabled Paradise Farm is rejuvenated.</P>
<P>I don't want to get into the meat of the story of "Chicken Run." That is best
left for the filmmakers to do when you see it yourself, which I hope everyone
does. Suffice it to say that this is the most fun I have had at the movies
since "Toy Story 2." Park/Lord have made an indelible mark in the annals of 
feature animation that rivals The Giant - Disney. The painstaking nature of the
claymation technique requires years to produce a full-length film and the folks
at Aardman took the time to learn their lessons. Their entry into the big time
is nothing less than spectacular.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong. "Chicken Run" is not a perfect film. At about the 25-minute
mark, the story started to wind down and I thought I would see a good, not
great, animation. Things quickly take a turn for the better as the tale of
escape cranks up, Ginger makes her plans and Rocky provides the beefcake for
the ladies at Tweedy's farm. The story, basically, follows the same plot as 
"The Great Escape," but with the chickens facing a more onerous fate than just 
being prisoners. The imperative of escape reaches serious proportions as their 
true fate - to become the primary ingredient of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken 
Pies - is realized. High drama, comedy and action prevail 'til the end.</P>
<P>Besides "The Great Escape" (the direct references to which had me in stitches)
there are allusions to such other terrific POW films as "Stalag 17." 
The amazing thing about "Chicken Run" is that it takes such subjects as
genocide (or, is that chicken-ocide?) and imprisonment and puts a humorous spin
on it without being silly. Don't get me wrong, there is enough silliness and
dumb, funny humor to appeal to the kids (and "Hogan's Heroes" fans) in the
audience. There is also a plethora of intelligence and wit, coupled with some
very dark humor, to keep the adult population attentive and entertained.</P>
<P>The vocal characterizations, with their onscreen images, are first rate. While
Mel Gibson is the name name, the rest of the cast, led by Sawalha (daughter
Sapphire of "Absolutely Fabulous) as Ginger, are equal to their characters.
Except for Miranda Richardson as the voice of Mrs. Tweedy, you won't recognize
many of the British cast members. Jane Horrocks ("Little Voice," and Bubble in
"Ab Fab") gives voice to the simple, but lovable, Babs, who is forever
knitting.  Stage actress Lynn Ferguson provides an enjoyable Scottish burr to 
Mac, a super-intelligent hen who is the engineering brains of the escape team.
Benjamin Whitrow as the aging rooster Fowler, Tony Haygarth as the dumb but 
observant Mr. Tweedy, Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels as the rat procurers Nick 
and Fetcher all contribute to the depth of character this 86-minute marvel of a 
movie deserves.</P>
<P>The production, especially to those who are familiar with the painstaking
nature of claymation, is a wonder to behold. Within minutes of the start of 
the film, the viewer is completely taken over by the world created by the 
Aardman folks.  The attention to details, such as every chicken being a unique 
character with her own look and personality, is astounding. The current hype, 
today, for computer generated imagery (CGI) is put to shame by the shear 
craftsmanship of this stellar example of such a traditional technique. Stop 
motion animation has been around since the early days of movies and "Chicken 
Run" is at the pinnacle of its art.</P>
<P>"Chicken Run" should be seen by the whole family. Actually, it should be seen
by everyone. It has intelligence, humor, drama and tragedy, dance numbers, 
amour and more, any of which will have appeal to someone out there. The 
sinister aspects of the story may be a bit too dark for younger, sensitive 
kids, but the overall lightness of "Chicken Run's" being should help get 
them by.</P>
<P>I don't say this often enough: I give "Chicken Run" an unbridled A.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Fans of triple-Oscar winner Nick Parks' delightful "Wallace and Grommit"
shorts are rewarded with his (and co-director/producer Peter Lord)
long-awaited claymation feature film debut "Chicken Run."</P>
<P>Ginger (Julia Sawalha, "Absolutely Fabulous") is a resourceful hen
among the downtrodden denizens of Tweedy's Chicken Farm, where Mr. Tweedy
(Tony Haygarth, "London Kills Me") suspiciously patrols the barbed wire
perimeters of his chicken huts with two vicious guard dogs.  Ginger
dreams of a life of freedom, beyond the grassy hills she can she from
the roof of her hut, but although she's capable of escaping herself, her
vision includes all her friends at the farm, who she refuses to abandon.</P>
<P>When one hen fails to produce eggs, she's removed to the chopping block
(reminiscent of Babe's almost-fate) by the unrelentingly mean Mrs. Tweedy 
(Miranda Richardson, "Sleepy Hollow").  To make matters worse, a chicken 
products van arrives delivering a mysterious contraption that's hidden in 
the barn.  Only Mr. Tweedy's problems getting it to work are buying Ginger 
time to plot their escape.</P>
<P>A savior arrives in the form of an arrogant Yank rooster, Rocky (Mel Gibson),
who arrives catapulted over the fence yelling 'Freedom!' at the top of his
lungs (the film's punched up with many movie in-jokes referencing the
likes of "Braveheart," "Stalag 17" and, most notably, "The Great Escape").
Ginger enlists his help to teach her girls how to fly.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick ("James and the Giant Peach") tells
a traditionally simple tale.  The pleasures of "Chicken Run" are to be
found in its marvelous details (a V of geese pass overhead as Ginger 
watches the sun set from behind a fence, two huckster rats pass off a
tub stopper on a chain as a necklace for sale), terrific characterizations
and vocal performances, a darkness reflected in the look of the film 
and the painstaking process of the claymation itself.</P>
<P>Hundreds of distinctly different chickens were created for this film,
several of whom lend terrific support to Ginger and Rocky.  Janes Horrocks
("Little Voice" and another "Absolutely Fabulous" vet) is Babs, a sweetly
dim bird with a serious knitting habit.  Lynn Ferguson (a Scottish stage
actress and standup comedienne) is Mac, the bespeckled engineering genius
who provides a marvelous foil for Rocky's "Braveheart" moments.  Benjamin
Whitrow ("A Man for All Seasons") is Fowler, the elderly RAF vet and house
rooster who resents Rocky's arrival and vents the British spleen at the
Americans late arrival into WWII.</P>
<P>Outside of the chickens, there are only two humans - the Tweedys.  Mrs.
Tweedy is a dried up crone who resents her husband's inability to provide
something better than their bleak farm.  Mr. Tweedy is henpencked indeed
and accused of losing his mind when he suggests their chickens are plotting.
Two rats, Nick (Timothy Spall, "Love's Labour's Lost") and Fetcher (Phil
Daniels, "Bad Behavior") provide comic relief and suggest the "King Rat"
aspect of the farm with their black market trading.</P>
<P>While "Chicken Run" is a delightful achievement, it doesn't quite attain
the constant brilliance of the "Wallace and Grommit" shorts.  Ironically, 
there's no "Feathers McGraw" moment - the startling hilarity of a penguin 
passing himself off as a chicken with a rubber glove on his head in "The 
Wrong Trousers."  Still, kudos to the huge group of filmmakers whose
patience with the stop-motion technique has brought this charmer for young
and old alike to the screen.</P>
