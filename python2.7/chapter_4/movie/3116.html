<PRE>                        MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN demonstrates that the combination of a
great story, a great producer, a great director, and great actors can
still produce a lousy film.</P>
<P>     Kenneth Branagh directed and plays Dr. Frankenstein.  De Niro
plays the monster.  Coppola produced, and he showed he can produce
horror films in DRACULA.  So what went wrong?</P>
<P>     I think it's the attempt to treat an inferior, basically low-brow
story with a great deal of artistic respect.  All the scenes are dark
and brooding.  Even attempt is made to replicate the feel of the
semi-industrial technology from the book.  The monster is played with
great sensitivity and understanding by De Niro, who brings his past
experience playing despised outsiders to the role.</P>
<P>     But the story can just not sustain this kind of dramatic
intensity.  Mary Shelley's book is really just a horror story, not just
more, and its flavor was much better captured by earlier, far inferior
in terms of production values, versions of this film.  The monster is
created in a fit of dark obsession; he rips up a bunch of people; and
he dies with his creator in the frozen North.  That's it--not all
this nonsense about obsession with responsibility of the creator to
society, or respect for life.  That's our modern world reinterpreting
her work.</P>
<P>     I did like the one bit where De Niro delivers lines straight from
Shelley's work, "And if I cannot quench one I will indulge the other."
He made me see the monster in the larger context of DeNiro's other
outsiders, no small feat.  But most of the time DeNiro himself showed
through; you get the feeling that you're watching Jake LaMotta on a
really bad day, or something like that.  DeNiro has just too strong a
screen history to portray anything like this so seriously.</P>
<P>     Kenneth Branagh withdraws a good deal of the credit he obtained
for the brilliant HENRY V with this film.  I just hope he got paid
well.  He doesn't have the chest of Alec Baldwin, nor enough physical
presence to bring life to a role like this one.</P>
