A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tsui Hark
Written by: Shui Chung Yuet</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Damian Lau Chung-Yun, Adam Cheng Siu-Chow, Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia, Samo
Hung Kam-Bo, Randy Man, Judy Ong, Tsui Hark</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Flying kung fu swordsmen and swordswomen, supernatural monsters, magic
weapons</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this Chinese mythological fantasy, I-chen - - a young army private in
16th century China - - gets tired of war, especially a battle which pits
uniformed reds, blues, greens, oranges, and yellows all against each
other in a pointless conflict. So I-chen sneaks off and becomes the
apprentice of superhero kung fu master Sifu Ting.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the superhero world of flying swordsmen and magical
weapons turns out to be just as petty and divisive as the normal-powered
world. The world's big heroes - - Ice Countess and her handmaiden,
Master Ting and Private I-chen, and a superhero Buddhist monk along with
the monk's apprentice - - don't want anything to do with each other. 
This is bad news because, due to a lack of cooperation, Sifu Ting, Ice
Countess, and the monk get knocked out of commission by the supernatural
forces of evil. This leaves the three apprentices (I-chen, the
handmaiden, and the monk's assistant) on their own to save the world.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around a big monster that will soon hatch into the
ultimate evil, spelling doomsday for the world in only 49 days. Only two
magic swords located in a far off borderland can combine into a weapon
powerful enough to defeat the coming monster. The three young wannabes
must go on a quest, find the magical swords, enlist allies, and save the
world from the emergence of evil.</P>
<P>Opinion:
While THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of the few mainstream American sword
fighting fairy tales involving comedy, fighting, and some magic, Chinese
sword fighting fairy tales are common in Hong Kong film. The difference
is, Hong Kong swashbuckling is often more 'over-the-top,' on the order
of SPAWN or other comic book fantasies. In ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN people fly around like Superman. In addition, heroes can
levitate objects, control the forces of nature, and transfer their
powers to others. And they carry swords and shields and have big long
sashes and other enchanted weapons that can magically fly, spin,
duplicate, and take on a life of their own before returning to the
hero's side.</P>
<P>ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN is one of director Tsui Hark's
earlier works, before martial arts films had much of a budget - - so
you'll easily notice when the camera shot switches to a scale model - -
in contrast to the deft visual flair of the rest of the movie. This
gives the cinematography a stop-and-go feel. </P>
<P>The wushu fight choreography is good, and the very beginning of ZU:
WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN features an outstanding and funny war
sequence along with some sharp quips on human nature made by the
characters. After the great beginning, the plot starts to get a little
murky. The characters also become less witty and more cardboard. Soon it
becomes confusing keeping track of who is who, as side characters such
as Long Brows, Heaven's Blade, and Lady Li-ichi are thrown in. The
finale of ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN features lots of flying,
but less martial arts.</P>
<P>The bottom line? ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN has a great
beginning. The characters aren't too deep, and the plot gets a little
murky, but the wushu action content is high, providing entertaining
action with little or no bloodshed or body count. </P>
