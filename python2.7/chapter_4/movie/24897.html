<PRE>Saboteur (1942)</PRE>
<P>In SABOTEUR, Alfred Hitchcock was warming up for his later masterworks such 
as NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Not that SABOTEUR cannot stand by itself as the work 
of an expert.  It's just that the pacing is a little off, and the story asks 
us to suspend our disbelief a few too many times.</P>
<P>Robert Cummings is a very competent hero.  In some scenes in this film, he 
comes close to the nonchalance that James Stewart brought to many Hitchcock 
works.  Of course a problem for modern viewers may be this nonchalance.  
Because the era that bred SABOTEUR featured low-key performances, modern 
audiences may succumb to the ever-present boredom caused by anything without 
a frenetic pace or overwrought acting.  Cummings does not play Barry Kane 
with an emotional bent fashioned by some method-acting ranter; rather, he 
skips from problem to problem with typical mid-century stoicism.  What needs 
to be done will be done, one can imagine Cummings saying in an interview.</P>
<P>The premise of the film surfaces in many Hitchcock films.  An innocent man – 
Barry Kane --  is accused of setting a fire to a factory that produces 
aircraft for the American war effort.  What's worse, he's thought to have 
handed his best buddy an extinguisher filled with gasoline.  The buddy 
perishes.  What's the rub?  A mysterious character named Fry (Norman Lloyd) 
is the actual saboteur, but only Kane and his dead friend had contact with 
this nasty, fox-like man.  Soon Kane is on the lam from the law.  As in THE 
FUGITIVE, Kane compounds his legal troubles by escaping: he must be so 
thoroughly convinced that he will take the rap for this heinous crime of 
sabotage, treason and murder, that he determines to set off on his own to 
find Fry and anyone backing him.</P>
<P>On the way, Kane finds refuge in the house of a blind man – who cannot see 
Kane's handcuffs but somehow senses everything.  This man's niece soon 
enters, and though her uncle instructs her to accompany Kane to a 
locksmith's to remove the cuffs, she (Priscilla Lane as Patricia Martin).  
Kane adds kidnapping to his legion of infractions, apparently trusting that 
everything will turn out in the end.  (Of course, part of Hitchcock's genius 
was in getting everything to turn out satisfactorily for his audiences; he 
certainly knew what viewers of his time demanded.)   More complications 
ensue, and we spot countless Hitchcockian trademarks – wealthy and respected 
criminal masterminds, ingenues in jeopardy, American icons used to support 
suspenseful plot twists.</P>
<P>I think part of the contrived feeling of the plot is the artifice used to 
set up some of the climactic situations.  Exactly why would a saboteur tour 
the Statue of Liberty after he has damaged an American warship as it 
launched?  Would anyone but a ‘40's film heroine endanger herself by trying 
to delay or trap this ruthless criminal, and would anyone but the hero try 
to save this selfsame criminal as he hangs from the hand of Lady Liberty?  
These people are apparently moral to the core.  A minor and interesting 
agenda involves a further boost to the common man: a truck driver who gives 
Kane a ride early in his flight from justice surfaces later to assist him in 
escaping from the very clutches of the cops.  It's almost as if Hitchcock is 
cheering the proletariat, while the monied ne'er-do-wells scheme and plot 
for the downfall of the war effort, and perhaps even control of the country. 
  (There are definite undercurrents here that attack fascism…)</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we see some stunning camera work and memorable images.  
Everything Hitchcock touched was in some way artificial, from the California 
mountains to the massive statue at the end – painted backdrops within 
studios, or smaller-than-life models. But the use this director makes of his 
props is amazing.</P>
<P>Perhaps the pace of the film could be tighter in scenes, but every scene 
does seem necessary.  There is even some top-notch comic relief – coming 
mostly when Kane and Martin are saved from a police search by a caravan full 
of circus performers.</P>
<P>Pricilla Lane does a very smooth job as Patricia Martin, the headstrong 
niece of an eminently decent blind man.  A pity she did not get more roles: 
her acting talents might have made her a household name.</P>
<P>For fans of Hitchcock, SABOTEUR is a must-see.  It clearly foreshadows his 
later successes with big names like Cary Grant and James Stewart and Doris 
Day.  And the changes of scenery show that he was a filmmaker on the move, 
unafraid to use location shots mixed with rear projection and studio 
fakeries.</P>
