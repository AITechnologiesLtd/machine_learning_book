<P>How many movies are they going to make in which someone prepares food which
by itself seems to magically transform folks into more vibrant, horny and
happy people? I personally really liked both LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE and
WOMAN ON TOP, both of which followed the same tradition, but now it seems to
be getting a little out of hand. It was a clever idea at first, Mr. Holly
and Wood, but how about holding off on any new incarnations unless an
extremely creative touch is added to the now-dated concept.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A mystery woman and her daughter enter a "tranquil" town and open their own
chocolatterie (chocolate shop). Soon enough, the puritan locals fall in love
with her confections but not without much backlash from the town's mayor,
who considers her to be a troublemaker.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An interesting, uneven, if entirely predictable fairy-tale comedy featuring
some solid acting all around and a cute story which needlessly sticks around
way past its final course. I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It was
light, fluffy, romantic, funny and it played out very well in the little
village in which it was set up. The intros were well done, the characters
sharpened by the experienced actors and the set-up, despite feeling quite
deja-vu for me, interesting enough to keep my eyes wide awake.
Unfortunately, the movie just didn't seem to know where to stop. It went on
and on and on and on and on. Near the end, it just started feeling like it
was never gonna stop. With its purposely magical feel, I expected a cutesy
story, some romantic and funny moments, which I received, and a quick and
easy ending. But the filmmakers seemed to veer off course about 2/3 of the
way in. That's about the time Johnny Depp entered the picture for the first
time, a man who looks great in just about anything that he does, and
suddenly the film took on a "darker" tone. Things got ugly, death entered
the picture and the film suddenly became...dare I say, realistic! Of course,
realism is fine in most films but with the whole mythical amusing feel of
the movie up until that point, the ending just seemed out of place. It was
like the director wanted to create a fun-loving movie, and get us all
emotional as well. For me, it didn't work.</P>
<P>But the whole movie wasn't an entire waste. In fact, not at all. The actors
were all great, especially Alfred Molina, who by all counts, should be the
one and only choice to redo the part of Inspector Clouseau in any future
PINK PANTHER movies. A great character actor, always! Binoche was good as
well, with enough range to make her character real and believable, and
Carrie Anne-Moss, great move by you and your agent! I barely recognized her
out of those black leather pants...good show! Sadly, Johnny Depp was
woefully underused. This was even more disappointing to me because 1) I love
the man...uuuh, the actor, that is...harumph and 2) Uhhhm, his face is
plastered all over the poster! He might draw people into theatres, but many
will leave disappointed once they acknowledge his grand absence. Anyway, his
character was also very underdeveloped, and I wish we could have had more
time with him, instead of some of the more serious moments near the end of
this film. In the end, the movie was simple enough for me to enjoy for the
most part, thanks to all of the interesting actors in the film and the cute
premise, but it truly does outlast its stay and doesn't really have all that
much to say when you think about it afterwards. Oh yeah and did I mention
that Johnny Depp is one great looking man? Me go eat some chocolate now...</P>
