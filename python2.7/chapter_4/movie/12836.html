<P>During one of "The Horse Whisperer's" most lyrical scenes, a horse panics 
and runs away. Tom Booker, assigned the task of calming the troubled 
animal, does not chase him. Instead, he walks into the field and waits. 
Minutes turn to hours as Tom continues to wait for the animal in silence. 
Finally, after waiting all day, Tom's patience is rewarded as the horse 
quiets and returns to him on its own accord. "The Horse Whisperer" is 
filled with understated moments like that. Poetic, dignified and deeply 
humane, the film is a rarity, a rich character-driven tale with brains, 
heart and integrity.</P>
<P>Based on Nicholas Evans' best-selling novel, the story focuses on 14-year-
old Grace MacLean, emotionally and physically crippled following a tragic 
riding accident. Grace isn't the only traumatized party. Her beloved 
horse Pilgrim turns wild, and several handlers tell the family that the 
horribly wounded creature will never recover and should be "put down." 
But Grace's mother Annie, sensing that her daughter's recovery is somehow 
linked to the horse, refuses and seeks another solution. After reading an 
article about horse whisperers, people with an almost mystical ability 
for reaching troubled horses, she seeks out the legendary Tom Booker and 
asks for help. Ignoring his brusque refusal, Annie takes a leave of 
absence from her job as a high-powered New York magazine editor, packs up 
both horse and daughter and heads for Tom's Montana ranch. </P>
<P>Much like another print sensation, "The Bridges of Madison County," "The 
Horse Whisperer" was derided by some as mawkish and melodramatic. And, 
just as Clint Eastwood did with James Waller's book, Robert Redford has 
taken Evans' words and transformed them into a beautifully crafted film 
that draws a strong emotional reaction honestly, with well-drawn 
characters and intelligent dialogue. </P>
<P>"The Horse Whisperer" is a long movie, just under three hours, but the 
length is justifiable. As the story moves from Manhattan to Montana, 
Redford changes the rhythm, placing the audience in a setting where 
things move with a more deliberate, thoughtful pace. Although the Montana 
setting is idyllic, Redford doesn't take cheap shots at those who live in 
the city. Instead, he presents two approaches to navigating through life, 
contrasting those who push for quick answers with those who take the time 
to observe, listen and thing things through.</P>
<P>That's the secret behind a horse whisperer's "mystical" ability. Tom 
Booker, as played by director Redford, is a man whose magic comes from 
paying attention. He learns about Pilgrim by watching the horse and the 
people who love it. Along the way, he also learns what Grace needs, 
giving her space when she demands it and structure when she requires it. 
And, much to his surprise, he learns what Annie needs as well.</P>
<P>Stories about young people trying to recover from traumatic incidents are 
nothing new, of course. "Ordinary People," the first film Redford 
directed, dealt with a tortured youth and the strained relationship 
between him and his mother. Redford handles this sort of thing well 
because he doesn't take the easy route. There are no villains in "The 
Horse Whisperer." People make mistakes, but they learn from them. People 
are faced with difficult choices and they make reasoned decisions. 
Redford creates the kind of world that could be, if only all of us would 
try harder, care more and take responsibility for our own actions and the 
effect those actions might have on others. You don't see that in movies 
very often anymore.</P>
<P>The acting in"The Horse Whisperer" is as good as its script. The always 
dependable Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper are strong as Tom's brother and 
sister-in-law, and Sam Neill is sturdy as Grace's father, shining in a 
beautifully written speech towards the end of the film. Scarlett 
Johansson strikes just the right notes as Grace, capturing the pain the 
young woman suffers without ever overplaying the angst. As Annie, "The 
English Patient's" Kristin Scott Thomas takes risks, displaying the 
abrasive, brittle side of her character along with her many sympathetic 
qualities. </P>
<P>Redford is excellent as Tom Booker. He could easily have made the 
character a noble icon, or overplayed the down-home, "Aw shucks" cowboy 
business. Instead, Redford creates an erudite, well-spoken man who has 
loved, lost and learned from the experience. It's an strong, nuanced, 
honest performance. About the only area where Redford cheats a little is 
in the lighting. Throughout the film, the sun mostly shines on Redford 
from the back or side, minimizing the wrinkles on the aging actor's face. 
Good for him! In a film as benign and forgiving as "The Horse Whisperer," 
it's only fair to forgive Redford for showing a little bit of vanity. He 
deserves it. </P>
