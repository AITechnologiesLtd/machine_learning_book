<P>"Plunkett & MacLeane", the new 18th century action-adventure from
music video director Jake Scott, defies all the rules of conventional
period piece logic. It is hip, vibrant, and a lot of fun. The film
reunites "Trainspotting" stars Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller as
Plunkett & MacLeane, two ex-cons paired together against their will to
become Britain's most notorious highwaymen.  Plunkett provides the
skills, and MacLeane provides the social stature. The two collaborate
in order to steal from the rich and give to...themselves. When the men
hold up the coach of the Lord Chief Justice Gibson (Michael Gambon),
MacLeane falls in love at first sight with the Lord's feisty niece,
Rebecca (Liv Tyler). While Plunkett tries to rob money for the two to
get to America, MacLeane tries to win the affections of Rebecca. When
I saw "Plunkett & MacLeane", I wasn't quite sure what to
expect. However, after a couple rough opening scenes, Jake Scott
(relative of directors Ridley and Tony Scott) presents us with an
immensely likable, techno-beat-driven period piece adventure for the
MTV generation. Scott's film might be hard-pressed to find an
audience, since it's quirky tone seems to appeal neither to the
costume drama crowd nor the younger action crowd. Hopefully,
moviegoers will look past the facade and "Plunkett & MacLeane" can
become an art house hit.  Whatever the outcome of its theatrical run,
"Plunkett & MacLeane" is quite an enjoyable little film, and an
admirable debut for Jake Scott.</P>
