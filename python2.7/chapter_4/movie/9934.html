<P>BAD BOY BUBBY. 1993, Australia.
Writer/Director:  Rolf de Heer.
Cinematography:  Ian Jones
Music:  Graham Tardiff
Actors:  Nicholas Hope, Claire Benito, Carmel Johnson, Ralph Cotterill.
Running time:  114 mins.</P>
<P>If your sense of humour runs to blow-up dolls with huge breasts and nipples
that flash on and off like Christmas tree lights, then this movie is for
you. Every sequence of  this amazing film pushes the boundaries of bad taste
in just about every direction.  You will be flinching in your seats, as I
did, while laughing out loud at the extraordinary adventures of Bubby as he
undergoes redemption.</P>
<P>Set in Port Adelaide, South Australia this black comedy is certainly worth
seeing. Nicholas Hope portrays the emotionally deprived Bubby, a 35 year old
man who has been kept incarcerated all his life by his slatternly mother.
She uses him for sex and keeps him locked inside with only a cat and
cockroaches for company. Having been convinced that the air outside is
poisonous, he never tries to explore outside their ghastly two-roomed slum.
His father Pop returns, not knowing that Bubby existed, and soon thereafter
Bubby discovers new uses for clingwrap.  Emerging into the outside world,
this man-child sets about finding a life.</P>
<P>The filmmaker Rolf de Heer uses the style of film noir beautifully expanding
it to include disillusionment with society, manipulation of time and an
emphasis on corruption and despair.  It is an honest, raw view of the world
through Bubby's innocent eyes.</P>
<P>9 a.m. Monday morning could never be said to be the best time for a viewing
at a film festival but that's just what happened at the Venice Film Festival
in August 1993.  The applause in the barn-like "Palagalileo" was resounding
at the end of the credits and "Bad Boy Bubby" won the hearts of the audience
and votes of the judges.</P>
<P>Pitted against "Three Colours: Blue" and "Short Cuts",  "Bad Boy Bubby"
made its mark.  It won the Festival's Jury Prize, the Jury Prize for the
Italian Cinemagoers' Association (CIAK), shared the International Film
Critics' Award (FIPRESCI) with "Short Cuts", won a Bronze Plaque from the
International Catholic Organisation for Cinema and Audio-Visuals (OCIC) and
last but not least won a prize from a group of Italian high school students
who were guests at the screenings of the Festival.  </P>
<P>Initially the OCIC jury was divided with one member declaring that the film
was bestial and unethical and had complained to Festival management.  Some
judges were fascinated by its off-beat arresting themes but found it too
ugly according to Peter Malone, Australia's OCIC representative on the
panel.  Fortunately there were some judges who argued that the breaking of
new ground in theme and cinematic style and the fact that we live in a world
of evil needs to be seen in films that mirror this world, won through.  </P>
<P>The jury panel theologians referred to Psalm 130, the De Profundis psalm,
"Out of the depths, I cry to you" in their description of "Bad Boy Bubby".
This was indeed apt. It is a film that takes its audience into the depths of
brutality and the ugliness of human experience yet it reaches out in hope of
finding meaning for the experience.  </P>
<P>Australian film makers have never been backward in coming forward, as we have 
seen and read and Bad Boy Bubby is not a film about froth and bubbles.  This
creative child of writer/director Rolf De Heer.  Previous works of this
graduate from the Australian Film and Television School are "Tail of a
Tiger", a children's film, "Incident at Raven's Gate", a science-fiction
film, and "Dingo", a young man's dreams of emulating his idol Miles Davis.
De Heer has continued to stretch his creative ideas and explore the emotions
of childhood, this time in the emotionally immature, adult body of Bubby.  </P>
<P>Initially we are led to believe that Bubby is an idiot so that the film can
use the fool to bring both comedy and tragedy to its audience but it is the
character Angel who changes our perceptions when she is asked by one of the
handicap carers, "do you think he [Bubby] might be schizo?"</P>
<P>Angel's reply is "I don't think he's anything…he's just a…kid."
Bubby's chips in.  "Bubby be a big weird kid.  
Christ kid, you're a weirdo," he says.</P>
<P>This major turning point in the film reinforces the theme of childhood
emotions which De Heer returns to in his films, both those made before and
since "Bad Boy Bubby". The fact that "Bad Boy Bubby" was on the cards
throughout De Heer's career until 1993  when the film came to fruition makes
the theme understandable but continued exploitation wears very thin very
quickly.  It is hoped that De Heer can go beyond  this theme in future films.</P>
<P>When asked, De Heer revealed that the film came from a ‘drifting collation
of ideas' collected over a number of years of observation of people.  The
hard part he said was the ‘organisation into a coherent whole'.  After
viewing the film one could agree.  Some parts are rather fractured and with
a limited knowledge of film-making on board a bold statement that some
scenes could be construed as fillers, bubbles to the surface.  Whether this
is poor editing or structural storyline weakness requires a more
knowledgeable critic.  De Heer did admit that the film was made from the
first draft with the only changes being made as a result of casting and
logistical reasons.  He claimed that this led to the experience being very
fulfilling for him as a writer.  This remains open to opinion.  Perhaps this
student critic has learnt more than she gives herself credit.</P>
<P>With the music of Salvation Army choralists, a blues band, of bagpipes,
violins and church organs throughout the film we finally hear (but don't
see) the entire piece, Handel's "Largo" from "Xerxes" performed by the
Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Jose Serebrier  during the last
three scenes of the film completing at the end of the credit roll. </P>
<P>It is the music that carries the viewer out of the theatre but the story
lingers on in this student's memory to no doubt be recalled time and time
again down the road of life.</P>
