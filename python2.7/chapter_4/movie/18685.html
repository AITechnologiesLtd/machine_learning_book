ON DEADLY GROUND
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>There are many mysteries in life. The author of this review
is constantly amazed with the fact that he actually likes
Steven Seagal and his films. It's not because Seagal shows
some great acting skills, nor the quality of those films in
general. Seagal in all of his roles simply radiates the aura
of the man who honestly believes in what he is doing. Such
conviction is the virtue I admire, so, more often than not,
I'm ready to be biased and give Seagal benefit of the doubt.
That happened even in the case of ON DEADLY GROUND, 1994
directorial debut of Seagal, film that was one of the most
despised motion pictures, not just among Steven Seagal's
works, but also in entire movie history.</P>
<P>Plot revolves around Forrest Taft (played by Seagal), expert
fireman who works for Aegis Oil Company, whose corrupt CEO
Jennings (Michael Caine) wants to put into operation oil rig
right in the middle of Inuit tribal land in Alaska. Taft's
friend Hugh Palmer (Richard Hamilton) discovers the evidence
that the oil rig would permanently damage Alaskan
environment, so Jennings orders his killing. Taft is to
suffer the same fate, but instead, he is rescued by Eskimo
woman named Masu (Joan Chen) who gives him shelter in her
father's village. After brief recovery, Taft returns to oil
rig in order to stop Jennings' plans.</P>
<P>Seagal can't act to save his life, but in the hands of even
less capable directors, his charisma and martial arts skills
are enough to overcome such obstacles. Unfortunately, with
Seagal as director there was nobody else to compensate his
obvious lack of talents. The story of ON DEADLY GROUND is
third-grade, in-your-face exercise of "political
correctness" risen to unbearable levels. Seagal's lack of
directorial skills only underlines weakness of the script
with one-dimensional characters and total lack of subtlety.
The lack of Seagal's talent is matched with the lack of
acting ability or inspiration by almost anybody else.
Michael Caine is almost laughable as vicious yet totally
un-charismatic villain, same as Joan Chen who sleepwalks
through her role. Action scenes are fine, but Seagal could
learn a couple things about editing. Of course, it would
unfair to say that film doesn't have few good sides. Alaskan
locations are good to see, Basil Poledouris made nice score,
and the bar brawl scene seems almost surrealistically
unusual. And in the end we have that (in)famous five minute
scene of Forrest Taft holding sermon about ecology,
environment, energy resources and corporate greed. Fact that
Seagal originally wanted the sermon to last fifteen minutes
shows that he still believed in what he was doing and that
he had good intention. But, the end result is still
unwatchable and we are at end only reminded of that old
saying about hell and good intentions.</P>
