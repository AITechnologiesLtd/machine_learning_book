<PRE>                                 SWINGERS
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Doug Liman
Writer: Jon Favreau
Starring: Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Ron Livingston, Patrick Von Horn, 
Alex Desert, Brooke         Langton, Deena Martin, Katherine Kendall, 
Heather Graham</P>
<P>Any movie where the characters have their own kind of vernacular amongst 
them is already a pretty damn cool flick to me.  Any movie that not only 
has this, but has the guts to say Quentin Tarantino rips off Martin 
Scorsese's has got to get some kind of ultra-cool award (It's true, 
Quentin does - you know it, I know it, and the American people know it - 
but the man is still a god).</P>
<P>"Swingers" is perhaps the coolest movie of the year...and it even has a 
neurotic, insecure protagonist.  The guys in this movie are either 
out-of-work or actors-with-crap-jobs living in L.A, going to parties and 
those clubs that have no sign and are a bitch to find.  During the day, 
they go to pointless call-backs; at night, they go around town, 
drinking, dancing, and picking up "digits."  Their unofficial leader is 
the ultra-confident, semi-philisophical Trent (an amazingly great Vince 
Vaughn, now having the cool pick-up line of "I was in Jurassic Park 2"). 
 But the focus is on the depressed Mike (writer and star, Jon Favreau, 
also blessed with a new cool pick-up line: "I was on "Friends" for a 
couple episodes then was taken out with the most bizarre plot twist in 
recent television history.")</P>
<P>Mike has just...okay, so it was 6 months ago...he broke up with his 
girlfriend and after half the year, he hasn't gotten over her.  He's so 
depressed, he sits for days against the wall looking at pictures of them 
and having weird delusions of his answering machine giving him 
confidence boosts (which begins a cool continuum problem - look for it). 
In the beginning, Trent calls him up and they impulsively go to Vegas to 
gamble, but Trent just wants to pick up "babies."  Mike is nervous and 
tells a really hokey joke...then confesses he's actually an out-of-work 
comedian.</P>
<P>The story focuses mainly on Mike, but the other characters - Rob (Ron 
Livingston) is his actor friend who just moved out there and is bummed 
because he's going from doing Hamlet on Broadway to Goofy for Disney; 
and Sue (Patrick Von Horn), who has a temper and basically sucks at NHL 
Hockey for the Sega Genesis mainly because they took out the fighting - 
well, the other characters are presented nicely as well.  There is no 
real plot, unless you call Mike's pilgrimmage from depression to getting 
back into the scene a plot.</P>
<P>"Swingers" has no real big grandios themes and doesn't offer any real 
poetic messages; it's just a really fun, clever and intelligent film.  
While there is some satire from of the out-of-work actor thing and the 
whole swinging/nightlife scene, the main thing to admire from it is the 
acting and the great writing by Jon Favreau.  He writes beautiful 
dialogue and clearly-carved characters, especially Trent, who's got to 
be one of the coolest characters written for the screen since...well, in 
a while.  And who's character, as cool as he is, is presented as the 
true normal-guy-schmuck that he is in the final scene.</P>
<P>The acting is fantastic from everyone, epsecially Favreau and Vaughn: 
Favreau shows great comic flair as the neurotic, down-on-his-self-esteem 
guy; and Vaughn is just, well, "money" (word for cool in their clique). 
 Also standing out is some Melrose Place star (Brooke Langton - what she 
does on the show, I don't know, I don't watch it and I don't plan to 
ever) as one of the girls Mike attempts to pick up but lets his 
confidence and lying get in the way of ever doing well with her.  </P>
<P>Because it's so fun to watch and the fact that I laughed hysterically 
numerous times (and the fact that the published screenplay has a 
glossary for the terms in the back), I highly reccomend "Swingers" as 
one of the best films of last year.</P>
