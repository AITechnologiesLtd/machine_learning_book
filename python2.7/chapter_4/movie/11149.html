<PRE>AS GOOD AS IT GETS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>Every now and then a truly memorable character enters the movie scheme.  In
1995, audiences couldnt help but feel sympathy for the slow-witted Forrest
Gump. Last year, Billy Bob Thortons character __ made us think twice about our
place in society.   This year a horror of a human being (with a compulsive
disorder) will somehow manage to nudge his place into our hearts.</P>
<P>Melvin Udall has a love for simple pleasures.  Cleaning his hands meticulously,
only ever drinking bottled water and scoffing down a huge breakfast every
morning are as important to Melvin as life itself.  Racist, sexist, unreasonable
and repulsive, he seems to suit the title of a demented grouch perfectly.
Working as a romance novelist, Melvin keeps to himself for most of the time and,
although his daily traditions are just they way he likes them, ultimately leads
an unhappy life.</P>
<P>A dedicated romance novel fan asks Melvin How do you write women so well?  I
think of a man, he replies, and I take away reason and accountability.</P>
<P>If what you have read so far tends you make you believe that Melvin is somewhat
of a tough cookie, youre absolutely correct.  And when this type of guy gets a
crush on a young, sweet and caring lady, interesting situations will no doubt
occur.  Our young lady is Christine Cookie (Helen Hunt), who is Melvins
favorite waitress at the local restaurant.  Well, favorite is an under
statement  he simply wont eat his morning feast unless Christine is there
taking his order.  So when she is unable to attend work due to a severe illness
of her sons, Melvin does everything in his power to make sure she is at work
the next morning  and funds all of Christines doctor and hospital bills.</P>
<P>An unlikely relationship forms between the two, and Melvins gay neighbor Simon
(Boof Gert) gets thrown in amongst the emotional chaos.  Thus a three-way search
for happiness begins, where each character craves their own set of desires.  Our
man Melvin does what mainstream cinema would expect: realizes the error of his
ways and begins to change into a nicer human being.  As he says to Christine
during dinner, You make me want to be a better person.</P>
<P>If youre not impressed by the engaging character that is Melvin, As Good as it
Gets wonderful acting and a plot that unravels with beauty and well-placed
comedy; there is another factor that seems to have the greatest significance of
all.  It starts with J and it ends with S.</P>
<P>Although the media spotlight may focus on Jack Nicholson as the selling point
for As Good as it Gets, director James L. Brooks also deserves to take much of
the credit.  His directing career has not gone unnoticed, but there is no doubt
that this film is clearly his best work in the 90s.</P>
<PRE>4 = stars out of 5
Almost as good as it gets</PRE>
