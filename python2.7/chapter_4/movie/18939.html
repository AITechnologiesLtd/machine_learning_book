<PRE>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
Directed by Jay Roach
Written by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers
With Mike Myers, Heather Graham
UA South, De Vargas    PG-13      95 min.</PRE>
<P>     Mike Myers's follow-up to his enormously successful 60s superspy
hit is relentlessly  and cheerfully tasteless.  To call it sophomoric
would be an insult to sophomores  everywhere.  And to call it funny
would be an understatement.  
     It's not all funny, not by any means.  A lot of toilet humor is
just plain excrescence, and  there's a lot of toilet humor here, as well
as jokes covering the entire lower end of the  comedy spectrum.  But
Mike Myers is a funny guy, and his inspired creations Austin  Powers and
Dr. Evil still have some good miles left in their tread.  He tries a
third persona  here, a fat slob of a Scotsman, who has none of the wit
of the other two and should have  been drowned at birth.
     If you think you might be offended by the movie's crudeness, it's a
good bet you will.   But if you're up to it, there's a lot to laugh at
here.  At the close of Powers I, Austin had  foiled archenemy Dr. Evil
and married the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley.  But marriage isn't  the
swinging superspy's bag, baby, and it's a relief when circumstances
leave him single  and available to the shaggadelic Felicity Shagwell 
(Heather Graham).  The bad doctor  reappears to surprise his son (Seth
Green) on a Jerry Springer show on the theme "My  Father Is Evil and
Wants to Take Over the World".  He then constructs a time-travel 
machine, and, accompanied by his compact clone Mini-me (Verne J. Troyer)
, heads back  to the 60s and steal Powers's mojo, a marrow-like
substance extracted from the agent's  cryogenically preserved body which
provides his irresistible sex appeal and shaggability.  
     The plot is all in the service of the gags.  Product placement
figures shamelessly, as  with Dr. Evil locating his headquarters in a
Starbucks atop Seattle's Space Needle.  There  are good gags, bad gags,
scatological humor, sexually incorrect humor, fat jokes, short  jokes,
penis jokes, breast jokes, lesbian jokes.  Sometimes a joke works once,
and falls flat  when it returns for an encore.  Sometimes once is too
much.  If you're still in your seat  after half an hour, you're probably
in for the long haul. </P>
