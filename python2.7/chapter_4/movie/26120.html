<P>_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Normal film review rules don't necessarily apply to
_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.  Despite being "a Spike Lee Joint," this
film of the popular stand-up comedy tour featuring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac is completely devoid of
his trademark razzle dazzle; Lee shoots the concert as matter-of-factly
as an HBO comedy special.   While not making for the most visually
inventive of cinema, the straightforward approach puts in proper focus
the film's appeal: four talented guys simply being very funny.</P>
<P>        Anyone familiar with the stand-up shows from which most of the
four first gained notice--BET's _Comicview_ and HBO's
_Def_Comedy_Jam_--knows that in being funny, these guys are also rather
profane.  Audiences whose only previous experience with Harvey and Cedric
is their work on the former's eponymous WB sitcom, or with Hughley on his
ABC-to-UPN transplant _The_Hughleys_, are in for a shock--the stars of
these family-skewed shows toss off four-letter words with the best
(worst?) of them.  Prudes may find the amount of profanity ridiculously
excessive, but it's an integral part of the comedians' verbal arsenal. 
Shock value isn't so much the intent as a side effect; the words are used
to punctuate and underscore their ideas and observations, many of which
revolve around the differences between blacks and whites.</P>
<P>        While that inevitably leads to overlap between the four's
routines--and a certain feeling of repetition--each performer carves out
their own distinct personality.  Harvey serves as emcee, and he's the
smooth romantic, the highlight of his sets (he does a bit between each
act) being a tribute to '70s old school soul that includes a hilarious,
on-target rip on rap/hip-hop concerts.  Hughley is the energetic live
wire, closing out his routine with jabs at random audience members. 
Cedric is the most laid-back--and most impressively coordinated; his
dance moves got both the filmed and live audiences going.</P>
<P>        Mac's aggressive closing set is at once the most incendiary and
the most truthful.  His routine could share the title of the central
manifesto in _Jerry_Maguire_, "The Things We Think and Do Not Say";
nothing and no one is safe as Mac talks about wanting to beat sense into
naughty children and launches into an extended bit involving stuttering. 
Much of his material could easily offend, but a lot of it comes within a
disarmingly honest context, such as the jokes involving his nieces and
nephew, the custody of whom was taken away from his drug-addicted sister
and given to him.  Of course, the comedic meat of the jokes derives from
his creative embellishment, but there is the ring of hard truth in the
jokes' foundation.</P>
<P>        In an attempt to break the stage-and-crowd visual monotony, Lee
sometimes cuts away from the performance to some moments away from the
performance arena.  Not a bad idea, per se, but these segments, such as a
rather pointless one where the four play poker, are largely dull lulls
that make the audience too aware of the film's 120-minute running time.</P>
<P>        But most of 120 minutes are devoted to what audiences buy a
ticket to see: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and
Bernie Mac doing their thing.  They don't disappoint--and, in turn,
neither does _The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.</P>
