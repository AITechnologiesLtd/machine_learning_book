<P>Susan Granger's review of "AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS" (Columbia/Sony)</P>
<P>What a waste of a talented cast! Billy Crystal and co-writer Peter Tolan have
concocted a sly, provocative premise and, as the opening credits roll, it's
obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy. The story
involves a veteran publicist (Billy Crystal) who is summoned to orchestrate a
press junket in Las Vegas when an arrogant director (Christopher Walken) holds a
megabuck movie hostage in his editing room, refusing to show it to anyone. He
figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation
between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars, Gwen and Eddie
(Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack), they'll be so distracted that they won't
remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected. (And Crystal
thought of this long before a Sony exec concocted the phony critic/David Manning
quote scandal!) For help, he turns to Gwen's personal assistant/sister (Julia
Roberts).</P>
<P>But the laughs are few and far-between. Crystal's glib, cynical flack isn't
wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners. After six months under the
care of a Depak Chopra-like guru (Alan Arkin), Cusack's character's too
emotionally fragile, lacking the necessary charisma. Zeta-Jones's vain,
narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional. Only Hank Azaria, as
Zeta-Jones's much-macho Spanish lover, and Stanley Tucci, as a studio exec, and
Roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth. Basically, we don't like these
ego-driven, stereotypical characters, let alone root for them to unwind their
romantic entanglements, and Joe Roth's direction is predictable, formulaic and
telegraphic. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "America's Sweethearts" is a
contrived, shallow 4. As a screwball satire, it's strictly superficial.</P>
