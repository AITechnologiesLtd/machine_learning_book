<P>I've heard some people blow this movie off as just another "Madonna" or "gay
is chique" flick, but obviously none of those people have seen this film,
which talks about love, touches upon romance and most importantly, speaks
about the acceptance of families which aren't the same as our own. In a
nutshell, this movie is an interesting, funny and emotional slice of life in
the new millennium.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A single, pretty girl who can't seem to find the "right guy" ends up
spending a drunken, sexual evening with her gay best friend (both agree that
it was a mistake), only to end up with a baby nine months later. The two
friends must then decide how they are going to raise the child, and
eventually have to deal with what will happen when either one of them finds
their real true love of their life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Funny, emotional, dramatic, goofy, preachy and open-minded all wrapped in
one, this movie is probably the best romantic "platonic" movie that I've
ever seen. Okay, before I move on, let's answer the question that everyone
reading this review wants to know...yes, Madonna is pretty good in the
movie! Can I go on now? Thank you. I liked this movie mostly because it
actually rung original despite already having seen a few similarly themed
"gay/straight friends liking each other" movies over the past few years. I
think that the leads might've had something to do with that, since Madonna
and Rupert Everett really seemed to love one another platonically in the
film, and it worked! Perhaps their true off-screen friendship benefited the
duo. Of course, you don't really want them screwing in the movie, but their
sincere charm as a couple, makes you want to see everything work out in the
end. And boy, do things ever get sticky!</P>
<P>For a movie that does a good job of balancing the humor and drama for the
first hour or so, prepare yourself for some tissue-time in the last half
hour, when things get kinda rough. Of course, I don't like to admit that I
cry at films (although I will admit to crying as I watched the horror that
was HANGING UP (3/10) a few weeks ago), this movie strung a nice, emotional
tale to which everyone should be able to relate. In fact, the film has more
to do with friendship, love and the acceptance of people's differences, than
it does homosexuality. Don't get me wrong, the film obviously uses this
reality as its basis of narrative, but in the end, the film succeeds in
offering us a funny, emotional look at an atypical, or typical if you will,
American family, in all its glory! Madonna is actually pretty good in it,
and totally believable as a yoga teacher (that was probably her idea :), as
is Rupert Everett, who may want to begin branching out after another great
gay, friend role, since I'm guessing that there is a ceiling for such roles.
I will admit that I didn't truly buy into a couple of scenes that had
Madonna crying, but overall, she certainly did a great job of having me
appreciate her as this adorable, lonely girl just looking for the right guy
(as opposed to the real "Madonna" that she is). And let's not forget
Benjamin Bratt, who also looks great in this film (you go, Julia!) and
delivers his scenes with charm. And even more importantly, what about the
bodies on these guys, eh? I mean, is it just me, or were Rupert and Ben
competing for the best six-packs here? Wow. I am Jack impressed.</P>
<P>All in all, a very good movie that does a decent job of balancing its humor,
its drama, its love and its romance. Go in, enjoy it and if you're one to
shed a tear or two every now and then, I suggest you bring some tissues. Now
allow me to go put on some "Frank".</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Madonna's full name is Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone. She recently dropped
out of the lead role for the 1999 movie MUSIC OF MY HEART, a part which
eventually went to Meryl Streep and nabbed her another Oscar nomination.
Rupert Everett is gay in real life and has twice been nominated for a Golden
Globe award. The first one was for his supporting role in MY BEST FRIEND'S
WEDDING, and the more recent one was for his performance in AN IDEAL HUSBAND
(7.5/10).
Benjamin Bratt is probably best known of late as being Julia Roberts' better
half, but he's been in the biz since around 1988. His mom is a Peruvian
Indian from Lima, but he grew up in San Francisco.
Actor Michael Vartan was born in Normandie, France and speaks both English
and French fluently. He began his professional movie career in French films,
his first was called "Un Homme et deux Femmes" (One man and two women). He
also turned down a role in SCREAM 3 (7.5/10) because he wanted to take his
career in a different direction.
Director John Schlesinger was born in London, England and is probably best
remembered as the director of the 1969 film MIDNIGHT COWBOY, which earned
him an Academy Award for Best Director.
Neil Patrick Harris also plays a gay man in this movie. Doogie Howser, M.D.
'Nuff said.
Screenwriter Tom Ropelewski was last credited as writer/director of the film
LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW.
This working title for this film was THE RED CURTAIN.</P>
