 October Sky (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris
Cooper and Laura Dern.</PRE>
<P> The joy of imagination lies in its lack of limitations.</P>
<P> You can toil in the deepest, darkest coal mine in West Virginia and still
dream of reaching the stars.</P>
<P> To transform imagination into reality takes determination, self-confidence
and the courage to listen only to that inner voice, tuning out the
nay-sayers all about you.</P>
<P> This is the lesson of October Sky, a genuine, inspirational story based on
the life of rocket scientist Homer Hickam.</P>
<P> Hickam was born and raised in one of those coal mining towns that dot West
Virginia. In Coalwood, a young man had only two choices - play sports well
enough to earn a college scholarship or, after graduation, take your place
in the mines digging out the coal while breathing in the deadly black dust.</P>
<P> But Hickam and three of his friends found inspiration as well as an escape
by watching the skies.</P>
<P>The year was 1957, and the Soviet Union had just launched Sputnik. What
director Joe Johnston's film, based on Hickam's autobiography, Rocket Boys,
does so well is capture the moods created by this momentous achievement.</P>
<P> Many felt paranoia, that the Soviets would use this satellite to rain
nuclear missiles down on the United States. Others felt nothing, that space
was, well, just space, so let the Soviets play around all they wanted. We
had problems here on Earth to solve.</P>
<P> Others, though, were visionaries. They could see ahead, that Sputnik was
just the first small toehold into a journey into a vast unknown that could
ultimately culminate with men escaping the confines of their planet.</P>
<P> The success of Sputnik fired the imagination of Hickam and his friends,
Quentin, Roy Lee and O'Dell.</P>
<P> Using scraps and bits and pieces of metal and other materials found in
their basements, garages and around Coalwood, the four set out to build and
launch a rocket of their own.</P>
<P> After many failures, and much derision from townspeople, they succeed.</P>
<P> Their idealistic teacher, a sturdy, compassionate performance by Laura
Dern, enters them in a science fair, which they win. This victory propels
Homer and his friends to the nationals.</P>
<P> But October Sky is more than a story about four young men and their
obsession with rockets. It is also the tale of a father and son, trying to
bridge a generation and cultural gap created by the environment around
them.</P>
<P> John Hickam is a mine official, who is proud of the work he has done. His
family has been coal miners for generations, and he sees nothing wrong with
his youngest son following in his footsteps.</P>
<P> He sees Homer's devotion to his rocketry as a mere hobby, a passing fad.
The older Hickam doubts his son's ability to use his newly acquired
knowledge to escape what he sees as the boy's destiny.</P>
<P> This is a gulf young Homer must overcome with the same grit and
determination he applies to his rocket experiments.</P>
<P> Lewis Colick's script cannot avoid all the cliches inherent in such
situations, but he brings such sincerity to the proceedings that you tend
to overlook them, even as you realize you've run across them before.</P>
<P> The true find of October Sky is young Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer. This is
young Gyllenhaal's breakthrough performance, much as A Boy's Life set
Leonardo DiCaprio on his course.</P>
<P> Gyllenhaal's Homer is fierce in his doggedness to succeed, yet touchingly
vulnerable. He is driven not by ego but by seeking the approval of his
father.</P>
<P> More than anything else, he wants his father to recognize that what he is
trying to do is worthwhile.</P>
<P> Chris Cooper, who has given some fine performances, notably in John
Sayles' Lone Star, is touching, unyielding and exudes the strength of a
Sequoia as John Hickam. But he also is wise enough to accept and embrace
his son's chosen path in order not to lose him.</P>
<P> Mark Isham contributes a strong score that helps keep the film at an even
pace, while Fred Murphy's cinematography captures the grime and dirt that
covers Coalwood.</P>
<P>October Sky is a bit schmaltzy and predictable. But that shouldn't keep
anyone from enjoying this true-life saga of a boy whose dreams could not be
confined by either gravity or convention.</P>
