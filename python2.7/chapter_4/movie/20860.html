<P>   Though some Catholics groups are tearing into this film,
considering it as scandalous as "Priest" and more so
than "Stigmata," "Dogma" is firmly pro-belief.  There is indeed
a God and there are angels and demons, according to writer-
director Kevin Smith.  Yet you can't discount the
apprehension that churchgoing Catholics and the Catholic
clergy feel about the ideas embraced by Smith in his fourth
film, which encompasses a grandiose theme you'd not expect
from a man whose previous works were contained in limited
spheres.  Those films include a $27,000 wonder about a day
in the life of a convenience store clerk and video palace bum
("Clerks"); a flop about a bunch of friends, largely geeks, who
hang around a suburban mall ("Mallrats"); and his best
feature, "Chasing Amy," about a comic book artist who meets
and falls for an attractive, personable female and pursues her
even when he discovers that she's gay.</P>
<P>   Like Rupert Wainwright, whose recent film "Stigmata" 
underscores the idea that "the kingdom of God is within you"
(thus discounting the need for showy Church rigmarole),
Kevin Smith in no way discounts the existence of God.  He
does, however, take aim against dogma, against absolute
convictions, and comically sends up the seriousness with
which religious institutions practice their creeds.  "God has a
sense of humor," he states in a written preamble to the
movie, "or how else to explain His creation of the platypus?" 
As one character in the story essentially holds, we should be
celebrating our religions, not treating them as a somber affair.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Cinemascope (though without a whole lot of
filmmaking style despite its special effects), "Dogma" opens
with a bang as three sinister-looking young hockey players
attack and beat an old man to a pulp as he watches the
ocean waves on a New Jersey boardwalk.  At the same time,
New Jersey Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) announces to a
small group of parishioners and reporters that he will put into
motion a campaign to help revive interest in the Church,
whose attendance has been steadily falling.  At this point
Smith offers the first of many sophomoric, flat-out unworkable
sight gags, as Glick unveils a statue of Jesus not in the
traditional posture of crucifixion, but with a wink, a thumbs-up,
and an arm extended to greet a following.  (Other crude
humor, some which could more than compete with the
vulgarities of Smith's "Mallrats," include an image of a man
reading Hustler magazine in his pew; a walking poop demon
which emerges from a toilet bowl and which represents the
waste products which have fallen from people who have been
crucified; a naked angel's falling from the heavens and
landing with a thud on a highway; and a talk between a hip
young woman and a nun in which the sister becomes
convinced she should get a man and have fun.</P>
<P>   The story centers on Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a lapsed
Catholic working in an abortion clinic, who has been strangely
chosen by the angel Metatron (Alan Rickman) to save the
world from extinction.  Two cast-out angels, Bartleby (Ben
Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon), exiled for a millennium to
Wisconsin, are eager to go back home to heaven.  They have
found a loophole that would enable them to do so.  They
need only walk through an arch in a small New Jersey church
and they'll be on their way, but since this loophole proves
God's fallibility, the world would be destroyed.  Obviously 
these angels must be stopped.</P>
<P>   Holy figures and demonic forms mix freely with human
beings in this wildly imaginative movie that uses Monty
Python grotesqueries, some crude and others divine; and a
barrage of one liners, mostly plastic but with some treasures.
Among the characters whose mission is redundant is Jason
Lee as the diabolical Azrael, who looks like Tom Wolfe when
sporting a large white hat but whose fiendish roots are
unclouded each time he removes his panama to reveal two
small horns.  Chris Rock gets to spout old-hat raillery such as
his insistence that though he is the 13th Apostle, he is
unmentioned in the New Testament because he is black,
while in a ten-second role a clerk at an intercity bus terminal
informs some ticketbuyers that all seats to New Jersey have
been sold for the day: "Never underestimate the power of the
Garden State."</P>
<P>   Just two performers stand out in this free-for-all whose
ultimate purport, "Belief is bad because it causes divisions
and warfare, while ideas are good because they are
changeable," is belied by an actual appearance from God
(Alanis Morissette).  One is Kevin Smith regular Jason
Mewes as the youthful, altogether dense young man who
takes the miracles he sees in stride, who gets to proposition
Bethany throughout the movie, asking whether she'd have
sex with him if she knew the world would end in five minutes. 
Though he spouts the f-word more than virtually any other
character in a non-Smith movie, each time he articulates the
term he draws laughs.  The other is Linda Fiorentino, so
remarkable in her role as a femme fatale in "The Last
Seduction," who does her best to cement a thoroughly
undisciplined bedlam as a woman who regains her faith after
discovering that she is a great-great-great-great-great
grandniece of Jesus Christ.  Perhaps the best scene in the
film, however, is one that does not involve the obvious use of
other-worldly forms.  When Bartleby and Loki invade a
corporate board room, they hilariously point out the
indiscretions of all but one well-heeled member of these film
studio suits--people who have profaned their trade for eons
by plying their films onto an altogether too undemanding
public, now condemned as well for making their families
miserable.</P>
<P>   What this meandering film needs is a good editor.  135
minutes of largely undisciplined muddle is too much to ask,
even of an audience perfectly willing to accept what some
would consider its blasphemous nature.  Kevin Smith needs
to reign in some of the effects he uses simply for generating
cheap laughs in favor of a more focused narrative.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 135 minutes.  (C) 1999
