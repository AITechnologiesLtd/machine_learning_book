<PRE>                                    THE VAN
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>

<P>These passions enrich the lives of the Irish residents of Barrytown, a
fictional working-class Dublin neighborhood realized by writer Roddy Doyle.
His "Barrytown trilogy" of films began with "The Commitments" (a slick,
Alan Parker-helmed musical production), then continued with "The Snapper"
and now "The Van," both directed by Stephen Frears.  "The Van" continues
the hilarious tone of number two, this time with a story of two good
friends making a go of a lunchtruck business.</P>
<P>Contemplating a potential product, Larry (Colm Meaney) brings a
batter-dipped, deep-fried sausage to his wife in bed and asks her how they
make them.  "I don't think they make them," Mary (Caroline Rothwell)
replies, squinting at the grizzled, yellow piece of matter that
approximates a corndog on a really bad day.  "They just find them."</P>
<P>Frears is very much at home with the material.  An interesting director who
has graduated from gritty British beginnings ("My Beautiful Laundrette,"
"Sammy and Rosie Get Laid") to high-gloss Hollywood costume dramas
("Dangerous Liaisons," "Mary Reilly"), Frears still finds the time to work
on smaller projects that interest him.  With "The Van," the director
confidently guides Doyle's daffy tale, capturing all of the writer's
delightfully colorful language.  "Hey, you with the head," Larry says to
one customer.  "What do you want?"  "World peace," kids the young slouch.
"You're barred!"</P>
<P>Eric Clapton also contributes to the film's production, co-writing and
playing guitar on the evocative score.</P>
<P>"The Van" opens with Bimbo (Donal O'Kelly) finding himself "made redundant"
from the baking job he's held all his life.  Not content to simply pick up
a weekly dole check like his friend Larry, Bimbo seizes an opportunity to
be his own boss in the form of a run-down, engineless, grease-encrusted
"chipper" van that, on inspection, "looks like the inside of a leper."
Bimbo convinces Larry to go into business with him, and after several
hosings, scrapings, and coatings of paint, "Bimbo's Burger's" is born.  The
film then centers on the relationship between Bimbo and Larry, previously
men of leisure, and how their partnership presents new challenges to these
fast--and fast food--friends.</P>
<P>Larry and Bimbo don't subscribe to our American values of hygiene and
health consciousness, overlooking various code violations such as kicking
raw chipped potatoes into buckets and accidentally tossing Pampers into the
fry-o-lator.  "The Van" is so in-your-face greasy that you can almost feel
the whiteheads puckering under your skin while you're watching it--it's
easy to see why deep-fried Snickers bars were once a big hit across the
water!  Meaney's pickled beetroot complexion adds to the experience, and
many times in the film its spattered with hot lard.  "Jay-sus!"  (The swear
box is always full in Larry's house.)  Meaney is at his best playing
blustery, blood-vessel bursting Dubliners like Larry.  When Larry is forced
to wear a suit and tie, either for Christmas dinner or to go out to a wine
bar, he looks like a garden gnome.</P>
<P>"The Van" has ample opportunities for melodramatic subplots but sticks to
its guns.  Every time the two men fall out and heaviness threatens, they
resolve their differences over pints (make that imperial gallons) of stout.
The relationship between Larry and Bimbo is fresh and genuinely touching;
this is a film as much about friendship as it is about working class values
(Bimbo has a work ethic; Larry has an attitude).</P>
<P>In a deeper vein, both men have marriages that are uncommonly important in
their lives.  The wives' roles, while secondary in the film, provide depth
and charm to the project.  While the men faff and fuss, Mary and Maggie
(Ger Ryan) look on, providing a calming and steadying influence.</P>
<P>While the ending of "The Van" may seem a little anti-climactic, the journey
to that point is very funny, with just a smattering of real poignancy.</P>
