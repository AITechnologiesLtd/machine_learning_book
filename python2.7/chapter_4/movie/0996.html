<PRE>                               GUILTY BY SUSPICION
                       A film review by James David Nicoll
                        Copyright 1991 James David Nicoll</PRE>
<P>     Rarely in these days of socialist Big Government, does one get to
see a movie that is daring enough to support true American values.
GUILTY BY SUSPICION is such a movie.</P>
<P>     The plot is based on the well-known (but oft distorted) patriotic
actions of HUAC (The House Un-American Affairs Committee) in the 1950s,
when a Hollywood rotten with Communists and Liberal Fellow Travellers
was purged of its socialist toxins.  Robert De Niro plays one such commie
writer, who returns from a European trip (The Soviet Union, I need not
point out, is in Europe) and is asked by his employers to cooperate with
HUAC in its crusade against the corrupters of America.  De Niro's
character refuses this very reasonable request, and over the next two
hours, is smashed like the communist filth he is.</P>
<P>     I particularly enjoyed the careful and thorough case HUAC assembles
against De Niro.  We are shown he has friends like:</P>
<P>     An alcoholic woman judged *unfit* to raise her child, who kills
herself (a mortal sin!) after a pathetic binge.  I need not point out
that a woman who can't raise her own offspring is a crime against human
nature.  The family is (no matter what the perfumed homosexuals of
Hollywood might claim) the basis of all human civilisation!</P>
<P>     An obese "comedy" writer who can neither control his craving for
food not his craving for approval from his socialist friends, who
*refuses* to testify to a *Congressional Committee of the United States
of America*!</P>
<P>     De Niro's wife, a communist *teacher*, whose access to the pure
minds of American Youth is rightly taken away.  She is shown undermining
the USA's defenses in one telling scene.  She and De Niro are *divorced*
(The usual Hollywood serial polygamy, no doubt!) but later in the
movie, he is shown *living* with her.  What kind of an example must they
set for their child; two single adults living together outside the
bounds of matrimony!</P>
<P>     De Niro's character is shown to be paranoid when he attacks a man
and his wife while they are out enjoying American Free Enterprise!
Clearly, the anticipation of the Stalinistic purges that *would* have
swept the USA if not for HUAC eroded his mind!  </P>
<P>     These are just *some* of the examples of moral corruption HUAC has
to deal with in this film.  They succeed in sniffing out communism in
cases a normal untrained observer would have mistaken as perfectly
harmless or even as *Pro-American*!</P>
<PRE>     Rarely has a film dared to show the HUAC As It Was!  This is one
film that so dares, and it make this reviewer *proud* to be American!!!
This is a film made in America, by Americans, for Americans!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>     What, you think I'd post this without a disclaimer?  Tee Hee.  Just
a joke, folks; apologies to those who took it seriously.  Inspired by a
comment by a friend, and a conversation I eavesdropped on.</P>
