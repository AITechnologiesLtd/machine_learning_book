<P>     On stage, THE NUTCRACKER is marvelous entertainment, despite the
$30-plus price of a ticket.  As a movie, a great deal of the exuberance
is washed away, leaving behind a pale shell of the live production.
Those seeing the story in person experience a spectacle; those who
settle for the inside of a darkened theater get culture.</P>
<P>     For those not familiar with the story, THE NUTCRACKER presents the
magical, dreamlike Christmas Eve of a little girl named Marie (Jessica
Lynn Cohen), who is escorted through various wondrous realms by a
prince (Macaulay Culkin), culminating in a grand gala in the Hall of
the Sugarplum Fairy (Darci Kistler).  There is a great deal of dancing,
some of it spectacular, with everything unfolding to the strains of
Tchaikovsky's unparalleled score.</P>
<P>     The main problem with the movie is that it opts to present a
relatively mundane version of the stage production.  Utilizing almost
none of the advantages offered by the medium of film, THE NUTCRACKER
stumbles where it should soar.  There isn't any way for a motion
picture to  effectively capture the feeling of watching a performance
live, so this presentation should have given its audience something
that can't be experienced during the stage show.  It doesn't, and
therein lies THE NUTCRACKER's chief flaw.</P>
<P>     The pacing is uneven, with the first half of the film moving like
molasses.  During this section, there's a lot of on-stage posturing,
but little dancing.  The change for the better comes when the setting
shifts to the Hall of the Sugarplum Fairy.  Even given the confines of
the screen, THE NUTCRACKER bursts to life at this point.</P>
<P>     With a G-rating, THE NUTCRACKER is suitable for viewers of all
ages, but I wonder how many of the younger members of the audience will
get restless during what is, in essence, ninety minutes of classical
music and ballet.  I know that at age seven, I would have.  "Know thy
children" is the best maxim to apply; those with short attention spans
will probably start to fidget before the half-way point.</P>
<P>     Director Emile Ardolino (DIRTY DANCING, SISTER ACT) leaves THE
NUTCRACKER as his final motion picture--he died of AIDS on Saturday,
November 20 at the age of 50.  Unfortunately, this is far from his best
work.  The direction is rarely inspired, and there are numerous
occasions when the camerawork lets the audience down by choosing an
ill-timed closeup instead of a wide-angled shot.  Ardolino's attempts
to breathe life into his screen version are too-often unsuccessful.</P>
<P>     The cast, mostly comprised of members of the New York City Ballet,
is excellent ... with one exception:  Macaulay Culkin.  Included more for
his name than anything else, Culkin is barely adequate, and the
annoying smirk he wears makes his presence progressively less
bearable.  Jessica Lynn Cohen, on the other hand, gives a tremendously
appealing portrayal of Marie.</P>
<P>     The saving grace of this screen adaptation of THE NUTCRACKER is
that the source material is so good that it can survive even a flat
interpretation.  The unfortunate thing is that with a little more verve
and imagination, this NUTCRACKER could have become one of the all-time
classic holiday films.  Instead, it's just another motion picture
opening on Thanksgiving weekend 1993.</P>
