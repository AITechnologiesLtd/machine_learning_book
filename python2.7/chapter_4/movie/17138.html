<PRE>                             WING COMMANDER
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                     Copyright 1999 Christopher Null

<PRE>     You've played the game, now see the movie.  Right?</PRE>
<P>     Wrong-o.  I've never played the game aside from a 30-minute tour,
and now I wish I hadn't seen the movie, either.</P>
<P>     Come now, you say, it can't be that bad!  Wasn't WING COMMANDER a
highly-lauded, critically-acclaimed video game?  Maybe the STAR WARS of
the PC?  Sure.  But when you rid yourself of everything but the title
and the setting (redux: Humans at war with Kilrathi, an evil alien race
that look like walking walnuts with beards), you'll find you're high and
dry.</P>
<P>     How bad is WING COMMANDER?  Bad.  *Really* bad.  Throughout most of
the film, my advance-screening theater was filled with the merry sounds
of laughter.  Alas, there are no (intentional) jokes on film. 
(Disclaimer: Said laughter does not count those who had fallen asleep.) 
Not only does the plot stink, but WING COMMANDER has some of the worst
dialogue this side of SHOWGIRLS.</P>
<P>     The marketing ploy behind WING COMMANDER is obvious, and I'll
outline the sad history for you so you can get a sense for it....  20th
Century Fox nabs rights to successful video game for crossover hit
(MORTAL KOMBAT, the movie, was hugely successful)-maybe even a
franchise!  But isn't Mark Hamill getting old?  Replace him with some
young, unknown studs and draw the teen crowd!  It'll be cheap!  Uh-oh...
movie's done and it *is* cheap... in every way imaginable.  Shelve the
movie.  Fast-forward a few years... uh-oh again! - Prinze and Lillard
are, surprise, big stars!  Release movie with big ad campaign, touting
the newly idolized heroes.  Teens go nuts!  Score!</P>
<PRE>     I hear you squirming in your seat.</PRE>
<PRE>     I'm throwing it half a star.</PRE>
<PRE>     Out of pity.</PRE>
