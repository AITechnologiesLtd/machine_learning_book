<P>"When the Party's Over" really surprised me. Renting the film because of the 
impressive cast, but not actually expecting much out of it, what I found was 
an, overall, undiscovered gem that most people probably have not even heard 
of, but it really is in video stores, just waiting to be rented. Another 
movie about "twentysomethings in the '90s," but made in 1991 before the Gen-X 
feature film explosion, "When the Party's Over" includes fascinating, 
multi-layered characters and an engaging story, and is easily worthy the 
price of a rental.</P>
<P>Set in Los Angeles, four friends--businesswoman MJ (Rae Dawn Chong), feminist 
artist Amanda (Sandra Bullock), charity worker Frankie (Elizabeth Berridge), 
and struggling actor Banks (Kris Kamm)--share a place together. MJ is 
beginning to wonder if she will ever find someone to love, as her days are 
filled with either work or emotionless one night stands. Constantly taking 
her friends for granted, but always apologetic afterwards, she also is 
currently having an affair with Taylor (Brian McNamara), who is seriously 
involved and in love with the sweet, caring Frankie. Frankie, meanwhile, is 
in the middle of creating a giant mural in an urban neighborhood, having made 
a friend with Mario (Raymond Cruz), who lives there, but fearing for the 
residents' lives, as a drive-by shooting seems to occur almost every night. 
And last, Amanda has sworn off dating for awhile, unable to deal with the 
pain that inevitably comes with it, choosing instead to just be with her 
friends and her teenage brother, Willie (Michael Landes), who is always 
hanging around her to get away from his unsatisfying home life. One day while 
at a party, the curiously-named Alexander Midnight (Fisher Stevens) first 
comes on to her with a seemingly corny pick-up line ("I'm positive we've met 
before...in a past life"), but soon she discovers that Alexander is 
completely sincere and, for once, interested in her, not sex.</P>
<P>It's mindboggling why "When the Party's Over" fell through the cracks, 
obtaining nothing more than a limited, and brief, theatrical run before 
heading to video. Maybe it is because now-movie star Sandra Bullock was a 
then-nobody, or more likely, it is because distrubutor Live Entertainment was 
going through financial troubles during the 1991-1992 time period. Either 
way, it desperately deserves to be noticed, and marks not only a mature, 
affirming screenplay by Ann Wycoff, but several standout, possibly 
Oscar-caliber performances. </P>
<P>Most captivating of all is MJ, played by Chong in one of her last substantial 
roles (before she, sadly, has resorted to direct-to-video action-oriented 
junk). MJ is not a bad person, regardless of if she uses her friends. She 
loves them all dearly, but is plagued by self-involvement, jumping from one 
guy to the next and only gaining interest in the men she knows she can't 
have, such as Taylor. MJ knows she has a problem, and is often keeping Amanda 
up through all hours of the night discussing her life.</P>
<P>In one of her very first feature film roles, Bullock gives one of her best 
performances to date, ranking right up there with her scene-stealing work in 
1993's "The Thing Called Love" and 1994's "Speed." Bullock's Amanda is given 
the chance to have two memorable relationships in the film, both very telling 
and honest--one with her teen brother who, in one of the more touching 
scenes, explains to him that she loves him more than anything, would do 
anything for him, but that he can't move in with her because he has to live 
at home with their father; and the other with Alexander Midnight, which 
slowly but surely builds up to a sweet, innocent romance. Fisher Stevens is 
another standout as Alexander, who is such a refreshingly original character 
you almost can't believe how genuine he is in his feelings.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Berridge, previously seen in a number of films, including one of my 
all-time favorites, 1986's "Smooth Talk," is truly poignant and effervescent 
as Frankie, who is hoping to get engaged with Taylor, unknowing that he has 
cheated on her. Frankie is a do-gooder, hoping to change the world in some 
way with her dedication to society, but is also having doubts about where 
everything is headed. She loves living in L.A., but is beginning to doubt if 
other better things might be passing her by.</P>
<P>All of these story threads boil down to an absolutely perfect conclusion, 
where everything comes together but, realistically, not everything is solved. 
Director Matthew Irmas is wise not to judge the characters, but to let the 
viewer decide what they think of each one of them, and due to the flawless 
last ten or so shots, ends everything on an emotional, thoughful note. "When 
the Party's Over," a serious-minded motion picture on the trials, 
tribulatons, and (good and bad) experiences of young adults, is not to be 
missed.</P>
