<P>     Over the last several years, director John Schlesinger, who once 
released fabulous films like MIDNIGHT COWBOY and SUNDAY, BLOODY SUNDAY, 
has developed an unfortunate tendency to make movies that border on 
unwatchable (PACIFIC HEIGHTS, EYE FOR AND EYE).  With COLD COMFORT FARM, 
a feature originally produced for British TV, Schlesinger has chosen a 
lighter, less demanding story that results in one of his most successful 
productions in recent memory.  There's nothing deep or meaningful to be 
unearthed in this feel-good comedy, but it nevertheless makes for solid 
entertainment.</P>
<P>     Using an almost-apologetically gentle satire, COLD COMFORT FARM 
parodies Merchant-Ivory films and their ilk.  Transpiring in the 1920s, 
the movie takes us to the dilapidated rural estate of Cold Comfort Farm, 
where recently-orphaned Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) has come to stay 
with distant relatives.  In some way, the Starkadders, who inhabit Cold 
Comfort, owe a debt to her father, but, while no one will say what it 
is, they agree to give her free room and board.  For her part, Flora 
intends to organize the untidy farm, as well as the lives of everyone 
who call it home.</P>
<P>     The residents of Cold Comfort Farm are a strange lot.  There's 
Judith Starkadder (Eileen Atkins), a middle-aged widow who continually 
prophesies disaster for her family.  There are her sons, Seth (Rufus 
Sewell), who loves movies, and Reuben (Ivan Kaye), who loves farming.  
Judith's brother, Amos (Ian McKellan), is a fire-and-brimstone preacher.  
Her mother, Ada Doom (Sheila Burrell), the Cold Comfort matriarch, 
remains locked in her room.  Also living in the house are Elfine (Maria 
Miles), a beautiful-but-flighty young woman who wants to marry a member 
of the gentry, and Adamsbreath (Freddie Jones), the family's faithful 
retainer.</P>
<P>     With comic efficiency, Flora sets to work giving each member of the 
Starkadder clan what they want.  There are no real characters here -- 
each member of the cast plays a certain period piece type to good 
effect.  We sympathize with the men and women of Cold Comfort Farm 
largely because of strong performances, not because they're written with 
any depth or breadth.  As is often true of satire, the people don't 
matter as much as the situations they're placed in.</P>
<P>     COLD COMFORT FARM is not a vicious lampoon.  The script cares about 
its characters and doesn't want to distance the audience.  Some of the 
best satire comes near the end, while the various subplots are reaching 
happy conclusions.  Schlesinger uses "Tara's Theme" from GONE WITH THE 
WIND to put the hilarious punctuation on a very funny scene.  This 
sequence, the movie's comic highlight, had me nearly doubled over with 
laughter.</P>
<P>     Kate Beckinsale, who made her movie debut as Hero in Kenneth 
Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, sparkles as Flora, bringing life and 
energy to this one-dimensional ersatz Jane Austen heroine.   The 
supporting performers are all good, with special mention going to Ian 
McKellan.  Here, acting the part of a preacher who speaks of nothing but 
hellfire and damnation, McKellan is both mesmerizing and undeniably 
funny.</P>
<P>     With its comic refrains, takeoffs on Hollywood happy endings and 
stuffy British storylines, and feather-light tone, COLD COMFORT FARM is 
an excellent source of late spring entertainment.  As was true of 1992's 
ENCHANTED APRIL,  this is the kind of movie that offers a vacation from 
the seriousness of reality and other, more "important" motion pictures.  
There may not be intellectual enrichment forthcoming, but there's 
undeniable pleasure to be gained from watching Flora bring warmth to 
COLD COMFORT FARM.</P>
