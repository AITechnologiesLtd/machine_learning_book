<P>Reduced to the video screen, its still a pleasure visiting Steven
Spielberg's The Lost World, a land where dinosaurs roam free, and wreak
havok. In the first few moments, in which a little girl is approached by a
little dinosaur ("What are you?...Some kind of bird?"), I worried that,
reduced to this size, his "popcorn" movie wouldn't work. By the time Ian
Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) reached the fabled island, I was sure of it. But
then, two T-Rexes began to nudge a trailer off a cliff...and I was hooked.
Many of the moments on the island are truly magical -- they don't -- can't
-- live up to anything out of King Kong. But they still engage you with all
your senses. This is a lush land, paradise, but, humans should not be here.
The mechanical creatures sputter out of bushes. And even if they aren't too
real, the atmosphere is so delicious, that you buy it. This film is a
sample of that land, and more. Returning to San Diego, we experience, in an
over-used term, a roller-coaster ride. Sheer exhilaration results from this
action packed hour and a half. By the end, we have learned that man
shouldn't mess with nature -- so, it remains a mystery that this sequel
doesn't suck. </P>

"Movies are really a kind of dream state, or like taking dope. And the
shock of walking out of the theatre into broad daylight can be terrifying.
I watch movies all the time, and I am also very bad at waking up."
