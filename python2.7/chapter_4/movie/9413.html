                  TWELFTH NIGHT: OR WHAT YOU WILL 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
            1  :-)  for a comic tale of crossed gender roles</PRE>
<P>Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Imogen Stubbs, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard E.
Grant, Ben Kingsley, Mel Smith, Imelda Staunton, Toby Stephens, Steven
Mackintosh, Nicholas Farrell Director: Trevor Nunn Screenplay: Trevor
Nunn based on the play by William Shakespeare</P>
<P>Shakespeare is a visionary. This comic tale of mistaken identities,
cross-dressing and love triangles is way ahead of its time. The Master
of mirth and mire has impeccable timing, when it comes to awkward
situation comedy. This is no exception.</P>
<P>Picture the scenario of almost identical twins, a he and a she who are
lost at sea. The she-twin, Viola, (Imogen Stubbs), survives and arrives
in a land where a Duke (Toby Stephens) is infatuated with the
neighbouring Countess (Helena Bonham Carter). Viola assumes the
personage of a male, and finds work as the Duke's steward, before
becoming his closest confidante. She is sent as a messenger of love from
the Duke to the Countess, and unwittingly becomes the Countess's object
of passion. At the same time Viola bares a secret love for the Duke.
Thus, forming a love triangle uncommon for its time.</P>
<P>Amusing moments of note. When Viola has her breasts strapped, an
absolute look of delight crosses her face. At the end of the day when
the breasts are finally unstrapped the look of absolute pain, is
replaced with a look of absolute relief. Sexual tensions mount as the
Countess loses any understanding of personal space, and literally throws
herself at Viola with every opportune moment. At the same time, Viola
unavoidably keeps intruding into the Duke's personal space at the most
inopportune moment i.e. when he's taking a bath and needing a scrub on
the back, or when listening to a minstrel, comes close enough to kiss.</P>
<P>Anybody with a sound mind could tell a man from a woman, especially back
in the days when hormonal therapy wasn't an option. Imogen Stubbs does
her best to be as manly as possible, but the low voice and wispy
moustache is as effective as trying to strap down her chest. Helena
Bonham Carter grows more enchanting as she grows older, and the rest of
the well known cast - Ben Kingsley, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard E. Grant
etc. play supporting roles of side characters, who remain confusingly
anonymous until midway through the movie. Again, it is the language of
Shakespeare, which remains the true winning element of this movie.</P>
