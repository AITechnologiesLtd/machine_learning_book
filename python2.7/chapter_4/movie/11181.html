<P>I hate the Spice Girls.  I hate how their music is so catchy that it sticks
in your head for days after hearing it.  I hate how they promote "Girl
Power," yet they dress scantily and pose nude for horny pubescent teenage
boys.  And I hate how they're all over the place, even though they have no
real talent.  Why I saw this movie is a really, really, really long story,
but I did, and one would think I'd despise every minute of it.  But...</P>
<P>Okay, I'm really ashamed of it, but I enjoyed it.  I mean, I admit it's a
really awful movie, a wannabe "Hard Day's Night" (no pun intended), filled
with excuses for them to act wacky as hell, and to provide the locale for
the ninth floor of hell desginated for every single person willing to do a
cheap ass cameo in a cheap ass movie.  The plot is such a mess that it's
terrible.  But I loved it.  Why?  Well...</P>
<P>For those of you who still don't know, the Spice Girls are a quintet of
british bimbos who were recruited to be the next "big thing" in the pop
scene world, and therefore sing really iritating songs that are
nevertheless catchy (after I first heard "Wannabe," I tried to get a
labotomy to remove the section of my brain that remembers every painful
note).  About a year after conquering America, releasing the number one
album of last year, they have a movie in an effort to make them the
faux-Beatles.</P>
<P>But their first movie is hardly "A Hard Day's Night," even if it lifts a
lot from it and drops it into their movie.  Here's a basic sketch of the
plot and see if it sounds familiar: the girls o' spice have a big concert
at Albert Hall, and the film chronicles a wacky week in their life prior to
this gig, including press conferences filled with boring people, boisterous
escapes from their schedule, a big cliff-hanger over whether they'll make
their concert or not, and bitching from their nervous manager Clifford
(Richard E. Grant).  Now, the plot of "A Hard Day's Night:" the Beatles
have a big concert and the film chronicles a wacky couple days in their
life prior to this gig, including press conferences filled with boring
people, boisterous escapes from their schedule, a big cliff-hanger over
whether they'll make their concert or not, and a lot of bitching from a
nervous TV manager, played by Victor Spinetti.</P>
<P>Of course, "Spice World" also lifts a lot from the second, wackier (and
funnier) film, "Help!," which was so weirdly comical, and so incoherent
that it was almost more enjoyable but hardly artier.  "Spice World" lifts a
lot from this one, including some wacky sub plots (one includes a sneaky
photographer played by Riff Raff himself, Richard O'Brien, trying to dig up
anything bad about them for a newspaper who wants to print bad news about
them), a surreal living style (how big is the inside of their bus?), and
some really weirdly funny sequences that may go way over the head of its
target audience (how many Spice Girls fans will understand the dream
sequence starring Hugh Laurie as a faux-Poirot?).</P>
<P>But what the film forgets is that "A Hard Day's Night" was deceptively
brilliant, and wonderfully organized, while "Help!" found the Beatles after
this more artier film and gave them the liscence to just go completely
wacky (Paul McCartney confessed that the plot of the film was determined by
which foreign places they wanted to visit).  "Spice World" tries to combine
these two elements, and comes out snake eyes with both of them.</P>
<P>This doesn't mean that this film is a disaster.  I, who hate the Spice
Girls, do confess that their best quality is their energy, and second is
their sense of humor.  They may suck musically and all, but at least they
don't take themselves seriously, and do what it is they do with a lot of
energy placed into it.  Songs like "Wannabe" and "Spice Up Your Life" are
awful tunes, but when seeing them performed they seem better due to what
the girls put into the act.  In this film, they do the same thing.</P>
<P>The film is really just a series of comic skits, some which are pretty bad,
and a lot which are pretty hilarious and admittingly joyful.  I couldn't
get into a bit where they escaped on a boat, or another one where they were
getting dance lessons from a hard-assed fruity army man (nice idea,
though), but bits like a movie idea proposed by the hilarious ex-"Kid in
the Hall" man Mark McKinney (currently rotting on "SNL") about a film
called "Spice Force Five" left me in stitches.  And the finale where they
try to make it to their concert is hilarious, only because as they're doing
this it is being narrated by McKinney to a suicidial Clifford.</P>
<P>Also, I found myself liking each of the Spice Girls.  I might hate their
act, but I couldn't help kinda loving all of them.  They're very likable
people, and each of them is presented with a distinct personality.  They
command the film nicely, making up for any really big problems with the
film itself.  And, my god, the cameos in this film!  This is fun just to
spot all the celebrity turn-ups, including Meat Loaf as a bus driver,
Shakespearean actor Richard Briers as a bishop, british comic actor Stephen
Fry as a condemning lawyer (getting the film's funniest line), Elvis
Costello as a bartender, and Roger Moore as "The Chief," the omniscent man
upstairs who strokes a pig, and spouts out numerous aphorisms to comic
effect (I think I'm the only critic who liked him).  And I can't be the
only one who just didn't recognize Bob Geldof at first, can I?  Or the one
who didn't automatically realize that the fat head of the villainous
newspaper (Barry Humphries) is really Dane Edna sans dress?</P>
<P>When I left "Spice World" it was the exact opposite of what happened when I
went in - which was "I cannot fucking believe I paid $7.50 to see 'Spice
World!'"  I came out with a big grin on my face, as I had seen a tacky yet
hysterical little flick that had won me over soon into its 93 minute
run-time.  Though I'm really not sure I'd ever see it again (at least for
any amount of cash - I mean, for $7.50 I coulda seen it thrice at a
suburbanite theater), it held my attention span for its full lenght, and
entertained me.  I know I'll be figuritively crucified for giving this film
a positive review, but it did manage to entertain me and by the finale, I
did like the Spice Girls a lot more than I did when I went in.  And that's
probably all those girls really really wanted (sorry for the bad joke).</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
