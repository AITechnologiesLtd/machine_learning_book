<P>   Some Irish movies travel well across the Atlantic, intriguing
Americans of all ethnic groups as much as they interest the
folks from Dublin to Galway.  "The Boxer" is just such a
picture.  On the other hand there are some movies whose
humor is so quiet, so inaccessible, that you wonder whether
they were made for anyone's enjoyment.  If "I Went Down"
and "Bulworth" opened at the same time in the theater of
Cork and Spigo, which picture do you think the townspeople
would see?</P>
<P>   "I Went Down" is meant to be taken as a cute illustration of
the Irish gift for gab, but the language is far from the poetry of
Sean O'Casey and is no match for the crisp dialogue of a Jim
Sheridan.  A mafia-style road comedy, the story is like a
theater piece for two with assorted oddball characters thrown
in to expand the dimensions.  Git (Peter McDonald), a
handsome, young, taciturn lad whose girl friend left him during
his six-year term in jail, roughs up a couple of gangsters who
are about to crush the fingers of his friend Anto (David
Wilmot).  The gang leader, Tom French (Tony Doyle) will
forgive him and release Anto if Git will gather up some money
for him and kidnap a man who has had an affair with French's
wife.  Bunny (Brendan Gleeson) is assigned to watch Git, and
during their time on the road this pair, at first mistrustful of
each other, become good friends.  Their camaraderie is
greatly aided while they hold Frank Grogan (Peter Caffrey) as
a hostage.  Frank tries to talk his way out of his restrained
position and almost succeeds in convincing his captors that
he is being held for a strictly personal reason, that of having
the affair with the gang boss. "Did you ever make love to a
gangster's wife?" he moans.  "It's like making love with the
angel of death looking over your shoulder..You can't enjoy
yourself."</P>
<P>   This observation is the wittiest in the film, which wouldn't be
so bad if writer-director Breathnach could have sustained the
merriment.  Breathnath portrays Git's appeal in zeroing in on
a one-night stand he enjoys with a local girl in a bar, but
despite the decent acting of the ensemble, "I Went Down" is
an indie that's just too unreachable.</P>
