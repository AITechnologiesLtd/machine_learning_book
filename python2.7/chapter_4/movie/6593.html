<P>"There are two kinds of mothers on the planet. The first kind thinks 
that every single thing their children do is perfect and their children 
are God's gift to the world. And then there's the other kind. [MOTHER] 
is about the other kind."
          -- Albert Brooks</P>
<P>     In discussing the pantheon of living American motion picture funny 
men, names like Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, Steve Martin, Robin 
Williams, and Eddie Murphy are likely to surface.  A man who's rarely 
mentioned, however, is Albert Brooks, one of this country's most 
underrated comics.  Brooks, who started his public life as a standup 
comedian before moving into writing, directing, and acting in feature 
films, has done screen work every bit as hilarious as any of the 
aforementioned names, and his latest effort, MOTHER, proves that he's 
quite capable of bouncing back from a failure (1994's THE SCOUT, which 
he co-wrote and starred in, but did not direct).</P>
<P>     In the formula-laden playground of modern comedies, MOTHER comes as 
a breath of fresh air.  Unlike most of 1996's so-called "laugh fests", 
this one relies on smart humor rather than slapstick, puns, and dumb 
jokes with quick payoffs.  Brooks doesn't use the AIRPLANE approach to 
comedy.  His films aren't loaded with hit-and-miss gags.  The 
director/writer strives for quality over quantity, and when he wants the 
audience to laugh, they generally do so.  </P>
<P>     MOTHER doesn't have much of a plot.  In fact, what little story 
there is functions mostly as a framing device for two good performances 
and a stream of rich, intelligent dialogue.  Brooks has a keen eye for 
comedy in normal, natural situations.  Much of the humor in this film 
works because we can relate to it.  Regardless of your race, class, or 
creed, many of the situations represented in MOTHER will have a familiar 
feel.</P>
<P>     Brooks plays John Henderson, a forty year old B-grade science 
fiction writer (his published books include PLANET SEVEN and PLANET 
EIGHT) who is going through his second divorce.  For John, this is only 
the latest in a long line of failed relationships.  In the words of a 
friend he meets at a bar (John C. McGinley), "You've gotta know what 
you're looking for [in a woman], and you don't have a clue."  After a 
great deal of soul-searching, John decides that to better understand 
women, he needs to investigate his strained relationship with his 
mother, Beatrice (Debbie Reynolds).  So, much to the surprise of his 
friends and his younger brother, Jeff (Rob Morrow), he decides to move 
back into his childhood home in Sausalito and live with her.  Thus 
begins an odyssey of mother/son bonding that not even John is prepared 
for.</P>
<P>     It would have been easy for Brooks' script (co-written by Monica 
Johnson) to treat Mrs. Henderson as a caricature.  Most comedies would 
have opted for that route, I think.  The result might have been funny, 
but it wouldn't have been as meaningful.  As the film progresses, 
Beatrice is allowed to fill out into a full-fledged character, complete 
with her own desires, dashed hopes, and simmering dreams.  We, like 
John, gradually recognize why she reacts to him the way she does.</P>
<P>     Although MOTHER boasts a host of hilarious one-liners, the best 
moments are the extended episodes that delve into everyday life.  One 
features John's attempt to start an intelligent conversation with a 
vacuous date (FRIENDS' Lisa Kudrow).  There are also the scenes with 
Mom:  a trip to the grocery store, an excursion through the mall, and an 
afternoon at the zoo.  All of these sequences could have been short, but 
Brooks allows them to develop and play out naturally, letting the comedy 
bubble to the surface rather than escape in one sudden, contrived 
explosion.</P>
<P>     While Brooks is solid and likable as John, the scene-stealer is 
Debbie Reynolds, who is taking on her first starring role since the 
'70s.  Reynolds, who is probably best remembered as the leading lady in 
SINGING IN THE RAIN, sparkles as Beatrice, bringing a quality to this 
role that will make some motherly aspect instantly recognizable to 
nearly everyone in the audience.  Rob Morrow (LAST DANCE), an actor of 
limited range and passable talent who hasn't impressed me since his 
television to film transition, is well-cast as John's obnoxious, shallow 
brother.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, MOTHER has a weak beginning and ending, but the 
material in between is what makes it worth watching.  This probably 
isn't the funniest or most inventive comedy of the year, but it gets 
high marks in both categories.  From the parody of Simon and Garfunkel's 
"Mrs. Robinson" to the scenes of Beatrice attempting to work a video-
phone, MOTHER represents more than just another carbon-copy, unfunny 
comedy.</P>
