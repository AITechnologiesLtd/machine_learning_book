<P>"What exactly is crazy?" This is one of the provocative questions running 
throughout James Mangold's "Girl, Interrupted," based on Susanna Kaysen's 
1993 memoir about her experiences staying in a psychiatric ward in the late 
'60s. It has been documented that star Winona Ryder has been passionate about 
a film adaptation of Kaysen's intriguing story (despite her book not 
following any sort of narrative) for several years, and it was only until she 
found a home at Columbia Pictures and collaborated with director James 
Mangold (1996's "Heavy") that everything fell into place. The delays turn out 
to be well worth the wait, as the picture is one filled with sincerity, 
frankness, and perception, a highly respectable, realistic endeavor that 
treats Kaysen's story with the utmost respect.</P>
<P>Susanna (Winona Ryder) is an average 18-year-old who has just recently 
graduated from high school. Unlike most of her classmates, who are set on 
what college to go to and what to study, Susanna wants nothing more than to 
write, something that is often scoffed at by those she tells. After a 
half-hearted suicide attempt in which she downs vodka with a bottle of 
aspirin, Susanna's parents literally pack her bags and send her on her way to 
Claymoore, a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts, where she is to stay 
until the doctor believes she is cured. She checks herself in without giving 
it a thought, but the unjust thing is that Susanna doesn't seem to belong 
there--the closest problem she has that resembles a disorder seems to be a 
bunch of teen angst built up inside.</P>
<P>At Claymoore, she, at first, is able to see she is dissimilar to most of the 
other residents, but the line between well and sick is gradually blurred when 
she sparks friendships with several of the other girls living there, 
including Georgina (Clea Duvall), her roommate, who is called a pathological 
liar and has a fondness for "The Wizard of Oz"; the sweet-natured Polly 
(Elisabeth Moss), who once lit half of her face on fire in an attempt to get 
rid of a rash; and the introverted Daisy (Brittany Murphy), who has an eating 
disorder involving only consuming her father's rotisserie chickens. Soon 
after Susanna has arrived, in waltzes Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a long-time 
patient and sociopath who has once again been caught after she attempted to 
escape. Susanna and Lisa are very different individuals, but they form a 
close bond, balancing each other's diverse personalities off of one another. 
Because Susanna is known to have slept with two men, her psychiatrist 
(Vanessa Redgrave) believes she is promiscuous, something that bothers 
Susanna because the standards are so altered between the sexes on who is 
labeled, more or less, a slut. Worrying her clueless parents, who clearly 
have more psychological problems than their daughter, Susanna is also 
diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder. Claymoore is a 
discouraging place, as it becomes increasingly apparent, because the people 
with the major problems are the staff, not the patients, many of which were 
obviously stuck in the institution to get out of their wealthy family's hair.</P>
<P>As far as the story and developments in the characters go, "Girl, 
Interrupted" treads on overly familiar ground, and the film is almost never 
anything other than predictable. What the picture lacks in freshness, 
however, it more than makes up for it in the outstanding performances across 
the board, and in the sympathetic, but not sugarcoated, portrayal of the 
inmates. </P>
<P>Despite the notices that Angelina Jolie has garnered for her performance here 
(including a Golden Globe nomination), Winona Ryder matches her in every way. 
Both are superb young actresses, but since Jolie's Lisa is the more outward 
and flashy character, she is inevitably the one whose talent jumps more 
quickly off the screen. In contrast, Ryder is subtle and quiet, but all the 
more genuinely real because of it, and the internal conflicts you sense she 
is going through are something many teenagers and twentysomethings will be 
able to identify with. Since Ryder is the one we follow throughout the story 
(she appears in every scene), without a captivating presence in the role, the 
film would have collapsed under its own weight, but she more than handles the 
responsibilities handed to her. </P>
<P>In a smaller turn, Brittany Murphy is the clear standout, in a performance of 
almost insufferable pain, as Daisy, who is checked out of the hospital by her 
father and given an apartment to live in, despite her obviously not being 
prepared to face the outside world. In the most powerful sequence in the 
film, Susanna and Lisa run away from Claymoore and travel to stay with Daisy 
for the night, but things take a turn for the worse when Lisa second-guesses 
exactly who Daisy is--a depressed, frightened girl who is not well enough to 
be taking care of herself, and who is all set up for a very serious fall. The 
heartbreaking thing is, Lisa is right, and Daisy knows it. Murphy, usually 
appearing in comedic roles (1995's "Clueless," 1999's "Drop Dead Gorgeous"), 
successfully invades her memorably tragic character with equal measures of 
insecurity and despair.</P>
<P>Supporting parts are all impressive, as well, with Clea Duvall eliciting a 
sweetness to her ambivalent role as Georgina, and Elisabeth Moss affecting as 
the regretful Polly, who knows there is no chance of anyone falling in love 
with her because of her disfigured face. Whoopi Goldberg evokes an important 
amount of warmth as the most caring nurse in the wing, Valerie, while Jared 
Leto, as Susanna's past boyfriend, only makes a few fleeting appearances in 
an underwritten character, but is fine with what he is given.</P>
<P>The confrontational climax, set in the basement of the hospital, threatens to 
cross the line into melodrama, and it does very briefly, but is saved by the 
assurance of the actresses. Still, a less commotional, more refined finale 
might have been the wiser choice, as it would have been staying more in the 
spirit of what had succeeded it.</P>
<P>An improvement over his uneven 1997 drama, "Copland," James Mangold excels in 
the area of attracting notable talent and placing the principal cast in 
commendably juicy roles. But more than anything, "Girl, Interrupted" gains 
much of its footing from the way in which it loyally follows Susanna through 
the one year in her life which altered the way she viewed the world. The film 
persuasively argues that Susanna probably never had anything wrong with her 
in particular, as she was just going through a natural stage in her growing 
up process. Yet, in a strange way, that year at Claymoore changed her life 
all for the better, and, in a sense, aided in the self-discovery of who she 
really was. For as Susanna states in voice-over as she is looking back at 
what she was going through in the period of '67-'68, "maybe I was just a 
girl, interrupted."  </P>
