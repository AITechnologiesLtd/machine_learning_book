Review:        ENEMY OF THE STATE</PRE>
<P>Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet, Regina King,
et al  </P>
<PRE>Directed by: Tony Scott</PRE>
<PRE>Review by: Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>Will Smith is the star of this movie mainly because he's the only one who
has more than a couple of scenes. The exception is Gene Hackman who
appears halfway into the story.   The plight of Robert Dean [Will Smith]
is one that could happen to anyone.  That's what makes this movie so
scary.  It's not the explosions, or the car chases.  It's the realization
that our privacy is in danger.  In this age of computers and advanced
electronics, our lives are open books-if you are the one who knows where
to find the book.</P>
<P>Dean, a young practicing attorney, is in the middle of a law suit
involving an Italian `enforcer' who threatens his life because of evidence
Dean has that could send him back to prison.  At the same time, another
plot is beginning to unfold, and through a set of circumstances, Dean
becomes an unknowing player in a political battle involving the `Right to
Privacy'.  He learns first hand just how susceptible we have all become. 
At first it's small things like having his credit card refused at a hotel.
Soon, as the conspiracy grows, he realizes that the Italian group is not
capable of such extensive harassment. </P>
<P>Jon Voight seems to be creating a new image for himself as the epitome of
upper-class corruption.   He has that trustworthy-but-misleading look.  As
he's playing a political figure, it makes you wonder about our own
security.   Lisa Bonet and Regina King are the two women in Dean's life. 
Lisa is a former girl friend, from his days at Georgetown.  Regina is his
wife and mother of their 8-year-old son.  The story is so well written
that, at times, I wasn't sure which female would end up with him.
Gene Hackman, the co-star, is wonderful.  He's totally believable.  It's
just a shame that it takes so long for him to appear. The explanation
about his past is told too quickly and, at the end, you're still a bit in
the dark about him.</P>
<P> Other cast members are excellent in their roles although most of them
have nothing more than cameos.  It makes you wonder why some are given
star billing and others are not.</P>
<P>The movie isn't bad.  It's an OK way to spend a couple of hours.  But
it's neither the actors nor the plot that you'll remember.  You'll just
keep asking yourself how much privacy you really have.  It's worth seeing
for that reason alone.  I give it a B-.  And, I would watch it again,
probably on TV.</P>
