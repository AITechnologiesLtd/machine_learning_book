<PRE>WILD THINGS (1998)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix.  
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix.  </PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Written by Stephen Peters.  
Directed by John McNaughton.  
Starring Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Bill
Murray, Robert Wagner.  
Rated R (contains nudity, profanity, and violence)  116 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  A wild teen-aged girl with an IQ around 200 manipulates a beefy
guidance counselor, a determined police detective, two trial lawyers, the
U.S. judicial system, the news media, a millionaire playgirl, and her
supersexy teen-aged daughter in an elaborate scheme to swindle millions of
dollars.  </P>
<P>Comments:  For this week, I have decided to review a movie currently
playing in theaters rather than an almost forgotten video collecting dust
in the far corner of a rental outlet.  This may become a trend as SPECIES
2, a sequel to one of the best bad sci-fi films of the decade, is set to be
released this Friday (April 10, 1998).</P>
<P>Anyway, this week's turkey is the sleazy, exploitative WILD THINGS, a film
which shares quite a number of conventions with many of the B-level,
direct-to-video-or-cable thrillers I have reviewed in the past.  The movie,
in fact, only possesses one noticeable difference: it has an all-star cast.</P>
<P>Let's be blunt for a moment.  Veteran film actors Kevin Bacon and Matt
Dillon are technically the main stars here; they are listed first in the
credits and the majority of the film's running time favors them.  WILD
THINGS' producers, however, heavily advertised this movie as an erotic
exercise between rising stars Neve Campbell and Denise Richards.  The movie
posters prominently feature the two rising out of a pool of water and
staring at the viewer with sultry gazes.  I suspect the target audience for
this film was predominantly younger males; though, surprisingly, the
matinee showing I attended with my friend had an audience with far more
women than men.  If one's only reason to see WILD THINGS is to see Ms.
Campbell and Ms. Richards get it on, then one will be remarkedly
disappointed.  A menage a trois does occur between the two ladies and Matt
Dillon, but it is a poorly-lit, seemingly superfluous scene.  The two also
kiss a couple of times, but it feels mechanic and obligatory rather than
racy as it was intended.  Neve Campbell, by the way, does not strip naked
at all.  Sorry, guys.</P>
<P>WILD THINGS' advertised sexual fireworks fizzle here, but the movie itself,
as bad movies go, is quite entertaining.  The actors turn in hammy
performances (more on this in a bit), and the surprisingly complex script
keeps the viewer guessing while the laughable dialogue is full of cheesy
lines undercutting the seriousness of the subject matter.  My friend and I
chuckled throughout the movie, but the rest of the audience didn't seem to
be in on it.  Don't go see WILD THINGS expecting a run-of-the-mill suspense
film.  (It's an amusing exercise in sleaze populated with comically
self-absorbed, greedy characters who all get what they deserve in the end.)  </P>
<P>Part of the film's qualified success comes from its cast.  A number of
fine, first-rate actors have fun with their characters.  The attractive,
young actress Denise Richards, of last year's megabudget STARSHIP TROOPERS,
nearly steals the show here as the pouty high-school student with a
supermodel body who catches everyone's eyes.  Neve Campbell, the scream
queen of SCREAM and SCREAM 2, drops her innocent, damsel-in-distress
routine and turns 180 degrees in her role as the trailer trash girl who
secretly instigates everything.  The best supporting nods go to Bill Murray
and Robert Wagner, both making surprise appearances in this, an atypical
film for either of them.  Bill Murray, in particular, is great as the
fraud-obsessed lawyer who can sniff a lawsuit from a mile away.  Robert
Wagner is hilarious in his wooden portrayal of another lawyer.  He seems to
be doing a self-parody of himself which reminds me of his brief role in the
John Candy vehicle DELIRIOUS.  </P>
<P>Despite its humorous dialogue and delightfully smarmy actors, WILD THINGS
cannot be excused for some of its shortcomings.  While the first two-thirds
of the movie moves at a breakneck pace, the last third becomes tired.
Without revealing too much, one character will kill another only to be
killed by someone else.  It becomes a cycle which tries the audience's
patience.  Also, though this film is designed to be unexpectedly funny, a
subplot deals with an affair that a guidance counselor has with two of his
students.  This seems inexcusably unethical and borders on pedophilia (the
students, to give WILD THINGS the benefit of the doubt, may be 18).  The
audience should feel uneasy when they realize they are viewing what is
supposed to be a sexual affair between a high school teacher and his
students.  </P>
<P>WILD THINGS ends on a somewhat unique note.  Important background
flashbacks are interspersed throughout the closing credits, and they are
rather fun to watch.  So, don't get up and walk out the theater as soon as
you see the closing credits start to roll at the end.</P>
<P>All in all, WILD THINGS is a pretty good and humorous turkey.  It's
certainly not for everyone, but for those who are into exploitative
thrillers like BASIC INSTINCT or SLIVER, you could find a lot worse than
this.  </P>
