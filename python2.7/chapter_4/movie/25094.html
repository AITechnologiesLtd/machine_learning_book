<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Year: 2000. Starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, 
Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant, Christopher Eccleston, 
Vinnie Jones, Scott Caan, Will Patton. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. 
Directed by Dominic Sena. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>"Gone in Sixty Seconds" is a perfect example of why reviewing films is 
not an exact science. Logically, intellectually, I know it was a bad 
film, one that will probably contribute to the general degradation of 
American cinema as a whole. But on a baser, more primal level, I enjoyed 
it. I could wax philosophical on all the script's problems with 
characterization, or on the utterly ridiculous plotting, or on the sheer 
stupidity of the whole thing, and being a long-winded critic, I probably 
will. But to give it a low rating would render me a hypocrite, because 
when all was said and done, when I had left the theater, I was 
satisfied; I had gotten my money's worth; I liked it. Despite all my 
brain's arrogant attempts to dismiss the film as dim-witted hogwash, my 
gut liked it.</P>
<P>The plot deals with retired car thief Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) and 
his attempt to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from the clutches 
of an evil crime boss (Christopher Eccleston). To do so, Raines must 
steal 50 rare cars in one night. Being an old pro (who had since left 
the "biz" for a legitimate career), Raines recruits a bunch of old 
friends to complete the task. Sound contrived? Of course it's contrived. 
This film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, master of contrived plots. 
He even throws in a brother-brother relationship and an old flame for 
Memphis, a blonde bombshell called Sway. She's played by Angelina Jolie, 
who gets second billing despite barely appearing in half the film. The 
truncated character relationships get their few scenes marked by 
grandiose orchestral swells, but they're unlikely to fool anyone. After 
all, characters don't matter in Bruckheimerland. They are merely props 
to be moved around during high-octane action scenes.</P>
<P>In the past, Bruckheimer has shown a tendency to get carried away with 
the spectacle of his films, attempting to juggle too many characters and 
plot threads. Since he's not much good at anything but action, his most 
overstuffed films ("Armageddon") have played as long, dull excursions 
into shallowness. The best thing, then, about "Gone in Sixty Seconds" is 
that it's refreshingly slimmed down. Yes, there are still too many 
characters, but they're placed very easily on either side of the 
conflict, and the goal is simple: Steal 50 cars. Simplicity is a 
necessity in Bruckheimerland, because you don't want to give anyone a 
chance to stop and observe how little substance there actually is. "Gone 
in Sixty Seconds" moves so fast, there's barely a chance to get bored. 
The car chases (and the second half of the movie is basically one big 
car chase) are filmed professionally and economically by director 
Dominic Sena. "Gone in Sixty Seconds" has everything you'd want from a 
car chase: squealing tires, revving engines, and implausible stunts 
straight out of a demolition derby. It's here the movie works best.</P>
<P>Now, I could complain about how everyone is a racial stereotype in 
Bruckheimerland: Black men are annoying loudmouths, Asian women are bad 
drivers, etc. (Who wrote this script-John Rocker?) Or I could complain 
about the shockingly banal dialogue. ("How bad is it?" "Bad.") And I 
could cite the jaw-droppingly clichE9d conclusion, featuring a fist =
fight in some random steam-filled factory setting, complete with 
slippery guns and supposedly dead characters resurrecting themselves 
with impeccable timing, and proclaim "Gone in Sixty Seconds" to be a 
Very Bad Movie.</P>
<P>But if I did that, I'd be a hypocrite, because I liked this movie more 
than I'd care to admit. No, it's not the least bit original, and yes, it 
is very, very dumb. What I like about "Gone in Sixty Seconds," however, 
is that it never appears to be taking itself terribly seriously. It's 
considerably less pompous than Bruckheimer's last few films, and I enjoy 
trash that knows it's trash a hell of a lot more than trash that 
continually strives to convince you of its seriousness (like, say, 
"Mission: Impossible 2"). I'll take fun, shameless entertainment over 
tedious pretension any day.</P>
