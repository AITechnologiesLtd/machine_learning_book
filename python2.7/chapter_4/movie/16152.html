<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>I swear, if I weren't such an incurable romantic I would hate all the movies
out there. Yes, I'll admit I loved "The English Patient" more than life
itself, and yes, I would see a romantic comedy over a B-rate action flick
any day of the week. Those are the reasons I forgave the shortcomings of
Great Expectations.</P>
<P>The movie in and of itself is an attempt to be artsy, a loose modernization/
adaptation of the Dickens classic (which I hate), with almost every
character re-named and remoded into whatever fits. With Pip renamed as Finn
and re-casted as an artist and Robert de Niro taking on the role of the
felon Magwitch, re-dubbed Lusting. The only thing seemingly kept the same is
the basics, the name Estella for Finn's lifelong love, and the basic Marxist
theme to the entirety of it.</P>
<P>It basically succeeds as an artsy film, making a appealing version of the
classic, but the re-naming of the characters, the choppy dialogue and the
write-your-script-in-a-three-day-weekend contest winner script make a
complete lack of appeal. Go ahead and see it, you probably will find
yourself enjoying the movie. But, whatever you do, don't try to watch the
movie to do that book report.</P>
