<P>Some will confuse a movie based on a Saturday Night Live sketch for an
actual movie. In actuality, they are products which have been
precariously stretched beyond their usual 10-minute running length,
pampered and revamped to (barely) qualify as a feature film. Some, like
`Wayne's World' and `The Blues Brothers', fare moderately well with a
mainstream audience. Others (`It's Pat!', anyone...?) are so idiotic and
pointless that it's embarrassing to sit through even the skimpy 80
minutes of their nauseating running time.</P>
<P>`Superstar', the latest SNL related motion picture, actually fares
better at 82 minutes than in the suffocating confines of a 10-minute
sketch. I have never been a fan of the regular skit, which follows
Irish-Catholic school girl Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly Shannon)
through various escapades of quoting ancient TV movies and sniffing her
armpits during fits of nervous hysteria. But with a less claustrophobic
running time, some surprising attributes of Mary Katherine are allowed
to shine through: her unexpected charm, her sensitive personality... And
Shannon fits the role remarkably, applying just the right amount of
playful exuberance in some scenes and genuine feeling in others.</P>
<P>There are massive problems in `Superstar' from the very beginning, but
the appealing cuteness of the cast (along with an assorted handful of
fall-down funny moments) helps revive the quality considerably. The
painfully weak plot-line finds Mary, teased and taunted by her fellow
classmates at St. Monica's Catholic school, contemplating an entry to
the upcoming `Fight Venereal Disease' Talent Contest. She is also wooing
the incredible hunk Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), who holds the key to
Mary's lifelong dream: a great kiss.  Anticipating this timeless moment,
she has long practiced on several inanimate objects (including a tree
and a stop sign), much to the shock and dismay of the sisters at St.
Monica's.</P>
<P>For every joke or physical gag that works in `Superstar', there are
three that don't. There is also an emphasis on perverted sexual humor,
including one scene where Mary has her breasts engaged in a
conversation. Hidden in all the idiocy, there are isolated moments that
are just wonderful. Like Mary's bouts with the stuck-up blond
cheerleader Evian (Elaine Hendrix), whom she describes as the
`prettiest, most successful, most bulimic girl in school'. After the two
rivals attack each other with the kung-fu tactics of Jackie Chan, Mary
tells Evian to go `drink a bottle of herself'. There is also an
enjoyable send-up of `Armageddon', and funny sequences involving Mary's
hideously ugly pooch, which I wanted to confront with a large comb.</P>
<P>The entire cast is bright and funny. Will Ferrell, one of the most
talented additions to the current `SNL' cast, is delightfully
self-satisfied as the stereotypical jock Sky Corrigan. It's unfortunate
that Sky's character is left relatively unexplored, but whatever ground
Ferrell loses with that drawback, he makes up for with a funny recurring
appearance as Mary's subconscious interpretation of God (who advises the
Catholic girl to `get jiggy with it'). Glynis Johns is Mary's
wheelchair-bound gramma, Harland Williams is unusually sweet as a
mysterious and speechless drifter, and `Kids in the Hall' veteran Mark
McKinney supplies several gratifying moments as the bewildered Father
Ritley. McKinney can take even the most lifeless scene, such as when
Ritley chews on a blackened piece of toast, and revitalize it with
humor.</P>
<P>On the subject of `Kids in the Hall', it's also the original comic
origins of director Bruce McCulloch, who previously tried his luck
behind the camera this year with `Dog Park'. There's something absent
from McCulloch's direction, but it suits the subject matter nicely.
Undeniably, the real star here is Shannon, who originally created the
character of Mary Katherine Gallagher and deserves the credit where
credit is due.</P>
<P>Mary is certainly a clumsy girl (crashing through a confessional door in
one particular scene), and in some ways, the film embodies her
clumsiness. There's no reason why anyone would want to endure
`Superstar', unless they were a dedicated fan of `Saturday Night Live'
or Molly Shannon. But there are a few redeeming qualities - including a
contagious charm - that helps the film rise above a few general
standards normally associated with the `SNL' breed of movie-making. I
laughed during `Superstar', and if it catches you in the right frame of
mind, you might laugh too.</P>
