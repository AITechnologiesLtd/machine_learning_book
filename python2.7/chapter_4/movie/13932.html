Sleeping with the Enemy</PRE>
<P>Vor (also known as The Thief, Russian with English subtitles,1997)</P>
<P>Seen on 15 August 1998 for $8.75 with Linda at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas</P>
<P>Pavel Chukhrai has written and directed not only one of the best Russian
films to come our way in a long time, but probably one of the best movies
of this year. </P>
<P>In a pretitle sequence, we learn from the narrator that he was born on the
roadside in 1946, his father having died in the last year of the war
against the Nazis. Six years later, Sanya (Misha Philipchuk) and his
mother (Katya, played by Yekaterina Rednikova) are on a train and meet
Toljan (Vladimir Mashkov), a tall, brawny soldier. Toljan exudes a
charismatic sexual appeal and by the time the train ride ends, he has
bedded Katya and Sanya is told to call him Daddy. </P>
<P>Using his uniform as credentials, he is able to get a room in Baba Tanya's
apartment, where several other families also live. Katya is happy but
Sanya is both mesmerized and terrorized by the brutish man who is only
nice to him when he is corrupting his young mind, telling him how to take
what he wants and not put up with guff from anyone. His tattoos--a tiger
on the back of his shoulder and Josef Stalin on his chest--are meant to be
warning signs. He even tells impressionable Sanya that Stalin is his
father, and that it's a secret. </P>
<P>Katya soon has her suspicions, that he is seeing someone behind her back; 
she is shocked to discover he is stealing from their fellow tenants. She
is shocked but follows him anyway, and they travel all over Russia, as
Toljan steals from friends and neighbors and then sneaks off into the
night onto trains.  Toljan winds up imprisoned, however, and sent away for
years in Siberia, on a completely unrelated charge, and Katya remains
faithful to this lout who clearly doesn't care if she follows him or not. 
He is clearly indifferent and unrepentent. He likes the life and "work" he
has chosen for himself, and sees no reason to change, despite Katya's
pleas. Throughout all of this, Sanya sees the spectre of his father, the
one he never met. </P>
<P>The performances by Philipchuk and Mashkov are outstanding, as the
wide-eyed six-year-old and the thief, respectively. Together they have an
undeniable chemistry that is essentially the heart of the movie. </P>
<P>Now, put into the larger historical context, it makes even more sense why
Katya is following Toljan all over Russia. Katya is Mother Russia, her son
is the future, and Toljan is every tyrant she has ever accepted
unquestioningly as her leader--the most deadly one of all having been
Josef Stalin. Like Toljan, Stalin stole from the people who trusted him
and liked him. Betrayal of the worst kind. </P>
<P>Director Chukhrai bravely explores the psyche of a people who have never
really fully faced up to the brutalities of their past, and the leaders
whom they chose to perpetrate the worst crimes against them. His use of
close-up is especially effective in showing the mesmerer and the
mesmerized.</P>
<P>Also worthy of note is Dima Shigarev, the 12-year-old Sanya, who is
wide-eyed but clearly world weary, having kept up the vigil for the man
who betrayed them, closely guarding a firearm and a color photo of Josef
Stalin, even when Krushchev was firmly in power. Shigarev's face is very
expressive, and really enhances the conclusion of the movie. </P>
