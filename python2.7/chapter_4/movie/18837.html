<PRE>The Matrix</PRE>
<P>Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss
Directed By Andy and Larry Wachowski
Running Time: 2 hours 16 minutes (U.K cut)</P>
<PRE>(Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>After the minor thriller Bound, the Wachowski brothers follow up their
directing debut with this nifty piece of sci-fi action. Keanu Reeves plays
Thomas, a lowly worker who works for a software firm. He is soon contacted,
however, by Morpheus (Fishburne) who wishes to talk to Thomas about the
'matrix.' Thomas agrees, and Morpheus tells Tom the unthinkable: Tom's
'world' is created by computer, and the entire human race appear to be
plugged in to this fake existence. Morpheus identifies Thomas as 'Neo,' the
messiah who can save the human race from the matrix. Yes, Keanu is indeed
Jesus. The film then follows Neo, Morpheus and the rest of the rebel clan as
they try and destroy the matrix machine, while trying to avoid the sunglass
clad 'Agents' who wish to destroy them.</P>
<P>The plot is cliched, the acting occasionally off, and the dialogue not so
hot, but The Matrix is a surprisingly well made, and even intelligent movie.
Reeves, it appears, is back on track after the hiatus after Speed. Although
lacking in some areas, The Matrix delivers where it should: sci-fi hokum
with some violence chucked in to boot. The action is a real stand out, using
'flo-mo,' a system where the action goes into slo-mo, while still 'panning'
around the actors. It's an awesome sight, but sadly not used much until the
end of the movie. Also, the movie seems to spend a helluva long time
explaining what the Matrix actually is, which gets tiresome. Still, the kung
fu and gunfight sequences that punctuate the movie are fast paced and well
done, and are good entertainment.</P>
<P>The actors also play a part in providing some fun. Although Reeves still has
little or no acting talent, he is curiously suited to the role he is given
here. His 'where the hell am I?' look actually fits around his confused
character. I'm sure this was all completely unintentional on Reeves behalf,
but it works anyway. Fishburne, usually confined 'Samuel L. Jackson Jnr.'
roles, holds his own here, and is the highlight of the film. Unfortunately,
his character is curiously underwritten, and is given little to do at the
end of the film. Although he is given a lot of dialogue, much of it is 'plot
forwarding' and not much development is given to the character itself, which
is a shame. Maybe in the inevitable sequels we'll see more of him.
Carrie-Anne Moss provides eye candy as the attractive but empty Trinity, and
Hugo Weaving is evil enough as the relentless Agent Smith.</P>
<P>Much of the stuff contained in The Matrix has been seen in many other films,
but not with this much style or energy. The special effects actually help
the film, with some nice scenes of the Matrix itself (although it still
looks like one large computer graphic.) The film has a gritty, Blade Runner
feel that adds to the disturbing atmosphere. The gun battles are well
staged, and there's enough twists and turns in the plot to hold the viewers
attention.</P>
<P>In summary, The Matrix, while not making any great leaps in screenwriting or
acting, is a well crafted and directed thriller. Don't go in expecting non
stop action, however, as you'll be disappointed. Only the first and last 15
minutes contain 'pure' action. The rest of the movie is a taut, sometimes
slackly plotted (the movie is overlong) that provides enough interest and
laughs (sometime unintentional) to be above average sci-fi hokum. Star Wars
will have to go a long way to beat this, especially for the adult crowd. The
epitome of hip sci-fi.</P>
