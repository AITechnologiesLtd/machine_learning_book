<PRE>Review:        Very Bad Things</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern,
                Jeanne Tripplehorn, Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Leland Orser</PRE>

<PRE>Rated:        R</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse </PRE>
<P>The main reason that Christian Slater has the Star billing is that he
also has credit as one of the Executive Producers.  This is definitely an
ensemble film.  If anyone is the star, it isn't Slater.</P>
<P>Cameron Diaz is the bride and Jon Favreau is the groom.  Although the
opening scenes are immediately before the ceremony, the action quickly
moves back a couple of days, focusing on the bachelor party in Las Vegas. 
The five male buddies are in their hotel room when a stripper arrives. 
Her rousing dance is too much for Jeremy Piven who accompanies her to the
big marble bathroom.  In a moment of passion, he accidentally kills her. 
It's a very startling scene.  From that moment on, their lives change
forever.  Instead of calling the front desk and the police to explain the
accident, they agree to Slater's suggestions for disposing of the body.</P>
<P>Supposedly it is humorous to see bodies sawed into pieces and packed into
suitcases…or to see brother attack brother, with a car…or blood
everywhere.  The term `black humor' seems to mean that if bad taste is
funny, then it will be even funnier if it's in dreadful taste.  </P>
<P>There are some very funny scenes mingled with the scenes that make you
squeamish.  Cameron Diaz is delightful as the Bride, playing with tiny
little tables and chairs to decide the reception seating arrangement.  You
almost feel sorry for her when Daniel Stern and Jeanne Tripplehorn's
children overturn the entire project.  Speaking of Tripplehorn, she plays
her part with flair, and a lot of gumption.  You're really pulling for her.</P>
<P>I really can't recommend this film for the older generation, although
most of the under-forty audience will probably love it.  I don't want to
see it again.  I give it a C-.</P>
