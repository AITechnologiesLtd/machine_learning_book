<P>         In 1988, Disney had enjoyed some degree of success luring
adults into seeing the animated feature "Oliver and Company" by hiring
Bette Midler, Billy Joel and Cheech Marin to provide character voices.
The following year, the company decided to aggressively market "The
Little Mermaid" to the over-18 audience, a group that generally shied
away from G-rated entertainment. Special screenings of the picture were
held in the evenings for adult audiences and an ad campaign was
developed to sell the film as a romantic fantasy rather than as a
children's picture.</P>
<P> The strategy worked beyond anyone's expectations. "Mermaid"
grossed $85 million in the U.S. alone, making it the most successful
animated feature up to that time and paving the way for such future
smashes as "Aladdin," "Beauty and the Beast," "The Lion King" and
"Pocahontas," all of which would bring in grown-ups as well as
youngsters.</P>
<P> Seen today, "Mermaid" lacks the visual splendor of those films,
although its best moments are certainly as delightful as anything the
Mouse Factory has ever produced. The movie's biggest flaw is its
tendency to lay on both the humor and the terror a little thick,
although the frequent musical numbers are so well-executed it's easy to
overlook the plot's missteps.</P>
<P> As written by Hans Christian Andersen, "The Little Mermaid" was
a gloomy fable about the dangers of not knowing your place in society.
Disney's retelling turns that message inside out: The film heartily
advocates exploring new worlds, defying expectations and risking
everything in pursuit of your dreams. The title character Ariel (voice
of Jodi Benson) is a high-spirited 16-year-old sea princess who longs to
explore dry land, an idea her father King Triton (Kenneth Mars)
expressly forbids. "As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my
rules," he bellows when he learns she's been sneaking peeks at the
coastline.</P>
<P> Since this is a Disney film, Ariel is required to sing about
her yearning, in this case the gorgeous anthem "Part of Your World," in
which she wonders "what would I give if I could live out of these
waters? What would I pay for just one day, warm on the sand?"</P>
<P> That's what Ursula (Pat Carroll), a meddling sea witch, would
like to know. Part Cruella DeVil and part squid, she's willing to turn
Ariel into a human so that the girl can find the mortal prince she's
fallen in love with. But the witch's terms are severe: To pay for the
transformation, Ariel must give up her voice, and if she can't win her
sweetheart over within three days, she'll have to take her place in
Ursula's super-creepy garden of withered, lifeless "poor, unfortunate
souls."</P>
<P> The Oscar-winning score by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman could
not be any better, featuring the delirious "Under the Sea" (later to be
spoofed in an unforgettable "Simpsons" episode) and the calypso-flavored
"Kiss the Girl," both of which develop into full-blown production
numbers. And "Les Poissons," sung by a demented chef as he tries to get
the unwilling crab Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) onto the dinner table,
must be one of the strangest musical moments in Disney history.</P>
<P> But what truly set "Mermaid" apart from its predecessors was
Ariel herself, a strong-willed young woman who set her own course in
life, unlike Cinderella and Snow White, whose destinies were determined
more by fate and chance than by their actions. In contrast, Ariel is the
kind of heroine certain to inspire little girls in the audience to think
for themselves -- and the little boys to spend a lot more time fishing.
