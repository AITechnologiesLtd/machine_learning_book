<PRE>                                THE WOOD
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Another week, another coming of age story.  Turns out timing can be
everything, and THE WOOD's unfortunate release one week after the
somewhat similar (but much better) AMERICAN PIE will leave viewers
drawing unfavorable comparisons between the two.</P>
<P>     The story behind THE WOOD, as in Inglewood, California, follows
three best friends on the day when one is set to be married.  Of course,
he's having the jitters, so they reminisce about their childhood growing
up together and chasing girls, which, basically, is what they all still
want to be doing.</P>
<P>     Told in half-present, half-flashback, THE WOOD alternates between
time periods, launching into those `Hey, remember that time when...'
vignettes, overlaid with music by Luther Vandross and other 1980's soul
legends.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the MTV-production side of THE WOOD comes out far
too often, with long, drawn-out comedy scenes that run out of gas after
a couple of minutes and left me yawning or checking my watch.  These
jokes are just too tired, overused, or recycled... and THE WOOD quickly
becomes a game of Spot the Cliché.  In fact, the whole premise has been
done to death – possibly best in DINER (1982).  Maybe it's just too soon
for 1989 nostalgia, but I found myself much more interested in the
present-day than the booty-chasing youths of these guys, and
unfortunately, that's when the bulk of THE WOOD takes place.</P>
<P>     THE WOOD isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly memorable,
either.  Just another summer movie that will likely be lost in the
shuffle.</P>
