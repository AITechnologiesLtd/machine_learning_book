<PRE>                            RAISE THE RED LANTERN
                       A film review by Jerry Boyajian
                        Copyright 1992 Jerry Boyajian</PRE>
<P>     RAISE THE RED LANTERN is the latest film by the hot, young Chinese
director Zhang Yimou (RED SORGHUM, JU DOU).  It was nominated this year
for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, and like JU DOU, it's been banned in
its home country for being ideologically incorrect.  Quite frankly, I
was never able to figure out what it was about JU DOU that got the
Chinese government so worked up, but with this film it's a bit more
obvious.</P>
<P>     Gong Li (star of Yimou's previous films) plays Songlian, a young
woman in 1920s China who becomes the fourth wife/mistress of a rich man.
Each of the four women occupy their own wing of the Master's mansion,
with their own maids.  Whichever one the Master chooses to sleep with on
a given night has red lanterns lit and placed around her quarters and
gets to be at the top of the pecking order for as long as the Master
sleeps with her.  Not surprisingly, the four women struggle against each
other to be the apple of the Master's eye, and it's these power politics
that form the core of the story.</P>
<P>     On a higher level, though, Yimou's film is and allegory about the
Chinese political and social system.  Like that system, the Master's
house is run with a rigid structure of rules and customs that must be
obeyed at the risk of losing status (at best) or life (at worst).  The
Master himself is painted in rather vague terms: we never see him very
well, he's either in medium or distant shots and/or is turned partly
away from the camera, and his presence is felt more than shown.  The
most pointed aspect of the Master-as-government allegory is when one of
the wives is killed for adultery and another one accuses the household
servants of being murderers after she follows them and finds the body of
the murdered wife.  To her accusations, the Master says, "You saw
nothing," much like the way Beijing denies the Tiannamen massacre.</P>
<P>     Visually, the film is beautiful.  Yimou's composition is exquisite,
and moves the film at a very deliberate pace, so that it seems almost as
if each the film is intended to be a series of paintings.  I was
particularly taken with one sequence where Songlian meets the Young
Master (the son of the First Mistress) after following the sounds of his
flute-playing.  There is also a nice series of overlapping dissolves
just before the closing credits that is simple yet wonderfully done.</P>
<P>     (It should be noted that those with a feminist bent might find this
film hard to sit through.  Not because the film itself is sexist, but it
portrays a highly patriarchal and sexist society, and so the dialogue is
filled with various remarks about women's role in society as servants to
the man.)</P>
<P>     RAISE THE RED LANTERN is a major film from a man who is rapidly
becoming a major figure in world cinema.  I couldn't recommend it more
highly.</P>
