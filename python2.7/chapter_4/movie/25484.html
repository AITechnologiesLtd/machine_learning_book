<P>   One of my earliest memories was of my asking my mother
a philosophic question at the age of three.  "Mommy," I said,
mouth open with awe, "Does God see me now?"  "Of course
He does," my mother said, which led to my follow up, "Does
He watch me when I'm sleeping?"  "He does that too," was
the answer, predictably enough, though I don't think I'd have
made a fascinating subject doing that.  Finally, with a tremor
in my voice, "Mommy, does God see me when I'm in the
bathroom?"  "He can do that too," was the reply I fully
expected, at which point I vowed that I'd always be a good
boy, because who knows what could happen when I even
entertained an evil thought?</P>
<P>   Look at this from an inverted viewpoint.  What would you
be like if you had this Divine power to see others at any
time that you wished, and others would not be able to see
you in return?  Would you be a cherubic person, wishing
everyone the best, helping out when you could do so without
being observed?  Could be.  But recall the famous saying of
Lord Acton: Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.  So, then.  If you had this absolute power, what
would you really do?  In his envelope-pushing movie, Paul
Verhoeven, veteran of such classic entertainments as
"Showgirls," goes with the views of writers Gary Scott
Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe ("Air Force One"), and
decides that a person with the power of invisibility would be
corrupt.  He would do evil.  He would be the Devil.  </P>
<P>   Here, then, is a powerful theme to explore.  If you expect
Verhoeven to knock out an intellectual exercise on the nature
of absolute power, you'd be sadly mistaken, and if you try to
judge "Hollow Man" by literary standards, you'd be looking at
the movie the wrong way.  Forget literary standards.  Leave
that arena to the book critics.  Remember that movies,
particularly commercial movies, emphasize movement, action,
dream-like states, and assess this tale by cinematic
standards.  Why?  Because so far as the story line goes, the
sci-fi/horror yarn is by the numbers.  You know who's going
to die and who will live to tell the tale.  You know that the
villain is going to make the usual mistake in the end of talking
too much instead of killing quickly.  Though Plato talked
about the nature of morality (do we abstain from evil
because of our conscience, or because we don't want to go
to jail) and Christopher Marlowe in 1616 asked the Devil to
"so charme me here/That I may walke invisible to all,/doe
what ere I please, unseen by any,") you won't find gems of
literary wit in the movie itself.</P>
<P>   However!  For special effects Verhoeven trots out some
stuff that allegedly was not do-able as recently as last year,
and would have been considered way beyond the powers of
filmmakers the likes of horrormeister James Whale, whose
1933 "The Invisible Man" was then considered about as far
as movie makers would ever go.  (That classic, which made
Claude Rains a household name, was of a mad scientist who
makes himself invisible and wreaks havoc on the natives of
his British country village.)  "Hollow Man" is more like
Lambert Hilyer's 1936 film "The Invisible Ray," showing
scientist Boris Karloff contracting radiation that slowly
deteriorates his mind, except that in this case, power, not
radiation, plays dangerous tricks on the subject's reason.</P>
<P>   The story line is simple enough.  Laboratory scientists
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), Matt Kensington (Josh
Brolin), Sarah (Kim Dickens), Carter Abby (Greg Grunberg),
Janice (Mary Jo Randle) and Linda Foster (Elizabeth Shue)
are working on a Pentagon-funded project to create
invisibility--a technique that would have obvious benefits for
American defense.  Having successfully knocked out human
visibility on a gorilla and restored the beast to perceptible
form, Sebastian and his ex-sweetheart Linda decide to
override protocol and experiment with a human being--without
the permission of Pentagon bigwig Dr. Arthur Kramer (William
Devane).  </P>
<P>   When project boss Sebastian volunteers as guinea
pig, he injects himself with an irradiated serum that
triumphantly turns him invisible, but alas, the scientists are
unable to bring him back.  He can be seen only when he
sheathes himself with a special gel or when immersed in
water or blanketed with steam or through special tinted
glasses that the research team members possess.  Guess
what?  Sebastian doesn't care.  Fortified with some of the
power of God Himself to wander about unnoticed, he can be
voyeur, he can mess with people, he can even injure and kill
them with impunity.  Lord Acton was right.  Add to the mix
that Sebastian is already enraged that his former girl friend,
Linda is now romantically tied to fellow scientist Matt
Kensington and you have a Devil's broth to stir up for the
remainder of the picture's 110 minutes.  As Sebastian drives
away from the lab to ponder the evil ways he will use the
power, he begins by scaring a couple of kids in an adjoining
car.  They look at his gel-sheathed face and see a
hollowed-out area where the eyes should be.  They scream
for their mommy.  And this is just the beginning of
Sebastian's descent into madness.</P>
<P>   The most electrifying special effect is the animation given
to what is known in encyclopedias and on some computer
software as The Illustrated Man, a glossy and impressive
display of our internal matter, from top to bottom: bones,
veins, arteries, organs.  Leonardo da Vinci had to cut down
hanged criminals and dissect them in his lab to find out what
went on internally.  Centuries passed by before William
Harvey told us how blood circulates.  But now, photographer
Jost Vacano plays doctor by seemingly taking his camera
close up to the tortured body of Sebastian Caine, writhing in
pain as he slowly deconstructs.  The skin gives way to this
internal view as we look at what our biology teacher told us is
just a couple of bucks worth of chemicals.  We see well
beyond what an MRI can show the most experienced
radiologist, and what's more the movement of these body
parts is made even scarier by Jerry Goldsmith's loud and
pulsating original score of tension-building discordant music.</P>
<P>   "Stir of Echoes" veteran Kevin Bacon plays the flip side of 
his role in the David Koepp production just months
ago, in which he was a man who, under hypnosis, could see
what others could not.  He makes as fine a villain here as he
made a good-guy father in Jay Russell's sentimental "My Dog
Skip," but because the script is not this movie's high point, he
cannot bring out much three-dimensionality from Elizabeth
Shue as Nicolas Cage did in the wonderful "Leaving Las
Vegas."  Since Sebastian is a heroic scientist at the start of
the movie, volunteering to risk his life by being the first
guinea pig for the experiment, Verhoeven wants us to ponder
to what degree we continue to root for him even as he
plummets into the madness of absolute power.  "Hollow Man"
shines cinematically with blockbusting effects.  But
considering the philosophers and writers quoted in the
production notes--Christopher Marlowe and Plato, and I
suppose we could throw in Dostoevski and Shakespeare and
just about anyone who pondered the role of conscience and
morality--much more could have been made of the narrative.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 110 minutes.  (C) 2000
