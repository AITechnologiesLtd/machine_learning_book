<PRE>The Mummy: embalmed with a grin</PRE>
<P>Here's the story: three-thousand odd years ago some Jafar-type priest /
sorcerer got caught romancing the pharaoh's wife. Pretty typical stuff, but
then the pharaoh turns out have gone to the same school as all the
Bond-nemeses, the one where they ask why kill the guy when there are so many
other imaginative ways to (not) get rid of him? To give the pharaoh some
credit, though, the idea is that the punishment must fit the crime, and the
crime here is measured by how fed up with all this the pharaoh is. As bad
luck would have it, too, he's seriously fed up, meaning the only punishment
that can assuage his anger is to have Imhotep (the Jafar-sorcerer; Arnold
Vosloo) granted immortality and then summarily entombed for 'eternity' with
some flesh-eating beetles. Of course, eternity only lasts about
three-thousand years, or, until French Foreign Legionnaire Rick O'Connell
(Brendan Fraser) stumbles upon the burial, Hamunaptra, fabled city of wealth
hid midst the shifting sands etc.</P>
<P>Too--and even though The Mummy's set in the early part of the 20th
century--O'Connell has evidently not only seen all of the Indiana Joneses,
but evidently committed them to memory, right down to proper attire. But he
doesn't awaken Imhotep quite yet. That's plot point 1, and anyway, there's
still some other characters to introduce, the most important of which is
Evelyn, (Rachel Weisz) the fumbling, supermodel librarian. Close behind is
her conniving brother Jonathan (John Hannah). Together they hire scrupleless
O'Connell to take them to this lost city, which, while not quite as
impressive as the Egypt of Stargate, is still pretty cool. Add to it a bevy
of special effects miles ahead of any other movie and everything's set up
for a walloping good time, the kind of ride the trailer promised.</P>
<P>And the mummy, wow. Gone are the days when his kind shuffled around with
rigor mortis of the arms and a confused expression. Now the mummy's
serious--fast, strong, gross, a definite improvement. He even has a voice,
of the same calibre as, say, Wishmaster's, which was some top-notch
low-bass. Unlike Wishmaster, however, The Mummy tries a little too hard to
have it all--action, humor, horror. It's as if director Stephen Sommers took
all the flashy elements from Indiana Jones and tripled their intensity, with
the intention of tripling the Indiana Jones effect. Which would have been
fine as concerns the action and the horror--you can never have enough of
them; they're what we're paying for here. But the humor, the zingers written
in practically every other line. With that kind of stuff, less tends to be
more, y'know? Best to use them as a John McClane might, in the Diehard
series. Or, perhaps, best to simply not write in a comic character for the
kids. Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner, a long way from his Swann-role), the mewling,
opportunistic (reluctant) side-kick of evil. He does have a couple of
honestly good lines, but they're hardly worth all his throwaway ones. If one
character can bring down a movie that otherwise has so much going fot it,
then Beni does. If one character can save that same movie, however, look to
the Encino Man himself, Brendan Fraser, fighting the mummy tooth and nail,
doing his best Harrison Ford, the kind where we know who the real immortal
is. Suffice it to say that if you were ever hungry enough for low-rent,
high-stakes relic hunting that you tuned into the young Indiana Jones
episodes, then The Mummy might be just light-hearted enough to satisfy.</P>
