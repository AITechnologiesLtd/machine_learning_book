<P>Jakob, the Liar, Starring  Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Hannah
Taylor-Gordon, Michael Jeter, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Liev Schreiver.
Directed by Peter Kassovitz</P>
<P>It is not an easy task to dramatize a sad and depressing time in
history.  Last year's Life is Beautiful was able to teach a lesson about
the holocaust through laughter.  Although Robin Williams is noted for his
humor and wonderful characterizations, even he is unable to make this an
enjoyable film.</P>
<P>The Polish Jews depicted are not in a concentration camp, but are
residents of a ghetto where they are deprived of most essentials of life. 
They are contained in their own little space behind walls and barbed wire
fences.</P>
<P>Before the war Jakob Heym (Williams) was the owner of a nice little
restaurant, but lack of supplies has forced him to suspend operations and
he exists in an area above the old eatery.</P>
<P>Kowalsky (Balaban), the town barber, has not received a new razor blade
for years, but he manages to shave Jakob each and every day.  In return,
he was supposed to receive some now non-existent latkes from Jakob.  When
Jakob discovers that the despondent barber is about to commit suicide, he
reminds him of his promise to shave him, thereby postponing the hanging.</P>
<P>The lack of news from the outside world has led to depression for most of
the neighbors.  One day Jakob accidentally overhears a news broadcast that
tells of the Russian approach to their town.  He shares this announcement
with one person, who tells another, then another, and so on until everyone
know about it.  Although it is forbidden to own a radio, they all assume
that Jakob really didn't `overhear' the news.  They are certain that he
has a hidden radio.</P>
<P>There is a subplot involving a young refugee who finds herself in Jakob's
care.  It is she, not a radio that is hidden.</P>
<P>This is a dark movie, not only in content, but also in its
cinematography.  At times it is difficult to distinguish what is going on
in the numerous shadows.  This lack of contrast will only become worse
when it comes to television. </P>
<P>Robin Williams and everyone else in the cast are very good in their
roles, and basically, it is a good story with an impressive ensemble. 
There is just too much depression here for me.  I don't need that.  I
won't watch it again.  For that reason, I give it a C.</P>
