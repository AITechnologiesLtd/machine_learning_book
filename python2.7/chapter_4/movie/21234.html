<P>starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk
directed by David Fincher</P>
<P>Some movie rags have reported that Fight Club's release date was
bumped from July to October to distance it from the Columbine
shootings. If that's true (director David Fincher says he just needed
more time to fine tune the editing), isn't Fox taking a step backward
by attaching to all Fight Club prints the trailer for Light it Up, a
film about a high school kid who tires of the dreaded "system" and
therefore takes his classmates hostage? Fight Club is very violent,
but Light it Up looks sensationalistic.  </P>
<P>Fight Club explores instead of exploiting. It never stops presenting
high-falutin' ideas. In some ways, the film is too existential to be
incendiary-you don't feel riled up by the closing credits, you feel
worn out, exhausted from playing headgames. </P>
<P>The story is told through the eyes of Norton's nameless narrator (the
movie refers to him as Jack at times, so I will do the same here), a
flunky for an unidentified automaker by day, an insomniac always. Jack
spends entire evenings sifting through Ikea catalogues and staring
hopelessly at TV infomercials. He tells his physician he's miserable,
dying inside, but the doctor responds that if he really wants to know
about pain, he should meet with victims of testicular cancer. </P>
<P>Jack actually visits a support group for such people, and their
stories cause him to weep uncontrollably. At last, feelings. A good
cry helps him sleep like a baby; soon, he becomes an eager tourist of
like meetings, but Marla (Carter), another phony who has begun making
the support group rounds for "free cake and coffee," interrupts his
good time. Maybe her beauty distracts him, or maybe he just can't deal
with his own lie reflected back, but Jack is made positively irate by
Marla's presence on his turf. </P>
<P>He takes a break from the 12-step world for company trips, and on one
plane ride he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt-has he ever been this
magnetic?), a soap salesman with the gift of gab. They exchange
business cards, and when Jack returns home to find his apartment
bombed out (the stove's pilot light was left on), he calls Tyler.
Three pitchers of beer later, Jack has a place to stay. </P>
<P>Tyler introduces him to a seedier life. In Jack's new digs, the
electricity must be turned off during a rainstorm. The shower runs
brown water. The staircase could collapse at any moment. But this is
to his delight: for once, he's not slave to his stuff-expensive
furnishings and appliances. (Tyler tells him, "We don't own things,
the things own us.") </P>
<P>Tyler offers Jack another release through fighting. What starts out as
a few innocuous swings at one another in a parking lot turns into an
underground sensation, with various disillusioned men meeting one
night of the week in the basement of a dive to scrap. (Tyler, in
essence, extols the virtues of nihilism.) Marla disrupts Jack's
happiness again, though, when she worms her way back into his life
through a sexual relationship with Tyler. </P>
<P>After only three films (Alien3, Se7en, The Game), Fincher has
developed a distinct style-there is a consistent tone running through
his filmography which could be weakly characterized as "bleak".
Certainly, his works are linked by visual motifs, such as the most
piercing flashlights this side of Spielberg, dank locales, flash
frames, and low angles. (His technique is a bit more playful this time
around; his acknowledgment of the medium itself in one scene is
downright postmodern.) Fight Club also recalls The Game in its second
half as Jack's reality changes and he no longer knows who is
trustworthy. </P>
<P>But Fincher's past examinations of identity crisis (consider also
Se7en's villain) were emotionally hard-hitting, and while Fight Club
should be applauded for going out on a philosophical limb (much is
made of Jack and Tyler's yin yang dynamic, as symbolized by Jack's
table, and how violence will turn you into a drone as much as sitting
under the fluorescent lights in a cubicle might), it is unmoving.
Cynicism gets in the way at the start, when we're asked to laugh at
truly pitiable characters, including Meat Loaf's sympathetic cancer
survivor (the camera keeps lingering on his large, feminine breasts).
(Other jokes go over better.) When the narrative shifts gears to
Marla's subplot, we learn that she's a burnout (hardly the femme
fatale the ads would have you believe), and little else. She exists to
inform us about Jack, so we vest little interest in their
relationship. </P>
<P>By film's end, so many concepts and plot twists have been thrown our
way that we're left dizzy at best. The final shot is a feast for the
eyes and ears, but Fincher denies us what Jack wants and periodically
achieves: catharsis. Fight Club is a darkly comic work of crazed
genius (I'd call it cinematic pop art), but its punches aim for the
head, not the heart.</P>
