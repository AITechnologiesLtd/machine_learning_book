<P>Plot: Dr Niko Tatopolous, a biologist with the US Atomic Energy 
Commission specializing in radiation-mutated lifeforms, is flown to the 
South Pacific to investigate reports of a giant lizard, mutated as a 
result of French nuclear testing, which is attacking shipping. But the 
creature, nicknamed `Gojira' by a Japanese survivor and mispronounced as 
`Godzilla' by the American media, heads to Manhattan Island where it 
rampages through the city streets, causing mass destruction. As the 
military rally all efforts to stop it, Niko tries to alert them to the 
fact that it has laid a nest of eggs somewhere in the city.</P>
<P>Sometimes one just ends up scratching their head and wondering what it 
is that drives public tastes and/or the opinion of critics. Two years 
before when `Independence Day' became less of a film than it did an 
event, this critic ended up scratching his head and wondering what made 
everybody go so crazy about something so one-dimensionally cliched and 
simplistically flag-waving. Now I find myself in almost the opposite 
position. Despite a mega-hype build-up that announced it was from the 
same people as and would be even bigger than `Independence Day', 
`Godzilla' has opened in the US and confounded all expectation to become 
a middling flop with the public and with critics everywhere rushing to 
junk it. In fact it is not a bad film at all. If the truth be told it is 
really quite the most enjoyable, unpretentious out-and-out monster movie 
that has come this in some time. Why all the negative hoopla is frankly 
beyond one - perhaps it is the absensce of flag-waving that disappointed 
people.</P>
<P>One didn't really expect much from the film at all. Director Roland 
Emmerich and his co-writer Dean Devlin do not make particularly good sf. 
Devlin writes by cliche and Emmerich directs in simplistic emotional 
cues and their combined body of work - `Universal Soldier' (1992), 
`Stargate' (1994), `Independence Day' (1996) and the tv series `The 
Visitor' (1997) - lacks anything appreciable in the way of original 
ideas or challenging treatments of any of the themes. `Independence Day' 
is the best example of all their faults - mindless mega-scale special 
effects for their own sake and the substitution for election 
campaign-type populist sentiments in the place of drama. `Stargate' is 
their best film up to this point, which at least counterbalances their 
cliched writing with what is Emmerich's forte - the ability to conjure 
an effectively dramatic sense of wonder across an epic widescreen scale.</P>
<P>`Godzilla' is of course an updating of the long-running Japanese monster 
series - begun with `Gojira' in 1954, and passing through some 
twenty-one sequels until the character was officially killed off in 
1995. Emmerich and Devlin do some occasionally clever updatings - in an 
amusingly contemporary move the creature has been mutated to giant-size 
by French nuclear testing in the Pacific. But mostly their writing is 
really terrible. Their characters are conceived as no more than 
caricatures - the French are snobbish about American junk food; the 
pompous mayor (who in an amusing move is named after one of the top US 
film critics) is a caricature that has been stolen straight from `Jaws'. 
And the romance between Matthew Broderick and vacuous bubble-gum blonde 
Maria Pitillo is appallingly written. The good thing about the film is 
that it rarely ever slows down enough to allow these one-dimensional 
figures time on screen.</P>
<P>The film is at its best when it is, without any pretensions, doing 
exactly what it has been designed to do - being a BIG scale, big-budget, 
no frills, thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride of a monster movie. 
Something at which it succeeds more than admirably. Whenever Godzilla 
turns up on screen Emmerich unleashes some top drawer special effects - 
enthralling scenes of mass destruction with it smashing its way through 
downtown Manhattan and ripping swathes through entire skyscrapers with 
its tail alone; an oddly `Star Wars' Death Star trench-styled battle 
between it and army helicopters amid canyons of high-rise towers; an 
immensely exciting climax with it rampaging across and being trapped in 
a suspension bridge. Emmerich only unveils the creature gradually and 
keeps the camera down at ground level so as to heighten the sense of 
scale even more so. About three-quarters of the way through the film 
seems to abruptly kill Godzilla off and then gives the appearance of 
jumping tracks into another sort of film altogether with the principal 
characters fighting off a lethal bunch of baby Godzillas. The sequence 
is undeniably modelled after the raptor sequences in `Jurassic Park' but 
Emmerich whips it up into something intensely exciting. And as films go 
- compare it to the hollow soap opera of the same year's `Deep Impact' 
or the letdown that `The Lost World: Jurassic Park' was - you would be 
hard pressed to find any better adrenalin-charged, all-out effects 
excitement on the screen in the next while than `Godzilla'.</P>
