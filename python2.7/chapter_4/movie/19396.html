<P>Leave it up to Stanley Kubrick to spend the last two years of his life making 
the most humane, emotional motion picture of his career. A planned 
eight-month shoot that began in late 1996, the filming kept going, finally 
surpassing years of dedication on the parts of known-perfectionist Kubrick, 
and stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Two actors (Jennifer Jason Leigh, 
Harvey Keitel) dropped out after filming their roles due to scheduling 
conflicts, and so their scenes had to be reshot; filming for the actors 
making virtual cameos stretched from a couple weeks to several months; a 
cloak of secrecy was heavily shrouded over the particulars of the plot, and 
only weeks before the release was the premise confirmed; talk of a possible 
NC-17 rating due to soft-core sex scenes was denied when the picture got an 
R, and it was only days before its July 16 release that it was discovered 
images were digitally added, allegedly with Kubrick's permission before his 
death, in a now-hotly-debated and controversial 65-second sequence involving 
an orgy. Kubrick has, to be sure, always been a master of the camera and 
filmmaking in general (just take a gander at 1968's "2001: A Space Odyssey," 
1971's "A Clockwork Orange," and 1980's "The Shining" for proof of his 
one-of-a-kind nature), but his previous films all have had an obvious cold 
detachment about them. It wasn't a flaw on Kubrick's part, but simply one of 
the defining elements of each of his films. His latest, and final, triumph is 
"Eyes Wide Shut," which is a Kubrick picture in every sense of the word, 
except for in the lasting impression it leaves on the viewer. At once 
downbeat and intellectually-draining, the unforgettable characters that make 
up the world of "Eyes Wide Shut" nonetheless are more tender and, simply put, 
human, than in any of Kubrick's past films.</P>
<P>Set during the week before Christmas in New York City, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom 
Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), live in a large Central Park 
West apartment with their 7-year-old daughter, Helena (Madison Eginton). 
Happily married, when Bill and Alice make their way to a ritzy holiday party 
given by their friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), they find themselves 
both having to turn down members of the opposite sex that make sexual 
advances toward them. The next night, after smoking a little pot, Alice finds 
herself confessing to Bill that in the previous summer, while on vacation at 
Cape Cod, she briefly met a devastatingly handsome naval officer, and if he 
would have happened to want to be with her, she was ready to give up her 
husband, her daughter, her whole life, just for one night. Immediately 
afterwards, called to be told that one of his patients has died, Bill, 
emotionally distraught by his wife's revelation, sets off on a night-long 
odyssey of his own through the streets of Manhattan that concludes at a 
secluded and highly guarded mansion in which a suspicious masquerade ball is 
in full swing.</P>
<P>It's difficult to describe the premise of "Eyes Wide Shut" because, for one, 
the story has been so heavily secretive for so long that to say anymore 
wouldn't be fair, and two, words merely could never do justice to the film as 
a whole. Deliberately-paced and eerily beautiful, the film is an ultimately 
rewarding experience that, when all is said and done, adds up to 159 minutes 
of sheer cinema artistry. One of the biggest delights of "Eyes Wide Shut" is 
in its completely unpredictable nature. Rarely ever can you detect which 
direction the film is going in, or where things will end up, and, therefore, 
for the entire running time I was completely glued to the screen, eager to 
find out what would happen, and subsequently who we would meet, next. 
Reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries," the film is lyrical and 
passionate, but never sexually titillating as was so widely predicted, and 
there is a strange, rewarding fascination in watching one character go 
through his own journey, whether it be in physical or emotional terms.</P>
<P>Written by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael, "Eyes Wide Shut," like very few 
films I've seen, slowly but surely wrapped around me and put me under its 
rapturous spell. Every character, including each of the supporting ones, have 
been created with such subtle, truthful details that it would be very 
difficult to forget or not be affected in some way by all of them. Tom 
Cruise, often times, and unfairly, criticized for, in essence, playing the 
same role over and over again, strips away every one of those exterior 
pretenses this time around and never strikes a false note, handling every one 
of his difficult scenes with matured aplomb that I don't think I've ever seen 
from him. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman in a slightly smaller role than expected, 
is the heart and soul of the film, as the alternately distanced and loving 
Alice who, in a tour de force monologue, admits to, once, having the desire 
to put everything behind her simply to be with a stranger. "And yet," as she 
says to Bill, "at that exact moment I've never felt closer to you." A 
particularly moving, seemingly minor but vitally important moment, comes when 
Bill gets home from work later at night to find Alice helping their daughter 
with her school work. Alice clearly loves her child so very much, but as Bill 
observes her, he questions how she could ever have considered leaving her.</P>
<P>As for the supporting characters, no one is let off without making some sort 
of long-term impression. The now-23-year-old Vinessa Shaw, previously a teen 
actress (1992's "Ladybugs," 1993's "Hocus Pocus"), makes a warm, delicately 
touching turn as Domino, a prostitute whom Bill comes into contact with and, 
for one fleeting moment, finds a comforting solace in her understanding, 
strangely virtuous personality. Todd Field, as Bill's old medical school 
buddy, Nick Nightingale, who later dropped out and is now a piano player, 
works very well with Cruise and they have one scene together set in a small 
night club/bar that really cooks, both for the fabulous dialogue and their 
effortless accord with one another. Sydney Pollack is dynamite as the 
friendly Victor Ziegler who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his 
own. Pollack treats every one of his lines as if it were his last, and 
therefore, is able to make the character his own. In a scene towards the end 
between Bill and Victor, Pollack also happens to leave us with a 
thought-provoking notion: "Life goes on. It always does, until it doesn't." 
Rade Serbedgia, as a man who runs a costume shop, is memorably off-kilter and 
amusing, and as his sexually promiscuous teenage daughter, Leelee Sobieski 
lights up the screen with her angelically devilish smiles. And Faye 
Masterson, as Domino's roommate, Sally, has a poignant scene with Bill in 
which she reveals something that I never saw coming, and that may at first 
seem pointless but, on closer introspection, couldn't be any further from the 
truth.</P>
<P>The centerpiece of "Eyes Wide Shut," of course, coming midway through, is the 
private masquerade party that Bill manages to get into when he acquires the 
password. It should be noted that it is in this scene that the infamous 
65-second orgy occurs, in which digitally-created images were placed in front 
of the perverse sexual acts to only partially hide what was going on. At once 
ludicrous of the MPAA to treat American adults like children, the added 
figures really do look believable and, dare I say it, contributes to, rather 
than hurts, the dream-like air of the scene. As for the approximately 
17-minute sequence as a whole, things develop at such as gradual, foreboding 
pace, and aided magnificently by the ominous, red-letter music score, by 
Jocelyn Pook, which is the repetitive striking of two piano keys, that the 
suspense builds up to an almost unbearable crescendo. This scene is, by and 
far, virtuoso filmmaking, one of the most indelible moments on film this 
decade, and only goes to prove what a brilliant craftsman Kubrick was. 
Throughout the film, there are passing references to dreams, including one 
moment at the end when Alice suggests to Bill that they really should stop 
dreaming, in relegation to their potentially troubled marriage, and 
admittedly, the whole film feels like an ostensibly aimless dream with no 
final destination (which, in many ways, it does indeed have). The lighting 
cinematography by Larry Smith is perfect, choosing to go for a somewhat 
grainy, washed out look that only makes the often-seen colorful decorations 
and Christmas lights all the more powerful. Finally, the production design by 
Les Tomkins and Roy Walker, is sumptuous and wholeheartedly Kubrickesque 
(similar in look to "The Shining"), as they have taken the nearly impossible 
job of creating New York City on a London soundstage. Occasionally the sets 
look just as they are, sets, but that odd mixture of NYC realism and 
artificiality only compliments what the film is about.</P>
<P>So, what is "Eyes Wide Shut" about, anyway? No, I don't mean the clearcut 
story, but what exactly lies underneath that? One of the joys of Kubrick was 
in the way that he respected and treated his audience like thinking adults, 
to draw their own conclusion to many of his films' occurences. To me, "Eyes 
Wide Shut" is a morality tale in the classic tradition, about a married 
couple who, over a couple days, discover more about each other--their dreams, 
feelings, and fears--than they ever thought they would in a lifetime, and 
through that, must come to terms with their relationship, as well as their 
own decisions as individuals, before they can decide what will happen next. 
Truly unlike Kubrick, however, "Eyes Wide Shut" concludes with a marvelous, 
powerful last scene that ends on a relatively hopeful, positive note. As the 
screen went to black and the words, "Directed by Stanley Kubrick," filled the 
screen, the masterful, final chapter in Kubrick's highly-respected, 
forever-remembered life came to a close.</P>
