<P>The ground rumbles and quakes. But only in the background, as the
natives of an Indian jungle scatter before the set in front of the
front projection screen starts to puff forth clouds of smoke and dust
and break apart. Suddenly, the camera starts to shake violently.</P>
<P>Welcome to the wonderfully trite world of "THE MIGHTY PEKING MAN"
being re-released by Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures
outfit onto the midnight circuit. Originally released by a small New
York outfit, World Northal Films in 1978 as "Goliathon" was anything
but a hit both here and in it's native Hong Kong back in 1977. So why
bring the film back? Well, for the obvious reason being that any film
this adorably bad has to be seen.</P>
<P>Our story opens with the earthquake releasing a 100-foot tall missing
link. He terrorizes the natives and becomes a local myth. In 1977, a
local promoter, Lu Tiem (Ku Feng ) decides to investigate the legend,
in an attempt to capture the big beast and put him on display.  He is
told that the best explorer for the job is Johnny Feng (Danny Lee,
best known for his role in John Woo's 'The Killer'). Danny is drunk
and despondent, having discovered his wife having an affair with his
brother, so Danny has no qualms about packing up for the jungles of
India.</P>
<P>Once in the jungle, the team is besieged by an assortment of
dangers. A stampede of elephants, an attack of a very drugged tiger,
and assorted other misfortunes.  Finally, Lu Tiem turns his back on
Johnny, leaving him for dead. Johnny is rescued by Samantha (Evelyne
Kraft), a vivacious female Tarzan. Samantha has survived in the jungle
after the crash of her parent's plane when she was a child. Now
fully-grown and wearing a leather bikini (which threatens to fall off
throughout the film), Samantha nurses Johnny back to good health, with
the help of her protector, The Mighty Peking.</P>
<P>Johnny and Samantha soon start to become attracted to one another, and
their life in the jungle is idyllic. Samantha has not only grown into
a beautiful woman, but has developed a nurturing relationship with the
animals of the jungle. She wrestles with snakes, plays with large
beaked birds, and carries a leopard on her shoulders.</P>
<P>But Johnny grows tired of paradise and convinces Samantha to come with
him back to Hong Kong. She agrees, and the two of them set off for the
big city.  Unfortunately, Peking Man follows.  When the three of them
arrive in Hong Kong, Mighty Peking Man is captured and put on display,
showing off his strength to the amusement of the local populace.</P>
<P>Back in Hong Kong, Johnny is confronted by his estranged wife.  She
confesses her indiscretion, pleading with him to take her back. As
Johnny makes love to his wife, Samantha bursts into the
room. Heartbroken, Samantha runs to the stadium where the promoters
are tormenting The Peking Man. Pleadings with the promoters to release
the giant, Lu Tiem hits her. Peking Man summarily breaks out of his
cage and goes on a rampage throughout Tokyo (?) , sorry Hong Kong
until he is killed by the military. Johnny returns to Samantha's side
proclaiming his love for her and asking for her forgiveness. The two
lovers return to the jungle to live happily ever after.</P>
<P>There I've spoiled the whole thing for you. Don't believe that for a
minute. The plot of "Mighty Peking Man" is only one of its cheesy
pleasures. It's not that this film is unremittingly bad, it's just
that the earnestness involved does not always translate to the
screen. But the effort is so profoundly goofy that one can't help but
be drawn into the film. This is the perfect group night out feature. A
movie that cries out to be talked back to and laughed with.</P>
<P>There are some scenes that caused me some reservation, even
despair. The noticeably drugged leopard and tiger in the film are
painfully used as props. No concern for their well being is evidenced,
as the animals visibly labor to breathe. But, when one has to carry a
200 pound leopard on one's shoulder's and spin it around like your
little brother, I guess narcotics would be a necessity.  Still, those
scenes brought the film to a dead stop for me.</P>
<P>Some of the scenes with Evelyne Kraft as Samantha are just hilarious
to watch.  Not because of her performance, but due to the attention
she and her bikini cause. During the sequence where She and Johnny
leave the jungle for the city, the terrified villagers are to busy
staring at Evelyne to react properly to the attack of Mighty Peking
Man on their village. The sight of grown men in black face (yes, this
film is dreadfully not politically correct), screaming in fear at a
giant ape man while their eyes are fixed on Samantha's posterior, is
riotously amusing.</P>
<P>Director HO MENG-HUA has had a long career in Hong Kong films but
nothing could top this triumph of silliness and ineptitude. The
performances are nothing to write home about. But Evelyne Kraft exudes
a charm and innocents that is keeping with tone of the film. It's her
presents that makes the film work. And that bikini isn't a bad
attraction either. The special effects by TEISHO ARIKAWA are on a
level with the Godzilla films of the early 1970's and have a charm
that is hard to resist. While Peking Man is nothing more than a
stuntman in a hirsute with a mask on, there is something refreshing
about the presentation. A hand made quality, lacking from today's CGI
heavy films. No, there's not a once of believability here. But charm,
it has. The charms of a cheap plastic toy that we remember from our
childhood, but charm just the same.</P>
<P>On a scale of 1 to 5, "MIGHTY PEKING MAN" rates a 3. This is an
audience participation film, along the lines of 'Rocky Horror" (which
I dislike), or any other midnight movie. A party movie, but not one to
watch on your own. That, I cannot recommend.</P>
