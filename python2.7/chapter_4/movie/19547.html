<PRE>     " Lake Placid "          *</PRE>
<P>     "I just have this feeling that everything is completely safe," 
says the local sheriff, late in LAKE PLACID.  I don't think anyone 
in the film, or watching it, would disagree with him</P>
<P>This has got to be one of the worst creature flicks ever, because 
its creature, a giant crocodile, is so terribly lifeless.  Timid, too:  
a character played by Oliver Platt (he's an, um, croc-spert) is swimming 
very slowly backward, away from his subject, the crocodile following 
closely, and never once is there an attack at the opportune time.  Later, 
Bridget Fonda - forgive me, actual character names didn't stick - is 
engaged is some kind of underwater battle (and, BTW, when you finally 
do resurface, maybe be more out of breath so we can at least pretend you 
were down there that long) with the crocodile, as it languorously 
swings open its long jaws just at the potential victim's feet, but only 
tries for the kill once Fonda is safely behind a tree big enough only 
to shroud her tiny frame.  Could she outswim the beast, when we've already 
seen it swiftly lunge ashore and drag both a cow and a bear into the
water?  Not likely.  But, there's a trend:  no actor with star billing 
is killed.  Or, severely injured; not one of them.  Only in the beginning, 
with a diver tagging beaver, and then with a town deputy, do deaths occur.  
Ok - I sound morbid; don't mean to, it's just that with something that moves
as quickly as this crocodile does on land, to have it be so laidback
and non-threatening the rest of the time, namely during confrontations 
with most of the cast, is boring.  Earlier, the Platt character explains 
that freshwater crocs do not usually attack _in_ the water.  So, what about 
the aforementioned diver?  Or, Fonda's narrow escape?</P>
<P>Contradictions in logic aside, LAKE has a pleasant, sunny look, and 
some witty, insult-laden dialogue for Fonda.  All of which is cute, while 
it lasts; you can literally feel the film run out of energy and resources 
and plot, and then all but evaporate from the screen.  100 minutes seems 
like 30, here, because there's nothing going on.  And, every time our
monster makes an appearance, the effect is that of a wet blanket thrown 
over a wet blanket.  It moves too slow, but maybe that's because of it's 
age (150 years, we are told); plus, there was all that swimming from Asia.  
And, when it takes to land, it will thrash about, chomping every which 
direction, but will not make contact.  How unbelievably dull.</P>
<P>     Best line:  hard to choose one more ridiculous than, "Don't throw 
heads at me!"</P>
