<P>For a long time, Tom Cruise has been interested in making a
biopic about Steve Prefontaine, the champion American distance runner
who was killed in a car crash at the age of 24.  In the early pre-
production stages, Cruise was even attached to the role.  However, his
involvement here is limited to that merely of producer.</P>
<P>Like James Dean, Prefontaine was something of a cult hero, a
popular idol, who died tragically young while still at the start of
his promising career.  At the time of his death, Prefontaine remained
unbeaten in America, and many of the records he set 25 years ago
remain unbroken.  The film touches on his clashes with the sport's
governing body, his strong desire to win, and his crushing defeat in
the Munich Olympics.  His college romance with writer Mary Marckx
(Monica Potter, from Patch Adams, etc) is the least interesting
element of the film.</P>
<P>The most fascinating part of Without Limits centres on the
complex and volatile relationship between the cocky, arrogant and
strong willed Prefontaine and his brilliant coach and mentor Bill
Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).  Although the two men had different
philosophies about how to run a distance race, they slowly established
a mutual respect for each other's abilities.  Without Limits opens
during the 10,000 metres final at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and
unfolds in flashback, seen mainly from Bowerman's perspective.</P>
<P>Writer/director Robert Towne, who last ventured into this
territory with Personal Best, brings some genuine suspense to the
running sequences.  It is the numerous race sequences that bring some
excitement and energy to this otherwise routine biopic.</P>
<P>Billy Crudup (from Inventing The Abbotts, etc) brings a
brashness, vitality and raw sex appeal to his performance as the
charismatic Prefontaine.  So often cast as the villain or the dry
authority figure, Sutherland rarely gets a chance to show what a
superb performer he is when given a decent role.  As Pre's coach he
gets a rare opportunity to deliver a subtle and insightful
performance, and he brings a spark to the film.</P>
<P>Without Limits is actually the second film to depict the life
of the famous runner, following the lacklustre Pre, which disappeared
straight to video.  This stylish and superbly crafted biopic is very
American in tone, and is ultimately more concerned with worshipping
Prefontaine's achievements rather than offering personal insights into
the man.  It is also ultimately a story of particular appeal only to
American audiences, with its international appeal limited mainly to
those with an interest in athletics and sports biographies.</P>
<PRE>**1/2
