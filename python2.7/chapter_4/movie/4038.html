<PRE>                           THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Three Irish-American brothers in a
          lower middle-class neighborhood confide in each
          other as they work out their personal
          relationships.  The writing is generally decent,
          but plotting has problems.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to
          +4)  [A spoiler comment follows the review.]</PRE>
<P>     Filmmaking can be a big international industry and it can be a
small cottage industry.  THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN is one of the films
produced in informal manner.  It was made over eight months of weekends
in Edward Burns's house with Burns's mother cooking for the cast and
crew.  Burns wrote, co-produced, directed, and acted in the film.  The
other producer, incidentally, was Dick Fisher who also filmed the movie
and edited.  The film was shot on 16-millimeter and blown up to 35-
,millimeter giving it a grainy look and making even the bright scenes
seem dim.</P>
<P>     The senior McMullen was an abusive, alcoholic, wife-beater.  He
died five years earlier, totally unlamented.  His wife returned to
Ireland to marry the man she really loved when McMullen made her
pregnant.  That leaves three sons, ages 22 to 33, living in the same
house.  Each is at a different stage of relationships with the opposite
sex.  Youngest son Patrick (Mike McGlone) has a Jewish girlfriend who
is making plans for future with Patrick working for her father. Barry
(Edward Burns) wants to remain a bachelor all his life. and Jack (Jack
Mulcahy) appears happily married but is not sure he wants to take the
next step and have a child.  This is a family that talks and can freely
criticize each other's behavior toward women.  Much of the film is
filled with the brothers asking each other and other people
philosophical questions like "Are you better off alone than with
someone who is not your soulmate?"  Each seems to represent a different
aspect of a group personality.  Patrick, for example, is the conscience
of the family.  He takes his Catholicism very seriously and sees his
brothers' behavior in stern, moralistic terms.  But the most serious
problem with the plot is in the spoiler comment at the end of the
review.</P>
<P>     Considering that this film was made the way it was, it is not
surprising that there are no familiar faces in the cast, nor are any
really needed.  The acting is uniformly very good, indicating that
Burns is already a better director than many with more experience.  The
continuity of the performances is all the more impressive when one
considers that this is a film shot mostly in weekends and in spare
time.  There is not a bad performance and the presence of some actors
who don't look like actors is a definite plus.  There are none of the
bad performances one often finds in informal productions like this one.
Occasionally there is some uneven camerawork including a few
disorienting extreme closeups in the middle of a scene.  There are also
some continuity problems.</P>
<P>     But overall Burns has his story to tell and his characters to
create and he does it in fine form.  My major complaint with his script
takes the form of a spoiler and so follows the review.  I give this
film a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER</P>
<P>     The real problem with the script of THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN is the
sheer predictability of the subplots.  There are three stories and each
story telegraphed what was going to happen.  In each case it was the
simplest and most obvious conclusion to the story.  Burns has to learn
how to put a little bit of spin on the ball.  Humorous dialogue and
some characterization are nice in telling a story, but there needs to
be a story to tell.</P>
