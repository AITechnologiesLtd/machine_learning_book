<P>     Kevin Smith's raunchy romantic comedy, of the boy-meets-lesbian
variety, has one of the smartest scripts that we'll likely see this
year.  Oh, sure, the writer/director of CLERKS and the underappreciated
MALLRATS covers his fair share of familiar ground.  That the main
characters are comic-book artists is no surprise.  Nor are the many
"R"-rated discussions of sexual practices.  (One, ah, cunning linguist
cites CNN and the Weather Channel and his need for "constant updates.")
What's new for the Smithster-- who also reprises his role as Silent Bob,
for one scene-- is a poignancy that creeps into the characters and their
situations.  (The subject of a young man trying to accept his partner's
sexual past is, indeed, heart-breaking.) Alas, the downside to this
wonderfully written (and side-splitting funny) work is that it's also
*directed* by Kevin Smith.  He's getting better with tone, I'll give him
that, but his choice of actors still leaves a lot to be desired.  The
worst offender, by far, is lead actress Joey Lauren Adams.  With her
Joker grin and Jennifer Tilly voice, she's instantly off-putting.  Bring
cotton for your ears.</P>
