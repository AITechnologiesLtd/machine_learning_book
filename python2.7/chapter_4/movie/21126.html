<P>   Move over Ingmar Bergman.  Only a relative handful of
American moviegoers ever saw your "Scenes from a
Marriage," however honest and searing a portrait that
wrenching 168-minute film.  Here in America, we have
another voice telling us about the disintegration of a
marriage, and what's more, he tells all in English so that we
don't have to read those pesky titles or hear people like Max
von Sydow endlessly drone, "It was the bleak winter following
a wet and discouraging summer, a time that Eva was birthing
her fourth child and thinking of going away for a spell..."</P>
<P>  Just kidding, Ingmar, nobody will compare with you when it
comes to depressing the heck out of us about the miseries of
matrimony, but even you might get a kick out of Rob Reiner's
mixture of comedy and pathos in "The Story of Us."  The
picture is loaded with side-splitting side roles, particularly
those involving the director who is acting in his own
production, with whimsical one-liners thrown in by the frizzy-
haired Rita Wilson, a trio of full-of-themselves psychologists,
a literary agent, and even an irrelevant piece of nonsense
from none other than Red Buttons as the wife of perennial
AARP spokesperson Betty White.  What's more Reiner
coaxes yet another surprisingly adept performance by Bruce
Willis who once again does not lay his finger on a gun, and
gets some movement from one of my least favorite gorgeous
actresses, Michelle Pfeiffer.</P>
<P>   "The Story of Us" is about history: not about the sort that
begins in Sumer but the history of a marriage: how it begins
as two people fall in lust, how, like the good citizens of
Sumer and Troy they build something (in this case a couple
of model kids), and how like all glorious civilizations they fall
apart.  The ending is an out-and-out copout, because Reiner
is not Bergman and American moviegoers are presumably
not as realistic and down-to-earth as Swedes.  If you left the
theater four minutes before the conclusion, as some did
believing that the movie had already run its course, you were
lucky to miss the contrived conclusion.  Notwithstanding, the
picture ranks as a insightful if not brilliant piece of story-telling
that does not quite rise to the level of myth.  The Big Truth
about relationships, though--that honeymoons last for only a
year or two--is already too well known by most of us, even if
we act as though we'd never heard the concept.</P>
<P>   In Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson's screenplay, Reiner
relates the highs and lows of a 15-year marriage between two
people who--by the looks of them--should never have had the
troubles they experienced. Unfortunately they each had a
different pair of parents who indoctrinated them in distinct
ways, so that when one marriage counselor advises that
"when you go to bed, there are six people lying with you" and
when Reiner graphically illustrates this well-known idea, we
get the point.</P>
<P>   Reiner uses a stage device sparingly and effectively.  From
time to time, Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben Jordan (Bruce
Willis) face the camera separately and tell us in the audience
what's on their minds. Each is eager to have the viewers as
allies.  You can tell from their soliloquies, though, that as
much as they expect to split, they dream of reconciling their
differences.  Katie composes crossword puzzles for her boss
while Ben is a novelist.  Ben is the more spontaneous
person, one who does not even wear a watch, while Katie is
more the type who goes through life on schedules.  Ben
declares aloud to Katie, in full volume, "You turned into your
god-damned mother," while Katie muses, "When is the
moment in a marriage when a spoon becomes just a spoon?"</P>
<P>   Each time the two are getting along just fine, one of them
says something that sounds to us innocent enough, but that's
all it takes to set off another war of the roses.  Bruce Willis as
Ben and Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife of 15 years, Katie, do
not really convince us that what they say can be responsible
for these orgies of verbal destruction, but anyone who has
been married as long as their characters have been can
relate to the fact that just about anything can be used as an
excuse to let off steam.</P>
<P>   The real fun comes from side characters, though,
particularly director Rob Reiner in the role of Ben's best
friend.  In one discussion, he uses a down-to-earth illustration
to prove his point.  "Look at me," he suggests to Ben, leaning
over.  "What do you see?"  "Your ass," replies Ben, the
seemingly obvious answer.  "Wrong.  I don't have an ass.
That is an illusion.  This is just the tops of legs butting
together--that's why they call it a butt. Love is an illusion, just
like the ass.  Love is lust."  When Katie gets together with her
best friends, played by Rita Wilson and Julie Hagerty, they
too discuss the nature of relationships, taking a similarly pithy
route, with even more ribald terminology than that used by
the men.  </P>
<P>   What is most diverting about the flashbacks is the mere
sight of the characters as they appeared fifteen years back. 
Ben, now with thinning hear, sports hippie-ish locks and Katie
looks dazzling with her hair long and flowing freely.  The
scene shot in Venice, where the troubled couple went to try
to repair their regressive marriage, is especially convincing
and droll, particularly when Ben and Katie meet "the Kirbys
from Cleveland," each the epitome of the ugly American.  </P>
<P>   The tagline for the film is, "Can a marriage survive 15
years of marriage?"  Ingmar Bergman and Rob Reiner have
different answers, each suitable for his own kind of audience. 
Bergman's is the more realistic.  Reiner's will bring in the box
office.  So then: "The Story of Us"--a worthwhile feature in
the Rob Reiner comic tradition with two perfectly fine
performances by Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.</P>
