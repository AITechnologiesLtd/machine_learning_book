                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
           3 *** out of 4 **** for an insect movie with a bite</PRE>
<P>ANTZ (DreamWorks) Voices: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman,
Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft.
Screenplay: Todd Alcott and Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz.
Producers: Brad Lewis, Aron Warner and Patty Wooton.
Directors: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson</P>
<P>In what is undoubtedly one of the funniest insect movies to date (there
haven't been that many, one other comes to mind - MICROCOSMOS, was
unintentionally funny) we are presented with a rare product of clever
devices. DreamWorks has used the miracle of computer generated graphics
to bring across a heart warming story of how being an individual is
integral to being a part of society. Using the neurosis of a very Woody
Allen character, we are charmed with something that Disney would have
been proud to present to the public.</P>
<P>This movie is littered with an impressive profile of Hollywood actors.
You will know who they are, even if you don't recognise their voice.
Stallone plays another caring, sensitive big guy role that brought him
critical acclaim in COPLAND - pulls out his droll voice for ‘Weaver' the
ant who gets hurt for a friend. I'm not sure whether Sharon Stone will
ever come close to royalty, but she gets her chance as ‘Bala', the ant
princess with an attitude. Gene Hackman thrives when it comes to guys
you love to hate and ‘General Mandible' is no exception. Whilst
Chritopher Walken does something less typical and allows his conscience
to take a turn for the better in the end. There are many more fame
names, but the movie really belongs to Z-4195 (Woody Allen). His
character comes across like something the comedian would have written
about himself, and was undoubtedly written with him in mind.</P>
<P>This is a commendable effort containing computer generated graphics,
adult and kiddy humour, mixed in with relevant social issues. A very
entertaining, innovative enterprise from the DreamWorks team.</P>
