                                  [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>The Devil's Own (1997) *1/2 out of ***** - Cast: Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt,
Ruben Blades, Treat Williams. Written by: David Aaron Cohen, Vincent Patrick
and Kevin Jarre. Directed by: Alan J. Pakula. Running Time: 107 minutes.</P>
<PRE>                  *** This Review Contains Spoilers. ***</PRE>
<P>"The Devil's Own" has every reason to be a good film: a good cast, a good
premise, and a respected director. But what it lacks is much more important:
logic, interest, and entertainment.</P>
<P>Despite his second billing, Brad Pitt stars as a IRA terrorist who is
brought over to the United States (thanks to a corrupt judge) to purchase
guided missiles to help with the war in Ireland. Now as the movies begins,
we learn that Pitt has killed more than 20 people. Then we get to see him
blow a few more away. And we are supposed to like this guy? The film sure
wants us to, making Pitt seem warm and fuzzy. The film has already reached
its first problem, and only 10 minutes have elapsed. Terrorists are not our
friends, no matter how attractive they may be considered to be.</P>
<P>The corrupt judge moves Pitt into the basement of Harrison Ford, a New York
City cop with a wife and three daughters. In movie time, it seems as though
Pitt has only lived there one week, but we are supposed to believe that
these two men have somehow bonded. I never bought it, and the film has
achieved it's second problem.</P>
<P>Pitt attempts to buy these missiles from a stereotypical bad guy with no
personality (Treat Williams). Of course something goes wrong with the deal,
and FINALLY, an hour into the film, the plot starts to begin. Williams sends
bad guys to find the money, which is hidden in Ford's home. As they are
searching, Ford and his wife arrive home. The three men attack them. Now,
after that settles, Ford is understandably angry at Pitt for bringing this
into his home. He sets out to bring Pitt to justice.</P>
<P>During the film's yawn-inducing first hour (where I actually became
fascinated by my watch for about 10 minutes, before remembering that there
was a movie going on), we keep seeing scenes of Ford being a cop. Why? To
justify his top billing? To give him something to do is most likely. Then he
gets involved in a mind-numbingly overused subplot about his partner (Ruben
Blades) killing a suspect by accident. Also, the film completely gives away
the ending during its first hour, when Ford confesses to Pitt that he's
never killed anyone. Hmmmmm.</P>
<P>During the second hour, Ford's character is obviously angry, as he should
be. Yet no matter what Pitt does, he can't bring himself to hate him. This
is a major flaw. You've got a terrorist who's ruining a cop's life yet still
presented as squeaky clean, and the cop chasing him who seems to be angry at
everyone else BUT the terrorist. There's never any conflict in the film, and
conflict is what DRIVES a suspense-thriller.</P>
<P>"The Devil's Own" (and what is the title referring to?) reportedly cost $95
million to make. $95 million! And for what, to see Harrison Ford shoot Brad
Pitt? Come on. Like I said, my watch was more interesting. [R]</P>
