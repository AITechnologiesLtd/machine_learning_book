<PRE>"The Patriot" -- Life, Liberty and Happiness
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"The Patriot," a powerful and impressive looking
period piece set during the American Revolution, tells
the story of a family being torn apart by war and a
father torn between duty to his family and duty to his
country.  Full of stirring moments, it is a sweeping
saga that showcases beautifully filmed and brilliantly
choreographed battles, a patriotic soundtrack that
combines the reverie of fife and drums with majestic
orchestrations, and utterly unbridled flag-waving
jingoism.  I can barely contain my enthusiasm and am
saluting as I write this.</P>
<P>In 1776, the American colonists have come to a
critical juncture.  Fed up with British rule,
revolutionaries charge that "if principles dictate
independence, then war is the only way."  However,
countless lives will be lost, though the sacrifice in
the name of freedom is worthwhile.  Benjamin Martin
(Mel Gibson) hopes that instead of voting for war,
America might adopt a more diplomatic course of
action.  Benjamin was once a brilliant military
tactician and warrior, but is now the loving parent of
seven.  He doesn't wish to leave them fatherless.  "I
am a parent," he says.  "I don't have the luxury of
principles."</P>
<P>Although Benjamin remains adamant about his pacifist
stance, his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) is
compelled by the crusade.  Against his father's
wishes, he enlists, grateful to serve the cause of
liberty.  But he is horrified to see the
disorganization of the American army.  The Red Coats
are an impressive force who marches into battle with
an imposing cadence.  Going muzzle-to-muzzle against
them in an open field is madness.  The American front
lines continually collapse, leading to swift defeats. 
General Cornwallis of the British Army states, "those
rustics are so inept that it takes the honor out of
victory."</P>
<P>Eventually, the battle winds up right on Benjamin's
front lawn.  His political stance is shattered when he
encounters the ruthless Colonel Tavington (Jason
Isaacs).  Gabriel is captured; their plantation home
is burned to the ground.  Tavington doesn't abide by
the rules of war and displays a brutality that is
horrifying.  He shoots innocent children, mercilessly
kills prisoners-of-war, and even locks dozens of
people inside a church and then instructs his men to
burn it down.  This is the kind of villain that
elicits boos from the audience.  It's impossible not
to hate him, and the audience will not find
satisfaction unless he dies by the hand of Benjamin.</P>
<P>We increasingly cheer for our
pacifist-turned-revolutionary hero, as he becomes
something of a colonial Robin Hood.  Recruiting men
throughout the countryside, he employs guerrilla
tactics and mounts a series of successful skirmishes. 
In addition to his superb military skills, he is also
adept at humiliating the enemy.  We find much levity
in watching him make a mockery of General Cornwallis. 
Yet like the American army, who is outmanned and
outmatched, so too is Benjamin.  As the battle wears
on, personal losses begin to mount.  </P>
<P>However, the colonists' and Benjamin's fighting spirit
never dies.  Even in the darkest of moments, there is
time for a miraculous turnaround.  This leads to a
final, glorious engagement between the
Colonial/British forces and between Benjamin Martin
and Colonel Tavington.  An American victory may turn
the tide of war.  And for our hero, payback may be
close at hand.  This sequence, with flying
cannonballs, thousands of soldiers fighting, and its
swings in momentum are nothing less than riveting.</P>
<P>"The Patriot" packs as much raw power and energy as
any fireworks display and is certainly one of the best
films of the year.  Gibson gives a compelling
Oscar-worthy performance full of passion, courage and
strength.  As far as summer movies go, this film is as
good as it gets, featuring bold emotions, an epic
storyline, incredibly visualized battle sequences and
a monumental dramatic arc.  To miss this film would be
an act of treason.</P>
