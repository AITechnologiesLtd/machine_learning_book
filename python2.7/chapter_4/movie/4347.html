<PRE>(**1/2 out of four)</PRE>
<P>     I haven't seen many other James Bond movies to compare this new
one to (translation: zero), but it stands on its own as a decent action
flick.  I did find it an uneven movie to be mainly appreciated by
middle-aged adults who grew up on the Connery Bond films of the 60's
and are in need of something to cling on to in light of the recent wave
of P.C.-laden movies and sex-killer flicks.  And I was pretty much
proven right when my mom asked me how I liked it and I said "It was
okay." She replied, "Are you kidding? I loved that movie." And yes, I
do still see movies with my mother.  What's it to you?</P>
<P>     GOLDENEYE, at least, plays the outdated Bond movie staples for
laughs.  What else can you do but snicker at a movie with a
White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant hero, an abnormal ratio of cigarette
smokers to non-smokers, helpless women, Russian villains, absurd
high-tech gadgets, explosions, red convertible sports cars and
ridiculously far-fetched death defying scenes?  Add in a beautiful yet
villainous masochist woman (Xenia Onatopp) who gets off on her fights
with Bond and the movie may as well be a time machine to a
long-forgotten era.  I was waiting for them to talk about President
Nixon or hot pants.</P>
<P>     Pierce Brosnan does a good job of playing 007 (which represents
his agent number and his I.Q.) here and, as usual, James Bond gets all
the chicks while making the world safe for kids to play in the
streets.  And what does he get for his efforts? People call him a
"sexist, misogynist dinosaur." This time, Bond has to protect the world
from a missile system that short circuits all the world's electricity,
undoing the progress the world has made in the last century.  Please,
this movie is far enough in the Stone Age already.</P>
