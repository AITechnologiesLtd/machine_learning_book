Susan Granger's review of "I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"
(Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P> After its predecessor, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," did
screamingly well at the box-office, a sequel was inevitable. Jennifer
Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. are back but, this time, they're
spending a Fourth of July weekend on a remote Bahamian island which
seems a perfect locale for the stabbings, shootings, and stranglings
that occur in the predictable script by Trey Callaway, directed by
Danny Cannon. The premise set up in the original film is that four
teenagers are being hunted by a hook-handed fisherman, the victim of a
supposedly fatal hit-and-run automobile accident that took place in
North Carolina. Two of the original four are back, along with the
vengeful Muse Watson, joined now by the pop singer Brandy and her
boy-friend, Mekhi Phifer, along with clean-cut Matthew Settle. They
have won this trip, courtesy of a radio station contest, and check
into a seedy hotel where the desk clerk murmurs, "I see four spoiled
city kids who would not know a hurricane if it blew up their ass."
Which is somewhat relevant since a hurricane's approaching. Like its
predecessor, there are the usual false alarms and bloody butchery as
the body-count rises. What made the original somewhat interesting was
trying to figure out the identity of the killer, plus the lingering
suspicion that one of the perky, paranoid four friends was at
fault. Both those elements are missing from this cheesy,
teens-in-jeopardy chiller. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer" is a slasher 3. It's just another
formulaic fright flick.</P>
