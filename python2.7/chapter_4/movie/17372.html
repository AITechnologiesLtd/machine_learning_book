Susan Granger's review of "THE RAGE: CARRIE 2" (MGM/United Artists)</PRE>
<P>       This sequel is so forgettable you probably won't even want to
bother renting it on video. "Carrie," the powerful 1976 film based on
the best-selling Stephen King novel and directed by Brian DePalma,
spawned a number of teenage-slasher pictures but this travesty,
written by Rafael Moreu ("Hackers") and directed by Katt Shea ("Poison
Ivy"), tarnishes the memory of the original.  Bright-eyed newcomer
Emily Bergl plays Rachel, a nasty high-school outcast bursting with
adolescent rebellion and rage. Her mother is confined to a sanitarium;
she lives in a trailer with emotionally abusive foster parents; and
her best friend just committed suicide by jumping from the school's
roof after the girl was humiliated as a sex object by a group of
football players who made a competitive game of seducing girls for
points. A whiny guidance counselor, Amy Irving (the only token
original "Carrie" alumna), recognizes the potential destructiveness of
Rachel's telekinetic powers - meaning she can move objects with her
mind - but fails to get out of the way when Rachel's emotions explode,
ignited by her relationship with a football jock, Jason
London. "Sometimes I wish I could be one of the shiny, happy people,"
muses Rachel before she begins her post-homecoming game party massacre
- causing one of many unintentional laughs. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "The Rage: Carrie 2" is a viciously predictable 2 with a
fiery, bloody, gruesome conclusion.</P>
