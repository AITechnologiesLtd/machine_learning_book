<P>What do you get for the man that has everything?  Apparently a mindless
remake.  John McTiernan's (Die Hard) version of the 1968 film starring
Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway falls short of actual amusement and is
even occasionally excruciating – save the brilliant ending that easily
one-ups its predecessor.  Leonard Maltin called the original `perfect
non-think entertainment,' and the remake offers more of the same.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) plays Thomas Crown, an art-loving
multimillionaire who spends his time plotting the perfect heist.  Like
the original, most of the film's first half-hour is devoted to the theft
of a valuable painting from a museum (originally just over $2 million,
but here a $100 million Monet). Catherine Banning (Rene Russo, Lethal
Weapon 4) is an insurance agent for the museum and, together with NYPD
detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary, True Crime), immediately suspects
Crown and tries to mount her case against him.  The trouble is that
somewhere along the line, Banning mounts more than her case.</P>
<P>Casting-wise, the suave and debonair Brosnan is a much better choice
than McQueen, but Russo is downright horrible in Dunaway's role.  She
looks awful and acts even worse.  Leary seems lost as the cop and the
film could have used more of his sarcastic spunk.  The score never
really seemed to fit the picture, and viewers will have a hard time
connecting with any of the characters.  Those responsible for the
updated script include Leslie Dixon (the abominable That Old Feeling)
and Kurt Wimmer (Sphere).  Of other note, viewers should now know to be
wary of any film that prominently displays a bowler hat (remember The
Avengers?).</P>
<P>Alan Trustman's original screenplay (he also wrote the superior McQueen
vehicle Bullitt) may have seemed invigorating in 1968, but today seems
as stale as a cardboard pizza with felt pepperoni – especially since we
all recently suffered through a very similar cat-and-mouse chase in
Entrapment.  The original, directed by Norman Jewison (Moonstruck), was
shot by the legendary Haskell Wexler (Limbo) and included the use of
what I like to call Brady Bunch windows – several smaller multi-image
screens that make up the entire frame.  Also look for Dunaway, who plays
Crown's shrink in the updated version.  (1:55 - R for nudity, some
sexuality and language)</P>
