<P>SUCH IS LIFE (Así Es La Vida) (director/writer: Arturo Ripstein; screenwriter:
Alicia Paz Garciadiego; cinematographer: Guillermo Granillo; editor: Carlos
Puente; cast: Arcelia Ramirez (Julia), Luis Felipe Tovar (Nicolás), Patricia
Reyes Spindola (Adela, The Godmother), Ernesto Yanez (Pig), Francesca Guillen
(Raquel); Runtime: 98; Filmania Production; 2000-Spain/France/Mexico) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Filmed by the outstanding Mexican director Arturo Ripstein in digital video on a
hand-held camera (the video was later transferred to 35 millimeter). This film
has a different look to it, as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft
yellows. Otherwise the film failed to sparkle, as it updated the ancient Greek
drama Medea by setting it into Mexico City's barrio where there occurs a
low-class family struggle. There was nothing added to it that was novel, except
a mariachi band is on hand as a Greek chorus. They added a touch of black humor.</P>
<P>In the Greek drama, Medea's memorable deed was to murder her two children by
Jason when he left her to marry a princess. </P>
<P>Here, Julia (Arcelia Ramirez), is an emotionally wrought homeopathic doctor and
abortionist, who is torn apart because the one she loves with all her heart and
the father of her two children, Nicolás (Luis Felipe Tovar), is a bastard
abandoning her to marry a younger woman. He's a slimy, unsuccessful boxer who
adheres to a macho philosophy, and has taken up with his equally slimy, obese
slumlord's (Yanez) virgin daughter Raquel (Guillen). He plans to marry her
tomorrow and also wants to keep the children; and, because they will live in the
slumlord's apartment building Julia is being kicked out of her apartment. She's
about to lose everything she considers important by tomorrow, and goes into a
desperate rant about life's injustice for the rest of the film. She's also
fueled to anger against men by her man-hating godmother who would like to
castrate all men. The slumlord is aptly called Pig as he is seen walking around
the courtyard as if he were a king in a mental institution, dressed in a
bathrobe with food or drink in hand. </P>
<P>Ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play
exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the
outside influences facing the alienated Julia. There's a television set
constantly playing and appearing on it is an unhappy woman weather reporter who
complains about the expected rain; a mariachi band sings a number of boleros and
also ballads commenting on Julia's destiny, as they become what goes for a Greek
chorus; there's also a porn flick that plays while Nicolás and Raquel are
screwing. I wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes, in fact I thought
they were pretentious. </P>
<P>Almost the entire film is a boring rant by Julia, where a fine actress like
Arcelia Ramirez 
just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side. Her classical
story didn't play like great drama, but felt more like soap opera or a tragic
headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing
her children for no logical reason. All the drama evaporated from this
presentation, as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the
interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard. Yet
this film shouldn't be totally ignored, as the auteur director took chances with
this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look
to it. That alone should earn him applause for the effort made. At least, his
film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today. </P>
<P>The overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a
story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera. It
unfortunately comes off as too distant (it's lost in the mundane world for the
answers to Julia's problems) for the viewer to empathize with Julia's internal
misery. It also suffers from comparison to other Medea presentations--so many
great versions of it were put on as plays, plus the film versions by Pasolini
and von Trier were far superior. </P>
