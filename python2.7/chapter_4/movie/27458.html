<PRE>"State and Main" – A Lovable Place to Be
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Things can get somewhat bizarre when a cynical
director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), experiences
increasing frustration as the deadline to finish his
movie approaches but all of his key personnel can't
seem to jell.  Top writer, Joseph White (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman), is suffering from a bout of writer's
block.  Lead actress, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica
Parker) has major doubts about her nude scenes. 
Meanwhile, lead actor, Bob Barringer (Alec Baldwin),
invariably halts production because he has a yen for
teenage girls which leads to trouble with the law. 
"Everybody has to have a hobby," he tries to explain. 
His indiscretion has forced the movie company to
relocate to a sleepy Vermont town to finish shooting
their project.  But wherever they go, havoc continues
to ensue.</P>
<P>"State and Main" is a sharp satire about the
moviemaking business and some of the strange politics
and happenings that goes on offscreen.  Some of what
happens is the happy result of being in the world of
show biz.  Some of what happens is the diplomacy that
must be exercised by the director to pamper the
actors, soothe the townsfolk who are afraid of the
encroachment of Hollywood power, and save the company
from financial and public devastation.  Meanwhile,
some of what happens becomes fodder for tabloids.</P>
<P>This film's story touches upon all three of these
themes with the most enjoyable being that of the
writer who unexpectedly falls in love with one of the
townsfolk, Ann Black (Rebecca Pidgeon).  With similar
backgrounds, they are like kindred spirits to one
another.  Unfortunately, she is already engaged to an
ambitious politician who is very uneasy with the movie
company's presence.</P>
<P>The darkest sequence involves Bob Barringer and his
latest object of desire, Carla (Julia Stiles).  He may
have a weakness for young, beautiful girls, but the
odd thing is that she is just as saucy as he is weak. 
Inevitably, scandal rears its ugly head, and the first
one to jump at exposing any wrongdoing is the
aforementioned politician.</P>
<P>Of course, all of these crises must be handled
appropriately by the director.  With emotions ranging
from gentle coddling to unbridled hysteria, the
beleaguered Walt Price does what he can to ensure that
the production moves forward.  He'll do and say just
about anything to, for example, keep his lead actress
happy even though she protests the nude scene; coax
the easily wounded writer into massive rewrites; and
persuade prosecutors to look the other way.  "It's a
gift for fiction," he says.  And, when his actions are
not enough, the producer (David Paymer) jumps in to
verbally brawl with and intimidate anyone who
jeopardizes the production.</P>
<P>This is an amiable comedy about big time people in a
small town setting that showcases uniformly good
performances from its ensemble cast.  In particular,
Macy does a fine job at anchoring the film as he tries
desperately to keep the escalating production woes
from spinning out of control.  And while there is lots
of silliness in its satire, the subplot between the
writer and bookstore owner (amusingly named White and
Black) is also engaging and endearing.  You'll find
lots to like grin about in small town America, and in
particular, in a place called "State and Main."</P>
