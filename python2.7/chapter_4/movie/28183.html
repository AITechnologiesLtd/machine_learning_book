<PRE>                             THAT DARN PUNK
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>This unapologetic indie certainly feels like a festival-circuit entry. 
Alas, no -- Kung Fu Films has poured its $21,000 into That Darn Punk
with intent to make a profit.  Hence, it's straight to video and a big
soundtrack release.</P>
<P>Foolish?  Hardly.  According to the press notes, soundtrack preorders
have covered the cost of production fourfold.  Now that's a business
plan!</P>
<P>It's no surprise the soundtrack is inspiring some enthusiasm.  Scored by
The Ataris, Nerf Herder, Rancid, AFI, No Motiv, Lagwagon, The Vandals,
and a half-dozen other punkish outfits, That Darn Punk is indeed an ode
to, well, punk.  And its star, Joe Escalante, just so happens to be the
bassist for The Vandals.</P>
<P>So what's it all about?  Oh, the plot.  Yeah.  Well, Escalante plays a
punk rocker in a Vandals-like band called The Big Tippers, and after an
ill-advised near-fling with a music video moll, his girlfriend kicks him
out in nothing but his boxers, he is abducted and taken to the desert,
and a series of wacky hijinks involving murder, drugs, and aliens occurs
-- all so unlikely that you'll be drawing comparisons to Ed Wood flicks.</P>
<P>It's not a bad comparison to make.  That Darn Punk is goofy fun with
basement-level production values a la Repo Man.  Is it a witty ride
through existentialism?  No.  Is it something you might want to put on
at a party if for no other reason than to hear the kickin' soundtrack
and hope that your drunken guests will get a laugh out of the video?</P>
<PRE>Ah, perfect.</PRE>
