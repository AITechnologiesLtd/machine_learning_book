<PRE>Manhattan Murder Mystery</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Anjelica Houston</P>
<P>     OK, I like New York.  Unless you're from the city, or have ever lived
in it, you probably hate it.  But, as the opening song of Manhattan Murder
Mystery states, Woody Allen happens to like New York.  Because he likes New
York so much, almost every movie that has him in it, including, although it
isn't quite revealed until the end, Antz completely takes place in the Big
Apple.  A couple, Manhattan and Manhattan Murder Mystery, have even taken
their titles from it.</P>
<P>     Woody Allen fans shoot me here, but I've never seen Manhattan.  Going
from Manhattan Murder Mystery, though, you might wonder if he's playing to
the stereotypes.  Playing to the stereotypes is my only complain in this
bizarre mystery about a next-door neighbor's plans to murder his wife.  It
takes the easy punches at New Yorkers.  But, hey, with a place that has as
many people in need of electroshock as New York does, can we blame him?</P>
<P>     Manhattan Murder Mystery follows a couple (Woody Allen and Diane
Keaton, seen before in Annie Hall) whose kid has left for college and are
now living their lives out on the Upper West Side.  They go to Rangers games
and the theatre and the opera.  They hang out with their divorced friends,
plan their dreams of resturaunts, and go to work.  Oh, yeah, and this couple
suspects their next door neighbor of murdering his wife.</P>
<P>     Although Allen is trepidatious about confronting a murder at first, the
bland urban lives of Allen, his wife, his wife's friend (Alda), and the
writer Allen edits (Houston), get caught up in the Manhattan murder mystery
offered before them.  It is a chance for a bunch of paranoid urbanites to
have fun: a rare oppertunity.</P>
<P>     Going to Jersey for late-night discussions on how to nab the killer,
sneaking into apartments, faking phone conversations.  All of this is in the
mix for the four bland individuals given a chance to be psychotic little
children for a change.  It is all a game to these four.  There really isn't
a concern about morals, only about having fun.</P>
<P>     Also thrown into the mix is an interesting arangement.  Woody Allen
suspects that Diane Keaton is in love with Alan Alda.  She, in turn,
suspects that good old posterchild for neurotics Woody is in love with
Angelica Houston.  And, of course, they're trying to set up Houston and Alda
at the same time.</P>
<P>     Besides Woody Allen's unique touch, Manhattan Murder Mystery is a
fairly normal and mainstream film.  What bothered most critics, but will
never bother me, is Woody Allen's diatribe of neurosis.  As always, the
compound insanity that he delivers, the one liners that insult himself and
New York, and other things that convince you that you may not be the
craziest person in the world make the film entertaining.</P>
<P>     As far as acting goes, its as solid as you'd expect from such a
powerful cast.  When it comes to directing, it's what you'd expect from
Woody Allen: conservative.  He takes his camera and will shoot an entire
scene with only one shot.</P>
<P>     The script is suprisingly postmodern: it contains wonderful bits of
Woody Allen self-reference.  For instance, the title Manhattan Murder
Mystery alludes to the film Manhattan, and you have the wonderfully
brilliant scene in which Diane Keaton decrys wearing a tie with a skirt: the
very look that became chic in 1977 with her role in Annie Hall.</P>
<P>     Do not expect interesting plot twists.  You will not get them.  Do not
expect high art, you won't get it either.  Instead, expect a film that will
delight and entertain anyone who hates, or happens to love, New York.  What
a hoot!</P>
