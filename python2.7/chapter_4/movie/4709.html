<PRE>                                 CITY HALL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Ken Lipper, who wrote the original screenplay, helps give the
film an air of authenticity.  Lipper used to be a deputy Mayor when
New York City's mayor was Ed Koch.   Lipper knows the ins and outs of
running a city such as New York and surely was of valuable help to
Director Harold Becker, along with the other screenwriters, Paul
Schrader, Nick Pillegi and Bo Goldman.   Given the air of truth
coupled with some very fine acting,  and real dialog, CITY HALL  is a
gripping winner.</P>
<P>     The City is well-run until, in a shootout between a drug-dealer
and a policeman, a young black child gets fatally shot.   Little by
little we learn that the confrontation  may not be all that appears on
the surface.   For one thing, the drug-dealer is a small timer but
related to the Mafia chief.   It is then further revealed that a
tangled web is somewhere involved in the killing.</P>
<P>     The black population is understandably angry.   This is hardly
the first innocent child to get killed in an exchange of police/gang
crossfire.    The buck stops at the desk of Mayor John Pappas (Al
Pacino).    How many more kids are going to be killed?  In the film's
finest, most moving scene, Mayor Pappas appears at the church where he
has been told to stay away.   And do not go near the coffin.   Despite
those warnings, Pappas shows up, and to a hostile black audience, he
delivers a fiery speech.  This is from the heart.  This is real.  And
the anger of the audience is turned around to where the Mayor is seen
as the one person who can and will change the way things have been
previously run.    It is a most moving speech and Pacino gives it all
he has got which is plenty.</P>
<P>     Assisting the mayor in every way is the very honest deputy, Kevin
Calhoun, (John Cusack).   Cusack, too, in his underplayed manner
greatly helps enhance the film. Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) is the
attorney for the dead child's family.   Danny Aiello is the chief
mafioso, Martin Landau is a judge, David Paymer is the city's
attorney.  With a cast like that, all at their best, it is no surprise
that the film is superb.   Do not miss this one.</P>
