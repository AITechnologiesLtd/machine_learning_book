<PRE>IN DREAMS by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: A-</PRE>
<P>Lately, many horror movies have been released.  They are all the same-
predictable and gory.  In Dreams is a very different horror movie that doesn't
rely on blood and gore to make it scary.  Annette Bening stars as Claire
Cooper, a wife and mother.  Her husband is Paul Cooper, played by Aidan Quinn. 
Her daughter, Rebecca, played by Katie Sagona is happy.  The three of them live
in a big house, have a housekeeper, and are truly happy.  There is something
keeping Claire from happiness though.  Terrible things, things that she can't
explain.  All her life, she has had dreams of children dying.  She has a
psychological link to a serial killer.  No one believes her, but she knows she
isn't psychotic.</P>
<P>Rebecca stars as the mirror in her school play of Snow White.  She has been
rehearsing her one line over and over again.  Earlier on in the day, Claire had
visions of a little girl being led through an apple orchard by a man.  She
suspects this is the child that has been missing for some days now.  When she
finds out that the remains of the girl were found far from an apple orchard,
she is extremely confused.  Rebecca gets the line perfect in the play, and her
mother and father are very proud.  After the play, all of the kids involved
socialize for a while.  When Claire comes to pick up Rebecca, Rebecca is not
there.  The police are out searching everywhere, but she is nowhere to be
found.  The next day, the remains of Rebecca Cooper are found.  Claire is now
starting to wonder if she is seeing the future of what this brutal killer is
going to do.</P>
<P>She has more visions of what this man is going to do, and tries to inform the
police and her husband about what is going to happen next, but no one believes
her.  She is admitted to a mental home now.  Her psychiatrist doesn't even
believe what she is saying.  The thing is, Claire isn't crazy.  She knows what
she is talking about.  She finds out in her room that the man's name is Vivian
Thompson.  A creepy phrase is written all over the walls- MY DADDY WAS A
DOLLAR.  It continues on and on.  I have chills just thinking of this
terrifying scene.  She tries her best to find Vivian now and see what it is
that he wants.  She escapes from the mental home to track down Vivian.  When
she finally finds Vivian it is not a pretty sight.  One of the creepiest scenes
in any movie I have ever seen follows when she meets Vivian for the first time.
 An ending scene keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  What
happens?  I am afraid you will have to see In Dreams for yourself to find out. </P>
<P>In Dreams is the scariest, creepiest, eeriest film in a long, long time.  It is
almost impossible to tell what is going to happen in her dreams, and what is
going to happen in real life.  Everything is explained extremely well, and it
was easy to understand what was going on.  There is hardly any blood and gore
in In Dreams, and this just proves you don't need the blood and gore to make a
good scary movie.  Teen audiences will trash this film because of the cast and
the fact that it isn't a trashy slasher movie.  Every scene is packed with
action, the film never slows down.  It keeps your attention extremely well. 
The film was very disturbing as well.  Some of the images and sounds will stick
with me throughout the movie year of 1999.</P>
<P>Annette Bening delivers a wonderful performance as she makes you believe the
pain that Claire is going through.  At times, she overacted a little bit, but
that doesn't take away from her outstanding performance.  Aidan Quinn gives a
great follow up to his role in October's Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock
and Nicole Kidman.  He should get many more roles as the year goes on.  Robert
Downey Jr. is very mysterious and creepy.  He makes the role of Vivian Thompson
interesting, but at the same time extremely scary.  In Dreams is up there with
Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  It may be a different type of
film, but it is just as scary as Scream.  </P>
<P>The Bottom Line- In Dreams will be in my dreams for a while.</P>
