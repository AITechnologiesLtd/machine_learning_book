<PRE>The Parent Trap (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>It's been too long since I've seen the original 1961 THE PARENT TRAP to 
make comparisons.  Let it be enough to say that I watched the remake 
with four boys, ages 11-13, and not one of them griped that it was corny 
or a "chick flick."</P>
<P>First-time director Nancy Meyers summons first-rate performances from 
most of the cast.  Lindsay Lohan stands out in the role of twins Hallie 
Parker, the Napa Valley native who loves her single father, and Annie 
James, the skillfully accented Londoner who meets her sister at summer 
camp.  It must have taken planning and patience to keep the girls' 
manners straight and separate - not to mention to shoot around a 
stand-in;  the result is seamless and uncanny.  There's even a scene in 
which the girls play poker, one of them - we think the stand-in - 
holding her face away from the camera.  But suddenly she turns and we 
see Lohan again.  In fact there are very few scenes, in which the girls 
appear together, that have not been carefully executed.  As an actress, 
Lohan is poised and confident, and her red hair and freckles make 
viewers forget Hayley Mills.</P>
<P>Much of the lightness of tone - and it is a welcome lightness - comes 
from Simon Kunz's portrayal of Annie's butler.  At once a father figure 
and fun-loving pal, the loyal Martin gets many of the laughs in the 
picture.  And he comes by them honestly;  it does not even seem cheap 
when he dresses in leather or in nothing but a Speedo.  Martin is not 
afraid to cry, and meets a sympathetic counterpart in Chessy (Lisa Ann 
Walter), employee of Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and nanny to Hallie.  A 
budding romance between the servants actually adds charm to the film, 
though the idea of it sounds sappy and cliched.  As the twins' father, 
Quaid turns in a solid but not an outstanding job.  Natasha Richardson 
is a bit more flamboyant, especially in scenes that have her 
straight-laced Elizabeth swallowing too much airline booze.  No, along 
with the dual main role, it is the supporting roles of the servants, 
along with a little help from Elaine Hendrix as gold-digging Meredith, 
that propels the story into an above-average film.</P>
<P>Pace is very important in this film, especially since Meyers and 
co-writer Charles Shyer avoid fart jokes and crotch kicks.  The 
slapstick humor at camp comes across well, and the very premise of the 
girls switching roles so that their parents would be forced to see each 
other lends unity of plot.  Once again the acting makes for some 
touching reunions, with each 11 year-old never having seen one parent.  
I think what moves the story along so quickly is the editing.  The 
scenes are only as long as they need to be, no fillers stretching them 
out.  For instance, Annie and Hallie offer each other extensive 
coaching:  each must duplicate the other's knowledge and lifestyle.  
These scenes are properly summarized.  </P>
<P>On the whole, THE PARENT TRAP appeals to such a wide audience - 
including adolescent boys - because it tells a story of human triumph.  
It is also intelligent and innocent,  a double threat to most movies 
that ooze or explode out of the huge conglomerates that happen to own 
studios.</P>
