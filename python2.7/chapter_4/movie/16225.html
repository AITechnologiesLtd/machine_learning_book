 Director:  Mark Herman
 Writer:  Mark Herman, play "The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice" by Jim Cartwright
 Cast: Brenda Blethyn, Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, Jim
Broadbent, Ewan McGregor, Annette Badland, Philip Jackson</P>
<P>   Here is yet another example of a play which has not been
successfully transported to the screen.  In this case, though,
the drama itself--which unaccountably had a run on
Broadway--is so minor that one questions why the adaptation
was attmepted at all.  It features a shy, agoraphobic young
woman who rarely leaves her neat but downscale home in a
small English town, who has a fine voice but can do little
more than imitate some of the greats she listens to from her
record collection.  Brenda Blethyn, who is cast as the girl's
mother and who turned in an Oscar-nomination performance
in the multi-textured, award-winning film "Secrets and Lies," is
a motormouth whose personality this time is so
irritating that it's a wonder that half the audience does not
walk out in disgust and embarrassment.  It's even more
amazing that Mark Herman, who directs the insignificant
fiasco, expects anyone to believe that even a failed talent
agent is willing to be seen in his pimpmobile, much less to
apply his lips to hers.  While Laura, the Little Voice of the title
(so named because when she is not singing you can scarcely
hear a sound from her mouth), is not unattractive, we wonder
why a telephone repairman named Bill has romantic feelings
toward her--unless this pigeon-fancier imagines himself to be
a Mother Theresa getting his kicks from nursing a sick bird
like the eponymous L.V.</P>
<P>   The chief disaster of the movie is Mari Hoff (Brenda
Blethyn), a widow who looks like hell and who has a mouth
that should repel anyone with a pulse and two legs to get
himself out of her way.  While she cares only about
booze and bonking, her daughter Laura (Jane Horrocks, of
TV fame), spends all her time in the attic listening to her late
father's record favorites--the songs of Billie Holiday, Shirley
Bassey, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland).  When a night
club owner known as Boo (Jim Broadbent) hears her sing, he
agrees to sign her into his two-bit club, while Little Voice's
new agent, Ray Say (Michael Caine) sees her as the
discovery that will re-launch his failed career.</P>
<P>   The movie features one scene designed as a show-
stopper.  Laura, seeing her father's ghost in the audience of
the night club, belts out valid imitations of the great singers
who were her dad's favorites, only to fade away in a
succeeding act like a Virgil Adamson losing his regained sight
or Algernon's adult friend Charly's losing his gray matter. 
While some critics have interpreted Michael Caine's role as
that of a man who is exploiting the young chanteuse, he is guilty 
only of bringing the wallflower out into the open as
though she were one of telephone repairman Bill's birds flying
out for exercise.  James Berardinelli, a noted internet critic,
concluded his review by saying that the movie offers
"opportunities to laugh, cry and cheer."  Yes, it's a movie to
laugh at, to cry that you're not elsewhere, and to cheer the
conclusion which comes at a mercifully reasonable time.</P>
