<PRE>                                THE PACKAGE
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        As I watched THE PACKAGE slowly unfold, I kept waiting for the
twist.  Well, now it's a week later, and I'm still waiting.  THE PACKAGE
never delivered the goods.</P>
<P>        The movie involves a conspiracy to sabotage Soviet-American peace
talks aimed at ending the arms race.  Gene Hackman stars as Sergeant
Gallagher, an everyday Joe who unwittingly becomes a pawn in the elaborate
scheme.  He gets caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse in which he
must always stay one step ahead of the villains in order to foil the
conspiracy and clear his name.</P>
<P>        For a film that contains so many layers of deception and intrigue,
THE PACKAGE sure is boring, not to mention convoluted and confusing.  The
problem with this yawner is that it has no fun at all with its premise.
The movie could have had the decency to offer us some character psychology
or stylish direction, anything to compensate for its stale story line.</P>
<P>        The characters in THE PACKAGE play second fiddle to the plot, which
is backwards; plot should always serve character.  Hackman excels at
playing all kinds of roles, but he is usually at his best playing simple,
down-to-earth types.  The role of Sergeant Gallagher should have been right
up Hackman's alley, but the screenplay gives him little, if any, freedom to
embellish the character with subtle nuances.  The role forces him to merely
go through the motions.  Hackman is just too talented to be wasting his
time on such a non-character.  The cast also includes Joanna Cassidy and
Dennis Franz as Gallagher's allies and Tommy Lee Jones and the always
contemptible John Heard as his enemies.  The only stand-out is Jones, who
plays a wickedly devious assassin.</P>
<P>        In all fairness, THE PACKAGE isn't quite as bleak as I've made it
out to be.  The movie is a thriller, and it does have its thrills.  The
well-crafted middle section is extremely taut and tense; you can feel
danger in the air.  You even feel a little fearful for the characters.  But
by the end, the plot has careened so far out of control, that a "who cares?
... let's get this over with!" attitude prevails.  The movie's ludicrous,
overblown climax is the final straw: as Hackman urgently races against time
to save the day, he comes across nearly every car chase cliche in the book.
He gets delayed not only by a crossing train, but also by an
eighteen-wheeler and a rising draw bridge.  Personally, I'd rather see THE
MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE again.</P>
