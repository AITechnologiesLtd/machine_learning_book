<P>     Skip it.  The computer-generated FX are cute, but the story is all
over the place. The simple, sweet premise of a very lonely ghost has
been expanded to include a variety of vulgar subplots, ranging from
hidden treasure to a kitchen-sink explanation of the afterlife.
Groan.  The result is too broad to be believable.</P>
<P>     If the jokes were stronger (say, a la THE FLINTSTONES), we might
have something here.  But with the exception of a few good lines, there
isn't enough to sustain adult interest. Even a half-dozen well-placed
cameos don't generate the guffaws that they should.  Kids won't mind,
though.  They'll love the eye-popping production design that looks
quite ookey on the inside (and quite phony on the outside).</P>
<P>     We all could do without the wish-fulfillment ending.  The final
reel is the worst, with enough ghosts, angels, and misplaced spirits to
send even the lowest-level paranormal screaming from the theater.  And,
yes, that *is* Little Richard singing "Casper the Friendly Ghost" over
the closing credits. Good golly!</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  Strictly for kids, even if the language isn't the best in
places.</P>
