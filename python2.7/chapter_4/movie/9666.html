<PRE>DEMOLITION MAN (1993)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Marco Brambilla
Writers: Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau, and Peter M. Lenkow
Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock, Nigel
Hawthorne, Denis Leary, Bob Gunton, Benjamin Bratt, Glenn Shadix, Andre
Gregory, Rob Schneider, Dan Cortese</P>
<P>Being a fan of anything dystopian, and not being a fan of much
Stallonian kind of brings me to a big conflict in this film.  We get a
negative view of a futuristic utopian society, which is perfect except
that they aren't able to fight off anything bad, and they listen to
jingles from the 50s as music.  And then we get Stallone - all buff, and
all bad-ass, being tossed into utopia, just to give it a nice twist. 
This flick wants to be like a new wave version of "1984" and/or "Brave
New World," but kind of fails because of its new little clever twist.</P>
<P>The "Demolition Man" of the title is none other than Sly, a renegade cop
named John Spartan in the bad-ass world of L.A. 1997 (the designated
year for all apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers of the early 90s), who has an
obsession with catching uber-psycho criminal Simon Pheonix (the
Rodman-looking Wesley Snipes).  One night, he dives into a large
warehouse of his to catch him, but ends up prompting Phoenix to ignite
the entire warehouse, killing a bunch of innocent kidnapped people.  He,
and Phoenix, are sentenced to the new wave form of capitol punishment:
frozen and rehabilitated through computers.  So John strips down, we see
some stuff we don't want to see, and he's cryogenically (spelling?)
frozen.</P>
<P>Skip a couple decades, and the world of L.A. is now renamed, and has
been transformed into a utopian wonderworld, all run by the high
priest/fascist/big brother Cocteau (awesome brit actor Nigel Hawthorne),
who is aiming for a perfect society.  His only problem is a little
underground pest named Edgar Friendly (the typecasted Denis Leary), who
is trying to rebel against utopianism, and bring back the good old days
of high fat, nicotine, and open pornography.  So, being the smart guy he
is, he unfreezes Phoenix, and tries to get him to do away with Edgar. 
As I said, he's a smart guy.</P>
<P>After a bit of rampaging around town, the cops, lead by the stuck-up Bob
Gunton, decide to unfreeze Spartan, and have him go after Phoenix. 
Teaming up with the highly energized Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock,
before that whole "Speed" stuff), he goes after Phoenix, learns about
how stupid and inane the society is, and just gets to kick some villian
buttocks.</P>
<P>Now, let me say, the view of Utopia is nice and all, but it's not nearly
negative enough.  I chuckled at the idea of the jingles populating
"oldie" radio, as well as the whole non-touching policy, and the
no-swearing deal (which is broken not too long after Spartan and/or
Phoenix are unfrozen).  The bit about the "three seashells" deal was
classic, as well as the whole sex bit (which prompts a classic scene
where a giddy Bullock asks Sly if he wants to have sex with her).  Oh,
and the whole Lenina Huxley name was a nice little idea (Huxley being
the last name of Aldous, who wrote the great dystopian novel "Brave New
World," and Lenina being the name of one of the chief characters in it).</P>
<P>But.  There's nothing really negative to say about this Utopia, other
than that the only big restaurant franchise is Taco Bell (not a bad
thing, really).  The people who populate it seem to be happy, with a
couple exceptions.  I know I'd hate it, but all the film offers up is
how Lenina wants "some action," not sure in which context.  The
paralleism it wants to make with that of the Leary underground living
never quite works out, since it glorifies it by having Sly bask in it
all ("Oh! I'm eating a ratburger?  Not bad." - this is not a quote, but
something along the lines of what he says while down there).  Thus the
little trite solution at the end - "You guys get a little dirtier, and
you guys get a little cleaner, and somewhere in the middle is your
solution" - never really lifts the film off the ground.</P>
<P>In fact, the whole bit about the war between Phoenix and Sly is never
really that great.  Sure, the action scenes are fun to watch, and both
of them contribute a lot to the humor and overall fun of it all, but
they never mean anything.  If this is a dystopian satire, why does the
film just shoot it's way to its conclusion?  Then there's the bit about
how they obtain weaponry: just going to the museum, where there's a
plethora of guns, ammo, explosions, etc.  Why not just have them duke it
out weapon-less?  This could have led to an original film overall,
instead of this cheap little bit about them just fighting like in all
big budget action pics.</P>
<P>On a plus side, this film is marginally fun to watch.  The performances
of Sly and Snipes are funny, and they have some good chemistry
together.  Some.  Snipes does overpower Sly in that he has the cool-ass
villain role, and he takes it to its farthest limits, making him
likable.  And Sly actually does a good job with the comedy this time. 
Bullock, although garnering a Razzie nomination for this, has a lot of
energy in a role that requires her to be giddy a lot of the time.  Leary
gets to do a rant, so he's good and all that stuff.  And Nigel Hawthorne
rocks, standing out by giving undoubtedly the best performance in the
flick.  Then again, this guy's done Shakespeare, a feat that no one in
this film probably has done...well, maybe Rob Schneider or Dan
Cortese...</P>
<P>"Demoliton Man" isn't a bad flick.  In fact, it's rather pretty fun to
watch.  But it has failed idealism as a work of action dystopia - a
formula that COULD work if in the hands of someone else.  But Marco
Brambilla, who would go on to direct that Alicia crap-sterpiece "Excess
Baggage," just tries to please everyone, and thus fails.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
