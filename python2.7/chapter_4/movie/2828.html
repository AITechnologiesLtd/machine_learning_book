<P>     A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE is Steve Martin's re-telling of George
Eliot's SILAS MARNER.  This is not the first time Martin has
coordinated a cinematic adaptation of a classic--his ROXANNE applied
a modern twist to Edmond Rostand's CYRANO DE BERGERAC.  However,
whereas ROXANNE's appeal came through its affable mix of humor and
light drama, A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE's uneven tone and poorly-crafted
last act make it a far less successful effort.  It's on the occasions
when A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE strays some distance from SILAS MARNER that
the film flounders most noticeably.</P>
<P>     The story opens in 1979.  Michael McCann (Martin) is in a state of
nervous anticipation.  His wife is pregnant and he's delighted--until
she tells him that he's not the father.  Four years later, Michael is
living alone in a ramshackle house with painted-over windows.  Since
his divorce, he has become a sullen recluse who cares only about his
ever- growing collection of gold coins.  Gold, someone once told him,
will never let you down.  Not like human beings.  Then, one night while
he lies in a drunken stupor, a thief (Stephen Baldwin) breaks in and
steals everything.</P>
<P>     Not long after that, on a cold winter's evening, a child
mysteriously appears in McCann's house, having wandered in out of the
snow.  Outside, her mother (Amelia Campbell) lies dead of a heroin
overdose.  McCann is unexpectedly touched by the little girl, and
decides that fate has brought her to him to replace his lost coins.  In
a move that surprises everyone, he decides to adopt her.  With the aid
of local politician John Newland (Gabriel Byrne)--who happens to be
the child's natural father but won't acknowledge her for fear of
damaging his career--he is given custody of his daughter, whom he
names Mathilda (played by a number of child actors, most notably Alana
Austin).</P>
<P>     Over the next decade, there is no more devoted a father than
Michael McCann.  Newland, however, is beginning to have second
thoughts, especially since his wife Nancy (Laura Linney) can't have
children.  He makes it a point to get to know Mathilda, courting her
favor by buying her expensive gifts.  Eventually, when he feels the
situation is ripe, he sues for custody.</P>
<P>     The movie's limited strength lies in the bonding between 10-year
old Mathilda and her father.  There's a sense of genuine emotion in
this relationship.  Some of the scenes between the two display a
lightheartedness that almost lifts A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE from the
miasma that had settled around it during the overly-long introduction.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Martin's script calls for more than the simple
telling of how a man's love for a child changes his personality.
Hence, we're subjected to court scenes featuring the attempts of the
(nasty) Mr.  Newland to take away the beloved daughter of the (nice)
Mr. McCann.  The premise is preposterous and the execution inept.</P>
<P>     Like fellow comedian-turned-actor Robin Williams, Steve Martin has
the ability to give a competent dramatic performance, especially when
the role allows for a little comic relief.  The problem with A SIMPLE
TWIST OF FATE is that the comedy is not well-blended with the drama.
With a tone that wobbles like an unsteady top, this film leaves its
lead actor floundering for a point of equilibrium.</P>
<P>     Alana Austin's greatest asset is her charm.  Her acting skills are
certainly not well-honed, but her smile can file off a few rough
edges.  Thankfully, she's also not insufferably cute.</P>
<P>     A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE is riddled with problems (the film's Labor
Day weekend release indicates how uncertain Touchstone is about its
appeal).  It doesn't seem that anyone had a clear idea of what they
wanted the film to be--a frothy dramatic comedy or a maudlin
melodrama.  Working from solid source material, it's amazing how
disjointed the result is.  SILAS MARNER is worthy of an update--just
not this one.</P>
