<P>   Just as the "in" thing to say is "the book is better than the
movie," the appropriate way to describe a movie that has
come out of a staged play is that they should have left it off-
Broadway where it belongs.  August Strindberg's "Miss Julie,"
David Mamet's "Oleanna," Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey"--all have
been compromised or downright ruined by being "opened up"
on the big screen.  Not only do filmed plays look either
claustrophobic or artificially extended when put on the huge
silver screen: the language, which is usually the key attribute
of a staged work, gets lost.  Sam Shepard's play,
"Simpatico," is a good example of a work whose language
simply disperses into the alfalfa-perfumed air of Kentucky
where many of its scenes take place.</P>
<P>  Directed with a star-studded cast by Matthew Warchus--who
has done impressive work on Broadway with his Tony-
nominated hit "Art" and is known for solid work on London's
West End ("Falstaff," "Hamlet,")--Warchus is out of his
element with this rambling movie, whose rhythms and poetry
are squandered amid a convoluted tale.  Dealing with some
of Sam Shepard's favorite themes--the interior and exterior
landscapes of American society, the death or betrayal of the
American dream, the search for comfortable roots--
"Simpatico" takes a good deal of time to find its cadence,
leading the audience to wonder when some sense will be
made of its characters' feelings of alienation.  Flashing back
frequently to the more carefree, optimistic days of his
protagonists, Warchus unveils a story of youthful ideals and
limitless dreams, puncturing the illusions of two uninteresting
men and one bimbo-ish woman who pulled a scam that didn't
quite work out and who are haunted not only by memories
but by their current ties to the past.</P>
<P>   The movie opens on a shaggy Vinnie (Nick Nolte) who has
been leading a low-profile life in Cucamonga, California,
having been involved in a shady deal with his friend, Carter
(Jeff Bridges)--who is now a multimillionaire horse breeder in
Kentucky.  In a more carefree time they had been involved in
a racing scam involving the switching of slow, long-shot
horses by fast ones, and in blackmailing the racing
commissioner, Simms (Albert Finney), into silence.  But there
is no honor among these thieves.  Carter runs off with
Vinnie's wife Rosie (Sharon Stone), Simms takes on a new
identity with a new, satisfying career, and Carter is himself
blackmailed by Vinnie.  When Vinnie decides to come clean
and go public with evidence, Carter is drawn into an intricate
plot involving a naive supermarket checker, Cecilia (Catherine
Keener), who acts as liaison between Vinnie and Simms.</P>
<P>   Kimberly Williams, Liam Waite and Shawn Hatosy perform
in the roles of the young Rosie, Carter and Vinnie
respectively while Sharon Stone is wasted in a thankless role
of the unhappy, if fabulously rich, wife of Carter, lounging
about her estate like a torpid character out of Tennessee
Williams.  The most energetic performance comes from
Albert Finney, who has made lemonade from lemons by
performing in the role of a man who is now intensely involved
in a career tracing the bloodlines of horses.  Despite decent
performances from Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges, who switch
roles before our eyes--the one lightening up graphically as he
shucks the albatross of his past criminal acts while the other
deteriorates into a paranoid scuzz--"Simpatico" barely leaves
the starting gate before it falters and bogs down like a
Central Park buggy horse pitted against Native Dancer.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000
