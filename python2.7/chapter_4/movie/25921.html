<P>     How whimsical and amusing does a film need to be before it ceases to
matter that it lacks a center -- not just that its center is slight, but
that it has no center whatsoever? Such a question plagued me at the end of
SAVING GRACE, a comedy with that uniquely British quirky appeal. It was a
pleasant enough experience for most of its running time, but what in the
world was the point? There are certain kinds of comedies that can get away
with a complete lack of an identifiably human character arc. This doesn't
seem like it should be one of them. How does one reconcile 90 minutes of
grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways
terribly sloppy?</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best course of action is simply to roll with it. It's
fairly easy to roll along with the story of Grace Trevethyn (Brenda
Blethyn), a recent widow and amateur horticulturist whose husband
apparently committed suicide. A possible reason for his action soon
becomes apparent to Grace: He has left a mountain of debt from failed
business ventures, and nothing but the Trevethyn's Cornish seaside manor
to pay it off. Faced with homelessness, Grace turns to risky fund-raising
venture. After using her greenhouse to revive the failing marijuana plants
of her groundskeeper Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote the 
script), Grace figures she can erase the debt by turning her home into a
hemp plantation. Grace and Matthew team up, trying to keep a low profile
in a small town before facing the even more daunting challenge of finding
a dealer to buy their crop.</P>
<P>     From the outset, SAVING GRACE seems to have nearly every element in
place for a wonderfully entertaining piece of middle-brow humor. Blethyn
anchors the film with a performance that's more restrained than recent
outings like LITTLE VOICE, effectively playing incongruous moments like
her attempts to sell her product on the streets of London while dressed
like the Queen Mum. There are well-crafted supporting characters like the
town's pot-head doctor (Martin Clunes) and edgy conspiracy theorist Harvey
(Tristan Sturrock), and a strong sense of place from the wild Cornish 
coast. Perhaps most refreshing, there's an unapologetic quality to the
film's just-say-yes story line. This is not the place to look for a strong
message condemning Grace's illegal activities; it's more the place to look
for scenes of elderly ladies making tea from some special leaves they find
in Grace's greenhouse.</P>
<P>     It's all quite a bit of silly fun for those with no moral objections,
until SAVING GRACE winds to its conclusion and it becomes evident that
there's something missing -- namely, a third act. It could have been about
Grace coming to terms with her late husband's secret life -- including an
affair with a chic Londoner (Diana Quick) -- or about a sheltered woman
forced to confront the real world. It could even have been about Matthew's
quest for responsibility under pressure from his girlfriend (Valerie 
Edmond), with Grace serving more as a colorful supporting character
herself than as the protagonist. But SAVING GRACE doesn't bother with
developing its characters. Grace doesn't appear to grow or learn much of
anything, and Matthew's change of heart is tacked on almost as an
afterthought. There's no sense of consequence anchoring anything that goes
on in SAVING GRACE, like the unemployed FULL MONTY crew's search for a
renewed sense of their manhood. It all begins to seem like little more
than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits.</P>
<P>     That hole in the third act is filled by an odd visit to a roguish
French drug dealer (Tcheky Karyo), and by a postscript twist that comes
out of absolutely nowhere. It would feel like a complete violation of
Grace's character, if not for the fact that Grace's character isn't
developed carefully enough for there to be that much violation. Such
carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like SAVING
GRACE, but somehow it doesn't quite. Too many of the quirks work, and too
many of the giggle fits inspire similar reactions from the audience. It's
no masterwork of comic craftsmanship, but it does the job of taking you
somewhere goofy and free of responsibility even though you know it's not
particularly good for you. And maybe that's a fitting quality for a film
about unapologetic pot smokers. Ninety minutes of grins sounds about
right.</P>
