<PRE>THE PLAYER'S CLUB
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Oh boy!  Another foray into the world of strippers!  Are there any
stories here that haven't been told?  Are there interesting ways to
present tired material? Well, if there are, you wouldn't know it from
The Player's Club.</P>
<P>Diana Armstrong (LisaRaye) is an unwed mother and college student
struggling to barely get by.  One day, while on her job at a local shoe
store, she meets two strippers, Ronnie and Tricks (Chrystale Wilson and
Adele Givens), who advise her to join them in a new career at The
Player's Club.</P>
<P>The Player's Club is a gentleman's club (aka strip bar) owned by the
supposedly colorful Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac).  Dollar is heavily in
debt, but hires Diana on the spot, hoping a new young body will bring in
more dough.</P>
<P>Diana puts her dignity aside, and prospers in the job, seeing it as
merely a temporary money-making venture while she completes her
education.  However, trouble ensues when her young cousin, Ebony (Monica
Calhoun), idolizing Diana's lifestyle, decides to work at the club as
well, and go farther than she wisely should.</P>
<P>The plight of the stripper is hardly anything new, having recently been
covered by several bad movies (Showgirls, and Striptease).  And while
The Player's Club tries to put an ethnic spin on the story, the result
is not much better.</P>
<P>Ice Cube makes his directoral debut with this movie, and, of course,
gives himself a bit part as a lowlife who frequents the club.  His
direction is serviceable, but uninspired.  He fares much worse as the
film's screenwriter, surviving barely on the merits that his dialogue
never plummets to the depths of Showgirls.</P>
<P>There are a couple of stories here that could have been interesting, but
instead are relegated to pointless subplots.  Diana's relationship with
an inspirational college professor, and the conflict of her protective
father and her boyfriend (and club DJ) Blue (Jamie Foxx) are both
stories that had much more potential than the mundane fare that fills
the rest of the movie.</P>
<P>LisaRaye does the best she can with the "stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold"
role. But, like virtually every other character here, she's void of
personality, and is merely a loose collection of stereotypes.</P>
<P>The Player's Club is an inauspicious directing debut for Ice Cube.
Hopefully his future efforts will be better than this unimaginative
outing... it won't be hard.</P>
