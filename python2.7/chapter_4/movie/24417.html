<P>IN SHORT: I dream of a comfortable seat to snooze in.</P>
<P>Africa is a lovely continent and, when properly photographed,
breathtaking in its beauty. Set an incredibly strong story against such
a background (usually a foreigner against the Land and so forth) and the
effect is magnified. When the story fails to connect, to stir the
emotions in the audience, you have the equivalent of a travel brochure.
Such is the case with director Hugh Hudson's I Dream of Africa, which
hits your local movie screen with a sickening plop.</P>
<P>You can't put all the blame on Kim Basinger's one-dimensional portrayal
of Kuki Gullman an Italy-based American widow who takes on a new
marriage and a new life facing the extremely-alien, to her, African
continent. Settling in [Kenya] with new husband Paolo (Vincent Perez)
and kidlet son Emanuele (Liam Aiken). It's the job of the director to
get the best and fullest performance that he can out of his cast,
something the Oscar-winning Basinger is more than capable of. What makes
it to the screen indicates to me, at least, that Hudson seems more
concerned with avoiding controversial topics than with telling a
compelling story. When, early in the flick, Paolo disappears for days at
a time on a hunting expedition Kuki is p.o.'d because she hasn't learned
Swahili yet and has no concept how to run an African estate. Ducking the
question of European domination of African cultures -- heck unless I
missed a title card I'm not even sure what the proper timeframe for this
flick is, which is politically important to the background story-- we're
left with a standard stranger in a strange land story with performances
so bland that there is nothing that resembles a standard emotional story
arc. Lovely scenery, though.</P>
<P>We also found we got suckered by the accents and poor background
development in the first act (Italy). West Coast correspondent Paul
Fischer corrects us:</P>
<P><blockquote>Sometimes a film emerges that should be something special,
that the original source material can only make for a solid drama.
Alas,   that's not the case with I Dreamed of Africa, a movie that
puts   new meaning into the word 'tedium'. But apart from the film's
sluggish   pace, the movie's additional faults lay with the film's
problematic   performances, a problem that exists as the film deals with
character   arcs. Let's begin with the obvious. This is a movie about an
Italian   family in Africa. True story. So the producers decide to cast
a Frenchman   and an American, and of course ensure that they each speak
in their   natural tongues. Beyond that, Basinger, as hauntingly lovely
she is   on screen, is simply incapable of neither carrying a film, nor
evoking   any real emotions. Try as she might, and she does deliver one
or two   nice moments, Basinger lacks the emotive range to make us
believe in   her character's journey. Without that belief, the film
can't work, so   suffers from the outset. Perez is even worse, giving a
superficial performance,   and there is no chemistry between the two
actors. He is devilishly attractive,   but one has the impression that
he doesn't really grasp his character's   dichotomy. </blockquote></P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to I Dreamed of Africa, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$0.00</PRE>
<P>An utter waste of time and, in both our judgments, the worst drama we've
seen this year.</P>
