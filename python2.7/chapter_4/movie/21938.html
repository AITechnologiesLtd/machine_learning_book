<PRE>SLEEPY HOLLOW</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael
Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Lee
DIRECTOR:  Tim Burton
WRITTEN BY:  Kevin Yagher, Andrew Kevin Walker (based on "The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving)</P>
<P>By now, after Beetlejuice, two Batman movies, and Edward Scissorhands
(also starring Depp), one might conclude that the sky in
weirdo/wunderkind Tim Burton's world is decidedly black.  Yet, his bleak
Gothic imagery has always been tempered by a childlike wonder (perhaps
best realized in the truly marvelous musical fantasy The Nightmare
Before Christmas, which he produced and co-wrote.)  Underlined with
strange and sublime music from constant collaborator Danny Elfman,
Burton's films have a unique, fairy-tale-like quality that has often
endeared him to both critics and audiences in a rare synergy of art and
commerce (although not always; 1996's Mars Attacks! was just plain
dreadful, while 1994's critical favorite Ed Wood was box-office
anathema.)  These same artistic and commercial elements appear in Sleepy
Hollow, but blend less smoothly thanks to writing flaws that complicate
what should have been a simple and straightforward tale.</P>
<P>The film's plot bears only a passing resemblance to Irving's short
story.  Ichabod Crane is now a constable and forensic scientist instead
of a schoolmaster.  This allows the writers to cook up an unnecessarily
convoluted murder mystery involving conspiracy and witchcraft, a
whodunit that in its resolution makes even the origin of the Headless
Horseman seem completely plausible in comparison.  Thrown in for good
measure is some uncalled-for subtext involving Ichabod's Puritan
childhood.  In fact, Sleepy Hollow is even less faithful to its source
than the short but memorable Disney cartoon (the last half of 1949's
Ichabod and Mr. Toad) that is, to my mind, still the best-- and
scariest-- film version of 'em all (so memorable, in fact, that Burton
includes several bits of hommage to it, like the toads that croak
Ichabod's name as he nervously guides his old horse across a covered
bridge at night.)</P>
<P>This is not to say that the film is a waste of time.  On the contrary,
it's worth ponying up the bucks just to see the patented Burton visuals
(accomplished this time by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) married to
Elfman's magical music.  Pastoral vistas of upstate New York are as
beautifully rendered as oil paintings, but the real treats are the
gloomy little township of Sleepy Hollow and the gnarled, leaf-strewn
forest surrounding it.  They're like an Edward Gorey drawing come to
ominous life.  Even the few daylight sequences have a dreamlike,
dark-at-the-fringes feel, and the characters all share an
unhealthy-looking pallor that suits the grim (and often gruesome)
proceedings.  Depp's Ichabod Crane, with his constantly pursed lips and
stiff, vaguely effeminate demeanor, matches Irving's conception in
character if not appearance (in this respect, the Disney version is
bang-on.)  Ricci, on the other hand, matches Irving's physical
description of Katrina Van Tassel letter for letter, but is neither
coquettish nor fickle enough to be considered anything but a
goody-goody.  Thanks to the demands of a script that requires obligatory
plot twists and action scenes, we are expected to believe things about
both characters that simply don't add up.  Worse, the villain is made to
explain the whole messy mystery near the end, with the immediate and
unfortunate result that we are suddenly yanked out of Tim Burton's
darkly imaginative world and left sitting in a theater, watching
something no more real than a Headless Horseman.</P>
