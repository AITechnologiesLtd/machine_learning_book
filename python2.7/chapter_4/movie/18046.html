<P>Taking its quaint title from Irish slang for a good time, The
Craic delivers just that.  This enjoyable enough film is likely to be
the most popular home grown comedy to hit our screens since The
Castle.  It has a similar likeable humour and unassuming style.
Popular Irish comedian Jimeoin makes his film debut with this
wonderfully entertaining but slightly off beat tale following the
adventures of two Irish larrikins on the run from the Australian
immigration authorities.  The success of the film depends largely upon
his own popularity.</P>
<P>Jimeoin plays Fergus, a fun loving Irishman who visits
Australia to escape retribution from Colin (Robert Morgan, also
currently appearing in Redball), a tough Irish thug whom he has
insulted.  His friend Wesley (Alan McKee) joins him for fun times down
under.  But when they outstay their visa, the immigration department
tracks them down.  On the run, the pair journey through many out of
the way places that the average tourist doesn't get to see.  These two
likely lads discover that we are indeed a weird mob.</P>
<P>Complicating matters is the arrival of Colin, who has been
"relocated" to a remote location in Australia, as part of a witness
protection scheme.  Eventually, their paths will cross with
unpredictable results.</P>
<P>The Craic combines warm Irish blarney with coarse Australian
humour to good effect.  Jimeoin turns an outsider's eye on our culture
and our idiosyncrasies, wringing many laughs out of some obvious
targets.  He takes a sledgehammer to the usual stereotypes, but he
also reveals a deep affection for the Australian way of life.
Unfortunately, The Craic seems episodic in nature, almost like a
collection of amusing anecdotes that Jimeoin has fashioned together.
Many of the incidents are actually drawn from Jimeoin's own
experiences living and working in Australia in the early '80's, which
gives the film a strong autobiographical bent.  Even his appearance on
the tacky game show The Meet Market is based on Jimeoin's appearance
on the popular '80's show Perfect Match.  Former host Greg Evans
contributes a droll cameo as himself.</P>
<P>Many of the peripheral characters are quite interesting, but
remain under developed.  McKee delivers a quite boisterous and
energetic performance, and he effortlessly steals most of his scenes.
Colin Hay, former lead singer of Men At Work, is good as the tough SAS
soldier assigned to protect Colin while hiding out down under.
Veteran Charles Tingwell contributes an amusing cameo as a foul
mouthed farmer.</P>
<P>Director Ted Emery cut his teeth on television shows like the
seminal Countdown and Fast Forward, and he brings pace and energy to
the material.  He keeps things moving along at a nice pace.  John
Wheeler's beautiful cinematography captures the wonderful locations in
all their glory.  The main complaint about The Craic is that it seems
to run out of energy and inspiration towards the end, and finishes on
a vaguely unsatisfying note.</P>
