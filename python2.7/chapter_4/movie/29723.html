<PRE>TRAINING DAY
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>How will the tragic events of September 11, 2001 influence violent
movies?  The box office results of Training Day should answer that
question.  Warner Bros. did postpone the film's release date for two
weeks, but is that enough time for audiences to be ready for such a
brutally violent movie?</P>
<P>I think so, although this is a time where audiences may seek romantic
comedies over disturbing, awakening dramas.  I screened two movies
today, this and the juvenile Max Keeble's Big Adventure.  The theater
was twice as full for Max than Training Day, which proves that people
want uplifting comedies right now.  If you're one of those people,
Training Day is definitely not for you.</P>
<P>Unquestionably convincing, disturbingly realistic, and unflinchingly
honest, Training Day details the events of one day in which a young,
rookie narcotics cop named Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) must show his stuff
to veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) in order to land
the job he wants.</P>
<P>Jake has a loving wife and a beautiful little baby, both safe and sound
at home.  By the time Jake returns to them that night, he will be a
different person.  He will see things he has never wanted to see, learn
things he does not want to know, and look evil straight in the eye. 
Although the myth states when you dance with the devil, you don't change
the devil, the devil changes you, this experience might actually make
Jake a stronger individual, or it might morally change his standards
forever.</P>
<P>Jake will never forget his training day, and this is a day I won't soon
forget, either.  The film explores a world uncompromisingly barbarous, a
world I never want to see again.  But it does exist in the vast majority
of cities.  Training Day reminds us of that, and sometimes the justice
department is no better than the villainous thugs it patrols.</P>
<P>The film, brilliantly directed by Antoine Fuqua, is fueled with
powerhouse performances.  Denzel Washington displays a side of himself
we have never seen before; I feel he has earned an Oscar nomination for
his sincere, vicious portrayal of a man who was not strong enough to
withstand his dance.  Ethan Hawke invites the audience to stand inside
his cringing shoes.  We're as startled as Jake because we experience the
day through his eyes.</P>
<P>It's a scary world out there.  Training Day shows us the brooding terror
that could exist just blocks away.  It's altogether one of the year's
most thought-provoking films.</P>
