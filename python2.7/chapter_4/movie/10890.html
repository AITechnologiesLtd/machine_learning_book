Jailhouse Rock (1957)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 74</PRE>
<P>"Jailhouse Rock" is Elvis Presley's best film.
He plays an ex-convict struggling to becoming a star
as a pop singer.  His business partner and would-be
girlfriend is Judy Tyler.  Presley's character 
achieves fame and fortune as a recording artist
and movie star, but has he surrendered his humanity
and values in a greedy and decadent lifestyle?</P>
<P>Elvis Presley had much in common with Frank Sinatra and
Bing Crosby.  They all were fabulously successful American
singers whose fame and charisma also extended to successful
film careers.  But while Sinatra and Crosby would eventually
win Academy Awards, Presley was not as fortunate.  Some of
his early films were passable, but as Hollywood moguls tried
to mine his popularity, the movies came quicker and the
scripts grew worse and worse.  By the time his studio contracts
had been fulfilled, his career had nearly been destroyed.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that most Presley films are terrible.
Because there was a soundtrack album to sell, the film had
to be laden with songs.  This meant that Presley had to portray
a singer, and the plot would have to be stripped.  He had to 
have someone to sing to, which meant one or more pretty girls.
Add fancy cars and a tropical locale, and what else would be
needed to bring the teenagers to the drive-in?</P>
<P>"Jailhouse Rock" was Presley's third film, made at the peak
of his career, and before the formula had taken over.
Yes, he plays a singer, but the Lieber-Stoller songs are
top-notch.  He also has a surly attitude, and the party
atmosphere of later films is missing.  Best of all, the script
is terrific, only occasional stumbling to underscore his
platonic romance with Judy Tyler or to moralize over his 
loss of values.</P>
