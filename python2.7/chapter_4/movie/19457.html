<PRE>                              THE HAUNTING
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Some houses should never be visited.  And some movies should never
be remade.  THE HAUNTING represents both of those tenets.</P>
<P>     A loose remake of the 1963 HAUNTING, this version gives us a creepy
haunted house and four hapless people to populate it.  Chief among them
is Eleanor (Taylor), a real wacko who believes there are children's
spirits in the house that speak to her.  And she's right!  Wow,
original!  And hey kids, the sexy Zeta-Jones plays a *bisexual* in the
movie!  Oooooh, scandalous!  (Sarcasm, people.)</P>
<P>     So how does Jan de Bont, made famous as director of SPEED but
best-known as the director of SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL, get to make a
horror film?  He was probably the only sucker in Hollywood desperate
enough to take a dog of a film like this.  The fact that he's never done
a horror flick just compounds the problems.</P>
<P>     As a result, THE HAUNTING is not scary -- at all.  Instead it's
just a conglomeration of cheap fright tactics and a booming bass track
meant to get you to jump out of your seat.  Which doesn't work.</P>
<P>     THE HAUNTING also features such a dumb story line and such bad
dialogue it's almost pathetic.  For a horror film to be frequently
*boring* is unforgivable.  And I wager that anyone who bothers to spend
money on this lemon won't be able to forgive themselves either.</P>
<P>     A really cool set (that ultimately serves no purpose) is the only
shining spot in the film.  Otherwise, feel free to skip this one.</P>
<PRE>     Sorry Jan: Strike two.</PRE>
