<PRE>THE BACHELOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"My mustang days were about to become a distant memory," the soon
to-be-ex-bachelor Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) laments.  "Goodbye
sweet grasses."  A bachelor suffering from mustang metaphor obsession,
Jimmie sees his life dating one girl after another as being like a wild
mustang who is free to sample all of the grasses on the open range.</P>
<P>In Gary Sinyor's THE BACHELOR, Jimmie reluctantly decides it's time to
leave "Bachelorsville" for the town of "Marriedsville," so he arranges,
along with dozens of other men in a similar situation, to pop the
question to his intended at one of the fanciest restaurants in town.</P>
<P>After rambling incoherently, Jimmie finishes his proposal of sorts with,
"The upshot is: You win!"  Not exactly overwhelmed, his disbelieving
girlfriend, Anne (Renée Zellweger), glares at him with an incredulous
look.  "That's it?" she asks.  "'You win!' is a proposal?"</P>
<P>The delightfully cute Zellweger represents everything that is right
about THE BACHELOR.  She acts adorable, and with her long, curly blonde
hair and rosy cheeks, she looks like the catch of the century.  The
filmmakers ask her to carry the entire burden of the romantic portion of
this romantic comedy, which is hard.  One person does not a romance
make.</P>
<P>In contrast, the incredibly bland O'Donnell shows what's wrong with the
movie.  Never credible as a romantic figure in the story, he is required
to setup the comedy parts.  "What you think?" one woman ridicules Jimmie
late in the picture.  "You think you some kind of comedian?"  And
therein lies the problem, he isn't.  The movie, which features too much
O'Donnell and not enough Zellweger, places its bet heavily on the
comedic side of the romantic comedy equation.  The result is a story
that definitely has its moments but overall just fizzles.</P>
<P>Most of the movie concerns Jimmie's frantic search for another bride.
Soon after he botches his proposal to Anne (he really sticks his foot in
his mouth in an unprintable line after the "you win" disaster), his
grandfather dies.  In his will he leaves $100,000,000 to Jimmie but only
under certain conditions -- the prime one being that he gets married the
next day.  In order to prove that it isn't just some sham marriage, he
must stay hitched for 10 years, never leave his wife for more than one
day a month and produce "genetically verifiable offspring" within 5
years.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Jimmie will mess up the proposals to his ex-girlfriends
almost as badly as he did with his one to Anne, whom he still loves.
Think you can guess the ending?</P>
<P>Steve Cohen's screenplay is based on Buster Keaton's silent classic
SEVEN CHANCES from 1925.  Besides a few quite humorous scenes, the
script for THE BACHELOR has one nice serious one.  James Cromwell, as a
grim reaper of a priest, who turns out to have a heart of gold, explains
to Jimmie his philosophy about marriage.  "It's a great thing when you
grow old to have someone look in your face and see what you think you
look like," the priest says in the movie's only truly insightful scene.</P>
<P>THE BACHELOR is hard to characterize.  If it's a comedy, then there just
aren't enough laughs.  If it's supposed to be a romance, then they
should have cast someone who could have created some genuine chemistry
with Zellweger.  A sporadically enjoyable movie, it leaves you wishing
Zellweger had been given a lot more screen time.  And that they had cast
a different male lead.</P>
<P>THE BACHELOR runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for language and would be
fine for kids about 9 and up.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, November 5.
In the San Jose area it will be playing at the AMC and Century theaters.</P>
