<PRE>Babe:  A Pig in the City (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>A Pig in the City picks up where Babe left off, with Arthur Hoggett 
(James Cromwell) quietly accepting a trophy for his champion sheepdog, 
er, pig.  He hugs his wife, turns down myriad offers for public 
appearances, and falls down a well, sustaining injuries that put him out 
of most of the movie.  </P>
<P>This is the first risk taken by the sequel, and it's one of many reasons 
why A Pig in the City is so successful.</P>
<P>The storybook qualities are still here: along with the Hoggetts' 
generously thatched cottage, we see a quirky hotel housing two humans 
and a menagerie of animals.  The landscapes are still beautiful and 
cozy, skies glowing like canvases by N. C. Wyeth.  Of course the animals 
talk. And the city of the title is "just to the left of the twentieth 
century," its landmarks icons from real cities -- the Seattle Space 
Needle, the "Hollywood" letters, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera 
House (the film was shot in Australia, after all).  Accordingly, the 
sets, costumes and lighting accentuate the magical effects.</P>
<P>What is so remarkable about this sequel is that it differs so much from 
Babe.  Yes, many of the same characters are here - indeed, I wanted more 
of the taciturn Hoggett, the sheepdogs Fly and Rex, and others - but 
this new zoo of a cast is just as charming, and even more uproarious in 
its adventures.  This film proves that strong sequels, and installments 
of series films, rely only briefly on their original incarnations, and 
stand on their own as solid and engaging stories.</P>
<P>Because Mr, Hoggett is laid up and the bank is threatening foreclosure, 
Mrs. Hoggett brainstorms and decides to travel to the city for a grand 
state fair.  There she will display "Pig," which is Babe's name to 
humans, and receive enough money to save the farm.  As the two board a 
plane that heads into the sky, there are captivating scenes of Ferdinand 
the duck (voice of Danny Mann) in hot pursuit, asking advice from a 
flock of wise pelicans.  When she is detained at the airport, Mrs. 
Hoggett not only misses the state fair but fails to locate a hotel that 
will accept her particular type of pet.  In the face of a stranger who 
tells her of a lodging where she and Babe/Pig will be safe, we see a 
motif that contributes again and again to the humor of the story.  
Another artifice surfaces when Mrs. Hoggett stumbles a second time into 
trouble with the law, leaving Babe alone with animals that at first seem 
menacing but turn out charming.  The bulk of the plot involves Babe's 
relationships with the animals that inhabit, in violation of city 
ordinances, this storybook hotel.  Will the creatures be saved from the 
animal control agency that evicts them?  Will Babe ever reunite with 
Esme Cordelia Hoggett, let alone with Arthur?</P>
<P>As Mrs. Hoggett, Magda Szubanski is outstanding.  In the original she 
was so much set decoration, a prudish Mrs. Sprat who talks two miles a 
minute and concerns herself with fattening the protagonist for 
Christmas.  In this story we see her determination developed and focused 
on those keeping her apart from Babe and from her husband.  She is 
wonderfully game in going after the endangered animals, paired with the 
drink-of-water woman (Mary Stein) who owns the hotel.  And when she dons 
an inflatable clown suit and bounces all over a ballroom in pursuit of 
Babe, we enjoy a series of belly laughs.  This was my son's favorite 
scene.</P>
<P>My daughter's favorite part involves a chimp named Zootie (Glenne 
Headley).  She is the mate of a punkish chimp voiced by the comedian 
Steven Wright.  Both lend their characters quirky and likable 
personalities.  Moreover, the animal actors perform memorably.  Along 
with the chimps there are multitudinous dogs (one with wheels for back 
legs, a creature that nearly made me fall into the aisle of the 
theater!), cats, a goldfish, a modest orangutan, and the familiar chorus 
of mice.  Congratulations to director George Miller, as well as to the 
many animal trainers, handlers and animatronics engineers.  They assist 
the animals in telling large sections of the narrative; perhaps the 
animals are more important than even the humans.</P>
<P>Mickey Rooney has a cameo as the hotel owner's uncle, a strange little 
man named Fugly Flooms.  He's a clown who entertains hospitalized 
children, and when he conscripts Babe to help in the magic act, very 
funny chaos follows.  In a small reprise of his role as Farmer Hoggett, 
James Cromwell shows his experience; he's tolerant and venerable, and 
after watching the first movie, you just know the words with which 
Hoggett will end this one.</P>
<P>It's refreshing to see such a promising lineup of family entertainment 
in theaters for the holidays.  My ten year-old oftens scans ratings and 
discovers no G- or PG-rated films playing anywhere.  For the next 
several weeks we will be able to take her to several.  Babe:  A Pig in 
the City holds its own with all audiences, as suggested by several 
senior citizens sitting around us, also laughing with abandon.  It may 
even garner for the franchise a second Academy Award nomination for Best 
Picture.</P>
