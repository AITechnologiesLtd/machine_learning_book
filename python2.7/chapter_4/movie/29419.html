<PRE>TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME
A film review by Blake French
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Two Can Play That Game turns love into a brutal battleground of the
sexes.  It's not about relationships as much as it is about the "rules"
they abide by (or don't abide by).  A twisted version of Angela Bassett
in How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Vivica A. Fox stars as a successful
businesswoman named Shante Smith.  She's a player, as she explains in
the opening scenes, knowing as much as there is to know about the
"rules" of love.</P>
<P>Shante has a bunch of friends, and a handsome, charming boyfriend named
Keith Fenton (Morris Chestnut), a successful lawyer himself.  One night,
Shante finds her love dancing with another woman at a nightclub -- and
so begins the vicious battles of the sexes.  Will the two get back
together, or will this be the end of their relationship?</P>
<P>As is obviously intended, Two Can Play That Game is sure to hit big with
the African American audience, but it should also be treasured as a
great date movie for the moviegoing public at large.  It's got the kind
of friskiness that makes you exchange glances with the stranger seated
next to you because both of you know how many things it gets right about
relationships.  With as many twists and turns as this romantic comedy
takes, you're sure to have a good time.</P>
<P>Still, while the production contains all the correct ingredients, it
uses them in the wrong recipe.  It hits a humorous bulls-eye with plenty
of cultural issues, but it lacks the very substance it's made of: True
love.  The film, written and directed by Mark Brown, makes a common
Hollywood mistake of confusing sexuality with true passion.  Not that
this destroys the film; in fact, for an R-rated sex comedy, this is very
tame material.  This production takes risks, but for a movie that
concerns itself so much with romance, it just doesn't get any of that
across convincingly.</P>
<P>With frequent soliloquies, intrusive narration, and a central character
that very much takes center stage, Shante does not just narrate the
film, she explains it.  Throughout the journey, she speaks directly to
the camera.  Seldom do filmmakers gamble their success on such an
unusual style, but the conceit gives the movie a sense of independence,
attitude, and a unique, experimental flavor.  Fox's performance keeps
energy alive, even when she knows her mouth is running a little too
much.  It's surprisingly entertaining. </P>
<P>Alas, the film does not really earn its ending.  It doesn't persuasively
prove the characters' sudden realizations.  But who cares?  Two Can Play
That Game is still light-hearted and fluffy.  It exists solely to please
the audience, but it also works as a social commentary.</P>
