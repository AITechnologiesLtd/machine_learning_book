<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>If you're not sickened by Nicholas Cage's dark journey into the realms
of the hardcore porn industry, chances are you'll be intrigued by it.
Bit by bit, an authentic version of this illegitimate world is brought
to life with kinky detail by talented hack director Joel Schumacher.
Schumacher's last two films were the muddled messes Batman Forever and
Batman & Robin, but here he has at least proven himself capable of
following a structured story and making it entertaining.  With a script
from a writer of such gritty wit as Andrew Kevin Walker (who penned
Se7en), it would be hard not to make 8MM a success.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Schumacher's direction sometimes flinches.  Whereas
Walker realizes the capacity for a disturbing but profound film,
Schumacher simply makes a thriller that is edgy enough to warrant a
sitting.  Although this film is a good example of why a director and
writer need to be on the same level, 8MM is nonetheless an amusing
full-throttle journey into places and characters that are rarely looked
at in movies.</P>
<P>"Dance with the devil and the devil doesn't change; the devil changes
you," a character tells Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), who really should
have listened.  Welles is a private investigator who lives a normal
existence with a wife (Catherine Keener) and a baby daughter.  Welles is
called in by a billionaire widow to investigate the origin of an 8MM
pornographic film that depicts the killing of a young teenager.  His
task is to find out whether the film is real or not.  The case finds
Welles in society's darkest corners, and he is guided by Max (Joaquin
Phoenix), a streetwise adult bookstore clerk.  As the two become closer
to finding out who made the film and why, their lives are jeopardized as
they find themselves deep in a web of conspiracies and hidden truths.</P>
<P>Welles is a reasonable and caring man for a reason - he serves as a
contrast from the decent to the indecent.  When evil eventually comes
knocking on Welles' door, he desperately tries to find meaning in evil
acts, all the while surrounded by people who couldn't care less. One
despicable character answers Welles' question of "why" by stating "the
things I do - I do them because I like them. Because I want to...I
wasn't beaten as a child. I didn't hate my parents.''  His search for
meaning in evil is cleverly written by Walker, who doesn't fall into the
trap of making anything that he does seem acceptable (Payback, anyone?).
Evil corrupts, and as Welles searches for answers, he is ultimately led
to commit deeds similar to the ones he has been disgusted by.</P>
<P>Fascinating stuff, that's for sure.  What then would inspire the
producers to hand the directing reigns over to Joel Schumacher - a man
whose best attempts to illustrate psychological images is to portray
visual ones?  8MM looks dark and scary, but rarely feels it.  For every
bit of intrigue that Walker generates, Schumacher limits its success,
and regularly turns potentially disturbing scenes into merely sleazy
scenes.  It's a trade-off that isn't very fair, that's for sure - one
can't help but feel that David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) or even Brian
De Palma (Mission: Impossible, Snake Eyes) would have been more suited
to direct.  Still, with the help of the animated presence of Nicholas
Cage, Schumacher has made an admirable thriller despite what he has
missed out on.</P>
