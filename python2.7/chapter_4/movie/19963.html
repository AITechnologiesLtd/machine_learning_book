<P>IN SHORT: Creepy and enthralling, with a twist you won't see coming.</P>
<P>Here's the hard part about writing up The Sixth Sense. If I tell you
anything that may clue you in to what is going on in this flick, I will
not be doing what I consider to be my job, 'cuz I'll be giving it away.
So I'm going to tell you a true set of stories to help illustrate some
of the shrink stuff going on in this fine flick.</P>
<P>When a person goes through extreme trauma, as when I broke my neck ten
years back, it is a normal psychological reaction to push away those
people who remind (him) of the trauma. It could be someone who was
present at the time. In my case it was "fix-up dates," all of whom had
suffered some major distraction, shall we say, in their lives. They had
been damaged, as had I and I didn't need to be reminded. It may seem
shallow, but that's life. When my closest friend lost a breast to
cancer, she pushed me out of her life by emasculating me in front of her
friends. I knew what she was doing and when I couldn't stand it anymore
I walked away. We haven't spoken since.</P>
<P>Which brings us to ace child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce
Willis), who's just been awarded the highest citation that the City of
Philadelphia can give to one of its citizens. His loving wife Anna
(Olivia Williams) doesn't mind playing second fiddle to her hubby's
devotion to his kidlet patients. Then the good doctor's past comes back
to bite him on the ass and extreme trauma kicks in.</P>
<P>A year later, post trauma, the normally quiet doctor has changed. He is
physically and emotionally distant to his wife, misses dates and
anniversaries, spends nearly all his free time with an exceptional case
concerning a potentially psychotic 8-year old boy named Cole Sear (Haley
Joel Osment). Most little kidlets have imaginary friends, but these tend
to fade at Cole's age. His "friends" are terrifying him because they're
not fuzzy li'l Dr. Seuss-type characters. They are the ghosts of people
long dead, all of whom have shuffled off this mortal coil in shocking
and/or violent ways.</P>
<P>Of course, he's probably nuts. He's hides in the local church, and has
scratches and gashes all over his body. His mom (Toni Collette) might be
abusing him, but that doesn't seem likely. His schoolmates all consider
him to be a freak, and as his therapy drags on, this poor kid shrinks
into a world where he is terrified beyond belief. Can the Doctor help
this poor kid? And what of helping his wife? How far should your work
take you from the people you love?</P>
<P>Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan has done an exceptional job on this,
his third feature. Everything you see is presented in a matter of fact
style, even the icky stuff. There may be a moment where you could feel
as if you've been manipulated in standard horrorflick mode, but there's
no slice 'n' dice. Nothing you see will seem out of place once you
accept the fact that this poor kidlet isn't nuts. And you will. And the
truth will blow you away.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is doing something unusual for him. He's being a quiet man.
No big action stunts, just quiet speak and doctorly concern. It's a nice
change. The real find is Haley Joel Osment, a kidlet who holds the
screen in a way not seen since Anna Paquin did it in The Piano.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Sixth Sense, he would have paid
. . .</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<P>After the Blair Witch Project failed to scare me silly y'all wanted to
know what creeps Cranky out. The Sixth Sense did. Don't confuse creepy
with scary, there's a lot more going on here than I'll even hint at.</P>
