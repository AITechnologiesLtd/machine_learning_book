<PRE>                              THE PILLOW BOOK
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE PILLOW BOOK is a stylishly
          presented but overly long and deliberate
          modernization of the 10th Century Pillow Book of
          Sei Shonagon.  What could have been a good study of
          clash of traditional and modern values never really
          gets beyond being self-indulgent and even obscure.
          Rating: -1 (-4 to +4), 2 (0 to 10)
          New York Critics:  8 positive, 2 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Peter Greenaway is a filmmaker who often expects a lot from his
audience and takes chances.  The downside of taking chances is that
sometimes you lose.  THE PILLOW BOOK is one of his losses.  This is a
film that is pretty to look at and one which does a lot of strange and
unexpected things with the visual style.  But the story is over-blown,
over-long, overly-obscure, and overly melodramatic.</P>
<P>     The basis and inspiration for Greenaway's latest film is the
original Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, published in Heian period, the
late 10th Century Japan.  The original was a collection of poetry,
reminiscences--some amorous, lists, and anecdotes all relevant to court
life of the time.  Greenaway's film inspired by that book is the story
of Nagiko (played by Vivian Wu), a modern woman who one millennium
later is collecting her own set of experiences, mostly erotic, inspired
by Sei, bur also by her own fascination with body painting.  Nagiko's
fascination stems from her father's annual ritual of on her birthday
painting text on her face and neck and retelling of how God made people
out of clay.  In his myth God painted each of them, naming them in the
process.  If He approved of his work he also signed it.</P>
<P>     Nagiko grows with an erotic fascination with having text painted
on her body.  Her first requirement of a lover is that he be a good
calligrapher, painting nearly anything on her body in any language.  In
flashbacks, often in only one small part of the screen, we see how her
father was betrayed by his publisher who also forced her into marriage
with his nephew.  The husband proves to be a cruel and insensitive man
who is also a lousy calligrapher in bed.  The film has a problem in
that most viewers from a European background are uneducated in the
subtleties of Japanese calligraphy and will not know good work from
work not so good.  Nagiko eventually finds love in the arms of Scotsman
Jerome (Ewan McGregor of EMMA and of course TRAINSPOTTING--any young
Scottish actor you see these days is probably from TRAINSPOTTING).  But
when the publisher's hand reaches again into her life, she decides it
is time for a particularly appropriate retribution.</P>
<P>     In the tradition of his PROSPERO'S BOOKS Greenaway plays with his
screen composition.  He varies the size and shape of the screen.  He
will inlay as many as four smaller frames with action into a full-sized
fifth frame, now reduced to a cross.  Greenaway works to combine the
texture of the original Pillow Book on paper with his own updated
version of the story.  The result is hypnotic but eventually the slow
and deliberate pacing and the repetition begin to wear on the audience.
Nagiko's attempts to recreate the painting experience of her early
youth in erotic terms almost reminds one of Jack Nicholson's stylized
erotic ritual toward the end of CARNAL KNOWLEDGE.  The pretensions of
Greenaway's style become a liability when there is too long for too
little story.  In the final analysis the story seems more an erotic
dream than an intelligent narrative.  Occasional pieces of wit do
leaven the story, but they require careful observation and are of a
very dry humor.  One example: characters in the film are painted with
texts meaningful to them, and apparently in the same vain a van is
painted with road maps, the texts that it follows.</P>
<P>     Greenaway's films are rich with style, but style without a good
plot can be as bad as plot without style.  I found his recent THE BABY
OF MACON far more rewarding.  Greenaway taking on Japanese culture
should have been a good deal more insightful and less tedious.  I rate
it a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
