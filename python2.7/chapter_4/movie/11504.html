<PRE>The Game</PRE>
<PRE>A David Fincher movie</PRE>
<P>With Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Unger, Jim Feingold and
others</P>
<P>We've all been there at some point: a brother's birthday approaches
and you've no idea what to give him. They guy has got everything.
Including more money than you have. So you buy a nice tie. Or you hand
bro a gift certificate. </P>
<P>Conrad van Orton (Sean Penn) give his brother Nick (Michael Douglas) a
certificate from Consumer Recreation Services. Nick is supposed to
play a mysterious game. All he knows about it is that it will change
his life.</P>
<P>And his life needs changing. Nick has money galore, but he's been
divorced for a long time and instead of friends he has business
partners whom he doesn't treat too well (WALL STREET revisited).</P>
<P>So Nick hands in his certificate. Suddenly he finds keys everywhere,
his TV starts talking to him and a mysterious blonde enters his life,
but not the kind that giggles and screams.</P>
<P>But there's more. He looses everything he owns, shoots his brother by
mistake and like his father many years ago sees only one way out of
his dilemma: suicide. He jumps off a roof - and lands on a giant air
cushion in the middle of his birthday party. After all, it's just a
game.</P>
<P>When his brother walks up to him with a big bloodstain on his breast
and a big smile on his face Nick doesn't punch him but gives him a big
hug, celebrates with his guests and even picks up the check.
I found that much harder to believe than all the strange things that
happened to Nick during the Game.</P>
<P>The movie is well made and features some superb acting especially by
Deborah Unger and Michael Douglas, but the ending ruined it a bit for
me. 
David Fincher cleverly made Nick van Orton a believable character
without slowing down the pace of the movie. In the end I just expected
more than a big grin plastered on Michael Douglas' face.</P>
