<P>Susan Granger's review of "ROCKY MARCIANO" on SHOWTIME TV</P>
<P> On Saturday, May 15, the 8 P.M.debut of a new "Rocky
Marciano" movie is part of a boxing theme night which will include the
classic films "Rocky" and "Raging Bull," plus a live boxing match. Jon
Favreau stars as Rocky, the only world heavyweight boxing champion to
retire undefeated in the history of the sport. Set in the summer of
1969, a few days before his 46th birthday, the story begins with the
fighter on a promotional tour, demanding cash, not checks, for each
personal appearance, and phoning home to his wife (Penelope Ann
Miller). It then flashes back to his childhood in the blue-collar town
of Brockton, Mass., where, as Rocco Marchegiano, he learned the value
of saving money from his immigrant father (George C. Scott) who worked
in a shoe factory. Vowing never to make shoes, young Rocky, as he was
called, realized the incredible power he packed in his right arm. A
devoted fan of Joe Louis (Duane Davis), he decided to become a boxer
but, without formal training, he lost many fights before he finally
won a big one - after he turned pro. Boxing was his ticket out of
Brockton when his raw talent was recognized by two corrupt "managers"
(Judd Hirsch, Tony Lo Bianco). Rocky never lost a professional
fight. He quit the ring in 1956 and, unlike many boxing greats, he
stayed retired. So, without a comeback to dramatize, the film
highlights two pivotal fights: one in which he seriously injured an
opponent and his match against Joe Louis. Actor Jon Favreau tries hard
to capture the underdog appeal of this not-very-colorful icon and the
supporting cast is superb. So, on the Granger Made-for-TV Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Rocky Marciano" punches a creditable 6, but it doesn't
pack a wallop.</P>
