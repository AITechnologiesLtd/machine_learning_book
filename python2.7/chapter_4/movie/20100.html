<PRE>BOWFINGER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The posters that adorn the walls of Bowfinger International
Pictures aren't the kind that would inspire many aspiring actors to shell
out $25.00 just to audition.  When these very walls pronounce "The Yugo
Story" (yes, the sassy little EEC compact) as the studio's top grosser, you
have to wonder what kind of a two-bit, third-rate production company this
really is.</P>
<P>        Well, it's the raison d'être of Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), a
two-bit, third-rate movie director.</P>
<P>        Bobby, not surprisingly, has had some difficulty competing with the
Paramounts and the Universals until the day he reads a script that knocks
his socks off.  The treatment, not your typical alien invasion picture, is
written by Bobby's accountant/receptionist following Bobby's encouraging
"if you're as good with words as you are with numbers, well...  I don't
need to finish that sentence."  In "Chubby Rain" (quite the best film title
within a film since "Love and Death on Long Island"'s "Hotpants College
II"), Bobby smells a hit.</P>
<P>        Speed-dialing virtually everyone he knows, Bobby pulls his
downtrodden, pessimistic employees together for a ten o'clock meeting,
promising that this is finally It.  If Bobby is good at anything it's the
small-time scam, and he manages to swindle a respected Hollywood producer,
briefly played by Robert Downey, Jr., into proclaiming "Chubby Rain" a "go
picture," except for one minor caveat: the film must headline action
superstar Kit Ramsey.</P>
<P>        Bowfinger's subsequent efforts to sign Kit don't prosper, setting
the master manipulator's wheels in motion again.  How about this for film
nouveau: shoot the entire movie without the star's knowledge or consent,
but with all the bit players harassing the unsuspecting Ramsey at every
possible opportunity.</P>
<P>        As conceived and written by Martin, that turns out to be an
absolute humdinger of a premise.</P>
<P>        Some might gripe that Martin has almost written himself out of the
picture, but that's a tribute to him and his craft, and it's partly why
"Bowfinger" works; there's no bologna in the shoes here.  Similarly, Eddie
Murphy (who plays Kit Ramsey and his braces-wearing, errand-running dingbat
lookalike Jiff) is near-on sensational in a demanding dual role, yet he
doesn't steal the film either.  After all these years, Martin and Murphy
still have what it takes.</P>
<P>        On the minus side, Heather Graham ("Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me") impresses in the early going as a just-off-the-bus Ohio hick
looking for fame and fortune in Tinseltown, but she quickly loses her charm
by forcing the issue.  Rollergirl was clearly a fluke; since her prominent
rise to stardom in "Boogie Nights," Graham has been very disappointing.</P>
<P>        While there are some perfectly inspired bits in "Bowfinger" (e.g.,
the scene in which they recruit the best film crew they can afford), some
scenes fall completely flat (e.g., Daisy's "hot chemistry" scene with
Jiff).  It's not clear whether the blame falls upon screenwriter Martin or
director Frank Oz (working here with the comedian for the fourth time), but
it makes for some uneven cinema.  In the long run, however, these
imbalances do little to harm "Bowfinger," a film that fans of Steve Martin,
Eddie Murphy, and skillfully written and performed comedy should enjoy.</P>
