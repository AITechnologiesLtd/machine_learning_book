Fight Club (10/10)</PRE>
<P>In Don DeLillo's novel Underworld, one character argues that "Rage and
violence can be elements of productive tension in a soul. They can serve
the fullness of one's identity. One way a man untrivialises himself is
to punch another man in the mouth." This is the subversive idea at the
heart of Fight Club.</P>
<P>Edward Norton plays The Narrator. He has a respectable job and an
apartment full of nice furniture and clothes, but he is troubled - his
job is unsatisfying and he cannot sleep. He seeks comfort in attending
self-help groups for people with diseases he doesn't have, finding
particular solace in a support group for victims of testicular cancer.
Just as The Narrator's life seems a little more settled, he meets Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), an anarchic crazy-man with several night-time jobs
who spreads a little chaos with everything he does. As a waiter he
urinates in the soup. As a cinema projectionist he splices subliminal
frames from pornographic movies into family films. As a soap salesman
he... but that would be giving away too much.</P>
<P>Outside a bar, Tyler invites The Narrator to hit him. He is reluctant at
first, but they soon start brawling. They find a strange satisfaction in
their cuts and bruises and meet every week to fight. Other men gather to
watch, and eventually one of then asks to join in. The first Fight Club
is born. Men from all walks of life gather in a dingy basement and take
turns at fist-fighting, beating each other to a pulp, and in the process
fighting back against their emasculation at the hands of society and
finding out what it means to be a brutish primaeval man again in an
over-civilised world. The club is an instant success and fight clubs
start appearing all over the country. Tyler Durden becomes an
underground hero, but is unsatisfied and seeks to inspire further chaos
through the sinister Project Mayhem.</P>
<P>David Fincher directs with a manic hyperactive inventiveness.
Astonishing images illustrate throwaway ideas, such as The Narrator's
apartment seen as items in an Ikea catalogue, or for a few seconds, a
terrifyingly realised mid-air plane collision. The medium of film itself
is played with: barely noticeable images appear only for a frame or two,
fake cue dots are used, and the film appears to judder and slip in the
projector showing its sprocket holes on the screen. And yet none of this
comes across as being tricksy: it all makes perfect sense in the context
of this surreal wham-bam beat-em-up world. Jim Uhls' screenplay (from
Chuck Palahniuk's novel) crackles along providing deliciously dangerous
fun. The film contains many jokes, but laughing is rarely an option -
the context of the jokes is so dark and the film so quickfire that by
the time you've had time to register that something was actually pretty
funny, the story has moved on.</P>
<P>Some have expressed outrage at the violence in the film. The fight
scenes are indeed very hard to watch, the savageness heightened by the
sounds of fist splitting flesh and breaking bone and tooth. One beating
in particular is so brutal and bloody that I was glad it had been
slightly cut. But like A Clockwork Orange nearly thirty years ago, Fight
Club is not so much a violent film as a film about violence, so its
disturbing depiction of savagery is more justifiable than the
meaningless violence in the average Hollywood action movie. Stanley
Kubrick's film raised the question of whether it is right for society to
suppress a man's natural brutality. Fight Club takes as a premise that
it's too late - social changes have already done it to men on a huge
scale - and tells the story of some men's reaction to this denial of
their true nature.</P>
<P>Both Norton and Pitt are magnificent, with Norton perhaps just coming
out on top given the more complex character he has to play. Excellent
design, sound and make-up all contribute to the film's impact and a fine
soundtrack from The Dust Brothers provides a perfect hard-but-cool
backdrop. There is a staggering and quite bizarre twist in the plot
which some people will find harder to stomach than the film's violence,
but I thought it gave the film a mythical, fantastical edge and provided
a retrospective justification for the film's wild visual style.
Dangerous and dazzling, Fight Club is as near as makes no difference a
masterpiece and beats Election into second place as my film of the year.</P>
