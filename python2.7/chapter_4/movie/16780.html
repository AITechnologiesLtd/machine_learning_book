<P>There are certain rules in Hollywood involving the portrayal of romantic
relationships on the big screen.  Certain combinations of leads
naturally go together – handsome men and beautiful women being the
predominant pairing.  Lately, a trend has emerged involving cute young
adult males and lovable teenage females (usually with shows on Fox or
the WB) and, once in a while, moviegoers are treated to the unlikely
affairs of rickety old men and chicks half their age.  Stars are always
fit, have great teeth, skin and hair, and are usually white.</P>
<P>Films that stray from these templates of success are generally
resounding box office failures.  Why?  Because people won't line up for
Number 18 with Hunan Foot, the touching story of a Chinese guy with a
really large head who falls in love with a 70-year-old lady leper.  They
will also reject Mommy, I'm Taller Than Daddy, starring a middle-aged
single mom with a huge raised birthmark on her face and her lucky find –
a midget with one eyebrow and a cowlick.</P>
<P>Howard Stern has made a career out of shining a spotlight on those
aforementioned oddities.  Until now, if you wanted to hear a drunk
dwarf, paranoid stutterers or alien lesbians, Howard was the only place
to go.  Hollywood could only ignore his phenomenal ratings for so long.</P>
<P>So, along comes The Other Sister (* 1/2), a film that bills itself as `a
romantic comedy for the emotionally challenged.'  Translation – a love
story about two retards.  They meet.  They fall in love.  The have a
fight.  They get back together.  They get married.  And they drive off
with their car dragging a `Just Lobotomized!' sign.  Okay, I made that
last part up, but it would have been more original than anything in
Sister's tiresome script.</P>
<P>The film opens with Carla (Juliette Lewis, Natural Born Killers) having
just graduated from the Roselake, a school for mentally-challenged
children.  Carla flies home to San Francisco, where her father (Tom
Skerritt) and overbearing mother (Diane Keaton) seem intent on keeping
her at home under a watchful eye.  They live in a giant house with a
live-in maid and a gate, so one has to wonder why they didn't just lock
her in the attic.  Like the Kennedys.</P>
<P>But Carla has other plans.  She wants to enroll in a public vocational
school.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants her own
apartment.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants a
boyfriend.  Her parents say no but…hey!  Are you tired of reading this
yet?  Try sitting through 130 minutes of it.</P>
<P>Lewis is remarkably unremarkable as Carla.  But, then again, Carla isn't
too far off of the roles that she usually plays.  Her love interest
Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi, Saving Private Ryan) is much better, but also
not much different from his recurring role of Phoebe's brother on
Friends.  Actually, the only difference is fake teeth.  Keaton's mother
is purposefully and pleasantly annoying while Skerritt is just plan
scary sans facial hair.</P>
<P>Sister was written and directed by Garry Marshall, who hit the big time
with ‘70s television shows like Mork and Mindy and Laverne & Shirley.
His resume as of late boasts the blockbusters Dear God and Exit to
Eden.  This is the first script he has written since 1984's The Flamingo
Kid, proving that writing must not be like riding a bike.  But, hey – if
you watch with your eyes closed, it sounds just like Howard.</P>
<P>2:10 – R for adult situations and mild language</P>
