<P>RAISE THE RED LANTERN (DAHONG DENGLONG GAIGAO GUA) (1991) (China,Taiwan,
Hong Kong)  *** Directed by Zhang Yimou. Written by Ni Zhen from the 1989
novel by Su Tong ³Wives and Concubines.² Camera, Zhao Fei. Cast: Gong Li,
Ma Jingwu, He Caifei, Qan Quifen, Jin Shuyan. An Orion Classics release. In
Mandarin with subtitles. 125 minutes. Rated PG. Art Theater.</P>
<P>The first Chinese movie ever nominated for Best Foreign Film in last year¹s
Oscars, ³Red Lantern² is the work of Zhang Yimou. He is a prize-winning
cinematographer who, within ten years, also established himself, along with
Chen Kaige, as the leading filmmaker of the Chinese New Wave called ³The
Fifth Generation²of the mid-Eighties. Zhang¹s ³Red Sorghum² received the
Golden Bear at the Berlin Festival, his ³Ju Dou² the Golden Hugo, at the
Chicago Festival, and ³Red Lantern² won five prizes in Venice, including
the Silver Lion.</P>
<P>³Raise the Red Lantern² is set in North China during the 1920s.  19-year
old Songlian (Gong Li, Zhang¹s fetish actress), drops out of the University
after one semester and her father¹s death.  Trapped by the lack of money
and the impossibility for a woman to become something, she can either marry
a poor man or become the fourth concubine of a wealthy one. She opts for
the latter.</P>
<P>The man is always anonymously referred to as The Master and the fact that
he is never photographed in close-up, underlines his psychological distance
from the women.  The non-family lives in a geometric compound where each of
the concubines has her own house around an inner courtyard.</P>
<P>The film¹s title refers to the red lanterns that, like the light outside a
studio where recording is in progress, are lit before the house in which
the Master chooses to spend the night. The mistress elected is prepared for
this by, among other ceremonies, a foot massage that presumably enhances
her libido.</P>
<P>The women¹s numbers correspond to their age. The First Mistress is an older
woman who is out of the sexual rivalry. The Second is relatively younger.
The Third is a pert, capricious, ex-opera singer.</P>
<P>Number Four, Songlian, is immediately immersed in intrigue. The ³raison
d¹etre² of the mistresses is solely the competition for the Master¹s
favors.  In opaque, devious ways, the women, who call each other ³Sister,²
compete for this distinction with manoeuvres, schemes, temporary alliances
and realignments.  Songlian¹s sullen, disappointed young maid, who had
hoped to become Number Four, adds to the tension.</P>
<P>There is a terrible emptiness in this household. Life is a void that,
paradoxically, has an epicenter. This is nightly sex , alluded to but never
seen graphically, but even so, sex without any hint of sensuality, feeling
or  pleasure. Everything revolves around  rank, status, the pecking order.
No one  really does anything. We see no books. We get minimal music, a
gramophone, some flutes, a game of mah-jong.  The women do eat regularly,
yet even the ordering of food is  another weapon yet in this war of
one-upmanship.</P>
<P>The claustrophobia is visually symbolized by the look of the place. The
courtyard is rectilinear and its geometry is repeatedly photographed from a
static, impassive point of view. The rooms have a strangely anonymous
lavishness which leads to depressing sterility, similar to the non-person
nature of the characters.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when the camera takes to the criss-crossing roofs of the
compound, it follows their sinuous, bisecting lines, in a way that
corresponds to the convoluted game that the ³sisters² plot and play, a game
that leads to tragedy.</P>
<P>The movie¹s deliberate pace and color coding oddly stress its implacable
³No Exit² theme. The feudal Master¹s mates are also his inmates, locked up
in a stockade of gilded cages, and prisoners too of their own narrow,
inescapable mentality.</P>
<P>In passing, the film shows the touching Chinese respect for education.
Songlian¹s single semester at the University gives her prestige. Says one
mistress to guests: ³She was a University student, I was just an opera
singer.² Another ³sister² asks Songlian : ³Please cut my hair.² ³But I have
never done it.² ³You went to the University, you¹ll do it better.²</P>
<P>³Raise the Red Lantern² takes place well before China raised the Red flag.
The Revolution, however, replaced one kind of tyranny with another. This
explains why the movie, like Zhang¹s earlier ³Ju Dou,² (also about the
oppression of women), is a ³pictura non grata,² unreleased in China.</P>
<P>It was made with devious, face-saving financing from Taiwan (via Hong
Kong), to a large degree thanks to Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Taiwan¹s premier film
director. He is listed in the credits as executive producer and may well
have influenced the film¹s esthetics.</P>
