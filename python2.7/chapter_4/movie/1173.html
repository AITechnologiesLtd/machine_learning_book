<PRE>                             THE MAN IN THE MOON
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is the story of a salt-of-the-
     earth sort of family in Louisiana in the 1950s, and
     especially Dani, a 14-year-old with a crush on the 17-year-
     old boy next door.  Two good performances and good
     photography are sold short by melodramatic plot twists.
     Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     It is 1957 in rural Louisiana.  Fourteen-year-old Dani Trant (played by
Reese Witherspoon) is just at the awkward age when she is approaching
womanhood and thinks she has neither looks nor intelligence.  She envies her
older sister Maureen (played by Emily Warfield), who is attractive and gets
good grades.  Then her father's old girlfriend, now a widow, moves in next
door, bringing her own family including a seventeen-year-old son, Court
Foster (played by Jason London).  Court and Dani become good friends.  Their
friendship begins platonically, but Dani gets a crush on Court and is
anxious to push things just a bit further.  All by itself this relationship
causes problems between Dani and her father Matthew (played by Sam
Waterston).  However, more family strains start to show when Court discovers
Maureen, a Trant daughter his own age.</P>
<P>     Robert Mulligan directs this story with all the sensitivity he can
muster.  And sensitivity is certainly what the plot needs, since it is
perilously close to being a trashy Southern passions sort of melodrama.  In
different hands this story could have been  another GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.
However, this is avoided, thanks to good acting on the parts of Reese
Witherspoon and especially Sam Waterston.  As Matthew, Waterston seems
uneasy with the responsibility of fatherhood.  By turns he is authoritarian
or compassionate, but neither with real conviction.</P>
<P>     The most unfortunate aspect of the film is a melodramatic turn toward
the end of the film.  the two sisters are headed for conflict in one way
when the all too obvious hand of the scriptwriter distorts things.  It
leaves the conflict but warps it into a different one, and one that may be
more quickly resolved.  The last twenty minutes of the film are the least
satisfying.</P>
<P>     Photography is by the excellent Freddie Francis, whose credits as
cinematographer include THE INNOCENTS, THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN, and
GLORY.  Overall the good moments of the film do not quite overcome its
weaknesses.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
