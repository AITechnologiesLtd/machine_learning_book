Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>

<P>I was thinking after I saw "L.A. Confidential," and I couldn't come up
with a single thing wrong with it.  And I couldn't think of one scene
where I wasn't totally engrossed, a character who wasn't at least a bit
interesting (save the really small parts), and a performance which
didn't hit the nail on the head.  "L.A. Confidential," which has been
getting some pretty just awards from critic circles as of late, is
definitely one of the most engrossing films of the year, and also one of
the best.</P>
<P>"L.A. Confidential" has a very complex plot, which somehow never feels
overwhelming.  The film follows three detectives in the LAPD back in the
50s: the wild fame-hungering Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), the
hot-tempered Bud White (the awesome Russell Crowe), and the by-the-rules
newcomer Ed Exley (Guy Pearce).  The film paints a negative yet positive
view on the LAPD, as being totally corrupt, with lots of politics,
hypocrisy, but with people who really want justice to be done, even if
they have to bend the truth a little.</P>
<P>The plot is set in motion following a little bit of police brutality on
Christmas Eve, when a bunch of cops, drunk on the spiked egg nog, beat
some mexicans up.  Exley, the nightwatchman for the night, testifies,
and is immeadiately made a lieutenant detective, much to the dismay of
everyone on the force.  Afterwards, Bud's ex-partner, Dick Stensland
(Graham Beckel), who was fired as a result, is found dead with a bunch
of others in a coffee shop.</P>
<P>The three detectives, working apart for most of the film, begin to
uncover lots of twists, as well as hidden secrets of L.A. life.  They
run into a wealthy man named Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn), who
runs a little side job, pimping for high-class hookers who look like
celebrities.  One of them turns out to be a woman named Lynn Bracken
(Kim Bassinger - I know, a shock), who looks like Veronica Lake, and who
soon begins fooling around with Bud.</P>
<P>The film unearths even more smut, as a result of the slimy Syd Hudgeons
(Danny DeVito), who runs a little gossip page called "Hush Hush," which
gets off on making people look bad.  The magazine gets a lot of tip-offs
from Vincennes (who also has a hysterical side job of being the
technical advisor for a "Dragnet"-esque show called "Badge of Honor,"
starring none other than Matt McCoy), as well as tipping off for
Vincennes. </P>
<P>>From this point on, the story is intricate, fun to watch, and filled
with depth.  The incident uncovers a lot of police corruption, leading
all the way to the top.  I loved the way the film was very responsible
about this, and showed the corruption being as a result of a lack of
justice in the world.  After all, justice is almost impossible to
inforce, and sometimes one needs to bend the truth a bit.</P>
<P>I also loved how every single scene in "L.A. Confidential" is
intricately planned out for the maximum effect.  For the entirety of the
film, I kept waiting for a scene to slip up, to go the wrong way.  The
plot never falters, even after twist upon twist upon twist upon twist,
etc.  And the characterization is always deep, and never false.  Curtis
Hanson (who has directed the horrible "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"
as well as the tepid "The River Wild") has created a wonderful film
here, filled with moody atmosphere, as well as a gorgeous backdrop.  I
mean, this is Hollywood.  In the 50s.</P>
<P>The acting is also amazing.  Kevin Spacey, of course, is amazing, as
usual.  But what's cool is how he shares the screen with two non-stars. 
Russell Crowe, who is an accomplished Aussie actor, who has been in a
couple American pics ("Virtuosity" and "The Quick and the Dead"), is
absolutely awesome in his role.  He has charisma, style, and even
depth.  Of course, if you've seen him in anything else, this isn't even
remotely a big shock.  And Guy Pearce is pretty incredible, looking very
stern yet kind of ignorant as to the ways of the LAPD.  And if you've
seen him as the ecstatic, overzealous, drag queen in "The Adventures of
the Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" (yes, he's also an Aussie), it's
even more incredible of a performance.  Interesting side note: all three
of the leads have played a gay man in a movie at least once.</P>
<P>And in the supporting region, DeVito and Bassinger are pretty awesome in
their respective roles.  DeVito has that kind of sliminess that only he
can make lovable, and he does it brilliantly here.  And Bassinger, who
is near the end of my list of actresses who would shock me with a great
performance, shocked me with a great performance.  Who knew Mrs. Baldwin
could act, what after that "Real McCoy" movie?</P>
<P>"L.A. Confidential" is definitely one of the best films of the year; a
masterpiece from start to finish.  There wasn't a moment where I wasn't
amazed, bowled over by its greatness.  This film just shows that one can
still do noir and make it non-Tarantino-esque.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
