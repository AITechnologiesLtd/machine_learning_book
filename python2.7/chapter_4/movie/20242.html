<P>When will Hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don't
cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life?  That is most certainly
the case with _Dudley_Do-Right_--or, should I say, _Deadly_Do-Wrong_. 
After the inexplicable box office success of the horrible
_George_of_the_Jungle_, it must've seemed like a good idea to have
_George_ star Brendan Fraser tackle another Jay Ward cartoon character,
the bumbling Canadian mountie and sworn enemy of the dastardly Snidley
Whiplash (Alfred Molina).  But if there's any justice in the world, the
fluke financial success of _George_ will not be duplicated, for this
excrutiatingly unfunny test of patience is even worse than that awful
film.  Writer-director Hugh Wilson's (who last teamed with Fraser earlier
this year in _Blast_from_the_Past_) idea of comedy is having Dudley wear
a moose head and get repeatedly hit by his cabin's loose floorboards.  If
you're with Wilson and are sent rolling on the floor by those gags, by
all means, go to the film.  Everyone else would be wise to just watch the
new _Fractured_Fairy_Tale_ animated short that precedes the film... when
the film hits video.</P>
<P>The other live-action cartoon adaptation of the summer,
_Inspector_Gadget_, is indeed better, but only in the sense of what a
severe migraine is to a heavy blow to the head: not as damaging, but
still painful as all hell.  Matthew Broderick plays the cop outfitted
with various mechanical gizmos to defeat the evil Claw (Rupert Everett,
cashing a paycheck) in this effects-laden, fast-paced film.  The problem,
though, is that the film is simply too fast-paced--a loud, hyperactively
acted, directed, and edited exercise in sensory overkill that calls out
for a lethal dose of Ritalin.  That none of the 80 or so minutes in the
film isn't slightly funny doesn't help--it just makes you reach for more
Excedrin.</P>
