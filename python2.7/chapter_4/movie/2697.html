<P>     BLOWN AWAY is more blarney than blast--a bum 'boiler about a
brilliant bomber baiting a Boston bomb squad bloke. Jones is the joker
and Bridges the bluecoat and, if you believe the script, they're both
IRA buddies from before.  At least they *were*, until a botched bombing
sent the set scurrying.  Jones went to jail and Bridges went to
Beantown, where he changed his identity and became a policeman.</P>
<P>     Forget the sustained suspension of SPEED, this "thriller" has
holes big enough to drive a city bus through.  Here is a film that,
among other things, asks its audience to believe that someone with IRA
ties (and an Interpol record, no less!) could be hired as a police
officer!  [Insert clip of author shaking his head.]</P>
<P>     Taken "as is," BLOWN AWAY isn't even good escapism.  Every
character talks too much, and, when the time comes to blow something up
(which isn't often enough), the film never shifts into high gear.  The
filmmakers even botch *the* best set-up in the biz:  a chance to cue a
scene to the finale of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture!" Somebody check
the cemetery--Hitchcock *must* be rolling in his grave.</P>
<P>     (And what about that stupid scene of a booby-trapped hard-drive?
Gimme a break!  Do big-city bomb squads *really* face situations as
seemingly absurd as these?  Rigged elevators I'll buy.  But not this.)</P>
<P>     The acting is all fine, with Forrest Whitaker a particularly
welcome addition as another bomb squadder.  His presence may be a nod
to THE CRYING GAME, but the less said about the Irish angle, the
better.  Especially in the wake of the just-out-on-video IN THE NAME OF
THE FATHER.  And don't forget to listen for those great bad accents,
including (Jeff) Bridges' back-and-forth Bostonian.</P>
<P>     The leads shouldn't fear the future. However badly BLOWN AWAY
bombs, Bridges will still be standing.  As will Tommy Lee Jones, signed
to square off with Val Kilmer in BATMAN FOREVER.  But what about
director Stephen Hopkins?  He's a smart talent who hasn't been given
anything *exciting* to film since the vastly underrated PREDATOR 2.
Hopefully we haven't seen the last of him.</P>
