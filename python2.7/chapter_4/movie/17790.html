<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>The tagline says that `Some things are worth waiting for.'  This sure
ain't one of them.  Drew Barrymore (Ever After) stars as Josie Gellar,
the youngest copy editor in the storied history of the Chicago
Sun-Times.  (Do you think that makes Roger Ebert hate the film more or
less?)  She's meticulously uptight and loves the sentimentality of your
typical Hallmark card.  In other words, a mousy brown-haired virgin.</P>
<P>Although she longs to one day be an undercover reporter, her superior
Gus (John C. Reilly, Boogie Nights) pays no attention to Josie.  That
is, until the day the Times' nut-job editor-in-chief (Garry Marshall),
who is tired of getting scooped, assigns a surprised but exuberant Josie
to work undercover at South Glen South, a local high school.  Now, mind
you, there isn't any particular story he wants unmasked.  She's just
supposed to stumble onto something earth-shattering that will boost
paper sales.</P>
<P>Now, if I had a nickel for every time I heard some schlub say, `If I
could go back to high school now, knowing what I know, my whole life
would be different – tee-hee-hee.'  Sure it would.  The closest these
people come to doing something about their personal schooling horrors is
to relive it vicariously through Johnny Depp on 21 Jump Street.  It's
sort of like saying `Jeez, if I knew that eating a box of Twinkies every
day would make my ass-shadow eclipse Cleveland, I never would have
started – tee-hee-hee.'</P>
<P>Josie is just like these out-of-touch wonders.  Even though she was a
zitty geek (nickname: `Josie Grossie'), she looks forward to getting
another stab at being popular.  The newspaper rigs her with a hidden
camera, with all images being transmitted back to Gus, who apparently
has nothing better to do all day than watch his reporter's exploits,
hereafter dubbed `The All-Humiliation Network' due to Josie's uncanny
knack of not being able to fit in.  In fact, she's forced to befriend
the lowest of the low (according to the 1999 edition of The High School
Food Chain) – the math club and their leader (a brilliant Leelee
Sobieski, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries).</P>
<P>Things take an odd but expected twist when Josie's brother Rob (David
Arquette, Ravenous) also enrolls at South Glen South.  Why?  Because he
apparently blew his shot at a big baseball scholarship when he came down
with mono before the most important game in his high school career.  His
instant popularity jettisons the homely Josie into the ranks of the
school's social elite and even nets her the welcome advances of the
skinny-cool-sensitive guy who plays guitar.  When I was in high school,
guys like this got beat up.  Now, I guess they're popular.</P>
<P>Throw in the predictable romance with her English teacher (Michael
Vartan, The Curve, who weaves in references to the whole `All the
world's a stage' thing from Shakespeare's As You Like It), as well as
the big prom finale (which is actually a competition with rival high
school East Glen East, natch) and you know you're just minutes away from
a gem of a line like `I've waited my whole life to fit in…and now, I
finally do!'  Sit down and shut up.  You're not really fitting in.  It's
a sham of a mockery of a travesty of a sham.  And I think she wore the
same dress to the prom that she wore in Ever After.  Talk about your
fashion faux pas!  It's a good thing Joan Rivers wasn't covering that
event.</P>
<P>Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne,
unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect.  But her performance
isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems with Never Been
Kissed, which was directed by John Hughes understudy Raja Gosnell (Home
Alone 3) – who apparently didn't study enough.  But if you go, make sure
you stay for the closing credits because they show school pictures of
the whole cast and crew.  (1:47 – PG-13 for mild language, sex talk and
implied drug use)</P>
