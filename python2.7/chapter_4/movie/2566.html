                        A Film Review by James Berardinelli

<P>     From MALCOLM X to CROOKLYN, Spike Lee has moved from heavy, epic 
drama to something significantly more lighthearted.  As with his previous 
film, this one places us into a time capsule, although the destination 
is much closer to the present.  Instead of drifting back to the first 
half of this century, we're only going to 1973, a year when afros and 
bellbottoms were in fashion; when the Knicks won the basketball 
championship; and when there were enough pop tunes to fill a 
soundtrack. </P>
<P>     Told from the point-of-view of 10-year old Troy Carmichael (Zelda 
Harris), CROOKLYN is the story of how one family struggles to survive 
and stay together.  With Troy's musician dad Woody (Delroy Lindo) busy 
in the basement composing, the full burden of running the family - and 
bringing home the money - falls on Troy's mom, Carolyn (Alfre 
Woodard).  This inevitably leads to tension between the two adults, 
and when one particularly nasty fight explodes, Woody is out the door.   </P>
<P>     Producer/director Spike Lee has woven a wonderfully rich drama that 
has one major stumbling block.  Two-thirds of the way through the 
movie, Troy goes south to visit a hyper-religious aunt.  To emphasize 
how distorted the little girl's perception of this vacation is, Lee 
shoots this portion of the movie with an anamorphic lens, causing 
everything to seem elongated.  While that's fine for short sequences, 
in this case it goes on for too long, becoming an annoying trick that 
nearly undermines the entire film.   </P>
<P>     Aside from this twenty-minute detour, there aren't many flaws in 
CROOKLYN.  All but the most comic of urban violence has been removed, 
and we're left with a somewhat-idealized view of an early-70s 
Brooklyn.  Lee is as talented as any director is capturing a time, and 
some of the early scenes perfectly recall the mood of the era.  The 
pop soundtrack may be a little too obvious, but it gets the job done. </P>
<P>     As usual, Lee has assembled an excellent cast.  Alfre Woodard and 
Delroy Lindo do tremendous jobs.  David Patrick Kelly (who is also 
currently featured in THE CROW) provides a little comic relief as the 
white next-door neighbor who annoys just about everyone.  Then there's 
Zelda Harris, whose fine, unaffected performance is the glue that 
holds the picture together. </P>
<P>     CROOKLYN comes to the screen with an upbeat tone and a lot of heart.  
The world of a child - especially one pushed all-too-soon into 
adulthood - is never easy, and this film captures the facets of Troy's 
odyssey.  If Lee errs with his "Southern vacation" scenes, he recovers 
to create an ending that is both touching and hopeful.  Beneath the 
surface of this deceptively simple motion picture lurks a singularly 
keen insight. </P>
