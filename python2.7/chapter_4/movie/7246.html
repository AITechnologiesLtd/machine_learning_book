<PRE>CHRISTMAS TURKEY</PRE>
<P>It's hard not to like comedies starring muscley action heroes denying
their true movie destiny. Watching Arnie painfully flubbing punchlines
instead of throwing satisfying punches, and Sly languishing in a
straightman role, where bad things keep happening to him instead of
easily vanishing when he runs at them with his guns, has become such a
delightful regularity (ohh, about once a year or so these days) that
these so-called comedies are virtually a new genre on their own. </P>
<P>See, *these* guys, these Action Heroes who mistake breathing for acting,
are funny *by themselves*. They're funny when they're expirating tough
one-liners because they seem to believe so fully in their importance,
but they're even funnier when they're pretending not to notice how
important they already are. On a metadramatic level, it's impossible not
to adore the superhuman bravery involved in the Terminator swapping
places with Emma Thompson in JUNIOR and tying himself genetically to
Danny DeVito in TWINS, or when Rocky Balboa takes off his boxing gloves
to be smothered by his midget mother in STOP, OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT!</P>
<P>And like these others (except OSCAR, which I really kinda liked), JINGLE
ALL THE WAY, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a momentarily failed father
trying to get back into his son's good graces, is pretty bad. The script
is woefully cliched, the ideas deliberately packaged into cute music
video montages that will only irritate, and Arnold.. well, Arnold is
just Arnold.</P>
<P>He's also Howard Langston, a bigwig at what appears to be a mattress
production company, who misses his son's, Jamie's (Jake Lloyd), karate
ceremony because he's too busy at the office. In a moment of human
conviction he swears to make it up to him by getting him anything he
wants for Christams. Jamie wants a Turbo Man (which Schwarzenegger
pronounces as "tear-bo man") Doll, the hero of his favourite action hero
cartoon.</P>
<P>Of course the Turbo Man doll is an extremely popular item, and has been
sold out since Thanksgiving. Langston's wife, Liz (Rita Wilson), did ask
him to get one weeks ago, but he'd completely forgotten about it. Now
it's Christmas Eve and he has one day to buy the doll as well as return
home in time for the Christmas Parade that same night.</P>
<P>That's the premise of the story, which sends Howard on a self-inflicted
quest throughout countless malls (including the Mall of America) to find
and purchase the elusive Turbo Man doll. At stake is the somewhat
fragile bond with his son, favour with an increasingly unhappy wife
("Damn you, Howard," she whispers when he unwittingly yells at Jamie on
the phone), and the very American need to redeem all past failings with
his son by securing this one triumph. On the way he meets (and keeps
meeting) a fellow parent and mailman called Myron (Sinbad) who also
seeks a Turbo Man for his son, and crosses swords (and loses) more than
once with an irate policeman (Robert Conrad). </P>
<P>The tribulations are many: store clerks laugh at him continuously in a
silly montage sequence that really tells you what the film's going to be
like from the start, massive parent crowds barrage toy stores and
continually get the better of poor Arnie, even though he's big enough to
eat most of them. In one instance he chases a ballot ball into a child's
playpen and is creamed by mothers in handbags for being a pervert. In
another he is lured by a mall santa (John Belushi) to a huge warehouse
eerily filled to the brim with more merry Santas and fenced toys. He
almost gets his doll here, but a brawl ensues that culminates in a
police raid.</P>
<P>The latter sequence, with its surreal landscape of fluffy, crimson Santa
thugs, is one of the better bits of JINGLE ALL THE WAY. Another nice
part is the Turbo Man action cartoon that Jamie the son idolizes. A
rough imitation of those strange Japanese action cartoon-dramas (Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers, Masked Rider), the Turbo Man cartoon comes with
sidekicks and cool metallic outfits. Coolest, however, is the final
sequence which pits Howard against Myron in a surreal titanic battle for
a special edition of the Turbo Man doll (it's gold-plated!) as both men
play out their roles as Good and Evil personified on the Turbo Man float
at the Christmas parade. I'm going to beat you, Myron crows
convincingly, because I have a bigger brain! He does, indeed. It's
purple and we can see it sticking out of his head in a transparent globe
filled with brainwater. </P>
<P>For the most part however, expect variations of the same theme from
KINDERGARTEN COP, JUNIOR and even TWINS, that will probably form the
basis of all Arnold comedies: ordinary life is just too *hard*; watch
Arnold grimace and lose out to his perfect, cookie-baking neighbour
(played smarmily by Phil Hartman) who dispenses Christmassy duties with
annoying cheer, watch him get bullied by a real reindeer and flail
hopelessly when it comes to something as mundane as Christmas shopping. </P>
<P>JINGLE ALL THE WAY is pitched like a mockup of the disgusting
consumerism that rares its head during the Christmas season. But the
flat dialogue and overly sentimental portions go very far towards
smothering all life from this potentially satiric movie. </P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
