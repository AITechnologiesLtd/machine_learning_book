<PRE>The Mod Squad
At Theatres Everywhere (not that you should waste your money on this)
By Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>   It is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for
the invention of the Timex IndiGlo watch.</P>
<P>   Based on the late 1960's television show by the same name, The Mod
Squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the
police to go undercover. However, things go wrong as evidence gets
stolen and they are immediately under suspicion.  </P>
<P>   Of course, the ads make it seem like so much more. Quick cuts, cool
music, Claire Dane's nice hair and cute outfits, car chases, stuff
blowing up, and the like. Sounds like a cool movie, does it not? After
the first fifteen minutes, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not.</P>
<P>   The Mod Squad is certainly a slick looking production, complete with
nice hair and costumes, but that simply isn't enough. The film is best
described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video,
both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half. And with it
comes every single cliché. It doesn't really matter that the film is
based on a television show, as most of the plot elements have been
recycled from everything we've already seen.</P>
<P>   The characters and acting is nothing spectacular, sometimes even
bordering on wooden. Claire Danes and Omar Epps deliver their lines as
if they are bored, which really transfers onto the audience. The only
one to escape relatively unscathed is Giovanni Ribisi, who plays the
resident crazy man, ultimately being the only thing worth watching.
Unfortunately, even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess, as all
the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time. </P>
<P>   With the young cast, cool clothes, nice hair, and hip soundtrack, it
appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset. Despite an
American 'R' rating (which the content does not justify), the film is
way too juvenile for the older mindset. Information on the characters is
literally spoon-fed to the audience (would it be that hard to show us
instead of telling us?), dialogue is poorly written, and the plot is
extremely predictable. The way the film progresses, you likely won't
even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy, because you'll know they
aren't.</P>
<P>   Basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is
of questionable wisdom, especially when one considers the target
audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on
television shows can be counted on one hand (even one that's missing a
finger or two). The number of times that I checked my watch (six) is a
clear indication that this film is not one of them. </P>
<P>   It is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in
on the teenage spending dollar, judging from the rash of really awful
teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late. Avoid this film at all
costs.</P>
