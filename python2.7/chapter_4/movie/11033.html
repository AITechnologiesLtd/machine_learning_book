A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Frank Coraci</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Tim Herlihy</PRE>
<P>Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Matthew Glave</P>
<P>Ingredients: 1980s setting, wedding musician, waitress, romance</P>
<P>Synopsis:
The story takes place in the 1980s but it could just as easily be any
typical Hollywood romantic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl,
and they regain each other by the end. Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a down
and out musician who makes his living singing at weddings. After getting
left at the altar at his own wedding, Robbie's luck goes downhill until
he falls in love with his friend, a waitress named Julia (Drew
Barrymore). The two were made for each other. The trouble is, fair Julia
is engaged to unfaithful rich jerk Glen. At the same time, Robbie's
scummy old fiancee wants to get back together with him. Can Robbie and
Julia get past all the misunderstandings and find true love with each
other before Julia takes that plane to Vegas to marry Glen? </P>
<P>Opinion: 
THE WEDDING SINGER is okay for a romantic comedy, with some dumb jokes
and some good ones, lots of chuckling at the 1980s decade, a good 'best
of the 80s' soundtrack, and a cameo by 80s rocker Billy Idol. Although
it is silly at times, and neither deep nor meaningful THE WEDDING SINGER
is big-hearted happy movie that any sucker for romance would love to
watch.</P>
