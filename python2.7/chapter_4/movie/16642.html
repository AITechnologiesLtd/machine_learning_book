<P> Great Expectations (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ethan Hawke,
Gwyenth Paltrow, Robert De Niro and Anne Bancroft.</P>
<P> What sets a classic above the rest is its timelessness and universality.</P>
<P> No matter how you bend or twist it, its themes transcend age and culture.</P>
<PRE> Thus it is with Great Expectations.</PRE>
<P> Screenwriter Mitch Glazer's loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel
transports the tale of a poor orphan boy's rise to riches from 19th-century
England to contemporary Gulf Coast Florida and New York City.</P>
<P> Glazer simplifies Dickens' complex tale, jettisoning some characters and
subplots, while retaining the essence of the story.</P>
<P> Director Alfonso Cuaron, Glazer and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have
given the picture a fairy tale-like look, painting scenes - literally and
figuratively - in broad strokes.</P>
<P> The once-majestic mansion of Miss Dinsmoor (the modern Miss Haversham) is
a colorful collage of decay and neglect.</P>
<P> Dinsmoor herself, a courageous, eccentric interpretation by Anne Bancroft,
mirrors her surroundings. Her clothes look as though they were shoveled
upon her, while her garish makeup gives her the appearance of a walking
cadaver.</P>
<P> Contrasting the outrageousness of Bancroft's performance is the intense,
smoldering interplay between Ethan Hawke's Pip (now called Finn) and
Gwyneth Paltrow's Estella.</P>
<P> When onscreen together, the two exude sensuality. Paltrow's feline air,
her ice-princess persona as Estella is a fine counterpoint to Hawke's
passionate, but somewhat innocent, Finn.</P>
<P> Paltrow's remoteness makes her a fitting Muse for Hawke's budding artist.</P>
<P> Their love scenes, a Glazer addition definitely not found in Dickens, are
erotic and shimmering.</P>
<P> Helping the story along are the two young actors who portray Finn and
Estella as youngsters. Jeremy James Kissner and Raquel Beaudene are dead
ringers for their older counterparts.</P>
<P> Robert De Niro adds an air of menace as the escaped convict who turns
Finn's life around, while Chris Cooper brings a decency and humanity to the
role of Joe, Finn's uncle.</P>
<P> Purists may complain about Glazer's treatment, but, overall, this Great
Expectations should hold the interest of young viewers and, perhaps,
rekindle an interest in one of Dickens' better works.</P>
