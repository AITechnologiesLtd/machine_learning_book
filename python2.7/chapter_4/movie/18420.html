<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Roger Nygard's hysterical documentary about the fans of Star Trek can be
summed up in one scene, where one aficionado describes the growing
popularity of his annual Trek party by proudly stating that `This year,
we had a girl come and everything!'</P>
<P>Such a brazen mockery of the world's easiest target is particularly
welcome among film critics, since Trekkies are the only group lower in
the social food chain.  We may be dorky, but we don't force our pets to
don miniature replicas of Kirk's uniform (they do).  We also don't bid
thousands of dollars for a piece of latex that previously served as one
Trek character's ridged forehead (they do that, too).</P>
<P>But the film also serves an educational purpose.  Viewers will hear both
sides of the timeless `Trekkie' versus `Trekker' battle, learn how to
speak Klingon, and find out which action figures are worth liquidating
their 401(k) to buy.  You can also see Leonard Nimoy scratch his head
while trying to figure out what the hype is all about.</P>
<P>Remember that wacko that insisted on wearing her Star Fleet uniform when
she was called for Whitewater jury duty?  She's here.  So is a dentist
that not only sports his Commander attire to work every day, but also
forces everyone in his office to do the same.  Their stories are mixed
together with dozens of other crackpots, including one particularly
strange woman that swore her cat was a big fan, too.  The film's closing
credits reveal a dedication to that same cat, who I am assuming took its
own life just to get away from the lunatic clutches of its owner.  (1:26
– PG for mild sexual and drug references)</P>
