 Down to Earth (2001) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Chris Rock, Regina
King, Mark Addy, Eugene Levy, Chazz Palminteri, Frankie Faison, Greg
Germann and Jennifer Coolidge. Screenplay by Chris Rock, & Lance
Crouther & Ali Le Roi & Louis CK. Based on the film "Heaven Can Wait,"
screenplay by Elaine May and Warren Beatty from a play by Harry Segall.
Directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. PG-13.</P>
<P> Third timeís a charm, the adage goes, but exceptions are possible.</P>
<P> Take Down to Earth, for example. It is the third version of Here Comes
Mr. Jordan, originally produced in 1941 and remade by Warren Beatty in
1978 as Heaven Can Wait.</P>
<P> The story is simple: A young man is accidentally taken before his time.
The young man and his guardian angels then spend the rest of the film
seeking the right body in which to return him to the land of the living.</P>
<P> Along the way he, of course, falls in love, and at the fade-out
everything has worked out as divinely planned.</P>
<P> Here Comes Mr. Jordan actually won two Academy Awards, one for original
story, the second for original screenplay.</P>
<P> Heaven Can Wait, received 10 nominations, but won in only two minor
categories ó art direction and set decoration.</P>
<P> And that brings us to Down to Earth. Before a reel of film unspools you
know problems will abound. Why? Because the story is credited to four
screenwriters: star Chris Rock, Lance Crouther, Ali Le Roi and Louis CK.</P>
<P> It should not take four screenwriters to hash out a plot based on a
screenplay co-written by the legendary Elaine May and Warren Beatty.</P>
<P> Down to Earth has a disjointed feel to it as if bits from each of the
writers were blended into a cinema stew without any thought of
cohesiveness. It jumps around from scene to scene without any rhyme or
reason. It feels as if were taped together instead of edited.</P>
<P> A few laughs and a couple of chuckles rear their heads, but nothing
sustains them.</P>
<P> The major problem is Rock. He is a fine comedian, but an inept actor.
His delivery of lines sounds like a constant standup routine. Every
sentence is shouted like its a punchline to some joke. Rock needs to
learn how to modulate his voice and phrase dialogue.</P>
<P> Some of the humor works, especially Rockís diatribe about hospitals and
his put-down of a heckler at a comedy club. But most of the jokes are
not that funny.</P>
<P> In this version of the story Rock plays Lance Barton, a failed standup
comedian, instead of an athlete as in the plotís previous incarnations.</P>
<P> Heaven, as shown here, is a chintzy nightclub that would even make
Vegas blush. God, if we are to believe Down to Earth, has neither a
sense of taste nor style.</P>
<P> Lance is sent back to earth and inhabits the body of a white,
53-year-old ruthless business tycoon, but even the comic possibilities
associated with this point are not utilized to their full potential.</P>
<P> What we get are shots of a balding, chubby white guy trying to sing and
move to the beat of rap music. Hilarious, not!</P>
<P> Down to Earth is deficient is plot and in substance. The weight of the
picture falls on Rockís shoulders and while he strenuously tries to hold
it up, he ultimately fails. Unfortunately, as a co-writer and an
executive producer, he must shoulder some of the blame.</P>
<P> Rock has potential to be a fine comic actor. His work in Nurse Betty
and Dogma attest to that.
It just may be he still lacks the stamina to pull his own movie.</P>
<P> Nice try, Chris, but we are certain you can do better.</P>
