<P>Many claim that an Academy Award nomination is a springboard to bigger and
better things. In Sharon Stone's case, her nomination for 1995's CASINO
brought her roles in such commercial disasters as DIABOLIQUE, LAST DANCE,
SPHERE, THE MIGHTY and GLORIA. Unfortunately for her fans, this film is just
another piece of dung to hang on the mantle of bad movie choices.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The lives of a rich horse-breeder and his wife are turned upside-down when
an old friend returns with some incriminating evidence to link them to a
blackmailing scheme which occurred about 20 years earlier.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting premise and build-up turns into a ho-hum mystery flick with very
little intrigue or originality, filled with overwrought drama in the face of
underwhelming secrets and characters who behave in ways inexplicable and
unexplained to the audience. Mystery dramas work best when a deep, dark
secret draws layers and layers of deceit, blackmail and revenge on top of
the original cover-up, but this film basically takes one blackmailing secret
and blows it up to be more than what it truly is. In fact, this supposedly
"dark secret" seems to have been eating away at these people for over twenty
years, but according to what I saw in this film, there wasn't really much to
be worrying about in the first place. In fact, the movie doesn't even really
bother resolving anything regarding the secret, save for a few bogus
attempts by one of the original blackmailers to seek revenge on the others,
but even that doesn't really go anywhere. If there is some deeper meaning in
this film about how one's past is always set to haunt them, well then fine,
whoop-dee-doo, good point.</P>
<P>But why waste a perfectly well-established blackmailing background when you
are just going to beat around its bush for an hour and a half, offer very
little intrigue or suspense, and end it all off on a shoulder-shrugging
whimper? What a bust. It's too bad because I was actually interested in this
movie for most of its length, with a definite kudo in the way of the
flashback sequences which helped establish the back-story as the film
progressed. Albert Finney was also a standout as the old man with a sorted
past, as well as Keener who spiced up her cute, innocent role with some of
her usual flair. Of course, Bridges and Nolte respectively stamped in their
proverbial roles as the upper-class dude with great blow-dried hair and the
two-bit boozehound with a messed up doo. And Stone, aaah Sharon Stone, what
can we say? Can anyone say "over-acting" or a cheap imitation of the classic
Jessica Lange drunk? Luckily for her, she's barely in this film, but I think
it's time for her agent to start handing her more of the "sexier" scripts,
since her foray into the world of character flicks, seems to falling flat.
All in all, this film does have a decent premise and solid acting for the
most part, but doesn't fill in enough holes, offer enough real suspense or
give us enough insight into the motivations of its characters to warrant a
recommendation from my end.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Sharon Stone is apparently a member of MENSA, with an IQ of 154. Her
first "screen" role was as the "pretty girl on the train" at the beginning
of Woody Allen's STARDUST MEMORIES. In 1980, she auditioned and lost the
role of Vickie LaMotta to Cathy Moriarty for the Martin Scorsese movie
RAGING BULL. Fifteen years later, she starred as Ginger in Martin Scorsese's
CASINO and received her first Oscar nomination for her role.
According to the IMDb, in 1962 Nick Nolte was given a 5-year probation for
selling fake draft cards.
Actress Catherine Keener is married to actor Dermot Mulroney.
Kimberly Williams plays the "young Sharon Stone" role in this movie. Her
first big break was when she was chosen as the lead in the 1991 comedy THE
FATHER OF THE BRIDE with Steve Martin.
This is director Matthew Warchus' first film as well as his screenwriting
debut. The film is actually based on a Sam Shepard play.</P>
