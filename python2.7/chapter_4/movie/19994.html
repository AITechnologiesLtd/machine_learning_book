TEN DAYS' WONDER, THE (DECADE PRODIGIEUSE, LA) (director: Claude
Chabrol; screenwriters: Paul Gégauff/Paul Gardner/Eugene Archer;
cinematographer: Jean Rabier; cast: Orson Welles (Theo), Anthony Perkins
(Charles), Marlene Jobert (Helene), Michel Piccoli (professor),
1972-Fr.)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style, some
very successful, others not quite hitting the mark. This one is a
theological mystery that is done in English, from an Ellery Queen novel.
It is supported  by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that
will involve adultery, madness, blackmail, deception, jealousy,
theology, and murder. Its results are mixed, being that it succeeds as
something different from most thrillers but, it is rather chaotically
done. At times it looks as if it were a B- movie.</P>
<P>Perkins' over-the-top portrayal of the manic Charles is eye catching. He
has sex with his father's wife Helene (Marlene), his young stepmother.
This is done in the handsome style Chabrol has come to be known for when
he wants to raise eyebrows about the bourgeoisie. Charles is the adopted
son of Theo (Orson), who found him on the doorsteps of his house and
decided to keep him. Theo is an eccentrically wealthy man who owns just
about everything in the village they live in. In 1925, he built his
excessively palatial dream mansion with 80 rooms, needing seven servants
to take care of the occupants and the vast grounds.</P>
<P>We first come across Charles in a hotel room, as he awakens from a
religious dream all covered with blood. He suffers from memory loss of
how he spent the last four days. Worried about this he calls his old
college philosophy professor (Piccoli), who he has not seen for years
but, of whom, he has fond memories. He invites the professor to be his
guest at the mansion, hoping that the professor can piece things
together for him. He tells of his relationship with his father's wife,
shows him his studio where he has done classical Greek sculptures of
such deities as Jupiter, and he mentions that he is being blackmailed,
having written love letters to Helene that were stolen and now are in
the possession of the blackmailer.</P>
<P>To pay off the blackmail ransom, Charles steals $25,000 from his
father's safe, making it look like a robbery. But the blackmailer calls
again, saying he has photostats of the original letters. This time
Helene pawns her diamond necklace, as Charles has the professor do the
actual pawning of it. This backfires, as Theo discovers that the
necklace is missing and reports that to the police. They bring the
pawnbroker to his house, where he identifies the professor as the one
who pawned it. Theo wants to know why, and the professor tells him to
ask his son. Charles gets angry with the professor for implicating him
in the theft and rebuffs the professor.</P>
<P>The film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological
spin it puts on the story. By coincidence, on the train back to Paris,
the professor overhears a little girl talk about God and the Ten
Commandments (the film takes its title by comparing the ten days leading
up to the main event in this story with the precepts found in the Ten
Commandments). The professor figures out that Theo is playing God; and,
by realizing his imperfections, jealousy overcomes him. Thereby, he
can't control his urge to destroy. But the professor arrives too late,
and a murder is committed to make it appear like a suicide, with the
intention of blaming all the robberies on the mentally disturbed
Charles.</P>
<P>This unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing, and at all times
tantalizing our sensiblities. It seems to want to question how deep our
faith is in God, which is a recurring theme in many Chabrol films. The
answers are skewed, as Chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the
rich can get away with anything, including murder. The professor, the
hero of the story, walks away from all this with a clear conscience. But
Theo remains Godlike, charming the public and buying them off with his
wealth, making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side.
This is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view
it than it does at first.</P>
