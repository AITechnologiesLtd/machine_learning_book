<PRE> The Peacemaker - A Real American Hero
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P> This anticipated inaugural film by the newly created Dreamworks SKG
 production company is not a tremendous offering given the hype that
 has preceded its release.  However, it accomplishes three improbable
 but ultimately satisfying things.  It re-energizes the somewhat
 stalled career of leading lady Nicole Kidman.  It gives George
 Clooney, that medical hearthrob from television's ER, a chance to
 really flex his cinematic muscles.  And, it refreshes an increasingly
 stale plotline of stolen nuclear weapons and America as the target.</P>
<P> As the crisis unfolds, we are introduced to Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole
 Kidman). As the acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling
 Group, she is the expert that's leading the investigation and the
 operation of recovering the stolen nuclear warheads.  With a PhD from
 Harvard under her belt, she is adamant about following rules and
 protocols, and is the perennial cautious planner that builds in
 contingencies for everything.  As she briefs the top brass on the
 intelligence that has been gathered so far, she is constantly
 interrupted by Thomas Devoe (George Clooney).  He is an intelligence
 officer with the U.S. Army's special forces who believes profiteers
 will sell these weapons to rogue governments.  Not the typical
 soldier, he is brash, bends rules, and takes great liberties to get
 what he wants including heavy bribes and savage in-your-face beatings.
 However, when it comes to things military, he is smart, clever, and a
 man of action.  He gets to the point and on people's nerves
 too...especially those of Dr. Kelly's.</P>
<P> It doesn't take a degree in nuclear physics to figure out that these
 two are eventually paired up by the powers that be to save the world.
 But fortunately, the writers are able to give us two likable
 characters that can overcome the cliches of hardened Russians,
 sophisticated spy satellites, and bombs with digital readouts.  The
 two work in unison to overcome their distaste for one another's
 personality and skillfully negotiate their way towards the location of
 the warheads.  But as with all bombs with digital readouts, the
 audience knows that time is running out for the heroes.</P>
<P> The Peacemaker, which was filmed in various locales around the world,
 evokes the look and feel of Tom Clancy's books-turned-movies.  A
 strong score helps to elevate the unfolding drama and the tension is
 constant throughout.  Clooney is perfectly cast as the virtuous and
 honorable military fighter.  He is macho.  He is action-hungry.  He is
 GI Joe.   Kidman also provides good balance as they race to save the
 world.  But despite the slick look of the movie and the constant level
 of excitement that is generated by the chase scenes, you'll come out
 with the feeling that most of what you saw was done in dozens of
 action movies in the recent past.  Also, at times the movie seems
 overly complicated as if simply adding more events and chases would
 somehow add to the film's weight.  Still, this kind of entertainment
 is scarce during the autumn, and you'll still be able to make peace
 with yourself for seeing it.</P>
