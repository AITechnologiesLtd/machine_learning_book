<P>Director Ted Demme chops together an exhaustive cast of big name
actors, a quaint little snowy New England town, and the follow-up
script of screenwriter extraordinaire Scott Rosenberg, whose first
screenplay turned into THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD (7/10).
Scott's pen was also the one behind CONAIR (6.5/10) and 1998's
DISTURBING BEHAVIOUR.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Willie (Hutton) returns to his childhood hometown when confronted with
a question mark as to the destination of his relationship with
lawyer-girlfriend Traci, and his piano-playing career. Once in town,
Willie mingles with all of his friends of old, who are also caught up
in various levels of commitment, and positions his glad-eye on one
particular thirteen-year old girl living next door. Twenty-somethings
confused about their place in life, their relationships, and the world,
is the basis of this human dramedy. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Richly penned script, strong acting performances, elegant
cinematography and a solid soundtrack, rate this film as one of the
best of its reflective kind. Solid character driven story in the spirit
of DINER (7/10) that simmers through the sorted lives of several
twenty-somethings caught up in a small town and various stages of
emotional and intellectual development. This movie lingers in
nostalgia, while simultaneously delivering several poignant points of
view from the grab-bag of interesting characters growing up amongst one
another this scanty little blue-collar town (Many of whom were
personally identifiable as well.)</P>
<P>Timothy Hutton shines as the pillar within the group of misguided
"adults" still caught up in their own adolescence, while Natalie
Portman delivers the most dead-on performance as the witty, charming,
and in my humble opinion, overly-literate 13-year old that you've ever
seen. I love the script in all other regards, but a couple of the
overly pretentious lines delivered by some of the characters (generally
Portman), prevented me from completely falling for this film which
touches most bases of relationships, and the fears of commitment. Why
do we always seem to think that there may be someone better for us out
there? Why can we not appreciate the people in our lives until it's too
late?</P>
<P>This movie does not have all the answers, but it does offer many
interesting observations, several classic scenes and funny moments, and
a solid cast of colorful characters interesting enough to keep you
engaged throughout its entire close to two-hour run. I also liked the
fact that the ending did not close or open all doors, and instead, left
you with a mixed sense of melancholic hope. Admittedly, not everyone
will be as interested in this film as I was. I am in my
twenty-somethings, and felt extremely in tune with most of the
characters' thoughts, feelings and trepidations. You might not. Then
again, if you've ever had a moment in your life when you felt like you
could "do better" than the person with whom you were presently engaged,
this movie is certainly one that'll further appetize your food for
ample thought. This film may have been a small movie set in a small
town, but its characters are earnest, its dialogue is smart and witty,
and most of all, its heart is anything but small.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about the film and its stars: 
Goof in film: When Sharon (Sorvino) is visiting Tommy (Dillon) in the
hospital, her lips don't move when she asks him how he is.
Director Ted Demme is the nephew of better known director, Jonathan
Demme. 
Stars Uma Thurman and Timothy Hutton were apparently heavily dating
during the filming of this movie (Is there anyone left in Hollywood
that hasn't taken a crack at Uma?). 
Timothy Hutton has a son Noah with his ex-wife, actress Debra Winger.
He also directed the music video "Drive" for the 1980's group The Cars.
Natalie Portman was born on the 9th of June, 1981, in Jerusalem,
Israel. She is a vegetarian, and was turned down for the role of Juliet
in the 1996 version of ROMEO AND JULIET (7/10): a part that eventually
went to Claire Danes.
Actor Max Perlich made his feature film debut as the "economics
student" in 1986's FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (7.5/10).
Writer Scott Rosenberg graduated from Boston University's College of
Communication.</P>
