<PRE>TOWN & COUNTRY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>"We've got a problem?" Porter Stoddard asks his wife Ellie.  "Which 
one?" she asks in reply.  Although she is asking him which color of 
swatch he prefers, this interchange could just have easily been said 
about Peter Chelsom's comedy TOWN & COUNTRY.  Before an orchestra 
starts, it carefully establishes a reference tone.  One of the biggest 
problems with TOWN & COUNTRY is that it never finds any consistent or 
successful tone.  The result is a dreadful comedy that's as flat as a 
can of soda left open all night.  </P>
<P>Wearing her signature nerdy and eclectic suits, Diane Keaton plays Diane 
Keaton, although the other characters insist on referring to her as 
Ellie Stoddard.  Warren Beatty plays Porter, Ellie's husband of 25 
years.  When we first meet Porter he is enjoying a personal cello 
concerto in his hotel bedroom.  A naked Nastassja Kinski has her cello 
in a bear hug.  The cello looks particularly happy.  Can't say that I 
blame it.  But, I digress.</P>
<P>It seems that this is the first time that Porter has ever cheated on his 
wife.  He swears to himself to never yield to such temptation again, but 
he, of course, does not keep this vow.  Before his wife can catch him, 
we switch to their equally wealthy Manhattan friends, Mona and Griffin 
(Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling), whose marriage is going through its 
own crisis since Griffin has been caught dallying.</P>
<P>The country part of the story comes from the decrepit mansions and snow 
cabins that the couples visit after their marriages go awry.  While in 
Sun Valley, the two guys off on their own run into a local (Jenna 
Elfman) who takes them to a Halloween party.  Elfman dresses as Marilyn 
Monroe on her visit to President Kennedy, Beatty dons a polar bear suit 
and Shandling wears an Elvis outfit.  The visuals of a tipsy Marilyn 
Monroe frolicking in the snow with a horny polar bear is one of the few 
memorable or even mildly amusing parts of the production.  (The less 
said about Charlton Heston's embarrassing role as a mad, gun-toting 
father, the better.)</P>
<P>The film has reportedly been recut several times in order to find some 
version that works.  The editors clearly stopped too soon.  They should 
have kept cutting until all that was left was confetti.  They could have 
used the confetti to celebrate something worthwhile like some better 
movie's release.</P>
<P>TOWN & COUNTRY runs 1:36.  It is rated R for sexuality and language and 
would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
