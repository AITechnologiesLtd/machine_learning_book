<PRE>`Gladiator' – Hail Caesar!
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>`Gladiator' is a story that roars one simple message. 
And that message is `Charge!'  This film steadily
rushes towards you like centurions on a chariot.  Fun
summer movies are about being visceral delights.  And
this one delivers.  Heroic in tone, epic in scope, and
far from bloodless, the summer's first
blockbuster-to-be is a grand tale of Rome,
retribution, and requital.  </P>
<P>The film opens with an ambitious battle sequence.  `At
my command, unleash Hell,' says the film's hero,
General Maximus (stately Russell Crowe).  Maximus
leads his legion of troops into battle, masterminding
an important victory for the glory of Rome.  His
continued leadership has brought him the admiration
and love of the current but aging Emperor, Marcus
Aurelius (regal Richard Harris).  A benevolent leader
with noble visions of Rome's future, his final hope is
for Maximus to succeed him when he dies.</P>
<P>This decision infuriates Aurelius's tempestuous son,
Commodus (darkly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). 
Consumed with jealousy, he attempts to destroy Maximus
and his family before ascending the throne himself. 
The crafty General manages to escape, but his family
is not as lucky.  </P>
<P>Stripped of everything he loves, he is captured by
slave traders and then subsequently sold to Proximo
(Oliver Reed), a businessman who specializes in
training Gladiators. In the training arena, Maximus
filets his opponents as easily as Japanese chefs filet
fish.  But he is also taught that he must win over the
crowd if he is to truly win the match.  </P>
<P>As a victorious and popular gladiator, he will travel
to Rome to perform in the Colosseum.  As a man with a
noble heart, his personal crusade is followed with
much interest.  As such, he garners support from
fellow gladiators (including Djimon Honsou), a former
love/Commodus's sister (Connie Nielsen), and a
civic-minded Senator (Derek Jacobi).   He looks for a
chance to avenge the death of his family, restore his
honor and posthumously bring forth the vision of
Emperor Aurelius.  </P>
<P>To enjoy `Gladiator' fully, find a big screen with a
good sound system.  There is an array of impressive
combat sequences with equally imposing sound effects. 
When you hear a battle axe being thrown, you might
want to look over your right shoulder just in case. 
Cinematography is also beautiful.  From its renderings
of ancient Rome to the way hues are incorporated into
scenes (for example, gray hues magnify the bleakness
of battle while rich amber hues reflect the lushness
enjoyed by the nobility), careful attention is taken
to immerse the audience in the movie-going experience.
 And the 165-minute saga of Maximus is stately and
absorbing.  Crowe is a gladiator's gladiator and he
brings depth and feeling to a new breed of action
heroes.</P>
<P>Yet, I have two reservations (no spoilers given).  The
first was that Commodus was seemingly baleful, but his
actions took a backseat to his psychotic personality. 
He was all talk but a man of little action.  When the
final showdown occurs, the audience doesn't view him
as much of a threat.  A greater reservation, however,
was the pace of the final act.  So much momentum was
building towards the finale that its ultimate
resolution seemed like an apology from the director
because they couldn't secure enough financing to
finish it with the same kind of epic battle that
catapulted its beginning. </P>
<P>But these are just minor points in an otherwise grand
story.  `Gladiator' is spectacular summer fare.  Its
tale is engaging, its presentation is bold, and it
certainly sets the bar for summer movies at a high
level.</P>
