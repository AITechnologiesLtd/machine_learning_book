<P>     I have a theory that, in an earlier stage of development, the premise
for A SIMPLE WISH went something like this:  Murray (Martin Short), who
aspires to being the first male fairy godmother, turns out to be
completely inept at the job, but an affirmative action mandate forces the
godmothers to admit him.  This would be before the real-world affirmative
action debate heated up, forcing controversy-shy Universal executives to
drop that angle entirely.</P>
<P>     The theory, I'll admit, is based on no evidence in the version of A
SIMPLE WISH which actually made it to the screen.  The alternative,
unfortunately, is that the story never made a shred of sense at _any_
point in its development.  It's the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy
where stuff just happens, without any character, story or internal logic
to guide it.</P>
<P>     Of course, the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young
viewers.  In the course of his repeatedly bungled attempts to help young
Anabel Greening (Mara Wilson) turn her father (Robert Pastorelli) into a
Broadway star, Murray gets caught in an iron gate, causes a wind storm to
sweep a teacher down a school hallway, turns a redneck into a 50 foot tall
rabbi, turns a horse into a mouse and has the father's chief rival begin
vomiting up frogs at an inopportune moment during his audition.
Meanwhile, evil excommunicated godmother Claudia (Kathleen Turner), who
has an axe to grind and magic wands to steal, has fun with computer
graphics, rendering folks either two-dimensional or extremely pliable 
depending on the whim which seizes her.</P>
<P>     The special effects are, admittedly, temporarily distracting.  When
they stop, however, A SIMPLE WISH borders on the unbearable.  Martin
Short, who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days,
turns Murray into a flinching, snorting and generally annoying creation
without a glimmer of charm.  Mara Wilson, who was so appealing in last
year's delightful MATILDA, barely registers here at all, while Francis
Capra registers far too often as Wilson's big brother.  There is not a
single likeable character in the film, turning every scene into a long
wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor.</P>
<P>     All of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film
all the more evident.  A SIMPLE WISH is based around a high-concept
premise -- a male fairy godmother, and an incompetent one at that -- yet
not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy
godmother, how he managed to become one, or why no one is keeping an eye
on him.  In fact, A SIMPLE WISH is comprised of nothing but missed
opportunities and half-developed ideas.  What goes on at the fairy
godmothers' convention which takes place during the film?  Does it matter
that Murray is using a broken wand for much of the film?  Why not make
more use of the complicated rules of fairy godmother-hood, which
apparently are so abstruse that Murray has to carry around a cheat sheet?
And why does Claudia's assistant Boots (Amanda Plummer), who is supposed
to be a dog turned into a human, look instead like a refugee from "Cats"?</P>
<P>     Time and again, A SIMPLE WISH wanders from scene to scene as though
blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point.  
Then again, maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point.
It's more charitable, I think, to imagine the darkly satirical film A
SIMPLE WISH might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned
out to be.</P>

<PRE>"'Elitist' [is] a word _meaningless_ in a profession that tries to seek
out and spotlight the best.  'Elite' is from the Old French root eslire,
to choose, and choosing is what a critic does for a living.  Calling a
critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist.'"
