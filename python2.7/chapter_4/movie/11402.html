<P>Advertisements for "U.S. Marshals" present the film as a sort-of sequel 
to "The Fugitive." Don't be fooled. "The Fugitive," while no masterpiece, 
was a taunt enough thriller, with a tight script and strong 
characterizations from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. "U.S. Marshals,
" on the other hand, is just another slam-bang chase movie, with lots of 
flashy action set pieces strung together with a script direct from Cliché 
Central.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones reprises his Oscar winning role as tough-as-nails, always-
gets-his-man Chief Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard. As in the first movie, 
Gerard and his plucky crew spend a couple of hours playing tag with an 
innocent man accused of murder. This time, former CIA operative Mark 
Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) is "It," racing about trying to prove that he 
was set up. Added to the mix is John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.,) a 
government agent assigned to "help" Gerard in his pursuit. That's about 
all there is to the plot. Basically, everyone chases each other from one 
action sequence to the next, while Jerry Goldsmith's yammering score 
underlines the tension we're supposed to feel. </P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones is a tremendous actor and Sam Gerard is a fascinating 
character, but "U.S. Marshal's" screenplay gives him nowhere to go 
dramatically and 133 tedious minutes to get there. In "The Fugitive," 
Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble, a doctor falsely convicted of murdering 
his wife, is thrown into a nightmarish situation and must rely on his 
wits to try and save himself. It's fascinating watching the interplay 
between Ford's desperate Everyman and Jones' relentless Gerard. </P>
<P>Compare that to Snipes' bland character here. Mark Sheridan was a secret 
agent. Avoiding capture was part of his job description, for Christ's 
sake, which lets a lot of air out of the dramatic balloon. Snipes doesn't 
help matters much, giving a flat, mechanical performance without a hint 
of nuance. It's hard to feel empathy for Snipes and difficult to be 
engaged by the spectacle of two professionals chasing each other around 
the country.</P>
<P>John Pogue's anemic script tries to build up Gerard's character by 
reminding us again and again that we're watching one tough bastard who 
will stop at nothing to snag his quarry. "Looks like Sam has used up 
eight of his nine lives," offers one of his crew. "Your reputation has 
preceded you," a Federal agent admires. When asked "Is this guy crazy?" a 
teammate replies "No, but he's a carrier." </P>
<P>Gerard appears quite comfortable with his newly bestowed superhero status.
 He struts around in front of dazzled locals, loudly exchanging strained 
banter with his rag-tag crew. In the first film, Gerard and company were 
a crack team. Here, they come off as smug and self-satisfied as the 
Ghostbusters in their prime. Of course, from the opening scene, which 
goes for an easy laugh by having Gerard race about in a chicken suit, 
it's obvious that Pogue has no intention of maintaining the character's 
integrity.</P>
<P>Women don't fare well in the film, either. Irene Jacob is wasted as 
Sheridan's vacuous girlfriend, serving no function other than to provide 
Starbucks with a whale of a product placement. Kate Nelligan pops in 
occassionally as Gerard's boss. It's obvious most of her scenes were left 
on the cutting room floor when she abruptly tells Gerard, "I love you, 
but that doesn't mean I won't fire you," leaving viewers to scratch their 
heads and go, "What? Who? Where?"</P>
<P>Structurally, the film is just a faded Xerox of "The Fugitive." Richard 
Kimble escaped from a spectacular train wreck. Mark Sheridan escapes from 
a spectacular plane crash (in a scene ripped off from "Con Air".) Kimble 
makes a spectacular leap off the edge of a dam. Sheridan makes a 
spectacular bungee leap off a building and onto a moving train. Sure, the 
crashes and stunts are nifty, but they aren't nifty enough to make up for 
cardboard characters and a plot straight out of "Rocky and Bullwinkle."</P>
<P>The film leaves more than a few nagging questions. Is there anyone in 
this story who isn't a master at picking locks? Are the filmmakers just 
fans of Buddy Guy's Legends nightclub and the Broadway hit "Rent," or did 
they have to pay for their product placements too? And most of all, why 
in the world does Gerard keep chasing Sheridan when he's clearly figured 
out that the guy has been framed? </P>
<P>Maybe he suffered memory loss, a delayed reaction from becoming 
overheated spending all those hours in a chicken suit. Or maybe he's just 
preoccupied, wondering how anyone could take a character as distinctive 
as Sam Gerard and stick him in a movie as half-assed as "U.S. Marshals." </P>
