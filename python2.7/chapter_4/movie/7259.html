<PRE>                                   SELENA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     The young Selena Quintanilla and her sister Suzette crawl on top
of the family's modest home.  Selena casts her eyes to the full moon
which engulfs the screen as Selena talks about her dreams.  Positioned
as a Mexican-American Horatio Alger story, the movie SELENA tells the
true story of a popular singer who was murdered in her mid-twenties.</P>
<P>     Although the film has a charismatic lead, Jennifer Lopez, in the
title role as the grownup Selena, the picture suffers from an overly
homogenized and sanitized approach.  Writer and director Gregory Nava
takes an all too reverential approach to the persona of Selena.  The
resulting film feels less like the story of a flesh-and-blood star,
than an idealized biography that a fan club might produce.  The film
has all of the high spirits and the depth of one of the old GIDGET
movies.</P>
<P>     All of this notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed Lopez's
performance.  You may remember Lopez from her last role as the Cuban
nanny in BLOOD AND WINE.  In that movie, her part consisted of walking
around looking sexy.  In SELENA she owns the show with her
luminescence.</P>
<P>     The film starts in 1995 with Selena riding into the Astrodome on a
horse drawn carriage as her fans go wild.  As she sings, the camera
dwells on her fans as the spotlights pan through the audience.
Although there are numerous songs in the movie, Edward Lachman's glitzy
cinematography and Nancy Richardson's fast editing concentrate on flash
and dazzle.  Why Selena became such a Tejano music star, we never find
out.  Whether because the songs are filmed in such a distracting way or
because the ones they chose for the film are not Selena's best, the
film shows us a high energy entertainer whose singing can best be
described as, well, pleasant.</P>
<P>     The undercurrent of the movie has to do with the struggles of
being Mexican-American.  After the scene of the idolatrous fans in the
Astrodome, the movie flashes back to Corpus Christi, Texas in 1961
where Selena's father Abraham is part of a trio of Mexican-American
singers who are practicing "Blue Moon."  They discover the inherent
conundrum of being Mexican-Americans who sing Gringo music.  Both races
reject the group for racist reasons.</P>
<P>     The show makes another jump to Lake Jackson, Texas in 1981 where
Abraham (Edward James Olmos) lives with his wife Marcella (Constance
Marie) and their kids.  Abraham is the proverbial dreamer who is
counterbalanced by his ever logical wife.  He wants the moon, but she
worries about the mortgage.  Both characters stay in pure formula
territory.  With Dave Grusin's dreamy background music, the film comes
near to lapsing into a fairy tale.</P>
<P>     When Abraham realizes that young Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) has a
remarkable voice, he makes her stop playing kid games in the backyard
and start practicing her singing.  He forces her siblings to be her
musical accompanists.  None of the kids are wild about the idea, but
Abraham is one of those old school fathers.  He commands; the kids
jump.  But, Olmos gives us a stage-father with a heart as well as a
dictator.</P>
<P>     The show skips again to El Paso, Texas in 1989 where Selena's
popularity now extends to small crowds at county fairs.  Her dad is
scandalized when Selena takes off her top and flaunts her body in a
Madonna-style bustier.  (Actually, Selena could have become rich
through diet books if the story is accurate.  Although her father and
sister are chubby, Selena brags that she lives exclusively on junk
food, especially pepperoni pizza, but her svelte figure is the sort
teenage girls dream about.)</P>
<P>     Her $600 per show makes for a meager existence for her family.
Abraham drives a bus, and Selena and the band live in it from gig to
gig.  Sometimes they stop to spend the night at fleabag motels with
signs proclaiming "Direct Dial Phones" as their chief amenity.</P>
<P>     One day, they sign a guitarist named Chris Perez (Jon Seda) from a
heavy metal band.  Although he looks like the character than may
provide some creative tension in the film, he turns out to be as sweet
as the rest of the family.  He does have one funny little habit.  He
wears a holster that is custom-made to hold a small bottle of hot
sauce.  When he takes Selena out for pizza, he draws and twirls the
bottle like a gun and shoots the sauce, thereby drowning his pizza in
it.</P>
<P>     With the exception of Tejano music fans, most of us probably first
heard about Selena when she was murdered, but the film treats the event
with all of the importance of an epilogue.  As the film is winding
down, she is suddenly killed, and the story ends shortly thereafter.
It is as if the movie does not want to destroy its nostalgic ambiance
with the brutality of real life.  Even the cinematographic techniques
change at the end with her murder being revealed in a brief and flashy
montage.</P>
<P>     Although the show has merit and Lopez delivers a remarkably
compelling and extremely likable performance, the picture suffers from
terminal blandness and leaves too many questions unanswered.  We learn
just enough about Selena to want to know more.</P>
<P>     SELENA runs much too long at 2:10.  It is rated PG for some mild
profanity and the off-screen murder.  The film would be fine for kids
of any age, but those under ten would probably be interested only if
they are Selena fans.  Lopez's delightful performance is enough for me
to be able to recommend the picture and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
