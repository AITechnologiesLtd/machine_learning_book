<P>On the surface, a teen version of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" sounds
like it might be workable. After all, Hollywood managed to transplant
Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" to Los Angeles and sell it as "City of
Angels," so why shouldn't writer-director Roger Kumble take a crack at
reconstructing Choderlos De Laclos' tale of romantic intrigue in
modern-day Manhattan?</P>
<P>"Cruel Intentions" offers 97 minutes worth of good reasons why
not. Though glossy in the extreme and occasionally imaginative, the
movie never gets past a crucial structural flaw: Behavior that would
have scandalized pre-Revolutionary France would scarcely raise an
eyebrow among today's drug-dazed and sex-crazed Upper East Side
crowd. So right off thebat, "Intentions" is in trouble.</P>
<P>Matters aren't helped by the casting of the colorless Ryan Phillippe
as Sebastian, this version's equivalent of Valmont. In "Dangerous
Liaisons," director Stephen Frears' acclaimed 1988 film based on De
Laclos' novel, John Malkovich's Valmont was the personification of
passionless sexuality; when he spoke, it sounded as if there were
icicles in between each word.  That Phillippe has studied Malkovich's
portrayal is clearly evident in his attempts to duplicate that sort of
eerie diction, but Phillippe's unfortunate tendency to fall back on
poses and pouts flattens his performance.</P>
<P>Sarah Michelle Gellar, obviously drawing on her years of playing the
bad seed on "All My Children," vamps through the Merteuil role with a
certain amount of style, although the script gives the character very
little backstory.  Screenwriter Christopher Hampton's "Liaisons"
presented Merteuil's devious games as a sort of twisted
feminism. Kumble simply sees her as a two-faced tramp.</P>
<P>"Intentions" pairs wealthy reprobates Catherine (Gellar) and Sebastian
as stepsiblings who plot the downfalls of graceless Cecile (Selma
Blair) and angelic Annette (Reese Witherspoon, who far outclasses her
part), an ingenue from Kansas City who trumpets her virginity in
interviews the way Brooke Shields used to do. Seduction, drugs and
homosexuality figure into the course of events, but, like the virtuous
Annette, "Intentions" is all tease and no action. There was more
nudity in "Dangerous Liaisons" and you'd find more eroticism in the
average "Dawson's Creek" episode.</P>
<P>Perhaps we'd find more exciting material on the cutting room floor,
since it appears "Intentions" underwent some kind of last-minute
hatchet job; for better or for worse, Joshua Jackson, Christine
Baranski and Sean Patrick Thomas barely show up before they disappear,
never to be seen again.</P>
