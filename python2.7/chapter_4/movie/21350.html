Susan Granger's review of "THE APARTMENT COMPLEX" (SHOWTIME TV)</PRE>
<P> On Sunday, October 31, at 8 PM on Showtime TV, horror maestro
Tobe Hooper presents a quirky, psychological mystery, "The Apartment
Complex," starring Chad Lowe as a young grad student who has just
moved from the Midwest to study psychology at UCLA. Broke and living
out of his car, he's hired by Jon Polito, as the malevolent
Dr. Caligari, to manage the Wonder View Apartments in Hollywood in
exchange for rent, despite warnings from Obba Babatunde, playing a
homeless philosopher who lurks on the front curb. Inspired more by
Stephen King than Frank Lloyd Wright, there's something very strange
about the Wonder View Apartments. Certainly the tenants are an oddball
assortment of neurotics and psychotics, ideal specimens for a master
thesis on abnormal psychology. There's Faye Masterson, a
haunted-looking beauty with her hot-tempered, insanely jealous
boyfriend, Patrick Warburton; Amanda Plummer, an over-sexed psychic;
Tyra Banks and Gina Mari, stunt actresses who dabble in martial arts;
R. Lee Ermey, a paranoid, reclusive ex-government agent; creepy twins
Jimmy and David Schuelke; and Charles Martin Smith as the agoraphobic
with a dark, terrible secret. The horror starts when Lowe discovers a
dead body in the murky swimming pool. Detectives Ron Canada and Miguel
Sandoval figure he's their only suspect, tormenting and bullying him
as other strange events plague the tenants. All the psycho-babble he's
been learning in grad school comes in handy as the
wise-beyond-his-years student begins doling out free therapy as he
zeros in on the real killer. On the Granger Made-for-Television Gauge,
"The Apartment Complex" is a sinister 6.  It's Halloween hell in
exchange for free rent.</P>
