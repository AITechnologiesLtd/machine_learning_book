<P>One could say that romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, and yet, they never 
truly grow old, even when the workings of the plot, and the machinations of 
the romance, are fairly run-of-the-mill. Most people, male and female, 
whether they will admit it or not, gain a certain pleasure by watching 
characters fall in love on the silver screen. There are certain ingredients, 
however, that are vital to the making of a winning romance: the couple must 
be charming and have chemistry together, the writing sharp, the love story 
believable, and the film must create an urge among the audience to see the 
inevitable happen. </P>
<P>"Return to Me," comedian-actress Bonnie Hunt's directorial debut (she also 
stars), has most of these assets--its two central stars, David Duchovny and 
Minnie Driver, are delightful here; the screenplay has quite a few very funny 
moments; and the whole package has such an innocence about it that to say it 
isn't a good movie, I fear, may cause me to appear to be a grump. But the 
picture does, unfortunately, have several problems that often shields its 
central romance from being in the forefront of the action onscreen, and 
somehow amidst it all, the magic is lost by the final fifteen minutes. Oh, 
yeah; if there's one thing a romance needs to have, it's a satisfying, 
entertaining conclusion, and "Return to Me" is absent of such a quality that 
might have boasted it over into the category of a surefire success.</P>
<P>Set in Chicago, the film begins as Bob and Liz Rueland (David Duchovny, Joely 
Richardson), a happily married couple, are attending a fundraising event for 
the Lincoln Park Zoo, where Liz, who has a great love and compassion for 
animals, works. On the way home, there is an automobile accident and Liz 
passes away, to the absolute devastation of Bob. Meanwhile, also at the 
hospital, is Grace (Minnie Driver), a young woman who is on her death 
bed--either she finds a heart and has a transplant to save her life, or she 
will die. She gets one at the last minute, and one year later, has fully 
recovered to go about her life like any other healthy person, but with a 
noticeable scar running down her chest that forever reminds her of how 
thankful she always should be to be alive.</P>
<P>One evening, after Bob is convinced into getting out of his house and joining 
his friend (David Alan Grier) on a double date to "O'Reilly's Italian 
Restaurant," he is absolutely smitten with their lovely waitress, who happens 
to be Grace, and whose caring grandfather (Carroll O'Connor) owns the place. 
After returning later that evening to pick up his cell phone, which he 
accidentally left there, he runs into Grace again, and after talking, Bob 
takes the next step into getting on with his life--he asks her out on a date. 
Grace joyfully accepts (she hasn't had too many dates in her life, and is 
insecure about how her possible suitors will react when she tells them she 
has had a heart transplant). From there, a relationship blossoms, with 
neither knowing about their true fateful connection. Through a series of 
circumstances, Grace makes the discovery, but fears that if she tells Bob 
about his deceased wife's heart beating within her body, she may lose him 
forever.</P>
<P>The premise of "Return to Me" may be farfetched (how likely do you really 
think it would be that a donor's husband would unexpectedly run into the 
patient whose life was saved?), and the developments in the story easily 
telegraphed from beginning to end, but one shouldn't go to a film of this 
type looking for such things. As long as you believe in the characters, it 
shouldn't be a problem. In the case of Bob and Grace, both are likable, 
realistically drawn people who clearly deserve their happiness. While they do 
not meet until the second half of the first hour, their scenes together are 
nicely done, and credit director Bonnie Hunt for being an assured filmmaker. 
"Return to Me" is fluffy--perhaps too fluffy--and it certainly won't be 
mistaken as the work of someone who has been in the directing business for 
long, but Hunt gets the job done.</P>
<P>Since her first role in 1995's "Circle of Friends," Minnie Driver has done 
nothing but impress with each of her film appearances, so her work here is 
not so much of a shock. Like Grace, she is absolutely enchanting. What does 
surprise is David Duchovny's standout performance. Viewed almost solely as 
Mulder on TV's "The X-Files," Duchovny takes the role of Bob, someone clearly 
different from his small screen persona, and proves that he very well has 
what it takes to be a perfectly respectable leading man. In the early scenes, 
after Liz has died, Duchovny heartbreakingly brings across the true loss of a 
loved one, and in the second half, proves that he also has nice comic timing, 
as does everyone else here. Bonnie Hunt, especially, as Grace's best friend 
Megan, is hysterically funny with her on-target delivery of her lines. James 
Belushi ably supports Hunt as her nice-guy lug of a husband.</P>
<P>Where "Return to Me" falters is in a few of its technical choices, such as 
the old-fashioned, self-titled song, by Dean Martin, annoyingly placed in 
several scenes, including a key dramatic moment, and in its handling of the 
supporting characters in relation to the romance. Hunt has littered her film 
with so many attention-getting inhabitants that their quirkiness threatens to 
drown out the central storyline. While the entire cast is very good, it is 
Bob and Grace who should be the focus, but so much attention is made to 
everyone else that they occasionally take away precious screen time in which 
the romantic developments between the two could be strengthened.</P>
<P>While "Return to Me" plays out, you are not bored, but you also are not as 
satisfied as you could be, because its presentation, aside from the 
aforementioned dealing of the death of Bob's wife, is so soft-focused and 
lacks urgency. And just when you think the movie is over, things come to a 
sudden halt and the epilogue drags on for another fifteen minutes, leading up 
to very little that couldn't have been solved with some tighter editing. As a 
romance, "Return to Me" is mildly engaging, but severely uneven. Some parts 
practically scream for the cutting room floor, while the love story seems 
undernourished. There is a lot of promise with what there is of it, but not 
enough to support the needless excess that revolves around them.</P>
