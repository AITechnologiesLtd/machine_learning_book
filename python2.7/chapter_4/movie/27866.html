<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A fairly routine contemporary Western, which was originally shot in 3-D,
but was later re-released without that gimmick. If you ever wanted to
see both a rodeo and a movie together, now is your chance. Under Richard
Fleischer's capable direction, the film does a marvelous job of
capturing the realistic flavor of being around rodeo performers. But the
love story is rather sappy, and the point about how dangerous the rodeo
is, especially for those who get older and can't stop performing, seemed
too melodramatic. Nevertheless, the film thrived on the very good
performances by Gig Young and the supporting cast, especially by Harry
Morgan. It was able to film an entire rodeo event in Tuscon, Arizona, in
almost real time. It is basically a soap-opera version of Nicholas Ray's
much superior "The Lusty Men" (1952).</P>
<P>Hob Danvers (Gig Young) is at his peak as a rodeo rider and is arrogant
about it. His marriage to nice girl Ruth (Polly) is on the rocks, not
seeing her for the past 2 years. He arrives at the Tuscon Rodeo with his
new flame, the sexy and grasping Sylvia (Lawrence), and meets his old
mentor Lew Hutchins (Harry Morgan) and his wife Meg (Hagen) and
impressionable young son Teddy (Aakers), after losing contact with them
over the last few years. He is surprised that Lew, once a top rider, is
now reduced to being a clown on the circuit.</P>
<P>There is good comraderie among the riders, featuring friendly rivalries,
but there are also occasions for spats. In one such incident, two
cowboys fight over one of them bad-mouthing him to his sister, whom he
was going out with. Hob is in a friendly rivalry with an up-and-coming
champion rider, the young Jackie Roach (Horton), who is destined to be
the next Hob Danvers. Jackie's sidekick is Smitty (Lee Van Cleef), a
tough cowboy who is injury prone and re-injures himself after a spill on
a bronco ride, which forces him to miss the rodeo and stops him from
earning a paycheck.</P>
<P>The hardships of the job, are highlighted by how dangerous their work is
and how all their pay is contingent on them winning prize money. They
must pay all their own expenses and even put up an entrance fee to
compete.</P>
<P>Polly comes from her home in Phoenix to see if there is anything left in
their marriage, as she still loves him, but she wants him to retire
before he gets hurt and to settle down on a ranch and raise a family, or
else she seeks a divorce. But, at the present time, Sylvia is the siren
that rings loudest for Hob.</P>
<P>Meg and Lew intervene on Polly's behalf and try to bring the two
together, showing a contempt for the loose-living Sylvia. It all comes
to a head, when Lew sacrifices his life to save Hob from being gored by
the notorious Brahma bull that has killed three cowboys already. Hob
realizes what Lew did for him and sees himself becoming like Lew in a
few years, growing old and losing his dignity in the arena, as he
decides to stay with Ruth, coming, at last, to his senses.</P>
