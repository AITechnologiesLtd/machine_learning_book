<P>SPECIAL NOTE:  Longtime readers will realize that I am breaking with a
longstanding tradition of reviewing only theatrical films.  There is a
very good reason.  Please note the air times listed above and don't miss
this one.</P>
<P>     The best documentaries, like the best art of any kind, have always
been about more than their easily-summarized subject.  HOOP DREAMS may
have been about high school basketball, but it was also about race, class
and the cultural deification of athletics.  Great documentary film-makers
take individual lives and find stories that resonate beyond the
individuals whose lives are being explored.</P>
<P>     HITMAN HART: WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS is set in the world of
professional wrestling, and shame on you if that's enough to keep you from
watching.  Paul Jay's documentary is a brilliant, riveting, touching and
funny biographical study of a man who happens to be a professional
wrestler:  Calgary native Bret "The Hitman" Hart, a 40-year-old, 14-year
veteran of the World Wrestling Federation and heavyweight champion crowd
favorite when we meet him.  Actually, "happens to be a wrestler" may be an
understatement.  In fact, Bret Hart's entire universe is wrestling -- his
father Stu was a pro wrestler and promoter, his seven brothers also became
wrestlers, and his four sisters all married wrestlers.  In interviews with
family members, we see how Stu's old-school style -- twisting opponents
into excruciating submission holds until blood vessels burst in their eyes
-- came to define not just Bret's wrestling persona, but his entire view
of integrity via his relationship with his father.  Manhood meant no
compromise and no submission, inside the ring or out of it.</P>
<P>    This background provides a crucial context for the central story of
Bret's fall from grace within the WWF.  He describes how his virtuous,
heroic Hitman character became passe as anti-heroes like Stone Cold Steve
Austin grew in popularity, leading WWF owner Vince McMahon to engineer
Bret's shift from "good guy" to "bad guy."  Yet even in that role Bret was
able to remain true to himself, becoming a Canadian patriot who criticized
the moral collapse of American society.  Unfortunately, he extended that
criticism to the WWF itself, arguing that the family entertainment
morality plays of the 1980s glory days -- Hulk Hogan urging kids to "say
their prayers and take their vitamins" -- had given way to increasing
vulgarity and the glorification of villains.  And McMahon, needless to
say, was not pleased.</P>
<P>     That conflict sets up a climactic showdown in Montreal between Bret
and the WWF's reigning glamour boy, Shawn Michaels.  Facing the end of his
contract with the WWF -- perhaps due to financial pressure from Ted
Turner's competing WCW, perhaps due to more personal issues -- Bret is
asked to lose the championship match in Canada.  The circumstances leading
up to that request, including Bret's refusal of a sizable raise to jump
ship to the WCW only months earlier out of loyalty to McMahon, leads Bret
to hope there is some way he can leave his home country a winner.  What
follows is as tense and dramatic as any confrontation in any fictional
sports film, this in a "sport" where the outcome is carefully
choreographed ahead of time.  </P>
<P>     Viewers expecting HITMAN HART: WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS to be a
behind-the-scenes expose of the "phony" wrestling world will find that,
but only to a certain extent.  They'll also find a man named Bret Hart who
made the tragic mistake of attaching his identity to a fictional construct
in a multi-million dollar business.  As clearly as Vince McMahon is the
villain of this piece, he also makes one extremely insightful comment
about Bret Hart:  "He forgot that this is sports entertainment."  HITMAN
HART: WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS is a tale of capitalism and personal
integrity, and the extent to which one has anything to do with the other.
It's a human drama, a social satire and a thrilling adventure.  And it is
not, repeat, _not_ "just about wrestling."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 broken Harts:  10.</PRE>
