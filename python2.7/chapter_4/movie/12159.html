Re- Ten movies that helped shape my life: #3</P>
<P>One at a time, in the weeks ahead, I'll list here the ten films
 that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite films. They
 are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest influence 
on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are favorites that 
I enjoy watching over and over again, which you can tell as you
 read each entry. Try to think of your own experiences with film
s and how they influenced the course of your life. It makes life
 more interesting to be aware, as you live it, to know how 
things such as books and films and magazine articles alter your
 path in significant ways. Sometime last year the Sunday NYTimes
 "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how difficult it is 
to think of a movie that may have changed history. The only 
movie they could think of was a silent film by D.W. Griffith, 
Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the KuKluxKlan that 
the author believes changed national thinking about the KKK. 
How silly. Each of the ten films listed here changed my history,
 and if I had not seen them, I would not have helped change 
history in the ways that I have. Films don't move masses. They 
move individuals who move masses.</P>
<P>3. "An American in Paris." (1951) There is no motion picture 
I've watched more than this MGM classic musical, easily a 
hundred times without exaggeration. Gene Kelly and Leslie 
Caron in a love story that made me dizzy when I first saw it 
in raging adolescence (15). The music is George Gershwin, my 
entry point to classical music. If I had to have one movie on a
 desert island, this would be it. It is flawless. There is no 
scene in it that is less than the others, no number I can 
decide is my favorite of all. Oscar Levant is priceless in a 
supporting role. George Guetary's "I'll Build a Stairway to 
Paradise," stoked my raging adolescence with every step. Gene 
Kelly plays a GI who stayed in Paris after the war to learn how
 to paint. When he sees Leslie Caron in a smoky nightclub, he is
 hit by the old lightning bolt, and pursues her until the 
movie's glorious finish. When she asks why, if he says he is 
such a great artist, he is not famous, he asks her to be 
patient. "Civilization," he says, "has a natural resistance to 
improving itself." In the years that followed, whenever I've 
been discouraged about my progress in moving the world in the 
direction I wish it to go, I think of that line and why it must
 be so. </P>
