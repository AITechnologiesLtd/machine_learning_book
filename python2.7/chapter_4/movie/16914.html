<PRE>ANALYZE THIS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>With its fondness for slick Armani wardrobes, Caddies with ample trunk 
space, and Italian family restaurants, the Mob is a prime target for 
parody.  Filmmakers willing to make a mockery of organized crime have a 
relatively easy task, but it takes a certain skill to rise above the 
ordinary.</P>
<P>Recently, "Jane Austen's Mafia!" used the gag-a-minute technique (first 
unleashed on the unsuspecting public in "Airplane!" by the team of 
Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker) to lampoon "The Godfather" and its many 
cinematic wannabes.  In "Analyze This," director Harold Ramis 
("Groundhog Day") and his screenwriters have found their own secret 
weapon to ridicule the Mafiosi in Robert De Niro.</P>
<P>De Niro, himself an alumnus of the influential "Godfather" series, has 
played a mobster on innumerable occasions.  Yet with "Analyze This," 
Hollywood's most prolific of actors proves that, even after all these 
years, he's still capable of something a little different.</P>
<P>De Niro plays mob boss Paul Vitti and at times in the film you'd swear 
you were watching a sequel to "Goodfellas": De Niro is unsparing in his 
portrayal of a ruthless, tough-as-nails gangster, from his dress sense, 
to his Brooklyn patois, to his everyday behavior (not all of it good).  
But Vitti has a problem.  He's starting to go soft.  He worries a lot, 
and is experiencing these so-called panic attacks.  Oh, and he bursts 
into tears at the slightest provocation.  Not something someone in his 
profession would be wise to admit.</P>
<P>But when he does confess to needing help to his bodyguard, the 
terrifically dumb Jelly (Joe Viterelli) just happens to be carrying an 
appropriate business card.  Earlier that evening psychiatrist Ben Sobol 
(Billy Crystal) rear-ended Jelly's limo and was quick to provide 
insurance information.</P>
<P>Vitti meets "da shrink" and realizes, much to Sobol's chagrin, that 
he's the man to solve all his problems.  Soon to be married (to 
"Friends"' Lisa Kudrow, who fails to add much to the proceedings), Sobol 
tries valiantly to sever his blossoming relationship with Vitti, but 
instead succeeds in winning the confidence of the uncompromising 
mobster.  Winning in the sense of:</P>
<P>Vitti: "Do you know who I am?"
Sobol: "Yes."
Vitti: "No you don't."
Sobol: "No I don't."
Vitti, sporting De Niro's knowing wink and pointing an appreciative 
finger at his analyst: "You...  You...  You're good."
Sobol: "Well, I wouldn't..."
Vitti (voice raised threateningly): "You're good!"</P>
<P>Crystal *is* good, but he's a comedian first and an actor second, which 
causes him to exhibit some annoying smirkiness in "serious" scenes.  De 
Niro, on the other hand, is an extraordinarily versatile actor who can 
nail comedic roles, and that's the significant difference between the 
two performers.  The script does require Crystal's character to stand in 
for De Niro's during the big meeting of the mobs, thus allowing Crystal 
to deliver his virtuoso gangsta shtick in the face of Vitti's rival, 
played with well-dressed menace to society by Chazz Palminteri.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film's subject matter necessitates some large doses 
of violence in and amongst the couch trips, but De Niro and Crystal work 
so well together that the inevitable whackings seem almost forgivable in 
context.</P>
<P>A slightly bent cross between "Midnight Run" and "What About Bob?," 
"Analyze This" is a successful product of casting.  The movie 
overreaches its conventional "*You* try telling him his 50 minutes are 
up" promotional campaign by delivering two deft, on-the-money 
performances that bring down the house.  Crystal is good, and De Niro is 
even better.</P>
