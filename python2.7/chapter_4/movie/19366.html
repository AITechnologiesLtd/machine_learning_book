<P>After their magnifficent debut with "Bound", the Wachowski-brothers have
returned to the screens with one of the most interesting, mind-bending,
original and captivating science fiction films of the past decade. So far
the best film of 1999, "The Matrix"  intellectually toys with dream and
reality, fantasy and nightmare, destiny and fate with such energy that it
will blow your away.</P>
<P>Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a respected citizen of our comunity. He
works for a "..respectible software company,  pays our taxes and helps the
landlady to carry out her carbage..". But this is only one of his lives. In
his second life he is Neo a hacker that during night is breaking the law,
desperatly trying to find an answer to the question he can't find words for.
He is then contacted by a mysterious stranger that calles himself Morpheous
(Laurence Fishburne) who tells him about the Matrix - "..the world pulled
over our eyes to blind us from the truth..".
Neo is then offered a choice between ignorance - waking up in his bed in the
morning and continue to live his normal life..or he can step into the real
world, from which there is no turning back. Neo choses that truth and the
real world he discovers is horrifieng and alien, controlled bu
super-intelligent machines that
use us a bio-power sourse vital for their survivial. It is no longer 1999
it's closer to 2199. The frightening truth is that somewhere in the real
past and our future mankind celebrated the discovery of A.I. (Artificial
Intelligence). The machines that could think for themselves was going to
make our lives easier. But at the same time we were getting more and more
dependant on the machines - the machines evolved, prospered and formed their
bizzarre society. There was a war, it is uncertain who began, but we were
losing. Our last attempt to save ourselves was to reflect the sunlight from
the earth. We belived that since the machines were dependant on solar power,
they would not survive and the mankind could be safe deep under ground, near
the center of our planet where it's still warm. But the machines outsmarted
us again, a human body can produce more bio-power than a 120 V - battery. So
we are no longer born, we are grown like corn in the field. To keep us i
total control the machines have created a dream world for us, as it was in
1990-s, by sending certain electrical signals to our brain. Matrix can be
compared to a very big and complex computer game and we are the unknowing
players, born with a VR-mask on our face. Ironicly the humans and the
machines have changed places. We think that we live out our lives, when we
actually lieng helplessly inside an incubator as batteries for the machines.
Morpheous belives that Neo is the long expected Messias that can save the
world.</P>
<P>Although the film is a bit confusing at the beginning, the Wachowski
brothers revealing the big secrets pieace by piece, never leave you
completely lost in space. The script, although energic and full of action,
humour, betrayel and even romance is very gently and intelligently structed,
which is rare for science fiction films nowadays.</P>
<P>The casting is flawless;Keanu Reeves is again back on top after severel
flops and failures and is as effective as he could be in the part of
Neo.Laurence Fishburne is convincing as always as the mystifying Morpheous.
Another vital carector that is very important to the story is Cypher,
wonderfully played by Joe Pantoliano . He is the human element in the film,
willing to do anything for getting back his ignorance and return to Matrix.
Cypher rases many moral questions, such as "what is better living in total
ignorance and happiness as a slave or living freedome in misury and horror?"
Joe Pantoliano delivers in my oppinion the strongest performance in the
film, bringing in the comic as well as moral issues into the picture.
Carrie-Anne Moss is clever and voulnerble as Trinity and Hugo Weaving is
sinister, intelligent and calm as the leader-agent.</P>
<P>Behind the brilliant special effects, wonderful cinematography and solid
acting the Wachowski brothers display many important issues for us to think
about. "The Matrix" shows us the real world as a result of our many
discoverys, so the real villains the films are not the machines, but their
creators - us. When the machines tried to classify the human species they
classified us not as mammals, but as a virus, the cancer of this planet and
they are - the cure.</P>
