<PRE>THE SON'S ROOM
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>For those who associate Italian cinema with Fellini and "high art," The
Son's Room is an inventive, subtle alternative.  Written by, directed,
and starring Nanni Moretti, it takes us through the slow, complicated
path of bereavement.</P>
<P>Slow is the best description for the film at first.  It takes its time
in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal, happy
family.  Father and mother both work but still find the time to support
their son and daughter through homework and after school activities. 
They laugh, spend free time together, and reprimand the kids for
innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder.  You get the
feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the
foursome.</P>
<P>But suddenly, the son is found to be dead after a diving accident.  The
family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative
strength when you least expect it, but can also be trying on the
attention span.  Though the film drags and even repeats itself, this can
be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving.</P>
<P>Though Nanni Moretti wore several hats for this production, it doesn't
come across as a vanity piece.  One might wish he hadn't picked the
profession of analyst for the father, Giovanni (which he stars as), if
only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable.  What
saves it is a well written script, with spare dialogue and an eclectic
variety of human interaction.</P>
<P>The potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of
everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative, or that
remind a depressed person of loss.  You start to take notice of the
cracked dishes, ignored when familial bliss was in full swing.  You
remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block, and not
necessarily huge events like graduation.</P>
<P>Even better are the role reversals that take place within the
household.  While Giovanni and Paola (Laura Morante) do check up on
their daughter Irene (Jasmine Trinca), there is a sense of being on
autopilot.  Not only does Irene begin to take care of her own needs
more, she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new
shells to life around them.  These scenes provide interesting portrayals
of various coping mechanisms, frequently crossing a boundary as to how
much you can help yourself versus others during drastic, unexpected
change.</P>
<P>Respectfully, gender issues never enter the picture.  Self-propelled
isolation is universal in terms of dealing, so Moretti intelligently
uses this tool to separate the family.  Though Giovanni does stop Paolo
from discussing Andrea at a party with friends, there is never a sense
that he or she is more stoic, or more correct in the search to restore a
sense of a balance to their lives.</P>
<P>Most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama,
speeches, and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing.  In
contrast, The Son's Room captures a more realistic depiction of the
effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages
of mourning (denial, depression, anger, bargaining, acceptance) through
each of its main characters.  It's not the most engaging 100 minutes,
but it is certainly easy to relate to.</P>
