<P>So few movies are being released - and so few of those are for kids - that 
Muppets From Space will have an audience, and may even turn a profit for its 
makers.  It's a perfectly enjoyable little movie, though at best it has the 
quality of a television special.</P>
<P>The opening is fine:  we see Gonzo (voice of  Dave Goelz) being refused a 
place on the ark by Noah himself (a cameo by F. Murray Abraham).  You see, 
there's only one of Gonzo, a joke with which all Muppet fans are familiar.  
But is he alone?</P>
<P>The film clicks early with a gathering of all the Muppets, who inexplicably 
seem to live together in an enormous house.  Reminiscent of the best 
ensemble shots from 'The Muppet Show,' this segment is directed well, 
assisted by catchy music.  We glance all of the mainstays - Miss Piggy and 
Animal and Fozzie Bear (Frank Oz), Kermit the Frog and Rizzo the Rat (Steve 
Whitmire)  -- along with the charming little bug-eyed Pepe the Prawn (Bill 
Barretta).  Many other recognizable Muppets do their stuff as well.  (It's 
hard not to belly-laugh at the sheep and penguins!)</P>
<P>Gonzo - apparently very old but a friend to these contemporary Muppets - is 
pouring his breakfast cereal when some of the spilled letters arrange 
themselves to read "Watch the Sky," followed by "R U There."  Soon Gonzo is 
struck by something like lightning, and experiences a vision in which he is 
flying, unassisted, through space;  two Cosmic Fish tell him that he is an 
alien, and he should await the return his fellow hook-nosed aliens, who left 
him behind ages ago.</P>
<P>All this is complicated by a plot involving a government conspiracy.  (Do 
the threads of the narrative sound familiar?)  Jeffrey Tambor plays K. Edgar 
Singer (c'mon - the name's not even cute!), an executive in an FBI-like 
operation.  He has been charged by his boss, a general played by the 
venerable character actor Pat Hingle, to produce an alien.  By roundabout 
ways, Singer (known as 'Ed') discovers Gonzo's alleged identity, and 
attempts to chase him down.</P>
<P>Really the film tries to do too much:  its science fiction elements do not 
blend well with the spy flavor.  Although there are spaceships and other 
fantastic items, there is also the Bondian device of weapons and fancy toys 
explained to the main Muppets - toys invariably used later on.  Too, the 
film is mis-named:  most of the action takes place on Earth.</P>
<P>Himself a distinguished character actor, Jeffrey Tambor here plays it too 
straight.  A little over-the-top never hurt any performance in a Muppet 
movie.  Roll or cross your eyes once in awhile, will you?  Several other 
live actors do cameos, and most are worthy of a chuckle.  Kathy Griffin is 
perhaps the funniest, in her role as an over-zealous guard.  Of course the 
highlight of the acting is the voices.  With Miss Piggy, Frank Oz delivers 
the same sardonic humor we are used to.  I wished she was given a more major 
role in the plot.  As Pepe the Prawn, Bill Barretta was also delightful, 
imbuing his character with subtle and often hilarious traits.</P>
<P>A Muppets movie has always meant solid entertainment, and this one delivers 
most of the time.  It's certainly good to see the franchise still going - 
Elmo from "Sesame Street" stars in his own movie soon.  A bigger vision and 
more rewriting, one hopes, will bring future Muppet endeavors up to the 
greatness of the first few movies.</P>
