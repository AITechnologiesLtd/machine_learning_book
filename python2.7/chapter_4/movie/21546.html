<P>starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Diane Venora
screenplay by Eric Roth and Michael Mann, based on the article "The
Man Who Knew Too Much" by Marie Brenner
directed by Michael Mann</P>
<P>"60 Minutes" segment producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) has contacted
Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) hoping he'll be able to interpret an
innocuous book of scientific data on the fire hazzards of smoking.
Wigand, a chemist who was recently sent packing by cigarette
manufacturer Brown & Williamson, incorrectly presumes from Bergman's
call that a newshound is after him to break a confidentiality
agreement he signed as part of a severance package. Wigand promptly
faxes a message back that reads "Can't talk. Won't talk. Don't want
to." </P>
<P>Director Michael Mann's nervous camera seems to stop dead when Bergman
realizes that his would-be interpretor has let some sort of cat out of
the bag. Pacino doesn't overemphasize the moment-a satisfied grin
flits across his face and then he's back in business mode. (After all,
Bergman at this point is a detective without a mystery.) They first
worked together on Heat, Pacino and Mann, and they make a great team.
Mann leaves Pacino's visage only out of necessity, and in return,
Pacino always gives us something to look at. </P>
<P>The brilliant Crowe extends Mann the same courtesy. Jeffrey Wigand is
introduced to us as a husband and loving father of few words. (B&W
officially dismissed him for poor communication skills.) But a
disgruntled nerd lurks beneath the surface, a man prone to hard
drinking and violent outbursts. Crowe doesn't call attention to any
shift in personality-when Jeffrey's rage first reveals itself to us,
during a meeting with his former superiors, it's as if we, not Crowe,
were the ones initially repressing Wigand's dark side. And though he
changed his hair and diet to play the gray, pudgy doctor, Crowe (hulky
Bud White of L.A. Confidential) is an unavoidably imposing physical
presence, which adds another layer of tension to his scenes with
Pacino-volatile Wigand could mop the floor with Bergman. </P>
<P>Wigand and Bergman team up when B&W's unwarranted pressure tactics
drive the former to blow the whistle. (They've seen him talking to
journalists; they assume the worst.) Countless threats of litigation
and murder later, Wigand sits down for veteran TV personality Mike
Wallace and discloses the cold hard truth: that he had been hired to
make "nicotine delivery devices" more addictive. Their interview is a
powerful sequence, one of many. </P>
<P>Before the piece on corruption in the tobacco industry has aired, CBS
attorneys advise the "60 Minutes" crew to edit out Wigand's
contribution. As a third party exposing Jeffrey's secrets-breaking the
confidentiality agreement on his behalf-they face a lawsuit so great
that ‘Big Tobacoo' (the seven biggies of the industry) could wind up
owning the network. For the first time in the show's history, or at
least in Lowell's fourteen year history with the show, senior producer
Don Hewitt (Phillip Baker Hall) backs down from a fight, and Wallace
joins him-he's too old and tired to stay perched on the soapbox. This
plot point is the real Mike Wallace's point of contention with The
Insider, a docudrama: he fears the film portrays him as spineless. It
does, but it might also be true.</P>
<P>Bergman, on the other hand, comes off as that rare media species who
glows with integrity. He's as concerned about his new friend Jeffrey's
personal sacrifice going unrewarded as he is the story's impact being
softened. (An altered version will simply warn the public that
cigarettes are bad for you-not exactly the sort of groundbreaking item
that brought "60 Minutes" to fame.) If Lowell is too saintly, in the
end, at least Pacino makes quiet confidence and old-fashioned values
as compelling as those traits that win Oscars: brooding, anger,
remorse, the fidgets-Jeffrey's qualities. Though both actors are
award-worthy, I suspect that Crowe's performance will be the one to
capture the Academy's imagination if any of The Insider's do. </P>
<P>Mann has become a less rigid filmmaker over the years. As co-creator
of "Miami Vice", he practically pioneered the pastels and art deco
aesthetic of the mid-eighties; back then, his shooting style was often
as sterile as his set design. The tide turned with The Last of the
Mohicans-we were no longer voyeurs, we were participants thrown into
battle and swept up in period romance. 1995's Heat, in which his
characters slam "dead-tech post-modern bullshit" architecture,
confirmed that Mann had evolved (no pun intended) into a more
elaborate visualist. (His love of synth music has remained intact over
the years, God bless him: ex-Dead Can Dance frontwoman Lisa Gerrard
and synthesist Pieter Bourke provide The Insider with a dreamy,
emotionally satisfying score.) </P>
<P>The Insider's cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, is beautifully gritty
and experimental-one memorable shot follows Crowe so closely that his
head threatens to knock the lens. Several unfocused reaction takes
feel as if they were captured on the fly. Perhaps and Mann and his
team were inspired by the work of Wong Kar-Wei (whose freeform
Chungking Express The Insider often resembles in visual terms) or
Dogma 95 (the ideal co-developed by Breaking the Waves' director Lars
Von Trier that prohibits the use of unnatural lighting, Steadicams,
and the like). Whatever the case, the film bears the most
issue-oriented screenplay Mann's worked from yet; had he Hollywood-ed
up the presentation, it might have enhanced the story's preachiness
for the worse. </P>
<P>At last, the importance of Dr. Wigand's ballsy confession has been
acknowledged; The Insider is great moviemaking.</P>
