<PRE>                          THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE will be one movie for those who loved the
book, and another for those who haven't read it.  Since it is a book
one stumbles over by accident these days, it's a fair assumption that
most people will come to it without demands or expectations.  They will
be rewarded.</P>
<P>     Edith Wharton's New York of the 1870s was an age of manners, codes
and secrets.  It was a world, in her words, whose "harmony could be
shattered by a whisper."  Those who broke the code weren't snubbed, one
character said, they were eradicated.</P>
<P>     Men learned enough law and finance to steer the family ship.  They
married within the branches of New York's family tree and led lives
that were infused by the politics of bloodlines.  It was into this
rigid structure that Wharton dropped Newland Archer, May Welland, and
Countess Ellen Olenska.</P>
<P>     At the moment that Newland announces his engagement to May, Ellen
returns to town from her failed marriage to a Polish Count.  Trying to
shield Ellen from the gossip she has generated, the honorable Newland
immediately falls in love with her.  Ellen, in turn, protects Newland
from himself.  Of May, his innocent wife, Newland remarks "There was no
use trying to emancipate a wife who had no notion that she was not
free."</P>
<P>     The core strength of Wharton's novel is the decency of each of her
protagonists.  Not a villain among them, each responds
characteristically to the suffocating propriety of the society that
controls them.  Martin Scorsese has made an extravagantly beautiful
movie of this world, paying loving attention to the smallest detail,
even when he gets it wrong.  Neither he nor his cast can be faulted,
except, perhaps, by those who love the book.</P>
<P>     Readers, undoubtedly, will wish Scorsese had chosen one of them to
look over his shoulder.  The pace is wrong.  In a world where men "read
law" and women strolled, where gossip was the currency of intimacy, the
pace was studied, movement measured.  A languorous camera might have
evoked the feel of that world, but Scorsese films it in the fast,
clipped rhythms of today.</P>
<P>     It's okay for Winona Ryder's May to be innocent, but surely  she
must be knowing, not naive  She had, after all, been trained for the
job.  Michelle Pfeiffer's Ellen is as honorable as she is written, but
lacks the mystery that made her the one chance Newland had to touch the
things that danced in his imagination.</P>
<P>     Daniel Day-Lewis conveys with great subtlety the gentle
resignation that is Newland Archer's fate.  His suppression of all the
passions forbidden by his culture is unbearably poignant.</P>
<P>     Day-Lewis, Pfeiffer, Ryder and Scorsese make a powerful team that
would be triumphant if Edith Wharton's skill and subtlety weren't so
elusive.  It's a valiant effort that just may introduce a whole new
generation to the book.</P>
