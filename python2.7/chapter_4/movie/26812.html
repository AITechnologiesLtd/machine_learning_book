<P>    If you're reading this online review, you are, of course,
familiar with the power of the Internet.  All sorts of movie
data, even whole books, can be uploaded to the 'net and
then downloaded in a matter of seconds by readers from
Passaic to Port Moresby.  How easy things have become in
the Information Age!  Our very freedom to gather printed and
even visual material from a gadget that can be held on our
laps furnishes dramatic contrast to the difficulties people had
in disseminating their views during the Nineteenth Century
and before.  Although Gutenberg's invention of movable type
had been around for a couple of hundred years, governments
and religious leaders were reluctant to allow their people to
read materials they considered subversive of the political or
social order.  In our own time, an age that beholds eight-
year-olds gazing casually and without shock at pornography
on the Internet, we may feel bemused that at one time some
books considered corrupt by those in power were off limits to
the populace (as a few are even today).  One such work was
"Justine," published anonymously but recognized everywhere
as the work of the Marquis de Sade.  While the contents
would today be considered hokey, even downright laughable,
the flagrantly erotic text of "Justine" created quite a scandal
in Paris, so much so that while many who could get their
hands on the outlawed novel gobbled up the pages hungrily,
Church officials and even Napoleon himself were apoplectic
with outrage.</P>
<P>   Phil Kaufman, whose "The Right Stuff" was neither arty nor
subtle, now comes across with a decidedly uncommercial
movie; cynical where "The Right Stuff" was idealistic,
grotesque where the all-American movie was straight-laced,
depraved and revolting where the rah-rah picture was
uplifting.  Based on Doug Wright's Obie (off-Broadway)-award
winning play by the same name, "Quills" cannot be mistaken
for a naturalistic movie but instead evokes its theatrical
origins in virtually every scene.  Resembling in spirit Peter
Brook's 1996 film "Marat/Sade"--which was in turn based on
Peter Weiss's breathing-down-your-neck play about a so-
called performance staged by inmates of the French asylum
for the insane at Charenton--"Quills" offers a potent, arch,
humorous and downright fascinating glimpse into a society
both terrified and titillated by literary descriptions of raging
sexuality.  While "Justine" appears to me to be more
gynecological than arousing, the illustrated novel in its time
became a cause celebre, as controversial as the current
presidential quagmire in the U.S.</P>
<P>   "Quills" takes place in 1807 and centers on the Marquis de
Sade, a man whose very name has given us the word
"sadism" but whose cruelty in this screenplay is limited to a
passing comment about his activities--which included the
carving up of a 16-year-old's backside and the rubbing of salt
into the wound.  Instead de Sade is made into an artistic
hero, a man who, while imprisoned at a mental institution for
his past sadism, is for the most part a gentlemanly, intelligent
fellow with a compulsion to write and comfortable quarters to
do so.  If denied the privilege of putting his ideas on paper
with his feathery, quill pen--of subliminating his madness
through his art--he believes that he will go as demented as
his fellow inmates, who include one guy who thinks he's a
bird and another a bald, lecherous Frenchman who could
pass for a Sumo wrestler or for the masked executioner who
in the opening scene lowers the guillotine on a hapless
aristocrat.</P>
<P>   The Marquis (Geoffrey Rush) is treated well by the Abbe
de Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), who believes that insane
people can act reasonably when treated with kindness and
given therapy.  (In one situation, he gently asks a pyromanic,
"Isn't it better to paint fires than to set them")?
A virginal chambermaid in the institution, Madeleine (Kate
Winslet), is regularly aroused by the Marquis' erotic writings,
which she reads to the giggles and pique of other workers,
but more important she has been smuggling the banned
chapters of the Marquis' literature out of the asylum for
general publication--handing the pages over to a mysterious
equestrian comrade.  With Napoleon himself infuriated by the
novels and the Marquis' wife scandalized by the pornography,
Dr. Royer-Collar (Michael Caine) is sent to Charenton to
bring both the Marquis and the Abbe to heel.</P>
<P>   Most of the film deals forcefully, dramatically, and
exquisitely with what happens after the Marquis is forbidden
to write.  His quill pen taken away, he resorts to writing on
the tablecloth with a chicken bone dipped in wine.  Absent
the chicken bone, he pricks his own finger and writes in his
own blood.  When even the ability to cut himself is removed,
he implements yet another resourceful method to get his
ideas into print, one which horrifies the entire institution and
could turn quite a few stomachs of those in the theater
audience.  (His final words give new meaning to smut on
bathroom walls.)</P>
<P>  "Quills" informs us with striking drama what happens when
art and sexuality are repressed by the forces of pious
hypocrisy.  Director Kaufman draws the lines clearly, giving
the viewer no doubt that compromise is out of the question. 
The gentle Abbe is pitted against the throughly unsentimental
Royer-Collard, the latter infuriated when his own marriage to
a orphaned girl decades younger than he is brutally satirized
in a play written by the Marquis and performed by the
inmates to the glee and horror of the audience.  The Abbe
himself is torn between his vows of chastity to the Church
and his arousal by both a naked Marquis and the winsome
chambermaid, Madeleine.  The lovely wife of the Dr. Royer-
Collard, Simone (Amelia Warner), is torn between her
marriage vows to the aging doctor (who supplies her with all
the material luxuries any woman could want) and her
"Justine"-inspired desire for the young and handsome
architect, Prouix (Stephen Moyer).  </P>
<P>   While most of the action of this stage-born work is filmed
within the institution, Kaufman's photographer, Rogier Stoffer
and his production designer, Martin Childs, give the work a
painterly essence, a gruesome exhibition of the guillotine in
action in the very opening of the film climaxing with the horror
that befalls the Marquis as he uncompromisingly alienates the
powers that be.</P>
<P>   The always reliable Michael Caine plays admirably against
the extraordinarily talented Geoffrey Rush, while the erotic
nature of the young women is tested against the repressive
notions of the Church and government.  Strip away the
costumes and you could almost see our own times: the
ongoing dialectic about Hollywood's alleged corrupting of
youths around the world; the absurd overreaction of right-
wingers to President Clinton's peccadilloes; even (as ace
online critic Maitland McDonagh points out in her prescient
essay) the controversy over the defense given by the
American Civil Liberties Union to repulsive organizations like
the American Nazi Party and other skinhead bands. 
Contemporary relevance aside, "Quills" stands out as a
tough-minded, lush portrayal of people acting in extremis,
particularly of one man unwilling, nay unable, to compromise
even at the risk of torture and death.  There's a place on our
screens for small, low-budget indies like Kenneth Lonergan's
remarkable "You Can Count on Me," which NY Times critic
Stephen Holden named one of the two or three best movies
of the year so far.  "Quills" demonstrates that we also need
off-the-wall high drama, powerful tales of larger-than-life
characters whose uncompromising heroism elevates them to
mythic stature.</P>
