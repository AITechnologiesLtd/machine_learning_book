"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>If you liked Braveheart, you probably liked Gladiator. They both had
Australian stars playing extremely manly, likeable heroes who lead
rag-tag bunches of untrained men against seemingly insurmountable
forces.  Each has a really bad guy doing really rotten stuff to really
innocent people.  And each of the male leads are reluctant warriors,
dragged into large-scale confrontation only after somebody messes with
their family in some horrible way.</P>
<P>The Patriot is more of the same - even more so than Gladiator - and
could have saved a fortune in marketing costs by just calling itself
Braveheart II:  The Phantom Menace.  In this installment, Mel Gibson
battles the English on American soil during the Revolutionary War, as
opposed to Braveheart's 13th century Scotland backdrop.  Gibson
(Payback) plays Benjamin Martin, a man who could be a direct descendant
of William Wallace  (he does everything but wear the kilt and the blue
face paint).</P>
<P>The film starts off in 1776 South Carolina.  Martin, a former war
captain, has turned decidedly anti-war ever since his beloved wife went
tits up. The reason for his pacifism?  He's afraid of leaving his seven
children without a father.  Martin even goes to the Continental Congress
in Charleston to vote against the war, but his side loses and, to make
matters worse, his oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger, 10 Things I Hate
About You) signs up to fight the Redcoats.</P>
<P>Before long, the battles are literally being fought in Martin's
backyard. Gabriel is captured by the ridiculously ruthless Col. William
Tavington  (Jason Isaacs, The End of the Affair) and ordered to hang for
betraying King George.  Some other stuff happens that I won't give away
here, but before you know it, Martin is wielding his tomahawk and
covered in English blood.  He even teaches two of his younger sons how
to attack a procession of English officers.  The scene, which has
already sparked a lot of debate over the whole kids/guns issue, is a
revelation as both boys are so scared that they end up looking through
the sights of their guns with tears in their eyes.  Kudos to
screenwriter Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) for this splendid scene.</P>
<P>Like Braveheart's Wallace, Martin has a smart mouth, a cocky attitude
and fights like he's immune to death.  He uses eyebrow-raising tricks
and unconventional combat techniques, and apparently is the guy that
came up with the idea of hiding behind rocks and trees while engaged in
gunfire with the enemy (as opposed to marching in a straight line in a
wide-open field, which was all the rage back then).  And he can mix it
up like nobody's business, brandishing a long list of weapons from guns
to flagpoles.</P>
<P>But there are problems with Martin's character, too.  He's way too
squeaky-clean and noble.  Even his slaves aren't slaves (they just love
working his fields).  Interestingly enough, Martin's character is
supposedly based on one Francis `The Swamp Fox' Marion, a Revolutionary
War hero and noted racist that bragged about hunting American Indians
for sport.  Allegedly, The Patriot was intended to be a biopic about
Marion's life, but once Sony Pictures heard about the Swamp Fox's
real-life exploits, they changed the name of the character and, as they
say, the rest is history.  Here, some brief mentions are made to some
atrocity that Martin may have committed against the French and the
Cherokee at a place called Fort Wilderness.  But Gibson is Gibson - as
long as he's bashing people's skulls in, the world is a happy place.</P>
<P>The Patriot simply looks amazing from the first frame to the last.  It's
one of those films whose scenes seem to be set during sunrise or
sundown, thanks to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's (Anna & The King)
warm photography.  There are several scenes set in a foggy graveyard
marsh, where Martin and his band of merry men meet to discuss battle
plans.  It looks like something out of Sleepy Hollow.  Perennial
Oscar-nominee John Williams (Angela's Ashes) score manages to press most
of the right buttons.</P>
<P>The Patriot was produced and directed by the team that brought us
Godzilla and ID4 (Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin), but this film is
leaps and bounds better than those two travesties.  And this film is the
second in two weeks to feature either Gibson (he lends his voice to
Rocky the Rooster in the animated Chicken Run) or the underused Chris
Cooper (Me, Myself & Irene), who plays Col. Harry Burwell in this
picture.</P>
