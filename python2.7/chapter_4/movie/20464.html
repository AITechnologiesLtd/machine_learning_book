<P>In recent years, films centering on dysfunctional families have been on the 
uprise, from Jodie Foster's 1995 sophomore directing effort, `Home for the 
Holidays,' to 1997's tragic Ang Lee drama, `The Ice Storm,' to 1998's Todd 
Solondz black comedy, `Happiness.' The question, of course, is why are 
today's filmmakers so interested in depicting the clearly unstable 
relationships going on within a seemingly normal American household? And the 
answer, no doubt, is that its appeal stems from the viewer being able to 
relate to the characters and circumstances because, let's face it, no family 
is `normal,' whatever that may mean. `The Ice Storm' was a searing film about 
the way some parents unknowingly fail their children due to their own 
shortcomings and selfishness, as was the shockingly brutal `Happiness,' about 
the dark areas that hide within the exterior calm of suburbia, but no film 
that I have ever seen has portrayed a family, or families, in this case, with 
quite the unnerving honesty and sharp-eyed realism and sympathy of `American 
Beauty,' Sam Mendes' flawless, heartbreaking directing debut. Simply put, it 
is the most thought-provoking and powerful motion picture of the whole 
decade. </P>
<P>To summarize the premise is to trivialize its multi-layered and 
clearly-defined characters, and the wholly unpredictable story developments, 
but here goes. Like Robert Altman's most impressive work (1975's `Nashville,' 
1993's `Short Cuts'), `American Beauty' is a meticulously-written tapestry of 
the lives of two families living side-by-side in a suburban neighborhood in 
Anywhere, USA. Occasionally narrated by Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a 
middle-aged man stuck in an emotionally dead and artificial marriage with 
Carolyn (Annette Bening), a real-estate agent, he tells us right from the 
very first scene that in a year, he will be dead, even though he doesn't know 
it yet. Without being told the particulars of his impending death, Lester 
decides to stop living his life the way everyone else expects him to, and 
immediately quits his sickeningly bland office job. Everything comes into 
focus for him when, while attending a high school basketball game to see his 
teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), perform as a cheerleader, his undivided 
attention moves towards the most beautiful girl he's ever seen: the 
pixie-like, alluring Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), who also happens to be a 
high school student and Jane's best friend. Soon, Lester is lifting weights 
and smoking pot, free of all worries aside from hoping to have a chance with 
the sexually promiscuous Angela. Meanwhile, Carolyn starts having an affair 
with `The King' (Peter Gallagher), the most successful real estate agent in 
the town and the figure whom she most wants to be like. Due to Lester and
Carolyn's obvious failure as parents and their own self-involvement, they 
don't realize
how neglected they are making Jane feel, and Angela is no help, as she is 
constantly bragging about her latest sexual conquests and repeated success in 
everything she does. Saving up money for a breast augmentation, even though 
she doesn't need it, and with the self-esteem of an gnat, Jane luckily finds 
solace in the form of 18-year-old Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), a dark, offbeat 
senior whom she first meets when she catches him filming her with his video 
camera, something he is never without. Ricky has also just moved in next door 
to the Burnham's, complete with a strict ex-Marine father (Chris Cooper) who 
checks his urine every few months to make sure he isn't on drugs, and a 
mother (Allison Janney) who inhabits the house as, more or less, a living 
zombie with no spontaneity of life left in her. </P>
<P>`American Beauty,' which superficially refers to either Angela's physical 
appearance or the flowers Carolyn is growing in her garden, actually gets its 
name from the positive, existential way in which Ricky looks at the world. 
Constantly filming and documenting even the smallest thing with his camera, 
Ricky has escaped the unhappiness of his actual home life by finding simple 
beauty within the world, and in one lyrical sequence, he shows Jane `the most 
beautiful thing I've ever filmed,' which is the surprisingly extraordinary 
sight of a plastic bag blowing around outside on a blustery winter day, right 
before a snowfall. By looking closer at the people, objects, and nature 
around him, Ricky has discovered a truth within the world that not many 
people have the priviledge of ever seeing, and sometimes, he says, `the world 
is filled with so much beauty, I feel like I can't take it.' It is Ricky who 
also acts as the catalyst for Lester's drastic, personality-altering changes, 
as he believes that life is too short to waste your time doing what others 
expect you to do, and instead, should simply live your life as if each second 
were your last. </P>
<P>In scene after marvelous scene, the trials, tribulations, and experiences of 
family life is portrayed as accurately as it ever has been in a fictional 
film, and every detail hits the bull's-eye. And as in real life, the film is 
carefully-structured in a way that it often feels like we are watching a 
series of moments in the lives of a group of people, rather than a 
cut-and-paste story, like so many conventional films fall victim to. The way 
Carolyn breaks down and cries in frustration after failing to sell a house; 
the way Ricky, camera in hand, zooms in on Jane's bedroom window, past Angela 
seductively dancing, and onto the mirror image of Jane smiling; the way 
Lester, liberated from quitting his job, belts out the ‘70s rock song, 
`American Woman,' by The Guess Who, as he drives down the street; the way 
Lester sneaks into Jane's room to find Angela's telephone number, only to 
hang up after calling this young girl who is at least twenty-five years 
younger than he; the way Jane, realizing she is falling in love, takes 
Ricky's hand and puts it in her own; the way Carolyn tries to have an honest 
mother-daughter moment, only for her to outrageously accuse Jane of being `an 
ungrateful little brat'; and the way Ricky's mom, an enormously depressed 
woman, doesn't even hear her son walk over to her and say,
`Hi,' are just a handful of individual moments that come together to form a 
magnificent whole, and that isn't even mentioning the tour de force climax, 
set on a stormy night, that left me physically reacting to the proceedings 
on-screen, on the edge of completely losing my composure with strong 
conflicting emotions of shock, curiosity, and absolute devastation.</P>
<P>There is no possible cast that could have improved upon this stunning group 
of actors, nor is there any way to pin-point just one outstanding 
performance. All six of the central thesps deserve Academy Award nominations 
come next year, and it would be criminal to overlook their incomparable work 
here. Kevin Spacey, a former Oscar winner for 1995's `The Usual Suspects,' 
gives his best performance to date, and one that is filled with such an 
overwhelming air of freedom that it is a treat just to watch him work. A man 
lacking in parenting skills, it isn't that Lester doesn't love Jane, but just 
that he is thoroughly fed up with his dead-end existence, and feels that it's 
about time he does what he wants to do.</P>
<P>Annette Bening, in her second stunning turn this year alone (after the 
underrated,
overlooked `In Dreams'), successfully paints her character of Carolyn with a 
vital
mixture of coldness and misery. Always hiding behind a phony facade of joy 
while out in public, she is desperate to fool everyone else into believing 
that she has an ideal marriage with Lester, even though they haven't actually 
been intimate in a long time. It seems the only thing keeping them from 
getting a divorce is their fear that it will only hurt Jane even more; little 
do they know it's probably making things even more of a disaster, as Jane has 
openly told Ricky herself that, `they've got to be psychologically damaging 
me in some way.'</P>
<P>Thora Birch, a 17-year-old actress who has been appearing in feature films 
for eleven
years, and someone I have watched closely since 1991 when she gave an 
Oscar-caliber performance in `Paradise,' practically blew me away with the 
maturity and
self-assuredness that she has gained as an actress since her last major role, 
in 1996's terrible `Alaska.' Birch, easily outdistancing the best 
performances from some of her peers, such as Christina Ricci and Gaby 
Hoffmann, is poignant and effective as the sullen Jane, and due to some 
surprisingly adult material, it obviously took a great deal of courage on her 
part, and she should be commended for it. Jane's relationship with her 
uninvolved parents is summed up early on when she matter-of-factly tells her 
father, `you've barely spoken to me in the last six months.'</P>
<P>Newcomer Wes Bentley, who won the important, decidedly difficult role of 
Ricky over
many of Hollywood's major young stars, is striking and intense throughout, 
but also
affecting, as this misunderstood teenager whose only claim to happiness is in 
his magical, bright-eyed world view. After all, he certainly doesn't get much 
familial support from his hot-tempered father, vividly and 
three-dimensionally played by Chris Cooper (1999's `October Sky'), or his 
zoned-out mother, in a performance of almost unbearable despair by the 
usually comedic actress, Allison Janney (1999's `Drop Dead Gorgeous').</P>
<P>And finally, Mena Suvari is a real discovery as the self-absorbed Angela, the 
character who triggers Lester's lust. Last appearing as the sweet choir girl, 
Heather, in this summer's `American Pie,' Suvari makes a full 180-degree turn 
to present us with a distinct character who, like everyone else, turns out to 
have many multiple layers behind her `cool' exterior. Angela, who judges her 
chances on becoming a model based on her desirability and the amount of 
people she has sex with, fears nothing worse than being ordinary, something 
that, if she would just stop to notice, she very well could be.</P>
<P>With a haunting, unnerving music score, by Thomas Newman; astoundingly 
gorgeous cinematography, by Conrad L. Hall, in which every frame and lighting 
decision turns out to be extremely important in its visual collage of the 
bleak corners in these characters' seemingly happy lives, as well as in the 
showstopping way it observes the things most people take for granted, such as 
a tree, or a person's face; and most importantly, in the literally 
pitch-perfect screenplay, by Alan Ball, `American Beauty' is an instant 
American film classic, and one that cannot be labelled under a certain genre, 
as it has both drama and comedy, both of which are sparked from its natural 
dialogue and sharp human observations. Entirely unpredictable as life's 
fortuitous turns and developments usually are, what we have here is a 
painstakingly on-target portrait of the human condition, as seen through the 
eyes of a group of always-original characters. Better yet, none of them are 
ever shortchanged or judged, nor are all of their dimensions revealed 
immediately, but instead, we learn about them as their true selves are 
gradually revealed. Because of this, there are no good or bad guys, but 
rather wholly sympathetic creations that, in one way or another, any adult or 
teenager will be able to identify with. By the time the ending arrived, a 
simply-filmed emotional powerhouse, the film had so deeply involved me that I 
felt as if I had known these characters all my life, and therefore, what 
happened to them meant just as much, if not more, to me, than in any
other film I have ever seen. `American Beauty' is a devastating motion 
picture of
unconceivable power, made with both intelligence and care, and it may just 
cause you to reevaluate the whole way you view the world. In an overstuffed 
Fall movie season  don't let this film fall through the cracks; it deserves 
all of the recognition and acclaim that has already been bestowed upon it, 
and should be trumpeted as an important turning point in the art of 
filmmaking, particularly with the start of the new millenium so quickly 
approaching. In one word, `American Beauty' is beautiful.</P>
