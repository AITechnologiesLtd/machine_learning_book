<PRE>                            YOU'VE GOT MAIL
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Two rivals in the book business do
          not realize that each's secret Internet pen pal is
          the other.  This remake of the 1940 Lubitsch comedy
          THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER has been modified to be
          more timely with the addition to the script of the
          issue of super-store bookstores squeezing out small
          independent book stores.  This is probably the best
          version of this story.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are
          as always a good romantic team.  Rating: 7 (0 to
          10), low +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 7 positive, 7 negative, 7 mixed</PRE>
<P>     I suppose if a filmmaker is going to remake a classic film, this
is the right way to do it.  Ernst Lubitsch's SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is
a decent film, but I have never heard of anyone loving it so much that
they could not stand to see other actors in similar roles.  And it was,
in fact, remade as a musical in 1949, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME.
Neither film really developed the idea much beyond being a simple
ironic situation.  Two shop clerks in the same store hate each other
and each loves a pen pal that he/she has never met.  Of course it turns
out they are writing to each other, and somehow it is assumed that the
inner person is represented by the writing and not the actual person.
YOU'VE GOT MAIL takes the same situation and expands on it, using the
anonymity of electronic communications on the Internet.  The film also
looks at the issue of big superstore bookstores chasing out smaller
independent bookstores.  In particular the plot may have inspired by
the incident when a new Barnes and Noble superstore in Manhattan drove
a much-loved children's bookstore, Eeyore Books, out of business.</P>
<P>     Kathleen Kelly (played by Meg Ryan) is the second-generation owner
of The Shop Around the Corner, a children's bookstore in Manhattan that
has become something of a neighborhood institution.  Parents who used
to come to the bookstore as children now bring their children to
discover the world of reading.  But the bookshop is in trouble.  Fox, a
chain of bookstores, is putting a superstore just around the corner
from The Shop Around the Corner.  The competition may well drive the
little bookstore out of business.  But even while her professional life
is in trouble Kathleen is developing an e-mail-based relationship with
a pen pal over the Internet.  The man she knows only as "NY152" is a
decent and witty person.  Little does Kathleen realize that NY152 is
really Tom Fox (Tom Hanks) the third generation owner of the Fox
bookstore chain. In the flesh Tom Fox represents to Kathleen everything
that is going wrong with the book industry.  Small caring bookstores
are being replaced by Goliaths with know-nothing clerks, big comfy
chairs, and cappuccino bars.  Though Kathleen is living with writer
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) and Tom is living with editor Patricia
Eden (Parker Posey), they carry on a secret electronic relationship.
The artificial excitement of the AOL voice saying, "You've got mail!"
becomes almost a metaphor for the loveless by-the-numbers
relationships into which each has fallen.  It is counterpoint to what
they feel writing to each other, flirting with the idea of meeting, but
afraid to dispel the magic.  In fact, much of the best writing of the
film is in the little essays that each sends the other.  At times the
discussions are reminiscent of those in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD.</P>
<P>     This is the third screen teaming of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  The
first time they were together was in JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO, a film so
offbeat that it never found an audience.  (By the way, if you get a
chance, rent this film.  The writing is occasionally lame but more
frequently wonderful.)  Their second romantic teaming was, of course,
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, a film not up to its reputation, but still a gem.
There certainly is chemistry between Hanks and Ryan as strong as
Gable's and Lombard's.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a light and tasty little
romantic recipe for the holidays.  Still, it is the most thoughtful of
the three film versions of this particular story.  I rate it a 7 on the
0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
