<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This B&W film is based on a Rex Beach novel that was filmed three times
before (twice as a silent) and once afterwards. It's a colorful
adventure story of saloon brawls, romance, and corruption. The film is
set in Nome, Alaska, during the Gold Rush days of 1900. It is most noted
for the last five minutes where a classic barroom fight between bad guy
Randolph Scott and good guy John Wayne, over the sexy owner of the Yukon
saloon, Marlene Dietrich -- with winner take all. The brawl was
unrealistic but marvelous to watch.</P>
<P>The Spoilers is about a group of crooks (the spoilers) who come to Nome
with the law on their side to support claim-jumpers, as they plan to
gain the biggest mine in the territory this way. McNamara (Randolph
Scott) is the crooked gold commissioner, teamed up with an equally
unscrupulous Judge Stillman (Samuel S. Hinds), his underling Struve
(Halton), and a pretty relative of the judge, the high-falutin Helen
Chester, who is used as a lure to get the wealthy mine owner they plan
to swindle, Roy Glennister (John Wayne), to fall for her and let his
guard down about what they're after.</P>
<P>Roy, through the dealings of the crooked court he foolishly trusts,
temporarily loses the mine he jointly owns with old-timer Al Dextry
(Harry Carey). His hot romance with saloon owner Cherry Mallote (Marlene
Dietrich) is put on hold when she sees him come back to Nome with Helen
in his arms, mistaking this gesture for a romance brewing.</P>
<P>William Farnum, who played John Wayne's role in the original 1914
version of The Spoilers, in the remake plays a minor supporting role as
the lawyer helping John Wayne sort things out; also on hand in a cameo
is poet Robert W. Service, of "The Shooting of Dan McGrew" fame.</P>
<P>The stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action
rolling, as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing.
Marlene couldn't be sexier, wearing brocades and gowns, changing from
one gown to another at the drop of a beer stein. Wayne and Scott are
made for action films, and play their parts with fluidity. For comic
moments, there is the dialogue between Marlene and black maid Marietta
Canty, who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the Yukon. Richard
Barthelmess plays the sniveling houseman in Marlene's gambling saloon,
who wants her for himself, but is put down in one delicious scene, as
Marlene tells him, go down below to your table. Old time actor in the
silents, a hero of Wayne's, is Harry Carey. He plays the rough and
tumble honest prospector Dextry who struck it rich with Wayne and will
let no one take what is his away without a fight.</P>
