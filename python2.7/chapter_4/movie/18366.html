<PRE>The Mummy
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Brendan Fraser; Rachel Weisz; John Hannah; Arnold Voslo & Kevin J.
O'Connor
Brendan Fraser stars in this remake of the 1930's Boris Karloff classic.
This new mummy is not only a tribute to the original but it is very
blatantly paying homage to Raiders Of The Lost Ark as well. Brendan Fraser
is no Indiana Jones, but he comes pretty darn close. I'll admit right off
the bat that I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of The Mummy. I figured on a
few nifty special effects and not a whole lot else. I was in for quite the
surprise. The Mummy is a whole lot of fun, and will probably rank as one of
my favorite movies of the year. Fraser plays a former soldier turned fortune
hunter who, in no small way, resembles a certain character that Harrison
Ford made famous. Although, Fraser's character doesn't have a bullwhip. Rick
O'Connell (Fraser) is one of the few people who has ever seen the Lost City
of the Dead in Egypt. It is reported to contain an immense treasure and
volumes of great knowledge. He is hired by a librarian (Rachel Weisz) and
her brother (John Hannah) to take them to the city so that they can try to
find its hidden treasures. Once there they run into a bit more than they
bargained for. They inadvertently bring back to life a mummy which has been
sealed in the ancient city along with a very bad curse. Basically, once this
Mummy gets reawakened he isn't a real nice guy. And once he gets up to full
strength he will be able to control the world. By the way, the way he gains
strength is to replace the long rotted parts of his body with new flesh from
living victims. The Mummy has as his command the power to create plagues of
biblical proportion, such as locusts, making the water turn to blood and
fireballs falling from the sky. All and all, not the sort of fellow that you
want to be enemies with.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie is a little on the popcorn side of things. It is your
typical light summer fare. This is not a difficult movie to follow, yet on
the other hand there are enough spills, thrills and one liners to keep the
audience thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. I was not really
expecting a whole lot in either the dialogue or acting portions of this
movie. On both counts I was happily wrong. This isn't Oscar-caliber dialogue
mind you, but it is witty and often pretty funny. I found most of it was
designed to give the movie that Indiana Jones feel. Even in the worst of
situations, someone seemingly had a wisecrack. The acting was very
impressive. Brendan Fraser has never really been in a movie that ever really
impressed the heck out of me. This time he did. Fraser comes off as a young
Harrison Ford in this movie. He might not have quite as much talent as Ford,
but he certainly has the charisma and screen presence to make up for it.
Quite honestly, he is no slouch in the talent department either. Rachel
Weisz does a fine job as the take charge librarian who eventually falls for
Fraser's character. The actor who I enjoyed the most was John Hannah as
Weisz's somewhat roguish brother. His character was pure comic relief, and
Hannah delivered all the way. Arnold Voslo was also good playing the mummy.
Although his scenes were somewhat limited because of the nature of his
character.</P>
<P>The reason Voslo's scenes were limited was the fact that for a good portion
of the movie, the Mummy was purely a computer generated character. More or
less a walking skeleton with a little rotting flesh on him. Although there
was more and more meat on him as the movie progressed and the body count
mounted. The CGI Mummy was probably the most impressive CGI character that I
have ever seen in a movie. I would say it will be a long time before the
effects were surpassed if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars: Episode
I - The Phantom Menace wasn't being released a week and a half after this
film. The Mummy itself wasn't the only impressive computer generated horror
in this film. Special effects wizards also used computers to generate a very
impressive killer windstorm as well as the Mummy's undead henchmen. One of
the neatest touches was the CGI flesh eating beetles -- I'll say no more.</P>
<P>If, when you think of The Mummy, you picture a slow moving creature wrapped
in gauze chasing people at speeds approaching 1/4 of a mile per hour, you
are in for a shock. This new Mummy is slick, scary and a whole lot of fun.
The Mummy might not go down as a "classic" like the original, but it will
provide you with one of the most enjoyable movie experiences that you are
likely to see in a summer film.</P>
