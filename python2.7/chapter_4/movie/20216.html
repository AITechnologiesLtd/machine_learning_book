<PRE>The Thomas Crown Affair (R) ***
Starring Rene Russo, Pierce Brosnan
Directed by John McTiernan
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The Thomas Crown Affair cannot escape. There will be a countless amount of
people that will compare it to the old original and say, wow, that was so much
better. There will also be people that compare to it the recent Entrapment and
say, wow, it's so much better than that stupid. insepid piece of trash. And
that's where The Thomas Crown Affair falls, right about in the middle. While
much more plausible and slick than Entrapment, it fails to have that classic
crime caper feel the original had.</P>
<P>The rich Thomas Crown (Brosnan who's character is basically Bond without the
gunfire) enjoys the breathtaking thrill of stealing. He steals a $100 million
dollar Monet in a very slick and sophisticated way, using a method of
distraction. But Catherine, (Russo who can still strut her stuff) an insurance
investigator, knows he did it. She begins to investigate the case and finds
herself falling in love.</P>
<P>So begins an erotic game of cat and mouse. The bond between Catherine and
Brosnan begins to form and her love for him goes beyond getting the back the
painting. While the chemistry is good, I really didn't think that most of this
stuff could have happened, but this is a highly-styleized (I really hope that
is an actual word and that I spelled it correctly) Hollywood film, so you won't
notice anyway. </P>
<P>Add in some stunning clothing and you've got The Thomas Crown Affair. Much like
Entrapment, but with more sex (also, a wonderful thing, the two main characters
are actually each other's age!) and romance. It's also a bit slow and features
an annoying Denis Leary character, and topless scenes. But it's still not as
good as the original. But I still think that you would like this fun
crime/romance story that gets *** stars</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: This film contains two sex scenes and three scenes where Rene
Russo appears topless. While none of them are explicit, I'd say the good age is
around 13 or 14.</P>
