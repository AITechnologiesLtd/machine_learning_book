<PRE>TWENTYFOURSEVEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Why do filmmakers feel compelled to tell us basically the same
story we've already heard?  Last year it was VOLCANO and DANTE'S PEAK,
and this year we have THE BOXER and TWENTYFOURSEVEN, which might have
been more aptly titled THE BOXER-LIGHT - very light.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, a completely unrecognizable Bob Hoskins is
found almost dead in an abandoned railroad car.  With a bloated face,
hair like a discarded mop, bruised skin and incoherent demeanor,
Hoskins, as the story's protagonist Alan Darcy, immediately shocks us.
And with Ashley Rowe's gritty black-and-white cinematography the movie
looks quite promising.</P>
<PRE>     Then it proceeds to go nowhere.</PRE>
<P>     We are told Darcy's story in flashback.  The picture's sporadic
voice-over by Hoskins is intelligent and insightful, something the rest
of the script by Paul Fraser and the film's director Shane Meadows
isn't.</P>
<P>     Darcy tells us that the kids in public housing lead a terrible
life twenty-four seven, meaning all week long.  "If you've never had
anything to believe in, you're always going to be poor," he reasons
with us.  So he sets up a boxing club for the troubled youth exactly as
Daniel Day-Lewis did in THE BOXER.</P>
<P>     The film lacks any coherent narrative.  Ramblingly along with
little happening - there's not even much boxing or practicing - the
teens in his club make small talk and go on hikes in the woods, in
which the director gives visual emphasis to such trivia as going to the
bathroom outdoors.</P>
<P>     The large supporting cast has precious little to do.  The director
makes them into a faceless slice of humanity with no one standing out.
This is somewhat complicated by the accents, except for Hoskins's,
which are so thick that subtitles might have helped - but not much.
The actors evidence little energy or compassion for the movie, and they
all play interchangeable parts.  We learn that the teens and their
parents are an angry lot, although the movie rarely goes to the trouble
of explaining their motivation, other than being poor.</P>
<P>     When the big boxing match finally happens, it's more like a quick
barroom brawl.  (Notice that their weight is announced in stones, which
makes for a nice metaphor.)  Only when one fight goes tragically wrong
does the story finally come alive with some much needed, genuine
poignancy.  Other than that, the lifeless picture is easily forgotten.</P>
<P>     TWENTYFOURSEVEN runs 1:36.  It is rated R for language, violence
and some drug content and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
