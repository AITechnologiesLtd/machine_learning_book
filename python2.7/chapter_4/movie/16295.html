<P>The worst way to begin a year is with a massive disappointment.  And
yet, DreamWorks has delivered what will likely be one of the most
disappointing films of 1999.  Here we have In Dreams, a thriller
directed by the immensely talented Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, Mona
Lisa).  It has an extremely able cast, led by Annette Bening and
supported by Aidan Quin, Robert Downey Jr., and Stephen Rea.  It also
has my favorite cinematographer, Darius Khondji (Seven, Alien
Resurrection), and one of my favorite music composers, Elliott
Goldenthal.  And, it's been brought to us by DreamWorks, who have
promised to bring out only quality entertainment.</P>
<P>I had forgotten that DreamWorks' first picture was The Peacemaker. 
They are capable of making lousy films, but In Dreams isn't lousy as
much as it's plainly mediocre.  And it's such a shame:  not only is
there limitless talent involved, but the film is actually quite good for
well over an hour.  It's a dark, intelligent film that seems to explore
its possibilities; but, in the final forty-five minutes, it becomes
implausible, silly, and almost unwatchably bad at times.  The conclusion
is moderately satisfying, but nothing can overcome the sloppy way it
reaches its resolution.  </P>
<P>Benning and Quinn play Claire and Paul Cooper; Claire is a woman who
has "dreams" when she's wide awake -- dreams that seem to show her past
events.  Usually, these events are intertwined with crimes:  in the
beginning of the film, she sees a young girl being led through an orchid
by an ill-adjusted man, and she thinks the girl has been kidnapped in
real life.  When her own daughter gets kidnapped, Claire realizes that
the visions she has are actually visions of the future.</P>
<P>When the fate of her daughter is discovered, Claire loses her mind. 
She can't control the dreams, and it becomes clear that she has some
kind of connection with the ill-adjusted man (who turns out later to be
Robert Downey Jr.).  A psychiatrist, Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rae), tries
to evaluate her dreams, but no one really believes her.  Eventually,
after multiple suicide attempts, Claire is committed to a mental
institution.  And, as luck would have it, she's placed in the exact same
room in which her psychotic male counterpart had lived during the early
years of his life.</P>
<P>It really does sound like a silly story.  Credit Jordan for making it
seem so disturbing and intriguing for the first two-thirds of it.  The
background story for In Dreams revolves around a town that had been
flooded twenty years before the events in the film take place; the early
scenes, which explore the deep blue streets of the underwater town, are
extremely eerie.  Khondji and Jordan work well together to create a
dark, silvery-blue mood throughout the film.  There isn't a shot in the
picture that doesn't look great -- the various settings (the Coopers'
old house, the mental institution, etc.) are all very well photographed.</P>
<P>In addition, Annette Bening is exceptional in the lead role.  She
carries the film effortlessly, giving depth and personality to a
character who might not have been very interesting on paper.  Bening
does a fantastic job of showing us Claire's descent into madness; it
never seems overwrought or phony, and it's so believable that in one
particular scene (in which she's trying to convince Dr. Silverman that
her husband is going to be murdered) I became visibly agitated due to
the effectiveness of her performance.  Most of the supporting
performances are less than noteworthy -- Quinn is reliable, as always,
but Rae seems present only because Jordan always has him present.  </P>
<P>The only other performance worth mentioning is that of Robert Downey
Jr., and he is one of the reasons the film becomes so bad towards the
end.  Now, I do realize that it was up to Jordan to make sure that
Downey Jr. didn't overact, but both men are responsible for the
laughable absurdities that take place on screen in the final act of In
Dreams.  I was willing to overlook the fact that Claire seems to
overcome her insanity to turn into a pseudo-action hero.  I was willing
to overlook the ridiculous way in which some of the characters act to
serve the plot.  But I can not overlook Downey Jr.'s performance, and
the purely cliched mess of a character that he plays.</P>
<P>Hasn't the I'm-psycho-because-my-mother-made-me-do-it motif been done
before?  And why is it that all psycho killers have to have problems
with their genders?  Do they all speak like five-year-olds trapped in
thirty-year-old bodies?  In its final thirty minutes, In Dreams explores
nothing but a truckload of cliches; I was too distracted to even immerse
myself in the brilliant image on screen.  It's so profoundly dumb that
it essentially ruins what came before.  At the core, In Dreams is just
another mediocre thriller.  But it could have been something unusually
good:  the people involved are good at what they do, and the first hour
is proof of that.  But what happened with this sloppy conclusion?  I
would rather have never seen the end.</P>
