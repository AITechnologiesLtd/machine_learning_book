<PRE>The Mark of Zorro (1920)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"The Mark of Zorro" is a silent epic starring
Douglas Fairbanks Sr.  It is a good film with
plenty of action, and decent comic relief,
but the characters (except Fairbanks') lack
the depth that is required of a better film.</P>
<P>Don Diego Vega (Fairbanks) has returned to
California after many years in Spain.  He is
vaguely discourteous, perpetually fatigued,
and particularly fond of his handkerchief.
His stereotypical father (Sidney de Gray)
disapproves of his character and idle lifestyle.</P>
<P>What father doesn't know is that his son is
also Zorro, masked avenger of the pathetic and
repressed.  Zorro is easily the most skillful
and smartest swashbuckler in California, and
enjoys humiliating the local soldiers, especially
Sergeant Gonzales (Noah Beery).</P>
<P>de Gray orders his son to woo Marguerite de la
Motte, whose family is unfairly repressed by the
Governor (George Periolat).  However, she prefers
Zorro, who makes regular appearances to ward
off obnoxious suitor Robert McKim.</P>
<P>"The Mark of Zorro" is at its best when Fairbanks
is playing Don Diego Vega.  Fairbanks is known
for his action roles, and it is a pleasant change
to see him in a comic relief role.  Vega's
feeble courtship with de la Motte is entertaining.
Fairbanks as Zorro is a laughing, mocking, smoking
tormentor.</P>
<P>"The Mark of Zorro" was filmed in black and
white, of course, but made frequent use of
tinted lenses.  Various scenes have red, green
or blue tints, depending upon whether the scene
takes place in daylight, at night, or indoors.
I have not seen enough early silent features
to know if this was a common technique, but
it was no longer used by the mid-1920s.</P>
