<PRE>LOLITA (1962)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Stanley Kubrick
Writer: Vladmir Nabokov (adapted from his novel)
Starring: James Mason, Sue Lyon, Shelly Winters, Peter Sellers</P>
<P>"How did they ever make a movie like 'Lolita?'" said the posters for the
1962 Kubrick adaptation of the raunchy novel by Vladmir Nabokov of the same
name.  After reading it, I wondered the same thing.  Here's a novel dealing
with the sexual obsession a middle-aged man has for a 14-year old "nymphet"
with the eponomys name, and in the early 60s, a film is being made from it.
 To readers of the novel, this means an unfaithful adaptation to adhere to
the early 60s censors, which the film does.  Anyone looking for a faithful
adaptation should wait for the new one directed by Adrian Lynne to find an
American distributor.</P>
<P>But as unfaithful as it is the novel, "Lolita" is surprisingly remarkable. 
It has a kind of weird comic feel to it, with small chuckles coming out of
scenes that are funny because of character, not situation.  And it has a
kind of Sophoclean depth to it, mostly due to a structure that was forced
upon the film by the distributors.  The first scene of the film is the last
chapter of the novel: our protagonist, Humbert Humbert (played with
brilliance by James Mason, who you may remember as the head villain in
Hitchcock's "North by Northwest"), goes to kill the object of his hatred,
the man who stole his Lolita from him, Claire Quilty (Peter Sellars).  This
was done because the distributors wanted Humbert Humbert to seem like a
murderer before he's a pedophile.  But it instead gives a brilliant scope
of fate to it.  Like Oedpius, Humbert Humbert is forced to live a tragic
life, his tragic flaw being his obsession with Lolita.</P>
<P>The novel by Vladmir Nabokov is a brilliantly written novel, told from the
perspective of Humbert Humbert himself (maybe revealing a bit about
Nabokov...), and filled with clever word play much like James Joyce.  The
novel is the journals of Humbert upon seeing everything in his life, and
being a writer, Humbert has a sardonic, pretentious wit about everything. 
With a narration by Humbert throughout the film, maybe the point is that
Humbert sees his future because of his lifestyle but can't change who he
is.  He's trapped to be Humbert Humbert, the pedophile.</P>
<P>The plot deals with Humbert who moves to America to write and get a
teaching job, and ends up staying with in a big house owned by the
eccentric, overbearing, sexual-crazed, nightmare mother, Charlotte Haze (a
remarkably thin Shelley Winters), primarily because he sees her daughter,
Lolita (Sue Lyon, actually a little over 16), tanning in a bikini in her
garden.  The film's only flaw is its backup for Humbert, which the novel
supplies as being that he lost a childhood sweetheart to death, and she
reminds him of her.  Although this isn't a big flaw, it does make Humbert
look more like a pedophile than he is in the book.</P>
<P>Soon, Humbert has married Charlotte, solely so he can see Lolita more and
wait for Charlotte to die of a failing kidney she has.  But when Charlotte
discovers his diaries, which he kept for more of thrill with the situation,
she storms out and is thankfully hit by a car, killing her instantly.  He
goes off with Lolita on a road trip, and is constantly running into people
who we know is the same person: Claire Quilty from the beginning, another
pedophile writer (though this time a playwright) obsessed with Lolita.  As
the film goes on, Quilty is constantly disguising himself as various
different people: a police officer, a german psychiatrist, etc (hinting at
the kind of chameleon-like role playing Sellars would do in Kubrick's next
film, "Dr. Strangelove") in an effort to rob Lolita from Humbert, who is
pathetically trying to control her.</P>
<P>What's remarkable about this film is its sense of humor.  The film has a
darkly comic feel mixed with the tragic story.  It's like watching Greek
Tragedy with lots of humor in it.  Although one slapstick moment seems too
disjointed from the film (a scene involving a cot, a sleeping Lolita, and a
loud Hotel Attendant), the film maintains humor from the characters and
their nuances.  This is not a film we laugh hard at, but we do get lots of
chuckles out of just watching the characters shine do their stuff.</P>
<P>Stanley Kubrick has always been an amazing director, and it's easy to
dismiss this film from the other films in his oeuvre.  It lacks the scope
of many of his other films, as well as the hypnotism.  But when grading a
director's work, one must ignore all the others and concentrate on the film
as it stands alone.  It's a simple film, despite its taboo topic, and it
never lets its gimmick of a grown man in love with a teenage girl overcome
its purpose of describing a tragic character, and the situation surrounding
him.</P>
<P>Besides, there are so many brilliant things about it, like the gorgeous
black and white photography, showing the sadness lying within the film. 
And there are several brilliant scenes, like the opening which is among
Kubrick's most intense and funniest sequences, with a hung over and crazed
Quilty playing oblivious to Humbert's mortal threats.  Charlotte's death
scene is also brilliant, with a cruel bit humor dumped in for a better
effect.  And the final scene where Lolita explains what happened to her
after Quilty stole her and Humbert finally gives in is sad without becoming
melodratic.  Kubrick easily lets this be funny and tragic without mixing
the two elements wrong.</P>
<P>The acting from all is brilliant.  Sue Lyon, although looking way too old
to play the character at a young age and too young to play the character at
an older age, nails her acting, showing Lolita as a very nuanced character,
exhibiting all her childish bitchiness.  Shelley Winters is amazing,
showing a well-rounded character, and showing that back in the day, she was
actually...dare I say it, attractive.  And Peter Sellars is ingeniusly
funny in his multiple-yet-singular role, stealing many of the scenes.</P>
<P>But it is James Mason who really amazed me.  Despite being a crazy
pedophile, he shows Humbert Humbert as being a tragic character, and easily
gets our sympathy despite being who and what he is.  Mason is an amazing
actor, and he exhibits lots of great personality in his portrayal of
Humbert Humbert.  Scenes where he's trying to rule Lolita are priceless,
especially one where he's just embarrassed her socially, and tries to coax
her back to him.  Mason's one of the many pleasures of watching this film.</P>
<P>"Lolita" has been wrongly presented in history as being one of Kubrick's
underrated films, a hard-to-find masterpiece that has been wrongly bashed
by some as being unlike the novel.  But who cares if a film is unlike the
novel?  Espeically if it has the good excuse that it was the early 60s,
where a novel as frank as "Lolita" could be written, but a film as frank as
it couldn't be filmed.  Besides that, it is as tragic as any old Greek
play, only more humerous.</P>
<P>NOTE: Note how I didn't make one lame joke about this film's relation to
Woody Allen...oh darn...</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
