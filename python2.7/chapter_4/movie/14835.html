# [film] "The Avengers"
A Postview, copyright 1998, P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>Insufferably mannered twerp (Fiennes) and fashion victim (Thurman) are 
supposedly secret agents set out to stop weather-controlling madman 
(Connery).  Despite the obvious charisma imbalance, the dearest wishes of 
the audience and severe editing, they succeed.  Bugger.</P>
<P>"One should never fear getting wet," slathers nerdish supervillian Connery 
to lust-thang and world's least plausible scientist Thurman.  But he's 
forgotten that absolutely everyone is wet in this soggy, lumpish remake of 
the cult TV series.  For those who came in late: "The Avengers" were a duo 
of elegantly stylish superspies who nonchalantly dispatched grave threats 
to British (and global) security every week.  Never mind that the plot 
quickly degenerated into a parody of themselves, a disjointed haiku of 
illogical setpieces, non-sequiturs, and contrived sequences:</P>
<PRE>   Steed arrives, a job 
   A plot, a fight, catsuit kick 
   Well done Em, some tea?</PRE>
<P>But it was fun, and you might think it was ripe for a remake, or a 
reinvention (a la "Lost In Space").  Of course, you might also think that 
my grandmother was a tap-dancing Martian.  For "The Avengers" (or as we 
might call it "The English Patient 2", except in this case the patient is 
the film, DOA) is a dreary, incoherent mess.</P>
<P>It's not easy to say just what's wrong with this film, because everything 
is wrong.  We meet Ralph Fiennes as the ultradangerous agent John Steed.  
Dangerous, because you fear that at any moment he will don an anorak and 
start to talk earnestly about trainspotting.  He's on the job because the 
hightech satellite system that (stifle your laughter) controls Britain's 
weather has been sabotaged.  Could it be the work of Dr Peel, the insectile 
method nymphet Uma Thurman?  No, her mission is to use up the stockpile of 
blue eye-shadow left over from the 1960s.  So after some single entendres, 
our dull duo are off.  And then they're off to solve the case.</P>
<P>They go to talk to the eccentric Sir August, who turns out to be a toupee 
with Sean Connery hiding underneath.  After he and Uma engage in some 
sub-"Carry On" sexual banter, Fiennes is attacked by August's strangely 
silent minions.  You might think that these henchmen say nothing because 
they are actually the set carpenters, hauled on to fill in the gaping 
crevasses in the screenplay.  No, they are silent because they have been 
struck dumb by the quality of dialogue around.  In fact, one minion 
suddenly develops stigmata during one of Fiennes and Thurman's romantic 
clinches.  *thinks* No, just a moment, that was me.</P>
<P>There's a twin of Emma Peel running around at this point.  No, they never 
explain this.</P>
<P>The baddies drop a map so our tepid twosome can find the secret lair.  
Connery meets with his cohorts, who are all dressed in (I kid you not) 
brightly coloured teddy bear suits.  Connery explains this is so no-one can 
be recognised, and I find that explanation strangely plausible.  Fiennes 
and Thurman try to spark their areactive screen chemistry, but (alas) there 
is no catalyst that powerful.  However Uma strains so hard that you can 
actually see her _trying to remember her lines_!  Dispirited by their 
failure, the comatose couple are forced to reveal that the real mastermind 
is the co-head of their organisation, the blind (and strangely like a 
Thunderbird) Father.</P>
<P>There's that twin again.  What is that all about?</P>
<P>Connery, determined to never work again, dons a kilt and threatens the 
leaders of the free world.  Just what the leaders of the free world are 
doing in London, is never explained.  I guess after Connery buries London 
in snow, they bugger off home.  ("Sod this English weather.")  Uma decides 
that the only way to get to the bottom of things is to don a red catsuit 
with leather hotpants (which looks much worse than you can possibly 
imagine) and get captured.  While captured she begins to hallucinate, 
making the audience very jealous.  But Ralph and her get together again and 
the movie flickers to life briefly as they go mano-a-mano with Connery and 
his henchman.  (That's hench-man.  One.  Count 'em, one.  Ohh, it's just so 
horrible.)</P>
<P>"Still suspicious?"  apostrophises Uma.  "Just wondering if you bought me 
here under false pretenses," winces Ralph.  And the audience can then cry 
out, "Yes, yes, oh yes!!"  Avoid this dull, unworthy mess.  [0/bomb] and a 
bad acid flashback on the Sid & Nancy scale.</P>
