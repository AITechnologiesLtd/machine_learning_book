<P>NOTTING HILL (1999) w/ Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant
Director: Roger Mitchell</P>
<P>The Thumbs for Sale! review by Roger Gerbig<HR></P>
<P>In passing, I've heard "Notting Hill"--the new Julia Roberts-Hugh
Grant luxury SUV-type vehicle currently parked at your local
multiplex--shows a lot of "Romantic Comedy 101" influence. After
leaving the theatre with these Thumbs! twitching more rapidly than Mr.
Grant's mug at the precipice of a nervous breakdown, I have to
disagree. I felt more like I'd just sat through a workshop for
"Romantic Comedy 404 - Advanced Studies in the Common Boy/Girl
Dilemma."</P>
<P>Which my ever-twitchy Thumbs! remind me is a good thing each time I
grope for the space bar.</P>
<P>Roberts is Anna Scott, world-wide superstar actress and platinum club
member of the jet set. Grant plays William Thacker, a slightly
impoverished bookstore owner and member of the "my best friend owns a
fast Peugeot wagon" set. While winning the lottery might be the most
appropriate life-changing event for Thacker, instead he is fated with
the experience of literally running into Scott and dousing them
both--enter the miracle of movie magic here--with what appears to be
about a gallon or so of orange juice. As their juice stains dry into
what appears to be mustard (British special effects technicians might
possibly have something to learn from "The Phantom Menace"), she
graciously accepts his offer to duck into his apartment to change
clothes.</P>
<P>And as they say in certain sports circles, "They're off and running!"
But fortunately, never too quickly. While the same writing/producing
team that gave us "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is clearly happy with
mining familiar territory ("Wedding's" director Mike Newell apparently
isn't, as he recently went down with that ship called "Pushing Tin".),
they've managed to make a film that unfolds with a leisurely pace and
treats its characters with remarkable decency.</P>
<P>Early on, there's a birthday party involving Thacker's friends,
family, and that certain movie star. As each character airs his or her
particular quirks (no shortage here), I was amazed at the deft hand
shown by the production team at large. Which is to say, you shouldn't,
as it's that well done. All too often today sparkling, witty dialogue
and blatant over-reaction are mistaken as hallmarks of truly inspired
writing. Here, they aren't, even though Thacker's little sister (Emma
Chambers) goes ballistic in proclaiming her absolute love for actress
Scott's work and persona, and the last brownie at dessert is auctioned
off to the person who tells the most pathetic story about him or
herself. In lesser hands, this scene could have been a disaster.</P>
<P>Since we've now clearly gotten the message that our little lovebirds
are probably going to be heading back to the nest at some point, it
must be time for a musical interlude, which for better or worse
happens. True, these misty-eyed excursions into Bob Seger-land often
send me on a search-and-destroy mission to the kitchen in order to
locate appropriate utensils for my ritual gagging ceremony. But here,
things are kept low-key enough (no Bob on the soundtrack either!) to
perhaps subliminally remind us that during real-life moments like
this, we're probably humming some little soundtrack to ourselves to
help preserve the moment.</P>
<P>I survived, and the eggbeater remained safely stowed in my backpack.</P>
<P>Not that there aren't a few quality moments of cliche (especially
toward the end), but they're more than mitigated by an abundance of
inventive and sometimes touching moments. This is, after all, a film
that successfully manages to pull off two Beavis & Butthead jokes
without the slightest twinge from the audience.</P>
<P>As for performances, I'm proud to say that for the first time I feel
compelled to break out the old "winning performance" moniker to
describe Julia Roberts in this film. Seemingly at all the right
moments, she shows an astounding vulnerability without resorting to
the old quivering lip trick. While she may never win the awards
bestowed on her character, I will say that all too often she's been
asked to carry films that are entirely too insubstantial for any actor
to salvage. That she's managed to take such heapings of negative
criticism and still avoid becoming an alumna of the Betty Ford clinic
certainly counts for something.</P>
<P>Hugh Grant, of course, really is the ultimate poster boy for your
average silver-screen nice guy. He's in perfect form here, having
apparently either sought hypnotherapy for his notorious tics, or
undergone a spiritual reevaluation of his art. Together he and Roberts
generate more than enough of that mythical chemistry to make this
flick work.</P>
<P>To sum it all up, I think it's fair to say since I only spent two out
of roughly 120 minutes biting my critic's lip on account
"questionable" moments, I think "Notting Hill's" a pretty solid value.
Now, if I could just sell my thumbs! for an eighteenth of what Julia
Roberts makes per picture...</P>
