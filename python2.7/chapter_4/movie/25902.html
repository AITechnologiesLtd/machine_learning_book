<PRE>                               LOVE & SEX
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     The good news: Movie is called Love & Sex.</PRE>
<PRE>     The bad news: Director of Love & Sex is a woman.</PRE>
<P>     But fear not the women's romantic comedy, gentle readers.  While
Love & Sex won't win any Oscars or many hearts, it's a capable movie
worth a chuckle or two.</P>
<P>     Famke Janssen (recently seen in X-Men) stars as Kate, a somewhat
hapless fashion-rag journalist looking for love in the big city of Los
Angeles.  Only she's "complicated," - and not to mention, like, eight
feet tall - so no guy "understands" her.  That is, except for artist
Adam (Swingers' Jon Favreau), a sort of L.A. version of a Woody Allen
neurotic, the kind of guy who obsesses over a woman, jumps out of the
relationship when it slows down, and of course immediately regrets his
decision.  Adam's stalker-like behavior with Kate becomes a focus for
the film, with the pair meeting periodically to tear out their
respective hair.</P>
<P>     First-time writer/director Valerie Breiman has made an often funny
but always scattered picture in Love & Sex.  Kate's endless
quest-for-love saga is pretty obviously drawn from Breiman's own life,
which probably explains why the movie is all over the map:  She's just
giving us the high points, the ones that might make for good jokes.</P>
<P>     To bad for Janssen that Favreau gets all the good lines. 
Singlehandedly he makes Love & Sex watchable, carrying it through the
rocky comic moments (first date, strip tease, etc.) and past the few
dramatic cliches these movies always seem to have (hint: she's
pregnant).  For her part, Janssen looks so much like Sandra Bullock in
this movie that it's disturbing.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Janssen and Favreau have enough chemistry to mostly
carry Love & Sex through its rocky moments... of which, there are quite
a few.</P>
