<P>   There's a difference between touring and a traveling, just
as there is a distinction between movie reviewing and film
criticism.  One is superficial, the other penetrating.  One
caters to the need for pure entertainment, the other feeds the
hunger for insights.  A sightseer is safely encapsulated in his
tour bus, knowing that he has reservations in a good hotel on
the next stop of his journey and that he can complain and
perhaps get a partial refund if anything goes wrong.  The
traveler shucks this very human desire for security in return
for a chance more deeply to experience new things,
emotionally as well as intellectually.  Predictability for the
traveler is immaterial, for the tourist, indispensable.  In Alex
Garland's eerie novel which has been adapted for the screen
by Danny Boyle ("Trainspotting"), Richard (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is a backpacker with a vengeance.  Most Lonely
Planet types travel in groups, stick together in youth hostels,
maybe smoke some dope, and aside from the poverty of their
surrounding are not that much different from tourists.  Richard
by contrast has made the trip from America alone (there's a
hint that his girl friend had just dumped him and he's out to
leave the past behind), deplanes in Bangkok where he hasn't
the foggiest notion what he will do next, and by both
fortuitous and devastating serendipity meets up with crazy
Scot Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who has taken the room next to
his.</P>
<P>   Gaining possession of a secret map from the appropriately
named Daffy, Richard shares the information with some pals
he meets in the city and then goes off with a sexy French
couple, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume
Canet) to a remote island which you can be sure was never
seen by Aunt Betsy and Uncle Mort on their 30th anniversary
trip to the Far East.  There they discover a utopian
community of fellow pleasure-seekers, no one over the age of
35, led by queen bee Sal (Tilda Swinton)--who is adamant
about keeping the hideaway a secret from the rest of the
world.  This island Shangri-La is shared in much the way
that Haitians and Dominicans divide Hispaniola, except that
the fellows on the nether side of the island are gun-toting
marijuana farmers who strangely enough have allowed the
commune to remain for years.  Considering the attachment
that those surly local thugs have for their hidden expanse, the
most unbelievable aspect of the film is their willingness to
live and let live--provided that no additional Westerners
appear.  The brutality begins when a group of idiotic youth do
indeed approach the hideaway, though throughout Richard's
stay, events conspire to threaten the viability of the quixotic
community.</P>
<P>   John Hodge's screenplay advances a sexual relationship
that does not exist in the book and also converts the principal
character into an American rather than a Brit.  Director Boyle
moves Hodge's plot along smoothly from the pristine clear
waters of the beachfront vistas to the murky seas that snare
a group of pleasure-seeking youth.  The consensus of critics
is that the film is sharp enough during the initial half, as
Richard and his new pals find more pleasure in their trip than
any tourists with an extravagant Cook's booking possibly
could.  They get to jump into the turquoise waters of exotic
Thailand from a cliff higher than Acapulco's La Quebrada. 
Richard has the time of his life catching fish as our prehistoric
ancestors did and later in battling a shark to the death.  He
steals away the lovely Francoise from a young man who
shares her culture and language, and jaunts through
episodes experienced by fellows in other movies from "The
Blue Lagoon" to "Heart of Darkness."  Before some stoners
approach this paradise upsetting the balance of power
between the romantics of various cultures and the native drug
growers, the only problems seem to be what to do with a guy
who has been mauled by a shark (Sal rules that he cannot be
taken to the mainland lest the secret leak out) and how to
deal with the jealousies that inevitably arise in a closed
community where everyone knows his neighbor's every
move.  </P>
<P>   While Darius Khondji's lens takes in the taut DiCaprio body
and maturing face, "The Beach" does not unnecessarily
exploit the unique looks that make the superstar the
heartthrob of teenaged girls from Passaic to Port Moresby. 
DiCaprio holds his own with a fine performance, even
establishing a modicum of chemistry with the largely wasted
Ledoyen.  A surreal portion of the film toward the conclusion
featuring Leo as himself part of a hair-raising video game
recalls the fun of Tom Tykwer's "Run Lola Run" while giving
us in the audience a feeling of relief when we think, "Maybe
we did the right thing after all taking that American Express
tour of Paris."</P>
<P>   The film does give us insight into why so many of these
closely-knit communities ultimately fail: why the Israeli kibbutz
movement attracts only two percent of the population of that
country, why the Oneida Community in the United States
went belly-up, how the many communes founded during the
fun days of the late sixties and early seventies no longer
exist.  We can indeed go home again, and in fact our true
identities may be more in line with sitting at a computer
keyboard sipping latte than with experiencing our "natural
selves" in a shaggy, Club-Med style Garden of Eden.  "The
Beach" never really strays from the commercial track while
exploring its inhabitants' hopes and fears, but considering
that we in the audience can take it in without getting sand on
overheated feet makes the experience a worthy one indeed.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 118 minutes.  (C) 2000
