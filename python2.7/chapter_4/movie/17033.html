<PRE>SCRAPBOOK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In SCRAPBOOK, Curt Martin, a shy high school kid with average looks and
with a popular, older, high school brother, has recently won the lead in
the big school play.  He's been practicing his lines lately.  "Hi, my
name is Curt," he rehearses.  "Would you like to go get a cup of coffee
with me?"</P>
<P>No, these aren't lines from the play.  He quit, you see, when he learned
that his too helpful brother, Andy, had cut a deal with the teacher to
get Curt the lead.  Curt recently rejoined the play as the piano
accompanist, and the lines are intended for the play's female lead, Lisa
(Keili Lefkowitz), with whom he has fallen deeply in love.  So far, she
hasn't noticed him, but he's been trying to get up the courage to speak
to her.</P>
<P>First-time writer, director, editor and composer Kurt Kuenne does the
nearly impossible in his amazing, first piece of work.  He makes an
intelligent movie about high school that speaks seriously and movingly
to teen audiences as well as to parents and to moviegoers in general.
Although it does sometimes feel rather like an after-school special, the
movie reduced me to tears on many occasions as it considers genuine
subjects -- the joy of young love, what it means to be a brother,
falling into the wrong crowd -- that most movies reduce to clichés.</P>
<P>Gorgeously filmed by Dominique A. Faix in a sometimes-hazy glow, the
movie's look belies its lower budget.  The talented and emotive stars
have backgrounds mainly in television series.  Justin Urich from "Third
Rock from the Sun" plays Curt, and Eric Balfour from "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek" plays Andy.  Their performances are so
natural and honest that you'll swear at times that they aren't acting.
This means that their trials and tribulations will take on heightened
immediacy and importance as you experience the characters' lives with
them on the big screen.</P>
<P>At one point I got really angry at the movie, but then I realized that
my anger was misplaced.  It was just that Curt had done something
foolish, as kids will, and I was upset when he made such a major
mistake.  The script was fine, it was the character that was pulling at
my heart since Curt had become a surrogate son.  This sometimes joyous
and sometimes devastating film does not try to manipulate your emotions
for cheap laughs or tears.  It presents real adolescence, warts and all,
and that is what touches you deeply.</P>
<P>After Curt practices his lines for so long that he looks like he might
faint from lack of oxygen, his would-be girlfriend, Lisa, speaks to him
first.  It turns out she informs him sweetly but seriously, that his fly
is open.  The reserved Curt, who is one of the least articulate kids on
campus, surprises himself with a good answer.  "Why were you looking
there?" he asks with a big, awkward grin.  This turns out to be just the
icebreaker he needs.  Another precious scene occurs later when she
finally gets him to stop talking about kissing her and actually do it.</P>
<P>The delightfully sunny first act turns into a powerful second act that
delves deeply into the true meaning of the love and responsibilities of
brotherhood.  This is the part that movies almost totally ignore.  I
can't think of another film where the relationship between two brothers
brought me to tears, these being the bittersweet tears of joy.</P>
<P>High school is really about responsibility and decisions.  Peer pressure
and friendship issues are ones that confront teens every day.  Curt
falls in with a bad crowd, whose innocently begun pranks tend to go
horribly wrong.  Curt tells Andy that his friends are not a bunch of
criminals.  "They aren't criminals?" Andy mocks him.  "Excuse me,
they're legally challenged?" The film has so many good moral messages
that I hate to point them out, lest those who might most benefit from
them never see the picture.</P>
<P>The drama ends in a devastating third act.  The only problem with the
movie is that the ending needs some tightening up.  After a poignant and
perfect ending, the story drifts on a bit longer for no real purpose as
the filmmaker tries too hard to wrap up some of the small loose ends.
This is a minor criticism for such an incredible first movie.  Write his
name down, Kurt Kuenne, as you are going to hear a lot more about him if
there's any sense left in Hollywood.</P>
<P>SCRAPBOOK runs a little too long at 1:50.  It is not yet rated but will
probably be an R for some normal high school profanity, a little
violence and mature themes.  It can and should be seen by teenagers and
anyone older.</P>
