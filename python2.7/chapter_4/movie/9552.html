<P>The official summer movie season has begun -- in April, no less -- with
the release of "Volcano," the first big-budget disaster movie since, oh,
February's "Dante's Peak" ... also a film where eruption plays a major
role. Because "Peak" explored very similar territory sooner (and
better), "Volcano," while somewhat good on its own terms, pretty much
falls into a slight category: Same taste, less filling.</P>
<P>The movie's premise has potential -- a vent in the earth's plates has
allowed magma to begin rising towards the crust, scenic Los Angeles to
be exact. Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark, the head of an emergency
crew that's already on edge because of recent, intense quakes. It
certainly doesn't help matters that some strange activity in L.A.'s
underground has nuked a team of workers. We, of course, know why it's
hotter than hell down there.</P>
<P>Pretty seismologist Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) is called on by Roark to
help figure things out; she comments that a downtown spring has upped in
temperature, and it takes a geological event to make this happen. Before
too long, the implicit danger becomes blatantly obvious to the city, as
the La Brea Tap Pits spit out chunks of molten rock, setting fire to all
surroundings, and MacArthur Park begins, well, melting in the dark.</P>
<P>Roark's daughter (Gaby Hoffman) is badly burned in the mass confusion,
and sent to a local hospital with a dependable doctor (Jacqueline Kim)
who happens to be on the scene treating injured firemen. Roark and
Barnes meet up in all the ensuing commotion, and, with the help of
Roark's second-in-command (Don Cheadle) at the Emergency Management
command post, try to devise a plan to stop the stream of lava that's
flowing down Wilshire Boulevard.</P>
<P>The rest of the story clunks around as Los Angeles puts its diversity
aside and bands together to combat their natural enemy, and this is
where "Volcano" begins to fall apart. I really could have done without
the whole subplot which finds a white cop arresting a black citizen
because he's creating a nuisance in telling the police to help his
neighborhood out (references to Mark Fuhrman and the L.A. riots of a few
years back are used comedically here) -- it's extremely obvious that the
screenwriters are using mock racial tension solely for the purpose of a
ridiculous scene in which both men put their differences aside and work
together.</P>
<P>I think this is why I enjoyed "Dante's Peak" so much more. "Peak" knew
it was an E-ticket and provided adrenaline-pumping action scenes with
little plot or social relevance. Towards its end, "Volcano" tries to do
both -- explicitly so when a little boy, who's looking for his mother,
sees all of the ash-covered residents of Los Angeles and comments, "They
all look the same!" "Volcano" even features a dog leaping to safety,
which seems to be a staple for all recent disaster films.</P>
<P>Acting-wise, all is fine. Jones can play this kind of take-charge role
in his sleep, and he does it extremely well. Heche, a real find in
independent films, has likely found the part that will serve as her
breakthrough into the leading mainstream. And Cheadle, most recently
seen in "Rosewood," manages to steal most scenes he's in, even though
he's confined to a desk for the film's entire run.</P>
<P>Put all plotting flaws aside, though, and you have some great special
effects, and I suppose that this is the true reason to rush out and see
"Volcano;" after all, it wouldn't have been made without them, right?
(In one gruesome segment, a key character lands feet-first in lava and
slowly melts like the Wicked Witch of the West -- it looks so strange
and disturbing that I didn't know whether to laugh or be disgusted.) And
for the record, I'd rather watch lava turn the City of Angels into an
iferno than aliens blow up the White House any day.</P>
