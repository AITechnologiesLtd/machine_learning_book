<P>>From the master of suspense, "Psycho," is Alfred Hitchcock's most 
well-known, and widely considered, best film, a great feat for a 
relatively low-budget horror picture. It terrified audiences in 1960, 
and surprisingly, still holds up very well today. When I first viewed 
the entire film about four years ago, it really did scare me, and with 
my most recent viewing, it is still a powerful, unforgettable 
experience.</P>
<P>"Psycho," starts off from the point-of-view of Marion Crane (Janet 
Leigh), a young banker who, on her lunch breaks, often meets her 
long-time boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in a hotel room. Desperate 
to break free and be with him, she steals $40,000 in cash and goes on 
the lam, only to stop at the backwoods Bates Motel for the night, where, 
as everyone knows, she meets her ill-fated demise by being stabbed to 
death in the shower by a mysterious female figure. When the motel 
manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), whose invalid mother is always 
looking out the bedroom window of the house overlooking the motel, 
discovers Marion, he desperately disposes of the body by putting her in 
the trunk of her car and driving it into a nearby swamp. After missing 
for a week, Marion's older sister, Lila (Vera Miles), grows concerned 
and enlists the aid of both Sam and the police detective, Arbogast 
(Martin Balsam), to investigate the disappearance.</P>
<P>At the time of its release, "Psycho," was a highly courageous and 
explicit film, dealing with brutal murder, risque (in 1960) sexual 
situations, and the ideas of the Oedipal complex and transvesticism. In 
today's times, these elements are not nearly as shocking, but 
Hitchcock's "Psycho," is still a masterful, outstanding motion picture, 
and one of the best horror films I have ever seen, next to 1978's 
"Halloween." </P>
<P>The screenplay, by Joseph Stefano, which is also closely being used for 
the recent remake by Gus Van Sant, is way ahead of its time in both its 
dialogue and surprising construction. For those unfamiliar with the 
shower scene, it would come as a huge surprise that the character of 
Marion, who has been the main character from the start, dies within the 
first hour. There are two murder set-pieces in, "Psycho," and they are 
both dazzlingly executed. Without giving it away, the sequence with 
Arbogast on the staircase remains one of my favorite moments in any 
horror picture, old or new. The first time I saw it, I actually jumped 
in my seat, which is almost unthinkable for a film that was made in 
1960. All other horror movies, prior to, "Psycho," are simply not scary 
in today's time because audiences have become more adept to handle 
violence.</P>
<P>The character of the occasionally charming, partly threatening Norman 
Bates will always be associated with the late, great Anthony Perkins, 
who never had a role as memorable as this one, and he is perfect. Janet 
Leigh is outstanding as the film's anticlimactic heroine, and all of her 
early scenes, although not dealing with a horror aspect, manage to 
vibrantly come alive, thanks to her, and a scene involving a policeman, 
and another at a car dealership, are genuinely suspenseful.</P>
<P>The cinematography, which was nominated for an Oscar, consists of some 
of the most stylish black-and-white photography I have seen. It adds a 
great deal of atmosphere, foreboding, and mystery that might have very 
well been lost in color. And the flawless, eerie music score by Bernard 
Herrmann, which has been largely ripped-off since, is one of the most 
well-known scores in motion picture history. I simply could not imagine, 
"Psycho," without that music, with its striking orchestral chords that 
are able to send a shiver up your spine just listening to them. Again, 
no horror film score has been able to match it, besides John 
Carpenter's in "Halloween."</P>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock's, "Psycho," is a masterpiece in all senses of the 
word. As a horror film, it is a horrifying study in terror, and as film 
in general, it is a brilliant study in style and mood, as well as the 
darkest regions of a person's psyche. The fact that it holds up just as 
perfectly nearly forty years after it was made is a testament to 
Hitchcock's well-earned title, "The Master of Suspense." He was a 
"master," in more than one sense of the word, too. </P>
