<PRE>                             DOLORES CLAIBORNE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An unusual mother-daughter
          relationship is explored in a film that begins as
          an extremely downbeat character study but which
          eventually packs an emotional wallop.  This is good
          acting, particularly by Kathy Bates and Christopher
          Plummer, telling what eventually turns into a good
          story.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     A film as hard-going as DOLORES CLAIBORNE is in its first 85
minutes had better work particularly hard to redeem itself in its final
act.  We have a story that is relentlessly downbeat with uniformly
unpleasant characters.  One wonders how this tale could possibly come
out to make this dreary story worth the telling, or the sitting
through.  In fact, this turns out to be a surprisingly moving story
with some fairly powerful emotional overtones and perhaps it even hasa
hero.</P>
<P>     The film opens with two women struggling at the top of a
staircase.  Vera Donovan (played by Judy Parfitt) is thrown down a
flight of stairs and her housekeeper, Dolores Claiborne (Kathy Bates)
chases after her to see the results.  Finding Vera not yet dead Dolores
ransacks the kitchen to find the proper tool to finish the job.  She is
found there standing over the body, marble rolling pin in hand, ready
to strike a death blow, not realizing that the woman at her feet is
already dead from the fall.  And, as it turns out, this may not be the
first fall that Dolores arranged.  Her husband died in an apparent
accidental fall years earlier under very suspicious circumstances.
Police Detective John Mackey (played by Christopher Plummer) would like
to prove the woman with the rolling pin was indeed a multiple killer.</P>
<P>     The drama will have one more major character.  Selena St. George
(Jennifer Jason Leigh), daughter of Dolores Claiborne St. George--is a
successful magazine writer who comes to Bangor to help her mother and
to understand the situation.  In her first visit to her mother in many
years, Selena starts to delve into her mother's life of hard work and
harder knocks.  Dolores herself seems fixated on her own history and
slips all too easily into recollection of the past that intrude on the
present.</P>
<P>     Kathy Bates does a terrific job in the title role, an unglamorous
drudge with long-simmering angers and occasionally a sarcastic wit.
She effectively plays a woman whose personality has been mostly rubbed
away by disappointments and by the total lack of anyone to care for or
about her.  Jennifer Jason Leigh who played journalists with affected
nasal twangs in MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE and THE HUDSUCKER
PROXY, plays yet another journalist and curiously occasionally lapses
into the same nasal twang, though here it is hard to account for where
she might have picked it up.  I have always liked Christopher Plummer
as an actor with some range who is better than his roles.  But most
unusual is David Strathairn as Dolores's abusive husband.  His mild
personality has till now made him seem like another Henry Fonda.</P>
<P>     Director Taylor Hackford uses weather and sky conditions in
unusual ways in this film.  Flashbacks are signified by sunny skies.
Scenes filmed in the present are always shot under dismal gray skies.
Not only does this not make sense literally, it doesn't even make sense
symbolically since the events under the sunny skies seem just as dismal
as those under gray.  Just occasionally Gabriel Beristain's camera
gives us a startlingly colorful sky effect--always in flashbacks, of
course.  One sequence under a total solar eclipse brings a surprising
special effect into a story that at least on the surface does not seem
to need them.</P>
<P>     It is ironic, perhaps, that most of the best films based on
stories by horror writer Stephen King, tend not to be the ones based on
his horror stories.  Of the four best films based on his writing--I
would say subjectively that they were CARRIE, STAND BY ME, THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and DOLORES CLAIBORNE--only the first is based on
a horror story.  And I would rate DOLORES CLAIBORNE a low +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
