copyright 1998 R. L. Strong</PRE>
<P>Mandalay Entertainment presents a John McNaughton film. "Wild Things"

Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Robert Wagner, Carrie Snodgress,  and Bill
Murray. Written by Kem Nunn & Stephen Peters. Cinematography by Jeffrey
L. Kimball. Music by George S. Clinton. Production Design by Edward T.
McAvoy. Costume Design by Kimberly A. Tillman. Edited by Elena Maganini.

Bacon. Directed by John McNaughton a Columbia Pictures release.  Rated R</P>
<P>   John McNaughton has fashioned one of the most joyful and funniest
thrillers in the past decade. Taking a very skewed look at the trend
towards 'film noir', "Wild Things" does for the thriller genre what Wes
Craven's "Scream" did for horror. That being, reinventing the genre by
using it's conventions to laugh with us at the absurdity of it.</P>
<P>   "Wild Things" starts off with a tense, playfulness. Sam Lombardo
(Matt Dillon) is a guidance counselor at a local college in Florida. He
is a heartthrob for the female student body. He leads an assembly
introducing some students to the local detectives, Ray Duquette (Kevin
Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) for a discussion on Sex
Crimes. Tension mounts immediately when Suzie Toller leaves the
auditorium cursing on behalf of Duquette, (for what reason, we won't
learn until much later in the plot).</P>
<P>   The plot starts in earnest when Kelly Van Ryan (Denice Richards) and
her friend Nicole show up at Sam's home to wash his car (part of a
school credit program). Kelly has an obvious crush on Sam, and conspires
with her friend to be left alone with him.</P>
<P>   Events start to take a drastic turn when Sam is accused of rape. He
is suspended from his job, loses his home and is outcast from the port
town he lives.</P>
<P>   That's all of the plot that I'm going to reveal here. To give you any
more would be a great disservice to you. This is a film that has to be
savored and embraced. The performances are all top notch except for one.
Matt Dillon carries the film, with a marvelously subdued performance
that keeps you guessing as to the moral character of Sam Lombardo. Kevin
Bacon captures the angst and passion of a cop who is so disenchanted
with his job that he'd be willing to risk termination and possibly
prison to get out of it. The surprise performance is from up and comer
Neve Campbell. Having cut her teeth on the television series 'Party of
Five' and the films "SCREAM" and "SCREAM 2",  Ms. Campbell shows a rich
sense of drama and risk taking that most actresses would shy away from.</P>
<P>   The surprising supporting cast is a joy to watch. Seeing Theresa
Russell,  Robert Wagner  and Carrie Snodgress is only part of the magic
that "Wild Things" performs. The surprising and welcome cameo by Bill
Murray is one of the films most joyful and welcome surprises. His sleazy
attorney Ken Bowden is classic Murray, carrying the same screen
capturing quality of his earlier performances in "Caddyshack", "Mad Dog
& Glory" and "Groundhog Day". The standout performance here is from
newcomer Daphne Rubin-Vega. Cast as Det. Gloria Perez, Ms. Rubin-Vega
almost single-handedly holds the film from going over the edge into it's
sleazy undercurrent. Her performance is subtle and well defined and I
would be surprised if we don't see more of her in films to come, a
marvelous fresh new face. Additional credit must be given to director
John McNaughton, who handles this talented and diverse cast with all the
skill and dexterity of a Zubin Mehta holding sway over the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. The only false note in this film and a minor one is Denise
Richards. Her performance is not up to the caliber of the other cast
members, but she does try gamely. This being only her second major film,
Ms. Richards has a quality that captures the camera. While her
performance here is not as effectual as the others, it gives solid
evidence of a talent on the rise.</P>
<P>  The script by Kem Nunn & Stephen Peters is such a marvelously
constructed thriller, that the comedic qualities inherent in this genre
come to the forefront. This is what gives the film it's flow and energy.
Without that comedic touch, "Wild Things" would be only another in a
long line of dreary, generic erotic thrillers. The dialogue sparkles
with nuance and character, you almost feel that the lines are spoken
live and not rehearsed. While there is nothing here Tarrantino-like.
This is not dialogue that calls attention to itself. This is real people
speaking in the way people speak. Not everything is revealed in their
words, but is alluded to.</P>
<P>   The final kudos go to John McNaughton, who wrote and directed the
truly frightening "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer." and handled the
reigns of both "Mad Dog & Glory" and the under-rated "A Normal Life",
brings a true spirit of recklessness to the film. He knows when to punch
up the comedy and when to settle into suspense, sometimes crossing those
lines with such verve and skill that you can expect to be surprised come
Oscar time in '99.</P>
<P>   "Wild Things" is one of the most enjoyable films so far this year.
Hip, and knowingly so. But never so much so that it gives it's best
surprises away to it's audience without first winking at us. Just
remember to stay through the end credits for some very, very
entertaining  (and funny) tie ups to a  few loose ends.</P>
