<P>When Walkabout was released nearly thirty years ago, it was widely regarded
as a cinematic pièce de rèsistance. Roeg's lush photography combined with a
deceptively elemental story yielded a film of both intoxicating beauty and
relevance. Unabashedly advertised in the film's theatrical trailer as `the
most different movie you'll ever see,' Walkabout lives up to the appellation
by being Kubrickesque in its vivid imagery and openness to interpretation.
Roeg's film is primarily about existence at the margin and the nature of
communication. What surrounds the walls that we erect and can we exist
beyond them? Walkabout suggests that cultural coexistence may be a myth; our
lives are intrinsically inclined towards an indigenous domicile and its
native tongue binds us.</P>
<P>The theme of home emanates from Walkabout's lyric. The comforts that lie at
one's hearth are oftentimes immeasurable. One of my fondest memories of
growing up were days at camp, but there were always the first few days that
were spent terrified of my new habitat and much time was spent longing for
home. Eventually, one gets makes friends and adapts to the new environment,
and when the two or three weeks are over, we would give anything for another
week. Oftentimes Walkabout is interpreted as a `back to nature ' movie, but
the opposite is true. The children cannot accept the outback as a place
where people call home. There are times when the Girl and her brother seem
to adapt to their surroundings, but the acceptance of the Australian Outback
is tenuous at best. The Girl meticulously keeps her school outfit clean and
makes sure she looks presentable even in the desolate desert. She even wears
her bra throughout the journey, as if clinging to the icons of her
civilization would serve as a token of her existence. Once the Girl finds
the abandoned farm, the sight of her irrepressible relief reminds us that
she still longs for familiarity . For the Girl, there is never harmony
between her home and the outback; her travels with the Aborigine were
necessary means to an end. Though the film concludes with a sense of regret,
the Girl chooses to recollect her experiences as an image of happiness, but
not as an inspiration to break the cyclical monotony of her life.</P>
<P>Why is the acceptance of the outback so difficult for the Girl? Nicolas Roeg
sets up the answer to the question by presenting the idea of boundaries. Man
strives for convenience and packs everything that could be desired into
dense, over-populated cities. When the cities run out of space, skyscrapers
are erected to increase capacity. The conflict between nature and civilized
man is established in shots early in the film. While the family members are
coming home, we see shots of buildings amongst trees . The mise-en-scène of
these shots suggest a relationship between the organic and inorganic, and we
sense that their coexistence is unnatural.  Roeg comments: `All architecture
has [an artificiality]. No matter how much it is spoken about ‘it goes with
the trees…' It's artificial - whatever way you look at it. ' Another example
of this is also one of the more startling images in the film. The Father,
coming home after work, stands on the deck of their apartment and looks at
his children playing in the pool.  The POV shot is amusingly perverse; we
see the children playing in a pool by the ocean . Revenge by Mother Nature,
it seems, is exacted later in the film when the children reach an Edenic
oasis only to see the water dry up shortly after their arrival. The scene,
in a didactic way, seems to scold the children for their wasteful ways.
Juxtaposing organic elements with inorganic elements elucidate modern man's
vain efforts to exist in both a natural and synthetic world. Civilized man,
represented by the Father and the Girl, seem driven by solely by economies
of scale. And the cities become traps – walking home through a botanical
garden is no substitute for a forest just as swimming in a pool is no
substitute for the sea. At some point the Father realizes this. Trapped from
real experience, real transcendence, the Father takes his life and attempts
to spare his children of civilization's prison as well.</P>
<P>The opening sequence to Walkabout shows shots of brick walls which pan to
either the hubbub of Sydney or the bareness of the outback . Through these
shots, Roeg presents the viewer with the concept of boundaries. The wall
becomes a metaphor for the division between the resident and the
aboriginal – the civilized White and the primitive Black. The walls of the
modern man effectively keep the unwanted out, but to what extent are these
boundaries actually the self-imposed trappings of the civilized? Modern man
raves of technological progress, but the Father, the Girl, the Boy, and even
their automobile cannot survive in the an environment where the natives
thrive.</P>
<P>Walkabout explores what happens when the products of industrial civilization
are displaced to the margins of their familiar world. It is important to
note that the Girl is not dropped in the heart of the aboriginal land, but
in a border zone where two cultures meet.  Roeg makes this clear not only
through the shots of the brick wall which infer a line of demarcation
between two cultures, but also the frequent emissions of the radio, which
offers the impression that the children have not strayed far from the city.
On the flip side, though the land the children are in are certainly more
foreign to them than the Aborigine, he too, cast away from his home to
undertake the walkabout, is placed at the margins of his own society. This
subtlety should be recognized in that it relieves from the Aborigine the
burden of being a host; that is, he is on a journey of survival just as the
Girl and her brother are and he is under no obligation to play the role as a
guide for the children. In fact, in the end it is the Aborigine that does
not survive the walkabout. Their meeting takes place at a border zone where
the cultures of the city and the outback connect. By removing the schemata
of their familiar lives, Roeg presents cross-cultural communication in the
most fundamental context. Thus, what happens to the characters, which aptly
remain nameless throughout the film, becomes an allegorical tale of cultural
coexistence.</P>
<P>When the children first meet the Aborigine, the Girl unsuccessfully tries to
communicate with the Aborigine. `Water!' she cries repeatedly, `You must
understand. Anyone can understand that… I can't make it any simpler!' The
Aborigine looks in confusion. Finally, the Girl's' younger brother makes the
gesture to drink, and the Aborigine immediately understands, and shows them
how to draw water from the ground through a reed . Herein lies the
pessimistic undertone of the film. Roger Ebert wrote: `[Walkabout] suggests
that we all develop specific skills and talents in response to our
environment, but cannot easily function across a broader range. It is not
that the Girl cannot appreciate nature or that the [Aborigine] cannot
function outside of his training. It is that all of us are the captives of
environment and programming ' Continuing further along the lines of Ebert's
hypothesis, I would suggest that the fact that the Girl, who is fourteen,
cannot effectively communicate in comparison to her younger brother further
provides a subtle point. As all children look at the world with wonder and
curiosity, the little boy in Walkabout is a reminder of the plasticity of a
child's mind. Roeg feels that the boy's age of six is crucial because it is
the point where `one begins to form proper memories. Then at eight you start
worrying about school, then at nine, ten, eleven, [you worry about] exams .'
The boy's age, according to Roeg, is at a point where one still feels secure
and trusting, but the little boy is just at the cusp of loosing that
security . For the 14 year-old Girl, even necessity for water cannot impel
creativity. She has taken for granted the power of language, and is too
jaded to feel the need to communicate in any way other than English. Her 6
year-old brother, on the other hand, is able to communicate effectively not
because he is more intelligent, but because he has had less of the
environmental programming suggested by Ebert. Like some studies which show a
critical period in which a child can effectively learn language, in this
scene, Roeg presents the idea of a critical period of communication.
Sometime between the ages of the Girl and her brother, Roeg suggests our
programming is complete - even the common tongue of gesticulation then
eludes us, and our communicative abilities become hard-wired instead of
remaining dynamic.</P>
<P>In Shakespeare's The Tempest, Caliban, the beast-human slave of Prospero
cries: `You taught me language, and my profit on't Is, I know how to
curse. ' The power of communication is an important theme in literature.
Prospero taught Caliban language so that he could know when to chop wood or
pick berries, not so that he could engage in philosophical debate. Because
of the inherent power in bestowing language onto another, frequently lessons
in language become a source of domination over the pupil. Certainly, Friday
was quite enamored with Crusoe for enlightening him on the White Man's ways.
Subtly, this theme is explored in Walkabout. While the little boy is willing
to talk to the Aborigine in the Aboriginal tongue, the Girl, even near the
end of the film, still insists, `Water! Water!' However, her cries are no
longer the cries for help, but akin to orders for a slave . She commands the
Aborigine to fill a bucket from the fountain at the abandoned house while
she is just as capable of filling the bucket herself. The Aborigine takes
the bucket and softly replies, `Water.' The disappointment in the Aborigine'
s face is evident as he finds his sexual advances are met with the Girl's
callous indifference. Just like Prospero and Caliban, the language shared
between the Girl and the Aborigine are words of governance, not compassion.
Under the rubric of communication, we find that Roeg again suggests that
after a certain critical period, we no longer become receptive to subtleties
of communication. The POV shots of the Girl looking at the Aborigine's
buttocks and groin early on were the first indication of a sexual interest
between the two.  There is also an erotically suggestive shot of the tree
limbs and later a POV shot of the Aborigine juxtaposing the Girl's leg next
to a tree limb in his mind's eye . Yet tragically, because neither party can
articulate their attraction for one another, the relationship turns into one
that is more effortless for both of them but detrimental to their
coexistence; the Aborigine becomes the waterboy while the Girl retreats to
dreams of the city.</P>
<P>If there is an instance when Roeg lets us ponder the image of coexistence,
it is in the beautifully evocative swimming scene . We see the Girl and the
Aborigine existing, if just for a moment, in a temporary Eden. The
cross-cutting  between shots of the Girl swimming and the Aborigine hunting
carry a domestic proposition – the Girl is at home with nature while the
Aborigine, under the role of her husband, works to provide for the family.
The little boy follows the Aborigine to learn the ways of hunting. For this
moment, the Girl, the Aborigine, and the boy represent Everyman; stripped of
all pretext, they exist simply as God's children, and cultural barriers
cease to be. Jenny Agutter, who plays the Girl, recalls: `[Nicolas Roeg]
wanted it to be the most innocent and beautiful sequence of the film, which
[depicts] just their living. Because if they don't have that at this point,
then there is no regret at the end .'</P>
<P>It is regret at the end of Walkabout that is our indication that this is not
a ‘Back to Nature' story. Had it been such, the Girl would have stayed in
the outback, or would have at least altered her lifestyle when she returned
to the city. Roeg, however, shows us that the Girl gets married and lives in
the exact same apartment she did as a child. There are a couple jump cuts to
the brick wall, signaling her existence back within the boundaries of her
society. The situation is perverse because not only does she return from her
walkabout uninspired, she clings to the tokens of familiarity with increased
fervor. Living in the same block flat looking over the same pool - she even
marries a man who works in the same building as her father. The lessons
learned in the outback are lost and she has come full circle. It is
understood that one day the Girl, now a woman, will look over the deck at
her own kids playing in the pool by the ocean and realize like her father
before her, the sterility of their existence. Unlike her father, however,
she will be burdened by the memory of her moment of transcendence and how
she failed to grasp it.</P>
<P>Walkabout is not an indictment of industrialization or technology. The
barriers to communication were built with bricks from both sides of the
wall. The civilized trap themselves in a synthesized existence and the
primitive stodgily adhere to ways of the old. While the Girl could not find
solace outside her programmed environment, the Aborigine was equally
ineffective in coexisting with the Girl. The message in Walkabout, however,
is not entirely pessimistic. Though the final scene may be colored with
regret, we also notice the little boy, who must now be a young man, missing
from the scene. Perhaps there is a period in one's life where one can still
be enlightened. Roeg leaves the possibility that somewhere out there the boy
exists, and carrying the lessons learned on the happy highways of his youth,
he continues to wonder, communicate, and coexist with all people. We hold
within ourselves the similar hope that we shall never lose such ability to
be inspired.</P>
