Re: #5 Laura</P>
<P>Continuing with the "movie list," here is number five of the ten 
films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite films. 
They are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest 
influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are 
favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again, which you 
can tell as you read each entry. Try to think of your own 
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of your
life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you live 
it, to know how things such as books and films and magazine 
articles alter your path in significant ways. Sometime last year 
the Sunday NYTimes "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how 
difficult it is to think of a movie that may have changed 
history. The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK. How silly. Each of the ten films listed here 
changed my history, and if I had not seen them, I would not 
have helped change history in the ways that I have. Films don't 
move masses. They move individuals who move masses.</P>
<P>5. "Laura" (1944) I was only eight when I first saw this 
mystery/romance, but that was enough to make me a life-long fan. 
It featured Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews and Clifton Webb and 
Vincent Price and Judith Anderson. It isn't the mystery that 
shook me up, but the romance. Gene Tierney is on my all-time 
list of gorgeous movie ladies, a very classy lady. I, of course, 
identified with Dana Andrews, who plays a detective who probably 
came from a working class family much like mine. While the high 
society types are sipping their wine and chewing on canapes, 
Andrews is playing with a handheld pinball game while he 
investigates "Laura's" murder. What knocked me out was that he 
winds up getting the classy lady once he finds out she has not 
been murdered after all. Impossible dreams can come true and in 
Laura there are two in combination. Throughout this era, there 
were hundreds of movies where the shopgirl winds up with the 
wordly man of means. This one was for me, the son of a 
coalminer. The theme song can still make me dreamy about Genie.</P>
