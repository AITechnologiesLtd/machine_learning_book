A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Sam Raimi</PRE>
<P>Written by: Scott B. Smith, from a novel by Smith</P>
<P>Ingredients: Rural town, folks who find 4.4 million dollars and hide it</P>
<P>Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Brent Briscoe, Bridget Fonda</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Near a rural Minnesota town, a morally upstanding married man, his
brother, and a friend stumble upon a crashed airplane filled with 4.4
million dollars. Instead of reporting it to the authorities, the men
decide to keep the money and keep the discovery a secret. After the
first lie is told, the situation snowballs into a web of lies, deceit,
murder, and betrayal.</P>
<P>Opinion:
I love the screenplay to this film; it's the material that classic
Alfred Hitchcock films are made of. Imagine, for example, a
salt-of-the-earth Jimmy Stewart kind of protagonist, and some cheerful
opening husband/wife scenes similar to Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE (1946). Now have the guy make a moral blunder and watch the bad
karma escalate into more lies, deceit, claustrophobia, and even a
murderous cover up until the situation finally unravels into a
tumultuous ending. This is the kind of classic A SIMPLE PLAN might have
been.</P>
<P>A SIMPLE PLAN however, doesn't take this approach. In director Sam
Raimi's interpretation, the movie becomes a slow paced, cautionary farm
tale that uses too many interspersed scenes of winter snow and rural
animals such as foxes and crows to supply suspense symbolically rather
than physically. And Instead of showing a lot of before/after contrast
as the protagonist's simple life becomes horribly derailed, A SIMPLE
PLAN slowly works its way into it - - for example, not showing idyllic
life with the wife until well after the 4.4 million is discovered. This
slows down the pace of the movie, and blurs the dramatic impact. </P>
<P>A SIMPLE PLAN is interesting, intelligent, and scenic, and features
superlative dramatic performances by the entire cast, especially Billy
Bob Thornton. If only A SIMPLE PLAN were done in the Hitchcock style it
would be a real classic, instead of merely a great acting performance.</P>
