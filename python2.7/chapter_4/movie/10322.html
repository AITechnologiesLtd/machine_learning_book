<P>     What to say about James Cameron's TITANIC?  Well, you certainly get
your money's worth.  $200 mil is right there, right up on the damn
screen, with a lavishly, expertly, meticulously recreated and nearly
full-size version of the great lady herself.  However it succeeds (or
fails) as a narrative, by golly Ms. Unsinkable Molly, you *do* get to
take that once-in-a-lifetime time-machine tour.  Up and down and around
we're guided, from stem to stern, in and out of staterooms, ball rooms,
dining halls, cargo holds, and even the boiler room.  (And, geez, will
you ever forget the sight of those massive pistons in the engine room?)
These endlessly fascinating period details are the film's greatest as-
set, guaranteed to hold your interest, no matter how expertly (or poor-
ly) Cameron handles both the characters and the story.  Well, that is,
*both* stories.  Not counting the curiously flat framing device-- a
modern-day deep-sea treasure hunt, starring Bill Paxton and featuring
Cameron's own footage (!) of the wreck itself-- TITANIC is actually
*two* movies in one.</P>
<P>     The first is a breezy but embarrassingly juvenile love story, about
a Third Class boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a First Class girl (Kate Win-
slet) and the forces that conspire to keep them apart.  (One of which is
her well-to-do but narrow-minded fiancee, Billy Zane, doing Snidely
Whiplash sans mustache.) JAMES CAMERON'S ROMEO AND JULIET runs about an
hour and a half and, if the teen romance doesn't strike a chord, you're
probably doomed to dwell on some of the worser aspects of the film:
corny dialogue, repetitive shots, weak supporting characters, a cloying
Celtic/New Age score, and, on most of the daylight exteriors, an odd and
presumably special effects-induced "haze." And, yet, even if you can't
believe it and run with it, those ninety or so minutes pass pretty
quickly because there *is* so much atmosphere to take in.  (Cameron
pulls out so many stops and delivers such an embarrassment of riches
that you really have to step back from stepping back to get cranky about
the stuff that sucks.)</P>
<P>     TITANIC-- not *The* Titanic.  Just Titanic-- is also a disaster
movie.  Perhaps the granddaddy of all disaster movies.  (Or, at the very
least, the granddaddy of all POSEIDON ADVENTURE remakes.)  Using compu-
ters and models and moving sets, Cameron successfully, believably,
astonishingly recreates *the* great failure of 20th Century technology.
Whatever the liabilities of the script-- and, oh God, there are so many
of them-- the images speak for themselves:  an elderly couple preparing
to drown together in bed, the ass end of a great ship rising higher and
higher into the air, the pained, pale expressions of lifeboat passen-
gers, wincing at the distant screams of the dying.  It's an hour of film
that has to be seen to be believed and, perhaps, be ultimately disap-
pointed by.  (In particular, the death throes are drawn out to an almost
comic extreme.  If you're in a sarcastic mood, comparisons to the for-
ever-and-a-day finale of SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL won't be far behind.)
But when we've returned to present day, our tears dried and the pains of
a poor script promptly forgotten, the likely reaction of any paying cus-
tomer will be, well, that they got their money's worth.  And, really,
isn't that the name of the game?</P>
