<P>     VANYA ON 42ND STREET may be the most innovative and successful
straight film adaptation of any play.  Eschewing the big-budget options
made available through the medium, Louis Malle's picture opts instead
for the exact opposite:  an intimate, unassuming view of a run through
of David Mamet's reworking of Anton Chekhov's UNCLE VANYA.</P>
<P>     The manner in which the play is framed is marvelously clever.
VANYA opens with the various actors and theater director Andre Gregory
walking the streets of New York.  One-by-one, they enter the run-down
New Amsterdam Theater, greet each other, engage in familiar banter, and
get ready to perform in front of a small audience.  When the film
transitions from dialogue between the actors to the actual play, the
switch is so subtle that it takes the audience a moment to realize what
has happened.</P>
<P>     In 1989, Gregory gathered a group of well-respected New York-based
actors to perform VANYA based on Mamet's new interpretation (complete
with his snappy dialogue).  Off-and-on for four years, the group
rehearsed together, often doing improvisations in a rented loft, and
giving performances for select groups.  Finally, Gregory and Wallace
Shawn approached Louis Malle (all three were involved in MY DINNER WITH
ANDRE) about making a film of the production.  Thus was born VANYA ON
42ND STREET.</P>
<P>     Excepting several transition sequences, the film is Chekhov's tale
of lost opportunities.  Those not familiar with UNCLE VANYA will find
the story alone a rich and rewarding experience--not only is this a
unique adaptation, but it does an excellent job conveying the issues,
emotions, and complex characters which make VANYA so potent.</P>
<P>     The play centers on a group of people (most of whom are related to
each other by blood or marriage) gathered on the Russian estate of
Professor Serybryakov (George Gaynes).  Joining the professor, a
supposed expert who really knows nothing, are his young, attractive
wife Yelena (Julianne Moore); the idealistic Doctor Astrov (Larry
Pine), whose lifelong passion is conserving the forests; Serybryakov's
intelligent-but-plain daughter, Sonya (Brooke Smith), who's in love
with the doctor; and Vanya (Wallace Shawn), a disillusioned and bitter
man who blames his life's losses on his brother-in-law.</P>
<P>     The familiarity of the cast with the material and each other is
apparent in the comfortable manner in which VANYA is presented.  The
play, as is often true of adaptations of Chekhov's work, is talky, and
the cast is populated with unhappy characters, but that doesn't stop
this from being an engrossing and surprisingly humorous tale.  The
perfectly timed, repeated interjections of "Oh, will you shut up!" are
responsible for a fair share of laughs.</P>
<P>     There isn't a weak performance.  In fact, there isn't a weak
moment.  Despite its many strengths, however, VANYA ON 42ND STREET
isn't for everyone.  It is, after all, a Russian play, with all the
qualities ascribed to that storytelling niche.  Issue-related and
character-centered, VANYA has what could best be described as a
minimalist plot.  Action-oriented viewers need not bother.
Nevertheless, for those seeking an amazing stage-to-film epiphany,
there is no better choice.</P>
