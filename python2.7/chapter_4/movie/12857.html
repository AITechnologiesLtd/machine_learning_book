<PRE>***1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>I didn't really expect very much when I rented Stuart Saves His
Family.  The movie bombed at the box office, and I had never really
liked the Saturday Night Live sketch on which the movie was based. My
real concern, though, was the general reputation of SNL-related movies
translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results(Half-Baked,
anyone?)</P>
<P>I was surprised to discover a truly entertaining, often hilarious yet
also touching little film.  It is an Al Franken production
through-and-through, who not only created the title character but also
wrote and starred in the picture. For those of you who don't know, Al
Franken plays a guy named Stuart Smalley, who has a really annoying show
on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem, etc.
Although not a licensed therapist, Stuart Smalley is, as the program
proudly boasts, "a graduate of several 12-step programs."</P>
<P>Stuart is doing well enough with his tv show, but he keeps getting
distracted by family troubles. Stuart's relatives are a mess: his dad
and brother(Harris Yulin and Vincent D'Onofrio, respectively)are
alcoholics, his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce,
and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems
by baking. Then, disaster strikes. </P>
<P>Stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his
show revoked. He is forced to move back in with his family after he can
no longer support himself, and there the comedy truly picks up.</P>
<P>Franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes,
but as sharply-drawn, real people. Although Smalley's dad has always
imbibed too much, Stuart can still recall times when his father seemed
like an okay guy. Also, after an accident towards the end of the movie,
both Stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than
previously thought.</P>
<P>Although filled with small, very funny scenes, Stuart Saves His Family
also has its share of dramatic moments, especially towards the
conclusion. For a lightweight comedy, it handles these scenes especially
well, often better than many so-called "serious dramas" of today. All
the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a Saturday Night Live
sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit.</P>
<P>If you feel like renting a comedy, and you haven't seen this film, I
definitely recommend you try this one out. You'll laugh...you'll
cry....it's all there.</P>
