<P>     Sexual taboos come in all shapes and forms -- bestiality, 
pedophilia, incest -- but none creates a more vivid image than that of 
necrophilia.  So, when I say that KISSED is the character study of a 
necrophiliac, recognize that this film is intended for a very select 
audience.  Anyone who feels incapable of watching a movie that deals 
frankly with this subject (even though it is, relatively speaking, 
tastefully approached) should steer clear of KISSED.  Director Lynne 
Stopkewich's feature is for adventurous movie-goers only.</P>
<P>     Of course, this isn't the first motion picture to broach this 
"forbidden" subject, but it approaches the material in a far more 
serious and compassionate fashion than anything I can remember.  And, as 
fundamentally unappealing as the concept of having sex with a corpse may 
be, KISSED manages the considerably difficult task of humanizing a 
character involved in this practice.  As a result, KISSED isn't nearly 
as difficult or disturbing a film as one might suppose from a plot 
description.</P>
<P>     The central figure in this movie is Sandra Larson (Molly Parker), a 
young woman who, by her own admission, has "always been fascinated by 
death -- the smell of it, the feel of it, and the stillness of it."  
When we first meet Sandra, she's a lonely adolescent (played by Natasha 
Morley) living her pre-teen years in an unnamed part of Canada during 
the early 1960s.  Sandra isn't like other girls, though.  While they 
play Spin the Bottle, she goes outside and holds ritual funerals for the 
small, dead animals she finds.  Part of her private burial ceremony 
includes rubbing the tiny corpse all over her own flesh.</P>
<P>     By the time she reaches college, Sandra has obtained a job working 
at a funeral home.  She takes classes in embalming, even though she 
believes that cadavers can still feel what's being done to them.  Her 
fascination with death leads her to engage in covert sexual activities 
with some of the more attractive corpses in her care.  When she meets a 
(living) man, Matt (Peter Outerbridge), who is fascinated by her fetish, 
she tries unsuccessfully to explain what it's like to him, calling it a 
transforming spiritual experience that's "glorious... overwhelming... 
and addictive."  Even though Matt doesn't fully understand Sandra's 
reasons, curiosity drives him to do what he can to insinuate himself 
into her private world.</P>
<P>     Playing a role in a movie of this nature is a risky proposition for 
an actor, so, for that reason alone, one has to admire the courage of 
both Molly Parker and Peter Outerbridge.  It helps, of course, that both 
present entirely believable performances and that they develop an 
effective rapport.  Parker, who bears a passing resemblance to American 
actress Moira Kelly, gives a slightly deeper reading than her co-star.  
She portrays Sandra as a loner whose unique perspective about life and 
death sets her apart from everyone else, except, perhaps, Matt.</P>
<P>     The hallmark of KISSED is its daring.  At its heart, however, this 
movie isn't really trying to shock or revolt its audiences.  It's 
telling a tender love story that just happens to include some 
exceptionally unconventional and controversial elements.  What 
Stopkewich does best here is to consistently avoid making the 
necrophilia gratuitous or exploitative.  Where he doesn't fully succeed 
is in conveying the spiritual rapture of Sandra's secret experiences -- 
the use of white light, for example, comes across as corny and 
unconvincing.  Sandra may have been transported to another plane, but 
the director didn't get me to share the trip.</P>
<P>     A great deal more could be written about this film, since, even at 
only eighty minutes in length, it never fails to challenge viewers.  For 
those who have trouble getting into, or dealing with, the primary 
subject matter, there are some interesting side issues.  I certainly 
learned a great deal about what goes on behind the scenes at a funeral 
parlor.  Nevertheless, for anyone capable of keeping an open mind, 
KISSED offers an unflinching perspective of a sweet, troubled love 
affair and the two warped individuals trapped in it.</P>
