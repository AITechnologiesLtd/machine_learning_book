<PRE>`Living Out Loud' - I am Woman, Hear Me Roar
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Judith (Holly Hunter) has been a devoted wife who was comfortable with
her life even if it meant sacrificing her friends and, for the most
part, being invisible to everyone except her husband.  But after 15
years of marriage, it's finally over.  He leaves her for a younger
woman.  She tries to suppress her anger like so many of us would, and
tries to pick up the pieces of her vulnerable life.   But, as you can
imagine, with all that hate and confusion simmering inside of a soul
filled with charity and love, it can be an immensely traumatic time
for her.  Judith is a genuinely kind person who routinely goes out of
her way to make others feel better, whether it's the bed-ridden
patient that she cares for or the elevator man in her apartment co-op
who has just recently experienced a death in the family.  But now she
is alone, and she needs to break free of her self-imprisonment.</P>
<P>She meets up with two individual that help to soften her hard edges
and help her to realize that there's more out there than remorse and
anguish.  One is Pat, the elevator man working in her 5th Avenue
apartment co-op (Danny DeVito).  He has gambling problems, a ruined
marriage and a dying child.  The grief that he experiences is not all
that different from Judith's.  Misery loves company, and they begin to
share some of their thoughts over cups of coffee, wine and precious
moments in the elevator.  A second influence is torch singer Liz
Bailey (Queen Latifah), who befriends her in a way a guide would when
you're on vacation.   She has a weakness for gentle, beautiful men
who, to her dismay, always turn out to be gay.  But that doesn't mean
that she will stop searching, and this philosophy is something that
Judith begins to pick up on.  There's no reason to live if you're only
going to live safe.  And Judith takes small but deliberate steps to
expand her world.  Among other things, she calls in a masseuse to give
her an erotic massage and also accompanies Liz to a lesbian nightclub
that looks like a German Expressionist's wet dream where Judith
discovers that her fantasies are not entirely beyond her reach.  </P>
<P>Holly Hunter turns in a nice performance as a meek woman looking for a
chance to forgive, break out and recapture her identity.  DeVito and
Latifah also turn in competent performances as they bring Judith more
in touch with herself as well as follow through on personal plans of
their own.  Yet, the movie never really achieves any kind of dramatic
oomph.  I also question some of the dialogue in the film, which
sparingly used the `F' word and gay bashed a little too much. This
film seems to cater to a 40+ crowd, but these elements, which left a
strange taste in my mouth, will probably be greeted with greater
disdain among that group.  Nonetheless, I appreciated the all-around
performances and am convinced that `Living Out Loud' is not such a bad
thing to do.</P>
