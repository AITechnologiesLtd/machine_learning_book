<P>     In the interest of full disclosure, I must preface my review of
"American Pie" by noting that I am a graduate of Forest Hills Central in
suburban Grand Rapids. That's the arch-rival school of East Grand Rapids
High, the alma mater of "Pie" author Adam Herz. As a transfer student,
however, I always thought the animosity between the two camps was based
entirely on jealousy. The only differences between FHC and EGR were FHC
kids lived in smaller homes, drove cheaper cars and spent a lot more
time acting like snobs than the East Grand Rapidians I knew.</P>
<P>Now EGR alumni have something else they can hold over FHC: They're
pretty funny. Despite its crass ad campaign and sleazy-sounding subject
matter, "Pie" turns out to be a generally amusing, somewhat honest
picture of the pressures put upon kids to become sexually active.
Despite a few gross-out gags and a corny wish-fulfillment finale, "Pie"
is closer to a "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" than it is to the infamous
"Porky's" trilogy.</P>
<P>What separates Herz's story from most films of this kind is its
depiction of young women, most of whom have some semblence of
intelligence and one of whom -- Jessica, warmly played by Natasha Lyonne
("Slums of Beverly Hills") -- is quietly fascinating in the way she
shares her hard-won wisdom with both her male and female friends. The
general rule in most of the adolescent sex comedies of the 1980s was to
objectify women as much as possible, preferrably by turning them into
strippers, hookers or frosty virgins. Herz isn't interested in playing
that game, and his movie is all the better for it.
 That's not to say that it breaks a lot of ground in other areas.
Although the jockish Oz (Chris Klein) eventually discovers he has a
heart, his buddies are mostly hormonally driven buffoons who would
rather die than face the prospect of going to college without a whit of
carnal knowledge. Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) has an undeserved reputation
as a world-class Casanova, Jim (Jason Biggs) has already humiliated
himself via the Internet and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) can't get past
"third base" with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid).</P>
<P>Though most of "Pie" consists of the quartet trying to get some
action before graduation, the movie also manages to touch on a lot of
little truths along the way, particularly when it focuses on the
communication gap between the sexes. Kevin and Vicky in particular have
all the classic "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus" problems and
Jessica sometimes seems to function as a translator, interpreting
manspeak into womanspeak and vice versa.</P>
<P>The most unusual aspect of "Pie"'s male characters is their desire
to please their partners instead of just scoring. Most of them come to
the realization that a woman's feelings ultimately figure into the
sexual equation, something no one ever gave a second thought to in the
"Porky's" era.</P>
<P>But lest you think "Pie" is a thoughtful meditation on young love,
it also dishes out plenty of jokes, some of them predictable (such as
the hot-to-trot exchange student) and some of them so outrageous you may
laugh in spite of yourself (the "pale ale," for example, and an
encounter with an apple pie one can only hope was deep-dish). Those who
know East Grand Rapids -- renamed East Grand Falls here -- will also
enjoy the movie's allusions to the city, including a hang-out that looks
suspiciously like Eastown's renowned Yesterdog and a Trailblazers logo
prominently featured in the school.
 The only downside of "Pie" is that its probable success at the box
office will almost certainly bring on a wave of shoddy imitations, much
as "Porky's" did in the mid-1980s. For those of us who survived "The
Last American Virgin," "School Spirit" and the unforgettable "Zapped!",
the prospect of another wave of such junk is about as appealing as
guzzling a cup of "pale ale."</P>
