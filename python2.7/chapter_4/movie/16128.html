<P>   With the rise of ethnic cheerleading over the past decade or so, it
has become fashionable to know "who you are," whether that means
finding out more about your racial, religious, ethnic or national
group or, in the case of people who are adopted to find out the
identities of their real parents.  Somehow, the theory goes, you
cannot be a complete person if you are not centered in all of these
ways: you will be plagued throughout your life, rudderless and adrift,
unless you can settle up on your singularity.  I don't buy this, but I
don't bury my head in the sand.  This is the current reality and is
probably the basis for Paul Quinn's intriguing film, "This is My
Father."  The picture moves forward at a snail's pace, perhaps because
plot takes a distant second to character, though despite its lingering
pace, the film never becomes truly languid.  Featuring some major
stars and introducing a fetching new personality, Moya Farrelly, "This
is My Father" tells the story of a man who is a burnt-out high-school
teacher, not married, who seems to spend considerable time with his
sister, his nephew, and his stroke- ridden mother in a Chicago suburb.
Paul Quinn, its writer and director, takes us from a present-day
American scene to the Emerald Isle as Kieran Johnson (James Caan),
having accidentally discovered a sixty-year-old letter written by a
father he never knew to his mother, suddenly determines to go to his
ancestral home in Ireland to find out more about his heritage.</P>
<P>   What Kieran finds when travels to his dad's old home village with
his rebellious, adolescent nephew Jack (Jacob Tierney), is more than
he bargained for.  A village being a village, Kieran has little
trouble finding an elderly woman in the bed-and-breakfast place he
settles into, Mrs. Kearney (Moira Deady), who knows all about Kieran's
dad.  As young Jack forms a friendship with two local girls his own
age, a rapport which will revitalize his own life, Kieran listens over
several days to Mrs. Kearney's tale while Seamus (Colm Meaney), the
owner of the B&B and Mrs. Kearney's son, collects a storyteller's fee
of twenty Irish pounds.</P>
<P>   Director Quinn takes us back to the late thirties, a time that
Mrs. Kearney believes was better because then you rarely heard about
murders.  But in describing the characters of the town, people who
were anything but the almost unanimously cordial folks in Kirk Jones's
picture "Waking Ned Devine," we wonder whether the village Ireland of
1939 could be described as a pleasant place to take root.  Its
characters include a frustrated Widow Flynn (Gina Moxley); a happy-go-
lucky girl liberated in a traditional society, Fiona (Moya Farrelly);
an ornery malcontent, Mrs. Madigan (Sheila Flitton) who is to put a
curse on Widow Flynn; and an assortment of people who are terrorized
by the hellfire sermons of the two priests, Father Mooney (Eamonn
Morrisey) and Father Quinn (Stephen Rea).  While the town has at least
two fine folks who take in a poor orphan lad and put him to work on
their farm, the hamlet houses anything but those dear hearts and
gentle people often portrayed by the drawings of Norman Rockwell.  The
core of the story is the relationship of Kieran O'Day (Aidan Quinn),
who is Kieran Johnson's long lost father, and the former's underage
girl friend, Fiona Flynn (Moya Farrelly).  Because Kieran is a poor
orphan many years older than Fiona and from a different social class,
their relationship does not enjoy the town's or the Church's
approbation.  Much of the humor of the story lies in writer-director
Quinn's obligatory ribbing of the Catholic Church, with the
unforgiving Fathers Mooney and Quinn who rail against "fornication"
and warn sinners of the eternal fires that await them.</P>
<P>   "This is My Father" carries some of the baggage usually conveyed in
stories of rural Ireland.  By way of comparison, Jim Kelley, the
good-news lottery official of Kirk Jones' "Waking Ned Devine" could be
compared with the brash American pilot-photographer, Eddie Sharp (John
Cusack), who transports his vivacious personality to Fiona and Kieran,
while the grouchy and vindictive Widow Flynn and Mrs.  Madigan could
be equated with that movie's spoilsport, Lizzy Quinn.  The town
doctor, John Maney (Donal Donnelly) is motivated by other than money
when making housecalls on Widow Flynn, and the town's brawling lads
have similar lust on their minds when they cut in on Kieran's
dance-hall date, Fiona.</P>
<P>   "This is My Father" interweaves a comic light spirit with
melancholy and ultimate tragedy so seamlessly that we scarcely are
aware of when one genre ends and the other takes root.  We leave the
two-hour sketch with a better understanding of why so many people left
their home countries (in this case rural Ireland) for American
shores--to escape religious harassment, clannish envy, and a feudal-
style backwardness.  This is a small, gentle movie with sincere,
heartfelt acting that will reinforce the stereotypical belief that the
Irish are the world's eminent storytellers.</P>
