<P>Near the end of Frank Capra's holiday classic, Its A Wonderful Life, George
Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is feeling down. He has devoted his life to others,
and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town, Bedford
Falls. Standing upon a bridge above stormy waters, he looks down,
contemplating suicide. He has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet, he has
done so much for others. As a young chap, his ambition was to leave his
hometown of Bedford Falls. But times and ambitions change. Things happen,
and he's stuck. His guardian angel is there, and shows him that...It's A
Wonderful Life. In a whirlwind tour of the town, George sees what life
would be like without him. He learns the moral lesson, that to live is a
gift. His earthly problems are solved. The climatic scene is a marvel.
Frank Capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by
every generation. Wonderful Life is one of the few pictures of times gone
by that seems as fresh, maybe fresher, then it did when it was first
released. Many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly.
But this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and
timing can mesh with first-rate acting, wit and suspense, glorious music,
and terrific set peices. The only even slightly dated scenes are those at
the begining in which God has a long chat with Clarence, George's guardian
angel. They aren't all that bad, but they remain corny and a little out of
place. Nevertheless, this is one film that deserves its place in time,
cinema history, and our hearts. It can be equally appreciated by anyone of
any age. Here is one genuine masterpeice, a classic that reaches heights
and ambitions near perfection. This crackling good mixture results in a
film which is at once funny, exciting, moving and uplifting. The film
itself is almost a reversal of the life of George Bailey -- there isn't too
much to it, but Capra and the gang (various screenwriters, composers,
actors) plumet the material to its fullest potential. The result is a film
-- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film --
that will always be remembered, celebrated, and loved. </P>
