<PRE>A Night to Remember (1958)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 95</PRE>
<P>Perhaps the best disaster film ever made, "A Night to
Remember" generally discards soap-opera subplots
in favor of authenticity.  Although there have been
many film attempts at depicting the sinking of the
'Titanic', and most made with bigger budgets, this
British production benefits from its source: The
book "A Night to Remember" by Walter Lord, who spent
many years exhaustively researching the disaster
and interviewing its survivors.  The result gives
the viewer the you-are-there feel of a documentary,
with ever-building tension as the ship's sinking
becomes imminent and the passengers begin to panic.</P>
<P>The 'unsinkable' Titanic was a British luxury ship,
carrying 2224 passengers on her maiden voyage across
the Atlantic.  As with the Hindenburg Zeppelin, it
was the biggest and best of its kind, making its
foundering all the more dramatic.  A series of human
errors led to an encounter with an iceberg, resulting
in a 300 foot gash below the water line.  The lifeboats
hold only 1200, but only about 700 will enter them,
due to disbelief and disorganization.</P>
<P>The enormous cast features over 200 speaking parts.
There are more heroes than villians.  Kenneth More
is the second officer, hastily organizing the lifeboat
launching and the post-sinking flotilla.  Captain
Smith (Laurence Naismith) is quick to recognize the
severity of the situation.  David McCallum tirelessly
telegraphs for help.  'Unsinkable' Molly Brown
(Tucker McGuire) leads the rescue of drowning passengers.
Anthony Bushell of the Carpathia rushes to the scene
to pick up survivors.  And there are a few villians,
mostly the clueless crew of a nearby ship watching and
misinterpreting the Titanic's sinking.  There are also
selfish passengers who save their own lives at the expense
of others.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Titanic's crew, while undeniably heroic,
is overly praised.  In particular, More is both fearless
and impervious to the freezing cold.  Much is made of
a newlywed couple blissfully refusing to seperate
instead of saving her life.  Some of the backdrops
showing the Titanic's sinking belie the budget ($1.7M).
But criticism seemes unimportant given the quality
of the Eric Ambler script, and Roy Ward Baker's
tight, unsentimental direction.</P>
