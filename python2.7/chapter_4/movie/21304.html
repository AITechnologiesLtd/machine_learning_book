<P>During the first few minutes of Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead,
you can't help thinking about the director's 1976 masterpiece Taxi
Driver.  The main character narrates the film from his job of driving
through the streets of New York City to music eerily similar to Bernard
Herrmann's Oscar-nominated score.  Although we are told that Dead is set
in the early 1990s, it becomes clear pretty quickly that not much has
changed in New York since 1976.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage (8mm) stars as Frank Pierce, an Emergency Medical Services
driver from Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital (or `Misery,' for
short) in Hell's Kitchen.  He's an insomniac and an alcoholic, a man
that has clearly lost his way since failing to save an asthmatic
16-year-old girl six months ago.  Everywhere he turns, Frank sees the
dead teen and hears her ask why he didn't rescue her.  Subsequently,
Frank has lost each of his patients since then and is desperate to find
a soul to save.  He admits that his role is `less about saving lives
than about bearing witness.'  He's probably a blast at parties.</P>
<P>At first, Frank is paired with Larry (John Goodman, The Big Lebowski), a
goofy ox that seems more concerned with his next meal than his next
patient.  After receiving a call from Dispatch (the voice is
Scorsese's), the two lackadaisically trudge up to the top floor of an
apartment building where an elderly man has suffered a severe heart
attack.  The man is clearly dead when they arrive, and Larry uses the
phone to call a doctor in order to get an official pronouncement of
death.  Frank continues to perform lifesaving techniques and is
eventually able to get a pulse.  It is here that Frank meets Mary Burke
(Patricia Arquette, Stigmata), the old man's comely daughter.</P>
<P>Frank and Larry drive the victim to Misery, and as they open its
emergency room doors they reveal an ER from hell.  There are more freaks
there than at a Jeff Foxworthy family reunion.  And it's not just the
cases – a crazy security guard threatens people trying to get help and a
nurse asks people to leave and die in another city.  Misery is on
diversion and refusing new admissions because of a rash of overdoses
resulting from a new street drug called Red Death.  But doctors
reluctantly agree to take the elderly patient from Frank and Larry.</P>
<P>The next night, Frank is paired with Marcus (Ving Rhames, Entrapment), a
religious man that tries in vain to pick up the female dispatcher (the
voice of Queen Latifah).  Marcus has a considerably more upbeat outlook
on life and tells Frank, `Help someone and you help yourself.'  The
problem is that Frank can't find anyone to help and hasn't been able to
for quite a while.  This line also evokes Taxi Driver's Wizard (Peter
Boyle) telling his co-worker Travis Bickle `You get a job. You become
the job.'  Their evening's shift is complete after witnessing the birth
of an Immaculate Conception and a resurrection.</P>
<P>As Frank drives around the depravity of New York's nighttime streets,
more of Taxi Driver's lines come to mind. `Someday a real rain will come
and wipe this scum off the streets.' `I think someone should just take
this city and just flush it down the f'in' toilet.'  And, probably most
fitting for our crazy insomniac, `The days go on and on.  They don't
end.  All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe
that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention; I believe that
one should become a person like other people.'</P>
<P>We slowly learn that Frank isn't much different than the junkies and
wackos he is supposed to be helping.  One schizophrenic man named Noel
(Marc Anthony, Big Night) wants to die but can't muster the courage to
off himself.  Like Noel, Frank wants to be fired from his job, but can't
quite quit on his own and resorts to frequently coming in late and
calling in sick in hopes of getting the boot.  Ultimately, in an ironic
turn, Frank is finally able to help someone, but his services are
rendered in a less-than-routine fashion.  The whole story takes place
over a span of three days.</P>
<P>Although Dead looks more like an Oliver Stone flick, comparisons to Taxi
Driver shouldn't come as a surprise.  Screenwriter Paul Schrader also
worked on Scorsese's Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ in
addition to Taxi Driver.  He adapted this script from the 1998 Joe
Connelly novel of the same name (Connelly was actually a medic for nine
years in New York).  Dead looks great and is brightly lensed by Robert
Richardson (The Horse Whisperer), with Scorsese's regular editor (Thelma
Schoonmaker) and production designer (Dante Ferretti) adding to the
fantastic appearance.  But the film is very uneven and leads Cage and
Arquette are really bad actors.  It seems like Cage is getting all of
the roles that Bruce Willis used to take, as he continues to demonstrate
that his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas was a big fluke.  I think a movie
about Marcus or psycho ambulance driver Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore, Saving
Private Ryan) would have been more interesting.</P>
