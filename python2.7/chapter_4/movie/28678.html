<PRE>"Swordfish" </PRE>
<P>Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) is a renegade spy who wants to finance his 
own brand of patriotic anti-terrorism. Years ago, the DEA established a 
secret slush fund to launder money used to seize and destroy illegal drugs. 
Now, with interest, the fund is worth $9.5 billion and Gabriel will do 
anything to grab it all in "Swordfish." </P>
<P>Producer Joel Silver, the driving force behind "Swordfish," takes an 
intriguing idea of a high tech super heist, mixes the talents of Travolta, 
Hugh Jackman ("X-Men") and Halle Berry (also "X-Men") and comes up with a 
mediocre thriller that moves briskly but goes no where. </P>
<P>Travolta's super spy Gabriel is an enigma. We first meet him as he 
pontificates over the plusses and minuses of the movie "Dog Day Afternoon." 
As he drinks his coffee, he tells his colleagues that Al Pacino's character 
didn't go far enough. If he started popping hostages, Gabriel explains, he 
could have gotten away Scott free - and get his boyfriend that sex change 
operation. We leave the confines of the coffee klatch and, in a whirlwind 
of activity, we find ourselves amidst an even grander hostage situation. 
The action goes, literally, ballistic as the police screw up the situation 
and force Gabriel and his crew to explode a bomb-laden hostage, to 
devastating effect. </P>
<P>This slickly explosive beginning turns to flashback as we go back to four 
days before. The vivacious Ginger (Halle Berry) pays a visit to 
down-on-his-luck Stanley (Hugh Jackman), a former computer hacker whose 
life was ruined when he was caught wreaking havoc on a secret FBI 
cyberspace surveillance operation. Ginger, as Gabriel's intermediary, 
offers Stanley $100,000 - and the hope of getting his daughter, Holly 
(Carmyn Grimes), back - just to talk to the man. </P>
<P>Stanley eventually agrees to take the job, for $10 million and his 
daughter, and begins to design the complicated worm program that will 
burrow into the banking system and disperse the billions to Gabriel's own 
secret accounts. Gabriel has a separate agenda, though, and isn't content 
with a covert break-in. The action comes back around to the opening hostage 
situation and Stanley faces death, destruction and the permanent loss of 
Holly. </P>
<P>"Swordfish" - I can only believe that the filmmakers selected the title 
from the old Marx brothers' speakeasy skit, as in "Whatsa da passaword?" - 
covers some new ground with it's high-tech heist, but mainly borrows from 
other actioners for its substance. "Die Hard" came to mind often, 
especially as the villain, Gabriel, declares his plan to get what he wants, 
then escape using a Houdini-like misdirection. It's another slick Joel 
Silver production that will make money, but keeps the viewer at arm's 
length. </P>
<P>A leaner looking John Travolta leads the cast of "Swordfish" and adds 
nothing special here. (At least, he avoids a repeat of his perf in 
"Battlefield Earth," thankfully.) Hugh Jackman, too, does not put much of a 
personality spin on his Stanley Jobson persona. Both actors are so closely 
tied to the various subplots they are never able to rise above the shallow 
surface of the story. Halle Berry looks pretty and sexy as Ginger, but has 
little to do but look good. (when she flashes the camera, topless, one of 
the members of the screening audience yelled out, "Thank you!") Most wasted 
is Vinnie Jones ("Snatch," "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels") as 
Gabriel's chief henchman, Marco. The soccer star-turned-actor has a great 
presence and, with his working-class English accent, can chew dialogue with 
the best. He is almost mute in "Swordfish," but for a brief moment toward 
the end which gave me unfounded hope. Don Cheadle is fine as the avenging 
FBI agent Roberts. Carmyn Grimes is notable as Stanley's daughter, Holly, 
while Sam Shepard does nothing as a corrupt, powerful senator. </P>
<P>Production values are first rate. The makers avoided using hackneyed 
computer effects, though the super high-tech workstation that Stanley uses 
reminds me, strangely, of the extremely low-tech set design in Terry 
Gilliam's "Brazil." Photography, particularly the action stuff, is ably 
handled by lenser Paul Cameron, who first joined director Dominic Sena on 
"Gone in 60 Seconds." Production designer Jeff Mann, another Sena 
collaborator, gives a slick, glitzy look to the sets. </P>
<P>The screenplay, by newcomer Skip Wood, has an incomplete feel to it. There 
is sparseness to the story that makes it seem bloated in trying to fill 90+ 
minutes of screen time. Of course, this could also be a product of slash 
and burn editing that left a good deal of the film on the cutting room 
floor. It's hard to tell, but the results are the same. I give "Swordfish" 
a C. </P>
