# [film] "The Truman Show"
A Postview, copyright p-m agapow 1998</PRE>
<P>Oh come on - you must have heard the plot of this one by now. A child is
raised from birth under the eyes of TV cameras, unaware that his entire
life is a top-rating television show.</P>
<P>"The Truman Show" has garnered a lot of prepublicity, albeit in a
passive manner and for entirely good reasons. Peter Weir is a skilled
director ("Fearless", "Witness", "Picnic at Hanging Rock" etc.). The
writer created the elegant "Gattaca". The central idea is one that has
probably occurred to everyone: What if the entire world is run for me?
How do I know it's all real? So "The Truman Show" arrives to some
expectations.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey, perhaps having learnt that less is more, is thankfully under
control and surprising good as the increasingly paranoid Truman. Ed
Harris gives a tour-de-force performance as Christof, the director of
"The Truman Show" who, although remote and clinical, clearly loves
Truman. And the central idea is dazzlingly realised. Truman's home town
is a hermetic environment, a physical virtual reality in which the stars
are stage lamps, the citizens line up in the morning at "first
positions", every encounter is orchestrated, and even the weather bends
to the whim of the director. A whole world of merchandising, Truman
T-shirts and Truman bars, follow and lead the TV show. It's a
breathtaking vision.</P>
<P>Which doesn't explain the nagging sense of disappointment when the
credits roll. What's wrong with this film? That's difficult to say. Half
of the problem, I think, is that the film assumes you know what it's
about from the very beginning. If someone were to watch "The Truman
Show" without any foreknowledge, I'd suspect they would be very puzzled
indeed and see a very different film to the one I saw. Relying on
knowledge of publicity is lazy at best.</P>
<P>The other half of the problem is that the script doesn't seem to know
what to do with its big setup. It has a story, but is not really about
anything. Is this a commentary about television and the media? If so,
it's a very muted one. The vast global audience watching Truman is shown
caring for his fate and cheering on his triumphs. It is only at the very
end that it dare be suggested that to them, Truman is not a person but
just entertainment. However, other possible interpretations have been
floated. Is it a metaphor for the relationship between humanity and God?
Maybe - director Christof acts fairly God-like. Is it a gloss on
paranoia and schizophrenia? Truman's behaviour lends some weight to this
theory. But still there's that feeling of uneasiness as if the film is
crying out to make a point or say something, but is being stifled. This
emptiness leads one - unfairly - to dwell on plot inconsistencies and
how clumsily the TV show is run. It becomes implausible that the
directors of Truman's life have stayed hidden from him for 30 years, so
oafish and blunt are their tricks. (The actors all have radio earphones,
yet blindly give themselves away where a few instructions from the
omniscient central control would have defused the situation. Their
search for Truman when he is lost totally shatters the illusion of the
programme, yet they hope to keep filming the show.) These are doubts
that should never occur to the viewer, and wouldn't have had the central
story been more engrossing.</P>
<P>In fact, "The Truman SHow" is an oddly pleasant and mild film, where one
would have expected an impactful or thoughtful one. It's still a good
film, but one that's good despite its realisation. [***/interesting] and
a reproduction of a good painting on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
