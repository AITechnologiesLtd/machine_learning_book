AMERICAN VIRGIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>With the enormous popularity of reality-based television shows and of 
teenage sex comedies, Jean Pierre Marois's AMERICAN VIRGIN would seem to 
have arrived at a perfect moment in time for its plot, a spoof of the 
live deflowering of a just turned 18-year-old virgin on a paid cable 
program.  Shot a few years back and shelved, the movie finally had a 
limited theatrical release earlier this year, when it was called LIVE 
VIRGIN, the same name as the fictional television show that it parodies.  </P>
<P>The trailer says that the movie stars "Mena Suvari of AMERICAN BEAUTY 
and AMERICAN PIE, and now of AMERICAN VIRGIN."  Do you think that the 
renaming of the video, about to be released to your video stores, to so 
mimic Suvari's more famous two roles might been have more than a 
coincidence?  Suvari mixes virginal innocence with resolute toughness.  
Her hair styles are clues to her moods.  When her hair is straight, she 
is a good girl, and, when it's curly, she isn't.</P>
<P>Opening with a starlet in a bikini who appears to be in the throws of 
sexual passion, the camera cuts back so that we can see the fakery 
involved.  An aide -- maybe he is called a "pusher" on a porn set -- is 
pushing her knees back and forth in order to simulate her undulating in 
sexual heat.  Porn producer and director Ronny (Robert Loggia) is 
calling the shots with wild flourishes.  He's the type of clichéd porn 
producer who likes to encourage his stars with comments like, "You give 
good toe, Baby."</P>
<P>Although he is married to an "actress" named Mitzi (Alexandra 
Wentworth), who is currently sore from her latest breast operation, 
Ronny doesn't want his daughter, Katrina (Suvari), to be any kind of 
actress.  "You're going to have a decent job and a decent life," he 
tells her in no uncertain terms.</P>
<P>Meanwhile over at a Jerry Springer-like, ambush TV show called The 
Quaint Show, hosted by someone named Quaint (Sally Kellerman), her guest 
is Ronny's rival producer, Joey (Bob Hoskins).   Dressed tackily in lime 
green coat, tie and shirt, Joey is about to announce his own 
get-rich-quick scheme.  He will have a medically-certified virgin, 
Katrina, have sex for the first time on pay TV.  But wait; there's more!  
Thanks to the miracles of interactive television, men all across America 
can experience the sexual event themselves in the privacy of their own 
homes.  All they have to do is don cheesy suits that appear to be 
leftovers from PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.</P>
<P>The plot has intentionally convoluted relationships among the 
characters.  Mitzi is Ronny's current wife, as well as Joey's ex.  
Katrina wouldn't be a virgin at all except she thinks, incorrectly, that 
her boyfriend, who is Quaint's son and production assistant, cheated on 
her.  </P>
<P>The film is a hard-driving parody.  With Ronny ready to kill Joey if he 
doesn't call it off, the two scream all of their many shrill 
interchanges with each other.</P>
<P>It is an intentionally over-the-top film that skewers every subject that 
it brings up.  Nothing is sacrosanct, but the "adult film industry" 
bears the brunt of the assault.  "If porn's good enough for you, it's 
good enough for me," Katrina tells her dad when he orders her not to go 
through with it.</P>
<P>Joey, who is the devil figure, promises Katrina the world if she'll just 
agree to do follow-up films.  She insists, however, that this is a 
one-time proposition.  Later, when she has him locked up, he promises 
her "the digital rights" to the show if she'll let him out.</P>
<P>"Listen, if this isn't art, I don't know what is," Joey yells to his 
field of fornicators, ready to do the pregame show before the big 
deflowerment.  Actually, given its premise, the movie is remarkably tame 
with little sex or nudity.  Mainly the actors just talk about sex, and, 
even then, the language is milder than you would expect.  AMERICAN PIE, 
for example, is much raunchier than AMERICAN VIRGIN.</P>
<P>AMERICAN VIRGIN is the sort of film that most viewers will either find 
ridiculously awful or outrageously funny.  My reaction proved, however, 
to be neither of these extremes.  Although I admired the director's 
audacious approach and was charmed by Suvari's performance in a badly 
underwritten role, I found that too many of the jokes came across flat.  
The result is a picture that's better than might be expected but not 
quite good enough to recommend.</P>
<P>AMERICAN VIRGIN runs a brisk 1:28.  It is rated R for sexual content, 
nudity and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers. </P>
