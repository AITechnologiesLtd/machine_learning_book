<P>Los Angeles is the city of angels, where the sun
always shines and the stars walk the streets; where
earthquakes and riots do little to phase the happy
lives of the smiling citizens.  But, according to two
new romantic comedies, the fair city has its share of
lonely young folk.  Whether they're single and looking
or stuck in dating hell, these twenty-somethings are
all searching for something better.</P>
<P>Valerie Breiman's Love & Sex is a
semi-autobiographical story of life in L.A.'s dating
game.  Famke Janssen plays Kate, a tall, attractive
magazine journalist who is forced to write a woman's
guide to love and sex in one day.  So, of course, Kate
turns to her own experiences for inspiration.</P>
<P>She has had her share of men, from a sixth-grade
sweetheart to a married maniac to her high-school
French teacher.  But only one lover ever has a real
impact upon Kate.  His name is Adam (Jon Favreau); an
artist with everyday looks and cozy charm.  Having
slept with only three women, he is intimidated by
Kate's sexual experience, but that is part of what
makes him her ideal man.  Soon, the two settle down
for what is the most genuine, meaningful and tough
relationship of Kate's life.</P>
<P>Love & Sex is not unlike many other recent
romantic-comedies, including the superior High
Fidelity.  But the film has a special charm because it
portrays the everyday moments of the lives people in
love.  For example, Kate isn't above farting in front
of Adam, and Adam doesn't mind making fun of her
abnormally large feet.</P>
<P>Famke Janssen, a former Bond-girl, is terrific as
Kate, proving to be as adept at humor as she is at
action (she also starred in this summer's X-Men).  Jon
Favreau makes an affable love interest, using his
everyman demeanor to its full effect.  And, after
helming a couple calamitous 80's T&A flicks ("Going
Overboard" and "Bikini Squad"), former actress Valerie
Breiman seems to be headed in the right direction. </P>
<P>Love & Sex isn't quite as witty or insightful as
Favreau's own Swingers, but, thanks to wonderful
performances by two young stars, it's an ideal date
flick.</P>
<P>Smiling Fish and Goat On Fire, on the other hand, is
an ideal movie for anyone, anytime, anywhere.  It was
shot in twelve days for a measly $40,000, but the film
has enough heart to make any low-budget limitations
invisible.  Smiling Fish could be this year's The
Brothers McMullen.</P>
<P>The title refers to the two names given to brothers
Chris and Tony, by their Native American grandmother,
to emphasize their contrasting personalities.  Chris
(Derick Martini) is a moody and often serious
accountant, earning the title Goat on Fire.  Tony
(Steven Martini) is a fun-loving, out-of-work actor;
always a Smiling Fish.</P>
<P>Chris' relationship with a long-time girlfriend is
disintegrating when he meets Anna (Rosemarie Addeo), a
beautiful Italian animal wrangler with whom he is
smitten.  He also befriends his boss' 80-year-old
uncle Clive (Bill Henderson), a retired sound man from
the glory days of the original African-American motion
picture studio.  With his knowledge of romance and
lessons of life, Clive becomes the emotional center of
the film.</P>
<P>Tony can't seem to go a day without attracting new
women, but his string ends when he falls for Kathy
(Christa Miller), his mail-carrier.  A single mother
with an outspoken young daughter, Kathy plans to move
back to Wyoming if her daughter doesn't get the role
on a TV show; a show that Tony is also trying out for.</P>
<P>Of all the relationships in the film, the strongest is
between Chris and Tony.  They live together in a nice
home, and share a strong bond that their romantic
relationships have never seemed to break.  Siblings
Derick and Steve Martini (who also co-wrote the film)
play off their real-life brotherhood wonderfully.</P>
<P>Smiling Fish and Goat On Fire, which is being
"presented" by longtime independent film supporter
Martin Scorsese, won the Discovery Award at the
Toronto Film Festival, and has been riding a wave of
deserving applause ever since.  It's a warm,
life-affirming film, which is more than can be said of
most so-called romantic comedies.    </P>
