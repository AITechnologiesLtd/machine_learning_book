<PRE>IN & OUT (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Bob Newhart, Gregory Jbara, Shalom Harlow, Dan

<P>You've all seen the previews: a suburban Indiana English teacher, Howard
Brackett (Kevin Kline), watches the Oscars with his fiancee to see one of
his old students get a Golden Boy for Best Actor, only to "out" him.  Back
in 1993, something like this almost happened when Tom Hanks won an Oscar
for his portrayal of a gay lawyer with AIDS and thanked his gay teacher
from High School.  Of course, he WAS "out" anyway, but this is a movie.</P>
<P>As the film goes on, the now totally insecure Howard, with his bow-tie,
perfect wardrobe, and love for Barbra Streisand and Ethel Merman, becomes
the big tabloid target of the moment.  He's especially hounded by one
reporter, played by Tom Selleck (sans moustache), who turns out to also be
gay, and is out to bring Howard out of the closet.  But Howard, who really
is gay as it turns out, is trying desperately to convince himself of that,
most notably in scenes involving a bachelor party gone to the Twilight
Zone, and an absolutely hysterical scene where he tries to become a man by
listening to "Increase Your Masculinity" tapes, which include a bit about
listening to Disco music and trying not to dance.  Of course, when I saw
this film, I stood up and danced along with Howard.  I guess I'm gay or
something.</P>
<P>The second half of the film, following a great twist I didn't think a film
like this would take, allows some of the supporting characters to blossom,
including Howard's fiancee, Emily (Joan Cusack), who goes completely beserk
(and won an Oscar Nomination for it); his two parents (the perfectly casted
Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley), who, um, try to understand; and the
old student, a bottle-blond stud named Cameron (Matt Dillon), who's dating
a thin model (Shalom Harlow), and is trying to make ammends for what he has
done.</P>
<P>The ending, a hilarious spoof on the films of Frank Capra, is further proof
of how funny this film can be, walking right on the edge between parody and
preachiness.  Some may say it's not funny or too message-y, but it's the
kind of old time audience rousing experiment that has a serious message but
never feels forced.</P>
<P>I'm actually surprised this kind of film would be made and distributed as a
light-hearted comedy.  It's the best thing to do with it, and you'd figure
that a major Hollywood distributor would axe the idea before it could even
be written.  It's a film that pokes fun at the whole idea that someone
being gay is actually an issue.  It's a film that jokes around with the
whole concept of "homophobia."  And yes, it's a riot.</P>
<P>It does this by being completely politically incorrect and taking
visciously hysterical stabs at everything homophobic.  One of the funnier
moments is one where the just somewhat neurotic High School principle (a
classic Bob Newhart) tries to say "homosexual" and gets there before he
says it.  Or another sequence where a group of jocks sit in the locker room
and try to make some kind of sense out of homophobia ("It's against, like,
nature...and indoor plumbing").  Screenwriter Paul Rudnick, a openly gay
man who also writes a hysterical column in Premiere Magaizine every month
under the psuedonym Libby Gellman-Waxner, has so much fun making fun of
everything that it's hard not to laugh.  His Oscar ceremony, featuring such
Best Actor Oscar nominations as Paul Newman for "Coot" and Steven Seagal
for "Snowball in Hell," is one of the many big hoots of the film.  In
short, Rudnick's script is a gem.</P>
<P>However, it doesn't try and be nasty against heterosexuals in anyway.  Paul
Rudnick takes a strictly lassez-faire approach to the homosexuality
controversy in America - it's as if he's looking at homosexuality and just
saying "Who the FUCK cares?"  And by presenting it as a light-hearted
comedy (I mean, Frank Oz directs - the man is incapable of melodrama), he
gives it a fun air, something that anyone, and I mean anyone, can enjoy.</P>
<P>"In & Out" is absolutely, definitely one of the funniest, most hysterical
films I've seen in a long while, at least the funniest to ever actually say
something about Americana.  I'd say it's the cinematic equivalent of that
great episode of "The Simpsons" where Homer finds out that a good friend of
his is in fact "ho-mo-sexual."  Like that show, it makes fun of all kinds
of stereotypes in life, and comes out as being completely hilarious and
never preachy.  And I almost literally laughed my ass off.  That has to
mean something.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
