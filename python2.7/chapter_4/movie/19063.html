<P>WADD: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes is an extremely
entertaining documentary that handles its 110 minutes without the
slightest hint of boredom. The film, by Cass Paley, has been making
its way around film festivals for several months now, and most
recently played the Florida Film Festival. The production is well
conceived probably due to an interesting motivation behind it. Similar
to the 1997 film, Boogie Nights, the story being related is an
intriguing one that constantly begs the question "What will happen
next?"</P>
<P>John C. Holmes was a small town boy that went on to become the first
major male pornographic star in the United States of America. As his
career advanced he became a constant substance abuser, a pathological
liar, and a household name all at the same time. Seeing his first
marriage end in divorce, Holmes married again and carried on numerous
affairs. He also became increasingly involved with crime. By his death
in the late 1980's, Holmes was living more of a soap opera than an
ordinary life. In WADD, the people closest to John, notably absent his
family, recall their experiences with the sex star. Director Cass
Paley regrets the absence of Holmes' family, but explains "I didn't
find any of John's family that would talk to us. His mother didn't
want to discuss it, his brother hung up on us." This has an adverse
impact on the film, but the presence of Holmes' wives and closer
friends almost entirely make up for his biological family's absence.
After seeing Boogie Nights, a film largely based on John C. Holmes,
Cass Paley decided to make this film. "[Boogie Nights] was interesting
film, I enjoyed it; but knew that a lot of what was there was
fantasized." Mr.  Paley explained. Going on, he said that he met the
pornography star once and "85having heard a lot of stories about John,
I wanted to know if these = were really true." So when Bill Amerson,
John's manager finally agreed, the film was set to be made. "And all
of the sudden one day I got a phone call and it was Bill and his voice
at the other of the phone goes 'it's time' and that's all that he
said." Mr. Paley enthusiastically recollects.</P>
<P>Several of the scenes in WADD are easily recognizable from Boogie
Nights. One such scene pits Holmes and his director Bob Chinn being
interviewed together.  After Holmes explains at length that he enjoys
working with Chinn because he is allowed to block his own sex scenes,
the director flat out denies the entire practice. This brings a
certain comedic light to the film that is a pleasant surprise, yet
makes a point about Holmes' less than honest nature as well.</P>
<P>WADD does include several clips from Holmes' movies. However, this is
a far cry from pornography and would be considered family material if
compared to Hollywood films like 8MM. "You can show it until you are
blue in the face, but I don't think the audience needs to see it."
Says Mr. Paley explaining the absence of hardcore nudity in his film.</P>
<P>One of the more interesting filmmaking techniques was showing a
contrast in people's opinion of Holmes by putting contradictory
remarks after each other.  Take for instance when several people
attest to how easy it was to work with him, the film immediately cuts
to another person's complaints about working with the star. This is
entertaining and interesting initially, but the concept loses its
charm after a while and becomes somewhat of a repetitive downside.</P>
<P>At the South by South West Film Festival, WADD won top honors for a
documentary feature. Reportedly the film has been received quite well
elsewhere. This trend should continue, as WADD is a well assembled and
intriguing examination of not just the man who practically founded
cinematic adult entertainment, but the industry he started as well.</P>
