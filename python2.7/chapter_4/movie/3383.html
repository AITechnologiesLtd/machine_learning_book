<PRE>Introduction
============</PRE>
<P>     Lots to see this weekend.  Some of what's new includes ANCHORESS,
DOLORES CLAIBORNE, EXOTICA, FEDERAL HILL, MARTHA AND ETHEL, MURIEL'S
WEDDING, MAJOR PAYNE, SATAN'S BREW, and TALL TALE: THE UNBELIEVABLE
ADVENTURES OF PECOS BILL.  Check local listings and, then on Monday
night, sit back and enjoy the most exciting evening of the year, when
Mujibur & Sirajul host the 67th Annual Academy Awards.</P>
<PRE>BYE BYE, LOVE                                       106 min. / Rated "PG"
=============</PRE>
<P>     The latest twist on the PARENTHOOD formula stars Paul Reiser,
Matthew Modine, and Randy Quaid as a trio of divorced dads trying to
adjust to the demands of dating.  The cast is extra-appealing, but the
film fails in so many ways that it hardly seems worth the trip.  (Said
problems range from extraneous plotting to oppressive product plugs.) If
there's a single reason to see this film, it's to catch Randy Quaid's
hilarious Blind Date From Hell with Janeane Garofalo (CLERKS).</P>
<PRE>     Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>DOLORES CLAIBORNE                                   131 min. / Rated "R"
=================</PRE>
<P>     Another one of the "good" Stephen King films, and a fine companion
piece to THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  Director Taylor Hackford (AN OFFICER
AND A GENTLEMAN) and writer Tony Gilroy expand the bestseller-- about a
feisty New England woman (Kathy Bates) facing her second accusation of
murder-- by introducing an adult daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who
does not appear in the novel.</P>
<P>     Purists may scoff, but the added conflict works.  Sure, the film
gets heavy-handed in spots--as well as a bit too tidy toward the
end--but the warmth of the source material still shines through.  A
fine showcase for the talents of the cast, which includes Christopher
Plummer as the local investigator.  Great cinematography by Gabriel
Beristain, too.</P>
<PRE>     TRIVIA:  By my count, this is the 34th adaptation of a Stephen King
              story for film or television.</PRE>
<PRE>     Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>MAJOR PAYNE                                                 Rated "PG-13"
===========</PRE>
<P>     Homey the Clown as a soldier.  That's the idea behind this silly,
rude, and ultimately hilarious comedy about a strict military officer
(Damon Wayans) assigned to a platoon of junior ROTC cadets.  What sounds
dangerously uplifting is really nothing more than two hours of Damon
Wayans spouting insults and excrement jokes.  Set in the same universe
as the Three Stooges-- where anything can happen and usually does-- this
is critic-proof comedy at its best.  Don't even bother to bring a brain.</P>
<PRE>     Based on THE PRIVATE WAR OF MAJOR BENSON (1955).</PRE>
<PRE>     Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>MAN OF THE HOUSE                                     98 min. / Rated "PG"
================</PRE>
<P>     Forget the ads that promise slapstick and silliness, Disney's MAN
OF THE HOUSE is really just a kiddie-drama about a single mom, her son,
and her fiance.  Farrah Fawcett is the mom, Jonathan Taylor Thomas is
the son, and they *both* sleepwalk through their parts.  Chevy Chase
plays the the fiance and he plays it straight.</P>
<P>    The story appears to have been written for an audience under twelve.
Parents may appreciate the refreshingly inoffensive story, but it's a
long sit for the rest of us.  Even us former Indian Guides.</P>
<PRE>    Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>MIAMI RHAPSODY                                    95 min. / Rated "PG-13"
==============</PRE>
<P>     Go see it.  First-time writer/director David Frankel has made his
own Woody Allen movie, albeit one with a younger cast and brighter
locales.  Forget WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, this is the Allen homage to beat!
Sarah Jessica Parker stars a young, single woman who becomes
increasingly neurotic as she discovers that everyone in her family is
having an affair.</P>
<P>     The plot is predictable, sure, but the tone is light, and the jokes
are fresh.  The superb supporting cast includes Gil Bellows, Antonio
Banderas, Kevin Pollak, Paul Mazursky, and, yes, Mia Farrow.</P>
<PRE>     I've seen it twice.</PRE>
<PRE>     Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>ROOMMATES                                           108 min. / Rated "PG"
=========</PRE>
<P>     Yet another mild drama, this one starring Peter Falk in heavy latex
as a ninety-something Polish immigrant who moves in with his 25 y.o.
medical student grandson (D. B. Sweeney).  Though Falk is fun to watch,
there isn't much of an edge to the story.  Characters come and go,
situations happen, and each person gets fleshed out just enough to be
interesting, but not necessarily engrossing.  Tastefully directed by
Peter Yates (BREAKING AWAY).</P>
<PRE>     Grade: B</PRE>
<PRE>SHALLOW GRAVE                                                  Not Rated
=============</PRE>
<P>     Three flat-mates, one body, and a suitcase full of money are the
motivations behind this tepid thriller from Scotland.  Director Danny
Boyle has visual style to spare, but his characters are too unappealing
to be interesting.  How can you care about people that you don't even
like to watch?  Grisly fun in spots; quite boring the rest of the time.</P>
