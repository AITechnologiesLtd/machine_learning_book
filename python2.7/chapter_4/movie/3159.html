<PRE>                                 DISCLOSURE
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     DISCLOSURE has Michael Douglas essentially reprising his roles
from FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT; for some reason he seems to
be incredibly attractive to successful, dangerous women.  Here his
pursuer is played by Demi Moore.</P>
<P>     The film is badly miscast.  It is supposed to be taking place in a
high-tech company developing virtual reality technology, but no manager
in it is anything like a person who would be involved in such a
company.  Demi Moore particularly stands out as an oddball.  Tight
skirts, aggressive attitude, polished manner reminiscent of someone
selling real estate--this is nothing like what these companies are
like.  Donald Sutherland is also similarly odd.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas is also oddly not suited to his role.  He can
certainly play the object of desire, but as a technical manager he
doesn't make sense.</P>
<P>     Dennis Miller has a small, promising role.  I think he has good
potential as an actor.  His sardonic style leavened with flashes of wit
gives him quite a bit of range.</P>
<P>     But I think the most glaring error in the film is in the
direction.  Certain things are simply not established well, or are
allowed to run on in the wrong way; the interaction between Douglas and
Moore in particular, and the relationship between Sutherland and
Moore.  Is she being promoted simply as a replacement for Douglas, and
why--since she is demonstrably incompetent?  Certain behaviors do not
make sense, like Douglas's secretary continually turning around to see
what's going on in her boss's office.  A competent secretary would not
do this.</P>
<P>     It wasn't until after the film was over that I realized that I had
no idea why what happened happened.  Was Demi Moore's attempted
seduction a calculated attempt to get Michael Douglas fired and, if so,
how?  Was she put up to it by Donald Sutherland?  What was really
supposed to be going on in this film?  Either the direction or the
editing left something seriously missing from this film.</P>
<P>     The preview for the film gave me the impression that there was
some nifty high tech secret underlying the main plot; this is not
true.  The surface plot is all there is, with some fairly vanilla
high-tech virtual-reality stuff thrown in.</P>
