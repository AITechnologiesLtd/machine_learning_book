<PRE>LITTLE NICKY
------------</PRE>
<P>After a 10,000 year rule, Satan (Harvey Keitel) decides to stay on the throne
instead of turning it over to one of his three sons.  That's fine by Little
Nicky (Adam Sandler), but not his brothers Adrian (Rhys Ifans, "Notting Hill")
and Cassius (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Jr.), who decide to leave their hellish
home and create their own on Earth.  Their departure freezes the gates of 
hell, causing Papa demon to begin to decompose, so it's up to Little Nicky
to save the world and his dad by returning his two brothers to Hell.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Adam Sandler movies are definitely an 'acquired' taste.  I've always found 
him likeable, even in his subpar outings ("The Wedding Singer" is really the 
only of his films that succeeds outside of his own genre).  While that's the 
case here as well, "Little Nicky" is otherwise so torturously awful that it 
makes one wonder how the highly paid Sandler could foist such bogus product 
into the marketplace.</P>
<P>This is the type of comedy that attempts to get yucks by having Hitler
appear in a French maid's outfit to have Satan place a pineapple where the 
sun don't shine.  The 'story' is just a long, drawn out 90 minute affair of 
having Nicky learn to do human things like eat (Popeye's Chicken is Sandler's 
fast food product placement of choice in this outing) and sleep,
and attempt to get his more powerful, smarter brothers info a magical flask
aided by Beefy, a talking demon bulldog (voice of Robert Smigel).  He also
falls in love with an awkward design student (Patricia Arquette) and ends
up with a roommate, Todd (Allen Covert, "Big Daddy"), implied to be gay
(more uproariousness!).</P>
<P>It's amazing to see all the misguided people who show up in this clunker.
First there's the seemingly brilliant casting of Keitel, who's never been
more dreadful.  His dad, Lucifer, is played by Rodney Dangerfield, milking
hoary laughs in a pitiful walk through.  Jon Lovitz appears as a sinner,
reminding us that any good performance he's gotten onto film must have
been an accident.  Michael McKean is the chief of police.  Quentin Tarantino
is a blind street preacher who 'smells' the devil (and overacts atrociously).
Clint Howard proves that he's the most shameless actor working
in film today.  Rob Schneider appears to repeat his 'you can do it'
encouragements from "The Waterboy."  Dana Carvey takes on Nicky on the
basketball court (amidst the real Harlem Globetrotters no less).  Carl
Weathers, Regis Philbin, Kevin Nealon, Ellen Cleghorne, Henry Winkler,
Ozzy Osbourne....what were they all thinking?  At least the terrifically
talented Reese Witherspoon provides a bubbly bright spot as a Valley Girlish
angel.</P>
<P>Technically the film averages out to mediocrity.  Hell's a blatant make
believe soundstage, costume is obvious, makeup nothing special.  Post dubbing
of dialogue appears to be synched incorrectly in several scenes.  Steven
Brill's (writer of all THREE Mighty Ducks movies) direction is pedestrian
at best.</P>
<P>There are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film (written by Tim Herlihy, Adam
Sandler and Steven Brill).  Nicky returns to hell whenever he dies, fairly
frequently and sometimes amusingly.  Sandler also gets a couple of laughs
from rock music references.  That's IT.</P>
<PRE>Concept 7-8.  Execution 0.</PRE>
