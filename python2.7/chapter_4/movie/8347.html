Army of Darkness (1993)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 70</PRE>
<P>"Army of Darkness" is a black comedy.  The genre may appear to be
horror or action-adventure, but the whole movie is just one big wink
from the director to the audience.</P>
<P>Bruce Campbell, also the film's co-producer, is perfectly cast
as the hero Ash.  Ash is in a cabin in the woods with his girlfriend,
when he makes the mistake of opening "the book of the dead".
This awakens demons who kill his girlfriend, then invade his hand,
which he obliged to cut off with an ax.  All of this occurred in
an earlier film which I have not seen.  Army of Darkness is a
sequel.</P>
<P>If the above description is revolting to you, this movie may not be
for you.  While the movie has a large amount of violence and gore,
it is cartoonish in character.  It is something to laugh at, like
Bugs Bunny whacking the stooge with a mallet.</P>
<P>Ash somehow finds himself in Medieval England.  This is not
well explained, but explanations aren't relevant anyway.  The
British knights attack his car with lances, then drag Ash off as
an enemy of the people, condemned to die by getting shoved into
a pit full of demons.</P>
<P>But Ash proves very good at fighting demons.  He has anti-hero
qualities: he does good things, but for the wrong reasons.  Not
to save his people, or to restore justice, but for the fun of
it.  Ash likes nothing better than spearing, torching, and hacking
his enemy.  This is revealed not just by his actions but by
statements like "Let's Rock" and "Want some of this?".  Life is
boring when there are no battles to be fought.</P>
<P>Now Ash is the people's savior against the demons.  He is taken
to a castle and meets a prophet.  He is told that the book of 
dead must be retrieved from a forest controlled by demons, 
not just to return Ash to his own time, but to save the people 
from demonic ravages.  </P>
<P>After much bluster and a silly romance (he shows no interest in
the heroine until she slaps him), Ash goes to the forest to find 
the book.  There, he is beset by various evil, animated objects,
including miniature and full-size wicked versions of himself.
Ash takes a licking but keeps on ticking.  He has to repeat an
incantation before taking the book.  He says it wrong but takes the
book.</P>
<P>Ash returns to the castle to a hero's welcome, until he admits
he told the incantation wrong.  The prophet says that now the
dead will awaken to retrieve the book.  At first, Ash insists
on returning home, but, later coming to his senses, decides
to stay and lead the coming battle against the dead.</P>
<P>In the forest, cool animated skeletons arise from graves, sword
in hand, and march against the castle.  This leads to much 
humorous carnage on both sides, with the battle's momentum shifting 
between the defenders and the dead.  It becomes clear that the battle 
is really just between Ash and the dead's general, as all the other 
soldiers on both sides aren't good fighters and are just 
expendable extras.</P>
<P>The defenders hold the castle, and the skeletons are forced to
retreat.  Ash repeats a chant from the book to return him to his
own time.  Of course he says it wrong, and while he is back working
at his beloved S-mart, a demon returns with him, giving Ash a final 
opportunity for battle.</P>
