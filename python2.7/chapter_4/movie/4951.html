<P>While lack of food is the greatest concern on this planet, 
among affluent Americans there is too much to eat. This has 
led to an obsession. </P>
<P>People worry about their jobs, their income, politics, perhaps 
about the environment. But there's no common denominator like 
the fixation on food addiction, its causes, and the bad things 
it does to you. Especially within the large group that is the 
focus of Henry Jaglom's film EATING.</P>
<P>In an incessant stream of giggling arrivals bearing bizarre, 
California-culture, tension-relieving gifts, 38 women come to 
Helene's (Lisa Richards) for her 40th birthday. Most of them 
are younger than she is, and above-average in looks and 
figure. After all, this is Southern California, and the guests 
are in reality professional actresses. They also have heads 
which are probably filled with the helium of the balloons that 
festoon the house. Another reminder of where we are 
geographically.  </P>
<P>Some sanity is introduced by Helene's still-handsome mother. 
As played by Frances Bergen (Edgar Bergen's widow and 
Candice's progenitor), she is relatively wise. Otherwise 
almost everyone else is obsessed with body shape and with 
food. Some are secretly jealous of friends. All are openly 
envious of French guest Martine (Nelly Alard) who's been 
sunbathing topless by the pool. </P>
<P>"Why do French women have such fantastic bodies?" they wonder. 
The question is valid but also discriminatory. Writer-director 
Jaglom leaves out the millions of men of France who can pig 
out on cuisine and still stay trim. </P>
<P>Nominally, Martine is there to make a French TV documentary on 
Southern California behavior. Deep down, however, she shares 
the concerns of her American friends. Alternating between 
observing and filming, she is eventually drawn into 
participating. Adding her true feelings to those of others, 
she unexpectedly reveals her own insecurities. </P>
<P>Jaglom is an oddity, a maverick who works entirely by himself 
and whose subjects are Hollywood people. EATING looks like an 
eavesdropping, voyeuristic Candid Camera film, or at least 
like a theatrical exercise of actors improvising at playing 
ordinary people. In reality this is a very clever, phony 
movie, a "staged documentary" whose every word on cellulite is 
penned by Jaglom and every foot of celluloid is creatively 
edited. Yet the actors are most convincing as real people and 
Jaglom's dialogues are amazingly on target. What an ear, what 
notebooks the man must have! </P>
<P>The party and Martine's camera catalyze confidences, 
stock-taking and some shifts in relationships. Remember again, 
this is not a cross-section of America but a slice of Southern 
California. It is hard to sort out many of the guests, who are 
different people yet come from basic sets of molds. Hardly  
anyone is really interesting or has any dimensions beyond the 
talk of food. </P>
<P>The talk brings out connected subjects or worries, such as 
sex, aging, family relations, sex, marriage, ambitions, sex, 
abortions, breast implants, shrinks, sex, and endless 
trivia--but no matter what is said, everything still returns 
to and revolves around the sun of food. The fact that the 
trivia are non-trivial to the speakers intensifies Jaglom's 
irony.   </P>
<P>There have been rather few movies with food as their main 
star. Here is an incomplete list I have hastily compiled.  </P>
<P>Luis Bunuel's surreal THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 
(1972) where a dinner is always interrupted; Marco Ferreri's 
LA GRANDE BOUFFE (1973), where people gorged themselves 
literally to death; a grotesque restaurant sequence in MONTY 
PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE (1982); Paul Bartel's EATING 
RAOUL (1982); Juzo Itami's TAMPOPO (1986); Gabriel Axel's 
BABETTE'S FEAST (1987); Peter Greenaway's THE COOK, THE THIEF, 
HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER (1989). </P>
<P>Since 1990 and EATING we have also seen Jeunet and Caro's 
cannibalistic DELICATESSEN (1991); Alfonso Arau's romantic 
LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE (1992); Ang Lee's THE WEDDING BANQUET 
(1993) and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN (1994). </P>
<P>Interestingly, the great majority of those films have been 
notable, even outstanding. Most of them are humorous or black 
humorous, while only BABBETTE, LIKE WATER and EAT DRINK 
glorify cuisine.</P>
<P>EATING is a most satisfactory movie too, while, with its 
realistic, cinema-verite approach, it differs a great deal 
from titles above, except that it can be very funny. A random 
example. A woman, anxious to break into movies, asks her 
actress friend: "Do I have to sleep with someone to get a 
part?" There's a tiny pause before the reply: "How big a 
part?" </P>
<P>The movie proceeds from one little drama to the next.  All are 
ludicrous, most are comical, but some are funny-sad. A 
daughter reveals to her mother how the birth of her young 
sister Nancy drove her to compulsive eating and vomiting. She 
concludes with what cured her: "I finally threw up Nancy."</P>
<P>All this may not be everybody's cup of tea. Even when it is, 
some viewers may find it overlong. I did not. My main 
objection is that only unsophisticated fare is mentioned, 
chocolate chip cookies, baked potatoes and the like. Couldn't 
Jaglom have refined the bill of fare and added Burgundian 
specialties, pasta dishes, sauerbraten, mid-Eastern or Asian 
delicacies, Linzer, Sacher or Dobosch tortes? </P>
<P>EATING is somewhat better than just good. It gets my three and 
a quarter stars but will not get even a single one from 
Gourmet Magazine. </P>
