<P>"What Lies Beneath," directed by Academy Award winning filmmaker Robert 
Zemeckis (1994's "Forrest Gump"), is so very good in so many scenes that it 
almost makes you angry the movie is hampered by an uneven, flawed screenplay. 
In teaming with A-list actors Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, Zemeckis 
has set out to create a mature, sophisticated supernatural thriller, and his 
visual talents are consistently at the forefront of the picture. The movie is 
quietly taut, eerie, and deliberately paced, as it gradually builds momentum 
to a climactic twist that not only is difficult to swallow, but leaves a sour 
taste in your mouth once the end credits roll. Still, despite the 
disappointing finale, the film is undeniably suspenseful and beautiful to 
look at, and that is the complication with not being able to wholeheartedly 
recommend "What Lies Beneath." It does its job more than effectively, but, if 
the superbly paced first hour is any indication, it could have clearly turned 
out to be so much more than the cliched "Friday the 13th" knockoff it resorts 
to. </P>
<P>Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her husband, Dr. Norman Spencer 
(Harrison Ford), are a happily married couple living in an idyllic waterside 
home off the coast of Vermont. With their daughter Caitlin (Katharine Towne) 
away at college, and Norman often at work for long hours into the night, 
Claire suddenly find herself home alone for much of the time, without anyone 
to rely on her, and with little to get into. That is when she begins to 
witness doors opening and closing by themselves, and pictures abruptly 
falling. The bathtub keeps mysteriously filling up with water without anyone 
around to have done it, and the computer keeps getting turned on. Claire 
starts to suspect that their house is being haunted by a young, blonde woman 
who looks a great deal like herself, and with her next-door neighbor (Miranda 
Otto) having strangely disappeared, she thinks she knows the entity she is 
being visited by.</P>
<P>As is sometimes the unfortunate case in the thriller-horror genre, the setup 
of promised greater things to come is far stronger than the final outcome. 
Such is the trap that "What Lies Beneath" falls into. The opening sixty 
minutes, which is primarily a one-character show, as we follow Claire through 
her lingering days at the house by herself, and the increasingly supernatural 
and frightening things that begin to occur to her, is somewhat deceptive, for 
when twists and characters are brought up in the film, they disappear almost 
as quickly as they appear. And the plot development concerning Claire's 
suspicions about her neighbors is only present to bide its time while it 
turns up the fire and reveals its more complicated and extravagant (but not 
necessarily more successful) master plan. </P>
<P>With the exception of possibly 1992's "Batman Returns," Michelle Pfeiffer has 
never been more confident and powerful in a performance as she is here. As 
the increasingly paranoid and scared Claire, Pfeiffer never overplays any of 
her scenes, appropriately donning a tricky balancing act between believing 
the things she sees, and wondering if she is possibly delusional. She is a 
sympathetic protagonist, a woman in her forties who begins to realize how she 
has traded in her chances as a great cellist for almost the last twenty 
years, to instead raise a family and support her husband's work. Seemingly 
setting itself up to be an allegory of a woman who comes to terms with the 
choices she has made in her life, but recognizes that it's never to late to 
start over, the film disappoints on this level also, once again not following 
through with a subplot it has brought up.</P>
<P>Although top-billed, Harrison Ford constantly plays second fiddle, but holds 
his own remarkably well in many of his scenes with the radiant Pfeiffer. Ford 
portrays Norman as a caring husband who, nonetheless, simply isn't around 
nearly enough, and has made many mistakes in his past that he regrets (one of 
which plays a key role in the film, as well as in the misleading advertising 
campaign).</P>
<P>The supporting cast all equip themselves amicably, but each of them are 
wasted and not given a full character to develop. Diana Scarwid (1981's 
"Mommie Dearest") is vibrantly unconventional, but sorely underused, as 
Claire's best friend, Jody. The same goes for Miranda Otto (1997's "Love 
Serenade"), as troubled neighbor Mary Feur; James Remar, as Mary's 
no-nonsense husband, Warren; and Katharine Towne,  as Claire and Norman's 
daughter, Caitlin, who exits after the first five minutes and never reappears 
or is heard from again. Strengthening the supporting characters, or deleting 
many of them altogether, would surely have done a world of good in Gregg 
Clark's misguided screenplay, which relies heavily on plot twists and jumpy 
scary scenes, where someone enters the frame suddenly and there is a 
startling musical sting.</P>
<P>Where director Zemeckis does excel is in building up the tension, and if the 
movie is never truly scary, it does leave you on the edge of your seat on 
more than one occasion. It's strange, really, how even during the concluding 
twenty minutes, when things grow increasingly preposterous and the concluding 
twist feels more like a betrayal than a genuine surprise, Zemeckis uses his 
camera in a sly way that heightens the suspense even when that aspect should 
be falling apart too. One silent sequence that is set in a bathtub is a 
technical masterpiece, where just the subtle use of running water makes you 
want to grasp onto the theater seat's armrest. And another moment, in which 
the camera swings down to shoot below the floorboards, is almost 
awe-inspiring. </P>
<P>Everything in "What Lies Beneath" seems to be in place to create a rare 
supernatural thriller that not only works on a visceral level, but is also 
intelligent and classy, yet screenwriter Clark botches its chances. While the 
slasher movie-style finale is entertaining, simply to see such big stars 
involved in carrying it out, couldn't the movie have remained more of a 
psychological telling, rather than a violent and ghastly one? All could have 
been forgiven, however, with a satisfying epilogue, one that stays true to 
the character of Claire, a woman we as an audience have grown attached to, 
but the film unexpectedly ends with very few explanations or answers given. 
Whereas the viewer should walk away from a motion picture like "What Lies 
Beneath" with a giddy, satisfied feeling inside, all we are ultimately left 
with is the question, "What was the point?"</P>
