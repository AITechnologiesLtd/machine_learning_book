<P>   Horror stories and ghostly tales have generally been the
province of the teen audience and twenty-somethings,
although there's nothing that bars the older crowd from
enjoying parodies like the "Scream" series and parodies of
parodies like "Scary Movie."  When a film goes off the wall
like "Alien" and "From Dust Till Dawn," conjuring up the
ugliest monsters that the special effects departments savor, I
think the film studios accurately write off any possibility of
attracting people of a certain age.  This is why "What Lies
Beneath" should be (but alas, is not) an occasion for
rejoicing.  Here is a specter-driven tale which, if told to adults
sitting around a campfire during a warm and cloudless
summer eve at the beach could conceivably arouse
their trepidation.  But when put on a screen by the
accomplished director Robert Zemeckis--known for a cross-
genre competence in such movies as "Forrest Gump," "Used
Cars," "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," and "Back to the
Future"--the overlong piece goes off in all directions
needlessly, confusing the audience without handing us a
villain who is at all believable.</P>
<P>   I think the reason for the farrago is that Zemeckis--who
tries to give cinematic life to Clark Gregg's screenplay (based
on a story by Sarah Kernochan and Mr. Gregg)--is that the
entire tale depends on a single major twist that arrives only
toward the conclusion of the enterprise, after which the
slowly-paced story picks up the momentum and strives for
blockbusting sheer fright that the audience rightfully expects
of the genre.  Were it not for the importance of this gimmick,
Zemeckis could have more adequately developed the various
relationships he struggles to define, thereby avoiding the
unwanted audience laughter that the conclusion will likely
provoke.</P>
<P>   In referring to Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), a
celebrated biologist who is the son of an even more
acclaimed man in the field, the studio tagline states, "He was
the perfect husband until his one mistake followed them
home."  Norman's error in judgment is not one which is
altogether unusual in real life, but in his unique case, his
lapse in judgment leads to a series of spooky events in the
rambling Vermont home that he inherited from his dad and
shares with his lovely wife, Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Since
this is presumably an adult ghost story, the occurrences that
begin to drive Claire to the brink of insanity are subtle ones,
and Zemeckis restrains himself from introducing anything too
blatant and sophomoric, holding even the obligatory false
scares to a minimum.  At first, Claire notices that the front
door opens even so slightly just before she gets a chance to
insert the key.  As the story progresses, the eerie
phenomenona become less insinuated and more obtrusive:
the note on the mirror; the reflection in the bathtub water; the
tentative and fearful growling of their dog Cooper; the
appearance of steam that emanates from the bathtub and
spreads ever so lightly throughout the house.  When the
Spencers' computer begins rapidly delivering a repetitive
message and Alan Silvestri's original music becomes
increasingly meddlesome, Zemeckis crosses the border into
kid-stuff territory.  From that point, "What Lies Beneath"
becomes more like the proverbial roller-coaster ride that no
longer scares even the small fry.  And how many adults do
you know that want to spend any time on dizzying Coney
Island outings?</P>
<P>   If you've been listening the buzz about the film, you'll
inevitably hear comparisons made to Adrian Lyne's
groundbreaking 1987 film, "Fatal Attraction."  Remember,
though, that the Michael Douglas-Glenn Close-Anne Archer
piece gained its just reputation on a careful development of
Douglas's relationship with the sexy but psychotic Glenn
Close.  Both "Fatal Attraction" and "What Lies Beneath" give
the audience the Rambo-like conclusion that pleases the
thrill-seekers, but lacking an intricately developed and well-
focussed script, Zemeckis's picture cannot hold a candle to
Lyne's.</P>
<P>   Arthur Schmidt edits the film competently, cutting from
scene to fragmented scene to give the picture a vague sense
of continuity and photographer Don Burgess takes good
advantage of the lovely Vermont landscape, the sort of
panorama that arouses the envy of apartment dwellers in the
big city (but might bore them after a week or so). Harrison
Ford displays his signature smirk when gazing at the beautiful
but increasingly panicked Michelle Pfeiffer.  But when Pfeiffer
in one scene turns on Ford in an emulation of rough sex, you
can't help thinking how much better Glenn Close would be in
the same setting and how Michael Douglas would have been
the finer choice in this cast.</P>
