<P>Susan Granger's review of "GUN SHY" (Hollywood Pictures)</P>
<P>        It's got Sandra Bullock and Liam Neeson but something went
terribly wrong with the incomprehensible script and lame direction of
this silly mob comedy. Neeson plays a legendary undercover DEA agent
who suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome after a failed sting
operation. That's why he seeks psychiatric help and winds up in group
therapy and takes up with a spunky nurse, Sandra Bullock, who gives
him an enema. Meanwhile, the nasty DEA chief (Mitch Pileggi of TV's
X-Files) assigns him to complete one final covert operation wherein he
must escape the wrath of a hot-tempered, trigger-happy Mafia leader -
known as "the Jeffrey Dahmer of hitmen"- played by Oliver Platt, and
his vulgar, no-nonsense wife, Mary McCormack, who are involved with
Colombian drug dealers in a complex money-laundering scheme. Sound
like Analyze This? Sound like The Sopranos?  The producers should be
that lucky!  Just because TV writer/director Eric Blakeney worked on
Moonlighting, Wiseguy, and Max Headroom does not mean he can pull off
this kind of unconventional feature film, particularly when he
presents a colonic irrigation as a romantic encounter and relies on
feeble poop jokes for laughs. Remember Grosse Pointe Blank? It
explored much the same ironic territory - far better.  On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Gun Shy misses the target with a fumbling
4. Few laughs, little suspense and several talented actors who surely
could have found a better picture.</P>
