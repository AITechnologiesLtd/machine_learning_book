<PRE>                                    GABBEH
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This is only the second Iranian film I have been privileged to view.
The other was the delightful, Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Film ,
THE WHITE BALLOON.    While the latter was a straightforward story of a
little girl's adventure as she goes into town to buy a fish for her
home aquarium, GABBEH is unlike any other film I have seen.   It is a
fascinating fairy tale about young love in the steppes of Southeastern
Iran where Gabbeh (Shaghayegh Djodat) lives with her  nomadic tribe.
The tribe was noted for their beautiful carpets.</P>
<P>The film opens with an elderly couple (Hossein Moharami and Roghieh
Moharami) on a farm as they discuss who will wash the newly completed
carpet which has woven into it, a young girl and her lover.  The
gabbehs are not mere carpets.  The pictures  woven tell the stories of
their lives, their hopes,   Unlike carpets everywhere, the gabbehs do
not have a pre-set design but depend on the inspiration of the weaver.</P>
<P>As part of this very imaginative fairy tale, the name Gabbeh is given
to the protagonist.  Her clothing, like the carpet, is blue.  She sits
nearby the stream where the old couple is washing the gabbeh and,
again  fairy-tale- like, we are left to wonder until the film's very
end about her relationship with  the old man and woman.</P>
<P>The film's story, as sung and related by the young  woman, is of the
lover from a neighboring clan who rides on horseback atop the mountain
ridge and gives forth wolf calls to her, beckoning her to come to him.
Her father has promised Gabbeh she can get married after her uncle has
gotten married,   After that has happened, he tells her to wait until
her mother gives birth to a new child.</P>
<P>Unable to abide by these delays any longer, Gabbeh runs away to the
mountain where her lover has an extra horse and she and he ride away.
When her father learns of this, he takes his rifle and goes after
them   Two shots  ring out and the father returns to tell the
tribespeople that he had to kill the couple as a warning to others not
to desert the tribe.   If you  think that is where the story ends, you
are, as was I, in for a couple of big surprises which put finishing
touches on this lovely film.    For something different, something
enchanting, you cannot miss with GABBEH,</P>
<P>Mention must be made of the exceptionally fine photography by director
of photography Mahmoud Kalari. The wheat fields, the winds that sweep
them; the many gabbehs that dry on the landscape are gloriously
presented.</P>
<P><As an aside, the first choice for the role of Gabbeh was a nomadic
woman who turned down the part because she was afraid that playing the
part of a runaway would mar her reputation in her tribe and reduce,
possibly eliminate, her chances of finding a husband.   This despite it
being the custom among nomadic tribes that if a girl is prevented from
marrying her lover, she will elope with him.></P>
