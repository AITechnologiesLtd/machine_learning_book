<PRE>                           SHANGHAI NOON
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Jackie Chan brings his martial
          arts antics to the Old West,  A Chinese Imperial
          Guard from the Forbidden City in Beijing is sent
          to the America West to rescue a kidnapped
          princess.  The performances are fun, but the
          plotting is a string of cliches.  Rating: 5 (0
          to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Even worse than the spy genre, the Western genre is in clear
decline.  The film industry has lost the recipe for making good
riveting Westerns.  Now they can make only repetitive parodies that
mock the conventions of the Western and which do not have the soul
that made Westerns great.  The features that used to come cheap--the
horses and the scenery--now make Westerns prohibitively expensive to
make.  Perhaps the Western will return with digitized horses and
blue screen sunsets, who knows?  I spared myself last year's THE
WILD, WILD WEST, but SHANGHAI NOON looked moderately better.  It
probably was.</P>
<P>     Bringing a Chinese martial artist to the Old West has some of
the same possibilities as bringing a samurai in the only partially
successful mixture of genres of RED SUN (1971).  Sure enough, this
film has all the standard Western cliches we could have listed
BEFORE seeing the film.  We have a moving train robbery (only
slightly less cliched is the fact it is committed by amateurs and
incompetents).  We have a visit to a cathouse.  We have an escape
from an evil sheriff's jail.  We have a visit to an Indian village.
And, of course, there is a saloon brawl.  And there is a showdown on
a town street.  Miles Millar and Alfred Gough seem to have written
the script with a checklist.  Each cliche circumstance is revisited
with an eye toward how it might be a little different if a comic
Chinese martial artist involved.  Even so nothing more creative than
a three-way fistfight is attempted.  There are also wide vistas
filmed to stirring music whetting our appetites for a real Western,
but the film only reminds us that the film industry has lost that
particular ability.</P>
<P>     The film opens in Beijing, in the Forbidden City.  Chon Wang
(played by Jackie Chan) is a hapless member of the Imperial Guard,
charged with scrubbing floors and protecting Princess Pei Pei (Lucy
Alexis Liu).  The princess, wishing to avoid an arranged marriage,
agrees to be taken to Carson City, Nevada.  Along the way she
realizes that her companion is really kidnapping her.  Wang is sent
to Nevada with his uncle to rescue her.  The uncle is killed when
the train is robbed by a band of inept train robbers.  Chon teams
with their leader Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) in an attempt to save
the princess.  What does all this have to do with Shanghai or noon?
Not a thing.  But by giving the film a pointless name the writers
could squeeze one more joke out.  Many of the gags will be familiar
including the "horsing around" of a trained horse.  One weakness of
the script is the dependency on one character, who shall remain
nameless here, who gets the characters out of several nasty patches,
but otherwise seems never to be around.  This is just too easy an
answer for how the main characters are going to escape their
problems.</P>
<P>     In spite of the rather unimaginative plotting and scripting
Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan each turn in engaging performances.
Remarkably, Wilson holds his own against Chan, perhaps even making
himself the more interesting character.  The stress is less on
Chan's martial arts than in his classic films.  These fights still
seem very orchestrated.  I have no doubts that if Chan got into a
real fight he would probably still give a very good account of
himself, but I suspect it would look very different from the
stylized and contrived fights he has in his films.  These are
choreographed to show off his natural grace.</P>
<P>     Daniel Mindel's cinematography is frequently quite good, though
many of his effects are overly familiar.  When bullets shot through
a wall each gave rise to a column of light in BLOOD SIMPLE, it was
an impressive effect.  Now it is over-used and once again here we
see it used.  He does get some nice Nevada landscapes and it is hard
not to make the Forbidden City in Beijing look impressive.  Oh, and
yes, I can confirm what Jackie Chan fans already know.  The viewer
should sit through the credits to see the out-takes from the
filming.</P>
<P>     Overall SHANGHAI NOON this is just a passable entertainment
which gets from me a rating of 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
