<PRE>"Bandits"</PRE>
<P>Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are bank
robbers looking to make the string of scores necessary to allow them to
retire, in comfort, south of the border. Their M.O. as the non-violent
Sleepover Bandits has earned them the reputation as the most famous thieves
in American history and their plan looks like it just might work. But, when
a pretty, unhappy housewife, Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett), joins the tiny
gang she steals something, too - their hearts - in Barry Levinson's
"Bandits."</P>
<P>Joe is an irresistible felon who, with a word and a smile, can melt any
woman's heart and just wants to enjoy life. Terry is a hypochondriac who is
obsessed with his imaginary diseases and worries over every day-to-day
detail. They seem like the unlikeliest team of bank robbers but, as they
say, opposites attract and between the two of them they make the ideal man
and crook. Joe, always one to shoot from the hip, breaks them out of prison
in a daring, impromptu escape aboard a cement truck. The pair, on the lam
now, talk about their future and decide that they will head down to Mexico
where Joe's uncle runs a struggling hotel. They figure that the can turn
the place into a successful nightclub if only they can lay their hands the
cash to do it. But, how to do it?</P>
<P>Terry, the smart one, comes up with a plan that is brilliant in its
simplicity. Since their usual trade of robbing banks, with guns and guards
abundant during a busy business day, is risky, to say the least, he devises
a way to avoid getting shot and caught. The idea is, kidnap the bank
manager, hold him/her hostage with the family overnight, have a nice dinner
and sleepover, then go to the bank before it opens with the manager,
collect all the cash and split. No fuss and no muss. They enlist Joe's
loyal young cousin, Harvey J. Pollard (Troy Garrity), to be their getaway
driver, put the plan into action and, to Joe and Terry's surprise, it all
works! They split the loot and go their separate ways until the next heist.</P>
<P>Things go as planned for the next robbery, too, but after they separate,
Terry's car runs out of gas and, before he can get more and take off, the
cops show up. He needs another set of wheels in a hurry and decides to
carjack a ride. Enter Kate, a lonely, unhappy housewife whose husband pays
her scant attention. Distraught after his latest bout of ignoring her, she
takes her Mercedes for a spin to clear her head and, literally, runs into
Terry. He is totally disoriented, thinks he has a concussion and makes the
mistake of taking a ride with the hysterical Kate. He takes her to the
"gang's" hideout and, unless they shoot her and bury the body in the woods,
Terry and Joe are stuck with the haus frau. This isn't a problem for Joe,
who immediately takes a liking to the pretty housewife and she joins them
in their spree. Things get complicated as Kate falls for both guys (and
vice versa), which leads to a dramatic standoff with the police on their
last, big job.</P>
<P>Levinson and screenwriter Harley Peyton, with their talented trio of stars,
have succeeded in creating a modern day version of "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid," but with a twist. In this new millennium bank robbery
western Kate replaces Etta Place (Katherine Ross) from the '69 flick as the
romantic interest, this time showing her love for both of her versions of
Butch and Sundance. It is obvious from the beginning that the very
different Joe and Terry, though flawed, do have their good points. Together
they make the perfect man - strong, sensitive, intelligent and capable -
and Kate refuses to choose between them. This makes "Bandits" a fine
buddy/road/romantic comedy film that wears its non-violent larceny as a
benevolent badge of honor.</P>
<P>Willis, Thornton and Blanchett are a solid triumvirate of actors who forgo
the usual star power and work hard to be convincing as the characters the
play. Bruce Willis is understated as the charismatic, action-oriented Joe
and plays well as part of the ensemble instead of his usual focal star
persona. His onscreen charm is obvious and he keeps it in part with his
costars. Billy Bob Thornton, once again, shows his mettle as an
experienced, convincing character actor. He puts a solid spin on his Terry,
creating a nerdy, smart felon who, though a rampant hypochondriac, is able
to survive life day by day. Cate Blanchett, once again, proves herself to
be one of the finest actors in the business. The Australian is capable of
playing any kind of character and is able to do an American accent that
would make a native proud. The three actors display a chemistry that allows
you to lose yourself in their interplay and believe them as real people.</P>
<P>Supporting cast is limited, mainly, to a funny, goofy performance by Troy
Garrity as the none-too-bright Harvey. The newcomer portrays his character
as what Joe says is "honest and follows good." He doesn't have the stomach
for a direct part in the larceny but he is loyal and does what he can for
his older cousin, Joe. What Harvey really wants is to be a movie stunt man
and this career endeavor makes for some of the film's best slapstick
moments. The rest of the cast is there to fill the void around the stars
and not much more. One exception is Peggy Miley as Mildred Kronenberg, a
bank manager who is thrilled to be one of the Sleepover Bandits hostage
victims but refuses to give the crooks a red cent, knowing that she will
not be harmed in the least by her captors. Willis fans will note that two
of the stars kid's, Scout and Tallulah, appear as the daughters of one of
the kidnapped bank bosses.</P>
<P>As one expects in a film by Levinson, techs are solid. Veteran lenser Dante
Spinotti gives the film a cool, clean look and adjusts smoothly between the
warmth of those intimate moments between the three principle and the almost
clinical look of the heists. Costumes, by Gloria Gresham, is Oscar caliber
as Joe and Terry (and, eventually, Kate) are clothed in funky, funny
disguises that are more subtly funny than outrageous. Pop music plays a
prominent part in the film, especially for Kate who's a sap for sentimental
tunes like "Walk on By" and "Just the Two of Us."</P>
<P>"Bandits" is a little on the long side, clocking in at over two hours, and
could have been trimmed of some of its fat, but that's a relatively minor
nitpick. All in all, I had a rip roarin' good time and liked the story
about these amiable crooks. I give it an B+</P>
