<PRE>                              SANDS OF THE KALAHARI
                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge
                        Copyright 1996 Shane R. Burridge</PRE>
<PRE>119m.  </PRE>
<P>A chartered plane makes a forced landing in the Kalahari desert,
stranding its six passengers (five men and one woman) on a rocky
outcrop in the middle of nowhere.  Gripping, existential adventure
borrows from Nietzsche and Darwin - it is unlike any other survival
story you will have probably seen.  It seems at first that the
survivors in this case will not have to struggle too hard to stay
alive - they find shelter, food, and water less than a day's hike from
the downed plane.  Nor do they seem concerned about possible search
parties or rescue attempts.  But then the group dynamics set in. 
Susannah York, the only female, is the most obvious catalyst for
unrest among the other survivors.  In a godless world a leader must
emerge to take charge - and a mate.  It's plain that we're meant to
make the connection between the group of people huddled together among
the rocks and the tribe of baboons that also colonize the outcrop. 
The survivors are back at the dawn of humanity (this film will make
you think of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), living in a cave (with
pre-supplied paintings), hunting animals, and competing for dominance
in their habitat.  That they have intruded upon the baboons' domain is
clear: the apes are always seen from high up on the rocks, staring at
the people below, barking harshly and baring their fangs.  Humans are
right back down near the bottom of the food chain.  As O'Brien (Stuart
Whitman), the most energetic of the group, tells them, they are
nevertheless equipped for survival because they are more intelligent. 
But O'Brien has a feral quality that doesn't stay hidden for long. 
"He's the only one of us who belongs here,"  York says early in the
piece.  It's a signpost remark, and a little too pat, as are other
observations tossed off by the characters, who voice ideas and themes
in the movie as if they were supplying answers to an essay question on
it.  </P>
<P>There is still plenty to think about afterwards, nonetheless: are
characters meant to be thought of as villains because they are more
capable of survival than others?  Sturdevan (Nigel Davenport) behaves
like an absolute pig mere moments before he casually decides to
undertake a dangerous journey that may save the others; the oldest
member of the group (Harry Andrews), whose scientific knowledge
provides much reassurance for the others, turns out to be have been a
soldier working for the Nazis; and while we condemn O'Brien's
cold-blooded, methodical exploitation of the everyone else in the
group it's easy to forget that it was he who rescued their only
survival equipment from the burning wreckage of the plane.  Lastly,
there is York, the character we associate most strongly with
civilization (she's even named Grace), who at first only wants love
but then gives in to her sexual desires.  She doesn't become as
independent and assertive as we would hope. Theodore Bikel and Stanley
Baker round out the rest of the survivors.  With so much individual
discrepancy it's not surprising that we rarely see the same two
characters playing scenes together.  Their constant interchange is a
useful device to keep the pacing of the film brisk. This, and the
effective location shooting, makes the story very watchable - you
won't be expecting the provocative ending.</P>
