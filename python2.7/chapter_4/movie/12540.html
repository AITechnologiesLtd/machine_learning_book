<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER (1998)
Rated PG-13 for a disturbing accident scene and some brief profanity.
----------  Out of 4 stars: **** (4 Stars)</P>
<P>Starring: Robert Redford, Kristen Scott Thomas, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Neil,
Dianne Wiest, and Chris Cooper.</P>

<P>One of the many challenges of adapting a best-selling novel is making
it appealing to the fans of the book.  Unfortunately, Robert Redford
may not have done that, as his film, THE HORSE WHISPERER, alters the
ending drastically (from what I have heard).  I haven't read the
Nicholas Evans' novel, but I can't imagine it being better than this
filmed version.  Robert Redford is one of the few underrated directors
whose work is usually acknowledged as good, but not great.  I like to
think of Redford as one of the greatest directors working today.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER proves just that.  His smooth direction is key to
the film's tone and emotions, and without bending into the
melodramatic, he almost forces tears out of our eyes.  Redford has
proven a great director before, with such films as his directing
debut, ORDINARY PEOPLE (oh yeah, he snagged an Oscar for that one), A
RRIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, and the Oscar-nominated QUIZ SHOW (my personal
favorite of all of his films).  And now, he makes an incredibly moving
motion picture that beckons back to the good old days of making motion
pictures for the heartfelt emotions (TITANIC anyone?).  Of course,
there are bound to be those cynics who claim that the film revolves
around a ludicrous plot, and yes, if you think about it, the plot is
slightly corny.  But that's not what the film is about.  It's about
emotions.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER begins with a stunning montage sequence of a horse
moving gracefully across sandy hills.  The main plot is set in motion
with a horrific and terrifying scene.  Two girls, Judith (Catherine
Bosworth) and Grace (Scarlett Johansson), set out to take a peaceful
ride through the snowy country.  Deciding to take a shortcut up a
steep embankment, the two girls find themselves in trouble when
Judith's horse can't make it up and slides down the hill, taking Grace
and her horse, Pilgrim, with her.  A huge 18-wheeler approaches the
two girls as their horses try to escape.  The attempts fail, and the
truck slides over Judith and her horse, while Pilgrim throws Grace
off, injuring himself in the process.  The PG-13 rating is mostly
warranted because of this scene, which is more graphically implied
than witnessed (in other words, we think we see more than we do).</P>
<P>Grace is injured badly, and her leg is amputated, while Pilgrim hides
under a bridge, grotesquely disfigured.  Grace's parents, Annie and
Robert MacLean (Kristen Scott Thomas and Sam Neill), race to the
hospital, where they are faced with a decision: put the horse to
sleep, or let him suffer in pain.  Under so much pressure, Annie
recommends that they keep the horse alive.  A while later, Annie
visits Pilgrim, who seems to peer into her soul.  Annie decides that
she can't kill the horse, but help it heal, as it may aid in healing
her daughter.  Grace, meanwhile, is struggling through ridicule from
her peers and depression.  Assisted with a prosthetic limb and
crutches, she struggles to do the simplest of tasks, like walking up
stairs.  Annie begins to lose all hope when she hears about a man in
Montana--a horse whisperer.  Tom Booker (Robert Redford) first
declines her offer, but being so determined, Annie picks up and leaves
her husband and work to meet with Tom, taking Grace and Pilgrim with.</P>
<P>While this may sound a little corny, it's played out seriously, and it
works beautifully.  Arriving in Montana, Annie pleads with Tom to take
a look at Pilgrim.  He accepts, only to find a horse with seriously
mental and emotional problems.  How can he figure this?  Not by
whispering, as the title may suggest, but by watching Pilgrim's every
move, and judging it as a sign of communication.  Horses have a unique
gift that only few animals have.  If you have ever touched or ridden a
horse, you know of the love and care that they give.  It's a special
thing when a horse bonds with its owner, and THE HORSE WHISPERER
flaunts the connection between animals and humans continuously.  If
you love animals, as I do, you are more likely to love this film than
not.  An animal's enduring trust can be something no human could ever
give.  Of course, the film's only flaw lies in the relationship that
ignites between Annie and Tom.  Tom has suffered a divorce from the
woman he loved, and he is unsure whether to try it again.  Annie is
married, but can't contain the love that soon grows for this man of
the country.  The only problem is that because of Tom's wariness, he
is hesitant to get involved with her, and the romance is left
smoldering instead of bursting into flames on screen.  But this really
only emphasizes the connection that is made between Grace and Tom, and
Tom and Pilgrim.</P>
<P>As aforementioned, the ending of the novel is changed in its
translation to the big screen, but the change made is for the best.
Instead of sinking into melodrama, it turns into a character-driven
drama that skillfully deals with many subjects at once.  The
screenplay, adapted by Richard LaGravenese and Eric Roth, contains a
lot of humor that lightens things up.  Most of the humor comes from
Booker's subtle personality and dry wit and MacLean's city-adapted
mannerisms.  Nearly all the humor pays off, and the audience will find
themselves laughing as much as crying.  But on top of the seemingly
heavy drama, Redford stands proud, holding everyone back from
venturing into gagging, sappy romance.  Redford's direction is some of
the best I have seen for a long time, and hopefully should earn him
another Oscar nomination.  If not, then something is wrong in the
state of California.  Keeping things slowly paced, we get to
experience the visual palette that he has provided for us, sort of the
way Kubrick did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Many scenes are obligatory,
but we relish them, nonetheless.  And it's mostly all due to one
simple reason: cinematography.</P>
<P>I have one rule that I apply to all the films I see (one of my many
rules): if the plot, characters, acting, and direction is awful, but
the cinematography is excellent, I will give a positive review of the
film.  This is the one reason that I think David Fincher is the best
director working today.  Cinematography, for me, is the most important
aspect of any film because it's the one thing that distinguishes films
from plays or novels.  THE HORSE WHISPERER's camera work is exquisite,
capturing the luscious scenery like eye candy.  Filmed by Oscar-winner
Robert Richardson, the film contains some of the most gorgeous
cinematography ever captured on celluloid.  And he doesn't just limit
himself to the countryside.  Richardson knows how to film actors,
capturing small details that other people may think unnecessary.  I
can't emphasize this enough: if this film does not win (that's
right--win) the Best Cinematography Oscar, there is no justice in the
world.</P>
<P>Robert Redford has done an incredible job in presenting this
story--not just story-wise or technical-wise, but with top-notch
actors who flesh out the characters completely.  This is the first
time Redford has directed a film in which he has performed in, and he
has done something that Mel Gibson and Quentin Tarantino could never
do (the only other successful one that comes to mind is, of course,
Kenneth Branagh).  Redford succeeds as both an actor and director; he
almost forces us to like Booker, and yet we begin to connect with him
as he connects with the horse.  The astonishing sequences between
Redford and Pilgrim are the best in the film.  The dramatically
energized scenes contain more emotion than some movies in their
entirety.  Not to be outdone is Kristen Scott Thomas, the nominated
actress from the much-acclaimed THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  While her
performance in that film was vastly overrated, Thomas exerts the exact
amount of emotion and confusion that we expect from this character.
Her growth is slow and gradual, and almost mimics the horse as she
comes to term with her situation.  But more importantly is Scarlett
Johansson, the most complex character in the film.  At times, she
reminded me of Sarah Polley in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, and both compare
equally.  Johansson gives an Oscar-caliber performance that deserves
recognition.  This is one of the best performances you will likely see
this year, and she now joins the ranks of young actors that exceed
expectations (also on the list is Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood,
Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin, and a couple others).  Sam Neill remains
in the background for most of the film, but his scenes with Thomas are
exciting because Neill is not portrayed as the villain of the film, as
some would like to think.  He's a logical, smart human being, and his
final talk with Thomas is heartfelt and gratifying.  Supporting actors
Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper are both very good in their roles, but
again, it's Johansson who steals the film.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER is rated PG-13 for a disturbing accident scene and
some brief profanity.  THE HORSE WHISPERER flies along at two hours
and forty-eight minutes, and it almost seems too short.  I heard the
original cut was around four hours long, and I really wouldn't have
cared.  While the film does contain it's share of flaws, they are
quite insignificant to hurt it's power.  Some of the images are still
stuck in my head, days after seeing it.  The music by Thomas Newman is
simplistic but effective.  At the beginning, I could almost hear the
TITANIC theme in my mind.  But after a while, the music became
appropriate, underscoring every scene with a simple, country song.
This is likely to be one of the best films of the year, and being into
May already (with the summer season coming around the corner), you are
probably unlikely to see another one like this for a while.  Who
knows?  Maybe THE X-FILES will surprise us (as it should).</P>
