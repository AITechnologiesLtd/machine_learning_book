<PRE>                           CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     We had an execution, jilted lovers, big-time payback, and at least
three sprawling examinations of someone's life.  Now we get an apartheid
film:  another in the string of "serious movies" coming out in the last
few weeks.</P>
<P>     CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY is James Earl Jones's magnum opus, a film in
which he gets to really stretch his range as an actor, even though the
film doesn't give him much room to do so.  The movie is the story of aging
Zulu priest Stephen Kumalo (Jones) and his search for his sister and son
in 1946 Johannesburg.  A stranger in a strange land, Kumalo soon finds his
country ways unsuited for life in the bustling city, and he is victimized
by thieves almost as soon as he arrives.</P>
<P>     Kumalo finds his sister soon enough:  she's a prostitute in the
seediest section of town.  Finding son Absalom is a different matter
altogether, and a convoluted investigation finally leads him to his son's
life of crime, a pregnant girlfriend, and the sort-of-accidental murder of
a prominent, white, social reformer.  To make matters worse, this man is
the son of Kumalo's wealthy neighbor, James Jarvis (Richard Harris). 
Kumalo becomes wrapped up in his son's trial, but more interestingly,
attempts to reconcile things with Jarvis.</P>
<P>     Harris and Jones are amazing when on screen together, but this is all
too rare, as they interact in only three brief scenes.  The rest of the
picture is very beautiful, but its deliberate, plodding pace seems to drag
the movie on for an eternity.  There's no big surprise about what's going
to happen, but the sheer heart that Jones, Harris, and director Darrell
James Roodt have imbued to the film give it an uncommon bouyance and it
manages to rise above its flawed pacing.</P>
<P>     The message of CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY, that compassion and
forgiveness are crucial if society is to develop to the next level, is
almost completely foreign in cinema today.  And it is that compassion that
makes this picture so oddly memorable.</P>
