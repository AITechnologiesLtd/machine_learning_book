<P>KNOCK OFF
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: no stars (out of ****)
TriStar / 1:30 / 1998 / R (language, violence, brief nudity, general 
badness)
Cast: Jean-Claude Van Damme; Rob Schneider; Lela Rochon; Paul Sorvino; 
Carmen Lee; Wyman Wong 
Director: Tsui Hark 
Screenplay: Steven E. de Souza<HR>There are bad movies. There are _bad_ movies. And then there's "Knock 
Off," an appropriately-titled vehicle for Jean-Claude Van Damme that 
just transcends badness altogether. Granted, Van Damme's films are 
fairly easy targets when it comes time for a critical analysis, but this 
stinker sinks the buff Belgian kickboxer to a deadly new low. At least 
some of his most recent work boasted scattershot positive attributes - 
1994's "TimeCop" (arguably his best) had an interesting story, 1996's 
"Maximum Risk" looked fantastic and last year's "Double Team" was an 
unintentional gutbuster. Knock Off, on the other hand, claims none of 
these "qualities," not even the inadvertent laugh track. You could 
strain yourself into a hernia looking for a sole good thing here. </P>
<P>The backdrop is 1997 Hong Kong, right around the time the country's 
British rule was handed over to China. Van Damme plays Marcus Ray, a 
swarthy designer jeans rep (aren't you just loving this already?) with 
connections to the counterfeit underground, a market that's being 
retooled by an international smuggling ring - they're installing tiny 
"nanobombs" in the front waist buttons! (Please hold all jokes about 
exploding crotches.) Covert CIA agents, turncoat sales executives, 
former KGB thugs and the Russian mafia all somehow figure into "Knock 
Off" as well, but the plot is best described as incomprehensible, 
annoying sound and fury. In fact, if not for the generously wordy 
production notes, a summary of the film's set-up would be downright 
impossible. </P>
<P>Director Tsui Hark, who previously worked with Van Damme on "Double 
Team," fills "Knock Off" with visual gimmicks that serve only as empty 
distractions. Like a watered-down version of this summer's "Snake Eyes," 
the camera knows no boundaries, traveling through newspapers, telephone 
lines, computers and rifle scopes as if they weren't solid objects; one 
weird shot appears to wander inside a shoe and emerge from a pool table 
pocket. Completely unacceptable action sequences only add to the 
maddening confusion, especially a horrible boat chase that opens the 
film on two left feet. "Knock Off" employs slow-motion, fast-forwards 
and freeze-frames to give its various battles and fight scenes an 
outlandish energy, but all of this flashy excess is completely 
unsynchronized. </P>
<P>"Knock Off" wouldn't have been so painful to sit through had it at least 
been diverting in the way that only terrible movies can be, but no such 
luck. It's a straight-faced disaster, unbearably squandering a 
potentially juicy filmmaking style and wasting a fine supporting cast 
(Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon and Paul Sorvino), generally making its 
90-minute running time feel like an eternity. Perhaps "Knock Off" 
reaches its intolerably absurdist zenith not long after it starts, when, 
for no discernable reason, Van Damme carts sidekick Schneider around the 
crowded streets of Hong Kong in a rickshaw race. The latter grabs an eel 
from a nearby food stand and begins pelting the former with it, 
screaming, "Move that big, beautiful ass of yours!" If you know what's 
good for you, you'll do the same.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' 
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything 
else." -Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
