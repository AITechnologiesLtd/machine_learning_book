<PRE>_Guinevere_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>In recent years, onscreen romantic pairings of older men and much
younger women have become more and more commonplace (Michael Douglas and
Gwyneth Paltrow, Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, to name two
noteworthy examples).  However, rarely, if ever, do films make an issue
of vast age difference, even when the audience is slightly discomfited by
the fact that these man can, indeed, be these women's fathers. 
_Guinevere_ is a film far removed from the Hollywood mainstream that
perpetuates that trend, but its intelligent examination of the girl-man
romantic dynamic is a refreshing change of pace.</P>
<P>No female character in _Guinevere_ actually shares her name with the
legendary queen of Camelot, but the pet name is given to Harper Sloane
(Sarah Polley), a directionless recent college graduate, by Connie
Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), a photographer whom Harper meets at her
sister's wedding.  Connie is much older than Harper, and not exactly the
most handsome man out there, but his way of making her feel special and
wanted makes for the ultimate attraction.  But as Harper soon finds out,
she is only the latest in a long line of Guineveres.</P>
<P>Although the point of view of the film is distinctly female (the
writer-director is a woman, Audrey Wells), _Guinevere_ doesn't stack the
deck against Connie; in fact, the treatment of the relationship is
surprisingly evenhanded.  While there is no doubt that Connie takes
advantage of Harper's youth and naivete, he also helps her and his past
Guineveres find their ambition and direction in life (in Harper's case,
photography).  The extent to which he exploits the young women and that
to which he helps them is left open to debate, but there is no doubt that
the inspiration he gives his "students" is more than sexual.</P>
<P>But that doesn't mean there aren't darker edges to the character of
Connie, and Rea, while always exhibiting a layer of vulnerability that is
crucial to the film's success, also doesn't downplay the somewhat
unsettling mystery about him.  When Harper's uppity mother (Jean Smart)
cuts him down in a most refined yet menacing manner (it's a terrific
scene that could very well win Academy attention for Smart), while one
hates her bitchy attitude, one can still see where the objections are
coming from.  But the film isn't called _Guinevere_ for nothing, and
Polley is the clear standout of the impressive cast.  Not only is she
never less than convincing as both a a girl at the beginning and a woman
at the end, she believably develops into the latter as the film
progresses.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Wells isn't able to come up with a wrapup that matches
the impact of Harper's journey.  The final scene is a nice and
interesting one, but it seems a bit too sugary to really feel of a piece
with the rest of _Guinevere_--which is smart and compelling enough as a
whole to overcome that comparatively minor misstep.</P>
