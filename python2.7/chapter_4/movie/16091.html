<P>   Imagine that you've been transported to a distant planet in
another galaxy, one which has the same climate and
atmospheric conditions as Earth.  You're pleasantly surprised
that you can breathe just as you did in your own world and
even more astonished that the people you see around you
can all speak English.  But that's where the familiarity ends. 
The signs on the stores are written in a language which
appears a cross between Thai and hieroglyphics.  You stretch
out your hand to shake with a friendly man coming toward
you, but the man knocks you flat on your back and is then
paradoxically solicitous about your health. You run outside to
feel the snowflakes but, stretching out your palm, you are
severely burned by the white substance floating cheerfully to
the ground.  You pick up a piece of fruit resembling a Golden
Delicious apple, bite into it, and detect the taste of cardboard-
-it's only the picture of an apple.  After a while, you adapt to
this strange and wondrous culture, you meet someone on
your own wavelength, and resolve never to return to Earth.  </P>
<P>   Science fiction?  Of course.  The principal character of
Irwin Winkler's involving new film takes such a metaphorical
trip to outer space. "At First Sight" centers on a short,
dramatic incident in the life of Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer),
totally blind from the age of three because of a combination
of retinitis pigmentosa and congenital cataracts, a man whose
father puts the boy through a series of probes conducted by
all sorts of people, from professional ophthalmologists to
new-age faith healers--all to no avail.  Resigned to his
condition, Virgil puts himself in the loving care of his older
sister, Jenny (Kelly McGillis), and takes on the career of a
massage therapist in an Adirondack Mountain resort not far
from New York City.  We don't wonder that Virgil is a popular
favorite among the guests at the spa: with the increased
sense of touch that a blind man develops, he becomes very
good at his trade.  In the PG-13 film's most erotic scene,
Winkler shows Virgil easing the cares of a successful New
York architect, Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino), who is literally
brought to tears by her contact with Virgil's strong and
seemingly enchanted palms.</P>
<P>   Amy's fondness for Virgil grows, leading to the
consummation of their mutual attraction in a sexual embrace
which, compared to the earlier spectacle in the massage
room, is disappointingly mechanical.  When Amy suggests
that Virgil submit himself to a new, experimental surgery at
the famed Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital--which counts
among its practitioners the world's finest eye doctors--Virgil's
reluctance gives us pause.  Wouldn't any of us in his position
enthusiastically agree to such surgery, whatever the odds of
success?  It is a tribute to Winkler's directorial skills, and to a
fine script based on neurologist Oliver Sacks's book "To See
and Not See," that we understand his hesitation.  Not only
had he gone through a long series of painful procedures as a
young lad, but more important, he has grown comfortable in
his limited world.  Virgil is aware--as his sighted counterparts
are not--that regaining the use of his eyes would be like our
traveling to that distant planet.  He would be like the
characters in Plato's cave who finally break their chains,
refusing to believe that the shadow which a fire cast on the
wall was the only reality.  Emerging into the sun, the
occupants of the cave are soon driven back to the dark
confines of their cavity, blinded by the light above and
rejecting the images they see as though they were segments
of a strange, satanic dream.  </P>
<P>   As though to confirm Virgil's prejudices, he is at first
blinded by light, then exposed to a thousand images which
bewilder him to the point of derangement.  Standing in the
middle of fast-moving car lanes in New York City, he refuses
to believe that an onrushing vehicle could hurt him.  When he
spots his image in a mirror, you don't wonder that he says
"hello" and is put off when he receives no answer.  He walks
into glass, in one case shattering it; he cannot distinguish
between an apple and a picture of an apple; he observes
Amy giving a brief kiss to her ex-husband and present
architectural partner Sam Allanbrook (Steven Webster) and
wonders, "What does that kiss mean?" He attends a noisy
party with Amy and soon wants to go home because he feels
he does not belong in this world.  Essentially Virgil is not
unlike Ray Charles, the blind jazz pianist, who once declared
that he would not wish to leave his state of sightlessness
because he senses a greater authenticity in his present
condition.</P>
<P>   The chemistry between Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino is
palpable, but then, when Sorvino dances with her ex-
husband--who is attempting a reconciliation--the sparks fly
even more.  Sorvino is cute--not a beauty by Hollywood
standards.  With her ski-slope nose and expressive features,
she is ideally cast as the credible lover of a sightless man. 
Sorvino is so emotive that we don't wonder that her character
broke up with her husband, whom she describes as a man
with the emotional depth of a soapdish, one who cried only
once, when he did his tax returns three years earlier.  Val
Kilmer, not a great actor, is burdened with a moronic
smile through most of the story, the sort of grin that
psychologists often associate with a contemptuous air.  Bruce
Davison is far better as the doctor excited by the prospects of
reversing a serious disability.  This remarkable actor, who in
the role of Charles Aaron combines professional dignity with
an expression of genuine caring, rivets attention in every
scene while Kelly McGillis, in the role of the self-sacrificing
sister who enviously fears the loss of her dependent brother
to another woman, performs adequately.  In an all-too-small
role, Nathan Lane does shtick as only he can do.  He is Dr.
Phil Webster, an unorthodox sight therapist who at one point
takes his prize patient to a strip joint to further highlight the
joys of seeing.  Lane has the movie's best line.  Describing
the limbo separating a man who has newly regained sight
and one who has spent enough time in therapy to distinguish
an apple from a magazine picture, he holds that "limbo is like
New Jersey: you can see all the good things that are
happening; you just have to find out how to get there."</P>
<P>   While "At First Sight" brings to mind "Beyond Silence," a
portrayal of the world of the deaf, an even better correlation
can be made with Ralph Nelson's 1968 charmer, "Charly,"
which featured Oscar-winner Cliff Robertson as the title
character who is changed from a retarded baker's helper to a
man of genius--only to be transformed unhappily back when
the operation ultimately fails.  "At First Sight," with its panoply
of emotional responses, is a fine example of romantic
melodrama which professionally displays the effects of
dramatic change on the life of a man and of the persons
whose lives he touches.</P>
