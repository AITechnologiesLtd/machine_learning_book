<P>        Timothy "Speed" Levitch, the one and only subject of Bennett
Miller's documentary gem "The Cruise," is an authentic improvisational
master of the non-stop rant, an unproduced 28-year-old Manhattan
playwright whose only venue is the windblown upper deck of a Grayline
tour bus. 
        Miller, working as a one-man film and sound crew, records big
chunks of Speed's tourist-baffling workday spiel ("The sun, another
great New York landmark, above you on the left") and follows him from
one temporary dwelling to another, as he pursues his dedication to
"the cruise," a free-flowing passionate interaction with the world,
and above all with the inexhaustible metropolis. ("I couldn't believe
how angry the city was with me," Levitch recalls, of an especially
dicey period in their relationship.) Anything that impedes or
restricts his intensely focused drifting is dismissed as an aspect of
"the anti-cruise."
        We can imagine Speed Levitch making the transition to a job in
radio or performance art; he's certainly a more bracingly original
voice than a lot of what passes for greatness now in either medium.
Several chunks of his monologue here, particularly an extended
denunciation of "the grid plan," initially as a function of urban
design and then as an extended metaphor for  boxed-in modes of thought
and behavior in general, are polished enough already.
        Miller seems to revere Levitch's principled devotion to all
things shapeless and impulsive, but a note of sadness creeps in.
Levitch wonders aloud if his judgmental relatives are right after all;
if he really is just one more babbling urban nut-case. In order to
shape his eddying perceptions into performance pieces he'd have to
collaborate with the anti-cruise in a way that may be impossible for
him.
        Luckily, Speed Levitch had Bennett Miller to shoot and
re-shape this very raw material, to craft something durable from
Speed's ecstatic ramblings.
