<P>>From the title, this somehow sounded to me like a Russian film, probably
because the classic movie on the 1917 Russian Revolution, Ten Days that
Shook the World, is called October in Russia. But October Sky is not a
Russian movie. Yet it all started with the Soviet Union launching, on
October 4, 1957, the first satellite ever, Sputnik.</P>
<P>The Space Age began in a sensational way. Sputnik made the Russians proud
to the point of haughtiness. It  scared Cold War America. It gave a huge
boost to the US. space program. And, as in millions of places on earth, it
had the whole population of Coaltown, West Virginia, crane its collective
neck to watch that incredible point of light travel in the October sky.</P>
<P>The boost was not limited to American and other  scientists. In Coaltown,
for example, it fired up the imagination of  high schooler Homer Hickam,
the son of John and Elsie. Coal mine superintendent John radiated
authority, brooked no nonsense or errors from his men, and was totally
devoted to his profession.</P>
<P>Coaltown was just that, a small, modest community where just about all
males were coal miners and all the fathers took for granted that their sons
would become miners. Because Homer's brother Jim was a local football star,
he might get an athletic scholarship after graduation. But Homer? He did
play football but regularly got creamed by the other teams. He took his
punishment  bravely, unflinchingly, stoically,  like a real mensch -- a
term that would puzzle Coaltowners.</P>
<P>As Homer, Jake Gyllenhaal is likable, nice-looking, well-mannered but
essentially just a face in the crowd. Sputnik changes all that. It becomes
for him something like his  Road to Damascus, where Paul the Apostle had
his sudden revelation that made him a Christian. Homer, encouraged by his
teacher Miss Riley, sets out to build a working rocket.</P>
<P>He enlists two of his schoolmates, both "regular guys," then Quentin who
has a high I.Q.,  is exceptionally strong in many areas of science, reads
voraciously and experiments. As the class --if not all of Coaltown's --
nerd ( "a geek" say the students), he is shunned by others as a weirdo. He
keeps to himself. Even Homer's two original collaborators are surprised by
his choice of a fourth musketeer.</P>
<P>But the team is a good one, bonds quickly, works well. They are nicknamed
The Rocket Boys by a population which in its majority sees the fellows as
nutty, time-wasting eccentrics engaged in "all that nonsense,", the very
words of Homer's father.</P>
<P>The kids are not discouraged. Homer doesn't say "I Have a Dream" but could.
Against the odds, the quartet scrounge for materials, build one rocket
after another, meet failure after failure, but also make progress,
doggedly, as they learn from their mistakes --until they triumph. All the
while, the unexpected keeps happening, as does, in Homer's life and
travails, the semi-expected, the inflexible opposition of his dad. Thank
God for the understanding of his sweet, smart and helpful mother, warmly
played by Natalie Canerday..</P>
<P>Since I do not know the source book, the best seller memoir "Rocket Boys"
by Homer H. Hickam Jr. who went on to become a science engineer at NASA, I
cannot tell which poetic-filmic liberties the movie took. Homer Hickam is
said to have been pleased by the movie.</P>
<P>Bits of audience manipulation are unavoidable, but no drawbacks. One
example. A nice metal-worker who had been helping the boys suddenly quits
his job to become a miner. He is older but he has debts and can earn twice
as much by going down the shaft. The scene is touchingly true. But then, as
he checks in (or is it out?) he hangs up his miner's medallion No 723 on a
board. The camera zooms in on it. Any experienced filmgoer will tell you
that something bad will happen later, and that the camera will re-zoom on
tag No 723.</P>
<P>The main shooting was in the town of Petros, Tennessee, in the Knoxville
area, since  Coaltown is no more. The reproduction of the place, times and
people is superior. What also emerges in a near-documentary way is the
hard, pathetic life of the coal mining community. The miners and their
families seem to take their lot  for granted. It is late into the film when
Union protests emerge. Even so, there is little that is militant (the Us
vs. Them --the mine owners-- element) in the story.</P>
<P>The characters have been beautifully cast. Laura Dern as the school
teacher, a smart, helpful and unprovincial West Virginian has a supporting
(in every sense) role which takes her into new directions. Ironically,
Chris Cooper, as Homer's able but intransigent and anti-union father,  had
the lead role as the United Mine Workers'  strike organizer (and hero) in
historically true Matewan (1987), that superb  film by John Sayles about
the coal-mine wars in Matewan, West Virginia, during the 1920s.</P>
<P>Most everything rings true in this realistic yet feel-good picture. It is a
family movie in the  sense of its PG rating, and a family movie in its
depiction of the Hickams.  But the inevitably sad background of the miners'
life not only is not underlined but it is balanced by a great deal of
upbeat parts and humor concerning the Rocket Boys. They are the first to
admit that "we're just a bunch of hillbillies," yet they pursue a dream
that is as far from redneck-ism as can be.</P>
