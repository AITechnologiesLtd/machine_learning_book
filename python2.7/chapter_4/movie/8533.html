<PRE>Review: The Castle (Rob Sitch), 1997</PRE>
<P>"The Castle" is the debut film for the writing team of Rob Sitch, Tom
Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Jane Kennedy, who will be familiar to
Australian audiences for their television work. The four were writers
and performers as part of the Melbourne comedy outfit The
D-Generation, and after that group achieved its ultimate form (in all
senses of the word) on the much-missed "Late Show," they went on to
the current affairs satire "Frontline" (known in some countries
overseas, apparently, as "Behind the Frontline"). That was an
excellent show, if occasionally overly preachy and shy about admitting
its obvious indebtedness to America's "The Larry Sanders Show."
(Ironically, I remember seeing one report here attack "Larry Sanders"
as nothing but a "Frontline" rip-off). By this time, the group had
established themselves as a miniature production company, maintaining
extremely tight creative control. On "Frontline," three of the four
played major roles in addition to their writing; all of them directed
episodes, and Cilauro took charge of the camerawork. Such tight
supervision (and reluctance to surrender any creative processes to
outsiders) is a double-edged sword, as it may be accompanied by an
insular refusal to acknowledge problems. Certainly "Frontline," in its
last season or so, occasionally seemed unable to diagnose and correct
its faults.</P>
<P>It was therefore a pleasure to find the group doing such fine work in
"The Castle". The film tells the story of the Kerrigans, a working
class family in the northwest suburbs of Melbourne (it says something
about Australian society, however, that the family is shown to own
five cars, a boat, and a holiday house, and still be understood to be
working class). They live directly adjacent to Melbourne's Tullamarine
airport, but can't understand why they got their house so cheap; to
them, the modest little home is a castle. When the airport wants to
expand, however, their home is subject to a compulsory acquisition
order. The Kerrigans, led by Daryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) decide to
fight, eventually taking their case to the High Court in Canberra. As
a TV report puts it late in the film, it's "Daryl versus Goliath."
The comedy in the film comes from the contrast between the naive,
uneducated Kerrigans (if they lived in the country, you'd call them
"down to earth") and the smug, upscale lawyers and judges they come up
against. Sitch and co spend a long time establishing the family, and
this material skates on thin ice with its apparent mockery of the
working class Australian. Yet the tone is maintained well beautifully,
and it becomes clear that the Frontline team genuinely like their
heroes. Sitch has claimed in interviews that much of Daryl Kerrigan's
behaviour is modelled on his own father, and it becomes clear that
"The Castle" is not intended as a joke on other people: we're supposed
to recognise ourselves in the Kerrigans, whatever our background. Much
of what we laugh at in "The Castle" is found in Australians of all
backgrounds: the obsessive scanning of the Trading Post ("Now what
would you want with a pair of jousting sticks?"), the obsessive
multiple car ownership, the sports mania, even the briefly glimpsed
Ugh boots. This self-deprecation (like the disdain for authority
figures) is such an Australian theme that it is likely to puzzle any
overseas audiences (as will culturally specific references such as the
allusions to the Mabo case). Fortunately, "The Castle" has been such a
hit on home soil that it will not need any cross-over success in
overseas markets.</P>
<P>Sitch's direction is appropriately actor oriented: this is not a
technically impressive venture. The hand-held look used to create a
cinema verite look on "Frontline" has wisely been abandoned, replaced
by a bare bones, unobtrusive style. Shot in eleven days, this is the
kind of film where a pan comes across as a major cinematic innovation.
It is, therefore, the cast that really sell the material: all the
actors portraying the Kerrigans are great, with Caton a stand-out.
Tiriel Mora, a "Frontline" veteran, is appropriately harried as the
well-intentioned but inexperienced lawyer (asked what section of the
Constitution his case is based on, he responds "ah... it's just the
vibe.") Many other familiar faces from Australian films and TV turn up
in the supporting cast: Charles (Bud) Tingwell plays the kindly QC who
steps in at the Kerrigan's direst hour; Sophie Lee plays the
Kerrigan's oldest daughter; Eric Bana is her new husband; and Bryan
Dawe plays one of the opposing lawyers. John Flaus, Lynda Gibson, and
Tony Martin (as Bud Tingwell's son!) turn up in cameo appearances. As
far as I could detect, none of Sitch, Gleisner, Kennedy or Cilauro
made so much as a walk-on, though a news reporter's voice heard late
in the piece sounds suspiciously like Kennedy.</P>
