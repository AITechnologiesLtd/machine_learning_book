<PRE>                              OFFICE SPACE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Give BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD creator Mike Judge enough rope, and he may
just hang himself.  In his first live-action outing, Judge does a fair
job at making sick jokes about corporate America, he just doesn't seem
to make enough of them, ultimately leaving OFFICE SPACE a bit flat.</P>
<P>     Straight from SWINGERS, Ron Livingston makes a surprisingly good
Everyman as Peter, so sick of his job ("In a week, I'd say I do 15
minutes of real work.") that he goes to a hypnotherapist for relaxation
treatment.  Of course (and the trailer doesn't tell you this), the
therapist dies while Peter is under, leaving him in an ultra-relaxed
state without a care in the world.  (What's particularly funny is that
OFFICE SPACE was shot in high-tech ghetto north of my old hometown of
Austin, Texas, where the "go-getter" attitude is severely frowned-upon.)</P>
<P>     Anyway, after the therapy, Peter has a whole new outlook on work. 
But oddly, Peter soon goes from apathetic to outright seditious, all
while imminent downsizing is about to take place.  This culminates in a
silly subplot lifted from SUPERMAN III (they say so right in the movie!)
about stealing fractions of pennies from the company.</P>
<P>     That Peter gets a new girl (Aniston) in the bargain is foregone
conclusion.  That plenty of apropos, out-of-place wackiness is included,
courtesy of Judge, is also a given.</P>
<P>     Now I'm not a killjoy.  I've had lots of jobs that are very much
like Initech's idiocracy.  Sadly, I'm afraid that too many people are
going to genuinely take Judge's advice and try to get promoted by
sleeping in and being lazy.  While the underlying message is sound
(Don't take work too seriously:  IT'S JUST A JOB!), Judge might have
been wise to preface the film with the same message given on episodes of
B&B: "Don't try this at home."</P>
