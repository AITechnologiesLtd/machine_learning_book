<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The venerable LETHAL WEAPON franchise continues its frightful
   tailspin in this tired fourth installment, a formulaic entry whose
   sole apparent purpose is to reunite its familiar cast of characters
   and recycle their old shtick -- we've got Riggs (Mel Gibson) and
   Murtaugh (Danny Glover) squabbling like an old married couple (which,
   after eleven years of onscreen partnership, they more or less are),
   Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) throwing another hissy fit, Lorna (Rene Russo)
   kicking butt (while pregnant, yet), Murtaugh's family endangered
   *yet* again, action and pyrotechnics galore .. hey, it even has Riggs
   doing his signature weirdo arm-socket popping thing!</P>
<P>   Terrific, but haven't we seen this all before?  In the studio's mad
   rush to get the picture in the can -- LETHAL WEAPON 4 began filming
   in January and hit theatres by July, a breakneck pace for a
   heavy-duty star-driven studio flick -- it's clear that the idea was
   to churn out cookie-cutter material by simply dusting off the
   increasingly-sanitized cops the audience has grown to love.  Their
   escapades are all framed within some lazy excuse of a plot -- an
   uninspired piece of vapidity involving Chinese Triad members
   smuggling immigrants for slave labour -- which nobody takes very
   seriously, least of all the film's wisecracking characters.  The
   filmmakers' obvious smug inference is that reassembling the cast and
   running them through the usual series of hijinx *should* be
   sufficiently entertaining.  Familiarity breeds complacency, and
   apparently contempt.</P>
<P>   Well, it almost comes together.  The supporting cast accumulated from
   previous films are obligingly trotted out for requisite appearances,
   legitimately adding little to the mix other than a sense of assuring
   recognition.  My hopes were pinned upon the traditional infusion of
   new blood for this entry coming in the form of outrageous comedian
   Chris Rock (and given the series' growing reliance on jokey
   sensibilities, it was inevitable that a bonafide comic would
   eventually be cast), joining the fray as brash rookie cop Lee
   Butters.  Sadly, his formidable gifts are wasted here, stifled by the
   confines of his surprisingly straight character -- other than his
   eager-to-please relationship with Murtaugh, the film gives Butters
   has no personality of his own to speak of.</P>
<P>   The franchise's indelible appeal, for better or worse (and it's the
   latter if you ask me -- consider its devolution from an edgy action
   thriller centered on a fearlessly suicidal cop to a resolutely
   mainstream product where everybody seems ready to break out into
   group hugs), is the good-natured sense of camaraderie in sickening
   full display here.  From its action-packed opening to its photobook
   conclusion, LETHAL WEAPON 4 is a film *about* its characters -- this
   is, after all, a picture in which an explosive firefight with an
   armoured maniac actually serves as glossy window-dressing for scenes
   of character background and development -- and it's ultimately a
   showcase for the quintessential mismatched buddy team of Riggs and
   Murtaugh, trading quips as they bicker their way through the motions
   of cracking the case.  By now, they've become as all-American as
   apple pie, and the polished, engaging chemistry of their actor
   counterparts remains intact, but by this stage of the game, they're
   going through the motions.</P>
<P>   On the plus side, the film features a few inventively staged (albeit
   logically ludicrous) action sequences and some dynamic mano-a mano
   fight scenes courtesy of Hong Kong wunderkind Jet Li, but as the
   series creatively wheezes and sputters (an obvious tip-off: resorting
   to the use of a Cute Young Kid -- a typical death-knell), my
   idealistic side hopes that the filmmakers have the good sense to
   gracefully mothball the franchise after this picture.  My cynical,
   anything-for-a-buck side, on the other hand...</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
