<PRE>ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE
**** Of **** grade is A-</PRE>
<PRE>By Jason Overbeck</PRE>
<P>Robert Blake plays John Wintergreen, a short motorcycle cop who wants to be
a detective.  He gets an opportunity when he stumbles upon a dead body, that
might be a suicide, and does solid investigative work.  He takes notes about
everything from the body to the shell fragments in the bread loaf.  When he
tells off a lazy coroner he catches the eyes of a real detective who takes
him along as his driver.  Together they investigate the death, with the
detective showing the motorcycle cop the ropes.</P>
<P>Why this film doesn't have more of a following is a mystery to me.  It is
quirky, funny, exciting and violent.  It is a wonderful character study and
smart crime yarn.  It has motorcycle chases and flashy photography to rival
some of the best.  Every actor gives a strong and believable performance.
The standout being Robert Blake, most recently seen as the mystery man in
Lost Highway.  He creates a complex and smart character that has a lot more
going for him when he's not over ambitious.</P>
<P>Blake also gets some subtly hilarious scenes where his smarts and vertical
challenge provide some memorable moments.  My favorite sneaks across the
screen when Blake pulls over a man for speeding.  He finds out this man is a
detective and starts a friendly conversation.  After the exchange Blake
hands the detective the ticket and stands quietly calm as the detective
throws a fit.</P>
<P>Electra Glide in Blue has an ending that comes from a distant galaxy but
that adds to the film's charm and tone, which is always off kilter.  I
strongly recommend it to fans of action films sprinkled with art
sensibilities and independent flavoring.  It reminds me of the tone reached
in the great Robert Altman film The Long Goodbye.  The film is all about
little scenes and intelligent genre tackling.</P>
