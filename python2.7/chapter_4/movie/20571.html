<P>"Haven't you ever loved anything that much?"</P>
<P>Starring Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>As Waterworld and The Postman prove, Kevin Costner fares better, both
cinematically and financially, when he surrenders the director's chair
to one of his betters and constrains himself to merely being the star.
In For Love of the Game, Costner's triumphant return to baseball (see
Field of Dreams and Bill Durham), the man behind the camera is Sam Raimi
(The Evil Dead, A Simple Plan), an unpretentious yet sublimely confident
auteur with an amazing range (he went from cheesy horror to crime drama
to baseball romance). Raimi's latest is also the best we've seen from
Costner since Tin Cup; an engaging, interestingly structured drama
nearly botched by its denoument. Those who seek to have an unabashedly
positive memory of the film would do well to leave right after its
baseball game centerpiece, the place where it should have been cut off.</P>
<P>For Love of the Game has a baseball backdrop but it is not a "baseball
movie". It's about Billy Chapel (Costner), a great pitcher in the
twilight of his career, who has just been told that he is being traded
from the Detroit Tigers; the team he has played with for some 19 years.
At the same time, he finds out that Jane (Kelly Preston), his long-time
girlfriend decided to leave him. As he goes into his last game of the
season, his last game with the Tigers and possibly his last game, he
remembers and examines important moments in his roller coaster
relationship, discovering more about it than he did during its course.</P>
<P>They met when he saw Jane's car stalled on the side of a highway, with
Jane kicking the living headlights out of the poor vehicle. Being a nice
guy, Billy stops to help, and this being Hollywood, he invites her to go
to a baseball game with him. One thing leads to another and they wind up
together in Billy's hotel room. Now that they've slept together, he
thinks, they're in a relationship, but not so fast: Jane shuns the idea,
wanting to make sure she does not become a "groupie".</P>
<P>After being chased enough times by Billy, she gives it up and the three
(Jane has a daughter) move in together. They are doing wonderfully until
he badly hurts his arm in a woodshop accident. He is determined to make
a comeback and return to the mound; his trainer and his girlfriend are
doubtful and less than supportive. Without thinking the matter through,
Billy explodes and makes Jane leave; an action he comes to regret and
attempts to reconcile.</P>
<P>The love story is told almost exclusively through flashback, the film
cutting back and forth between it and the all-important baseball game
(in which, by the way, Chapel tries for a perfect game). It's not the
most original style of storytelling, but it works because Raimi
effectively and subtly injects the flashbacks with a common theme.
Indeed, up to the last ten minutes, I had a sneaking suspicion that this
might be that rare Hollywood love story that's actually about something.
It built up enough momentum that I was ready for a conclusion to drive
its point home. Instead, what has been a compelling tale of a man
learning to depend on himself turns into a banal, typical, hollow
romance.</P>
<P>This cruel bait-and-switch can only detract from the film to a certain
point. Despite its eventual thematic inadequacies it remains a perfectly
entertaining Tinseltown production. Under the sure direction of Sam
Raimi, it's a lot of fun to watch, even if it's not much else. The
suspense of the baseball game is genuine (though the trailers
thoughtlessly gave away the result) and the romance feels real (most of
the time). There is a fight scene (relationship quarrel, not martial
arts) that is so well-written it's devastating.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner does his job in a relatively straightforward role; though
he has his moments and though I can't point out anything specifically
wrong with what he does, he still tends to fall short of outstanding.
His character is engaging but not really because of Costner's
performance. Kelly Preston, on the other hand, is wonderful. We can
understand why a man would be so interested in her, because we are
equally enchanted. Jane's daughter, played well by Oscar winner Anna
Paquin, is an unusual character because she is not strapped with the
cliche of hating her mom's new boyfriend; a refreshing occurence as
almost all movie kids in a single-parent home are required to despise
their parent's new love interest.</P>
<P>I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched with my hands on my head in
desperation as it grossly undermined itself in the last act. It kept
itself from being anything beyond a solid and entertaining but typically
empty mainstream drama. It's a fun movie -- I recommend it for that --
but little more.
