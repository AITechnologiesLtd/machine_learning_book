<P>TV-Style-One-Line-Summary
-------------------------
     A bleak, apocalyptic derelict flays the comfortable illusions away
from everyone he meets, strangers and friends alike.</P>
<P>Tak Summary
-----------
     This movie doesn't have much of a "plot" in that the characters
are out to save the world, solve a mystery, or avoid a slasher.
Rather, it's a character study.  We're watching Johnny, a likable
slimebag as he moves about from bars, to his ex's apartment, back to
the streets, and back to the the apartment.  That's about it.</P>
<P>     But, oh, the things you'll experience along the way. Just let
director Mike Leigh yank your emotions over various sugar-coated
razors, gilded knives, and warm, fuzzy, cuddly, parasites.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     Ok, first a confession.  I missed the first fifteen minutes, as
we had difficulty finding the theatre. (Yeah, I know, how hard can it
be?  Trust me, this one's *obscure*.)  So there may have been things
(perhaps important things) at the beginning that I missed.  However, I
think the rest of the movie was compelling enough to warrant a review,
or perhaps I should call it a "warning."</P>
<P>     Think back to that movie you saw that really, really, disturbed
you--but in such a way that you just *might* wanna watch it again,
tell some friends about it, or at least think about it for a long time
to come.  Was it perhaps ERASERHEAD or other David Lynch madness?
Maybe it was DELIVERANCE?  How about the pain and anguish in FAREWELL
MY CONCUBINE? Or maybe some little scene hidden in an otherwise
innocuous movie like FLATLINERS?  Well, NAKED shoves all those right
aside to get my vote as most disturbing movie.</P>
<P>     The title is aptly picked.  NAKED is not about naked flesh (more
on this in a bit), it is about naked emotions. After watching this
movie, I felt as if my defenses had been stripped away, and held high
over my head, leaving my naked emotions bubbling up all over the place
and making a mess.  (Where'd that come from?! -self_editing_tak)  I
think the director's main tool in achieving this is the "satanic
angel," Johnny.  He's such a likable guy on the surface.  You really
*want* to like him.  I actually found myself making excuses and
forgiving this slimebag.</P>
<P>     Why's he a slimebag?  Well, he's the essence of the abuse of
power.  And he really gets into it--in all kinds of ways.  There are
several scenes where he date-rapes women, and numerous other equally
disturbing scenes without physically abuse.  No, far worse, he merely
*talks* to them and presents them with a black and twisted reflection
of their life.  I think that's far worse.  In one scene, he charms his
way into a lonely, shy, and painfully co-dependent waitress's
apartment.  He charms her into feeding him, steals her favorite book
while her back is turned, uses her shower, then turns on her verbally.
He exposes all her little self-lies about where her life is headed,
what she's doing now, what she did in the past, and tries to toy with
her sense of pity.  Luckily, she has the sense to throw him out, but he
leaves her shattered and crying at the top of her stairs.</P>
<P>     Aside from all that, he's a likable character.  I think I liked
him because he's a surly bastard/cuss.  He's got a razor sharp wit,
cutting sarcasm, a sense of irony, and a broad-ranging knowledge.  But
it was disturbing to find yourself liking Johnny and suddenly
remembering or seeing more of his atrocities.  Makes me really wonder
how I could like someone so thoroughly nasty.</P>
<P>     Not *once* is sex or nudity portrayed in anything close to a
sensual, erotic or even desirable fashion.  Actually, I was rather
repulsed by the whole concept of nudity and sex for awhile after this
movie.  Eeah.  The only time you see flesh is when it is being sexually
or physically abused.  Jeremy, as loathsome a figure as Johnny,
continually struts around in nothing but skimpy briefs that show off
his trim figure.  Leigh seems to be associating sexuality and the body
image with some very unattractive behaviors and ideas.</P>
<P>     At one point in the movie Johnny is offered a chance to change his
life around.  We see him dreaming of a better life in another place.
But when Louise, the strongest character in the movie, offers him a
chance to realize his dream, he declines.  I'm left with the impression
that he's much more comfortable complaining about how bad life is,
rather than doing anything about it.</P>
<P>     This movie is *ripe* for moral analogies.  In one interpretation,
Johnny represents the petty abuses of power.  He's a derelict and his
crimes are senseless and random.</P>
<P>     Jeremy also abuses power, although he is wealthy, confident,
irrepressibly arrogant, smug and in a traditional position of power.
The most disturbing thing about his rape scene was not the actual act,
but the inevitable acceptance with which Sofie accepted it.  I saw it
coming a mile away, and so did she.  She actually shrugged and sighed,
as if to say "Not this again..."  At that point, it wasn't "rape," but
"sleeping-with-your-pig-of-a-boss" kind of attitude, but it quickly got
way outta Sofie's control.</P>
<P>    The main women in the movie seen to represent a broad spectrum of
how people in society deal with abuses in power.  Sofie puts up with
it, another ignores and denies it, and Louise won't take any of it.</P>
<P>     On a good note, Johnny has some fascinating speeches.  Two of my
favorite scenes in the movie were when Johnny explains that bar codes
are the "sign of the beast" foretold in Revelation, and a when Johnny
tries to re-unite some oddly matched Scottish(?) lovers.  And a scene
toward the end of the movie where the distraught apartment owner tries
to restore sanity to her house provides much needed comic relief.</P>
<P>Technical Comments (bitch-n-moan section)<HR>     Sometimes I felt as if I was missing things because of the thick
English accents all the characters had to varying degrees.  It's easy
to get used to, but occasionally becomes distorted to my ear when
emotions are high-strung.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     This is a hard one. I really did like this movie, though it wasn't
exactly fun. I'd definitely recommend you experience it (Don't just
*see* it).  But it is disturbing and you'll need to talk/brood about it
afterwards.  I might be tempted to see this again, but only in the same
manner that you'd pick at a scab or carefully worry a toothache that is
capable of sharp, piercing pains.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
 X  see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
<P>ps: And here's some more text from the Press Release....</P>
<P>Press Synopsis/Scream sheet
---------------------------
     Two major awards were bestowed upon NAKED at last spring's Cannes
Film Festival--Mike Leigh (HIGH HOPES, LIFE IS SWEET) garnered the Best
Director prize and David Thewlis' riveting performance resulted in the
Best Actor reward.  For writer/director Leigh, NAKED marks a shift from
the skewed and wildly imaginative themes of his earlier work to one
that contains a deeper and darker undercurrent as he renders a
provocative and moving vision of contemporary England.  Still remaining
at the core of a Leigh film is a gallery of eccentrics coupled with
offbeat black comedy.</P>
<P>     Johnny (Thewlis) is a vagrant enduring a life devoid of meaning or
direction. His scroungy good looks inspire trust and beneath the skinny
frame and sad expression there is a sense of reassurance.  But it is
all a disguise.  This satanic angel is as capable of expressing love as
is Jack the Ripper.  Wandering London, Johnny leaves a trail of living
corpses--wild flights of absurd rhetoric are interspersed with the most
eccentric of characters.  All the while, he is half-hearted in his
avowed goal of reconciliation with his former girlfriend.  As seen
through the eyes of Johnny, NAKED is a compelling portrait of urban
existence where the viewer alternately sees the violence and
gentleness, the comedy and tragedy of life.  Acclaims were embellished
upon NAKED as it premiered at the recent New York Film Festival with
critic Vincent Canby stating, "a brilliant somersault of a movie that
lands Leigh in new cinematic territory."</P>
