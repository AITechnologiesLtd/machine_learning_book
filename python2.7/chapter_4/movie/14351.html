<P>Few people liked this film, either for the music or for the story. How dare
a film maker make a genius look like such an idiot, and not act like the
great composer and bad person that he can be/was.</P>
<P>Like AMADEUS, and many of the other films that have been done about any
composer in the past, there are a few literary licenses in this story, but,
there is very little else that is implausible or not well done.  while
scholars may disagree as to Anton Schindler's
whereabouts and doings, the film decides that a nice little story, however
far fetched is may be, is better than two over weight professors discussing
the merits of the thirteenth bar in the Adagio of the Third Symphony.  And
like AMADEUS, we see the story in retrospect, through the story telling of
his own son.  And he is the real story.</P>
<P>Beethoven left his estate to the mother of his son, but he had a hard time
admitting, and let anyone else know that it was his own brother's wife, with
whom he had an affair prior to her leaving for his brother.  He never
recovered from that, specially when they knew the child was his.</P>
<P>And much of the music seems to be designed around the life story of the
growing of this child.  In the meantime, Anton is searching for Beethoven's
Immortal Beloved, the woman he wrote some poetry and much music about.  And
some of his paramours, and various patrons of the arts, do not really know
who she is.  All they know is that he always leaves for her, whoever she is.</P>
<P>If anything, Bernard Rose's story gives us a nice ending, to the story that
has gone unforgiving and forgotten for so very long.  What triggered this
man to write so much, and so well, given his terrible condition and curse of
deafness in the field of
listening.</P>
<P>Gary Oldman is excellent as Beethoven, as are all the women in the film.
And the music is beautifully directed around the events, or otherwise. It
comes in and goes out quietly, and teaches Hollywood one thing it can not
do.  Choreograph real soundtracks with meaningful stories.   We know that
these two go together, and it is many people's opinions as to how they
should.  The invisible part is how it all got written behind all the anger.
Hollywood only uses fill-ins.  It hasn't had a real composer since Bernard
Herrman, whose music could be considered better than any movie ever made.
The same is the case here.</P>
<P>The music isn't worshipped. It is just played and mixed and matched to the
various people. And the result is excellent.  Even if the story may not be
true.  Who cares.  It still is a very good film with excellent acting and
costumes.</P>
<PRE>NICE FILM TO SEE.
A little culture, anyone.?
