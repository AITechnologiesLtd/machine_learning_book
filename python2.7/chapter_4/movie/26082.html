<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A flat fictionalized version of the infamous Appalachian Mafia meeting
in the 1950s of all the top crime bosses. In this version, shot in B/W,
semi-documentary style, the meeting takes place in crime boss Dan
Regent's (Platt) house in upstate N.Y., in a place called Apple Lake.
Grant Richards plays a Lucky Luciano Mafia kingpin-type called Johnny
Lucero, returning illegally to the US after ten years deportation. He
plans to be here for a few hours on the day of the September 18th mob
meeting, sneaking into the country by landing his private plane in a
small upstate airport. Lucero arranges for the gangland meeting to
reorganize the Mafia after the attempt on his life was uncovered and the
mob's business isn't growing at a rapid enough pace for him.</P>
<P>Augie Martello (DeCorsia), eastern boss of the Mafia, arranged for the
hit on Lucero, but was thwarted when someone ratted him out. One of
Regent's henchmen, Julie (Gerstle), took the job of rubbing Augie out,
but only wounded him. With Augie still clinging to life in an
undisclosed nursing home, he is visited by his loyal and ruthless
underling, Tony Ledo (Cameron Mitchell). Tony gets his permission to try
and rub Lucero out again, this time at the upstate airfield where he
will land for the meeting. By overturning Lucero's leadership, Augie
plans to become the Mafia big boss. But this hit of Lucero can only be
successful if Augie remains alive, since Tony is too low on the Mafia
totem pole to be accepted for leadership by the other crime bosses.</P>
<P>At the tiny airport, Tony, Sam (Strauss), and Chins (Karlin), three
vicious thugs, hold the one-man airport crew, Rod Balcom (Heydt),
hostage in his workplace house, along with his two daughters, Anne
(Edwards) and Sandy (Nugent). Their plan is to kill Lucero as soon as
his plane lands and then kill the innocent hostages who witnessed the
murder. But complications come about when a state trooper (Brown) visits
Anne and a car mechanic (Monroe) who is dating Sandy, comes over to pick
her up. They also become hostages. One other plane lands, it is Dave
Alto (Carl), someone who didn't show up to the meeting Tony arranged to
go over his plan to get Lucero with the other rebels in the
organization. Tony is suspicious why he comes to this meeting and not
his, being that his wife told Tony she couldn't get hold of him because
he was out fishing. The hostages get a chance to see how ruthless the
Mafia boys are, as they witness the killing of Dave Alto and his pilot.</P>
<P>A news bulletin flash states Augie just died, which causes the worried
Tony to change his plans. He will now bargain with Lucero, telling the
boss he will spare him, but only if he can get the other crime bosses to
give him Augie's place in the organization.</P>
<P>The climax comes when Tony and Lucero attend the meeting, but Lucero
outfoxes him and figures out who the other conspirators were with Augie,
and guns them all down before the state police arrive and arrests the
one's still alive.</P>
<P>Nothing new is uncovered about the Mafia. It all seems like an
exploitive exercise to cash in on the public's curiosity about the
Mafia, especially with all the newspaper reports about its real meeting
taking place in 1959. There is some nasty action, lots of bad guy Mafia
men talking tough to good small town people kind of stuff, but the film
was too dry to be anything but mediocre.</P>
