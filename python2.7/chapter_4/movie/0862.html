                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     A Stephen King novel is to literature what a Big Mac, a large
fries, and a Coke are to fine cuisine.  Both seem like good ideas when
you're hungry, and both taste great -- at least to start.  But after
you're done, you might feel vaguely dissatisfied, and at the very least
you'll have an awful lot of paper -- much of which is strewn with brand
names -- to dispose of.</P>
<P>     And yet, and yet.  Sure, you know pretty much what's going to
happen from the very first page.  And sure, the characters are
comfortable stereotypes, the settings are as familiar as the faithful
golden arches themselves, and the language is post-modern campfire-ese.
King even brings back characters and plot devices like Mickey D's brings
back McRibs: they're never gone long enough for us to really miss them.</P>
<P>     But still.  Can't get enough of 'em, right?  Neither can the
Phantom, who's been a King phan since early on, and has yet to read a
novel or short story that he didn't like -- at least a little.  For the
most part, though, he's liked them quite a lot, and he's always eager to
flex his eye muscles (and his biceps, given the physical -- if not
literary -- heft of King's recent efforts) on the latest from America's
favorite horror writer.</P>
<P>     An odd way to begin a review of MISERY, you might say.  But the
Phantom found as he left the theater that MISERY the film is a lot like
one of King's novels.  Although we never *should* be surprised by
anything that happens, we are.  And although James Caan gives a
perfunctory performance as Paul Sheldon, we're able to overlook it.  And
finally, although we must, as the credits roll, admit to ourselves that
MISERY really isn't much of a horror film, we must also admit that it
was, nonetheless, expertly made, beautifully photographed, and very,
very enjoyable.</P>
<P>     More than anyone else, Rob Reiner seems to have the best idea of
what a Stephen King novel *feels* like.  When he turned King's short
story, "The Body", into STAND BY ME, even non-King phans stood up and
took notice.  But those who *were* King phans, and who had suffered
through countless bad adaptations of his novels, rejoiced.  Here,
finally, was some relief from films like CAT'S EYE, and MAXIMUM
OVERDRIVE (especially MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE), CHRISTINE, GRAVEYARD SHIFT,
and even to some extent THE SHINING (which, while it is a fine horror
film in its own right, bears as much resemblance to a Stephen King novel
as Stephen King bears to a competent film director) -- films which bore
greater or lesser resemblance to the stories from which they were
adapted, but which *felt* nothing at all like them.  (Did the Phantom
mention MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE?)</P>
<P>     It's that feeling of familiarity, that feeling of settling down
around a campfire to hear a ripping good yarn -- and one that you know
will keep you awake until the wee hours of the night -- that is usually
missing from the films made out of King's novels and short stories.
Even THE SHINING, while technically excellent and quite scary enough,
was, however, coldly impersonal and distant -- just the opposite of
King's novel, which got you right inside the haunted Overlook and the
mind of its demented caretaker.</P>
<P>     But although horror may be neither Rob Reiner nor William Goldman's
forte, spinning ripping good yarns most certainly is.  The team who just
three years ago brought us the lightweight but entertaining PRINCESS
BRIDE have collaborated once again and produced the equally lightweight
(at least from a horror standpoint) but equally entertaining MISERY.
And when it comes down to it, after you strip away the blood and gore,
the evil clowns and giant spiders, the rabid dogs and 1950's space
aliens, a Stephen King novel sets out from the very first page to
entertain us.  And although it becomes apparent after only a half hour
that Rob Reiner doesn't really want to scare us very much, it's clear
from the very first frame that he wants to spin us a yarn -- he wants to
keep us entertained.</P>
<P>     In that, MISERY is a resounding success.  As a horror film, and as
an adaptation of one of King's best novels, it's somewhat of a mixed
bag.  The novel MISERY was entertaining, of course, and in many ways it
was a comfortable and familiar King novel, just like the dozens that had
preceded it (and presumably like the hundreds that would follow).  But
it was also a bit of a departure for King, for this novel had no band of
outcast kids; no ghosts or aliens or evil forces ; no apocalyptic battle
between the forces of good and evil; no cast of thousands.  Instead,
MISERY had just two main characters, locked for almost the entire novel
in a battle of wits, a battle which only one could survive.  MISERY is
King's most claustrophobic novel, and one of the most difficult horror
novels to read.  The sense of impending violence, doom, and insanity is
almost unbearable, and King puts us right in the room with his alter
ego, the horror novelist Paul Sheldon.  Sheldon, you see, makes the
mistake of getting into a near-fatal car accident and then getting
"rescued" by his "number one fan," Annie Wilkes, a woman who isn't quite
sane and who doesn't always make a lot of sense.  In other words, a
woman who would find herself quite at home in a Hollywood production
meeting.</P>
<P>     Annie is also a great phan of Misery Chastain, the heroine of
Sheldon's trashy romance novel series.  Although she sets out at first
to help Paul recuperate from his accident (though all the while
preventing him from leaving or getting in touch with anyone in the
outside world), she soon finishes reading his latest (and last) entry in
the "Misery" series.  And she discovers that Paul, in order to free
himself from the creation that had threatened to prevent him from
writing "serious" literature forever, had killed Misery off at the end
of the novel, thus hoping to put the series to rest once and for all.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the only thing Sheldon put to rest was any hope he
might have had of leaving Annie's secluded house before the spring thaw.
Upon finding that Paul killed her heroine -- her "perfect, perfect"
heroine -- Annie flies into a rage and nearly kills Paul before deciding
that instead of killing him he should redeem himself by writing a new
"Misery" novel and returning his most perfect of heroines to its adoring
public.  The rest of the novel is a tense, claustrophobic battle between
Paul and Annie, with enough violence sprinkled throughout to keep even
the most bloodthirsty of King's phans satisfied.</P>
<P>     But the emphasis of the novel, for all its descriptions of mangled
legs and kitchen knives, is on Paul and his desperate attempt to escape
from Annie.  In the process, King gets us inside the minds of both
characters, and as we begin to empathize with Paul, we begin to feel
more and more like we, too, are trapped in the bedroom, helplessly
awaiting Annie's next violent outburst.  That's one of the things that
makes MISERY so difficult to read, and one of the things that makes it a
little different from King's other novels.  Instead of shifting the
action and point of view between a dozen or so major characters, King
keeps the action, points of view, and story focused in that one bedroom,
and forces us to go through everything with Paul -- whether we want to
or not.</P>
<P>     And that's really the problem with MISERY, the film.  Although it
is quite faithful to the novel, and although Kathy Bates seems as born
to the role of Annie Wilkes as Anthony Perkins is to the role of Norman
Bates, Reiner never gets us to feel that same degree of terror and
claustrophobia; in fact, we don't even see things from Paul's point of
view with any degree of consistency.  Reiner opened MISERY up a little,
but as a result it seems that we spend nearly as much time with the
sheriff and his wife as we do with Paul and Annie.  It's almost as if
every time Reiner felt that the audience might be squirming a little
*too* much in their seats, he deliberately pulled back and eased up on
the tension.  In both the novel and the film, Annie is portrayed as
being quite insane, but Reiner makes her nearly as funny as she is
scary; on more than a few occasions, we get to laugh at her expense.
But it's laughter without a payoff, since we're laughing to escape from
whatever tension might have been building.  King never let us escape
that way, but except for two or three specific scenes, Reiner does.</P>
<P>     Another problem with MISERY is James Caan's performance.  It might
be a limitation of Goldman's script; it might be Reiner's direction; or
it might be Caan's inability to make us feel what his character is
feeling; but we, as the audience, never really begin to empathize with
Paul.  Oh sure, we all cringe when Annie threatens to hurt Paul, but
that's more a visceral reaction than true empathy.  What's missing from
MISERY is exactly what made HENRY so good: a performance like the one
that Michael Rooker gave, one that breaks down the barrier between
character and audience.  In HENRY, we felt for a brief while what being
a sociopathic killer was like; but in MISERY, we rarely, if at all, feel
what it must be like to be trapped in bed and held captive by a
madwoman.</P>
<P>     And yet, and yet.  Remember that the Phantom said that MISERY
really *felt* like a King novel?  Well it does, although sadly that
novel is not MISERY.  But for all its problems, MISERY is, like a good
King novel, completely captivating from beginning to end.  It forgoes
any chance of being a full-tilt horror film, but if it's seen neither as
a strict adaptation of King's novel nor a serious horror film, MISERY
works just fine.  It works for the same reason that many of King's
novels work: because it is out and out entertaining, regardless of
whatever problems an audience might have with it.</P>
<P>     Of course, MISERY isn't necessarily family entertainment, even
though the Phantom doesn't believe that it has its heart set on horror.
There are enough violent scenes to keep all but the most hard-core
horror phan -- or phan of the novel -- satisfied.  And when Reiner
decides to let Ms.  Bates loose, it is simply impossible to take your
eyes off the screen or your nails out of your mouth.  We're even willing
to forgive the old "Oh no!  The car's almost in the driveway" routines
and a pretty fair SLC quotient.  Reiner can be forgiven for this, since
as the Phantom has said, he's new to the horror game, and it's really
not his type of film.  On the other hand, his direction is always crisp
and the editing is first rate.  It's a tribute to Reiner's skill that he
can throw in tilted camera shots, shots of a full moon, thunder and
lightning just before something bad happens, and a dozen other tried and
true horror film cliches -- and make them all work (or at least keep us
from realizing that they're cliches until after the credits roll).  And
there are moments when it's obvious that he's gotten right into the
spirit of things; at least a half-dozen times throughout the film, it's
as if Reiner has forgotten that he just set out to spin an entertaining
yarn, rather than direct a full-tilt horror film.  On those occasions,
he gets the camera right up into Paul and Annie's (especially Annie's)
faces, and he really lets Kathy Bates go to town.  And for just a while
we are treated to some truly scary scenes.  But inevitably the scenes
end all too quickly, and usually without much of a payoff, and we're
back to MISERY: THE CAMPFIRE STORY rather than MISERY: THE HORROR FILM.</P>
<P>     So, phans, when it comes down to the final analysis, MISERY is
quite good, and it stands as one of the better adaptations of one of
King's novels (which isn't, of course, saying much), though it's really
not too much of a horror film itself.  But if you don't go into it
expecting the atmosphere that King labored so hard to create or the
tension and claustrophobia that pervaded his novel, the Phantom thinks
you'll find it well worth seeing.  In fact, it's worth seeing if for no
reason other than to see Kathy Bates' truly lunatic performance.
Lunatic performances are all too rare these days, and the Phantom thinks
that Bates' Annie Wilkes makes Chucky look like Charlie McCarthy in
comparison.  And that should be reason enough for a horror phan to check
out MISERY before it leaves the theaters and heads for a very
un-rightful resting place between copies of LIFEFORCE and MY BLOODY
VALENTINE on the horror shelves of Blockbusters nationwide.  It may not
be a great horror film, but it deserves *much* better company than that.</P>
