<PRE>                          KULL THE CONQUEROR
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: King Kull comes to the screen as
          Rafaella Di Laurentiis continues her father's
          series of Robert E. Howard adaptations.  Badly
          damaged by a horrible musical score and unmemorable
          villains and a bit too much sex, the film is still
          manages to be an acceptable adolescent adventure.
          Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4); 5 (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     Last year we had the film THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD tell us about the
personality of Robert E. Howard who from rural Texas spun yarns of
barbarians fighting sorcerers.  His chief character was Conan but some
of his stories were about King Kull and took place in an earlier
never-was.  Kevin Sorbo, who plays TV's Hercules-with-pants stars as
the title barbarian.  The chief problem with this film is that it tells
its story without worry too much what its audience is.  The plot is a
little lightweight for an adult audience and has a little too much
sex-play for a children's film.</P>
<P>     Kull (Kevin Sorbo) is a barbarian fighter come to join an army in
a country with an old and unbalanced king.  The king has several sons
fighting for the throne.  In a fit of anger the old king kills some of
his sons and Kull fights the king to stop him.  Mortally wounded the
old king names the angry barbarian newcomer as his successor.  Suddenly
Kull is a king with new enemies trying to steal his kingdom.  And his
enemies are willing to make bonds with the forces of evil including an
old sorceress, Akivasha (Tia Carrere) who is revived from the dead to
be an ally of the vengeful brothers.</P>
<P>     The film is written by Charles Pogue who gave us DRAGONHEART last
summer.  While it is not a highly ambitious goal to capture Robert E.
Howard's style in a script, he does a reasonable job.  The villains
could have had a little more depth.  Of course one of Kull's better
villains, Thulsa Doom, was borrowed for CONAN THE BARBARIAN.  Conan
lived well after Doom in Howard's pseudo-history.  Here the problem was
the script had times when it was a little hard to follow and there was
perhaps a little too many "Shall I undress now, your highness?" scenes
for a film essentially intended for adolescent audiences.</P>
<P>     Director John Nicoletta makes unfortunately makes little effort to
preserve the period feel and it is here that the film falls down the
most.  The horses are shoed and have bridals that would look too modern
in a Civil War film.  But Nicoletta's biggest mistake is in allowing
Joel Goldsmith's totally misplaced main theme.  It is difficult to
evoke so ancient a period with electric guitars and Joel's attempt is
merely jarring and obnoxious.  The visual effects are not always
convincing, including some bad mattes, but for me that is a small
fault.</P>
<P>     Sorbo is not the most exciting actor in the world.  Charleton
Heston claimed he was cast in a lot of historical films because people
thought he had a historical sort of face.  I am told by one of the
women that Sorbo's great virtue is his pectorals.  But Sorbo does not
really evoke a historical period.  Part of it may be that he never
dresses for the period.  As with the Conan films, there is an odd mix
of cultures and races in the primeval world.  Most of the sets are
Egyptian-looking.  Sorbo's sidekicks include a priest of an unknown
cult played by Litefoot, who played the title role of INDIAN IN THE
CUPBOARD.  Tia Carrere is of Chinese descent, I believe.  Then there is
Harvey Fierstein as a pirate captain.  I cannot honestly say he was
badly cast since had I never seen him before he might have not seemed
all that strange in this role.  For once his gravelly voice might have
made him seem tough.</P>
<P>     Tone down the sex and this might have made a decent matinee film.
As it is there is a lot of sex but no nudity and a lot of violence with
virtually no blood.  I rate this one a high 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
