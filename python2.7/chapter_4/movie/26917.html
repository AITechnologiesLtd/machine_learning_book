<PRE>THE ART OF AMALIA</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten

 Director: Bruno de Almeida
 Writer:  Bruno de Almeida, Frank Coelho
 Cast: Amalia Rodrigues, John Ventimiglia (narrator), David
Byrne (introduction)</PRE>
<P>   Just eighteen days before the world premiere screening of
Bruno De Almeida's non-fiction pic "The Art of Amalia," we
received word that Julia Child has been awarded the Legion
of Honor, the highest honor that France can bestow.  If you
know the French, you can believe that this medal is rarely
awarded to a foreigner.  How does this current event relate to
Senhor de Almeida's film?  Amalia Rodrigues, Portugal's
best-known singer, was similarly given that award.  For Ms.
Rodrigues the award was perhaps more distinctive since,
after all, Julia Child devoted her life to promoting French
cuisine in the U.S., while Amalia Rodrigues merely performed
several times in Paris.  Obviously Amalia is a performer worth
knowing about.  Bruno de Almeida, who lives in New York,
does a remarkable job bringing her to life in his non-fiction
piece--a ninety-minute work edited down from a five-hour
miniseries that ran on European TV, one which the prestigous
online magazine Film Threat calls "One of the year's best
documentaries."  "The Art of Amalia" is crammed so full of a
variety of song excerpts--count 'em, sixty-seven--that one
wonders how much additional information de Almeida could
have delivered by the unedited version.</P>
<P>   "The Art of Amalia" is notable in part for two reasons.  One
is that the documentary does not go into her personal life,
which should be considered nobody's business unless a
performer wants particularly to expose her affairs to a broad
public. The other is that de Almeida avoids the soul-killing
mistake made by so documentarians of making an audience
sit through a plethora of talking heads--nieces, uncles,
nephews, friends, all gassing about the subject.  There's
really only one talking head, one person sitting and
discussing the subject of the film between shots of actual
performances, and that's Amalia herself.</P>
<P>   Now, nobody can accuse one of the world's great singers
of false modesty.  Discussing her art, she settles poised with
her long, flaming, dyed red hair, talking without apologies
about how she almost literally brought down the house in one
concert in Italy, how she is adored wherever she goes, how
she sang her heart out to the wild applause of her fans. 
That's OK. Why pretend?  We see proof of her
accomplishments by watching her in old newsreels, clips of
studio pressings, and best of all live concerts in Paris, Rome,
Naples, Los Angeles, Libson, Tokyo New York and Rio
among other cities.  We see how she guides huge throngs
into clapping to the rhythms of her more upbeat songs.  </P>
<P>   While we watch Amalia sing in Italian (Tarantella), in
French (Aie Mourrir Pour Toi), and in English (The Nearness
of You), her specialty is fado--Portugal's answer to Spain's
flamenco in that fado songs are passionate, sad, moody, or
to coin the oxymoron used in this film, sweet sadness.  While
flamenco has been embraced by the world to a much greater
extent, popularized in America by Brooklynite Jose Greco,
fado is a genre that has relied for its popularity on just one
person, the subject of this documentary. </P>
<P>   Despite her extravagance of language during her interview
appearance, she is (as Internet critic Brian Matherly points
out for the Jacksonville Film Journal) "overwhelmed at times"
when on stage or presented with medals such as Portugal's
Great Cross of the Order of St. Iago de Espada, and in
Mathherly's view does not emulate "the actions of an
egotistical star who revels in her spotlight and immense
fame."  In fact, she tell us that despite her prominence and
fortune, she was never a happy person and in one instance--
during a trip to New York in 1985--she had planned to end
her life (because of a tumor she had developed, not because
of her experiences in the Big Apple).  But tumor removed,
she continued her 50-year career, surprisingly enough losing
little of her vocal qualities even into her seventies.</P>
<P>   Bruno de Almeida has done a splended job of bringing
together historical film clips from as far back as 1920,
interspersing scenes from performers who influenced Ms.
Rodrigues such as Fred Astaire.  Sadly, she died one week
before the completion of the film, so that our only chance
now to hear her would be through her many, many recordings
and this exceptional film.</P>
