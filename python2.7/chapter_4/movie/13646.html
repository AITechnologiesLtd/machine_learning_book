<PRE>                            LES MISERABLES
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Victor Hugo's often-dramatized novel
          gets a new screen adaptation with Liam Neeson as
          Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as Inspector Javert.
          This is a fairly accurate interpretation of the
          novel, but too often the film is dark-literally and
          in tone--and occasionally the style is bloodless
          and uninvolving.  But it is still a pleasure to see
          one of the world's greatest stories on the wide
          screen.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 8 positive, 4 negative, 6 mixed</PRE>
<P>     The best and certainly the longest novel I ever read--about 1600
pages in my unabridged edition--was Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES.  Hugo
turned slow operatic pacing into a piece of monumental art throwing in
which fifty-page essays were just side comments.  This novel also has
the distinction of being the only piece of written fiction that ever
moved me to tears.  So I was very much looking forward to seeing the
new film version.  The new version is not a screen adaptation of the
popular international musical, but a straight dramatic rendering.  Much
of what I enjoyed of the novel was missing, but then it should come as
no great surprise that not all 1600 pages of story would make it to the
screen.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean, a vicious ex-convict who is turned
in one night into a human saint by the goodness of the Bishop of D.
But in the course of the story he will be tempted to return to evil
many times as his past repeatedly fights to catch up with him.  In this
case his past takes the form of the implacable Inspector Javert,
searching for the missing Valjean.  SHINE's Geoffrey Rush plays the
inflexible lover of law and order Javert who hounds Valjean for years.
As the film opens Jean Valjean has already been released from his
nineteen years in prison, but with his yellow passport nobody will give
him shelter until an old woman suggests he try the door of the Bishop
of D.  After the familiar story of the Bishop's silver, probably the
best-known sequence in the novel, we jump forward ten years to see
Valjean having become the enlightened factory owner and mayor of the
village of Vigo.  Uma Thurman plays Fantine, a woman fired from his
factory who turns to prostitution.  Fantine has got to be the least
glamorous role of Thurman's career.  Behind the (intentionally) ghastly
makeup Thurman is able to put some real passion into her role and gives
as good a performance as I can remember from her.  Her love for her
daughter is a new inspiration for Valjean.  Claire Danes completes the
set of principles as the adult daughter Cosette in a role that requires
little but that she be cute and a bit spoiled.</P>
<P>     The film takes a number of small liberties with Hugo's plotting to
make things going on within characters' heads happen on-screen and more
visibly.  In this version Valjean does not just slip out of the
Bishop's house with the silver; he physically attacks the Bishop.
Valjean's escape to find Cosette is much simplified from the novel and
turned into a carriage chase to add some excitement to the story.  The
Thenardiers are reduced from major characters in the novel to a single
scene.  The modification that is really the most bothersome is the
final meeting of Javert and Valjean.  Apparently Rafael Yglesias, who
wrote the script, wanted a piece of strong dramatic action.  He ends
the film in a major key, where a minor key seems more natural to
portray Javert's final doubts.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson is physically a large man making him instantly more
appropriate than Fredric March was in the classic 1935 version.  Neeson
tends to underplay the role where some more passion would have been
what was expected.  Geoffrey Rush is equally passionless, but in this
case it works to his advantage.  Javert, after all, makes himself
little more than a machine for enforcing rules and laws.  The most
disappointing casting is in having Peter Vaughan play the Bishop of D.
Vaughan appears to be something of a ditherer, a nice man but not one
with a great deal of intellectual power.  Yet the Bishop is really the
most important character in the story, and Valjean is only an extension
of the goodness of the Bishop into a second person. Valjean is the
embodiment of the good that the Bishop did living on rather than being
interred with the Bishop's bones.</P>
<P>     LES MISERABLES too often is just a bit bloodless.  It is a bit
more an intellectual exercise than the story of tragedy and triumph
Hugo wrote.  Still it recalls the passion of the novel.  I would still
give it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
