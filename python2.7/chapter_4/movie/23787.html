<P>It's said that everyone loves an underdog. In that case, the box office 
success of new Julia Roberts vehicle "Erin Brockovich" is all but assured,
for here is a movie all about celebrating the underdog. Not only is its
heroine essentially an everywoman with the same problems and worries that
confront the rest of us, but the villain of the piece is big business, a
favorite target of the common man. The fact that the movie is based on
real life events is merely the icing on the proverbial cake.</P>
<P>The story begins around 1992, when Erin Brockovich (Roberts), a 
twice-divorced mother of three, manages to gain employment at a legal 
firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney). Brockovich has no prior legal
experience and Masry initially balks at the proposition, but Brockovich
finally convinces him to hire her on a trial basis ("Don't make me beg,"
she quietly pleads with him in front of the entire office). Setting to
work as a legal secretary, Brockovich comes across some real estate files
which, to her consternation, include medical records. Gaining no insight
from her reluctant coworkers as to why this might be the case, Brockovich
visits the home of Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) to learn more.</P>
<P>The Jensens live in Hinkley, a small California town built around a
refinery run by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The family has been
plagued by medical problems, and Brockovich soon discovers that the cause
may be hexavalent chromium, a pollutant which has leaked from the PG&E
plant into the groundwater and has been contaminating the community for
the past thirty years. Soon it becomes clear that the health of not just
the Jensens, but indeed most of Hinkley's current and past residents, has
been damaged by PG&E's neglect and outright lies (the company actually
claimed at one point that the chromium in the environment was a type
beneficial to humans). Brockovich manages to convince Masry to take
on the Hinkley case, but must overcome people's perceptions of her own
shortcomings as the lawsuit proceeds forward.</P>
<P>As the title implies, this is a movie not so much about the legal battle
against PG&E as it is about Erin Brockovich herself. As such, it lives and
dies on the performance of Julia Roberts. Fortunately Roberts is up to the
challenge, demonstrating a facility for both the dramatic and comedic
elements of the role. This is not the sort of character one would
necessarily expect Roberts to take on, but it is not hard to see its
appeal. Brockovich is tenacious, brassy and self-confident, an extrovert
willing to speak her mind almost to the point of recklessness. Her life
has not been an easy one -- "I got pregnant too young" she admits at one
point, although there is no question that the overriding passion of her
life is her children -- but she is doing the best she can.</P>
<P>No doubt the aspect of the character which has received the most attention
has been Brockovich's provocative style of dress, but Roberts manages to
pull it off. Rather than making her looking slutty, the clothes help to
accentuate the idea that this is a woman who has her own way of getting
things done, who refuses to be cowed by the expectations of others.</P>
<P>But "Erin Brockovich" is so focussed on the title character that the rest
of the cast largely goes by the wayside. Finney does a respectable job as
Ed Masry, but lives out the movie in Roberts' orbit. Masry's entire
personality seems to be defined in terms of how he reacts to Brockovich,
and consequently he has no capacity to develop on his own. The other major
supporting actor is Aaron Eckhart, playing Brockovich's Harley-loving
next-door neighbor and romantic interest, George. It is here that the film
is at its weakest: their relationship is unconvincing from start to
finish, and the flimsy George is never given much characterization. He
seems to exist purely to either facilitate or complicate Brockovich's
life, and his disappearance from much of the last third of the movie is
all too easily overlooked.</P>
<P>"Erin Brockovich" does a decent job of portraying the real-life legal
struggles against PG&E. It is smart enough to balance the courtroom
dramatics with the more human elements of the case, such as the impact of
the medical problems on the Hinkley families, and the way Brockovich's
involvement affects her relationship with her children. It is peppered
with laughs, but avoids going over the edge into parody. However, the film
struggles to generate any real sense of incident. The lawyers representing
PG&E all come across as hamfisted and ineffectual, and there is never
much of a feeling of risk that things might not work out. Scenes such as
one where Masry discusses the possible bankruptcy of the law firm, and a
court proceeding where a judge could have dismissed the entire suit, are
quickly defused and feel tokenistic.</P>
<P>The movie is also plagued by moments of bizarre characterization. Much is 
made, for example, of Brockovich's love for her kids. And yet, when she
receives an anonymous phone call warning her to stop digging into the 
problems at Hinkley, almost nothing is made of it. This is not to say  
that her decision to proceed with the investigation indicates she doesn't
care about her children; on the contrary, it demonstrates how passionate
Brockovich is about both. But it seems inconceivable to me that she should
treat the incident so offhandedly, dismiss it so easily. This is only
exacerbated by the fact that the threat is never referred to again. What,
then, was the point?</P>
<P>"Erin Brockovich" is a good movie and a good vehicle for Julia Roberts.
But it sets the bar too low, settling for being just another popcorn movie
instead of striving for deeper characterization or a more compelling
screenplay. For a movie about a woman possessed of such determination and
conviction, it is unfortunate that "Erin Brockovich" does not possess
quite the same qualities.</P>
