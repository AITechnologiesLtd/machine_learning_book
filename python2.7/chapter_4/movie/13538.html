<P>For over a year now the trailers have been playing in theaters, and before
every video released by the film's distributor Sony. I personally have been
dying to see this movie from the moment it was announced. This is probably
one of the best movies I have ever seen, and easily the best of the summer.</P>
<P>                                                            The film begins
with a bond style opening, that has Zorro walking to the middle of the
screen and and slashing a Z. After this we have a 20 minute prologue
featuring Anthony Hopkins as Zorro. Hopkins is surprisingly great as Zorro.
I must say this now, I think Hopkins is one of the greatest actors in modern
cinema. The best part of the prologue is the duel between Zorro (as Don
Diego de la Vega) and the film's villain Stuart Wilson. This backed by James
Horner's excellent score make this extraordinary.  Vega's wife is killed and
his baby taken by Wilson, and Vega himself is imprisoned. Flash forward
twenty years to Vega's escape and subsequent training of the new Zorro
played by Antonio Bandares. Antonio's character seeks revenge for the murder
of his brother at the hand of one of the villain's guards.</P>
<PRE>                                            I love this film and everyone
should see it. The acting is great all around, and I liked the subplot about
Hopkins' daughter (played by the stunning Catherine Zeta - Jones).</PRE>
<PRE>This movie easily rates a 10/10</PRE>
