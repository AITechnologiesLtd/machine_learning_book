<PRE>                           POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Petulant, semi-autobiographical comedy
     written by Carrie Fisher about her relationship with her
     mother and the world in general.  There are a couple of nice
     dramatic scenes but not enough to salvage this self-pitying
     story.  Rating: high 0.</P>
<P>     Life can be tough.  It really is not very easy growing up in Hollywood
with no father and a famous movie star mother who wants to run your life.
Then there are all sorts of Hollywood types of people and probably none of
them are looking out for your best interests or treat you as gently as you
think they should.  That is the sad premise of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, with
a screenplay by Carrie Fisher based on her semi-autobiographical novel of
the same name.</P>
<P>     Suzanne Vale (played by Meryl Streep) is a second-rate actress who can
get roles in only third-rate films.  She seems invariably to play women of
action committed to some cause, but she herself is committed to nothing.
She consoles herself with cocaine, which makes her even harder to work with.
Then she takes the drugs a bit too far and ends up in the custody of her
singer-actress mother, Doris Mann (played by Shirley MacLaine), a show
business legend but just as dependent on alcohol and drugs as her daughter.
This all would be pretty bleak if not for Vale's quick wit, which at times
is undeniably funny, and POSTCARDS' laconic view of the nothing-is-as-it-
seems world of Hollywood filmmaking.  The sarcastic wordplay among two and
occasionally three generations of women from one family is perhaps the only
thing preventing POSTCARDS from being a complete melodrama like MOMMY
DEAREST.</P>
<P>     It is a real pity that Fisher and Debbie Reynolds did not play the
characters who were essentially themselves.  It would have added some
authenticity to the roles.  Fisher would have been more believable as an
actress cast in the sort of film in which looks are the most important thing
and acting talent is optional.  Streep would not have been cast in such a
film, regardless of her talent, because she does not have the looks that
women in these films have.  On the other hand, had Fisher and Reynolds
starred, POSTCARDS would have been criticized for where it does
fictionalize.  Some courage points should be awarded to both Streep and
MacLaine for being willing to appear without make-up--each in one scene.
Streep without make-up looks just very plain; how MacLaine looks without
make-up is something of a shock and probably is going to be remembered.  The
scene, however, is essential to the film and gives it the only moments where
it really says something of real interest.  MacLaine's make-up is symbolic
of all the sham and pretense of the Hollywood system, but it cannot be
stripped away without stripping away the dignity.  Much of the value of the
film is dependent on MacLaine being willing to play this scene.</P>
<P>     With the exception of one or two small powerful moments, POSTCARDS FROM
THE EDGE is mostly a thin comedy-drama.  I rate it a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
