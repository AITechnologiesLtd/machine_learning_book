<PRE>Desk Set, 1957</PRE>
<P>Seen on cable television.  Shown in full screen and letterboxed versions;
go for the latter.</P>
<P>In the 1990s it is hard to fathom  the days of yore when there was job
security, or was there? Now, we have downsizing, where it is one against
the other; back in the 1950s it was humanity versus the machine.</P>
<P>In a time where Big Blue beats Kasparov at chess, it is interesting to
watch *Desk Set* now. If you are not familiar with it, rent it or watch
for it on American Movie Classics. Special librarian Bunny Watson
(Katherine Hepburn) matches wits with Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy), who
is looking to install a computer to handle research requests. What results
in the library is rampant paranoia about people losing jobs to the
machine. The machine, by the way, takes up half a room. Laptops were
hardly a concept, yet.</P>
<P>What is really wonderful about this film is the dialogue. It is crispy
written and a joy to hear. Hepburn and Tracy really shine here, and the
supporting cast is not bad either, although they really do take a back
seat to the romantic leads. A particularly good scene is when Bunny's love
interest, Mike (Gig Young), shows up to find Richard in a bathrobe after
having been caught in the rain. The comedy of errors is quite
entertaining.</P>
<P>*Desk Set* also represents one of those rare media portrayals of
librarians as something interesting and positive and worthwhile. [Compare
to its 1990s counterpart *Party Girl*.]</P>
