<PRE>                             ANALYZE THIS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule:  One of the big crime bosses of New
          York decides he needs to see a psychiatrist.
          Harold Ramis gives us a comedy that has a promising
          beginning, but nothing original to do in the middle
          or the end.  Once the good gags are over the film
          seems to have nothing to do but repeat them and
          tell a superficial crime story.  The sub-plots of
          the psychiatrist and his patient, and of the gang
          war are both hackneyed and way, way too
          predictable.  Even the laughs trail off in the
          second half of the film.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), 1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is the head of one of New York City's
two biggest crime families.  But he is losing his drive.  He is beating
people up less and he is feeling their pain more.  For no apparent
reason he will start crying. (The head of a crime family beats people
up himself????  Why does this not seem very likely?)  He decides he
needs good psychiatric help, but he must keep it secret since seeing a
psychiatrist would be seen as a sign of weakness.  Through an odd chain
of events he chooses analyst Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal).  But the last
thing Sobel wants is one of New York's most notorious criminals as a
patient.  Nor does Sobel know how to treat Vitti.  A psychiatrist works
by getting and holding the upper hand over his patient.  No matter what
a patient does the psychiatrist must always be in control of the
situation.  With Vitti he is dealing with a man who is also expert at
control, even if he needs a gun to maintain it.  The two of them begin
a battle for control of their sessions.  It is a struggle that should
have been more interesting than it was.</P>
<P>     But his doctor is not the only opponent that Vitti is battling.
He is in a cold war with Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri), the head of
New York's other major crime family.  And Sobel may become a pawn in
the conflict.  At the most inconvenient times suddenly Sobel will be
summoned to have a silly psychiatric session with Vitti.  It is a gag
repeated as many times as is necessary to fill out the length of the
film.  Writing which is very funny in the first part of the film is
wasted in a film which has much sparser and less funny gags in its
second and third.  This film could have done more with the doctor-
patient relationship, but settles for pop psychology and an instant
miracle cure.  It could have done more with the crime plot, but it
settles for something hackneyed and overly cliched.</P>
<P>     What is curious about the film is that the acting is way below
anybody's standards.  Robert DeNiro coasts along as the gangster, a
part he could play in his sleep.  What gives Vitti potential as a
character is that he has emotional problems, but DeNiro is not used to
playing emotional problems of this sort. When he cries in front of the
camera it is like amateur night tryouts for the Actors' Studio.  His
touch at comedy is only marginally better.  Billy Crystal is again the
nice-guy, sincere, New York Jew he always plays, only this time he
plays it as a psychiatrist.  This would have been a far more engaging
film if on Day One DeNiro and Crystal would have just looked at each
other, said "not this role again," and then traded roles.  Lisa Kudrow
is capable or more but plays a bewildered third wheel in the grand
tradition of Terry Garr.  She should never have settled for such a
tangential role.  More interesting are the character roles of Joe
Viterelli as the bodyguard Jelly and Chazz Palminteri is his usual
riveting character.</P>
<P>     Many of the jokes really are funny, but again most are in the
first half of the film.  There are also some interesting allusions to
crime films, both in the dialog and visually.  But the script by Ken
Lonergan and Peter Tolan is not content to simply have many of the
allusions, it must tell the viewer about them so that they are not
missed.  It sacrifices subtlety.  Overall this averages out to being a
decent comedy, but it was capable of being much more.  I rate it a 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
