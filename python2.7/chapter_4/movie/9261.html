<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>With the 1996 Gramercy release of Jane Campion's THE PORTRAIT OF A
LADY, the upcoming Miramax release of Iain Softley's THE WINGS OF THE
DOVE, and this Buena Vista release of the Agneiszka Holland-helmed
WASHINGTON SQUARE, it is abundantly clear that film adaptations based
upon the works of Henry James are currently in fashion.  It is no
accident that both period melodramas WASHINGTON SQUARE and the
forthcoming THE WINGS OF THE DOVE are late-year releases, as was last
year's intricate THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY; they are strategically being
positioned in film release schedules in aspirations of possible Oscar
gold.  While the Oscar campaign for Ms. Campion's film fared somewhat
disappointingly, eventually netting only two Academy Award
nominations, WASHINGTON SQUARE, while generally a decent adaptation
of Henry James' novel, should consider itself lucky to do so well
come February 1998.</P>
<P>It will be inevitable that comparisons will abound between Ms.
Holland's version of WASHINGTON SQUARE and William Wylder's 1948
film, THE HEIRESS, featuring an illustrious cast including Ralph
Richardson, Montgomery Clift, and, in an Academy Award-winning role,
Olivia de Havilland, given that both films draw from the same source
material.  Such comparisons will invariably conclude in favour of the
much-revered earlier film, and while there may be merit in such a
conclusion, the mannered WASHINGTON SQUARE, which while more faithful
to James' original novel is also slightly instilled with a modern
feminist edge, remains fairly successfully moving and engaging.</P>
<P>Despite the film's one-sheet, which features Catherine Sloper
(Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her dashing suitor Morris Townsend (Ben
Chaplin) in a passionate if pensive embrace, WASHINGTON SQUARE's key
relationship is not that between the suitor and the painfully shy
heiress, but that between Catherine and her domineering father, Dr.
Austin Sloper (Albert Finney).  Skittishly devoted to her
contemptuous father to the point of tackling him at the front door
upon his daily return and waiting upon him hand and foot, Catherine
is an awkward young woman, sheltered and seemingly oblivious to the
standards of ladylike behaviour as deemed in the 1850s, yet she
appears content with her life in servitude to her beloved father.
The prosperous Dr. Sloper, on the other hand, looks upon his only
daughter with thinly-veiled disdain and embarrassment, resentful of
her mother's death during childbirth and brutally certain that the
eager-to-please Catherine is dim, charmless and has amounted to
nothing.  (His retort to a declaration that his daughter has a great
deal to offer is a genuine, incredulously bland "Such as?")</P>
<P>The status quo in their lives is irrevocably shattered upon the
arrival on the scene of Morris, a handsome young man who begins to
court Catherine, lavishing upon her great interest, attention, and
affection, much to the delight of Catherine's idealist Aunt Lavinia
(Maggie Smith) and to the suspicion of Dr. Sloper, who immediately
concludes that the penniless Morris is interested in her solely for
her inheritance.  While Catherine swoons for Morris, her relationship
with her father becomes increasingly strained, and she
heartbreakingly begins to understand for the first time how unworthy
she has always been in his eyes when Dr. Sloper vows to disinherit
her should she continue to encourage Morris' attentions.</P>
<P>It is not immediately intuitive casting to put Ms. Leigh in the role
of an unattractive spinster, and even moreso as a meek, clumsy
wallflower, but she fares suitably well, imbuing her piteous
character with a desperate craving for affection finally sated by her
romance with the Morris character.  It is in the latter half of
WASHINGTON SQUARE, where Catherine becomes more self-assured and
strong in her resolve, that Ms. Leigh predictably is strongest; her
vivid portrayal of a woman forever changed results in the film's
denouement being as affecting and emotionally resonant as it is.</P>
<P>However, it is Mr. Finney's performance which is the standout in
WASHINGTON SQUARE; his is an imposing and forceful presence in the
film which commands every scene in which he appears, and although his
character's cruel dismissals of his daughter are distasteful, it is
to Mr. Finney's credit that, far from coming off as despicable, there
remains a certain strength, authority, and deeply-buried sense of
genuine concern (if only, perhaps, in his own self-interest) in Dr.
Sloper which is oddly compelling.</P>
<P>The remaining supporting performances are solid.  Ms. Smith is very
amusing in a supporting role, while Mr. Chaplin nicely handles his
character's ambiguous motives with a great deal of subtlety.  While
the Morris character is a challenging role, Mr. Chaplin pulls it off
well, never tipping his hand too early and leaving the audience
hopeful, but uncertainly wavering about its true intentions.  With
his performance here and in Michael Lehmann's THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS &
DOGS, he has built up fine credentials for future thoughtful
Hollywood romantic leads.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON SQUARE's final third is markedly stronger and more
compelling than the previous two-thirds, which may be due to the
turgid manner in which Ms. Holland handles the romance storyline
which is prevalent throughout most of the film's second act.  While
done in a sincere fashion, there isn't a much-needed dizzying,
enthralling sense of passion evident which captures the essence of
Catherine's budding first romance and begins to transform her from a
gawky spinster into a poised, dainty beauty; Catherine and Morris'
affair seems far too polite and mannered.</P>
<P>Attempts to open up the story by screenwriter Carol Doyle are
ill-advised.  The additions of early scenes in Catherine's life fail
to add any added insight not already evident in the main body of the
story, although it does provide Ms. Holland with the opportunity to
open the film with an impressive POV tracking shot.  Sadly, the
costume design by Anna Sheppard, production direction by Allan
Starski, and WASHINGTON SQUARE's score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek are all
decent but undistinguished.</P>
<P>While Ms. Holland's adaptation of WASHINGTON SQUARE is not a complete
triumph, the intrinsic strength and power of James' story, as
filtered through Ms. Doyle's screenplay, remains intact, and the film
benefits from good performances from its principal cast.</P>
