<P>     I'm beginning to get fed up.  Over my four years as a critic, the thing
which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films.  The good balances
the bad.  I try to see both in equal proportions.  But Disney's Mighty Joe
Young remake marks the fourth week in which I haven't seen a truly terrible
movie.</P>
<P>    It's a backwards machismo, I suppose, the urge to see the things which
you so loathe; but I need to see a bad film every once in a while.  And, you
know what, Mighty Joe Young doesn't qualify.</P>
<P>     Far from being bad, Mighty Joe Young is actually a family fun movie.
It's enjoyable, appropriate, cute, cuddly, and all of those other things
that I've been seeing in every movie since A Bug's Life.</P>
<P>     Mighty Joe Young tracks a 2,000 pound gorilla in the wilds of Africa
that is taken to a reserve in ... California? ... for safe-keeping.  Okay.
A little unrealistic, but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the
slightest hint of realism.  The first half of the movie is a Gorillas in the
Mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif.  The second half is a
straight up parody of King Kong, awestruck onlookers and all.</P>
<P>     Mark one down.  I'm feeling relaxed.  It is, as a point of fact, an
extremely un-creative movie.  But, as a vetern, I can say quite honestly
that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should.  So that saves
Mighty Joe from my wrath, although my colleagues and cohorts and surely
bashing this film at this very moment.</P>
<P>     This is not the film to take a girl on a date to.  It's not the film
for you.  It's the film for you and your family.  When you're right
alongside your kid, all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away.  The same
thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick.  It becomes
fun.  All you have to do to enjoy Mighty Joe Young is shut up and watch.</P>
