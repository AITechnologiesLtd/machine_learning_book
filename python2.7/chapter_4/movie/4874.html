<P>     THE STARS FELL ON HENRIETTA is another example of the time-honored 
story of the loser making good.  However, although the plot follows a 
clear formula, this production has been crafted with such care and 
intelligence that it transcends the predictable plot.  THE STARS FELL ON 
HENRIETTA isn't among the year's best films, but it's the kind of small, 
satisfying motion picture that offers two hours of enjoyment whether 
watched in a theater or on video (where it's more likely to surface, 
given its limited distribution).</P>
<P>     Acting is one of the keys to HENRIETTA's success.  Robert Duvall, 
who can give a heartfelt performance with the best, is delightful as Mr. 
Cox, an oil wildcatter and perennial loser roaming through Texas in the 
early 1930s.  Equally impressive is Aidan Quinn, one of the most 
underrated actors of his generation.  Quinn generally doesn't take 
flashy parts; hence, he often doesn't receive his deserved share of 
attention.  Here, as Don Day, a down-on-his-luck farmer with a family to 
provide for, Quinn again takes a low key part.  The supporting cast 
includes Frances Fisher as Don's wife, Lexi Randall as his eldest 
daughter, Beatrice, and the always-delightful Brian Dennehy as Big Dave, 
the "richest man in Texas."</P>
<P>     THE STARS FELL ON HENRIETTA opens with Mr. Cox, accompanied by his 
constant companion, Mathilda the cat, driving into town in a vintage 
1930s automobile.  Actually, since the car breaks down before he gets 
there, he ends up hitching a ride.  Cox, as always, is looking for oil.  
He doesn't have a penny to his name, and he's never had a successful 
strike before, but that doesn't quell his enthusiasm, and when he thinks 
he locates  a huge, untapped reservoir of liquid black gold in a place 
called Henrietta, he starts looking for investors.  Cox agrees to go 
fifty/fifty with Don Day, the owner of the property where the 
prospective well is to be drilled, but since Don isn't rich, Cox has to 
raise $5000 on his own.  The only problem is, every man of means knows 
his fruitless track record, and isn't interested in contributing to his 
latest scheme.  Yet, even as Cox plots to obtain the money, Don scrapes 
together everything he has and sinks it into the venture, with tragic 
consequences for himself and his family. </P>
<P>     Don and Cox are both dreamers, and this quality binds them together 
in the end.  Because they're such likable, well-developed characters, we 
root unashamedly for them.  THE STARS FELL ON HENRIETTA doesn't race 
towards the inevitable; it ambles.  And it's the easy, unhurried gait 
that makes this film worthwhile, since it gives us an opportunity to get 
to know the two protagonists.  This film isn't about men getting rich 
from an oil strike; it's about visionaries who, in Cox's words, hitch 
their wagons to a star.  Cox loves life and the freedom of the road.  
Whether he makes or loses money is largely irrelevant.  </P>
<P>     This film oozes atmosphere.  Director James Keach and 
cinematographer Bruce Surtees have worked meticulously to recapture the 
essence of an America that, although only sixty years in the past, is no 
more.  As presented in HENRIETTA, the life of a farmer may have been 
simple, but it was also risky.  If the crops didn't grow, the bank could 
repossess the land, and a whole family would be without a home.  
Although this film contains certain nostalgic elements, it's doesn't 
bask in an unfailingly warm glow. Racism, poverty, and their attendant 
hardships are very much in evidence.</P>
<P>     THE STARS FELL ON HENRIETTA functions best as a character piece, 
since the basic storyline is straightforward.  There are some problems 
with the conclusion, which ties up loose ends a little too neatly and 
conveniently.  Nevertheless, with excellent performances from Duvall and 
Quinn, and sure directing by Keach, this film offers a pleasantly 
engrossing and satisfying drama with underdog protagonists whose efforts 
everyone can applaud.</P>
