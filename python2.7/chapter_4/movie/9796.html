A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Mike Figgis</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Mike Figgis</PRE>
<P>Starring: Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Robert Downey Jr., Ming-Na
Wen, and Kyle MacLachlan</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Romance, jazzy music</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
Max (Wesley Snipes) is a director of commercials who has a wife, two
kids, a dog, and house in sunny California. Unfortunately, Max is
unhappily married. In the beginning of the movie Max is alone in New
York to visit his best friend Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.) who has just
been diagnosed with AIDS.  By chance Max meets a lady scientist named
Karen (Nastassja Kinski ) who is attending a convention in New York.
Soon romantic sparks fly, and the two have a one night stand. Max flies
back home to California and has guilty feelings for a long time. Two
years later, Max and his wife Mimi (Ming-Na Wen) are in New York to
visit Charlie who now lays dying in the hospital. Max is shocked to see
Karen at the hospital; apparently Charlie's brother's wife is none other
than Karen. Not only that, but the passion between Max and Karen is
alive and well. What will the two of them do about it?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Mike Figgis apparently had a big hand in this movie since, he was
director, writer, and the guy who composed the jazzy musical score. Did
he do a good job? Hmm. Interesting cinematography. Often the camera
moves between scenes by fading in and out of black or ending in a color
freeze-frame that becomes a black and white snapshot. The acting is
pretty solid, especially by Robert Downey Jr. as the AIDS victim. The
chemistry between Wesley Snipes and Nastassja Kinski is moderate, rather
than hot. Similar to ‘When Harry Met Sally' but perhaps not as cohesive,
‘One Night Stand' is one of those ‘life' movies where boy meets girl
while jazzy vocals and music play in the background. People who liked
‘When Harry Met Sally' would probably learn towards this movie.</P>
