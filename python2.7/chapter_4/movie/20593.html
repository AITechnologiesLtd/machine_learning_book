<PRE>                              HAPPY, TEXAS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Since few people saw DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, HAPPY, TEXAS will likely
not be remembered as the second beauty pageant comedy of 1999.</P>
<P>     The lighthearted story of two convicted felons who break out of
jail and find themselves impersonating a pair of gay pageant producers
in the sleepy town of Happy, Texas, this film has a lot riding on what
amounts to a one-joke concept.</P>
<P>     And boy, how they work that joke!  Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Zahn) and
Harry Sawyer (Northam) are complete opposites.  They both find love
interests in the town, but everyone thinks they're gay!  Even the
sheriff (Macy) thinks so, if you catch my drift.  And they don't know
anything about beauty pageants!  Oh, the comic possibilities!</P>
<P>     And for the most part, those possibilities are wasted.  Whereas a
film like WAITING FOR GUFFMAN took a more savvy approach to basically
the same movie, HAPPY wastes its energy on one increasingly lame gay
joke after another.  Add to that the fact that Walker and Douglas (born:
Massachusetts) just don't fit as Texas belles, and HAPPY is a bit of a
mess.  Sure, it's cute and funny at times (thank the hilarious Zahn for
that), but overall, HAPPY is flat.</P>
