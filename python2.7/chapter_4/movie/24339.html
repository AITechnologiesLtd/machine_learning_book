<P>Frequency, the first film penned by Toby Emmerich (Noah's brother), is so
beautifully crafted and stunningly patriotic that it moves through its
almost two hours without a moment of boredom. This, despite an
oftentimes-painful lack of intellectual breadth and plot holes that only
serve to detract from a film that could have easily been on par with
classics like Field of Dreams.</P>
<P>The movie requires audiences to suspend belief and accept a rather
far-fetched plot that is actually refreshingly innocent and magical, not
unlike Cinderella's midnight curfew: because of a special alignment in the
evening sky, one that hasn't been seen so brightly for 30 years, John
Sullivan (a mediocre Jim Caviezel) is able to speak with his father, Frank
(an excellent Dennis Quaid), – who has been dead for those 30 years.</P>
<P>As the duo chat away under the stars every evening, they begin to change the
history of the three decades that separate them - this is interesting.
Unfortunately, as the two try to change some untoward events (namely Frank's
untimely death and his wife's murder), it seems that no one is effected
other than the characters immediately pertaining to the story. Essentially,
the movie tries to isolate chaos theory according to what is convenient to
explain and disregard what would be too much of a hassle to further develop.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the film makes you ponder what it would be like to be in
Frank's shoes. Similar to one of the punishments a death row inmate faces,
Frank now knows how and approximately when he will die and, additionally, is
deprived of the privilege of seeing his son grow up and wondering what he
will do with his life. Unfortunately, Frequency does little to address these
questions and leaves them to the audience as more of an afterthought than
significant query. It would be well worth the extra time, even if the film
surpassed two and a half hours, for these questions to be dealt with on
screen rather than have the two main characters so easily accept the
nighttime magic and all of its side effects.</P>
<P>All the main characters in Frequency are either police officers, firemen or
nurses. With the exception of the aforementioned serial killer, who brings
contrast to the production, everyone is the ultimate red-blooded American.
Baseball, the American pastime, is a favorite topic of conversation, a cold
beer the preferred drink and New York City the place to be. Similarly,
Frequency is the typical, feel-good American movie. Sure, there are a few
plot holes and some things could be slightly better thought out, but family
values have rarely seen a heavier emphasis then they get here and that is
just about as American as one can get.</P>
