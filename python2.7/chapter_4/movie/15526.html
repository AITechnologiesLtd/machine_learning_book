<P>The first film directed by Laurence Olivier, at age 36,  was HENRY V
(1944). It was and still is a triumph, a yardstick of cinematic excellence.
The first film directed by Kenneth Branagh, at age 28, has five hard
Shakesperean acts to follow.</P>
<P>In both movies the directors  played the title role. Both films are of the
same length. Comparisons are unfair because Branagh did not set out to
remake Olivier but to present us with something entirely different.
Comparisons, nonetheless, are inevitable.</P>
<P>Olivier's HENRY, made (incredibly) in wartime, was a paean to English
fortitude, a  proud, rousing booster of the spirits of the embattled
British. It was also a poetic, stylized work with  many sunny images right
out of The Book of Hours of the Duke of Berry.</P>
<P>Branagh's version has a somewhat revisionist and naturalistic approach , a
much darker view --psychologically and visually. It is the product of a
modern anti-war sensibility, though not entirely so, since the negative
view of fighting is at the same time a celebration.</P>
<P>Olivier looked and sounded  patrician, and moved with supple grace. Branagh
has a proletarian's stockiness and a glamorless potato face. There are
moments when you may think you are watching a British pop musician who is
also a great actor.</P>
<P>Branagh and most of his companions  --a Who's Who of British
talent--deliver splendidly intense performances. So intense that
Shakespeare's scene-closing couplets become here thunderous conclusions, as
opposed to Olivier's gentler introductions.</P>
<P>The difficulty for Branagh must have been that he wanted both to impose his
vision and avoid any duplication of Olivier, even if he found in Olivier
elements that coincided with his own.</P>
<P>Both men made cuts in the text. Chorus, in Olivier's prologue, stuck to
Shakespeare, with imaginative staging. Branagh's trick is to set his Chorus
(Derek Jacobi) in an empty sound-stage. He fiddles with the lines and
Jacobi's commentator throughout the play has tones of Brechtian
distanciation. But then, to give cinematic specificity to his work, Branagh
goes all out for close-ups of faces, unrelenting, pervasive, sometimes
suffocating shots where the large screen is filled with visages, often from
hairline to chin cleft.  The huge heads interfere with the language and
oddly reduce the distanciation effect.</P>
<P>Branagh's intention was to show a young monarch burdened with the guilt of
his crown-seizing father, establishing closer relations with his people and
maturing to grand leadership. This aim is reached and Henry's progress is
clear.</P>
<P>But audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeare will not quite grasp the
significance of Henry's lineage or  Prince Hal's abandonment of Falstaff,
shown  in a flashback from HENRY IV. Paradoxically though, this is the
point where the film hits its first private, emotional peak.</P>
<P>Olivier, in the trying times of World War II England, eliminated most
references to the islanders as vengeful patriots. Branagh retains many, and
, in the modern, respect-your-enemy way, transforms Olivier's foppy French
into worthy adversaries, especially the Dauphin who underestimates England
("She is so idly kinged" ) and  Paul Scofield's mesmerizing, thoughtful,
sad King Charles. Scofield transforms prose into poetry, as does the
Hostess (Judi Dench) in her gut-wrenching account of Falstaff's death, as
does much of the cast.</P>
<P>The major  exception is in the "funny" or romantic scenes of French
princess Katharine learning  English and, at play's end, being courted by a
"Kiss Me Kate " Henry. Emma Thompson (Branagh's wife at the time) speaks
atrocious French .</P>
<P>Henry's nocturnal peregrinations in his camp, and the famous speeches like
the St. Crispin exhortation are state- of- the- art. But the battle of
Agincourt  is muddled, small-scale (for budgetary reasons), does not
explain the role of the English spikes and long bows with which  the
immensely outnumbered English  defeated the French horsemen who wore
cumbersome suits of armor.</P>
<P>The battle though a fairly somber sight, does not go far enough in its
blood and guts. This and the slow-motion photography cry out for a Sam
Peckinpah.</P>
<P>Even so, the Bard's sublime language is beautifully served throughout, the
players are humanized as much as possible, the first-time direction is
impressive.Notwithstanding some objections, this HENRY V is a top-notch
film.</P>
