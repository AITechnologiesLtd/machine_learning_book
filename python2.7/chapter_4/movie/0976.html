                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
The story of a dog, a bull terrier, who goes through a succession of
owners in search of an authoritarian master.  A black comedy/satire that
explores the strange things that people do.  The film is
thought-provoking, but not very entertaining.</P>
<P>France (English subtitles), color, 1991, 82 minutes.
Director:  Jerome Boivin</P>
<P>     The screenplay for this film was written by the Director and
Jacques Audiard, and is based on the novel "Hell Hound", by Ken
Greenhall.  (I haven't read the book, so cannot comment on how the film
relates to the book).  The film is the story of Baxter, a dog, a bull
terrier.  Perhaps I should identify the bull terrier breed; the dog in
the beer ads, "Spuds McKenzie, Party Animal", is a bull terrier.</P>
<P>     The story is told from Baxter's viewpoint, with extra scenes added
that Baxter does not appear in, to complete the story.  Some scenes are
shot from Baxter's point of view, i.e., close to the ground.  The story
is narrated by Baxter, who relates his thoughts and plans.</P>
<P>     The story begins as Baxter is taken from a breeding kennel and
given to an old woman.  Baxter quickly tires of living with the old
woman, because he wants discipline; he wants to obey, and the old woman
will not discipline him.  Baxter looks across the street at the young
couple moving in; their liveliness and strong smells excite him.</P>
<P>     The old woman suffers from two mysterious accidents (were they
arranged by Baxter?), and Baxter is given to the young couple.  That
arrangement does not last, and Baxter is given to a new, perhaps ideal
owner: a young teenage boy with a Nazi fetish!  The story continues as
Baxter is disciplined by his new owner, who constructs a replica of
Hitler's bunker in the junkyard that he plays in.</P>
<P>     The film has some black comedy in it, and at times becomes a sharp
satire on human relations and customs.  Unfortunately, the film is not
very entertaining; there is not much humor.  Indeed, one local newspaper
mini-review described it as a horror film (in some ways it is).</P>
<P>     However, the film gives a rich insight into the personality of
Baxter, and the craziness of humanity.  There are layers of social
commentary present, in allegorical form, to analyze.  Inasmuch as Baxter
is searching for someone to obey, his relationship with people can be
seen as an allegory of the "fatal attraction" humanity has with
totalitarianism.  An alternate view is that Baxter, with his strong need
to be controlled, is the "ideal citizen" for whom social and political
activists are only too happy to provide control.</P>
<P>     Because the film is not very entertaining, I would not suggest it
to a general audience.  If you want a film to analyze for its layers of
social comment, it is worth considering.</P>
<P>Distribution. Now in its first U.S. theatrical run. Playing in the San
Francisco area; should be available in other areas also.</P>
