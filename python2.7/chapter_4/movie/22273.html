<PRE>ANY GIVEN SUNDAY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Absolutely infuriating.  In ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, Oliver Stone assembles a
large, stellar cast and then undermines their performances with his
directorial grandstanding.  The camera is brought in so tight that we
usually have little clue as to what is happening.  Stone uses hyper-fast
pans and microsecond editing to dazzle us with his artistic skills, all
to the detriment of his own story.  On the field and off, the movie is
an uninviting mess.</P>
<P>Telling a tale of exploited millionaire football players, the movie
doesn't have many subtle moments.  In a typically didactic scene, the
high octane, but perhaps over-the-hill, coach, played with an endearing
gusto by Al Pacino, is serving dinner to his black, starting
quarterback, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx).  The coach just happens to have
the gladiator chariot racing episode from BEN HUR playing on his large
screen television.</P>
<P>Willie complains that 75% of professional football players are black,
but none of the owners are.  "In the pros the field hands are paid,"
Willie says to liken his labors with those of farm workers.  In order to
reinforce this notion of exploited (millionaire) athletes, Stone keeps
cutting back to BEN HUR's galley slaves rowing the boat as they are
whipped into submission.</P>
<P>The extremely simple story has two other subplots.  One involves a
ruthless team doctor, played in his usual flamboyant and volatile style
by James Woods, who is willing to send men to their deaths if it gets
him a bonus, and another, Matthew Modine, who is purer of heart and
won't play along.</P>
<P>In a miscast role, a glamorous Cameron Diaz plays the team's owner, who
likes to scream at the coach and try to order him around.  The owner
doesn't care anything about the game.  For her its all about power and
money.  In the movie's most unbelievable sequence, she goes into the
dressing room to talk to her naked football players, who just let their
private parts hang down in front of her with no attempt at modesty.</P>
<P>The unoriginal and predictable script by John Logan and Oliver Stone,
based on Rob Huizenga's novel, concerns a team that used to be great and
that now is trying to fight their way into the playoffs.  After hundreds
of blocks and tackles, choreographed to loud explosions, the movie
finally comes to the ending at -- surprise! -- the big game.  Think it
will go down to the final seconds before the victor is decided?  Think
they'll win?</P>
<P>The movie contains a single small twist, but you have to wait for the
closing credits to see it, so if you haven't walked out from disgust or
boredom before then, do stay through the credits.</P>
<P>The big surprise is why this skeletal story takes almost 2 and 3/4 hours
to tell.  If ever a film should have been brought in at an hour and a
half, it is this one.</P>
<P>ANY GIVEN SUNDAY runs 2:40.  It is rated R for drug usage, nudity, sex,
football violence and language and would be acceptable for older
teenagers.</P>
