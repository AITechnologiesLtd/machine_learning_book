<P>_Eyes_Wide_Shut_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The late Stanley Kubrick's long-awaited final film, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_, is
the perfect example of a true NC-17 film--but not in the way one would be
led to believe.  Ever since production began on the film way back in the
fall of 1996, rumors have been swirling about the sexual content of the
film: "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman bare all and really do the nasty";
"Tom wears a dress"; "Tom lusts after teenage Leelee Sobieski"--if the
reports were to be believed, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ would turn out to be a
high-budget, A-list porn film.  Fanning the flames of speculation was the
now-familiar scene of a nude Cruise and Kidman making love in front of a
mirror, the first taste of the film made available to the public.</P>
<P>Having seen the actual film, I advise anyone ready to don their
raincoats for a showing of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ to think twice.  Yes, there
is some strong sexual content (some of which was altered to receive an R
rating, but more on that later), but not the wall-to-wall fornication as
had been whispered.  Rather than _being_ sex, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ is _about_
sex--a film that explores this adult theme in a sensitive, mature, and
thoughtful manner.  If that isn't a film that could not better exemplify
a rating that simply means, in its literal definition, "No one 17 and
under admitted," then I don't know what is.</P>
<P>Kubrick isn't above a little playful teasing, and that's what he does
for the opening section of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_, which appears to suggest all
manner of ensuing tawdriness.  The opening shot is of Kidman's character,
former art gallery manager (_not_ psychiatrist nor medical doctor) Alice
Harford, doffing her duds and baring nearly all.  Once fully dressed, she
and her husband, Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) make their way to a swank
party thrown by wealthy friend Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack, in a role
once meant for Harvey Keitel).  At the soirée, a tipsy Alice engages in a
dangerous flirtation with an anonymous partygoer while eyeing her husband
getting friendly with a pair of seductive models.</P>
<P>Not too long after that, a fully nude female form appears onscreen, but
not in the way one would expect.  Similarly unexpected is the turn that
soon comes in one astonishing Cruise-Kidman bedroom scene, which reveals
itself to be the film's driving dramatic force.  While this scene is all
about sex, it is not _of_ sex; in fact, it is of words describing sex,
and in decidedly inexplicit terms.  What lends this scene such power,
however, is the hypnotic effect that comes when all facets of cinema are
triumphantly married: photography, editing, writing, and especially
directing and acting.  A description of what the scene literally entails
would sound deceptively simple and thus completely fail to do it justice.
 Directed with remarkable precision and control by Kubrick and quite
simply the most triumphant moment in Kidman's entire acting career, this
scene is the first of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_'s fair share of haunting moments.</P>
<P>This charged encounter sends Bill off into the streets and the film into
its main (for lack of a better term) action, where in one, long night, he
is simultaneously repulsed and enticed by various sex-related situations
he happens to stumble upon.  The decadent centerpiece of his journey (and
of the film itself) is a now-notorious orgy sequence, made even more
controversial by the addition of some obvious digital effects work used
to obscure some sex acts--and hence secure an R rating.  From what I
understand, no genitalia nor glimpses of penetration could be seen in
Kubrick's unobstructed view, which is just as well--the point of the
scene is not to titillate but to create an unsettling atmosphere where
desire and carnal curiosity becomes tinged with danger and outright fear.
(The atmosphere is stunningly bolstered by Jocelyn Pook's chilling
minimalist score.)  The point still comes across in the censored version,
but undoubtedly diluted, for the unconvincing CGI work just serves to
distract more than anything else.</P>
<P>This bit of censorship (which Warner Bros. insists was approved by
Kubrick before his sudden death in March) also shows just how
out-of-touch the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board
is.  It fails to realize that it's not the presence of sex that matters
but its context and intended effect.  For all the scandalous associations
that come with an orgy, there is nothing exploitative about the sequence;
it is far more disturbing than it is the slightest bit arousing (which it
isn't), and the sex is a means to a cinematic end and not the end itself.</P>
<P>Kubrick, his co-scripter Frederic Raphael (working from the
"inspiration" of Arthur Schnitzler's novel _Traumnovelle_), Cruise, and
Kidman's end is to create a probing and painfully real examination of a
marriage, relationships in general, and basic human desire and nature. 
Clocking in at well north of the two-and-a-half-hour mark, there is bound
to be a slow stretch here and there, and one late plot revelation is a
bit too easily predictable; but overall, there is nary a false note in
the execution.  Though receiving equal star billing and delivering an
outstanding and  revealing (in every way) performance, Kidman's presence
definitely takes a backseat to that of her on- and off-screen husband,
who dominates the screen time.  Cruise's innate likability and
average-guy appeal makes him the ideal audience surrogate for this foray
into the sexual underground; one can completely relate to his fascination
and fear of all that he witnesses.  The secondary roles are also
well-cast, from Pollack (who, in the end, is probably a more effective
choice for his role than Keitel could have been) and Sobieski (as a
fetching nymphet) to a hilarious Alan Cumming as a hotel desk clerk who
makes no secret of his interest in Bill.  The one strained performance
comes from Marie Richardson, who bears a passing resemblance to her
role's original portrayer, Jennifer Jason Leigh (who was replaced when
she was unavailable for reshoots); though stiff and awkward in her single
scene with Cruise, her work is far from ruinous to the film.</P>
<P>It would take something much larger than that to detract from the vision
of Kubrick, to whose control the audience completely surrenders.  The
common reaction once the end credits began to run was a simple "hmm," and
while it doesn't sound that way, that is a good thing.  _Eyes_Wide_Shut_
is thought-provoking, but the film's spell goes beyond that; it makes you
_want_ to think about it afterward.  That feeling even permeated this
week's gala premiere of the film; in post-screening interviews, many of
the celebrities in attendence expressed their need to think about what
they had just seen.</P>
<P>That, right there, makes me somewhat grudgingly grateful that the film
didn't end up hitting screens with the dreaded NC-17 rating. 
_Eyes_Wide_Shut_ is a rich, challenging work, and as such, it is certain
to fly clear over the heads of a baffled American moviegoing public;
consequently, the film is all but certain to die a quick--and
much-talked-about--box office death.  And in this entertainment/political
climate of scapegoating, had the film been released with an NC-17,
fingers would have been pointed at the rating, rendering it even more
useless than it already is.  If one of the biggest, if not the biggest,
movie star in the world is unable to make an NC-17 film commercially
viable (regardless of its subject matter, challenging or otherwise), then
no one would ever want to touch the NC-17 ever again.  There is no
excusing Warner Bros.'s tampering with Kubrick's work, but at least it
leaves the door open for another name star, another high-profile
director, and a major studio bold enough to take risks meant to be seen
exclusively by an adult audience.  However, the sad case remains that it
is sure to be a very long while before anyone dares to think of entering
that doorway again.</P>
