<P>This is not a bad film.  It's just that it isn't that good either.  But, one
great actor, does make it a little interesting. It's not always boring.  And
I suppose that the story is a bit to blame.</P>
<P>An elder man, whose life is as mysterious as his stories comes and goes.
And he makes the acquaintance, of a lady who has a midget for a daughter.
It is never explained, but the daughter may have been born out of wedlock,
and during a time when the lady had an  affair during a circus visit.</P>
<P>And as D'andrea gets closer to the family, his feelings are turned into the
young lady, who is not specially attractive, but is charming and nice.  In a
social sort of way, she is never going to be appreciated even if her talents
are above normal.  She has become a rather nice pianist, for example.   But
all of this is a reflection of the mother's point of view, and her desire to
make the daughter fit in at any price, without her daughter's own needs and
desires.</P>
<P>D'andrea, is a ladies man, called a "perfect lover" by a woman in a watering
hole, and their loss of this man doesn't go by un-noticed.  They lose a
great lover.  He loses some fun, or so it seems.  But the elder D'andrea,
finally gets his chance, and marries the young lady. And by all accounts,
Charlotte is doing very well in the upper class structure that she lives
with D'andrea.  And one day, a circus comes to town, and the
worried mother tries hard to make sure that her daughter does not get to see
it.</P>
<P>And the film basically ends.  The daughter finds her milieu, and disappears
with the troupe.  D'andrea, is apparently left behind, or just like his
stories, nothing is explained, just gossiped about.  And the film throws the
story away, just like a circus throws life away for an evening.</P>
<P>The film is nice. The women are the attraction through out the whole story,
and when they finally do not become the attraction, it seems that the film
loses its guard.  Charlotte has won out the attention  of the story, and our
attraction span has changed.  We have to decide between the women, or a
life.  And D'andrea chooses for a life and living, which the women like, of
course, but can not sustain day and night, or he would have been married to
one of them.</P>
<P>Not a great film, it is a rather odd one, actually.  Marcello Mastroianni is
very good, and some of the actors are nice, amidst a bunch of card board
women parading around.  At times, one feels we are watching a bad soap
opera.  But the film is better than that.</P>
