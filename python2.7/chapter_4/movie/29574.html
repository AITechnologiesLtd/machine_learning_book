<PRE>THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
September 23rd, 2001</PRE>
<P>There is no way to explain my constant fascination with Woody Allen. He is one
of the few comedy geniuses of the 20th century. From masterful comedy-dramas
like "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan" to somber, Bergmanesque dramas like
"Interiors" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors" to self-portraits that are as acrid
and alive as any of his early works like "Husbands and Wives" and
"Deconstructing Harry," Woody has maintained a body of work that reflects his
philosophy and psychology of general relationships on Manhattan's Lower East
Side. And he can be hard on himself when he deconstructs his own life, but
always with an edge and a distance that may not always appeal to everyone who is
not from New York. I would never confuse Woody for a mainstream comedy director
in this jaded day and age. That is why it is a pleasure to report that "The
Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a delightful souffle, spiked and stinging with
wit from all corners of the screen. It is as smarmily funny as "Small Time
Crooks" and "Manhattan Murder Mys
tery" and as affectionate and buyoant as "Bullets Over Broadway" and "Zelig."
"Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is set in Manhattan in 1940 where C.W. Briggs
(Woody Allen) is a fraud insurance detective who cracks nearly every case with
sheer luck and ingenious instinct. He is admired by his co-workers, which
includes Dan Aykroyd as his professional boss Magruder and Jill (Elizabeth
Berkley), a secretary who will let someone rub her chest as long as they bring a
ring. The one exception to this staff is Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) who
is hired by the company to make it more efficient and workmanlike (she also
considers condensing the private detective agency). She hates C.W. and sees him
as vermin and as a dinosaur (there are probably as many synonyms used to
describe Woody negatively in this film than in any other). C.W. hates her too
and you can see it will probably lead to a romance at some point. One night at a
birthday party, C.W. and Betty Ann are asked to participate in a magic act by
the great Voltan (David Ogden Stiers). They are put in a trance where the names
like "Madagasc
ar" and "Constantinople" are uttered and where they are apparently lovers. Once
snapped out of the trance, C.W. continues to hate Betty Ann. However, precious
jewels begin to disappear from wealthy estates and C.W. might be a prime suspect
thanks to the trance-like powers of the great Voltan. </P>
<P>"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" reminds me of the great 40's romantic comedies
where a bickering couple would trade insults and engaging repartee with ease
("His Girl Friday" is my favorite of that period). Woody Allen and Helen Hunt
are a match made in heaven and show love and hate for each other with aplomb.
Their chemistry works well - Hunt is all professionalism and Allen simply cracks
wise. What is ultimately satisfying and unusual is to see Allen in a role that
would have been suited for someone like Cary Grant or James Stewart. Seeing
Allen as a short man with a milder neurosis than usual  is simply startling and
hilarious - consider the opening sequence where he arrives at his office in a
trenchcoat and felt hat as if he were Humphrey Bogart. Similarly, Hunt cleverly
assumes the role of a 40's working woman with authority and great energy - I am
not crazy about Hunt overall but in the right role, this actress sizzles and
holds her own with Allen. </P>
<P>"Jade Scorpion" has the customary Allen quips but it also has an informal,
chaste, elegant atmosphere. A romantic comedy like this in the 1940's would have
been rapid fire in pace and language. Here, Allen chooses to slow it down
somewhat, as if inviting us for a cup of tea rather than coffee. To some, this
may be offputting but I was positively entranced. The irradiating glow from the
cinematography by Zhao Fei enhances the elegance and brings a nostalgic tone to
the proceedings. </P>
<P>As always, Allen knows how to choose the right actors. Can you recall Sean Penn
being as faultless and knowing as in "Sweet and Lowdown"? Can you recall Winona
Ryder ever being as bewitching as in "Celebrity"? Well, "Jade Scorpion" has
Helen Hunt at her best as aforementioned. There is also Dan Aykroyd as a
businesslike romantic interest (I never thought Aykroyd would share a kissing
scene with Helen Hunt) with choice lines - he delivers a performance every bit
as nuanced as anything he has ever done. Elizabeth Berkley is actually tolerable
on screen, shedding any leftover negative vibes from "Showgirls." David Ogden
Stiers, an Allen regular, vibrates with stinging ardor. Everyone is perfectly
cast and seems to occupy a time in history credibly, unlike say "Pearl Harbor."</P>
<P>"Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a hoot and a half and tightly written and
directed. They say Woody Allen is not worth caring about anymore, and that he is
way past the comic highlights of his career. Some may say he is simply marking
time, making one film a year to keep himself busy. He may not create a
masterpiece like "Crimes and Misdemeanors" or "Annie Hall" but who cares. He
still makes films and let us be glad his wit lives on. The real curse would be
to avoid him. </P>
