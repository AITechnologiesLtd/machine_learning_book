<PRE>A REVIEW OF "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1975

<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>(NOTE-This is the 3rd of 5 retro reviews honouring great Jack
Nicholson films I plan to do in the next few weeks. "Chinatown" &
"A Few Good Men" are already posted on the Internet.)</P>
<P>What is crazy? "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" made a bold
statement addressing insanity. It took a little over two hours to
introduce its characters, set up a plot, and then let these great
actors work with a top-notch screenplay. After their job was done
and this film broke into theatres, we knew more about mental
hospitals, so-called "crazy" people, and how one man can change
the lives of others around him than we had known before. Watching
this great film nearly 30 years later reveals much, much more
than just Jack Nicholson playing a volatile free-spirit and
collecting an Oscar for it. There are more underlying themes and
ideas in this film than you can shake a big stick at. I'll get to
all those fascinating subtexts in a moment, but first, a little
about the story, if you please...</P>
<P>It's 1963 (according to a radio broadcast of the World Series)
and R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been relocated from the
local penitentiary to the state mental hospital. He's a known
malcontent serving out a jail sentence for statuatory rape of a
minor. Sent to the hospital for evaluation, the prison
authorities think that McMurphy has been faking insanity to get
out of work. He has an immediate impact on his fellow patients by
taking their money in numerous bets and disrupting regular ward
behaviour. McMurphy deliberately tries to anger Nurse Ratched
(Louise Fletcher) and even wagers with the other patients that he
can, essentially, make HER crazy. The icy-cold nurse doesn't
crack, but proves that her single goal in the hospital is to make
her patients crack. McMurphy brings out the rebelliousness in
everyone--little knowing most of them have nothing to lose
because they're voluntary patients--and pushes Nurse Ratched to
take drastic measures to bring him in line.</P>
<P>"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" has a limited musical score.
The music in this film nicely complements the story, yet never
interferes with the steady stream of superb dialogue. This is not
a big technical film, but Forman used sound and lighting well
considering that he had a confined area and so many actors to
photograph on film. This picture didn't win any technical awards,
but no one was crying about that on Oscar Night. It was the
second of three movies--"It Happened One Night" and "The Silence
Of The Lambs" are the others--to win the Top 5 Academy Awards for
Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best
(Adapted) Screenplay.</P>
<P>Nicholson and Fletcher won Best Actor and Best Actress Oscars for
their fine work, but the supporting cast was equally good.
William Redfield plays Dale Harding, an intelligent man who
cannot handle his wife's beauty and suspects that she's cheating
on him. Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif in an Oscar-nominated
performance) is a young man with a tremendous lack of confidence
and a terrible stutter brought on by his mother's
overprotectiveness. Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) is thought to be
a deaf and dumb Indian until we learn that he has his own demons
which only McMurphy's influence can help him overcome.
Christopher Lloyd--in his underrated film debut--plays Taber, one
of the few committed patients on the ward and the one guy who
knows that everyone is full of it (I had to edit that last word
by six letters!). Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, and Vincent
Schiavelli are also solid. Milos Forman's Oscar-winning direction
is excellent and the adaptation of Ken Kesey's fine novel by Bo
Goldman and Lawrence Hauben also won a well-deserved trophy.</P>
<P>So, having laid out the groundwork, it's now time to analyze this
film to death. The obvious place to begin is with the "crazy"
factor. McMurphy says, "I must be crazy to be in a looney-bin
like this". Of course, the thrust of the film is that McMurphy is
the only one who ISN'T insane because he understands that he's
screwed up, but no more than the average person on the street. He
just wants to be free and tries to show the other men that they
have a right to be free too. Only the committed patients--Chief
and Taber--can truly understand why McMurphy wants to be free.
They don't want to be there, but aren't permitted to leave. They
can't sympathize with men who are too weak to face the outside
world when it's only a few steps away. So, watch the last scene
carefully and see which characters are highlighted--Chief and
Taber.</P>
<P>Of course, the voluntary patients aren't going anywhere because
of the presence of one of the very best screen villains
ever--Nurse Ratched. She destroys men rather than building them
up or trying to cure them. Her means of therapy is to humiliate
and expose weakness, then coldly and calmly break a man's spirit.
She's the proof that if you don't play the "game", then the
system will run right over you. Nurse Ratched has men in her iron
grasp and does whatever she has to do to keep them there. Even
the doctors take her advice--or is it that they obey her
commands?--against their own judgment. If it's threatening Billy
with the wrath of his mother or treating Cheswick (Sydney
Lassick) like a child, Nurse Ratched works on them until they
become her little puppies. No treatment--from shock therapy to
lobotomy--is too rash, no tactic is unfair. She's hateful. Her
hair looks like horns, implying that she's a devil twisting these
poor men into obedient servants of her rules.</P>
<P>This film was politically correct before that annoying phrase was
cool. Perhaps its "PC"ness was unintentional, but think about it.
There are representations from the black community (the
attendants) from the Asian community (one of the doctors) from
the Native American community (Will Sampson as Chief) and even
from the short community (Danny DeVito). The one representation
that comes across in a negative light is women. Either they're
domineering witches in white outfits (the nurses) or they're
bimbos (McMurphy's not-so-virtuous lady friends). But then again,
this film is told from the overpowered man's point of view. While
the women are shown as either sex objects or tyrants, it's a
necessarily harsh depiction to make the story work.</P>
<P>Speaking of sex objects, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is
chock-full of sexual overtones, homoeroticism, rape themes, and
double entendres. Harding has sexual issues with his wife while
patients Sefelt & Fredrickson have a subtle "relationship". There
are even smoldering sexual overtones between McMurphy and Nurse
Ratched. It's like the bitter rivals are playing a game to see
who can make the other one blink. However, the hinting of sex in
THEIR relationship is violent. When he attacks Nurse Ratched, it
could be taken as a rape. In keeping with the rape theme, Billy
claims that the others (led by McMurphy) forced him to sleep with
Candy, one of McMurphy's lady friends who sneaks into the
hospital. In truth, Billy IS pushed into the room after trying to
weasel out of the "date" which implies that he was raped. And, of
course, McMurphy was put in jail for rape in the first place.</P>
<P>This picture has some great subtleties. McMurphy starts out
wearing his own clothes, but gradually he dresses like all the
rest, wearing a complete hospital-issued outfit. In fact, this is
a sterile evironment where everything is white and bland. Only
McMurphy's spark can bring any colour into their lives. Another
humourous subtlety is when McMurphy names his fellow patients as
doctors while on an unscheduled fishing trip, except for rival
Harding (who is called "Mr. Harding"). It's a quick insult, but a
good one. Some of their names have hidden relevance too.
McMurphy's initials are R.P.M. which is also an abbreviation in
measuring velocity and speed. McMurphy is certainly a man who
moves quickly. St-st-stuttering Billy Bibbit's name even sounds
like a stutter. Harding's name becomes "Hard On" to McMurphy,
which implies something fairly obvious. And the final subtlety is
that in a film about men interacting with each other, there is an
appropriate amount of swearing--not too much, just right. </P>
<P>Coming out in 1975, which was shortly after the Vietnam conflict,
this film about men failing to adjust to society was timely. Men
were coming back from the failure in Vietnam and many of them had
great difficulties adjusting to a "sane" society. Like "The
Exorcist" this film makes a perfect allegorical reference to the
Vietnam hangover. And, in the film AND in the flop known as
Vietnam, not even true democracy can win because a higher power
is calling all the shots. President Nixon pressed on despite
powerful opposition and Nurse Ratched follows rules so
stringently that she feels compelled to disallow a majority vote
to change the ward's TV policy because "the meeting was
adjourned". And keeping on the political kick, Milos Forman, who
suffered Czechoslovakian dictatorship, appreciates freedom. He
used it as the driving force in "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" and
in this picture. It works too. The main characters in both films
are sympathetic and interesting, if not particularly wholesome.</P>
<P>The greatest message of all in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"
is that humanity and freedom can conquer all adversity. Even if
it takes a symbolic gesture to free your spirit (Chief supplies
that gesture in the end), not conforming to unreasonable rules
and finding the courage to live life your own way is the most
important belief of all. Even doomed Billy had one great moment.
Even though his stutter comes back worse than ever when Nurse
Ratched rains on his parade, he had that one moment. This picture
is funny enough and compelling enough to rip your emotions in
half and LIKE that your emotions are being ripped in half. It's
impossible not to cheer along with them in the imaginary baseball
game sequence or when they score their first two points while
playing the attendants in a game of basketball. They experience
pure joy and the euphoria they feel is contagious. McMurphy
raises a ruckus of epic proportions and, while the other patients
don't seem to be affected outwardly in the final few moments, he
has indeed made a significant impact on their lives. Jack
Nicholson sure did fly "over the cuckoo's nest" and won his first
Oscar for playing a man who tries to be free. As McMurphy said,
"At least I did that".</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Academy Award-winning producers of "One Flew Over
The Cuckoo's Nest", Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas, have also
won Oscars for other films. Zaentz took home Best Picture honours
for "Amadeus" and "The English Patient" while Douglas won Best Actor for 
"Wall Street".</P>
