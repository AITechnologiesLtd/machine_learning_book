<PRE>                        JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE</PRE>
<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Martial arts expert turned movie star Jackie Chan has had a number of
international hits before testing the production markets over here in North
America.  'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Supercop' came out in 1996 and while the
former was an over rated and over hyped disappointment, the latter was decent
entertainment.  Now in 1997 we are subjected to a movie which has to have
Jackie Chan's name in the title.  This movie has considerably less action
than the previous two films mentioned and the humour is both childish and
silly.  Chan is working for the CIA in this movie and a trail of suspicious
circumstances take him around the world and the movie's main setting is
Australia.  He is trying to crack a case involving the Russian mafia which
could lead to stolen nuclear devices being used as a first strike on the
west.  It's difficult to criticze these types of movies because you have to
accept them in many ways for what they are.  There is a terrific scene
involving a chase downhill on skis but many of the action scenes are toned
down and this leaves the audience begging for more.  It has an abrupt ending
where you say "Huh, that's it?"  This is not like reviewing a movie based on
a classic novel or upstanding play or a movie with serious actors.  This
movie is clearly for die hard Jackie Chan fans only and the rest of us will
say, "Well, I can take it or leave it."  That's all I can say about this
movie which doesn't dignify having much more said about it.</P>
