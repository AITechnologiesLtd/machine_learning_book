<PRE>The Hi-Lo Country (R) * 1/2
Starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson
Directed by Stephen Frears
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The modern use of the western movie, and the western genre has almost
evaporated. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and Wild Wild West are some of the most
recent entries, both of them were bad, and this one is coming right along to
join them. What starts out like a promising desert film (Martin Scorsese is one
of the producers) turns into boring drech.</P>
<P>Pete Calder (Crudup, who was Steve Prefontaine in Without Limits) is new to
Hi-Lo, New Mexico. He's here to start his cattle business and quickly makes
friends with, oh, the western version of Woody Harrelson (and, what a surprise,
he's played by Woody Harrelson) his name is Big Boy and he's in the same
business. The two men constantly go to the bar, and celebrate the death of a
man that they beat in poker.</P>
<P>When Mona (Patricia Arquette) crosses through both of their lives, they are
both lovestruck and each of them begin their own private affairs. The men
struggle to keep their bonds alive while they are constantly drunk, herding
cattle, and making crude sexual references. (If this doesn't sound like a
classic western you're right.) The film follows the two men's lives until one
character dies, by the time we get there, we don't really care.</P>
<P>There are three problems in The Hi-Lo Country. One, Harrelson seems to have his
role written exactly for him. Rather than seeing Harrelson's Big Boy character
when I looked on the screen, I saw Woody Harrelson playing the same type of
Woody-ized character that he always plays. This also goes for Arquette, who's
role seems Patricia-ized for her and reminded me constantly of her Alice
character in Lost Highway. Two, the film is boring. So boring in fact, that I
believe my minutes of film to yawn ratio is 6:2. Three, The film plays in no
particular order, showing us a handful of random events that don't have any
meaning to what happens in the conclusion. Add some sappy drama, and you've got
another bad western, The Hi-Lo Country gets *  1/2 stars.</P>
