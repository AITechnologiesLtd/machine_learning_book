Susan Granger's review of "BOSSA NOVA" (Sony Pictures Classics)</PRE>
<P>Brazilian writer/director Bruno Barreto and his wife, actress
Amy Irving, have concocted a mid-life romance set in exotic Rio de
Janeiro. In the screenplay by Alexandre Machado and Fernanda Young,
based on Sergio Sant'Anna's novel, "Miss Simpson," Irving plays an
enigmatic widow, a retired flight attendant, whose Brazilian airline
pilot husband drowned two years earlier. While teaching English, she's
romanced by two suitors: a randy soccer player (Alexandre Borges) and
a lawyer (Antonio Fagundes) whose wife (Debora Bloch) left him for a
tai chi instructor (Kazuo Matsui). Meanwhile, the lawyer's
half-brother (Pedro Cardoso) falls for a sexy legal intern (Giovanna
Antonelli) who, in turn, develops a crush on the soccer star. One of
Irving's students (Drica Moraes) has fallen for a New Yorker (Stephen
Tobolowsky) in a chat room on the Internet. To add to the tropical
turbulence, the language school in which Irving teaches is housed in
the same building where the lawyer's father (Alberto De Mendoza) is
trying to maintain his tailor shop after his latest wife split. All of
this interconnected drama pulsates to the beat of Antonio Carlos
Jobim's bossa nova classics. While it's sumptuously photographed by
Pascal Rabaud, it should be paced like a screwball romantic farce,
complete with mistaken identities and comedic confusion, but,
unfortunately, at times it's somewhat stilted. On the other hand, I
was entranced by a fantasy in which Fagundes imagines himself as a
'40s Fred Astaire, romancing Irving's Ginger Rogers - and an elevator
scene as he surreptitiously measures her for a garment. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bossa Nova" is a bittersweet, sensuous 7. In
Portuguese with English subtitles, it's a movie that makes you want to
call your travel agent.</P>
