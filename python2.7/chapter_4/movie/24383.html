<PRE>              3-D MANIA! - ENCOUNTER IN THE THIRD DIMENSION
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     IMAX is nauseating enough without throwing 3D into the mix, isn't
it?</PRE>
<P>     Shot using state of the art 3D motion picture technology, we've
come a long way since those red and blue glasses.  3-D MANIA! features
all-digital technology that puts up to 37 layers of images in a scene to
literally jump out of the screen and into your lap.</P>
<P>     However, it seems plot development hasn't kept up with
technological advances, and 3-D MANIA!'s story (oddball professor
(Stuart Pankin) tries to bring Elvira, Mistress of the Dark into 3D-land
in order for her to perform an awful song she wrote five long years ago)
is sad, to say the least.</P>
<P>     Still, it's safe to say that no one is going to go to a movie
called 3-D MANIA! for the story.  This is little more than a thrill ride
in an IMAX theater.</P>
<P>     Surprisingly, 3-D MANIA! does have some interesting moments when it
tours the audience through the historical origins and more recent
developments of 3D technology.  The learning-is-fun aspect of the movie
is far more enjoyable than the goofy and lame attempts at humor.  Even
Elvira's miniscule appearance is hardly worth getting excited over.</P>
<P>     As for the thrills of the 3D experience, if you're not going on a
virtual roller coaster ride, something is blowing up in your face.  At a
scant 40 minutes in length, this is still enough to make you nauseous
enough to stumble your way out of the theater afterwards.</P>
<PRE>     And depending on your state of mind, that can be a good thing or a
bad thing.</PRE>
