<P>   Life must be easier in cultures with extended families and
arranged marriages.  In the U.S., which is overrun with
freedom of selection, couples can't get their love lives
together.  The very overchoice available here tempts some
women and men to gather up partners who they feel will
complete them while it invites others to do what they can to
avoid the hunters.  Willard Carroll, whose only other directing
credit is, logically enough, for a horror film ("The Runestone"-
-about an unearthed stone buried in North America by
Norsemen), assembles a group of people with shaky
relationship histories, mixes 'em up for eight days of
fireworks, and then allows us to sit back and watch the
sparks fly.  </P>
<P>   "Playing By Heart" has quite a bit going for it.  Foremost is
the crackerjack cast, headed by Sean Connery and Gena
Rowlands--who have never before worked together and give
you the impression that they have indeed been married for
forty years.  It's a handsome production, displaying a Los
Angeles that's free from dregs, drugs and decadence, a
picturebook-pretty town whose characters live in homes that
seem to spring to life from the pages of Architectural Digest. 
Finally the film evokes some suspense in its audience, who
will wonder throughout how these disparate people are
related and will be astonished at how well director Carroll
brings them together in his final scenes.</P>
<P>  Its principal flaw is its disjointedness. Until Carroll shows the
affiliation of the eleven people in various stages of
connection, he imparts the impression that he's telling six
wholly separate stories.  The narrative is not helped by Pietro
Scalia's disjointed editing.  You could swear that Scalia is
cutting away from scenes in mid-sentence even if he is not
quite that intrusive.  His transitions are so abrupt that
"Playing By Heart" resembles a collage of six different films
cemented together to demonstrate different takes on the
subject of love to a Cinematography 101 class at NYU.</P>
<P>   Although Robert Altman, the premiere director for movies
of this nature, is not credited as Carroll's mentor, "Playing By
Heart" looks as though it were cloned from Altman's mosaic
"Short Cuts."  That picture takes place as well in southern
California, making good use of a similarly sublime cast,
benefitting as "Heart" does not from an adaptation of the
great Raymond Chandler's short stories.  Altman's people are
a more entertaining lot, featuring one phone-sex purveyor
who feeds her baby while playing her trade.  Carroll's people
seem to have no larger-than-life problems but are rather
afflicted with some routine dilemmas, and in the case of the
eldest couple a particularly silly one blown up to divorce-sized
proportions but a most undiplomatic fellow.</P>
<P>   The film had a working title "Dancing About Architecture,"
taken from a quote by one of its participants that "talking
about love is like dancing about architecture."  That may be
so, but Carroll's people are out to prove otherwise. 
Examining the plight of the sixty-something Paul (Sean
Connery) and his wife of forty years Hannah (Gena
Rowlands), Carroll lays out a marriage of a couple who are
doing quite well, living in a lavish, capacious home in which
Hannah regularly tapes her TV cooking show.  Their union is
on the verge of a rupture by a vivid discussion of a link that
Paul had a quarter century ago.  Rather than laugh off the
near-affair, Paul insists on dredging up the passionate feeling
which his brief liaison evoked in him, causing unnecessary
harm to his lengthy union.  By contrast, the youngest couple--
party girl Joan (Angelina Jolie) and her new discovery
Keenan (Ryan Phillippe)--are almost defeated before they
start because the mysterious young man, a frequent guest at
the local disco, insists "I don't date."  Dennis Quaid has his
moments as a flagrant liar, Hugh, who visits bars to tell
women the most egregiously far-fetched stories about the
wife he "lost."  Only one of his listeners, a transvestite
(played winningly by the cast's relatively unknown Alec
Mapa), sees right through him.  Add a dreary affair between
a married man, Roger (Anthony Edwards) and a woman who
wants to keep the relationship free of baggage, Gracie
(Madeleine Stowe); and perhaps the most complex attempt at
connecting--between a resisting theater director, Meredith
(Gillian Anderson) and a pursuing Trent (Jon Stewart)--and
you have your pot pourri of romantic possibilities.  In a
seemingly unrelated story, one which deals with maternal,
rather than romantic, love, a tearful mother, Mildred (Ellen
Burstyn) is confronted by her son who is dying of AIDS, Mark
(Jay Mohr) and who insists that his mom tell him the truth
about her marriage before he dies.</P>
<P>   The film is occasionally witty, with mismatched characters
going about their lives as though their strings are being pulled
by Neil Simon.  If you're willing to go with the warmed-over
sentimentality and unoriginal situations, you'll be grandly
entertained by some of Hollywood's accomplished
performers.  The movie would have worked better if it were
structured more like Arthur Schnitzler's classic tale of love,
"La Ronde," which is enjoying an adaptation currently on
Broadway.  In that theater piece, the scenes interlock with
one another: two characters appear in each and one of these
moves into the next to afford a link.  Nor did Schnitzler need
to rely on five large dogs and a one-eyed cat to show how
human lives are, by contrast, all too complicated.</P>
