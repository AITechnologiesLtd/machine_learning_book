Reviewed April 10, 1999.</P>
<P>Doug Liman's "Go" is a glittery, flashy, and fast-paced dark 
comedy-thriller in the obvious style of Quentin Tarantino. Although the 
basic outline is completely different, both films feature off-beat and 
interesting dialogue; several dispicible, if very funny, characters; and 
the same invigorating non-linear storytelling techniques.</P>
<P>Set entirely on Christmas Eve and early Christmas morning in L.A., "Go" 
begins with a jolt as we are treated to quick flashes of a rave before 
the Columbia logo is even finished. We then move on to the stories at 
hand. Ronna is a 20-year-old grocery story worker who is threatened to 
be evicted from her apartment if she doesn't come up with enough money 
soon. Accepting to take a double-shift when her English co-worker, Simon 
(Desmond Askew), goes on a trip to Las Vegas, Ronna finally sees a light 
at the end of the tunnel when two of her customers, Zack (Jay Mohr) and 
Adam (Scott Wolf), approach her about scoring some ecstacy. Agreeing to 
sell them some, Ronna sets off to see Todd (Timothy Olyphant), a drug 
dealer, but when she doesn't have enough money to pay him for the pills, 
she forces her friend, Claire (Katie Holmes), to stay with him as 
colateral. As predicted, things don't go quite as planned.</P>
<P>Switching back to the opening of the film, we now follow Simon on his 
wild trip to Las Vegas with his three buddies (Taye Diggs, Breckin 
Meyer, and James Duval), where he runs into problems after sleeping with 
two strangers, causing a large fire, and breaking the "no-touch" rule 
when he hires a stripper to dance for Marcus (Diggs) and him.</P>
<P>The last story involves Zack and Adam, two soap opera actors, who 
unwittingly find themselves having Christmas dinner with a sexually 
determined cop (William Fichtner) and his oddball wife (Jane Krakowski). 
These three tales, as well as several enjoyable and well-written 
subplots, one in which involves the unexpected romantic coupling of 
good-girl Claire and the shady Todd, all inevitably careen and cross 
paths with each other by the film's end, but many of the plot 
developments really are genuinely surprising and satisfying. </P>
<P>There are many pleasures to be had in "Go," but one of the greatest 
satisfactions is in the unorthodox way that the film is made, as it 
actually leaves it up to you to use your mind and follow all of the 
feuding stories. You rarely see this in a wide-release film, and 
sometimes it can be distracting, but "Go" moves so smoothly through time 
that it was almost impossible not to get caught up in the proceedings. 
Not only that, but I am the type of person who especially loves to 
discover films without having the outcome be telegraphed well in 
advance. Here, there is no way to figure out how everything is going to 
turn out, and it was this anticipation that involved me even more. John 
August should be personally thanked for writing the sharp-witted and 
entertaining screenplay, which, at a swift 100 minutes, gives the 
characters enough time to have many intriguing conversations and 
distinguish themselves with each other.</P>
<P>In the acting department, I doubt a superior young cast could have been 
possibly executed, and this was an impressive career move for all 
involved. Giving the best performance is Katie Holmes, who also has 
likability on her side since she is, perhaps, the only non-slimy 
character in the whole film. Not only that, but Holmes really does prove 
how promising she is as an actress, as the words in the superb 
screenplay effortlessly roll out of her mouth like wildfire. Also 
particular standouts are Sarah Polley, so much different than her 
sympathetic parapalegic role in 1997's "The Sweet Hereafter," and Taye 
Diggs, who sparks all of his scenes to life (as if the movie didn't 
already have enough life to it!).</P>
<P>Although "Go" may appear from the television ads like it is another
 teen-oriented movie, it really isn't at all. In fact, the youngest 
character is probably around nineteen or twenty, and the age group goes 
all the way up to one central character who is in his forties. 
Thankfully, there's no high school in sight, nor is there a prom, or a 
cliched plot.</P>
<P>Director Doug Liman made a splash in 1996 with his indie film, 
"Swingers," starring Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, and he actually 
improves upon that film to bring us something more assured and complex. 
Kudos also go out to the gritty cinematography by Liman himself, which 
is a spectacle to see (particularly the rave scenes), and the 
perfectly-assembled soundtrack, with the song, "New," by No Doubt, 
making a big impression. A goofy, hilarious sequence has another of 
Ronna's friends (Nathan Bexton) hallucinating from taking a hit of 
ecstacy and imagining that he is dancing with a grocery story customer 
to the Macarena song.</P>
<P>If there is a problem with "Go," it is the same problem I had with the 
slightly superior "Pulp Fiction," which is that for all of its 
intricacies, the movie ultimately doesn't really lead up to much. The 
twists and turns are sorted out, yes, but what I mean is that nothing 
much is solved, as everything simply circles around in time. 
Fortunately, the performances, direction, screenplay, and impressive 
technical aspects work together as a solid unit to make the exciting 
journey to nowhere a great deal of fun. In short, "Go" really does, 
well, go! </P>
