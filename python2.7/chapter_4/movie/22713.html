<P>If you've either never heard the true story of Rubin "The Hurricane" 
Carter and how he was imprisoned for more than 20 years for crimes he 
didn't commit, or you can't infer whether he was released or not from 
the tone of the trailers that have been shown, you might not want to 
read this review, since I'll be pulling no punches in telling what 
happened at the end.  After all, I respect my readers' intelligence.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
A strong contender for the middleweight boxing title during the 60s, 
Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter's (Denzel Washington) hopes were dashed 
when he and John Artis (Garland Whitt) were sentenced to three life 
terms and imprisoned for 20 years for murders he didn't commit.  This is 
his story...</P>
<P>...and it is also the story of an unlikely group of folks from Canada 
(one, by way of Brooklyn): Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), a 
young Black teen from Brooklyn, being homeschooled in Toronto by three 
White Canadians, Lisa Peters (Deborah Unger), Sam Chaiton (Liev 
Schreiber), and Terry Swinton (John Hannah).  By a strange twist of 
fate, Lesra finds a book written by Rubin about his unjust imprisonment, 
and he is so moved by it and his feverent belief in Rubin's innocence, 
that he convinces the Canadians to help him set Rubin free.  But not 
without a fight; they come up against pure evil, in the form of Det. 
Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya), a dirty, racist cop who's been after 
Carter for years, and does all he can to see that Rubin remains locked 
up.</P>
<P>The Upshot (WARNING: **more spoilers contained below**)
Let me get this out of the way: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon 
Shannon, and Dan Hedaya were outstanding in this film.  Washington, 
we've seen go "all-out" before, so his strong performance didn't 
surprise me at all.  Hedaya is one of those character actors that you 
know you've seen a million time, but can't put your finger on where, 
exactly; he's played Funny ("Cheers") as well as straight drama 
("Nixon"), but never before has he sent chills down my spine as he did 
here.  But Shannon really impressed me in the strangest of ways: every 
time he spoke, I said to myself, "his voice and his body don't match".  
For some reason, I kept expecting to hear a "softer" voice, but sure 
enough, his heavy Brooklyn accent came through each time.  But beyond 
that, Shannon's portrayal of Lesra's passionate belief in Rubin, and in 
his place in Rubin's life, astonished me--and will hopefully move him 
beyond the Obligatory Thug Roles that the IMDB lists him as having 
played so frequently in the past (if there's any justice in Hollywood.  
Notice that I'm not holding my breath).</P>
<P>The story itself, though moving, felt somewhat hollow.  Though of course 
Rubin couldn't know what became of John Artis while they were both in 
prison, I felt short-changed by the offhand mention of him throughout 
the film, and especially at the end.  I also got somewhat dizzy during 
the flashback/flashforward sequences; though the boxing scenes were 
beautifully shot in black and white, they felt cut-n-pasted on, and I 
could never fully understand their true significance to the story being 
told.  And one has to wonder how, after Rubin's lawyers Myron Beldoc 
(David Paymer) and Harris Yulin (Leon Friedman) spent ten years on a 
case that was heard by two juries, the Canadians could come along 
and...well, see for yourself.  Something else bothered me, involving 
Rubin's wife, Mae Thelma (Debbie Morgan) and the scene from the trailers 
which show Rubin telling her to "bury him".  Unfortunately, saying 
exactly what bothered me, would call for more spoilage than I'm prepared 
to do, so I'll have to wait to discuss this with the curious reader 
after they've has seen the movie.  Still, in spite of its padding (a 
half-hour could've easily been excised from this movie, with little 
detriment), "The Hurricane" spins a good tale; fractured, in places, but 
still told reasonably well.</P>
<P>Besides the performances of the three leads mentioned above, most of the 
other cast seemed pretty mute.  Liev Schreiber was almost invisible in a 
role that one would think would provide ample opportunity for him to 
shine in--especially since his character's (Sam Chaiton) book is given a 
writing credit in the film.  Unger and Hannah were almost as marginal; 
until their stint at private eye-ism, they could just as well have been 
shown as Lesra's babysitters, to no real detriment to the story.  And 
what a wasted opportunity the movie's Powers That Be made in not using 
Clancy Brown to his fullest potential; he's played prison guards enough 
before that casting him as Jimmy Williams, the Guard With A Heart (But 
Not Much To Do), made little sense to me.  But still, not as little 
sense as the casting of Rod Steiger as Judge H. Lee Sorokin.  Maybe I'm 
the only one who saw "Crazy In Alabama", and therefore, saw Steiger's 
Judge there.  Played as an absolute loon in that film, Steiger worked; 
here, he was just more flotsam.  But maybe I'm too picky.</P>
<P>The use of period music throughout the film was excellent, even Bob 
"damn, I can't sing!" Dylan's song, "Hurricane", written during the time 
when Dylan was one of a few celebrities (along with Ellen Burstyn and 
Muhammad Ali) who were trying to get Rubin set free early on in his 
sentence.  Their involvement (or lack thereof) over time was a key point 
made by Beldoc, when Lesra and the Canadians came to confront him in 
what Beldoc surely saw as Guilty White Liberalism at its worst.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Actually, since the BF is pretty clear in this flick, consider this 
space The "White Factor".  And let's go one step further: since Della 
Pesca's (and those like him) rabid racism need no explanation, let's 
examine the "Guilty White Liberal Factor", shall we?</P>
<P>Guilty White Liberals make an easy target; they seem to come in like a 
whirlwind, upset the status quo, do what they see as The Right Thing for 
those poor heathens who they deem worthy of their patronage, and leave 
after their Guilt is assuaged, right?  Well, maybe.  And maybe the three 
Guilty White Liberals from Canada took pity on both Rubin and Lesra, and 
by helping them, they purged themselves of their Guilt long enough to 
look back at their lives and feel they've Done Good--much to the 
consternation of those other poor heathens left behind in their wake who 
weren't so lucky as to gain the favor of those Guilty White Liberals.  
Maybe that's the way some see it. </P>
<P>To those "some", ask yourself this: is Rubin still in that prison?</P>
<P>And as for the fellow (self-identified as being White) who, after he 
read Diva's "The Hurricane" review, took it upon himself to scold 3BC, 
saying we should be ashamed for not slamming "The Hurricane" for 
deifying those Guilty White Liberals?  Pardon my French, but he can 
baise mon bel noir ane.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line 
Overall, a powerful story that feels padded in spots (especially those 
involving the Danger! the Canadians were in, and how they so "easily" 
did what others couldn't do over the period of 15 or so years.  Yeah, 
right.), featuring bravura performances by Washington, Shannon, and 
Hedaya that should not be missed, but will likely be ignored come Oscar 
night.</P>
<PRE>"The Hurricane": (rating: greenlight)  
A knockout.</PRE>
