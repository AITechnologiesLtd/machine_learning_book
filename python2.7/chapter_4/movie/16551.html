<P>
 The Mask of Zorro (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Antonio Banderas,
Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones.</P>
<P> The Mask of Zorro is everything you'd want a swashbuckler to be.</P>
<P> A tale filled with romance, daring deeds, spectacular stunts, stunning
swordplay, dashing heroes, dastardly villains, all done on a
larger-than-life tableaux with a sly bit of tongue-in-cheek.</P>
<P> This rousing adventure spans 20 years and tells of the aged Don Diego de
la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), the original Zorro, who after languishing in
prison for 20 years escapes and finds an apt pupil, Alejandro Murieta
(Antonio Banderas), to train and take his place. Think of it as a
19th-century "Rapier Kid."</P>
<P> Don Diego seeks revenge against Don Raphael Montero (Stuart Wilson) who,
as the despised governor of California 20 years earlier, was responsible
for the death of Don Diego's wife, killed in the struggle to capture Zorro.</P>
<P> Montero, who fled to Spain with Elena, Diego's baby daughter, has returned
to California with the now-grown girl who believes the villain is her
father. Montero's scheme is to buy California from Mexico and establish an
independent nation with himself as leader.</P>
<P> Thwarting him at every turn is the new, young Zorro, Alejandro, trained by
Diego to be a "servant of the people," to protect them and right wrongs.</P>
<P> Under the able direction of Martin Campbell (Goldeneye), The Mask of Zorro
is a sweeping adventure with an old-fashioned sensibility, recalling the
days when Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. and Jr.) picked up a sword
to defend the helpless, protect the crown and defeat all blackguards.</P>
<P> However, the movie does offer a nod to the '90s. Elena (the stunning
Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a spunky lass who speaks her mind and can handle a
sword as well as any man.</P>
<P> Hopkins is wise, patient and determined as the aged Diego, passing on not
only his knowledge of how to handle a sword and whip, but how to outfox the
opposition to his hot-headed student.</P>
<P> Banderas is charming, a bit self-depreciating and charismatic as the new
man in black. He handles a sword with skill, dances well and woos Elena
with panache and wit.</P>
<P> Wilson is a fine, brains heavy who leaves much of the dirty work to his
murderous aide, Capt. Love (the handsome and chilling Matt Letscher).</P>
<P> The duels are exciting and flashy, enhanced by a wonderfully full score by
Academy Award-winner James Horner.</P>
<P> The Mask of Zorro is a grand time, filled with colorful characters and
grand landscapes. It recalls a time when movies were magical.</P>
