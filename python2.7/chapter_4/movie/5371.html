<PRE>                                 THE BIRDCAGE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Elton John has a new favorite movie. This homosexual 
transvestite farce isn't one of my personal favorites, though, and not 
because of the flamboyant gayness aspect either. THE BIRDCAGE is 
only sporadically funny, with too many jokes and scenes that just 
don't work and not enough of the ones that do to balance it out. 
The key phrase for what would improve this movie is tighter 
editing, but obviously there's nothing tight in THE BIRDCAGE.</P>
<P>        Robin Williams, looking too much like Kevin Kline with a 
moustache, plays the owner of a nightclub where people go to see 
men dress up as women and lip synch old disco songs (eerily 
reminiscent of my seventeenth birthday party). The featured 
performer is Robin's longtime companion, Albert (Nathan Lane), 
who I have to say makes the ugliest woman ever. Lane contributes 
the most hilarious performance of the movie by reinforcing every 
gay stereotype in existence. I guess it's only politically correct to 
make stereotypical gay jokes if the people making the jokes are 
gay themselves.</P>
<P>        The conflict arises as Robin'sis 
wedding to a woman (oh, the horror). Worse, she's the daughter 
of conservative senator Gene Hackman, co-founder of a Moral 
Majority-type organization. And still worse, they're all driving 
down for dinner with Mr. and Mr. Williams. Still worse yet, the 
daughter has told Hackman and his wife (Dianne Weist) that her 
fiancee's parents are your average businessman-housewife combo, 
something any upstanding Republican senator's daughter can be 
proud to marry into.</P>
<P>        So Williams gives in to his son and agrees to redecorate the 
house. The anatomically-correct nude sculptures have to go. And so 
does Albert, until he convinces Williams that he can play the role of a 
straight uncle. It's obvious he can't, though, during one of the funniest 
scenes in the movie, which also has Williams trying to teach him to 
act "like a real man," complete with crotch-grabbing, spitting, football 
conversations and repititions of the phrase "f---in' A!" And in the role 
of Williams' wife, the mother of his child (and the only woman he ever 
slept with), Christine Baranski from "Cybill."</P>
<P>        The entire last third of THE BIRDCAGE features the actual 
dinner between Hackman and Williams' families, which complicates 
itshen Baranski gets caught in traffic, Albert decides to play the 
role of his career and a group of tabloid journalists gather outside to 
get pictures of Hackman's meeting with a gay couple. Like the rest of 
the film, it does have some genuine laughs as well as tedious scenes 
that just don't work and should have been cut. THE BIRDCAGE is, 
at its current length of two hours, a mixed bag of entertainment with 
great actors doing great things some of the time and mediocre things 
the rest of the time. At an hour-and-a-half it would be a genuinely 
good comedy because we all know length does matter.</P>
