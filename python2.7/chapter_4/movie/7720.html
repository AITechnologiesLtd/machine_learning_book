                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1989, PG-13, 126 minutes [2 hours, 6 minutes]
[adventure/crime]
starring: Michael Keaton (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Jack Nicholson (Joker/Jack
Napier), Kim Basinger (Vicky Vale), Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox), produced by
Jon Peters, Peter Guber, written by Sam Hamm, Warren Skaaren, directed by Tim
Burton, based on characters appearing in DC comics, Batman created by Bob
Kane.</P>
<P>>From the premise alone, "Batman" should be one of the greatest adventure
films of all time, but it is not. It tends to trade substance for style and
its storytelling is choppy. Despite all these flaws, there is a sense of
exciting adventure, even if it exists for the superficial qualities.</P>
<P>The opening establishes one of the most vivid and powerful moods I've ever
seen. The Gothic design by Anton Furst provides for an almost horrific
atmosphere as it works with the script to create an entirely different
reality quickly. We see an ordinary family take a wrong turn through a
typical dark alley and become another statistic of street crime. The thieves
are more pathetic than vile and when we see Batman (Keaton) confront and
disarm them (mostly through fear), it shows how mighty the sheer presence of
Batman can be.</P>
<P>I wish that attitude of fighting real crime had been the theme of the film
as it gives everyone a sense of pride. But this is a major Hollywood picture
and it must portray (read: "cash in on") all the marketable aspects of the
Batman persona to make it appealing. Everyone knows the basics of Batman: he
is really billionaire Bruce Wayne by day and his arch nemesis is The Joker.
Unfortunately, Batman is assimilated with cartoon-like qualities with all the
characters and plotlines plugged in at all the right places.</P>
<P>The basic story involves mob warfare and betrayal between the two heads of
the biggest gang; "Boss" Grisham (Jack Palance) and Jack Napier (Nicholson).
The first act is very jumbled, it tries to establish a complex criminal
organization and a rivalry. Although the details are very sketchy, it serves
its purpose; to lead up to Napier's transformation to The Joker and his
psychotic rampage on Gotham City.</P>
<P>The middle act is slowly paced but works fine for character and plot
development. Nicholson is often hilarious as The Joker, but his zaniness is
countered by a supposedly serious relationship between Bruce Wayne and
investigative photographer Vicky Vale (Basinger). Of all the cliche elements,
this one does not synchronize smoothly. They seem to fall for each other
extremely fast, but Keaton and Basinger have little chemistry. However, the
storytelling is interesting enough as to never become dull. We become
curious, but not as involved as the film would like us to be.</P>
<P>And since this is supposed to be a grand Hollywood adventure we must have an
ultimate showdown between the two forces of good and evil. The ending itself
seemed a little dry to me. We get some fight scenes between Batman and
Joker's goons, but in a very cheesy manner. In fact, The Joker almost wins in
the end!</P>
<P>This film had so much potential it could have been a work of genius. On one
hand it does establish a mood chisled with detail which is interesting; but
on the other hand the blatantly evil and cartoony nature of The Joker doesn't
seem to keep to with the film. The Joker's cars, helicopters, and badges on
the gang members is too lighthearted compared to the dark, Gothic mood of
Gotham and Batman.</P>
<P>Still, "Batman" isn't bad at all. It's disposable adventure, but at least
it's original and enjoyable.</P>
