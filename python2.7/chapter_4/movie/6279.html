<PRE>                            LOOKING FOR RICHARD
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: LOOKING FOR RICHARD is so ambitious
          that it works better as a partial failure than most
          films do that are successes.  This is a pseudo-
          documentary about the making of what I take to be a
          non-existent film adaptation of Shakespeare's
          RICHARD III and the discussions of the material as
          the actors prepare. There is the discussion of
          Shakespeare and of RICHARD III, interspersed with
          seeing how the actors actually do the scenes.
          LOOKING FOR RICHARD makes an engrossing companion
          piece to last year's wonderful film production of
          RICHARD III with Ian McKellen.  The discussion
          opens up the play RICHARD III and indeed all of
          Shakespeare and gives us an unparalleled behind-
          the-scenes look at the actors' craft.  Director and
          star Al Pacino falls down only in being a bit to
          self-indulgent and in allowing this to become a
          vanity piece with too many diversions into
          arguments and clowning around on and off set.
          Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     With a remarkable number of Shakespeare plays being made into
films recently, LOOKING FOR RICHARD, directed, co-produced, and co-
written by Al Pacino, could not have been more timely.  There have been
many films about the activity of making films, but to my knowledge this
is the first film about the making of a Shakespeare film.  It gives
real insight into the richness and complexity of Shakespeare's writing
as well as into the filmmaking process.  Pacino's film seamlessly
bounces between real documentary and scenes of the fictitious
production of an all-star version of RICHARD III.  Meanwhile not just
the actors in the supposed film (Al Pacino, Harris Yulin, Penelope
Allen, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Estelle Parsons, Winona Ryder, and
Aiden Quinn), but also guests not in the film--like Kenneth Branagh,
Kevin Kline, James Earl Jones, Rosemary Harris, Peter Brook, Derek
Jacobi, John Gielgud, and Vanessa Redgrave--talk about the content of
Shakespeare and the art of acting Shakespeare.  To have all these
people in one film is remarkable in itself.  To get them all talking
about a subject like Shakespeare is wonderful.  To then waste so much
time watching Pacino clown around as much as he does is agonizing.
Indeed, Pacino as a director just does not know when to say no to
Pacino the actor.  After last year for me now the definitive Richard
will be Ian McKellen.  To see Pacino overpowering the role of Richard
as he overpowers so many of his roles is almost painful.  There are
places that the plotting of the film is inconsistent.  For example,
apparently the actors are making no more than a film version of the
play, but at one point Pacino argues with the adaptation's putative
director as to whether they should have an expert discussing the play
looking into the camera.  Pacino's allusions to his other films amount
almost to product placements--at one point he refers to a scene of the
play as the "meeting of the Dons," he wears a cap that says "Scent of a
Woman," and intentionally or not RICHARD III has rather obvious plot
parallels to SCARFACE.  The positives of LOOKING FOR RICHARD would
dwarf the negatives if it were not for the latter taking too much
precious time.</P>
<P>     Pacino's feature-length discussion of Shakespeare also makes some
telling points about the people who play Shakespeare.  John Gielgud's
viewpoint seems so plain and simple while Vanessa Redgrave goes off
into a rambunctious and pretentious incoherence about the "pentameter
of the soul."  These discussions by some of the great actors of our
time into why the Bard does what he does with language and how his
plays are to be acted will undoubtedly be used in the years to come as
part of college courses, yet it is entertaining enough for paying
audiences even while it instructs.  Even the street interviews are
instructive and show a range of people from the well-dressed who have
never seen a Shakespeare play to one man obviously less fortunate who
waxes on about how if in school if we read more Shakespeare we would
know how to feel and would have less violence in the streets.  The
film's playful approach to the classic starts at the very opening
credits that at first say KING RICHARD, then fill in the additional
letters to say LOOKING FOR RICHARD.  It is Pacino's point of view that
today's actors are the inheritors of a grand tradition of acting and
drama, the centerpiece of which is the contribution of William
Shakespeare.</P>
<P>     If Pacino's goal were just to make this one play accessible, which
in large part it was, I would say he fell short of last year's
production which shows more of the play without ever being
inaccessible.  For the additional insights into the plays of
Shakespeare and the acting required in them I would say LOOKING FOR
RICHARD is more successful.  I rate it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
