<PRE>Rating: * * * out of * * * * (On the Good Bad Movie Scale)</PRE>
<P>Rated: PG for some language and menacing action/violence.</P>
<P>Starring: Takehiro Murata, Naomi Nishida, Mayu Suzuki, Hiroshi Abe, Shirô 
Sano.</P>
<PRE>Running Time: 110 Minutes</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Takao Okawara</PRE>
<P>When you walk into the movie theatre to see "Godzilla 2000" please do not 
expect to see "American Beauty" or "Gone with the Wind", and do not expect to 
see a re-hash of the 1998 Hollywood bomb "Godzilla". Nope this is the real 
thing, Godzilla in all his man-in-rubber-suit, bad mouth doesn't movie at the 
same rate as voice does dubbing, over the top acting, bad dialogue, cheesy 
effects and big time entertainment. That is what a Godzilla movie is made of, 
and "Godzilla 2000" is just that!</P>
<P>In a continuation of the typical Godzilla story, Yuji Shinodo (Takehiro 
Murata) and his daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki) of the Godzilla Prediction Network 
are once again on the run for Godzilla, trying to find him, watch and study 
him. With the help of a stubborn reporter Yuki Ichinose (Naomi Nishida) who 
is mostly along to take pictures, they must stop a madman Mitsuo Katagiri 
(Hiroshi Abe) from trying to kill Godzilla for destroying the city over all 
these years. Since they really do not understand who Godzilla is, they take 
the usual approach: Don't understand it, Kill it. The GPN team must try to 
stop him from doing this, while a strange rock is found underwater and ends 
up being an alien spaceship from millions of years ago, to which is bent on 
destroying Japan. Now it is time for Godzilla to do his job, and destroy this 
monster before its too late.</P>
<P>Surprisingly enough "Godzilla 2000" is a huge entertainment piece, that I 
really had fun with. I laughed at the cheesy part of the film, and believe me 
it's all there. You cannot help but like these kind of movies. They are the 
so bad it's good type movie, with the overacting, odd dialogue and bad 
dubbing. One thing that I wasn't expecting was the special effects, which 
were surprisingly good for this type of low-budget movie which is set to 
become a camp classic. First up the acting is horrible, but its pretty bad, 
typical for this kind of movie, but the lead stars keep it afloat and give us 
something to chuckle at. </P>
<P>Godzilla himself is so cool looking, and even at one point I could see the 
hole in the head on the roof of his mouth where a light bulb was to light up 
his eyes. He strides around the city destroying everything in site. Burning, 
crashing, stepping on, hitting, whatever he can do he definitely does it. So 
of course one cannot help but compare this movie to the 1998 big Hollywood 
Bomb "Godzilla". Even though the 98 version wasn't a horrible movie, it was 
far from being good. You just can't americanize a Godzilla movie, it's just 
not possible. There's no bad dubbing, or special effects, everything is in 
place and it really just doesn't fit in.</P>
<P>So on one of those MST3K type of scales "Godzilla 2000" is a great film to 
watch with a group of friends, or when your in the mood to watch just an 
entertaining movie. So go ahead to your local movie theatre, pay the cheap 
matinee price and see "Godzilla 2000" believe me, it will be one of the 
funnest times you've had at the movies this year. Great fun.</P>
