<P>For every super hero there are a hundred wannabees. In the super hero
business, wannabees are those good hearted men and women with something
less than superpowers who nonetheless have a burning desire to fight
crime and avenge the righteous. MYSTERY MEN is a film about them.  </P>
<P>Champion City already has its resident protector. But Captain Amazing
(Greg Kinnear, AS GOOD AS IT GETS), his uniform tattooed with product
endorsements, has done his job so well, there simply aren't any super
villains left to vanquish. Enter Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush,
ELIZABETH) who easily tricks the captain and holds him captive while he
makes plans to destroy the city. </P>
<P>With Captain Amazing incapacitated, the only ones standing in
Frankenstein's way are our would-be heroes: Six kooks in funny looking
costumes. They are: The Shoveler (William H. Macy, A CIVIL ACTION),
expert with a spade, not so good explaining his pastime activities to
his wife; Mr. Furious (Jerry Stiller, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY)
whose only talent seems to be in getting mad; The Blue Raja (Hank
Azaria, GODZILLA) who flings his mother's flatware (forks and spoons
only) with pinpoint accuracy; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo, PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT) who converses with her father's skull encased in her bowling
ball; The Spleen (Paul Reubens, PEEWEE'S BIG ADVENTURE) whose flatulence
is so noxious it literally knocks out his opponents; and The Invisible
Boy (Kel Mitchell, GOOD BURGER) who can only turn invisible if no one
looks at him. </P>
<P>Together, these dimwitted defenders of truth and justice, under the
guidance of The Sphinx (Wes Studi, DEEP RISING) who talks in a fortune
cookie language, ("He who questions training only trains himself to ask
questions"), must rise to the challenge of saving their city and their
city's hero from certain doom. </P>
<P>MYSTERY MEN is based on the DARK HORSE comic books by Bob Burden. With
such an unquestionably talented cast as has been assembled, it is
disappointing to say that this is not a better film. The problem lies
primarily with director Kinka Usher who is making his feature film
debut. Mr.  Usher is perhaps best known for his award winning talking
Chihuahua Taco Bell commercials. No doubt he has learned that capturing
an audience's attention for 30 seconds is a lot easier than doing the
same over a 90 minute span. </P>
<P>The script is weak, the humor rather puerile, and the actors, excepting
the work of Mr. Kinnear and Mr. Macy, seem lost in a sea of good ideas
gone bad. Mr. Kinnear is amusingly smug as the corporate sponsored
Captain Amazing. Mr. Macy, as the crewcut wearing, shovel-wielding
epitome of a working man, wears his idealistic values on his sleeve. His
consistency, as a character, is part of the glue that keeps this movie
from falling completely apart. </P>
<P>A film of this scope needed a much firmer hand and clearer vision than
Mr. Usher provided. The concept is one that is actually quite
appealing... Working class men and women who have unusual yet obviously
developed skills, acting out the role of "super-hero" to benefit a
society that barely is aware of their existence. Their success comes
only from their working in unison. They must combine their various
talents in order to have any possibility to defeat their common foe. </P>
<P>Followers of Christ must work in the same manner. By combining our
individual talents, knowledge and abilities, we lend support and
strength to each other's weaknesses. Together, with God, we have the
prevailing strength necessary to stand against our spiritual enemy. The
scriptures say: </P>
<PRE>"Lest Satan should get an advantage of US: for WE are not ignorant of
his
devices." 2 Corinthians 2:11 [KJV]</PRE>
<P>It is folly to enter into the spiritual competition alone. As the Sphinx
might say: "He who fails to stand with team, will stand to fail alone." </P>
