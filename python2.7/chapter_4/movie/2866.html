<P>     Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is a Polish hairdresser who has
married glamorous and successful model Dominique (Julie Delpy) and
moved with her to Paris.  However, he is impotent and unable to
consummate the marriage, so she divorces him, frames him for the arson
of her business, and throws him out onto the street with a large trunk
containing all his possessions.  Despite all this, she tells him that
she still loves him and wants him.</P>
<P>     Karol takes up playing sad Polish folksongs on a comb-and-paper
harmonica in the Metro, and meets Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), a depressive
Polish chess player.  The two of them conceive a plan to get Karol back
to Poland despite his lack of passport, and once there, Karol
determines that he is going to win Dominique back: when he has achieved
equality (personal equality, financial equality and equality of power)
with her, then he will be able to perform sexually.</P>
<P>     The films lurches unsteadily between comedy and tragedy.  Zbigniew
Zamachowski reprises his comic persona from THE DECALOGUE: TEN with
initial success as the whole world (incarnate in a pigeon outside the
divorce court) seems to dump on him.  He's less convincing as a cunning
and successful businessman later in the film, but the sharp and funny
portrayal of the new free-market Poland, where everything is for sale
and where a few lucky people make money through being in the right
place at the right time saves this section.  The ending is so sad and
yet such an inevitable and appropriate come-uppance for both of the
main characters that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</P>
<P>     If WHITE is unfair to anyone, it's to Dominique.  Kieslowski is
sometimes accused of misogyny, and certainly in this film it isn't
clear at all why Dominique behaves as she does.  We never see enough of
her point of view to determine why she loves this clown of a
hairdresser or why she is forced to stand up in court and say that she
does not love him.</P>
