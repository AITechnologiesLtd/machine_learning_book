A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Doug Ellin</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Doug Ellin and James Frey</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients:
Man who loves woman, woman who is engaged to man's friend</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
A man and a woman who intend to get married attend a wedding reception
and ask Linda the publisher (Bonnie Hunt) how the bride and groom met.
In four or five vignettes, she explains the story to them:</P>
<P>Writer Jay (Jason Lee) and his editor Samantha (Mili Avital) are both
literary types, and they work together and are falling in love.
Unfortunately, Samantha is already engaged to Jay's best friend, Max the
womanizer (David Schwimmer). This situation is easily solved, since the
moment Samantha finds out Max is a womanizer, she can live guiltlessly
and happily ever after with Jay.</P>
<P>Opinion:
The problem with this film is that the situation can be solved in a half
hour sitcom, so KISSING A FOOL has a very difficult time stretching the
story out to an hour and forty five minutes. They do this by breaking
the film up into five or so comedic situations which last about five
minutes a piece. Each situation is then followed by a five-minute
let-down period where the joke peters out, and then the camera has to
switch back to an unconvincingly enthusiastic couple asking publisher
Linda what will happen next in the story.</P>
<P>One really strange thing that differentiates this film from all the
others I've seen this year is that in every scene, whether home, living
room, front porch, office, restaurant, or bedroom, people are gulping
down alcohol like fish taking to water. They guzzle tequila shots, wine,
and beer on a continuous basis oblivious to the fact that they are
alcoholics.</P>
<P>KISSING A FOOL is entirely predictable, and feels completely contrived.
There is one mysterious part where Max hands two envelopes to Jay and
Samantha, but the envelopes are never explained. On the good side, at
least the wedding reception and ending are happy. </P>
