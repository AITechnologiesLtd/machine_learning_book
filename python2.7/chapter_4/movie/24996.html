<P>Freddie Prinze, Jr. has said in recent interviews that the reason he made a 
string of teen movies in the last two years is because, in a sense, his goal 
was to create a trilogy of films that his generation could relate to, and 
appreciate. The opening part of the film threesome, "She's All That," was a 
cliched and rather uninspired high school dramedy that had a cast of fresh 
faces, but stereotyped each and every one of them. "Down to You" was the 
second film, inferior to "She's All That," and ruined by a mess of a 
screenplay and Prinze, Jr.'s amateurish performance. The final part of the 
trilogy, "Boys and Girls," is the best of the three, intelligently written 
and with just a little more going on in its head than the usual film of its 
type. It also can be noted as Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s very first movie in which 
he is actually pretty good in it. Usually striking frequent false notes in 
each of his performances, he has finally come into his own as an actor here, 
and it's a good thing, for the cast of "Boys and Girls" is its strongest 
asset.</P>
<P>Ryan (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) first met on an 
airplane when they were 12-years-old, both flying alone en route to Los 
Angeles. The free-thinking Jennifer had just gotten her first period, and her 
graphic talks of it both confused and disgusted the anal-retentive Ryan, with 
their conversation eventually leading into a string of insults. Their next 
encounter was four years later in high school, with Jennifer now a 
cheerleader and Ryan the football team's mascot. </P>
<P>No matter how different Jennifer and Ryan were, their paths always seemed to 
cross, and it does again two years later when Ryan enters into the University 
of California in Berkeley, where Jennifer is a sophomore. Primarily spanning 
the first three years of Ryan's college experience, he and Jennifer gradually 
become best friends, their varying personalities a perfect fit to help each 
other out in their relationships when they most need it. Ryan is a structural 
engineering major, with his life all mapped out, whereas Jennifer is a Latin 
major with absolutely no idea how she could use such a thing to get a job in 
the future. Jennifer is afraid of commitment because of all of the times she 
has been burned by guys, while Ryan just wants someone who he can love 
unconditionally, and who is right for him. What isn't clear to Jennifer, 
however, is that the one that could really make her truly happy is right in 
front of her--the kind of guy who could be the love of her life, as well as 
her dearest friend.</P>
<P>"Boys and Girls" is predictable, but that is to be expected. What does come 
as a surprise is how much this Generation X and Y-aimed comedy-drama has in 
common with Woody Allen's films, most notably 1977's "Annie Hall." Despite 
the advertising campaign that makes "Boys and Girls" appear to be an ensemble 
picture, the film is essentially a two-character show, with Freddie Prinze, 
Jr. and Claire Forlani taking up almost all the screentime. All supporting 
characters are purposefully inconsequential catalysts that aid in taking Ryan 
and Jennifer through the journey that inevitably brings the two together. 
This style of storytelling works because it adds a layer of realism to the 
proceedings, where people can come in and out of your life before you have 
time to stop and realize it.</P>
<P>Besides the aforementioned Prinze, Jr., Claire Forlani (1998's "Meet Joe 
Black") surpasses the unextraordinary material to bring Jennifer an added 
dimension I suspect wasn't present in the screenplay, by "The Drews." Forlani 
is the type of classy actress you would never associate with teen movies, but 
here she is, in a role that is admittedly unlike any she has taken on before. 
Together, Prinze, Jr. and Forlani make for an appealing couple with not a lot 
of fiery chemistry, but delightful as close buddies.</P>
<P>While Jason Biggs (1999's "American Pie") has been highly touted in the ads 
for "Boys and Girls," he is not onscreen nearly as much as you would be led 
to believe. As Hunter, Ryan's girl-crazy, compulsively-lying roommate, Biggs 
is the comic relief of the film, and is well-cast. The same goes for Amanda 
Detmer (2000's "Final Destination"), as Jennifer's socially inept friend, 
Amy, who relies on a therapist to make the brunt of her decisions. Detmer 
brings added energy to her scenes, and is a likable presence throughout. </P>
<P>In a return to the big screen after her stunning debut in last year's "The 
Blair Witch Project," Heather Donahue is very funny as Megan, Ryan's 
straightforward girlfriend who approaches him about going out and makes it 
clear that "I always zoom in on what I want." Donahue is only in a few 
scenes, but makes a lasting impression, causing you to wish she could have 
garnered more to work with. Finally, Alyson Hannigan (1999's "American Pie") 
and musical artist Monica Arnold briefly appear in cameos as, respectively, 
Ryan's high school sweetheart and one of Hunter's fleeting flings.</P>
<P>At times a bit overly talky, and oddly feeling as if it might have been 
better equipped as a stage play, "Boys and Girls" is, nonetheless, a 
well-made romance that may not always work, but is appreciatively 
overambitious in its ideas about relationships and the opposite sex. It's 
better to aim high and only occasionally achieve its goals, I think, rather 
than merely accepting the bare minimum in character and story 
developments--something the majority of so-called "teen" films fall right 
into the trap of, without looking back.</P>
