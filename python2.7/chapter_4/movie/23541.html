<PRE>                            THE NINTH GATE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Roman Polanski cryptically brings the
          novel EL CLUB DUMAS by Arturo Perez-Reverte to the
          screen.  He adds to the story a supernatural
          element, but hardly enough to make this interesting
          as a horror film.  The film shows potential but
          little real value ever comes out of it.  Perhaps
          Polanski does not know what are his most horrifying
          images.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Take a Sherlock Holmes story and set it in the Middle Ages at a
monastery and you have IN THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  Tell the story that
way, and the unfamiliar trimmings will have some interest and you can
give new life to what might otherwise be a tired plot.  Far too much of
THE NINTH GATE is hard-boiled detective story in the Sam Spade
tradition, but sprinkled with trimmings from the rare book trade.
Supposedly the novel on which THE NINTH GATE is based has almost no
supernatural element and Polanski emphasized the little that was there.
But take the supernatural out of this film and you have warmed over
Dashiell Hammett.  Late in this long film the greatly amplified
supernatural element becomes more important, but its contribution is of
too little interest too late.</P>
<P>     Johnny Depp plays antiquarian book dealer Dean Corso, a wheeler-
dealer with few scruples.  In marked contrast to the passion his
customers have for books, Corso treats books like stocks, buying and
selling them like pork belly futures.  Corso is hired by Boris Balkan
(Frank Langella doing a Fritz Weaver impression) a well-known collector
of books on witchcraft and demonology.  Balkan has recently purchased
or stolen a Necronomicon-like book, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of
the Shadows."  Whether the book was bought or stolen will not be
determined since the previous owner, Andrew Telfer, committed suicide
once the book was out of his hands.  There are thought to be only three
copies of this book: Balkan's, one in Portugal, and one in France.  But
Balkan knows that even that number is not correct.  There is only one
copy and the other two are frauds.  Balkan hires Corso to compare his
copy with the other two copies and determine which is the original.</P>
<P>     Before leaving for Europe Corso pays a visit to Liana Telfer (Lena
Olin), widow of Andrew.  She claims that the book belonged to her and
by rights it still does.  Corso heads for Europe.  He quickly discovers
that there are people trying to kill him and get Balkan's copy of the
book.  He also has acquired a sort of mysterious guardian who protects
him in time of danger.  She is an attractive blond (Emmanuelle Seigner)
with a mean kick-boxing style.  Corso has no idea who she is or why she
protects him.</P>
<P>     Roman Polanski has taken a rather complex and mystical novel,
increased the emphasis on the supernatural, and changed a number of
things around.  By dropping the entire Alexander Dumas subplot, for
which the book was named, he has freed up characters to be redefined
for his new plot.  Some of Polanski's seem just to be testing the
medium.  He has a completely gratuitous special effect in that two
twins on the screen together are played by a single actor.  The
conclusion of the film is markedly different from the book.  The
mysticism that suffuses the film seems completely artificial, a long
way from Polanski's best work.  Part of the problem is that he seems to
have lost his way in understanding where true horror lies.  Certainly
there are Polanski films that are horrifying.  But in ROSEMARY'S BABY
the ceremonial Satanism only worked because it was the late 1960s and
people were open to really weird ideas.  It was the situation of
Rosemary being entrapped where the film's punch can still be felt.  In
this film he builds to a horror that seems cliched and uninteresting,
like a spook in a sheet.  He breezes right past the films only scene of
true horror.  That was at the beginning of the film and involved a
stroke victim.</P>
<P>     Polanski filmed THE NINTH GATE entirely in Europe.  He had to
recreate New York City much as Kubrick had to in EYES WIDE SHUT, though
presumably he did it more economically.  For this and other reasons
this film seems at least superficially a companion film to Kubrick's
last film.  However, Kubrick brought his film to a conclusion while
Polanski ends his film just short of telling us what it all means.
Even when you find out what is happening you do not know what is
happening.  After 132 minutes it seems there should be more we know.
It is the difference between serving a feast or just tantalizing the
audience with one.  I rate THE NINTH GATE 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
