<P>PICTURE PERFECT -- a film review by Justin K. Siegel</P>
<PRE>Oh no, this was a chick flick!</PRE>
<P>Of course I knew this going in. Why is it that whenever a TV-star
makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy, and then they say on
Entertainment Tonight or something, that they were "attracted to the
characters. They were really original."</P>
<P>Original?! Let me give you a run-through of PICTURE PERFECT: Character
A) Kate (Jennifer Aniston, from tv's FRIENDS), a smart, beautiful,
professional woman wants two things she can't have: a new job-title
and the love of her co-worker Kevin Bacon. Her boss will only give her
the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a
German sportscar, and Kevin Bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved
girls. WHat does she do?  She invents a fiance! Then when everyone
wants to meet him, she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding
that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a
company dinner, and pick a fight with her at the end, thus breaking
the engagement but still being able to keep her job, since the guy
ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor, defenceless
female. He, of course, goes along with it.</P>
<P>Gee, I wonder if they get together in the end. I've seen more original
stuff on the WB.  And better stuff too. PICTURE PERFECT also makes the
mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes, and expecting us
to like Aniston's character, who comes off as a cold, spoiled bitch.</P>
<PRE>This was a chick flick!</PRE>
<PRE>D+ (report card)                # (out of 10)                * ½ (0 to ****)</PRE>
