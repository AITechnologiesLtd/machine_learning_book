<P>Angelina Jolie plays the most interesting character in Playing by
Heart, a young woman named Joan.  In the first scene of the film, she
says, "Talking about love is like dancing about architecture."  The
title of this film was, in fact, Dancing about Architecture.  I can't
imagine why anyone wanted to change it, for the previous title is far
more interesting and memorable than the current one.  In addition, the
first and last scenes require the original title to make sense.  But the
quote still sums up the film effectively:  Playing by Heart is a story
about a bunch of people who really aren't good at talking about love.  </P>
<P>Writer/director Willard Carroll has created a nice romantic comedy
here; he uses the standard Robert Altman approach, which consists of
attacking the audience with as many scenarios as it can handle, until
the very end, at which point he tells us how they're all related and why
any of it is relevant.  As with most films of numerous narratives, not
every story in Playing by Heart is successful.  But the film as a whole
is frequently both funny and moving; it's also an insightful look into
the dreaded world of dating.</P>
<P>The film focuses on a few romantic relationships, and a couple of
non-romantic relationships.  Joan -- the character I mentioned above --
is a talkative club-hopper who becomes interested in a reclusive,
blue-haired lad named Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).  Meredith (Gillian
Anderson) is a timid stage director who has turned herself off to dating
altogether, until she meets Trent (Jon Stewart), who is hell-bent on
getting her to like him.  Then there's Gracie (Madeline Stowe), a
married woman who retreats to a hotel with Roger (Anthony Edwards) a few
times a week, obsessed with the idea of having a purely sexual
relationship without any of the baggage that a normal relationship
entails.  </P>
<P>Other subplots involve an older woman, Mildred (Ellen Burstyn), who
goes to visit her dying son, Mark (Jay Mohr).  There's also Hugh (Dennis
Quaid), who is seen in various bars, picking up on both men and women,
telling them all kinds of stories about his wife and children.  The
central relationship of Playing by Heart has Sean Connery and Gena
Rowlands playing Paul and Hannah, an older couple approaching their 40th
anniversary.  Hannah discovers a picture of a woman Paul knew
twenty-five years prior, and many arguments ensue.  </P>
<P>I have a common problem with all films like this:  I tend to prefer
focused stories, and just when I'm getting drawn into a scenario, the
narrative shifts to another one and I have to recalibrate my attention. 
There is certainly enough material in each individual story to warrant
separate films, but Carroll is clearly interested in the way they
complement one another.  At first I was skeptical -- the stories didn't
seem like they needed each other.  By the end, though, I understood why
Carroll chose the stories he did.  And while no film can truly explicate
the ludicrous complications that love brings upon us, Playing by Heart
does an admirable job trying.  </P>
<P>Playing by Heart is an atmospheric film; Carroll and cinematographer
Vilmos Zsigmond did a great job filling the picture with lush moods and
velvet tones.  Trent's postmodern house -- which looks to be composed
almost entirely of 90-degree angles and black wood -- is a fascinating
location.  Thanks to production designer Missy Stewart, all the sets are
fascinatingly attractive, and well-photographed by Zsigmond.  John
Barry's musical score is also appropriate, though it does tend to get a
little heavy-handed in the later scenes.</P>
<P>What really makes Playing by Heart a memorable film are the
performances.  Angelina Jolie steals every scene she has, injecting such
indefatigable spunk and intelligence that I was electrified whenever she
appeared on screen.  Ryan Phillippe, with his unimpeachable monotony, is
appropriately dry here, and is surprisingly not buried by Jolie's work. 
Connery and Rowlands are both pros, and handle their roles accordingly. 
Also notable is the Anderson/Stewart pairing; Anderson is an immensely
likable actress, and has proven that she has range beyond her stoic
"X-Files" iciness.  Jay Mohr is affecting as the dying AIDS patient, and
Burstyn is very good as the mother.</P>
<P>Even though I often felt jostled with the transitions between stories
(Carroll really doesn't try to make the transitions smooth), I can't say
I wasn't involved in most of the stories.  There are a couple that
didn't quite work for me, though.  Even though I liked Connery and
Rowlands, I didn't always believe what they were saying -- I had trouble
believing that they loved each other.  I was also confounded by the Hugh
scenario -- Quaid doesn't seem to know exactly what he's doing, and the
situation is just too complicated for this kind of movie.  But perhaps
even these elements are intentional.  The one thing Playing by Heart
does extremely well is to show us how love is always both disastrously
complicated and inexplicably wonderful.  It sounds like a trite and
overplayed theme, but there's still some life to be found in it.</P>
