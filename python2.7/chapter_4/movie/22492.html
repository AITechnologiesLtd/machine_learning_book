<PRE>"That's no mouse, that's my brother"
Stuart Little</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A stereotypical TV-50's couple adopts an orphaned mouse to muse their seven
year old son much to the chagrin of local felines.</P>
<P>Stuart is the personification (er, ah "rat"ificaton) of the word "charm."
Though the film's plot offers nothing new and the animal speak burrow's
"Babe" technology; Stuart's charismatic presence is alluring.</P>
<P>Stuart is the action figure of our youth come alive. Every step, every bow,
every smile fills us with amusement. The plot is circumstantial, secondary.
All we need is to see Stuart drive a toy car, navigate a remote boat, or
receive a kiss from his newly adopted mom -- and we're smiling too.</P>
<P>I wasn't crazy about Nathan Lane voicing Snowbell the cat, but Monty's
voice-sake did great as well as did Stuart's. The kid was exceptional.
Lastly, the art director created a nice cartoony feel to the entire live
action backdrop.</P>
<P>I'm a huge lover of "Babe," but was a bit let down with "Babe II" ... if you
agree with that, then "Stuart Little" is kind of like a "Babe 1.5."</P>
