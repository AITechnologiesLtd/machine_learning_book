<P>Plot: When an asteroid the size of Texas is discovered nearing Earth, it 
capable of obliterating all life on the planet if it hits, NASA's only 
hope to save the world is to recruit a team of hard-headed, 
anti-authoritarian oil riggers to go up into orbit, land on the asteroid 
and drill to its core to plant and detonate a nuclear weapon to divert 
its path.</P>
<P>In the same way 1997 was dominated by twin volcano disaster movies 
(`Dante's Peak', `Volcano'), so 1998 is dominated by twin astral body 
collision disaster movies with both `Deep Impact' and `Armageddon' vying 
for our attentions. Despite the commonality of themes, both are quite 
different films - `Deep Impact' was a tepid soap opera melodrama about 
how people meet the end, while `Armageddon' is an out-and-out action 
film. A likely comparison might be between `Saving Private Ryan' and 
`The Dirty Dozen' - while both are essentially World War II mission 
movies they are told with quite opposing emphases.</P>
<P>`Armageddon' comes with an absolute determination to be as BIG as it 
possibly can. It has a reported budget of $272 million which, if 
accurate, makes it second only to `Titanic' in size. Perhaps the most 
amusing thing about the budget is that the film's advertizing campaign 
was almost as large as the actual production budget of the film itself. 
One certainly can't deny that it has been effective. One has been 
bombarded by the film's quite nifty promotional campaign for months - 
giant digital displays in theatre foyers counting down the days, minutes 
and seconds until the film's opening; posters featuring the faces of the 
principal characters plastered around the city - "He's doing it for 
heroism", "She's doing it for love". If only then there had been a film 
that had been worth such epical effort. Unlike `Titanic', which 
contradicted accusations of gross over-spending and turned it around to 
become the success story of 1997, `Armageddon' emerges as only a 
spectacular monument to its own self-promotion and self-importance over 
the provision of anything of substance.</P>
<P>Director Michael Bay's previous films - `Bad Boys' (1995) and `The Rock' 
(1996) - have been filled with gratuitous action sequences and 
`Armageddon' represents Bay's excesses at their most extravagantly 
empty-headed. The film is conceived around the provision of a series of 
dramatic peaks every ten minutes or so. But all Bay seems capable of 
doing is substituting rapid editing, explosions, flashing lights, people 
yelling orders at each other all at once, and a dramatically hyping 
musical score for any real sense of drama. Each action sequence - the 
destruction of Mir, the landing, the liftoff, the buggy jump, the meteor 
shower - is just so brainlessly empty in its absurdly over-hyped 
dramatic contrivations and so unbelieivable as realistic drama that, 
contrary to what Bay is hoping to achieve, you just sit allowing all the 
sound and fury to wash over you without even the remotest sense of 
connection. The writing is absurdly one-dimensional - Steve Buscemi has 
no purpose in the film other than to crack wry one-liners and Liv Tyler 
is there it seems simply because the film needs a female lead. It is 
hard to believe that the nuclear detonation sequence can with complete 
seriousness offer up such old hat bomb detonation cliches as people 
yelling "The red or the blue wire ?" and the digital countdown stopping 
three seconds before detonation. And despite the presensce of at least 
three scientific advisors on the credits, the film is scientifically 
preposterous - in a vacuum space shuttles conduct aerial turns like jet 
fighters; atmospheric turbulence is encountered on a slingshot around 
The Moon; gravity is inexplicably on while aboard the asteroid and Mir 
but off back aboard the shuttles; and there is a really, really 
ridiculous sequence where people are able to turn an extra-vehicular 
buggy into a flying vehicle simply by turning its gravitic stabilizers 
off.</P>
<P>It has been a long time since one has seen a film which so relentlessly 
celebrates its own brainlessness. It wants to be a film about heroism. 
Heroism here is represented by Real Men - their sweat, their stubble, 
their muscular brawn, the handsomeness of their faces is shot in 
emphatic highlight. It is clear that these are Real Men because they do 
Real Men things like ride bikes, fast cars and horses, gamble, have 
tattoos, party in stripper bars and above all never give up on a job. 
But all the heroism comes absurdly posed. The sweat and the stubble on 
the heroes all comes like it is shot for some fashion layout. The film 
wants to convince us of some triumph of working class ordinariness but 
the sheer everyman quality of its heroes is shot in such a way that it 
attracts attention to the very artificiality of the attempt to do so. </P>
<P>And what the film ends up celebrating is not so much a sense of heroism 
as an adolescent anti-authoritism. I would be greatly concerned if the 
fate of the world rested on a group of roughnecks who, among other 
things, start firing at each other with shotguns when they are annoyed; 
someone who keeps protesting "She didn't tell me her age, I swear"; and 
someone who explains their failure at psychological tests on the grounds 
they were dumped on their head as a child. Everybody on the opposite 
side of the coin to the heroes is characterized as double-dealing 
military or ineffectual because they haven't done any `real' work. In 
its opening moments the film celebrates a scene where the hero fires 
golfballs at a circling Greenpeace ship while one of his offsiders asks 
"What's wrong with drilling for oil ?" While one may not always agree 
with Greenpeace's methodology, the film's mindless celebration of 
environmental plundering on the grounds that it is a test of real men's 
courage and the characterization of protestors as worthy of contempt is 
something that verges on intolerance. Similarly the film gets a big joke 
out of putting its heroes in a position when they can give the finger to 
the government and demand they never pay taxes again - but when you see 
that all the men seem to do with their money is to blow it gambling and 
in stripper bars, you are struck less by the film's sense of the triumph 
of heroic take-no-shit individualism than you are by its sense of macho 
self-centeredness.</P>
<P>And it doesn't just stop there. It is not merely the mindless machimo of 
the heroism that sticks in one's craw, it is the mindless patriotism of 
it too. One cannot remember seeing a film before which featured so many 
shots of people posing in front of the American flag. Like `Independance 
Day' before it, this is less a film about combatting a world-threatening 
menace than it is a triumphal assertion of a belief in American identity 
and individuality. It is not merely a film about Real Men who never give 
up on a job going into space to save the world, it is about Real Men 
going to boldly assert their idea of what America is all about. All the 
heroic posing comes intercut with weightedly symbolic shots of the 
American flag and cutaways to the Iwo Jima statue and the plaques 
commemorating the sacrifices of the Apollo mission. And the background 
is filled with incredibly sentimentalized and equally posed Norman 
Rockwell-esque shots of good ordinary folk gathered around haybarns 
listening to the radio or emerging from churches in slow motion. As a 
non-American I kind of find the cultural imperialism of it all rather 
hard to take. Most unbelievable of all is the moment the American 
President goes on air to announce the launch of the mission and people 
the world over sit and listen in reverential awe, masses of Indians even 
sit in front of the Taj Mahal in prayer. Give me a break ! All of this 
in itself may have been slightly more palatable had not the heroic 
spirit of American independance that we are being asked to cheer on not 
been one that is so sophomoric and adolescent.</P>
