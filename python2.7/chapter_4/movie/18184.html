I LOVE TROUBLE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Every now and then, reviewers are faced with the films that
are hard to be properly reviewed. Most of the time it
happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact, either
good or bad, that in the end reviewers must work hard to
express his thoughts or feelings. But, sometimes it can
happen for rather trivial reasons. I LOVE TROUBLE happened
to be one of such occasions for the author of this review.
The impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the
contrary, there were hardly any impression at all, since I
had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it.
Which surprise me to this day, because the movie theatre was
full, I was close to sound speakers, the show wasn't late
and I didn't lack sleep before the show. Such things happen
very rarely to me, and, after many years, the closest thing
to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the
film itself.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around two rival Chicago reporters - old
Peter Brackett (Nick Nolte) and young, aspiring Sabrina
Peterson (Julia Roberts). Two of them are assigned to cover
the train collision. As soon as they meet, they start
scooping each other, but during the process they both
discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk, and also
the romantic feelings they have for each other. The plot in
this film is rather secondary to its real raison d'être -
romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies
starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Movie author,
director and screenwriter Charles Shyer, who had some
experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern
setting with FATHER OF THE BRIDE, tries again, this time
pairing old Nick Nolte with young Julia Roberts. However,
although there is some chemistry between the two, soon it
stops to arouse any interest. It probably happens due to
poorly executed genre mix, that collides light-hearted
romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to
pure action thrillers. Shyer as director fails to make the
proper transition between the two, and fails in both areas,
making the story cliched and predictable. The end result is
rather forgettable effort, which convinced me not to watch
movie again. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, though.</P>
