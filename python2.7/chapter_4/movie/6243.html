                     Breaking the Waves (1996)
                   A film review by Martin Rich
                    Copyright 1996 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>In the 1970s, a closed, puritan, religious community in a remote part of
Scotland is transformed by the arrival of oil-workers from around the
world.  A young local woman falls in love with, and marries, a Norwegian
oil worker against the advice of the elders of the community.</P>
<P>Lars von Trier's film, Breaking the Waves, is the story of what happened
to this marriage - the husband is injured and, at his behest, his wife
searches for other men to have sex with.  Superficially this is a slight
story, but it has been made into an epic and powerful film.  Many of the
images are uncomfortable, especially of the stifling effect of the
closed community, and the ability of the village's elders to hurt a
family by ostracising its members.  If you are prepared for these
images, it is an excellent film which certainly deserves the awards that
it has received.</P>
<P>The styles of the 1970s were characterised by browns and oranges, and
the cinematography in 'Breaking the Waves' gives the scenery an orange
tint that somehow seems appropriate to the era.  Bess, the central
character played by Emily Watson, and Jan the husband played by Stellan
Skarsgaard, appear in the fashions of the 1970s and are in stark
contrast to other villagers whose appearance and lifestyle seem to have
changed little with the centuries.</P>
<P>Between the chapters there are short, beautiful, still shots of the
Scottish scenery, accompanied by music from the 1970s.  Between these
interludes there is little music - conveying the atmosphere of a place
where even the church bells have been removed because they are deemed
unnecessary.</P>
<P>The film is about the effect of an oppressive society, and about the
difficulties of a troubled person in finding a way to live their life. 
These difficulties are most graphically expressed in Bess's curious
dialogues with God, where she speaks both parts and is tortured by
whether her every move is going to earn God's favour.  It isn't
anti-religious, but condemns such a dour expression of religion that can
sentence a woman to silence because she dares to speak in church, and
allows its elders to consign a dead person to hell at their funeral.</P>
<P>Emily Watson's performance is remarkable for her range of emotion, and
her ability to convey the turmoil beneath a troubled exterior.  Also
very fine is the performance by Adrian Rawlins as the English doctor,
unfamiliar with the ways of the community, whose reaction to Bess moves
from professional concern, to support, to pure frustration.</P>
<P>It's rarely comfortable viewing, but an exceptional film nonetheless</P>
