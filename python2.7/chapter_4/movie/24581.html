<PRE>The Big Kahuna
Directed by:  John Swanbeck
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Pete Facinelli
Running time:  90 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  **1/2</PRE>
<P>Larry (Spacey) and Phil (DeVito) are salesmen for an industrial
lubricants company.  They are hosting a hospitality suite at a 
convention and they desperately need to make contact with a
potential customer, the big kahuna of the title.  With them is Bob 
(Facinelli) who is from the engineering department and there to
be the technical guy and mostly to tend bar. Unfortunately, Larry
and Phil miss the big customer, but Bob talks to him and gets an
invitation to a private party afterwards.  For Larry and Phil this
is the big chance and maybe their last chance.</P>
<P>By their nature, good salesmen must be good psychologists.  And
Larry and Phil reveal that they know a lot about human nature.  We
learn this as they analyze each other for Bob's benefit and even
more so as they start to analyze Bob's motives.  </P>
<P>All this talk is very interesting and I'm sure the play the film
is based on is very good.  But the movie is claustrophobic (with a
few short exceptions it takes place in one small room) and it fails
to make us interested in any of the characters with the exception
of Phil.  The writing reminds one of Mamet, but second rate Mamet.
And the acting, with the exception of DeVito who seems to find 
some depth in his character, is two dimensional.</P>
<P>Spacey is a hot commodity these days and this film is getting a lot
of hype.  Don't be fooled.  </P>
