<P>If any lessons can be derived from "The Cider House Rules," one is
that a film can be damaged by trying too hard for Oscar
nominations. The other is that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &
Sciences are a bunch of suckers.  It's not hard to see how this
average film was able to fool the Academy into handing it no less than
seven nominations: "The Cider House Rules" is a slow, quiet,
historical film that contains abortion, a "controversial" topic, as a
major theme. It possesses all the aspects of an Important Film and
constantly pushes on you the idea that it is a supremely Important
movie. That, of course, is precisely the problem with "The Cider House
Rules." Not one moment goes by without the film informing us on how
much we should all marvel at just how Important what we are watching
really is.  Too bad "The Cider House Rules," despite being a
relentlessly Important film, has neither the narrative flow nor the
thematic substance to qualify as truly Important. It's mostly
well-made and good-looking, and it's also mostly empty.</P>
<P>Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is an orphan nobody was able to
permanently adopt. Brought up at the St. Cloud's Orphanage in a small
Maine town, Homer is told by his keeper, the kindly Dr. Wilbur Larch
(Michael Caine), that if he's going to stay there, he ought to "be of
use." So Dr. Larch teaches Homer the skills of a doctor: learning to
deliver babies and care for and comfort the mothers. Homer, however,
refuses to take on one of Dr.  Larch's duties -- performing
abortions. Dr. Larch has no qualms about it; he performs them because
he doesn't want back-alley abortionists killing pregnant women, but
Homer refuses on the grounds that abortions are illegal (or were, in
the late 1930's). When Homer grows older, he longs to see the world
beyond the orphanage, and his chance comes when an air force pilot
named Wally (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron)
come in for an abortion. Homer asks to leave with them over
Dr. Lester's objections, and Wally agrees to take him. Homer then
proceeds to get a job on Wally's family's apple farm, where he meets
the head of the apple pickers, a large black man called Mr. Rose
(Delroy Lindo) and his daughter Rose (Erykah Badu), and also strikes
up a romantic relationship with Candy after her boyfriend once again
departs for war. Thrown out into the real world, Homer learns that
issues of morality are perhaps not quite so clear-cut as he thought
they were.</P>
<P>There are things to like about "The Cider House Rules." The actors,
for example: Maguire has an almost uncanny leading-man presence about
him, in that he doesn't immediately grab a viewer or even do much of
anything to garner attention, but it's somehow difficult to ignore
him. His understated calm and thoughtful eyes are well-suited to the
character of Homer, who must work out difficult moral issues without
breaking an externally tranquil demeanor. Charlize Theron is fine as
his love interest; with an actress like her, it's not hard to see why
Homer takes a liking to Candy. The interplay between the two, with
Candy aloofly refusing to make a decision while Homer presses her for
one, is one of the most interesting aspects of the film.  Michael
Caine and Delroy Lindo give powerful turns as two of Homer's father
figures, both noble but flawed men. Caine's New Englander accent is
for the most part believable, though he tends to stress his R's a bit
too much (a common problem for British actors playing
American). Singer Erykah Badu is remarkably unglamorous and
surprisingly touching in a pivotal role.</P>
<P>John Irving adapted his own novel in writing the screenplay for "The
Cider House Rules," so it's not hard to figure out why the film feels
as if it's been gloriously over-stuffed. This being an Important Film
written by an author who apparently couldn't bear to let one bit of
his book be left out, we get one of the worst examples of
"kitchen-sink" filmmaking this side of Oliver Stone (Lasse
HallstrF6m's relatively restrained direction notwithstanding). Irving
seemingly isn't content to merely deal with the supremely thorny issue
of abortion; we must also get, in order, orphans, dying children,
dying mothers, drug addiction, adultery, incest, and suicide. When the
film finally pulled out (I kid you not) a crippled war veteran,
Irving's emotional manipulation had reached its nadir. Playing with an
audience's emotions is one thing, but does it have to be drummed in
with a sledgehammer? I was with the film through many of its jumps
through sentimental hoops, but by the final reel, it had lost me. Plot
developments that could have been affecting were now merely grating,
not to mention convenient.</P>
<P>Furthermore, for all the film's posturing about being a frank and open
debate about abortion, the subject is given no more than a superficial
gloss-over by Irving. It does deliver a fairly strong argument in
favor of legalizing abortion (or keeping it legal in the contemporary
sense): Dr.  Larch clearly explains his position, that he performs
abortions so they will be done properly and in a sanitary
environment. That's fine, but Homer's great "objection" to the
practice is little more than a peep about it being illegal, and Irving
eventually negates that argument by introducing the idea of making
one's own decisions, regardless of what the law may dictate (as in the
rules posted in the cider house, which are routinely broken by the
farm workers). Where is the counter-argument, the one pro-lifers
consistently spout about protecting life? The film is most definitely
not an even-handed treatment of the subject, but rather an obvious
pro-choice diatribe.  This critic isn't even a pro-life advocate; I
actually tend to fall in the pro-choice camp, but I also recognize
that an argument is made stronger by acknowledging the opposing
viewpoint. "The Cider House Rules" barely does, and Homer's eventual
decision to perform an abortion in the case of incest (which he never
had a problem with anyway) doesn't force him or the film to take a
definite stand on the issue one way or the other. This is a perfectly,
infuriatingly safe way to deal with an issue, and one as controversial
as abortion deserved better.</P>
<P>Irving's screenplay is a perfect example of why keeping film
adaptations faithful to their source material is not necessarily a
good idea.  Several things here almost certainly worked better on
paper than on screen, such as the double-pronged storytelling that
keeps frustratingly cutting back to the orphanage when we ought to be
caught up in Homer's travels. "The Cider House Rules" isn't a bad film
-- it's far too crisply-made and nicely-acted for that. Toss in some
beautiful New England scenery and economic direction, and you're
pretty much assured that it will at least be a pleasing trip. But
those looking for something a little more substantial will be
disappointed, and certainly we ought to expect more out of our Best
Picture nominees.  Sadly, "The Cider House Rules" isn't quite the
Important Film it wants to be. There is no narrative or thematic
consistency to it; the film never takes a definite course. As a
picture that deals with some morally thorny issues, this one stays
relentlessly safe, and irritatingly aloof from its subject matter,
which all adds up to a great deal of emptiness when the end credits
roll: We realize that "The Cider House Rules" was a good-looking,
well-acted film about nothing in particular.</P>
