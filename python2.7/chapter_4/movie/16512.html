<PRE>PLAYING BY HEART (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong and Joyce Kong

<P>With thousands, perhaps millions, of scripts flying around Hollywood for a
script to be produced there needs to be an ingenious twist. Playing By
Heart has one of these ingenious twist to it. If I reveal it, it'll spoil
the film.</P>
<P>Playing By Heart starts off spinning threads of stories with many different
characters. Unlike the film I saw last week, The Thin Red Line, where too
many characters killed the film, Playing By Heart uses the abundant amount
of characters to draw us in. At its heart, the movie is a series of
blossoming relationships. The film focuses on the stories of four women
known only by their first names. Meredith (Gillian Anderson), Joan
(Angelina Jolie), Gracie (Madeleine Stowe), and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) are
the women that the story focuses on.</P>
<P>Meredith is being pursued by an architect, Trent (Jon Stewart). Joan is
pursuing a man that she met at a dance club, Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).
Gracie is having an affair with a man (Anthony Edwards). And Hannah is
trying to straighten up a marriage with her husband of 40 years, Paul (Sean
Connery). There is also a story line about a dying man (Jay Mohr) and his
reconciling with his mother.</P>
<P>What I like about the script by Willard Carroll is that it is able to keep
us interested in almost all of these stories and he does it in such a way
that we are rewarded at the end of the film. Sure, a bit of it is quite
predictable, but that was part of the fun of watching this film. There is
one story line that didn't really fit well, or was not as interesting as it
could have been, and that was Gracie's story line. But, that is a small
complaint about a well-written script. Kudos to Carroll for putting
together a fun script. Carroll also takes up the directing duties with
Playing By Heart and does well at it also.</P>
<P>The performances to look for, and there are lots because of the ensemble
cast, are Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, Gena Rowlands, and Sean
Connery. It was nice to see Anderson do something substantial that has
nothing to do with aliens or government conspiracies. I love her as Agent
Scully, but it is great to see Anderson expanding her horizons and taking
other roles. Jolie does well, she has almost the same role as she did in
Hackers, but this time around the role is softer and requires more emotion.
Jolie handles it well. Rowlands who was the standout performance in Hope
Floats turns in a wonderful performance in Playing By Heart. And Connery,
who seems to be doing a lot more low profile roles, is marvelous in this
film. It was disappointing to see him in the awful Avengers and this role
is more than enough to help me forget about his performance in Avengers.</P>
<P>Playing By Heart is one of those low profile films that get released
without a lot of push from the studios and may get lost in the shuffle.
But, I enjoyed the film immensely and left the theatre with a smile. Don't
Miss Playing By Heart in the theatres. And let me know if by the end of the
film you have all the threads connected. I was able to guess most of them,
but missed on big one.</P>
<P>[Rated R for some sexuality and language. Running Time: 121 Minutes]</P>
