Re #7 "A Night at the Opera"</P>
<P>Continuing with the "movie list," here is number seven of the 
ten films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite
films. They are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest 
influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are 
favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again, which you 
can tell as you read each entry. Try to think of your own 
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of 
your life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you 
live it, to know how things such as books and films and magazine 
articles alter your path in significant ways. Sometime last year 
the Sunday NYTimes "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how 
difficult it is to think of a movie that may have changed 
history. The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK. How silly. Each of the ten films listed here 
changed my history, and if I had not seen them, I would not 
have helped change history in the ways that I have. Films don't 
move masses. They move individuals who move masses.</P>
<P>7. "A Night at the Opera" (1935) This Marx Brothers picture was 
made the year before I was born, but I discovered it via my 
Uncle Vince, my mother's younger brother, the same fellow who 
introduced me to baseball, chess, classical music and a lot to 
do with politics. He was a left-winger who never quite forgave 
me for becoming a Republican. In my teenage years, the humor of
the Marx Brothers absolutely convulsed me. I could not get 
enough of it after seeing this first of several the boys 
produced. My closest friend, Leslie Nathanson, and I would get 
the NYTimes to see where in the city a theater was playing a 
Marx Brothers film. I remember trekking from Borough Park in 
Brooklyn to 96th Street in Manhattan one Saturday, and literally 
rolling in the aisle with laughter. I've seen all the films a 
dozen times, but the "Night at the Opera" -- with Harpo suddenly 
selling peanuts and popcorn down the aisle of the Met, while the 
orchestra broke out into "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" -- was 
the craziest of all. Bob Bartley, editor of The Wall Street 
Journal, once told me I had taught him "the art of the 
outrageous" in presenting editorials traditionally written with
lofty pomposity. It was Groucho, Chico and Harpo who taught me.</P>
