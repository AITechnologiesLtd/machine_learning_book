Susan Granger's review of "WOMAN ON TOP" (Fox Searchlight Pictures)</PRE>
<P>  Spanish star Penelope Cruz is as intoxicating as Brazilian
bossa-nova rhythms in Fina Torres's wannabe "Like Water for Chocolate"
that also uses cooking as a metaphor for passionate romance. As
Isabella, she's both cursed and blessed. She's cursed with severe
motion sickness that forces her to be "in control" of her movement -
driving, dancing and being on top when she makes love. Yet she's
blessed with culinary genius, working as chef in a small seaside
restaurant owned by her mucho-macho musician husband, Toninho (Murilo
Benicio). But when she catches him in bed with another woman, she
flees Bahia, seeking solace with her childhood friend, a transvestite
(Harold Perrineau, Jr.) in San Francisco, where she's "discovered" by
a TV producer (Mark Feuerstein) and becomes the sultry star of a local
cooking show. Meanwhile, despondent Toninho is determined to win her
back. So much for story. It's charismatic Penelope Cruz that
fascinates. Curiously, she's not a traditional beauty; her thin nose
is far too long. But she's stunning, radiant and utterly compelling,
particularly when she sways to Luis Bacalov's Latino score. On the
other hand, Vera Blasi's flimsy plot goes beyond disbelief, needing
far too much voice-over narration. And Fina Torres' clumsy attempt at
magical realism cannot compare with Alfonso Arau ("Like Water For
Chocolate"), even with Thierry Arbogast's caressing
cinematography. Aside from Murilo Benicio's realization that, without
his wife, his life is barren, there is no character
development. Harold Perrineau Jr. serves as comic relief, and Mark
Feuerstein's fumbling ineptitude grows cloying quickly. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Woman on Top" is a frothy, sensuous 6, as
ephemeral and enchanting as the aromas that waft from Isabella's
cuisine.</P>
