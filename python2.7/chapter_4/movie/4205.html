<PRE>                               NOW AND THEN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     In a few respects, NOW AND THEN, is much like Rob Reiner's STAND
BY ME.  It is about four youngsters (age twelve) and their friendship.
The big excitement is that they are seeking to find out how Johnny, a
friend their age, died.  The part I enjoyed was that it was about
girls whereas STAND BY ME was about boys.  For a change, the girls are
given the chance to show they can act.</P>
<P>     Sadly, unlike the excellent STAND BY ME, not much else good can be
said about this film.  The girls meet at night at the cemetery where
the boy Johnny is buried.  This, in itself, is an unlikely scenario.  I
could be wrong but it strikes me as very contrived to have the girls
visit a cemetery at night. There they pledge to always be friends and
never lose track of each other.</P>
<P>     The film's title derives from the story about how the young girls
were THEN and what they turn out to be NOW.  Samantha as a young girl
is played by Gaby Hoffmann with Demi Moore as the adult, a novelist.
Teeny is played by Thora Birch and Melanie Griffith who becomes a
successful movie actress.  Christina DeWitt is played by Ashleigh Aston
Moore and Rita Wilson who becomes a housewife and has a child.
Christina Ricci and Rosie O'Donnell star as Roberta who becomes a
doctor.</P>
<P>     Flashbacks keep us informed about the "Then" and the "Now" but
nothing very interesting happens in the film.  The fine cast, all good
actors, are wasted on an uninteresting story where you find that you do
not really care what happens to them.  While some of the kids look
like they could look something like the grownups they are supposed to
eventually be, Christina Ricci looks nothing like Rosie O'Donnell.  The
big news is that Demi Moore is never nude in the film.   Is that a
first or isn't it?</P>
