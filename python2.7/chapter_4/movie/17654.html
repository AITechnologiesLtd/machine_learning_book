      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   If one only considers their excellent previous film, the taut,
   intensely-plotted lesbians-versus-the-mob caper picture BOUND, there
   would appear to be little to connect the Wachowski Brothers with the
   dazzling futuristic thriller THE MATRIX, but when taking into account
   their background as Chicago-based comic book writers, the picture
   quickly clears.  Wildly imaginative and visually frenetic, THE MATRIX
   is essentially a sensational live-action comic book put to celluloid,
   and reaches spectacular new heights for this film genre.</P>
<P>   Already filmmakers of particular distinction on the basis of their
   attention-grabbing debut picture, THE MATRIX cements the reputation
   of Larry and Andy Wachowski as first-rate visual stylists who know
   how to make every shot count.  Thanks to the bravura work by
   cinematographer Bill Pope, who shoots the dark picture with an
   appealing glossy sheen, this is a fabulous-looking movie, rich in
   fantastic art design and employing groundbreaking visual technology
   which, in the hands of visual effects director John Gaeta, result in
   some truly stunning visceral sequences which overload the cool
   quotient.</P>
<P>   As incredible as the film is simply to look at, it's bolstered by an
   elaborately-constructed story spanning time and reality, with
   elements as disparate as mythology and Lewis Carroll factoring
   prominently into the tale in surprisingly cohesive fashion.  (The
   Wachowskis are so thorough in regards to the latter that not only are
   there overt "Alice In Wonderland" and "Through The Looking Glass"
   references, in one scene they even playfully threw footage of
   scampering rabbits on a background TV set.)  Given that one of the
   joys of the picture is to unweave its unusually well-developed
   storyline (and that promotional teasers are intentionally vague),
   suffice it to say that THE MATRIX initially tantalizes through
   deliberately-oblique scenes which intrigue, leaving gaping holes
   without trying our patience, and eventually reveals itself to be a
   futuristic Things Are Not What They Seem To Be variant, with a ragtag
   group of survivors including the zen-like Morpheus (Lawrence
   Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) recruiting computer hacker
   Neo (Keanu Reeves) to help save the world.  It's comic book mentality
   run amok, more ambitious than it perhaps ought to be, but it's far
   more consistent and better realised than the similarly-styled THE
   FIFTH ELEMENT.</P>
<P>   Aside from the flashy, hyperkinetic camerawork, the film
   distinguishes itself through its arresting action sequences.  The
   Wachowskis were clearly influenced by John "More Bullets" Woo, and
   the picture's gunfire battles, especially one involving Neo and
   Trinity pinned down in the lobby of an office building by the
   sinister Agents, are spectacular -- the best in any American action
   picture since, not coincidentally, Woo's own FACE/OFF.  As the
   steaming spent shell cases rain down in slow motion and marble
   pillars are pulverized in the frenzy of ammunition, it's an
   adrenaline thrill to watch the heroic characters performing
   impossibly evasive gymnastic stuntwork amidst the cheerfully wanton
   violence. The martial arts fight sequences are similarly jaw-dropping
   and almost certainly the best to ever come from a North American
   film.  Impressively choreographed by Hong Kong stunt master Yuen Wo
   Ping and vastly energetic, the wired hand-to-hand combat in
   conjunction with the energized camerawork produce such eye-popping
   results that they appear to be straight out of video games and
   Japanese anime, showcasing limitless flexibility of the combatants in
   terms of speed and fluid airborne motion.  Through it all, the actors
   are imbued with a glamorous cool chic, adorning ultra-hip
   black-dominated apparel with the requisite sunglasses; this is a
   picture which not only looks great, but where it's also crucial to
   look great.</P>
<P>   The film also sounds terrific due to stellar sound work by David
   Lee, who captures each squib with precision, and through the
   fierce score by Don Davis (who's assisted by a top-notch rock
   soundtrack featuring the likes of Rage Against The Machine and
   Prodigy).  From top to bottom, THE MATRIX is a technically superb
   accomplishment.</P>
<P>   With the riveting imagery on display in the picture, the best that
   the actors can hope to fare is to avoid being overwhelmed by the
   visuals, and they're largely up to the challenge.  While Reeves and
   Fishburne acquit themselves admirable in the physical aspects of
   their roles, the actors who leave the greatest impression are Moss,
   whose commanding presence as a leather-clad warrior reminded me of
   Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in BATMAN RETURNS and Famke Janssen's
   lethal Xenia Onatopp from GOLDENEYE and who tackles her intense
   action sequences with a ferocious vigor, and veteran Australian
   actor Hugo Weaving as the menacing Agent Smith, who has a wonderfully
   flat, dispassionate delivery, speaking his lines without really
   moving his lips.</P>
<P>   While THE MATRIX has its share of flaws -- its coda is far less
   inventive than the rest of the picture, the laboured love story plays
   as if it was tossed in as a concession, the zen dialogue often feels
   like third-rate Yodaisms, and the Cypher character (Wachowski regular
   Joe Pantoliano) tips his hand far too early -- it's still a wild ride
   with much more interesting writing than per the norm.  The film isn't
   as provocative as it's likely meant to be, but it ably takes the
   audience into a memorable world with unprecedented dazzling visuals.
   "Whoa," whispers an amazed Neo during one scene; it's also the effect
   which THE MATRIX leaves.</P>
