<P>     Finally.  The GOODFELLAS gang (Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pilegii,
Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci) reunites for this stunning, yet demanding
story of mob interests in 1970's Las Vegas.  Based on Pilegii's non-
fiction book, CASINO is the story of bookie-turned-casino boss Sam "Ace"
Rothstein (De Niro).  He's the brains behind the operation of the
Tangiers Hotel and Casino, who, along with problem pal Nicky Santoro
(Pesci), works to keep the cash flowing back to the Midwestern mob
bosses.</P>
<P>     Despite the prickly prospects of the subject matter--as well as a
177-minute running time--the first hour of CASINO is nothing short of
incredible.  The story opens with an extended introduction into casino
management and the mob ties therein.  Every conceivable base is covered
as Pesci and De Niro narrate over a steady stream of oldies, while
Scorsese's camera stays in constant motion through quick cut after cut
after cut.  It's a great start that slows, somewhat, in the second hour.</P>
<P>     With the introduction of Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), a Vegas
vamp who ends up holding "Ace's" ace, the narrative becomes more
conventional.  No problem.  Stone proves up to the task of the excep- 
tionally demanding role, though her cool chemistry with costar De Niro
is muted and often difficult to read.  In fact, one could argue that,
even though it's a dramatic portend to later events, her entire subplot
could be easily excised without any noticeable reduction to the overall
structure, or emotion, of the story.</P>
<P>     If De Niro and Stone are both a bit distant, Pesci is right there.
He's the actor with the most fire, even if he's playing awfully close to
his Oscar-winning role from GOODFELLAS.  (Anyone for a tally of how
often Pesci says the f-word?  Or how many cigs De Niro smokes?) Backing
the big three is a shrewd supporting cast that includes James Woods,
Alan King, Kevin Pollock, and a serious Don Rickles.  (The funny Don
Rickles can be heard in TOY STORY, also opening this week.)</P>
<P>     The third, and final hour of CASINO lacks something.  As each of
the characters close on their grim, inescapable outcomes, there's
neither a rush, nor a relief at the end.  No overt emotion for the
viewer other than, perhaps, horror at the grisly fates suffered by some.
(Hint:  you'll be taking back junior's baseball-bat Christmas present
after watching this one.) The beginning may be a blast, but the ending
is nothing special.  CASINO just ends; and that's that.</P>
<P>     Technical credits are easily some of the best of the year.  Dante
Ferretti's eye-popping production design is a winner, as are Rita Ryack
and John Dunn's fine, period costumes.  Great soundtrack, too.  Such a
sumptuous production. I can't wait to see it again.</P>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  Scorsese.  Casual viewers beware.</P>
