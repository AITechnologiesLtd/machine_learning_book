<PRE>ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL'S
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In Harald Zwart's film noir comedy, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL'S, Liv Tyler 
plays a Lauren Bacall-type character known as Jewel Valentine.  Jewel is 
a scam artist who steals men's hearts and homes.  With wonderfully 
revealing dresses -- too revealing in the case of her surprisingly 
knobby knees -- she takes men's breath away.  The camera has a love 
affair with her as well, pausing to soak up her reflected beauty 
whenever she enters a new man's life.  The picture's most memorable 
sequence has her washing her car like a sex toy in something 
approximating a clothed version of a Playboy video.  Water, she 
confides, is her second favorite thing in the world.  The men are 
absolutely delighted to find out what's number one on her hit parade.</P>
<P>The story is told from the differing perspectives of three of the many 
males who orbit around her as their sexual sun.  Each of them tells 
their story in flashback to someone else.  The main story concerns a 
bartender aptly named Randy (Matt Dillon), a happy-go-lucky sort who 
thinks he has gone to heaven when he first spies Jewel in a tart red 
dress.  Randy tells his tale of woe at a cheap bingo parlor to a sleazy 
man named Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas looking like Joe Pesci having 
a very bad hair day).  Douglas's bouffant beehive turns out to be the 
funniest part of the picture.</P>
<P>Randy's cousin Carl (Paul Reiser), a cocksure lawyer who brags to 
everyone he meets that he is a partner in the second biggest law firm in 
the state, tells his story to his new psychiatrist (Reba McEntire).  An 
obnoxious married man with two kids, he thinks that he is irresistible 
to females.</P>
<P>Finally, a love-struck Detective Dehling (John Goodman) confesses his 
transgressions to an almost panting Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins) who 
drinks out of the communion chalice while hearing all of the sordid 
details of the detective's trysts.  When the detective isn't pining for 
Jewel, he investigates the murders that keep cropping up around her.</P>
<P>Although the movie does have its moments, it is an uneven and fairly 
forgettable comedy that produces only sporadic laughter.  There's no 
reason to see it, but, if you do go, you'll probably have a decent time.  
Whatever you do, don't make a trip to the concession stand until you've 
enjoyed the car wash sequence.</P>
<P>ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL'S runs 1:33.  It is rated R for violence, sexuality 
and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
