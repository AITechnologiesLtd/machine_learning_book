<PRE>**** out of four</PRE>
<PRE>"Fear Thy Neighbor"</PRE>
<P>Starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope David, Joan Cusack. Rated R.</P>
<P>As I write this, nearly two days after the screening, Arlington Road is
still a haunting and vivid image in my memory. I suspect it will stay
with me for some time. Director Mark Pellington delivers one of the
scariest, smartest, most daring thrillers I've seen in recent memory, a
thoughtful yet horrifyingly intense meditation on human nature.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges, who has shown his remarkable versatility as an actor with
his roles in The Big Lebowski and now this, stars as Michael Faraday, a
jittery man who teaches a class on terrorism at a local university. His
wife, an FBI agent, died a few years prior because the Bureau gave her
faulty information on a terrorist suspect. He now lives with his son
and, on occasion, his girlfriend (Hope Davis).</P>
<P>Across the street from them live five seemingly ordinary people: Oliver
and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, respectively) with their
three children. At first, Michael tries to be friendly, frequently
visiting and assuring that his kid interacts with theirs. But it isn't
long before he starts noticing strange things around their household:
suspicious blueprints, strange mail and other extraordinary goings-on.
Soon, Faraday launches a one man investigation into Oliver Lang's past,
finding out that he changed his name to the name of the person who died
the day before and that he was caught up in a pipe bomb incident at the
tender age of 16.</P>
<P>Faraday begins to suspect conspiracy while everyone around him is
convinced that he has gone off the deep end. With his extensive
knowledge of terrorism, he is determined to discover the secret behind
his peculiar neighbors. But is there anything to discover?</P>
<P>Arlington Road is a film about denial. We clamor for a sense of personal
security and when that is taken away from us we, as a people, are
willing to drastically mislead ourselves to get it back. This movie says
that there is no conspicuous end to our self-delusion. Those who dare to
stand up and argue that the conclusions we so deliberately come to are
wrong are immediately labeled paranoid, perhaps even crazy. In that
sense, this is a staggeringly brilliant cautionary tale.</P>
<P>Aside from that, it's also an insanely suspenseful thriller. With tour
de force cinematography, a stunningly effective (although fairly
standard) soundtrack and intriguing scene set-ups, Arlington Road
generated such pure, unadulterated tension that I must admit I was taken
aback. In the best Hitchcock tradition, here's a movie that not only
entertains and keeps you glued to the screen in the immediate present
but one that also carries enough weight to remain in your memory for a
significant amount of time after you throw away that empty popcorn
bucket.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges gives a virtuoso performance as the desperate Faraday. He
is the perfect action hero: a character without a hint of pretension who
acts on instinct alone. Bridges plays Faraday as a despairing person and
succeeds in making him a sympathetic character. Tim Robbins, heretofore
underused in dramatic roles, is absolutely chilling as the ominous
neighbor while Joan Cusack as Robbins' wife continues to show us why she
is one of the most talented actresses in the business.</P>
<P>I will not reveal the ending, but I will say that it is the perfect
example of why I love going to the movies. It is exactly the kind of
daring, unapologetic conclusion that shows me that there are still
people in the mainstream movie business willing to go against popular
convention. Pellington and writer Ehren Kruger (the upcoming Scream 3)
saw an opportunity to solidify the film's point and went for it without
wimping out.</P>
<P>It's a shame that Arlington Road is destined to get lost in the shuffle
with all the big blockbusters because it is (so far) the year's best
film. Only the best of filmmakers and performers can make me so
completely suspend my disbelief and get me involved in the action and
the folks involved with this production did just that. A pessimistic
cautionary tale, this is a movie that has all the potential of a great
movie and, for once is able to realize it.
