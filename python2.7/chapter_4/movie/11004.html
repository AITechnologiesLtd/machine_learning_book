Great Expectations</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Alfonso Cuaron</PRE>
<P>Starring Ethan Hawke (Finnegan Bell), Gwyneth Paltrow (Estella),
Hank Azaria (Walter Plane), Chris Cooper (Joe), Anne Bancroft
(Ms. Dinsmoor), Robert De Niro (Lustig)</P>
<P>Sympathetic press to the contrary notwithstanding, this film is
really just awful -- not merely flawed, but a really lousy piece
of filmmaking.  Its awfulness is made all the worse because it
feels slightly smug, as though it thinks it's important, artsy --
an achievement.  And that's a serious problem, because with this
sense of its own importance, it brings in all sorts of art film
baggage to call attention to itself -- expressionist lighting,
slow, laborious dialogue, overacting.  it leaves us with a mess
that's really only watchable because of its absurdity; one can
sit back and admire the scenery (and there is some lovely scenery)
without feeling the pressure of having a real cinematic
experience.</P>
<P>The story is, of course, loosely based on the novel by Charles
Dickens.  Like the novel, it opens with an initially frightening
encounter between an impoverished child (Finnegan Bell, played
here by Jeremy James Kissner) and an escaped criminal, Lustig
(Robert De Niro).  Finn is an orphan, and lives with his sister
and her husband in a squalid little town in Florida -- but he
has dreams of being an important artist one day.  He is
accosted by Lustig one afternoon while he's sitting in a small
rowboat in the bay, drawing pictures of birds and fish.  Lustig
emerges abruptly from underwater and induces Finn to fetch him
some bolt cutters and food.  Finn does as he's asked, and what's
more, he distinguishes himself by bringing along some whiskey.
Finn also goes above and beyond the call a bit later; as he
tries to help Lustig escape, his boat is accosted by a police
boat.  Lustig abandons ship -- and Finn, instead of simply
fleeing with the police, tosses the escapee a life jacket.
De Niro is fairly effective in this sequence (though it's
hardly outstanding work), and Kissner makes a fair showing;
so far so good.</P>
<P>Things go downhill fairly quickly, however, when we move to the
next sequence -- young Finn's first encounter with Estella (Raquel
Beaudene) and her crazed but affluent guardian, Miss Dinsmoor (Anne
Bancroft).  Estella and Miss Dinsmoor live in a decrepit old mansion
by themselves; Finn meets Estella while his own guardian is doing
some sort of delivery there.  Estella seems to take a reluctant
interest in Finn at first glance -- leading Miss Dinsmoor to invite
him to visit on a weekly basis, which he does for many, many years.
The visuals in this sequence are striking -- both the exterior and
the interior of Miss Dinsmoor's mansion are lavishly created and
well-filmed, which makes the dramatic flaccidly of these scenes
stand out all the more.  The weak link here is Bancroft's
performance, which is outlandish and laughable rather than sinister,
which seems to be what Cuaron was shooting for.  She prances about
to various versions of "Besame Mucho," occasionally muttering
things like "shika-boom" and fondling young Finn in a rather
suggestive way.  She also finds time to issue a warning to Finn:
"Don't fall for her.  She'll only hurt you."</P>
<P>Unfortunately for him and for us, Finn doesn't seem to listen, so
we get another 90 minutes or so of what is, more or less, a love
story.  We jump ahead a few years to watch Finn as a young man (a
slack-jawed Ethan Hawke) get teased, then summarily dumped by
Estella (an icy Gwyneth Paltrow).  Finn is heartbroken, and gives
up on his dreams -- of becoming an artist, and of ever escaping
the poverty of his community.  He stays there, learning to accept
his fate, when a lawyer appears on his doorstep, offering him a
ticket to the New York, art world -- money and a gallery show, a
gift from an anonymous donor.  Finn accepts what he assumes is
Miss Dinsmoor's generosity and heads north, where he finds a
receptive audience for his work.  He also finds Estella, on the
cusp of an engagement; he manages to seduce her, but the
seduction doesn't take, and she again moves out of his life.
I won't reveal the ending here, in case there's someone out
there who didn't have to read the Dickens novel in high school;
suffice it to say, everything wraps itself up in a rather
Dickinsian way.</P>
<P>Throughout it all, we're subjected to acting that ranges from
ridiculously overdone (Bancroft) to unreadably passive (Paltrow)
to aimless (Hawke).  Hawke and Paltrow, both fairly sexy
commodities in their own right, don't really seem to turn each
other on; they never manage to work up any credible chemistry.
The script is bland and directionless.  In the end, all we're
really left with are some fine visuals by Emmanuel Lubezki
(known for his work in _Like Water for Chocolate_ and _A Walk
in the Clouds) and some impressive artwork by Francesco Clemente
(who creates all the work attributed to Finn).  These are no
small pleasures, and if you're in the mood for a purely visual
experience, this film does have something to offer you.  I'd
recommend bringing along your Sony Discman and a pair of
headphones, though.</P>
