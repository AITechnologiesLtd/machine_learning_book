Review: Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The timing of events often has a great impact on a person's life. The
central theme of this film is how an intimate relationship between two
people can be affected by a large, outside force beyond their control.</P>
<P>The central character in the story is newspaperman Ishmael (Ethan
Hawke), who writes for the town newspaper he inherited from his father
in a small hamlet in the Pacific Northwest. He is a war veteran
scarred by the loss of his childhood sweetheart, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh),
who terminated their long-standing relationship while he was fighting
overseas. The story begins when Hatsue's husband, Kazuo (Rick Yune),
is charged with the murder of a local fisherman.</P>
<P>Although the events of Kazuo's trial form the primary component of the
plot, the heart of the story is the relationship between Ishmael and
Hatsue, and the forces that doomed it. Director Scott Hicks skillfully
intermixes the two parallel stories. Their relationship is
sporadically recounted as flashbacks, from to their friendship as
children to their breakup as young adults. The force they could not
stop was World War II, and its residual effects on American society.
Anti-Japanese sentiment is a destructive force for the couple and a
primary component of the trial. The trial overtly explores the
elements that played more subtly between Ishmael and Hatsue.</P>
<P>The core of the film is satisfying but it occasionally becomes tiring
when the story overuses melodramatic elements. The issue of racism
injects melodrama, but breaks no new ground. The core of the story has
wrapped up when Ishmael talks with Kazuo's lawyer, Nels Gudmundsson
(Max von Sydow), about the helpless course of human life controlled by
fate. It is a moving scene that sums up the entire story.</P>
<P>Recommended. This is a slow, introspective film which examines closure
for things lost. Although the story overuses the issue of racism for
dramatic effect, the exploration of the central theme is a rewarding
experience.</P>
