<P>Clint Eastwood seems to be choosing vastly different material,
moving away from the straight forward action adventures in which he
established his reputation to far more interesting, intelligent
character driven pieces.  His latest offering is True Crime, a rather
conventional crime drama that takes us onto death row and a race
against time to prevent an execution.  We've been down this path
before, most recently with James Foley's The Chamber, Bruce
Beresford's Last Dance, and Tim Robbins' powerful Dead Man Walking.
However, Eastwood brings an unexpected emotional depth to the material
which makes for gripping viewing.</P>
<P>Like his last few movies, True Crime has also been adapted
from a best selling novel.  Writers Larry Gross (48 Hours, etc), Paul
Brickman (Risky Business, etc) and Stephen Schiff (the recent
controversial adaptation of Lolita, etc) bring a rich emotional
texture to the multi-layered drama.</P>
<P>Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a stereotypical hard-drinking,
womanising rogue journalist whose private life is careening out of
control.  He finds one last chance at redemption when assigned to take
over a human interest story about Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a
convicted murderer due to be executed later that night by lethal
injection.  Beachum, a black mechanic, was accused of murdering a
pregnant, young, white shop assistant who owed him money.  Everett
discovers that Beachum may in fact be innocent, and sets out to prove
it.</P>
<P>True Crime primarily explores how justice is sometimes blind.
This is a more low key and surprisingly restrained film from Eastwood,
but he directs with his usual assurance and no-nonsense, economical
style.  Eastwood turns up the suspense in the film's latter portion as
he deftly intercuts between Everett's desperate search to uncover the
vital evidence that will prove his claims, and the prison, where
Beachum is being prepared for execution.  This injects a potent
emotional punch into the material.</P>
<P>The film also draws a nicely ironic contrast between Everett's
chaotic domestic life and Beachum's family, which brings an added
dimension to the drama.  However, some of the scenes in which Everett
attempts to spend quality time with his daughter (played by Eastwood's
real life daughter Francesca) do not add much to the drama, and only
serve to slow down the film.  Eastwood injects some light humour into
the film through Everett's heated clashes with his editors (a
wonderfully edgy Denis Leary and a gruff James Woods).</P>
<P>Eastwood himself delivers a solid performance as the cynical,
determined reporter, a role that perfectly suits his laconic screen
persona.  In one of his more subtle performances he gives the flawed
Everett a certain credibility.  Washington is superb and lends dignity
to his portrayal of Beachum, while Lisa Gay Hamilton (recently seen in
Beloved) is touching as his wife.  Bernard Hill (last seen as the
captain of the doomed Titanic) brings a sense of compassion to his
role as the prison warder.</P>
