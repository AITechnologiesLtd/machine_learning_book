<P>_The_Glass_House_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Even if the trailer didn't give away darn near every turn of its plot,
one would still have had an easy time predicting the course of events in
_The_Glass_House_.  A formulaic film that is more typical than terrible,
_The_Glass_House_ still makes for frustrating viewing, given the level of talent
involved.</P>
<P>        Topping that list is Leelee Sobieski, whose natural poise lends the
preposterous proceedings a certain level of credibility.  Her Ruby Baker is
introduced as a rebellious high schooler, but she quickly becomes more
well-behaved when her and her younger brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents
are killed in a mysterious auto accident.  Ruby and Rhett are then put in the
care of wealthy family friends Terry (Stellan Skarsgård) and Erin (Diane Lane)
Glass, who not only live in a large hilltop home made of (yes) glass, one of
their cars has the license plate "24KGLSS."  With all the heavy-handed
symbolism, could it be possible that this newly formed household could be in
danger of being shattered by a stone?</P>
<P>        But of course, and after Ruby rather conveniently happens upon some
suspicious conversations involving Terry, she finds out that her new guardians
don't have the most crystal clear of intentions.  Director Daniel Sackheim, who
cut his helming teeth on numerous episodes of _The_X-Files_, somehow manages to
generate an air of suspense even if he sometimes too easily falls in the trap of
dropping shady "hints" with all the subtlety and grace of a trowel.  Ultimately,
Sackheim and his able cast cannot overcome the increasingly overdone twists of
Wesley Strick's script (based on his output since, one wonders just how much of
the gripping 1991 _Cape_Fear_ remake was his doing and not director Martin
Scorsese's).  Did an unexceptional, unsurprising thriller need to morph into
another one of those films with a villain that just won't die?</P>
<P>        Then again, that's just another example of how by-the-numbers and
off-the-rack _The_Glass_House_ is.  Sobieski does intermittently rise above the
occasion, doing what she can with the film's only halfway-realistic role; some
usually reliable co-stars fare less well: Skarsgård gives in to the histrionics
of the script too easily while Lane is stymied by a role that's a nonentity on
the page.  Perhaps Lane's part is most reflective of the whole of the film:
neither here nor there, and easily forgotten.</P>
