                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Shakespeare's drama, OTHELLO, is one among many of his great
plays.  This story of the beautiful Desdemona (Irene Jacob), the
daughter of a Venetian nobleman, who elopes with her lover, Othello the
Moor, (Laurence Fishburne), a renowned warrior, like most of
Shakespeare's plays ends in betrayal, deceit and tragedy.  Some years
ago I saw James Earl Jones in a live performance that made me burst
into tears as he tore at his breast, as he bemoaned his having killed
his beloved wife.  You could feel his terrible hurt.   Fishburne, one
of my favorite actors, (What's Love Got To Do With It?) however, is not
quite ready to do justice to Shakespeare; at least not to the role of
Othello.</P>
<P>     Iago (Kenneth Branagh) is the conniving villain who despite having
been Othello's right hand man for some ten years, is overlooked and
instead, a promotion goes to Cassio (Nathaniel Parker).
>From then on Iago plots against Othello and Desdemona, to make
Othello suspicious, jealous of his wife.  Othello is filled with
disbelief and demands proof;  Iago supplies the "proof."  Branagh
plays it cool without histrionics but then, Branagh is not new to
Shakespeare.</P>
