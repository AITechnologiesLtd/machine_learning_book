<P>   I've often wondered about the sons and daughters of political
figures--people who are in the public eye to such an extent that
we must learn everything about this vice president's pacemaker
implant, that mayor's intention to move out of his executive
lodging because of marital troubles, and the other president's
infidelities with a woman about his own daughter's age.  I'd be
proud as all-get-out if my dad were a congressman or a governor
or a member of a big city council or even a leader of an online
film critics' organization.  I'd do nothing to make him ashamed of
me.  And yet when President Nixon declared during one
recession that Americans should try to spend their money in the
U.S.A., one of his daughter's goes abroad with every nation's
camera flashing away. Our current president's daughter gets
picked up for drinking with a phony i.d. and the brother of one of
our previous chief executives acts like a mentally-challenged
creep.  Kudos to Chelsea Clinton for deliberately staying out of
the limelight and quietly preparing for her four years at Oxford
University.  But a high school senior named Nicole (Kirsten
Dunst) is quite another story, a messed-up piece of work. 
"Crazy/Beautiful" is her story: she's crazy and her boy friend
Carlos (Jay Hernandez) is beautiful.  Unfortunately the film
directed by John Stockwell from a script by Phil Hay and Matt
Manfredi neither pushes the envelope sufficiently to make the
picture crazy nor do they do much to accomplish the beautiful. 
What happened?  Simply that "Crazy/Beautiful"  comes across in
every scene without exception as a made-for-TV movie, taking
on a subject that might have been controversial in the 1950s, that
of a cross-cultural romance between a serious Mexican-
American lad intent on going to Annapolis when he graduates
from Pacific High School in California and a 17-year-old woman
who acts all too carefree to cover up her depression and even
suicidal tendencies.</P>
<P>   "Crazy/Beautiful" copies a scenario from Antonia Bird's
mediocre 1995 movie starring the bland Chris O'Connell and the
lovely drew Barrymore about teen lovers on the run, with
Barrymore playing the erratic bimbo while Chris is the down-to-
earth Mr. Bland.  Nicole, the son of rich Congressman Tom
Oakley (Bruce Davison), acts wacked-out whether in he spacious
home presided over by a maid or driving to her class in a
stunning high school.  (We know these girls are spoiled staight
away when Nicole's best friend says "I hate this school" upon
pulling into the parking lot.)  She and Carlos meet cute as Nicole
is picking up trash under the boardwalk, community service as
the result of a drug conviction.  It's pretty much love and first
sight, given that Carlos's friends act like idiots when they're
around the fair sex and that Carlos project the kind of stability
that Nicole finds lacking in her all-too-liberal father--who thinks
nothing of her daughter's sleeping around in the Oakley
household.  Carlos's family tries to discourage him from dating a
(gasp) white girl, her race meaning more to them than her
undomesticated behavior while Congressman Tom is concerned
not that his daughter is dated someone with a darker skin than
she but that the ambitious Mexican-American might be ruining his
own life.</P>
<P>   The story proceeds by the numbers, the soundtrack telling us
what to feel in each scene--all of which is a pity given the ability
of these two fine actors who really do send out shock waves
whenever they're together.  For Dunst, this is a step down from
the far more challenging "The Virgin Suicides" though the picture
bodes well for Mr. Hernandez who has been known mostly for his
work on TV.  A teen picture all the way for teens who might be
disappointed after digging more daring fare such as "A.I." and
"Moulin Rouge."</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 97 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
