<P>THE TRUMAN SHOW ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (<A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A>)</P>
<P>(By now, most of you know how much my site SUCKS.
Come visit this train wreck of a webpage, anyway:

<P>starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Natasha McElhone
screenplay by Andrew Niccol
directed by Peter Weir</P>
<P>Weir is well-respected in Hollywood for turning scripts with difficult
subject-matter into deceptively simple, powerful films, The Mosquito
Coast (utopia) and Fearless (post-traumatic stress disorder) among
them. In The Truman Show, Weir essentially breathes life into the
now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from
the inside-out. It certainly helps that he has an underrated performer
in top-form playing the title character, Truman Burbank.</P>
<P>By now you must be aware of the premise: unbeknownst to him, Truman
(Carrey) is the star of his own TV series, a 24-7 peep-show in which
he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations;
people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his
genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants. `Seahaven', his
hometown, and the show itself, are the brainchild of Christof
(Harris), who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon,
directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras.  For 30
years, Truman suspects nothing-`We accept the reality we're
given,' poses Christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny
town and visit a long lost love in `Fiji' (McElhone, who was
actually an actress fired by Christof for trying to break the
confidentiality agreement) overwhelms him. Thus, Christof and his team
suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of
Seahaven intact, lest Truman discover the world outside and put an end
to the highly-rated program.</P>
<P>In a few broad strokes, Weir creates a convincing second-reality, and
he has the good sense not to bring Christof into the picture until
almost three-quarters through. This allows us to comprehend and accept
Truman's world before we contextualize it. For all his madness,
Christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship,
and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it.
Truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be,
well, so darn nice; like a sibling (or, perhaps more appropriately, a
caged animal in an interactive zoo), they want to see him succeed. The
surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight
screenplay and a sympathetic Carrey-he really is an everyman here,
abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible, wide-eyed
bewilderment. Cinematically, The Truman Show is impeccable, stylishly
photographed by Peter Biziou and littered with symbolic images. As
well, it employs Wojciech Kilar's piece "Zycie za zycie'
masterfully and beautifully. If the film has any flaws, one may find
them in Laura Linney's characterization as Meryl, Truman's
"wife" (I doubt that Betty Crocker impersonation would fool anyone),
and in a subplot involving Truman's `father', which feels
curiously incomplete.</P>
<P>There are a few stupendous sequences, and the film pulls off a
wonderful trick: we become Truman's audience as much as the loyal
viewers in the film. They wear buttons asking `How will it end?'
I couldn't wait to know myself, though I didn't exactly want it
to end, for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most
complex-summer picture in years.</P>
