<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>In Alison Maclean's `Jesus' Son', the audience is
provided with a narrator who sounds drunk, a
disjointed plot that doesn't make a whole lot of
sense, a handful of undeveloped lowlifes who are
supposed to pass as characters, and some heavy-handed
Christ imagery. However, by the end of the film, I
hardly cared, because although `Jesus' Son' contains
not an ounce of dramatic substance, Maclean's
disjointed, careless style suits the `slacker' tale
rather well. </P>
<P>The film is based on a series of
semi-autobiographical, drug-induced short stories
written by cult favorite Denis Johnson. `Jesus' Son'
tells of the random misadventures of a 1970's heroin
addict named Fuck Head (Billy Crudup). Our narrator,
whom we first encounter on a dark highway, is FH
himself, who tells his story in a non-linear manner;
often forgetting and remembering, clarifying and
commenting. The tactic, which is meant to be either
humorous or interesting, comes off instead as
annoying. </P>
<P>FH doesn't lead a terribly important life. Our
information about him is limited: he is a junkie, his
girlfriend Michelle (Samantha Morton) is a junkie, and
his friends (Denis Leary, Jack Black) are, you guessed
it…junkies. No background, no goals, nothing but drugs
and booze. It's not hard to imagine how that kind of
lifestyle can alienate a man. Indeed, FH lives a life
of cloudy alienation; a life in which the boundary
between a vision and a hallucination is a thin line. </P>
<P>And, of course, `Jesus' Son' fits into the genre of
the tried and true `let's get sober' cautionary tale,
somewhere along the lines of `Drugstore Cowboy'. But,
after a dreadfully poor opening act, the film settles
down to find its own quirky charm. One especially
entertaining episode involves FH's night out with a
pill-popping peer played by the multi-talented Jack
Black (`High Fidelity'). </P>
<P>With an eclectic soundtrack of 70's rock hits, some
`far out' hallucination sequences, and a cameo by
Dennis Hopper, pioneer of another drug culture,
`Jesus' Son' gets an A for style. It's too bad, then,
that the film is so shallow, because, with a bit of
substance, this could have been a cult classic.
`Jesus' Son' shows us how the characters use drugs,
but never tells us why. </P>
<P>Alison Maclean (`Crush') directs this film with a
unique visual flair, shooting the more intimate
sequences on digital video. She shows a lot of
promise. It is the screenplay, written by three
people, that ruins a potentially strong picture. The
script never treats FH like a person, even if the
camera does. `Jesus' Son' is at times remarkably
atmospheric, and at other times remarkably bad. For
the most part, `Jesus' doesn't deserve your faith. </P>
