<PRE>GODZILLA (1998)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
Originally reviewed on July, 1998</PRE>
<P>Writer-director Roland Emmerich has produced some of the biggest box-office
champs in history, particularly the grossly silly though often fun "Independence
Day." Back in 1998, he produced and directed the most overhyped movie event of
all time, "Godzilla." "Godzilla" was so overhyped in its marketing campaign
(which started a year earlier) that there was no point in seeing the movie at
all - you already had. In the previews, there were glimpses of Godzilla's
enormous foot destroying half of New York City's streets and close-ups of its
reptilian eye, and that's about all you see in the movie, folks. After Godzilla
invades New York, he inexplicably and implausibly hides in the sewer and plays
hide-and-seek with army helicopters. The footage is shot at night, and it is so
poorly photographed that you can barely see the huge lizard at all, only a big,
blurry shadow. And then there are Godzilla's numerous babies on the loose in
typical velociraptor/"Jurassic Park" fashion. </P>
<P>For such a lavishly expensive production with state-of-the-art special effects,
you would think we would at least see this creature. Godzilla stampeding through
the city of New York is a great, wondrous and scary idea but the movie never
follows suit. His foot is seen crushing cars, potholes, etc. How about Godzilla
knocking over the Statue of Liberty or climbing the Twin Towers on Wall Street
or lashing his tail against Times Square billboards? Nope, the filmmakers never
use their imagination in conveying the destructive nature of the beast. He
mostly runs through the city and often yells, and that is about it. How does
this creature hide though? How does it change size and shape throughout? And how
dare they allow us to develop sympathy for the monster only to then ask us to
hate it at the end when all you hear is its heart beating (a lift from 1976's
"King Kong")? </P>
<P>Another fact lost by the filmmakers is the genesis of this creature. Godzilla
was a Japanese creation, a symbol of America coming on their fort and starting a
war, namely World War II and the counterattack on Pearl Harbor. This new
Godzilla is simply a special-effects blur with no personality and no purporse.
This is Godzilla for the 90's with anemic co-stars such as Matthew Broderick,
Hank Azaria and the shrill-voiced Maria Pitillo to boot? I'll stick with the
original 1955 black-and-white version with Raymond Burr, thank you. At least the
fire-breathing monster of that film was destructive. </P>
