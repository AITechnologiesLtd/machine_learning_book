<PRE>IN SHORT: More Americans in Hell.</PRE>
<P>Sure, stories of innocent Americans wrongfully busted and languishing in
the hellish conditions of foreign jails have been done before . . . but
we don't compare to 'em. Probe your video store owner's memory 'cuz
Cranky can only think of two, offhand.</P>
<P>Brokedown Palace is the story of two bestest of friends who sneak off to
Thailand (their parents think they're in Hawaii) as a post-high school
graduation jaunt. Why Thailand? Well, it's a particularly teenage bit of
reasoning that leads 'em to this destination, and an amusing couple of
seconds of film which I won't spill. It's one of the lighter moments in
David Arata's screenplay, which tries to stress the bonds of friendship
between Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale). It doesn't
work well, which explains some of the audience reaction reported below.</P>
<P>Most of the front half of Palace is narrated by Danes via a cassette
tape she's managed to send to "Yankee Hank" Greene (Bill Pullman), an
American lawyer partnered legally and matrimonially with a Thai local
named Yon (Jacqueline Kim). Hank ain't no white collared, built on
principle, legal eagle. He's not above shmoozing the local Drug
Enforcement Agency liaison (Lou Diamond Phillips) for information or
doing the investigative work the local police don't (or won't) do. But
when the money is gone, so is Hank.</P>
<P>And money doesn't go very far in the Thai justice system.</P>
<P>What remains is a friends against all odds story, with all the twists
that that would imply, and another twists and turns filled subplot which
I won't spoil. Danes' character is more street savvy, Beckinsale's more
naive and both actors do decent work. The problem, at least for me, is
that the pair didn't click as true friends. They come off more as
partying buddies, though that may be the generation of years gap between
Cranky and these kidlets.</P>
<P>When the big dramatic climax came, the woman to my right was sniffling
mightily. Those in front of me were cackling like hyenas and many walked
out calling Brokedown Palace "ridiculous." Those were the women, who
should be more sympathetic. Geez, I'm the one who's supposed to be
cranky . . .</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Brokedown Palace, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.50</PRE>
<PRE>Just below dateflick level.</PRE>
