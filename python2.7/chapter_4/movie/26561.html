<PRE>MEET THE PARENTS (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Jay Roach</PRE>
<P>Screenplay: James Herzfeld, John Hamburg</P>
<P>Starring: Robert De-Niro, Ben Stiller, Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, James 
Rebhorn, Owen Wilson, Jon Abrahams, Phyllis George, Thomas McCarthy, Nicole 
DeHuff, Judah Friedlander, Kali Rocha</P>
<P>In MEET THE PARENTS, Robert De Niro, one of our most studied character 
actors, progresses further into staking out a little niche in playing 
identifiable caricatures. De Niro does this with about as much laid back ease 
as he employed energetic gusto for the wounded anti-hero roles he used to 
essay in the 70's. I'd rather see him in more movies like TAXI DRIVER or 
RAGING BULL, but I can't deny that he's been very (if not equally) effective 
in his latest ventures. Playing the aging, sad sack Mafia man in ANALYZE 
THIS, he indulged in a heightened variation of the wise guys he used to excel 
at dramatically, his face crinkled and pained with a tone thick, as if full 
of pasta; it was a terrific counterpoint to Billy Crystal's nervous nilly of 
a psychiatrist. Though I didn't really care for that film (it was more a 
series of skits [albeit some funny] that didn't really come together) I 
nevertheless enjoyed the anxious chemistry cultivated between Crystal and De 
Niro.</P>
<P>MEET THE PARENTS is also like a series of skits, these connected by the 
nightmare conceit of a groom attempting to impress his possible in-laws to be 
over one horrendous weekend. But here the skits hang together rather nicely, 
and Ben Stiller makes an even more likeable comic leading man than Crystal's 
callow invention. And De Niro's more interesting too; we've already seen him 
do the Mafia schtick more than we've seen George W. Bush make a mockery out 
of the human language (see, I follow politics), but I can't recall him ever 
playing a creepily wholesome, grandfatherly type; I'm guessing his research 
here amounted to viewing a slew of FATHER KNOWS BEST reruns.
But the film takes a while to get good; it opens pretty badly with a nearly 
nauseating shower of sweetness. We start with a scene in which the earnest, 
eager to please, and very unfortunately named Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) 
proposes to an off screen paramour. He's so sincere and puppy doggish, his 
blue eyes twinkling with hope, that we just know some kind of gag is 
a'brewin, and of course the camera angle switches to reveal that he's really 
proposing to an old man. Cue the laugh track. He's actually practicing for 
the real one, an easy guffaw, and the next scene continues in this dubious 
vein with Stiller attempting to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Terri Polo) 
while several (contrived) interruptions manage to stop him from doing so. At 
this point I'm debating on whether or not to high tail it outta here and 
sneak into the new Stallone picture next door (his fifth come back vehicle, I 
believe, which should at least be good for a few laughs).</P>
<P>Thankfully the picture hits its stride in the very next scene, in which 
Stiller insists on spending the weekend with Pam and her parents, giving him 
the opportunity to do the right thing, that being, to ask for her beloved 
father's approval. On the way to the parents, the picture settles into a 
comedy of extreme errors, with the world seemingly conspiring against Greg. 
After a big hubbub with some bag checkers, he checks his mini-suitcase at the 
airport, later finding his worse fears confirmed; it's been misplaced, 
(presumably by the ear muff wearing blue collar folk in whose hands we must 
entrust our sacred belongings), along with it, the engagement ring and all 
his clothing. Poor Greg warily stumbles to a busy customer service lady, who 
pooh-poohs him away just as a baby upchucks all over him and the only clothes 
he has left.</P>
<P>Now Greg must go to already one of the most nerve wracking meetings 
in his life, stinking like "sour milk" which certainly doesn't leave a great 
impression on Pam's stern authoritarian father (yup, Bobby D.), who's so 
square and twinkly eyed he's damn near psychotic. We first meet De Niro as he 
peeps out the second floor window, his eyes narrowing like a Cheetah ready to 
pounce. (Additionally, menacing thriller music pipes up to let us know this 
guy means business, as if we couldn't already tell). Their first meeting is a 
gem with Stiller, at his awkward best, trying so visibly hard to say the 
right thing, but flubbing horribly, which always gets a laugh, then the 
camera clicking over to De Niro's frowning mug, incredulous that his daughter 
is sleeping with such a fool, which gets a bigger laugh.</P>
<P>Stiller, essentially playing the same role he essayed in FLIRTING WITH 
DISASTER (my favorite of his bumbling duffas trilogy) and THERE'S SOMETHING 
ABOUT MARY (a close second), has become an expert at flustered comic 
awkwardness. He's like a handsome Woody Allen, with his nervous tics closer 
to reality and less exaggerated than that little pipsqueak's (I use the term 
affectionately). Stiller has one of those common faces; look at him quick and 
you might mistake him for someone else like Hank Azaria or John Cusack or the 
guy who bags your groceries. He's an every man-type, almost immediately 
likeable, maybe because he reminds us of someone we know, and maybe because 
as an actor, he isn't afraid to look foolish or even let himself be upstaged 
by bodily fluids. Stiller is such a likeable presence that despite his 
character's occasional idiotic tendencies, we remain in his corner, almost 
protective of him; we might laugh at the guy as he's making a fool out of 
himself but ultimately we want him to win.</P>
<P>The wry Owen Wilson (SHANGHAI NOON) pops up in a bit part that could be 
described as the anti-every man. He's Pam's ex, a self-made millionaire and 
one of those fellows who likes to list his amazing achievements in an off 
hand way as if to say "ahh shucks, it was really nothing". Terri Polo has a 
bigger role, though isn't required to do much beside look at Stiller with 
either lust or concern. Blythe Danner is the WASPy mother whose greeting to 
her daughter, "There's my whittle girl", actually made me blush. Along the 
way director Jay Roach includes some amusing broad caricatures in minor bits, 
like the overweight stoner behind the supermarket counter who gets laughs 
because he isn't as stupidly over the top as he would be in an Adam Sandler 
picture, or the monotone stewardess who acts like a robot with a glitch in 
her system.</P>
<P>The film itself is little more than Stiller's non-stop attempts to ingratiate 
himself to De Niro and then the beautiful, cringe-inducing backfire, 
concluded by Stiller's hilariously perplexed mug, his jaw practically down to 
his knees, and De Niro, scowling as if to say "who is this man and what the 
hell is he doing in my house?" There isn't any emotional pull (well, a little 
bit but it's all arbitrary stuff about fathers not letting their little girls 
grow up, stuff that probably won't resonate with anybody who's watched a 
steady diet of sitcoms), or unnecessary sub plots or much of anything to get 
in the way of the film's sole desire to make its audience laugh and maybe 
even nod its head in recognition. There are occasional lulls (not many, but 
enough to note) that exist solely because the film isn't concerned with 
giving us much of anything besides the laughs (yes a minor complaint, but a 
picture like FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is so much more satisfying because of its 
added humanity).
Still, MEET THE PARENTS is very funny and well put together, especially for a 
broad mainstream comedy. The comic set pieces are similar to those found in 
the NATIONAL LAMPOON VACATION films, where despite that most of the gags are 
projected before they occur, they still get laughs; in this movie they work 
because of director Roach's canny comic technique (it's all in the reaction 
shots). In one scene we see a typical comic misunderstanding in which Stiller 
gets what he thinks is his suitcase back. It isn't. He leaves the room, and 
we see De Niro pick the lock to go through it, checking up on his daughter's 
suitor to, I guess, make sure he isn't some kind of wacko (which in itself is 
kind of wacko). Before he opens the thing we just know there's gonna be 
something odd inside, and therie is, but what sells the bit is De-Niro's 
slight facial grimace; we can feel his disgust.</P>
<P>For the most part MEET THE PARENTS doesn't follow the string of recent 
comedies that mistake oozing bodily fluids for punch lines (the descendants 
of MARY, I'm thinking of ROAD TRIP in particular). Though it does what's 
logically next in line; it mines the embarrassment of Greg's situation for 
all it's worth and then some. Right when you thought they were down with the 
poor fellow, the film makers make every little social lie, every tiny misstep 
take on near epic proportions, like when he lets the cat out of his sight, or 
smokes a cigarette on the roof, again, we know what's going to happen, but 
the laughs come in seeing it happen well.</P>
