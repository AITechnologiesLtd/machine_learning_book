<P>    When the political correctness movement began it was
fashionable for men to express their feminine side, to show
their emotions freely, to cry when they felt sad.  Then a
backlash developed: women decided they weren't so sure that
men should show their weaknesses and needs so
flamboyantly.  The principal character in the delightful comedy
of manners "Hav Plenty," Lee Plenty (Christopher Scott),
experiments with the fouding ideas of PC, outdoing Woody
Allen in putting himself down.  He's temporarily homeless, but
instead of hiding that actuality to the attractive women he
meets one day, he revels in revealing this information as
though eager to study their reactions.  To his surprise, they
are perversely captivated by his honesty and aggressively hit
on him to such a degree that he actually must struggle to fend
them off.</P>
<P>   "Hav Plenty" may be a screwball, lighter-than-air burlesque,
but it's filled with so much rapid-fire snappy dialogue and
edited so swiftly that it demands your close attention to the
words.  Narrated by Christopher Scott Cherot (who also
wrote, directed, edited and stars in this little gem), "Hav
Plenty" is a movie within a movie, a Pirandellian report of a
series of events that occurred in the life of its director during
the course of a year.  Stretching the theme a bit we could
almost say that it's an African-American "The Last Days of
Disco," focusing on a group of buppies (black, upwardly-
mobile professionals) who are self-absorbed and thoroughly
into themselves, but who underneath their unbending exteriors
display signs of emotional need.</P>
<P>   The story opens on Lee Plenty, a New York writer suffering
from block, whose lucrative book deal has fallen through just
as he had given up his New York apartment.  Left without a
place to stay, he is invited by a buddy he knew from college,
Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell) to her mother's lavish
home in Washington D.C. where he is introduced to Hav's
unhappily married, beautiful sister and to her brazen friend
Caroline.  The more Lee puts himself down, the more the
women are taken by him.  But the materialist Hav, who who
has the deepest affection for him, cannot consider him for
marriage because he is not financially successful.  Hav had
just broken up with a flourishing soul singer, Michael
Simmons (Hill Harper), who had been caught cheating and
who keeps his eye out for admiring women, greeting everyone
with the same expression, "Hey! Love 40, baby!"</P>
<P>   While exposing the audience to the haughtiness of this
upscale group of young black professionals (Hav works in
publishing while her dad owns a lucrative software company),
Christopher Scott Cherot keeps the best lines for himself.  In
the tradition of Restoration Comedy, Cherot spoofs the vanity
of the class, allowing Caroline to sprinkle French into her
conversation and to arrogantly flush a broken toilet despite
warning signs that such an action could cause a rank flood.</P>
<P>    Woody Allen, then, meets Spike Lee in a congenial
comedy that has the excellent Mr. Cherot stopping the action
from time to time to address the audience directly, even
counseling us that he is about to make a fool of himself.  He's
an absolute charmer who unfortunately is to lose his delightful
innocence once he becomes a success in the professional
world.</P>
