<P>     What is it about females bonding in graveyards?  First, we get the
climax of MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO amidst the quiet solitude of the
tombstones.  Now, two key scenes in this newest women's buddy film take
place in a similar setting.  Unless I'm very much mistaken, this is not
representative of a real-life trend.  The tactic of including these
sequences is symptomatic of the single major flaw suffered by both
films--a contrived artificiality that deadens any possible emotional
response to the characters or their situations.</P>
<P>     Of the two, NOW AND THEN is the worse offender.  Very little in
this film comes across as believable.  When individual moments work (and
it's usually just isolated "moments", not even whole scenes), it's
typically because they involve the kind minutiae anyone can dredge up
from their memories.  For example, consider the rather charming account
of a first kiss.  In penning this, screenwriter I. Marlene King probably
relied more on real experience than imagination.  Unfortunately, this
sort of personal insight is not the norm for NOW AND THEN's hopelessly
mundane script.</P>
<P>     The film opens and closes in the modern time frame.  There, we meet
adult versions of our four heroines:  Samantha (Demi Moore), an
emotionally unstable science fiction writer; Roberta (Rosie O'Donnell),
a down-to-earth, hard-working doctor; Teeny (Melanie Griffith), an
actress; and Chrissy (Rita Wilson), a prudish, pregnant housewife.  The
occasion of their reunion is Chrissy's impending blessed event.</P>
<P>     Between the modern-day prologue and epilogue, we are treated to an
eighty-minute flashback to the Summer of 1970.  There, we encounter
junior high versions of Samantha (Gaby Hoffman), Roberta (Christina
Ricci), Teeny (Thora Birch), and Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore).  For
most of the film, these four are "investigating" the 1945 death of "Dear
Johnny", a young boy whose spirit they believe they have summoned
through an impromptu seance.  In the process, they learn things about
friendship, loss, and death.  Everything, from the overall arc of the
story to individual lines of dialogue, is too obvious.</P>
<P>     The four young actresses are all more impressive than their adult
counterparts, although certain casting choices left me scratching my
head.  As good as Christina Ricci is as Roberta, am I really supposed to
believe that she grows up (and out) to become Rosie O'Donnell?  This
goes beyond a reasonable suspension of disbelief.  At least the other
three transformations are acceptable.</P>
<P>     While the 1970s segments of NOW AND THEN are of the hit-and-miss
variety, the 1995 scenes are uniformly bad.  I had some interest in what
happened with the twelve year olds, but I didn't care about them at all
once they had grown up.  The "now" scenes feel much like an excuse for
four high-profile actresses to lend their names to this film.  At best,
their presence is superfluous.  Yet even had the film remained entirely
in the "then" time frame, it still would have been lacking.  There's
just not enough originality here, no matter what year it is.</P>
