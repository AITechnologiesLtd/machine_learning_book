<PRE>                                BITTER MOON
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     I couldn't tell if BITTER MOON was intended as a serious study of
sexual obsession or as a too-subtle parody of the same thing.  Roman
Polanski has either gone off the deep end with this story of a man
overwhelmed by desire for his young wife (played by Emmanuel Seigner,
who happens to be Polanski's young wife) or I and the audience I was
with are simply too unsophisticated to appreciate this wry, witty story
of the sexual exploits of a pompous fool.</P>
<P>     Peter Coyote plays a wrecked man who claims to have been destroyed
by his intensely sexual relationship with his wife.  On a cruise to
Israel, Hugh Grant meets first his wife, and later him, and is warned
against her charms. (Oddly, Grant's wife in this film is Kristin
Scott-Thomas, his friend from FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, who again
plays a woman named Fiona.)</P>
<P>     The strangest thing about this film is that Coyote's character
writes and talks with consistently lurid, purple prose.  He comes to
Paris to be a writer, though it's obvious he can't write at all, as his
style is straight out of the pages of a romance novel combined with
Penthouse letters.</P>
<P>     I have a suspicion that Polanski intended Coyote's character to
have a comic effect, at which he is certainly successful, but then
somehow in the editing the point of the film, which was to make a
comedy, got strangely twisted by someone with no sense of humor.  The
overall tone of the film is entirely serious, if excessively cliche,
and the direciton never makes it clear how you are supposed to react.</P>
<P>     If this is a serious film, it has been done better before, for
example in the execrable WILD ORCHID or the mediocre 9-1/2 WEEKS.
I never before realized how good these movies could look in
comparison.  Compared to Coyote as directed by Polanski, Mickey Rourke
is Marlon Brando before he gained weight.</P>
<P>     I have a suggestion for improving the film, if Polanski wants to
try again.  Try casting Grant as the wrecked lover and Coyote as the
naif.  The effect would be entirely different, and much more
intersting, if it were Grant saying those lines--assuming he could
keep his expression straight, that is.</P>
<P>     One other thing: Polanski would be well-advised to keep young
children out of his films.  One cannot help but wonder what the casting
requirements must be.</P>
