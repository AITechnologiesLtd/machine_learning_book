<P>Although it has some suspense, especially for cat devotees, and moments of
sadness, "When the Cat's Away" is first and foremost a Gallic Delight. In
1983-85, writer-director Eric Klapisch, a Parisian, was in New York
University's film school, also worked on short films in the Big Apple. Back
in Paris he was involved in industrial films, documentaries, shorts, made
his own TV documentary on the Masai of Kenya. Four features followed of
which "When the Cat..." is Number Three. It has won several prizes
including the International Critics' Award at the Berlin Film Festival.</P>
<P>"Cat" was planned as a short, the genuine story of a friend who before
leaving on vacation left her cat with an old lady, Madame Renee. When the
young woman returned to Paris, the cat had disappeared. Madame Renee
enlisted many senior citizen friends to help the girl find her feline.</P>
<P>During preliminary work on the short, Klapisch, having "discovered all
these wonderful people" decided to expand the movie into a feature. The
result is a wonderful picture, much of it improvised yet  showing no signs
of the original project having been stretched by force. It is like a short
story that is turned into a really good novel.</P>
<P>Protagonist Chloe is played by Garance Clavel. She had been in just one TV
movie before this. I think that whoever chose her uncommon given name was
propitiating the Gods of Cinema. The magnificent actress known simply as
Arletty had played the unforgettable role of Garance in that classic of
classics, "Children of Paradise" (1945).</P>
<P>Chloe, in her early twenties, is a make-up artist for fashion models being
photographed. The work  is demanding, the bosses are hard task master. She
badly needs a vacation, her first in three years. She lives in the Bastille
neighborhood, a popular area (in the sense of many working class dwellers)
that has been undergoing major upgrades in the last decades. She saves on
rent by sharing a small apartment in a big old building with Michel, a gay
friend.</P>
<P>Any family she may have is not mentioned. Her only relative is her furry
cat Gris-Gris (literally Gray-Gray in French). When someone asks why that
name for a black cat, Chloe does not explain that  Gris-Gris means an
African amulet or fetish. (The film has several connections to Africa, but
like all else, nothing is underlined).</P>
<P>There are no men either in Chloe's private life. The movie does not go into
explanations, such as timidity or lack of opportunities. It's a common fact
that many a person is caught inside singleness which brings solitude and
sadness. Among the many nice aspects of the movie is that Chloe is just an
ordinary person, not especially beautiful though appealing, quiet and very
much alone.</P>
<P>Before she leaves for the sea, she must find someone to take care of the
cat. Her roommate flatly refuses (He's also irritated because he just split
with his current boyfriend). Chloe asks around. In a very French way
everyone has a suggestion. She ends up by leaving Gris-Gris with a neighbor
she did not know existed, a hoarse-voiced little old lady with her own
mini-zoo of cats.</P>
<P>Cut to a single picture of Chloe, alone by the sea, in a flash that
compresses all of the vacation. It is a humorous bit with a melancholy
subtext. It is also a vivid example of skillful, no-nonsense, economical
film editing. All of "Cat"'s techniques are intelligently simple and
ungimmicky. In a later sequence the movie cuts from someone dangling from a
roof to is being safe on the ground. The intervening rescue by firemen is
skipped. This saves production money and eliminates unwanted suspense and
dramatics.</P>
<P>When  Chloe goes to pick up Gris-Gris, a desolate Madame Renee tells her
"Your cat has vanished. Believe me, it's never happened to me before. I
looked all over." The search begins. Some acquaintances and some
strangers-until-now help Chloe with Lost  Kitty posters. She meets Jamel
(Dzhah-MEL), a nice, slow-witted handyman of Arabic parentage. He becomes
her assistant.</P>
<P>Diminutive Madame Renee mobilizes a fascinating, real-life network of older
women. They flood Chloe with advice and suggestions, often make hilarious
phone calls or subject her to solemn, "important" questionnaires.</P>
<P>To say that the search involves picaresque adventures would be hyperbolic.
Mr.Klapisch is working in realistic, not Hollywood-fictional style. To
begin with, the movie's Madame Renee is real. She is the very same person
who had lost the real cat of the real Chloe. Most other characters  are
real people too, not professional actors. The neighborhood is real, the
streets, cafes, shops are real as is the battalion of lady-searchers, all
friends of Madame Renee. So is the commotion about Gris-Gris, Paris being
Cat City. You can't push realism much farther. (Yes, kitty is finally
located).</P>
<P>The movie's catchy English title is misleading, as one might expect it to
develop into a "The Mice Will Play" situation.The French title literally
means "Everyone Is Looking for her/his Cat" but at a deeper level implies
that all people are after something. It could anything: money, love, sex,
the pursuit of happiness and its bluebird. Jamel, for example, though not
ill-treated, can be the butt of some jokes. He needs a friend and finds one
in Chloe.</P>
<P>In her wanderings, Chloe herself meets and discovers new people and places.
It's not always positive, but the possibility of friendships or
relationships is in the air. In the process, along with the young woman we
see and feel the ever-changing face of Paris and society. A giant crane is
demolishing a church. Old buildings are about to be torn down for more
upscale edifices. Tenants are being evicted. Old people are being replaced
by modern, often swinging youth. Familiar pop-and-mom shops are giving way
to impersonal modern facilities. Nostalgic Madame Renee and her cronies
treat us with sweet, often humorous running commentary on the unsettling
changes.</P>
<P>Director Klapisch has assimilated beautifully the populist French cinema of
the 1930s (minus its romantic, fate-driven darkness), the
film-rules-breaking New Wave, the naturalism of today's Young European or
American Cinema. He communicates feelings with sympathy but without
militancy, theatrics, drama, overt sentimentality, or the touristy
picturesqueness of romantic views of Paris. The.local color is unforced.
Klapisch subtly and unraucously evokes the past and the changing times. He
also shows us today's racial mixture in a working class that may not always
live in total harmony but does practice peaceful -- sometimes friendly
--coexistence.</P>
<P>(Note a pun that may reflect the mentality of the filmmakers. The real name
of the cat who plays Gris-Gris is Arapimou. The widely-traveled French
easily pick up foreign words. In Greek, Agapi means Love so that the
expression Agapimou means My Love. Arapi means a black African, which makes
Arapimou mean My Black).</P>
<P>Per a French saying, misfortune has its good side. In this well balanced
movie, a misfortune (the temporary absence of Gris-Gris) leads to a search
that expands Chloe's horizons and will lead to positive changes. On the
street she even eyes repeatedly an unknown young man. By chance, she later
has a quick, happy fling with him. It turns immediately into a downer but
still, the bottom line for Chloe is in her been meeting other people too.
Among them is a previously anonymous neighbor now being evicted. At the
end, Chloe, getting involved in local life, is among those who help the man
move his belongings. Earlier, he had been a sad widower. Now there's a
sudden, discreet yet promising spark between him and Chloe. The last scene
is one of hope as she runs along the streets with a beaming smile on her
face.</P>
<P>"Cat" has excellent English subtitles. Although I find no credits for the
music's organizer, the soundtrack is one of the best, a rich mixture of
genres popular among the French:  U.S. and French rap, salsa, African
songs, rock, a street band, oldies and more. Plus Chopin.</P>
