<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A so-so noir melodrama, that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable
premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the
husband she's madly in love with. Barbara Stanwyck is too powerful for this
role, therefore making it hard to believe that she has suddenly become a
vulnerable suburban housewife capable of such outlandish violence to further her
policeman husband's career. What keeps this melodrama going is the understated
star performances generated by Raymond Burr and Sterling Hayden, bouncing off
the fiercely passionate portrayal Stanwyck gives. </P>
<P>As the film opens Kathy Ferguson (Stanwyck) is a lovelorn columnist for the San
Francisco Post, who is known for her cynicism about the column while around the
other reporters and for her schmaltzy advice she dishes out to her love-sick
readers. When she's sent to cover a story about an L.A. woman who killed her
husband who is hiding out in San Francisco, she smokes her out by writing
sympathetic columns about a woman's plight and convinces her to turn herself
over to LAPD homicide cops Capt Charlie Alidos (Dano) and Lt. Bill Doyle
(Hayden). For this she gets her big break to become a star columnist for a New
York paper, but stops off in L.A. for a dinner date with Bill and in a fast
decision marries him and gives up her career. </P>
<P>She regrets her decision when she's taken into the suburban social circle of her
husband's colleagues and she can't stand their medocrity, their idolizing of the
wormy police captain, their talk of pensions, and the wives echoing the cliché
"Behind every successful man is a woman." She only stays because she lusts for
Bill, but she decides she wants him to be someone important. </P>
<P>When her car collides with the police inspector's wife, Alice Pope (Wray), she
uses this opportunity to know her powerful husband, who happens to be Doyle's
boss, Inspector Pope (Burr). Kathy schemes to get her husband promoted to
captain and Alidos transferred out, after some poison-pen letters show up
accusing her of having an affair with Pope. Alidos' backbiting wife Sara (Grey)
is suspected of writing these letters, and the emotionally charged Bill attacks
Alidos in the stationhouse. Pope handles the incident by dismissing any charges
against Doyle, and his friendship for Alidos sours. </P>
<P>In a moment of passion, Pope tells Kathy he is retiring and they make love with
the promise made that he will recommend her husband for that position. But the
next day he changes his mind and tells her that the police department comes
first and he doesn't think Bill is up to the job. To add insult to injury, he
tells her he is recommending her enemy Alidos. </P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow. </PRE>
<P>Kathy confronts Pope and tells him that she can only face herself after their
affair if her husband gets the promotion. When Pope states why he can't do it,
she shoots him with a gun she stole from the police station. The irony is, that
her husband leads the investigation to get Pope's killer and ends up arresting
her -- which proves how good a cop he really is. </P>
<P>Kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation, in many ways similar but a lot
more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her
lovelorn column. The best that can be said about this story, is that it's not
bad and it had some sparks in it to keep you awake. </P>
