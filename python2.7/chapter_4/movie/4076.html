<PRE>                          THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     Sin hangs inevitably and wonderfully over THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN.
Raised in a Catholic Church that still clings with bloody fingernails
to dictates that contradict human nature, the brothers ponder the
forbidden sins of premarital sex, birth control, abortion, and
masturbation--and then get right on with it.  The funny bone of this
movie is soaked in the guilt each brother carries as he indulges
himself.</P>
<P>     The three brothers McMullen have been raised by Mom and the Church
in the grand tradition of Irish Catholic duality.  In a superb opening
scene at the graveside of her newly dead husband, Mrs.  McMullen
announces to her son Barry (Edward Burns) that now that the rotter is
dead, she is leaving immediately for Ireland to return to a man she has
loved for 35 years.</P>
<P>     Perhaps an overdeveloped sense of duty is the only explanation for
staying for over three decades with an alcoholic tyrant who abused his
family.  But stay she did, and she taught her sons about the
inconvenient values of duty and fidelity.  The opening scene alone is a
real winner for Edward Burns, who wrote, directed, and starred in this
lively story of young people struggling with falling in love.</P>
<P>     The downside to this fine effort includes rough edges and obvious
editing, as well as young actors who lapse often into ordinariness,
exhausted by their grand effort.  If the movie is uneven, it is still a
home run for rookie Edward Burns.  Burns, Mike McGlone, Jack Mulcahy,
and "their women" win credit for a light evening that rivals the rest
of the Multiplex summer menu.</P>
<P>     Patrick, the dedicated idealist, suffers mightily.  "Hey, I don't
need any new ideas, I'm confused enough already."  Jack, after five
years of idyllic marriage to Molly, is still not ready for the children
his lovely wife wants.  Barry, the writer, flees at the first
suggestion of commitment.  "I wasn't ready to move out of my dorm," he
moans.  Lost without a woman, he's angry that they "peel away men's
protective coating and then slice them up."</P>
<P>     "You can't be a Catholic and have a healthy sex life," and
afterward, "I'm going to hell," are pithy comments from young men
tussling with churchly teachings and the demands of their modern
partners.  When Molly says, "We grow accustomed to things and just look
right past them," we know it's a concept covered with dust.  Women
don't look past things so easily anymore.</P>
<P>     "There are certain rules, and you gotta live by them," says a
brother who knows better.  This movie is a playful romp in an Irish
Catholic family whose men have an aversion to permanence, a dread at
the very thought of not experiencing the wonderful world of women
forever.  The brothers McMullen have a bucketful of charm and about
five years of fidelity for the women they love.  All for $20,000.  Take
that, Hollywood.</P>
