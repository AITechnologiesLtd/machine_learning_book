<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I expected this film, given its cliché subject matter, to be worst than
it turned out. In fact, it had its moments in the snow of actually
looking like pure cinema. Jacques Tourneur should be credited for making
this wartime propaganda piece into an acceptable action film, shunning
politics for a typical Hollywood wartime heroics and romance story. The
film presented new and unknown actors, and only one of them, in his
first motion picture, after appearing on the Broadway stage, Gregory
Peck, had any kind of star quality. He played Vladimir, a Soviet
commander of guerrillas during World War 11 fighting the Nazis. Tamara
Toumanova plays Nina, a beautiful Russian ballerina entertaining the
regular Russians troops during the German invasion of Russia in 1941,
who gets lost and winds up in Peck's underground bunker. While there,
she loses her pacifism, becomes a guerrilla, and romances Peck. In real
life, this aspiring actress was a Russian ballerina, who married the
producer/screenwriter Casey Robinson. Need I say more on how she got the
part! But to her credit, she handled the role decently.</P>
<P>This film was a ringing tribute to our wartime allies, the noble
Soviets. This would be a source of embarrassment in the coming years.
The film has fun with the guerrillas calling each other comrade at every
turn, and with glorifying the peasants and the efficiency of the Soviet
Army.</P>
<P>Nothing much happens for the guerrillas while waiting in their bunker,
except they spew out monologues about fighting for freedom and Mother
Russia, Yelena ventures out to shoot a couple of Nazis riding by on a
motorbike, the Samson-like Fedor offers some bunker humor, teenage
brother and sister, Mitya and Olga, commit themselves fully to the cause
and their commander, the guerrillas dynamite a German supply train,
capture and then kill a Nazi when he tries to escape, and, to add a
touch of comradeship, Semyon reads courageous stories to the men. He is
second in command, the intellectual among them; Peck in peace time was
an engineer, but now he destroys the things he used to build and is a
starry-eyed patriot (Communist).</P>
<P>What the guerrillas are waiting for in their bunker is for important
orders to come down from Russian headquarters, telling them they will be
part of the attack on the Nazis.</P>
<P>The film predictably plods along to its climax, as Nina delivers a
message to the Russian general in the field and he gives her a coded
message, which is the one Peck was waiting for, as he gets just as
excited about the message as he does about holding Nina in his arms.</P>
<P>Mitya becomes a hero, giving up his life so that the Nazis won't find
Peck. Later on, when  the Russians counter-attack and begin pushing the
Germans out of their homeland, Petrov gallantly blows up a German tank
while giving up his life to save the other guerrillas.</P>
<P>The film failed miserably with the critics and at the box office, but it
wasn't that bad...it even had a certain corny charm to it that some
might find appealing.</P>
