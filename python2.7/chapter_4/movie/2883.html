<PRE>                                  TIMECOP
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara.
Screenplay:  Mark Verheiden.
Director:  Peter Hyams.</P>
<P>     A muscular action hero with a thick accent stars in a science
fiction film about traveling into the past to change the future.  No,
I'm not talking about THE TERMINATOR, although I suspect the similarity
is more than coincidental.  Jean-Claude Van Damme has labored through
several virtually indistinguishable testosterone fests without
discovering his breakout hit, so TIMECOP must have seemed like the
perfect opportunity.  And it will probably do what it was intended to
do, expanding Van Damme's audience the way THE TERMINATOR expanded
Arnold Schwarzenegger's.  It's an energetic film that doesn't skimp on
the action, but it suffers from an over-convoluted storyline that
pushes the logic meter *way* into the red zone.</P>
<P>     Van Damme plays Max Walker, a Washington D.C. cop who is assigned
to a unique detail--the Time Enforcement Commission, instituted to
prevent abuses of the newly realized technology of time travel.  In
2004, Walker learns that a series of time travel "thefts" is connected
to the presidential campaign of Aaron McComb (Ron Silver), the U.S.
senator whose committee oversees the T.E.C.  As Walker follows McComb
through time, he finds himself presented with a time-altering
temptation of his own--preventing the death of his wife Melissa (Mia
Sara) in 1994.</P>
<P>     Volumes could be written about the slapdash and ultimately
self-contradictory treatment screenwriter Mark Verheiden (who also
co-created the comic book on which the film is based) gives to time
travel; sometimes it simply seems that he's making things up as he goes
along.  However, those are not the issues which hamper TIMECOP most.
There is more fundamental foolishness, like what exactly the T.E.C. has
been doing for ten years when it soon becomes clear that there is only
one other time machine in existence besides that which they use
themselves.  Either there has been an inordinate number of rogue
Timecops, or there was a spectacular level of stupidity involved in not
destroying the other machine.  Of course, this is a government agency
we are dealing with.  One also wonders why assassins from the future
can't be slightly less obtrusive than extras from THE ROAD WARRIOR.</P>
<P>     TIMECOP also stumbles with the inclusion of a female partner for
Walker, an internal affairs officer named Fielding (Gloria Reuben).
She is treated almost as an afterthought, an obligatory woman to occupy
the space between Mia Sara's scenes.  While Reuben is good working with
sketchy material, the character appears too late and disappears too
soon to leave any kind of impact on the story.  Everything about the
Fielding character feels contrived, sloppy and, worst of all,
completely unnecessary.</P>
<P>     The good news is that TIMECOP tends to work when everyone shuts up
and starts fighting.  Director Peter Hyams went a little nuts in the
editing room, making some of Van Damme's fight scenes look like they
were lit with a strobe, but they are mostly creative and well-
choreographed; only the final showdown drags on a bit.  The special
effects are sharp, and the computer-generated snap-back look to the
characters' movements through time is inventive and well-handled.  The
production values are generally impressive, and action fans will not be
too disappointed.</P>
<P>     The real pleasant surprise of TIMECOP turns out to be the acting
of Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Yes, that's right, I said acting.  Though
still sometimes difficult to understand through his Belgian accent, Van
Damme is an appealing performer who looks comfortable on screen,
something Steven Seagal has yet to accomplish.  TIMECOP isn't exactly a
demanding film for an actor, but Van Damme shows that he can provide
texture, something a bit more substantive than roundhouse kicks.  He
also gets to work off a suitably nasty villain in Ron Silver, who is
perfectly cast, and has a nice chemistry with the too-little-seen Mia
Sara.  It's too bad TIMECOP often feels bloated and preposterous,
because there's a bit of heart lurking beneath the hardware.  It's just
a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 time crimes:  5.</PRE>
