<P>BALL OF FIRE (1941) A remarkable, funny screwball variant of ³Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs.²  Linguist Gary Cooper and seven fuddy-duddy scholars
on a foundation grant, are cloistered in a mansion where they are preparing
an encyclopedia. Cooper ventures into the forbidding outside world to do
research on slang. He meets cabaret singer Sugarpuss O¹Shea (Barbara
Stanwyck) a gansgter¹s moll. The mob stashes her in the professors¹ house
and, to our great merriment, the outrageous follows the preposterous.
Little-known comedy was directed by the great Howard Hawks who worked in
all genres and who, like the flyers who flew by the seat of their pants in
so many of his aviation movies, had all the right instincts. Script by
Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. It is uncanny that Wilder, who had come
from Germany a few years before, could write such American and such slangy
dialogues. Cooper, who was just as versatile as Hawks and could play
anything from a romantic lovers to strong, silent men of action, shows
again what a marvelous comedian he was. He sometimes even looks like Johnny
Carson¹s Floyd Turbo character. Hawks remade the movie in 1948 as ³A Song
Is Born,² a musical version with Danny Kaye. (Edwin Jahiel)</P>
