<PRE>*sigh*  God what an awful movie...</PRE>
<P>Warning:  Some *minor* spoilers follow.  I'll try not to give away too
much plot, but I do have some things to say about certain aspects of
the movie....</P>
<P>     Let's start with the opening credits: Talk about product
placement!  Penny Marshall plays a game of "let's see how many major
labels we can fit in the first two mintues of the movie while still
looking like we're just trying to establish Chicago as the backdrop of
this film."</P>
<P>     If you've seen ON DEADLY GROUND (even if you haven't, you've
probably heard about the famous bit of dialogue), you remember
something along the lines of:  "How long will it take for man to learn
to be good?" says the good-guy.  "All I need is some time to change,"
replies the bad-guy.  Excuse me while I barf.  ON DEADLY GROUND pretty
much stuffed its morals down your throat.  If you've seen WITH HONORS,
you remember dialogue along the lines of, "Our Constitution was written
by good men who wanted to make sure that power is in the hands of the
people," etc., etc., etc....  Once again, Hollywood stuffs its morals
down your throat *so blatantly* that you don't have to read between
*any* lines to get the message!  Hollywood thinks we're all dumb!</P>
<P>     Well, once again, a movie comes out that is so in-your-face with
its message that no thinking is required at all.  This time, though,
the dialogue is as follows:</P>
<PRE>     Student: "Well if there's no grade for the test, do we get a
              prize?  Do we win a car?"
     Teacher (DeVito): "Yeah, there's a prize.  But it's not a prize you
              can drive.  It's not a prize you can buy.  It's not a prize
              you can touch.  It's a prize you can feel."</PRE>
<PRE>     PLEASE!!!!!!   The movie was just chock-full of all *sorts* of
cheesy lines like this!</PRE>
<P>     Danny DeVito is a teacher in the Army (I suppose I should have
mentioned that earlier, so you all would know what I'm talking about),
and a drill-sergeant is played by Gregory Hines.  Hines is a fine
actor, but is not used to his potential at all in this film, largely
because he was very miscast.  In a confrontation between Hines and
DeVito, DeVito manages to get Hines upset.  Hines lunges towards
DeVito, but it looks mostly like he just sorta wants to knock some
sense into him.  He is stopped before he even reaches DeVito, but
overall, Hines does not seem like a deadly character.  The very next
scene has DeVito talking to some high-ranking guy who says, "He could
have killed you.  He would have been court-martialed, but he could have
killed you."  Wait a minute!  Hines *never* looked like he wanted to
kill him!  Or even like he is the kind of person who *would* have
*ever* wanted to kill him!  ARGH!  So much about this movie frustrated
me!</P>
<P>     DeVito teaches HAMLET to a bunch of Army recruits who need to be
smart in order to pass military academy.  But it doesn't seem like they
really learned anything about grammar or any of the other areas in
which they lacked, just by reading HAMLET.  They just sort of liked the
story about incest, sex, and murder.  And if the entire plot revolved
around him teaching HAMLET, he could have at *least* taught it
*properly*!</P>
<P>     Penny Marshall is a wonderful director.  She doesn't do anything
too outlandish in any of her films, and the same is true for
RENAISSANCE MAN.  As usual, she is pretty straight-forward in her
story-telling.</P>
<P>     This film definitely has potential.  The script-writer (whoever
he/she/they may be) obviously knows a lot about comedy, because there
certainly were many comedic moments in the film.  Plenty of opportunity
to laugh out loud.  But they knew *nothing* about writing drama.  The
dramatic arts of the films were *way* poorly written.  It's a shame
that it didn't get a couple other drafts because it really could have
been good.</P>
<PRE>My rating, on a scale of, say, one to forty-three....
A ten...</PRE>
<PRE>I can't recommend it....</PRE>
<PRE>Sorry, Penny....</PRE>
