                           ACTION JACKSON
                    A film review by Andrew Hicks
                     Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1988) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies 
ACTION JACKSON, the only movie in Hollywood history to show 
Sharon Stone and Vanity topless within a span of ten minutes. This 
Carl "Apollo Creed" Weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs. 
evil establishment crook, and relies on all the '80s trappings, from the 
token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer. 
Somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs, although there 
is a curious lack of exploding boobs.</P>
<P>        Weathers is Action Jackson, a Detroit cop known for all 
sorts of crazy vigilante techniques. Speaking of one past criminal 
apprehension, Jackson's superior yells, "You tore his arm off!" Jackson 
replies, "He had a spare." Jackson has been busted down to a desk job 
because of past problems with auto manufacturer Dellaplane (Craig T. 
Nelson) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring 
Nelson. After hearing what Jackson thinks of him, Stone says, "I take 
it you're not one of Dellaplane's friends." "Not unless they changed the 
definition," Jackson glowers. And of course it turns out Stone is Mrs. 
Dellaplane. Faux pas, Jackson...</P>
<P>        Not everything is happy in Motown; people are being killed 
and Dellaplane has evil plans for the AWA. It's all up to Jackson to 
stop it, and his only lead lies in Vanity (not his own). Wherever she 
left off with Prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career 
advancement she picks up in ACTION JACKSON. She plays the 
heroin addict and chanteuse in Dellaplane's nightclub. After singing 
one particularly sultry number for him, she saunters over and 
complains, "I expected a standing ovation." He responds, "You're 
getting one," and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the 
time. Prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs... or at least the prince.</P>
<P>        It's a testament to the '80s that Sharon Stone is killed off 
within the first 30 minutes but Vanity survives the whole movie. 
ACTION JACKSON is another variation on the "unlikely partners" 
buddy action flick, with Jackson lugging junkie Vanity around. This 
leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade, and with the 
dialogue they're given, there's not much room for improvement. My 
favorite is when Vanity, feeling the effects of drug withdrawal, says, 
"I feel like my teeth are hollow, my gums are made of dry rubber and 
someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head." 
Jackson's response is, "I think I felt that way once. They called it 
love."</P>
<PRE>        You'll understand when I say watch this at your own risk.</PRE>
