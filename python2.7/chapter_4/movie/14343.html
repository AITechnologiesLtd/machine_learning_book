<P>   There was this song deservedly popular some time ago,
"You've gotta have heart/ Miles and miles of heart/ Oh, it's
fine to be a genius of course,/ But keep that old horse before
the cart,/ First you've gotta have heart."  Good lyrics. Catchy
tune.  When you try to develop the theme of these lines into a
two-hour+ movie, though, watch out.  As the professor
says in "One True Thing," "Less is more."  What's solid for
three minutes can be slender when extended.  A schmltz
throwback to Arthur Hiller's "Love Story," "One True Thing,"
based on the best-selling 1995 novel by Anna Quindlen, feels
out of place in a decade devoted to edgier, wittier family
dramas.  We could put up with yet another soap if it worked:
"Firelight" functioned because its principal performers, Sophie
Marceau, left us with a solid conviction of her passion for her
child and the man for whom she at first felt an unexpressed
attraction.  "One True Thing" lacks clarity about a singificant
discovery a daughter makes about her parents, is at times
difficult to believe, and trots out the usual gags about
klutziness that Diane Keaton underscored eleven years ago in
"Baby Boom."  What is most damaging is that the picture's
stated theme is not realized.  "One True Thing," about a
sharp, urban, 25-year-old journalist who returns to her mom
and dad's New England home for a few months, promises to
reveal to her a new consciousness about her parents.  While
she learns that her mom is a bit more noble than she thought
and her dad is not the benevolent hero of her childhood
fantasies, she doesn't come away with a whole lot of new
perceptions about the sorts of people her folks really are.</P>
<P>   Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), a chip off her dad's block
but not at all like her mom, is an ambitious investigative
journalist for the hip, upscale "New York" magazine.  She
leaves her Manhattan digs for what she thinks is a quick
birthday celebration for her New-England based father,
George (William Hurt). She is commanded by this prickly 55-
year-old to take a sabbatical from her job because her
mother, Kate (Meryl Streep), has cancer and will need Ellen's
help and presence.  Whimpering at first that her career will be
jettisoned by such a visit, she must accept her father's lame
excuse that he simply cannot take a sabbatical at this time
from his job as Am Lit professor in a top college.  "You have
a Harvard education," he reminds her in a guilt-tripping
rebuke, "But where is your heart?"  </P>
<P>   While trying without much success to keep up with her
writing via phone conversations with her young, Yuppie-ish
editor, she becomes increasingly engulfed in the day-to-day
tasks of caring for her mother's spiraling illness, but not
before she sees the 48-year-old Kate as a woman who may
be tradition-bound but devotes much of her time to
fundraising and contributing her energy to good, community
causes.  Gaining new admiration for Kate, she is
disillusioned by what she perceives as her dad's womanizing
with his students, his hidden alcoholism, his shirking of
responsibilities toward the deteriorating woman.  In the
movie's climactic scene, Kate delivers a monologue of
Shakespearean proportions to her daughter, criticizing the
young woman's judgmental temperament, instructing her in no
uncertain terms that her standards are impossibly high and
that "when you're married a long time, you make
concessions."</P>
<P>   For all its histrionics, the manifesto is lifted above the banal
only by Meryl Streep's remarkable abilities as a performer. 
Instead of walking out on her less-than-ideal husband as she
did in nineteen years ago in Robert Benton's "Kramer vs.
Kramer," she has made her peace with a man whose
position of authority has fashioned him into a pompous ass
who breezily gives the same fatuous advice not only to
students in the tutorials but to his own daughter, who is eager
for genuine criticism of her writing.  Karen Croner's script is
virtually bereft of humor and wit, the only amusement aside
from burned roasts coming from crossed wires near its
conclusion when Ellen, devastated at her mother's funeral,
tearfully tells her cheating boy friend "I never knew I could
miss someone so much," to which the guy replies, "I missed
you too."  The film's frame, a conference between Ellen and
an assistant D.A. (James Eckhouse) to which we return from
time to time, is not believable.  Since the immediate cause of
Kate's death was an overdose of morphine, the D.A. is going
through the motions of hearing Ellen's side of the story.  The
informal testimony becomes the vehicle for Ellen to narrate
the entire tale, which takes her back to her father-
worshipping childhood.  The conference seems more like an
extended psychoanalytic session: what public official would
take the time to hear the story in a well-appointed office,
shades discretely drawn, without the presence of an attorney
or a tape recorder?</P>
<P>   Let's admit it.  We go to "One True Thing" not for the story. 
We've heard it all before and we're not expecting to break
open the box of Kleenex this time.  We're here for the acting,
and we get it.  Meryl Streep can do no wrong, transforming
herself from a pliant, Ibsen-esque doll to an image of death
itself, and Bill Hurt plays out his underwritten role as
pretentious professor (is he or isn't he having an
affair?).  The movie belongs to the remarkable Renne
Zellweger, who turns in a performance as astonishing as she
did in her role in one of this year's best-acted films, Boaz
Yakim's "A Price Above Rubies."  She emerges as the film's
one true thing.</P>
