<PRE>.                                   ANTZ
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Every ant has his day.  At least, that's what Woody Allen would
have you think, in this twisted animated version of ANNIE HALL meets
BRAZIL.  Starting with a moody grass-scape of what turns out to be a
quiet corner of Central Park, voiced-over by Allen's `Z', a hapless
worker ant who feels the weight of the colony--so to speak--on his back,
ANTZ tracks a lot like any Allen flick.</P>
<P>     In fact, if it wasn't for all the forumla-driven bad guys, perilous
situations, and narrow escapes, ANTZ would be *exactly* like any other
Allen film.  But this is animation, and that means kid-pleasing effects
must plaster the screen.  Sadly, this hurts the story to the point where
ANTZ will quickly get lost in the shuffle of animated films coming out
over the next year, despite its unique touches.  To make matters worse,
some of the more gruesome scenes, including an ant-termite battle that
would leave Private Ryan wetting himself, are decidedly not for
children.</P>
<P>     Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  And if the
humdrum trailer for A BUG'S LIFE is any indication, ANTZ is going to be
the best we'll see out of computer animation for awhile, at least until
TOY STORY 2.  But, to paraphrase Z himself, a boy-meets-girl,
boy-loses-girl, boy-changes-underlying-social-structure movie... just
isn't that original.  Even if it is about ants.</P>
<P>     More story, less silly antics.  Maybe then I'll be inclined to put
down my can of Raid....</P>
