<PRE>THE OMEN (1976)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Donner
Writer: David Seltzer
Starring: Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Harvey
Stephens, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, Holly Palance, Leo McKern</P>
<P>"The Omen" is a scary enough for anyone who has every read anything out of
the bible and was suddenly worried that it may come true someday.  It's
especially aimed at those who take everything that the bible says
literally, especially the book of Revelations, which predicts exactly how
armageddom will take place, including the rise of the antichrist, the son
of the devil (if you didn't already know that).  Apparently screenwriter
David Seltzer and director Richard Donner were influenced by these passages
when they were a kid and decided, hey, let's make a horror flick out of
them.</P>
<P>And so here's "The Omen," a horror film that's the first in a trilogy
(actually, there's four, but few count the fourth one, as it was a TV movie
that had little to do with the first three) about the rise and fall of
Damien, the antichrist.  And surprisingly enough, this first one is a very
effective little picture, filled with just the right amount of melodrama
and enough frights, chills, and little bits of intrigue to make it an
extremely watchable and even creepy film.</P>
<P>"The Omen" opens on June 6 in Rome (the date and locale are actually
important) where we meet Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), the US Ambassador to
Italy who rushes to the local hospital to witness his wife, Katherine (Lee
Remick), give birth.  However, she has a stillborn, and while under, the
priest there makes a deal with him: they switch his dead child with an
orphan child just born there as well.  He accepts, and little Damien
(played by the eerily adorable Harvey Stephens...who never made another
film before or after this one) comes home with them.</P>
<P>Five years pass, and just when everything is going right, Damien's nanny
(Holly Palance, daughter of Jack) commits a dramatic suicide, which becomes
the first in a series of murders that occur throughout the film.  Upon
getting a new nanny (Billy Whitelaw) without much trouble, things turn
really weird, as Robert is hounded by a raving priest (Patrick Troughton)
who warns him about Damien, and begins to get friendly tips from a local
member of the papparazzi, Jennings (David Warner), that proves that
something is indeed afowl.</P>
<P>Evenly paced, this film starts out with little scares and overly-dramatic
scenes, like one where they try to take Damien to church for the first time
(uh oh!), and then moves on to introducing more and more elements into the
storyline.  The film begins to really take off as Robert is made more and
more aware of the terrible threat he has on his hands.  It seems that every
layer that is pulled back on the story unearths even more vital danger, and
the film becomes a rollar coaster ride of suspense, just because of how
much knowledge is unearthed.</P>
<P>The director Richard Donner constantly keeps things moving, and gives many
of the sequences an extremely dramatic feel, especially several of the
murder sequences (of which there are a number of), which wreak of slow-mo
shots, quick editing, and Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score, which
features angelic choirs underscoring the satanic overtones on the screen
and builds up the right amount of adrenalin and shock value for the
audience.  Yes, they're overdone, but it works just right for this film,
which is basically an overdone version of the nastier parts of the Holy
Scriptures.</P>
<P>Essentially, this is an intelligent film.  It knows that many of the
audience members are probably aquainted with the inner workings of the
bible, and how much of Revelations is used to scare us from sinning, and it
knows exactly how to prey on this general fear.  It reads several of the
passages, and deciphers them literally, often pointing out that many of the
things that Revelations talks of has probably already happened.  For anyone
who is either a regular churchgoer or was forced to go (like me), this is
especially scary because if Christians actually believe what they worship,
this is something that could really happen.</P>
<P>For others, it's just a really fun horror film, filled with joyously
manipulative undertones of Christian fear that we may or may not believe
in.  But even if we're not scared by it all and just feel cheated by it, we
can always recognize the underlying intelligence this film has, in that the
character Damien is unaware of his evil powers, at least in this
installment of the "Omen" trilogy.  If the trilogy had expanded on some of
the ideas that were postulated by this film, it could have come off as a
cross between a slasher film and a reverse version of Martin Scorsese's
"The Last Temptation of Christ," which postulated that Jesus may have been
just a man who found out he had a terrible burden.  What if Damien is the
same way?  What if he's generally evil, like the way Jesus was generally
good, but he discovers that he's going to bring about the end of the world
and people are trying to kill him left and right?  Now there's an idea for
a movie.  But as far as this film is concerned, it's entertaining and scary
enough to pass for now.</P>
