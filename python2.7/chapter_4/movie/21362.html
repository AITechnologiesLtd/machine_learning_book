<P>Don't be ashamed if you think of your marriage or relationship during
segments of `The Story of Us'. Although his presentation is problematic,
director Rob Reiner successfully navigates a mine field of clichés to
deliver a truthful and touching romance. Some may argue that the
constant, hateful bickering of the two main characters is depressing to
watch transpire. But, surprisingly, it does wonders for the one vital
element that a successful romance requires: realism.</P>
<P>`The Story of Us' is the story of Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis &
Michelle Pfeiffer), a separated couple who have reached the crucial
juncture of contemplating divorce. He's an accomplished writer, she's a
crossword puzzle creator - and over the course of a rocky 15-year
marriage, both have grown apart from each other. The only reason Ben and
Katie remain bonded by marriage is their two children. Even though they
have lost the spark that once lit their relationship, both want to avoid
leaving an entire family in devastated ruins due to their unfortunate
inadequacies.</P>
<P>Out of the gate, substantial problems surface for Reiner & company. Ben
and Katie talk directly to the camera in personal monologues to share
their separate, opinionated views. We've all become accustomed to this
approach, haven't we? But just as `The Story of Us' seems destined for
failure, Reiner straps us in and provides an overwhelming roller-coaster
of emotions. The most surprising thing is that these emotions seem
genuine and heartfelt, and not manipulative or preachy. We laugh and cry
along with these characters, because if we were placed in a similar
situation, our actions would not be indifferent. If this is a strategic
form of manipulation, then it is effective and impressively disguised.</P>
<P>Chalk down another point for Bruce Willis, who delivers his second
excellent performance of 1999 (the first was his restrained, effective
execution in `The Sixth Sense'). Give the man, who is normally
accustomed to firing machine guns and thwarting evil terrorists, due
credit for flexing his dramatic muscles with such success (just for the
record, Willis also gave a strong performance as an imaginary pink bunny
in Reiner's abysmal orphan comedy `North'). Pfeiffer is equally
wonderful, despite the glaring fact that her character does not possess
the clear, accentuated definition that Ben does. Both actors have
lovely, touching instances of understated power - each breaking through
the threshold to truthfully capture a moment in time. These brief
seconds are so well realized that they make `The Story of Us' worthwhile
as a whole.</P>
<P>What are these instances? Well, Willis has a knockout scene in which he
boils over with rage in a restaraunt, and Pfeiffer deals a climactic
speech that brought teary eyes to the majority of viewers at the
screening I attended. As good friends of the Jordan's, Rob Reiner and
Rita Wilson are highly amusing and compatible together, but the talented
Paul Reiser (as Ben's agent) gets cornered with the film's worst
material. There's an early drought that slips into unfunny, perverse
humor, but `The Story of Us' gradually develops into a real charmer.</P>
<P>Reiner has dealt with similar material before, namely the acclaimed
romance `When Harry Met Sally'. There's wonderful assurance behind some
of the crucial scenes, even if it feels strangely minor and trifling.
What it all comes down to is a credible, amusing and affecting tale of
two `real' people negotiating themselves through a `real' situation. If
Reiner breaks any rules, it has to be the questionable finale. But the
actors do so well painting an accurate portrait of a tumultuous
separation that it actually seems to work. It's hard to pull something
like that off, folks.</P>
<P>If you have the hankering for a phony, artificial romance - the
happily-ever-after type - stay away from `The Story of Us'. This is the
real dirt on the study of romance.</P>
