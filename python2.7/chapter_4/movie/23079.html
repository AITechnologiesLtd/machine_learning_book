<P>The Diva and I have an unwritten agreement for our 3BC reviews: she 
watches all the scary movies - I can't handle them at all, as evidenced 
in my reaction to The Bone Collector- and I, in turn, go to the assorted 
kiddie fare.  It's been a fair trade so far, but the downside, for my 
part, is that as an adult without small children to use as "cover", I 
feel kinda silly going to see these kid flicks.  "Toy Story 2" 
notwithstanding, I realized early on that the ongoing struggle I'd have 
would be to temper my natural inclination toward expecting Greatness 
from each and every movie I watch, with the understanding that some 
things just aren't written for old fogies like me.  That in mind, I was 
almost sure that I'd be watching a movie that I'd be making lots of 
allowances for in the end.</P>
<P>That said, a funny thing happened on the way to the end of "The Tigger 
Movie" ...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
In this animated rendition of A.A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" stories, 
narrated by John Hurt, Winnie The Pooh bear (voice of Jim Cummings) 
takes a back seat to Tigger (voice of Jim Cummings).  Tigger is an 
extroverted tiger who bounces his way in and out of the hearts of his 
friends Pooh, Eeyore the donkey (Peter Cullen), Piglet (John Fiedler), 
Rabbit (Ken Sansom), Owl (Andre Stojka), the human boy Christopher Robin 
(Tom Attenborough), kangaroo Kanga (Kathy Soucie), and especially 
Kanga's son Roo (Nikita Hopkins), who looks up to his good friend Tigger 
as a big brother.  Tigger's habit of joyfully bouncing all over the 
place irks the serious Rabbit and tires everyone but Roo out, but Tigger 
doesn't let them steal his joy for long.  But his joy over being "the 
only Tigger" turns to sadness when he realizes that being the only one, 
means he's without a family; seeing him so sad distresses Roo, who 
enlists Pooh bear and the others to help him find Tigger's family - with 
potentially disastrous results...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
There's a cartoon strip called Calvin And Hobbes that, like this movie, 
features a tiger (Hobbes) as one of the main characters (but unlike 
Christopher Robin from the "Winnie The Pooh" books and movies, the human 
Calvin is an at times bratty and irritating, though almost always funny, 
perpetually 8-year-old boy).  The first few times I read that cartoon 
strip (mind you, as an adult), I found it incredibly dumb; for the life 
of me, I couldn't figure out what could possibly be so funny about the 
little jerk, and why he had a tiger, of all things, following him 
around, doing equally jerky things to neighbor Suzie and to Calvin's 
parents.  It made absolutely no sense to me, and I was just about to 
write it off as a loss, till one day the paper ran a strip in which 
Calvin was going on vacation with his parents, and had Hobbes in the 
back seat with him - and Hobbes was shown to be a stuffed toy tiger.  
Could'a knocked me over with a feather; up to that point, I had no idea 
that the "live" Hobbes existed only in Calvin's vivid (as it was by then 
made clear to me) imagination.  That single strip not only revealed new 
layers of Calvin (and Hobbes) to me, it also taught me a lesson the 
likes of which the phrase "never judge a book by its cover" could never 
do in its staticness.</P>
<P>I had a similar reaction at one point during "The Tigger Movie": there I 
was, only halfway watching this flick, really thinking ahead to the time 
when I'd get home, get this review out of the way, and get some 
much-needed sleep - then seemingly out of nowhere, I had one of those 
"aha!" moments where things suddenly became incredibly clear to me.  
Maybe it was just a single word spoken; more likely, it happened during 
one of the scenes when the on-screen pages of the book turned as if 
narrator John Hurt was a father reading the story to his children - and 
I was transported back to a place in time where Winnie The Pooh, Tigger, 
Eeyore, and Christopher Robin were as real to me as Hobbes was to 
Calvin.  And as silly as it sounds, that "aha!" moment washed over me 
and made the movie come alive.  It was quite a cool Moment for me; I 
wasn't able to hold on to it as long as I would've liked, but it stayed 
with me long enough to make a difference in the way I watched "Tigger".   
And the best thing about the Great Revelation was, it allowed me to be 
comfortable in the knowledge that even if the 37-year-old me couldn't 
totally relax and let this children's movie be a children's movie 
without the added tres cool wink-nudges that more sophisticated fare 
like "Toy Story 2" had built-in, at least the kid me could appreciate 
the memories of the simple lessons about what family really is, that can 
be be found in "Tigger" and the like.</P>
<P>Once I recovered (mostly) from the "aha!", I was able to sit back and 
enjoy the ride with less distraction (except for the rather loud, but 
cute, kids surrounding me).  Before the Great Revelation, "Tigger" 
seemed to be a fairly run-of-the-mill, not very well-drawn cartoon that 
seemed better suited for viewing on TV; that feeling didn't change much 
- I still believe that it didn't really need to be a theatrical release 
- but the issue no longer was reason enough to not enjoy the movie for 
what it had to offer.  Though most of the Obligatory Disney Songs (and 
what's a Disney movie without Obligatory Disney Songs?) made me stir in 
my seat a few times, I found myself enjoying Tigger's big production 
number; it actually tied in with the general theme of the movie, without 
feeling like a forced fit.  And though its comparatively "primitive" 
artwork can't compete with TS2 in the eye candy department (except for 
one noticeably beautiful shot when the sun shines directly on Tigger as 
he and Roo travel through the 100 Acre Wood), that same primitive look 
is faithful to the artwork we've seen countless times during "Winnie The 
Pooh" TV specials.  Overall, the nostalgic flavor that came with the 
look of "Tigger", worked in its favor.</P>
<P>It's fairly evident that "The Tigger Movie" was probably destined for 
direct-to-video release before other recent animated movies got boffo 
box office results; Hollywood execs, after all, are not known for 
passing up potential bankrolls if they can help it.  And though the 
quality of this movie, from both a graphical standpoint as well as in 
its storyline, isn't quite up to the level of TS2, its lack of 
sophistication, nuance, and "inside gags" didn't stop me from enjoying 
"Tigger" for what it was.  In fact, its honest simplicity made me 
appreciate it for exactly that; the bouncy Tigger, scatterbrained Pooh, 
hilariously deadpan Eeyore, and sweetly vulnerable Roo, wouldn't have 
been the same had they been written as more adult-friendly characters.  
Kids of all ages will appreciate that--but only if they're kids at heart.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Too often, adults let our adulthood get in the way of a good 
old-fashioned bounce (though the way I heard it was, Tiggers Pounce.  
But that's just semantics, I reckon).  Sometimes it's best to drop the 
mask of sophistication and just let a lullaby be a lullaby; sometimes, 
simple *is* better.  To be sure, "The Tigger Movie" was no "Toy Story 
2".  It wasn't really even a "Stuart Little" (as cloying as *that* 
similarly-themed movie was, it did have its Moments).  But maybe that's 
as it should be; there's gotta be room in this world for a Pouncing 
Tigger - and a Roo who loves him - right?</P>
<P>"The Tigger Movie" (rating: greenlight):
Tiggers Pounce.  I can diggit.</P>
