<PRE>                                  THE DOORS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     Oliver Stone and Val Kilmer have done it, they have captured
perfectly the feel of my Sixties in the new film THE DOORS, a film which
will surely be on many ten-best lists come December and which ought to
be in for several important Academy nominations unless the curse of
spring release strikes again.</P>
<P>     Stone has always shown the most amazing talent for recreating the
look and feel of that turbulent time, as he did in PLATOON and BORN ON
THE FOURTH OF JULY.  But Stone's movies have always been flawed by what
a friendly reviewer might see as an excess of zeal and an unfriendly one
as the sledge-hammer approach to making a point.  But, unlike his
earlier films, THE DOORS does not seem to have a political point it
wants to drive home above all other considerations; it definitely lacks
Stone's usual smug superiority and instead concentrates on making Jim
Morrison live for us again in the form of Val Kilmer.  </P>
<P>     Val Kilmer is the second actor this late winter/early spring who
absolutely must be nominated for an Academy Award (the other being
Anthony Hopkins in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS).  What price did Kilmer
have to pay to so perfectly become the driven, visionary, besotted
Morrison, the Bacchus and Orpheus of many in my generation?  I was
impressed the last time I saw Kilmer, in a little film noir about a
failing detective who gets involved with a devious thief and murderer
played by his wife Joyce Whalley-Kilmer.  I had no notion of what the
man was capable of as an actor.  What he does by way of becoming
Morrison goes beyond acting into black magic.  He looks like Morrison,
he sounds like Morrison even to doing  Morrison's vocals on top of the
original Doors' instrumental tracks, he moves like Morrison.  He scares
us and disgusts us and fascinates us even as Jim Morrison did.</P>
<P>     The film takes a mostly unblinking look at the demon that drove
Morrison.  It offers no insights or answers.  It merely says this is him
in action, make what you will of it.  Unfortunately, one result is that
the other Doors are unfairly neglected, especially Ray Manzarek, played
here by Kyle MacLachlan; Manzarek was probably the unindicted
co-conspirator who as much as Morrison made the unique and unnerving
Doors sound.  The other two Doors were Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley,
Joyce's brother(?)) and John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), both of whom play
rather minor roles.</P>
<P>     Morrison is important as an artist in his own right, but for the
movie his significance is that of the supreme type, the very summation
and embodiment, of the Sixties rock culture.  He is a cultural icon and
as such is as mixed a bag as my own memories of those times--terror and
ecstasy, living on the edge and barely conscious, all at the same time.
We see and judge Morrison and the times on the strength of the music,
the words, the actions, the script, the photography, and the sound
track.  </P>
<P>     Stone and J. Randal Johnson wrote a wonderful script that 
captures the essence fully and honestly.  The script gives exactly the
right moments we need.  The pacing makes the 135-minute running time
both timeless and instantaneous--exactly the way I used to perceive or
be deceived by time when I was stoned on acid in those days.</P>
<P>     The music is in some ways the story and Densmore and Krieger were
involved creatively in the making of the movie, I note.  There are 28
Doors songs in the sound track (and a heavy promotion in the music
stores).  The concert scenes are perfect.  I sat there in the dark
saying Yes, this is the way it was, this is how it felt.</P>
<P>     As for the photography, it is bold, imaginative, and innovative.
Like the concerts, the drug trips are real, exactly right.  It's taken
more than two decades since Hollywood started trying to film a trip
before someone got it right; even the trips in EASY RIDER fail to
convince and evoke the way these do.  And then there are the
hallucinogenic figures that accompany Morrison, his shaman, the bald
figure, enigmatic, suggestive, seen only by Morrison and us and maybe
once by Pam Morrison, played wonderfully well by Meg Ryan, who has never
been one of my personal faves--until now.  The film's attitude to drugs
and to alcohol, for Morrison was an alcoholic as much as a druggie, is
accepting without being approving; these people were stoned more or less
all the time and it killed some of them.  But whether Morrison could
have been Morrison without them is not a question the movie is
interested in.</P>
<P>     Will THE DOORS speak to people who weren't hippies and/or Doors
fans?  I suspect it will.  For people like me, it speaks loudly and
clearly.  I recommend this movie to everyone except those who cannot
tolerate rough language, sex, drug use, and/or frontal nudity in their
films or their lives.</P>
