<PRE>October Sky
Directed by Joe Johnston
Starring Jake Gylenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern
Rated PG (some sensuality, violence, and language)</PRE>
<P>Today, most of the teenage flicks are about high schoolers getting into
grotesque, drunken situations involving sex, drugs, booze, and
violence.  While Welcome to the Dollhouse did it all sensibly,
Jawbreaker, Varsity Blues, and the like are all examples of the
teen-flick norm today.  Out of this junk comes a movie based on a true
story and while it isn't exceptional or particularly fresh, it is a
great change of pace from the ultimately drab and cynical movies that
are coming out of the studios aiming for teenage audiences.  The story
feels old and used, but it is moving.  I admit to not wanting to see
this movie- the commercials promised melodrama.  While October Sky is
melodrama, it is better than most because its intentions are good   At
the end, the drama is overdone, but its emotion is sufficient.  Maybe
I'm praising October Sky because I'm sick of what the usual teenage
movie has to offer.  The movie isn't exactly master filmmaking, it
sometimes falls into the Ditch of Melodrama Normalcy, and Laura Dern
doesn't do anything I can perceive as strong.  I'll know in a few years
time when I look back on this film.  Right now, I can't deny that I was
uplifted and enjoyed the story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gylenhaal), a young
man aspiring for the stars.</P>
<P>October Sky centers on Homer, who is surrounded by a small town and
narrow-minded townsfolk.  With the sight of Sputnik, a Cold War
milestone, Homer has become interested in rockets and science.  His
father (Chris Cooper in a fine performance) is both disappointed and
angry that his son is interested in these subjects.  Young men in this
town stay there, unless they get a football scholarship elsewhere.  It
has always been tradition for the men to work in the coal mines.  Homer
looks at the mine as the Place of Evil and Blackness- when his father
gets sick in the middle of the film and he must take over his job and go
down into the mines, the look on his face shows more than reluctance- he
looks up into the sky as if his father and God have betrayed him.</P>
<P>Urged on by his teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern), Homer convinces his
friends Roy Lee, O'Dell, and a science nerd, Quentin to help him make a
rocket that would be Science Fair potential.  This rocket may be their
ticket out of the crumminess of their native town.  Homer, a boy who's
math grades are waning, is the most determined of the group- he studies
trigonometry and all sorts of math subjects to help in his building of
the rocket.  There is a fire in his eye when he feels his rocket will
blast off into space.  His hopes for entering the Science Fair are
dashed by the discovery that his rocket may have lit a forest fire.  The
fire in his eyes dies and he succumbs to his parents' wishes- he works
in the mines.</P>
<P>I saw this movie in the dollar theater and there was a wretched man
screaming at the top of his lungs "jerk" whenever Homer's father had a
disagreement with him.  The script and Chris Cooper, thank heaven, don't
make Homer's dad a stereotype-bad-guy-underestimating-parent, but a man
confused by new thoughts, like Topol in Fiddler on the Roof, or Rock
Hudson in Giant.  He wants the best for his son- but he wants the best
on his terms.  He believes that people should stick with what is normal,
what is common and ordinary and you can't blame him.  We can't always
understand him when he so cruelly represses  Homer's dreams of
rocketry.  His fights with Homer usually don't go beyond
mainstream-movie father-son arguments- it is usually when they're not
fighting that the film succeeds.  There is an especially stirring scene
in which Homer asks his father to come to one of the rocket launches.
His father doesn't want to, in any way, support this ambition of his
son's, but he doesn't want to let his son down.  There is no screaming
or shouting, just an uneasiness about the scene.</P>
<P>The later brawls between Homer and his father are what you would expect-
an exchange of "You wanna get out of this town so bad, then go!" and
"Yeah, I'll go, and I won't even look back!"  These scenes have their
emotional qualities, but they're primitively done, not that I expected
something on the lines of Orson Welles.  The movie gets you in such a
mood that, when it finally ends: when the father and son finally
connect, when the whole town pitches in to help Homer win the fair,
you're elated by this young man's strength- the fact that he broke
through the barriers set by parents and townspeople and mediocrity, the
barriers many people never cross, the barriers I bet Homer's father
wished he had crossed.  When October Sky is bad, it assaults us (maybe
‘assault' is a bit too strong) with its lack of ambition and its
ordinariness, and that is why I don't always admire it.</P>
<P>Homer Hickam now lives in Cape Canaveral training astronauts for NASA.
October Sky is not about rocketry, but about facing obstacles and
beating the odds against you.   I wish more kids had seen it.  The only
people I saw in the theater were senior citizens.  The movie has lots of
heart and good intentions and I wish people could see this instead of
the uncouth and presumptuous trash that brings the execs the dough
nowadays.</P>
