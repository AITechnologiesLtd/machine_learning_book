<P>   One of the miracles of the movies is that they can take us
to unfamiliar places, locations and states of mind that we
would not be able to reach under our own power.  Yet you
can't deny that there's a comfort to watching films about
neighborhoods with which we're familiar and people who look,
think and act mostly like us.  "Liberty Heights" is particularly
appealing to me for this latter reason, displaying
performances by people who came of age at the time I did
and belong to the religious faith with which I identify.  In my
Brooklyn community of Borough Park, everyone was Jewish,
or, everyone except Jo Jo Carlino who lived across the street
and who acknowledged that he hung out only with Jewish
kids.  Though we might never circumnavigate the globe,
every guy suffered the embarrassment of the bris early on
and every kid suffered bar mitzvah lessons at the appropriate
age.  No wonder I could look at "Liberty Heights" and remark,
"Hey, that's me up there on the screen!" </P>
<P>   Barry Levinson, best known for his series of movies about
growing up in Baltimore, now presents the fourth in that
progression.  Few other directors can match Levinson's feel
for the grit and humor and pathos of medium-sized
metropolises that have none of the plastic ambiance of L.A. 
Nor can most others compete with his affection for the flawed
residents of these areas.  His "Diner" was about young
people hanging around with one another, but "Liberty
Heights" has an added dimension, a greater resonance. 
Most people who did not live through the period think of the
fifties era of this movie as the dull decade, embracing an
America that needed the sort of liberation granted to it by the
characters David and Jennifer in Gary Ross's"Pleasantville." 
Looked as a safe and secure but altogether hokey Father
Knows Best/Ozzie-and-Harriet period, the fifties were actually
a prelude to the more dramatic and often violent civil rights
movement of the sixties, all brought to a vehement head by
the Vietnam War (memorialized in Levinson's "Good Morning,
Vietnam").  The Supreme Court decision in 1954 calling for
the integration of all public schools may not have succeeded
to this day in combining the races in the field of education,
but it was the foot in the door that got many people of diverse
races, religions and ethnic groups out of their enclaves to
make the first gingerly steps toward mixing and getting to
know one another.</P>
<P>   In 1954 Levinson was twenty-two, just a few years older
than the folks he focuses upon in "Liberty Heights."  As the
film's editor, Stu Linder, keenly binds together several
divergent scenes, moving back and forth and yet always
clearly showing the relationships of the people photographed
by Chris Doyle, we look in on the lives of some Jewish kids
who hang out, speculating as persons their age have always
done about young women, and making the first steps toward
learning about those of other cultures.  Traveling to Europe
and cross-country was not yet in fashion, so to the
Kurtzmans who lived in the Liberty Heights section of
Baltimore, the whole world was Jewish.  </P>
<P>   Levinson sets the comic tone for the piece with a
succession of shticks before settling into a deeper, though
generally light tone.  We are introduced to the provincial
Bubby of the family, Rose (Frania Rubinek), parents Ada and
Nate Kurtzman (Bebe Neuwirth and Joe Mantegna) and to
their children Van (Adrien Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster).  Ada
indoctrinates her kids that gentiles are "the other kind,"
allowing us to make obvious inferences that "the other kind"
must refer to Jews as "the other kind" as well. In fact the
youngsters soon take note of the outside world when they
see a sign on a country club fence just outside their
neighborhood, "No Jews, Dogs or Colored Allowed."  When
the fellas attend a Halloween party in the other section of
town, Van is fascinated by his view of "shiksa goddess,"
Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy) dressed in a Cinderella costume. 
Through an unusual, somewhat contrived turn of events,
Dubbie's WASP boy friend, Trey (Justin Chambers), sets the
stage for the two to meet and date.  But the more fascinating
tale involves the tentative courtship of Ben with the first black
student he had seen in his classes, Sylvia (Rebekah
Johnson), a young woman who defies all of Ben's
stereotypical attitudes toward "Negroes."  </P>
<P>   In a separate development of this interwoven yet
wonderfully linked story, Van and Ben's dad, Nate, is affected
by the changes of the fifties in a more lamentable way. 
Burlesque is dying out.  The strip-tease house he owns is
going under and what's more, the numbers racket that he
controls suffers a cataclysmic loss that threatens the entire
future of his family, as Little Melvin (Orlando Jones) is about
to take over the remainder of Nate's livelihood.</P>
<P>   "Liberty Heights" stands out not only because of its
uncanny ability to capture a turning point in America's social
history but because Levinson, aided by ace cameraman
Doyle, captures some sensational scenery: a full house
attending a Rosh Hashanah service in the neighborhood
synagogue featuring the mellifluous tones of a Baltimore
cantor; a rollicking concert in the local theater featuring soul
idol James Brown (Carlton J. Smith), which introduces Ben
and his friend Sheldon (Evan Newman) to stirring music with
which they had no familiarity; even a terrific strip-tease on the
stage of Nate's burlesque house highlighting an exotic dancer
who goes further than her boss would have liked her to go.</P>
<P>   The fifties are shown as a time that a mere conversation
between a white boy and a black girl could be a topic of
gossip, and any fraternizing between the races would be the
subject of chastisement by unliberated parents of both
groups.  For all his education, even Sylvia's dad, a
prosperous physician, is horrified by the thought that his
daughter invites a young white man to his home simply to
listen to records.  </P>
<P>   Andrea Morricone's score of 40 the great popular songs of
the era punctuates on-target performances by rising star
Adrien Brody (who took on an altogether more sinister role in
Richard Shepard's not-to-be-missed "Oxygen") and a
terrifically believable chemistry between Rebekah Johnson
and Ben Foster as the daring duo of inter-racial friendship. 
David Krumholtz as Yussel, another of the Kurtzmans'
friends, pumps up the humor, particularly when he attends a
WASP party with bleached-blond hair and cons a gentile girl
into thinking that his father and mother, from Norway and
Denmark, met and married in Sweden.  "Liberty Heights" is
an all-around rollicking piece of entertainment.</P>
