<PRE>                            SECRETS AND LIES
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1996 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>'Secrets and Lies', the latest film from Mike Leigh, is a complex story 
built around a simple theme.  It asks how effectively we can live behind 
secrets, and looks at how little we might actually know about others in 
our own family.  Its message, if it has one, is that openness helps - 
even if it's painful, and that even when the truth is ugly we're better 
for knowing it.</P>
<P>It centres around three households in very different parts of London: a 
young, black, single woman working as an optometrist, an upwardly mobile 
photographer and his wife, and a mother and her road-sweeper daughter 
living in a tiny, run-down, terraced house.  All are connected, though to 
say why would be to give away too much of the film.</P>
<P>Like all Mike Leigh's films, this one was built up using improvisation.  
But its plot has a direction and a coherence which belie the method used 
to create it.  There are points where Mike Leigh plays tricks on the 
audience, sometimes by involving us in the deceit that's at the centre of 
the film, sometimes by presenting us with scenes which may, or may not, 
be significant in the rest of the narrative.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the strongest dynamics in the film are between the women; 
even though the photographer is an important part, he acts as a foil to 
the other characters' arguments, most effectively while serving the meat 
from a barbecue.  All the performances and characterisations are good - 
and the actors have resisted the temptation to develop into caricatures. 
 Marianne Jean-Baptiste, as Hortense, the optometrist with the incredibly 
mobile face, and Brenda Blethyn as Cynthia, the nervous single mother 
both excel, but Timothy Spall as the photographer, and Phyllis Logan as 
his prim, obsessive, wife are also good.</P>
<P>Throughout the film there are incidents which touch on the themes of 
truth and honesty, moments where you wonder whether characters are 
telling the truth or not.  What about the photographer's client who 
ascribes her facial injuries to the seat belt breaking in a car accident 
(she needs the picture to claim compensation)?  And do we believe 
Hortense's friend who brags in the kitchen about her sexual exploits?</P>
<P>'Secrets and Lies' opens this week in the UK, and the interest that it 
generated at Cannes should ensure a reasonable international release.  At 
a preview this weekend, the audience broke into a spontaneous round of 
applause as the credits rolled, applause which was well deserved.</P>
