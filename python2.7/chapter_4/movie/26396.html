<P>   Someday we'll get a movie written by a North Vietnamese
or Viet Cong fighter giving a truthful account of the
training program set up by the people of that beleaguered
Southeast Asian nation who fought for their independence
against the Chinese, the French and the Americans.  We
already know that there are some cultural differences that
separate the northerners from their compatriots in the south,
but for the most part they are of the same cultural
background.  Not so the American fighting units.  Not only did
the U.S. servicemen generally have no passionate reason to
fight 12,000 miles away since, after all, they were not
defending their country; nor did they feel they had the support
of a sizable majority of the countrymen back home; but in
addition, since the U.S. embraces a large landscape with
different sectional, cultural, ethnic and religious differences,
there was bound to be considerable friction within their own
squadron.  That chafing is the subject of Joel Schumacher's
movie.</P>
<P>   "Tigerland," is semiautobiographical, dealing with director
Joel Schumacher's own period of training in a Louisiana
camp known as Tigerland--a camp which simulated actual
fighting conditions in the jungles of the 'Nam and which was
preceded by a rigorous training program in yet another
Louisiana location.  Filmed largely with hand held cameras
and natural lighting in accordance with the Danish-style
Dogme 95 movement, "Tigerland" often looks like some
documentary coverage of a typical barracks.  We get the
impression that the Louisiana program was the American
approach writ small.  A washed-out olive green aura
encompasses many sections of this fictionalized bit of history
giving the feeling of immediacy.  We witness what was going
down in 1971, to some extent a microcosm of American
society today.</P>
<P>   Schumacher lucks out with a largely unknown cast of
awesome performers, particularly the lead character, Roland
Bozz, played by the Irish actor Colin Farrell--a handsome,
charismatic man who can probably look forward to some big
Hollywood contracts.  Emulating the ambiance of
such films as Oliver Stone's "Platoon" and Stanley Kubrick's
"Full Metal Jacket," "Tigerland" takes us into the bivouac and
the mindset of a group of grunts, most of whom were drafted
and who had educations well short of college.  At no point in
the story does anyone discuss his opinions of the war--which
was the case with most soldiers throughout the nation who
were concerned more about survival than political theory as
they prepared to be shipped out to the hellhole of the the Far
East.</P>
<P>   The story is narrated by Private Jim Paxton (Matthew
Davis), a man who enlisted with the quixotic notion that he
would be the Ernest Hemingway of the 1970's, sitting
with notebook in hand recording the blow-by-blow action of
the fighting to capture the zeitgeist of the grunts with whom
he would share a unique camaraderie.  By contrast, Wilson
(Shea Whigham) is the sort of person you'd think the
army would want, a guy with a natural killer instinct who
couldn't give a fig about the reasons for the war but who
simply wanted to bag himself some trophies of "gooks" and
"dinks"--as the Asians were commonly referred to by the
fighting units.</P>
<P>   Colin Farrell runs away with the show.  As Roland Bozz, he
has some college, has been in trouble with the law, and
defies army rules and regulations.  In one case he runs
across a fellow in his platoon who is married with a kid. 
"What are you doing here?" he wonders aloud.  Informing the
grunt with barely a six-grade education of his rights, Bozz
succeeds in getting the man a discharge. </P>
<P>   The blaring orders of the sergeants who are running the
show and who at times see nothing wrong with pushing their
men down in the dirt, stepping on their heads when they get
out of line, produce in Bozz a barely suppressed hostility. 
He expresses his defiance with a smirk, as though to say
"this is all a game, fellas...have a few laughs while you're
doing push-ups and being awakened at 4:30 each morning by
morons who get their jollies from kicking around their own
people."</P>
<P>   Shot by Matthew Libatique, whose resume includes such
surreal films as Darren Aronofsky's current "Requiem for a
Dream" and the even more experimental "Pi," "Tigerland"
affords by contrast a realistic look at an actual training
program.  If the Vietnamese enemy ever got a look at what
went on inthis training camp, it would be emboldened at least
a much as it was upon hearing of the massive protests in the
U.S. against the war.  Blacks are fighting whites, sergeants
battling G.I.'s, psycho killers going after wise guys with an
education...all serve to give "Tigerland" the sort of dramatic
force enjoyed by the audience for Robert Altman's 1983
adaptation of David Rabe's play, "Streamers"--a couple of
days in an army barracks at the dawn of America's
involvement in Vietnam which turned into a parable about
manhood and death.</P>
