<P>MAFIA!
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Touchstone / 1:26 / 1998 / PG-13 (crude humor, comedic violence, 
language)
Cast: Jay Mohr; Billy Burke; Christina Applegate; Lloyd Bridges; Pamela 
Gidley; Olympia Dukakis; Jason Fuchs; Joe Viterelli; Tony Lo Bianco
Director: Jim Abrahams 
Screenplay: Jim Abrahams; Greg Norberg; Michael McManus<HR>As movie spoofs go, Jim Abrahams' "Mafia!" isn't quite up to the 
dazzling laugh quotients of "The Naked Gun" and "The Naked Gun 2½," 
which he co-wrote, or "Airplane!", which he co-wrote and co-directed, or 
"Hot Shots!" and "Hot Shots! Part Deux," which he co-wrote and directed 
all by himself. (If it's got an exclamation point in the title, Abrahams 
is behind the wheel.) But even if "Mafia!"'s convulsion-inducing yuks 
number moderately few, at least it strings them together with a steady 
supply of hearty chuckles. Plus, it's so much more on-target than most 
of the "parodies" we've been subjected to lately -- "Robin Hood: Men in 
Tights," "National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1," "Dracula: Dead and Loving 
It" and "Spy Hard," to name a few -- that it seems like a breath of 
fresh, funny air. </P>
<P>The joke is on mob movies this time, specifically "The Godfather" 
trilogy, as the all-powerful Don Vincenzo Cortino (the late Lloyd 
Bridges) comes to a realization that his crime empire must be handed 
down to one of his two sons -- noble war hero Anthony (Jay Mohr in the 
Al Pacino role) or coke-addicted psychopath Joey (Billy Burke in the 
James Caan role). There's even a Diane Keaton-esque girlfriend 
(Christina Applegate, nicely deadpan) for the former, appropriately 
named Diane. Some of "Casino" is rolled into the story as well, as 
Anthony starts business in Las Vegas and courts a sassy showgirl (Pamela 
Gidley, a dead ringer for Sharon Stone) who does a pole routine that 
could get her into the Olympics. This surreal physical display is one of 
the film's funniest moments. </P>
<P>For those who've never seen "The Godfather" -- get thee to a video 
store! -- or fear that the genre is too dated to milk for laughs, 
"Mafia!" also pokes fun at everything from "Striptease" to Barney to 
"The Lost World" to Riverdance to "Forrest Gump." (The best riff on 
"Gump," by the way, is not the "Run, florist, run!" bit showcased 
prominently on the previews, but rather a verbal exchange that ends with 
the line, "I have a son?") A great deal of these jokes work, though 
"Mafia!" sometimes pushes a visual too far, like the scene at a wedding 
reception where the band mistakenly believes a dancer is doing the 
Macarena, when, in fact, he's being jerked around by the hail of 
gunfire. It's funny to begin with, but the length of the sight gag 
sledgehammers away its effectiveness. </P>
<P>Most of the time, however, the over-the-top approach is played just 
right, piling gag on gag until the comedy bases are loaded and a home 
run is scored; a prime example would be a send-up of "The English 
Patient" that segues into a free-for-all puke party a la "Stand by Me." 
The closing credits hide subliminal jokes ranging from mock-throwaway 
trivia about the cast ("Fun fact: Actress Christina Applegate invented 
radar") to a great rewrite of the American Humane Association 
disclaimer. Even the press kit gets in on the silliness -- the movie 
production information is written completely in Italian, while Abrahams' 
bio states that "in addition to [the his films, he] has also attended 
screenings of ‘Gandhi,' ‘Wall Street,' ‘Dances With Wolves' and ‘The 
Silence of the Lambs.'" </P>
<P>Not much else can be said about "Mafia!" To criticize the indifferent 
plot or thin characters would be a pretty pointless task since their 
sole function is to provide something to hang all of the funny business 
on, and, in this case, the funny business is worthwhile for those of us 
who like this sort of thing. The genre that "Mafia!" belongs to is a 
difficult one to review because of its subjectivity -- either you find 
this sort of thing amusing or you don't. I did, and enough that I can 
recommend it as an enjoyable summer diversion, though it's nowhere near 
as enjoyable as many of its ancestors. Speaking of lineage, frequent 
Abrahams collaborators David Zucker and Pat Proft have similar fare due 
in the coming weeks with "BASEketball" and "Wrongfully Accused," 
respectively. Here's to hoping they're at least on par with "Mafia!"<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a 
couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to 
resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie 
than the makers did. A critic's mind is a terrible thing to waste." -- 
Roger Ebert on "I Know What You Did Last Summer"</P>
