<P>Written by:
David Swift, Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer. THE PARENT TRAP is a remake
of David Swift's 1961 screenplay which was based on Erich Kastner's 1950
children's book "Das Doppelte Lottchen." </P>
<P>Starring: 
Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine Hendrix, Lisa
Ann Walter, Simon Kunz.</P>
<PRE>Ingredients:
Mischievous preteen twin girls trying to get their divorced parents back
together </PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
THE PARENT TRAP is a Disney remake of the 1961 Disney movie of the same
name. In the 1998 version , Lindsay Lohan plays two twins named Annie
and Hallie who were separated shortly after birth, and raised by each
single parent, respectively. For example, Annie was raised by her
mother, a Londoner, so she has never met her American father. Meanwhile
Hallie was raised by her American father, so she has never met her
British mother. </P>
<P>By coincidence the twins meet each other at a summer camp, and after a
prank-filled rivalry, Annie and Hallie come to realize that they are
actually sisters. Filled with curiosity about the parents they never
met, they decide to switch places, one going to London while the other
to California. Soon afterwards, they hatch plots to reunite their
divorced parents and live as one happy family.</P>
<P>Opinion:
THE PARENT TRAP is one of those lighthearted, highly entertaining
family-values comedies that people of any age can enjoy. It has
slapstick pranks, family reunions, romance, and an exciting fencing
match. And to top it off, the heroes are kids and the parents are the
same age (instead of the typical 90s movie pairing of ancient sugar
daddy with hot-bodied young gal). </P>
<P>The talented Lindsay Lohan is effective and charming playing two
different eleven-year-old girls: Annie and Hallie. Lohan does so well at
it that she easily persuades us she is two different people, who,
through eerily coincidental characteristics, come to realize they are
twins, although they've been raised oceans apart. Come to think of it,
every character in THE PARENT TRAP - - from Dennis Quaid and Natasha
Richardson as the parents to hired servants Lisa Ann Walter and Simon
Kunz - - manages to be warmly funny and appealing without stealing the
show or going over the top. </P>
<P>We're all used to disappointing Hollywood remakes, but thankfully, THE
PARENT TRAP is quite refreshing and fun. Everyone does such a top notch
and balanced job in THE PARENT TRAP that the 1998 version is just as
good or better than the original. </P>
