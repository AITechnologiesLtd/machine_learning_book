<P>Max Cohen is a paranoid loner in a small apartment jammed to the
gunwales with sophisticated homebrew computer equipment. As such,
he¹s both more likable and more dangerous than a gun-obsessed
wacko like Travis Bickle. For, unlike Travis, Max isn't looking
for respect, or a girl friend, or money. He's looking for the
meaning of life, which, based on a reasonable set of assumptions
that he postulates and repeats over an over, he is pretty sure
exists. He almost had me believing it.</P>
<P>Max is a pretty smart guy with a Ph.D. in number theory from
Columbia University. He looks for patterns in pi, which famously
has none as far as anyone can figure (until Max, that is). He
applies these patterns to understanding the stock market. He's
not interested in the money, of course; he just wants to
understand the underlying structure.</P>
<P>Max is also a pretty sick guy. When he was a kid he stared at the
sun for several minutes, resulting in temporary blindness and a
permanent susceptibility to devastating headaches. He does what
he can to treat them but they won't go away, and they plague his
work. He's Icarus, of course, and the movie makes sure that you
catch the reference.</P>
<P>Pi is director Darren Aronovsky's first feature. It's low, low,
budget--filmed in a harsh, overexposed black and white which
portrays Max' state of mind quite well. There are no effects in
Pi, just images, all of them disturbing. The streets and the
apartments look cramped, ugly, dirty and dangerous (and really,
the movie implies that you are much safer on a New York subway at
2.00 a.m. than in Max' apartment at high noon). The music is an
insistent techno dance soundtrack that complements the gritty
visuals, giving the movie a reckless driving energy. Together
they effectively portray Max as a lonely, focused man living a
very dangerous life.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Max is being chased. By people, for one. It seems
that he came upon a 216 digit number when his computer blew out
during a critical analysis of stock market fluctuations. He
tosses away that number in frustration, but certain people want
it--a cartel of stock market investors, for one, who think that
number holds a key to the rise and fall of share prices. Max is
also chased by a group of Jewish mystics looking for the name of
God. Max resists both groups at first but then gives in. The
financiers give him a military grade computer chip as big as your
fist. The Kaballists show him that the Torah is really a long
string of numbers. (Max gets hooked when he finds the Fibonacci
sequence in the Hebrew words for father, mother and child). Max
decides to give both sides what they think they want.</P>
<P>The human bad guys here are not especially convincing. The leader
of the cartel comes off mostly as cranky and out of sorts, and
Orthodox Jews are not typically a group a screenwriter will go to
when the desired effect is heavy menace. Yet there is something
else out there that is really scary, and its mixed up with that
216 digit number (which Max commits to memory). That's what Pi is
all about at the end.</P>
<P>There are a couple of ways to read Pi. On the one hand, it works
as pure science fiction. It's not billed as such, but director
Aronovsky seems to have read a fair amount of the stuff; I saw,
or thought I saw references to Dick, Van Vogt, Gibson, Stephenson
and a whole raft of others. As sf, Pi is straighforward but
scary, with few special effects and relatively straightforward
violence. Pi is idea-based sf.</P>
<P>If you don¹t like the science fiction reading of the movie, Pi
also works as a study of paranoid obsession. A paranoid sees
patterns everywhere. So do conspiracy theorists, religious
mystics and stock market players. A lot of these patterns do
exist, as mathematics shows. When you take these clean patterns
from number theory to everyday human behavior, you risk becoming
a kook. If you can't take a break from this sort of thing (as
Max' old graduate advisor suggests) you become a dangerous kook,
if only to yourself.</P>
