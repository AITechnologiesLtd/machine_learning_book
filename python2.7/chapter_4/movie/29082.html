<P>PLOT:
A group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane
asylum. As each day passes, the crew members begin to discover things about the
place and themselves which set other things in motion. Saying anything else
about the plot would be a crime. Have fun...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
"I feel like shooting myself in the head" are the first words that came out of
my mouth after seeing this movie, a good indication as to what kind of film to
expect here. This ain't your average "happy go lucky" kind of picture. This is a
deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere, with a very
creepy insane asylum (in which most of the film takes place), very few clues
up-front and lots to talk about afterwards. Will it bore some people to sleep?
You bet it will! Is it made for the SCREAM audiences of the day? Absolutely not!
I guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the "cerebral crowd". A
film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame, giving away very little
with each step and each sound, unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up
a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later. I've always loved
movies that have me talking about them afterwards like THE SHINING and LOST
HIGHWAY and this film fits right into that group. In fact, I guess I can
pussyfoot around the actual word all I want but the best way to describe this
kind of movie is a "mindfuck".</P>
<P>If you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly, gives you a handful of
characters with divergent backgrounds, tosses a few very ambiguous and
supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all
together, well, then this movie is definitely for you! It's the kind of film
that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate (damn, I missed that
whole "peanut butter" thing!) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you
if watched alone in the dark. "Brrrrrrrrr...now what was that sound in the
basement? Honey, can you go check?" And one thing this film doesn't have, unlike
its Hollywood-ian counterparts like THE HAUNTING, is special effects. In fact,
that's one of the greater things about this movie: it feels real because it
looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very
credible circumstances (I did some research and it was, in fact, shot on digital
video...ah-ha!). Another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory
and somewhat violent in theme, and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the
big screen (it's mostly implied, kids!). And as clichéd as it might be to
say...it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied
in movies as such.</P>
<P>Other films that this one reminded me of include HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL
KILLER and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, with that same real sense of dread, brooding
and terror. The film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get
"into" it completely (you really need to concentrate here), you will lose the
motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released. But overall, this
film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool
comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight. And with David Caruso acting
like the king hotshot like only he can, how can you go wrong? Definitely not a
film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the
psyche of the disturbed (count me in!). Stanley Kubrick would be proud! Oh
yeah...so where's that gun again...?</P>
