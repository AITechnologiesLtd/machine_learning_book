<PRE>THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>German auteur Tom Tykwer downshifts from the frenetic pace of Run Lola
Run, landing solidly back in first gear -- if that -- with The Princess
and the Warrior, a glorified and conceited film school project if ever
I've seen one.</P>
<P>Tykwer reunites with Lola star Franka Potente, casting her as Sissi (the
princess, presumably) a troubled mental ward nurse who probably ought to
be a patient herself.  After a morose 20-minute setup wherein the
players are cryptically introduced, we find Sissi lying near death under
a semi truck, run down in a city street.  To her rescue comes the
unlikely hero Bodo (the warrior?), played by the Gary Oldmanesque Benno
Fürmann (also Potente's Anatomy costar), a two-bit crook who indirectly
caused the collision in the first place.  Bodo saves Sissi's life by
giving her a homemade tracheotomy, and after a long recovery, the
already unstable Sissi soon finds herself obsessed with her savior.</P>
<P>What follows is a mishmash of heist flicks and David Lynch movies as
Sissi tracks Bodo down, is shunned by him, and later just-so-happens to
run into him while he and his brother are robbing the local bank.  To be
sure, it's an atmospheric, dark, and weird story as we ride the elevated
trains of Wuppertal, Germany, a picturesque small town laden with
shadowy wrong turns.</P>
<P>Alas, it's too bad that the story of The Princess can't keep up with the
creepiness of its setting.  With little in the way of a guiding plot,
the movie is poorly structured with confusing and random character
arcs.  Tykwer ultimately seems more obsessed with framing clever
photographs than in telling his story and as a result, he manages even
to make a bank robbery look boring.</P>
<P>As well, setting much of the film inside the mental hospital is a cheat,
an easy out for excusing the behavior of characters that would otherwise
go intolerated in the real world -- and wouldn't be tolerated in an
asylum, either.  The film feels more like a by-product of a bad dream
Tykwer had but can only half-remember.  Most notably this is manifest in
Sissi's sudden revelation that leads to the film's climax, a confession
that is as phony as they come.  The neo-supernatural dénouement is just
as foolish.</P>
<P>While Tykwer would have us believe The Princess is a meditation on
chance and destiny and the meaning of life, the whole scenario is a
contrivance and a fraud.  Tykwer is naïve in mistaking cleverness in his
use of coincidence and repeating themes for what is actually an obvious
and lazy plot device.  The result is an intensely restless audience who
were hoping for another Lola and got quite the opposite.</P>
<P>The biggest slap of The Princess and the Warrior comes right at the end,
when after you've suffered through 2 hours and 15 minutes of Tykwer's
histrionics, he leaves you with a long, slow helicopter shot, pulling
back from the final scene in a single take that lasts for a several
minutes.  Presumably we are left to ponder the depth of The Princess's
meaning.  Instead, we put on our jackets, check our watches, and wonder
what happened to the budding talent of a new filmmaker.</P>
