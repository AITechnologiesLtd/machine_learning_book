<P>William Thomas Cummings said "There are no atheists in foxholes." 
According to "The Thin Red Line," there was at least one, along with a 
number of bad poets and first year philosophy students. Visually 
sumptuous and astoundingly pretentious, "The Thin Red Line" takes a 
bracing portrayal of the battle of Guadalcanal and buries it within 
nearly three hours of nature footage, muddled philosophizing, and endless 
navel-gazing. Some have proclaimed the film a masterpiece that transcends 
traditional narrative structure to become a cinematic meditation. I found 
it more a grandiose doodle, the kind of thing a screenwriter might come 
up with after smoking too much dope while watching old war movies on TV. </P>
<P>If a novice director had screened this film, he would likely have been 
told, "Nice cinematography, Skippy. Now put away your bong, take this 
self-indulgent rough cut back to the editing room and chop out about an 
hour and a half. You might start by lopping off that wandering-in-
paradise opening sequence along with the virtually incoherent 45 minutes 
at the end. Get rid of those godawful voice-overs, Hallmark Hall of Fame 
flashbacks, and a lot of the Wild Kingdom animal shots. Turn down the 
orchestra so we can hear the dialogue, color-code the soldiers so we can 
tell one from another, and lose those distracting cameos from John 
Travolta and George Clooney. Oh, and you know those scenes where you were 
trying to show that the Japanese soldiers were scared, confused human 
beings just like the Americans? It might help if you added subtitles. 
Think about it, kid." </P>
<P>But instead of a novice, we're dealing with writer/director Terrence 
Malick, who dazzled filmgoers with "Badlands" in 1973 and "Days of 
Heaven" in '78, then dropped out of the filmmaking world for 20 years, 
becoming an icon in the process. Given the blind eye turned to the woozy 
metaphysics and astounding lack of discipline shown by Malick in this 
endurance test, it appears that absence really does makes the heart grow 
fonder, and the critical skills duller. </P>
<P>Loosely based on the James Jones novel, "The Thin Red Line" boasts 
amazing cinematography and, midway through the film, a lengthy, gripping 
depiction of American troops battling to capture a hilltop machine gun 
nest from the Japanese. The sequence eloquently conveys the fear and 
chaos of warfare, along with the utter randomness of who lives or dies, 
as soldiers attempt to follow battle plans while bullets and grenade 
fragments rip through their comrades.</P>
<P>But Malick isn't content to let the horror of war speak for itself. His 
sights are set much higher. He intends the film to be a grand tone poem, 
about man and nature and God and stuff. After shooting a tremendous 
amount of footage and assembling a six hour version of the movie, he 
reinvented the story in the editing room for the three hour cut. By the 
time he was finished, one major character was left with only two lines, 
while others disappeared completely. The disjointed result minimizes 
dialogue, replacing it with orchestral swells, symbolism-loaded shots of 
birds, dreamy flashbacks and loads of voice-overs.</P>
<P>Oh, those voice-overs. It feels like open stage night at the World War II 
coffeehouse as the audience is subjected to lines like "Love, where does 
it come from? Who lit this flame in us?" Wait, there's more. Try these on 
for size. "What's this war at the heart of nature? Why does nature vie 
with itself? Is there an avenging power in nature?'' "How did we lose the 
good that was given us? Let it slip away. Scattered. Careless. What's 
keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory?" The film is packed 
with gems like these. Hell, one guy even narrates his own death.</P>
<P>Out of all the chatter, I found the ongoing debate between a spiritual 
soldier ("Maybe all men got one big soul that everybody's a part of") and 
a foxhole atheist ("Only one thing a man can do. Find something that's 
his. Make an island for himself.") engaging, but their intriguing 
relationship is given scant attention, as Malick instead focuses his 
camera on waving grass and prismatic beams of sunlight cutting through 
forest canopies.</P>
<P>I've said little about the actors because they tend to blur together. Two 
major players (Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin) resemble each other so much 
that it's hard to distinguish between them, and the rest come and go so 
quickly that you can't get a handle on their characters. That said, Sean 
Penn and Elias Koteas make the most of their screen time, Nick Nolte is 
imposing as a throwback to the John Wayne era and Woody Harrelson has a 
brief, but tragically moving scene.</P>
<P>If you're interested in a cinematic meditation on life and death that 
actually has substance, rent Peter Weir's "Fearless." I wish Malick had. 
Then he might have realized that pretty pictures and vague pondering do 
not a movie make. War is hell, and, moments of brilliance aside, so is 
"The Thin Red Line."</P>
