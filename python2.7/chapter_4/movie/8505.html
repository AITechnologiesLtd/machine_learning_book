<PRE>TREES LOUNGE (1996)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>        Steve Buscemi.   The name instantly brings breathtaking scenes from 
"Fargo" and "Reservoir Dogs", always playing the same kind of fast
talking style that I've come to love.    Admittedly, if it weren't for
this talented actor I doubt I would have ever rented "Trees Lounge",
mainly due to the somewhat offbeat plot that the movie appeared to
contain.   However, I went out on a limb and gave the movie a shot - I'm
very pleased I did.</P>
<P>        "Trees Lounge" follows the life of Tommy (Steve Buscemi) in his day to
day life.   As we learn, Tommy doesn't have stable employment, has
broken up long ago with his girlfriend and much of the rest of his
family.   Most of his time is spent drinking in the rotting Trees
Lounge, a burned out bar mostly filled with other
"losers" like Tommy.   Interestingly enough, while the plot has a few
twists and turns, it stays very simple, just showing us the slow
downward spiral that Tommy has fallen into.</P>
<P>        No, while many of you out there have the image of "Leaving Las Vegas"
in your head, this is not that kind of movie.   Director Steve Buscemi
(his first time in the director's seat) throws plenty of straight and
black humor in the mix.   Scenes with Tommy's father having a heart
attack or watching Buscemi driving an ice cream truck are portrayed
wonderfully and add to plenty of laughs.    It's almost as though
Buscemi wants us to cry and laugh at Tommy's burned out character
simultaneously.   That, in a sense, is what made me like "Trees Lounge"
so much.   The plot is very original, and while slow (a problem at
times) the movie draws the viewer in.   I don't think I've ever cared
more about some burned out man's life as I did about Buscemi's
character.</P>
<P>        To boot, Buscemi does a wonderful job in fulfilling his role.   The
final scene of the movie comes distinctly to mind.   If you watch Tommy
closely, you can see him really pondering his life's direction.   Will
he just give up all hope and continue in self-pity and loathing until
death?   Or, will he pick up the pieces of his life and start anew? 
Either way, it's a thought provoking question that stayed in my mind.</P>
<P>        Overall, while the plot gets a little too slow and ambiguous at times,
it's very original and captivating.   Check "Trees Lounge" out, it's a
winner.</P>
