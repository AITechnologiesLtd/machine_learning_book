<P>This worthy effort from star James Woods slipped in and out of theaters so
quickly that many of you will probably assume it's a straight to video
release when it finally pops up on Blockbuster's new release shelf, which
should be any day now.  But I suspect the film's low profile has more to
do with the unfortunate timing of its release than anything else; as the
third death row drama to hit the nation's screens in year when we'd
already suffered through Sean Penn and Sharon Stone's long walk down the
last mile, it's no surprise that this somewhat more modest movie would
come and go without hope of reprieve.  Which is too bad, since the movie's
premature demise deprived filmgoers of a catching a great unbridled turn
by James Woods on the big screen.  A nicely-realized period piece set in
the years leading up to the depression, "Killer" purports to tell the
story of America's first bona fide serial killer, related through the eyes
of an unusually principled prison guard who befriends the outcast con
throughout the years of his death row incarceration.  And though "Killer"
bears perhaps too many similarities in theme and plot to the year's two
previous death row dramas--Tim Robbins' "Dead Man Walking" and the one
that starred Sharon Stone, the name of which eludes me right this
instant--it has by far the most driving narrative of the three, as well as
a central relationship that struck me as a far more plausible dynamic than
that explored in either of its more high-profile precursors.   But see
this one for the performance of James Woods, an actor who consistently
makes such interesting choices that he could well develop into one of
America's most accomplished actors as he matures, assuming he doesn't
accidentally become some kind of Hollywood institution along the way.</P>
