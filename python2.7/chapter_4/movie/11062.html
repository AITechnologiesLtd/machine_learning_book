<P>Titanic: Small, Thoughtful Hollywood Movies Goes Down with the Ship</P>
<P>In his book Adventures in Screen Trade, William Goldman identifies two
types of movies: real, and comic book. Long before the end of my review
you will guess which one I think Titanic is. </P>
<P>I initially didn¹t want to see the Titanic. I figured I knew what was
going to happen, so why bother?  And I had heard stories about how it was
three hours long, and that you had better go to the bathroom first, etc.
Eventually I was forced to give in and this review is the result. </P>
<P>Since so much has been said about the movie¹s plot, I will confine my
comments to my immediate reactions. First, I liked the movie more than I
thought I would. Second, it didn¹t seem as long as it was, so it certainly
held my attention. But third, although I liked the movie, the longer it
has been since seeing it, the more disappointed I am because of its little
flaws. </P>
<P>First, the story of the young, star-crossed couple (you knew they were
star-crossed because they fell in love on a boat that you knew would sink)
was not entirely believable, although there was enough energy there to
draw you into the show. That this love story works in spite itself is less
a testament to the script or the casting, both of which were flawed, than
to the power of a good old fashioned love story. Leonard DiCaprio (Jack
Dawson) looked too young, and Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt) too old. His
dialogue was filled with anachronisms and had a modern day smart-aleck
sound, and even though there was some chemistry between the two, their
union seemed improbable. I found it hard to believe, for instance, that
after her mother¹s plea to stick with the rich fiance Cal Hockley (played
by Billy Zane), Winslet¹s character would abandon her family and go after
a penniless young boy. Chase your own dreams to your own detriment if you
will, but abandon dear old mom to creditors? Only in storybook romances
are rich girls that impractical and willing to abandon their parents.
Also, casting an older-looking MAN (versus boy) than DiCaprio might have
helped their relationship¹s credibility. As I watched the movie I found
myself wondering whether the formula story book romance between social
unequals may be getting a bit hackneyed for our post-modern sensibilities.</P>
<P>Then there is the old woman. She is allegedly the young woman eighty or so
years later. For some reason her character irked me. Perhaps it¹s because
she wasn¹t a character but a plot contrivance. She didn¹t look 100 plus
years old or enough like I would imagine Kate Winslet would look like as
an old crone. And I couldn¹t see how she could have lived this long and
not have told anyone this incredible story. Add to that her possession of
a pricless diamond necklace, which she even wore around her neck while
doing the gardening, that no one knew about? At times, these and other
features of Titanic¹s story book plot kept nudging me to remind me that it
was just there to make the rest of the disaster a little more palatable.
And that was another problem too, the jarring juxtaposition of dime store
romance novel plot with real life tragedy. The sinking of the Titanic was
a real disaster, an historical event with all sorts of amazing
coincidences and instances of both sacrifice and utter selfishness, and
most of that went ignored so that a plot that would have barely sustained
a made for TV movie could take center stage. Without the magnificent
special effects (mostly magnificent, occassionally you could tell that the
people walking on deck in the long shots were computer generated), would
this be a movie? Which leads me to summarize what both these flaws
signify: that the plot and character were secondary to the spectacle. And
a comic book movie is nothing if not a great spectacle.</P>
<P>This raises a disturbing question: Are we still able to make and watch
movies that aren¹t comic book? There are still a few of them made, but
their numbers seem always to be in decline. Special effects are here to
stay, in part because people expect them, but also because they allow film
makers to get away with contrived plot and shallow characters. (Consider
how flat and comic book-like both the Jurassic Park movies¹ characters
are.) And now that movies are made on a scale so large that most have to
succeed in foreign markets in order to turn a profit, the comic book movie
is easier to translate and export, with its easily distinguishable good
and bad guys and its shorter more declarative sentences played atop an
obvious spectacle.</P>
<P>Of course, few people notice the decline of the small movie anymore
because most of us have been weaned on a diet of flat, convenient
characters in movies and tv. In the end, the Titanic will make a lot of
money and inspire a few fond memories, but little more. It is not a movie
that we can revisit to mine for hidden meaning or allegory. That¹s a sad
memorial for a disaster that needlessly claimed the lives of so many
innocent victims. But at $200 million, you can¹t risk making a
sophisticated movie since you need half the population of the US to watch
it just to break even. Such is the legacy of the Hollywood blockbuster,
starting with Jaws and Star Wars through the Jurassic movies and down to
Titanic, that the studios, greedy for the outrageous profits to be had
from them, all want a blockbuster of their own. The small, thoughtful
Hollywood movie, once almost extinct but making a slow comeback, may at
last have been dealt a final death blow. We now hear that Titanic may now
be the only movie to gross over a $billion worldwide. The Titanic took
down with it more than its 1500 plus brave souls.</P>
<P>Again, don¹t get me wrong, this is a movie I enjoyed, but as soon as it
was over, I had a nagging sensation of not quite being satisfied, a
sensation I have sadly gotten used to. As I walked to my car after
watching the Titanic, I thought I could hear a bell tolling.  It wasn¹t
tolling for the brave dead from the Titanic, but for a new casualty, the
small, serious Hollywood movie. I got in and drove away as fast as I
could, hoping to avoid the funeral.</P>
