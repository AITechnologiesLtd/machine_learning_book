<PRE>BLUE SKY (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>"Better late than never" is the phrase that could be applied
to BLUE SKY, 1994 drama directed by Tony Richardson. Shot in
1991, but not released due to the bankruptcy of Orion
Pictures, this movie was finally unearthed three years
later. It was too late for its director Richardson who had
died from AIDS shortly after the end of shooting, but not
for the rest of cast and crew, especially Jessica Lange who
surprised many by getting an "Oscar" for the role in this
film.</P>
<P>The plot of this film is set in the year 1962, during the
most intense period of Cold War. Major Hank Marshall (played
by Tommy Lee Jones) is a scientist assigned to help
conducting nuclear bomb tests. Being a radiation expert, he
is too aware of the effects those tests may have on the
environment and civilian population so he wants to abandon
atmospheric tests in favour of much safer, subterranean
tests. The military higher-ups don't particularly like his
heretical views, but most of the Hank's problems come from
his family, namely his wife Carly (played by Jessica Lange).
She is very attractive yet emotionally unstable and her
manic phases tend to manifest in public outbursts of
scandalous behaviour and open flirting with other men. Hanks
nevertheless loves his wife and he is always able to forgive
her, but not the military authorities who handle this
perpetual scandal by relocating Marshall, his wife and two
daughters from one base after another. The latest relocation
brought them from Hawaii to the ugly, run-down Army base in
Alabama. The base commander Vince Johnson (played by Powers
Boothe) is soon attracted to the glamorous scientist's wife.</P>
<P>The plot for BLUE SKY consists of two stories, each of them
suitable for feature film of its own. One depicts the
struggle of lone individual against all-powerful
organisation and it could serve as an excellent history
lesson for post-Chernobyl generations, showing them the
mentality of Cold War, which sacrificed environment,
individual lives, basic morality and common sense for the
sake of nuclear supremacy. This Strangelovian story is
followed by more intimate yet equally fascinating love story
between Mr. and Mrs. Marshall. Unlike most of Hollywood love
stories, this one shows the often very painful sacrifices
people must make in order to have something resembling a
good relationship. Mixing those two stories into one plot
could have looked like a recipe for disaster, but screenplay
Rama Laurie Stagner, Arlene Sarner and Jerry Leichting
succeeds in that. The script has some of the cliches,
including melodramatic, predictable and not very convincing
finale, but the characters and their interactions are
well-drawn and the story in general engaging from start to
finish. The best job was done by actors. Jessica Lange truly
deserved her "Oscar" - her portrayal of Carly is wonderful,
both on the outside (especially in scenes where she brings
touch of Monroesque Hollywood glamour and sexuality to the
dreary and dull setting of early 1960s US military) and
inside, when she makes us understand why her husband loves
her so much despite the endless series of humiliation and
embarrassment. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good in the role
of a man whose love is stronger than machistic pride, and
whose stoicism in matters of heart manifests as virtue in
matters of military ethics. Amy Locane, who was very young
during the production of this film, is very remarkable in
the role of Marshalls' older daughter Alexandra. All in all,
BLUE SKY, despite some flaws, is an interesting and touching
drama that deserves more attention than its single "Oscar"
might indicate.</P>
