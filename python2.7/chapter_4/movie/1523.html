<PRE>                        WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>114 min., PG, Drama, 1991
Director: Charles Sturridge
Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Judy Davis, Rupert Graves,
      Giovanni Guidelli, Barbara Jefford, Helen Mirren</P>
<P>     A widowed woman falls in love and plans to get married with a man
from another culture.  Her family doesn't like the marriage and tries to
get her to reconsider.  I know that this is very vague, but I really
couldn't think up a good summary without giving away a lot of the plot.</P>
<P>     WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD has gotten a rave review (that I saw),
but I don't think that it is that good.  It is a good film but it is
slow in some places and over dramatic in others.  On a scale of zero to
five I give WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD a three (with reservations).
WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD is rated PG for adult situations.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem that I found with this film is that it got
rather boring in some places, and too emotional in other places.  I
think that if this film had been trimmed down to an hour and a half it
would have ended up a much better film.</P>
<P>     The actors/actresses do a great job.  I don't think that there were
any whose performance I disliked the performance by.  In that aspect
this film is great, and the only reason that the film ended up with a
three (with reservations) for a rating.  Otherwise it would have ended
up with a two.  I am sure that there are many people who will love this
film, it is just that I am not one of them.  So don't take my word as
the gospel and feel that this film is absolutely terrible.  If this film
sounds really great to you, you will probably love it, but if you go, I
can only suggest matinee prices.</P>
