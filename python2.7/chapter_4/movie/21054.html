<P>This film would have been a lot better if it was made for TV.  It had
that kind of feel to it.  The formula is: a small sick child, a single
parent who would go to any extreme to save their stupid kid, and the bad
guy.  The only thing that breaks the formula is that Meredith
Baxter-Birney does not play the parent.</P>
<P>Peter McCabe (Garcia) is the Desperate single parent who must find a
bone marrow transplant to save the life of his son before he dies.  He
breaks into the FBI computer to run through a list of potential matches
and finds one in the deranged killer, Frank Connor (Keaton).  Connor,
while initially slow to accept the offer of sharing his bone marrow,
eventually agrees in exchange for restored smoking privileges, library
access, an extra sugar for his coffee and reassignment to the general
prison population.  Little do they all know, he actually plans to escape
before the operation even takes place!</P>
<P>Could this surprise anyone watching?  The characters are completely
stunned.  And to make matters worse, they can't kill Connor because the
kid will die without him.  What a dilemma.</P>
<P>What ensues is a cross between Extreme Measures and an episode of
Chicago Hope.  That's right, boring trifling cliched cardboard shit.
Barbet Schroeder, who hasn't made a decent film since I was legally able
to drink (Reversal of Fortune), does nothing original in his direction.
The opening credits and the poster are both better than the final
product that you see on the screen.</P>
