<PRE>                                 BACK BEAT
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1994 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<P>Director: Ian Softly
Producers: Finola Dwyer and Stephen Wooley.
Starring Stephen Dorff, Ian Hart, Sheryl Lee, Gary Bakewell. </P>
<P>     From the UK publicity of this film I anticipated it would be a
music documentary paying homage to early Beatlemania, however the
result was a far more interesting.  The writers (Softley, Ward and
Thomas) examine the embryonic band, and succeeded in showing the
breadth of their influences.  The Beatles ability to absorb not only
musical ideas, but those of painting, photography, Hamburg counter-
culture and Sixties socialism, allowed them to evolve a unique style.</P>
<P>     John (Ian Hart) is shown railing against the merely fashionable in
his search for the truly expressive and avant-garde.</P>
<P>     I was impressed with the performance (by Stephen Dorff) of Stu
Sutcliffe, the introvert, gifted beyond his years, with all the
confusion and angst of youth.  He achieved an intense and exhilarating
portrait of an artist at work.</P>
<P>     One of the things I most liked about this movie was the way it
indicated that, from the start, only John Lennon had a real sense of
destiny for the band.  A key theme of the story is the reaction of the
rest as they realise quite how this is likely to affect their future.
Their competitive desire for Astrid mirrors a similar desire for
quality in their work.</P>
<P>     Some of the characterisations are low key, but this serves to
reinforce the point that together, they were greater than the sum of
individual artists and musicians.</P>
<P>     Within minutes of commencing, this picture betrayed it's homage to
SCANDAL.  With wit and discretion it managed to achieved a UK-15
certificate.  For a teenage audience, an understanding of their
aspirations.  For the rest of us, a reminder of a time before
mortgages,  when we may not have had many of the answers, but at least
we were asking the questions!</P>
