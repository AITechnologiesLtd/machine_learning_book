<PRE>                           THE REMAINS OF THE DAY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Anthony Hopkins plays Mr. Stevens, a
     butler whose carries his integrity and dedication to his
     profession to such a degree that he has lost himself in his
     job and his only ideals are serving his master.  Hopkins and
     Emma Thompson turn in good performances, but this sad film is
     just not up to all the buildup.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) is Lord Darlington's loyal butler.  And that
is all that Stevens allows himself to be.  Very old values tell Stevens that
every fiber of his being should be devoted to his vocation.  So he has
strangled off every emotion and inclination but those of loyalty and
integrity as a butler.  Lord Darlington (played by James Fox) is, after all,
a very important man.  As a diplomat he entertains other diplomats from all
over Europe.  As Germany re-arms under Hitler, Darlington has strong
sympathies for the German people and he holds international conferences in
Darlington Manor to convince other countries that Germany under Hitler does
not constitute a threat.  Stevens does not so much submerge his feelings
about his master's politics as actually deny himself the right to even hold
any feeling or opinion but loyalty.</P>
<P>     Into this house comes a new housekeeper, Miss Kenton, played by Emma
Thompson.  At first there is friction between Stevens and Miss Kenton,
particularly over Stevens' father, who has come to work in the same house.
Eventually they learn to work together and to some degree understand each
other.  Miss Kenton is even startled one day to discover Stevens actually
respects her.  She responds by developing affection for Stevens and is
frustrated to realize that Stevens does not allow himself the emotion to
reciprocate her feelings.</P>
<P>     Stevens' loyalty is made all the more tragic by the shallowness of the
diplomats and friends of Darlington who feel they are the saviors of Europe
while steering it toward inevitable war.</P>
<P>     Yet the story is a bit of a tear-jerker and seems to do less with more
than this year's similarly themed UN COEUR EN HIVER.  The screenplay is by
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.  And there is
something else here that is unexpected from a British-born writer.  European
films often show Americans as being brash dilettantes.  While Christopher
Reeve, as an American congressman attending a conference, is an idealist, he
also is perhaps the only one of Darlington's guests to understand the issues
involved at the conference.</P>
<P>     THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is impeccably directed by James Ivory and
Hopkins' acting is a joy to behold as he walks around the Manor giving
bulldog looks and overseeing his master's house.  Hopkins is always able to
find something physical to do with a scene that seems to go beyond the
script.  In one scene Thompson is trying to pry an object from his hands.
Hopkins resists, then relents.  Most actors would simply let go of the
object cradled in their arms.  Hopkins flattens his hand giving an
unexpected gesture of surrender.  Thompson is engaging also, but with much
less of a flair for the unexpected.</P>
<P>     This is a solid film that may remind some of the TV series UPSTAIRS,
DOWNSTAIRS.  The characters are well portrayed but it is just a bit obvious
in theme.  I would give it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
