<P>Murphy is a comic genius. He adds fun and flavor to each one of his projects, 
which certainly wouldn't be the same without him. Whether playing an entire 
obese family in The Klumps, or a talking donkey in Shrek, the man is just 
all-out hilarious. He's been trapped before in bad films Holy Man and the 
original Dr. Dolittle, but always bounces back. This time he reprises the 
role of the animal-talking doctor, and is, of course, funny. In this witty 
sequel, however, he has some backup. Most of it comes from a talking bear. </P>
<P>Dr. Dolittle has become a worldwide sensation. Pet owners swamp his home with 
their ailing animals, and he's opened a successful veterinary clinic. His new 
fame has led him to drift away from his wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson) and newly 
sixteen daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone). Dolittle has to reintroduce a 
circus bear living in captivity named Archie (voice of Steve Zahn) to the 
wild, and make him appealing to forest bear Ava (voice of Lisa Kudrow). The 
bears are endangered species, and if they mated, it would stop a logging 
company from tearing down the forest. Reintroduction has never been 
accomplished, but it's a challenge the doctor will take, with the help of 
many other forest animals. </P>
<P>Other voices include Michael Rapaport, Norm Macdonald, Isaac Hayes, Mike 
Epps, and Jacob Vargas. Each vocal performance is unique, and everyone is 
quite good. The highest praise, however, must go to the animal trainers. 
These animals actually look like they're saying the lines in the script. 
Whatever they did, it works. </P>
<P>The jokes come fast, and are perfectly appropriate for kids. This makes it a 
summer rarity, in that both adults and kids will like it. It is far better 
than the one-joke Cats & Dogs. Also noteworthy is the refreshing family 
subplot to the story. Dolittle must balance his work with his family, and the 
scenes between him and Raven-Symone are quite touching. They feel real. </P>
<P>Though no one will be a better person because of this film, certainly no one 
will be bored. This is a solidly entertaining comedy for everyone. It's a 
film you'd expect around Thanksgiving rather than summer. Murphy's 
high-energy performance makes this one to see. I'd be up for a third one. </P>
