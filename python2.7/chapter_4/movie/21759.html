<P>Pixar's follow-up to 1995's hugely successful Toy Story is another
whopping cinematic victory, guaranteed to garner critical raves and
still make money hand-over-fist while packing theaters through this
holiday season.  The original, the third-highest-grossing animated film
ever (behind The Lion King and Aladdin) and the first full-length
computer-generated movie, made almost $200 million during its theatrical
run, catching Hollywood a bit off-guard.  This sequel even pokes fun at
the fact that unaware toy stores didn't stock enough of the film's
action figures the first time around.</P>
<P>For the few people that haven't seen the first film, it focused on a
group of toys owned by a six-year-old tyke named Andy Davis (voiced by
John Morris).  His favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks,
You've Got Mail), faced his greatest fear when Andy received a shiny new
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, Home Improvement) doll for his birthday.  A
jealous Woody hatched a plan to get rid of his cocky rival, but it
backfired, leaving the cowboy and his toy cohorts to perform a daring
rescue mission to return Buzz to their master.</P>
<P>Here, Woody, Buzz and the other toys all get along nicely, even playing
with Andy's dog, Buster, whom he received as a Christmas gift in Toy
Story's final scene.  As the film opens, we learn that Andy is about to
leave for Cowboy Camp and plans to take his trusty pal Woody along.  But
right before they leave, Woody's arm is partially torn, which not only
results in Andy leaving him behind, but also in his mother (Laurie
Metcalf, The Norm Show) relegating the damaged toy to a dusty shelf.
The ledge appears to be a home to toys that Andy has either grown out of
or has broken.</P>
<P>Long story short, Woody is taken by an unscrupulous toy collector (Wayne
Knight, Seinfeld), courtesy of Mrs. Davis' yard sale.  The graying,
balding pudge named Al recognizes Woody as a rare toy in near perfect
condition and plans to sell his find to a Japanese museum along with
three other figures he has previously collected from the `Woody's
Roundup' set - Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack, Arlington Road), Stinky
Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer, Frasier), and Bullseye the horse
(David Ogden Stiers, Two Guys, a Girl & a Pizza Place).</P>
<P>Having no idea that he was so valuable, a pragmatic Woody is faced with
the inevitable fact that Andy is growing older and will, at some point,
stop playing with toys.  He has to decide whether to go back to Andy and
the other toys, or lead a boring life of virtual immortality from a
glass case.  Plus, Woody has to factor in the guilt aspect – if he
ditches Jessie, Pete and Bullseye, they'll end up packed away in storage
boxes indefinitely, until Al can find another Woody-clone to complete
his sale.</P>
<P>Like the original film, Toy Story 2 is visually stunning, with CG images
so true-to-life that you can easily forget that you aren't watching a
live-action movie.  It features better and more realistic action
sequences than most films.  And like its predecessors (Toy Story and A
Bug's Life), this sequel seems to offer more jokes for adults than kids,
spoofing Jurassic Park and Star Wars, among others. In fact, I'm not
even sure that kids will grasp the whole concept of collecting old toys,
or appreciate Al's videotapes of the hokey ‘50s television show that
featured Woody and his pals.</P>
<P>Created by the same team of writers and directors that made both Toy
Story and A Bug's Life, this new film seems to be filled with more
emotional moments than either of its predecessors.  The conflict Woody
feels is more real than what we're used to seeing in films, and there is
also an oddly effective Sarah MacLachlan song (her second weepy number
this month after Anywhere But Here) about Jessie's former owner ditching
the cowgirl for a life of makeup and boys.  Again, this will likely be
more effective for adults than children.  And, after Pokémon, is that
such a bad thing?</P>
