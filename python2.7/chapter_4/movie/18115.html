<PRE>DAMAGE (1992)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov</PRE>
<P>In the early 1990s, following the surprise success of BASIC
INSTINCT, Hollywood launched whole series of films labelled
as "erotic thrillers". Usually, such films were
disappointments - unsatisfying both to the fans of
thrillers, and those who like to be engrossed in erotica.
However, they proved to be modest commercial success, mostly
due to the hype caused with rating controversy. One of the
films that was mistaken for such "erotic thriller" was
DAMAGE, British erotic drama, directed by veteran French
director Louis Malle. This film also had to fight with
American censors, but, when the film actually had hit the
markets, the viewers, expecting another interesting thriller
or fleshfest, turned out to be quite disappointed.</P>
<P>The movie was based on the dark, depressing novel by
Josephine Hart. Its protagonist is Dr. Stephen Fleming
(played by Jeremy Irons), member of the British Parliament
whose life on the surface seems flawless. His family life
looks ideal, his wife Ingrid (Miranda Richardson) loves him,
his two children are grown, and his rising political star
might bring him to the post of Prime Minister. However,
everything shatters when he meets Anna Barton (Juliette
Binoche), beautiful young woman who just happens to be the
girlfriend of his son Martyn (Rupert Graves). After a single
glance, two of them engage in wild, passionate but
clandestine affair. Stephen is aware of the risks, but he
can't control his desires. Same as Anna, despite being
emotionally scared in the tragedy from her past.</P>
<P>Louis Malle made reputation, among other things, by breaking
taboos and making films about forbidden expressions of human
sexuality - like incest or paedophilia. However, unlike some
authors, who went after cheap sensationalism and excuses to
present gratuitous sex or violence, Malle was just exploring
favourite subject of many "artistic" European filmmakers,
especially French ones -huge gap between the nominal
morality of European bourgeoisie and the actual depravity
that controls the life of many of its members. Being
provided with excellent characters, both by novelist and by
talented screenwriter David Hare, Malle could engage in his
favourite way of portrayal - clinical, cold dissection of
protagonist's life and his hypocrisy. Malle's style is cold
and clinical, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that the sex
scenes, although definitely explicit, aren't erotic at all.
Actually, hardly anything is appealing in this film that
takes place on the grey interiors and exteriors of London
and under the eternally cloudy sky.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why the film is rather unappealing is
miscasting. Jeremy Irons, although being one of the best
actors from British Isles, is good in his role, but he lacks
the charm, able to convince that he could bring the girl
half of his age to the bed with a single look. Also, even in
the worst moments for his character, Irons seems somewhat
too dignified and cold to really makes us empathise with
him. Same goes for Juliette Binoche, talented actress that,
although physically attractive, simply seems too plain to be
femme fatale. Other actors save the day - versatile and
always reliable Miranda Richardson as Stephen's wife and
veterans Ian Bannen and Leslie Caron in two minor, but very
effective roles. In the end, what we are left with is a
paradox - technically great, excellently paced film with
good scenario, that in the end leaves us indifferent to the
story and characters.</P>
