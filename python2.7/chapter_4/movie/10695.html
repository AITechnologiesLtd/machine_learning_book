<PRE>"Fallen" and Can't Get Up
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Some angels that are cast out of Heaven come down to Earth to inhabit
unsuspecting souls.  People just like you and me can become unwilling
hosts to these impish beings that now exist for no other reason than
to torment and spread evil.  This is the seemingly far-fetched
explanation offered to Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) who
is in the course of investigating a series of murders and strange
occurrences.  </P>
<P>Hobbes becomes embroiled in this case shortly after Edgar Reese (Elias
Koteas), a convicted killer that he was responsible for apprehending,
was put to death.  After Reese's execution, however, more murders
patterned after Reese's style begin to occur. Mysterious, late-night
phone calls taunt Hobbes and clues are left at the murder scenes
daring Hobbes to comprehend what's really going on.  Is it a case of a
delusional, copycat murderer on the loose?  Or is there a more
sinister entity at work here? </P>
<P>"Fallen" ultimately takes on the form of a film noir with supernatural
elements that pits a good-natured detective against an evil presence,
known as Azazel.  The movie offers us some interesting moments.
Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy (John Goodman), reflect solemnly on the
purpose of enforcing goodness knowing how strong evil is.  We learn
that Azazel is a force that can move from one host body to another
through touch.  At one point, on a busy, city street, pedestrians are
quickly touching each other, as Azazel transports from one body to
another as it pursues its next victim.  And, there is a interesting
subplot that revolves around a cop who experienced Hobbes' situation
30 years ago.  As Hobbes learns more and more about the omnipotence of
his evil-spirit opponent, a sense of combustibility begins to become
more and more prevalent.</P>
<P>However, this movie teases us but never quite takes us past the
Imagination Threshold (a point that moviegoers must pass in order to
embrace such fantastical elements in this kind of film).   Hobbes is
the kind of honest cop that can only exist in a movie - never
accepting a bribe, professing to do everything under a code of honor,
adhering to the laws that are in place.  Denzel Washington seems like
an odd choice, with his soft demeanor and good looks.  He never seems
to really internalize the bizarre situation at hand.  Jonesy doesn't
add any spice to the movie's cast of characters and seems much too
heavy to be an effective detective.  And Donald Sutherland, playing
the police department's lieutenant, is reduced to beady-eyed stares as
he tries to monitor the progress of the investigation.  His role is
essentially wasted.  </P>
<P>If this film was trying to adhere to the conventional parameters of a
police thriller, it failed to engage us in the plight of Hobbes, even
as Azazel continued to torment him.  As a piece of film noir, however,
it still faltered because the cast seemed completely out of their
element.  What this film lacked, oddly enough, was spirit.</P>
