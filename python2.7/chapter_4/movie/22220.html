<PRE>                         THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 1999 filmcritic.com

<P>     Few enough people know that THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is based on
Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name.  Fewer still know they
already made one movie about Mr. Ripley, a little French number called
PURPLE NOON (1960).</P>
<P>     If you happen to be one of a handful who has seen NOON, don't feel
like THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is retreading old ground.  It's actually
different.  In fact, it's very different.  So much so that with the
exception of a few brief scenes and the overall theme, these two films
could be based on different source material.  What's really astonishing
is that both are excellent films.</P>
<P>     Tom Ripley (Damon) is introduced innocuously enough.  He's a New
York piano player/maintenance worker/bathroom attendant who, after
borrowing a Princeton-crested jacket, suddenly finds himself propelled
to Italy in search of Dickie Greenleaf (Law) at the best of Dickie's
father (Rebhorn).  Tom arrives soon enough, finding Dickie living the
slacker dream, sailing, drinking, and carousing -- when he's not
spending time with steady girl Marge (Paltrow).</P>
<P>     Ripley's plan to emulate Dickie is apparent from the start, but it
isn't until free spirit Dickie inevitably pushes the clingy Tom away
that Ripley figures he'll take over Dickie's life altogether.  Then the
fun really starts.</P>
<P>     Matt Damon plays a sociopath with uncanny -- and quite spooky --
ease.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see Tom Ripley become a
recurring antihero -- like a Hannibal Lecter should be.  Highsmith wrote
five books about Mr. Ripley, so there's plenty of source material to
work from.  Sequels or no, Damon is so dead-on scary that Hollywood
likely shudders to be alone with him.</P>
<P>     Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, is fairly useless in her role.
For starters, she vacillates between her standby British accent and her
plain-old Gwyneth voice, neither of which really fit her character.
Worse is that she has little to do in the film but often go hysterical,
which doesn't help the movie.  Before you Paltrow fans hit the "Send
Hate Mail" button, try not to forget Gwynny's performance in dogs like A
PERFECT MURDER, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, and HUSH.  It's just too bad she had
to muck up a perfectly good movie like this one.</P>
<P>     Jude Law and the rest of the supporting cast, particularly Hoffman
as a boorish American friend who shows up midway through the movie, are
good or great.  The music, dominated by period (1950's) jazz songs, is
also well-suited for the disturbing thematics of the movie.  And let's
not forget director Anthony Minghella (THE ENGLISH PATIENT), who
captures the beauty of Italy while coaxing some great performances from
his actors.</P>
<P>     On the sour side, MR. RIPLEY's homosexual themes are awkward at
best, and a few plot points (mainly Ripley setting up his alibi) seem to
have been lost to editing, despite a 2:30 run time.  As a thriller, this
may seem long, but the mood is perfect and the film rarely drags.
Altogether, it's a grand psychodrama.  Perfect, you know, for the
holidays.</P>
