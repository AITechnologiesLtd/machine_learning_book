<P>54 (1998) - Mike Myers, Ryan Phillippe, Neve Campbell, Salma Hayek</P>
<P>   Based on the true story of a New York nightclub, "54" strives for the
   essence of all things cool - sex, drugs and disco. It's got plenty of
   all three and a number of rich stories trying desperately to get out
   and be seen amidst all the '70s ambience.</P>
<P>   On the surface, it's the story of Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), the owner
   of Studio 54 - the place to be seen in the Big Apple. Steve is cast as
   a visionary, a man who wants to host a never-ending party. But Steve's
   success is based as much on his crooked b ookkeeping as it is on his
   club's wild, lurid atmosphere.</P>
<P>   Into the mix comes Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a gas-station attendant
   from New Jersey who sees the exclusive club as his way out of a quiet
   life of seeming mediocrity. After getting hired on as a busboy, he is
   quickly immersed in the dangerous lifestyle of S tudio 54 and its
   celebrity clientele.</P>
<P>   "54" has a number of equally deep stories hiding behind the disco
   beat: Steve's business practices; Shane's search for his own identity
   and a touch of romance with soap-opera star Julie Black (Neve
   Campbell); and the shaky marriage of another busboy and an aspiring
   singer (Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek).</P>
<P>   It's a shame that some of those great stories are barely touched upon,
   but the elaborate sets that upstage them are so eye-catching that you
   may not notice. Whether for good or ill, the real star of "54" is the
   club itself, with true-to-life recreations of famed set pieces like
   the cocaine-snorting crescent moon. Its twisted, dark atmosphere fits
   the dark deeds associated with the club, like drugs served along with
   the champagne.</P>
<P>   In contrast to the shadowy sets, the late '70s soundtrack is bright
   and uplifting but rarely distracting. In fact, it complements the film
   perfectly, providing that essential reminder that "54" is loosely
   based on real life.</P>
<P>   Myers, best known for his roles is odd comedies like "Austin Powers"
   and "Wayne's World," isn't likely to win any Oscars for this film, but
   at least he has the chance to demonstrate that his acting talents
   range beyond pure comedy. Most of the other actors are under-utilized
   and rarely given a chance to shine - even Phillippe, whose Shane is
   ostensibly the main character of the film.</P>
<P>   "54" is a classic example of style over substance. Visually and
   aurally, it's a sharp movie, but it's not so sharp that you completely
   forget about the stories. Director Mark Christopher tries to take us
   to the best of all possible worlds, but j ust leaves people wondering
   what happened to the characters. Rather like the dying drugs-and-disco
   scene of the time, "54" is shallow, decadent and ultimately not
   fulfilling.</P>
