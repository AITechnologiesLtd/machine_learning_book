<PRE>THE SEVEN SAMURAI (1954)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: One of the ten best movies ever made.</P>
<P>A movie this sprawling and astonishing is easy to summarize -- I could do it
in two sentences -- but impossible to describe.</P>
<P>THE SEVEN SAMURAI is, more than anything else, a totally enthralling and
entertaining movie -- fun *and* profound. It is three hours and ten minutes
long, never lags, and feels too short by half. It creates a world -- or more
accurately, takes us to another world -- populates it convincingly, gives us
motives and needs that are totally uncontrived and direct, and then lets it
loose on us. Many have argued that this is Kurosawa's best film; I would
also add that it's his most entertaining and direct, even more so than THE
HIDDEN FORTRESS. It is, quite simply, perfect.</P>
<P>The story is uncomplicated, but not simpleminded. A small village of
Japanese rice farmers are being menaced by a gang of brigands headquartered
out in the forest somewhere. The villagers know they're doomed -- they have
no weapons, no training, and they probably won't even have enough of a
harvest to bribe the brigands to keep away. The wise man of the village
tells them to hire samurai -- preferably hungry ones, since they'll be
cheaper. And so several of the farmers go off to try and find men to fit the
bill.</P>
<P>They are not terribly successful at first. History remembers the samurai as
a haughty bunch, and the few they talk to at first are impossible. Then they
run into Kanbei (played by the great, fatherly-looking Japanese actor
Takashi Shimura), an older samurai who's survived many battles. Mostly by
fleeing from them, as he laughingly confesses. He's not a warlord, but a
smart, canny tactician who knows better than to try and confront thirty
warlords face-to-face, and he's eventually compelled to work for the
farmers, for nothing more than three meals of white rice a day. Kanbei
assembles several other samurai, including Katsushiro (Ko Kimura), a boyish
young man who idolizes most of the other warriors, and has a longer way to
go than he thinks. He winds up falling for one of the village girls, but the
price he and the other woman have to pay for their closeness is ruinous and
heartbreaking.</P>
<P>The other samurai are delineated quickly and charmingly. One of them is a
cold and surgically precise swordsman, but who has a strange side of
humanity to him. He doesn't like being idolized for his skill -- how much
depth can there be to a killer? Others are more happy-go-lucky, but still
relatively competent fighters. Another is an old war buddy of Kanbei's, who
from the git-go knows Kanbei is trying to trick him into something (again).
They make an intriguing crew, each complementing the other and filling in
where others fall short. We may have seen this before, but never this
well-done and rarely with this much energy and spirit.</P>
<P>They also acquire a tagalong, a drunken roustabout who calls himself
Kikuchiyou (the incomparable Toshiro Mifune). Kikuchiyou is undisciplined
and slovenly, but also has the element of confrontation that Kanbei and the
others don't really possess. In a wonderful scene, the villagers cower in
fear from the newly-arrived samurai... until Kikuchiyou beats the alarm as a
prank to get everyone out in the open, screaming for help -- and then mocks
the way they've done an about-face when they realize they're in trouble. He
does this throughout the movie, pushing every situation he gets into to the
limit. This tendency comes to a climax in a scene, possibly one of the best
monologues ever put on film, where Kikuchiyou alternately blasts and pities
the samurai and farmers for the horrible parasitic relationships they
inflict on each other in wartime. The scene is not just self-indulgent
acting, but puts much of the conflict in the movie into perspective. Who's
preying on whom here? Even more important is that the questions remain open
at the movie's end.</P>
<P>The pace never flags. Even when the characters are simply standing around
talking about the next thing they need to do, the tension is always there:
tension between farmers and samurai, between man and woman, youth and old
age, discipline and unrestrained passion, all embodied in different
characters. (The movie introduces at least twenty speaking roles and stays
with them, but never loses us or becomes confusing.) There are many little
plots grinding away in the corners, each coming to their own conclusion, but
none of them feel contrived or manufactured. The movie understands that life
itself is far too messy to conclude patly.</P>
<P>With the amount of emotional and thematic territory it covers, the movie
runs the risk of becoming muddled or defocused. It doesn't. In plain
non-movie English, it's a hell of a ride. One scene is broad comedy; the
next moving human drama. And because all of them are hitched around the same
core story, nothing is out of place or gratuitous. For a movie that runs as
long as it does, there's not a dead spot in it, not a moment where we sit
there tapping our fingers and waiting for the director to impress us with
something else.</P>
<P>The final hour of the movie is one giant, prolonged combat scene that spans
days and nights as wave after wave of marauders come charging into the
village, and are repulsed with a combination of tactics, quick
improvisation, and sheer sweat, blood and loss of life. Nothing like it has
ever been put on film elsewhere. The age of high-tech chases and shootouts
with digital graphics doesn't dilute the power of the movie's final stretch
-- not only because it's so unpretentiously violent, but because it's played
so raw and so close, emotionally, that it's impossible to sit back and
merely admire it on a technical level.</P>
<P>The film also finds the perfect way to end -- on a note of triumph that's
bittersweet and exhausted, nothing like the glitzy smile-fests that conclude
most movies of action. Unflinching honesty is not something one would
normally associate with a movie of action and grand entertainment, but there
you go. THE SEVEN SAMURAI breaks and exceeds all expectations.</P>
