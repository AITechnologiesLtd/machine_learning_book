<P>This film reminds me of LUIS BUNUEL's LOS OLVIDADOS.  it has a similar
opening, with an editorial, that leads us into the story of the people, with
actual people in the roles.  Where BUNUEL used, some 30 years before real
actors in Mexico city, Hector Babenco, uses the actual children that are a
part of this life and have very little chance to get out of it.</P>
<P>The real story is a law in the state of Sao Paolo ( Brazil ) that does not
allow children under 18 to be put through the penal system.  And for this,
many children are hired by thugs to do many of the dirty deeds
and work, from killing, to mere drug deals.  The children are, when caught,
placed in an institution, where they are hoped to be reformed, and the film
makes the point that this does not help very much at all.</P>
<P>And in the process, Pixote ( a nickname that means little bastard )  becomes
a part of a group that is involved in various things, one of which is to
make a few deals in drugs, involving a prostitute that lives in Rio de
Janeiro.  These deals fall through, but Pixote, who is  more adapt at
dealing than his friends, becomes a partner of sorts for a while with a
woman that pretty much becomes his mother, until they accidentaly kill a
customer of hers that they want to rob, an american.</P>
<P>While the film is not a great one, it does have some very nifty performances
by some kids that are actual menbers of these groups and they shine.  I
suppose that we could hope that this film helps them become everyday useful
menbers of the society.... but in an industry that uses luck for sales, this
is unlickely to happen.
The surety is that these people will continue being the same as they have
been all their lives, and with a sllight chance, at best, to recover.  The
inevitable result is that they will become real live menbers of the hardcore
group that does not reform.</P>
<P>Pixote makes friends with a gay man and they go to Rio, where life still has
a bit of a dream for some of them.  Lilica, wants a lover that will help his
life be alive, and Pixote, still young, just wants to survive, without
having to put up with the many insults which his older friends afford him.</P>
<P>While this is not a pleasant film, there is nothing visual that is actually
unpleasant, other than the ideas themselves.  In the process, the train trip
from Sao Paolo to Rio, becomes a nice escape from the
over crowded situation that the boys must share in their quarters before
they go out into the world.  Sao Paolo, is over populated, and too many of
the street children are left behind.  These children are the victims of the
society, and its valiant efforts to correct these kids into worthy menbers
of society.  But the real problem
may just be that what Pixote finds, is also a lot of corruption right above
his head, which undermines the efforts of anyone around him.  The reform
school's leaders are also people whose motives  could be questioned, and
they often lie to get the results they want, or they strive to hide the
truth, just so that the government and the
press will leave them alone to do their job.</P>
<P>With some performances that really shine, Fernando Ramos da Silva as Pixote
and Jorge Juliao as the gay friend, this film ends up being very attractive,
and one that made the circles in the art houses for film in the early 80's.
One just can't help feeling sorry for those kids, and the sad life they
lead, and the attempts ( by all parties ) to improve, be it justified or
not.</P>
<P>This film signaled the entry of HECTOR BABENCO as a major director of film
in Brasil, and later in the world stage.  If there is a trial going on,
however, the real question is, did this film help the social  plight on
behalf of these children.... this remains to be seen.  As opposed to LOS
OLVIDADOS, which became a bitter, and satiric, look on those who surrounded
the children, this film does make an effort to present a solution.... but
where does it end.??? It doesn't.... and the film can not end, since we know
the participants are "out there"
and still a part of that system.  LOS OLVIDADOS became a story of an
individual or two, who had moments where his visions, or interpretations, of
what happened in front of him, dominated the stage.... here, the
outside world dominates the space.... and the children are manipulated
throughout... I suppose that Pixote wants a break from all this, and his
scene, where he merely wants to suckle, rather than make love to the
prostitute that has becoome his mother of sorts, becomes the focal point,
and the lack of understanding that these children suffer from. A moment when
absolution is at hand, becomes a moment of destruction. And the prostitute,
who probably came from the same circles does not understand any better the
needs... she can only think of herself as a product, with a mission in
mind... to earn money to make a living.</P>
<P>The film is careful not to make a judgement here, although the prostitutes
plight, is scary to her.  She is afraid of getting pregnant, because it
prevents her from paying rent.</P>
<P>Very good film, although it could be considered sordid, and sad.</P>
