Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Lawrence Kasdan has grown to adore narrative sprawl.  A writer who
once contributed to tight genre entertainments like THE EMPIRE STRIKES
BACK, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and BODY HEAT, Kasdan became a film-maker
with a problem: He over-indulged his own characters, and let his stories
wander wherever those characters wanted to go.  He attracted wonderful
actors because he wrote wonderful parts, but he seemed little interested
in making those parts part of a whole.  Sometimes (THE BIG CHILL,
SILVERADO, GRAND CANYON) those untamed scripts still turned into
satisfying episodic films; sometimes (THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, WYATT EARP)
they turned into meandering acting showcases.</P>
<P>     MUMFORD, Kasdan's latest exercise in free-form ensemble, has the germ
of a great story at the core of his narrative...and he promptly drowns
that germ in the pencillin of his herky-jerky directing.  The story begins
in the small town town of Mumford, where a recently-arrived psychologist
also named Mumford (Loren Dean) is developing a booming practice with his
unconventional methods.  Doc Mumford endears himself to virtually
everyone, including the town's equally unconventional billionaire modem
magnate Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), but it turns out Doc Mumford has a
secret.  Though his therapy brings results, his credentials aren't exactly
conventional either.  In fact, he's not a psychologist at all.</P>
<P>     It takes a while before Kasdan spills all the beans about Doc 
Mumford's back story, but by then you can already see everything that's
right and everything that's wrong about MUMFORD.  On the plus side --
predictably for a Kasdan film -- is the cast, filled with appealing
character performers.  Loren Dean's low-key, natural delivery is perfect
for the no-nonsense Doc Mumford, Jason Lee shows a sweetness far more
convincing than it was in KISSING A FOOL, and the radiant Hope Davis lends
her unique gifts to Sofie, the chronically fatigued patient for whom Doc
Mumford falls.  Kasdan drops these characters into the kind of bucolic,
milkman-served town that would appeal to anyone looking for a fresh start.
It's the ideal set-up for a comic romance with complications.</P>
<P>     But MUMFORD isn't a comic romance with complications, at least not
often enough.  Much of its running time is devoted to Doc Mumford's
sessions with a variety of patients:  a housewife who shops compulsively
(Mary McDonnell); a pharmacist with pulp fiction fantasies (Pruitt Taylor
Vince); a sulky teen with self-image problems (Zooey Deschanel).  Though
the actors are all fine, their characters are a huge distraction.  Kasdan
certainly needs to show Doc Mumford's gift for helping people, but he
includes far too many such scenes.  Once again, Kasdan finds himself
unable or unwilling to rein in his supporting characters.  In the process,
he loses track of MUMFORD'S backbone, creating a film that bumps along
with virtually no flow.</P>
<P>     That lack of momentum is most evident when it becomes clear that
MUMFORD's payoff will be a relationship between Mumford and Sofie.  There
are a couple of perfectly charming scenes between Dean and Davis, but
there's no way to anticipate that the film is leading up to a choice based
on those scenes.  MUMFORD more often plays as a subtle jab at therapy,
suggesting that a really good listener who knows something about
overcoming troubles is all an unhappy soul really needs.  That's an
interesting enough concept, but it doesn't exactly make for a satisfying
story; watching Doc Mumford's patient list hijack the film only emphasizes
that MUMFORD should have been about the doctor.  The saying goes that
there are no small parts, only small actors.  Lawrence Kasdan seems to
agree...to a fault.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 casting couches:  5.</PRE>
