<PRE>BLOOD SIMPLE (1985)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Joel Coen
Writers: Joel and Ethan Coen
Starring: Frances McDormand, John Getz, Dan Hedaya, M. Emmet Walsh,
Samm-Art Williams</PRE>
<P>"Blood Simple" is a bit like a horror film interlaced with a film noir
backdrop: the film is filled with a bunch of frightening nightmares (like
being forced to kill someone, an overabundance of blood, being buried
alive, etc.), but the story is an ever-twisting bit of complex film noir. 
It's also the film debut of the now-famous Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan,
and watching it today, one could easily deduct that the Coen Brothers had
not yet found their style, and therefore the film is kind of lacking or
something or other.  But when viewed as a real film, it's really an amazing
piece of storytelling, and one hell of a fun one at that.</P>
<P>The plot of "Blood Simple" is so complex and labyrinthine that to tell
everything would be to spoil half the fun of the fun of viewing it, as it's
a film that is always in motion, and is chock-full of suprises that are
really surprising (how's that for a concept?).  But the basic plot deals
with a seedy bar owner, Marty (Dan Hedaya), who's wife Abby (a very young
Frances McDormand) is found cheating with one of his bartenders, Ray (John
Getz), so Marty decides after much angered thought that he'll hire a
Private Investigator, Visser (M. Emmet Walsh), the same one who discovered
them for him, to kill them.</P>
<P>Up to this point, it's standard film noir and nothing really spectacular,
but then the film throws us for a loop, which I won't spoil, and the film
from that point on becomes a tense, nightmarish experience, filled with
twists upon twists upon twists, and ending with a final laugh, not on the
audiences' part, but on one of the characters.  What's most remarkable
about this film is that it doesn't try to throw the audience off with cheap
twists; instead it tells it to us as omnipotent viewers, knowing
everything, and because of this we watch helplessly as the characters on
screen stumble around without all the facts.</P>
<P>When one carefully thinks and comes to their own conclusion about this film
(this film is anything but condescending and insulting), one realizes that
no character is one hundred percent certain what's going on.  The film is
told so that the characters are often confused, and we follow each of them
around as they try and figure everything out, and often do things that they
wouldn't do if they knew everything.  One character walks in to a place at
the wrong time, and is forced to do a horrific act that will haunt him the
rest of the film.  And another character discovers that they have left
incriminating evidence around but don't know where it is.  And yet another
character has no clue what's going on until the final couple seconds of the
film.  Even a couple characters live with the guilt of things they did not
even do, but for some exaplainable reason think they did.  The plot of
"Blood Simple" is carefully constructed so that all this is assured with
intelligence and even wit.</P>
<P>This being the film debut of the Coens, we can see that they hadn't really
gotten their wacky, eccentric style down yet, which wouldn't erupt until
their next film, the hysterically funny comedy "Raising Arizona."  But no
matter; this film would be ruined with any of that kind of style.  It's not
the kind of film that would be good if it was hysterical or wacky.  But
this film does have the kind of great direction it needs.  It has lots of
great shots that are very remarkable, including a misleading tracking shot
which at first looks like a POV shot, then turns out to be just a low-angle
smooth steadicam closing shot.  And several sequences are intensely
crafted, like a long bit where one character tries to dispose of a corpse
(including a bit they would recycle in "Fargo"), and the finale, which is
one of the most frightening sequences filmed, ending perfectly with a
little cherry on top at the end.</P>
<P>The performances aren't really amazing or anything, save for M. Emmet
Walsh's, who's predictably brilliant (when isn't he?) as the unscrupulous
and wonderfully selfish crooked P.I.  He easily steals the film.  But Dan
Hedaya's also very good, even though it doesn't seem like he's good at
first (he's usually hysterically tense), but upon closer examination, he's
great as a man who has held all his rage up inside, and can't control
himself when he boils over in fits of rage.  Also good is Frances
McDormand, who mostly plays the frightened woman.  It's no Margie
Gunderson, but what are ya gonna do?  The only not too great performance is
from John Getz, who is remarkably down-playing his part.  Getz's forte is
playing pompous asswholes (in such anti-classics as "Men at Work" and
"Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead" - yes, I've seen them); here he
seems just a bit weak.</P>
<P>It's often been said "Blood Simple" is the best Coen Brothers film, or at
least a contender for best with "Fargo."  I personally think "Fargo" is a
better film, much more better realized and executed.  But "Blood Simple" is
still one of their best films, a masterfully crafted and executed thriller
film noir that surprises us with lots of twists, and some truly
awe-inspiring sequences which scare the hell out of us merely because we
the audience know to much and are not sure how to react to seeing a
character do something we know they shouldn't do but they don't.  It would
be easy to take "Blood Simple" for granted, calling it merely "a great
thriller."  It's not just that.  It's a film that is so carefully
constructed and so modest about it that it amazes you when you finally
realize it.</P>
