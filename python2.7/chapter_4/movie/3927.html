<PRE>                            THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER
                                (A Second Look)
                       A film review by Anna G. McDougald
                        Copyright 1995 Anna G. McDougald</PRE>
<P>     When John McTiernan's film of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER opened in
the spring of 1990 early reactions were mixed.  Those who had read Tom
Clancy's novel were upset at the way the story had been edited down.
Those who had NOT read the book wondered how the tale could retain any
relevance given the ongoing collapse of Soviet military power.  And
English speaking audiences everywhere were puzzled by the selection of
Sean Connery as the movie's lead.</P>
<P>     Nonetheless, the film became--and remains--a success, attracting a
world wide fan following which it continues to enjoy.  Many who admit
to repeated viewings cite the superb acting, acting, direction, and
sound as the picture's chief attractions, along with a spellbinding
quality not quite so easy to explain.</P>
<P>     What exactly casts that spell becomes more and more obvious as the
Cold War fades into history.  Today's viewer discovers more than just
another "geopolitical thriller."  For Tom Clancy's story, as adapted by
the able John McTiernan, emerges as a clever retelling of the most
famous submarine epic of them all.</P>
<P>     When Alec Baldwin is seen as the ingenuous Professor Aronnax,
Scott Glenn as the cynical Ned Land and Courtney Vance as a compelling
and very hip Consuelo the choice of Connery as the moody Master of the
Deep is revealed as a stroke of genius.  Even the glittering hardware
and vast scale of the Red October--in contrast to the dark and
claustrophobic sets normally presented in submarine movies--make sense.
For the menacing, mysteriously-driven Red October is, from this
perspective, the re-incarnation of Jules Verne's Nautilus, and her
Commander, a latter-day Nemo.</P>
<P>     (Physically, Connery is a virtual double for Nemo as Verne
describes him.  In one of the more charming passages, Nemo--having
amused himself by testing poor Aronnax's facility with foreign
languages--informs the Professor that though his books have made for
good reading they could, in Nemo's opinion, stand improvement!)</P>
<P>     How McTiernan moves his story to a thunderous denouement while
remaining faithful to both Clancy *and* Verne delights and astonishes
audiences to this day.  But not content to simply update the Verne
tale, McTiernan--aided by Connery's unforgettable portrayal and by
Basil Poledouris' rich and highly anthemic orchestral score--adds to
the film a spiritual dimension that cannot fail to resonate with even
those who have never heard of Tom Clancy, or of a Nautilus far older
than America's atom-powered version.</P>
<P>     The ambiguous tone of the film is established at the very outset,
as the mixed choir's haunting and evocative "Dosvedanye, Rodina"
("Farewell, My Homeland") contrasts sharply with the all-male chorus,
extravagant in its praise for the destructive capabilities of their new
weapon.  The film itself is filled with allusions to martyrdom and
resurrection.  The grouping of officers in the wardroom shortly after
the Red October sails echoes da Vinci's "Last Supper"; Ramius' bunk
fits him uncannily like a coffin while a "lift" from Melville allows
Sam Neill to play Starbuck to Connery's Ahab; a small cross appears
briefly amid the geysering spray of a submarine explosion; and the
finale aboard the Red October calls to mind an old sailors' metaphor
for passage to a better life--making Ryan's closing line both
poignant and prophetic.</P>
<P>     For all these reasons, increasingly apparent as the Cold War
continues to fade from memory, John McTiernan's HUNT FOR RED
OCTOBER--far from becoming another piece of nostalgic
propaganda--stands revealed at last as a brilliant reworking of a
masterpiece, capable of standing as a classic on its own.</P>
