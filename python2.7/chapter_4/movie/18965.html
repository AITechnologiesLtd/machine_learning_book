<P>+ The following is the first capsule review of my internet career. From now 
on, if I see a movie that doesn't warrant a full-length review for a myriad 
of reasons, then I will write a capsule one.</P>
<P>Director Mark Rosman's "The House on Sorority Row" is a stylishly-filmed, 
slightly above-average slasher film that nonetheless has the characters 
mindlessly going off alone in the dark for the simple reason of being 
slaughtered. The story focuses on a group of sorority sisters who have just 
graduated from college, but before they go are planning to throw a party. To 
get back at their sorority headmaster, an older woman (Lois Kelso Hunt) who 
gave birth to a deformed child twenty years before, they plan to play a 
little prank on her, only to see it backfire when they accidentally shoot her 
for real. After disposing of the body in the school's decrepit swimming pool, 
their party must go on. Only problem is, the body soon disappears from the 
water, and the girls start dropping off like flies. You know where the story 
is going every second of the way, and you find yourself yelling at the 
characters on-screen for doing idiotic things in the most dire of 
circumstances. Rosman, you're a polished director with a lot of promise, but 
give the viewer a little credit, why don't you!</P>
