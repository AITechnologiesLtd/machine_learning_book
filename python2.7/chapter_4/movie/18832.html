<P>
 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring
Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Heather Graham and Michael York.</P>
<P> Austin Powers is back, bad teeth, elephantine libido and all. And like in
the original, Mike Myers has stretched a one-joke premise to the breaking
point.</P>
<P> "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is more of a series of sketches
and shtick, rather than a cohesive, follow-the-plot feature.</P>
<P> I mean, how can it be anything else considering Myers' free-flow imagination.</P>
<P> No, what "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is really is a Valentine to the 1960s
and the spy melodramas that proliferated during that era. The super-stud,
super-agents such as Bond and Flint who could kill a man with one hand
while caressing a woman with the other.</P>
<P> Those who loved the first Austin Powers movie will undoubtedly enjoy this
sequel, which is basically more of the same. Those who felt the original
movie was stupid and childish are advised that they are taking their
chances here.</P>
<P> For like the original, the humor in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is that kind
of juvenile, smuttiness, double-entendre jokiness we all thought was so
cool in junior high school.</P>
<P> The premise of "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is quite simple. Austin Powers'
nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), travels back to 1969 and steals Powers'
mojo - his libidinous life force. The theft doesn't seem to incapacitate
our hero, or even slow him down. It merely keeps him from bedding luscious
CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), while Dr. Evil tries to carry
out his nefarious plan to extort millions from the nations of the world.</P>
<P> The movie does have some funny bits: Dr. Evil trying to reconcile with his
estranged son, Scott, on "The Jerry Springer Show"; a romantic sidewalk
interlude during which Austin and Felicity dance to "I'll Never Fall in
Love Again," as played by Burt Bacharach and sung by Elvis Costello; and
most of all two very well-edited sequences in which people around the world
see Dr. Evil's spaceship - which has a very distinctive shape - and
continually use phallic euphemisms and slang to call attention to it.</P>
<P> Graham is deliciously funny as Shagwell, entering the spirit of the
enterprise with a twinkle in her eyes and a smile on her lips.</P>
<P> Myers, of course, is becoming a master at the knowing nod, the mischievous
pause that lets the audience know that he, too, is in on the joke, whether
he is portraying Austin Powers or Dr. Evil.</P>
<P> However most of the tomfoolery that comes between the sequences seems like
empty filler.</P>
<P> Even the introduction of some new characters, including Mini-Me, a
diminutive double of Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, a one-ton slovenly killer
Scot, also portrayed by Myers, cannot cover the cracks in silly going-ons.</P>
<P> Myers and co-screenwriter Michael McCullers constantly walk the edge of
bad taste, but skirt it with a wink and a smile.</P>
<P> "The Spy Who Shagged Me," honestly, is a movie no one in their right mind
can take seriously. It is a spoof, a parody, but its flaw is that it
continually meanders around trying to cram in too many affectionate riffs
about the 1960s.</P>
<P> A little more discipline and a lot less scatology and sex jokes would have
made for a better - and funnier - picture.</P>
