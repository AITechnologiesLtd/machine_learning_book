<PRE>"Screwed" (2000) * (out of four)</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewksi.</PRE>
<P>Starring Norm MacDonald, Dave Chapelle, Elaine
Stritch, Sherman Hemsley, Daniel Benzali, and Danny
Devito</P>
<P>The most popular trend of the last couple of years has
been the twist ending. Watching one of these movies,
everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are
blown away by an unexpected surprise. When the film
ends, there is a moment of confusion, then
recollection, then some more confusion, then possibly
a second viewing for clarification. This is a
description of an ideal twist that perfects everything
it sets out to do and more. Good surprises make movies
fun to watch. Then there are the bad twists. You
either know what is going to happen ten minutes into
the movie (I'm talking about you Reindeer Games) or
you did not guess the ending because it is so
outrageously stupid. Screwed perfectly suits the
latter description. What starts out as a dumb guilty
pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of
friends ends with a complex finale with way too much
going on. </P>
<P>By the writers of Man on the Moon and The People Vs.
Larry Flynt, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski
leave Milos Forman behind and take a stab at film
directing. Whoops. Screwed is an inane Christmas Carol
gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting
embarrassments. Norm MacDonald stars as Willard
Filmore, a hard working chauffeur who just wants a
little respect from his rich, old, insidious boss,
Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch). When he overhears her
plans to fire him on Christmas day, Willard is
convinced by his best friend Rusty (Dave Chapelle) to
kidnap Crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of
one million dollars. Too excited to pay any attention,
the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog
escapes and returns home. Now Crock thinks Willard has
been kidnapped and the two friends, realizing they can
make even more money, decide to stage the fake
kidnapping. Of course, everything that could go wrong
does. </P>
<P>The first forty-five minutes of Screwed is harmless
entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be
enjoyably bad. But the convoluted script eventually
builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear. The
more idiotic these characters get, the more reckless
the script becomes. At one point, I wanted to get out
of my seat and yell at these characters: "No, you
idiot!" I'm not just talking about Willard and Rusty,
who were extremely annoying, I'm also talking about
the cops in this film. A monkey could have solved this
case within an hour but these guys (headed by Murder
One's Daniel Benzali) were just too clueless to
forgive. They give real cops bad names. </P>
<P>Also poor Danny Devito apparently does not know how to
turn down a role these days. Looking almost identical
to his Penguin in Batman: Returns, every time he
appeared on the screen I had to shake my head in
disbelief. He just didn't belong in this movie.
MacDonald and Chapelle are veterans at these kinds of
movies but Devito made the film much worse than it
already was, gross out humor is certainly not his
forte. </P>
<P>If you're a fan of Norm MacDonald's other chaotic
comedy, Dirty Work, you might actually love this
near-sequel. Otherwise, don't get screwed out of your
hard-earned money. </P>
