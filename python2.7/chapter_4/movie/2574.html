<P>"I promise I will lose for at least an hour."
     - Gibson as Maverick, to a table of reluctant poker players.</P>
<P>     MAVERICK, the first of two Warner westerns to hit the summer screen, 
reteams Mel Gibson and Richard Donner for an update of the 1957-62 ABC TV 
series. Despite a pair of ace co-stars and a script by SUNDANCE scribe 
William Goldman, MAVERICK is merely an OK corral of top talent.</P>
<P>     "Maverick" is Bret Maverick (Gibson), a sharp-witted, sharp-shooting 
card player en route to a championship poker game. He's cashing old debts 
as he rides between towns, making both friends and enemies along the way. 
His "love" is a pesky pickpocket (Foster), his foil is a former lawman 
(Garner, who originated the title role on television) and, together, they 
face everything from a runaway stage to not-so-renegade indians.</P>
<P>     MAVERICK proves, once again, that what works on paper doesn't always 
work on-screen. This witty western-wannabe isn't exactly D.O.A., but it 
ain't exactly F.U.N., either. Simply, MAVERICK never comes alive.</P>
<P>     Gibson makes a gamely gambler, but, compared to his antsy antics as 
detective Martin Riggs, the man-with-a-face seems stuck in slow motion. 
Foster is a loss with her (intentionally?) bad Southern accent and Garner 
doesn't get enough shared screen time to truly tap his talents.</P>
<P>     (If you commit to sit, don't miss scene-stealing Graham Greene as an 
indian who addresses Maverick as "Mav.")</P>
<P>     Donner's direction is hardly lethal. The man can make a movie, no 
question, but he lacks the precision to punch-up a standard set-piece 
like a runaway stage. He's backed by a posse of pros, though, and therein 
lies the irony. Far from an inspiring experience, MAVERICK is *still* 
crafted better than recent roundups TOMBSTONE and GERONIMO.</P>
<P>     Film fans should savor a cornucopia of cameos recruited from film, 
television, and country music. Blink and you'll miss Corey Feldman, 
Margot Kidder, Doug McClure, Dan Hedaya, Dub Taylor, Denver Pyle, Robert 
Fuller, Hal Ketchum, Waylon Jennings, and Clint Blink.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Despite a treasure trove of top talent both before and
              behind the camera, MAVERICK is another western-by-numbers 
              that delivers more yawns than yukes.</PRE>
