A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Martin Brest</PRE>
<P>Written by: Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman</P>
<P>Ingredients: The grim reaper, old man, beautiful daughter</P>
<P>Starring: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
An aging, weakened, but fabulously wealthy senior news tycoon named Bill
(Anthony Hopkins) utters some words to his nubile daughter Susan (Claire
Forlani) about how only the experience of true love makes life worth
living. The Grim Reaper who is death personified (Brad Pitt) overhears
Bill's tribute to true love and becomes intrigued. He visits Bill to cut
a deal. Inhabiting the body of Joe Black, a recently deceased young man,
the Grim Reaper promises to delay Bill's death in exchange for Bill
showing him life. Unaware that Death is inhabiting the body, Susan
remembers her dad's lecture on true love and tries to start up a
relationship with Joe Black.</P>
<P>Opinion:
MEET JOE BLACK is three hours long and feels like it is three hours
long. Some of the parts are done well. For example, the scenes where
Bill contemplates his impending death and begins to pay more attention
to his eldest daughter are sure to bring tears. On the other hand, other
scenes feel odd. For example, Joe Black's height varies throughout the
picture. Another example is when an old man promises a woman he will
meet her for a fireworks display at the bottom of the hill. As she is
waiting for him she suddenly senses something wrong. Sure enough, the
old guy is dying on top of the hillside overlooking the fireworks.
Seeing him stumbling at the top of the hill, the woman runs up the hill
in alarm. But oddly she completely disregards the dying man when her
boyfriend arrives to woo her. </P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani do a good job acting the
father/daughter bond. And for Brad Pitt fans, MEET JOE BLACK features
Brad in several nice outfits, with his trademark hairstyle. </P>
