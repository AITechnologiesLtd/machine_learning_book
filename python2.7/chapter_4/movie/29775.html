<PRE>LIAM</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>LIAM, a lackluster rendition of an ANGELA'S ASHES-type story by director Stephen
Frears (HIGH FIDELITY), connects all of the usual dots.  About a family facing
unrelenting poverty due to "the yards" being closed, the 1930s British story
concerns the usual themes of the rich vs. the poor, the haves vs. the have-nots
and upstairs vs. downstairs.  </P>
<P>The out-of-work dad (Ian Hart) vows never to accept a helping hand from the
Catholic Church, lest he end up beholding to the local priest.  That the dad
won't accept help from the church is a key to the plot since it is the church in
general and the Catholic Church in particular that serves as the movie's chief
whipping boy.  Just as secular religions like environmentalism are universally
acclaimed in films without question, Christianity generally appears in movies
only to present an easy villain.  In LIAM, the Catholic teachers and priests are
sadistic figures that make the devil look pretty attractive by comparison.  One
of the film's themes contrasts Christianity and Communism, with Communism coming
out more compassionate.  In the movie's least credible part, Jews enter the
story only so that the movie can boldly beat its chest against both
anti-Semitism and Fascism.</P>
<P>Most of the story, however, is more tedious and clichéd than political.  It is
in Jimmy McGovern's script that most of the problems lie.  The acting, with one
notable exception, is fine.  With a single dour expression, young actor Anthony
Borrows plays Liam, a lad of about eight.  The over-the-top script feels it
necessary to give Liam a horrendous stutter, as if his character weren't tragic
enough already.  When Liam begins to speak, he looks as if he is suffering
through an especially difficult bowel movement.  In contrast, Ian Hart, as the
sullen and prideful father, is palpably poor.</P>
<P>The ending to LIAM is not to be believed.  It has one of those horrible and
ridiculously improbable ending incidents that occur only as plot devices in
movies.  If you're looking for a LIAM-type story, rent the genuine article,
ANGELA'S ASHES, instead.  The latter has its problems, but it's much preferable
to LIAM.</P>
<P>LIAM runs 1:30.  It is rated R for "some nudity and language" and would be
acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>The film is playing now in nationwide release in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the Camera Cinemas and the Century Theaters.</P>
