<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A captivating melodrama, which was recently restored by Canadian
archivists. It features a tale laced with severe Arctic weather
conditions, a ferocious dog, a heartless villain and his unsympathetic
compatriots, and an innocent couple who must defend themselves against
all odds.</P>
<P>This silent film was made in 1919, after the film's Canadian born star,
Nell Shipman, made a film in 1916, which was adapted from a novel by
James Oliver Curwood. Here, the production team of Nell, her husband
Ernest, and the writer Curwood, decide to back their own film. It was
filmed in Alberta, Canada, under severe conditions, which caused the
leading male star, Australian actor Ronald Byram, to come down with
pneumonia and die. He was replaced in the film by Wheeler Oakman, who
doesn't have much of a part.</P>
<P>Living in an idyllic forest setting with her father (Laidlaw), Dolores
LeBeau (Shipman) meets an intellectual surveyor from the government,
Peter Burke (Oakman), and falls in love with him. When he goes off
surveying, a brutal criminal, Rydal (Playter), wanted by the Mounted
Police, kills his arresting policeman, steals his uniform and tries to
flee the country. But he's sidetracked when he sees the beautiful
Dolores swimming nude in the Kern River; she actually wore a pink
leotard. He then tries to rape her, as his partner tries to ward off her
father. But when the father kills him, Rydal arrests his father and
forcefully takes him in handcuffs. As Dolores follows, she sees him
throw her father off a cliff into a water falls. It is too late for
Dolores to rescue him and he dies.</P>
<P>Back in the city for the past year, Peter and Dolores are married and
living a conventional life. But Dolores is a nature girl and yearns to
be back in God's country to be among the bears, porcupines, and
multitude of animals. Securing passage aboard a trading vessel heading
for the Arctic Circle, "The Flying Moon," she will find out, when they
are on their way, that their unseen captain is Rydal. She is scared to
tell Peter this, because he threatens to kill him. So she decides to
fend for herself against his advances. But he lays a trap for them and
drops a sail on Peter, causing him to be bed-ridden and in need of
medical treatment or he will die.</P>
<P>When they land at a trading post it's one run by Rydal's accomplice, a
wormy trader named Blake (Charles Arling). He offers her no hope and
tells her the nearest doctor is at Fort Confidence, miles away across
the snowy wilderness of the Barrens where the temperature dips to 60
below zero. Blake also has a Great Dane, called Wapi, whom he calls a
devil and constantly whips. When Dolores sees this, she offers the dog
her gentle, loving touch, and the dog runs away from Blake to stay with
her.</P>
<P>When she demands a dog-sled team to take her and Peter to Fort
Confidence, she overhears Blake secretly tell Rydal that he'll send two
teams: "one with the wife and the other with the husband and his men
will make sure that only the woman will return -- for you!" Dolores
shoots Blake in the arm and escapes with her husband in a race to get to
Fort Confidence before Rydal, who is in hot pursuit of them. They get
unexpected help from Wapi, who saves the day and attacks Rydal's dog
team.</P>
<P>The most interesting shot in the film was cameraman Joseph Walker's
double exposures in a dream sequence, which he did by stopping and
taking repeated shots of the animals involved in that scene. As for Nell
Shipman, she was a real nature lover and devoted her life to the Great
Outdoors. The story was a conventional hero against villain one, but the
film had a certain splendor about it that elevated its melodramatics.
Also, the wilderness scenes had a sparkle to them that gave additional
breathe to the mundane story.</P>
