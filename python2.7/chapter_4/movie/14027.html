<PRE>Elmer Gantry (1960)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 61</PRE>
<P>"Elmer Gantry" was a controversial film when it
was released.  So controversial, that no studio
would finance it.  Based on a Sinclair Lewis
novel, preachers are often depicted as cynical,
fundraising businessmen who consider themselves
to be in the entertainment industry.</P>
<P>Burt Lancaster is the title character, a small-time
salesman, con artist, and would-be preacher.  He
latches onto popular evangelist Jean Simmons, elbowing
into her traveling tent show.  While Simmons takes
the kindler and gentler route to saving souls,
Lancaster preaches fire and brimstone.  Lancaster
tries to change his sinful ways to win Simmons' heart,
but has a lapse upon meeting a woman from his past,
now a prostitute (Shirley Jones).</P>
<P>Considered a classic, "Elmer Gantry" has received
much critical acclaim.  Lancaster won his only
Best Actor Oscar for the film, which also won for
Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture.
Despite her small role, Jones won Best Supporting
Actress.  Jones had been typecast as The Girl Next Door,
so her cynical hooker role must have shocked some.</P>
<P>"Elmer Gantry" has problems that prevent it
from being a very good film.  Lancaster's character
shifts like the wind.  Early, he appears to be
a grasping if charming con artist.  Upon befriending
Simmons, he drops his bad habits (drinking, smoking,
gambling) just like that.  He mixes heroic actions
with manipulative ones.  Does he love or lust for
Simmons, or is he simply using her as a platform for
a preaching career?  Jones' character is also
too flexible.  At first she is fun-loving but
cynical, but suddenly she seems to be in seriously
in love with Lancaster.</P>
<P>There are some spoilers in the following.</P>
<P>The last third of the film is increasingly
bewildering.  Arthur Kennedy, playing a newspaper
man with the utmost integrity who hangs around
the revivalists, betrays them with a devastating
column, but later gets into a fistfight *for* them.
Lancaster finally seduces the spiritual Simmons,
and neither has any regret, anger or guilt afterwards.
Lancaster's character is completely destroyed, then
completely redeemed, in a few days.  Jones
blackmails Lancaster, then won't take the money,
then tells the press that Lancaster was setup.
Why the sudden turn-around?  Is Lancaster that
hunky?  Lancaster, who is enraged at Jones, ends
up beating up a man who is attacking her.  His
suit is pelted with fruit, but is spotless in
the next scene.  A deaf man is healed by Simmons.
How?  Why?  Then she is killed in a fire, an artificial
contrivance to bring the story to a close.</P>
