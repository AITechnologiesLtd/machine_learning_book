<P>_The_Deep_End_of_the_Ocean_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Michelle Pfeiffer turns in an impassioned performance of often
gut-wrenching intensity in a film that deserves far less.  It's not that
the basic story is without promise.  Beth Cappadora (Pfeiffer) loses her
three-year-old son, only to have him resurface on her doorstep nine years
later with no recollection of his former family (Ryan Merriman plays the
now-12-year-old son).  It's a setup ripe with psychological and emotional
conflict, and apparently Jacquelyn Mitchard did it justice in her novel of
the same name, which was not only a bestseller but none other than a
selection in Oprah Winfrey's book club.</P>
<P>However, director Ulu Grosbard and scripter Stephen Schiff follow
pedestrian TV-movie-like paces, from the abrupt and overly tidy ending to
the rebelliously-bitter-yet-guilt-ridden older brother, well-played by
Emmy-winning _General_Hospital_ star Jonathan Jackson.  In fact, all the
characters are well-played by the actors.  It's just that the material is
about as shallow as its deeply metaphoric title (the meaning of which, for
the record, is never explained in the film).</P>
