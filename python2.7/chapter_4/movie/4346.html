<PRE>                          THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1995 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(*** out of four)</PRE>
<P>     A wonderful Rob Reiner film that expertly combines comedy, drama,
romance and even some sociopolitical commentary, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
chronicles the newfound romance of a lonely widower (Michael Douglas)
who just happens to be leader of the free world.  And having a
sexually-frustrated president who exercises the pocket veto in the
absence of female companionship can never be a good thing.  So when
Douglas finds himself actually about to make a pass at Janet Reno, he
decides it might be time to find a first lady.</P>
<P>     In walks Annette Bening, an environmental lobbyist who's trying to
make sure Douglas will support a fossil-fuel bill to be sent to
Congress.  And something about the 97-octane perfume she wears gets to
Douglas, so he asks her to a state dinner, your average first date.  One
thing leads to another and soon he's emancipating her in the Lincoln
bedroom.  Interestingly enough, five minutes into the act, a tour guide
leads a group of tourists into the bedroom... "And this is the Lincoln
bedr--OH MY GOD!"</P>
<P>     As it has a propensity to do, the press soon finds out about the
fling.  The cabinet, which includes Michael J. Fox (who I suspect got
down on his knees and begged Reiner to put him in the movie) and
talented character actor David Paymer (of QUIZ SHOW and MR. SATURDAY
NIGHT, among others), is appalled, knowing Douglas' main opposition, an
evil Republican senator (Richard Dreyfuss) will have a field day
smearing Douglas with peanut butter... no, with the affair.  Of course,
in Hollywood, the phrase "evil Republican" is all but redundant.  One
of the few faults of THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is its portrayal of the
right wing as heartless and incompetent and liberals as the world's
humble messiahs, while completely ignoring indisputable facts about the
Republican party--that Rush Limbaugh always tells the truth, Ronald
Reagan never forgets and Newt Gingrich in no way resembles Doc from
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.</P>
<P>     THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT features first-rate writing, directing and
acting.  Surprisingly, even Michael J. Fox has graduated from the
superficialities of insulting Mallory and Jennifer and traveling
through time in a Delorean to the world of dramatic acting.  And as
usual, Bening, Dreyfuss and Paymer all give good performances.  Douglas
shines in what is the second Hollywood version of Bill Clinton
(remember Kevin Kline in DAVE?).  Douglas even looks like Clinton
(Michael, if you're reading this, no offense man.) and seems to have
mastered Clinton's mannersims, even down to the exact manner in which
he signs bills, downs a box of super-size fries in one gulp and
unhooks the bras of Washington women with the greatest of ease.</P>
<P>     This is definitely a terrific romance comedy that is believable,
intelligent and touching, even if it does have political correctness
coming out its ... lower posterior region.  I would have used that three
letter word with the one A and two S's but I too have been stricken
with the P.C. virus of late.  Well, except for the jokes about having
sex in the Lincoln bedroom, Reagan's Alzheimer's and Clinton's
reputation for promiscuity.</P>
