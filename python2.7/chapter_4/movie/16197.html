<P>HOLY MAN
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Touchstone / 1:54 / 1998 / PG (language, some naughty humor)
Cast: Jeff Goldblum; Eddie Murphy; Kelly Preston; Robert Loggia; John 
Cryer; Eric McCormack; Sam Kitchin; Robert Small; Morgan Fairchild 
Director: Stephen Herek 
Screenplay: Tom Schulman <HR>With the talents of Eddie Murphy and a premise that satirizes the 
home-shopping phenom, Disney's "Holy Man" could have really been a 
divine comedy. Instead, it's an unholy mess, and a large part of the 
finger-wagging should be directed at those behind the scenes who decided 
to bury the promising star-and-story-combo underneath sloppy streaks of 
sentimentality and seriousness. Talk about a film not knowing what it 
has - all of this sinful squandering is enough to send "Holy Man" 
straight to the nearest confessional. </P>
<P>Forgive Murphy but not the movie. The comedian's turn as a bald, 
homeless, robe-clad purveyor of peace, love and happiness is a beatific 
breath of fresh air, especially on the heels of some delightfully 
unhinged work in summer's stirring "Mulan" and scatological "Dr. 
Dolittle." His character is simply called G, and the letter might as 
well be his rating, too - waiting for Murphy to cut loose in the wild 
ways that post-"Nutty Professor" crowds crave is ultimately fruitless. 
In "Holy Man," he doesn't get to fart or cuss or crack wise about sexual 
functions. It must be that higher plain. </P>
<P>A near-auto mishap puts G's spiritual pilgrimage on hold when, while 
wandering the highways of Miami, he's almost hit by a Jaguar belonging 
to harried television executive Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum). Ricky, who 
works for the struggling, QVC-esque Good Buy Shopping Network, 
reluctantly allows G to convalesce at his beach-side home, and it's only 
a matter of time before the recovered prophet winds up on the small 
screen, hawking junky goods like seasonal doormats and a bidet that 
sprays its user with "a kiss of refreshing mist." </P>
<P>Here's the twist: G preaches as he pitches, assuring viewers that they 
would probably be better off _not_ giving into materialistic whims, but 
people buy big time anyhow. Too bad Murphy's Zenistic life lessons are 
completely transparent and often play like long-winded set-ups for 
punchlines that never arrive. The pokes at consumer culture are dead-on, 
but too often the film brushes aside the funny stuff for surprisingly 
straight-faced subplots, the eye-rolling pinnacle of which is a romantic 
sidetrack between Ricky and a cute media analyst (Kelly Preston). </P>
<P>"Holy Man" gets so loaded down with all this unnecessary bunk that it 
completely loses track of what it set out to spoof - even Murphy 
disappears for large chunks of the movie's second hour so the focus can 
be turned to heavy-handed drama, complete with a schmaltzy soundtrack 
and slow fade-outs. But all is not lost; Murphy and Goldblum make 
fantastic foils during the limited time they have together, and the film 
trots out a galaxy of self-depreciating stars to poke some sly fun at 
celebrity image as they push their products on Good Buy. </P>
<P>There's Morgan Fairchild's fabulous facelift machine and James Brown's 
ambulance-alerting medical belt that screams, "Help me, help me! Good 
God!" But the best bit finds ex-Golden Girl Betty White peddling an 
aphrodisiac scent that makes her climax right there on the air. As for 
most everything else, buyer - and viewer - beware.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"So the two continue to drop fruit, finally dropping a whole lot of 
fruit. End of scene, with a whole lot of fruit on the sidewalk. At least 
when David Letterman was dropping watermelons off buildings he showed 
them hitting the sidewalk in slow motion." -Roger Ebert on "That Old 
Feeling"</P>
