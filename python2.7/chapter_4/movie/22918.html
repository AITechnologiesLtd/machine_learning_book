<P>     Sometimes, a play makes for a good film. Sometimes it doesn't. It's
tough to put a finger on what can make a stage-to-screen translation fall
flat, but I know it when I see it. Sometimes it feels as though a
filmmaker doesn't know how to make a set piece feel like a film; other
times the director seems to be doing little more than turning the film
over to the actors reciting their lines. A play turned into a film can
become AMADEUS, it's true. It can also become OLEANNA.</P>
<P>     SIMPATICO doesn't fail because director Matthew Warchus can't give
Sam Shepard's play a distinctly cinematic life (he does) or that he lets
the actors run roughshod over the production (he does that too, but it's
not the fatal flaw). In this case, the play itself is the thing. Jeff
Bridges stars as a successful horse breeder named Lyle Carter who is
preparing for his latest sale, a Triple Crown-winning stallion named
Simpatico. Unfortunately, Carter has a dark past that's about to come back
to haunt him in the form of old pal Vinnie Webb (Nick Nolte). Vinnie
claims to be in legal trouble in California, trouble that could also make
things uncomfortable for Carter. As the lives of the two men intertwine
again, we learn in flashback of a scheme that gained the young Carter
(Liam Waite), Vinnie (Shawn Hatosy) and Vinnie's girlfriend Rosie
(Kimberly Williams) a huge bankroll. It was also a scheme with plenty of
repercussions into the present, including changing the life of a one-time
racing commissioner named Simms (Albert Finney).</P>
<P>     Structurally, SIMPATICO is about as sound a script as they come. 
Revelations about the characters' pasts appear ever-so-gradually, each one
adding a shade of significance to events that have gone before. As a tale
of guilt and coming to terms with one's mistakes, it's intriguing enough
consistently enough that you'll want to keep paying attention. It even
offers some genuinely cinematic pleasures, from John Toll's eclectic
cinematography to Stewart Copeland's jangly soundtrack. Far from the
too-typical 1990s script of 1-2-3 plot development, SIMPATICO's story
clicks along with unique rhythms.</P>
<P>     Those rhythms just happen to be the rhythms of a play. No matter what
is happening on screen in SIMPATICO, it never for a moment feels like the
story belongs on film. The characters speak to each other in the clipped
tones of a dialogue-dependent medium, full of loaded pauses and oblique
references that should come with big glowing asterisks noting "Pay
attention, this will be important later." Sub-plots and character
developments are so fraught with significance -- Carter and Vinnie
slipping casually into one another's lives; a horse that's not what he
appears to be -- you can see the author nodding to himself at the
cleverness of it all. Even the actors generally look like they're playing
to the rafters, with Nick Nolte all a-growl as the seedy Vinnie and Albert
Finney telegraphing his character's unambiguous ambiguity (only Catherine
Keener, as a vaguely simple-minded woman unwitting involved in the story,
shows a welcome subtlety). By the time Sharon Stone blows into the film
from some community theater Tennessee Williams production to play Carter's
wife, it seems almost impossible that all this is transpiring on a movie
screen instead of live and in person.</P>
<P>     It should go without saying that striving for thematic depth and
complexity is not exclusive to the live theater, nor is a labyrinthine
plot unworkable on screen. There's simply a quality to SIMPATICO that
makes it feel grossly artificial as a film experience. It's easy to watch
the film and understand what would make this story a slick, atmospheric
character study as a play. As a film, however, it's inert, moving along so
deliberately you may begin to feel that you're watching a staged reading
committed to film. I don't know if someone could take Shepard's play and
make it a workable film, but I know this one isn't it. SIMPATICO may make
you want to go out and see it as a stage production ... unless, by the
conclusion, you feel that you already have.</P>
