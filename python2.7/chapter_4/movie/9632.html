<P>"Spawn" may be somewhat of an older film. In fact it will probably be on
video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it (that is,
IF they see it). But i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of
theaters and into the world of rentals and, God forbid, video cassette
purchasing.</P>
<P>It wasn't the worst film of year by any means. It isn't even on the top 5 of
the worst films of the year. But it did manage to top the bottom five of the
bottom ten, which, in simpler terms, means it comes in at number 6 on my
"Worst of 1997" list. The only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to
the special effects, which might actually have been some of the best of the
year.</P>
<P>Performances, however, were either wooden or, for the most part,
unforgivingly campy. In fact, this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid
campiness! Even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality. I don't know how
to explain that one; it wasn't exactly choppy, but something about it seemed
. . . well, annoyingly unprofessional. John Leguizamo almost makes it as
Clown, but not quite. He is the only character who provides the audience with
any laughs that can honestly be called intentional.</P>
<P>But the main problem i found with "Spawn", as with most films that wind up on
my "worst of" lists, is that it was just plain boring. I wouldn't even say
there was a climax to the film. Sure, it had the big battle scene at the end,
but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a
conclusion. Never too soon, the movie did conclude in a very simple,
disappointing way. Even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this
year, it's one that I would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting
thru again.</P>
<P>Like I said, the special effects are the only reason that this film should
have any sense of pride, no matter how small. I was impressed with the
opening sequence, so long as I didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and
lobotomizing editing to get to me. And Batman has nothing on the spectacular
visuals Spawn's outfit created. But even the effects got tiresome during the
final scenes, which looked quite a bit like a modern video game. Who knows if
"Spawn: The Video Game" wasn't part of the plan from the beginning?</P>
<P>Keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat
more approachable, and in a very small amount, makes up for the cheeziness of
it all. But none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something I'd
recommend seeing, no matter what the price of admission. This movie is
definitely not for young children, which shouldn't really be a problem seeing
as how only teenagers, if anyone, would likely find it appealing. If you
really want to catch a movie, there are many better ones out there, no matter
what your tastes might be! Trust me! "Spawn" has very little to offer even
the most avid moviegoers!</P>
