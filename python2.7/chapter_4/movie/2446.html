                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Geena Davis, James Gandolfini, Aida Turturro, Stephen
Rea, Philip Bosco.
Screenplay:  Todd Graff.
Director:  Martha Coolidge.</PRE>
<P>     There is a sub-genre of film drama, only recently identified,
which has come to be known as the "chick movie."  The term has at times
been used to define any film which women tend to like more than men
(SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE comes to mind), but in its strictest sense I
define a "chick film" as one which deals with relationships men could
only attempt to comprehend:  mother-daughter, female friendships, and
birth mother-child.  ANGIE definitely falls within this framework.
It's got mothers, daughters, friends, childbirth and a dose of
heartbreak to guarantee maximum lacrimal viscosity, and all these
things may affect the target audience.  I found myself impressed by
Geena Davis' performance, but bothered by the obvious and excessive
manipulation which never really pays off, and by some unfortunate mixed
messages.</P>
<P>     Davis plays the title character, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn resident
Angie Scacciapensieri.  Approaching thirty, Angie has spent her whole
life in the same neighborhood with the same best friend, Tina (Aida
Turturro), and the same boyfriend, Vinnie (James Gandolfini).  Then one
day, something does change in Angie's life: she's pregnant.  As
everyone assumes she and Vinnie will be getting married, Angie begins
to think about all the experiences she's been missing.  She begins a
relationship with flighty attorney Noel (Stephen Rea), and tries to
expand her horizons.  But as the baby arrives, Angie realizes that
ultimately she must confront the memory of the mother who deserted her
at the age of three to get her life straight.</P>
<P>     Geena Davis' performance as Angie is easily the best thing about
ANGIE, which is fine because it's also the most important thing.  Most
of Davis' roles to date have emphasized her comic talents, but ANGIE
confirms what THELMA & LOUISE suggested:  that Davis is a very gifted
all around actor.  She gets to work with the whole range of emotions,
big and small, bright and dark, and she handles all of them with grace
and sparkle.  Stephen Rea is also extremely slick and charming as Noel,
and the scenes between Davis and Rea provide many of ANGIE's
highlights.  Through its first hour, ANGIE is an interesting and
appealing character drama with real promise.</P>
<P>     The second half of Todd Graff's script suffers from two major
problems.  The first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high
points.  There were at least four separate points at which I thought
that ANGIE had reached its climax, and what made that decision the most
frustrating is that none of them quite provided the catharsis that
ANGIE needed but always just missed.  I got the feeling that Hollywood
Pictures had tested several endings, found that the audiences responded
to each one, and then decided to keep them all.  Consequently, ANGIE
loses its narrative momentum two thirds of the way through and coasts
to the finish on its tear-jerking.</P>
<P>     The second, and perhaps more distracting, problem is a rather
personal distaste for what I perceived as a sell-out in the change in
Angie's perspective which occurs at the end of the film.  ANGIE begins
as a story about a woman who feels trapped by her life trying to change
it for the better through new experiences.  When some of these new
experiences don't turn out well, and Angie's life takes some
disappointing turns, she seems to take all the wrong lessons away from
those experiences.  A speech Angie makes to her baby surprised me by
suggesting that Angie believed her problem was thinking too much about
herself, when I felt she was thinking about herself for the first time
in her life.  The fits and starts in the film's many climaxes left me
wondering what it was that I was supposed to have learned from Angie's
story.</P>
<P>     It is a given that a film like ANGIE pulls emotional strings, and
that in itself is not a failing.  Manipulating our emotions is what
films are supposed to do; the best ones just manage to do it so
skillfully that we don't notice or don't care.  ANGIE doesn't achieve
that deft middle ground.  It crosses its signals, piles on the pathos,
and leaves its star to carry most of its emotional baggage.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 emotional climaxes:  5.</PRE>
