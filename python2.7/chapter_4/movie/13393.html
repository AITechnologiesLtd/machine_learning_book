Running 125 minutes </P>
<P>Since it's opening on Friday, Terry Gilliam's new film Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas has, to say the very least, not been received too well by most
film critics. I knew this before I entered the theater yesterday, so I
wasn't expecting to see the masterpiece I had anticipated ever since I saw
the first previews for the movie. However, I still had to see the flick
anyway, no matter how disappointed I might have become (I'm a die-hard
Gilliam fan). For the following two hours, I sat in my seat and scrutinized
every frame of the movie, waiting for just one single scene to slip up or
go wrong. By the time I left the theater, I was completely convinced of one
thing; along with Joel Coen and Quentin Tarantino, Gilliam is one of the
most talented directors working in Hollywood today. </P>
<P>At first, I was a tad hesitant in writing this particular review because I
fully realize that I'm quite possibly the only critic on the face of this
planet that is going to praise this movie. But I'm just going to come out
and say it, just like I did last year when everyone was attacking U-Turn
and Lost Highway; I loved this movie. </P>
<P>Much like the other two films I mentioned, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
isn't so much about story or plot as it is about style and construction.
Hell, I defy anyone to give me an even semi-rational explanation of the
plot of Lynch's Lost Highway. But like I said, plot doesn't matter; that
was an exploration of the possibilities of cinema. Much like an abstract
painting, if you will, only put on film instead of a canvas. </P>
<P>How can this film be about plot when it's only existing trace of a
storyline involves a drug-addled journalist (Johnny Depp, with his head
shaved and sporting a cigarette holder) and his allegedly Samoan attorney
(Benicio Del Toro, gaining about sixty pounds since his Usual Suspects
days) getting stoned out of their minds and trashing hotel rooms virtually
beyond recognition? That is the plot in it's entirety. Along the way,
though, they do encounter a variety of characters (played mostly by
celebrities in quick cameos), including Gary Busey as a "lonely" (hehe)
highway patrol officer and Cameron Diaz as a woman who has Del Toro
convinced that she is in love with him merely because they made eye
contact. </P>
<P>I've been told that the novel from which this was based (written by Hunter
S. Thompson - one of the supposedly cool beatnik authors that I have yet to
be acquainted with) is so weird and bizarre that it would be almost
un-filmable using any conventional film concepts and techniques. I've also
been told by some that have seen this movie that it is pretty much a direct
translation of the novel, complete with alot of cool narration. So
shouldn't we be giving Gilliam at least some credit for filming a story
that was thought to be so odd that it could not be put on celluloid? Even
if you don't dig the movie, you at least have to admire that. </P>
<P>One one of the many strong points of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that I
forgot to mention earlier is the awesome as hell soundtrack that the film
features. If you want to hear what is probably the best movie soundtrack
since Reservoir Dogs, featuring such mind-altering tunes as "White Rabbit",
"One Toke Over the Line" and "Get Together", I strongly urge you to buy a
copy of the CD (I'm listening to it as I type, as a matter of fact). </P>
<P>I know it's going to sound odd for me to say this about what is basically
just a drug trip in movie form, but I seriously doubt that you will see
very many films come out this year that are as good as this one. It's that
well made. </P>
