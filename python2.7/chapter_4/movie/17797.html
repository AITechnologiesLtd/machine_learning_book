<P>Iranian cinema became known around the mid-1960s. In 1979,  the fall of the
Shah and the takeover by the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime made the country
into a theocracy with many restrictions and severe censorship.During the
Khomeini decade, cinema declined in numbers, quality and scope.</P>
<P>With the death of Khomeini and a (very relative) "liberalization," good
filmmaking picked up. Several  directors --these days the big name is Abbas
Kiarostami --became world figures, not in the entertainment-oriented,
subtitles-loathing USA, but in Europe and its festivals. Censorship
however, though somewhat relaxed, is still going strong in Iran.</P>
<P>Iranian movies have a special niche from the Shah's days on: films for
and/or about children. An Iranian researcher preparing a video documentary
interviewed several filmmakers on such movies. Other than the expected
reasons ("kids are our future" etc.) a major  stated or subsumed factor was
those films are "safer" and face reduced censorship. As I construe this,
many kidpics can also be an alibi for hinting at negative social and other
conditions.</P>
<P>Before  several autocratic regimes dissolved, the device of circumventing
the censors via indirection was thriving in many countries. In Franco's
Spain or Communist Poland and Czechoslovakia, seemingly non-political
subjects and characters used, in fact "invisible" allusions through
symbols, metaphors, humor or irony, to make their critical points. The work
of many filmmakers was enriched and refined by necessary subtleties. Many
movies of this kind were among the best of national productions.</P>
<P>Children of Heaven is about two kids, Ali, 9, and his younger sister Zahra,
and about a pair of sneakers, Zahra's only shoes. Their working-class
family is dirt poor --but honest, of course. It lacks most  basic
necessities and is hounded by their landlord for overdue rent. In their
home and on the streets, we get telling views of how the other half lives,
more probably the other nine-tenths.</P>
<P>Even the gift of a ballpoint pen takes on large dimensions. I couldn't help
wondering what one of the household's Persian rugs might fetch in the West,
and perhaps keep the group in comfort for  a long time</P>
<P>During one of his many errands, Ali has Zahra's pitiful sneakers repaired
by a cobbler.  Within minutes these get mistakenly picked up by a blind
trashman. Returning home, the terribly upset Ali  is greeted by Zahra's
enchanting smile--before, that is, he tells her the awful truth. Zahra will
smile just twice again in the course of the hour-and-a-half movie.</P>
<P>The siblings say nothing of the loss to their parents since the family is
too poor to afford new shoes. I also suppose that Iranian youngsters,
unlike those of most western countries, have a traditional respect of their
seniors--and respect often goes hand in hand with fear of being the bearer
of bad news.</P>
<P>In their predicament, the siblings decide to share Ali's own (and only)
pair of sneakers when the children go to their respective schools. Zahra's
school is in the morning, Ali's in the afternoon, so there's a kind of
relay race as she passes on the sneakers to her impatiently waiting
brother. Times don't dovetail precisely, so the boy gets to school just
minutes late, is caught three times by the strict but kind (as we later
see) principal. Why Ali doesn't give the man his perfectly good excuse
baffles me. Is Iran so tight-lipped before authority?</P>
<P>The schoolchildren are so nicely disciplined and well-mannered in their
shabby classrooms that it makes American schools look like high-tech
infernos. Yet my Western eyes were depressed by the identically garbed
female pupils in dark pants and blouses and huge white head scarves.</P>
<P>Complications and supense follow. Zahra sees her old shoes being worn by a
classmate. Father gets on his rickety old bicycle with Ali, to seek
gardening jobs for the rich. They cross a Tehran that's beyond their
depressed areas. It's a revelation, another world, a modern city with wide
road, tree-lined avenues, tall buildings, consumer advertising.</P>
<P>Reaching a beautiful residential neighborhood, they are in a fairyland of
clean, quiet, empty   streets totally walled palatial villas with gardens,
intercoms from the gate door to the house, and at times guard dogs .(Read:
splendid but dehumanized)</P>
<P>The points made by the contrasts are obvious. Disembodied refusals are
heard on the intercoms. The father, a terrible, tongue-tied salesman, is
rescued by Ali's making the proposals. Papa gets new respect for his son as
he is hired by a nice old grandfather who pays him handsomely. (Read:
wealthy people do have a heart). Ali plays with the grandson.(Read: kids
are kids, with no social distinctions. Read also: poor little rich boys are
bored and isolated, as in a number of Hollywood pictures).</P>
<P>Once the job is done, the pair leave in high spirits. You sense that
something bad is going to happen. It does, when the bike's brakes don't
work. It is not a serious accident but financially the poor people are back
to square one.</P>
<P>At the boys school, the gym teacher had announced an inter-school
competition of long distance running, four kilometers. The first prize is
two weeks in a holiday camp, a dream for have-not students. Ali,
preoccupied with his troubles and bad shoes did not sign up, but
discovering that third prize is a pair of sneakers, he begs tearfully to
enter the race. The teacher relents.</P>
<P>In an American film, the boy would have won not just third place but first.
I won't say any more. The hard race is well and suspensefully  filmed, the
movie's conclusion is very good, without a neat wrap-up --a big plus.</P>
<P>Acting is good, kids and adults are "real." Among the grownups are several
instances of kindness. The style of COH mixes the documentary and the
dramatic, is clearly (and by the director's admission) derived from Italian
neorealist films, notably De Sica's classic The Bicycle Thief (1948) and
certain other European movies on poverty.</P>
<P>In fact, a new Majidi movie ( all I know is that it is a
"comedy-documentary") made in Iran, produced by Kevin Costner and Jim
Wilson, was announced for February 1999. Its title : The Bicycle Thief. I
have no news of it. Perhaps its U.S. release was postponed because a
re-release of De Sica's The Bicycle Thief has been playing recently in a
few U.S. locations.</P>
<P>COH was a major hit in Iran and a 1999 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film.
It is  a good picture, although a number of tricks, plot devices, obvious
constructions, coincidences (note the blind man and the girl with Zahra's
shoes) and manipulations, all for a good cause no doubt, will be sensed by
the viewers. Try as he may, writer-director  Majidi cannot even approximate
the starkness of De Sica's tone. The Italian film was in black and white
and in wet wintry weather, while the colors and sunshine of COH act as a
small palliative to the characters' travails.</P>
<P>The category "Children's Films" may give the false impression that this is
a Disneyfied movie. No, it is for adults, and for young ones who are able
to read the subtitles on the screen.</P>
