<P>     With I CAN'T SLEEP, French director Claire Denis (CHOCOLAT, NO FEAR 
NO DIE) takes a story from newspaper headlines and creates characters 
around it.  This is a study of three people whose lives crisscross and 
intersect.  There is no beginning and no ending--only the middle 
portion upon which Denis has chosen to "eavesdrop."  The central event, 
which comprises the climax of I CAN'T SLEEP, changes the lives of all 
those involved, but it's impossible to say what will come next, after 
the end credits have rolled. </P>
<P>     The basis for this film was the rampage and capture of the real-
life "Granny Killer", a serial killer who terrorized Paris during the 
late 1980s by stalking and murdering elderly women.  I CAN'T SLEEP uses 
this atmosphere of fear and uncertainty as the background against which 
to tell three stories:  those of Daiga, an exceptionally-attractive 
Lithuanian visitor to France; Theo, a musician struggling to keep 
custody of his young son; and Camille, a gay erotic dancer and Theo's 
brother.  One of these three is the Granny Killer, but we don't learn 
which until about halfway through the movie. </P>
<P>     Intellectually, I CAN'T SLEEP can be fascinating.  It's essentially 
a postmodern, existential character study and, as such, it offers a lot 
to people-watchers.  But Denis' style has isolated the characters from 
us, keeping them at arm's length.  While viewing this film, the audience 
member is an indifferent observer.  Involvement on an emotional level is 
almost impossible.  This makes sitting through I CAN'T SLEEP something 
of a frustrating, not to mention sterile, experience.  We want to 
identify with the protagonists or, failing that, at least understand 
motivations that too-often are left murky. </P>
<P>     In some sense, this film has an incomplete feeling.  The characters 
are not the sort to haunt the viewer after the theater lights come on, 
but the mood may linger.  In fact, the wonderfully melancholy atmosphere 
is often more tangible than the personalities of the people Denis has 
chosen to focus on.  In the final analysis, I CAN'T SLEEP is 
interesting, but not involving; beautiful, but detached; and unhurried 
to the point of somnolence.   </P>
