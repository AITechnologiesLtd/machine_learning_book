<PRE>DREAM LOVER (1994)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Nicholas Kazan
Starring: James Spader, Madchen Amick, Fredric Lehne, Larry Miller, Bess
Armstrong, Kathleen York, Michael Milhoan, Clyde Kusatu, Erik Avari</P>
<P>"Dream Lover" is that kind of bizarre, non-conformist erotic thriller. 
The trailers hint at just a film filled with sex, and a bit of Hitchcock
tossed in for good measure.  But "Dream Lover" is far more complex than
that, and is surprisingly enough a good film, even if its previews come
off as stupid and randy (which isn't always a bad thing).</P>
<P>"Dream Lover" deals with Ray (James Spader), who has just divorced his
wife (Kathleen York), and has re-entered the wonderful world of dating. 
After going to his rich friend's (Larry Miller) party, he spills wine on
an attractive woman (Madchen Amick, who was on "Twin Peaks"), who freaks
out and humiliates him.  A week later, they run into eachother at the
supermarket, laugh over the accident, and soon go out to dinner
together.  The next day, Ray can't find her, but eventually tracks her,
and they begin having some wild sex.  After what has to be a huge
elipsis, they're married, and soon have a kid.  Everything's great for
Ray.</P>
<P>But gradually, things begin unraveling.  Ray finds out that her real
name, and that she has parents who he has never even heard of.  She
seems to have this whole other past which she claims to have left behind
when she moved to the city, but curiosity gets to Ray.  And as he
unpieces parts of her hidden life, his mental state gets worse and
worse.  Soon he's obsessed with finding where she is on Wednesday
afternoons when she disappears, and mysteriously has a matchbook from a
hotel in her purse.</P>
<P>The ending, I think, is cool, but does wrap things up way too nicely. 
But it's a great time watching Ray's sanity unravel, and the writing and
directing lets things unravel nicely and gradually.  The plot twists are
plotted nicely, allowing the film to move smoothly.  And the writing
lets us guess a lot over the mysterious Madchen Amick character.  And
while this may be found in the "suspense" section, there is no violence,
action sequences, or big scenes of stabbing/shooting/whatever else; just
good character assasination.</P>
<P>Also, the whole sex bit does not overcome the storyline, like it did for
"Basic Instinct."  I personally saw the "rated" version, but there's
apparently an unrated "sexier" version, but I'm sure it's not TOO
overbearing.  Although even in the "rated" version, you get to see the
lovely Madchen Amick in all her glory and splendor.</P>
<P>There's a bit of surrealism with the direction too.  The film is
intercut with fantasies Ray has at being at a bizarre carnival where the
cheif clown mocks Ray and his luck with women.  And there's even a fat
woman on a stage presenting Ray's dream lover of the title, whomever it
may actually be.  It's an interesting little thing to do, especially for
a film promoted as an "erotic thriller."</P>
<P>The acting is also very good.  James Spader, who's actually a cool actor
(even if he sometimes mumbles), plays Ray wonderfully, making him
interesting and likable.  Madchen Amick as the mysterious wife/dream
lover gives us a totally interesting character, making her sexy,
seductive, and even likable in that sick kind of way.  It's cool to see
a femme fatale in an erotic thriller who can actually act.  And Larry
Miller is, as usual, pretty funny, although him playing a playboy is
more questionable casting than interesting.</P>
<P>"Dream Lover" was a shock for me in how intelligent it was.  Sure, there
was some big taudry sex, and we had to see James Spader's butt and all,
but the plotting is wonderful, and the film becomes a good old
Hitchcockian mind twister, in the good sense.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
