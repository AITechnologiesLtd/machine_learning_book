<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I never really read comic books when I was a kid.  I liked the
Transformers comics, and a few years ago I tried with futility to
collect some of the numerous Aliens series.  Other than that, my
experience is limited to glancing about the comic store once or twice a
year.  Some of the art pleased my inexperienced eyes, and from time to
time, I actually found the stories interesting.  The plots were never
coherent -- no, they jumped from scene to scene worse than a badly
edited Warner Bros. movie.  My overall impression had me dismissing
comic books as pornography for adolescents -- the only acceptable way to
indulge in violence and sex without the need of a fake ID.</P>
<P>In the last few years, we've had a deluge of films based on comic
books.  Blade is the newest one, and while it is easily one of the
best-looking films of 1998, it features common problems of the genre. 
It's certainly more satisfying than the dull experience of Spawn, and
infinitely more enjoyable than the laughable Batman & Robin.  The
presence of Wesley Snipes also elevates the film's odd charm.  But there
just isn't any depth -- there are many scenes of attempted depth, but
they're mostly just endless shots of a brooding Blade, staring with
numbing sincerity into darkness.  A couple of lines of convincing
dialogue would have helped out immensely.</P>
<P>Still, it deals with vampires, and is proficient in its us of
exploitative violence and gore.  Snipes plays the deeply disturbed
Blade, a human-looking monster, known in the vampire culture (it is
widely accepted now that vampires do, in fact, exist) as the Day Walker
because -- you guessed it -- he can walk during the day.  In fact, he's
an all-around great guy:  he has all of the vampire's strength, and none
of their weaknesses, aside from The Thirst (he looks so pleased,
immersed in wonderment, as he injects that human blood into his jugular
vein . . .).  Blade, however, hates vampires, because they killed his
mother and made him what he is today.</P>
<P>And that, my friends, is a bad-ass mo' fo!  A butt-kicking,
vampire-slaying, sword-wielding maniac!  Yes, Blade is very good with
his weapons and appendages, and seems rather adept at killing vampires
quickly and with as many guns as possible.  The story comes in when he
meets Deacon Frost (a pallid and unshaven Stephen Dorff), a youngish
vampire who wants to revive the Blood God and take over the human race. 
It's strange how the words "Blood God" don't sound particularly funny in
the film, but strike me as loudly amusing in text-form.  Anyway, it's up
to our main man Blade to stop this incessant vampire madness.</P>
<P>Well, it's the end of the summer, and my tolerance for big-budget
action has reached its yearly low (especially after last week's
un-Avenged tragedy).  It's a marvel that I enjoyed Blade as much as I
did, for it really is the essence of mindless big-budget action:  it's
well-choreographed, sharply directed (by Stephen Norrington), and
quickly edited.  It's also like the upper-echelon of action movies in
it's mock-depth approach, in which case it's clear that the screenwriter
(David S. Goyer, in this case) wanted to inject depth but was only
partially successful.  The result is gory action intertwined with
silent, motionless scenes of brooding.  If only we knew what Blade was
thinking.</P>
<P>But I did enjoy myself, even while admitting that I was indulging in
pornography.  The action is top-notch -- Blade finds many new and
interesting ways to dispatch of his foes.  There are also some funny
running jokes, one of which includes a vampire (Donal Logue) who keeps
getting his hands cut off.  The blood scenes are eclectic and exciting,
particularly the opening scene in a vile vampire nightclub.  Blade also
has a lot more personality than most of the action films to come out
this year, thanks to the always-appealing Snipes and his co-star, the
sometimes-appealing Dorff.  For the record, I also liked N'Bushe Wright
in the token female role, and Kris Kristofferson in the token sidekick
role.</P>
<P>And I suppose that, like all films, this one has to pander to a certain
audience.  Norrington is a skilled choreographer, and a visual stylist,
but he doesn't know much about characters.  I like that depth was
attempted, but it's an unsuccessful attempt:  it takes more than long
shots of nothing to convey a thought or an emotion.  And while the
beginnings of interesting themes are certainly present, none are
developed, and all are abandoned in favor of wholesale slice-and-dice. 
Don't get me wrong -- Blade is a good time at the movies, and easily the
best comic-turned-film I've witnessed.  It's a step in the right
direction, but someone needs to learn that action and depth can both be
important in the one movie.</P>
