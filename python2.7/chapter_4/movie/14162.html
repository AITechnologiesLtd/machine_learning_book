<PRE>SNAKE EYES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Brian DePalma once again revisits his favorite genre:  the Hitchcockian
thriller. Borrowing a trick from Rope, he films the opening twenty
minutes as one (nearly) seamless scene.  However, soon after this
bravura opening, the film loses all cohesion and begins to fall apart.</P>
<P>Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is a cop who's just as happy to shake down
small time criminals as he is to pursue justice.  He's right at home
among the petty thieves and gambling addicts in his hometown of Atlantic
City.</P>
<P>Snake Eyes takes place during one night, when Hurricane Jezebel is about
to hit the city just as the heavyweight boxing championship is on the
line.  Thanks to Rick's pal Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), he has scored
ringside seats.  You see, Kevin is arranging security for the Secretary
of Defense, who is attending the match.</P>
<P>However, when there's an assassination attempt on the secretary's life,
it is up to Rick to unravel the conspiracy.  Suddenly, all 40,000
members of the crowd become potential witnesses, or potential
conspirators. This becomes Rick's one true shot at greatness...but is he
willing to gamble it all?</P>
<P>He may be a crooked cop, but it's hard not to like Rick Santoro. Nicolas
Cage goes the extra mile when infusing Rick with energy and pizzazz.  He
does everything possible to keep the film from bogging down, but in the
end, he just can't help it.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is colorful, but pale next to Cage.  Gary Sinise
plays his role a bit too obviously.  Carla Gugino isn't terribly
tempting as a mysterious woman who is wrapped up in the proceedings.
The minor actors actually fare better, with intriguing turns from Stan
Shaw, Luis Guzman and Kevin Dunn.</P>
<P>The opening "shot" of the film is spectacular.  There are a few
computer-blurred transitions, but otherwise it is one continuous scene.
It lends an immediacy to the proceedings that a traditional shooting
technique might have missed. There's lots of background detail...some
important (which is flashed back upon later in the film), and some red
herrings.  It's a great start for a thriller.</P>
<P>But then everything falls apart.  After such a strong buildup, the
critical piece of evidence ends up being an incredible series of
coincidences. Then, the film's finale is an editing nightmare, filled
with other bizarre coincidences and non sequiturs.  It's a very crude
way to end a film that began with such good portents.</P>
<P>It's a shame, and seems all the worse in retrospect.  It's like being
one card short of a royal flush.  Snake Eyes has the strong central
performance, and some good direction...but in the end, a weak script
brings it all tumbling down.</P>
