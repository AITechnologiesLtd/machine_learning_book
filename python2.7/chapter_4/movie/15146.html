<P>   The only certain things in life are death and taxes. From
the way that politicians campaign and from the number of
pages the media devote to the issues, you'd think the latter
was the more interesting theme.  On the other hand, when
we consider how the film industry has treated the two givens
in life, you'd conclude the opposite.  Taxes are a tedious
subject for writers of fiction, but death--that's another story. 
In "Meet Joe Black," a fascinating but schmaltzy take if the
influence which death's personification has on one of its well-
heeled victims, the big surprise is not how thoughts of
impending extinction concentrate the mind.  That's obvious. 
The delicacy of this fascinating, leisurely-told, 174-minute
romantic-comedy-drama is the way that Death himself
changes from his experience with mere mortals.  Played by
the deliriously handsome Brad Pitt in the title role, Death is
both all-powerful and highly vulnerable; an angel brought to
his knees--and more--by the seductive puissance of a rich,
successful, professional woman who is herself immeasurably
changed by sharing some time with the Omnipotent.</P>
<P>   The plot is imaginative and intriguing. After putting in
millennia of work taking people to the Other Side, Death feels
the need for a vacation on the very planet whose denizens
share monumental fear of his might.  When a handsome,
naive and friendly individual (Brad Pitt) is run over and killed
on a city street, he immediately borrows his body and
clothing--but not his casual manner--to see what mortal life is
all about.  Insinuating himself into the daily existence of one
of the nation's richest businessmen, William Parrish (Anthony
Hopkins), he counsels the man to put his affairs in order
because as Parrish celebrates his sixty-fifty birthday, he is
going to die.  They cut a deal.  If Parrish were to act as his
tour guide, escorting Joe Black (the name taken by Brad Pitt
in the role of Death) around, Black would extend the man's
time on earth by days, even weeks. Asserting himself at
Parrish's board meetings, he attracts resentment and
fascination alike from the people he meets, all wondering who
this newcomer is and how he has gained the ear of a hitherto
headstrong corporate chairman.  While Black enjoys the
vacation of his life--digging the benefits of the earth's gifts
from peanut butter to the love of Parrish's beautiful daughter
Susan (Clair Forlani), we in the audience cannot help
meditating on the joys of our own existence, pleasures which
make us understandably fearful of losing them at the end of
our journey.</P>
<P>   While this is not a movie to die for, it is immeasurably
better than the year's last bid at leaping from life's quotidian
subjects to the transcendent, "What Dreams May Come." 
Unlike that artistic flop, the dialog here is not dumbed down
but frequently witty, romantic, satiric and tender.  We feel for
Parrish, who is now required to give it all up while at the peak
of his career, surrounded by his loving family and ensconced
in an estate that would be the envy of Thomas Vinterberg's
Helge in "Celebration."  At the same time we take heart in the
man's acceptance of his premature demise, a titan of industry
who, faced with the need to leave the world a better place,
reverses a major business decision and refuses to sell out his
communications empire to a conglomerate determined to
dismember it.  Forlani proves a felicitous choice as a doctor
about to settle for a marriage to a handsome but greedy man
whom she cares for but for whom she does not feel passion,
while Jeffrey Tambor is right as the acquisitive man who is
neither melodramatically nor obviously evil.  Needless to say
the giant of the profession, Anthony Hopkins, provides the
deepest development of character, a man who counsels his
daughter to feel passion but learns the lesson himself only at
the end of his life.</P>
<P>   The weak link is found in Martin Brest's direction of Brad
Pitt, Hollywood's best-looking young actor, who is capable of
a seductive performance to match his dashing appearance as
he proves in the opening scene.  As Death, however, he is
appropriately dignified at first but despite his warming up to
the joys of mortal being, he remains pasteboard stiff and
awkwardly repressed.  In one scene with a dying West Indian
woman who is in a great deal of pain and asks Death to take
her to the Other Side, Pitt becomes positively embarrassing
in the patronizing tone he takes to this poor old lady,
speaking to her in her own native patois.  If you can imagine
the epitome of golden-haired WASPishness talking in the
lyrical lilt of a Jamaican, you can understand why some in the
audience give in to inappropriate laughter.</P>
<P>   Life must be lived with fervor, is the implication throughout
this epic drama.  Live as though this week were you last on
earth. Do you really want to sell out your integrity for those
extra pieces of silver--to form a romantic bond with a person
who does not make your heart skip a single beat or your
knees buckle?<HR>  Human beings are fascinated by Heaven. What's it like up
there?  Are some lucky men allotted 70 virgins each for their
amusement, as another film, "The Siege," suggests?  What is
a bit surprising is that people working in that celestial orb are
quite curious about Earth as well.  In Wim Wenders'
1987 movie "Wings of Desire," angels move invisibly through
Berlin, watching the activities of us mortals, comparing notes. 
Wouldn't you know that one angel, a fellow named Damiel,
thinks people are so much more interesting that his own kind
that he decides to become human and promptly falls in love
with a trapeze artist?  In Mitchell Leisen's short 1934 movie
"Death Takes a Holiday" starring Fredric March as Prince
Sirki and Evelyn Venable as Grazia, Sirki opts for a holiday
on our planet to see what makes people tick and falls in love. 
"Meet Joe Black" is based loosely on that production.  The
tagline for that feature? "No one can die--while he makes
love."  For this one? "No one can die--while he loves!"</P>
