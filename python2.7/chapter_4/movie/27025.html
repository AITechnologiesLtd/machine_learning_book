<PRE>HUMAN RESOURCES     * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Director: Laurent Cantet
Writers: Laurent Cantet, Gilles Marchand
Cast: Jalil Lespert, Jean-Claude Vallod, Chantal Barre
Not Rated, 100 minutes</P>
<P>Some areas of the earth are just naturally bleak. These places where color 
seems nonexistent and life is pretty much the boring same are a favorite 
setting for movies, especially for the French. A place like this is the 
perfect environment for which to talk for an entire picture. This seems to be 
Laurent Cantet's idea for a perfect production. The location of "Human 
Resources" is most certainly less than cheerful, as is life for the people 
there. The provincial town has a few dejected joys, but activity mainly 
centers around a factory in town. The factory is one of many that some giant 
corporation has in towns like these, but something radical is about to 
happen. </P>
<P>Franck (Jalil Lespert) returns from studying business in Paris to this place 
of doom. His father (Jean-Claude Vallod) has been working at the local 
factory, that puts workers under very harsh conditions, for thirty years. 
Franck takes an internship there in the human resources department. Here he 
learns the darker side of the establishment, and how poorly upper management 
treats employees. When Franck puts together a survey asking for the opinions 
of lowly personnel, it's twisted by the boss into something negative for the 
slaves of mechanism oppression. So Franck and a union leader must stand up 
for the rights of the working townspeople, while Franck himself must work out 
some issues with his estranged father. </P>
<P>Using non-professionals, Cantet has created an intelligent work of 
simplicity. At times it seems better suited as a play, it's that much of an 
actor's piece. With the obvious lack of lighting and technicals, the film 
even teeters into Dogme 95 territory. The camera work is quick, plain, and 
clean, and the script's the obvious leader here. With excellent pace, it 
provides room for some comfortable improvisation, and has a clear goal. Most 
importantly, it knows when it's about to become boring. Kudos go to director 
Cantet and Gilles Marchand for this great screenplay.</P>
<P>When the camera first sees Franck's father working away at his station, the 
work seems OK. He puts a small nut onto a large piece of metal that gets 
welded on a revolving machine. It was only until I realized he had been 
performing this task for the last thirty years did any of the movie sink in. 
This measly operation, and small others, were all a large group of people had 
to do for their entire lives. They have no fun family get-togethers, and no 
wild drinking parties. The very existence of life rises and falls with the 
machine. Life in the offices is no better. Nearly every wall in the building 
is glass to eliminate privacy and increase productivity. Someone is always 
watching.</P>
<P>When right to work gets taken away, there is nothing to fill the void. 
Mistreatment and corruption squandered; the message of "Human Resources" is 
loud and clear. People are aimless and without purpose when they have no 
work, and when unions get bypassed, there is nowhere to turn. Continuing in a 
universal cycle, this happens all over the world. Only when that realization 
comes to pass does this wonderful, important, and depressing film blare all 
with an unflinching certainty. Not one moment seems fake or unreal. This is 
an actual family with real problems, and there are no actors. That is truly 
the mark of quality.</P>
