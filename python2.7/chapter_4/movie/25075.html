<PRE>"King Gimp" (1999) </PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Susan Hannah Hadary and William A.
Whiteford</PRE>
<P>"Most people think 'gimp' means someone with a lame
walk. But 'gimp' also means a 'fighting spirit.'" </P>
<P>And Dan Keplinger easily fits that role. His
determination, courage, and strength won filmmakers
Susan Hannah Hadary and William A. Whiteford Academy
Awards for Best Documentary Short and won the hearts
of millions of viewers according to the voluminous
message board on the official HBO site. King Gimp is
thirteen-years-condensed-to-forty-minutes in the life
of Keplinger, a passionate and intent student who has
suffered from cerebral palsy since birth. Formerly
unable to write his name on a piece of paper,
Keplinger miraculously builds the patience and skill
levels to paint (using a paint brush attached to a
helmet on his head) elaborate pictures that impress
initial skeptics. Developing adversity and friendships
along the way, Keplinger fights to become a
professional artist. </P>
<P>A feel-good film minus Robin Williams and a
thunderously cliched score, King Gimp boldly uses
Keplinger as narrator. Mainly from him typing on a
keyboard, his words surpass your everyday monotonous
voice-over. Sporadically discussing love, life, and
the pursuit of happiness, this documentary depends on
its visuals to consume its audience - and each frame
is as hypnotizing as the next. Every time Keplinger's
motivated eyes look into the camera, the word 'king'
immediately comes to mind. </P>
<P>As a supplement to the film, visit
www.hbo.com/kinggimp for a better understanding of
cerebral palsy, how amazing his artwork his, how
insightful his words are, and how inspirational his
story is. </P>
