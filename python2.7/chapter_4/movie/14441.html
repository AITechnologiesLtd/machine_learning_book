<PRE>JACOB'S LADDER (1990)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Adrian Lyne
Writer: Bruce Joel Rubin
Starring: Tim Robbins, Elizabeth Peña, Danny Aiello, Matt Craven, Jason
Alexander, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Patricia Kalember, Macaulay Culkin, Eriq La
Salle, Ving Rhames</P>
<P>Adrian Lyne's "Jacob's Ladder" came out almost a decade ago and I doubt
anyone has figured it out yet.  It's a giant enigma of a film.  Everything
in it contradicts something else.  The plot structure is at once
manipulative and dizzying, and the entire film is like a horror film for
the Vietnam Vet crowd.  It's a combination of bizarre images from hell and
a sad, murky drama about a man who has lost all capacity for telling what
is reality and what isn't.  And dammit if it isn't totally engrossing from
start to finish.</P>
<P>Yes, "Jacob's Ladder" is extremely manipulative, but it's one of those
films that's manipulative for a very good reason.  Many films are
manipulative just so they can pull one over on the audience (ahem, "The
Usual Suspects"), and those are fine and dandy, but "Jacob's Ladder" is one
that does it not so for the sole sake of being clever and challenging, but
so that it can correctly take us inside the head of its protagonist, a
Vietnam Vet who's real life and halucinations from the War are on the verge
on destroying him psychologically.</P>
<P>The film follows three different time lines: the actual events of his
experience one night in Vietnam, when his platoon was attacked, it seems,
and members began to react to something that is unexplainable; his life
years after the war when he begins to experience psychological problems;
and his various hallucinations.  The protagonist, Jacob Singer, is played
by Tim Robbins, in his first major dramatic leading role, as a sad man
who's life probably would have taken a different route if he had never went
to Vietnam.  He was an English professor, but following the war, lost his
son (a young Macaulay Culkin), then his family, left his profession, and
began working at the post office.</P>
<P>When we meet him in what appears to be the main timeline (which appears, I
think, to be sometime in the mid-to-late 70s), he's washed-up, living in a
danky apartment with a woman he works with named Jezzie (Elizabeth Peña)
who seems to love him but may be just tired enough of his psychological
problems.  When the story begins, we see his daily paranoia: he fears he's
being chased by some faceless enemies, once in the subway station, and
another time on the streets in broad daylight.</P>
<P>Then his life really gets out of hand: his doctor and a member of his
platoon (Pruitt Taylor Vince) are blown up in their cars, and following the
latter's funeral, the members get together and discover they all experience
the same delusions.  They wonder if something happened to them in Vietnam,
and they all hire a lawyer (Jason Alexander, in a great piece of dramatic
acting which easily seals his post-"Seinfeld" career as being sunny)...but
everyone but Jacob backs out for some unknown reason.</P>
<P>It gets even weirder.  He gets a nasty fever one night following a party,
and is saved in a horrifically scary scene where he has to placed in a
bathtub with ice cubes so his temperature will come down.  He discovers
something about his Vietnam record that makes no sense, but may after all. 
And a new timeline is introduced that brings true emotional depth to the
film, something including his dead son, which is concluded in a scene
that's nearly as cathartic as the final scene in Andrei Tarkofsky's sci-fi
masterpiece, "Solaris."</P>
<P>This is all deftly handled by a script by "Ghost" scribe Bruce Joel Rubin
that is frightening, engimatic, and filled with sadness, all at the same
time.  His story really works because the lead character, Jacob, is a real
human being, and he's extremely likable.  We really feel something for his
character not only because he's naturally a real nice guy, but because
through everything, we're right there with him.  We understand very little,
and so does he.  We're as shocked by the bone-chilling hallucinations as he
is.  And when information that contradicts everything he has come to know
comes into light, we're as freaked out as he is.</P>
<P>If anything doesn't work in this film, it's the unearthing of a conspiracy
involving experimental chemicals during the war, something which is brought
to light during the final moments of the film, to give it more clarity and
realistic balance.  This does so, but the film didn't really need this
anyway.  This is a case where the story is so strong, and the filmmaking is
so amazing that something that was already publically well-known as this
didn't really need to surface to make it a "statement."  This is too good a
film to be reduced to such a thing, and it's a good thing that it is kept
as only an afterthought and not the true center of the film.</P>
<P>Adrian Lyne, whose films master in sexual perversity and obsession ("Fatal
Attraction," "Indecent Proposal," and the new version of "Lolita" are
blurbs on his oeuvre), marks that he's a powerful director with this film
who can deal with issues of paranoia and disturbing everday ignorance while
still telling a wonderful story.  His images are unnerrving and stupefying.
 So's his entire movie.</P>
<P>I'm still not sure what to make of this film.  Was it all a dream, or was
it all happening for real, or was there something else I'm not thinking of?
 It's decision to not come to a neat and clarifying close that explains
everything, no matter what the facade was, is one of the film's true
masterstrokes.  It's one of those films you discuss on end, using small
clues in the film as the basis for far-out theories, like "12 Monkeys," the
film that spurned months and months of discussion of what it meant to
anyone who cared.</P>
<P>But if you want to see the real power of this film, you don't really need
to figure out what the meaning is.  "Jacob's Ladder" is one of those films
that is not powerful because it's challenging and tough to figure out, but
because it's psychologically emotionally stimulating.  Some thing were
better left unresolved.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
