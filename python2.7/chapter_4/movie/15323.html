<P>     Director Tony Scott presents what sometimes seems like a documentary
on electronic surveillance in ENEMY OF THE STATE.  His vehicle is the
story of Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), a Washington D.C. attorney who
unwittingly becomes embroiled in a conspiracy when a computer disk finds
its way into his shopping bags.  On the disk is evidence that a National
Security Agency boss named Reynolds (Jon Voight) engineered the murder of
a U.S. congressman (an uncredited Jason Robards) who would have killed
legislation making it easier for the NSA to spy on citizens.  Piece by
piece Dean's identity is destroyed and accusations are trumped up against
him, until the only chance he has left is a secretive former government
operative known only as Brill (Gene Hackman).</P>
<P>     It's a great button-pushing premise for a millenial-angst-heavy
information age, full of shadowy government operations and technological
voyeurism of every shape and form.  Early on, however, Scott starts to
fetishize all that technology.  Satellites sweep across the sky from
hundreds of miles above to pinpoint a fleeing target; microtransmitters
are planted in shoes, pens and cell phones; phone and bank records betray
every personal secret.  The first time a chase scene spills over with
surveillance details, it's effective and alarming.  The second time, you
start to notice that it drags scenes out much longer than they need to be.
The third, fourth and fifth times, you wonder why the omniscient gadgetry
is beginning to seem more cool than scary.  Is this a movie about people
oppressed by electronics, or a commercial for electronics?</P>
<P>     Fortunately, the human angle is in the capable hands of Will Smith.
In his first purely starring role -- no buddy cop, no aliens -- Smith
continues to show the charisma of a star.  He's a more effective hounded
Everyman than you might expect, cracking wise when it serves the moment 
while generally handling his predicament with intelligence and resolve.
Hackman arrives fairly late in the film to provide some requisite bonding
moments, but mostly the weight of ENEMY OF THE STATE falls squarely on
Smith's shoulders.  He proves more than capable of handling it.</P>
<P>     He also gets to work with an action/thriller script considerably more
coherent than average.  Dean's imperfect relationship with his wife
(Regina King) links deftly into the conspiracy plot, as does the
connection between Brill and go-between Rachel (Lisa Bonet).  The
resolution is a rushed disappointment -- mixing in a dopey mob sub-plot
just when the table-turning pleasures of Dean and Brill watching the
watchmen had been so promising -- but for nearly two hours it's pretty a
effective story.  With Scott keeping the pacing steady and intense, all
the script needs to do is avoid situations so obviously stupid that you
feel insulted.  Marconi's script may not be impressive, but it's
unobtrusive, which is one of the higher compliments you can pay an
action/thriller script in 1998.</P>
<P>     Still, there's the matter of all those gee-whiz shots of satellite
cams, computer extrapolations and general manipulation of technology.
Tony Scott has always been a director who never met a five-second piece of
film he liked, and in ENEMY OF THE STATE it often proves distracting as he
whips back and forth between Smith talking to someone and someone
_listening_ to Smith talking to someone, a couple dozen times in the space
of a minute.  Sure it's unsettling to consider that the only privacy you
may have is inside your head, but it's most unsettling if we connect with
a character connecting with that reality the hard way.  Will Smith
provides that humanity almost in spite of Scott's inventory of spy gear.
The director takes the edge off the edgy concept, turning in a solid
thriller that hypes us up when it should be freaking us out.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 state secrets:  6.</PRE>
