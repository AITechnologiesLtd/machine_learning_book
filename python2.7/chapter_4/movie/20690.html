<P>The Crow has a basic revenge-style premise that is enlivened by great
production designs and cinematography. Director Alex Proyas plunges us
into an ugly, grim society where criminals do as they please and the
police are all but helpless to put an end to the massacre. The Crow
paints a dark and moody picture, but it is also one of the more
effective examples of it's kind in recent years.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, the police are investigating a double-homicide of a
nice young couple who were about to get married. Eric Draven (Brandon
Lee) was pushed out the window, while his fiancee was brutally raped by
a band of thugs who had broken into their apartment. He died instantly,
while she passed away after a long struggle at the hospital.</P>
<P>Flash forward a year to the startling awakening of Eric from his muddy
grave. Led by a crow who will serve as his guide through the land of the
living, he goes on a vengeful spree of wiping out those who were
responsible for his untimely death. He wears makeup that would put the
members of Kiss to shame, and leaves the outline of a crow at every
crime scene, whether it be in blood or a carefully laid ring of gasoline
to set fire to. I can't really elaborate on the film's plot, because
there's really no more to tell - this is your basic revenge flick with a
handful of unique qualities, just a new spin put on a familiar tale.</P>
<P>Just the same, the film's basic premise proves to be oddly moving.
Proyas knows how to set up a scene so that it will be easily absorbed by
the audience, and he's a master craftsman when it comes to the
choreography of action sequences. There's one monster shoot-out in The
Crow that will knock your socks off, as martial artist Lee proves to be
more than sufficient in a demanding physical scene.</P>
<P>Draven's trail of bad guys leads him to an underworld gang led by a
vicious crackhead (Michael Wincott), and his bizarre mistress (Bai
Ling). With the help of a sympathetic cop (Ernie Hudson), who finds his
motive to be more important than withholding the law, Draven finishes
off the last of the punks who crossed him and his wife. There are
flashbacks involving the couple's close relationship and home life, but
in most cases they are too brief or miss the point entirely. The biggest
thing The Crow has to brag about is it's spectacular set and production
designs, which bring to life this perpetually bleak city and practically
give it a life of it's own. Like in Proyas sophomore outing, the equally
impressive but intellectually superior Dark City, the surroundings play
just as big a part as many of the characters do. Another similarity of
the two films is the use of lighting. In both, any bright light
whatsoever is almost non-existent, and that only aides in the
effectiveness of the overall tone.
It's no question that The Crow will be remembered for the sudden death
of star Brandon Lee, who was killed during a freak accident near the end
of filming. This casts somewhat of a dark shadow over the proceedings,
but considering this film is already so dark there's little notice of
it.</P>
<P>The Crow is an impressive piece of gothic art, with a highly stylized
visual appearance that adds to the enjoyment. But it's little more than
that. The main character has but one goal, and after all the trouble is
over with, the audience will have indulged in the ride he provided but
never quite got entirely involved.</P>
