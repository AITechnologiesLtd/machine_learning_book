<PRE>                                    TWENTY-ONE
                       A film review by Mark Santora
                        Copyright 1991 Mark Santora</PRE>
<P>     The film TWENTY-ONE is an excellent piece of filmmaking.  In all
respects, this film stands as one of the best films I have seen this
fall season as most of the film releases have been fallen short of many 
expectations.  But this film's simple storyline, a 21-year-old British
woman's look back at her love life, is charming, funny, and even a
little sad.</P>
<P>     The lead character is played by Patsy Kensit, who should be
remembered from LETHAL WEAPON 2.  She is quite excellent in the role of
Katie, a distraught, cynical woman who is already fed up with life at
21.  And this role will undoubtedly bring many scripts to her door.</P>
<P>     The film starts off in New York City.  Here Katie is living in her
very nice apartment, by herself, and converses directly with the
camera.  This creates a sense of intimacy with the character of Katie.
Katie is quite frank.  She says what is on her mind.  In the course of
the film she talks about sex, her parents, her friends, lovers, and
herself.</P>
<P>     Katie's love life includes an affair with a married man whom he
flirts with at his wedding.  This affair is completely a sex-oriented one.
Another affair is with a heroin addict.  This is an affair of love,
with no sex.  Hence her affair with the married man.  This is all
handled quite well without any "Hollywoodizing" of the sex scenes.  This
is an adult-themed film, and it is treated accordingly.</P>
<P>     TWENTY-ONE is an excellent film.  It stands alone in its field, for
lack of any other flims like it at present.  Patsy Kensit controls the
film with a high degree of screen magnetism.  The rest of the cast
supports her character accordingly and the entire cast plays off
each other very well.  This is an excellent film and is not one to be
missed.</P>
