<P>Cinematic storytelling often gravitates towards people in professions
that are inherently dramatic and stressful. That is why there are more
movies about police than about engineers. (Although in real life,
police work likely contains longer periods of tedious banality than
how it is portrayed on screen.) This film is about a profession that
is directly connected to disaster without being directly
involved--paramedics.</P>
<P>By definition, the job of a paramedic is frenetic and stressful. They
are always handling life and death situations in the aftermath of
disaster or tragedy. Any mistakes made can result in death, and
lingering guilt.</P>
<P>Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) is a veteran New York paramedic on the
verge of burnout. He is lacking an important quality required in his
profession-- detachment. Frank gets too involved with the people he
treats, and pays the price. The story begins with Frank coming to the
aid of an older man, Mr. Burke (Cullen O. Johnson), who suffered a
heart attack. Frank is able to revive him and take him to the
overburdened local hospital, but the man lingers in a suspended state
between life and death. The sympathetic Frank develops a relationship
with the man's daughter, Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), who
frequently visits him.</P>
<P>Like the drugs that infest the neighborhood, Frank's job is the source
of his highs and his misery. He wants to quit, but never manages to do
so. The lingering state of suspended animation in which Mr. Burke
hovers symbolically represents Frank's state of mind. Although Frank
is effective at his job, he has become too involved and feels that his
best option may be to euthanize his career.</P>
<P>Veteran director Martin Scorcese presents dazzling visual images of
the surreal netherworld of the afterhours in New York City. The high
speed views of the ambulance coursing through the congested streets of
the city are mesmerizing. However, in terms of structuring the story,
the film is not as successful. The subplot of Noel (Marc Anthony), a
confused and unstable young man, is muddled and almost superfluous.
The character of Frank is well developed and well acted, but outside
him and his colorful partners, the other characters are not
compelling.</P>
<P>Recommended. The film is well directed, but unfocused. It dwells upon
its basic themes, and reiterates its ideas.</P>
