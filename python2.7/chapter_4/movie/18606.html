<PRE>Review of THE THIN RED LINE</PRE>
<PRE>By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>It took director Terrence Malick twenty years to make a film, which is about a
decade longer than it would take Stanley Kubrick. Did he run out of ideas, or
was he sick of Hollywood? It is an inconsequential matter because Malick has
crafted one of the most poetic, life-affirming statements on war that has ever
been produced by a Hollywood studio. "The Thin Red Line" is a masterpiece - a
quiet, powerful observation of men in war, their lingering thoughts on what war
means to them, and how violent human behaviors affect nature. </P>
<P>The film's opening shot is not of bullets grazing and imploding on the beach
of Normandy, but of a crocodile entering a lake underwater. The next few shots
centers on Private Witt (James Caviezel) cavorting among the natives on an
island off the coast, but where are we? Why are we here? Isn't this a war film?
Later, an American patrol ship spots Witt and another soldier, and it is up to
First Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean Penn) to remind Witt what their God-like mission
is. Their mission, as Lieut. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) explains, is to ascend upon
a certain hill on the Guadalcanal island to infiltrate a Japanese bunker. This
is the conventional section of the film - the war itself to find the bunker,
and the risk of being shot down like flies by the Japs. With its sweeping
grandeur, artfully shot and edited battles, and incongruous points-of-view,
this long sequence caught me off guard, and is thus tinged with more emotion
and heartbreak than anything in "Saving Private Ryan." I think the reason it
works so well is that we are aware how unfair and unpredictable war is -
bullets and gunfire can come from anywhere. One soldier (played by Woody
Harrelson) accidentally pulls the pin on a grenade thus literally blowing
himself apart! </P>
<P>Malick also invests time on how his characters think of war in the context of
their lives, and their loved ones back home. One particular soldier, Private
Bell (Ben Chaplin), is always reminiscing of his days with his wife, whom we
see in short shrift during flashbacks. He wants to be with her, but knows that
he may meet her "in the dark waters." Nolte's ferocious lieutenant wonders why
he's fighting, then he realizes that war is what he's been working up to for
twenty years. His fierce attitude is upheld by his notion that war makes a man
virile - "My son is a baker salesman." When he speaks eloquently about his
tough career to Captain Gaff (John Cusack), he says to him: "You are my son." </P>
<P>Malick also makes vivid points about nature, and how the brutal inhumanity of
war affects it. This is where his artistry truly lies - his films, "Badlands"
and "Days of Heaven," are inherently about nature. This time, along with the
help of cinematographer John Toll, he shows us the raping of the earth by men
of war. Although nature is a process of violence, war rapes the blades of grass
and the soil by its incessant violence upon it, including explosions. This is a
theme that the mass audience will not care to understand - close-ups of
colorful parrots, bats, rattlesnakes, and crocodiles do not a war film make, do
they? Yet, these innocent animal species did not ask to be part of it, nor did
the natives who walk among the pastures or the soldiers who are killed
arbitrarily. That close symmetry between man and animal is repeatedly and
intelligently paralleled by Malick. </P>
<P>"The Thin Red Line" is not the type of film that is character-driven, but
rather character-oriented. In other words, this is a film about faces within
the confines of nature, and the chaos that surrounds them. The interior
monologues are told through voice-overs (originally voiced by Billy Bob
Thornton) of individual men and their perceptions of what war entails. </P>
<P>The actors who make the strongest impression are James Caveziel's divine
Private Witt (the dreamy, poignant hero of the film), Nick Nolte's memorably
furious Colonel, Elias Koteas's straight-arrow Captain Staros who refuses to
send his men to death, Sean Penn's amazingly watchable Sgt. Welsh, Ben
Chaplin's courageous Private Bell, and the stoic, eccentric quality of John
Savage's McCron. Other actors (John Travolta, George Clooney, John C. Reilly,
Adrien Brody) are left in the dust (there was extensive recutting), but
Malick's astute direction always rivets our attention. </P>
<P>Malick has crafted a beautiful film full of some potent, sublime images. I'll
never forget the shots of the tortured Japanese soldiers and their cries of
pain; Caveziel's beatific face and the moment he's confronted by the enemy; the
deployed cargoes crashing on the water; the sunlight peering through the trees.
Overall, "The Thin Red Line's" overt, lingering lyricism indicates that nature
should be restored and not ignored, in light of virile fighters on the terrain.
Rarely has such a war film made the point that our surroundings, and what we
make of them, is infinitely more important than the evil that men do. </P>
