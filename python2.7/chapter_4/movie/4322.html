<PRE>                                TOY STORY
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>Capsule:  You want computer animation, we got computer animation.
        We're not talking about some piddly stuff like the feather
        in FORREST GUMP or the effects in TRON, we're talking wall
        to wall computer effects.  Interested?  (+2 on the -4/+4)</P>
<P>     TOY STORY is the first film from the combined efforts of Disney
and a computer effects company named Praxis.  It is part of a three
picture deal, and it looks like we have something to look forward to.</P>
<P>     What we have is amazingly good computer animation, combined with
an adequate story, some memorable characters, and a lot of funny
dialog.  The basic plot is pretty straightforward; Andy gets a new toy,
which looks to beat out his former favorite.  A jealous tiff starts to
develop, but in the end everyone's friends.  Not a lot there,
admittedly, but the basis for an entertaining movie.</P>
<P>     The main characters are quite good, but the movie is almost stolen
by Mr.  Potato Head.  Hasbro should be very pleased, chances are there
will be a strong upswing in Mr. Potato Head's sales.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of humor in the film, and small touches that really
make the film work, at least for me.  One thing I noticed was that the
army men actually *look* like army men, including the little circles
stamped on their body's and the occasional translucent plastic ring
that's still attached.</P>
<P>     There is also a wonderful scene in which the mutilated toys of the
"evil" next door neighbor kid come to life in front of him and literally
scare the kid silly.  It's quite satisfying.</P>
<P>     That said, this is not completely a kids movie.  Some young
children might be a little scared of the mutilated toys, they evoke
memories of NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS with their twisted shapes.</P>
<PRE>     I have high hopes for the next films to come from this alliance.</PRE>
