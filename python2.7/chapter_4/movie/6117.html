<PRE>                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     There's a few legendary scripts among screenwriting circles --
scripts that people would *love* to rip off, if they could figure out
how:  WITNESS, CHINATOWN, NETWORK.  And then there's TOOTSIE, the queen
mother of comedy scripts, that gets ripped off all the time.</P>
<P>     THE ASSOCIATE is boilerplate TOOTSIE, lifting the entire plot
structure from Dorothy's television world and dropping it on Wall
Street, where Whoopi Goldberg finds herself forced to impersonate a man
(named Cutty after Cutty Sark scotch) in order to be taken seriously.</P>
<P>     If you want to know all about it, just rent TOOTSIE, and you'll
meet the principals of THE ASSOCIATE -- the confident (Dianne Wiest),
the would-be-if-I-weren't-the-same-sex lover (Bebe Neuwirth), the rival
(Tim Daly), and the wacky gang who fall for the trick.  And you'll see
familiar scenes -- Cutty is almost exposed, Cutty evades woman on the
prowl, Cutty's big finish.</P>
<P>     Whatever.  If THE ASSOCIATE were a *lot* funnier this might be
forgivable, accent on might.  As it is, THE ASSOCIATE is a relatively
juvenile hit-and-miss affair that makes sexism look like it's just wacky
hijinks.  And more demerits for using stupid, not-remotely-realistic
technology as a plot device.</P>
<P>     Thank God the cast is good, with the exception of a miscast Daly
(as a cutthroat Wall Street guy?).  Dianne Wiest is awfully appealing in
a Mrs. Claus sort-of way, and let me say right now that I see Bebe
Neuwirth (you know, Frasier Crane's stodgy ex-wife) in a *completely*
different light.  And Goldberg... is Goldberg.  If you like her, in
general, you'll probably like her here, too.</P>
<P>     Well, this is already more ink than this film deserves.  Three
stars on its merits; docked a half for blatant shamelessness.</P>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2</PRE>
