<PRE>THE OPPOSITE OF SEX
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>At first glance, The Opposite of Sex may seem to be merely a standard
dysfunctional-family comedy.  However, with a handful of excellent
performances and a very witty screenplay make this one rise above the
crowd.</P>
<P>DeDee Truitt (Christina Ricci) is the film's narrator, and isn't ashamed
of the fact that she's not a very nice person.  At the age of sixteen,
after her stepfather's death, she runs away from home to move in with
her half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan).  She's uninvited, but DeDee
always gets what she wants...one way or another.</P>
<P>Bill is a gay high school teacher, rich from the inheritance of a former
lover.  His current boyfriend is Matt Mateo (Ivan Sergei), a brainless
dolt whom DeDee immediately tries to seduce.  Within days, Bill's entire
life is reduced to shambles.</P>
<P>Among the people who get caught in DeDee's wake are Lucia (Lisa Kudrow),
the bitter sister of Bill's dead former lover, and Carl (Lyle Lovett),
the kindly local sheriff who always seems to be in the right place at
the right time.</P>
<P>But the black twisted heart of the story is DeDee.  Her sharp and witty
narration is worth the price of admission alone.  She knows she's in a
movie and tweaks filmmaking conventions in a way other
"self-referential" films (such as Scream) never dared.  Her choice
comments are biting and cruel, but hilarious.</P>
<P>Christina Ricci has finally found a role she can sink her teeth into.
She has finally risen out of her mediocre phase in films such as Casper
or That Darn Cat, and here shows the talent that was evident in the
Addams Family films.</P>
<P>She's backed up by a talented supporting cast.  Surprisingly, the
strongest secondary character her is the against-type Lisa Kudrow. Only
Martin Donovan falters a bit, but that is because his gay character is
the straight man in the film.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Don Roos makes his directorial debut with this film, which
also happens to feature his best script.  He takes a few chances with
his direction, and, for the most part, they are successful.</P>
<P>The Opposite of Sex is not a fall-down funny comedy, but it's full of
moments which will bring a wicked little smile to your face.</P>
