<PRE>                               BETTER LATE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "There may not be much of it left, but I want to spend the rest of
my life with you," practices 70'ish Hal, while kneeling in front of an
empty sofa.  "Will you marry me?"</P>
<P>     Rod Roeser, giving an empathetic and serious performance as Hal,
the would-be bridegroom.  Hal has never been married so his sister
drops by to give him his mother's wedding ring to ensure that he will
be completely ready.</P>
<P>     Filmmaker Jessica Yu debuted BETTER LATE, her latest short film,
at the 1997 Sundance Festival.  Although I think of her as a
documentarian since she has been associated with two Academy Award
winning documentaries, BETTER LATE is a fictional short story.  (Yu won
the 1996 Oscar for BREATHING LESSONS: THE LIFE AND WORK OF MARK O'BRIEN
and was the associate producer of the 1995 winner MAYA LIN: A STRONG
CLEAR VISION.)</P>
<P>     The beauty of BETTER LATE shines in the meticulousness of Hal's
preparation.  From getting matching forks for his candlelit dinner to
choosing just the right music and wardrobe, much thought is invested in
his every decision.  (Will he go for a youthful look with an Hawaiian
shirt or should he shoot for somber and serious with a mortician's blue
suit and a banker's suspenders?)</P>
<P>     The film wastes little time on dialog or even facial expressions,
rather it is in the details of the set decoration and body language
that the intricacies of the story unfold.</P>
<P>     Yu was at a screening where she showed this and two other of her
works.  The most surprising revelation about this film was that she had
40 people read for the part of Hal after the casting director had
already rejected 40 others.  Good shorts are much harder to develop
than they may seem.</P>
<P>     BETTER LATE runs about 10-15 minutes.  It is not rated, but would
be G.  The film will probably not interest those under ten, but would
be acceptable for any age.  I recommend this touching short to you and
give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
