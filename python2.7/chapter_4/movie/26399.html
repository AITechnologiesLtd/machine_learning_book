<PRE>A runaway train
The Yards</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Code of Silence" or "Honor Among Thieves" -- not that these are very
exciting alternate titles, but then "The Yards" isn't hard to beat. Equally
humdrum, the opening act (first third) of the film which slowly introduces
the characters in the play.</P>
<P>Leo (Wahlberg) has just been released from prison and embraces his ailing
mother. Willy (Joaquin), his buddy, is close with cousin (Charlize) who's
stepfather Frank (Caan) runs a big train parts company that employs Willy
and offers Leo a job as well. Willy and Frank keep the money coming in by
"playing ball" with local officials and politicians. Soon Leo is in over his
head.</P>
<P>A full act is too long to wait for a compelling moment. I must say, the film
finally did "reel" me in mid-way through and held me near to the end with
some very absorbing developments and a character or two to root for, but
then traded those attentions for a cheap bit of melodrama. Ultimately, I
left the theater saying "so what?" Additionally, the church organ soundtrack
is somewhat disorienting.</P>
<P>This is obviously a product of a lot of talented people. The acting is
strong (I love this cast!), the characters rich, the direction mighty, even
some nice cinematography ... but where is the heart? A drama for the sake of
drama? Perhaps one who appreciates a Shakespearean plot more than myself may
find this family/power opera a bit more quenching.</P>
