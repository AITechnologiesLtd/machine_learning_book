<PRE>                        RUTH ORKIN: FRAMES OF LIGHT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     RUTH ORKIN: FRAMES OF LIGHT is a short subject documentary by Mary
Engel and narrated by Julie Harris.  I saw the documentary at San
Jose's Cinequest film festival.  Ruth Orkin (1921-1985) was a famous
photographer whose specialty was black and white images of people.  Her
most well known photograph is entitled "The American Girl."</P>
<P>     Mary Engel approaches the documentary by concentrating on Orkin's
life rather than her pictures.  This could be considered either the
strength or the weakness of the film.</P>
<P>     Orkin was an interesting person.  She got her first camera at the
age of 10, and by 12 she considered herself a photographer.  She looked
at the pictures of the professional photographers of the time, and
decided that she must get herself a 35mm camera if she was to be
competitive.  Given her financial situation, she could not afford one
until she turned 24.</P>
<P>     As she grew up, she decided that what she really wanted to be was
a cinematographer, but the unions at the time would not let a woman
join.  Without her union credentials, no producer would dare hire her.
She resigned herself to making a living as a photographer.</P>
<P>     Later in life she was associated with the 1953 movie THE LITTLE
FUGITIVE.  This was one of the first films to be shot on location.  It
told the story of a 7-year-old boy who leaves Brooklyn and ends up on
Ellis Island.  She received an Academy Award nomination for the script.</P>
<P>     Ruth Orkin was an interesting woman and a pace setter, but this
documentary about her could have been better.  It presented the basic
facts of Orkin's life, but I left thirsting for more knowledge about
all the photos we saw in the documentary.  What was she trying to
capture?  What were her techniques?  I left with little more than a
collection of images and some random pieces of historical data.</P>
<P>     RUTH ORKIN: FRAMES OF LIGHT runs about 15-20 minutes.  It is not
rated, but would be a G.  It is a close call, but the documentary
skimmed the surface too much for me to be able to recommend it.  I give
it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
