<PRE>A film review by Rachel Deahl<HR></PRE>
<P> Sweeping shots of snowcapped mountains, displayed against a thumping
techno beat and cut in with introductory shots of various characters
(complete with their names appearing on screen) packing up to go
somewhere might give one the impression that Wintersleepers is about a
heist. The momentum builds like wildfire in these opening sequences as
the phrase 'Are you really leaving today' echoes throughout the various
departures happening across the board. This momentum quickly dies, as
does the hope for any bank robbing scenarios. What comes in its place is
a much slower film which lumbers along (painstakingly at times) to a
crisp, almost haunting close.</P>
<P> Tom Tykwer, the German director who exploded onto the international
scene with Run Lola Run brings this odd story of mistaken identity and
deathly fate to the screen with an awkward, but in some ways rewarding,
slant.</P>
<P> Set in a winter resort in Bavaria (the scenery is breathtaking), the
story follows the intertwining story of two roommates, their boyfriends
and the devastation wreaked by a fatal accident. Laura and Rebecca live
together in Rebecca's impressive winter bungalow, essentially sharing
the space with Laura's slovenly ski-instructor boyfriend, Marco. When
Marco's car is stolen by a drunken stranger (it has been left with the
keys in it), the result is a devastating crash which ensues on a nearby
road. When the drunken stranger hits a local farmer he flees the scene
of the crime, leaving the farmer devastated with his young daughter
thrown into a deep coma. The farmer is left with a vision of the
assailant-- a strange snake-like scar on the back of his head.</P>
<P> The farmer then goes on a relentless search to find the man with the
scar, angry that he is being blamed for the accident and his daughter's
devastating state. When Rebecca begins to date the hit and run drunk
driver in question, Renee, much is uncovered about what precisely
happened during the crash and why it occurred as it did. Twyker follows
the intertwined lives of these characters as their actions directly
affect one another, unbeknownst to them.</P>
<P> The film certainly meanders, winding down seemingly pointless. Much of
the film is spent exploring the antagonistic relationship of Laura and
Marco and one can't help but wonder why. However, Twyker manages to pull
these diverging storylines and characters together in the end for a
powerful finale. The more interesting aspects of the film, namely the
strange condition which plagues Renee, come together beautifully in the
end.</P>
<P> Although it's at time difficult and even unenjoyable to watch,
Wintersleepers finally ruminates on such large issues as death, fate and
human nature. In some ways it brings to mind Atom Egoyan's masterful and
devastating The Sweet Hereafter. And while Wintersleepers is unable to
achieve the precision and direction The Sweet Hereafter maintains
throughout, it does finally leave you with a similar despair.</P>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
