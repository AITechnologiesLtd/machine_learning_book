<P>_The_Impostors_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>The sophomore slump has hit actor-screenwriter-director Stanley Tucci with
this flat farcical follow-up to his auspicious 1996 filmmaking debut,
_Big_Night_ (which he co-helmed with Campbell Scott).  Tucci and Oliver
Platt play Arthur and Maurice, two starving actors in Depression-era New
York who unwittingly stow away onto a Paris-bound oceanliner after being
falsely accused of assault by a pompous Shakespearean hack-tor (Alfred
Molina).</P>
<P>In theory, _The_Impostors_ should come to life when Arthur and Maurice
find themselves on the cruise ship (which, of course, has their accuser as
one of the passengers).  However, that's where the film goes downhill.  The
film is at its best in the early going, during which the
acting-technique-obsessed Arthur and Maurice attempt to con their way to
free food; a wordless opening credits sequence harkens back to the best
silent comedy, and one hilarious scene in a bakery is, as it turns out, the
film's premature highlight.  The problem with the shipboard antics is that
only a handful of the eccentric array of passengers hold interest.  For
every inspired character and performance, such as Steve Buscemi's suicidal
cabaret singer and Campbell Scott's creepy German steward, there are duds
like a faux French con couple (Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney) and a
golddigging older woman (Dana Ivey).  The terrific timing and rapport
between Tucci and Platt keeps _The_Impostors_'s head above water, but just
barely.</P>
