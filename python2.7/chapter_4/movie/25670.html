<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A good old-fashioned mystery yarn, from John Dickson Carr, but this time
instead of the Lady Vanishes, it is the husband who does. Ruth Bowman
(Jeanne Crain) has just gotten married a few hours ago and her husband
John (Betz) has arranged for them to go on a honeymoon cruise aboard a
luxury liner across the Atlantic.</P>
<P>He carries the blissful bride across the threshold to their room and the
stewardess (Anderson) arranging the flowers, quickly excuses herself.
John then tells his wife that he has to go to the purser in order to
leave some money there for safe keeping and he will meet her in the
dining room. But that is the last she sees him as he vanishes, along
with their tickets and passport. Ruth is shaken up, and when she tries
to explain this to the ship personnel, they don't believe her. She can't
remember where she got married and has no proof of the marriage, and
when they check the cabin she was supposed to be quartered in, they find
that it is deserted and wasn't booked for the voyage. On top of that, no
one on board the ship has seen the beautiful woman with her husband.
Oddly enough, the one person who clearly saw her, the stewardess, denies
seeing her. When she asks about her luggage, the steward traces it to
her maiden name and a different cabin than the one she mentioned, with
no luggage or mention of her husband.</P>
<P>The ship's doctor, Paul Manning (Rennie), is called in to calm her down
and get the real story from her. He wants to believe her and acts very
kindly, but thinks she is hallucinating. She tells him that her father
died four months ago and she was very close to him, and had a nervous
breakdown after his death. Feeling depressed and lonely she met John and
he made her feel happy again, so they secretly got married after a short
romance.</P>
<P>She can't believe John is not on the boat and after the captain
(Bouchey) tells her he had the boat searched and there was no one on it,
she still believes John is on it. She then receives a mystery call from
John, as he tells her to trust no one, that both their lives are in
danger, and that he will get back to her as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Ruth is hysterical, as the ship's crew think she is imagining things,
though Paul sticks with her through thick and thin, though smelling
something suspicious. He finally asks her who would benefit from the
death of either her or her husband, and she tells him her father was a
wealthy industrialist and in his will left her the company.</P>
<P>The story itself, if examined closely had many improbabilities, but the
strength of the film is in the tension it creates within Crain and how
she handles it. She never quite figures out, until it is almost too
late, that her husband wants to kill her. She had a blind trust in him
and it is hard for me to imagine another person in her situation acting
as naively as she does. But even if I didn't find the plot to be always
plausible, the relationship that developed between her and Rennie was
credible.</P>
<P>This B&W melodrama was always suspenseful: there was the constant heavy
fog that made things mysterious. Crain seemed so helplessly alone,
highlighted by showing her sitting by herself at the dining table and
feeling that she is losing her mind, that set the mood for the entire
film and her vulnarability is what the viewer identifies with. This
excellently paced B-film, is tersely directed and superbly acted. The
film seemed to be thrust forward by the credibility of the characters
playing parts that were incredible.</P>
