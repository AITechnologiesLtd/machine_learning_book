<P>     The American Cowboy is a mythical figure whose every step through
nineteenth and twentieth century history has been magnified and
distorted.  Movies and television have formulated a readily
identifiable image of these men: rugged, macho loners who spend half
their lives on horseback, dress in typical "cowboy" garb, and speak
with a distinctive twang.  Judging by the portrait of rodeo legend
Bruce Ford as presented in Arthur Elgort's documentary, most of these
cliches are far more accurate than one might reasonably expect.</P>
<P>     Lovers of the rodeo will probably find a lot to enjoy about
COLORADO COWBOY.  Conversely, others' appreciation is likely to be
limited.  This film does little to initiate the non-aficionado into the
world of rodeos, and its depiction of Bruce Ford concentrates on the
bareback riding contests for which he is best known.  We learn tidbits
about the man behind the legend:  how he treats his family, the
importance of his father and his religion, and a few of his
aspirations.  Most of the movie, however, centers on those eight
seconds when the rider's attention focuses on staying in the saddle.</P>
<P>     "I'm a cowboy," says Ford.  "It was born in me and bred in me.
It's a life I love."  This statement encapsulates the movie's
uncomplicated theme.  Ford has to be committed to the rigors of his
life to endure a nomadic existence away from family and home as he
travels the rodeo circuit, accumulating points to make a run at his
fifth National Finals championship and sixth World Title.</P>
<P>     COLORADO COWBOY suffers by comparison to HOOP DREAMS.  It is
perhaps unfair to use the latter (possibly the best documentary of the
last decade) as the yardstick against which to measure the former (a
far less ambitious project).  Nevertheless, it is worth noting the
differences between the two in thematic richness and dramatic arc.
COLORADO COWBOY's lone goal is to offer a positive (hence, incomplete)
picture of one man (the film is part of an "American Heroes" series of
documentaries).  Discussion of wider social issues is beyond the film's
scope.</P>
<P>     Visually, despite a grainy black-and-white print, COLORADO COWBOY
impresses.  The cinematography by Morten Sandtroen, which won an award
at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, is eye-catching, using a variety of
unusual camera angles to capture unique images.  The sound editing,
credited to Stuart Stanley, is some of the best ever in a low-budget
film.  COLORADO COWBOY is almost worth viewing on technical merit
alone.</P>
<P>     There's really nothing that sets this particular documentary apart
from dozens of other similarly intentioned features and shorts produced
each year.  Although competently constructed, COLORADO COWBOY is aimed
at a certain population, and viewers not in that group may find the
picture's running time, even at a short seventy-six minutes, overlong.</P>
