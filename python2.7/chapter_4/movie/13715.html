A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: F. Gary Gray</PRE>
<P>Written by: James DeMonaco,  Kevin Fox</P>
<P>Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Samuel L. Jackson plays ace Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny
Roman. Unknown to Danny, corrupt cops in Danny's precinct are running a
scam involving faked insurance claims. They kill Danny's partner and
friend, and frame Danny for the murder.</P>
<P>Danny's not an investigator, but as an expert in hostage negotiation, he
knows all about taking hostages. Danny finds the corrupt Internal
Affairs man whom he think is responsible. Desperate to prove his
innocence, he captures the corrupt official and two office personnel and
holds them hostage in their Chicago office, hoping to wring out a lucky
confession. The police besiege the office building, trapping Danny
inside with the hostages. Thus begins a tense standoff involving SWAT
teams, FBI, gunfights, and clever negotiations.</P>
<P>Opinion: 
THE NEGOTIATOR is a successful balancing act between hostage crisis and
slam bang action flick. Because the main situation takes place in a
small space involving hostages arguing with their captor, THE NEGOTIATOR
sometimes feels like a tight theater piece. But the drama is interrupted
by timely action sequences. (The authorities periodically break in with
escalating firepower, and Danny desperately outfights them to buy more
time to prove his innocence.) </P>
<P>Danny hopes that either the bad guy might confess, or else enough
evidence to prove his innocence might be found laying around the office.
But the creative twist in THE NEGOTIATOR occurs when an intriguing third
possibility arises. Holed up in the office, Danny refuses to negotiate
with anybody accept Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), a steadfast police
negotiator from a non-corrupt precinct. If he can just convince Sabian
of his innocence, Danny might be able to get outside help. Similarly, if
he can win some of the office hostages over to his cause, he might be
able to enlist their aid. Danny's ability and resources for proving his
innocence become a game of negotiation.</P>
<P>THE NEGOTIATOR is about corrupt cops. In the beginning of the movie it
seems the heroes are trying to discover who is stealing from police
pension funds. But by the end of the movie, pensions funds are
forgotten, and the crime seem to be all about insurance fraud. Confusion
about the nature of the actual corruption is my only small complaint
about THE NEGOTIATOR. Ignoring the minor the scam confusion, THE
NEGOTIATOR is an otherwise well-acted, satisfyingly taut,
mouse-versus-cat thriller. It's the only chess game in town that comes
with theater-style drama in addition to SWAT teams, grenades, and police
helicopters.</P>
