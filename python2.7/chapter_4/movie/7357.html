<P>        Near the end of Eraser, there is a startling twist.  The film actually
falls upon... a plot!!!  Yes, Arnie has more to do than just kill
people.  That's right, he actually has to stop an arms-deal before some
really mean-looking rifles get sold to the Russian-Mafia.  Before this, 
Arnie(playing a Witness Protection Marshal, assigned to protect Vanessa
Williams, who has uncovered that her company is planning to sell weapons
to bad guys), basically runs about, and shoots and stabs bad guys.  Of
course, few go to Schwarzenegger epics for it's multi-layered plots, and
the film works because Schwarzenegger, James Caan(playing a fellow
agent/mentor, who is really a mole), and Chuck Russell(who made The
Mask, an underrated Jim Carrey flick) understand this. 
        When, while being ambushed by evil fiends, who wish to slay the pure
and true Vanessa Williams in her place of slumber, William's
ex-boyfriend walks in the house just in time to get blasted across the
room by some "neato gun"(which shoots green electric bolts of aluminum
at the speed of light, or something like that), we laugh and sigh in
recognition; yes, that is just what happens in these movies.    When
Arnie, while being pursued in one of them "abandoned flame factories",
notices that his shotgun is broken, he tosses it to the stalking bad
guy, who stares at it just long enough to be mistaken for our hero, who
of course, was seen by a sniper to be toting a shotgun.  We sigh, again
in recognition, as the poor villain is blasted away by another one of
those cool "neato guns".    Why did the henchman stand and stare at the
gun?  Because, he is a bad guy in an action film, thus, he is stupid.   
And, of course, no Arnold epic would be complete without scenes of
Arnold getting impaled(a BIG nail, a BIG shard of glass)  and shot
through his arms and legs, and then, moments later having all signs of
the wounds vanishing without a trace(who else besides Arnold, Harrison
Ford, or Sly Stallone, could get shot in the arm, and then use that same
arm to pull a damsel in distress to safety).
        Besides all the "fun-dumb" stuff, there are the usual Arnold staples. 
There is one cool stunt, involving Arnold throwing a parachute out a
plane door, and then flying out the plane to catch it.  There are lots
of would-be one-liners/catch-phrases(my fave: after shooting an
alligator in a zoo: "You're luggage.").  Most importantly, there are the
usual thirty-some bad guys dead in 111 min.
        Overall, Eraser is big, expensive, dumb fun.  The acting is exactly
what we'd expect.  Arnie plays a superman, James Caan plays the villain
that way he plays villains, and Vanessa WIlliams' part is basically run,
scream, look nervous, and look good during all of the above.  The stunts
are impressive, as are the shoot-outs.  Although the action does get a
little too gory at times(did we really need long close-ups of Arnie
pulling nails and glass out of his body?), generally, the tone is light.
While not nearly  as good as True Lies(the best shoot-em up ever made),
Eraser is  much better than Last Action Hero, which is enough for me.
