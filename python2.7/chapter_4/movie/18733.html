<P>
L'ATALANTE (director: Jean Vigo; cast: Michel Simon (Jules), Jean Daste
(Jean), Dita Parlo (Juliette), Louis Lefebvre (cabin boy), Gilles
Margaritas (peddler), 1934-France)</P>
<P>Jean Vigo, whose father was an anarchist, as is he, sadly had a
promising artistic future cut short because of his sudden death from a
tubercular condition in 1934. He was just twenty-nine years- old and had
made two brilliant feature films, ZERO CONDUCT and this film.</P>
<P>L'Atalante is, perhaps, considered by some, a dated film as far as its
style goes. But with that being said, there is no denying that it is
still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical
gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it
looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition.
Its romantic story is much like Murnau's SUNRISE (1927), of innocents
from the country getting corrupted by the big lure of the city, and then
finding their true roots again. In this case, the peasant village girl
(Juliette), is amiably played by the notable German silent screen
starlet, Dita Parlo. She marries someone not from the area, the skipper
of a motorized barge, Jean (Daste). His route passes her hometown.</P>
<P>The newlyweds adjust to marriage on the barge, with the eccentric mate,
Jules (Simon), and the moronic cabin boy (Lefebvre) aboard. Jules'
presence gives the film a certain strength, whether in revitalizing
Juliette's spirits, which are encapsulated by her surprised reaction
that she has met someone as knowing as him. She comes to this conclusion
when she visits his room, where she sees that all the junk he has
collected over his years from travelling across the sea and the plethora
of cats he keeps, are extensions of his worldly personality. He becomes
for her someone she can lean on for common sense guidance. By the force
of his humanity and his paternalistic interest in the couple, he can
bring to Juliette a sense of relief from this seemingly forlorn journey
she is on. He is the heart and soul of this film; the richness of his
character gives her a confidence in living. His later role will be that
of savior, bringing her back to the captain after her disappearance.</P>
<P>The ordinary couple are playing out their vexing emotions without
letting on how much these emotions mean to them, until it is almost too
late. Because their emotions and passions are so dominating, the quality
of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state. The
Seine looks so much like a dreamworld, where those on it are just
drifting. Where romantic visions fade in and out, and hopes arise and
perish on a whim.</P>
<P>The peasant girl, away from home for the first time, is bored by the
same monotonous grind aboard the barge. She anxiously tells her husband
that she wants to see the bright lights of Paris. On the night she has
her heart set on going to Paris, as the barge is docked there, the
roguish Jules decides to leave the boat and go to a palm reader to have
his future told, forcing them to stay home and watch the barge. When the
couple do go out in Paris, the husband is outraged at a peddler who
tries to win his wife away from him at a dance hall, and he abruptly
cuts that excursion short. Juliette still determined to see Paris,
sneaks off ship; but the jealous captain, in a rage, takes off for the
next town leaving her stranded. They both find that in their despair
over their separation, that they do miss each other. When they are
reunited, she will have seen enough of the world to know what it means
to be on her own in the hostile world. The city will symbolize
corruption and temptation for both of them, while life on the sea will
come to mean honest work and innocence.</P>
<P>Because the story is such a simple one and the couple in so ordinary, it
is not the story in itself that is exhilerating, as much as the way the
film moves us to look at our own lives, with all its possibilities and
disappointments. It makes us see things in a way that is disarmingly
enchanting. That despite the moroseness and daily grind of regular life,
there is also a poetical and romantic mood, waiting to be tapped.We are
encouraged to look into our hearts and see what matters to us, just as
Jean looked into the water for his missing bride and in a frazzled state
saw an emanation of her, and dove into the water to go after what he was
looking for. He realized that the love he has inside him is manifested
in his dreams.Vigo has created a dreamworld.Which makes his film an
out-of-this world cinematic experience that sublimely lingers in our
consciousness.</P>
<P>The film version to see, which is now on video, is the restored 1990
one, that Pierre Philippe and Jean-Louis Bompoint recovered missing
footage for.The film is now more decipherable from the botched up
initial showing of the film, that was not well received by the Paris
audience. It is good to see Vigo's almost original version of the film
resurrected, at last, and look so stunningly beautiful in
black-and-white.</P>
