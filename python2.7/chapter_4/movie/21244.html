<P>"You might not want to say 'Superstar' anymore because some people
might say that you super suck."</P>
<P>Starring Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix, Mark McKinney.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>I love Saturday Night Live. The legendary variety show has slipped a
bit in consistency of late, but it's still the smartest, funniest 90
minutes on tv. The good thing about the show -- and head honcho Lorne
Michaels is still not getting this -- is that the laughs come in four
minute skits. That's right, four minutes. Four, not ninety. When a
concept that can barely fill four minutes with laughs is stretched to
more than twenty times that length, very bad things happen. Those bad
things are called "SNL Movies".</P>
<P>There have, actually, been a couple of successful ones. The Blues
Brothers was a hit, and Wayne's World developed an inordinately large
fan following, though I didn't really like it. But they were followed
by abominations such as Wayne's World 2, It's Pat! (a title eventually
tagged with "but who cares?") and A Night at the Roxbury, proving that
a variety sketch is not the best model for a feature-length movie. And
yet the saga continues with Superstar, which earns points for breaking
the gender barrier but quickly loses them for being, well, not very
funny.</P>
<P>Whether she likes it or not, the film belongs to SNL vet Molly Shannon
who plays Mary Katherine Gallagher, an unpopular schoolgirl with dreams
of big-time stardom and fantasies about the French-kissing the school
hunk (Will Ferrell). Her dream is to become famous so she tries out for
her Catholic School's talent show ("Cheerleaders Fight VD"). Being the
most unpopular girl in school, she is mocked and jeered at every turn,
except, of course, by the school psycho (Harland Williams) who
inevitably turns out to be a sweet and tender "big lug".</P>
<P>There are obstacles everywhere, from Mary's grandmother who wants her
to be a business woman, to the nasty Evian ("Go drink a bottle of
yourself," Mary exclaims), the head cheerleader whose goal in life is
to make Mary miserable. Can she hop over all the hurdles in her path
and become a Superstar? What do you think?</P>
<P>There is something inherently amusing about watching 40-year-olds play
high-schoolers (not to give any bright minds in Hollywood any ideas),
and I liked the fact that they let Shannon, a woman, do all-out Carrey-
style full body humor. In fact, Shannon is a funny and talented
actress, but she is stuck with a script that makes her rerun the same
gags over and over until even she looks like she is about to bail.
Superstar is intermittently amusing, but those moments are few and far
between. It's full of jabs at Catholicism (I'm surprised the ubiquitous
and rather blind to reality Catholic League didn't make this film a
prime target of its protests; at times, it's downright offensive) that
aren't particularly clever, just mean-spirited.</P>
<P>Superstar is redundant, repetitive and not particularly amusing, with
an unacceptably low gag-to-laugh ratio. A gleeful spirit surrounds the
film's star, but she is lost in a meandering plot and an unsatisfying
screenplay. I have a feeling that sooner or later she will get the
project she deserves; for now, she'll have to settle at making us laugh
on tv, forgetting this misguided production as quickly as possible.
Shannon is a veritable superstar already. This was the last thing she
needed.</P>
