<PRE>                         THE HORSE WHISPERER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Robert Redford directs himself as a
          Montana horse lover who solves emotional problems
          between horses and their owners.  Kristin Scott
          Thomas is a New York mother of a girl who had a
          tragic accident on a horse.  In calling on Redford
          to cure her daughter and her horse, Thomas finds
          herself drawn to Redford and to the Montana life
          style.  The film is a little too obvious, though
          polished and often well observed. The film should
          play well with a BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY sort of
          audience.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>          New York Critics: 15 positive, 4 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     At one point in THE HORSE WHISPERER magazine editor Annie MacLean
(played by Kristin Scott Thomas) looks at a proposed cover and says
something like "The photo is perfect, the cropping is perfect, and the
layout is perfect.  It's dull.  Do it over."  Don't get me wrong.  THE
HORSE WHISPERER is a good film and not dull, but that quote comes
pretty close to pointing to the film's biggest weakness.  The story is
just a bit straightforward and obvious.  There are no surprises to
anyone who sees the trailer and makes all the obvious extrapolations.
Richard LaGravenese who wrote the screenplay for THE BRIDGES OF MADISON
COUNTY co-wrote the screenplay here also and it shows.  Robert Redford
co-produced and directed as well as taking the top-billed role of Tom
Booker.</P>
<P>     Annie MacLean is an editor on a high-profile magazine.  She has
what she thinks is a happy marriage to lawyer Robert MacLean (Sam
Neill) and a daughter, Grace (Scarlett Johansson) just 13.  And Grace
has a horse, Pilgrim.  One icy day Grace is riding with a friend and
their horses slip on a slippery hill.  In a nightmarish scene they role
and slide right into the path of an oncoming truck.  The friend and her
horse are killed outright.  Pilgrim is injured about as badly as a
horse can be without it being fatal.  Grace loses a leg. Distraught
over her daughter in the hospital, Annie refuses to that the
irreversible step of letting the veterinarian put down the suffering
Pilgrim.  Weeks later the result is a daughter and a horse, both of
whom have lost the will to live.  The maimed horse is wild and the
daughter just simpers and resents her mother's cool detachment.  Grace
retreats into the surrogate life of television watching.  The pressure
of bottling up her emotions makes Annie even more pushy and intolerant.</P>
<P>     Annie decides that what is needed is to have acknowledged horse
expert Tom Booker bring her daughter and Pilgrim back together.  When
Booker refuses to come to New York to look a the horse, over Grace's
and Robert's objection Annie buys a trailer and drives across country
to Montana with Grace and Pilgrim with the goal of getting Booker to
reunite Grace and Pilgrim.  It is a long siege and Annie gets to know
Booker's family and the people of the sparse Montana range.  Naturally
Redford's character is a real man with a natural no-nonsense view of
life that spreads oil on all troubled waters.  Tom is a man who always
knows the right thing to say and makes it look easy.  Annie had hoped
for a dual healing experience of curing Grace and Pilgrim, but she
herself changes as much as either of them and becomes a fuller person.</P>
<P>     In the wrong hands Nicholas Evans's novel could be a maudlin and
over-romantic opus, but Redford is, in fact, more talented as a
director than he is as an actor.  If anything the film is too polished.
THE HORSE WHISPERER may be a little heavy on the perfect landscape
shots.  This is as good a place as any to note that coming from
Touchstone/Disney the photography will probably also show to its best
advantage.  More than any other studio, Disney tries to release prints
on high-quality film stock.  A print may collect scratches after it is
out of Disney's hands, but there will be very few blotches flashed on
the screen because Disney Studios did not cut corners on quality.  The
score by Thomas Newman uses instruments appropriate to the Montana
setting.</P>
<P>     The casting is as polished as the photography with some very
respectable names.  Perhaps Redford himself may be getting a little old
to be playing romantic leads at 61 and his age is starting to show in
his face. Kristin Scott Thomas, best known for THE ENGLISH PATIENT, is
an attractive and intelligent actress. Sam Neill is another good actor
who in this film has too small a role.  Rounding out the cast are Diane
Wiest and Chris Cooper.  Overall this film does not do much that is not
predictable from the earliest parts of the film, but it tells its
romantic story well.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
