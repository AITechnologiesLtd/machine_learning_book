<P>   Six people, each unhappy in his or her own way, get
together in fairly believable ways, each showing the other that
life really is worth living if only you can make a few changes. 
Sound familiar?  The theme sure is, but this is perhaps the
first time a major film uses the motif of karaoke as the
catalytic agent.  What gives the movie most of its charm is
not the shopworn, sentimental story but the surprisingly good
singing by one of Hollywood's greats, Gwyneth Paltrow, who
took away the prizes for her gender-bender role in
"Shakespeare in Love" and now proves that she could
credibly appear on the Broadway stage if Stephen Sondheim
could write a musical for her.</P>
<P>   Bruce Paltrow, noted for his TV series "St. Elsewhere" and
a single feature movie "A Little Sex," is at the helm,
determined to let his performers have as good a time as are
the typically once-shy, now-turned-on-by-karaoke folks once
put into the limelight to enjoy a high which some insist is as
effective as a snort of coke.  Using John Byrum's sugary
script, he opens his story on a professional singer, Ricky
Dean (Huey Lewis), who behind thick-framed glasses could
probably fool anyone into thinking he's a nerdish school
teacher who knows nothing about karaoke.  His shtick is to
come up to those who are performing in the mid-west bars
where singing to canned music is de rigueur, shake his head
in puzzlement over this "karate-oakley," and wonder why
people would want to waste time at such a foolish pastime. 
Putting down a few hundred dollars as a bet with a hayseed
who thinks he can eat the man for lunch, he knocks 'em dead
and takes off with his newfound cash.  Trouble is the man is
unhappy, his former girl friend having died.  When he shows
up for the funeral he meets his daughter for the first time, she
hooks on to the reluctant man, and from then on they're a
singing team.  And boy can Liv (Gwyneth Paltrow) make her
old man look even better, harmonizing with her silky vocal
chords about as well as the best in the group, a hustler of
another sort named Suzi (Maria Bello), who teams up with
underachieving cab driver Billy (Scott Speedman) in an all-
too-sketchy portrayal, who drives her from the midwest to
California to pursue a singing career.</P>
<P>   Gwyneth Paltrow's startling vocal qualities aside, the
stealer this time around is Paul Giamatti in the role of a
perpetually traveling businessman, Todd, terribly unhappy not
only because he is away from his family so often
accumulating frequent flyer miles but because he is facing a
moral dilemma.  Berating himself for despoiling the
environment--at one point he kicks himself verbally for
destroying the breeding ground of turtles in order to develop
a theme-park waterslide for children--Todd hooks up with
escaped convict Reggie (Andre Braugher), who tells one man
whom he robs that he has no skills, but is put on the right
track by Todd who brings out the singer in him at the karaoke
competitions.</P>
<P>   The highlight of John Byrum's script is a monologue that
could be a treasure if used by actors in auditions, in which
Todd lashes out against the strip-malling of America, raising
the red flag of revolution against the McDonalds, Wendys and
Pizza Huts that have turned this country from a pristine
paradise into a commercial eyesore.  Acting out a major
midlife crisis, Todd dons a single earring, gives up his razor
blade for days at a time, and roams the midwest with his new
buddy in search of a life free from the physical and emotional
poisons of American corporations.</P>
<P>   When Giamatti takes off in the role of his lifetime, he will
have the audience eating out of his hand.  But when oddball
humor is at the forefront, director Paltrow could conceivably
lose some of the fans of the very types of movies against
which Todd could conceivably rage.  The karaoke does not in
any way dominate the picture and, in fact, the final
competition does not end in the style of the typical football
movie with the audience two steps ahead of the judges. 
Rather the contest is cut short in favor of heartstring tugs. 
While the father-daughter bonding is hackneyed and the
underachiever-hustler scenario is underdeveloped, Paltrow
does succeed enough by highlighting Giamatti in his first
scene-stealing role and featuring the heretofore unknown
quality of Gwyneth Paltrow's sound.</P>
