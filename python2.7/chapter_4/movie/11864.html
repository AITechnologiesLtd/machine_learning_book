<PRE>The Replacement Killers (1998)
* * * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Perversely entertaining Hong Kong action with the God of Gamblers
himself, Chow Yun-Fat. Mira Sorvino ain't bad either, but the main
attraction is the movie's glossy look.</P>
<P>Chow Yun-Fat commands the screen the way very few actors do, no matter where
they're from. See him in the dozens of other movies he's done for the Hong
Kong studios (and hang yourself if you haven't seen him in John Woo's
masterpieces THE KILLER and HARD-BOILED). He is one of the few cult-movie
figures who lives up to and beyond the hype. In THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, he
strides onscreen as if just coming in from another HK production without
losing a beat.</P>
<P>HK fan that I am, I held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite
some time. THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS was designed to be Chow's big U.S. debut
vehicle, but it also serves as the debut for director Antoine Fuqua (whose
only previous directorial job was the "Gangster's Paradise" video for
Coolio). Both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie,
which helps to buoy it all up out of the routine and into the realm of the
special.</P>
<P>The plot is not the main attraction. Chow plays a hitman who crumbles when
faced with the prospect of having to ice a policeman, and decides to flee
the country. To that end, he enlists Mira Sorvino's character -- a tattooed
forgery artist who lives in an apartment that looks like a close cousin to
the one J.F. Sebastian inhabited in BLADE RUNNER. Then bad guys with tons of
firepower come gunning for both of them, and they have to hit the road.</P>
<P>Fuqua knows his HK action staples. The movie is saturated with highly
choreographed violence. The whole movie glows and glitters: shattering
glass, guns blazing, false-color shots from *inside* a gun as a round is
chambered. Sparks shoot as high-tension lines give when bodies fall on them.
Metal crumples as cars slam into each other, reflecting the moody
green-and-yellow lighting in an underground parking garage. Sunglasses
glint. Put simply, if you don't like movies where these things all figure in
abundance, stay home. If you do, buy three copies. You'll wear them all out
soon enough.</P>
<P>Chow and Sorvino's characters do not like each other very much -- it's hard
to like someone who seems to be responsible for getting your place
torched -- but they form a mutual respect which is credible on-screen, and
work together to get themselves out of trouble. There's also a good
supporting role by Michael Rooker (remember him from HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A
SERIAL KILLER?) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the
outside, and  yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of Jurgen
Prochnow.</P>
<P>THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is all surface, but it's a wonderful surface to look
at. Good show all around. Now let's see Chow -- and Fuqua -- in something a
little more substantial. I *know* Chow can handle it.</P>
