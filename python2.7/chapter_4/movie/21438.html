<P>Forget THE HAUNTING! Forget those kids running around in their backyard with
a VHS camera! Forget your common sense, grab some friggin' nachos and an
ice-cold Coke and prepare to have yourself a mindless haunting of a time! I
have never seen the original of this film, so you don't have to worry about
me boring you with useless comparisons. I saw it clear-minded, ready to be
thrilled (Halloween), and well, I'll admit, a little sleepy. Well, it all
worked for me!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Five people get invited to spend a nite at a "haunted" house by a reputed
master of terror and his weirdo wife. He offers them each the purse of
$1,000,000 if they are able to last the night, without being killed. It's
not long before everyone begins to feel the real horror oozing out of the
house itself. Terror ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I had a blast at this movie! It was pure, unadulterated fun set perfectly on
the weekend of ghouls and goblins. It's funny because due to the lack of
press screenings by the studio, I was convinced that soon after the film's
slick opening credit sequence, the other shoe would eventually fall off. So
I waited and waited and waited, but never a shoe did fall. The film began on
a campy B-movie feel and kept going strong with enough blood, gore,
creepiness and thrills to give me a haunted woodie. The soundtrack also drew
another one of my thumbs up, as well as the main over-the-top performance
from the Vincent Price-esque Geoffrey Rush. And unlike THE HAUNTING, this
film didn't waste any time to get going, and resorted to very few CGI
special effects, and even then, only in the last twenty minutes or so. I'll
admit that the special effects and the ending were this film's weakest
links, but all in all, it kept me interested, creeped out, full of energy
and believe it or not, guessing...the whole time!</P>
<P>Were most of the characters in this movie based in stock wood? Did they put
themselves in unbelievably stupid situations like in most other horror
flicks? Sure, but it didn't matter since these type of movies aren't about
character development, they're about thrills, blood, murders and overall
creepiness, and stab me in the back if that ain't what this film delivered.
I also enjoyed all of the film's grungy sounds, whispers and screams which
seemed to be resonating throughout the movie and the unique style delivered
by director William Malone. The one thing which I did find amiss was the
humor aspect which seemed to have been forgotten in the script, but then
again, maybe that's what kept me more "into" the movie (Granted, Chris
Kattan did have some pretty funny lines). No pop references galore and no
teeny-bopper girls bouncing around in their tight tanktops (although there's
something to be said about them as well:). It's a straight scary movie done
in a campy way with plenty of energy and a handful of twists and turns. See
this movie if you're in the mood to be taken through a fun haunted house at
an amusement park without the long waits in line. Skip this movie if you
want a deeper terror a la SHINING and expect to be blown away by its precise
narrative. It's easy, it's loud, it's fun, it's gory, it's junk food for the
scary bastard in all of us, and I'll be damned if it ain't my guiltiest
pleasure of the year! It's cheesolicious!!</P>
