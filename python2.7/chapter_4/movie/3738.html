<PRE>                               BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Batfans, I have some good news and some bad news for you.  The
good news is that the new Batman film, BATMAN FOREVER, is definitely
better than the previous installment, BATMAN RETURNS.  The bad news is
that isn't saying much.</P>
<P>     In this latest outing, Batman is pitted against two arch-criminals
who are attempting to take over Gotham City and then the world by way
using television to manipulate people's brains.  In addition, he gains
a partner, Robin, and also finds a new girlfriend, Dr. Chase Meridian.</P>
<P>     In an attempt to freshen and lighten things up, director Joel
Schumacher and his band of filmmakers have made a number of changes.
Cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt and production designer Barbara Ling
make Gotham city a much more open, colorful place.  Costume designer
Ingrid Ferrin and her crew have created a new Batsuit (complete with
nipples) and composer Elliot Goldenthal has written a brighter, less
moody (and less interesting than Danny Elfman's compositions for the
first two films) score.</P>
<P>     The biggest change however is in the cast.  Val Kilmer, replacing
Michael Keaton, lightens up Batman, almost too much, to match the
film's new tone.  For the first time in the Batman series the Caped
Crusader is not overshadowed by the villains.  To Kilmer's credit this
was no easy task since his adversaries, Harvey Two-Face and the
Riddler, are played by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey respectively.
O'Donnell also holds his own against these sometimes overbearing actors
with his energetic portrayal as the Boy Wonder.  Finally, Nicole Kidman
manages to pump up her one dimensional role by making the most of her
goofy dialogue and by, well, by just looking damn good.</P>
<P>     Unlike the original film where Jack Nicholson's The Joker blew
everyone and everything in the movie away and in the second one where
Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman stole the show, the villains this time out
are pretty much duds.  Tommy Lee Jones is a superb actor but his
Two-Face character feels unnecessary and weighs down the film.  It
seems more like a marketing and merchandising decision to have him than
an artistic one (thin or frightening and of course a Batman villain has
to be both.</P>
<P>     BATMAN FOREVER delivers some laughs and a few thrills but
ultimately, like the other two films, it boils down to a great deal of
hype for a great deal of nothing.  The cinematic condiments (the
effects, the sound, the lightning) may make you feel as if you have
seen something special, but its all smoke and mirrors.</P>
