<P>To follow the career of Alfred Hitchcock, is to experience the various ups
and downs which are habitual among any artist. The rotound, wickedly droll,
master of suspense reached his height in the thirties, fifties and sixties.
What comes afterwards, before and in the middle is of little consequence.
Does anybody (but me) remember Blackmail, Shadow Of A Doubt, or Frenzy?
These soft efforts pale next to what I consider his top four. The Lady
Vanishes takes place on a train, revolving around a terrific set-piece in
which an older woman dissapears. Psycho follows a nice young fella who
killed his mudda and went crazy. Rear Window lets us peep on all those
crazy neighbors who leave their curtains drawn during the day AND night.
And Vertigo is...something more. It is one of the most haunting, goreously
photographed, involving, beautiful films ever commited to screen. It is his
least overtly entertaining, yet most rigorously thought provoking. And it
grows greater and greater with every viewing. Upon first observations, one
can remain unimpressed by his slow pacing, overdramatic music, strange
plot, stereotypical characters. Yet, the more and more I see it, the more I
love it, and understand what Hitchcock was thinking. I could easily write
pages, disecting every few minutes, pointing out loose ends -- what
happened to Midge?, why was Madeleine in that window? -- and anybody who
wants to hear
 about this, can subscribe (details below), for I soon plan to gather these
ideas into an entire essay. But, as these thoughts have not yet been
arranged, polished, perfected, let me say that it remains a mystery why it
was so thorougly thrashed upon its initial release, in 1952. (This was,
coincidentally, the same year that Sight & Sound conducted its first poll
of the ten greatest films of all time. Citizen Kane had been seen so little
that it was nowhere in sight -- or sound -- but by 1962, it was at #1,
where it has been ever since). I more understand why it hit high spots such
as #7 in '82, #4 on the critic's list in '92, and #6 on the director's list
in '92. It is ravishing, entertaining, and out of place in Hitchcock's
repertoire. It has inspired directors from Steven Speilberg to Tim Burton
(for particulars see Jaws and Batman). It is one of the greatest films ever
made. You can lump The Lady Vanishes, Psycho, and Rear Window into the same
category -- Shadow Of A Doubt goes there too, although it doesn't really
live up to the other's complete mastery. They are entertaining peices, well
arranged and easy to swallow. The first three are masterpieces, and
individually there is much to say -- which will eventually be said. But
after so thoroughly discussing his greatest masterpeice, I find that its
somewhat easier just to state that they are great films, worth a look. They
just don't inspire the same reactions -- they're easier to deal with. To
quote the man himself, to me, the cinema is not a slice of life, but a
piece of cake.</P>
