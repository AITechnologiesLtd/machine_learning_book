<PRE>CRIMSON TIDE  ****</PRE>
<P>Directed by Tony Scott
Starring: Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, George Dzundza, Vitto Mortensen.
Written by Michael Schiffer</P>
<P>     There is a much respected poem which is often used on graduation cards
which has an all important theme: that the journey's end is not as
important as the journeying itself.  This age old saying has never been
more true than with the new thriller CRIMSON TIDE.  Even though the end
may not have as an emotional impact as expected, it is not so bad as to
spoil the brilliance of what has come before it.</P>
<P>     The prologue to this story is simple, and one which causes concern due
to how believable a situation it creates.  A group of Russian rebels has
split from the regular army to follow an ultra right-wing leader who is
threatening the use of nuclear weapons.  Upon noticing this on television at
his daughter's birthday, chief naval officer Hunter (Washington) is called
away from home.  Washington interviews with the commander of the USS
Alabama, Capt. Ramsey (Hackman) to serve as XO (senior officer) of the sub.
 This si a tense but eventually successful interview for the XO.</P>
<P>     Once underway, CRIMSON TIDE becomes part submarine action thriller
and part character study.  Early on in the ships mission we are given a
sense of foreshadowing of what will become the films main conflict. 
Captain Ramsey, at dinner with his supervisors, asks the XO about his
beliefs regarding war.  Again, although calm on the surface, there is a
gripping sense of tension as Washington disagrees with Hackman.  Both
actors are 1st rate in their roles, especially Hackman who seems to shine
when playing villains these days.  His Captain Ramsey is methodical yet 
boisterous and ferocious in his grip of the ship.  He smokes his cigars
with the elegance of a statesman, but never loses the edge that he could
blow up in a split second.  Washinton's XO is cool and collected.  He sees
the men's moral and situation sink, pun intended, and tries to help with
humour and authority mixed.  </P>
<P>     After completing a trial run of the ships emergency weapons procedure
and some intense technical problems, the sub receives a message to eproceed
to Def Con 2: put the ships nuclear warheads on standby, ready to fire! 
Now the main problem ensues: the Captain wants to go ahead with the
launching of the weapons to beat the Russian rebels who are in the process
of fueling their nuclear weapons, and the XO wishes to find out what a
second emergency message sent which was cut off, means.  The two now are at
odds but the captain needs XO Hunter in order to properly launch the subs
missiles.  At this point, the already well paced action becomes breakneck
and tremendously engaging.  Captain Ramsey is arrested and the XO takes
charge, but a core group of officers find themselves at odds with the XO
and release the Captain and take over the ship once more.</P>
<P>     Director Tony Scott does a great job of never letting the pace slip
beyond a furious speed.  We are rushed along the ships galleys and up and
down it's stairs.  We are plunged into the different areas of the sub and
are quickly assimilated into their functions.  Cinematographer Doriusz
Wolski creates a memorable and stylish atmosphere with great shadow and
intense colour.  All the supporting cast are brilliant, especially Viggo
Mortensen who plays the ships weapons officer.  </P>
<P>     We know where this film is going, but getting there is what this story
is about.  The script is incredibly intelligent, and does not create such a
right and wrong that we loose touch with either of the main characters. 
The secondary characters are developed much better than in most films of
this nature, and are only helped as i said by really fine acting.</P>
<P>     Too much publicity around this film has compared it to THE HUNT
FOR RED OCTOBER.  Whether it is better or not I'm not sure, but on its
own it is a first rate thriller and one I recommend highly.</P>
