FORT APACHE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>People who like to classify movies according to their
quality are often reminded of a phenomenon called "guilty
pleasures" - films that are bad, but still liked, even by
those filmophiles who should know better. On the other hand,
we might encounter quite the opposite phenomenon - films
that should be viewed as masterpieces, but are actually not
very liked. The author of this review encountered such
phenomenon very often in the case of John Ford. The reason
for that probably lies in first impressions which weren't
very favourable towards John Ford's work. In my early years
I used to like westerns very much, but westerns by John
Ford, who had been often referred as the best and most
important director of the genre, looked somewhat "too
artistic" or not attractive enough to be actually liked.
Those impressions stuck with me in latter years, even after
my taste in films became evolved. Such was the case with
FORT APACHE, 1948 western by John Ford, first in his US
Cavalry trilogy.</P>
<P>The script of the film, written by Frank S. Nugent is based
on the story called MASSACRE by James Warner Bellah. Fort
Apache is small, desolate garrison of US Cavalry, populated
by rag-tag bunch of Civil War veterans, many of them former
officers and now reduced in rank and pay. The garrison gets
the new commander - Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (played
by Henry Fonda), accompanied by his lovely daughter
Philadelphia (played by Shirley Temple). Thursday sees his
new post as humiliation and desperately seeks ways to
reclaim his honour and prove himself as capable military
leader. His arrogance would cause conflict with his
subordinates, and his class snobbery would make a rift
between him and Philadelphia, when she falls in love with
young Lt. Michael O'Rourke (played by John Agar), son of
Sergeant O'Rourke (played by Ward Bond). The biggest
conflict arises when Thursday, against the advice of his
much and experienced subordinate, Captain York (played by
John Wayne) decides to betray Cochise, legendary Apache
chief, in order to start war that would bring him
long-desired fame. At the end, Thursday would reach his
goal, but not in a way he had anticipated.</P>
<P>Since the plot of this film bears more than small
resemblance to the legend of Custer's Last Stand, John Ford
uses this opportunity to explore the reality of Old West,
and it the same time keep the mythical distance towards this
popular subject. This film indeed deals with the darker
pages of Old West history - the ways in which US government
dealt with the Indians and its own war veterans, and the
rigid class system that existed in US Army at the time.
Those motives are used in variety of vignettes that deal
with the everyday lives of Fort Apache cavalrymen. Although
many of those vignettes slow down the pace of the movie,
making it two hours long, some of them are very amusing, and
sometimes even touching; John Ford obviously liked his
characters and thanks to the actors of his legendary "Stock
Company" they appear as the most memorable element of this
film. This is not the case with the romantic subplot
involving Philadelphia and young O'Rourke - it seems
forcefully introduced into to the movie only to satisfy
Hollywood formula.</P>
<P>The acting in the film is, on the other hand, very good.
Henry Fonda, who plays arrogant and self-obsessed
militaristic maniac, never slips into over- acting and paves
a way for the role of the true villain role in ONCE UPPON A
TIME IN WEST twenty years later. John Wayne, who is
overshadowed by his performance, has a rather thankless role
of a second fiddle. That role is even more compromised by
the sudden and rather unexplained change of heart in Wayne's
character - Captain York, who was portrayed as a man of
integrity is following the party line at the end. Wayne was
probably less responsible for that than Ford himself, who
had rather ambiguous feelings about military while making
this film. On one hand, he clearly deplores militaristic
folly, while, on the other hand, sees the military as one
big family. That ambiguity is probably the biggest weakness
of this film, with the rather forgettable musical score by
Richard Hageman being the close second. So, this film isn't
among the best westerns ever made, not even among the best
films by John Ford. Despite all of its imperfections and
despite the fact that it isn't the must-see or cult classic
material, FORT APACHE is still a very good piece of cinema,
essential for those who want to see expressions of American
myths in Hollywood movies.</P>
