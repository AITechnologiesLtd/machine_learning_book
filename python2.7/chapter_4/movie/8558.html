                          THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        THE LOST WORLD is one of those rare movies we all go to 
see because we think we have to. There are one or two of these every 
year, and each one seems a bigger `event' than the last one. These 
movies aren't really any better than most of the other ones we line 
up to see, but for these – and God knows why – we'll stand in line 
twice as long and take cramped seats in crowded theaters. THE 
LOST WORLD is the only sequel to an event movie that's been a 
bigger event than the original. And, as usual, none of us know why.</P>
<P>        This is Steven Spielberg's first film since Schindler's List. 
>From looking at it, he must have taken a nice three-year vacation, 
because he certainly wasn't throwing all that work into THE LOST 
WORLD. By now, Spielberg and the audience know how these 
action sequels go. The returning characters know they're dooming 
themselves to more near-death experiences for no good reason, but 
they go anyway. Kind of like all of us lining up to see the movies 
themselves.</P>
<P>        Lost in the LOST WORLD casting this time around are Sam 
Neill, Laura Dern and Samuel L. Jackson. The only ones to return 
are Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough and those two bratty kids. 
Luckily, the last three are limited to a cameo appearances at the 
beginning and end. Attenborough's purpose in the sequel is the 
same – he has to be the idiot who sends humans into the dinosaurs' 
natural environment. This time, he's converted `from capitalist to 
naturalist,' interested only in the welfare of the surviving dinosaurs.</P>
<P>        The original JURASSIC PARK island has been destroyed, 
but naturally there is a `Site B' island not mentioned in the first 
movie. Lots and lots of computer-generated dinosaurs, and 
Attenborough wants to send a team of experts in there to endorse the 
habitat, or else his board of directors will wrestle control away from 
him. You see, things are already going wrong on the hidden island. 
A little girl was attacked by a group of tiny dinosaurs. She lived, of 
course. Little girls don't die in these movies.</P>
<P>        He wants Goldblum to be one of the four to go onto the 
island, but of course Goldblum resists, remembering the T-Rex 
attack the last time he listened to Attenborough. I was wondering 
just how stupid he'd have to be to agree to set foot on another 
dino-infested island, when a convenient plot device was thrown in. 
Goldblum's paleontologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore) is already on 
the island, jumping at the chance to study real live extinct dinosaurs. 
So he has to go protect her personally.</P>
<P>        Goldblum heads to the island in a camouflage Mercedes 
with a photographer and some other guy. It's a bad sign that we 
have no idea about this third guy – bad for him, anyway. It means he 
becomes dino-meat before the end of the first hour. There's also a 
stowaway; Goldblum's young daughter hides in the equipment 
trailer, eager for a chance to bond with Dad. God knows there's no 
better way to get close to your parents than running from 
velociraptors together.</P>
<P>        And, in another Michael Crichton plot twist left over from 
TWISTER, there's a rival team of experts in the picture, but these 
guys aren't good because they're only interesting in harnessing the 
dinosaurs for physical profit. That means lots of victims for the 
dinosaurs. One of them, heaven forbid, has come for the sole 
purpose of killing a Tyrannosaurus. It's the ultimate macho hunting 
expedition for him and, sure, this is pathetic, but are we really 
supposed to hate him for capturing a baby T-Rex and using it as bait 
for the adult? I mean, come on, Tyrannosaurs aren't choir boys; 
they're deadly killers. They ate that lawyer in the first movie.</P>
<P>        Things move pretty slowly for the first hour or so, like the 
original JURASSIC PARK, although the slow parts of the first film 
were interesting because they explained the processes for bringing 
dinosaurs back to life. It was educational; I was able to resurrect a 
stegosaurus in my backyard the very next week. This time we have a 
little bickering between Goldblum and Moore and Goldblum and the 
daughter.</P>
<P>        It's bad filler, and the action scenes aren't a whole lot 
better. There's a tired 20-minute scene with two T-Rexes trying to 
push the trailer (with Goldblum, Moore and the photographer 
inside) over a cliff. In grand action flick tradition, the trailer hangs 
precariously for a few minutes while the three of them almost fall 
out of it, then the three hang from a rope for a few minutes and 
almost fall from that. A whole eighth of the movie is wasted on this 
one tired sequence.</P>
<P>        THE LOST WORLD can't match JURASSIC PARK for 
sheer action. The entire last half of the first movie was devoted to 
non-stop action scenes with the dinosaurs and other threats, most of 
which were genuinely thrilling. This time, some of the stuff seems 
like a parody of the original. One need only watch the scene with 
Goldblum's daughter defeating a velociraptor through a gymnastic 
act on a bar to know what I'm talking about.</P>
<P>        The novelty of dinosaurs in the modern-day world has worn 
off since the last movie; now we need something one step further. 
What we get from Spielberg is an inferior retread of the first movie, 
minus most of the characters. It's mostly second-rate, including a 
climax in which one of the Tyrannosaurs gets loose in modern-day 
San Diego. Nothing we haven't seen in 30 Godzilla movies. Let's 
just hope Spielberg's next project isn't a sequel to SCHINDLER'S 
LOST, although he could use the same slogan as THE LOST 
WORLD: `something has survived.'</P>
