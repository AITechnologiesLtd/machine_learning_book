<PRE>Judgment Day (2000)
Rating: 2.5 stars out of 5.0 stars</PRE>
<P>Cast: Ice-T, Suzy Amis, Mario Van Peebles, Coolio, Linden Ashby, Tom
"Tiny" Lister Jr., Max Gail 
Written by: William Carson 
Directed by: John Terlesky 
Running Time: 90 minutes </P>
<P>An asteroid is on its way towards Earth, and the one man who knows the
technology to stop it has been kidnapped by a religious fanatic (Mario
Van Peebles) who thinks the upcoming destruction of the planet is God's
will.  It's up to a rogue FBI agent (Suzy Amis) and a convict (Ice-T) to
find him.  Sure, it's a direct to video knock off of Armageddon and Deep
Impact... but it's really not that bad, with surprisingly good
production values for a movie of it's type.  The performances are also
surprisingly decent. </P>
<P>Director John Terlesky is an actor as well, probably best known for his
prominent role as C.J. in 1987's The Allnighter (he also played the
Deathstalker in Deathstalker II, whatever that may be).  Also, it's good
to see Max Gail (from TV's "Barney Miller") again. </P>
<P>Judgment Day is available on DVD from Artisan Home Entertainment.  It
contains the film enhanced for 16:9 televisions, and includes the
trailer, cast and crew information, and "asteroid information".  [R]</P>
