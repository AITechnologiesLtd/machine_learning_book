<P>The day after I saw this movie, I was reading in The New York Times 
George Vecsey's analysis of the US women's soccer team victory. 
(Vecsey is both a paragon of sports writers and an excellent author 
of non-sports books, including "Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner's Daughter" 
the bestseller which became a great movie). I quote:  "Now the 
American women are hot, but, then again, America lives for temporary 
diversion and instant gratification -- new pop groups, new 
sunglasses, new cars, new Internet stocks." One might add to this 
many other items, including new movies, such as Arlington Road.</P>
<P>The following day I received a TBS announcement for a made-for-cable 
film, First Daughter, about the kidnapping of the President's 
daughter by American terrorists. As Voltaire said about God, "if He 
didn't exist, he should have been invented." Hollywood, in the 
absence of that so-useful Big Bad Soviet Bear, predictably turned to 
world-wide terrorism , including home-grown American destroyers. As 
in Arlington Road, an ambitious but disappointing opus.</P>
<P>At  D.C.'s George Washington University, Professor Faraday ( Bridges) 
teaches courses on terrorism. He's a widower with his boy, Grant. His 
FBI-agent wife, was killed in a Federal cock-up. Faraday is being 
semi-consoled by Brooke, one of his graduate students. He lives on 
Arlington Road where he makes friends with neighbors Oliver (Robbins) 
and Cheryl Lang (Cusack). Then he begins to suspect that Oliver is 
not the architect he claims to be, but a terrorist leader...</P>
<P>The film open with the protracted, unexplained sequence. A heavily 
bloodied, badly burnt boy staggers down a street. Just as you think 
that he'll fall down dead, he is rescued by Michael Faraday who 
drives him to a hospital. It's all  done as a skillful "internal" 
montage, whose horror, however, does not really hide goofs and 
improbabilities. Item: in a close-up, a drop of blood falls on one of 
the boy's sneakers. Seconds later, the same sneaker has no blood. 
Item: Arlington Road is a suburban street flanked by many houses and 
lawns but I cannot remember seeing any people around. It is far too 
convenient that the only driver who notices the kid's predicament is 
Faraday. Item: the child  rapidly goes from apparent death throes to 
a lightning-fast recovery with one arm in a cast as the only visible 
sign. The explanation of the boy's condition, given by his parents, 
the Langs, is a fireworks accident.</P>
<P>All this is an artificial gimmick to have Faraday and the Langs meet 
and develop
nice, neighborly relations. The couple has a  boy, Brady, and two 
girls.  Brady and Grant become best friends. This is held in reserve 
for future, nefarious purposes. It is also is a gimmick for 
dis-alienating the orphan Grant who disapproves of papa's girlfriend 
Brooke, and for turning the 8-year old into a "regular American boy," 
a fact that gets worked into the plot.</P>
<P>Another ho-hummer. Michael Faraday's questioning of Oliver's 
kosher-ness as a designer of malls starts with his 2-seconds' glimpse 
of plans that are not of a mall but of an office building. Quick 
eyes, what?</P>
<P>Item: when later Michael needs to look at those plans by getting into 
the Lang house when the couple is not there, the two little girls who 
open the door are uncharacteristically pan-faced and suspicious; 
Michael's excuses for entering are woolly-minded, blatantly dumb. So 
is his search.</P>
<P>Item: Brooke, rather thinking that Michael's suspicions are paranoid, 
is an  unbelievably obtuse naysayer. So is the FBI agent, a friend of 
Michael's.</P>
<P>Cliche Item: when a good person is feverishly phoning about a 
discovery from a pay-phone, and turns around, the enemy is standing 
there.</P>
<P>Improbable Item: Michael is checking old newspaper files about 
Oliver...who suddenly appears behind him.</P>
<P>Cliche Item: the obligatory as well as unbelievable car chase.</P>
<P>Impossible Item: the way chasers and chased connect.</P>
<P>Goof Item: a car is hit broadsides; next that side is shown undamaged.</P>
<P>[Here I eliminate about dozens of other items]</P>
<P>The finale is highly improbable but does score a point by going 
against the guesses of audiences conditioned by too many action Good 
vs. Evil flicks. I won't disclose it.</P>
<P>The script of Arlington Road-- a name evoking Red, White and Blue 
patriotism-- wastes much money and technical talent  during its two 
hours where nothing makes sense. Its photography and editing are 
artsy not arty. Story an dialogue go overboard with deviousness and 
indirection. Has no one learned from Alfred Hitchcock the value of 
clarity ?. The whole is an alienating mess, and a probably uncalled 
for stress on large-scale, minutely organized, hugely financed (but 
by whom?) American terrorism.</P>
<P>The movie's events are under the sign of  The World Trade Center and 
Oklahoma City bombings, and the mess at Ruby Ridge. Consciously or 
not, it connects with such good pictures as The Invasion of The Body 
Snatchers, The Stepford Wives, Seconds, Rosemary's Baby, et al., that 
is, films where people are not what they seem to be.</P>
<P>Rescuing it from total destruction are good performances by Bridges 
who is convincing in his pain and obsessions; by Robbins who is 
smooth and would be frightening if credible; and by the clever 
casting of ever-charming Joan Cusack as a wolf in lamb's clothing.</P>
