<PRE>Twilight (1998)
2.5 out of 5 stars</PRE>
<P>Twilight: a Crowd Pleaser, But Not For Young People<HR>"Twilight," a new film by Academy-Award-winning
director Robert Benton, deals with an interesting topic.
While the film is being promoted as a dramatic story
about corruption and scandal in Hollywood, the movie
is really about three people who must overcome
problems associated with growing older.</P>
<P>If the entire movie was more like its prologue, it would
have been a definite crowd-pleaser for college
audiences. The sexy, comical prologue takes place in
Mexico. There, a teenager named Mel Ames (Reese
Witherspoon), daughter of Hollywood actors Jack and
Catherine Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan
Sarandon), has eloped with her older boyfriend (Liev
Schreiber) to enjoy the pleasures of life. When private
investigator Harry Ross (Paul Newman) finds her and
tries to return her to her parents, he accidentally gets
shot in the leg by Mel.</P>
<P>After that, the movie shifts to the present. Harry has
retired and is in the permanent service of Jack and
Catherine. When he agrees to deliver a mysterious
package for Jack, he discovers what appears to be the
murder of an innocent man. An ex-cop, Harry hasn't
lost his desire to investigate, and he thinks the killing
might be connected to his employer. His only clue is
the fact that Catherine's ex-husband disappeared
under suspicious circumstances right before she
married Jack. From that point, the movie slowly
progresses to uncover some muddled clues. By the
end, the obvious has been exposed.</P>
<P>The members of the cast fit their roles perfectly.
Sarandon, Hackman and Newman are all aging actors
adept at portraying their characters' struggles. Only
Newman seems to have fun with his role as a
divorced, ex-alcoholic and former private investigator.
Newman charmingly portrays his character's revival
after having been thrown in the middle of a murder
mystery. The humor he inserts into his character is the
best part of the film. Sarandon and Hackman are fairly
uninspired, but then again, their characters basically do
nothing more interesting than vegetate.</P>
<P>"Twilight" may sound appealing from the way it is being
marketed, but it is not the type of film many young
people will enjoy. Unlike most of today's movies,
"Twilight" progresses very slowly, without any very
memorable scenes. The dialogue is contemplative and
filled with long moments of silence while Catherine is
playing the piano for Harry.</P>
<P>While this film likely has value for older people, I am
not in a position to appreciate that fact. As a college student,
I can't recommend this film.</P>
