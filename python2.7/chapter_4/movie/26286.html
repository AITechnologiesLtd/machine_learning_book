<P>Aimee & Jaguar is also a true story of racial intolerance and people 
rising above it, but here the stakes are even higher and the ending less 
uplifting. We're in Berlin in the closing months of WWII, with sirens 
wailing and bombs blowing neighborhoods to rubble, and Jews being herded 
into trucks for concentration camps, while in the concert halls and the 
hotel bars life tries to struggle along with a semblance of normalcy.</P>
<P>Felice Schragenheim (Maria Schrader) is a beautiful, intelligent, 
free-spirited girl with two serious strikes against her under the 
circumstances: she's a lesbian, and she's a Jew. She conceals these 
Nazi-unfriendly traits, and works in the belly of the beast, as the 
trusted secretary of the editor of a Nazi newspaper. Lilly Wust (Juliane 
KF6hler) is the lonely, flibberty-gibbet wife of a German officer, a =
blonde blue-eyed mother of four blonde blue-eyed sons, who cheats on her 
husband to reassure herself while he's at the front.</P>
<P>Felice seduces Lily for fun. Frau Wust has boasted to her nanny Ilse 
(Johanna Wokalek), Felice's lover, that she can smell a Jew. When they 
meet, Felice proffers a perfumed wrist for her to sniff. "Lovely," says 
Lily. "It's French, isn't it?"</P>
<P>But what starts as sport becomes achingly serious. They fall in love. 
There's not much sex, but what there is is intense and beautiful.</P>
<P>Lily is a sweet woman who is not as shallow as circumstances have made 
her, but her naivete leads her to make a couple of terrible blunders. As 
the movie begins and ends, she is an old woman remembering. The real 
Lily Wust still lives in Berlin.</P>
<P>Both actresses are superb. The story is sometimes confusing, and at two 
hours plus it runs to fat, but it's well worth while.</P>
