<P>The popularity of the masked sword-fighter Zorro has plummeted since his
rise to fame in the 1930's. With the appearance of famed superheroes
Batman and Superman in their first feature-length films, Zorro had to
take a back seat. After all, he had no super powers. With the release of
the swashbuckling epic The Mask of Zorro, the franchise has been
revitalized with more potential than anyone had originally foreseen.</P>
<P>As if one Zorro was not exciting enough, The Mask of Zorro gives us two.
The original man in black is Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), a
savior of the Mexican people. In a thrilling prologue, De La Vega is
thwarting the plans of the greedy and careless governor of Mexico, Don
Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson). Afterward, like a medieval Batman riding
a horse through the caves and back to his mansion, we meet his wife
Esperenza and beautiful baby daughter lying peacefully in her crib. But
Montero somehow traces his steps, and Esperenza is accidentally killed
in a struggle. De La Vega is sent of to prison, and Montero whisks his
daughter away to raise her as his own.</P>
<P>Twenty years later, De La Vega finds the chance to escape from prison
once he learns that Montero is back, and has plans to make California
into an Independent Republic. While at first De La Vega plots instant
revenge on his sworn enemy, he sees his daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones),
now fully grown and by Montero's side. He can't bring himself to finish
the deed with such personal issues now in consideration.</P>
<P>Luckily for De La Vega, another young rogue exists that has a personal
grudge against Montero's officers. Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio
Banderas), formerly one half of the infamous Murrieta brothers, is now
miserable and poor as he drinks his problems away. De La Vega stumbles
upon Alejandro when he spots a medallion he once gave to him as a young
boy for helping him in battle. Murrieta, at the time, is plotting to
kill the incomparable and cold-hearted Captain Love (Matt Letscher), who
is responsible for his brother's death. De La Vega teaches him to
control his anger, and enlists his help so that he can finally take
revenge.</P>
<P>And so begins the training of the new Zorro. Banderas is truly wonderful
and dashing in this role, with his inexperienced quips and humorous jabs
about getting into battle. Hopkins, on the other hand, is such a veteran
presence and distinguished actor that we will go along with whatever he
says. Together, they meld exceptionally well as the mentor and his
apprentice. This is the life-force that makes The Mask of Zorro so
enjoyable.</P>
<P>There's also sprinkles of romance between Banderas and the gorgeous
Zeta-Jones, played out in humorous sword-play and marvelous chemistry.
The dialogue throughout the film is crisp and well spoken, separating
the good from the bad with an easily distinguishable black line. The
human elements are fun, but the real scene-stealing belongs to the
incredible fight choreography. Characters clash their swords at
lightning speed, and Banderas flips and tumbles like an amazingly
talented daredevil acrobat. The stunts in The Mask of Zorro are all
spectacular, and the action will give you white knuckles almost
instantly.</P>
<P>There's a few instances of violence that could have been toned down, but
even so this should entertain the whole family. There's enough
well-played humor, rousing action and delightful romance to meet nearly
anyone's approval. The fact that Zorro has no super powers is what makes
him so unique. He fights for something that everyone can get behind,
wants what is best for his people, and has good taste in women... this
is what I call a real hero.</P>
