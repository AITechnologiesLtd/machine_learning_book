DEATH WISH 4: THE CRACKDOWN
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>In the first DEATH WISH movie, mild-mannered New York
architect Paul Kersey, played by Charles Bronson, was
avenging the death of his wife. In the second, he was
avenging his daughter. In the third, he instigated small war
in order to avenge the old friend. Fourth movie, on the
other hand, begins with Kersey doubting the point of his
violent crusades and living the quiet life with his
girlfriend Karen, played by Kay Lenz. However, since this is
DEATH WISH MOVIE, we know that sooner or later something bad
is going to happen to the people Kersey cares for. This time
Karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and Kersey
is forced to return to his old vigilante ways. Kersey's new
targets, unlike the previous movies, aren't the ordinary
street punks but rich, heavily armed and well-connected drug
dealers. Even such unstoppable killing machine like Kersey
needs some support, and it comes from the publisher Nathan
White (John P. Ryan), determined to avenge the drug-related
death of his own daughter. White's plan is to make Kersey
kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate the war between them. The plan begins to
take shape, but Kersey's actions bring attention of two
police detectives - Reiner (George Dickerson) and Nozaki
(Soon Teck-Oh).</P>
<P>Fourth (and, unfortunately, not the final) installment in
the DEATH WISH series, will probably remembered as the
typical movie of Cannon Group, production company
responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the
last decade. However, although some critics might argue,
DEATH WISH 4: THE CRACKDOWN represents slight improvement
over the DEATH WISH 3. Paul Kersey, one of the most
intriguing (and potentially controversial) characters of the
1970s, is still being dumbed down by mediocre script, and
Charles Bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much
effort in his acting. However, the hand of a veteran
director J. Lee Thompson seems more capable of Michael
Winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal,
although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright
boring. There are some attempts for the movie to have a plot
between the numerous scenes of violence, and one of such
attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end.
The script even tries to fake some social conscience
(through criminally underused Kay Lenz's character) and
predates the War on Drugs campaign that would inspire many
Hollywood products in next few years. There are even some
half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and
unintentional, like in a scene where Kersey assassinates mob
figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is
still far away from Bronson's 1970s classics.</P>
<P>(Special note to x-philes: Mith Pilleggi, the actor who
plays AD Skinner in THE X- FILES, could be seen in a small
role of cannery lab foreman).</P>
