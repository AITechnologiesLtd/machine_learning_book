<P>     This is how I know I'm dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence:
ELECTION resists the tidy summations in which most films are all-too-eager
to wrap themselves.  Like many recent films, it is a comedy set in a high
school, but it's more than just the latest high school comedy.  It deals
with a student body election, but it's not really _about_ a student body
election.  It's a film in which characters narrate much of the story, but
it doesn't use that narration in a conventional way.  Like director
Alexander Payne's previous film CITIZEN RUTH -- if to a somewhat less
successful degree -- ELECTION is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let
you know exactly when or whom it's going to cut.</P>
<P>     It's spring at Omaha, Nebraska's Carver High School as ELECTION
begins, which means it's time for elections for the next year's student
body officers.  The prime candidate -- and apparently _only_ candidate --
for student body president is Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), an
extracurricular machine who sees the office as her destiny.  Seeing things
a bit differently is Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a civics teacher
and student government advisor that Tracy rubs the wrong way.  In an
attempt to make the election less of a foregone conclusion, McAllister
convinces injured football hero Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to mount a
challenge, which in turn generates the "third party" candidacy of Paul's
alienated younger sister Tammy.</P>
<P>     It would have been easy enough for ELECTION to turn into a broad
comedy about adolescent peer politics, and it _still_ would have been more
insightful than most teen comedies.  Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor, 
working from Tom Perrotta's novel, have bigger targets in mind.  They use
the Carver High election as a microcosm not just of high school life, but
of politics on a much grander scale.  Tracy Flick's campaign casts her as
a political cousin of our current president, seeking election as a "you
really like me" validation rathern than out of a desire to serve; even her
nomination speech parrots the naming-of-names, I-feel-your-pain personal
touch.  Tammy, meanwhile, rallies the disenfranchised minority behind the
idea that nothing changes but the names in conventional governance.  Even
the ridiculous posters, filled with little more than sloganeering, seem
disturbingly similar to national election campaigning.  It's savvy,
cynical, and very funny.</P>
<P>     Even more effective is Payne's use of that old literary device the
"unreliable narrator" as counterpoint to his direction.  McAllister,
Tracy, Paul and Tammy take turns explaining their take on the events of
the film, each one mouthing words that don't quite match their his or her 
actions.  McAllister describes his personal and professional contentment
as he sifts through a trunk full of pornography; sexually-confused Tammy
explains that "I'm not a lesbian, I'm attracted to the _person_.  It's
just that all the people I've been attracted to have been girls;" Tracy
describes her mother's actions on her behalf in a way that shows she's
being programmed for greatness.  Only Paul, perhaps too dense to be
duplicitous, seems pure of heart.  As he did in CITIZEN RUTH, Payne
explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure, even
when we don't really understand what our motivations are.</P>
<P>     If Payne stumbles anywhere, it's in his choice to focus much of the
film's second half on McAllister's domestic troubles.  Tammy's character
in particular is abandoned by this choice, letting the school
administration's reaction to her unconventional candidacy off the hook too
easily.  But ELECTION is too smart to be derailed by this problem, too
clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological
baggage.  With surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters,
Alexander Payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic
directing touches keep the audience off-guard.  He understands that in a
world where people can't even summarize themselves in a neat-and-tidy
sentence, we can't expect to summarize the movies about them that way.</P>
