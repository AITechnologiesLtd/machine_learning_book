<P>     Nicely photographed and appealingly acted, FOR THE MOMENT is a 
period piece melodrama that transpires during the summer of 1942.  Set 
(and filmed) in Manitoba, Canada, where Allied bomber pilots came for 
instruction, the film chronicles the lives and loves of three airmen:  
Lachlan (Russell Crowe) and Johnny (Peter Outerbridge), a pair of young 
daredevils out to earn their wings, and Zeek (Scott Kraft), a grizzled 
veteran of two European tours of duty, who is their teacher.  FOR THE 
MOMENT is pure, tear-jerking formula, but, because 
writer/director/producer Aaron Kim Johnston conveys such affection for 
his characters, the final product is surprisingly effective.</P>
<P>     Johnny's fiancee is Kate (Sara McMillan), a local girl.  Kate's 
older sister, Lill (Christianne Hirt), is married to Frank -- by all 
accounts the perfect husband, except that he has been off to war for 
more than a year.  Lill is lonely and vulnerable -- easy prey to 
Lachlan's infectious Aussie charm, even as he is smitten by her.  
Meanwhile, the dashing Zeek (Scott Kraft, who bears a passing 
resemblance to GONE WITH THE WIND's Rhett) allows himself to become 
romantically entangled with the region's good-natured whore/bootlegger, 
Betsy (Wanda Cannon).</P>
<P>     For much of the first half, FOR THE MOMENT rigorously uses romantic 
cliches.  The film is obvious, and occasionally clumsy, fleshing out 
characters and their relationships.  There's never any doubt who's going 
to become involved with whom -- just how long its going to take the 
various parties to get together.  It's only the effective chemistry 
between the various lovers that keeps us interested through the less-
inspired moments.  During the second half, however, the movie mixes in 
sentimentality and darker psychological overtones to attain a 
satisfying, if bittersweet, conclusion.</P>
<P>     Russell Crowe (PROOF, THE SUM OF US) makes a wonderful romantic 
lead, blending charm, enthusiasm, good looks, and acting ability into 
his portrayal of Lachlan, who we're supposed to like, and do.  In terms 
of talent, Crowe is far superior to anyone else in the cast, although 
most of his co-stars, including Christianne Hirt, make up for the 
deficiency with general likeability and appeal.  And no one among the 
major players turns in a bad performance.</P>
<P>     FOR THE MOMENT says something about the ephemeral nature of human 
existence, the uncertainty of everyone's future, and the longing we 
often experience for the "road not traveled."  The film takes a little 
too long to tell the story, and there are several superfluous, one-
dimensional villains.  Overall, however, FOR THE MOMENT succeeds at what 
it wants to be:  a weepy love story.  It's not an epic by any means, but 
it is pleasant, which isn't such a bad thing.</P>
