<PRE>DISTURBING BEHAVIOR
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>There's a nugget of a good thriller hidden deep inside Disturbing
Behavior, just waiting to get out.  Unfortunately, it never gets a
chance, and is instead buried in pseudo-thrilling moments mostly
borrowed from bad horror films.</P>
<P>Retreating from troublesome family issues, the Clark family moves to the
seemingly peaceful town of Cradle Bay.  There, eldest son Steve (James
Mardsen) is expected to fit in with his classmates in high school.
However, there's something strange going on under the surface.</P>
<P>Even though he doesn't seem to fit in with them, Steve is immediately
initiated by the paranoid druggies.  His tour guide is Gavin Strick
(Nick Stahl), who, along with his albino buddy U.V. (Chad E. Donella),
is convinced that the preponderance of "perfect" students in the school
is the result of some sort of conspiracy.</P>
<P>You see, the letter-jacket wearing "popular" crowd are all part of a
program called the "blue-ribbons".  It's a goody-two-shoes study group,
in which the members gather at the local yogurt shoppe, listen to a
little Wayne Newton, and study for those Straight-As.  Oh yes, if that
weren't unnatural enough, they are occasionally beset by "toxic jock
syndrome", wherein they suddenly fly into an unexpected homicidal rage.
The strange thing is, most of the "blue-ribbons" were once perfectly
normal misfits, just like Gavin.</P>
<P>Steve isn't quite convinced, nor is token girlfriend Rachel (Katie
Holmes), whose role it is to look rebellious, but fall head over heels
for Steve anyway. However, to add further suspicions, Steve also has
encounters with the  overly slick school psychiatrist Dr. Caldicott
(Bruce Greenwood) and the delightfully mad janitor Newberry (William
Sadler).</P>
<P>Disturbing Behavior is at its best when analyzing the differences
between the various archetypical high school social groups, but at its
worst when it devolves into an oh-so-typical horror yarn.  A more
interesting movie would have played up the paranoia inherent between
school cliques, and possibly eliminated the homicidal angle altogether.
What if we weren't so sure from the first moments of the film that there
is a conspiracy at work here?  Well, we'll never know, as the film takes
the easy way out, by extinguishing intriguing ideas with a douse of
nonsensical horror blather.</P>
<P>Many of the "shocks" in the film aren't really shocking at all, when you
stop and think about them.  However, the film does have a suitably
creepy atmosphere going for it.  Even if there are no true thrills, it
feels as if one may be lurking around the corner.  Too bad it never
comes.</P>
<P>James Mardsen seems, well, too "blue-ribbon" to fill the role of the
outsider. Nick Stahl does a much better job, and should have been given
the lead here. Katie Holmes is spunky enough in a punk-goth way, despite
the fact she doesn't have much of a character.</P>
<P>Disturbing Behavior isn't as bad as it could have been, but it wastes
plenty of potential as well.  Creepy, but never scary (unless you count
some horrid dialogue snippets), the film just doesn't leave a lasting
impression.</P>
