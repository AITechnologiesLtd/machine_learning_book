<P>   In his pan of the 1996 picture "101 Dalmatians,"
distinguished online critic James Berardinelli held that the
movie "belongs in the dog house" because it's "unnecessary
(the animated version is perfectly adequate)...with one
overriding aim: to sucker parents into buying spotted
paraphernalia for their children."  If so, that original live
version ironically runs counter to what could be its subtext: to
warn children of the way the fur industry causes wholly
unncessary suffering--cruelly trapping, killing (by stabbing or
electrocution), and skinning an assortment of animals to
please the taste of bourgeois clients.  I missed "101" but had
been told by an enthusiastic audience member that the
picture nonetheless did convey an important anti-fur
message, though I'm skeptical.  Any animal rights intent may
have been too subtle to be caught by the young.  Morever,
given the level of violence (however cartoonish) in the
present film, "102 Dalmatians," I'd question the wisdom of the
MPAA in granting the movie a "G" rating.  Remember that
this Disney work is not animated.  Cruel things happen to  
person who, though moronic or vulnerable simply do not
deserve the treatment they get.  Kids are likely to leave the
theater with the impression that a person can be pummeled
like a pancake and then sit in an industrial bake oven with a
probable temperature of about 450 degrees Fahrenheit,
emerging as nothing more than the merely humiliated
centerpiece of the confection.</P>
<P>   Version one dealt with the devilish doings of the aptly
named Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), who uses her millions to
capture five-score and one Dalmatian dogs to be fashioned
into a fur coat--giving her 15 minutes of fame in the high-
fashion industry for her creative imagination.  Having served
part of her sentence in a London jail, she enters "102"
reportedly rehabilitated, thanks to the conditioning she
received by a Skinnerian psychologist.  Though her cynical
but blandly attractive parole officer, Chloe (Alice Evans), is
skeptical that a woman like Cruella can be cured, she has no
choice other than to monitor the woman's behavior closely
and toss her back into her cell should she regress into her
fleecephile fantasy.</P>
<P>   The one good feature of "102 Dalmatians" is Assheton
Gorton's production design, which can at least educate the
kids in the audience who think that the United States is the
entire world that there is a timepiece known as Big Ben and
an edifice called the Eiffel Tower that tourists to New York
simply cannot see.  Otherwise, director Kevin Lima, using a
committee-drawn screenplay, shows his disdain for the five-
to-nine-year-olds in the audience by thinking that they will sit
transfixed while gazing at an idiotic servant, Alonso (Tim
McInnerny), who is persistently used as a doormat by his
grandiose employer (played over-the-top as expected by Ms.
Close) and the goody-two-shoes Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd) who
romances the pretty Chloe thinking that he has a chance to
capture her attention when four-legged canines are her whole
life.  Gerard Depardieu was never before as wasted as he is
in this one, driven to following Cruella's orders and repeatedly
pronouncing the species of his captives with the francophone
term "poopies."</P>
<P>   Of course, since this is not an animated feature, we can't
help being amazed at the skill of the trainers, Mark Forbes,
Larry Madrid, and their assistants, who keep the pups and
their parents romping merrily about--though the concept of a
parrot who thinks he's a Rottweiler simply does not fly.  I also
get the impression (correct me if I'm wrong) that all the pups
who are picked up by their humans are females lest
something appear on the screen that could doom the "G"
rating.  </P>
<P>Rated G.  Running time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
