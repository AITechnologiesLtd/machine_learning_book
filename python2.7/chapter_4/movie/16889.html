<P>Character starts with a scene that makes no sense. A young man drives a
knife into the desk of an older man, tells him that he's become a lawyer
and walks away. Who is this kid? Why is he so pissed off? And who is the
old guy and why does he just sit there so emotionlessly? Don't worry –
you'll find out all of the answers because the film is told in
flashback.</P>
<P>The young man is Katadreuffe (Van Huet). Arrested for the murder of the
elder gent, Katadreuffe tells his life story to the Rotterdam cops. I
have a feeling that in real life, the cops wouldn't so much want to hear
about your whole life, but this is just pretend, so I digress.</P>
<P>Katadreuffe explains that the old guy is really his father, a powerful
but super-frigid bailiff named Dreverhaven (Decleir). He was born out of
a one-time affair between Dreverhaven and his equally stoney
housekeeper, who decides to raise the baby on her own. Dreverhaven asks
to marry her, but she moves out and even refuses his monthly offer of
cash for over a year.</P>
<P>Raised in both squalor and total silence, young Katadreuffe is
constantly bullied by the other children, who call his mother a whore.
Whore is apparently the same in every language, a fact that makes me
warm inside. Anyway, he turns to his only source of stress release and
education, an English encyclopedia set (complete only through the letter
"T") found hidden away under the stairs. You just know it won't be long
before he starts yanking on his bootstraps.</P>
<P>After an unsuccessful venture as a cigar-store owner, Katadreuffe is
forced into bankruptcy and, as a result, into the town law firm. He
begins to clerk there and finds out that his debt is not owed to the
bank, but to Dreverhaven. Thus sets the catalyst for the competition and
eventual showdown between father and son.</P>
<P>Fedja Van Huet plays Katadreuffe with a touch of Rufus Sewell's
wide-eyed Dark City gaze and a dash of Robert Downey, Jr's Chaplin. The
Dreverhaven character is easily one of the most diabolical and menacing
of recent memory. Even the name conjures images of Keyser Soyze's past.</P>
<P>Set in the early 20's, Character looks and feels like a cross between
Metropolitan and The Hudsucker Proxy, presenting Rotterdam as the most
abysmal place on earth (at least since The Winter Guest). It won the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and, get this – actually  deserved
it!</P>
