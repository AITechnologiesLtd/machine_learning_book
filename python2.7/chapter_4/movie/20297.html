<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Buster Keaton.  Story by Jean Havez, Joe Mitchell, and Clyde
Bruckman.  Starring Buster Keaton, with Kathryn McGuire.  1924, 45 min., Not
Rated.</P>
<P>     "Sherlock Jr." features extraordinary visual trickery and yet another
charming Buster Keaton performance.  Keaton is a projectionist who is timidly
and successfully vying for the affections of a girl (Kathryn McGuire) until her
father's watch disappears and he is framed by her other suitor, a criminal.
Reality and fantasy are masterfully interwoven as the dejected projectionist,
whose aspiration is to become a detective, winds up in the movie he is playing
for a packed theater.  Keaton breezes through a series of astounding shots with
an equally impressive ease.  </P>
<P>     The forty-five minute running time flies by, leaving you enchanted and
pondering the implications of the projectionist's reliance upon cinematic
example to interact with McGuire. Keaton's father, Joe, plays the girl's
father.  Jean Havez, Joe Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman, who are responsible for
the story, also wrote "The Navigator" (1924), a Keaton classic in which McGuire
has a part, and his "Seven Chances" (1925).  Cinematography by Byron Houck and
Elgin Lessley, who worked on the two aforementioned films, as well.  </P>
