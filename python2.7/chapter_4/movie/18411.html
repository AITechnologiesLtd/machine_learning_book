<PRE>Review: 8MM  (Spoilers)</PRE>
<P>"Tell me," the sidekick from inside the porn scene asks the hero played by
Nicholas Cage after they've watched a couple of really UGLY movies together
in the line of duty, "were you turned on by these?"  "No.  No I wasn't,"
Cage replies.  "But you weren't exactly turned off, either, were you?
Devil's changing you already."</P>
<P>It is hard to believe he wasn't turned off.  I was.  Big time.  Even
literally turned away.  Whenever the films in film became too ghastly to
look at they probably wouldn't show them on the big screen anyway, but I
wasn't going to chance it.  And I'm certainly not going to go into that
flick a second time to find out.  In a way the movie was so horrible because
we don't see the violence but Cage's reaction to whatever it supposedly is
he's seeing, and his face distorted in disgust may have been a lot more
effective than anything we could have witnessed ourselves.  Inspiring so
much confidence, Cage is unbelievably good at conveying any emotion to the
viewer with just a few facial muscles.</P>
<P>That movie was extreme for something in or close to mainstream--so extreme
in fact it's actually slipping beyond the threshold of the plausible.
That's mainly because it's in its moodiness so revolting it actually FORCES
you to take a step back and think about what you're seeing.</P>
<P>And WHEN you think about it you can't help pondering that this is a little
TOO dirty for actual underground porn scene.  Not "dirty" as in "Naughty,
naughty!" but dirty as in literally expecting the rats and the cockroaches
to crawl out of the linoleum there.  While parts of the world may actually
look like that the fact that you see nothing but this level for what seems
to be well over two hours makes it appear more like the world through the
eyes of a vigilante idealist guardian of mores gone gaga.</P>
<P>Many of the elements are classic film noir--decent professional private
investigator with clientele among the high and the mighty and the filthy
rich is hired by an industry magnate's widow to find out whether her
powerful and revered late husband was actually a monster under his facade
of, well, intimidating callous high-roller.  Of course he was, it turns out.
And of course his lawyer, who looks like Geraldo Rivera, was knowingly
devil's advocate.  When would they ever turn out not to be.</P>
<P>Just like the average movie shows you only the beautiful vistas of town this
movie specializes in the ugly, shot through shutter a little too dark with
filters letting mainly cold colors pass, to make you especially depressed.
Bleah!  In fact the whole movie is literally so dark throughout that when at
but one instant there is a sweeping vista of L.A. basking in midday sunlight
hitting your eyes without warning you're actually blinded for a moment.</P>
<P>Cage's detective is a decent boy, Phillip Marlowe type, though happily
married with child--the idealist family values aspect.  He's being called to
investigate whether a so-called "snuff movie" found in the aforementioned
late industry czar's personal vault--an S&M porn movie in which the victim
is actually being killed--is real or fake.  His widow would like to know
whether the man she loved for most of her life was merely a forgivable
pervert or an actual monstrous menace to society.</P>
<P>In the course of his investigations Cage, P.I. descends into an exaggerated
world of evil and ugliness your run-of-the-mill idealist seems to be
fascinated by.  As for me, after an agonizing couple of minutes my disbelief
just snapped in two from too much suspension.  We see rows of shelves where
kiddie porn photos are being sold and duly have your "Ugh!"-button pushed
but can't help noticing that the place looks SO much like you ought to put a
torch to it--not because of what is available there but because of what the
place looks like anyway--that you go straight through revulsion and out the
other end.</P>
<P>He finds the people who did the movie and hires them with his client's money
in order to find out who they are and to expose them.  Alas, they're on to
him, because the decent old lady's late husband's attourney turns out to
have been in on the making of the movie and to have warned the other bad
guys.  Apparently--in good old noir tradition--he never expected our dutiful
young investigator to get this far in the first place and is now in the act
of damage containment.  This is when the film changes from
bottom-of-an-inkwell depressiveness to an actual suspenseful thriller for
just a few minutes, when action is required of our hero to survive, only to
then descend into a "lone avenger" bit leaving me strangely cold; but that's
possibly just me.</P>
<P>If this review sounds overly negative I'm not sure whether that is what I've
intended to convey.  The movie is a bitter, bitter, bitter pill, but it's
meant to be.  If you can stomach it it's certainly worth watching once.
There are even two or three scenes deliberately hilariously funny, like the
scene where the porn paraphernalia sales dude is seen reading some schmaltzy
novel under the cover of erotic literature in order not to "embarrass
yourself in front of your fellow perverts," or when he tells a guy,
mercifully off-screen, that "this place is like a gas station.  You pay
before you pump."  (There was also some rather shameless product placement
in that flick.  Now I want me one of'em battery operated vaginas!  Just
kidding.)</P>
<P>On a final note I can only say that if I'm naive and that flick was actually
a REALISITC depicition of the underground porn scene I prefer to remain
naive and ignorant, thankyouverymuch!  ("Whataworldwhataworldwhataworld..."
*Mutter, mutter, mutter!*)</P>
