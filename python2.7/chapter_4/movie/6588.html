<PRE>                             LIFE WITH FATHER
                       A film review by M Formlios
                        Copyright 1996 M Formlios</PRE>
<P>This is not a film to be looked at with any kind of modernist perspective.
It was made in another era, and it looks back at an era prior to that.
Whether or not you relate to it, there is much to be said about it still.</P>
<P>The character Clarence Day Sr., as played by William Powell, has a gruff,
pompous, hard to handle exterior countenance. For all of his blustering,
and all of the yelling that goes on within his household, they all
function together as a sort of family unit. This is not the Roseanne kind
of family love, but rather a solid bond of Victorian fellowship, that
careens through the film, veering from the ridiculous involving Clarence,
Jr's wearing his father's suits, to the kinds of male friendships that
Clarence Sr. bestows upon his sons. </P>
<P>Irene Dunne, as his wife, Vinnie, is a shrewd manipulator, but also
somewhat of an airhead. She loves him as much as he loves her, but she
really knows how to handle him. Due to the time period represented in this
film, New York in 1883, she cannot rise too far above the expected
feminine conventions of the day. She and he frequently argue points of
logic that neither one has a clue about. He tries as hard as he can to
defend himself against her wiles, but it is a no-win situation for him,
for when logic doesn't work for her, she resorts to forming her own kind
of logic to win him over.</P>
<P>Just as Buckwheat cannot be viewed anymore in a fashion relevant to the
present time period, it becomes necessary to discard all preconceptions as
to what should and should not be right, and to simply take the film at
face value. It doesn't matter that we no longer relate to it, it doesn't
even matter whether the New York and home environments created here
reflect actual living conditions, or were just a byproduct of the
Hollywood imagination. What does matter is that the film does entertain in
its own right.</P>
