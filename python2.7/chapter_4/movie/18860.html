<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>You just can't shake the `been there, done that' feeling while sitting
through director Simon West's ConAir follow-up.  It plays like a
second-rate version of Rob Reiner's multiple Oscar nominee A Few Good
Men, driving home the tired cliché that there are three ways to do
things – the right way, the wrong way and the Army way.  File this one
under Choice No. 2.</P>
<P>Based on the popular Nelson DeMille novel, Daughter takes place at Fort
MacCallum in Georgia.  Warrant Officers Paul Brenner (John Travolta, A
Civil Action) and Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe, Playing by Heart) are
assigned to investigate the murder of – you guessed it – the General's
daughter, Captain Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson, Flubber).  Her
naked body was found strangled, tied down and spread-eagle on the base
during evening maneuvers.</P>
<P>The General is "Fighting' Joe Campbell (James Cromwell, Babe), a
retiring leader with major political ambitions.  He needs to have the
murder case sewn up in 36 hours, before the Feds come in and leak the
story to the media, spoiling his shot to run on the next Republican
Presidential ticket.  Campbell actually utters the words `just find the
son of a bitch' to Brenner.  And he gets to rhetorically ask Brenner the
tried-and-true question of whether he is a soldier or a policeman.</P>
<P>Brenner and Sunhill's investigation leads them to a secret room in the
basement of the deceased Campbell's home, learning that she was quite
the sexual deviant in her spare time.  Confirmation of Campbell's
extra-curricular activities arrives via Colonels Kent (Timothy Hutton,
Playing God) and Moore (James Woods, Another Day in Paradise).  The
latter, Campbell's boss and mentor, is initially accused and arrested by
Brenner, but later freed in a fatal mistake.</P>
<P>Daughter is kept alive only by Travolta's electric performance and
occasionally saucy one-liners.  The shallow adaptation by debut
screenwriter Christopher Bertolini is a dud, despite being `punched up'
by veteran scribe William Goldman (Absolute Power).  Sadly, Goldman is
probably best know these days as the guy who annually writes the
scathing reviews of each Oscar-nominated film in Premiere magazine.
Goldman completely annihilated Saving Private Ryan this year, but then
turns around and gives us crap like this.  Thanks a lot, pal.  (1:58 - R
for graphic images relating to sexual violence including a strong rape
scene, some perverse sexuality, nudity and language)</P>
