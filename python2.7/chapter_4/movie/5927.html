<P>     APUR SANSAR concludes one of the greatest film series of all time, 
Satyajit Ray's APU TRILOGY, which chronicles the life of one Bengali boy 
as he traverses the road from childhood through adolescence to maturity.  
Ray, a masterfully accomplished director, is at the height of his powers 
with this film, one of the most equally wrenching, uplifting, and 
cathartic motion pictures I have experienced.  Following 1955's PATHER 
PANCHALI and 1956's APARAJITO, this 1959 feature provides the perfect 
culmination to an unforgettable saga.</P>
<P>     It's possible to review APUR SANSAR without mentioning the other 
films in the trilogy, because Ray has constructed this movie so that its 
full power can be felt by anyone  unfamiliar with what preceded it.  
Nevertheless, for those who accompanied the writer/director as he 
charted the emotional and spiritual odyssey of Apu's early life, APUR 
SANSAR provides a fitting final chapter.  Not only are we afforded the 
opportunity to observe the kind of man the protagonist has ultimately 
become, but we see how his cumulative experience coalesces to influence 
the most monumental decision of his life.</P>
<P>     APUR SANSAR is carefully divided into three acts.  In the first, we 
are introduced to the adult Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee), a struggling 
writer living in a Calcutta apartment during the 1930s.  Apu is alone in 
the world, having already lost his sister (PATHER PANCHALI) and father 
and mother (APARAJITO).  He's three months behind in his rent, so, to 
meet his landlord's demands, he is forced to sell some of his precious 
books.  Jobs are scarce, and Apu can't find one that suits him.  One 
day, his old school friend, Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee), arrives to invite 
him to a wedding in the village of Khulna.  Apu, who doesn't have 
anything else to do, agrees to come.  On the day of the marriage, 
however, the groom develops unexpected mental problems, and the bride, 
Aparna (Sharmila Tagore), is left alone and unmarried.  Her 
superstitious family believes that if a wedding does not take place at 
the appointed hour, she will be cursed forever.  To save her, Apu is 
recruited as a "substitute bridegroom."</P>
<P>     The second act, which has an almost-playful tone, details Apu and 
Aparna's married life -- how they initially come together as strangers 
then grow to love and understand one another.  In slightly more than 
thirty minutes, Ray brings to life an unforced, deeply moving romance.  
Apu and Aparna's gentle relationship is punctuated by bursts of pathos 
and comedy, but their union is so effectively crafted that it's easy for 
the viewer to lose him- or herself in the simple beauty of Ray's world.</P>
<P>     Alas, the happiness doesn't last forever.  The third, defining act 
of the film hinges on tragedy and its aftermath.  Aparna dies giving 
birth to a son, and a devastated Apu abandons his baby for a nomadic 
lifestyle filled with hopelessness and self-recrimination.  Only in the 
final scenes of APUR SANSAR is the protagonist offered an opportunity at 
redemption, and we aren't sure until the last shot whether or not he 
will accept it.</P>
<P>     The "tragic love story" is a timeless motion picture staple, but 
few, if any, express emotional truth with the simple, heartbreaking 
eloquence of APUR SANSAR.  Although the best stories of this sort (such 
as Richard Attenborough's SHADOWLANDS) typically have moments when they 
ring false, this movie is free of such missteps.  Ray's considerable 
skills as a film maker are at their pinnacle, and the result is 
unforgettable.</P>
<P>     The acting, as is usually the case in a Ray film, is of the highest 
caliber.  Soumitra Chatterjee, who was to become a "regular" in the 
director's films, gives a fine, multi-dimensional portrayal; it's easy 
to believe that he's the same Apu that we got to know in the other two 
films.  The void created by the absence of Karuna Bannerjee, who 
anchored both PATHER PANCHALI and APARJITO as Apu's mother, is filled by 
the exquisite Sharmila Tagore, who, like Chatterjee, would appear in 
future Ray films (as well as MISSISSIPPI MASALA).</P>
<P>     The greatness of the APU TRILOGY lies not only in its intimate 
understanding of the intricacies of human nature, but the artistry with 
which it expresses those truths.  Each of the films is filled with 
wondrous images, and watching Apu's life unfold is like gazing through a 
window into a rare and unique world.  And, even though the trilogy 
includes much tragedy, Ray gives birth to hope from each despair, and a 
measure of joy from every sadness.  After all, life is like that, and 
the APU TRILOGY reflects the universality of the human experience.  </P>
<P>     I saw APUR SANSAR in a full theater, and, after the end credits had 
rolled, everyone reluctantly rose from their seats to file towards the 
exit.  An unusual silence enveloped the crowd of 150.  There was no 
discussion or aimless chatter, just the quiet, communal introspection of 
a lingering experience.  I can think of no better illustration of this 
film's power and impact.  The APU TRILOGY is a true masterpiece, and 
APUR SANSAR is its crown jewel.</P>
