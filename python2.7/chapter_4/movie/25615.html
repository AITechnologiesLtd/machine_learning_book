<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Layin' Low" is a charming comedy set in the Brooklyn of the 1980s and
laden with plenty of colorful city types. Jerry (Piven) is an unemployed
twentysomething, living in his eccentric parent's Carroll Gardens
brownstone. He sleeps late and reads a lot while aspiring to be a
writer, but doesn't really know what to do in life, except he's going
bonkers and tells his best friend Christy (Hughes), that he needs to get
out of the house and get a place on his own. Christy is a born loser,
hanging around the OTB, pretending to be a winner. He resides on the
roof, where he invents a gizmo to catch pigeons, hoping to sell the meat
to Chinese restaurants.</P>
<P>When a friend (Schulze) of Jerry's asks him to help him move out of his
girlfriend's house, he obliges. The friend stops off at his local drug
dealer to score some grass, but while there two hit men rub out the drug
dealer while Jerry's friend steals the drug cache, but he is shot and
before Jerry can get him to the hospital, he dies. Jerry now has the
drugs, and is on the run from the cops and the gangsters.</P>
<P>Jerry confides in Christy about what went down and Christy offers to
make arrangements with the gangsters to get the drugs back. Christy gets
sidetracked from that duty, when he spots Jerry's new boarder, an
attractive single coed from Spain, Manuela (Alanna). Instead of meeting
the gangsters in front of the OTB as arranged, he takes Manuela on a
tour of the neighborhood, treating her to Good Humor ice cream and
pizza, giving her enough junk-food until she pukes.</P>
<P>Jerry, fearful of staying in his house, has Christy arrange for him to
stay with his cousin Angie (Edie). After some hostility is shown against
Jerry by Angie, because she catches Christy in a lie about why Jerry is
here, the two strike up a romance. Edie is, of all things, a philosophy
professor at Hunter College, which brings about a funny scene, as Jerry
sneaks into her class and she's teaching Kant with a sharp Brooklyn
accent.</P>
<P>The film ends in tragedy, but somehow the film never draws us into that
emotional-caring response. All the scenes were played for comedy and a
study of Jerry's career dilemma --
as he is someone who is beguilingly meant to be born, bred, and dead in
Brooklyn.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast does a nice job in sketching city life for a bunch of
idlers. It is pure Brooklynese in attitude and atmosphere, depicting
life that revolves around dreams of hitting the Exacta, scoring in
drugs, getting a job, hanging out in a Greek diner, and playing
stickball in the street. It's a sweet, little mellow story, with a lot
of laughs in it, and with some violent scenes which never seemed real,
more like play-acting. There was good chemistry among the stars,
especially the relationship Jerry has with both Christy and Angie.</P>
