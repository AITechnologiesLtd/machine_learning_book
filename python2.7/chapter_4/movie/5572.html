<P>     With apologies to John Landis, a better title might have been AN
AMERICAN VIRGIN IN TUSCANY.  This exquisitely shot soft-core romp
through the Italian countryside stars Liv Tyler (EMPIRE) as a 19-
year-old American whose stay at a sculptor's hillside home-- for the
purposes of having her portrait made and losing her virginity, and not
necessarily in that order-- causes all the men around her to act like
dogs in heat.  They sniff, growl at, and circle their bitches for two
very long hours.  Ms. Tyler, the current queen of the ingenues, projects
an innocence that would be rather sweet to behold if the director,
Bernardo Bertolucci (LITTLE BUDDA, LAST TANGO IN PARIS), didn't have so
much sex on his mind.</P>
<P>     When a dying playwright (Jeremy Irons) meets Lucy, he immediately
begins babbling about the importance of the dirty deed.  At this point,
a certain absurdity creeps into the movie that never leaves, and which
prevents the semi-serious story from breathing without heaving.  The
whole thing is over-sexed.  My favorite:  the strange symbolism of Liv
vomiting into a man's crotch!  And what about all those
below-the-hemline camera angles?!  (To be fair, the story isn't entirely
perverted:  Lucy is also trying to solve the mystery of who bopped her
mom, many years ago on that same hillside.) Bathed in the relaxed amber
tones of cinematographer Darius Khondji (SEVEN, THE CITY OF LOST
CHILDREN), STEALING BEAUTY certainly has the best scenery of any summer
movie.  Too bad that those below- the-belt stirrings have more to do
with a lack of blood flow to the buttocks than anything else.  </P>
