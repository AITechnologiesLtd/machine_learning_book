<PRE>.                              THE TRUMAN SHOW
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Jim Carrey's finest hour?  I don't know... I guess if you go for this
sort of thing.</P>
<P>     It's been four years since Tom Hanks played Everyman in FORREST GUMP,
so I suppose the world was ripe for a repeat.  You really can't go wrong
with these Man-against-the-world/triumph-in-the-face-of-overwhelming-odds
films, and done right they can have incredible appeal.</P>
<P>     Thankfully, THE TRUMAN SHOW is done right, mostly.  In case you live
under a rock, you know that this is the story of a man (Carrey) who slowly
discovers his life is a sham, a cradle-to-grave story that's been televised
to the world for 30 years.</P>
<P>     The melodrama factor is high, both on the show and behind the scenes. 
>From Truman's saccharine wife (Linney) to the overbearing director of the
show, Christof (Harris), everyone in the film is a walking cliché.  Part of
this is by design--these are actors playing actors playing real people--but
part of it is a crutch that, in the end, weakens the film.  *Every one* of
the supporting characters is wasted to some degree--it's especially visible
with McElhone's character, an extra that Truman falls in love with against
Christof's master plan.</P>
<P>     It's scenarios like this that give THE TRUMAN SHOW its real weight: The
"what would happen if..." developments that, of course, culminates with,
"What would happen if Truman tried to escape?"  That's where the drama is,
and that's what makes THE TRUMAN SHOW compelling.</P>
<P>     For what it's worth, Carrey's in fine form, but if you're looking for
LIAR, LIAR antics you will be sorely disappointed.  Director Weir has
obviously kept him on a short leash, and while Carrey's improvised scenes
can be spotted here and there, the broad comedy is kept to a bare minimum.</P>
<P>     I can't help but think that with a little more thought to the
supporting characters, THE TRUMAN SHOW would have been a classic.  As it
stands, it's still good, but it just doesn't live up to its own hype.</P>
