<P>Terrifyingly, amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror,
this movie classic graces us with one of director Stanley Kubrick's
sporatic directing gigs, only 5 years after his last acclaimed feature,
BARRY LYNDON, and 10 before his timely masterpiece CLOCKWORK ORANGE
(9/10). This movie is based on author Stephen King's best-selling novel
of the same name, and stars the always-interesting Jack Nicholson.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A nice man, his wife and young boy, take on the task of overlooking a
winter resort during its off season. The nice man is there for peace
and quiet, as his profession as a writer requires just that. The boy
has a special skill called "the shine" which allows him to hear and see
things that others cannot. As their time in the grand hotel ticks away,
the mansion begins to exude thoughts of the past and chills of the
present. In time, the nice man transforms into a "not-so-nice" man, and
begins to terrify his own flesh and blood.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all
the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision
of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror
flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye
for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of
dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies
like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not
only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate
the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things
for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting
with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate
winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself,
as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this
idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like
the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the
circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to
wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This
film is a perfect example of this very thought.</P>
<P>And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the
clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty
hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's
fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed
editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements,
that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but
coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book
upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I
am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I
have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been
cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed
directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent
criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie
captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in
with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs
you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone
overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Jack Nicholson has been recorded as having really "lost it" during
several filming scenes of this movie, as Kubrick's meticulously
over-precise filming manner, apparently led to many takes (he demanded
127 takes from Shelley Duvall in one particular scene) and plenty of
mind games. Jack apparently had to be physically restrained after one
particularly famous scene, in which he was chopping into a door with an
axe. Nicholson apparently ad-libbed the now-infamous line "Here's
Johnny!" 
Jack Nicholson has also been quoted as saying about Kubrick: ""He gives
a new meaning to the word meticulous". Kubrick apparently had Nicholson
do fifty takes of a scene where he "simply" walks across the street.
Author Stephen King was known to have disliked Kubrick's version of his
novel, to the point where he himself decided to write a 6-hour
made-for-TV version of it in 1997, starring Stephen Webber, of TV's
"Wings" sitcom. King was never allowed to publicly denounce Kubrick's
interpretation of his work, due to contractual clauses, but his version
didn't fare much better with critics either.
During the making of this movie, director Kubrick was known to have
called author Stephen King up at 3am and ask him questions like "Do you
believe in God?"
Background on film: Stanley Kubrick had a large stack of books that he
was looking through to find a movie project. For a couple of hours, his
secretary could hear him pick up a book, read it for about a minute,
and then hurl it into the wall. She then noticed that this hadn't
happened in a while, so she went in to check on him, and found him
reading Stephen King's "The Shining". King says that this is really
strange, because the start of the book is very slow, and doesn't have
much to do with the rest of the story.

<A HREF="http://www.nh.ultranet.com/~mcollier/kubrick.html">http://www.nh.ultranet.com/~mcollier/kubrick.html</A> The many writers on
TV's "The Simpsons" apparently follow and admire many of Mr. Kubrick
greatest cinematic works.

Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon, which was used for the exterior
shots of this film (but not the interiors, which were all specially
built), doesn't actually have the infamous "Room 237" from the movie,
as the lodge owners' specifically requested the number 217 used in the
book be changed to a nonexistent room number.</P>
