A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<P>Directed by: Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook</P>
<P>Written by: 
Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, Rita Hsiao, Christopher Sanders, Philip
LaZebnik, Raymond Singer, and Robert D. San Souci (story), based on the
classic Chinese folk tale.</P>
<P>Starring the voices of: 
Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Soon-Tek Oh, and Pat Morita</P>
<PRE>Singing voices:
Lea Salonga, Donny Osmond</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
Rumored to be about a true person, the story of MULAN has circulated in
oral tradition for over a thousand years, and has inspired operas,
literature, and even coinage. (Since 1984, China has been issuing annual
gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures; the
1992 set includes Mulan.)</P>
<P>In THE BALLAD OF MULAN (written in the 5th or 6th Century), an imperial
edict by the Khan (Emperor) orders men from each family to be drafted
into the army to defend China. A girl's parents hear sighing, and think
that their daughter Mulan (the name means Magnolia) is dreaming of boys,
but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm
father if he were to be drafted off to battle. Mulan bravely runs away,
masquerading as a boy, to serve in the army instead of her father. Ten
thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later, the army finally
returns in triumph. The Emperor wants to reward Mulan's valor with a
prestigious position in government, but she declines, accepts a horse,
and returns home quietly to don her true clothes. Mulan's old army
buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that
Mulan is actually a woman.</P>
<P>The Disney animated feature MULAN is similar to the BALLAD story, only
it adds a modern character for comic relief: Mushu the dragon (Eddie
Murphy). </P>
<P>In Disney's MULAN, when a fierce army of invading Huns threatens to
overrun peaceful China the Emperor orders one man from each family to be
conscripted into the army. Old Mr. Fa (Soon-Tek Oh) is handicapped and
has no son; he has only his spirited young daughter Mulan (Ming-Na Wen).
Fearing for her father's life, the courageous Mulan secretly cuts her
hair, disguises herself as a man, and sneaks off to serve in the army in
her father's stead.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Mushu, the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the Fa
family, has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of
incense burner. (His only duty is to ring a gong.) Mushu hits upon a
plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the
disguised Mulan to become a macho male warrior hero. </P>
<P>With the help of Mushu, a horse, and a lucky cricket, can army recruit
Mulan save China and bring honor to the Fa family?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
East meets West. I know a chef in Santa Fe that does this sort of magic;
he combines Asian culinary influences from the West Coast with Latin
American from down south and European from the Atlantic to concoct new
creations that hit just the right combination of flavors. From their
state of the art animation studio in Orlando, Disney is hoping to work
the same kind of East/West magic with MULAN. </P>
<P>I mean, what would you say if I told you that a new movie featured Tang
Dynasty art, with Donny Osmond singing, Ming-Na Wen acting, and Eddie
Murphy playing a Chinese dragon that makes pop references to BATMAN and
the Reverend Jessie Jackson? Yet this is the case in the Disney's
re-interpretation of the familiar Chinese classic. The end result is
spectacular; MULAN is one of Disney's best movies ever. </P>
<P>Personally, I'm also glad to see the detestable American stereotype of
the weak-willed subservient Asian woman take a beating: Mulan is
portrayed as a normal, if spirited, compassionate gal capable of taking
the initiative.  </P>
<P>MULAN is more than just Eastern graphics and faces combined with
Westernized pop and Disney. Kids of any age will like the family themes,
and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing. And adolescent
and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor, while the boys
admire the battles. And adults can admire those male/female nuances as
well as the interplay between traditional notions of family, honor, and
duty with industrial age notions of romantic love, gumption, and
questioning. But even the tiniest details reveal quality. The movie's
art supervisors spent three weeks in China researching the right look:
negative spaces, positive detail, period clothing, and graphic designs
typical of the time and place. Computers were used for crowd scenes of
up to 30,000 people, and a special program called 'Attila' was used for
a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking Huns on horseback. And
singers Osmond and Salonga are at the top of their game.</P>
<P>Balance is crucial. A movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by
Eddie Murphy might not be Disney's cup of tea, but if you use the
character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited
heroine, then, Pow! The Dream Team. By the same token, a tale about a
girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself,
but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism
for a light hearted Disney romp. It's rare that a movie can seamlessly
combine elements from both East and West, old and young, male and female
into a cohesive and entertaining whole, but MULAN hits the universal
bullseye. It's movie for any age, creed, gender, or color. </P>
