<P>David O. Russell is a man to be reckoned with. He starts his career off with
a "comedy" about incest between a mom and son called SPANKING THE MONKEY.
Follows it up with yet another very original story packed with a slew of
interesting and quirky characters called FLIRTING WITH DISASTER (8.5/10).
And now this film, which at least one critic (Roger Ebert) has called a
"masterpiece".</P>
<P>PLOT:
Operation Desert Storm has just ended. Now, four military men find a map
leading to the gold stolen by Saddam Hussein in a prisoner's ass, and decide
to take it upon themselves to find the stash and retire in wealth upon their
return home. But what do you know...things are never that simple.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is like no other "war film" that I have ever seen. Sure, it does
actually take place after the war, and isn't necessarily based on action or
heavy machine gun shootouts, but you can still consider it a war movie
considering the goings-on in the film. It's got a style, a feel, a unique
look, unlike any of those other murky combat flicks. Could it be the fact
that it actually toys with comedy as much as it does drama?
Perhaps...although I personally found some of the humor to be misplaced in a
film with so many disturbing images. Having said that, this film is no
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (8/10) in that regard either, it actually presents us
with various original scenarios featuring gun fights which I have never
encountered before in any film. Very interesting to watch. It also decided
to show us, in graphic detail, what a bullet does to someone after it enters
their body. Kind of icky to see, but interesting nonetheless.</P>
<P>That aside, this film basically offers us a unique war perspective with some
decent action scenes, a creative style, some good humor, a spic-and-span
ending, but not much more than that. The acting performances were also very
good, with George Clooney really coming into his own with this picture.
Wahlberg also comes through, despite another gratuitous shot of him running
around without his top (Who am I kidding, if I had half the six-pack that
bastard's got stacked, I'd be going to work without my shirt every day!).
Even Ice Cube and Spike Jonze (That's right, the music video director!) got
into the act with some pretty effective scenarios. The film as a whole
worked for me because I was never bored while watching it, enjoyed its
creative take on many Hollywood staple scenes, and was even a little touched
here and there. Not a great film, but certainly one worthy of earning your
hard-earned cash in the local movie houses.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director David O. Russell has written and directed his first three pictures
all by himself, although this one has a "story" credit to John Ridley, the
man who wrote the novel "Stray Dogs", upon which Oliver Stone's U-TURN was
filmed. Russell got his first picture made when he was in his mid-thirties,
and apparently spent 18 months exhaustively researching the Gulf War and its
aftermath before writing this movie.
Director/actor Spike Jonze's real name is Adam Spiegel. He recently married
famed director Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sofia. His only two other
"acting" performances before this movie were as a "Airbag EMT Beltran" in
1997's THE GAME and as a "teenage drug customer" in 1993's MI VIDA LOCA (No,
not the Ricky Martin music video!). He's best known for having directed many
unique music videos such as "Sabotage" by the Beastie Boys, "Buddy Holly"
from Weezer, "Da Funk" by Daft Punk and "Praise Me" by Fatboy Slim. And yes,
that is him dancing around like an idiot dance teacher in the video. He will
be making his directorial debut in this fall's BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.
Rumors were floating around when this picture opened about the use of an
actual cadaver during the "let's show the bullet inside one's body" scene.
It turned out to be a completely unfounded rumor, since no dead body would
ever be used for such an unnecessary exercise.
George Clooney is the nephew of singer Rosemary Clooney and the cousin of
actor Miguel Ferrer. George's middle name is Timothy. He says he will never
get married, nor have any children, but Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman
have bet $10,000 each that he will be a father before he turns 40 (2001).
Ironically, Clooney's first role was in a 1984 TV series called "E/R", and
ten years later, he returned to TV drama with another small hit called "ER".
Ice Cube, real name O'Shea Jackson, started rapping when he was 14 in South
Central Los Angeles, where he pushed his notion of gangsta rap, a genre he
virtually invented and defined with his old group N.W.A., to new levels.
Actor Mark Wahlberg will also co-star alongside George Clooney in his next
picture called THE PERFECT STORM, and have George as a producer on his next
project after that.
This film was shot in three places: El Centro, California, three weeks among
deserts and sand dunes; Mexicali, Mexico, its unobstructed landscape served
as the backdrop for the film's opening sequence; and Casa Grande, Arizona.
This film was originally titled THE SPOILS OF WAR.</P>
