<P>Just before a battle scene early in "Gladiator," General Maximus
(Russell Crowe) turns to his second in command and says "At my signal,
unleash hell." The moment is significant for two reasons. First, because
Crowe delivers the sentence perfectly – as an instruction, not a movie
tagline (imagine how the command would have sounded in an old Clint
Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger flick). Second, because when Maximus
finally gives the signal, his troops really do unleash hell, a horrific,
mesmerizing explosion of fire, blood and fury.</P>
<P>Directed by Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner," "Alien," "Thelma and Louise"),
"Gladiator" is the first film since the '60s to visit the swords, sweat,
decadence and deliverance of the Roman Empire. In the heyday of the
genre, the films could be divided into two camps: low budget, cheesy,
overstuffed action epics with wooden acting and strong homoerotic
subtexts, and expensive, cheesy, pretentious Judeo-Christian action
epics with hammy acting and slightly more subtle homoerotic subtexts.
Scott's film successfully navigates around these traits (not that
there's anything wrong with a juicy homoerotic subtext). He presents his
tale in a direct, no-nonsense fashion, with uniformly excellent acting
and, thankfully, no laborious speeches.</P>
<P>For a Roman epic, the story is easy to follow. (SPOILER ALERT: PLOT
POINTS FOLLOW) General Maximus is a humble Spaniard who has never even
seen Rome. His only goal is to finish his service to the emperor so he
can return home to his wife and son. But after the aforementioned
battle, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) asks Maximus to be his
successor. The aging leader can't turn over the empire to his children.
While his daughter Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) would "make a fine Caesar,"
women are forbidden to rule, and Aurelius fears that his reckless son
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) would abuse the power of the throne.</P>
<P>His concern is well placed. When Commodus learns of his father's plans,
he murders the Emperor and orders the deaths of Maximus and his
family.     Maximus escapes his would-be assassins, but arrives home too
late to save his wife and son. The grieving General is captured and made
a slave, landing in a North African outpost where ex-gladiator Proximo
(Oliver Reed) runs a training camp. Eventually, Maximus ends up in the
Colosseum of Rome, fighting for his life while the sneering Commodus
gazes down from the good seats. Maximus, anonymous behind his warrior
helmet, has a new task – to somehow avenge the murders of his loved ones
and insure that the wishes of his commander are finally carried out (END
SPOILER ALERT).</P>
<P>It's a familiar plotline ("Rob Roy" and "Braveheart" covered the same
turf), but Ridley Scott has a knack for taking a simple story and
turning it into something special. "Gladiator" dazzles because of
stellar acting, thrilling action scenes and spectacular imagery.</P>
<P>Russell Crowe heads the fine cast with yet another flawless performance.
Fresh from dual triumphs in "L.A. Confidential" and "The Insider," he is
positively searing as Maximus, using his amazing physicality to turn an
icon into a man. Crowe is the grounding force of the movie – we believe
because he makes us believe.</P>
<P>In his best work to date, Joaquin Phoenix is riveting as the wicked
Commodus. Playing an effete character with balls is no easy task, but
Phoenix pulls it off grandly. Although they receive limited screen time,
Connie Nielsen makes quite an impression as the regal Lucilla and Djimon
Hounson is memorable as the warrior Juba.</P>
<P>"Gladiator" also gives us the chance to see two seasoned veterans strut
their stuff. With wispy white hair and a deeply creased face, Richard
Harris simultaneously projects corporeal frailty and strength of spirit
as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. In his final role, Oliver Reed steals scenes
with gusto as the jaded entrepreneur Proximo. Incidentally, the press
kit for the film states "Sadly, Oliver Reed passed away in Malta on May
2, 1999, near the end of filming his role in 'Gladiator.'" Is it just
me, or does the use of the word "near" seem ill chosen?</P>
<P>The art direction in "Gladiator" is as impressive as the cast. Deftly
combining elaborate sets with computer graphics, Scott and company
present ancient Rome, from the streets of the city to the magnificent
Colosseum, with incredible verisimilitude. An aerial shot gliding up and
over the massive Colosseum is particularly breathtaking. For me, though,
the most memorable image was that of Maximus' hand gently sweeping over
stalks of grain, which speaks well of the artistry of Ridley Scott.</P>
<P>Still, I have a few quibbles with the film. The numerous battle scenes
are extremely robust, consistently exciting and inventively staged, but
Scott's frequent use of jump cuts makes the action hard to follow. And
while the swordplay is quite impressive, it can't hold a candle to the
phenomenal mano a mano sword fight at the end of "Rob Roy," where you
can actually feel the imposing weight of the weapons.</P>
<P>Finally, there's a question of thematic depth. Maximus battles not to
end the tyranny of slavery or to stop the barbaric games where men are
killed as entertainment for the masses, but to avenge his family and be
true to his fallen sovereign. His cause is personal – a bit too personal
for a story of such grand scale. As a result, I found myself admiring
"Gladiator" instead of being engulfed by it. Still, my admiration is
quite strong for this gorgeous, savage, terrifically acted film. Ridley
Scott may not have created the perfect epic, but he came awfully close.</P>
