<P>Directed by Spike Lee, from his screenplay. Starring Damon Wayans, Savion

<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Some of the best -- and undeniably most provocative -- movies of the past 
half-century have studied the problem of racism. In American cinema, most 
(though, certainly, not all) of these works have dealt with prejudice 
against the black community, and one of the most successful purveyors of 
these films has been Spike Lee. "Bamboozled" is Lee's newest treatise on 
the subject, and this time around he has pushed the envelope one step 
further by examining bigotry toward African Americans not just from white 
people, but from black individuals as well. And in concert with this, Lee 
looks at the way people respond to what they see on television -- how the
medium itself can help what was once controversial, and even obscene, 
become an easily-accepted part of our culture.</P>
<P>Lee's key character is Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), a black 
programming executive for a fictitious American network. Lee clearly sets 
up Pierre to be a person who, if he is not ashamed of his race, at least 
has set himself apart from it. Not only has he changed his name to make it 
sound upper-crust and distinctly non-black, but he speaks in such a 
bizarre, affected accent that even his own father questions him about it. 
With their ratings floundering, Pierre is charged by his boss (Michael 
Rapaport) with coming up with a new show to appeal to the underserved 
black population -- something which veers away from the formula ensconced 
by "The Cosby Show" and its imitators. (One of the questions Lee poses is 
why all black-centered programmes are sitcoms. This isn't strictly true -- 
"New York Undercover", from "Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf, was a 
moderate success on FOX in the mid-Nineties and featured a mostly black 
and Hispanic cast -- but Lee's point is valid all the same.)</P>
<P>In response, Delacroix invents a show designed to thrust the topic of 
racism back in the public spotlight by indulging in that very thing. 
Christening it "Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show", Delacroix 
envisions it as a modern update on the black exploitation vehicle of the 
mid-nineteenth century. He recruits two street performers, Manray (Savion 
Glover) and Womack (Tommy Davidson) to star in the programme: Manray will 
play the eponymous Mantan while Womack portrays his pal, Sleep 'n Eat. 
Amongst the supporting cast are such offensively named characters as 
Honeycutt and Aunt Jemima. And the racist ingredients don't end there: 
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat live on a watermelon plantation, are lazy and out 
of work, steal chickens, and generally indulge in every stereotype 
imaginable. Even more obscenely, all the actors in "Mantan" wear blackface
(Delacroix insists Manray and Womack make their own make-up, just like 
their forebears did a century and a half earlier). And yet, despite the 
show's heinous content, "Mantan" quickly becomes a nationwide hit, a 
success which presages serious ramifications for all those involved.</P>
<P>"Bamboozled" starts off very well. The audacity of Delacroix's idea is 
both frightening and compelling, and the burgeoning success of "Mantan", 
flying in the face of all common sense, is at once fascinating and 
horrifying. Within weeks, the concept of actors wearing blackface changes 
from an appalling taboo to a national craze -- amongst all demographics -- 
demonstrating the effect television can have even on our deepest-held 
beliefs. The implication is that if something is on TV then it's okay, no 
matter how bigoted it might really be. And this laissez-faire attitude
toward racial injustice applies not just to white viewers but black 
viewers as well, who seem heedless of the fact that the racism is 
targetted directly at them.</P>
<P>At the same time, Lee draws an intriguing parallel between the minstrel 
shows and the modern-day "gangsta rap" scene. One of the instrumental 
figures in "Bamboozled", played by Mos Def, is the brother of Delacroix's 
assistant Sloan (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the leader of an aggressive band 
called the Mau Maus. Lee's assertion is that bands like the Mau Maus do 
not tout African American rights but instead simply reinforce every 
negative black stereotype prevalent today: that they're violent, thieving, 
sex-crazed, hostile to everyone who isn't African American. In this way, 
suggests Lee, gangsta rap and related musical genres are scarcely 
different from the old minstrel shows. The trappings might be different, 
but the effect on public perception is the same.</P>
<P>It is the collision of "Mantan" and the Mau Maus that forms the climax to 
"Bamboozled". But unfortunately, this is also where the film runs out of 
steam. Having established such a thought-provoking premise, having posed 
so many intriguing and worthwhile queries, Lee ends up tossing it all 
aside in favour of a predictable, monotonous and gratuitous finale which 
hardly matches the invention of the movie's first hour. Instead of 
approaching his themes like a master workman, Lee takes a sledgehammer to 
them. At this stage, "Bamboozled" also loses sight of its characters and 
instead resorts to tedious, melodramatic shenanigans. Particularly 
ill-served is Pinkett Smith, whose astute characterisation in the first 
reel steadily deteriorates as the film winds on.</P>
<P>And this is disappointing, because it wastes both a great concept and some 
fine acting. Wayans is magnetic as the maladroit Delacroix, a unique 
character who manages to be intriguing and repugnant at the same time. 
Rapaport is very funny as Delacroix's boss, Dunwitty, a man who believes 
himself to be so in touch with African American culture that he tells 
Delacroix, "I'm blacker than you are," and yet thinks nothing of spouting 
a racially-motivated slur at his underling.</P>
<P>Lee is clearly trying to bring some great ideas to the fore here, and is 
on the verge of making a truly memorable film about racism; that the 
picture fails so badly in the end does not diminish this potential. If 
nothing else, this movie demonstrates that Lee has by no means run out of 
steam when it comes to this subject. But "Bamboozled", sadly, will go down 
as a lesser entry in the director's filmography.</P>
