<P>     At times reminiscent of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS, Krzysztof 
Kieslowski's DECALOGUE, and Jim Jarmusch's MYSTERY TRAIN, Pierre 
Grange's debut feature, MAYDAY, is a bold stroke of narrative structure 
and complexity.  In presenting his views of modern life in France, 
Grange uses an unconventional multi-episodic storyline where characters 
and events criss-cross through segments other than those which focus 
specifically on them. </P>
<P>     The time is 7:48 on a Sunday evening in May.  It's election day, 
and the polls will close in twelve minutes.  At that point, French 
television will announce the fifth president of the fifth republic.  
MAYDAY tells eight separate-yet-connected stories about the lives of 
those who dwell in different apartments of the same building during the 
time leading up to the momentous announcement.  The walls are thin and 
sounds carry, whether they're the cries of a child, the moans of a 
couple making love, the roar of a motorcycle being started, the blaring 
noise of a radio or phonograph, or the unmistakable crack of a gunshot.</P>
<P>     The first characters we meet are a pair of abstentionists who 
quarrel about their unborn child and their inability to get to the 
poles.  Next is a wedding reception that is violently interrupted.  
There's a husband who ignores his wife, then dresses up as an opera diva 
when she storms out of the apartment.  The man next store welcomes this 
young wife and agrees to help with her unorthodox plan to make her 
husband jealous.  At an election party, the resolution of a father/son 
conflict involves alcohol, drugs, and guns.  Elsewhere, a man, woman, 
and child enjoy what starts out as a pleasant domestic moment before 
ending tragically.  Meanwhile, a couple in their twilight years reflect 
on everything that's transpiring around them as the hands on the clock 
approach 8:00.</P>
<P>     Grange's handling of so many interconnecting stories is nothing 
short of masterful.  Using the noises of the apartment building as audio 
cues, he not only aligns the time frame in all the episodes, but 
intrigues the audience about the reasons behind each repeated sound.  
Who is making love?  Why is a motorcycle being started inside the 
building?  And, with the potential for violence ripe in so many 
segments, who is firing a gun?  </P>
<P>     A wide variety of actors were used in significant parts.  While all 
are professionals, some are better known than others.  Jean-Claude 
Dreyfus (DELICATESSEN) and Kristin Scott-Thomas (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A 
FUNERAL) have roles, and MAYDAY marks the final on-screen appearance of 
the late Benoit Regent (BLUE).   Different ethnicities are represented, 
although not different social classes -- everyone here is part of 
France's lower economic strata. </P>
<P>     MAYDAY serves as a social and (to a lesser degree) political 
commentary.  Shot in The Glycines, an apartment complex that was 
designed as a utopian setting in the '60s, this movie shows how 
fragmented and self-absorbed people have become over the decades.  The 
realities of human existence have replaced idealism. MAYDAY has its 
share of comic moments, but a sense of futility and tragedy underscores 
nearly every story.  And, although the film's most obvious aspect is its 
brilliant, meticulous plotting, Grange has made certain that the film's 
suspense doesn't eclipse its message.</P>
