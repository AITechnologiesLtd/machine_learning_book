<PRE>Breakfast at Tiffany's (NR) *** 1/2
Starring Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard
Directed by Blake Edwards
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Ah, Audrey Hepburn, one of the cinema's greatest stars, she's never been
shining brighter than here. Holly Golighty (Hepburn) is an eccentric woman who
lives in an apartment building where she annoys Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) by
pushing his buzzer when she loses her key. </P>
<P>Moving in upstairs is Paul Varjak (Peppard) whom Holly instantly begins to call
Fred (as he looks somewhat like her beloved brother.) Paul is not sweet and
innocent, he's having an affair with 2-E (Patricia Neal) and wants to end it
because he's falling in love.</P>
<P>Every great romantic moment after 1961 in the movies had to take at least one
or two things from Breakfast at Tiffany's. Whether it be modern classics like
Notting Hill and My Best Friend's Wedding or older hits. But the movie oozes so
much cuteness (almost as if you were walking into a Sanrio store) that there's
no way you can resist it. Now I always like to make my reviews for the classics
short enough so that no one gets mad at me and says, "Why did you diss my
favorite movie of all time? What is wrong with you?" I simply can't go on
enough on how much I loved this movie, it's a fun romantic classic. Go to an
older video store, go and rent it now.</P>
