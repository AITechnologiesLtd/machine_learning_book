Hard Rain (R) ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In an apparent response to the lukewarm reaction to Hollywood's last two
disaster epics, the dueling volcano movies Dante's Peak and Volcano, the
makers of Hard Rain (formerly known as The Flood) have tweaked the usual
disaster formula a bit, melding traditional disaster elements with more
slam-bang action.  While the resulting film is never boring and
entertaining on a superficial level, in the end it remains an uneven mix of
both worlds.</P>
<P>Writer Graham Yost, best known for his script for Speed, fashions Hard
Rain with a similarly thin storyline.  A group of thieves, led by a shady
character known only as Jim (Morgan Freeman) attempt to rob an armored car
carrying $3 million.  Two things stand in their way--biggest of all, Mother
Nature, which has flooded the town of Huntingsburg, Indiana with the mother
of all downpours; and Tom (Christian Slater), the armored car's driver, who
manages to hide the cash before anyone can take it.  With the help of the
town sheriff (Randy Quaid) and church artist Karen (Minnie Driver), Tom
aims to protect the carefully hidden fortune while braving the elements.</P>
<P>Speed was able to overcome its simple plot--madman extorts money from the
city with a bomb on a bus--with crack direction by Jan DeBont and the
personalities created by stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and, most
notably, Sandra Bullock.  Hard Rain's shortcomings do not lie with director
Mikael Salomon, a former cinematographer.  Salomon stages the gunfights and
boat chases with some skill (though no one but John Woo should even attempt
to pull off a church shootout), and uses the waterlogged setting to create
some striking shots.  He also has a sure hand with the water effects, which
give the gushing torrents of water an appropriate air of menace.  One of
the main shortcomings, however, lie with the characters, who, as in too
many disaster films, are poorly defined and/or uninteresting.  Tom is a
cardboard do-gooder, and despite the best efforts of the always-engaging
Driver, Karen is little more than a token action film female.  A couple of
late-inning twists muddy the personalities of the sheriff and especially
Jim; by film's end I was not exactly sure what the audience is supposed to
make of him.</P>
<P>What causes the most damage to Hard Rain is the inclusion of cheesy
disaster movie conventions.  It would have been fine if the flood were used
as a backdrop to the action storyline, the water serving as an ominous
threat looming over the events.  But in keeping with a typical disaster
film's varied "pastiche" of characters, he shoehorns in a grating,
unhappily married old couple (Richard Dysart and Betty White), who linger
in the background and become briefly involved in the action before
virtually (and mercifully) disappearing during the final act.  We also get
served up one of those interminable melodramatic, would-be heart-tugging
death scenes, this one occurring after a character gets electrocuted.</P>
<P>After all is said and done, Hard Rain is a somewhat diverting popcorn
flick that holds one's interest for its fairly brief running time.  It's
just that I cannot help but think that maybe the film would have been
better off being either a disaster film _or_ an action film instead of the
uneven blend that plays out onscreen.</P>
