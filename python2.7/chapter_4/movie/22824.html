<P>No one seems to want their name displayed on the new sci-fi thriller
`Supernova'. Action director Walter Hill (`48 Hours') demanded his name
be replaced by the pseudonym Thomas Lee (a new version of the infamous
Alan Smithee). His request was granted. It is also rumored that the
legendary Francis Ford Coppola stepped in after Hill retreated to finish
editing the film for release. Not surprisingly, his name is also nowhere
to be found. A poisonous black cloud of negative buzz surrounded this
notoriously troubled production from the start. But is it really as
terrible as you've been told?</P>
<P>Hell yes. `Supernova' is a lifelessly dull, derivative mess of a film.
The action sequences contain no excitement whatsoever. The scenes
intended to build a suspenseful atmosphere don't even begin to raise the
heart-rate. The movie is like a drugged-up race horse that doesn't even
make it out of the gate - the drugs being the endless post-production
tampering that occurred to make the film most presentable. I imagine
stars like James Spader and Angela Bassett, who have something of a
Hollywood image and are trying to maintain it, are really sweating it
because `Supernova' was actually released. You see, January is the
`aww-heck-let's release-it-now' month. Movies are dumped here with the
mild hope of a warm box office reception because the competition would
be too ferocious elsewhere. In essence, `Supernova' is the definitive
January release. In the heart of winter comes a movie that will really
send a chill up your spine (and not in a positive sense).</P>
<P>`Supernova' follows Emergency Medical Rescue Vessel `Nightingale', and
all of the crew who dwell within. Captain Marley (Robert Forster) enjoys
researching the history of cartoons (and that is the extent of his
character). Dr. Kaela Evers (Bassett) is the chief medical officer, who
says `S.T.A.T.!!' a lot. The remainder of the crew includes engineer
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) and two horny technicians (Lou Diamond
Phillips and Robin Tunney), who enjoy fooling around in zero gravity.
Sex seems to be the most amusing way to pass the time on the
`Nightingale', because it occupies a distressing majority of William
Malone's predictable rip-off of a screenplay. Or perhaps calling the
film a `rip-off' would be conceding too much credit. The film mixes
elements of `Alien', `Sphere' and `Event Horizon' - but nary a clever
twist is made.</P>
<P>Anyhoo, the ship intercepts a distress signal sent from a nearby moon
where a mining expedition is in progress. Unfortunately, Captain
Marley's brain implodes during a botched dimension jump, and recovering
drug-addict Nick Vanzant (Spader) takes command. To make a long story
short, they pick up a space scavenger (Peter Facinelli) who is
transporting a glowing orb of Jell-O mold, and everyone is violently
killed off until only Nick and Kaela remain. Any details of the plot are
rendered incomprehensible, and the movie slips into an intergalactic
coma from here on in. The climactic effect is true boredom once you
realize how little `Supernova' has to offer. All there is for
entertainment value is a few periodic flashes of colorful special
effects.... some of which are eye catching, but most are
straight-to-video quality. In short, the whole experience is depressing.</P>
<P>It's hard to say if there was ever the slightest hint of promise behind
the production of `Supernova'. If there ever was, that promise was
obviously suffocated in a plastic wrap of post-production tampering.
Several scenes from the trailer have disappeared without a trace, and
virtually every loose-end is left unattended. Tack on an anticlimactic
finale, and you have a science-fiction film with no thrills, no laughs
and (in return) no foreseeable audience. You might be curious to see how
perpetually bad `Supernova' is. Don't be. I will sum up the 85-minute
experience (which, by the way, felt twice as long) in a nutshell:  crew
on ship talk and have sex. Distress signal is received and answered.
Mysterious survivor comes aboard, and kills everyone. Mysterious
survivor is killed. There. The end... unless, of course, you march out
to the lobby and demand your money back.</P>
