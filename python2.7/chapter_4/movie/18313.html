<PRE>THE FACULTY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>And another film rolls out of the teen-horror factory.  But, The Faculty
shows promise:  it has some decent talent attached, and seems to be a
change of pace from your run-of-the-mill serial killer stalking
teenagers film.  Is it any good?  Well, it's better than your standard
slasher fare, but hardly enjoyable enough to be called a "good" movie.</P>
<P>There's something odd about the faculty at Herrington High School. Not
only have they begun consuming large quantities of water, but they've
been acting...strangely.  Could it be that alien body snatchers are at
work?  Several students think so.</P>
<P>An unlikely band of students team up to try and stop the invasion. It
starts out with trendy cheerleader/newspaper editor Delilah (Jordana
Brewster) and the hopelessly nerdy photographer Casey (Elijah Wood).
But soon they've roped in Delilah's ex-boyfriend, the ex-quarterback
Stan (Shawn Wayne Hatosy), and the sci-fi obsessed gothic wannabe
lesbian Stokely (Clea DuVall).  Rounding out the group are the brilliant
loser, who peddles his own homemade drugs, Zeke (Josh Hartnett), and the
perky new girl, Marybeth (Laura Harris).</P>
<P>Armed only with their knowledge of body-snatcher cliches, these teens
must face down such fearsome foes as Coach Willis (Robert Patrick),
Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek), Miss Burke (Famke Janssen), Miss Olsen
(Piper Laurie), and the sinister Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth).</P>
<P>The script for The Faculty was written by the vastly overrated Kevin
Williamson, of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer fame. Once
again, he is good at pointing out cliches,  but displays little or no
originality of his own.  Williamson does give the characters knowledge
of those cliches (which raises him one rung above the average horror
film writer), but doesn't use that knowledge to go anywhere.  As a
result, the film simply revisits the same territory as Invasion of the
Body Snatchers, or The Thing, without any real surprises.</P>
<P>The characters, while all shallow archetypes, are at least well played.
Those in, or recently out of, high school will recognize at least a few
of the various types among the oversimplifications here.  On a purely
escapist revenge-seeking level, the film does work in a way.  The
every-teens here are able to wreak revenge upon the every-teachers who
have tormented them.</P>
<P>The special effects of the film include some potentially interesting
concepts, but they're hamstrung by flawed execution.  Many of the
effects, which are intended to look creepy, are goofy instead.  Even the
film's ultimate CGI creature looks rather unremarkable...  The novelty
of computer-generated monsters has worn off, and special effects artists
need to return to creating innovative designs.</P>
<P>Director Robert Rodriguez, who has successfully created tense and
suspenseful scenes in the past, has lost his touch here.  A few of the
scenes hint at his prior potential, but they're all hobbled in one way
or another.  There's rarely an feeling of true danger, and when there
is...you simply don't care.</P>
<P>Still, compared with the string of recent horror films, The Faculty is
one of the better entries in this struggling genre.  In may even be
worth a look when it arrives at your local rental store.  But,
particularly at this time of year, you can do much better than The
Faculty when at your local theater.</P>
