<P>Roland Emmerich directing a movie that doesn't feature major special effects
gadgetry or giant creatures pulverizing metropolitan cities? Say it ain't
so. Well, it is so, and so is the fact that star Mel Gibson reportedly
received a cool $25 million bucks for making this period piece. But with the
word of mouth starting off strong and the success of another periodic epic
still riding the wave of the early summer box-office (can anyone say
GLADIATOR), things are looking mighty good for the man behind such popcorn
fare as GODZILLA and INDEPENDENCE DAY.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A widowed father of seven children is suddenly pulled back into the savagery
of battle when his family is threatened by the American Revolution. With his
oldest son by his side, the father reluctantly joins the fight against the
British Redcoats and hopes to bring about the freedom of their nation.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A slow-starting film, which presents an interesting story, some entertaining
battle sequences and a flawless representation of the times, ultimately
succeeds with an emotional connection to its characters, but not without its
sporadic lags. Surprised was I to find myself tearing up in some spots of
this movie, with numerous comfort moments needed for the Mrs. as well. In
fact, much unlike the GLADIATOR, this film manages to pack many moments of
emotion into its web of war, and further unlike the former epic, does so
without breaking any major ground with any of its battle sequences. Mind
you, the last 30 minutes of the film are definitely rock-solid, with an
all-out attack scenario sure to have most glued to their seats. But the core
of the film is centered more around its characters, with Mel juggling the
state of his family, sins from his past and the brutality of war, while his
son, the effective Heath Ledger, rides along with his idealistic
deliberations of honor and pursuit of justice. I liked the people in this
film, they seemed real to me and I ultimately cared about what happened to
each and every one of them.</P>
<P>Having said that, the film did begin to spread its emotions a little too
thin at some point, at which I wondered whether or not it would be able to
maintain an even balance with the film's action. But it did indeed, with
various small but carefully orchestrated battles spreading their way along
to the major one in the end. I found a lot of this war unsettling, only
because I wasn't used to this face-to-face combat, with lines of folks just
standing in front of one another and firing away. Very strange. But
ultimately, the direction and feel of the film just won me over and
completely immersed was I in its time. And that's saying a lot, because I
personally am not a fan of period films. Gibson kicked arse in the lead,
with enough genuine pain, anguish, revenge and pure adrenaline pumping
through his performance to demand your attention. But the film is really
taken to another level with the aid of a tangible enemy, a villain who in
this case is played to a tee by Jason Isaacs, slashing and burning
everything in sight. A delicious part handled masterfully by the actor
transports us from a seat among the audience, to a willing contestant and
rooter for the home team. In the end, this is not a "fun" movie by any
stretch of the imagination. It's bloody as heck, legs are chopped off,
people get killed left and right, the struggle seems to go on forever, and
very few (but timely) moments of comedic relief ever break through. But in
the end, the sense of relief and unburden is all worth it, with the film's
best cinematic moments saved for its last precious half hour.</P>
<P>A long arduous journey which definitely won't fulfill all appetites
certainly does a good job of representing a frenetic time and place in
history, presenting us with several well-developed characters and offering
us a handful of exciting battle scenes. It might have benefited from a
little trim and definitely provided one too many bleak moments for my taste,
but all in all, a solid effort for everyone involved.</P>
