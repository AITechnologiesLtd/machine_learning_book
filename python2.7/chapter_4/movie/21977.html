<PRE>The Matrix: virtual messiah</PRE>
<P>The most successful use of the messiah-figure in movie-land so far has to be
Star Wars, where young Luke 'redeems' that far away galaxy. And of course
the narrative arc associated with the messianic character is the monomythic
cycle, per Joseph Campbell, whom Lucas supposedly read heavily. Meaning Star
Wars was no accident (i.e., was already ingrained into our cultural
unconscious). Neither is the Wachowski brothers' (Andy & Larry, best know
for Bound) The Matrix, which, instead of picking and choosing from the
monomyth per Lucas, instead just uses it all, from the 'parentless' birth to
the prophesied appearance to the ability to transcend reality. The messiah
here even dies and gets reborn, which means, yes, this has all been done
before. Thing is, though, it's never been visually-realized so well, from
the opening frame on.</P>
<P>It all starts with a nifty little showcase of the Gap-commercial camerawork
we know from the trailer, which provides perhaps the best opening-action
sequence around, counting Bond. The woman in black is Trinity (sci-fi newbie
Carrie-Anne Moss), and, while the special effects do get all the attention,
they also serve a second purpose: to make us wonder just how she can pull
them off. Meaning there's already a question to be answered, a mystery to be
solved, which in narrative terms translates as a compelling reason to move
forward. By the end of that opening sequence, we're hooked. And it only gets
better (or, the mystery, as all good mysteries must, only deepens).</P>
<P>Cut now to Neo (Keanu Reeves, already at home in the sci-fi future, via
Johnny Mnemonic, even Bill & Ted), our messiah, a cubicle-sitter by day,
minor league computer hacker by night. It's his night job where he really
lives, where he hears whisperings of the 'Matrix,' and some shadowy
terrorist figure called Morpheus (sci-fi veteran Laurence Fishburne). But
whisperings aren't enough: like Kirstun Dunst in Interview with the Vampire,
he wants some more. Soon enough he gets it, gets pulled into answering the
mind-bending question Donald Sutherland asked a long time ago in Body
Snatchers: What if this world is just nested in another world, which is
nested in another world, and on and on? He's introduced to the
question--introduced to the 'Matrix'--by none other than Morpheus, who
dresses it all up like a Through the Looking Glass experience. You almost
expect Grace Slick to punctuate the background for us some, but the
Wachowski bros. are able to reel it all in nicely, put the white rabbit on
someone's arm instead of onto the soundtrack. It all makes sense if you pay
just a little attention.</P>
<P>Once you're in on the secret then, (real, or Memorex?) everything shifts
into overdrive. Lots of spaghetti-western hero shots, with Neo's overcoat
whipping dramatically (see Cage in Face-Off for more shots like this). Lots
of gunplay and techtalk. Lots of stepping into and out of realities, per
Millennium (1989) or 12 Monkeys. Even a little romance. The Matrix simply
has it all, and then some; you'll want to see it twice, at least. And yes,
it does get a little gun-heavy for a while, but this is an action film,
after all. Slow-motion leadslinging is part of the package. And the spent
cartridges never quite rise above story-level, anyway, but not so much
because there's not a lot of cartridges to spend, but simply because there's
so much story there in the first place. That is what drew us to Star Wars,
after all, yes? The Matrix, though not a space opera, is just as good, and
has the added bonus of updated effects technology. The only place Star Wars
might have a clear advantage, really, is that Lucas didn't tack an
unnecessary coda on, where the Wachowski bros did. Minus those four or five
seconds at the end, however, The Matrix is the best sci-fi to come along
since Bladerunner. Just a lot louder.</P>
