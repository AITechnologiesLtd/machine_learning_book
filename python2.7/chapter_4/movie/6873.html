<PRE>                               LA CEREMONIE
                       A film review by Froilan Vispo
                        Copyright 1997 Froilan Vispo</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>The Lelievre family watches a television broadcast of  Mozart's opera
DON GIOVANNI where Leporello serenades a servant-girl, imploring her to
come to the window.  Those watching the opera feel safe in the knowledge
that although the scene is a deception (not wanting to be recognized,
Don Giovanni has hidden himself in some bushes and has ordered his
servant  Leporello to lip-synch to his song), it is a comic one and the
intentions of Don Giovanni are amorous in nature.  Unknown to the
Lelievres, their new housekeeper had received a beckoning from a
stranger and even allowed her inside their home.  </P>
<P>There is no deception to LA CEREMONIE.  In fact, its
narrative - that of a stranger introduced into the home - rings familiar
but its unfolding unnerves nevertheless.  </P>
<P>Much of the success of LA CEREMONIE can be attributed to the faultless
acting of all involved, especially Sandrine Bonnaire who plays Sophie,
the new housekeeper hired by the wealthy Lelievres to tend their grand
country home.  Bonnaire's performance lulls like anaesthesia, assuring
us that the foibles are trivial and that the disquiet in our minds is
undeserved.</P>
<P>Initially, Sophie proves quite capable although strangely quiet and
complacent.  Some household duties exhibit that this exterior calm is a
shaky one, however, but Sophie is boundlessly resourceful in her
determination to keep her shortcoming a secret from the Lelievres.  As
we learn more about what lies underneath Sophie's calm facade - her easy
frustration, her steel resolve and its resulting resourcefulness - the
overall impression becomes less reassuring indeed.  </P>
<P>After Sophie allows Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), the village postal clerk,
into the Lelievre home, through the window even, the two quickly
establish a friendship.  Their initial antics seem harmless enough,
bordering on childish play and slumber party mischief.  Like Sophie,
Jeanne also has her own secrets judging by the rumours swirling about
her.  As Sophie's relationship with the Lelievres deteriorates, both
women find themselves isolated from everyone else in the village except
each other.  It is a perfect and disturbing fit: Jeanne rambles on
contemptuously against everyone else, complete with gossip involving
each of the Lelievres, while Sophie plays the blank but impressionable
slate who willingly assists Jeanne's minor conspiracies against her
employers.  Or is Sophie the willing co-conspirator with devices of her
own? </P>
<P>What does the title refer to, "the ceremony?"  The word, with all its
nuances, is an apt one, but the most disturbing dictionary definition is
this: an action performed only formally with no deep significance.  I
will take refuge in the faint hope that the nonchalant senselessness of
it all was supposed to mean something, to be symbolic.  What is certain
is that LA CEREMONIE allows few refuges.</P>
