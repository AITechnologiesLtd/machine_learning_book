<P>In its native France, 1993's time travel comedy, "Les Visiteurs," became a 
breakout hit that ended up outgrossing "Jurassic Park" in that respective 
year. When it was finally released in the United States, it flopped, but 
Hollywood's viewpoint was that all it needed was an American remake for it to 
become a financial success. In a rare move, the original's director, 
Jean-Marie Poire, and main stars, Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, have 
reunited for "Just Visiting," which is cursorily enjoyable, but  almost 
instantly forgettable.</P>
<P>In a prologue set in 12th-century England, the honorable Count Thibault (Jean 
Reno) is preparing to marry his beloved Rosalind (Christina Applegate). When 
he becomes victim to witchcraft and ends up accidentally killing his fair 
love, he seeks out the help of a wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to cast a spell on 
him and his goofily faithful servant, Andre (Christian Clavier), to send them 
back in time to the moment preceding Rosalind's untimely death. </P>
<P>The spell goes awry, however, and Count Thibault and Andre end up awaking in 
Chicago, circa 2000. In an entirely different place and time than they have 
ever known, they are both mystified and frightened of the inventions and way 
of life in the modern world, standing as two fish helplessly out of water. 
Almost immediately after landing in the present day, they have a chance meet 
with Julia Malfete (Applegate, in a dual role), a 
great-great-great-great-great descendant of Rosalind, who takes them in and 
helps them in finding a way back home. </P>
<P>With a screenplay by Jean-Marie Poire, Christian Clavier, and John Hughes, 
"Just Visiting" takes its time in setting up the premise, but finds much 
physical comedy once things get going. The movie is very funny some of the 
time, and occasionally clever, but is so slight that it offers nothing 
worthwhile outside of a few laughs. The featherweight plot lacks an urgency 
that fails to ever involve the viewer in the goings-on, and with the end 
credits comes a feeling of time that could have certainly been more 
well-spent.</P>
<P>Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, as Count Thibault and Andre, expertly play 
two 12th-century men humorously floundering in the 21st-century, and no 
wonder--they played the same exact roles in "Les Visiteurs," unseen by 
myself. Their characters never feel like anything other than pawns, though, 
so it is difficult to invest any interest on their returning to England and 
setting things right. </P>
<P>The American actors who surround them are all rising young actors whose 
involvement in such a minor, wasteful effort boggles the mind. Christina 
Applegate (1998's "The Big Hit"), as both Rosalind and Julia, is a bright 
actress whom I've admired ever since her days on TV's "Married...with 
Children," and she is very good here, trying to keep a straight face amidst 
the insanity that is brought with two men from medieval times transplanted in 
the year 2000. Matt Ross (2000's "American Psycho"), as Julia's slimy 
fiancee; Bridgette Wilson-Sampras (2001's "The Wedding Planner"), as his 
mistress; and Tara Reid (2000's "Dr. T and the Women"), as a free spirit who 
catches the eye of Andre, have one-dimensional supporting roles.</P>
<P>As a movie that just happens to be playing on cable late one night, "Just 
Visiting" might be a harmless way to spend an hour-and-a-half before heading 
to sleep. As a  theatrical release, its aspirations are hopeless, and its 
chance of financial success is about as promising as "Battlefield Earth 2." 
Hollywood Pictures would have been best off had they just left well-enough 
alone.</P>
