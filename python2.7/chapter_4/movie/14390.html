                        REVIEW: ROUNDERS (1998)
                     by Chris Webb  copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>Cast: Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich, Martin Landau, Gretchen
Mol.  directed by John Dahl.</P>
<P>Before Matt Damon became "Ooh, Matt Damon!" he was a young actor
just looking for work.  It wasn't until "Courage Under Fire" that he
really gained notice for his acting ability.  His performance in a small, 
though pivotal role, caught the eye of Steven Spielberg, who gave him the
title role in this summer's "Saving Private Ryan."  At the same time,
"Good Will Hunting" turned Damon into a superstar, sex symbol, and double
Oscar nominee.</P>
<P>Going to "Rounders," I wanted to see if we would get Matt Damon the actor,
or Matt Damon the super-glossy star.  And what we find is a little bit of
both.  Matt Damon the star is on screen as Matt Damon the actor tries to
portray Mike McDermott, a high stakes poker player and law student.  This
is slightly distracting when watching the film, but a good mix for
attracting audiences.</P>
<P>McDermott is conveniently at a crossroads in every aspect of his life from
the start of the film.  He loses thirty grand in one hand against Teddy
KGB (John Malkovich), an underground poker club owner with connections to
the Russian mafia.  This throws McDermott into a tailspin and he decides
to become legitimate, which suits live-in law school girlfriend Jo
(relative unknown Gretchen Mol).</P>
<P>Around the same time, McDermott's best friend from childhood, Worm (Edward
Norton), is coming out of jail.  Worm hustles and cheats his way through
poker, the antithesis to Mike's considerable skill.  This singleminded
movie focuses on Worm's bringing Mike back into underground poker and the
deterioration of his non-gambling life.</P>
<P>First-time feature writers David Levien and Brian Koppelman have come up
with a witty script.  But the inside world of poker and the one-track
storyline make for a pretty slow two hours.  Mike's relationship with Jo
is an underdeveloped afterthought.  Jo's protests about Mike's gambling
come off as whiny and do not ring with the impending heartbreak that one
might expect from a couple breaking up.  Once Jo leaves the apartment, she
almost vanishes from the film.  Its not the point of Rounders anyway to go
deeply into this relationship - rather Mike's struggle between his two
senses of self takes center stage.</P>
<P>Martin Landau, playing not-so-coincidentally a professor who also
struggled between becoming a rabbi or following his true calling to teach
law, arrives just in time to assist Mike in his choice.  Wondering what
path he chooses?  Well, I'll just tell you this is not a John Grisham
movie.</P>
<P>By this point, Worm has dragged him so far down back into the poker world
that Mike has to take on Worm's debts.  They need to raise fifteen
thousand bucks in five days.  Worm, of course, sabotages the plan with his
hustling resulting in a showdown between Mike and Teddy KGB in a
winner-take-all game.  </P>
<P>Rounders has the feel of 1940s and 50s crime films with Matt Damon
voicing-over a narration throughout.  Director John Dahl (Unforgettable)
never lets us forget the stark dreariness of the underground with cold
blues and blacks dominating his palate.  All in all, it's a pretty well
acted movie, as well.</P>
<P>Many movies that are full of Academy Award nominees and winners (like
1996's Marvin's Room) tend not to live up to the hype.   With Malkovich,
Norton, Landau, and Damon, Rounders has quite the pedigree.  Malkovich (In
the Line of Fire) commands respect on screen as his very presence should
strike fear in those dealing with him.  His role is small, but his
convincing Russian accent keeps him interesting.  Norton (Primal Fear) is
his twitchy self, while Landau (Ed Wood) deserves more time than his three
to four conversations.</P>
<P>The treasure of Rounders is found in John Turturro, who can play quirky in
Coen brothers' films or straight in such fare as Quiz Show.  Turturro
plays Kinish, Mike's mentor if Mike will ever listen.  Kinish has the
skill to play with the best, but does not look for the glory of victory.
He earns his living legitimately driving a truck.  His winnings pay
alimony and child support.  </P>
<P>It is difficult to decide whether Mike is a gambling addict who needs help
or a skilled player hungry for his dream to play in the World Series of
Poker on ESPN.  He wins without cheating, can tell everyone's hand after
just entering a room (playing blind, as they say), and uses his biggest
challenges for bluffing practice.  In the process, though, he loses his
girlfriend, quits law school, gets beaten up severely, and plays
compulsively.  His addiction fuels the pursuit of the dream.  Mike plays
for the glory, the excessive amounts of money are necessary for him to be
able to play.  It's a tightrope Mike walks throughout Rounders, and quite
shakily at that.</P>
<P>Matt Damon walks the same tightrope in his first major role since "Good
Will Hunting."  It will be interesting to see if his
considerable acting abilities will ever again be able to outshine the star
status the world has placed on him. </P>
