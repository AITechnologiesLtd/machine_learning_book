<P>   Titles chosen for movies obviously have something to do
with the interest the films generate.  Perhaps "The Iron
Giant," a leviathan of a story which achieved eminent critical
success, was a box-office disappointment because its title
just doesn't excite attention.  But label a movie with "dog"
and you just may attract ample notice.  After all a whopping
40% of American households have dogs, or so I've heard. 
Then, you never know.  In the 19th century the most popular
words in the English language were "Lincoln," "Doctor," and
"Dog," so naturally someone wrote a novel called "Lincoln's
Doctor's Dog."  It failed.</P>
<P>   "A Dog of Flanders" is not a failure, but the picture is not a
triumph of children's filmmaking either.  A tear-jerker like
"Lassie Come Home," "Flanders" does not stand up to that
1943 masterwork, the greatest animal picture of all time. 
Kevin Brodie and Robert Singer's script is saddled with
cliches, its focus is not on the dog (who has little more than a
cameo role and, in fact, is not even cited in the principal cast
list), and though we want children's movies to teach lessons,
this one OD's on preachiness.  Here are some of the
platitudes that kids in the audience must endure, if indeed
they sit as still as they did for the far worthier "Iron Giant"...</P>
<P> 1.  Never underestimate the power of love;
 2.  Never get drunk and whip your dog;
 3.  Don't smoke and then fall asleep in the haystack;
 4.  Never hate or lower yourself to the level of your enemies;
 5.  There's nothing like milk in the morning;
 6.  Bandages keep the dirt out;
 7.  Reach for the stars;
 8.  Of course you can be great: you have (mother,
grandfather, dog, blacksmith, great painter) to believe in you.
 9.  People die, right before your eyes, kids.  (One from
influenza, I think; one from a heart attack; one is murdered by
a dog.)</P>
<P>   If you're a particularly hip kid, you may get the message
that it's OK to have fun in the hay with a woman and then
abandon her if she's below your station.  You can always
return a hero years later and take responsibility for what you
and the indigent lady produced.</P>
<P>   "A Dog of Flanders" was done a few times before on TV
and in the movies, the one notable American version most
notably featuring Theodore Bikel in a character role in 1959. 
There was also a European interpretation of Ouida's fable
during the 1940s.  This is not to say there's no reason to
revive the sappy story since most of us probably hadn't seen
any of the previous incarnations, so here's what we get...</P>
<P>  Nello (Jeremy James Kissner as the kid of about 12 and
Jesse James when he was six) watches his mother die after
she was presumably caught in a Belgian snowstorm.  Nello is
brought up by an amiable grandfather, Jehan Daas (Jack
Warden), who encourages the lad to cherish a sketchbook his
mother left for him.  When a brutal drunk leaves his whipped
work dog, a Bouvier des flanders, for dead in the snow, the
boy adopts the dog whom he dubs Patrasche, nurses her
(him?) back to the living, and finds room in his heart for both
the Bouvier and a rich girl named Aloise (Madylin Sweeten). 
Determined to become a painter like the Belgian town's late
hero, Peter Paul Rubens, he finds himself at a disadvantage
because of his socio-economic class, shunned by both
Aloise's philistine father and later by the city fathers.  But his
painting career blossoms under the guidance of an
accomplished artist, Michel de la Grande (Jon Voight), who
takes an unusual interest in the boy.</P>
<P>   Jon Voight looks silly in the huge rug he wears to show
that he's a European Artiste (capital E and A), and seems
embarrassed enough in the role that he wears assorted
layers of clothing even when he's studying his canvas.  Jack
Warden's avuncular guise is all too brief but Jeremy James
Kissner as the principal performer carries the picture well
enough.  (The boy bears an unusual resemblance to Helen
Hunt.)  By exhibiting the usual suspects--giving comeuppance
to a drunk who suffers a fate like that of the Wicked Witch of
the West and to a vicious landlord who resembles the
landowners of Victorian melodramas; and making heroes of
the good guys including the sensitive wife (Cheryl Ladd) of an
all-too-practical farmer (Steven Hartley)--"A Dog of Flanders"
is just a been-there-done-that generic amusement that has
little resonance.  The dog is adorable, and when she (he?)
likes the human will bark on cue and pull loads of milk in a
wagon.  But a picture that's named for the Bouvier should
have made the Belgian pooch do more to earn his waffles. 
You may have heard barking before, but yips and yelps are
preferable to sentences like blacksmith William's "There's
nothing like milk in the morning."</P>
