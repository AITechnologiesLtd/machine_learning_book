<PRE>                                   QUILLS
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
                         Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>        Come frolic with the Marquis de Sade deep in the bowels of the
Charenton Asylum, where he'll tickle your fancy with lavish descriptions
of bestiality, flatulence and the dimples of a fat mademoiselle's
bottom.</P>
<P>        As portrayed in Quills, based on the Obie Award-winning play by Doug
Wright, the Marquis is an earthy, dirty, jolly old soul with the
unquenchable desire to write his perverse dreams on paper.  He's the
unflinching id in the face of mediocrity and tolerance, the middle
finger held like a candle to the powerful hypocrites, and the loud fart
in the house of God, an affront to restrictive dogma.</P>
<P>        It's not enough that the madman hole up in his room with quill and
reams of parchment to indulge his fantasies, no.  He has to publish it
to the secret, unspoken delight of the masses.  Chapters are being
smuggled out of the asylum by a curious chambermaid, Madeleine (Kate
Winslet from Heavenly Creatures, Titanic).  The streets are buzzing with
outrage and titillation.</P>
<P>        Napoleon (Ron Cook) would love nothing more than to see the head of the
Marquis twitching under the guillotine, but martyrdom would only
increase the sales and spread the word.  Therefore, a man is sent to the
asylum with the intent to cure the Marquis of all the devils inside his
head, whether it be through torture or, worse, the restriction of his
writing privileges.</P>
<P>        That upstanding citizen sent to Charenton is Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael
Caine, reclaiming his title as Hardest Working Actor in the Business), a
man so moral to the core that he marries a young lass whom he could have
fathered twice over.  This pinnacle of morality even has to force
himself upon her on their wedding night.</P>
<P>        Our friend the doctor is just the sort of closet dirty bird the Marquis
delights in mocking.  A play is swiftly written, performed by the
inmates of the asylum (which is indeed based on fact, since de Sade's
plays were quite popular in his day) about a dirty old man humping his
young bride in a variety of sexual positions.  Dr. Royer-Collard sits in
the audience, silently biding his time.  In this battle of wills between
doctor and madman, this is only the beginning.</P>
<P>        Doug Wright's story takes tremendous liberties with the Marquis' life,
but the approach taken by director Philip Kaufman (Henry & June) feels
appropriately mannered, clever and seedy.  From the start, we accept
that every character will be a bit off.</P>
<P>        Geoffrey Rush is wonderfully carnal and hungry as the Marquis,
sashaying and swaying his body as he spouts out his scathing indictments
of the so-called upstanding members of society.  He makes full use of
his robust voice, moving from ticklish prods to hot ecstasy.  Rush
manages to play the role over-the-top without going into camp, since he
reveals small, subtle moments of genuine feeling (such as the moment we
knew was coming, when the men in power take away his precious quills).</P>
<P>        Kate Winslet continues to impress as his loyal supporter, choosing
challenging roles in independent films rather than cashing in on the
success of Titanic.  She could have become a major Hollywood star, but
instead opted for building a quality body of work in such films as Holy
Smoke and Hideous Kinky.  She and Rush attack their scenes with playful
relish together.</P>
<P>        There's also fine support from Joaquin Phoenix's (Gladiator)
humanitarian priest whose noble principles are rocked by the decadent
charms of the Marquis.  Michael Caine takes what could have been a
predictable arch-fiend and turns him into a complex, firm presence -- a
steady rock who makes for quite a match against Geoffrey Rush's Marquis,
though they share very few scenes.</P>
<P>        Philip Kaufman brings bravura camera placement into the film, whether
it be low angles of leering faces or tracking shots following horse
drawn carriages intercut with passengers rocking back and forth as
vampiric music rejoices on the soundtrack.  The production design is a
Merchant Ivory film gone to seed, with mossy green walls and costumes
which are soiled, wrinkled, and dirty.  Even the wigs have flecks of
sweat and grime.  The actors, feeding off of these props, give
performances like grinning masks, scary and hilarious.</P>
<P>        The plot is fairly traditional melodrama, complete with secret affairs
and betrayals, bodice ripping and murder.  It all culminates in an
inevitable, explosive riot within the madhouse where the insane run
wild, rattling their chains and ripping off their clothes.  The sex and
violence crowd will find their fair share of it here.  While the
mechanics are not unfamiliar, there's so much gusto thrown into the
performances and attention to period detail that Quills plays out as
enjoyably lavish, but not laughable.</P>
<P>        This film never goes as far as Pier Paolo Pasolini's interpretation of
de Sade's Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, happy to be entertaining if not
challenging.  Altogether, it makes for a fitting beginner's introduction
to the Sadean school of thought (and a much better one than De Sade, an
earlier film on the man's life).</P>
<P>        Oddly, even though Geoffrey Rush spends the final half hour of the
picture wandering around completely naked, this version of Marquis de
Sade's life could almost play in Peoria.  Almost, I say.  While the
Marquis spends much of the film talking about the bizarre sexual acts he
committed during his life, Quills does find time to give us a little
necrophilia.  Gotta love that Marquis.</P>
