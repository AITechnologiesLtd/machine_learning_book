<P>IN SHORT: A Rockin' African-American targeted date flick.</P>
<P>We begin with Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs), a novelist just months away
from the publication of "Unfinished Business," his first book. Based on
his friends from college, the writing is so steamy that Oprah Winfrey
wants to feature it in her book club. Not only does success beckon, so
does his beautiful girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan), a caterer whose
business, too, is starting to take off. Three pending jobs is keeping
her from journeying from Chicago to New York, for the wedding of two of
Harper's friends. Truth of the matter is, they're his friends. Robin'll
just catch up at the wedding. Besides, she's getting just a bit
discouraged that her beau can't make the slightest move towards either
commitment or saying those three little words.</P>
<P>Those friends, quickly, are: the groom, Lance (Morris Chestnut), a NFL
running back (NY Giants?) who has used his fame to great advantage with
the ladies, if you know what I mean; his save it for the wedding night
bride Mia (Monica Calhoun); Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long), Harper's woulda
coulda shoulda but never did gal; career-phobic Quentin (Terrence
Howard), who plays a mean guitar; equally career-phobic Murch (Harold
Perrineau) who's staring down a six figure legal gig and his controlling
bitch of a girlfriend Shelby (Melissa DeSousa), whom everyone in this
group, save Murch, detests. With Robin away until the day of the
wedding, Jordan determines that she's going to nail Harper, one way or
the other.</P>
<P>The New York weekend means reunion for this crew. Thanks to a
prepublication copy of Harper's book obtained, and circulated among all
concerned, by teevee producer Jordan, old secrets come out in the open.
Each real person sees themselves in the book's fictional characters and
when the groom finally gets his turn, let's just say his eyes are opened
to the fact that his virginal bride may not be. A joyful weekend
escalates into something much more as the groom wants vengeance and each
of the other single men get to reevaluate their own relationships.</P>
<P>That doesn't give anything away as writer/director Malcolm D. Lee
fashions strong characters and the actors make you feel as if this group
had indeed been friends for years. Then again, the African-American
acting community isn't a very large one so they may actually be friends.
And, yes, I may be a middle aged white guy who ears can't follow the
vocal rhythms; I didn't catch half the lingo, but there's enough here
that when push came to shove and the film hit its edge of the seat
climax -- I know, for a comedy that's a bit of a stretch to imagine, but
that's what it was -- I was there, baby.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Best Man, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<P>Much better than the average dateflick. The Best Man is not the kind of
African-American targeted movie that may not be accessible enough to
white audiences to cross over big time, but I'm an old fogey. The
kidlets who speak in rap rhythms may get this with no problem. With
dating couples all around me, and running commentary on the action from
all of 'em (there are advantages to sitting with "real" people), The
Best Man wasn't hard to follow. Just watching the crowd, as I've done at
other A-A starring flicks, left me with the impression that this is
bigger and better than the average flick targeted at them.</P>
