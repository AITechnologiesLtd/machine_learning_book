<PRE>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Hollywood is a hotbed of ideas these days. Financial ones.</P>
<P>Having decided to marshal its resources on fewer films, the studio
executives are hard at work searching for lucrative approaches. The
safest path to riches? Remakes. Or so they seem to think.</P>
<P>After all, what's easier than remaking a movie that audiences have liked
before? Start calling agents. Get yourself some bankable stars and a big
name director, and start planning the marketing campaign.</P>
<P>As crass as this approach is, it does produce some modestly entertaining
films, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, directed by DIE HARD's John McTiernan,
being one.  Pierce Brosnan (the current James Bond) and Rene Russo (TIN
CUP) replace Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, who starred in the
original. Although this is not particularly inspired casting, neither is
a bad choice.</P>
<P>As suave billionaire Thomas Crown, Pierce Brosnan looks dashingly
handsome, no surprise there. Crown is a kleptomaniac for the fun of it.
He's the type who bets $100,000 on a single golf stroke. He wagers not
because he thinks he'll make the putt but because he just enjoys the
thrill of the gamble. He's also a playboy who draws women to him like
flies to honey. With Brosnan's looks and charm, this is probably the
easiest part of the story to believe.</P>
<P>The performance by the usually reliable Rene Russo is another matter
entirely. This version of the movie focuses on the romantic aspects of
the relationship between the rich thief and his insurance investigating
nemesis, Catherine Banning (Russo). Russo, who has used her sexuality as
a sideline in other films, is asked to make it a key part of this
character.</P>
<P>Perhaps because action director McTiernan is unable to give her proper
guidance or perhaps because of her harsh, heavy make-up, Russo delivers
a performance that's sometimes funny, but too often stiff. The low
points of the film are when she takes her clothes off. Trying without
much success to recreate Elizabeth Shue's whiskey scene in LEAVING LAS
VEGAS, Russo ends up appearing awkward, as if she'd never made love
before.</P>
<P>The setup for the movie has a Trojan horse full of burglars delivered to
what is clearly the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (The press
kit claims that it wasn't meant to be any real museum. Sure.) The crime
goes awry, but between mergers and acquisitions, rich businessman Crown
manages to steal a $100,000,000 painting anyway.</P>
<P>As the tough, by-the-book Detective Michael McCann, Denis Leary gives
the funniest performance in the movie. When a tony insurance
investigator (Banning) invades his turf, the detective is not pleased,
especially when she uses effective but illegal and unethical techniques
in going after Crown. "Do you have any idea how many flesh-eating
lawyers this guy is going to have?" he asks her in frustration. The
negative chemistry between the two is delicious. "So, are the laws of
the United States completely unknown to you?" he asks her rhetorically.</P>
<P>As soon as Banning tells Crown that she knows he did it, the movie
becomes a cat-and-mouse game. The script at its best finds especially
clever ways for Crown to trick Banning and the cops and for her to
discover his secrets. At its worst, as in the bizarre character of
Crown's psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), the movie becomes ridiculous. "Oh
dear, Peter Pan decides to grow up and finds there's no place to land,"
his psychiatrist chides him in a typically asinine line. This subplot is
a needless distraction in a film that needs more focus and energy. For
work of a director known for his proclivity to blow things up, the movie
moves at a remarkably languid pace.</P>
<P>Even if you can guess parts of the ending, the exact way the story gets
resolved is a genuine treat. Full of inventiveness and audience pleasing
twists, the story ends on an especially satisfying high note.</P>
<P>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR runs 1:51. It is rated R for sex, nudity and
language. If the few nude scenes had been deleted, which would have been
a decided improvement, the movie would have been rated PG-13 and
appropriate for kids 10 and up. As it is, the movie would be fine for
those 15 and up.</P>
