<P>     It's a talented filmmaker who can turn off the Cruise control, but
writer/director Cameron Crowe (SAY ANYTHING, SINGLES) does just that in
this funny and refreshingly frank romantic comedy.  In one of the better
roles of his career, Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire, a high-powered
sports agent who has a change of heart, gets fired, and is forced to
practice what he now preaches as his own employee.  (One night, after
spontaneously developing a conscience, Jerry drafts a 27-page Mission
Statement on the subject of integrity.  His employer thinks his Mission
impossible and, one week later, Jerry Maguire is toast.) He leaves the
agency with an accountant, a young, single mother (the charming, but
rather one-dimensional Renee Zellweger) who is so inspired by Jerry's
principles that she walks out the door with him.  Together, they set up
shop and begin directing their energies on a couple remaining clients,
while, of course, falling in love.  Or so we think.</P>
<P>     One of the strengths of Cameron Crowe's writing is that his script
is populated with real, believable people in real, believable
relationships.  Thus, and like life itself, the story takes several
unusual and unexpected turns, one of which explores the reality of what
happens when a lonely guy meets a desperate girl.  Not exactly your
standard formula for romance and that makes JERRY MAGUIRE all the more
rewarding.  Sure, there are other reasons to appreciate this movie:
Crowe's offbeat direction, a hilarious morning-after sequence that's one
of many big laughs, Bonnie Hunt as the cynical older sister/divorcee,
Cruise's chemistry with child actor Jonathan Lipnicki, screen sex that's
actually sexy, and a scene-stealing Cuba Gooding, Jr. (OUTBREAK, BOYZ N
THE HOOD) as the sassy, second-tier football player who helps Jerry get
back in the game.  Go see it.</P>
