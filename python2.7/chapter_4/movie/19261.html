<P>I guess I should start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the
animated series "South Park" which runs on Comedy Central.  I've
followed it since it's debut, and while it has had it's occasional ups
and
downs, overall it provides more laughs than any other show on
television,
cable or otherwise.  I should also point out that just because I'm a
huge
fan of the series didn't automatically guarantee this movie a high
rating.
There have been other shows that I have been a major supporter of that
didn't do much for me in their big screen outings (Twin Peaks:Fire Walk
With Me comes to mind immediately).</P>
<P>While South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut runs about four times as long as
an
episode of the television series, it never once wears out it's welcome
or
becomes tiresome.  As the story goes, the four main characters (Stan,
Kyle,
Cartman, and Kenny) sneak into their local multiplex to see the new
R-rated
Terrance and Phillip movie Asses of Fire.  When they emerge, they have
discovered even worse language than they use on a daily basis (thanks to
an
extremely profane yet irresistibly catchy musical number from Terrance &</P>
<P>Phillip).  This enrages their parents who blame Canada (Terrance and
Phillip are Canadian you see) and war is soon declared on our neighbors
to
the north.</P>
<P>What's encouraging about South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut is that isn't</P>
<P>just an R-rated version of the hit show.  Series creators Trey Parker
and
Matt Stone could have very easily made just another episode for the big
screen, but instead they've given us a movie with social commentary
about
hypocrisy, censorship, and (gasp!) parental responsibility.  Yes you've
read correctly... this movie has a message.  Don't let that scare you
off
though, there are more laughs in this film than you'd think would be
possible.</P>
<P>Parker and Stone hit a number of "sacred" targets in their film, but as
they've said in interviews "We're equal opportunity offenders".  No
single
organization or racial group is targeted more than another.  And what
makes
the potentially dangerous comedy work so well is because it is so absurd
in
it's presentation.  The situations which the laughs come from are so
outlandish that I personally can't see any of them as being offensive.
Sure the language is harsh, but if you've seen any R-rated movie before
there shouldn't be anything here that would shock you.</P>
<P>However, I don't advise you take your kids either.  It is definitely not</P>
<P>for youngsters unless you, as a parent, explain to your kids about "foul</P>
<P>language" and why it's not always appropriate in the REAL world.
Curiously, I think that many of the ideas and situations in this film
are
far "worse" than anything in Trey Parker's Orgazmo, which the MPAA rated</P>
<P>NC-17.  Why that film is rated NC-17 and this one is rated R goes to
show
the randomness of the current ratings board.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, it would to be hard to classify South Park:Bigger, Longer
&
Uncut as either a comedy or a musical.  Normally I abhor musicals, but
when
they are this funny and the songs are as memorable, I can overlook my
feelings.  And I have to give credit where credit is due.  I've taken a
couple of harsh shots lately at Marc Shaiman and his overblown scores in</P>
<P>films like Patch Adams and The Out of Towners.  In this case, the music
he
has written (along with Trey Parker, mind you) fits perfectly.  Mocking
all
different types of musical numbers from Disney animation to the grand,
sweeping musicals of the 60s to Les Miserables, everything works.  The
soundtrack album is a must have.  On a sidenote: I would have loved to
sit
it on the recording sessions to see the chorus singing some of the
extremely filthy lyrics they have to sing in this film.</P>
<P>South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a great time at the movies if you
love
the series, or if you just love to laugh.  Sure the animation is crude
and
you may say the humor is even cruder, but a lot of the comedy here
requires
a good bit of intelligence to "get".  Those of us who do get it have
something great to enjoy.  [R]</P>
