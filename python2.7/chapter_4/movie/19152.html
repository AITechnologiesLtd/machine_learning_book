<P>The Wild Wild West (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Will Smith, 
Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek and Kenneth Branagh. Directed by Barry 
Sonnenfeld.</P>
<P> The West is neither very wild nor very funny in The Wild Wild West, the 
latest in a tiresome stream of adaptations of old television shows.</P>
<P> Starring Will Smith as suave secret agent James West, the movie appears 
to need a jump start as it lurches from situation to situation.</P>
<P> And, of course, the writers  six are credited, two for the story and 
four for the screenplay, a bad sign  have, in their infinite wisdom, 
sought to "improve" on the concept of the '60s TV series.</P>
<P> Thus, Artemus Gordon (a hammy Kevin Kline) is not merely West's friend 
and assistant. No, here he's a U.S. marshal  a rival to West, at first 
 who, like in the TV series, is a master of disguise. But the writers 
do him one better, transforming him into a scientific genius who is 
always devising new and useful gadgets to extricate himself and West 
from various predicaments.</P>
<P> The only saving grace to this campy confection is Smith, who breezes 
through the proceedings unconcerned about the ludicrous situations.</P>
<P> Unlike Robert Conrad, who in the TV series was supposed to be suave and 
debonair, Smith's James West is a shoot-first, ask-questions-later type 
of hero.</P>
<P> He is a smooth talker and a charmer, but he sounds more the con-artist 
than cultured government agent.</P>
<P> What is embarrassing is watching Kenneth Branagh chew up the screen as 
the evil Dr. Loveless. He affects as thick a Southern accent that hasn't 
been heard on screen since Vivien Leigh complained about "War, war war!" 
in Gone With the Wind.</P>
<P> The story, what little there is, revolves around Loveless' attempts to 
break up the United States and reclaim the honor of the South following 
its defeat in the Civil War.</P>
<P> The chemistry that should exist between partners West and Gordon is nil.</P>
<P> And the same goes for the actors portraying them. Throughout the movie 
it seems that Smith and Kline merely recite lines to one another, that 
they have not developed any rapport.</P>
<P> Lovely Salma Hayek is wasted as the damsel in distress. She isn't in 
much danger, nor does she seem to be distressed that much.</P>
<P> Director Barry Sonnenfeld, his actors and writers cannot seem to decide 
if they want to play the movie straight, tongue-in-cheek or campy, so 
they meander through all three with very mixed results.</P>
<P> The Wild Wild West is a disappointment. Smith fans will enjoy this movie 
because their star gets most of the good one-liners. Other than that, 
there is no reason to go West, young people.</P>
