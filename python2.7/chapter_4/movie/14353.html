                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-( :-( for too much noisy bickering</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Donner
Writer: Channing Gibson, story by Jonathan Lemkin
Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, Jet
Li</P>
<P>It's difficult to express my disappointment at seeing an unsatisfying
conclusion, to what would otherwise be considered a well made trilogy.
The spark has just left Lethal Weapon 4, as surely as the lights dim
before it's opening.</P>
<P>There are certain annoying tendencies that have cropped up in this
movie, which was not obvious in its predecessors. It has to do with age
and maturity, and unfortunately both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are
getting too old to be still yelling and screaming like kids. In fact the
majority of their dialogue is so anxious, frenzied and manic – you
probably won't understand what they're shouting about! Add Joe Peschi to
the screeching and the noise has just become deafening. Not so funny
anymore, poor Peschi gets the brunt of most of the childish antics of
the two most immature Captains on the police force. Add Chris Rock to
the trio and well, we have an avalanche of hyperactivity and mayhem.
Rock tries to out-talk Peschi at every turn and Peschi responds by
yelling louder. In fact all sanity is loss from the word go as the movie
plummets into tedious routines of smart-arse cops trying to outdo each
other.</P>
<P>Fortunately, Renne Russo isn't as manic as the others and retains the
sanity and sanctity of a pregnant woman. The other commendable character
is Jet Li - the martial arts world wonder boy, who doesn't have to shout
to be heard. His stoic looks and staunch Mandarin dialogue, captures
more meaning and heart than the combined clown fest of Gibson, Peschi,
Rock and Glover put together. Not to mention the fact that Li could
probably have kicked their butts majorly bad in a fair fight, but
because he's the villain, ends up dead.</P>
<P>This was one movie where, I wanted the bad guy Li to win and give all
four clowns a good thumping for making too much noise. The stunts are
pretty average for this sort of action thriller – there are no
meteorites, tidal waves or giant monsters stomping through the streets
of this movie. Very disappointing overall, for what was otherwise an
intelligent, witty action duo.</P>
