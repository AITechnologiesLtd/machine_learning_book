<P>   If you get The New Yorker, you probably saw this cartoon not
long ago: guy stands in front of an audience at one of those 12-
steps addiction centers and reports: "Hi, my name is John and I
check my e-mail 350 times a day."  This may sound like an
exaggeration, but in the imagination of writer-director Pierre-Paul
Renders, it's probably true--for some people.  "Thomas in Love"
focuses on its title character but we never see him. What he
checks every day is not exactly e-mail: instead, he is
psychologically tied to his computer which he operates at least
eight hours daily and he never goes outside.  He is agoraphobic,
which is to say, he fears not only the outdoors but human
contact.  He has not left his apartment for eight years, gets three
months' supply of food delivered to him at a stretch, has
maintenance people come to his apartment door and then leaves
whatever he need repaired outside for pickup, consults regularly
with a psychoanalyst, and talks weekly with his mom.  All is
covered by insurance.  In short, he is materially prosperous, he
seems happy enough, but something is missing--something of
which he is only vaguely aware since he actually revels in his
phobia.  He is missing love; real love, that is, not sex because
that is taken care of by his computer which allows him and a
visualized partner of his choice to don special cybersex suits and
to have fun.</P>
<P>   In the case of "Thomas in Love," the principal responsibility for
our entertainment and insight rests not with director Pierre-Paul
Renders or on the principal actor.  The former is almost
unnecessary because of the essentially static nature of the film,
the latter is utilized only for his droning voice.  Philippe
Blasband's script is what gives the story its satiric edge, since the
movie is obviously about the increasing reliance that the human
species in the industrialized world places on machines. 
Blasband sees us as increasingly reliant on mechanized
relationships.  Kids play video games--together with other young
people, but still--the accent is on the game and not on the
interrelationship of human beings.  People walk on the street and
(did you ever notice this?) couples and foursomes walk together
but instead of relating to one another they talk on their separate
cell phones!  TV has long dominated after-dinner living-room
activity and business meetings are conducted via
teleconferencing.  We can't talk to human beings even when we
use the telephone!  Phone a business and what do you hear? 
"Your call is very important to us" says a computerized
message...after which we are encouraged to go to the company
web site rather than bother a human being.</P>
<P>   How effectively "Thomas in Love"  parodies this situation is
another story. Because of the endless chatter between Thomas
(Benoit Verhaert) and each of the people with which he
communicates via computer, e.g. Melody (Migali Pinglaut), his
mother Nathalie (Micheline Hardy), an insurance agent
(Alexandre von Sivers), his shrink (Frederic Topart), a prostitute
Eva (Aylin Yay) and others--the story becomes redundant and
overly wordy despite the frequent changes of personalities that
cross the screen.  The character of Melody is the most
interesting as she, who is a member of the dating club for which
Thomas's psychologist signed him up, desperately wants to meet
him, actually thinks she has fallen in love with the man, and
consents to a session of cybersex with him.  (Cybersex in
Thomas's world is more advanced than it is in our own world of
2001 since the partners fit themselves into suits and actually
grope each other somehow via the screen.)</P>
<P>   "Thomas est amoureux"--as this Belgian-French production is
named--takes off where the scripter's previous screenplay, "A
Pornographic Affair," left off.  In Blasband's previous work, a
couple arranges a transaction through a sex club and try to make
the limited relationship expand into something broader, more
humane.  But because we see just one character at a time in
"Thomas," with Virginie Saint Martin's video camera remaining
almost stationary, we in the audience cannot be blamed for
feeling as claustrophobic as would anyone in the title character's
shoes.  Perhaps that proves that Renders and Blasband's movie
succeeded.  Still, even at 97 minutes, the closed-in feeling
outlasts its welcome.  Intriguing idea, though.</P>
