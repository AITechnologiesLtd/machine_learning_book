<PRE>CHILD'S PLAY (1988)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Tom Holland
Writers: Don Mancini, John Lafia, and Tom Holland
Starring: Catherine Hicks, Alex Vincent, Chris Surrandon, Brad Douriff,
Dinah Manoff, Tommy Swerdlow, Jack Colvin, Neil Guintoli</P>
<P>We all know the fate of "Child's Play," which is the same for almost any
film these days that does marginally well financially: Sequel Hell.
With the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out
(that would be "Bride of Chucky" - and it grossed 11 million in its
opening weekend, which I think is the sign of the apocalypse number
five), it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten
years ago with the original, a task which is a retread for some, and for
others (namely myself) a chance to see what all the fuss was about.</P>
<P>Alas, the original "Child's Play" actually isn't that bad.  Even seeing
it in the tiny, claustrophobic, and mechanically-challenged theatre at
my college wasn't the horribly dull experience I thought it would be,
not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd (which you almost need to
watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me, try and watch this
flick by yourself one day), but because as a whole, this isn't a bad
movie.  It's not great, but it does have two things that many horror
films like this one don't have: 1) a rather nifty premise, and 2) a
sense of humor, both which save this from Horror Hell, which is
precisely where, say, "I Know What You Did Last Summer" has recently
gone.</P>
<P>The premise of "Child's Play" is that a serial killer named Charles Lee
Ray (Brad Douriff) is shot and almost killed by a Chicago hard-boiled
detective (Chris Surrandon - see what happens to some Oscar nominees?),
and before he dies, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly
into a kid's doll called Chucky, a doll which has got to be the
scariest-looking kid's doll I've ever seen.  The next day, a bum who's
stolen it sells it to single-mother Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks), who
then gives it to her young son Andy (Alex Vincent) for his birthday.</P>
<P>Of course Chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to
get out of the doll, but certain twists come up.  Like the guy he
learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse
is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the
doll, that being Andy.  And soon enough, Chucky is killing people either
for revenge or for what seems like fun, and people are discovering that
Chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one.</P>
<P>The idea is a neat one, ripe for lots of comic terror, and luckily it
utlizes a lot of that.  It plays with an idea stolen from a classic
Looney Toons short that when someone knows that Chucky is alive, they
tell people about it, but when he tries to prove themselves, Chucky does
nothing, and everyone thinks they're crazy.  It plays with this, as well
as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life, and
even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments.  Even if
there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches (a woman alone in a house
hears a noise, goes to investigate it, and finds nothing, but wait for
the kicker a second later!), there's also a harrowing car ride with
Chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat, and then trying
to attack him when the car finally crashes, leaving the viewer with at
least rather visceral exprience.</P>
<P>The ending is rather fun, as well, albeit a tad too drawn-out (about
four different endings, maybe five), and the characters are more
intelligent than the average horror film line-up, making them easier to
sympathize with.  If there's one horrible thing about many horror films,
it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout
obscenities at, and for the most part, "Child's Play" steers away from
that.  And most of all, the Chucky character is a good one, not just
because he provides instant comic relief (LOOK!  That doll's moving on
its own!), but because he's a generally scary character.</P>
<P>If there's anything really wrong with "Child's Play," it's that it's too
trite and has too less self esteem.  At almost 90 minutes, "Child's
Play" features way too less to be a real classic of horror.  It throws
itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost
forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a
psychotic doll.  If the film had more confidence in what it was
presenting, it would really push the envelope and become even more than
just a short bit of horror escapism, which is precisely why this kind of
film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film...which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.  As such, "Child's Play" is content to be just
the short, typical horror film, but saves itself via a sense of humor
and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the
average short, typical horror film.</P>
