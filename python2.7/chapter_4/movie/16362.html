<P>  "Tango" is film that possesses moments of rare, surreal
beauty, a surprise ending that will knock your socks off, and
one monologue in particular that plumbs the depths of its
principal figure's feelings.  Helmed and written by the most
Spanish of directors, Carlos Saura, it is creatively put
together and suffers only when we measure it against the
films with harsh political edges that Saura made at the height
of his career. During the Franco regime he had to disguise
his censures of the Fascist government through the use of
allegory, dreams and symbols and while there is no need
during this period of liberal, South American governments, to
do so, Saura seems content to make films more for the
tourists than for the politically engaged.  </P>
<P>  In a movie of almost two hours he shows us more about the
tango than we may wish to know at one sitting while the
story--which treats the theme of the circularity of history--is a
trifle underwritten.  Like Saura's previous film, "Flamenco,"
his current work shows us the steps of the dance, gives us
more than a hint about the passions that underlie it, and then
beats the subject to death.  Watching this periodically
involving drama, you might actually wish that Franco--or, in
this case, the Argentine generals that in the mid-seventies
overthrew the legitimate government of that South American
state--were in power for the ten weeks that the movie was
being put together.  "Tango" might then recover some of the
resonance of Saura's early films such as his "Los Golfos,"
which dealt with street kids in much the way that Vittorio De
Sica treated the urban waifs of his own country.  While Saura
continues to be influenced by Luis Bunuel's use of surrealism,
he has shucked off most of his predecessor's preoccupation
with the inanity of the bourgeoisie and the sufferings of the
down-and-outs.</P>
<P>   "Tango" opens on Mario Suarez (Miguel Angel Sola), a
choreographer in mourning for his lost love, as he recounts
his ecstatic days with Laura Fuentes (Cecilia Narova).  When
a mafioso who owns 50% of of Mario's show, Angelo Larroca
(Juan Luis Galiardo), suggests that Mario audition Angelo's
girl friend Elena Flores (Mia Maestro), Mario falls in love with
the 23-year-old beauty and asks her to live with him despite
Angelo's warning that he will kill her if she ever left him.  In
the most touching scene of the movie, Mario is on his first
dinner-date with the young dancer and spills his feelings to
her: "I feel energetic as a boy and want to act like it...I enjoy
a girl of 18.  Is that unseemly?  Where are my youthful
illusions?  I feel my life is superficial and that I'm just trying to
avoid sinking in the muck."</P>
<P>   If only Saura gave more vent to the story!  It's not that the
narrative is original, but the Spanish director shows here that
he has a gift for dialogue as well as for the dance.  Instead,
the exchanges appear to serve largely as a break from the
frequent dancing, though Saura does demonstrate his feel for
variety more than he did with "Flamenco."  He has the men
dancing separately from the women; two women dancing
seductively with each other as do two men; and a variety of
tangos performed in ballrooms as well as on the stage.  Lalo
Shifrin's original score points up the seductiveness of the
music to the tango, while Emilio Basaldua's design
transforms a set in a Buenos Aires suburb into a surreal
dream, vivid with reds while abundant in contrasting whites
and blacks.  People from eight to eighty twist their bodies
bewitchingly.  The most vibrant scene in the film occurs as
the dancers perform a re-enactment of the terror faced by the
people after the infamous coup of 1976 when several
thousand Argentinians simply disappeared. The entire film is
unified by a strong performance from Miguel Angel Sola as
the aging overseer of the troupe.</P>
<P>   Early on, the maestro of the dance company says, "I want
to see one body with four legs."  This statement pretty much
sums up the allure of the tango, perhaps the world's sexiest
dance, and for the major part of the movie we've got bodies
and legs in abundance.</P>
