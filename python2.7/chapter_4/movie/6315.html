<P>Good things, they say, come in threes. Well, not quite. In rapid
succession I saw the Irish-made "Michael Collins" (Best Film, Best Actor
at the Venice Festival), the English-made "Secrets and Lies" (Best Film,
Best Actress at the Cannes Festival), and the shot-in-Mexico by an
Australian director American-made "Romeo and Juliet." The first two were
fine. The third put me to sleep intermittently, which precludes a
review.</P>
<P>"Michael Collins" is an ambitious, successful reconstruction of the last
years of its eponymous hero (in movie terms), who is also a hero in
terms of Ireland's history. Not for every Irish person or faction
however. The picture has caused controversy in the United Kingdom and
Ireland, while in America it has been very well received, with no
flare-ups. Public and the critics, rightly shying away from past Irish
politics -- a maze for which very few outsiders are qualified to pass
judgment -- have looked at the film  qua  film, as the portrait of an
exceptional leader about whom little is generally known. Even Irish-born
Liam Neeson ("Schindler's List"), admits that before he got the part he
had only vague notions about Collins.  </P>
<P>If nothing else, this work introduces to the masses of filmgoers a
historical figure of capital importance. It does it in a controlled,
thoughtful and, for most of us, credible way, accurate within the bounds
of cinema's possibilities. That's no mean service. It reaches beyond its
many artistic or "entertainment" values into expanding one's knowledge
of history. </P>
<P>That's what movies have often done, including the biographical ones
("biopics") that presented mostly schlocky, romanticized and dubious
screen lives that had little to do with realities. Still, to mention
only one country, it is through motion pictures that most people outside
Mexico got their first acquaintance with figures such as Pancho Villa,
Juarez or Zapata.</P>
<P>To help orient the viewer, here is a sketchy chronology of matters Irish
in the early 20th century.</P>
<P>1912. Third Home Rule bill introduced . Ulstermen resist.
1913. Irish Volunteers vs. Ulster Volunteers
1914 .World War I
1915. Sir Roger Casement goes to Germany for help, gets only antiquated
weapons.
1916. Casement arrested upon returning to Ireland. Monday April 24,
Easter Rising. Between 1,000  and 2,000 Republican fighters involved.
They are put down in under a week. Executions of their leaders Patrick
Pearse, Tom Clarke, and 13 others.  Sinn Fein formed, led by Eamon de
Valera. Republicans set up their provisional government. IRA organized
vs. British administration. Violence: IRA vs. Irish police and the
English soldiers (the Black and Tans).
1920. Britain passes the Government of Ireland Act, divides the country
between Northern and Southern Ireland, both self-governing up to a point
-but only the Northern Parliament functioned.
1921. British Prime Minister Lloyd George negotiates with de Valera.
Slow results. Cease-fire. Anglo-Irish Treaty signed:  for Great Britain
by  Lloyd George; for Ireland by Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, et
al. Irish Free State becomes self-governing dominion with he British
Commonwealth. Pro-treaty faction (led by Michael Collins) and
anti-treaty faction (led by de Valera) fight civil war. Pro-treaty wins. 
1922. Collins, ambushed, is killed. He would have been 32 in two months.</P>
<P>Irish author and film director Neil Jordan has given us, among others,
such excellent pictures as "The Company of Wolves," "Mona Lisa," and
"The Crying Game."  "Michael Collins" was planned and nurtured for 13
years. It  follows its protagonist from the Easter Rising to his
assassination. </P>
<P>The opening sets the tone of violent action, excellent production values
and superb camera work. Cinematographer Chris Menges (Oscars for"The
Mission" and "The Killing Fields")   films fluidly without calling
attention to his skills, lights the sets naturally, without artificial
fill-ins. The word "exquisite" comes to mind, paradoxically, since so
much drama and tragedy are shown. </P>
<P>What is also very subtle is that in the early scenes of fighting,
surrender, brutality and executions we get our first but almost last
contrast between the British and the Irish accents. Only Irish tones
will be heard, until Churchill picks "the elite of the British Secret
Service" to fight the fighters. Even then, the most poignant  parts are
the fratricidal, Irish vs. Irish ones.</P>
<P>>From the Rising we cut to 1918. Collins and his best friend Harry Boland
(Aidan Quinn) have been released from prison. The eloquent Michael
renews his incitement to resistance. New action follows, supenseful,
vivid,energetic and free of false gung-ho heroics.</P>
<P>Collins was 28 then. Liam Neeson was 43 when the film was made. Some
suspension of disbelief is in order, and perhaps - granted that the
Irish have great facility with speech- it also applies to the
self-assured, quick-thinking and -planning Collins shown. No Method
hesitations, aahs and ahems here. Even so, one gets caught up in
Collins's humanity, struggles and toughness. He sends a message to the
Irish police :" Any collaborating with the Army of Occupation will be
punished by death. You have been warned."</P>
<P>Collins - it is historically true - was the inventor of a special kind
of guerrilla warfare. Neil Jordan says that his tactics were copied by
independence movements around the world, from Mao in China to Shamir in
Israel. Why not add Vietnam and the resistance (and collaboration) in
Nazi-occupied Europe too? </P>
<P>The acting, a tad romanticized, is uniformly impressive. Collins-Neeson
towers over all the performers, he IS the film, with all the others as
supporting cast. Among them, two stand out. The ambiguous, manipulative
Eamon de Valera who became Sinn Fein's president in 1918, thrice prime
minister with short interruptions (1932-1959) and President (1959-73). 
This best known of Irish politicians is played with  marvelous, dour
shiftiness by Alan Rickman, as a near-villain. His thorn in Collins's
flesh is one of the main lines the plot follows. There is also Stephen
Rea ("The Crying Game") as the mole Ned Broy, perfect as the humble
"little man" who risks and loses his life to pass on information to
Collins. Broy is a composite figure of three characters.</P>
<P>Setting aside controversial aspects (one of them being a car bomb that
some say did not exist at the time), a minor lack in the movie is that
we see of Collins mostly the activist-politician-leader while we don't
really know what makes him tick as a person. Of course, this dimension
would have lengthened the film considerably. There's also a small
annoyance as the private Collins is limited to his affair with  Kitty
Kiernan and to this rivalry with  best friend Harry for the lady's love.
While Kitty did exist, the cutting to parenthetical sentimental scenes
is  intrusive and superfluous. Julia Roberts plays her with charm and a
good Irish accent at first. Later the accent disappears. Later yet it
becomes American.</P>
<P>The overall movie and the specific Collins role are strong enough to
resist small objections. Collins, as a warrior turned statesman and
peace-maker, becomes exponentially a likable, truly heroic figure who
affects us viscerally and intellectually. Perhaps he is best summed up
when he says of the British " I hate them not for their race [...} but
for what the've done to us by breeding hate in us."</P>
