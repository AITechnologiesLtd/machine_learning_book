<P>I guess everybody and their uncle is going to compare this movie to BLUE
STREAK and ENEMY OF THE STATE, so let me get that out of the way up front.
Yes, this film definitely has elements from both flicks! From the former, we
have the "funny thief going to jail and being the only one with knowledge of
the stash's whereabouts" element, and from the latter we have the
"technological mumbo-jumbo tracking of an unsuspecting man" angle. So what's
different? Well, despite not being as funny as BLUE STREAK, it does have
more action. And despite not having as much action as ENEMY OF THE STATE, it
does have more humor. Actually, now that I think about it...it's pretty much
a mix of the two!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A two-bit thief gets thrown in jail for stealing shrimp. While in jail, he's
given some information by an associate of the villain as to the whereabouts
of about $42 million in gold. The associate dies soon thereafter but the
government needs to capture the villain, so what do they do? They release
the two-bit thief, implant a tracking device in his jaw and wait until the
villain catches up to him. Simple enough?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A decent action/comedy ride but probably a little too familiar for most
seasoned moviegoers. Credit Jamie Foxx for boosting this film's quotient
with many funny lines, and director Fuqua for jazzing the film up with a
Tony Scott-ish brush, but don't expect the film to toss too many surprises
your way or offer anything very original. Of course, one could argue that
I've seen too many movies in my day and that my opinion regarding
originality is tainted therein (okay, Mrs. JoBlo loved it and might've
mentioned that I was being too critical...doh!), but that wasn't the only
thing about the movie that didn't blow my pipes. The humor was fast and
furious during the first half hour of the film, but unfortunately absent for
much of its second half. There were also too many shots of people sitting in
the "tracking" room, listening to action taking place. Howsabout showing us
more of that action, folks?!</P>
<P>Having said all that, the film is actually a perfect video movie! It's got a
fun comedic element, a couple of cool car sequences, gun play, a grandiose
plot line which is pretty ridiculous when you really think about it (way too
many people chasing this one guy!), a hip soundtrack and David Morse playing
the ultimate A-hole once again. And he's not even the bad guy! (I'm not
giving anything away here...we know who the bad guy is from the start).
Actually, that's one thing that did bother me quite some. Why do these
government agents always have to be such one-dimensional pricks? I mean,
c'mon fellas...lighten up a bit, there's more to life than just catching bad
guys. How about giving them just a little depth from time to time? Doug
Hutchison was decent as the villain, with a hint of John Malkovich's
Oscar-nominated villainous role from IN THE LINE OF FIRE mixed in for fun.
So there you have it...the film is okay, provides enough laughs, action and
drama to satisfy your average movie-goer looking for a good time out, but
for originality, unpredictability and a quenching aftertaste, this movie
doesn't really cut it. So there's the bait...are you gonna bite?</P>
<P>PS: As mentioned earlier, Mrs. JoBlo loved this movie and especially the
performance put forth by the villain, Doug Hutchison. As it turns out, we
saw this film at the Montreal Film Festival with director Fuqua, Foxx and
Hutchison present in the audience, so the Mrs. was nice enough to approach
Doug after the show and praise his performance. Hutchison was very gracious
and delivered two sweet kisses onto the Missus' cheeks. Hmmmm...now that I
think about it, what the heck was that all about?! Since when do these guys
kiss their fans...gotta go speak to the Missus... :)</P>

<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Jamie Foxx's birth name is Eric Bishop. He chose the androgynous "Jamie"
because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage
nights (Jamie began his career as a standup comic). Jamie was a quarterback
in high school, auditioned for Cuba Gooding Jr's football player role in
JERRY MAGUIRE and finally starred as a quarterback in Oliver Stone's 1999
football movie ANY GIVEN SUNDAY. He was chosen after Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs
left the project over "creative differences".
This is director Antoine Fuqua's second film. His first was 1998's THE
REPLACEMENT KILLERS. He has been married to beautiful actress Lela Rochon
since 1999. He's also the man behind Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise" music
video, as well as Prince's "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World".
