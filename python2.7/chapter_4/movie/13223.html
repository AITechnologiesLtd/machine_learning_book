<P>Because I take for granted that Oscar Wilde the writer, the man and his wit
are familiar to the film's potential public, I will not go into a general
intro. Wilde's homosexuality (a crime under English law until the late
1960s), his famous affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, and the ensuing trials
that finished off poor Oscar, have made him a "cause celebre" --if I am not
mistaken, the first of that nature in modern history. Understandably,all
this has made of Wilde a patron saint of gay artists.</P>
<P>Among the many cinema genres, few can be as difficult and as vulnerable to
criticism as the biographical picture. Biopics are compromises. To relate a
life -- or part of one -- and remain faithful to history in two hours of
film is an impossibility, one that is even nastier than screen adaptations
of major novels. Condensations, simplifications, selected episodes are
unavoidable.</P>
<P>A case in point is the set of biopics directed by William Dieterle in the
1930s and early 1940s. They were all reverent works on major figures: Louis
Pasteur (with Paul Muni, Oscared), Florence Nightingale, Emile Zola (Best
Picture 1937, also with Muni), Juarez (with Muni), Reuter (with
E.G.Robinson), Dr. Erlich (Robinson) Well-made, using major actors in both
main and supporting roles, these works were big popular hits in their time.
But today, with  audiences and critics, movies in that style would get a
much more cautious reception. Even the sacrosanct epic "Napoleon" (1927, by
Abel Gance) might be --but is not-- faulted for historical inaccuracies.</P>
<P>Dieterle and his likes represented the old school of biopics. After a
transition period (e.g. Wilson, The Desert Fox, Viva Zapata) came the new
school, in which no two of the better films followed the same strategy.
Creative and unconventional treatments days were given so such masterful
works as --and I cite a few pell-mell --Raging Bull, Van Gogh, Chaplin, Joe
Hill, Lenny, Lawrence of Arabia, Malcolm X, Tous les Matins du Monde,
Vincent and Theo, Stevie, Camille Claudel, Rosa Luxemburg, Hanussen, An
Angel at My Table, Ed Wood...</P>
<P>Although Wilde, was not an easy item to tackle, it acquits itself
honorably. There must have been good rapport between director and writer.
Brian Gilbert, who made the funny, witty Vice Versa, the underrated Not
Without My Daughter, then Tom and Viv, opted here for a Masterpiece
Theatre/Ivory-Merchant style, unrevolutionary but fitting the subject.
Versatile novelist-playwright Julian Mitchell is the author of many
scenarios, including those of Arabesque, Another Country, Vincent and Theo,
August (the directorial debut of Anthony Hopkins)-- not to mention nine
episodes of that civilized delight, the Inspector Morse TV series.</P>
<P>Mitchell had already worked on another gay theme I know of, in his
prize-winning stage-play  Another Country which is about  1930s students
public-school students for whom homosexuality was trendy. Years later, as
in the notorious Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean case, several government
officials were found spying for the Soviet Union. A very good film was made
of this. It starred Rupert Everett. The script was by Mitchell.</P>
<P>For the current movie --the third about Wilde--  Mitchell  based his
scenario on the admirable biography by Richard Ellmann. The great scholar
and critic  finished this long labor of love as he was dying of Lou Gehrig'
s disease.He died in March 1987. The book appeared in early 1988. There is
no way for a film script to reconstruct a 680-page volume. The scenario
wisely opted for  selective choices and inspirations. It is faithful to
Ellmann's belief that Wilde was as original and major  a writer, and a
cultural influence, as he was a man who invented his own public persona, as
wit, esthete, dandy, poseur, society lion and, among much else, a sly
critic of the middle and upper classes of England, the very people who were
the butt of Wilde's plays yet applauded them.</P>
<P>The film does not go into Wilde's Irish and English past and upbringing. It
plunges right away into an already established Oscar who marries Constance.
His wife, in older parlance "gave him two boys".</P>
<P>Robert Ross, a younger houseguest, reveals to Wilde that he (Oscar) is
really a homosexual. A relationship starts between the two. It is followed
by others, culminates in the love affair between Wilde and handsome, some
20 years younger Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie").</P>
<P>It's a bizarre affair. Oscar's love is steadfast, while the capricious,
self-spoiled Bosie blows hot and cold, introduces Oscar to lower class
people, often insults, hurts, exploits, taunts him and is despicable. He
flaunts their couple in public,also taunts his father. The latter, played
by Tom Wilkinson --who has a very different role in The Full Monty-- is
here the wealthy Marquess of Queensberry, a crude, rude, violent sportsman
whom Bosie hates. (He is the same Lord Queensberry after whom the basic
codes for boxing were named, although another sportsman wrote them).</P>
<P>Delightful is the movie's inclusion of some aspects of Wilde's enormously
growing fame as a playwright, plus much Wildean humor, wit, and the
expected Wildean thoughts and epigrams. But concurrently as well as
exponentially, we see the sadness of the man's public and private life, the
unavoidable troubles and scandals. The tragedy, latent throughout the
writer's life, now springs out of the closet. It becomes all the more
painful to watch since Wilde is a most likable fellow, generous to a fault,
and never really inflicting harm or hurt on others.</P>
<P>Actor Stephen Fry is an uncanny match for Wilde. He even looks like him,
though taller, less rotund, and with a face not so soft as in the
photographs of Wilde. Fry, also a writer and a wit, temperamental,
unpredictable, rather sweet, openly gay, is a rare case of perfect casting.
Superior too is the casting of Lord Alfred Douglas and that of  Robert
Ross. Robbie remains through thick and thin Oscar's true friend and helper,
and the voice of reason.</P>
<P>Because we know how everything comes out, the earlier and/or some lighter
scenes are made suspenseful as we wait for the axe to fall. And we wish
that the so-smart Oscar had not been so dumb as to be prodded by Bosie into
initiating that terrible libel suit against Queensberry. If there was a
time when "don't ask, don't tell" was the best possible advice, it was in
Victorian days.</P>
