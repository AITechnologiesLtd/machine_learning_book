<PRE>October, 1999</PRE>
<P>For over 90 minutes, The Story of Us innocuously runs through the 
projector. At film's end, the audience is not shocked. There are no 
great revelations, massive special effects or even unforgettable 
moments. That is, however, not to say that The Story of Us limps along, 
drags, or even approaches boredom. The movie is just a sweet and 
poignant work that is not today's typical Hollywood fare.</P>
<P>Ben (Bruce Willis) and Kate Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) have been married 
for 15 years and seem to be the ordinary couple. They have two kids, 
they each have their own job and close friends. But something has 
happened, and after they drop their children off for camp one summer, 
they each go home- Kate to the house and Ben to an apartment. The 
tagline on the film is "Can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage?" 
Evidently not. But over the course of the 8 week summer, Ben and Kate 
will discover if a separation can survive 8 weeks of separation.</P>
<P>Hall of fame singer, songwriter and guitarist Eric Clapton is credited 
with the music for this film. That is a little deceiving. Clapton did 
perform all the original music; the movie just neglects to mention that 
that entails all of one song. Good as it may be, that single track is 
overplayed to a point of annoyance, accompanying almost all of the 
film's montages. I only noted one other vocal performance, and it was 
indeed by Clapton. The song was "Wonderful Tonight," which I can assure 
you was not written for this production.</P>
<P>Willis and Pfeiffer are both at their best in this film. She is near 
perfect for her role, and he seems to have had no trouble adjusting from 
the role of "Oil drilling space hero" in last summer's Armageddon to 
"hopeless romantic" in this picture. A strong supporting cast fills the 
other roles in this predominately two person movie. Rita Wilson, Paul 
Reiser and Rob Reiner are all a pleasure to watch as the closest 
confidants of the separated couple. Also, Tim Matheson rather nicely 
portrays a divorced parent who Kate begins to date.</P>
<P>The Story of Us is not a typical film. Almost every movie these days has 
a side plot involving either a married couple or a close boyfriend and 
girlfriend. But those are extra scenes meant to attract female audiences 
and make certain films considered "date movies." The Story of Us does 
just the opposite. It even takes the reverse one step further. Rather 
than employing a side plot, the movie stays focused and never ventures 
astray from Ben and Kate's family. There was a time when singular plot 
films like this were normal. But today it is a rarity, and when strict 
one-plotters (especially romances) romances do surface, it is not often 
that they are of this quality.</P>
<P>---Editorial Criticism of the Motion Picture Association of America 
(MPAA)---</P>
<P>The MPAA rated The Story of Us "R". That means that children under the 
age of 17 cannot see this film, unless accompanied by a parent or 
guardian. The MPAA also rated Fight Club, the other major film opening 
the week of October 15, "R". Here is a comparison of the two films' 
offenses:</P>
<PRE>The Story of Us</PRE>
<PRE>    a.. References to masturbation
    b.. References to sex
    c.. Foul language
    d.. Family problems</PRE>
<PRE>Fight Club</PRE>
<PRE>    a.. Two near-castration scenes
    b.. Numerous instances of foul language
    c.. Sex
    d.. Numerous scenes of people fighting
    e.. Extensive blood
    f.. Human fat oozing about freely
    g.. A man shooting himself in the head, as the camera shows the 
        bullet go all the way through
    h.. Reference to transsexual traits</PRE>
<P>The MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, seem to believe that giving an 
identical warning to parents about these films will suffice. That's 
funny, because my parents always told me that sex and family were normal 
and okay things in life. I guess they skipped the parts about violence 
and destruction.</P>
