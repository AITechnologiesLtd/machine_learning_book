<PRE>DIRTY WORK
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Some nights during the latest dark period of "Saturday Night 
Live," I turned on the show and was surprised to find myself actually 
laughing. Nine times out of ten, that surprise laughter came from 
something Norm Macdonald said. Like no one else, Macdonald can 
make me laugh by saying a single word, no matter how many times he 
says it. If any other comedian repeatedly milked words like "crack," 
"anal rape" and "whore" for laughs, I'd find it absolutely unfunny.</P>
<P>        There's something about his delivery that can give value to 
the most mediocre writing. I don't know exactly what that is, but 
DIRTY WORK would suck without it. Lines that would make me 
cringe in other summer comedies made me laugh this time, and almost 
make me recommend the movie. Had the movie occasionally included 
a half-intelligent joke in its parade of scatalogical and sexual innuendo 
humor, and had the movie not allowed Macdonald's character to be 
gang raped in jail, I would have given it a full thumbs-up.</P>
<P>        As it is, DIRTY WORK is the most politically incorrect movie 
of the year to date, the kind of movie that has multiple punchlines 
involving prostitutes, incest and dirty old men. It's one dirty old man 
(Jack Warden, still recovering from those PROBLEM CHILD movies) 
in particular that provides most of the plot for the movie. Warden 
plays the father of Macdonald's best friend and, in a span of a few 
minutes, Warden has a heart attack and tells Macdonald he's also his 
father.</P>
<P>        If that weren't enough plot contrivance, the doctor (Chevy 
Chase) tells Macdonald that Warden's only hope for survival is a heart 
transplant. Since Chase owes $50,000 to a bookie, he sets the price for 
a transplant at exactly that amount... and we all know Chase is in dire 
need of $50,000 right about now. Meanwhile, Macdonald and his best 
friend ponder what they could possibly do to earn that kind of money 
in two weeks' time.</P>
<P>        They get jobs at a theater run by Don Rickles, whose cameo 
isn't nearly as funny or politically incorrect as the rest of the movie. 
Rickles' drill sergeant approach to movie theater management prompts 
Macdonald and his friend to get back at him, which the other 
employees offer them money to do. A little bell goes off in their 
heads -- they can make money getting paid to perform revenge on 
other people. There are plenty of revenge scenes in the movie, some of 
them funny, a lot of them not, but with Macdonald at the helm, he 
managed to pull a laugh out of me every time I thought I was going to 
regret coming to see this.</P>
<P>        Not that DIRTY WORK is a classy or original movie by any 
stretch of the imagination. The plot is ridiculous and predictable, 
involving a local land baron (Christopher McDonald, still recovering 
from that LEAVE IT TO BEAVER movie) who hires them to destroy 
the same building that happens to be inhabited by the grandmother of 
a woman Norm has a crush on. Things begin looking bleak for our 
protagonists around the two-thirds mark, as they tend to do in generic 
comedies, but there's never any doubt things will end happily.</P>
<P>        A word for those of you who will no doubt complain that I 
gave DIRTY WORK the same rating as a classier **1/2 movie of your 
choice -- this is a tasteless movie without any socially redeeming 
qualities. It is, however, funny. Macdonald brings all his "Weekend 
Update" charm to the big screen, although I found myself constantly 
wishing he'd drop that "Note to self" gag. It never worked on "SNL" 
and, even worse, it turned out to be part of the plot here.</P>
<P>        Those of you who have seen other movies starring "SNL" cast 
members know that none of them can have just one "Saturday Night 
Live" person. The parade starts with Chevy Chase and continues with 
an Adam Sandler cameo and a running appearance from Chris Farley, 
in one of his final appearances. DIRTY WORK is more entertainment 
than you'll get most Saturday nights around 11:30/10:30 central.</P>
