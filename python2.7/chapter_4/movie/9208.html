<P>     Long-time readers of this space will recall that I have never
promoted the myth of critical objectivity.  I am merely a man, folks, a
flesh-and-blood film fan with preferences and pet peeves just like
everyone else.  Brilliant special effects will never move me like a
brilliant script will.  I'm indifferent about baseball, but I love
baseball movies.  "Heartwarming comedies" leave me cold.  I'm too easy on
Woody Allen sometimes.  And so on.</P>
<P>     THE MATCHMAKER appears to have been made with a direct network
connection to my cinematic soft spots.  Put Janeane Garofolo in a leading
role, and I'm yours to lose.  Set a story in Ireland, and the battle for
my affections is half won.  Put Janeane Garofolo in a leading role in a
story set in Ireland...well, now you're just not playing fair.  Their
combined charm is irresistable, flimsy though the story may be.</P>
<P>     Garofolo plays Marcy Tizard, a second-tier worker for the re-election
campaign of Massachusetts senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders).  Trailing
badly in the pools, McGlory and his campaign manager Nick Ward (Denis
Leary) come up with a desperate plan to win over the state's Irish vote:
McGlory will visit with his actual kin in Ireland.  The job of actually
finding those kin is left to Marcy, who is sent to the small coastal town
of Ballinagra to dig up McGlory's roots.  Little does she know that she'll
be landing in the middle of the town's annual match-making festival, or
that the town's leading matchmaker (Milo O'Shea) has his eye on fixing up
Marcy with an enigmatic local fellow named Sean (David O'Hara).</P>
<P>     On a number of levels, it's clear that THE MATCHMAKER needs a bit
more fleshing out.  Character development for Marcy is sorely lacking,
leaving plenty of unanswered questions about her as she heads to Ireland.
What is her life like in America?  What kind of romantic history does she
bring to her relationship with Sean?  Why is she working for a pea-brain
like McGlory whose campaign slogan ("Hey Ho Let's Go") is a Ramones lyric?
In short, who is Marcy, besides a character for Janeane Garofolo to play?
Her relationship with Sean (nicely played by David O'Hara as a fiery
idealist) is better developed than you find in most romantic comedies, but
we never understand why it might be truly important to Marcy.  It's all
very pleasant, in an inconsequential sort of way.</P>
<P>     Then again, if you add up all the things about THE MATCHMAKER which
are very pleasant, you have a fairly pleasant film experience.  First
there is Garofolo herself, a screen presence unlike any other in film.
Acerbic, smart and unconventionally beautiful, Garofolo improves a story
by her mere presence.  She doesn't have as strong a character to latch on
to as she had in THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS, but she's still an energetic
presence who's easy to root for.  O'Hara is also quite pleasant, as is
O'Shea as the ethically shaky matchmaker.  And of course there's the
scenery and the local Irish color, which is very pleasant indeed.  </P>
<P>     THE MATCHMAKER has a heavy strain of fish-out-of-water comedy to it,
but it rarely reeks of formula thanks to Mark Joffe's low-key direction
and Garofolo's ability to underplay a reaction take.  Still, as the 
film strolls along towards its conclusion with a few unnecessary
intrusions by the political sub-plot, it might be seen as a bit uninspired
and tedious, objectively speaking.  I'm not objectively speaking, of
course.  One viewer might find little to like about THE MATCHMAKER.
Another -- who shall remain nameless -- might spend 95 minutes smiling at
a friendly face in a friendly place.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 match shticks:  6.</PRE>
