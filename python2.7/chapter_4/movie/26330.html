DREAM LOVER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Too many thrillers in 1990s relied on the same formula -
protagonists having to deal with seemingly innocent and
pleasant individual who is in reality a dangerous
psychopath. So, whenever authors of such thriller tried to
evade or bring fresh spin for this formula, results were
usually better than average. One of such examples is DREAM
LOVER, 1994 thriller written and directed by Nicholas Kazan.</P>
<P>Protagonist of this film is Ray Reardon (played by James
Spader), successful and rich architect who is recovering
from the painful divorce. On one of the parties he meets
Lena (played by Madchen Amick), beautiful and mysterious
woman who would arouse his curiosity as well as his lust.
Two of them gradually start a relationship, end in bed, get
married and raise a family. Ray's idyll begins to crack when
strange incidents begin to cast doubt about both Lena's
identity. Faced with the great possibility that he was lied
for years, Ray loses grip on reality and all that leads to
unexpected finale.</P>
<P>Nicholas Kazan, son of famous director Elia Kazan and
well-established screenwriter of his own, reverses 1990s
thriller formula by avoiding use of dangerous lunatic as
convenient villain. Psychotic character in this film is
actually the protagonist, while villain happens to be normal
person with immoral, but quite understandable agenda. Kazan
also reverses the formula by turning protagonist's
affliction into advantage instead of weakness. Rather
unconventional and totally surprising ending is also one of
the advantages of the film. Acting is very fine, with James
Spader allowing darker overtones to manifest in his screen
personality. Madchen Amick, one of TWIN PEAKS beauties, is
also quite impressive as femme fatale, and male audience
would probably appreciate her willingness to perform nude in
front of cameras. Unfortunately, Kazan shows some problems
in pacing - the ending is somewhat too abrupt, and the
scenes featuring Ray's insane fantasies seem too distracting
and "artsy". However, DREAM LOVER is definitely film worth
watching and one of the most underated 1990s thrillers.</P>
