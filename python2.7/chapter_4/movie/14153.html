<PRE>Armageddon</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1998 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: Michael Bay
Cast: Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Peter
Stormare and others</P>
<P>The end of the world - many times invoked (in vain) by Jehova's
Witnesses - now finally seems to loom over mankind. A giant asteroid
races towards Earth and threatens to put an end to all life. NASA
hopes to destroy it by drilling a hole in its surface and explode an
atomic bomb in it. For this job they hire Harry Stamper (Bruce
Willis), a drilling expert with an international reputation, to take
his team to the asteroid and solve the problem once and for all. Time
is running out because the approaching object was discovered late
only when all of a sudden showers of meteorites rained down on the
USA and caused considerable damage. The newly asigned astronauts
can't waste much time on training, they just have to pass a physical.
And the race against time commences.</P>
<P>CHAOS IN SPACE would have been a good name for the movie, but
ARMAGEDDON of course sounds more dramatic. After DEEP IMPACT this is
the second movie this year dealing with the subject of celestial
bodies colliding with our planet. But compared to DEEP IMPACT this
movie's motto is: Think Big. The asteroid about to hit Mother Earth
is the size of Texas. The asteroid that ended the Cretaceous period
65 million years ago and left a 200 km wide crater is thought to have
been 10 to 20 km in diameter. An object the size of Texas is likely
to make a much bigger hole. Our solar system hasn't suffered
collisions of this kind since it emerged in this remote corner of the
galaxy.</P>
<P>But let's suspend disbelieve on this issue. It's a very dramatic idea
that would have made a thrilling movie loaded with special effects.
The special effects are quite stunning, and the audience doesn't have
to wait till the last minute. New York is knocked flat and a few
other sights outside the USA are doomed as well, for balance's sake.
The movie starts with a bang. It's believable that the asteroid is
discovered only when it's already quite near Earth. Near collisions
with asteroids have happened in recent years as everybody can verify
with NASA. </P>
<P>Harder to believe is the fact that a bunch of civilians is shot into
space to save the Earth. It's like watching a bunch of small boys
play astronauts in a real life setting. A bunch of boys who watched
STAR WARS too many times. Or perhaps they were never allowed to play
out their fantasies with action dolls. Sorry, but I guess to really
enjoy those scenes you simply need a Y-chromosome.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is in his element for the first time since the DIE HARD
series. And he doesn't have to deal with mere trifles like
skyscrapers, airports or major cities. He can be a true heroe and
save the Earth. His adversary is just a dead rock instead of a group
of vicious terrorists, but who cares. The asteroid gives him at least
as much trouble as all the terrorists in the DIE HARD movies. Just
one question: what's next? Saving the solar system or the whole
galaxy? It doesn't get much bigger than that, but then he may soon be
too old for the tough hero part anyway. So let's not begrudge him the
triumph over the forces of nature. He uses his opportunity to be
mucho macho. His daughter doesn't have much to say, but with a father
like that she probably should be content to sit adoringly at his feet
and do whatever he bids.</P>
<P>The rest of the team remains liveless. Some of them are living
targets anyway. Killing off a few less important heroes adds to the
suspense. Steve Buscemi can't save the day. The only bright spot in
the movie is Peter Stormare as Russian cosmonaut Lev Andropov who for
the last 18 months lived  a solitary life on a Russian space station
and therefore is a bit strange. Thus he provides the humor for this
noisy action flick by messing up his new American friends with his
bizarre ideas. He's the best choice for this wacky part, even if you
can't help asking yourself why a brilliant actor like him accepts a
part in this kind of project.</P>
<P>ARMAGEDDON will probably make people happy who thought that there
wasn't enough action in DEEP IMPACT. Go find a theater with a big
panorama screen and a digital sound system that is turned up till the
seats vibrate. Don't see it on video. With the benefit of a big
screen and great sound gone ARMAGEDDON is just an embarrassment. The
noisily promoted movie lives up to the promises of its makers only in
terms of volume.</P>
