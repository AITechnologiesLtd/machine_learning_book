<PRE>                                   HEAVY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               CAPSULE: HEAVY is both a story and a film
          about how film works.  It is at once an intense
          emotional experience and a study of how dialogue
          affects the tone and strength of a film.  The story
          is of the people who can nightly be found at
          small-town tavern, people whose lives are basically
          the same from one day to the next.  The film
          especially concentrates on the overweight cook,
          Victor, a child-man almost too shy to talk and
          having a mid-life crisis.  HEAVY packs more of an
          emotional wallop than any film so far this year.
          Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is a familiar viewpoint that color in a film actually distracts
the viewer and mutes the emotional impact of the film's camerawork.
What is less commonly observed is that dialogue may actually do much
the same thing.  We have seen the overly florid gesturing of silent
film acting, much of which looks silly today.  But some silent films
were extremely intense emotional pieces in their day.  Perhaps as much
of the emotional potential of film was lost with sound film as was lost
with color.  HEAVY is a color film, and a sound film, but it functions
very much as a silent film would.  Almost all of the story is conveyed
either in visual images or in single lines of dialogue, perhaps
appropriate to title cards in silent films.  Of course the film is not
lacking in dialogue, but the dialogue is almost never used to move the
plot along.  It adds a little color and background interest to the
film, but it is rarely used to advance the plot.  This is a film that
owes much more to the traditions of silent film than to those of the
sound era.  By forcing the viewer to carefully watch the characters,
very different information can be imparted to the viewer and the
technique focuses attention on the emotions of the characters.</P>
<P>     Most of the action takes place in and around Pete and Dolly's
Restaurant, a bar and restaurant in a small New England town.  Pete has
been dead for years and his widow Dolly (Shelley Winters) still blames
waitress Delores (Deborah Harry in a surprisingly textured role) for a
liaison with Pete.  When Dolly hires an attractive teenager Callie (Liv
Tyler) to help out there is immediate resentment from Delores.  Caught
between the two is Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince), Dolly's son somewhere
in his 30s.  Victor is so stigmatized by his own obesity and so
dominated by his mother that it is all he can do to occasionally speak.
He is very much attracted to Callie but cannot bring himself to have a
conversation with her.  Instead he decides to try to reinvent himself,
taking up dieting and investigating a local cooking school.  But he
must fight the forces of his own inertia and that of his mother who
wants to keep him in his present job.  He fantasizes about being a hero
and saving Callie.  Soon Victor's life, which has been static for so
many years, starts to change violently.  His reaction and his behavior
when those changes come is totally unexpected.  Little of this are we
told about, it is almost all shown to us and Victor's quiet nature is
perfect for the visual style of storytelling.  The same story could
have been lightened by comedy but writer and director James Mangold
takes a very realistic approach and rarely strays from it.</P>
<P>     This is a very precisely directed film and it has many very nice
subtle touches.  As an example of the directing technique, to
underscore Victor's image of himself, there is a scene in which he
looks at a stack of photographs.  Gingerly he places each on a table
after looking at it.  When he gets to a picture of himself he puts it
down with a small slam.  Small and subtle touches do what another story
would simply tell with dialogue.</P>
<P>     In general the production values speak of a film made well on a
low budget.  The colors were not particularly rich, indicating a less-
expensive print.  But the performances are all very powerful.  Pruitt
Taylor Vince's acting gets more and more intense as the film goes on.
Mangold moves his story with a slow and deliberate speed, but
completely pulls the viewer into the lives of his characters and
particularly Victor's life.</P>
<P>     The usual way of saying it is that one "sees" a film, but for most
films much more of the story is conveyed in the dialogue than the
visuals.  HEAVY is truly a film one sees rather than hears.  Mangold's
experiment in visual storytelling may not have a lot of application to
other films, but it works extremely well in this film.   I would rate
HEAVY a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
