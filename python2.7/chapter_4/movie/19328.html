<PRE>                             MY LIFE SO FAR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I guess you're either one of those people who loves 1930's Scottish
coming-of-age stories, or you're not.</P>
<PRE>     Looks like I'm not.</PRE>
<P>     Narrated by the precocious Fraser (Norman), we tour the life of a
wee Scottish lad who seems brilliant beyond his years.  Fraser's life is
dominated by his large family, which runs a sphagnum moss plantation –
the only one in Europe, we're told (many times).  There's dad (Firth), a
Beethoven freak and spare-time inventor; mom (Mastrantonio in a bad
Scottish accent), the wallflower; Gamma (Harris), the gamma; crusty
Uncle Morris (McDowell – wasted in this role); and his child
fiancée/bride Eloise (Jacob).</P>
<P>     What a fine, dysfunctional family they make, what with dad's
inventions going awry, and both father and son making goo-goo eyes for
Eloise.  And when Fraser finds grandpa's old stash of Victorian-era
pornography stashed away in the attic, boy, look out!</P>
<P>     All of this tries to be very quaint and sweet, but turns out to be
perverse and disturbing, to say the least.  Dad is nothing short of a
lech, and in fact, all the adults in this picture are sorry role
models.  (No small wonder that the epilogue states that Fraser grew up
to be `a successful television executive.'  Fitting indeed.)</P>
<P>     MY LIFE SO FAR wants to be a hybrid of UNSTRUNG HEROES and COLD
COMFORT FARM, but lacks the charm of either of them.  Instead, it's just
a twisted little art movie that will probably get steamrollered on
release.</P>
<P>     The opening credits warn you that this `Based on a True Story.'
Why they picked *this* story to turn into a movie is beyond me.</P>
