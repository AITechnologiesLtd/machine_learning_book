<P>     TWILIGHT may end up being the most disappointing film of 1998.  It 
certainly holds that distinction to date, but I'm aware that there are 
ten months left in the year.  And let me emphasize that by 
"disappointing," I mean something that falls drastically short of my 
expectations.  That's different from "bad," which TWILIGHT certainly 
isn't.  There are pleasures to be found within, but this movie never 
comes close to living up to its potential.  It's like the baseball 
rookie phenom who's supposed to hit .300, but can't get his bat on the 
ball.  </P>
<P>     Look at the talent involved in TWILIGHT.  The three leads -- Paul 
Newman, Susan Sarandon, and Gene Hackman -- all have gold statuettes on 
their mantelpieces (and for good reason).  The supporting cast includes 
the always reliable James Garner, Stockard Channing, and M. Emmet Walsh, 
not to mention up-and-coming actress Reese Witherspoon.  The director, 
Robert Benton, has written and helmed such efforts as NOBODY'S FOOL and 
KRAMER VS. KRAMER.  The cinematographer, Polish-born Piotr Sobocinski, 
was one of Kieslowski's favorite collaborators, and did the photography 
for RED.  Considering all of this, it's no wonder that I had high 
expectations for TWILIGHT -- expectations it didn't come close to 
fulfilling.  </P>
<P>     The problem is the script, which could charitably be called 
unspectacular.  This is a B-movie screenplay with an A-level cast and 
crew.  Ultimately, no matter how talented the people making the film 
are, there's a limit to what they can do with a plot this contrived and 
predictable.  True, the high level of acting and rich, noir atmosphere 
keep viewers intrigued and involved, but, when the final credits start 
to roll, there's a vague sense of dissatisfaction.  The question 
foremost in my mind at that moment was "Is that all there is?"</P>
<P>     Paul Newman plays Harry Ross, an ex-cop turned ex-private 
investigator turned alcoholic.  He's in the twilight of his life, 
looking back on the wreckage of an existence that he's not especially 
proud of.  "When I started out," he remarks, "I had a wife and daughter.  
Now, I'm a drunk."  The only time TWILIGHT'S screenplay truly shines is 
when it contemplates questions of age and mortality.  Normally, 
mystery/thrillers have younger, stronger protagonists -- not white-
haired retirees who have to worry about prostate problems.  If nothing 
else, TWILIGHT captures a slice of the melancholia associated with 
growing old.</P>
<P>     Harry lives with his good friends, the actor/actress couple of Jack 
and Catherine Ames (Hackman and Sarandon).  In return for their 
hospitality, he does an occasional odd job for them.  His latest errand 
lands him in hot water.  What is supposed to be a routine transfer of a 
sealed manila envelope puts Harry on the wrong end of a gun wielded by 
another ex-cop (M. Emmet Walsh) -- only this guy has blood leaking from 
several bullet holes in his body.  Unsurprisingly, Harry soon finds 
himself involved in a web of intrigue that involves murder, blackmail, 
and a secret buried 20 years in the past.  Meanwhile, he learns that 
Jack is dying of cancer and Catherine is all-too-willing to have an 
affair if that's what Harry wants.</P>
<P>     TWILIGHT is classic potboiler stuff, and it's easy to figure out 
how things are going to turn out in the end.  The few twists and 
surprises are obvious and the seams are visible in the pedestrian 
screenplay.  Still, although the story isn't likely to stave off 
boredom, Newman's acting accomplishes that.  This isn't the actor's best 
work, but, even not in peak form, he is adept enough at his craft to 
create an engaging personality.  Harry may be caught in the midst of a 
silly plot, but we're still interested in how he gets out of his 
predicament and whether he makes peace with himself.  Sarandon is a 
wonderfully mature-yet-sultry femme fatale, Garner is enjoyable as one 
of Harry's old friends, and Witherspoon is fresh and sexy.  The only one 
who rubbed me the wrong way is Giancarlo Esposito, who plays a fatuous 
would-be sidekick.  </P>
<P>     TWILIGHT drips atmosphere.  Even though it's a contemporary tale, 
it has the feel of something set forty or fifty years ago.  But 
stylistic photography and solid acting aren't everything, and there are 
only so many plot imperfections such assets can mask.  TWILIGHT should 
have been a better movie.  It's rare that this much talent is assembled 
for a single production, and it seems criminal to waste it in this 
manner.  With a lesser cast, the film would have been easy to shrug off.  
But with this bunch, although the final product is undeniably better 
than it would have been with a group of secondary performers, the 
aftertaste is vaguely bitter.</P>
