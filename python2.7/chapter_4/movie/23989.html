<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Here they are, my all-time Top Five Things To Know About "High Fidelity":</P>
<P>1. The synopsis (well, every review's got to have a synopsis, right?).</P>
<P>Relationships and music, music and relationships -- that's pretty much
what "High Fidelity" is all about. John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a
thirtysomething record store owner whose longtime girlfriend Laura (Iben
Hjejle) has just left him. Watching her drive away, Rob makes up a list
of his top five worst break-ups, and is delighted that Laura hasn't made
the cut. At a crossroads in his life, Rob decides to revisit each of these
five former lovers (including half the cast of "The Haunting"). He hopes
that in so doing, he will finally figure out why all of his romantic
entanglements turn out disastrously. Meantime, he's also got to decide if
he's happy spending his days running a record store, or if he wants to get
something more out of life.</P>
<PRE>2. The star.</PRE>
<P>There can be little doubt that this movie turns on John Cusack's everyman
qualities. Cusack has always had a broad appeal, even when he's portrayed
such unusual characters as a professional assassin ("Grosse Pointe Blank")
and a puppeteer with a mystical connection to John Malkovich ("Being John
Malkovich"). In "High Fidelity", for once he's playing a character who
isn't larger-than-life. Rob Gordon is a pretty regular guy, with a regular
job and regular problems; it's hard not to relate, so the movie is
accessible on a very fundamental level. His overriding passion is music,
and his life is replete with its trappings, but not to the point where we 
feel alienated from him. For example, to help himself get over Laura, he
reorganizes his record collection. "Chronologically?" he's asked.   
"Autobiographically," he replies, and our gut reaction is no different   
than if he were eating cookie dough ice cream. Rob is a well-crafted
character, and Cusack's portrayal of him is spot on -- if its main
character weren't someone the audience could relate to, "High Fidelity"
would have been a flop.</P>
<P>The toughest aspect of Cusack's performance is the fact that he makes
frequent asides to the audience; indeed, in several cases these asides   
become full-blown soliloquies. But Cusack knows how to deliver a
monologue; he keeps them lively and interesting, without exaggerating for
effect. Indeed, these are some of "High Fidelity"'s most enjoyable scenes,
which is an accomplishment, given that this kind of filmmaking device
often comes across as stagy and dull.</P>
<PRE>3. The supporting cast.</PRE>
<P>Cusack might be the high point of "High Fidelity", but it doesn't hurt
that he's been placed in pretty talented company. Of particular note are 
Todd Louiso and Jack Black as Dick and Barry, Rob's employees at the
record store, die-hard music buffs who were hired as part-time help years
ago and haven't stopped showing up since. Barry is the loud and boisterous
one, while Dick is reserved and polite. Together, they form one of the
best comic double acts in quite some time. Also very good is Iben Hjejle
as Laura. Hjejle's is the film's most complex role: for much of the movie,
she has to be convincingly at odds with the protagonist, but at the same 
time not come across as "the villain", nor forget that Laura and Rob did
once care about each other -- and, perhaps, still do. The relationship   
between Rob and Laura is meant to be realistic, and even though we're
seeing everything from Rob's biased perspective, this sense of realism
would have been shattered had Hjejle's performance not been so moderate
and considered.</P>
<PRE>4. The cameos.</PRE>
<P>In addition to the movie's main cast, a number of popular actors have    
extended cameos in "High Fidelity". These are a lot of fun, especially
since several of the actors are playing either exaggerated versions of   
their public image, or else totally against type. For example, Tim Robbins
is cast as Ray, an irritating, ponytailed faux-intellectual who is Laura's
new love interest. One of the movie's funniest scenes depicts Rob
fantasizing about all the things he'd like to do Ray when the latter
confronts him over Laura. Needless to say, the fantasies are neither
pretty nor anything approximating reality. Catherine Zeta-Jones,
meanwhile, plays Rob's ex-girlfriend Charlie, a sensuous high-society    
type who may not be everything Rob remembers.</P>
<PRE>5. The script.</PRE>
<P>Based on the 1995 novel by Nick Hornby, "High Fidelity" is a hilarious
and eclectic look at love, but one which will likely ring true to many
viewers. Particularly interesting is the way the movie's version of events
is subordinate to Rob's views on his life. Our introduction to various   
characters and situations is colored by his opinions and memories, and so
even though it might feel like we're getting the whole story, there are  
times when we're really only getting a Rob-biased perspective on things.  
As Rob uncovers the misunderstandings and misconceptions which have
dominated his love life, so too do we.</P>
<P>Probably the only real downside to "High Fidelity" is a subplot about
Rob's desire to be a record producer. Although it does arise naturally
from the film's subject material, it nonetheless feels artificially      
appended to the movie, there mostly to give the events a typical Hollywood
ending. But "High Fidelity" doesn't really need this; its proper climax
comes fifteen minutes before the credits roll, and the extra material
ultimately feels like padding. Funny padding, yes, but padding
nonetheless.</P>
<P>But this is a minor flaw. "High Fidelity" is a fun, lightweight movie
which derives its laughs not from scripted routines but from experiences 
most anyone who's ever been in a relationship (or even just wanted to be 
in a relationship) will be familiar with. It is a film which draws its   
audience in slowly, and plays out gradually, and this may lose people     
looking for a more high-octane ride. But in its totality, "High Fidelity"
is an experience which is not just entertaining, but also very true.</P>
