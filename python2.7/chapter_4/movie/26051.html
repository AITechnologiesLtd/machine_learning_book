<P> Nurse Betty (2000) 4 stars out of 4. Starring Renee Zellweger, Morgan
Freeman, Greg Kinnear and Chris Rock. Screenplay by John C. Richards &
James Flamberg. Story by Richards. Directed by Neil LaBute. Rated R.</P>
<P> Sometimes a movie comes along that is so special, so out of the
ordinary that you want to embrace it as tightly as a long-lost relative.</P>
<P> Such a film is "Nurse Betty," a whimsical fairy tale as fragile and
spunky as its heroine. It is a movie with Oscar contender stamped all
over it.</P>
<P> Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is a sweet, young woman, a waitress in
the Tip Top, a small restaurant in Fair Oaks, Kan. She is married to
Del, a used car dealer with all the stereotypical vices associated with
those in that maligned profession.</P>
<P> Betty's one vice is her addiction to the soap opera "A Reason to Love,"
and her devotion to its hero, Dr. David Ravell.</P>
<P> One night, while in another part of the house watching a tape of her
soap, Del is in the living room negotiating a shady business deal with
two men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock). The pair turn
out to be hitmen who dispatch Del because he stole a package belonging
to their employer.</P>
<P> The brutality of the situations sends Betty into a fantasy world in
which she believes she is the long-lost fiancé of famous heart surgeon
Dr. David Ravell, and she decides to drive to Los Angeles to find him
and rekindle their relationship.</P>
<P> So, Betty packs her bags and hops into a Buick LeSabre taken from her
late husband's car lot and drives off. Coincidentally, and unknown by
Betty, the item Charlie and Wesley seek is secreted in the car.</P>
<P> Thus, while Betty begins her odyssey to L.A., Charlie and Wesley set
forth on one of their own seeking clues to the whereabouts of the
elusive woman.</P>
<P> Once in the land of dreams, Betty transforms herself into Nurse Betty,
gets a job at a hospital, makes a friend and acquires a roommate at the
same time, and begins her quest to find her Dr. David.</P>
<P> Fate is kind, and Betty comes face to face with her dream lover. In a
scene reminiscent of Peter Sellers' "Being There," Betty begins quoting
dialogue from old episodes of "A Reason to Love" to Dr. David, actually
actor George McCord (Greg Kinnear), who believing she is a determined
actress seeking a role on the soap, plays along as Dr. David.</P>
<P> That is about as much of the plot as I care to reveal without spoiling
the rest of this Capraesque story. Let us just say that Betty fulfills
her dreams.</P>
<P> One of the ironies of "Nurse Betty" is that it is directed by Neil
LaBute, who helmed such cynical offerings as "In the Company of Men" and
"Your Friends & Neighbors." "Nurse Betty" does not quite seem the
material for a director who has such a bleak outlook on the human
condition.</P>
<P> But LaBute pulls it off. He treats Betty with love and respect, neither
mocking nor criticizing her mental state.</P>
<P> This is not to say the movie is light fare. It has an edge and LaBute
stages some harrowing scenes of violence.</P>
<P> As Betty, Zellweger gives an outstanding performance. Within the
parameters of her manufactured world she acts rationally, sanely and
with utter conviction. She tightropes that thin line between sanity and
psychosis with the aplomb of a veteran acrobat. I rooted for her,
wanting to see her achieve happiness.</P>
<P> Zellweger's performance is charming. It is a turn that could - and
should - bring her an Academy Award nomination if not the statue itself.</P>
<P> Freeman's performance is wonderfully smart and controlled. As a veteran
hit man who takes pride in his work, he gradually falls in love with
Betty as he tracks her across the country.</P>
<P> Freeman is one of those actors who elevates weak material merely by his
presence. Presented with well-written material as in "Nurse Betty," his
work is stellar, whether it be lecturing his partner, Wesley, about the
lack of work ethic in the country, or musing about Betty and wondering
what kind of woman she really is. This is another possible Oscar
contender.</P>
<P> Kinnear also does sterling work as the soap opera star caught up in
Betty's fantasy. Kinnear has the difficult task of playing an actor
acting on a soap opera. And, when with Betty, he must, as George, act in
character as David. He captures the self-centeredness of the actor
perfectly.</P>
<P> Rock is all hair-trigger impatience and attitude as Wesley. He spews
some funny, biting lines, yet despite his overall violent nature, he is
a rather impulsive, but likable character.</P>
<P> "Nurse Betty's" script, with a screenplay by John C. Richards and James
Flamberg, based on a story by Richards, is delicious with its double
meanings and cultural insights.</P>
<P> "Nurse Betty" is like an oasis in a cinematic desert. Finally, finally,
a movie that I can recommend without hesitation has reached the
theaters. "Nurse Betty" is a must-see experience, a winning trifecta of
acting, writing and directing.</P>
