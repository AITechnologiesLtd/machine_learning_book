<P>I'm not sure how I feel about GIRL 6. I mean, if it had been done by anyone
else I would probably have thought more of it. But, because it is a Spike
Lee joint, well, I just expected more. The film explores an up and coming
actress' brief experience as a phone sex operator. It's something she twice
refers to as, "just a job," but it quickly becomes obvious that
she is addicted to the new found power she holds over her callers.</P>
<P>As with many films, the weakness lies in its foundation--the screenplay.
Here the problems arise not with dialogue, but with the depths the writer
was willing to go. I didn't feel we were given many chances to really understand
the motivations of Theresa Randle's character. That was a major flaw in
my opinion. The screenplay could be described as an exercise in symbolism.
With this I mean, "the little girl who fell down the elevator shaft"
sequences she watches on the news. Also, the caller, Bob Regular, who promises
to meet her at Coney Island but ultimately stands her up. From this scene
I take it that she is looking for what she needs where she won't find it.
These are the aspects of GIRL 6 that worked very well for me, but that's
only half a screenplay. I just felt that those aspects were grounded in
a lazy script.</P>
<P>Spike Lee continues to change and explore new filmmaking techniques. In
CROOKLYN, he shot a sequence, with an anamorphic lens, during which Troy,
the little girl, is out of her normal environment. The film was primarily
shot flat, so the anamorphic scenes looked squeezed or skinny. This effect
lasted until the little girl returned home. In GIRL 6, Spike uses that same
technique to instill an awkward and unsettling feeling toward the subject
whenever he feels necessary. He also shot all of the callers in HDTV--which
compared to film has less resolution. Spike has said that he did this to
example by visual means their lack of power. Theresa Randle was shot on
film, her image was stronger, she was in control. This technique was also
applied to the two videotaped auditions that she has. She is asked, by Quentin
Tarantino, to show her breasts. After some fussing, she concedes. At that
moment, Spike cuts to the video image of her being taped as she removes
her top. The moment is effective.</P>
<P>The film's cast is great, although no one is given much time to developed
other than Theresa Randle, but then, she's the important one. Spike Lee's
role as Jimmy is one of his better cameos--very funny. The other phone sex
operators fill their characters well. I especially got a kick out of seeing
Naomi Campbell in a shirt that read, "Models Suck."</P>
<P>Like I said earlier, if the film had been done by someone without a track
record as good as Spike Lee's, I'm sure I'd be recommending that you see
this film. With that in mind, if you approach this film as an exercise in
film technique or if you're just a fan of Spike Lee (as I am), you will
appreciate it more than the average moviegoer. There's really not much depth
to this story. I liken this situation to when Martin Scorsese does projects
like AFTER HOURS or CAPE FEAR. The film is good. The film-maker is capable
of much more. </P>

<P>P.S. The title of this review is in reference to the film's self-indulgent
use of technique to express something (a story) that is devoid of any real
substance.</P>
<P>Ratings are based on the four-star system.</P>
