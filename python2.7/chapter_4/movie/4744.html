<PRE>                           A PASSAGE TO INDIA
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>     E.M.Forster's A PASAGE TO INDIA attempts to deal with the
ignominious behavior of the English towards their Indian captives by
using a relationship between a sexually repressed Englishwoman -- the
spoiled, unattractive Adela Quested -- and an exceedingly felicitous
Indian doctor named Aziz. On her first trip to India, Quested is eager
to "know" the Indians, whom the English have notoriously, cruelly
snubbed, and quickly befriends Aziz who, in return, extends manners and
amicability by offering to take her sight-seeing, particularly to the
cryptic Marabar Caves. Aziz, however, is not at all aware of Quested's
festering and fateful obsession with sex -- he's oblivious to her
attraction to his tanned, rich-looking skin, his glistening eyes, teeth
and hair (attractions Forster himself had to Indians) -- so when
Quested, alone in the caves, loses control of her heated flashes,
precipitated by the thrusting echoes of his voice, he has no idea of
her fit of hysteria and is rightly perplexed when he's arrested for
rape. The immoral pointer is that the smug English immediately become
satisfied with Aziz's guilt and expected conviction during the trial.
The presumption of transgression -- out of historical prejudice,
superiority and unflagging insensitivity -- is so die-hardly cast that
the uncertainty of the alleged crime is not thought to matter. To make
more contrived what is essentially a simple story, Forster, a highly
regarded travel writer (his THE HILL OF DEVI is considered by some the
basis for INDIA), lays on some touristy Indian mysticism and attempts
to link it to what he regards is a possibly better morality, a fairer
jurisprudence. While it's a subjective read, and told in a genteel
reproving manner (Forster was once a don) to shame the Rajperialists,
it also fails to make connections, not unlike the way the more elevated
D.H. Lawrence novel THE PLUMED SERPENT, which starts out as an
indictment of a Celtic woman's initial prejudicial views of Mexican
culture, gets bogged down and is unable to bond themes.</P>
<P>     D.H. Lawrence once wrote, "A man of strong soul has too much
honour for the other body -- man or woman -- to use it as a means of
masturbation. So he remains neutral, inactive. That is Forster."
Because we now know more about Forster than Lawrence might have, this
description is not altogether true, but it's an apt one for Forster the
writer -- and David Lean as director. On hearing that the rights to A
PASSAGE TO INDIA were finally being offer by holder King's College (in
Cambridge), Lean reported that the first thing he said to the
purchaser, producer John Brabourne (of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS)
was, "What did happen in the caves?" Lean is suggesting that the
incident in the caves is unsolved mystery, and it is if you're willing
to believe that Forster was a mannered, prim asexualist who wouldn't
consider self-manipulation. The key to the sequence is Quested's
measured contriteness afterwards, and since we know Aziz didn't
physically violate her, she either got spooked by something in the
caves or masturbated. She may even have had a spontaneous orgasm -- but
would Forster have known about such things? (And had he, wouldn't that
have made him and not Lawrence the first priest of sex?) If Quested had
been terrified by anything other than her own wet panties, would she
have acquiesced to the imperialism? A viewer might ask: Didn't she
really want Aziz? A closet homosexual (who once had W.H. Auden as a
lover) Forster couldn't overtly tackle the agony of hiding the rush and
liberation of sex -- which is why he waited until after his death to
allow publication of MAURICE, about his own first gay loves. He binds
Quested in much the same way: she doesn't know how to respond to what
her own society has told her is forbidden -- her own sexual feelings,
especially any with racial overtones; instead, she allows society to
reflexively respond for her. (This may be the unheralded moral of the
novel -- that silence is as much of a breaker of the 9th Commandment as
overt false trespass.) In Lean's wringy hands, though, the guessing
game continues. He's handled the murkiness in the caves with such god
damn good taste that we don't have any idea what happened; even when
Quested is on the stand testifying, the flashbacks are all repeats --
of insignificance.</P>
<P>     We can not be surprised: Lean de-sexes sexual moments. The bits of
fiery hunger between Rod Steiger and Julie Christie in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO
were not guided by Lean but by Steiger, who, somewhat in the
Stanislavsky mode, instigated real friction between himself and
Christie in order to put an animalism into their scenes. Are we to
believe Peter O'Toole's T.E.  in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA went ravenously
blood hungry after sadist Jose Ferrer violated his privates? (The
incident, written as almost exquisite homoeroticism in SEVEN PILLARS OF
WISDOM, may not have happened; and if it did, the hunger might indeed
have been for what he was supposedly repelled by.) While there's no
lack of comprehension in Sarah Miles' disappointment in Robert
Mitchum's stamina in RYAN'S DAUGHTER, her lust for limping Christopher
Jones got clammy and, finally, preposterous. Our suspicions of the
director's fear of sex have been confirmed on a recent A & E Biography
about Robert Mitchum, in which Miles did a funny capsulation on Lean's
cigarette-puffing discomfort. Sometimes Lean's sexual intent can get
unintentionally funny: When Rossano Brazzi and Katharine Hepburn smooch
in SUMMERTIME and we get the climaxy fireworks, did anybody in the
audience believe for a minute he could really get it up for that bag of
bones? In A PASSAGE TO INDIA, Lean had his best shot at being less than
his usual tastefully panicked self because he didn't have to worry
about censors as he did with LAWRENCE and RYAN'S DAUGHTER. He must have
been thinking quite seriously about the incident in the caves because
he was displeased with those nature provided and required that some be
dynamited. The way the movie is constructed, it appears that what
happened in the caves would become The Rape of the Seven Veils, with
Quested's eventual testimony as flashbacks unveiling each layer until,
if only for the audience, the revelation of no rape at all. But that
doesn't happen; in fact, literally, figuratively, filmicly, absolutely
nothing happens. (Had James Ivory directed, we might have gotten the
autoerotic alternative.) On second thought, Lean isn't so much a
"strong soul" but a weak one afraid of offending those who are still
afraid of masturbation. Admirers of the novel will say that Lean shows
fidelity -- because Quested in the book reveals nothing. But one of
Forster's intrigues, one of his plants, is that he allows a wife and
son to have unexpressed suspicions -- probably the same ones we have.</P>
<P>     It's no accident that Paul Scott's four novels, together known as
"The Raj Quartet," and made into a multi-part TV series under the title
of his first, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN, are reasonably similar in general
plot structure to A PASSAGE TO INDIA: Scott found Forster's novel to be
a truncated reading experience -- the cruel panoply of India under
British rule downplayed -- and he was determined to write about India
as it really was; therefore, he used his rape much more decisively, in
a more Britishly sadistic way. Scott's right because Forster got so
wrapped up in manners and his travel writing that he ends up almost
exonerating his true rapists and their indifference: few Englishmen
show regret. (In fact, the novelist dares our tolerance by suggesting
that the accuser is "brave" and showed "courage" and at one point
allows her to declare herself "honest.") And the one character in
Forster's novel who could have stopped the farce of Aziz's trial -- the
noble Mrs. Moore -- unaccountably dies without so much as one quiet
showdown with Quested, whom Mrs. Moore suspects is being pressured into
false testimony. Scott refuses to be kind: he blisters the agonistic
British mindset, its stiff self-righteousness and superciliousness.
(Having died of cancer in 1978, Scott never got the chance to see his
quadrilogy turned into one of the tube's more enthralling miniseries.
Boozy maverick Christopher Hitchens, in his PREPARED FOR THE WORST,
does him justice too.)</P>
<P>     As Quested, the Australian Judy Davis is almost a ringer for a
puffy Lee Grant, and she gives her lines a hardened edge that recalls
Glenda Jackson. Unlike Jackson's let-it-bleed toughness, which is often
convincing in a sexual, masochist context, Davis looks consciously held
back: we must take for granted that she's been fearsomely hit by a
tidal wave of carnality. One of India's major actors, Victor Banerjee
as Aziz is just too on the brink of every emotion; he seems to be
enjoying it, but do we? His eager-beaver work is meant to be as
crowd-pleasing as John Mills' idiot in RYAN'S DAUGHTER, yet there's an
anxiety that goes beyond the character: he appears over-willing to be
intimidated. Alec Guinness in bad Indian drag is Lean's idea of comic
relief, though am I the only one to detect Donald Pleasence's villainy
in the voice? As the novel's beloved Mrs. Moore, Dame Peggy Ashcroft's
seasoned grace and amenity are the movie's only warm spots, but
frankly, I think our interest in her -- at the time the movie was
released -- had much more to do with her real acting in THE JEWEL IN
THE CROWN, in which she put on quite a show as Barbie Batchelor. As
Lean directs her, she's not much more than a flighty English version of
our dearly American Martha Scott. (Ashcroft won the Oscar for INDIA,
but it's very likely the Academy members were glued to their TVs during
voting time, when JEWEL was first shown in this country.  And for those
who have seen the series, perhaps they'd agree that of all of Scott's
character summations, the most dissatisfying lack of comeuppance was
regarding Barbie's nemesis, the drunk-bitch Mildred Layton, played to
the imperious hilt by Judy Parfitt, who's a dead-ringer for Bea
Lillie.) It's James Fox as the conscience-of-England Fielding who
manages to make the most of his role. His hair bleached, arms swaying
without affectation, manner imperturbable, this Fielding grows ever
more likable and not only is he the only Englishman to do right by the
Indians, he also does right by Mrs. Moore. It is the film's only
moving, spiritual moment when Aziz, who saw in Mrs. Moore the kindest
of faces, realizes that through Fielding "she lives."</P>
<P>     You can make a successful epic out of mediocre material, but, as
Lean proved with RYAN'S DAUGHTER, you can't if the material is
minimal.  As Scott knew, and as most readers acknowledge, Forster's A
PASSAGE TO INDIA is pretty thin stuff. He wanted it to be a seriocomic
read, and he even provided a silly finale to secure his aim. This is
the kind of novel that has boulders talking to one another, and horses,
the earth, temples, birds and the sky resisting reconciliation. Of
course Forster saw India, its space, mysticism and people as
spectacular. But within the environs and attributes -- one of which was
his prophecy about India's eventual sovereignty -- his is still a very
small story full of "pathos-is-the-highest-quality-in-art" traps,
guesses and empty pauses.  And that's what's clearly wrong with the
movie: Lean is a director who "sees" big, and that's not the same as
thinking in a big, meaningful way.  Small stories, however big the
metaphors in them, get in the way of his visions; there's simply not
enough scale to impersonalize, which has become his real specialty, his
refuge. Forster once said, "Gauguin and Van Gogh were too much for me."
It's likely that he'd say of Lean's inflated nothingness, which exposes
the thinness of INDIA as novel, "There's not enough for me."</P>
