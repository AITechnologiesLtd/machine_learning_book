<P>Synopsis: Home from college, Jim (Biggs), Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Chris 
Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) rent a 
beach house for the summer. Jim gets sex lessons from Michelle (Hannigan) 
while awaiting Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); Kevin pines after ex-girlfriend 
Vicky (Tara Reid), and Finch for Stifler's Mom; and Oz is reduced to phone 
sex with Heather (Mena Suvari). Will their friendship survive the summer?</P>
<P>Review: Despite a cast of unknowns, 1999's "American Pie" was a hilarious 
hit, paving the way for many lesser imitators. And although the first 
"Pie" wasn't exactly screaming out for a sequel, its box office success 
made one virtually inevitable. The result is not as good as its precursor 
-- unsurprising, given that the sheer freshness of "American Pie" was part 
of its appeal -- but "Pie 2" is nonetheless an enjoyable romp. To a large 
extent, the best ingredients of the original "Pie" shine here as well: 
Biggs is fine as hapless Jim, Eugene Levy is terrific as his 
well-intentioned father, and Hannigan sparkles as sexually deviant flutist 
Michelle. And, once again, Nicholas and Reid are forgettable as former 
couple Kevin and Vicky, and Natasha Lyonne's Jessica is given nothing to 
do. There are a few additional missteps this time: Stifler, entertaining 
in small doses in the first film, grows wearisome in the expanded role 
he's given here. And Finch, so enjoyable last time around, is trapped in 
basically the same joke throughout "Pie 2". There is also a sketchier feel 
to the script, like a tacit admission that it has little reason to exist. 
Although a few sequences stand out -- including phone sex between Klein 
and Suvari, and hilarious lessons in sex from Hannigan -- it would not 
come as a complete disappointment if this was the final slice of pie.</P>
