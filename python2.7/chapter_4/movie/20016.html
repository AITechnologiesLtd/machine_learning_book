<P>         Although Bruce Willis has starred in some of the biggest hits
of the past 15 years, his best performances are usually found in movies
that turn out to be relatively uncommercial. In blockbusters such as
"Armageddon" or "Die Hard With a Vengeance," Willis seems to be going
through his paces with a minimum of enthusiasm, but he was unforgettably
creepy in director Alan Rudolph's "Mortal Thoughts" and did a superb job
playing a shattered Vietnam vet in "In Country," both of which are
currently languishing on a dusty shelf at a video store near you.</P>
<P> The fact that Willis is exceptionally good in "The Sixth Sense"
cannot bode well for the film's prospects at the box office. Neither
does the picture's deceptive ad campaign, which seems to promise a
gruesome thriller. Instead, "Sense" is a slow-building drama with some
sharp acting, a few shocks and a devilishly clever final twist.</P>
<P> In "Sense," Willis is cast as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a
Philadelphia-based child psychiatrist with "a gift for teaching children
how to be strong," according to his wife Anna (Olivia Williams of
"Rushmore"). His skills are put to the test when he takes on the case of
Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a 9-year-old social outcast suffering
from acute anxiety and symptoms of schizophrenia.</P>
<P> After some gentle prodding from Crowe, Cole finally reveals the
reasons behind his bizarre behavior: He's an unwilling medium who can
see and hear troubled spirits. The apartment Cole shares with his slowly
unravelling mom Lynn (Toni Collette) is frequently visited by the
spectres of people whose lives ended tragically, such as a little girl
who was poisoned by her mom and an abused wife whose husband drove her
to suicide.</P>
<P> Unlike the psychic hero of "The Shining" however, Cole is not
being threatened by these visions. In fact, one of the flaws of
writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's screenplay is its inability to
decide exactly what Cole's ethereal friends want or why they've come to
him. Even the author doesn't seem to have an answer.</P>
<P> What Shyamalan can offer instead is a quietly unsettling
atmosphere, which sets "Sense" apart from most contemporary suspense
films. That the movie works as well as it does is due primarily to
Willis and Osment, an exceptionally expressive young actor who never
resorts to cuteness. Willis effectively underplays Crowe's trepidations
and dwindling self-confidence while Collette, the heroine of "Muriel's
Wedding," is convincingly distraught in what turns out to be a rather
underwritten role.</P>
<P> "Sense" is also extremely well-produced, using its City of
Brotherly Love setting, an elegiac score by James Newton Howard and
excellent editing to enhance its somber mood. Shyamalan's film proves
sometimes silence can create a much more powerful impact than a steady
bombardment of crashes and booms. James Sanford</P>
