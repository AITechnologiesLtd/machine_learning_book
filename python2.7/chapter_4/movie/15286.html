<PRE>`I Still Know' and I Still Don't Care
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>It's now the anniversary of the slayings of Julie James' (Jennifer
Love Hewitt) best friends.  Still besieged by nightmarish memories of
the man responsible for it all, she seems to be on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.  She can't concentrate on her schoolwork, can't get a good
night's sleep, and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking
strobe lights at a local dance club.  Everywhere she looks, she sees
visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand.</P>
<P>In the first movie, `I Know What You Did Last Summer', Julie and three
of her friends accidentally kill a man, running him down while driving
down a dark mountain highway.  To cover their misdeed, they dump the
body into the ocean.  However, he never quite died and returned to
hunt down Julie and her friends.  Julie and one other, Ray (Freddie
Prinze Jr.), survived only to make this dismal sequal.  Needing some
desparate rest and relaxation, she is elated to learn that her college
roommate, Karla (Brandy), has won a trip for four to a secluded
tropical island.  Accompanying these two girls are Karla's overbearing
boyfriend, Tyrell (Mehki Phifer) and a potential beau for Julie.   </P>
<P>But was this contest too good to be true?  The resort is filled with a
skeleton staff that seemed like Love Boat rejects.  Meanwhile, the
hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin. 
This presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will
have no possible means off the island.  Eventually, they will be
hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense
lightning storms.  As you might have guessed, somewhere in the shadows
lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker
and wielding a hook.   Julie tries to convince her friends that the
killer is on the island (an eerie touch is when she is singing "I Will
Survive" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll "I Still Know..."),
but her friends chalk it up to paranoia.  But the body count soon
starts to rise, and for Julie, it's going to be the worst vacation of
her life.</P>
<P>The funny (yes, I used the word 'funny') thing about this movie is
that I heard more chortling and giggling (maybe it was MY giggling)
than I heard screaming.  This movie boils down to a mindless slashfest
that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky
campiness.  There isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths.
 Here's an appropriate example.  Knock-Knock.  "Housekeeping", says
the diminuitive cleaning lady.  The door suddenly opens up.  SLASH. 
Next victim!  </P>
<P>Is there any reason to go and see this movie?  Not unless you want to
see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90
minutes.  But I do want to say one thing about this movie that
satisfied me.  I was thoroughly irritated with Tyrell, who incessantly
ranted and raved about his sexual libido.  I secretly  wished for him
to get filleted.  Did he get 'hooked'?  Well, let's just say that if
he didn't, I would give this film a grade of "D".  </P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
