<P>     Director Mike Leigh's "Career Girls," the follow-up to his
American breakthrough "Secrets & Lies," is a perfect example of his
improvisational style. His method of filmmaking is to give his actors
an idea for a scene --- a starting point --- and to let them run with
it. As a result, Leigh's movies tend to be full of spontaneity and
color and low on narrative drive.</P>
<P>In "Career Girls," you'd be hard-pressed to find a traditional
plot. It's an aimless but amiable little portrait of two Englishwomen
who lived together for four years during the Eighties and are reunited
for a weekend ten years after their split-up. Back in University days,
Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge) and Annie (Lynda Steadman) had little in
common, aside from a shared love for the music of The Cure and a
fondness for using a copy of Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights" as a
sort of oracle for fortelling their futures. The rundown little flat
they shared overtop a Chinese takeaway is far removed from the upscale
condos and luxury apartments Hannah is now shopping for.</P>
<P>In the initial flashbacks to the women's younger days, it looks
as if Leigh may have let Steadman and Cartlidge run a bit too
wild. Plagued by a serious case of facial determititus, Annie is a
twitching bundle of loose nerves, while Hannah (she insists that it be
pronounced "Hah-NAH" initially) is strident and
self-dramatizing. Neither seems like a real person so much as an
actor's exaggerated concept of a character type, and these early
scenes play like sketches lifted from "The Tracey Ullman Show."</P>
<P>But as Cartlidge and Steadman find the right levels, "Career
Girls" develops into an insightful meditation on the nature of
friendship, as well as a peek into the psyches of two people who think
they've dealt with the past but have actually only pushed it
aside. Both women have plenty of unresolved issues that seem to keep
getting in the way of their finding true happiness and peace of mind,
and each is a bit envious of the other. The bird-voiced and retiring
Annie admires Hannah's forthrightness and drive; Hannah, who's almost
always hiding behind some sort of a front, confesses, "I'm not strong
enough to be as vulnerable as you."</P>
<P>The poignancy of moments like that offset the occasional
contrivances that develop late in the film: There are at least two too
many run-ins with faces from the past, and an encounter with a former
flatmate who's now a jabbering derelict goes on long after it makes
its point. Leigh is most successful when he simply let Steadman and
Cartlidge work their quiet magic together, without distractions.
