<PRE>Bird (1988)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 84</PRE>
<P>"Bird" is director Clint Eastwood's tribute to bebop jazz
saxophonist Charlie Parker (Forest Whitaker).  Although
lengthy, and often dwelling on the more lurid aspects
of Parker's life, it is an excellent film.  Parker comes
alive, as an artist and a person, whose talents and
torments are depicted as inseperable.</P>
<P>"Bird" zigzags backwards and forwards through Charlie Parker's
adult life.  His relationship with his wife Chan (Diane Venora)
is fully explored.  We also hear a great deal of Parker's
sax playing.  Parker's mentors are mocking, unimaginative
Buster Franklin (Keith David) and respectful but disapproving
jazz visionary Dizzy Gillespie (Samuel E. Wright).
Parker becomes a mentor himself, to white Jewish trumpeter
Red Rodney (Michael Zelniker), who decides to imitate Parker
with his addictions as well.  Perhaps over-explored is Parker's
alcoholism and drug-abuse, and coupled with ulcers and
suicide attempts, even the most naive viewer expects an
early death.</P>
<P>Eastwood played a jazz DJ in 'Play Misty For Me', an
early directorial effort.  He would later be associated
with country music in a series of films from
"Every Which Way but Loose" to "Honkytonk Man".  But
Jazz must be his first love, and that comes through in
the effort put into "Bird".  Unreleased Parker performances
were merged with backing by contemporary musicians, with
the editing undistinguishable.  Attempts are made to
explain the significance of his style, and to convey
the wide-ranging reactions to Parker's music, both from
fans and from fellow musicians.</P>
<P>Whitaker gives a warm and winning performance.
Smiling but sad-eyed, well-intentioned but unreliable,
drug addicted but condemning drug abuse, his Parker
is a swirl of contradictions.  His wife Chan, like
his various girlfriends, are white jazz fans from
assumedly wealthy families.  Chan is intelligent and
sometimes frustrated, but she is always loyal to
her husband despite all of his troubles.</P>
<P>My favorite scene in the film has Parker and his
band playing at a Jewish wedding, a gig arranged by Rodney.
The warmth bridging the immense cultural gaps was
great to see.</P>
<P>While "Bird" only received an Academy Award for Best Sound,
Whitaker won Best Actor at the Cannes festival,
while Eastwood, Whitaker and Venora received Golden Globe
nominations.</P>
