<P>     TWO DEATHS, Nicolas Roeg's latest film, is positive proof, if any 
is needed, that a solid cast and fascinating conversations about 
provocative subjects aren't enough to guarantee a successful motion 
picture.  TWO DEATHS ventures into the mine field of sexual obsession, 
humiliation, and degradation, and doesn't emerge unscathed.  There can 
be merit in making a film about these subjects (see Peter Greenaway's 
THE COOK, THE THIEF, THE WIFE & HER LOVER), but when the storyline 
becomes as painfully contrived as this one, much value is lost.</P>
<P>     The backdrop for this overplotted story is Bucharest in 1989, when 
the reign of Socialist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu came to a violent end.  
Pitched battles are being fought in the streets, with soldiers battling 
revolutionary students and each other.  A city-wide curfew has been 
declared, and those who venture outside risk their lives  For much of 
TWO DEATHS, this revolution adds color to the main story, which takes 
place entirely within a Bucharest mansion.  Eventually, unfortunately, 
the outside violence spills into the house, resulting in several hard-
to-swallow plot twists and an ending that is laughably over-the-top.</P>
<P>     TWO DEATHS opens with Dr. Daniel Pavenic (Michael Gambon, who 
played an equally depraved role in THE COOK) hosting an annual reunion 
dinner party for old school chums.  Although a dozen are invited, only 
three make it.  Because of the violence outside, Pavenic's medical 
services are in demand, so he's late.  While waiting for him, the others 
speculate about the identity of a woman in one of Pavenic's photographs 
-- is she his daughter, someone he killed on the operating table, or 
something else?  The doctor arrives and dispels the mystery:  she's Ana 
(Sonia Braga), his housekeeper and sexual slave.  Also, in his own 
words, she's the woman he "chose to destroy."</P>
<P>     This establishes TWO DEATHS' central mystery, and, while it's an 
intriguing one, the payoff is unsatisfactory.  Not only does it seem to 
take forever for the full truth to be uncovered (there are numerous 
annoying interruptions in Pavenic's narrative as wounded requiring his 
attention arrive at the front door), but Ana's tale lacks the tragic 
depth we are led to expect.  As TWO DEATHS evolves, we're afforded 
glimpses into the lives of Pavenic's guests, all of whom despise their 
host.  Unfortunately, none of these people captures even a scintilla of 
our sympathy.  In fact, there's no one who evokes a moment's compassion</P>
<P>     The fascinating parts of TWO DEATHS are the discussions about love, 
obsession, lust, degradation, and perversity.  What differentiates one 
from the other?  How unusual is sexual obsession, and how does one exist 
when trapped by it?  Is Pavenic evil or merely the helpless prisoner of 
his own towering desire?  TWO DEATHS explores some compelling issues, 
although it rarely offers any new or groundbreaking viewpoints.  </P>
<P>     Gambon gives a persuasive and chilling interpretation of Pavenic:  
dry, world-weary, and self-deprecating.  The offhand manner in which he 
describes his past actions would be horrifying if we cared anything 
about the participants.  A performance like this deserves better 
material.  Sonia Braga's Ana is completely indecipherable, which, I 
assume, is the intention.  The supporting performers, including Patrick 
Malahide as an effete reporter whose marriage was ruined by Pavenic, are 
adequate, although not spectacular.</P>
<P>     It's clear from the beginning that TWO DEATHS is based on a play -- 
confined in Pavenic's house, it's hopelessly stagebound, and the 
bizarre, jumpy structure (constantly interrupting the doctor's 
narrative) dispels the sense of claustrophobia that might have added 
some dark power to the contrived story.  The shots of bloodshed in the 
streets are grimly effective, but these are always brief and often used 
merely as transition shots for the action within the doctor's domain.  
There are many possible interpretations for the title, but, in the end, 
the number of deaths is irrelevant considering that none of these 
characters ever seems really alive.</P>
