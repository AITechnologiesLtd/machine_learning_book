<P>There's a scene, late in Amistad, where lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew
McConaughey) is trying to explain the American legal system to his West
African client, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou).  Cinque, having never heard of
the appeals process, is enraged when Baldwin tries to explain that the
Supreme Court will now have to decide whether Cinque and his fellow
African refugees will go free or be executed for revolting against their
captors.  Baldwin explains that Cinque is "almost" free, which prompts
Cinque to scream, "Almost!" again and again in rage and frustration.
(At least that's what I think he's saying, as almost all of Cinque's
lines are in the Mende dialect.)</P>
<P>Amistad is a well-made, exceptionally well-acted, and skillfully
directed film about a great historical story, but it's a victim of its
own quality.  Amistad is a good movie, an Oscar contender, even, but
with its pedigree, with its starpower, with the resonance of its story,
you would expect this to be a great movie.  And it's almost a great
movie.  While that word -- almost -- is not as frustrating for you and
me at the movies as it is for Cinque and his pirate crew, it's
frustrating enough.</P>
<P>Amistad is at its most powerful in depicting the voyage of Cinque to
America.  After a brutal kidnapping from his village, and harrowing and
murderous journey  from West Africa on the a Portuguese slaver, Cinque
manages to break free of his chains on the slave deck of the Spanish
ship La Amistad, kill his oppressors, and attempt to steer the ship back
to Africa.  The action sequences are powerful and deeply disturbing,
evoking all the horror and pity of slavery.  Unforunately, the real meat
of the movie takes place ashore, in a series of courtrooms and legal
manuevers.  It's sort of like Perry Mason meets Roots.</P>
<P>Now, don't get me wrong, here.  I'm a lawyer.  I love this kind of
stuff.  And for me, anyway, it's a bonus to see Matthew McConaughey in
the courtroom again after his performace as Jake Brigance in A Time to
Kill.  But there is just so much courtroom wrangling and arguing and
cross-examination that it detracts from what the movie is really about.
Even the resolute Cinque, who disrupts one trial by shouting, "Give us
free!", over and over again, is reduced by the end of the movie to
quizzing lawyers Baldwin and former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony
Hopkins) about jurisdictional questions.  And by the climax of the
movie, a quirky, overlong speech by Adams, we're all as tired of the
legal process as Cinque is.  (It's a measure of the screenplay's
awareness of the legal process that former Justice Harry Blackmun was
tapped to play the part of the Chief Justice.)</P>
<P>The problem with Amistad is that it tries to do too much and leaves too
much left undone.   Amistad spends, for example, a lot of time on
historical political intrigue.  While pertinent to the legal
back-and-forth, it isn't very interesting, and wastes the talents of
fine actors David Paymer, Anna Paquin, and Nigel Hawthorne -- not to
mention that America's Finest Actor, Morgan Freeman, is given a
suprisingly slim role as a Boston abolitionist working towards Cinque's
freedom.  There's also a surprising amount of time spent on John Quincy
Adams and his supposed struggle with the memory of his father, President
John Adams -- which doesn't quite ring true.  (John Quincy Adams, while
a mediocre President, was one of America's most accomplished diplomats,
possibly America's greatest Secretary of State, and served ably in the
House of Representatives after his term in the White House.)</P>
<P>Amistad is at its best when Djimon Hounsou is on screen. McConaughey's
character calls Cinque "the greatest man living in chains", and
Hounsou's indominitable Cinque exudes greatness and dignity, even in
chains.  In a world all too quick to write him off as a savage, Cinque
gives us an example of courage, humility, strength, and resolve.
Hounsou plays his role brilliantly, especially considering that we don't
know what the heck he's saying most of the time.  (Amistad is stingy
with subtitles for some reason.)  But we always know what Cinque is
feeling and thinking, thanks to Hounsou's expressive performance.
Amistad's chief failure is that it takes the focus of the movie off of
Cinque and on the legal and political issues.</P>
<P>Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in relating the story of his arrest in The Gulag
Archipelago, asked why, exactly, the Russian people never rose up and
fought the KGB agents that came to arrest them in the middle of the
night.  He sadly concluded that "we didn't love freedom enough."
Amistad, by telling the story of one man's fight against slavery,
reminds all of us that freedom is precious, worth fighting for, worth
dying for.  It is a noble effort by a great director to deliver a
powerful message.  However, just as Cinque's efforts at freedom were
hampered and delayed by legal and political manueverings, Amistad is
hampered in telling its tale by the memory of those same maneuvers.  A
good movie, yes, and almost a great movie.</P>
