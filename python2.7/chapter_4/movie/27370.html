Traffic</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>What a script! Sincere, detailed, gritty dialogue runs its street-real 
mouth all over this richly woven story. </P>
<P>"Traffic" attacks the "The War Against Drugs" from multiple angles: The 
Mexican beat cop, the S. Californian detective, the higher level Mexican 
drug lord, the American drug lord's wife, the newly appointed 
commissioner on drug control in the States and his coke-snorting 
daughter. </P>
<PRE>All perform marvelously. </PRE>
<P>Filmed in an "off the tripod" documentary style, the look and feel of 
the film reminds me of "Three Kings." A burnt-out orange filter is used 
during the many south of the border sequences. It's an effective tool to 
"heat up" the tension of these scenes as well as assist the viewer to 
distinguish locales. Though tension building, the shakey camera bit 
grows a tad tiresome. </P>
<P>I particularly enjoyed the intelligent, even classy, snitch; the 
repartee between US Detectives; the sweet ending shot; the Mexican cop - 
sort of a cross between a Latin Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe; and of 
course the masterful interweaving of many tasty subplots. </P>
<P>Unfortunately one flaw, which in another film might be glossed over, in 
this otherwise intelligent production stands out like a footprint in a 
perfectly spread concrete patio. Sadly, that one breakfast scene spoiled 
my appetite for this meticulously prepared meal. </P>
