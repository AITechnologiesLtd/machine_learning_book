<P> CORKY ROMANO (2001). 1/4 star out of 4. Starring Chris Kattan, Vinessa Shaw,
Peter Falk, Peter Berg, Chris Penn, Fred Ward, Richard Roundtree, Matthrew
Glave, Roger Fan and David Sheridan. Written by David Garrett & Jason Ward.
Directed by Rob Pritts. Rated PG-13. Approx. 88 minutes. </P>
<P> It's too bad. I was all set to blame Lorne Michaels for another comedic
disaster starring a Saturday Night Live cast member when I noticed Michaels name
does not appear anywhere in the credits. </P>
<P> OK, Lorne, you're off the hook for this one. </P>
<P> But someone needs to take the blame for foisting Corky Romano on an
unsuspecting public. </P>
<P> Corky Romano stars Chris Kattan, one of the less-than-funny SNL cast members,
in a movie that hardly qualifies as a comedy. Heck, it hardly qualifies as a
motion picture. </P>
<P> Corky Romano is an embarrassment, a sloppy, sophomoric feature. </P>
<P> Kattan plays Corky as a combination Jerry Lewis-Jim Carrey kind of manchild; a
naive innocent, kind of spastic, an uncoordinated idiot. He is an assistant
veterinarian as well as the outcast, youngest son of a reputed crime lord,
"Pops" Romano (Peter Falk). </P>
<P> Corky is drafted by the family to infiltrate the FBI and retrieve whatever
evidence the bureau has on his dad. </P>
<P> Of course it is all implausible nonsense, made moreso by the incompetence of
Kattan's Corky, who acts as if he can't even tie his shoelaces. </P>
<P> But, only in the movies, through a crooked computer hacker Corky is renamed
Corky Pissant and is a full-fledged FBI operative, skilled in five languages, an
Olympic marksman and just a superman among crimefighters. </P>
<P> It numbs the mind to think that screenwriters David Garrett and Jason Ward have
such contempt for their audience that they believe any intelligent FBI official
would believe a klutzy, nerd such as Corky is a special agent. It's insulting
and contemptible. </P>
<P> The screenwriters' plot is predictable; everything can be foretold a reel or
three before it happens. They don't create any characters, just throw us
familiar types. Illogical and implausible situations abound throughout. </P>
<P> Corky Romano is not funny and lacks any comedic pacing. </P>
<P> Plus Kattan can't carry the movie. He is funny in small spurts, but he does not
have the presence or weight to bolster a feature-length venture. </P>
<P> It is sad to see a great actor such as Falk reduced to playing such a
stereotypical character, nor is there anything funny about illiteracy nor
homosexuality, two areas the writers unsuccessfully try to mine for humor, but
come up with only pyrite. </P>
<P> The only good that may come from this entire folly is to give Lorne Michaels
second thoughts about mounting any features based on some of Kattan's SNL
characters. </P>
<P> Corky Romano is for the dogs, it stinks. It's about as funny as road kill. So,
I'd advise you to swerve around it. </P>
