<PRE>          WELCOME BACK MR. MCDONALD (Japan with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Very funny TV-like situation comedy of people trying to
put on a live radio play and having to change the plot many times mid-
broadcast.  The territory it covers is very, very much like the
American cable TV show "Remember WENN."  Somehow the plot seems a
little thin for a feature film, but still a lot of fun.  Rating: 6 (0
to 10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Written and directed by Koki Mitani.
   - Staff of radio station is putting on an amateur play that won a
     contest.  Turns out that this was really the only entrant in the
     contest.
   - The play is not screened by all parties involved and the initial
     changes are to correct the redundancy of "lift up."  A prima donna
     actor insists on a name change.  This is the first spark of a
     firestorm of plot changes.
   - Story within story gets more and more contrived and absurd.
   - Story could have been done on American Movie Channel's "Remember
     WENN."  In fact something very similar probably was done.
   - Some of the contrivances of getting around restrictions on the
     script are fairly humorous.
   - Fairly believable set of script changes.  Director said that all
     had happened at one time or another to him when working at a
     station.  A good reason why radio drama is taped.</P>
