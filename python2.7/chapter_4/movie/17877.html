<P>DIVORCING JACK (M).  
(NewVision)
Director: David Caffrey
Stars: David Thewlis, Rachel Griffiths, Robert Lindsay, Richard Gant, 
Laine Megaw, Laura Fraser, Alan McKee, Jason Isaacs
Running time: 106 minutes.</P>
<P>This violent, zany and blackly comic thriller, adapted from
Colin Bateman's widely acclaimed novel, is set against the background
of contemporary Northern Ireland, besieged by chaos, violence and
unrest.  However, Divorcing Jack is closer in spirit to the brilliant
The Crying Game rather than the dry political polemics of Jim Sheridan
(In The Name Of The Father, etc).  The clever title doesn't really
tell audiences what to expect from this film, which deftly plays
around with the conventions of several genres.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1999, which assures us that, at least for
the moment, the events are fictitious.  Ireland is approaching an
election, and the front running candidate for the post of prime
Minister is Michael Brinn (Robert Lindsay), a suave, charismatic Tony
Blair-like politician running on a peace platform.  Enter Dan Starkey
(David Thewlis, from Mike Leigh's Naked, etc), a cynical,
wise-cracking, hard drinking, womanising newspaper columnist.  On the
way to a party one night Dan befriends pretty young art student
Margaret (Laura Fraser).  His wife Patricia (Laine Megaw) throws him
out of the house, and Dan temporarily moves into Margaret's loft
apartment.</P>
<P>The domestic comedy of the film's first half hour hardly
prepares the audience for the unexpected twists that the plot
unexpectedly takes.  One night Dan arrives at the apartment, only to
find Margaret brutally murdered.  Suddenly, Dan finds himself on the
run, wanted for murder and other unspecified crimes.  He is hunted by
the authorities and gun toting hitmen from both sides of the political
spectrum.  It seems that Dan has inadvertently come into possession of
some incriminating evidence that could blow the election wide open,
and set the peace process back years.  His only ally in this dangerous
world is Lee (Aussie actress Rachel Griffiths), a nurse who doubles as
a stripping nun by night.</P>
<P>First time feature director David Caffrey injects a wicked
stream of anarchic humour into the inventive and exhausting roller
coaster plot, eschewing the usual political commentary and social
criticism for bullets, bombs and car chases.  This slightly
unconventional film possesses a subversive spirit, a boisterous style
and energy to spare.  As the film rockets along, Caffrey deliberately
keeps the audience as off balance as Starkey.</P>
<P>Bateman's colourful, quirky characters are brought vividly to
life by a strong cast.  Cast largely against type, Thewlis makes the
most of his showiest role for ages as the wise cracking reluctant
hero.  His energetic performance, his abrasive humour, and droll
narration provides the film with much of its ironic tone.  When
Griffiths' character declares "I haven't had so much fun in years,"
you can almost believe she is speaking from the heart.</P>
<P>Divorcing Jack makes for a perversely entertaining film.
Although decidedly scrappy in parts, it marks a promising debut from
Caffrey, a young director who displays more energy and flair here than
a handful of other first time film makers combined.</P>
