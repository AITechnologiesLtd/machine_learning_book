<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>The western genre is one that, in retrospect, seems kind of silly. Modern
revisionism like "Unforgiven" and "Dancing With Wolves" aside, the western
in general is a rather unfortunate black-and-white look at the mid-to-late
nineteenth century, with "the Cowboys" painted as the good guys, and "the
Indians" cast as the villains. The richness of the authentic era is often
supplanted by simpleminded melodrama, a litany of archetypes in spurs and
ten-gallon hats. Which is not to say that these movies aren't necessarily
a lot of fun -- it's tough to beat something like "Stagecoach" for sheer
exhilaration -- but it's hard to dismiss the notion that part of the
reason for the decline of the western was its strict adherence to this
imaginary, often offensive version of the past.</P>
<P>It's ironic, then, that a movie like "Shanghai Noon" -- which seeks to
be both a traditional summer action picture and a pastiche of the western
-- offers a surprisingly genuine view of the Wild West. This isn't the
kind of realism offered by the aforementioned Eastwood and Costner films,
where you could almost feel the heat of the desert and the gallop of 
the horses under your feet. But "Shanghai Noon" makes some surprisingly
astute observations about the whole Cowboy-and-Indian dichotomy which
is rather unexpected in this kind of comedy.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan plays the amusingly-named Chon Wang (which by itself should
give you an idea of the kind of humor of the picture), a Chinese Imperial
Guard who is sent to Nevada to rescue Princess Pei Pei ("Ally McBeal's"
Lucy Liu). The princess has been kidnapped from the Forbidden City by the
traitorous Lo Fong (Roger Yuan) and is being held for ransom in a work
camp populated by other enslaved Chinese. Chon's job is made more
difficult when he is erroneously pegged as the sidekick of train robber
Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and then in a drunken stupor gets married to a
sly Native American woman (Brandon Merrill). Thrust into an uneasy
partnership and hunted by both Marshall Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) and
O'Bannon's old gang, Chon and Roy have to team up to travel to Carson City
and rescue Pei Pei.</P>
<P>Much of the amusement of "Shanghai Noon" arises from the nature of Chan's
character: here is a figure who seems alien to both the settlers and the
Native Americans alike. One hilarious sequence really puts it all in
perspective. Chon, having saved a Sioux child from a tribe of Crow
warriors, is invited to join their revelries one night. Chon knows very
little English and no Sioux whatsoever but tries to discuss his mission 
with the Natives all the same. Groans one Sioux, "Now he's saying it
slower. Like that'll help." </P>
<P>Similarly, there is a sequence involving the other Imperial Guards sent
to America, who have become separated from Chon Wang. Their interpreter is
murdered, but they manage to gain passage with a family of Puritans --
who figure they can't be Indians, so they must be Jews. The script, by
Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, cuts through the cultural barriers; by
showing how ridiculously people act toward Chon and the other Chinese, it
acts as a not-so-subtle reflection of the silliness underlying all those
old Western serials.</P>
<P>Indeed, "Shanghai Noon" as a whole does a very good job of finding just
the right balance between comedy, action, and social commentary. And while
none of these are done exceedingly well -- there aren't a lot of
absolutely uproarious moments, and Chan's stunts are accomplished but
rarely of the amazing variety -- they do come together in a pleasant, 
enjoyable package.</P>
<P>Owen Wilson didn't impress me much as a one-note character in "The
Haunting", but does a much better job here. It helps, no doubt, that he's
been given a pretty interesting character to work with: O'Bannon sort of
straddles the line between wearing white and black hats. He's a train
robber but he's always polite and never steals from ladies. He's torn
between rescuing Pei Pei because it's the right thing to do, and because
he might be able to steal the gold brought to America for her ransom. Even
though he's ostensibly a hero, Wilson maintains a believable roguishness
throughout the proceedings -- all given an almost surreal edge by the fact
that he's a cowboy who sounds like he should be surfing the waves off
Waikiki.</P>
<P>Chan does his usual capable job, although he plays the buffoon a little
too much early on, making his character's later competence seem 
incongruous. Liu makes the most of a small role, playing a princess who
possesses both strength and grace. Somewhat less successful is Merrill as
Chon's Native bride: although she handles the mostly silent part well, the
character itself forms the basis of the movie's most unsuccessful subplot. 
Obviously intended to be a parody of the many inadvertent, neglected and
often ill-fated Native brides in westerns (see "The Searchers", for
example), Merrill's character is used as a deus ex machina a few times too
many, and is an uncomfortable insertion into the story. Nowhere is this
more apparent than at the end of the film: the character's final fate is
contrived and almost nonsensical, as if Millar and Gough had no idea what
else to do with her.</P>
<P>Despite its unconventional marriage of martial arts and cowboy antics,
"Shanghai Noon" is not a movie that will reinvent the western genre. But
that's not what it sets out to do: it's basically an excuse for Jackie
Chan to do what he does best in a new environment, and get in a few digs
at popular cinema along the way. The combination might be unorthodox,
the material somewhat uneven, but somehow, it works pretty well.</P>
