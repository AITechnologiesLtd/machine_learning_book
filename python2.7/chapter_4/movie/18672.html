<P>   Coming-of-age movies in America of late lean toward the
grotesque and cynical.   Alexander Payne's "Election," for
example, has no role models you'd want to emulate,
centering on a young woman whose driving ambition serves
as pretext to gain affection--which she never does win. 
Horror stories like "Scream" and its sequel are tongue-in-
cheek, good for laughs, but have no confidence in audience
sentimentality.  The Europeans treat the genre no differently. 
Agnieszka Holland's "Europa Europa," a dazzler when
introduced in 1991, portrays a German-Jewish teen who must
conceal his identity only to find himself drafted into Hitler's
army.</P>
<P>   Things weren't always this way.  For all his melancholy,
Eugene O'Neill turned out a resplendent comedy about the
kind of childhood he wished he had.  His "Ah! Wilderness!",
which hit the stage right in the middle of the Great
Depression, portrays a 17-year-old boy who passes from
adolescence to manhood during a two-day crisis when his girl
friend's folks break off his relationship with their daughter,
leading Richard into a hilarious night of drinking with a tart in
a local bar.</P>
<P>   Perhaps "My Life So Far," based on the autobiography of
renowned British TV producer Sir Denis Forman, will break
the current mold.  With childhood portrayed so frequently as
a time of sturm und drang, how refreshing to watch a movie
which avoids treacle while simultaneously portraying a kid
whose family life is deliriously happy!  At the center of the
tale--which is engagingly told and photographed handsomely
amid the wonderful greenery of the Scottish countryside--is
the adorable, outgoing Fraser (Robert Norman), whose
emotional health remains firm despite the idiosyncrasies he
observes daily around him.  </P>
<P>   Fraser has been born into a wealthy family living on a lush
estate owned by the aging Gamma (Rosemary Harris).  The
manor has a full staff of enthusiastic maids, a veritable
menagerie of dogs ranging from a wee West Highland White
to an enormous Scottish Deerhound, and best of all is
headed by daddy Edward (Colin Firth) whose inventions are
themselves like the punch lines of shaggy dog stories. 
Married to the relatively colorless Moira (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio), Edward springs to amorous life when his
millionaire brother Morris (Malcolm McDowell) introduces the
family to his new, 24-year-old French fiance, Heloise (Irene
Jacob).  If young Fraser Pettigrew displays innocence of the
birds and bees, puzzling in his home library over mythological
accounts of lesbians, prostitutes and orgies, he is about to
lose his naivete under the influence of this pert, perky, cellist-
-with whom the entire manor seems to have fallen in love.</P>
<P>   Filmed on location in lovely Argyll, Scotland, "My Life So
Far" may not portray the sort of opulent backdrop that
constituted the environment of most movie viewers , but
anyone with a modicum of sensibility will be caught up in this
appealing kid's experiences with the adult world, seen
through his perceptive vision and intelligent mind.  Though
his father has has his flaws, albeit the sort of blemishes that
any red-blooded Scot might be expected to possess, his is
the sort of dad we all wish we'd had.  He takes the boy
fishing, introduces him to an adventurous pilot known as the
emperor of the sky, imbues him with lectures about moral
fiber ("Beethoven is God talking in his sleep; jazz is the
devil"), never punishes the lad, and seems never to have
need to do so.  All in the movie audience whose creative side
dominates their brains (presumably the kind for whom movies
should appeal the most) will cheer Edward's inventive genius,
however impractical, as he invests his time and wealth into
the development of a plant herb as a cure for disease while
his more pragmatic brother, Morris, belittles the man's
quixoticism.  </P>
<P>  Director Hugh Hudson devotes considerable time to close-
ups of this wonderful man's expressions, each of which tells a
story about his feelings at the time, particularly envy of his
boorish brother's good luck in catching the gifted Heloise.  At
once the most poignant and comical scenes are of the 10-
year-old boy's struggle to understand the passages he reads
in the books about the Greeks, with a classic episode of a
stuttering father faced with the inevitable queries about the
pleasures of the flesh.  There are wonderful episodes
displaying the close relationship that young Fraser enjoys
with the bevy of servants, including his daily ritual of pouring
tea for each of them in the kitchen.  The frighteningly
competent assortment of acting talent from the formidable
stage actress Rosemary Harris to Robert Norman in his first
professional role adds to the evocation of rural Scotland
during the last twenties and early thirties.</P>
