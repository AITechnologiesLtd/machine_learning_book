<P>Roberto Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL takes "dark comedy" to entirely new
levels. It is clearly a humorous film, making good use of Benigni's comic
talents, yet nearly half of it takes place in a Nazi concentration camp,
and it does have something very worthwhile to say about the Holocaust. At
its roots, this is a story about how someone who is leading a relatively
peaceful, ordinary life suddenly has it stripped away, and how such a
person struggles to make sense out of the unimaginable human cruelty that
he witnesses. It just so happens that this character is Guido Orefice, an
Italian Jewish waiter who seems like he must have once been a circus clown
and is frankly a little nuts.</P>
<P>For the first hour, we are introduced to Guido and his life in 1939
Italy--after Mussolini's takeover, but before the worst days of World War
II and the Holocaust--as he meets and falls in love with Dora (Nicoletta
Braschi), a grade school teacher. Guido is able to live a happy life for
the most part. So far, his freedom has not been curtailed very strictly. He
can't quite consider himself equal to the non-Semitic Italian citizens, but
it's mostly limited to passing insults and subtle forms of discrimination.
Benigni is a talented actor, and he succeeds at getting us to like Guido
and his friends through his various bizarre stunts and comic routines,
while at the same time showing the audience the creeping inhuman racism
that is becoming more and more a part of everyday life in Italy. Then we
jump forward to 1944. He and Dora are married, and they have a young son
named Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini). But Italy is a slightly more threatening
place now. Armed troops patrol the streets day and night, and few people
will shop at the bookstore that Guido now operates because he is Jewish.</P>
<P>Suddenly, one day the German army arrives and puts an abrupt end to the
life they once knew: the order has come down for Guido and Giosue to be
arrested and taken to a concentration camp. Dora is exempt since she isn't
Jewish, but when she learns what happens, she finds the train that they are
on and insists to the Nazis that she be taken to the same camp. When they
arrive there, Guido can't bring himself to explain to Giosue what's
happening. How, after all, do you tell a 5-year-old that an insane racist
dictator has decided that he is a sub-human because he is Jewish, or that
he now lives in a place where the tiniest transgression probably means
death in a gas chamber or a crematorium? So, instead, Guido tells Giosue
that they are playing a strange sort of game, with all kinds of rules that
lead to either addition or subtraction of points. Hiding from the guards
earns you a lot of points, while crying or being hungry or wanting your
mother will cost you quite a few. Whenever Giosue comes close to realizing
what's really going on, Guido invents another set of rules to explain it,
or tells him that the other prisoners are making things up to try to get
him to lose points.</P>
<P>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL has been criticized by some who claim that it makes a
joke of the Holocaust. The thing I realized as I watched the film, however,
is that--and I'll explain this as carefully as possible so as to avoid
offending anyone--in a way, the Holocaust *is* a joke. Certainly an
unimaginably cruel one, and not one that really makes you laugh, but
nevertheless a joke in that it is fundamentally absurd and ridiculous. In
one scene that is simultaneously hilarious and sad, the guards ask who
among the prisoners knows German, because they want to explain the camp's
regulations to the Italian prisoners. Guido, not wanting Giosue to hear the
real regulations, claims he can speak German and proceeds to translate the
guard's instructions with things like, "We play the parts of the big mean
guys who scream all the time. Avoiding us gets you 50 points. And no
complaining for more food! The other day I complained and ate two whole
meals' worth and lost 100 points!"</P>
<P>Obviously this is brilliant tragicomedy in its own right, but think about
the implications here. Are the rules Guido is inventing any more ludicrous
than the idea of uncooperative prisoners being gassed to death in a shower?
If someone claimed this was happening in the United States as we speak,
wouldn't you laugh at them? Recently, while surfing the Internet, I came
across a web site which claimed that the Freemasons had built an elaborate
underground base under the Denver Airport where reptile aliens were using
abducted children as slave labor and then eating them when they became too
weak to continue working. Once I got past the initial shock at the horrific
imagery, I must admit my next reaction was to laugh. Not because I find the
idea of aliens eating children inherently humorous, of course, but because
it seemed funny that anyone could actually come up with such a ridiculous
idea in the first place. Is Nazism any more inherently farcical than this?
I don't think so. The only real difference is that, somehow, Nazism
actually happened, whereas (let's hope) this alien invasion is just a
paranoid fantasy. What Benigni has realized, I think, is that while it is
understandably a sensitive subject, it is no less deserving of mockery and
satire than these other examples of ideological lunacy. In fact, in one
scene, when Giosue has heard about the crematorium from other prisoners,
Guido convinces him they were lying simply by arguing that the story is too
crazy to be believed.</P>
<P>Part of the reason it seems so farcical, of course, is that it is so
difficult to imagine such abject and inhuman evil existing in a world that
most people take for granted as a basically decent place. Guido does what
he does mostly for the sake of his son, but we get the feeling that he
himself kind of wants to believe that this is all just some ridiculous
game. The only time that he comes face to face with one of the infamous
piles of skeletons that have become known to most of us through various
Holocaust documentaries, he and Giosue are wandering through a thick
nighttime fog, and he is mumbling to himself that perhpas it is all a
dream. This is also, I think, the purpose of the first hour of the film,
which in my opinion has been unfairly maligned by critics as being too
silly and slight in comparison to the Holocaust horrors that follow. It's
not just character development: it's also establishing the stark contrast
between the relatively pleasant (though increasingly restricted) life that
Guido's family led in comparison to the misery of the concentration camp.
We may find ourselves wondering how the film can shift so suddenly in tone,
and, by extension, how these things can all exist in the same world.</P>
<P>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't quite earn four stars from me, mostly because I
had a little trouble actually accepting the premise, however
thought-provoking it may be. Little children may be gullible, but they can
still tell when they are surrounded by misery and suffering, and they would
not stay willingly in such a place regardless of what their parents may
tell them. Giosue protests that he doesn't want to play the game any more
at one point, but Guido manages to calm him down a little too easily.
Logically, I think he'd have reached a point where he would have insisted
that they stop regardless of the consequences or the possible rewards of
winning the game, and I certainly don't think he'd have made it through
more than a few days at the camp without crying or begging for his mother.</P>
<P>Nazism has been portrayed many times over in various art forms, usually
with an understandably grim seriousness. I can't recall anyone ever
addressing it with the bitter and viciously mocking satire that it receives
in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, however, and Benigni is to be praised for his
creative and intelligent approach to such a difficult subject.</P>
