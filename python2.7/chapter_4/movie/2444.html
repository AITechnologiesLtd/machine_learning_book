<PRE>                                    SUGAR HILL
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<P>Directed by Leon Ichaso  
Written by Barry Michael Cooper
Starring Wesley Snipes, Michael Wright, Theresa Randle, Abe Vigoda,
Ernie Hudson, and Clarence Williams III
MPAA Rating     "R" 
Running Time    Approx. 110 minutes</P>
<PRE>---</PRE>
<P>     Wesley Snipes is starting the year solo!  After recent pairings
with everyone from Dennis Hopper to Sly Stallone, the back-to-brunette
actor has returned to NEW JACK territory as another KING OF NEW YORK.</P>
<P>     In the downbeat drama SUGAR HILL, Snipes stars as a Harlem hood
who's ready to retire.  For years, Romello and his brother (Wright)
have been dealing drugs for a neighborhood gangster (Vigoda).  But
Romeo's tired of the trade.  He's knows what's ahead--including a rival
dealer (Hudson)--and wants to "get out." Unfortunately, Romello's
"retirement" is threatened by obligations to both his brother and his
junkie father (Williams).</P>
<P>     Forget SUGAR HILL's moral slant, the *cast* is the best reason to
watch this film.</P>
<P>     Snipes is great and always worth watching.  He's backed by former
"Mod Squad-er" Clarence Williams III, a knock-out as the drugged dad.
Father's final scene is the most chilling in the film.  Less impressive
is Michael Wright, who twitches more than Samuel Jackson in JUNGLE
FEVER.  And don't forget Abe Vigoda's genial gangster.  He gets the
best lines *and* the best monologue.</P>
<P>     Of course, *everyone* in SUGAR HILL gets a monologue.  Which is
the problem.</P>
<P>     Barry Michael Cooper's script is way too talky.  Yap yap yap and
everyone keeps talking.  Here's a first: a gangster film with more
speeches than murders!  Don't look to director Leon Ichaso--he doesn't
know when cut his characters off.  So every scene d-r-a-g-s.  *Then*
come the flashbacks, which stop the film cold.</P>
<P>     The intrusive soundtrack doesn't know when to quit, either.</P>
<P>     But there are *some* rewards to the overdone drama.  In addition
to the acting, the photography is handsome, the humor is rich, and the
message is frank.  Not a bad balance for a "butt bruiser."</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     SUGAR HILL is a downbeat drug drama that's too talky
                 for its own good.  Excellent actors and high production
                 values can't disguise this long-sit.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
