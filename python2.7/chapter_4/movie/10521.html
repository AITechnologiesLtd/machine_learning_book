                              JACKIE BROWN</PRE>
<P> With all the betrayals among almost all the characters in this
crime-caper film, the laughs come fast and frequent.  Just about the
only non-betrayer is the white bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert
Forster) who is attracted to the black airline stewardess cum cash
smuggler Jackie Brown (Pam Grier).   Strong performances by both aid
immensely in the enjoyment and believability of the film,.</P>
<P> Jackie, who works for a small airline, adds to her income by
smuggling cash for the gunrunner, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson).
In fact that is where she gets in big trouble with a Los Angeles
policeman, Dargus (Michael Bowen) and  Federal government agent,
Nicolette (Michael Keaton) who would like to throw Robbie in jail.
For this they need the help of Jackie.   Caught with the cash, she
is given the option of naming Ordell as the real owner of the money,
or they will see that she goes to jail . . . and she promises
herself she is never going to go to jail.</P>
<P> What makes the movie a delight are the full-fleshed characters, all
played skillfully and frequently sympathetically.    There is, of
course, Robbie, who has a young floozie living in one of his
hideouts.   That is Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda in perhaps her
best acting) as a nymphet.    Playing off each other is the somewhat
dim-witted Louis Gara (Robert De Niro in a delightful role he must
have enjoyed doing immensely).    Melanie, who looks like a dumb
blonde turns out to be quite a bit less stupid than one would have
guessed.   Some very funny dialog when Robbie asks Gara if he went
to bed with Melanie whom he had instructed to "take care of Gara"
while Robbie was going out for a bit.</P>
<P> Bail bondsman Forster is perfect for his role as is Pam Grier with
her crooked smile. With good dialog by Quentin Tarantino the movie,
while not as good as his    PULP FICTION, is one not to be missed.
For one thing, while there are substantial amounts of gore,
Tarantino wisely opted to keep imuch of it off-screen.  Movies have
already reached the point of overdoing mayhem and blood.   Time the
directors pulled back a bit and left something to our imagination.
In this, Tarantino succeeds nicely.</P>
<PRE>          Based on Elmore Leonard's book, RUM PUNCH.</PRE>
