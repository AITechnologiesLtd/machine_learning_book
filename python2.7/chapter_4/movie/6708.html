<P>     For every happy, "traditional" family, there's one that fits under 
the broad envelope of "dysfunctional."  In general, motion pictures are 
made about those in the latter category rather than the former, because 
the dramatic potential is better.  MARVIN'S ROOM, based on the play of 
the same name, is one of those movies that delves beneath the thinly-
applied varnish covering the gaping holes in a series of sundered family 
relationships.  Like Andre Techine's MA SAISON PREFEREE, what begins as 
an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web 
of pain, guilt, and uncertainty.   </P>
<P>     Scott McPherson's play, MARVIN'S ROOM, debuted on stage in New York 
six years ago. McPherson went on to write the film's screenplay before 
succumbing to AIDS-related complications.  And, while the narrative is 
not intended to be biographical, McPherson nevertheless drew heavily on 
his own experiences while writing it.  Director Jerry Zaks widens the 
canvas here, expanding the film's locales to a Florida beach and 
Disneyworld while continuing to maintain the level of emotional 
intensity that makes this a memorable story. </P>
<P>     Bessie (Diane Keaton) and Lee (Meryl Streep) are sisters who have 
gone their separate ways.  Twenty years ago, a bitter quarrel over 
family responsibilities split them, and they haven't spoken since.  
Bessie gave up her life to return to the family home in Florida and play 
the role of caregiver for her father, Marvin (Hume Cronyn), who had a 
stroke, and her bedridden aunt (Gwen Verdon).  Lee, unwilling to accept 
such a personal sacrifice, went her own way.  She had two children, Hank 
(Leonardo DiCaprio) and Charlie (Hal Scardino), that she has struggled 
to raise on her own. </P>
<P>     Now, Bessie has been diagnosed with leukemia, and her survival may 
depend on a bone marrow transplant from a family member.  This leads to 
an awkward and inevitable reunion between the sisters.  Lee and her two 
sons travel to Florida -- Lee to revisit the past; Charlie and Hank to 
meet the aunt they never knew.  But all is not well between these 
characters.  Hank's rebelliousness, which landed him in a mental 
institution, threatens to explode into the open, and the tension between 
Lee and Bessie is palpable. </P>
<P>     MARVIN'S ROOM deals with a number of potentially-depressing 
subjects:  mental illness, child abuse, repressed memories, buried 
guilt, and terminal cancer.  In many ways, however, this film is not a 
downer, because it encourages us to look at the good things in a day-to-
day existence.  MARVIN'S ROOM is about three people in damaged 
relationships coming together.  Nothing is really resolved by the time 
we reach the somewhat abrupt ending, but the seeds of hope have been 
planted. </P>
<P>     The focus of MARVIN'S ROOM is coming to terms with the consequences 
of one's actions and using the healing power of love to cleanse 
festering wounds.  Lee pursued her "dreams" and ended up with a broken 
life.  Selfishness turned her into a bitter, resentful person; guilt has 
gnawed at her soul for twenty years.  Bessie, on the other hand, who has 
sacrificed everything to care for her aunt and father, is fulfilled and 
content.  In her own words, "I've had such love in my life.  I look 
back, and I've had such love."  In a perverse way, Lee holds that 
against her.  However, before Lee can begin to confront her own demons, 
she must resolve her unclear feelings about her sister, her children, 
and her father.  </P>
<P>     Most of MARVIN'S ROOM is dialogue, as one might expect from a play-
to-film script.  There are a few missteps.  For example, Aunt Ruth is 
devised primarily as a source of comic relief, but there are times when 
the humor feels forced and artificial.  There are also a few occasions 
when character interaction falls into over-familiar patterns.  Some of 
the early scenes between Lee and Bessie unfold in a too-predictable 
fashion. </P>
<P>     Yet, even on those occasions when the screenplay falters, the 
actors are there to take up the slack.  MARVIN'S ROOM's most valuable 
asset is a trio of superlative performances:  Meryl Streep as the 
conflicted Lee, Diane Keaton as the saintly-but-frightened Bessie, and 
Leonardo DiCaprio as the lonely, rebellious Hank.  It's impossible to 
decide who does the best job here.  Each has their own particular series 
of moments, and, by the time the final credits roll, Lee, Bessie, and 
Hank have been developed into fully-rounded characters.  What's more, 
the often-subtle changes to each of their personalities have been 
effectively realized by the actors. </P>
<P>     Robert DeNiro, cast against type, is seen in a rare supporting 
performance as a well-meaning doctor.  Hume Cronyn spends most of his 
time unconscious or mumbling as the title character, but he does have a 
pair of magical scenes, one of which occurs at the end.  Hal Scardino is 
fine as Charlie, and Gwen Verdon enables us to feel for a character 
whose primary purpose is to make us laugh when there are so many reasons 
to cry. </P>
<P>     It takes a lot of thought and reflection to untangle all the 
complex relationships revealed throughout MARVIN'S ROOM.  In the end, 
however, the image that lingers is one of promise.  Sure, there's a 
tragedy here, but, ultimately, I think the tone of MARVIN'S ROOM is far 
more positive than the subject matter might lead anyone to believe. </P>
