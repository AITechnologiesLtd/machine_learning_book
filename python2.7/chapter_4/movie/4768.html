<P>     Released in 1971, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was Sean Connery's final
"official" turn as James Bond (although he eventually starred in NEVER
SAY NEVER AGAIN, 1983's THUNDERBALL remake).  After skipping ON HER
MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, Connery was lured back to the 007 role by an
extremely lucrative offer that made him the highest-paid actor at the
time.  His presence, in addition to a few typically-energetic action
sequences, is about the only thing that makes this film worthwhile,
however.  By the time DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was produced, the series had
begun to slip into the stagnancy that would mar Roger Moore's first two
outings, LIVE AND LET DIE and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.</P>
<P>     For this outing, most of the behind-the-scenes crew from GOLDFINGER
was reassembled, probably with the hope of duplicating the 1964 film's
success.  Guy Hamilton again directed, Ted Moore wore the
cinematographer's cap, and mainstays Richard Maibaum (screenplay) and
John Barry (score) continued their association with the series.  Shirley
Bassey, who belted out "Goldfinger", returned to lend her vocal gifts to
the title song.  Unfortunately, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER's script
deficiencies precluded a film of comparable quality to GOLDFINGER.</P>
<P>     The seventh Bond movie opens with the British agent seeking out his
chief nemesis, Blofeld (Charles Gray), to exact revenge for the murder
of his wife, Tracy (she was shot during the final scene of ON HER
MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE).  After dispatching Blofeld, 007 accepts an
assignment to investigate diamond smuggling.  Impersonating a smuggler,
he travels from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with fifty thousand carats of
stones for reclusive multi-millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean).  No
one knows why Whyte is stockpiling diamonds, but everyone who gets
involved in the smuggling operation ends up dead.  Joining forces with
old pal Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) and "free agent" Tiffany Chase
(Jill St. John), who's also after the diamonds, Bond penetrates Whyte's
private apartments only to receive a very nasty surprise.</P>
<P>     DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is plagued with problems.  After a promising
start, the story devolves into idiocy.  The parts about diamond
smuggling and a rich eccentric hiding out in a hotel penthouse are fine,
but as soon as the script introduces Blofeld's double and a laser-
shooting satellite, things become laughably absurd, even for a Bond
movie.  The space-based science fiction elements, which are on the same
level as those in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, aren't handled nearly as well as
in a pair of later entries, MOONRAKER and GOLDENEYE.  The ending is
anticlimactic, with all of Blofeld's megalomaniacal plans foiled by the
simple expediency of stealing a cassette tape.</P>
<P>     Connery's presence elevates the movie to a remarkably high level,
but that's no surprise.  His Bond is definitive -- a pleasure to watch
even in a sub-par film.  It's easy to like DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER
exclusively because of the lead actor.  Unfortunately, the supporting
cast doesn't give him much help.  Charles Gray isn't sinister enough as
Blofeld (who, like his cat, seems to have nine lives).  In fact, of the
various actors to play this role, Gray's effete interpretation is the
worst.  Then there's Jill St. John, the first American Bond girl, who
gives one of the most irritating female performances in a 007 feature.
Norman Burton is immediately forgettable as Leiter, and Jimmy Dean plays
Whyte like a buffoon.</P>
<P>     DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER's hallmark action sequence is an extended car
chase that begins with 007 zipping across the Nevada flatlands in a
moonbuggy and ends with him careening through the streets of Las Vegas
with a fleet of police cars in pursuit.  There's also an enjoyable fight
scene where Bond is beaten up by two high-kicking women (Bambi and
Thumper).  The ending, while high on pyrotechnics, is low on tension,
bringing Connery's era to a rather dissatisfying conclusion.  The actor
deserved to go out on a higher note, but his tenure as Bond provided
enough moments of quality entertainment to eclipse DIAMONDS ARE
FOREVER's final whimper.</P>
