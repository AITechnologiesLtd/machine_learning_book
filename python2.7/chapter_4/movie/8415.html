<PRE>                                                FACE/OFF (1997)
                                       A Film Review by Jeff Shooman
                                         Copyright 1997 Jeff Shooman</PRE>
<P>First Impressions:  Truly, a good action flick.  John Woo is a master at
pulling off an action scene, even if the movie did overexaggerate that last
boat scene a tad bit.  Performances by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are
truly remarkable -- Cage is in top form and Travolta continues to exhibit his
great acting skills.<HR>-----------------------
FACE/OFF, looking at it all together, is truly a very good film.  The action
here never lets up for an instant but even more than the action, I loved the
aspect of Nicolas Cage and John Travolta switching faces.  I thought that
this premise of the movie (it was basically, the whole movie) was "awesome"
(awesome is in quotes because that has to be the most avoided word for a
movie critic...it's the same as saying "that sucked.").</P>
<P>Meaningless commentary aside, Sean Archer (Travolta/Cage) is an FBI agent who
dedicates his whole life to catching a psychopath by the name of Castor Troy
(Cage/Travolta).  Archer finally catches Troy and his equally evil brother.
 This sets off a series of events which leads Travolta's Archer to take the
face of Cage's Troy.  Through awful means, Cage's Troy then assumes the face
of Travolta's Archer.  The result is Nic Cage playing Sean Archer and John
Travolta playing Castor Troy.</P>
<P>Here, Troy's one-dimensional, slick-"cajun-bizarre" antics are brilliantly
portrayed by Mr. Travolta, who also played a psychopath in Mr. Woo's earlier
BROKEN ARROW.  However, Mr. Cage has the tougher part here:  He must deviate
from playing the wieldy sociopath to the family-loving Archer.  He lives up
to the task -- his performance is also nothing short of brilliant.  Like in
LEAVING LAS VEGAS, he plays the Archer part with a cheery sort of edge, and
the audience knows he's smarter than everyone.  That's the message that was
supposed to be conveyed:  Mission accomplished there.</P>
<P>The violent scenes in this film have led some people to denigrate movie
critics for their immense liking of the film -- they claim that the violence
in this film is dispicable, reprehensible, and a bunch of other
long-worded-adjectives.  I have to say however, that the scenes in this film,
while gory, are poetically directed by Mr. Woo.  Mr. Woo has such an eye for
action that he even pulls off the first scene in the movie, which is
disturbing as it is, with such finesse and flare that it makes you wonder
whether or not he was "born" to do this.  This first scene and the other
action scenes, especially the church scene ("Weee...what a predicament") are
masterfully directed.  If there was an Oscar for Action, Mr. Woo would make a
clean sweep.</P>
<P>The plot, inventive and unique, did suffer a bit at the end however from that
extremely drawn out boat-scene.  Again, this scene was truly remarkable,
however, some of it probably unnecessary.  This movie did not have to be two
hours and twenty minutes long, so that last scene didn't help.  But, it was
there, and the audience member must appreciate the ability to pull this
caliber of scene off.  The action here was "awesome."</P>
<PRE>RATING:  *** out of ****</PRE>
