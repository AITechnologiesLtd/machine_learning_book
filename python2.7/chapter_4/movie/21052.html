<P>Eddie Murphy is back in what is being touted by Fox as `The funniest
movie since The Nutty Professor'.  Hell, it's not even the funniest
Eddie Murphy movie since The Nutty Professor.  Well, that's true if you
can count Mulan as an Eddie Murphy movie.  And who would have thought
that the trash-talking comic would have two kiddie-pics open in
back-to-back weekends?</P>
<P>Based on the Hugh Lofting books and its 1967 musical predecessor, Doctor
Dolittle stars Murphy in the title role of a man who can communicate
with the animals.  It's a bless/curse he discovered as a child, but
blocked it out when his father (Ossie Davis, I'm Not Rappaport) sent the
family dog to the pound.</P>
<P>Dolittle resurrects his special talent when he accidentally hits a dog
in his fancy doctor utility vehicle.  The fun ensues via dozens of cameo
voice appearances by seemingly every star in Hollywood.  Half of the fun
is trying to figure out who is who and the other half is trying to read
the credits while the people in front of you stand up and scratch their
asses for the better part of five minutes.</P>
<P>I'm not saying that Doctor Dolittle is bad or boring.  In fact, it's
quite funny for the first thirty minutes, but after that it's kind of
like beating a dead horse.  A dead talking horse.  Most of the good
stuff has already appeared in the trailer and most of it can be
classified as `toilet humor' or `potty jokes', which is my favorite.</P>
<P>Murphy is pretty bland in his somewhat confined roll, but more
disappointing is the direction of Betty Thomas (Private Parts, The Late
Shift), whose previous efforts are more of a fly-on-the-wall documentary
style features.  Perhaps the limited subject matter (from first time
writer Larry Levin and The Preacher's Wife scribe Nat Mauldin) has cost
Thomas her usually brilliantly sharp comic edge.  Dolittle seems very
flat and very by-the-numbers.  But, at least it's not a musical.</P>
