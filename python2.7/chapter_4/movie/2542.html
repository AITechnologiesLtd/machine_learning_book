<PRE>                                BELLE EPOQUE
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  If one understands Spanish and the
     Spanish Civil War,        there might be more substance to this film
     than there        initially appears.  But        United States audiences
     will find this a feather-light situation comedy about an army
     deserter who gets involved        with a family with four        sexy
     daughters.         Rating: +1 (-4        to +4).</PRE>
<PRE>     This year's Academy Award for best        foreign        film went to the Spanish
film BELLE EPOQUE.  In competition with        films of much weightier        content, the
film that won was a little flip        of a movie, little more        than an        extended
"Farmer's Daughter" story set in rural Spain during the        early 1930s.  In a
time when three        factions, the Carlists,        the Monarchists, and the Republicans
are fighting each other        for possession of the country, Fernando        (played        by
young Jorge Sanz), a handsome young soldier, deserts his company.  As the
film opens he is arrested by two rather        odd Civil Guardsmen whose
disagreement over what to do with him leaves him free again.  Then he comes
to a village where a free-thinking villager Manolo (Fernando Fernan Gomez)
offers him a place to stay for the night.  In the morning Fernando plans to
head for Madrid        until he sees the arrival by train of Manolo's four
beautiful daughters.  Fernando decides to stay around to enjoy more
hospitality and        to get to know the four        daughters a little better.  What
follows        is a pleasant little tale of romantic entanglements with each of the
four daughters.</PRE>
<PRE>     There are few surprises for American audiences in this film.  Though it
has been said that the liberal attitudes the family has        is very        atypical of
the Spanish in the 30s,        they are much less shocking to Americans in the        90s
so this        film conceivably had more impact in its        native country than it will
have in        the United States.  What we see        as a background        to the story as        just
a village of moderately        interesting characters perhaps might have shocked
the Spanish audiences.        For example there is a woman who has decided to
dress and behave like a        man.  Not so shocking to us, but it reportedly was
considered outrageous behavior in Spain.  One man seems        content        to share his
wife with her lover, with whom he remains on good terms.  Again        not common
in the United States but not shocking either.</PRE>
<PRE>     There also        seems to be some political undercurrent        to what        is going on,
though it is not well explained.  One character's suicide may be related to
the war, though        it is not sufficiently explained by the        subtitles.  An alert
ear will note that there are some differences between what is being said in
Spanish        and the        subtitle translation.</PRE>
<PRE>     Fernando Trueba directed this story with touches that are a little
reminiscent of both SIRENS and any number of pleasant countryside films,
mostly from France.  BELLE EPOQUE has a        feel of        being close to nature in an
idyllic        small rural village.  While it is pleasant enough for an hour or so,
it is an odd choice for        best foreign language film of 1993.  For those who
enjoy light French pastoral comedies, I        would rate it a        +1 on the -4 to        +4
scale.</PRE>
