<P>        I don't think I have ever seen a movie with more flaws that I enjoyed more 
thouroughly than THE HANGING GARDEN. For all its sloppy direction, lapses in smart 
dialogue, amateurish acting and glaring missteps, I must say I was truly taken with this 
powerful and moving film. Canadian director Thom Fitzgerald has crafted a debut film so 
eloquently, that I'm sure his is a name Americans will know as well as Atom Egoyan's by 
the next millenium.</P>
<P>        The hanging garden of the film's title, is a small flower-garden in the backyard 
of a middle-class Nova Scotia family's acreage, where the abusive, alcoholic father 
Whiskey Mac (Peter McNeill) teaches his children the names and blooming seasons of his 
favorite flowers. Mac, it is obvious, cares more for his garden than for his children. It 
is refered to as the "hanging" garden because Mac's overweight, homosexual teenage son 
Sweet William hanged himself there after losing his virginity to a prostitute.</P>
<P>        The film opens, of course, ten years after this fact, when Sweet William (Chris 
Leavins of Saskatoon - it's nice to see a local boy do good for himself) returns to the 
family house for his sister Rosemary's (Kerry Fox) wedding. And right now you're 
thinking, But isn't Sweet William dead? Well, yes, as a matter of fact... or is he? His 
bloated teenage body still swings from a tree in the backyard, and his five-year-old self 
dances through quite a few of the film's scenes, as well. THE HANGING GARDEN is not about 
making sense or answering questions, but about coming to terms with, and (literally) 
burying the past.</P>
<P>        Rosemary (played as a teenager by the Martha Plimpton-ish Sarah Polley, also 
wowing 'em in yet another Canadian masterpiece, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, opening Stateside in 
four days) is a foul-mouthed, chainsmoking, yet loving sister to Sweet William, always 
the most supportive of the family. The fact that she's marrying the very man that William 
shared his first homosexual experience with only complicates matters, and the flirtatious 
bridegroom's passes at Sweet William are making him rather uncomfortable. The way the 
film weaves through flashbacks and present-day is reminiscant of THE SWEET HEREAFTER, yet 
neither the film, nor the direction, is up to par with Egoyan's film.</P>
<P>        The film, however brilliant, has tonnes of obvious flaws. The fact that the 
film's first and second acts have titles, yet the third does not, is one that Fitzgerald 
should've picked up on, as well as the unresolved disapperance of Sweet William's mother. 
The character of Violet (notice the flower-related names here?) is poorly realized as 
well as poorly defined, and Whiskey Mac's mother and sister are never given a chance to 
make any impressions on the viewer.</P>
<P>        I hgighly recommend you see THE HANGING GARDEN as soon as it inches its way to 
American art-houses, which should be sometime in early 1998. It and THE SWEET HEREAFTER 
would make an excellent double-bill, and it proves that, yes, you _can_ go home again - 
even ten years after your death.</P>
