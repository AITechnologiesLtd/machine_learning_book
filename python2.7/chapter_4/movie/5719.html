<PRE>                                       ALASKA
                       A film review by Alexander F. Relyea
                        Copyright 1996 Alexander F. Relyea</PRE>
<P>        Fraser Heston's new film ALASKA has scenery befitting an IMAX film  
with cinematography to match.  Unfortunately, the horrid script and the
sometimes laughable acting make you wish for more scenes without people.
ALASKA is apparently an attempt to cross FLIPPER with CLIFFHANGER, 
featuring Vincent Kartheiser (THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD) as the
Stallone character.  This works about as well as one might expect,
and the result is too much bad acting, too many plot holes, and not
nearly enough shots of the beautiful Alaskan scenery.</P>
<P>        ALASKA features Dirk Benedict as Jake Barnes, a former jumbo jet
pilot from Chicago who came to Quincy, Alaska with his two children
following the death of his wife.  Instead of flying for an airline,
Jake now flies a supply run for the small towns of Alaska.  His 
daughter Jessie (Thora Birch) is thrilled with the move because it
helps her become one with nature, and she is quite adept at handling
a kayak.  His son Sean (Kartheiser) is absolutely miserable.  There's
nothing for him to do, and he's expected to clean up when he spills
motor oil.  He drowns his sorrows in video games and his passion for
the Chicago Cubs (there is a pitiful attempt to create some cub 
symbolism throughout the movie which most audiences will mercifully 
miss).  Charlton Heston also appears from time to time as a poacher 
called Perry.  His role only ties in peripherally to the other 
characters, and although he's supposed to be evil incarnate, he 
comes across as scary as Paul Hogan in FLIPPER.</P>
<P>        The film begins with brief introductions of all the major 
characters, and most of the minor ones.  Soon after Sean tells Jake
"I wish you had died instead of Mom!", Jake is compelled to fly 
emergency medical supplies to some small town.  In the ensuing storm, 
Jessie loses radio contact with her father, and he subsequently crashes.
The search and rescue helicopter finds a gum wrapper and an old shoe
but can't find Jake's *bright yellow piper cub.*  They also manage to 
miss the flare that Jake fires.  After learning that the search is 
being aborted, Sean decides to search for his father himself.  Jessie 
insists on coming along, and the search is afoot.</P>
<P>        The kids quickly find a poacher's camp, and there they find an 
imprisoned polar bear cub.  Naturally Jessie, our budding
environmentalist, convinces Sean to help free the bear.  For some 
reason the bear, cleverly named Cubby, decides to follow the kids, and
is in turn pursued by Perry who wants him back.  Meanwhile, there are 
a number of foolish plot contrivances including the search and rescue
pilot realizing that Sean and Jessie have gone to look for their 
father by finding a bunch of backwoods equipment *on their kitchen
table.*  Cubby effectively adopts Sean, and the relationship is 
consummated in a weird dream sequence which I did not recognize as such
until the credits.</P>
<P>        I won't bore you with the details of the trials and tribulations
that the three face on their way to rescue Jake (without a travois or
any form of radio), but Heston isn't as generous.  The poorly written
script treats Sean most harshly, but Kartheiser's overdone performance
earns him no sympathy.  Perry's function appears to be one of spouting
platitudes, and his opening soliloquy is bound to cause titters.  The
soundtrack is a nightmare, written as if the bombastic score will 
enhance a flat story and fill the holes in the plot.  ALASKA is only
worth watching if you ignore the eminently forgettable characters, and
consider the film as sponsored by the Alaska Department of Tourism,
and it is on that basis that I give it *1/2 of ****.</P>
