<PRE>                                  CLUELESS
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1995 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>     I hate to be blunt, but CLUELESS stinks.  It's a really bad movie
on so many levels.  Think of CLUELESS as a FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH
for the 90s for two reasons: they were both directed by Amy Heckerling
and they both stink.  In a movie season so devoid of comedy, CLUELESS
is not what we need, not now and not ever.</P>
<P>     CLUELESS stars Alicia Silverstone as a pouty rich girl that no one
watching this film should identify with or care about.  (By the way
Alicia, you've got that pouting expression down pat, move on.)  She and
her rich friends go through terrible troubles in this film such as
hoping this guy likes me and wondering what to wear.  Oooooo.  Also,
these kids talk like juvinile Dennis Miller clones without the humor.
I'm 20 years old.  I graduated high school and even spent some time in
college and no one I ever came across could use every word in the
dictionary in a sentence.  So, we are supposed to believe that these
brain dead, drinking, dope smoking, immature idiots who don't know
their left from their right have time between shopping and grooming and
partying and exercise routines to sit down and read the American
Heritage Dictionary cover to cover??  Now that might be funny if they
were using the words wrong, but in every occasion they are absolutely
right.  I want anyone who talks like this or knows anyone who talks
like this to drop me a line.</P>
<P>     Back to the movie, CLUELESS is just awful.  Have I said that?
Well, I can't stress it enough.  The worst thing for a comedy to be is
unfunny, which is what CLUELESS is.  There is a laugh here and there,
but I think I was laughing at things that weren't meant to be funny.
And someone tell me if this film is supposed to be satire, because to
me, there needs to be a normal character in this film to point out the
satire.  Stay far, far away from CLUELESS.</P>
