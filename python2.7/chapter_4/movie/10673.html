<P>Titanic - The Most Expensive Curate's Egg</P>
<P>"Titanic" is, like the famous curate's egg, "good in parts", but uneven
overall.</P>
<P>Firstly, I like the idea of the framing story. I like it because it adds to
the sense of the transitoriness of life. It's rather like seeing someone dig
up the remains of an Egyptian mummy when you have just been seeing a movie
about the love life of the Egyptian. I think the two era plot structure is
one that works well.</P>
<P>Secondly, I do like much about the romance. Class was an important part of
the times. It has been said, and not only by the publicists, that the
sinking of that ship marked the beginning of the end of a certain idea of
society. It's not a bad idea to use a cross class love story to do that. I
also like the idea of her feeling stifled by convention and feeling she
wants to escape. I like the idea that Jack liberates her to lead the life
she wants. All this was POTENTIALLY excellent.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I liked the time machine element of the film. That it places us ON
the boat, with many people whose fates we care about (even though not - for
me - the lovers). Most disaster movies have a big problem in that we don't
get time to learn anything about anybody, or to care about them. It was
fascinating to walk that boat, looking exactly as it did look (there's a
computer game that is also very good for this - the art direction matches
absolutely). Cameron did me a favour in introducing me to the real
historical characters. All that stuff fascinated me.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I loved that James Cameron fell in love with his material and got
obsessive over it. I think that when it came to dealing with the reality
this showed. He did not take too many liberties with it.</P>
<P>Fifth. The scale. The sheer scale of the movie. It took a lot of ambition
and determination to get it done. I admire Cameron for that.</P>
<P>Sixth. The engine room and the furnaces. A glimpse into the hell of the
manual labourer. The movie showed well how one class slaved to make life
pleasant for another. There was a WORLD on that ship. It's a strong metaphor
for an entire society. I'd like to have seen more middle class though.</P>
<P>Seventh. Transitions. Past to present. Life to death. The feeling that we
all love in the face of death, and because of that we should love as fully
and as well as can in whatever time is allotted to us.</P>
<P>Eighth. Tragedy. The film makes us more aware of something that existed in
our consciousness but that had not really been brought home to many of us.
The scenes of the ship going down were disturbing and breathtaking. As they
should have been. We had time to see who was dying and how they died. We had
time to see the bravery and the cowardice. And I, for one, loved the
musicians. Incredible to have had that kind of courage. Not the kind that
gets you publicity or does you any good. Just a devotion to duty. The stern
crashing down on survivors, the boat rowing through the dead. These are
images no-one who has seen them will ever forget. Even an image of crockery
falling off a dresser had power.</P>
<P>Ninth. Aftermath. Even in Ismay's face, as he sits in the boat of survivors,
we know this is a man who is aware he is ruined. There are stories that go
beyond the boundaries of the movie. Everything is not wrapped up, but hints
are there. I liked how she hid from Cal too. Much better than the
conversation in the first draft, although that conversation had made Cal a
bit more sympathetic.</P>
<P>There's more too. When I reviewed this movie I told people they had to go
see it. Maybe it is worth half a dozen Oscars, as before. I have been
telling people they should see it all week.</P>
<P>So, yes there is much to be grateful for. I talk about this movie, because
almost alone of movies I've seen lately it deals with big subjects, and big
ideas. If only it had raised the central story to this level I would have
found it perfect. And there aren't many movies you can say that about.</P>
<P>So much about the film is good, very good, even excellent, that it's a pity
that other things let it down so badly.</P>
<P>When Cameron is dealing with reality, as with the sinking itself, I think
it's terrific. But the problem is that Cameron is a good director but
a bad scriptwriter. Billy Zane's character is a melodramatic pantomime
villain complete with evil henchman. At no point in the movie does he rise
above being a one-dimensional bad guy.</P>
<P>It's this black and white sense of morality,  that , in my view, brings the
movie down. Zane is so vile that the mother might as well sell her daughter
into white slavery as force her to marry him. There'd have been other,
better prospects.</P>
<P>In this movie, poor people are all good. Rich people are all bad, unless
they were poor people originally.</P>
<P>Much about Titanic is great. I think it brings home the event far better
than I'd ever have expected, but if that central love story had been about
real flesh and blood people, with their mixture of good and bad, it would
have been better. It could have been one of the greatest movies ever made,
but in its attempt to pander to today's audience (Kate Winslet giving
someone the finger, as an example) it is less.</P>
<P>Review after review, has noticed clunky dialogue, stupid anachronisms, the
unsuitability of diCaprio, and a willingness to pander to contemporary
audiences. In other words the script is immature and aimed at today's
immaturity of audience attention.</P>
<P>The "defy authority" stuff turns it into Titanic meets Porky's. Of course,
audiences liked "Porky's" too. Fine. More people buy pocket romances than
Tolstoy. It does not make them better.</P>
<P>It was embarrassing in old period movies where people said: "There's that
young Beethoven. He's going to be great some day." It's just as embarrassing
when Cameron does similar things with Picasso and Freud. It's a plain
stupidity to put Picasso's "Les Demoiselles D'Avignon" on the ship. Unless
he's trying to suggest the girl was stupid enough to buy a forgery.</P>
<P>James Cameron almost had a great work of art on his hands. He did not. He is
a clumsy scriptwriter. The movie would NOT have been made worse had the
characters been more credible. It would have been better. It was set  in
Edwardian times. That does not mean the script has to be Edwardian
melodrama. In fact "The Age of Innocence" or any Austen adaptation can see
more complexity in their characters.</P>
<P>There are things in this movie that are great, yet at the end of the movie I
cared more about the Captain than the lovers. Almost every character based
on a real person was better drawn than the fictional ones.</P>
<P>Why did we have to sit through clunky lines like Bill Paxton's "I never got
it before. I get it now"? Or "A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets"?</P>
<P>If the film is already good, what would Cameron have lost by making it
better? And a good script collaborator with less of a tin ear and more of a
sense of period would have helped.</P>
<P>This film deserves several Oscars. But not best script. The cheapest thing
to fix, in all that budget, would have been the script.</P>
