<P>If John Steinbeck were alive today, he would be proud. The use of one
man as a metaphor for many, a theme so prevalent in his great American
novels, is also a principal element in EDTV. This latest
media-versus-man movie, which might be loosely grouped with last
summer's semiparanoia drama THE TRUMAN SHOW, gives us director Ron
Howard's take on issues of celebrity, fame, misadventure, and the road
less traveled. If not for the been-there-done-that feeling stapled to
EDTV in the wake of THE TRUMAN SHOW this movie would be an innovative
dramedy with much to say and a rather cute means of exhortation. </P>
<P>EDTV starts at RealTV, a cable television network which specializes in
the FOX vein of it-actually-happened programming. Although the network
is in a slump -- losing to the Gardening Channel, in fact -- program
director Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) has a hot idea. To boost
ratings, the network will hold casting calls for a regular individual
and then film his life twenty-four hours a day, indefinitely. Cynthia
chooses San Francisco local Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) almost by
chance, and soon our unassuming protagonist has more fame then he knows
what to do with. It alienates his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman) and
his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson), and it even causes doubts in Ed's
mind as to whether or not this new life is truly what he bargained for. </P>
<P>The ending is a clever escape, but it's not what the audience bargained
for, and in that sense it's similar to the Peter Weir-directed THE
TRUMAN SHOW. In fact, a large percentage of the script is lifted the
Weir film, and those who watch these films together will undoubtedly
find countless similarities. However, while THE TRUMAN SHOW prefers to
run in metaphorical circles and dance with esoteric symbolism, EDTV
chooses to focus on a literal message. Any larger elements are purely
speculative during the picture, and only upon viewing the film straight
through is there any merit to thematic criticism. Director Howard's
internal message is simple and straightforward: the grass is greener on
the other side. </P>
<P>The grass may be greener on the other side for Ed Pekurny, but certainly
not for Matthew McConaughey, and this is one of the film's only
shortcomings. The cast is a dynamic bunch of individuals, well chosen in
sum and critical to success individually, but the themes do not befit a
lot of Hollywood veterans. McConaughey is not credible in the everyman
role of Ed, and he seems to play the character off the wall rather than
down to earth. Most of Ed's family, including Woody Harrelson, are
similarly loony, and they don't help the realism. Truly, only Jenna
Elfman (TV's "Dharma and Greg") gives a standout performance as Ed's
girlfriend Sheri, and the character itself as well as society's reaction
to it is one of the most realistic parts of the movie.</P>
<P>Then again, EDTV is a fantasy product, designed to suspend reality and
surround itself with "what-ifs." In this respect it's a thought-
provoking product, and very much the equal of THE TRUMAN SHOW. </P>
