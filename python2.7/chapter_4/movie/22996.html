<P>The official website notes that "Straight From The Streets is a feature 
length film based on the realities of urban life, expressed through the 
artistic medium of rap music and hip-hop culture".  Being a child of the 
70's myself, I'm...resistant...to most of what I've seen and heard in 
hardcore rap music--but having an open mind, I agreed to review this 
documentary (produced and directed by Keith O'Derek).  After looking, 
unsuccessfully, for the DVD, I actually found it on tape at the local 
Blockbuster Video [quite a feat, considering Lansing "Where Tha Black 
Peeple At?" Michigan ain't exactly Culture City, USA].  If it were up to 
me, it would be included in every Blockbuster.</P>
<P>The Story:
This real-life documentary hooked me with a quote by Kahlil Gibran...</P>
<P>    "And there are those who talk and without knowledge or forethought, 
   reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.
     And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell 
   it not in words.
     Yesterday is but today's memory, and tomorrow's dream."</P>
<P>...and revolted me with some unattributed statistics...</P>
<P>   -California's prison budget: 3.1 billion dollars
   -In 1996, California spent more on prisons than on higher education
   -16 new prisons have been built in California since 1984...and 25
    more were slated to be completed by the end of the [20th] century
   -Blacks are arrested for drug offenses five times more often than
    Whites
   -Blacks are charged under the "three strikes" rule seventeen times
    more often than Whites
   -California's fastest growing prisoner population is Black women
   -There are five times as many Black men in jail than there are
    enrolled in universities</P>
<P>...and after the revulsion passed, the jaded part of me resisted those 
statistics, almost justifying them ("well, nobody made those dummies do 
the bad stuff they did to go to prison!"). But one sobering thought 
squashed my inner grumblings: there but by the grace of God, go I.</P>
<P>The remainder of this documentary put a "face" on the statistics, in a 
way that has rarely been seen; ironically, in a way that my other 
current "Spotlight On..." film review - the drama, Thicker Than Water - 
couldn't begin to approach.  While I'm on the subject of "Thicker", I 
incorrectly compared it and "Streets" by labelling them both as movies 
about "the rap scene"; that's only partially true, about both of them.  
If I were to sum up "Streets", I'd have to do it in the words of a 70's 
soul tune: "Life ain't so easy/when you're a Ghetto Child".  The rap 
scene was a mere backdrop to the picture of L.A. from the eyes of 'hood 
residents, from the 1992 riots to 1995's Million Man March.</P>
<P>O'Derek takes us on a journey through the 'hood by way of interviews 
with the famous and infamous. Denzel Washington is briefly seen, talking 
about wanting to lobby Washington DC to "make positive change"; but the 
majority of time is spent talking to rappers like Ice-T, Ice Cube, and 
Snoop -- or, more correctly, by letting them do all the talking.  He 
also talks with up-and-coming rappers Kam (my personal favorite speaker 
of the bunch; I felt myself being drawn in by what he had to say, as 
time went on), Shiff (who is followed throughout the documentary), Lady 
Of Rage (who had some interesting views about "bitches and hoes"; 
considering her tag, you just might be surprised by what she had to say)  
among many others.</P>
<P>In an inspired move, O'Derek interweaves footage of the 1968 Watts riots 
with the 1992 L.A. riots--and strangely enough, though much lip service 
has been paid to the '68 riots being "righteous", you get the feeling 
that 30 years didn't really change much in the way Black folk were 
viewed; agree with either or not, We were far and wide seen as 
opportunistic savages, both times.</P>
<P>Over time we see, up close and personal, the effects of the 
highly-publicized (but rarely explored by mainstream media) gang truce, 
and meet Tony "Bogard" Thomas, who spearheaded the truce--and we see the 
consequences when the truce is broken.  Though the majority of time is 
spent highlighting Black neighborhoods and residents, the issue of 
coalitions and separatism between Blacks and Latinos was also explored.  
All in all, the name of the game was not so much rap as a business, but 
rap (and "low riders", and "tagging", and even to some extent, banging) 
as an expression of life.</P>
<P>I was tempted at first to play off "Straight" as an extended version of 
"Cops"; my doing so would've done it a great injustice: O'Derek was no 
simple voyeur into a world in which he had nothing vested, and neither 
were those whom he interviewed.  He neither glorified that world, nor 
condemned it; instead, he left the 'hood speak for itself, in its own 
words.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I found myself more easily identifying with Denzel Washington--someone 
who the rest of the celebrities interviewed would no doubt be considered 
an "outsider" (even though he, like me, came up from the same streets as 
Cube & Co. did, albeit at a much different time.  Hell, the difference 
feels like we came up in a much different *universe*).  I found my 
normal knee-jerk reactions to the knuckleheads and bangers fading into 
the background, replaced by a willingness to truly listen to what they 
were saying.  I'm not born-again Hard, but I can certainly appreciate a 
different viewpoint than I did before.  I still say that "both" [as if 
there were only two] sides need to shut up for a few years and really 
listen to what the other side has to say; and I believe that coalition, 
not separatism, is the only way any of us are gonna get out of this 
jungle alive.  But a thought occurs to me: what if The Powers That Be, 
in full recognition of the power of coalition, really is doing all It 
can to keep the powerless us (in all the variations of "us"), powerless?  
Hmmm...</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
There are many aspects of this documentary that I can't begin to address 
in this small space; I reckon you'll just have to see it for yourself.  
Be sure to check out Straight From The Streets, available for purchase 
direct from Upfront Productions, and hopefully for rent at a Blockbuster 
near you; contact <A HREF="mailto:FilmNU@aol.com">FilmNU@aol.com</A> for more information.</P>
<P>"Straight From The Streets"  (rating: greenlight): 
"Straight" is a sobering look at a way of life which many of us will 
never know firsthand; even those of us who grew up in the ghetto of old 
(and by the way, unlike some of my contemporaries, I wear my ghetto past 
in pride), can't really Feel what it's like now, unless we do more than 
look in from the outside.  While I found myself boggling at the "Ices" 
(Ice Cube and Ice-T) seemingly excusing everything under the sun that 
Black folk do (including that which we do to each other), as if We are 
mindless children who don't know any better--it is undeniable that there 
is something way out of wack when more money is spent on incarceration, 
than on education.</P>
