<P>There was a l953 love story in the South Seas of that title, and a
runner-up title, Return to the Blue Lagoon in 1991. Return to Paradise is
not a remake of either, even though the innocent filmgoer could easily
think it is a romance in the Tropics, especially since the female lead is
Anne Heche who was so recently in the cutely sentimental Six Days Seven
Nights. Here the title is used as very black irony.</P>
<P>Three twentysomething American men spend some weeks together in Malaysia
whooping it up with wine, women and hash. Two of them, old pals, return to
New York: limo driver Sheriff and architect Tony. The third one, Lewis
(whom the others did not know before that trip) stays behind to help save
the orangutans. Two years later, in New York City, Sheriff is approached by
lawyer Beth with terrible news. After their departure from Asia, the
authorities, investigating a missing rental bicycle that the trio had
high-handedly thrown away, had found hashish used by the men. Lewis had
been arrested. Possession of drugs in certain countries can be punished
with utmost severity. The large amount found by the police called for the
death penalty. The only way Lewis can be saved is for the other men to
return to "paradise," share the blame. If both New Yorkers do this, each of
the trio gets three years in jail. If just one shows up, the imprisoned men
get six years.</P>
<P>Lewis is eight days away from execution. Beth, who represents him, tries to
persuade the two men to sacrifice years of their lives. Much of the film
follows Beth's efforts and the men's quandary, with the main stress on
Sheriff and to a lesser extent, on Tony who is about to get married. The
moral dilemma is unbearable. The process is both slow (the men's reactions
are detailed) and urgent. Beth pleads persistently, in fact with too much
dedication and humanity for a lawyer. (This is elucidated later, but too
neatly and for some in the audience, too predictably). The clock is
ticking, as the story uses a countdown (" 7 days left, five days left..."),
a familiar device but in this context without the predictable ending of
pictures about, say, atomic bombs, where, as a rule (and with serio-comic
exceptions like Dr. Strangelove) the world gets saved at the very last
minute.</P>
<P>The countdown is a gimmick, but it works, except for making one wonder why
Beth waited so long to approach the men. Though  explained, this still
feels like a an artificial device. So does a sexual relationship between
Beth and Sheriff. No matter. The slowness of the passing days keeps raising
the situation's tragic level. So, warts and all, the movie is overall a
most gripping work.</P>
<P>Where all this leads us, I cannot possibly disclose, except to say that one
crucial aspect of the plot is the irresponsibility of the press.</P>
<P>The Malaysia of the movie, obviously unfilmable in the real country, was
shot in Hong Kong, Macao and Thailand, standing in for the island of
Penang, one of the 13 states of the Federation of Malaysia. The photography
and the sets are exquisite, with both urban scenes and landscapes made
enormously appealing, a true paradise for the three companions. But no
doubt, in Malaysia this movie will be banned as (I cannot say why) its
national pride, shown as excessive, is bound to upset that country.</P>
<P>The movie is a remake of a 1989 French film I had never heard of, Force
Majeure (Uncontrollable Circumstances) directed by Pierre Jolivet whose
work I know very little. His cast included solid French actors as well as
Kristin Scott Thomas as the female lead.</P>
<P>>From what I gather, Return to Paradise is not doing well in theaters, which
is what would expect, since this is not "entertainment" but as far from a
feel-good movie as can be. All the more reason to catch it now.</P>
