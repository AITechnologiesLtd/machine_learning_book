<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>The sad thing about this film, for Americans, is that it is slow.  It is a
film, like Daniel's father Ingmar, that is given to detail, and the
minute nuances that are still taught at many acting schools.  It is an
outstanding film, probably a bit more "open" than the father's pictures,
which tend to be mired in the emotional upheaval of the characters. Unlike
his father, Daniel stands back, and allows them to look sheepish, and at
times selfish, until the realization hits them, that while they meant well,
they did not do very well.</P>
<P>This is a story, written by Ingmar Bergman himself, about his own growing up
in a religious family, whose motives were not questioned, and whose desires
were very idealistic.  Pu, has an admiration for his father, but it isn't
very clear weather it is because of the rather stern exterior and belief
system, or if it is because the father is right.  The father is not always
right, and as Pu gets older, and now famous, facing his father, the elder
Bergman is having problems coming to grips with his own idealism.  Ingmar
(Pu), has been expressing all of his idealism on film and studying it.  The
father has taken it all in, and is now suffering some terrible delusions,
most of them from feeling like he failed as a father, since the mother asked
for a divorce and left.</P>
<P>The great thing about this, is to watch, in the end, Ingmar's own stern
conduct, in dealing with his father, just when he has reached
a level of fame in the world cinema.  The father has not succeeded, or if he
did he does not feel this way.  And Ingmar is not interested in wallowing in
the garbage, as is not Daniel, in doing this film. It is a bit brutal, in
many ways, but it does force a sort of
therapy on the old man, that is working, however slowly.</P>
<P>Daniel Bergman is showing that he is also a fabulous director, like his own
dad, whose legacy is without question one of the great
accomplishments in the history of film.  Daniel, unlike his father, has the
ability of allowing the camera to move a little more than
his own father, thus making the film a little more bearable for an audience
that is used to fast paced films... but it is STILL painfully
slow, and difficult to appreciate, unless we make a commitment to do so.</P>
<P>Like Sven Nykvist, with Ingmar so many times, Tony Forsberg comes off as a
visual dynamo that makes this film alive.  It is visually striking, and
colorful.  It helps the film live.  With Sven's "quiet" camera, this film
would have been exactly like the father's material ... stoic, but effective.</P>
<P>With excellent acting, and a very well written script, covering some thirty
to forty years, this film can only signify that the younger
Bergman is on the way to try and outdo his own father.  And it helps to have
the father provide a script of his own experience
to help lead the way... similar to the story, isn't it...???</P>
<P>I suppose that the funny thing was to see an actor playing the older Bergman
confronting his own father in 1968.... I think it would have been a bit
"selfish" not to, but it would have added another dimension to the film.....
the Bergman's of today are involved
in a religious offering called film.... the Bergman's of yesterday were
involved in the good book.... and there is a difference in
the end... you must see the film to catch it.</P>
