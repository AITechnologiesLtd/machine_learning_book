<P>Watching LOST AND FOUND, I was struck by a sense of deja-vu. LOST AND
FOUND feels like a Taiwanese tearjerker caught on the Chunking Express,
only without the latter's edginess. This was partly because of the
film's female protagonist, songbird Kelly Chen , who is a dead ringer
for 70s soap queen Lin Chin Hsia. And the male lead, Aniki Jin, also
acted in the latter film.</P>
<P>The opening paean establishes the subdued, melancholy, slightly
dissipated tone of the film as the camera pans along the dirty streets
and sad faces of the inhabitants to convey the desolation and alienation
of modern life.</P>
<P>Predictably, but engagingly so, the film brightens up with the
appearance of Cheng (Aniki Jin), who bursts upon the screen in a furore
of energy, rummaging through the dustbin for lost wallets and giving
directions on his handphone simultaneously. The loss of his handphone
provides the opportunity for the two protagonists to meet. Kelly
discovers that Cheng specializes in finding lost things, his motto
being "nothing is lost forever." A note of existential angst creeps in
when Kelly asks Cheng to help herfind her "hope."</P>
<P>Cheng then shows his perceptiveness when he asks Kelly whether hope is a
thing or a person. In a series of flashbacks, we are shown Kelly's
recent history from a first-person point of view. Kelly is the daughter
of the second wife of a self-made shipping </P>
<P>magnate with twelve children. A new graduate from an overseas
university, she is determined to prove herself not only in her father's
firm, but to her father, with whom she has an uneasy love-hate
relationship. Being equally unable to articulate their fee</P>
<P>lings, their stubborn nature drives them to set up an employment
interview for Kelly at the family film. Shockingly, Kelly takes this
public opportunity to break the news of her leukaemia to her father.</P>
<P>Running from her imminent death, and her dysfunctional father-daughter
relationship, Kelly meets Ted, a sailor (Michael Wong) who comes from a
barren rock in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland. It's a place
the natives call "the End of the World," where everybody has left, and
only returns to be buried. In her wretched state, Kelly responds to the
doomed gloominess of the place, and, briefly, to Ted. When her
treatment leaves her too depressed, she decides to give up hope and
face death as romanticism. But Ted has disappeared.</P>
<P>The rest of the plot is predictably straightforward. She hires Cheng to
find Ted for her, and succeeds after an odyssey through the labyrinth
of the city. Ted is about to leave for his grandfather's funeral, but
he invites Kelly to join him once his grandfather's ashes are ready to
be taken home to the island.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Kelly volunteers to help Cheng. Searching for things ranging
from the most trivial to the most bizarre, Kelly is fuelled by Cheng's
zest for life and upbeat optimism in the face of impossible odds. She
realizes that Cheng is essentially a lonely man whose job is an excuse
to reach out to people by helping them. In between searching for wild
ducks, and accepting the sobering proximity of death, Kelly falls for
Cheng. However,  she decides to leave him in order to spare him the
heartbreak of eventually losing her to the illness, and leaves for
Scotland. Will Kelly find true love? Will they find each other again?
Unfortunately for my patience, the forgone conclusion was dragged out by
Kelly's Scottish sojurn.</P>
<P>The leitmotif behind the film is the constant search for identity. in a
metaphorical vein, Cheng's attempts to define Kelly turn out to be wrong
because only she can decide who she is. Cheng is insistent upon the
correct term of address, that his name is "The Worm," not "Mr Worm" or
"Mr The." Later, in Scotland, we see that Ted's venture into traditional
highland dress is totally commercial, a tourist side-show. Unfortunately
the development of this motif isn't consistent. The ending, where Kelly
is identified through her place in the family she has left, seems to be
a compromise. Instead of an individual decision, social, monetary and
familial constraints have together bound her to an identity she is only
able to escape by virtue of her death.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the film's obligatory singing scene, though it was rather
sentimental. Both Kelly's and Aniki's singing skills were adequately
showcased, and the mood was joyously retro, especially the dancing scene
-- hence very modern. The soundtrack, on the whole, was engaging,
especially the traditional "Griogal Cridhe" in the Scottish scenes. At
some parts, however, I was uncomfortably reminded of SIA and British
Airways advertisements, and I felt that the film was unrealistic for not
only glorifying foreign lands but also in the saving grace of humnan
relationships.</P>
<P>In the end, LOST AND FOUND didn't make me cry, but some time during the
screening, I found myself a little more hopeful about relationships
again.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.
