<P>   At age thirty, more cells perish than get reborn, or so the
biologists say.  Luckily, though, passion does not have to
die, though you'd work hard to convince some people of that.  So
if at age 60, 70, 80 and beyond you head for the sexual exits,
you'd be guilty of premature evacuation.  How do we know?  Paul
Cox tells us so, in fact he doesn't tell us, he shows us and oh,
my, how well he does this in his signature restrained manner.  In
his film "Innocence," he deals with a love between a man and
woman each about 70 years of age--not a paternal or avuncular
kind of love, not the so-called deep and platonic type, but real,
adolescent-style hunger and fulfillment.  Since the chances are
good that most of us will reach the age of 70--which, however
unappealing this may be to some of us sure beats the alternative-
-"Innocence" speaks to us all.  We're curious.  What's sex going
to be like then?</P>
<P>   That's not all.  "Innocence" is inviting as well because, admit
it: you're wondering about your first love, and maybe
your second or third as well.  How is they doing now?  Happily
married?  Miserable and single?  Creative and celebrated or
nonentities and invisible?  Even now in the Internet age, I'll bet
most of us know nothing about the people we dated ten, twenty,
thirty years ago but the memories persist and we're downright
curious, aren't we?</P>
<P>   Andreas (Charles Tingwell), a 69-year-old living in Adelaide,
South Australia, sure is.  He has a grown, caring daughter, but
his wife died at an early age leaving him a lonely man who learns
that the woman with him he had a passionate affair fifty years
ago in Belgium is now living in the same city as he.  He writes her
a letter and she, Claire (Julia Blake), agrees to meet him although 
she is living with her husband of many decades, John (Terry Norris). 
When they meet, do they go for tea and quietly chat about the
good old days?  They do that, but more important they realize
that the spark has not died and that during the November of their
lives they embark on an affair as though they were still twenty
years old in postwar Antwerp.  Deciding she is too old to lie, she
tells all to her husband, accusing him of paying little attention to
her and for (get this) not making love even once in the last twenty
years.  (Sounds like the fantasy that sons and daughters have of
their aging parents.)</P>
<P>   "Innocence" deals with the reaction that the people have to the 
relationship of these two, well, sexagenarians.  How does John
react?  What does Andreas's long-term housekeeper do when
she runs into her employer just as he and his woman friend come
down their stairs in their robes?  "Innocence" is that rare movie
that is about something different, something scarcely tackled
in the same way by the film industry, mostly ignored by
Hollywood whose idea of romantic sixty-ish people stretches all
the way from Robert Redford to Warren Beatty.  Most of us will
probably empathize with Claire, a woman whose marriage has
dried up and who realizes that love becomes that much deeper
when there are not many years left.  I'm not so sure I'd go along
with her view about being "too old to lie."  What's that supposed
to mean?  I'm thinking of the meanspirited lovers in Jean-Charles
Tacchella's 1975 movie "Cousin, Cousine," in which the
characters played by Marie-Christine Barrault and Victor Lanoux,
married to others, decide to go beyond the kissing stage but do
so right in the home of the husband.  </P>
<P>   The way Paul Cox stimulates our thinking about this and other
matters is part of what makes this a resourceful film, one which
racked up prizes at film festivals all over the place--Taormina,
Toronto, Vlissengen, Montreal, Saint-Tropez among other
locations.  I don't think I'd go as far as my online colleague in
Australia, Andrew Howe, who in reviewing the movie on
December 13, 2000 called it "without reservation...a wonderful
film...leavened with warmth, compassion..." even quipping that
this film will change your life.  But it deserves an A for sincerity,
for a refusal to sell out to Hollywood's affinity for young, bosomy
and large-lipped women.  Its performances are all as authentic
as any director would want them to be.  Tony Clark does a fine
job behind the lens capturing flashbacks to the salad days of
the principals, proving what Tim Burton ("Planet of the Apes") 
knew all along.  Time travel is possible: you can be twenty once again.</P>
