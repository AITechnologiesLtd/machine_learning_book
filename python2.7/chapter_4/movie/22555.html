<PRE>Step right up, folks.</PRE>
<P>Paul Thomas Anderson, hyphenate creator of Boogie Nights and the even
better Hard Eight, understands that chance encounters in movies, even
docudramas, never fly, so he braces you for the San Fernando Valley-set
Magnolia, his three hour ode to coincidence, with a dazzling prologue
that underlines the film's basic theme: "strange things happen." In
quick succession, Anderson, who goes by P.T. (evoking the name of a
certain ringleader), stages a 1911 murder, the death of a scuba-diving
casino dealer, and the homicide of a man in mid-suicide. The karmic
overtones of these three random acts of violence are absurd-we'd only
believe them in life if they were related to us in that reliable
fashion, "This friend of mine knows a guy who..."</P>
<P>A blaring TV announces the arrival of the story proper-all of Magnolia's
characters are at least peripherally connected with the television
trade. Game show producer Earl Patridge (Robards) is afflicted with
terminal cancer, as is Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall), the emcee of
his most popular program, "What Do Kids Know?". Earl's estranged son is
Frank T.J. Mackey (Cruise), a wildly successful host of seminars
("Seduce and Destroy") for sexually frustrated men. Jimmy's estranged
daughter is Claudia (Melora Walters), a sometime prostitute with a
fearsome coke habit.</P>
<P>Christian cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) will eventually meet and
court Claudia. The police officer, like Donnie Smith (William H. Macy),
a former quiz show contestant, is at first an object of ridicule, an
earnest stumblebum given to bouts of transparent bravado. The two men
generate pathos when the truth of their shared loneliness comes to the
fore. ("I have so much love to give," Donnie wails. "I just don't know
where to put it.") Adolescent Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) is the
image of Donnie at the height of his fame-the child is a reigning "What
Do Kids Know?" champion and, mainly due to pressure from his greedy,
boorish father (Michael Bowen), on the brink of a breakdown.</P>
<P>Finally, there are Earl's caretakers: Linda (Moore), his hysterical
trophy wife, and Phil Parma (Hoffman), a devoted nurse-he, too, is
single, sparing no love for anyone but Earl. The old man's last request
is a reunion with his only child, so Phil dutifully hangs on the phone
forever with Frank's handlers. Wryly echoing what was suggested by the
elaborate introduction, Phil tells an operator, "You know the scene [in
the movie] in which the dying man tries to get in touch with his
long-lost son?...There's a reason they have those scenes-because they
actually happen." (Regrettably, the film's prevalent black character, a
rappin' klepto, falls victim to stereotype.)</P>
<P>One gathers from watching the glorious pop mess that is Magnolia that
Anderson has cobbled together every stray idea that ever landed in his
imagination. The film includes a gut-wrenching corker of a musical
number in which the characters sing along, in divergent locales, to a
lyric from Aimee Mann's pseudo-inspirational "Wise Up". (Nine of Mann's
tunes adroitly grace the soundtrack.) While the film's aggressively
unpredictable bent makes room for such playfulness, it also paves the
way for an irksome climax-an unforeseen event, guaranteed to blindside
cold audiences, lets the air out of the tire, so to speak. Artistically
liberating in that it lets Anderson off the hook at an especially tense
juncture, this final freak occurrence doesn't go far enough in mirroring
the mysteries outlined in Magnolia's preface-it lacks a sense of
destiny, of psychic neatness.</P>
<P>At least the conclusion is beautiful to behold-cinematographer Robert
Elswit at peak performance. His camera is more patient, but no less
animate, here than elsewhere in the picture. Anderson has encouraged
Elswit and editor Dylan Tichenor to pace Magnolia, for the first
two-thirds, like a coke binge. This risky, channel-surfing approach
keeps us sharp and is utterly appropriate, considering the content-the
extended family members on display are children of the boob tube and
have built boxes around themselves. I gather that, because he has called
Magnolia his most personal effort in interviews, Anderson's scope of
experience does not range beyond dealings with entertainment industry
types, for Earl's turf is only two steps away from that of Boogie
Nights' porn czar Floyd Gondolli. Fortunately, the emotions on parade in
Magnolia are universal.</P>
<P>As you may have surmised, I'm a big fan of both Hard Eight and Boogie
Nights (which earned fourth place on my Top 10 of 1997); Anderson is one
of the only hip directors to emerge from the nineties with a discernible
style. Beyond the most obvious motifs-the whip pans (borrowed from
Scorsese but used to signature effect), the cutesy title cards, the
persistent music, and the penis fixation (there lurks a Dirk
Diggler-sized dragon in the briefs of Frank Mackey, too)-a hopefulness
pervades his work. The initially miserable Magnolia is Anderson's most
optimistic vision yet, made sonorous by the best ensemble of the year.
(It would be fruitless to pick standouts, for each actor leaves a
ghost.) The film's absolute message is sentimental and appealing: fate
doesn't have to win.</P>
<P>Magnolia is a deeply felt kitchen sink movie reminiscent, in a good way,
of Robert Altman's sprawling ensemble pieces (the cameo appearance of
Henry Gibson-as an old queen named Thurston Howell (!)-is an oblique
reference to Nashville). According to its defamers, Anderson has
committed the high crime of self-indulgence, a stigmatic observation
I've regrettably made in past reviews-it unfairly insinuates that
ambition is offensive. One should exit this film with, above all else,
respect for the modern Barnum's talent, chutzpah, and sincerity, and
wonder what he'll do for an encore.</P>
