<PRE>A Simple Plan
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) This film provoked a strong emotional response in me. The
doomed scheme, the naïve players, and the sad, twisted music filled me
with dread and made me squirm in my seat.</P>
<P>A Simple Plan is a neo-noir, a crime film whose downward spiral is a
black hole from which there is no escape. Scripted by Scott Smith, it
was based on his novel. It starts with a forlorn Bill Paxton explaining
in voiceover, "I was a happy man." Past tense. </P>
<P>Hank (Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton, who is superb in
the role), and their friend Louis (Brent Briscoe) are in their truck on
a secluded road. It is the middle of winter and snow covering the fields
and the roads blends with the nondescript white sky. A fox crosses their
path and Louis and Jacob insist on stopping to track it down.</P>
<P>The three come across an old plane crash. The plane is covered in snow
and the pilot is long dead. Further exploration reveals a duffel bag
full of money, piles of stacks of hundred dollar bills. A quick debate
reveals only two options: report the money to the authorities, or split
the money three ways. </P>
<P>Jacob and Louis, being a little dimmer than Hank, want to split the
money three ways and become instant millionaires. Hank sees that their
plan won't work if someone finds the plane and knows the money is
missing. He agrees to split the money, but only if they agree that
nobody collects a share until AFTER the plane is found. If the money is
missed, they can always turn it in or burn it. If nobody mentions the
money in connection with the plane, they will keep it.</P>
<P>Hank takes the money to his place for safe keeping and almost instantly,
the paranoia creeps into their lives. What about the footprints in the
fresh snow? Can Hank be trusted? Can they keep their stories straight?
The paranoia leads to mistakes, as it always does in this type of film.
The mistakes lead to attempted corrections, which in turn lead to more
mistakes. The downward spiral is as fascinating as it is foreboding.</P>
<P>Several factors add to the doomed, queasy feeling of this film. Danny
Elfman's amazing score should have been nominated for an Oscar. The
orchestra plays a sad, folksy tune, but the strings are about a
quarter-step out of tune, adding a gut-wrenching twang to the
soundtrack. The bleak, lifeless, wintery setting and cinematography are
reminiscent of FARGO. The omnipresence of crows presage death and
disease.</P>
<P>In addition, the characters are well-formed. Jacob and Louis are best
friends from high school. They haven't done much with their lives since
then. They are not too bright, a bit too greedy, and far too mistrustful
of each other to be likely to pull off their heist. Hank is a little
smarter, but he hasn't escaped the small, poor farming community he was
born in. All in all, they are a sad bunch, and perfect for this film.</P>
<P>With so many things done so well, you'd think this would be an excellent
film. But like PLEASANTVILLE, it crumbles under the pressure of critical
thought.</P>
<P>For one thing, Hank (the college graduate) and Jacob (his slow-witted
brother) are too completely different to be brothers. The gap in
intelligence between them cannot be explained by college attendance, as
the film suggests. The plot required most of the characters to be dumb,
but a smarter character was needed for contrast and leadership, and so
the college educated brother was introduced.</P>
<P>For another, the practical problems of spending hundred-dollar bills in
a small town was never brought up, even though other problems were
mentioned and dealt with. Perhaps the point was that none of them were
smart enough to think of it. Still, the movie should have addressed it.
I don't think it's too much to ask of screenwriter Smith to be one step
ahead of the audience. I was disappointed to have thought of something
that the characters and the film hadn't.</P>
<P>And finally, the film's great tragic ending -- the fate of the brothers
-- was not justified. After dozens of other problems were resolved with
great desperation and tenacity, the film's final solution should have
been even more desperate and tenacious. Barring that, it should have
been a great sigh of resignation. It was tragic and moving, but it was
also easy and premature.  </P>
<P>A Simple Plan is on many "ten best" lists, and I'm glad for it. I really
enjoyed the film, particularly the way it moved me and made me squirm.
But there were too many problems for it to be a really great film.</P>
