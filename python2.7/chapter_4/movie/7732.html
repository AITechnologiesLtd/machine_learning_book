                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1995, PG-13, 90 minutes [1 hour, 30 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Adam Sandler (Billy Madison), Bridgette Wilson (Miss Veronica
Vaughn), Bradley Whitford (Eric), Darren McGavin (Mr. Madison), written by
Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler, produced by Robert Simonds, directed by Tamra
Davis.</P>
<P>Sometimes things come along that are so insanely stupid they border on sheer
genius. "Billy Madison" is an example of this. It is both a cliche and
original comedy, full of wacky jokes and total idiocy, but for some reason it
works well. So well in fact, we actual laugh along with the film rather than
at it, and that's what makes for good comedy.</P>
<P>Adam Sandler stars as idiot manchild Billy Madison, the son of a billionaire
who owns a chain of hotels. All he does is hang around his mansion, drinking
and going nuts with his two other idiot friends. Billy acts like he's seven
years old and it's hilarious to watch him be so stupid. For example, he gets
so excited when he realizes it's "nudie magazine day" and Sandler's baby talk
is hilarious. </P>
<P>But the attitude doesn't stop there. Even his magazines are wacky: "She-Male
Fiesta," "Women Over 80," and "Drunk Chicks." Another funny scene involves
Billy and the boys playing practical jokes on people, and their victims are
even bigger idiots than they are. No, this is not the most believable story
in the world, but it certainly is fun to watch. </P>
<P>Then the movie has to go normal by bringing in a plot. Mr. Madison (McGavin)
knows Billy is a blithering idiot and he always wanted to hand the Madison
Hotel Company over to him when he retires, but how can he give it to such a
moron? When he tells Billy this, they make a deal: if he can pass grades 1 -
12 all over again in 24 weeks, he'll be qualified to take over the company,
otherwise Eric (Whitford), Madison's snotty second in command, will get it.
Eric is the standard comedy villain, his arrogance and vileness are obviously
exaggerated, but so is everything else, so nothing seems too zany here.</P>
<P>And so Billy ventures off to school and the real hilarity ensues. The style
isn't so much "fish-out-of-water" as it is just watching an idiot be an
idiot. Even the teachers are portrayed as very kooky. All of this absurdity
adds up and is funny and likable even though it shouldn't be.</P>
<P>Of course there has to be the
sexy-woman-who-won't-give-the-main-character-the-time-of-day, and that
character is Billy's third grade teacher Miss Veronica Vaughn (Wilson). Is it
necessary to mention what will happen between her and Billy? Another generic
comedy element unfolds when Eric somehow gets to the hero by blackmailing his
principal.</P>
<P>To settle everything once and for all, Billy challenges Eric to an "Academic
Decathlon" in which they will battle for the company - guess who wins?</P>
<P>"Billy Madison" is thin on plot, but big on laughter. It's pathetic humor in
a way, but it's funny, and I can respect that.</P>
