<P>THE ENDURANCE:  SHACKLETON'S LEGENDARY ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION<HR></P>
<P>In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton, having lost his bid to be the first explorer
to reach the South Pole, set sail with a crew of 28 men to be the first to
cross the Antarctic continent.  His three-masted sailing vessel, built to
withstand ice, was named after his family motto, 'By endurance we conquer.'
In 1999, producer/director George Butler mounted an expedition to retrace 
Shackleton's two year struggle of extraordinary courageousness in "The 
Endurance:  Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition."</P>
<P>Among Shackleton's many wise decisions was to bring along Australian
photographer Frank Hurley, who documented their journey in both still
photographs and moving film, which he editted into the 1919 documentary
"South."  While Hurley's original film features amazing footage and striking
imagery, it suffers from injudicious editing and pacing, with almost a 
half hour of the film's end turned over to nature photography to fill in
the gap Hurley experienced when Shackleton journeyed on, leaving Hurley
and twenty-one others behind awaiting rescue.</P>
<P>What Butler has done is to recreate the entire amazing story, beginning with
descendents of Shackleton's crew recalling the tales they were told (or
not as the case may be) and filling out personalities of the men who responded
to Shackleton's newspaper ad (which began 'Men wanted for hazardous journey,
small wages, bitter cold...').  Butler has actors provide the voices of the
crew as excerpts from their diaries are read, revealing the incredible
leadership Shackleton provided under threat of mutiny and overwhelming odds.
While he uses Hurley's footage and photos, Butler's documentary is a far 
richer, more emotional work.  New footage and unobtrusive recreations 
continue Shackleton's determination to save his men after ten months trapped
in the ice pack which crushed their ship.</P>
<P>After getting his men to Elephant Island in three lifeboats, Shackleton and
five others travelled 800 miles through wild seas to South Georgia, a whaling
station and their last point of departure.  This journey alone is often called
the most daring ocean voyage in modern maritime history.  Starved, frostbitten
and exhausted, Shackleton still faced a 36 hour trek, including scaling a 
glacier, when they made land on the opposite side of their destination.  It
took him four voyages before he finally arrived back at Elephant Island and
succeeded in bringing his entire crew back to civilization alive.  Ironically,
they returned to a world at war which paid scant attention to their return.
Shackleton himself began another Antarctic expedition some years later with
many of his former crew, but died of a heart attack at the age of 48 upon
their arrival at South Georgia's whaling station.</P>
<P>Butler's first rate documentary is only hurt by Liam Neeson's narration.
His soft, lilting voice often lacks the drama the events he's recounting
demand.  Music by Michael Small ranges from a deep, foreboding orchestral
piece which recalls whale sounds to Irish jigs and Tibetan vocals.
Transitions from old footage to new are seamless.</P>
<P>"The Endurance:  Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition" is an
awe-inspiring, uplifting tale of human fortitude and one man's incredible
capacity to lead men through unthinkable obstacles.</P>
