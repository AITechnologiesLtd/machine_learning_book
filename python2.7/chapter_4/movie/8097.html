<PRE>                            OUT AT SEA</PRE>
<P>How could a movie starring two great actors turn out so pitiful I
had to force myself to sit through the screening? When I think of
the innumerable films that Walter Matthau has made and those of
Jack Lemmon, it really hurts to report that this was a fiasco: two
old men, and they do look old, acting so out of character and
looking lost and ridiculous as they meander and stumble through it all.</P>
<P>It is not that the story is bad; it's that Casting and the
Director should never have chosen the two fine actors for these
roles.   Charlie (Matthau) plays the horses and always loses.  In
deep debt to his bookie, he dreams up a scheme whereby he and his
brother-in-law Herb (Lemmon) will get a job on a cruise ship as
dancers (read "gigolos") where they will charm the single ladies
who want male companionship on the cruise.  They will then fleece
the women and Charlie will be able to pay off his bookies.</P>
<P>Two big obstacles are that both look very aged.  What woman in her
right (or any mind) would look upon them as potential catches?
Why would a very good-looking, young-looking Liz (Dyan Cannon)
give even a passing glance at Charlie.  Why would the lovely Vivian
(Gloria De Haven) think she would like to marry the decrepit Herb?
Give me a break!   Add to that, that although Charlie and Herb are
hired as dance companions for the women, Charlie cannot even
dance.</P>
<P>What we have is a fine cast that is utterly drowned at sea.  There
is Hal Linden and there is Donald O'Connor in little more than
cameos.  While Linden looks as handsome as ever there is one scene
where O'Connor's paunch makes him look about 6 months pregnant.
Why would he have allowed himself to be so badly served when he
should want to be remembered as the suave, handsome, great dancer
he was?</P>
<P>Among the others drowning in  OUT TO SEA are Elaine Strich, Rue
McClanahan and Brent Spiner.   Sad.</P>
<P>Directed by Martha Coolidge who has made some pretty good films in
the past:  Lost in Yonkers, Angie, Rambling Rose, etc .  This one
she had better forget.</P>
