<PRE>Young Frankenstein </PRE>
<PRE>        ****</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Casino.</PRE>
<PRE>My ratings scale</PRE>
<PRE>**** - Excellent
*** - Pretty good
** - Fair, don't go out of your way, though.
* - Don't say I didn't warn you.</PRE>
<P>Cast: Gene Wilder (Dr. Fredrick Frankenstein), Peter Boyle (The
Monster), Marty Feldman (Igor), Madeline Kahn (Elizabeth),
Teri Garr (Inga), Cloris Leachman (Frau Blucher),
Kenneth Mars (Inspector Kemp), Gene Hackman (Blind man).</P>
<P>Written by Gene Wilder & Mel Brooks, Directed by Mel Brooks,
produced by Michael Gruskoff, Cinematography by
Gerald Hirschfield, Music by John Morris.</P>
<P>This film, penned by Wilder and Brooks based upon a concept
Wilder came up with, was nominated for a Best Screenplay
Oscar in 1974. What puzzles me is what could've possibly
won over it, because it's easily one of the funniest
movies ever made, and it's also genuinely good because
it could just as easily have been released as a straight
horror film.</P>
<P>This loving parody of the old Universal Frankenstein pictures,
using beautiful black and white photography and a chilling
Universal-style music score by John Morris (Brooks' usual
music man) stars Gene Wilder as Dr. Fredrick Frankenstein (sorry,
Fronk-on-steen, as he prefers it in the film, and says
repeatedly), who inherits his grandfather, Victor's castle,
which he is ashamed of, as well as his assistants
Igor the usual hunchback (a hilarious Feldman), and
busty Inga (Garr). He decides to create his own
Monster (Boyle) in an attempt to clear the family name,
but as usual, the hunchback steals the wrong brain
from the laboratory, and the Monster goes on a menacing
spree throughout the countryside, much to the charign
of the villagers and the one armed, peculiar voiced
Inspector Kemp (Mars, in a funny takeoff on Lionel Atwill
from SON OF FRANKENSTEIN).</P>
<P>This film is an excellent example of the fact that Mel Brooks
and Gene Wilder can make a really good parody that is faithful
to the genre if they like it well enough, which they obviously
did in this case. Mel Brooks directs with the style
of James Whale, and as I say, he could've just as easily
edited out the jokes, despite his usual sexual puns,
which, thankfully, are toned down here--and I'm sure
Wilder is to thank for that--, and it really is
in the style of the old movies.</P>
<P>Not only that, but we also have the excellent performances
from each and every one of the cast members (and thankfully,
Brooks does not appear like he usually does). Particularly
good are Wilder's mad doctor, Boyle's Monster, and Feldman's
riotous hunchback. I'm not forgetting about Kahn as
Elizabeth or Leachman as Frau Blucher (EEEHHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEHEE! 
Sorry, couldn't resist), though.</P>
<PRE>Particular highlights:</PRE>
<P>1. Tie: Puttin' on the Ritz routine/blind man part
2. Feldman and Wilder's banter.
3. Scene where Wilder attempts to reach out to the
Monster.
4. The fact that the Monster isn't as dumb as he looks (see
the movie, you'll know what I mean).</P>
<P>This was ripped off fourteen years later by a low budget
film called FRANKENSTEIN GENERAL HOSPITAL.
I haven't seen this film, but I'm told it
is the worst Frankenstein film ever made, and if it rips
off this film as much as I've heard, I can see
why. Except no cheap imitations, people. It's
foolish to try to think you're going to make
a good movie just by going and ripping this
movie off. This is too good. You try that,
you'll fail. I garauntee you that.</P>
