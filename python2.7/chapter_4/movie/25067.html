<PRE>FANTASIA/2000 (1999) / *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by James Algar, Gaetan Brizzi, Paul Brizzi, Hendel Butoy,
Francis Glebas, Eric Goldberg, Don Hahn and Pixote Hunt. Screenplay by
Hahn, Irene Mecchi and David Reynolds, with the segment "The Steadfast Tin
Soldier" inspired by the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Running time:
74 minutes. Rated G by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 23rd, 2000.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>The original "Fantasia" was Walt Disney's great experiment. Having 
demonstrated that a feature-length animated film could be a commercial 
(and critical) success with "Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs", Disney's 
next project was a movie introducing children to classical music by 
marrying it to animation in a series of vignettes. Sadly, the idea proved
unpopular in 1940, and so Disney's even grander plans -- creating a new 
version every so often by replacing some of the older segments -- had to 
be shelved.</P>
<P>Until now. At Christmastime, Walt Disney Pictures released 
"Fantasia/2000" to IMAX theatres. Unfortunately, Newfoundland does not 
have an IMAX venue, but now the film has been released in 35mm for a 
four-week engagement. Despite the smaller stature, even this version of 
the movie is so visually splendid, and the music so compelling, that it 
is an experience no one should miss.</P>
<P>"Fantasia/2000" follows essentially the same format as its predecessor. 
The only major change is the use of a different contemporary star to 
introduce each piece. These cameos, directed by Don Hahn, are mostly 
filler, and I fear will date "Fantasia/2000" rather quickly. But some 
sequences -- particularly those featuring Steve Martin and James Earl 
Jones -- are amusing, and they are brief enough that they do not distract 
too much from the proceedings.</P>
<P>The introductory piece is Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5, Allegro con Brio", 
directed by Pixote Hunt, and the animation is an abstract work featuring 
butterfly-like triangles. There are some glorious moments here, 
particularly the sight of thousands of the triangles in flight, and the 
play of color throughout the sequence is dazzling.</P>
<P>Next up is what may be the best part of the movie, set to Respighi's 
"Pines Of Rome" and directed by Hendel Butoy. Butoy has opted to toy with 
our preconceptions and, instead of drawing inspiration from the 
composition's title, presents a visually enthralling depiction of a family 
of whales cavorting in the sea, a series of ice caverns, and finally 
above the clouds themselves. Scenes like one where the whales dive 
through a thundercloud are truly breathtaking, and I felt my heart 
soaring alongside the creatures.</P>
<P>Up third is another superb segment, directed by Eric Goldberg. The music 
is Gershwin's "Rhapsody In Blue", providing a more modern addition to the 
line-up. I'm glad the producers recognised the fact that "Fantasia/2000" 
is meant to be an evolving, experimental format, and did not feel 
confined to using only prototypically classical works. The style of 
animation here also stands out, inspired by the illustrations of Al 
Hirschfeld. Even the color scheme is different from conventional Disney 
fare, keying each character to a specific hue. The stories of four 
Depression-Era New Yorkers -- a budding musician, a young girl, a 
sheepish husband, and a guy looking for a job -- are interlaced, to 
humorous effect. Especially funny is the husband's impromptu jig with an 
organ grinder's monkey.</P>
<P>Butoy returns to helm the next portion of the film, setting Hans 
Christian Andersen's "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" to Shostakovich's "Piano 
Concerto No. 2". It tells the story of a one-legged miniature soldier who 
falls in love with a toy ballerina and defends her from a lecherous 
Jack-in-the-Box. This is a beautiful rendition of the tale, warmly 
animated as though lifted out of an old storybook. Particularly effective 
is the portrayal of the Jack-in-the-Box, brimming with malice.</P>
<P>A short piece follows, accompanying Saint-Saens' "Carnival Of The 
Animals". James Earl Jones deadpans the introduction perfectly, promising 
the segment will answer that eternal question, "What happens you give a 
yo-yo to a flock of flamingos? Who wrote this?" Hilarious hijinks ensue, 
animated in a suitably simple style.</P>
<P>Next is the lone resurrectee from the original "Fantasia", "The 
Sorcerer's Apprentice", directed by James Algar. This was always my 
favourite portion of the 1940 version ("Night On Bald Mountain" running a 
close second), and it was wonderful to see it on the big screen. The 
grainy sixty-year-old animation does suffer somewhat in comparison with
the rest of "Fantasia/2000", and the fact that it is in the original 
(non-widescreen) aspect ratio gives it an archaic look. But the sheer 
jollity and imagination of the story still win me over, and Dukas' 
"L'apprenti sorcier" is a gorgeous composition.</P>
<P>We move from one Disney character to another as Donald and Daisy Duck 
take center stage in a story set aboard Noah's Ark during the Great 
Flood. As with "Pines Of Rome", this is an unusual accompaniment for the 
music, Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance". But it works, because director 
Francis Glebas concocts a story both amusing and heartfelt. Unfortunately, 
the opportunity for some really fantastic animation inspired by the flood 
and the many animals is passed up, leaving us with a standard Disney short.</P>
<P>The final sequence, directed by Gaetan and Paul Brizzi, similarly 
disappoints by not taking full advantage of the medium. Set to 
Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite", it depicts the story of a nature sprite who 
awakens a fearsome volcano spirit while bringing spring to the land. 
Although a nice fable, it plays out too straightforwardly, and altogether 
fails to convey the natural beauty and primal majesty that the Brizzis 
seem to be aiming for.</P>
<P>Otherwise, my only real complaint about "Fantasia/2000" is that it is 
weighted too heavily toward narrative-style segments, eschewing the more 
conceptual pieces which animation often portrays so well. The commercial 
motivations behind this decision are obvious, but "Fantasia" should be 
all about challenging the viewer -- not just through its presentation of 
classical music and unusual animation styles, but also by introducing new 
ideas. Further, I question the choice to run the two pieces starring 
popular Disney characters back-to-back, as it somewhat unbalances the movie.</P>
<P>These minor gripes aside, though, "Fantasia/2000" is a worthy successor 
to the original, and a fantastic, visually- and aurally-spellbinding movie 
for all ages. Parents who don't take advantage of this all-too-brief 
opportunity and take their kids to see it in the theatre are cheating 
their children. And themselves, too.</P>
