                                 SAVAGE NIGHTS 
                       A Film Review by Michael J. Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael J. Legeros</PRE>
<P>     Art *is* life in SAVAGE NIGHTS, the compelling but overlong story of 
a dying man who learns to love. The final feature from French filmmaker 
Cyril Collard, who died of an AIDS-related illness a year ago March, 
swept the Cesars (winning Best Movie, Best Debut Film, Best Editing, and 
Best New Actress) three days after its maker met its maker.</P>
<P>     Adapted from Collard's autobiographical novel (and starring 
himself!), SAVAGE NIGHTS opens in 1986, the year the young filmmaker 
learned of his infection after returning to Paris from a shoot in 
Morocco. The news doesn't exactly deter his daring and Collard, who is 
bisexual, continues on an exceedingly reckless lifestyle that, 
eventually, transforms both himself and his lovers, Samy (Carlos Lopez) 
and Laura (Romane Bohringer).</P>
<P>     SAVAGE NIGHTS takes a bit too long to get where it's going, but the 
direction is great and, as an AIDS-related drama, the film runs rings 
around anything Hollywood has the courage to create.  Watch Romane 
Bohringer refuse a condomn from her HIV-positive lover and you'll never 
view screen-sex the same.</P>
