<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An entertaining mystery filmed from the back lot of MGM, though it convincingly
looks like foggy London. A couple of cockney lovebirds, barmaid Bessie (Field)
and store clerk Bill (Quillan), are sitting on a park bench in Sundial Square
when they observe a man with an umbrella go into the shop where Bill works. The
man with the umbrella then hastily leaves the shop after a shot is fired, but
the owner of the shop who was just whistling can't be located. It's as if his
body disappeared. The only thing that is found inside is a note in red chalk
saying: Pay or be seen no more! First on the scene is newspaper reporter Michael
Denis (Murphy) and his Irish Terrier called Jones. He calls Scotland Yard
Inspector Jefferson (Zucco). </P>
<P>A half-hour later, a policeman is shot by the same man with the umbrella. The
inspector labels the killer as the Umbrella Man and Denis, who is supposed to go
to Paris on a vacation, finds the case too intriguing to leave. </P>
<P>Everyone looks suspicious in the foggy night so when Denis sees a man with an
umbrella sneaking into the window of a house on the square, he tackles him. It
turns out he's the butler, Squires, to Sir Arthur Herrick (Love). Herrick's
attractive daughter Patricia (Rita) finds this escapade amusing, and a romance
blossoms between Denis and her. While her father seems upset with the intrusion
and his sickly secretary, Correy (Carroll), seems ashen. </P>
<P>Meanwhile two more people involved with the Umbrella Man disappear. The usually
gentle Jones when he meets them, barked loudly at the presence of these two
mystery men. As the mystery is built around the fact these victims didn't exist,
but that it was the killer disguised as them so he could execute his diabolical
scheme. </P>
<P>The climax comes when Sir Arthur receives the same note in red chalk the other
victims received and must give money to the note sender or else die like the
other victims. Denis works out a way to trap the Umbrella Man with the
assistance of Scotland Yard. </P>
<P>It was strictly lightweight fare, done in a breezy style, but it proved to be an
enjoyable B-film. George Murphy was later on to become the Republican senator
from California. </P>
