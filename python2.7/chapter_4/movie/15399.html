<P>Plot: In 1957 the USA was devastated by a Russian nuclear strike. In 
Lost Vegas, Elvis was proclaimed the king. But now with the death of 
Elvis, the guitar and samurai-sword wielding Buddy seeks to become the 
new king. Reluctantly allowing himself to be accompanied by an orphan 
child that he saves, Buddy makes his way across the post-apocalyptic 
Nevada Desert, fighting off crazies, while pursued by Death who wants to 
usurp rock'n'roll with heavy metal.</P>
<P>It is not long into 'Six-String Samurai' when you wonder what on Earth 
it is you have sat down to watch. The opening moments feature a samurai 
sword-waving Buddy Holly lookalike (in the midst of what the opening 
credits tell us is a post-holocaust alternate world) despatching 
Neanderthal mutants and trio of bowlers who hide blades inside their 
bowling pins, while a group of mariachi Elvis-impersonators play on from 
the sideline. Subsequent encounters include brushes with a strange 
cannibal family and a Spinach Monster which, in what appears to be an 
attempt to parody bad sf movies, is represented by an eye on a 
corrugated pipe, with the rock'n'roll samurai hero all the while being 
pursued by a heavy metal-playing Death.</P>
<P>It rapidly becomes apparent that 'Six-String Samurai' is an offbeat 
indie experiment in cinematic textural meldings. It reads as a 
conflation of rock'n'roll mythology crossbred with Japanese samurai 
films, a parody of the whole 'Mad Max' post-holocaust genre and an 
attempt to be a bad sf movie. And it all gets pretty silly - the scenes 
with the moronic mutants conducting a 'Mad Max' style chase at about 
five miles per hour is quite inane.</P>
<P>But oddly enough all the silliness eventually develops a certain panache 
of sorts. Director Mungia manages all the action poses with a reasonable 
degree of style - the film and its low-budget chutzpah ends up reminding 
one to a lesser extent of Robert Rodriguez and what he set out to do in 
his 1993 debut 'El Mariachi'. Mungia's stroke of luck is his lead actor 
(also his co-writer and production designer) Jeffrey Falcon. Besides 
bearing an uncanny resemblance to Buddy Holly, Falcon pulls off the 
potentially absurd image of a bespectacled, bedraggled sword-wielding 
Buddy Holly with thorough conviction. Falcon also delivers the cod 
rock'n'roll dialogue with a wonderfully thin-lipped mealy pout and 
proves surprisingly lithe when it comes to all the fight poses. 
Ultimately the film proves an oddity that leaves one scratching their 
head in puzzlement, but not an unenjoyable one.</P>
