<P>     THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES is a mess.  Babs' new movie is a tedious
exploration of a woman's appearance and her self-opinion therein,
disguised as an old-fashioned romantic comedy about two college
professors (Babs and Jeff Bridges) who enter into a chaste marriage
because "sex ruins everything," set in an indulgent fantasy world
populated by beautiful people like Elle Macpherson (as Bridges' ex-
girlfriend!) and Pierce Brosnan (as Babs' old beau!), and shot through
an endless series of hazy filters, or, perhaps, a year's worth of old
pantyhose.  The laughs are there, sometimes intended and sometimes not.
I howled as an over-pronounced saxophone (on the soundtrack) circled the
two during an intimate moment.  And how about that busy Marvin Hamlisch
score, that you half-expect Babs to break into song with?</P>
<P>     Mr. Bridges is great fun to watch as the button-downed, bow-tied
intellectual whose idea of a good time is bringing a spectral analyzer
to a Christmas concert.  (How much are those, anyway?) His character is
perfectly serious (and perfectly believable) when he says "I'm sure if
sex is something that interests you, I would provide that on occasion."
Also very funny are Lauren Bacall and Mimi Rogers, as Barbra's mother
and sister, respectively.  (George Segal and Brenda Vaccaro, in
supporting roles, are largely wasted.) As for Babs herself, well, it's
quite a stretch to believe her as an ugly duckling spinster.  Especially
given the care that she's taken to look good in every.  single.  frame.
Maybe if she had a fat suit, a la Eddie Murphy in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR?</P>
