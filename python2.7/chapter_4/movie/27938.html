<PRE>THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In an acting tour de force in THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE, Samuel L. Jackson 
plays Romulus Ledbetter, a paranoid schizophrenic with dirty dreadlocks 
and standard homeless attire.  Romulus, however, is careful to correct 
people.  He isn't a homeless person but a cave dweller.  In his cave in 
a public park, he watches TV without having to plug in any wires.  
Wherever he walks, there are evil signals coming his way from the top of 
the nefarious, art deco Chrysler Building in New York.  The 
yellow-colored Y rays are tolerable, but the new green-colored Z rays 
are pretty sinister.</P>
<P>So what is the story about?  It's a murder mystery with Romulus as a 
blend of the lead characters of SHINE, "Columbo," and THE FISHER KING.  
A Julliard-trained, classical pianist, Romulus is a highly intelligent 
and gifted man who has lost his sanity but not his mind.  Jackson avoids 
all of the pitfalls of such a role, delivering a performance that makes 
Romulus a complex character who deserves our sympathy and our 
understanding.</P>
<P>Being, well, nuts, no one will pay attention to Romulus when he claims 
that the guy found frozen in a tree near his cave was murdered.  He 
suspects controversial artist David Leppenraub (Colm Feore) since the 
murdered young man was one of Leppenraub's models.  Leppenraub is fond 
of making inflammatory remarks about his art.  ("All great art is born 
of suffering." and "If the price of rapture is a mountain of suffering, 
shouldn't the fee be paid?")</P>
<P>Director Kasi Lemmons, whose only other film was the acclaimed EVE'S 
BAYOU, has an acute sense of the visual.  Romulus's many surrealist 
dream sequences are particularly compelling, giving us an enhanced 
awareness of his pain.</P>
<P>My favorite subtheme in the story involves a bankruptcy lawyer named 
Bob, played with a boyish innocence by Anthony Michael Hall, who 
provides Romulus with a suit and a shower.  Bob's apartment is furnished 
completely in 1930s decor since that was the "golden era" for his 
profession.</P>
<P>THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE doesn't quite fit into any category.  It's a 
fairly thin mystery but a heck of a character study.  Whatever it is, it 
keeps your eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end.  Without 
Jackson to play the central role, the production would have been 
hopeless.  But he did agree to play it and made it, thereby, a handsome 
addition to the Jackson collection.</P>
<P>THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE runs 1:43.  It is rated R for language, some 
violence and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
