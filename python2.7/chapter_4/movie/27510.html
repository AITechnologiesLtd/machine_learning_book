The Gift </PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>This ESP thriller starts off sluggishly, but opens up when Giovani 
Ribisi brings a crowbar to it at the end of the first third. Even before 
that, Ribisi's performances stand out against the bland acting and first 
act scripting of this "B" film. Greg Kinnear, though normally very good, 
is also bland. Hilary Swank gives her rather weak character some strong 
depth, but lead Cate Blanchett doesn't start to rock and roll until 
mid-film. </P>
<P>Annie Wilson (Blanchett) has "the gift" of seeing things (as in dreams) 
that will happen or have happened someplace else. But for some reason, 
she still needs cards ... and a candle seems to help too. Can she 
provide direction when one sexy citizen of this small town shows up 
missing? Her deceased (we can assume) grandmother pays her a visit to 
remind her to follow her instinct. Annie turns away, and then back (and 
then ... what the?) gram is gone. It's the first of many spooky movie 
cliches. The flooded bathtub, dripping sink faucet, wind-squelched 
candles, googly-eyed corpse, old tire dragged from the pond, fingers 
reaching ever closer to the weapon scenes all occur later as the film 
unfolds. Unfortunately, barely fifty percent of the chilling suspense is 
actually chilling. </P>
<P>But Ribisi is great. And you know what? Both lawyers are fantastic, and 
I just love the sheriff. The dialogue, especially in the "courtroom 
drama," (middle third of the film) is crisp and meaty ... some very 
sweet scenes there. </P>
<P>Too bad Annie's motivations are kind of screwy. How and when she decides 
and doesn't decide to go to the police doesn't quite compute for a woman 
who has a family to consider. But the picture climaxes well enough and 
did I mention Ribisi is fantastic? </P>
