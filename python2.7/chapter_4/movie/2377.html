<PRE>                         WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Robert Duvall, Richard Harris, Sandra Bullock, Piper
Laurie, Shirley MacLaine.
Screenplay:  Steve Conrad.
Director:  Randa Haines.</P>
<P>     Hollywood films focusing on the elderly have generally fallen into
two broad categories: comedies making them lovable codgers whose most
mundane physical activity is turned into slapstick, and melodramas
about loneliness and facing death.  We've already had one from Column A
this winter--GRUMPY OLD MEN--which makes it somewhat surprising to see
WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY so soon, even though it falls under Column
B; studios are notoriously fastidious in avoiding conflict with target
demographics.  WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY is melodramatic, and its
pacing is rather slow, but it is also filled with fine acting and
quirky but believable relationships, and ultimately proves quite
satisfying.</P>
<P>     WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY is the story of two older men who
develop an unlikely friendship.  Frank (Richard Harris) is a randy and
boisterous ex-sailor fond of telling the story of the time he wrestled
Ernest Hemingway in Puerto Rico; Walter (Robert Duvall) is a Cuban
barber, both retired and retiring.  The two seem to share little in
common except their loneliness:  Frank's son backs out on a visit for
his 75th birthday, while Walter practices dancing alone, admiring from
afar the friendly waitress (Sandra Bullock) at his favorite diner.  As
they spend time together, they gradually begin to have an effect on one
another, Walter realizing he's lived safely for too long, and Frank
realizing he still has growing up to do.</P>
<P>     The only time that HEMINGWAY really missteps is in its forced
plot.  It's obvious as soon as the two men meet that the two opposites
will attract and change each other, and that somewhere along the line
(plot point #2 for you aspiring screenwriters) they will have a falling
out.  Director Randa Haines (CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD) plays up scenes
like a shared skinny-dip and a certain male bonding ritual on the 4th
of July, which come off as more than a little silly, and the score by
Michael Convertino is enough to make one's teeth ache.  Parts of
WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY script themselves, and writer Steve Conrad
tries to get away with that laziness in his plotting.</P>
<P>     It is to his credit that when he lets his characters talk to each
other, things get much more interesting.  Harris and Duvall are
marvelous together, sharing a couple of poignant scenes where each man,
clearly thrilled simply to have someone to talk to, carries on a
practically independent conversation.  Yet this central relationship is
only one of several which truly shine.  Sandra Bullock (Stallone's
partner in DEMOLITION MAN) is thoroughly charming as Elaine, the
waitress for whom Walter carries a torch.  She demonstrates a genuine
affection for him, one which never comes off as patronizing; their
connection is sweet and very affirming.  Frank, meanwhile, spars with
his no-nonsense landlady, played perfectly by Shirley MacLaine.  Her
tough-love attempts to help Frank through his troubles and to lend a
friendly ear are spare and well-played.  However, perhaps my favorite
interaction involved Frank's attempt to romance a proper older woman
named Georgia, played by Piper Laurie.  In a small role, Laurie is
fantastic, showing Georgia's enjoyment of Frank's flirtations coupled
with her insistence on a decorum which Frank finds difficult.  From top
to bottom, the cast creates a rich and real collection of characters
whose interplay is exceptionally touching.</P>
<P>     It would be unfair to complete a review of WRESTLING ERNEST
HEMINGWAY without giving the two central performances their due.
Harris, as usual, is bigger than life, but the role of Frank calls for
such a reading, and it is testemony to his craft that Frank never seems
pathetic.  Robert Duvall, meanwhile, disappears into Walter.  A lesser
actor would have turned in a much more mannered performance, overdoing
Walter's habit of inspecting his beloved bacon sandwiches before eating
them.  Their screenwriter and director force them to jump through some
unnecessary hoops, but when they're left to do their own thing,
WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY becomes an appealing drama about the need
for contact.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bacon sandwiches:  7.</PRE>
