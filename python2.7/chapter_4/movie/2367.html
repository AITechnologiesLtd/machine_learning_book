                 - Unidentified Nazi officer to Oskar Schindler</PRE>
<P>     Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST is a three-hours-plus-change,
black-and-white biographical drama about a Nazi industrialist who saved
over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust.  And it's also grand
entertainment, albeit delivered in a very unexpected fashion.</P>
<P>     SCHINDLER'S LIST is the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam
Neeson), a shrewd Nazi businessman who smells profit in Poland.  The
year is 1939 and displaced Jews are arriving in the city of Krakow at a
rate of 10,000 per week.  Schindler sees an angle and arranges to open
a manufacturing firm with unpaid Jews as labor.  With a Jewish
accountant (Ben Kingsley) handling the "nuts and bolts," Schindler's
company soon becomes a major supplier of cookware to the German army.</P>
<P>     But as the war progresses, the Jews in Krakow are relocated to a
labor camp outside of town.  Schindler is outraged at the treatment of
his workers and bargains with the base commander (Ralph Fiennes) to
bring his Jews back to the factory--a labor "sub camp" that has become
a haven for hundreds of Jews who are all but assured that they won't
die there.</P>
<P>     Seemingly a strict mercenary at heart, Oskar Schindler nonetheless
finds himself affected by his workers.  Which compels him to undertake
a series of dangerous actions to protect his Jews....</P>
<P>     Most of SCHINDLER'S LIST is unlike anything that Steven Spielberg
(or the rest of Hollywood) has done before.  Gone are the camera
tricks.  Gone are the special effects.  Gone are the swelling strings.
In its place is a new universe: a grim, black-and-white world where the
only rule is realism.</P>
<P>     In near-documentary fashion, Spielberg catalogs horror after
horror of the Nazi war machine.  His camera never turns away from even
the most monstrous of atrocities.  But he never stares, either.</P>
<P>     The effect is remarkable, to say the least, and SCHINDLER'S LIST
delivers a punch rarely felt in mainstream movies.</P>
<P>     Forget persecution, the indiscriminate murders, alone, are
numbing.  But then come the details: a conveyor belt dumping bodies
onto an enormous pyre.  Nurses scrambling to feed patients poison
before the Nazis reach the hospital.  The reaction of a Jewish jeweler
to a satchel full of human teeth.</P>
<P>     As overpowering as it sounds, the Holocaust is just a part of the
film's matter-of-fact background.  Spielberg isn't delivering any Big
Statement here.  Instead, he treats the horror as something that,
simply, happened.  Much as when Schindler himself states that "People
die--it's a fact of life."</P>
<P>     Move into the foreground and SCHINDLER'S LIST lightens up
considerably.</P>
<P>     Despite the sobering subject matter, there's plenty to enjoy about
this story of a rogue, reluctant hero.  SCHINDLER'S LIST contains
action, drama, insight, and humor.  And all in surprisingly equal
proportions.  Call it the balancing act of the year--director
Spielberg and writer Zaillian walk a tight line between too-little and
too-much.  And sometimes they trip.</P>
<P>     The three leads are excellent.  Liam Neeson is a polished but
shadowy presence.  His character is a cipher, though, but that doesn't
detract.  Much better realized is the role of Commandant Amon Goeth,
the labor camp commander brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes.  He's a
complex study of evil that could find Fiennes friends at the Oscars.</P>
<P>     Mel Brooks notwithstanding, the screen Nazi may never be the same
again.</P>
<P>     The very important third player is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern,
Schindler's accountant and later right-hand-man.  Stern spends most of
the film as the silent partner, wary of his employer--the enemy--but
no less dedicated.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast doesn't make as strong an impression.
Schindler's wife (Caroline Goodall) registers, as do several Nazi
officers.  And many of Schindler's Jews become familiar faces by the
end of the film.  The rest are mostly extras who provide the portraits
in a haunting hall of sad faces.</P>
<P>     Technical credits are exemplary.  Allan Starski's production
design, Janusz Kaminski's cinematography, and Michael Kahn's editing
are all outstanding.  Even John Williams comes through with an atypical
score that's a knock-out.</P>
<P>     SCHINDLER'S LIST lags in a couple spots.  An abused chamber maid
delivers a monologue that restates the obvious.  Some footage appears
to be missing after the Auschwitz incident.  And Schindler's final
speech fails, in spite of the director's obvious restraint. (Neeson
just plays it wrong.)</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     SCHINDLER'S LIST is certainly the best film that
                 Steven Spielberg has made since "E.T." This searing
                 drama about a Nazi Industrialist who saves hundreds of
                 Jews is not only one of the *best* films of last year,
                 but also one of the most *entertaining*.</PRE>
