<PRE>Review by R. L. Strong
The Dungeonmaster's Cornucopia of Film</PRE>
<P>The 1950's were a period of Americana that many of us have embraced
and cherished. The innocents and sense of discovery during that era
were both frightening and comforting. Many of the films released
during that decade reflected both the political and societal changes
taking place in the U.S. But there was also escapism and fun to be
had. The many shorts featurette staring the Three Stooges (with Shemp
Howard), Red Skelton's later films and Howard Hawks' attempts at
screwball comedy all managed to soften the blow brought about by the
troubling times of the 1950's.</P>
<P>One of those films is the unheralded classic "THE GOOD HUMOR MAN" a
slapstick gem that manages to make nostalgic the innocents of the
1930's while taking place in 1950. The story is a simple little caper
about a good natured Ice Cream Salesman who is caught up in a scheme
to steal money from a payroll.</P>
<P>It what could have been an offshoot of the classic Red Skelton vehicle
"The Fuller Brush Man", "The Good Humor Man" manages to both charm and
enthrall with it's simple and witty comedy. Jack Carter stars as Biff
Jones, a mild mannered milquetoast who is in love with Margie Bellew
(Lola Albright). While driving home one night, Biff is confronted by a
Bonnie Conroy, a young woman who is being pursued by three hoods.
Biff, caught in the middle of the struggle is knocked unconscious by
the hoods, giving Bonnie an opportunity to escape.</P>
<P>When Biff is fired from his job, Bonnie reappears asking for his help.
Terrified, she pleads with the Good Humor Man to stay the night with
her for protection. Biff agrees on the condition that Bonnie buy all
of his ice cream. In the morning, Biff wakes to find Bonnie dead in
the living room. Convinced that he murdered the girl in his sleep, he
calls the police to turn himself in. When the police arrive, Biff is
dumbfounded to find that the scene of the crime has been completely
clean of all evidence. Situations change when Biff's Ice Cream truck
is reported to have been seen at the scene of a robbery of
$300,000.00. With Biff the primary suspect, it is up to him, Margie,
Her little brother and the Captain Marvel fan club to rescue him from
the bad guys and prove his innocents.</P>
<P>"The Good Humor Man" is a marvelously charming and good natured
comedy. The slapstick and mayhem in the film is of the Red Skelton, 3
Stooges, Laurel and Hardy school of comedy. Lots of double takes and
double entendre litter the plot and are so prolific that they create
second pulse for the film. There are a couple of instances of racial
humor, but nothing really offensive and is of the time and place the
film was made. The climatic chase and battle in the school classrooms
is a showstopper. Wire gags, sped up photography and just outright
silly situations create a loving tribute to the silent films of Buster
Keaton and Max Sennet. The last twenty minutes of the film is so full
of situations and comedic stunts as to be almost draining. The
filmmakers go all out to place one deadly and hilarious situation
after another, creating a sort of Rube Goldbergian series of captures
and escapes that is absolutely joyous in both it's complexity and
inventiveness.</P>
<P>Written by Frank Tashlin (formerly an Animation Director at Warner
Brothers), "The Good Humor Man" moves at a brisk pace. It's 79 minute
running time seeming a lot shorter. Using the plot from the thriller
"Appointment with Fear" by Roy Higgins, Mr. Tashlin has crafted a
grand piece of entertainment.</P>
<P>Director Lloyd Bacon, uses every trick in the book on this moderately
budgeted production. The use of wire gags and props is so expert in
their timing and execution, that one can't help but be reminded of the
classic Laurel and Hardy shorts. The performances by all of the cast
are perfectly tuned to the film, with larger than life villains and
damsels in distress. The surprising turn here is by future Superman,
George Reeves as the villainous Stuart Nagle. Never really appreciated
as a character actor, Mr. Reeves sense of timing is perfect, showing
him to be an actor of more range than ever given credit for. It's
really a shame that his part is so small in this film.</P>
<P>The best turn is from, of course Jack Carson. Jack Carson began his
career at RKO studios as an extra. He grew into on of the industries
most recognized character actors, working in such diverse films as
"The Strawberry Blonde" (with James Cagney) and "Mildred Peirce" (with
Joan Crawford in which he received his best notices). Mr. Carson uses
his famed double take to new heights here, playing Biff Jones as an
innocent man, still caught up in his childhood. That childlike
innocents is what makes the character so charmingly funny, much like
Red Skelton's character in "The Fuller Brush Man. He is not a buffoon.
He is a grown child, an essence that helps define (or defend) the
innocents of the time. This is Jack Carson's film. His demeanor and
stature (he stood 6 foot 2 inches), combine to make the character both
charming and believable.</P>
<P>"The Good Humor Man" is one of the industries most underrated
comedies. A charming and enjoyable romp that with give you some really
healthy belly laughs, if you're of the mind to succumb  to it's
simplistic charms.</P>
<P>On a side note, watching the film again recently; I've come to the
conclusion that some of today's film makers are more than aware of the
talents involved in this film. Such diverse projects as Tim Burton's
"Pee Wee's Big Adventure", and any of Jackie Chan's recent vehicles
all show an appreciation and love for this type of comedy. Not as
drawn out as some of Blake Edwards work (i.e. 'The Pink Panther, The
Party), but more in line with the work of Producer  S. Sylvan Simon,
and the many other talents that endeavored to make comedy something
universal.</P>
<P>Unavailable on Home Video presently, "The Good Humor Man" does turn up
on television from time to time. It would be well worth your while to
seek this film out. It is one of the best comedies of its time.</P>
