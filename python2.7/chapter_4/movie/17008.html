<PRE>Affliction</PRE>
<PRE>[3.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Wade Whitehouse is afflicted, but it is not a physical disease that ails
him, but rather it is the psychological and emotion scars of his childhood.
His detachment, distrust, and distorted perception are the result of
constant berating and beating in his formative years. As the oldest of the
siblings, he took it upon himself to intervene, and as a result, he was the
one who bore most of the wrath of his father. His younger brother Rolfe
learned early on (by avoiding the mistakes of Wade) how to avoid the abuse,
and has become a seemingly well-adjusted adult. Wade, however, was not so
lucky. He does not have a serious problem, but he is not able to maintain a
stable relationship. He want to wrest more visitation rights from his
ex-wife, but he is oblivious to the fact that his young daughter does not
enjoy the time she spends with him. A combination of events interact to push
Wade over the edge.</P>
<P>This film is similar in mood to "The Sweet Hereafter", another film based on
a novel by Russell Banks. Similar to that story, this one is filled with
symbolism -- from the bleak New Hampshire winter, to Wade's progressing
toothache. It provides an uncommon depth to the story. Nick Nolte gives a
fantastic performance as Wade by giving a subdued presentation of the
character, thus not relegating him to a simple psychotic. The viewer sees
all the events presented to Wade and can see how Wade's perspective is
causing him to potentially read too much into situations. Wade's childhood
abuse is made menacing by the fact that very little violence is shown, but
rather we only see its effects.</P>
<P>A common occurrence in child abuse cases is that sometimes a beating is so
severe (eg. broken bones) that medical attention is required. In order to
keep the abuse concealed from others, a lie is constructed. The ruse given
is that the injuries were caused by an accident, usually some type of fall.
The story suggests that one of the subtle scars that abuse victims carry is
a suspicion that events described as "accidents" may be actually be a cover
for more sinister events. This is often manifested at a subconscious level,
so even those who feel they have not been afflicted might miss this in
themselves.</P>
<P>Highly Recommended. This file features excellent writing, directing, and
acting. It will be enjoyed by viewers who like brooding, reflective
character studies.</P>
