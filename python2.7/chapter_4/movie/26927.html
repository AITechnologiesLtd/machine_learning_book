<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"Saving Grace" is a cozy rural comedy -- about marijuana. That statement
by itself should convince you that either this is an incredibly 
poorly-conceived film... or else that it's British. And indeed, "Saving
Grace" is a delightfully amusing little English lark, possessing more than
enough charm to overcome any reticence viewers might feel about its
seemingly incongruous subject material.</P>
<P>Instead of relying on elaborate gags and set pieces, first-time director
Nigel Cole opts for the tried-and-true British practise of establishing a
familiar, comfortable setting which is just off-kilter enough to tickle
the funny bone. Much of the action is set in a small Cornish village in
the middle of nowhere, where everybody knows (and gossips about) everybody
else.</P>
<P>The town is populated by such unlikely -- but not absurd -- characters as
a police officer who searches doggedly for poachers while living in
ignorance of the barely-concealed local marijuana stash, and two
well-meaning old biddies who are hopelessly naive, and probably a little
dense to boot. None of these characters are gross exaggerations, but none
of them are entirely realistic. They're regular people reflected in a
slightly warped mirror.</P>
<P>As befitting their role in the movie, the major characters are somewhat
more believable (if only just). There's gentle but sheltered Grace
Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn), recently widowed, who learns that her late
husband has bequeathed to her a massive debt she cannot hope to pay off.
Then there's Grace's gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote
the script), a man reluctant to seize the responsibilities that come with
age, despite the efforts of his girlfriend Nicky (Valerie Edmond).</P>
<P>Matthew is trying to grow a small marijuana patch in a hidden plot in the
garden of the local vicarage. When his crop begins to turn sickly, he 
turns in desperation to Grace, whose gardening skills are a matter of
local legend. Reluctantly at first, Grace nurses the plants back to health
-- better than ever, in fact. Gradually, she and Matthew hit upon the idea
of using Grace's greenhouse to grow enough pot to sell to a dealer and
make the money Grace needs to save her home (not to mention Matthew's
job).</P>
<P>What follows is a fairly typical sequence of events, as Grace and Matthew
try to keep their new line of work from the townsfolk, avoid Grace's
creditors, and find a drug trafficker to whom they can sell their haul
without getting their throats slit. There are very few surprises in the
narrative structure of "Saving Grace", but the material is nonetheless
well-written enough that this hardly seems to matter. It is difficult not
to watch the movie without a smile permanently creasing your face; that
the film only rarely provokes a huge laugh is almost irrelevant.</P>
<P>Blethyn gives a very even-handed performance as Grace. She has been given
no easy role, because Grace has to appear closeted and unworldly, yet not
overly stupid or childish. Occasionally, the script lets her down -- a
protracted scene in which Grace walks the back roads of London looking for
a dealer, dressed incongruously in her Sunday best, is more groan-inducing
than truly funny -- but for the most part, Blethyn holds steady. This
serves her particularly well in scenes such as her confrontation with
drug kingpin Jacques Chevalier (Tcheky Karyo). Their disarming tete-a-tete
would appear ludicrous in less skilled hands, but Blethyn makes it work.</P>
<P>Also very good is Ferguson, whose Matthew is probably the most
well-rounded character in the piece. He nicely captures a portrait of a
man trapped between his undisciplined younger years and the undesirably
mounting obligations of later life. He is paired well with Edmond, who
does a good job with her material; but unfortunately Nicky is just not
drawn well enough to match Matthew, and this dulls the energy of their
scenes together. Martin Clunes is also laudable as Matthew's best friend,
Dr Bamford, the village medic. As played by Clunes, Bamford is the sort of
man who looks at the world through ironic eyes, as though he never quite
believes what he is seeing. Clunes is consistently funny throughout 
"Saving Grace", and it's just a shame his role is not more integral.</P>
<P>"Saving Grace" proceeds well through its first two acts, but unfortunately
does come off the rails as it heads toward its conclusion. Whereas the
opening hour is carefully measured, slowly but assuredly building up the
intertwining stories of Grace, Matthew and Nicky, and the general
bemusement of rural life, the final thirty minutes is a cacophony of
different ideas. Beginning with Grace's spur-of-the-moment trip to London,
a slew of new characters are thrown at the viewer, and only some of the
resulting storylines emerge successfully. The ending of "Saving Grace"
feels very much like somebody throwing a cupboard-full of plates into the
air and seeing how many they can catch.</P>
<P>As a result, some subplots (including, sadly, Matthew and Nicky's) feel
abbreviated or abandoned altogether (one of Grace's creditors finally
comes to see her in person, gets hijacked into a separate thread, and is
then promptly forgotten). The main story of Grace's efforts to get out of
debt is handed an unforeseen and largely unbelievable resolution, as the
film fast-forwards ahead a year or two. It is the sort of ending that
makes you think the screenwriters were trying too hard to come up with
something that would both provide closure and send the movie out on an
uproarious note. In reality, it just comes across as odd and contrived,
and therefore accomplishes neither goal.</P>
<P>Still, "Saving Grace" is infectious enough that it is quite enjoyable,
on the whole. And despite its contentious subject material, it should
enjoy a wide appeal because it manages to be a movie about marijuana,
without really coming across as either pro- or anti-pot. "Saving Grace"
illuminates both the pleasant and unpleasant aspects of the matter -- and
pokes good fun at it all.</P>
