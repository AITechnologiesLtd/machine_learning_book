<PRE>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (M).  
(REP/Dendy)
Directors: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez
Stars: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams
Running time: 87 minutes.</PRE>
<P>If nothing else, 1999 will be remembered as the year in which
the internet became a vital marketing tool for films.  A case in point
is The Blair Witch Project, the ultra low budget independent film that
has become a runaway box office hit in the States, out grossing far
more polished, expensive studio productions.</P>
<P>        For months now we have been bombarded, via the internet, with
plenty of hype surrounding the film, preparing us for how scary it is,
and informing us that audiences have found the jerky hand held camera
work so unsettling that many have been rushing from the cinema to be
physically sick.  And the web has also been used to tell the back
story about the two hundred year old legend of the so-called Blair
Witch, who lives in the backwoods of upstate Maryland.  The site also
fills in the background information concerning the three student film
makers who disappeared, presumed murdered while making a film on the
popular legend.  Many people actually believe that this is a
documentary, compiled from the recently unearthed footage shot by the
three missing film makers.  Tyro film makers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez effectively create an unsettling atmosphere, and they
certainly play on the audiences' fears and expectations beautifully.
The film is shot using a combination of hand held video and 16mm film.
The hand held camera work is not as unsettling as the massive
publicity campaign would have it, and indeed much of the
cinematography here seems deliberately amateurish, which adds to the
overall effect.</P>
<P>The film follows three students - Heather Donahue, Joshua
Leonard and Michael Williams - as they set out to record a documentary
on the legend of the Blair Witch.  As the three become hopelessly lost
in the woods, hysteria sets in, and they quickly turn on one another,
blaming each other for their predicament.  These scenes are the most
effective and unsettling, as they establish a growing air of unease
that is fed by paranoia and distrust.  At night while they try to
sleep, the three are disturbed by the night time sounds of the forest,
which further unhinges them.  Are they imagining things?  Or has their
belief in the legend of the witch made them unusually jumpy?  Heather,
the project's director and narrator, and the dominant force behind the
three tyro film makers' journey, is also one of the most irritating
and annoying characters.  As her shrill voice unleashes another tirade
against her two male colleagues, many within the audience would gladly
feel like throttling her.</P>
<P>Most of the dialogue is also unscripted, giving the whole film
a natural and spontaneous atmosphere, that further adds to the
illusion of reality.  The Blair Witch Project is easily the most
cleverly marketed film of the decade (century?), but it is by no means
the scariest!  Only the more impressionable and susceptible younger
audiences may find any thing remotely scary and disturbing about the
whole thing.  Rather, this is a cynical triumph of style and hype over
substance.  You have been warned!
