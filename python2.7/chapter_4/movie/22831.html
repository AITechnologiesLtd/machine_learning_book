<P>   "Deterrence" mines the same fields as "Dr. Strangelove"
but Rod Lurie, who directs and has written his first feature
film, is about as distant from Stanley Kubrick as New York is
from Perth, Australia.  The story takes place in a single room-
-the only "opening up" occurring from file films--and fulfills all
the requirements of a particularly inept off-off-Broadway play:
barely workmanlike actors who look as though they couldn't
make it as waiters, virtually non-existent direction, and a
script that is so ludicrous that the "filmed play" looks more
like William Inge's comedy "Bus Stop" than like Sidney
Lumet's "Fail-Safe."  If you recall Inge's story, a bus out of
Kansas City pulls up at a cheerful roadside diner in the
middle of a howling snowstorm, with all roads blocked as
some weary travelers get set to hole up until the morning
when all hell breaks loose.  If Lurie had billed his movie as a
lampoon, he'd be off the hook.  But if you take a look at his
agitprop statement in the production notes, you might be
appalled at his one-dimensional, simplistic view of America's 
role in the world--all of which comes out in his depiction of a
president who represents the banality of evil.</P>
<P>   Lurie, an Israeli-born American citizen who went to West
Point, now bills himself as pacifistic and somewhat to the left
of center in his politics.  He appears to say in his notes that
Truman's decision to drop the A-bomb on Japan was inspired
by racism, pure and simple, since Japan was about to
surrender imminently with no land invasion by Americans
necessary: that the U.S. used the bomb not just once, but
twice on the Japanese civilians simply to show the Russians
that we had the weapon.  Similarly he believes that President
Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak), Lurie's fatuous creation, feels
little compunction about ordering the nuking of Baghdad
during a crisis since after-all-they're-only-Arabs.  If the acting,
direction and screenplay of "Deterrence" do not strike you as
absurd, perhaps Lurie's simplistic evocation of truth will.  All
in all, the picture is a travesty in every regard.</P>
<P>   The scene opens during a brutal snowstorm in Aztec,
Colorado in the year 2008, the inhabitants of a diner being a
cross-section of Americans.  Enter the president of the United
States (Pollak), his chief of staff Marshall Thompson (Timothy
Hutton), his national security adviser, Gayle Redford (Sheryl
Lee Ralph) and Special Agent Dexter (Ryan Cutrona). 
Trapped by the storm just as the polls close in Colorado's
presidential primary, the president naturally awes the cafe's
denizens, who include the owner, Harvey (Bajda Djola), a 30-
ish married couple, Taylor Woods (Michael Mantell) and
Lizzie (Kathryn Morris), a clueless waitress with a Quebecois
accent, Katie (Clotilde Courau), and redneck Ralph (Sean
Astin).  When Iraqi dictator Udei Hussein takes advantage of
the president's involvement in the primary and of a crisis in
Asia to invade Kuwait once again, President Pollak--a short,
uncharismatic man who had never been elected to the office
but who had taken over from the deceased chief executive--
does not have the manpower to divert to the Middle East to
turn back the invaders.  In the most preposterous decision of
this thoroughly ludicrous story, he ratchets up the ante on the
spot.  If Udei does not --get this--withdraw within two hours
and surrender himself in the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. will drop
a nuclear bomb on Baghdad.  </P>
<P>   Everyone in the audience during the special screening of
this movie was either biting his lip or simply being polite. 
How else to explain the complete absence of uproarious
laughter in the congregation? </P>
<P>  But that's not all.  Dismissing the advice of his national
security adviser and his chief of staff, the president instead
calls upon the American people, i.e. those middle-Americans
slurping coffee and serving chili in the cafe, to give their
opinions.  With the fate of the world in the balance (since Iraq
has threatened to drop its own recently purchased nuclear
missiles on New York, Sydney, Washington, Tokyo, Tel Aviv
and other Western allies), President Emerson puffs casually
on his cigar, gives a buzz on the pay phone to his wife back
in Washington (who tells him that she will not be his Eva
Braun), and goes on national TV.  He even discusses football
with the pilot of the B-52 which is approaching Iraqi air space.</P>
<P>   Timothy Hutton has been made up to look like "Fail-Safe"'s
Henry Fonda, thereby losing the boyish charm he displayed
so well in "The Substance of Fire."  But the 41-year-old Kevin
Pollak is perfectly cast: he got his start as a stand-up comic
on the San Francisco club circuit.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 101 minutes.  (C) 2000
