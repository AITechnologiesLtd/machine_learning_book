<PRE>                             THE AVENGERS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The screen version of the 60s TV
          classic will probably do well only with real fans
          of the series. Non-fans of the series should give
          this one a miss.  Still, this is just about the
          best and most accurate re- creation we could have
          expected at the end of the 90s.  Uma Thurman and
          Ralph Fiennes star in a film drenched in the 60s
          atmosphere of series THE AVENGERS. Those were not
          great stories and neither is this, but both are
          fun.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Starting in January 1961, the British were treated to a sort of
tongue-in-cheek crime and spy series on television.  THE AVENGERS was
about secret agent John Steed and his various partners who changed over
the years.  The original concept for Steed was to have the personality
of a George Sanders--sort of worldly and a little sarcastic.  I cannot
help believing part of the inspiration was also Ralph Richardson's
brawley-toting and bowler-hatted secret agent Major Charles Hammond
from the 1939 film Q PLANES (retitled in the U.S. CLOUDS OVER EUROPE).
Initially the partner was Dr. David Keel (played by Ian Hendry).  Later
for four years it was Catherine Gale (Honor Blackman).  When she left
the producers looked for a replacement that would have the same "man-
appeal" as Ms. Blackman did.  "Man appeal" was abbreviated "M-appeal"
and when actress Diana Rigg was hired "M-appeal" or rather Emma Peel
became her character's name.  She was not with the series even as long
as Blackman but hers were the years that the series got its widest
viewership.  She is the best remembered of Steed's partners, though
there were others before and after her.  The episodes of the Emma Peel
years were noted for a sort of 60s mod surrealism that became the
hallmark of the series.  That was a trademark and so was making the
characters veddy, veddy sophisticated and stylish.  So when in the late
90s, the film industry is making a feature film based on the popular
series, these are the years they choose to copy.</P>
<P>     And remake the series they really did.  The recent film MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE took place in the same world as the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV
series and had some of the same characters, but the writers clearly did
not know or did not care what a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE story was all about.
They told their own kind of story with characters from the series.  THE
AVENGERS on the other hand have authentically told an AVENGERS sort of
story and they have told it in the style of THE AVENGERS.  For the most
part, the faults of the film are actually cases where the original
formula did not age well.  As Mike Myers shows us in AUSTIN POWERS:
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, much of the 60s mod style looks pretty
silly today.  The story of THE AVENGERS is trivial and comic-bookish,
but that was the series.  The 60s mod surrealism comes through loud and
clear.  Suffice it to say that there are scenes in this film that are
sufficiently visually weird and unexpected to bring a smile to any
viewer's face.  Toward the end of each episode there usually was a
fight under outlandish circumstances and the circumstances in this film
are about as outlandish as any.  The only place where the formula was
not quite followed was that in the series any romantic feelings between
Steed and Peel were strictly between the lines of the script.  There
was a sexual tension, but the characters never acknowledged it.  In
this version is not much romance, but it is much more clearly spelled
out for the viewer.  The Michael Kamen and Joel McNeely musical score I
think should have made more use of the original music. The opening
title music is something of a letdown only because I had hoped to hear
a good version of the original theme.  This is one aspect where MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE was better.  In fact, the music could have done a lot more
to create the feel of the film.  In the final analysis it does little
to enhance the atmosphere.  Even if it was not trying to re-create the
60s feel, it should have been able to add to the excitement better than
it did.  There is one minor plot variation on the canon I would like to
add.  In the film, Steed and Peel meet for the first time, yet the
story also features Mother.  In the series, the very last episode with
Peel introduced Mother for the first time.  And to the best of my
knowledge the character of Father was invented for the film.</P>
<P>     Bon vivant and crack secret agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is
called in after an attack on the British government's secret weather
project Prospero.  Oddly enough the attacker seems to be there very
founder of the project, the beautiful and leggy scientist Dr. Emma Peel
(Uma Thurman).  In spite of actual film of Peel committing the crime,
Peel claims to be innocent.  Steed's suspicion falls on the aptly named
August de Wynter (Sean Connery), a flamboyant Scotsman who is doing
funny things to weather in a project that seems related to Peel's
Prospero.</P>
<P>     How are Fiennes and Thurman at re-creating the characters of John
Steed and Emma Peel?  Not too shabby.  The real danger is that a well-
cast Mrs. Peel will upstage the more quietly conservative John Steed.
However Steed holds his own and never becomes second banana to Mrs.
Peel.  Both seem physically up to the challenges of the role.  Both
seem to ooze charm and class.  Their interpretations are really fairly
close to the originals.  They have one minor change in style, they seem
to smile a lot less and are more serious about their work.  But they do
seem to be the same people the originals played.  And they are helped
along by Don MacPherson's script, which has a very AVENGERS feel.  I
kept picturing Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg delivering the same lines
and in almost the same way.  Patrick Macnee does not appear in THE
AVENGERS, by the way, while Diana Rigg is not in the film at all.  Sean
Connery is Sean Connery is Sean Connery.</P>
<P>     A little fine-tuning could have made this a perfect 90s
representation of the 60s TV series.  That might not have raised the
rating, but it would not have hurt either.  I give this one a 6 on the
0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
