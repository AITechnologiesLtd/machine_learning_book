<PRE>                               QUIET KILLER
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., not rated, Drama, 1992
Director: Sheldon Larry
Cast: Kate Jackson, Al Waxman, Jeffrey Nordling, Chip Zien,
      Barbara Williams, David Hewlett, Jerry Orbach, Howard Hesseman,
      Kathleen Robertson</P>
<P>     Kathleen Robertson comes down with what she thinks is just a cold.
She flies into New York City on a plane.  While on the flight she gets
really sick and when the plane lands Congressman Hesseman brings her to
her house.  Soon after, she dies.  A hospital does an autopsy on
Robertson's body.  Kate Jackson, a doctor at the hospital, finds out
that Robertson died of the pneumonic (bubonic) plague.  Jackson has to
try to stop the spread of the disease before it wipes out the population
of New York City.</P>
<P>     QUIET KILLER is a television film that aired on TV a few weeks ago.
I feel that it is a very good film, and worth mentioning.  It will
probably show up on repeats in a year to two years, or might show up on
video cassette.  I suggest that if you find this film, you see it.  I
give QUIET KILLER a four on a scale of zero to five.  Because this film
was made for television it doesn't contain anything objectionable.</P>
<P>     QUIET KILLER is based on the book THE BLACK DEATH by Gweneth
Cravens and John C. Marr, which I had never heard of before I saw this
film.  The way that the title of the film is done I think is creative.
Germ cells that are supposed to look like the pneumonic plague cells are
moving  inside the letters in the words of the title.  The acting in the
film, I feel, is quite good.</P>
<P>     The reason that I watched this film initially was because Howard
Hesseman starred in it.  I have been a fan of Howard since he did show
"WKRP in Cincinnati."  This is not Howard's best film.  I feel that his
best film was either the television film THE DIAMOND TRAP or POLICE
ACADEMY 2: THEIR FIRST ASSIGNMENT.  In this movie, like most of the
current films Howard has been in, he isn't on the screen very much.    I
really didn't expect this film to be very good because I felt, from the
write-ups on it, that it was going to be boring.  Instead it was a very
suspenseful film that is well written.  The plot doesn't let down at all
during the film which means the film never gets boring.  </P>
