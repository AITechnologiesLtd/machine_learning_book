<P>REVIEW: A Perfect Murder

Frederick Knott

<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and half stars</PRE>
<P>In A Perfect Murder, a loose remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for
Murder, Michael Douglas reprises a similar role to that of Nicholas Van
Orton in The Game.  He plays Steven Taylor, a wealthy and wise middle
aged man.  He's the kind of guy who says the right thing and the right
time, but plans his actions so meticulously and carefully that there is
bound to be a screw loose somewhere along the line.</P>
<P>Allegations have sparked over director Andrew Davis' work in this piece.
"Hitchcock's work should not be ripped off," the wags scoff, unaware
that Hitchcock himself adapted the screenplay from the original play
written by Frederick Knott.  Smartly, Davis attempts to use as much
Hictchcockness as any person other than Hitchcock could hitch.  There
are a small group of directors who can create similar feels of tension
and suspense that the great man seemed to achieve so easily, one of
which is definitely David Fincher, the mastermind behind Se7en and The
Game.  Australian Craig Monahan has also shown distinct skills for
unraveling a mystery in the grueling The Interview.  Sadly, Davis is not
one of them.  His direction is inconsistent and often unclear; at some
moments it's a little overpowering, others too passive.</P>
<P>Emily Hayes (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with starving artist
David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  Her husband, Steven, is not too happy
about the situation, and - for one reason or another - carefully hatches
a plot to kill her.  He hires David to do the deed, giving him explicit
instructions as to how to pull it off without incriminating anyone.
Surprise surprise, things go wrong…</P>
<P>Michael Douglas is always interesting to watch.  What is even more
interesting is his bizarre choice of films, of which many of them seem
to have a woman-hating theme.  Take Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct and
Disclosure for example, three of his best known films.  But it was The
Game which highlighted how impressionable an actor he can be, and he
must have enjoyed the experience because he now performs in a role
which, as I mentioned, is identical in many ways.  The only reason why
his performance in this film does not reach the same level (or actually,
lands well below the previous level) is the messy screenplay, which
misses out on the subtleties of his character.</P>
<P>That's a pity, since Patrick Smith Kelly has adapted Knott's play with
as much sophistication and puzzlement as he could possibly cram in. The
first half of A Perfect Murder is quite pleasing, as it introduces the
murder scheme with well-planned tautness and builds a genuinely
interesting scenario.  The real problems lie in the second half, when
the murder, planned murder or failed murder - which one, you can find
out yourself - has came and gone.  Thus the film takes one step forward
and two steps back, making some characters discover what we already
know, and others stand around and wait to mutter threatening lines of
dialogue.  In no time, everything seems a little silly.</P>
<P>For a film that really isn't too bad, A Perfect Murder is far from
rewarding.  It's the confused and faintly ridiculous conclusion to this
piece that will disappoint most viewers, as it is comprised of violence
and brutality - something that the film carefully avoids beforehand.
Although Davis is definitely not the 90's equivalence of Alfred
Hitchcock, he still succeeds with creating an intriguing mystery, if
only for a few sparse moments.</P>
