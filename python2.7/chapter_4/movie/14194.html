<P>Plot: A husband and wife and their young son head off to their lakeside 
holiday home. They are visited by two polite teenage boys, friends of 
their lakeside neighbours, initially come to borrow some eggs, but whose 
initial friendliness suddenly explodes into torture and sadistic games.</P>
<P>>From the film's opening credits where a family of three, on a placid 
drive to their holiday home change tapes on the car stereo and the 
gentle sounds of Mozart are suddenly replaced by a loud and raucous 
blast of death metal, director Michael Haneke signals his intent. And 
sure to his word `Funny Games' quickly shapes to be a film in the mold 
of `Straw Dogs', `The Last House on the Left' and `The Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre' wherein the idyll of a middle-class family is savagely 
overturned by outsiders and descends into a gruelling assault of sadism 
and torture.</P>
<P>It all begins innocently enough, with the introduction of the two boys, 
both dressed in white jerseys, shorts and plimsolls as though they were 
preppies returned from a day at the beach. An incident, which is comical 
in its gaucheness, where Frank Giering comes to borrow some eggs but 
keeps dropping them suddenly, unexpectedly turns violent. And from that 
point on `Funny Games' becomes a harrowing, psychologically gripping 
work of terror. (And one that not unfavourably compares to the 
aforementioned works above). The scenes of violence come with quite 
disturbingly casual regard - the dog and the child are blown away 
without any of the taboo reticence that affects Hollywood models. The 
casualness of the violence never comes more coolly understated than the 
shot focused on tormentor Arno Frisch who hears a gunshot ringing out 
from the next room while he is out in the kitchen making a sandwich and 
then calmly completes his sandwich before going to investigate. But 
director Haneke also propels home the full effect of the assault with 
emotionally gruelling regard - in one shot the camera remains in a 
single wide-angle for several minutes focused on a room with a body in 
one corner shot through the head, its blood splattering the tv, while 
wife Lothar sobs in the middle of the room and at the same time tries to 
drag herself past her grief to make an escape before the boys return. 
The prolonged effect of the shot is remarkably harrowing. The film is 
all the more effective for the performances of the two boys, especially 
Arno Frisch who manages quite unnervingly to swing between a perfect 
mannered politeness and casual sadism without the slightest change in 
expression - one moment insisting his tormentees stop screaming and 
start referring to everybody by their first name, the next breaking 
people's legs with golf clubs.</P>
<P>Haneke also manages to be surprisingly playful. At several points he 
starts to engage in meta-fictional (or should one say meta-filmic ?) 
play and has Frisch directly address the audience - turning to the 
camera to ask if the audience really thinks him as bad as his victims  
do; or offering a bet to his tormentees to see if they can stay alive 
until morning and then turning to ask the audience who they would bet 
on. At another point he decides that he will prolong the torture in 
order to pad the film out to feature length. And in the most amusing 
moment Lothar manages to get ahold of the gun and blow Giering away 
whereupon Frisch decides that things can't be allowed to happen that 
way, scrabbles for a remote control and rewinds the film to just before 
she got ahold of the gun so he can disarm her. Juggling between raw, 
disturbing violence and this sort of playful humour is extremely 
difficult a balancing act to get right without allowing the film to 
descend to bad taste or campiness, but it is to Haneke's credit that he 
succeeds.</P>
