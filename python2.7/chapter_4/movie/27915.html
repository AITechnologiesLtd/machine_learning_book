<PRE>"The Mexican" – Super Cast Sizzles, Story Fizzles
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>The good news is that for two hours, "The Mexican"
brings together actors who are currently at the
pinnacle of their careers and popularity.  Though
longevity in Hollywood is frequently ephemeral,
heartthrob Brad Pitt is still the recipient of much
adoration from moviegoers.  Effervescent Julia Roberts
is the hands-down favorite to walk away with her first
Oscar as Best Actress for her recent work as the sassy
"Erin Brokovich."  And burly James Gandolfini is known
as everyone's favorite Mob boss in HBO's incredibly
edgy drama, "The Soprano's."   The 'star-studded'
wattage generated by these three could solve
California's utility crisis.  </P>
<P>The bad news is that for most of the film, this quirky
romantic comedy separates Pitt and Roberts, who play
Jerry and Samantha, two star-crossed lovers with their
own agendas.  In fact, they each go their own way
about 15 minutes into the film.  It's a move that,
unfortunately, hinders the film's romantic cuteness
from really taking off. </P>
<P>In one of the first scenes, for example, Pitt and
Roberts are discussing their divergent priorities. 
He's an accident-prone bagman for a crime boss and has
promised Samantha that he won't take any more jobs. 
Samantha wants to go to Vegas to become a croupier. 
But when he is forced to take one more job or face
death by fire, Samantha becomes furious.  There's zest
in their emotions and these two make an adorable
couple.</P>
<P>Samantha leaves for Vegas while Jerry heads to Mexico.
 Well, maybe these two stars are so big that they just
couldn't fit on the screen at the same time.  But it
does give an opportunity for both of these stars to
flex their comedic muscles. </P>
<P>Jerry's final job takes him to some pallid village so
that he can pick up "The Mexican," a fabled antique
gun.  All he has to do is collect the antique and then
go home.  This fabulous weapon has quite a bit of
interesting lore, which is told through sepia-toned
flashbacks interspersed throughout the film.  This is
actually a nicely presented sequence, which tells a
tale that is fantastical and preternatural. </P>
<P>Poor Jerry.  Our hapless gringo is mired with bad
luck.  His rental car gets stolen, he gets arrested,
while allies become enemies.  He can only raise his
arms in disbelief.  We may raise our arms in disbelief
too.  This portion never has few precious funny
moments; and the bizarre violence isn't consistent
enough to add pep.  Jerry is probably just as annoyed
with his lack of luck as we are with the accompanying
harmonica and banjo soundtrack that makes it feel like
a bad Spaghetti Western.</P>
<P>Samantha represents the better half of this
relationship as well as the more enjoyable portion of
the story.  On her way to Vegas, she is intercepted by
a hitman (Gandolfini) who uses her as a hostage to
make sure that Jerry succeeds.  During the course of
her ordeal, they establish a connection with each
other.  She talks about Jerry; he talks about his love
woes.  Their dialogue scenes add a needed sense of
character dimension.  It's actually the most
entertaining element of this film.</P>
<P>Pitt, Roberts, and Gandolfini give fine performances. 
But it's a bit hard for us to stay in synch as the
momentum shifts between the two stories.  Overall,
"The Mexican" is sometimes cute, sometimes funny, and
offers a few neat surprises.  But its offbeat
qualities are uneven.</P>
