<P>"Blue, liberty; White, equality; Red, fraternity.  We wanted to show what 
these well-known historical notions mean to us today, who already possess 
liberty, who are already equal, and for whom fraternity is a common 
ideal.  Therefore, in BLUE, liberty is not treated in a social or 
political way ... but if we talk about liberty, we mean individual liberty, 
the liberty of life itself."
               - Writers Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz</P>
<P>     One moment, Julie (Juliette Binoche) had everything; the next, her
husband and daughter have been killed in a car accident and her own
face is a patchwork of lacerations.  The physical recovery proves less
difficult than the emotional one, and Julie ends up selling her house,
burning her late composer-husband's compositions, putting her mother in
a home, and running off to live in relative anonymity, with "no
memories, no love, no children."  Life, however, is intent on forcing
Julie to confront certain elements of her past that she might rather
not face.</P>
<P>     BLUE, the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's "colors" trilogy (WHITE
and RED have recently been completed, marking the director's farewell
to the industry, as he has announced his retirement), is a powerful
motion picture--both in terms of its dramatic impact and in its method
of presentation.</P>
<P>     Reminiscent of FEARLESS in the manner that it handles the
transformation of an individual through a life-altering tragedy, BLUE
delves deeply into the psyche of Julie and leads us to examine our own
perspectives on life, loneliness, and liberty as we watch her cope with
her new, and dramatically different, existence.  We are also reminded
that control is frequently an illusion.</P>
<P>     Juliette Binoche, in what amounts to a one-woman show, turns in
her best performance since THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, and
arguably her most accomplished ever.  She manages to bring an element
of humanity and sympathy to a potentially unsympathetic character.
There is little in Julie, as written, for the audience to latch onto,
but Ms. Binoche provides the emotional link to the story.</P>
<P>     Along with director of photography Slawomir Idziak, Krzysztof
Kieslowski has created one of the most technically impressive
productions in recent years, rivaling Martin Scorsese's THE AGE OF
INNOCENCE for sheer visual impact.  Mr. Kieslowski uses light and
shadow like a painter uses his pallet, and even some of the most simple
images--such as a sugar cube absorbing coffee--are memorable.  Then
there's the use of color--and one color in particular.  In addition to
blue filters and blue lighting, any number of objects are blue--a foil
balloon, a tinted window, awnings, a folder, the walls of a room,
coats, skirts, scarves, blouses, jeans, shirts, trash bags, crystals, a
lollypop and its wrapper, binders, graffiti, a pool, a van, and a pen.
Each use of the title color underlines the central messages.</P>
<P>     Lately, a number of French imports have had music as a common
element.  These have included such titles as TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE,
UN COEUR EN HIVER, THE ACCOMPANIST, and now BLUE.  Mr.  Kieslowski
makes use of Zbigniew Preisner's grand score in the same innovative
fashion that he molds the visual facets of his project.  The music
mirrors the actions.</P>
<P>     Coping with loss and trying to build life anew is certainly not a
unique theme, but the manner in which BLUE portrays one woman's journey
along this path is fresh and eye-opening.  As rich in emotional impact
as in style, this motion picture sets a high standard that we as
viewers can only hope the other two chapters of the trilogy will
match.</P>
