<P>The last time Clint Eastwood made a movie as a director that was under two
hours was 1990's 'White Hunter, Black Heart' in which he played a variation
on movie director John Huston who was on a quest to get 'The African Queen'
made.  Based on the novel by Andrew Klavan and written for the screen by
Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff, 'True Crime' has the usual
stamp of an Eastwood directed film.  It's long, and has a somewhat corroded
and protracted structure but Eastwood manages to land on his feet the way he
usually does --- by making it absorbing.  You would expect to find a quiet
and somewhat muted tone to a film that is a suspenseful take on the
execution of a possibly innocent man.</P>
<P>In 'True Crime', Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a seemingly washed up
investigative journalist who is one of those guys that cheats on his wife,
drinks and smokes too much, has little or no money, constantly fights with
his superiors, and through it all, is also great at his job.  As the film is
in its early stages, Everett is seen sleeping with the wife of one of his
editors (Denis Leary) who later finds out about the affair and upon
confronting Everett about it, both of them find that cooler heads prevail.
The same can't be said, however, for Everett's senior editor (James Woods),
who is hilarious and has some of the film's best scenes of dialogue in his
conflicts with Everett.</P>
<P>At San Quentin prison, a death row inmate named Frank Beachum (Isiah
Washington) is about to be executed on the day a young female journalist
from Everett's newspaper is supposed to do a human interest story about the
event.  She is killed on in a car wreck on the infamous Dead Man's curve and
the assignment goes to Everett.  He is told to do some straight reporting
and naturally he doesn't listen and the more he thinks about it and observes
the facts of the case, the more he finds out that the prisoner may be
innocent and he is on a last minute crusade to save his life.  Isiah
Washington is excellent in this film as Beachum and he accepts his fate in a
very calm manner.  The guards at the prison during his final hours are
polite and make things as easy for him as possible and Beachum refuses to
show any remorse for the crime to the prison chaplain since he insists he's
innocent.  His wife and little girl visit him (assuming its the last time)
and it's a very emotional scene.</P>
<P>Everett tries to balance his coverage of the story with his personal life
and had, on this day, promised to take his little girl to the zoo.  Never
one to balance his personal and professional life in proper perspective,
Beachum neglects his duty as both father and husband and pursues the story
which should be his first priority after all since a man is about to die.</P>
<P>In addition to being a taut and nail biting dram, 'True Crime' also succeeds
at being an very interesting rap of social commentary on both sides of the
death penalty.  It offers an explanation that at the time of lethal
injection, two guards push the button setting off the machine to inject
poison into the prisoner's system but a computer scrambles the motion of
events so each guard doesn't know who really administered the deadly
punishment.  Sort of like the theory of a firing squad where 6 men open fire
on their prey but only one has live ammunition.  The film also shows the
doubts and fears that prison officials have with carrying out their duty.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film takes wild an unexpectedly bizarre turn into
degrading its final twenty minutes into becoming an action picture.
Eastwood makes the film seem like it will throw you a curve ball at the last
minute and while waiting for the inevitable to happen, Eastwood is able to
keep the audience on the edge of their seats as things may turn out
differently than expected.  And Clint even uses slow motion at one point,
something he's long been against and I can't remember the last time he EVER
used it!  Through it all, the movie is well worth a look for the most part,
but waivers from being a potential classic and is instead another
installment in the Clint Eastwood director's library where his style is
becoming too typical.  How many times can you direct a film with pace and
feeling of jazz music, Eastwood's favourite form of musical rhythm which
doesn't always work in his movies!</P>
