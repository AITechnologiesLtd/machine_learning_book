<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Enemy at the Gates" is a big-budget WW11 story that begins with the
Nazi invasion of Stalingrad in September of 1942 and takes us to the end
of that six month battle where there were supposedly around two million
casualties. The outcome of that battle in favor of the Soviets changed
the course of the war. The opening battle scene is chaotic and bloody
that begs for comparison with the realistic way "Saving Private Ryan"
opened its film. It then becomes a typical Hollywood unrealistic,
clichéd war film, as its focus is on a cat-and-mouse game between two
expert snipers, the Russian, Vasily (Jude Law), who is a shepherd boy,
barely literate, self-effacing, from the Ural Mountains who learned to
shoot wolves who preyed on his family farm from his grandfather, while
the distinguished Nazi, Major Konig (Ed Harris), is a well-educated,
supremely confidant, middle-aged Bavarian nobleman. Their personal duel
takes place in the ruined buildings and factories of Stalingrad, as the
Nazi becomes the hunter, always one step ahead of his opponent, and the
Russian becomes the prey.</P>
<P>This old-fashioned type of hokey heroic war film, which since the
Vietnam War has been out of fashion, should be praised for its realistic
gory opening battle scene and for its Hollywoodish personal gun duel at
the end, which was as thrilling as the one in "High Noon." The problem
with this supposedly true story about a genuine Russian hero, was that
the long middle part was bogged down by an unmoving love triangle and a
lot of empty political rhethoric that slowed down the action and took
away from the suspense of the two snipers matching wits with each other.
It also took away credibility from the overall truth of this real war
story.</P>
<P>The film opens by showing the desperation of the Soviet soldiers who are
being sent into a battle they cannot win, as they are ordered by their
officers to charge the enemy or else if they retreat the Russian
officers are ordered to kill them. The frightened soldiers are caught
between a rock and a hard place. In this battle arena, by a fountain
surrounded by dead soldiers, there remains two Russians, Vasily and a
political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes). Vasily will prove his skill
as an expert marksman by killing five Germans in succession with five
bullets from a far distance. Danilov will see this as an opportunity to
make Vasily into a Russian hero of that battle, as this will be an
opportunity to raise Russian hopes which is at a low point, as he
receives permission from Nikita Khrushchev (Hoskins), the Soviet leader
of Stalingrad, to do this by printing a leaflet praising the heroic
shepherd boy. The two become partners linked together in the Russian war
effort, with Vasily becoming part of an elite sniper team that picks off
German officers and Danilov writes those stories in the official Soviet
newsletter of how many Germans Vasily kills each day.</P>
<P>The publicity works in building Russian morale, as fan mail pours in and
workers want to name their coal mine after him. The Germans respond by
sending their legendary sniper sharpshooter Major Konig to Stalingrad in
order to kill Vasily.</P>
<P>The local shoeshine boy Sasha (Gabriel Marshall-Thomson), a boy of
around eight years old, is so pleased that his mother is cooking a meal
for the Russian hero and to have met Vasily, that he is willing to take
on the dangerous assignment of spying on the German major for Danilov,
as he treks mysteriously across enemy lines to give info that Danilov
supplies him to give to the major.</P>
<P>A love triangle develops among Vasily, Danilov and a pretty
university-educated militia fighter, who studied at Moscow University
German literature and is eager to avenge the murder of her parents by
the Nazis, Tanya (Rachel Weisz). She is a neighbor of Sasha's, who
earnestly defends her hometown civilians as a sharpshooter. What adds to
the dilemma of the story, is that both Tanya and Danilov are Jewish, and
that Danilov has fallen in love with her but she has fallen in love with
Vasily, as Danilov proves how cunning and treacherous he could be in
trying to keep them apart. His role comes pretty close to being an
anti-Semitic caricature, which is odd for a film where the forces of
freedom are fighting the Nazi demons who are trying to wipe the Jews off
the face of the world.</P>
<P>But it is this love triangle that saps away from what the film was
about, which even more than the war story itself, is about two men
trying to see who is better at what they do. This could have just as
easily have been the theme for a sports film, therefore the politics
feels superfluous. When director Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in
Tibet/In the Name of the Rose) gets away from this main story and goes
into artificial subplots, the film sinks, but when he returns to the
final payoff scene of the battle between the two elite snipers with
different personalities and idealogies, the film works very well as an
action spectacle.</P>
<P>The trouble with the film, is that it didn't work well for stretches
that were too long, and the only performance I found interesting was Ed
Harris's. He had a quiet physical way of drawing out his character that
shows how cold his intelligence and sense of being was, as he hides a
monster behind his chiseled stoic features and icy blue eyes. Jude Law
played his role like a matinee idol in the old days of Hollywood war
films would, which was to look good under all the war grime and be the
good-hearted hero without a flaw. His performance did not hinder the
film, but on the other hand, it didn't seem special to me. But the
performance I found the most wanting, was Joseph Fiennes's, which I
found belabored with muddled Marxist speeches that made no sense. In
fact, his role never added up, as I have no idea what he was supposed to
symbolize. If he stops believing in the Marxist cause because a girl
rejects him as is indicated in the film, then he has to be a more
shallow character than the director intended him to be. His performance
woes could be blamed entirely on an inadequate script.</P>
