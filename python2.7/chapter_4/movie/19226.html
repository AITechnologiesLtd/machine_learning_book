A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Spike Lee</PRE>
<P>Written by: Spike Lee, Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli</P>
<P>Starring: John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino, and Jennifer Esposito</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
It's 1977 in a small Italian American neighborhood in New York. Disco music
is popular, and the Sexual Revolution is on, but the people of New York are
not happy. In fact, they're terrified. As in Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING
a heat wave has the city in its grip, and peoples' tempers are flaring. The
cool of night offers no respite: the neighborhood is being terrorized by a
nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the Son of Sam. No one knows
who the Son of Sam is, and no one is safe.</P>
<P>All around New York people are different. Aside from cultural groupings and
ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals. In the
Italian American section of town a philandering husband named Vinny (John
Leguizamo) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long
suffering newlywed wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino). Vinny's friend Ritchie
(Adrien Brody) hates disco, works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any
of the neighborhood folks to know. Ritchie's girl Ruby (Jennifer Esposito)
is trying to escape a reputation as a slut. Everyone's different, but
nobody in the film wants to be framed as "alien" to the community. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits
neighbor against neighbor. </P>
<P>Opinion:
Director Spike Lee's SUMMER OF SAM is not about a psycho killer. Nor is it
about cops trying to apprehend him. It's about differences and how, given
the right conditions, even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of
irrational suspicion.</P>
<P>One thing I found interesting in SUMMER OF SAM was the use of sex. In other
movies sex is glamorized. For example, James Bond gets a sexual reward for
winning. Or boring made-for-video "suspense" movies are spiked with
gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake. And every movie
or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual
prowess. Not so with SUMMER OF SAM. In a very gutsy move director Spike Lee
shows sex without fantasy. Sex is there, but it isn't gratuitous or
titillating. In fact, some of the main characters are downright lousy in
bed. Sex is in the film because (sexual) deviance is part of the film's
major theme of "difference" breeding hostility. In my opinion this kind of
movie sex is cutting edge for 1999, as rare and thought-provoking in
American cinema as showing a spanking.</P>
