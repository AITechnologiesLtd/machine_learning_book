<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is exactly what concerned parents
have feared that television and film would produce.  It is insulting,
dirty, sexist, racist and obnoxious; it's unapologetic and in your face.
Yet millions will flock to see the film, and most of them - myself
included - laugh at the sight of Saddam Huessein holding a fake penis,
trying to entertain the devil who is, at the time, lying in bed next to
him.  Perhaps it's reassuring to know that whilst there are plenty of
warped minds in the world, there are also the minds of Trey Parker and
Matt Stone, who have taken their cult TV show to the next step of
popularity and censorship tolerance.</P>
<P>'Longer and 'uncut' are appropriate words considering the trouble that
Parker, the director, has gone to, to ensure that his film performs on a
level that perhaps the television show - which looks tame in
comparison - always aspired to.  The good news for all you South Park
fanatics is that the movie, which is by no means a cult classic or a
must see, delivers the jokes and delivers them well.  Which is
convenient, because this film has more profanities than Eddy Murphy on
ecstasy, and for unsuspecting viewers will be more off-putting than Mal
Colston on a bad hair day.</P>
<P>Our four unlikely heroes are Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny, four young
kinds growing up in a small American town.  Trouble begins when the boys
attend a screening of  "The 'Terrence and Philip Movie," which I will
simply explain as a continuous collection of swearing and fart jokes.
Sure enough, these impressionable kids soon scream all kinds of
profanities around town, and all the other children join in.  Before you
know it, teachers at school are teaching how not to swear, and many of
the town's parents - including Cartman's mum (Mary Kay Bergman), who is
described "a dirty slut" - search for whom to blame.  After a catchy
music track titled "Blame Canada," the US does exactly that and war is
declared. Meanwhile, Saddam Huessein and his boyfriend, Lucifer, plot to
take over the world.</P>
<P>South Park is laced with cynicism and sarcasm at every corner, and in
that regard, it's not the piece of trash that some may have believed it
to be.  Yes, there is a little depth in South Park, even though you
might have to dig down deep to find it.  It's this film's humor that
makes it an appealing piece of modern television culture, produced in an
era where animated programs can carry just as much weight as any others.
Many of these shows rely on flowing dialogue rather than impressive
animation, and comical impersonations rather than profound political
insights.  South Park certainly doesn't rely on its animation - most of
which could easily have been made twenty years ago - so it's the film's
darkly humorous dialogue that gives it its edge.  If Parker and Stone
have proved anything, it's that there is nowhere they will not go, and
no gag they not will implement - regardless of how cheap the joke might
be.</P>
<P>Strangely enough, South Park is appealing as an eighty-minute collection
of gags and silly songs.  I found the film to be ten times more
satisfying and entertaining than one of its television episodes, and a
thoroughly amusing comedy if accepted on its own merits.  Thank heavens
that South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut amused me.  It could have been
accused of openly contaminating the minds of children, if Cartman didn't
say it first: "this movie has warped my fragile little mind."</P>
