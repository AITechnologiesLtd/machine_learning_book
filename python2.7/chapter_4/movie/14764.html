<PRE>           FULL MOON (Russian, in Russian with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: This is a story-less film told in a series of vignettes.
Each vignette is linked to the next as a background character becomes
the main character of the next.  Diverting though very little more than
the sum of its parts in spite of some repeated themes. Rating: 6 (0 to
10), 1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Probably most notable for the many points of view as the film
     progresses.
   - Directed by Karen Shakhnazarov.
   - I first saw this style of story-telling, or lack thereof, as a
     joke on MONTY PYTHON though the subsequent film SLACKER also used
     the technique.  The camera follows one character, jumps to a
     passerby, then follows him.  When it is all over you have a mosaic
     of life, but do not know any of the characters particularly well.
   - We see life in modern Russia and a little bit of history, though
     we do not actually learn very much.
   - There are some repeated themes.  A high proportion of the men seem
     to ogle women.  There are repeated references to Mongolia and to
     Genghis Khan.  Three different characters were affected by a scene
     in a restaurant in 1948.
   - At least twice there is sudden and unexpected violence.
   - Much of this film seems to take place almost in real time, but
     there are continuity errors.  We go from evening to the middle of
     the day.  A sunny day is suddenly dismal.
   - There are some well-known Russian actors, but none is on the
     screen very long.
   - There is a central mystery about a scene in a restaurant, but we
     never have even the simplest part of it answered.
   - The most enjoyable vignette puts us in the mind of a dog.
   - There is a minor piece about Pushkin stopping in Mongolia on his
     way to fight the Turks.
   - There are a few dream sequences, though none of any great fantasy
     value.
   - Winner of several international cinema prizes but not likely to be
     seen on the art-house circuit in the US.</P>
