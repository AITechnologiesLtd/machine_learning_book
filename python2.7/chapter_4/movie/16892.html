VOLCANO
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 1/2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<PRE> Volcano blows its wad way too early.</PRE>
<P> Even before the opening credits are done, we have seen ominous rumbling
underground and an earthquake that rocks Los Angeles.</P>
<P> Plus, the film isn't very believable, as disaster films should be.</P>
<P> Tommy Lee Jones stars as an ex-EMS who is called back into action (a la Sly
Stallon's character in Daylight [1996] ) when motlen rock starts pouring out of
the Lar Brea Tar Pits.</P>
<P> Anne Heche is also on board as a scientist, and, lo, she is pretty darn
wonderful. And very believable.  So is Jones, who is always great.  He'd make
paint drying look exciting.</P>
<PRE> The action is the only real drawback in the film.  </PRE>
<P> It's too dramatic and nonstop.  Not that volcanoes aren't dramatic.  Volcano
just trys too hard to extend its action from one scene to the next.</P>
<P> It is said Volcano cost a lot more than Dante's Peak, another volcano film
that came out about two months before.  Peak, which I thought was a thrilling,
intelligent, stunningly scary film, looks very realistic and was more apt in
the brains department.</P>
<P> Volcano looks cheap and not very sure of itself.</P>
<P> Enjoyable turf, it looks like a poor man's Irwin Allen.</P>
