<PRE>Anastasia (1956)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 73</PRE>
<P>Ingrid Bergman won the Oscar for Best Actress for her
role in "Anastasia", which cemented her Hollywood
comeback following her scandalous affair with
Italian director Roberto Rosellini.  The film was
based on the Marcelle Maurette play, and also provided
good roles for bald-headed, fiery-eyed Yul Brynner
and noted stage actress Helen Hayes.</P>
<P>Anastasia, youngest daughter of Czar Nicholas II,
was murdered by the Bolsheviks following the Russian
Revolution.  Or did she somehow survive?  Someone
apparently believes so, or they wouldn't have a
ten million dollar trust fund waiting for her to
show up to claim it.</P>
<P>It is the early 1920s, and Brynner is conspiring with
Akim Tamiroff and Sacha Pitoeff to produce a credible
Anastasia so that the account can be defrauded.  Bergman,
a woman without an identity who bears a physical
resemblance to Anastasia, is rescued from a suicide
attempt by Brynner.  He then coldly trains her to pass
as Her Majesty.</P>
<P>But there are many skeptics, and to succeed Bergman
must convince Anastasia's still-living grandmother (Hayes).
Along the way, it becomes obvious that Bergman really is
Anastasia.  She also must choose between two suitors,
pleasant rogue Prince Paul (Ivan Desny) and imposing,
abrupt Brynner.</P>
<P>The best thing about "Anastasia" is the dense script.
There are many clever lines that reveal the
idiosyncrasies of the characters.  Bergman, Hayes
and Brynner are well cast.  The biggest problem
with "Anastasia" is the ending; there is no romantic
chemistry between Bergman and Brynner, and it is
difficult to believe that Brynner would forgo his
hard-won jackpot and that Bergman would pass up a
chance to play Princess.</P>
