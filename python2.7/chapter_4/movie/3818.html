<PRE>                                     SMOKE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     When you sit in the theater, staring up at the big screen, during
the first few minutes of SMOKE, you *know* you're watching an "Art
Movie."  SMOKE obviously has no misgivings about its place in the film
chain, being perhaps the best example of a pure character-driven drama
to come along in ages.</P>
<P>     The sketchy plotline defies explanation.  Basically, SMOKE is the
lazy, drawn-out story of a smoke shop owner, Auggie (Harvey Keitel),
his estranged lover (Stockard Channing), a favorite patron/novelist,
Paul (William Hurt), and the young man who saves his life (newcomer
Harold Perrineau).  As $5,000 is kicked around among these characters,
their lives interact in unpredictable ways.  Sometimes this is
interesting, often it's just tiresome.</P>
<P>     Director Wayne Wang (of THE JOY LUCK CLUB) has taken a story in
the vein of TWENTY BUCKS and basically dragged the comedy out of it in
favor of giving us a talky melodrama.  The slow and deliberate pacing
of this film can't be stressed enough.  Auggie himself points this out
as Paul flips through his photo album:  a series of pictures of the
same street corner, one taken each morning at 8 AM.  Paul says he
doesn't "get it."  Auggie replies, "You'll never get it if you don't
slow down."  Wang himself explains that this scene is "the heart of the
film."</P>
<P>     That's a fine sentiment for an art gallery, but the last time I
checked, variable-speed movie projectors were still not in heavy use.
You can't slow down a film.  It has a natural pace, and Wang has
imposed an impossible gait on what could have been a memorable movie.</P>
<P>     It's a shame too, because at the heart of SMOKE are some genuine
characters with excellent actors behind them.  SMOKE is not only a
reference to the cigar store, but it's a metaphor for the fleetness of
life, happiness, and prosperity.  (You have to see one scene--the
world's most dysfunctional picnic--to really digest this fully.)</P>
<P>     In the end, sitting around, pontificating, smoking, and acting
cool can only carry a movie so far.  Maybe if Wang worked on
entertaining the audience instead of experimenting with format, this
film would have been a smoother smoke.</P>
