<PRE>HurlyBurly</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Anthony Drazan.</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Chazz Palminteri, Garry
Shandling, Anna Paquin, Meg Ryan.</P>
<P>What a contrast! In the space of two days, I saw Shakespeare In Love
and HurlyBurly. I'm not sure you could get two more different
movies. While the former was all over the top, telegraphing
everything, shoving its philosophy of life down our throats,
HurlyBurly was the complete opposite, wound so tight and with so much
buried in its script, one could spend weeks thinking about it.</P>
<P>This is one interesting movie. It's very much in a similar vein to one
of my favourite movies of '98, In the Company of Men, although not
quite so nasty.  There's lots of talking and some scary insights into
the world of men.</P>
<P>HurlyBurly doens't contain much plot: we just follow Eddie (Sean Penn)
around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around
him. His big question is: does it all pertain to him? And if it does,
how is he supposed to feel about it all? "It" means everything:
television, friends, events that happen. I guess it could be summed up
more crudely as: what's it all about?</P>
<P>This is not a movie for answers. Donna (Anna Paquin) gives some but
they're not really satisfying: they just lead to more
questions. That's what makes this movie stay on your mind. These are
the sorts of questions that occupy our time.  Even when we push them
to the background, however we resolve these questions influences
everything we do.</P>
<P>The performances are all superb in HurlyBurly. I haven't seen Sean
Penn in much before (in fact, I can't remember seeing him in
anything), but he is brilliant in this. Eddie isn't a likeable
character, but Sean Penn makes him understandable. I don't want to be
his friend but I'd like to help him.  Chazz Palminteri is also great
as Phil, making him an awful person. I'd never want to know Phil but
still I understand why Eddie wants to be his friend. Everyone in this
film nails their performances, making this world real.</P>
<P>It's a nasty world; it's a sexist world. Unlike Shakespeare In Love
which is unfailingly politically correct, HurlyBurly is a man's world,
seen unapologetically through the eyes of men. I find this fascinating
and on two counts, depressing. First, it's depressing that such a
world exists. A large part of HurlyBurly's success is that it
convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of
environment exists every day in Hollywood; that there are a large
number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral
to their world, toys, playthings. Sure, everyone is background to
everyone else but in this world, women are a long way in the
background. Second, these are the movies that are being made: stories
about men's world. Where are the stories about women's world? Not the
soap operas and the "chick flicks" that are meant to satisfy women,
but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like HurlyBurly
does for men.</P>
<P>HurlyBurly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the
moment the film starts. It's very talkative, intelligent and
static. While this can make the film drag a bit, and people sometimes
sound like they're quoting textbooks, mostly this is a good thing. Not
all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping
panoramas. Not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of
their audience. All it means is that HurlyBurly is probably just as
effective on video as it is on the large screen. It also means that
you have to pay attention.</P>
