<PRE>M (1931)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 78</PRE>
<P>Fritz Lang's first sound film was "M", a crime
drama that also made Peter Lorre a star.  The film
was made in Germany shortly before the Nazis
came to full power.  Both Lang and Lorre had
Jewish family connections, and would soon emigrate
to America where their respective careers would
continue successfully.</P>
<P>The story has Lorre playing a pathetic, tormented
murderer of little girls.  As the list of his
victims grow, Berlin falls into a state of panic.
Citizens begin accusing each other of being the
child killer.  In their frustrated search for the
murderer, the police crack down heavily on criminal
activity.  Organized crime figures decide that they
must find the killer themselves, to return to
business as usual.  Soon, both the cops and the
crooks are closing in on Lorre.</P>
<P>Lang takes pains to show the similarities between
the police captains and the crimelords.  Both meet
seperately to decide how to stop the killer, and
Lang switches back and forth between the two meetings.
While the two groups may have different methods, the
end result is the same: Lorre is to be identified,
captured, tried, and executed.</P>
<P>Lorre was well cast as the killer.  His nasal voice
and unsettling manner and appearance played to
stereotypes of what a child killer would be like.
Once he becomes hunted, his wide eyes and furtive
behavior express fear and desperation.  Once in
Hollywood, he would overcome this early stereotype
in a series of Mr. Moto films, and was later best
known for his supporting roles in "The Maltese Falcon"
and "Casablanca".</P>
<P>Hollywood would remake "M" in 1951, using none of
the original crew or cast.</P>
