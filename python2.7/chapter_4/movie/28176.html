<PRE>THE DISH
--------</PRE>
<P>While the U.S. moon landing was a worldwide event, most people are probably
unaware of Australia's role.  In a sheep field in Parkes sits the largest
radio telescope station in the Southern Hemisphere, a prime location to 
track communications with Apollo 11 and relay television pictures back to
Earth.  Three Australians and one American NASA technician will beat amazing
odds to fulfill their task in "The Dish."</P>
<P>Although names have been changed by screenwriters Rob Sitch (director, "The
Castle") and Tom Gleisner (also producer), "The Dish" is based on actual 
events of 1969.  Recent widower Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill), a professorial,
cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking type, leads the crew at Parkes' radio telescope.
Glenn (Tom Long) is a literal, nerdy mathmetician attempting to work up the
courage to ask local lass Janine out.  Mitch (Kevin Harrington) is Glenn's
tormentor and the most perturbed by the presence of American Al Burnett
(Patrick Warburton, TV's "Seinfeld").  Burnett's been sent in to coordinate
the effort and checks and rechecks everyone's work to ensure a smooth
operation.  There's also a new member of the team, Rudi (Tayler Kane), Janine's
rather simple brother who's been hired as a security guard.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Parkes' mayor, Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing) and his wife May
(Genevieve Mooy) are busy preparing for the arrival of such exotic visitors 
as the American Ambassador (John McMartin) and the Prime Minister (Billie 
Brown) while the exuberant teenage Army volunteer next door attempts to
court their disdainful daughter Marie.</P>
<P>Things don't go smoothly.  The local High School band plays the theme to
"Hawaii Five-O" in place of the U.S. national anthem at the Mayor's 
reception.  Then Parkes loses power and prideful Mitch must face up to the 
fact that his neglect to clear fuel pump lines has cost the telescope its 
backup generator.  Cliff lies to NASA to buy time while the team frantically 
recalculates the equations needed to relocate Apollo 11 - even Al breaks
character and lies to NASA.  After this challenge is overcome, the team find
that due to a problem in California, their station will be the primary
television broadcast dish for the moon landing itself, while winds gust to
levels more than twice what the dish has been engineered to sustain.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast breath humor and life into this story.  Neill's Buxton
makes us empathize with the bittersweet nature of his success in the shadow
of his wife's death.  His serenity has a calming effect on the other, more
tightly strung crew members.  Wharburton shows range with his serious
workaholic who allows the Australians to bring out a sense of fun ('I think
we ate a whole sheep,' he tells Glenn and Mitch after returning from Sunday
dinner at the mayor's).  Tayler Kane provides most of the laughs as the
self-important but imbecilic Rudi announces his presence in various 'sectors'
of the station and believes he's talking to Neil Armstrong over his walkie
talkie.  Roy Billing is a delight as the mayor who retains his hominess while
bidding for political recognition.  McMartin plays the Ambassador as a 
stereotypical good-natured American.</P>
<P>Sitch keeps every element of his film perfectly calibrated.  Cinematographer
Wood is able to capture a shot to relay the laughs, romance or majesty required
by the action.  Editor Jill Bilcock artfully arranges those images,
particularly in a fabulous montage which shows the mechanical workings of
the dish played out against the late 60's instrumental "Classical Gas."</P>
<P>"The Dish" finds a place where gentle charm and humor live side by side with
the awe and grandeur of man's accomplishment.</P>
