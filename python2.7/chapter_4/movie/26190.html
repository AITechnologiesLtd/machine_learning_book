<P>Hey, I'll admit it: the built-in double entendre of WOMAN ON TOP was
more than enough to draw me to the theater to see it.  That, and the
chance to see the gorgeous Penelope Cruz [which leads me to an
observation: how many straight men would you ever "hear" admit to how
gorgeous a given *male* is, hmmm?  But I digress.] strut her stuff
alongside Mark Feuerstein (one of my favorite actors from ABC's ONCE AND
AGAIN series) in a comedy, was all I needed to spend 83 minutes in a
dark theater looking at a projection on the wall.  It was enough to get
me there; but would it be enough to hold my interest?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Brazilian-born Isabella Oliveira (Penelope Cruz) has two great
qualities: she's extremely beautiful, and she's a great cook - and one
strike against her: debilitating motion sickness.  It affects her to the
point where she can't move at all unless she controls her movement; she
has to drive, she has to dance lead, and during sex, she has to be the
one on top.</P>
<P>This creates a problem with her equally beautiful husband, restaurateur
and balladeer Toninho Oliveira (Murilo Benicio); a man's man who takes
the credit for his successful restaurant while his chef wife does all
the work in the background, Toninho just can't hack not being in control
of every facet of Isabella's life, and rebels in the best way he knows
how: he has a quickie with one of their neighbors.</P>
<P>Isabella, outraged, leaves Toninho and flies - with terrible motion
sickness - to San Francisco, where she hooks up with her childhood
friend Monica Jones (Harold Perrineau Jr.), who happens to be a
transvestite [and thankfully, not a "tragic" one; Perrineau looked good
as a woman, dayam!]  After a wee struggle in looking for a job, Isabella
gets a teaching gig in a local culinary school, which leads to her
discovery by TV Producer Cliff Lloyd, who is as awe-struck as nearly
every other man (and, woman) by Isabella's beauty as well as her cooking
talents, as is Lloyd's boss, Alex Reeves (John de Lancie).  But even as
things go well for Isabella, she still finds herself missing one
important thing: control.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Let's go back to The Story for a minute, to the part where I said
"Toninho just can't hack not being in control of every facet of
Isabella's life" - because that's where my first problem with the
beautifully-filmed and lead-casted WOMAN ON TOP begins: I didn't get
that impression right off.  Yes, the script did mention it here and
there, and yes, from all the generalizations of Brazilian men and
"their" women that I've ever heard, I could believe it; but precious
little in the early bits of the movie, convinced me that it was such a
Problem that it became unbearable to Isabella.  In fact, I was surprised
that events played themselves out as quickly as they did in this short
(time-wise; long, story-wise) film; the audience was treated to many
idyllically-romantic scenes of the two beautiful lovers doing what comes
naturally to them, a couple quick glances of Isabella's Control Issues,
then BAM!, her Control Issues (and his sudden need to be On Top himself)
break them up.  Uh...huh?  Where'd that come from all of the sudden?</P>
<P>Problem two: we switch quickly to San Francisco, where we meet Monica
"RuPaul with better makeup" Jones and swiftly learn, in the space of a
sentence or two from Monica and Isabella in their bathtub scene (an
interesting set-up, to be sure) of their Long-standing Childhood
Friendship.  These quick snippets - and the similarly speedy
introduction of TV Producer Cliff Lloyd - seemed an afterthought, a way
of identifying the characters without giving the audience a solid look
at what they were made of.  It felt rushed, as if the filmmaker was
hurrying to get to a certain point in the movie, only to repeat that
point over and over again.  Which leads me to...</P>
<P>Problem three: the sense of deja vu.  That is, the feeling that the
movie constantly repeated itself; how irritating, then, that the film
switched gears from being too little, too quickly, to being too much,
too often.  Hard to believe that in the space of only 83 minutes, a
movie can Say what it had to Say, and still have, oh, a good 40 minutes
of filler added.  This part of WOMAN ON TOP was classic Lather, Rinse,
Repeat: Isabella and Toninho Lovingly Gaze at each other, they embrace,
they have a Misunderstanding; Lather, Rinse, Repeat.  Isabella
smells/tastes something that reminds her of Toninho, she remembers
making love to him, she gets flustered and angry; Lather, Rinse, Repeat.
Toninho pursues a reluctant Isabella, he sings love ballads to her
(complete with travelling band), Monica says something Sassy; Lather,
Rinse, Repeat.  This happens ad nauseam throughout the movie, enough to
give *me* motion sickness.</P>
<P>Three things that WOMAN ON TOP did have going for it, and that elevate
it from the mundane straight-yellowlight rating, were the strong
attractiveness of, and chemistry between, Cruz and Benicio; the
funkiness of Perrineau's Monica Jones (save the broadness of the
character, it was hard to remember at times that there was a *man* under
all that!) until he...uh, she...eventually wore that Go Girl thing out;
and the best, most non-commercial soundtrack I've heard in ages.  Alas,
these strengths were not enough to make this one-note film work its
magic in the end; while there were pleasant moments scattered
throughout, the moments didn't congeal into a satisfying whole.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<P>    [Or, to be more precise for this movie, the "Ethnic Factor"]</P>
<P>Another thing bothered me about this movie, though I'm not sure whether
it should have; whether it was reasonable for me to expect to gain
Cultural Understanding from a comedy about people who happen to be
Brazilian simply because I'd never seen a comedy about Brazilians
before.  What bothered me here is that I came away feeling that the only
thing I Learned about Brazilians is that they make great music and great
food.</P>
<P>The most ironic thing about Isabella's Issue with the Network TV Suits'
insistence on her show not being "so ethnic", is that the only thing
that seemed at all ethnic about "Passion Food", was Monica's dress and
Toninho's backup band.  "Sexy as all get up"?  Sure.  But "ethnic"?
Hmmm.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I wavered on rating this film: part of me wanted to give WOMAN ON TOP an
unabashed greenlight for its beautiful Brazilian music and its even more
beautiful stars, Penelope Cruz and Murilo Benicio.  My Greenlight,
though, generally indicates that I'd pay to see a movie again - and I
just don't think that's the case, here.  Still, it's worth seeing once,
if only to see Harold Perrineau Jr. outdo RuPaul's schtick.  Man, whadda
woman...</P>
<P>WOMAN ON TOP (rating: flashing yellowlight):
WOMAN ON TOP was teasingly Spicy, to be sure; but like many Hot things,
its Heat alone wasn't enough to satisfy my appetite, and left my thirst
unquenched.  But I will be buying the soundtrack, sho'nuff.</P>
