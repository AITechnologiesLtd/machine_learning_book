<P>Please note that I have written this review with a great strain on my
objectivity. You see, besides Quentin Tarantino, there has been no greater
writing influence in my life than Kevin Smith, the director of this film. I
say this because I do not want you to think that I am pretending to forget
or put aside my grand respect for the man, because I couldn't do that even
if I tried. In fact, besides being a great writer/director, I simply believe
him to be an upstanding human being as well. Okay, now that you know my
dirty little secret, let's see what I have to say...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two renegade angels attempt to get back into Heaven through a loophole that
they find at a church in New Jersey. A woman who works at an abortion clinic
is chosen by the voice of God to stop these men, along with the help of two
"modern" prophets, the 13th unknown apostle and a muse/stripper, before the
angels cross the threshold and lead to the end of all human existence.
Simple enough?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Ambitious, original, funny film about a bunch of religious figures pasted
into a modern fantastical world environment with a lot of tedious
theological speak and a lot of "dick and fart" jokes (as Kevin would say).
It's hard to say who this type of movie is going to attract, since the
young, non-religious hipsters (okay, I'm not so young but I still consider
myself part of this group) will probably not appreciate all of the religious
points made in this film, and the older, religious non-hipsters will
probably not appreciate any of the more juvenile humor, which I thought was
hilarious. Maybe the older, non-religious, hipsters or the younger,
religious, non-hipsters? Either way, I personally enjoyed it for most of
what it represented which was an alternative point of view on religion,
Catholicism in particular, and the unrelenting humor written by Smith for
his Jason Mewes and Chris Rock characters. Jay simply rocked! I could
honestly say that if Silent Bob and Jay were not in this movie, I might be
hard pressed to recommend it so highly.</P>
<P>One thing that you have to know going into this film is that it is a
fantasy. A modern-day comedic fantasy, but a fantasy nonetheless. On the
whole, most of the mythical elements seemed to meche flawlessly within the
modern-day environment, but others just appeared too fake for me to get
around, like the wings on the angels and the horns on Jason Lee. Also, as
much as I tried I could not help but think "that's singer Alanis Morissette"
when God made her first appearance. I just couldn't help it! The more I
tried not to think about it, the more I did. Isn't it ironic? Anyway, I
recommend this film under the two main conditions that I liked it which were
the overall story, which was interesting, and the humor-laced script which
was peppered with particularly great lines for Jay and Rock. I thought the
Affleck, Damon and Rickman characters were a little too drowned in their
explanatory religo-babble (a 20-minute trim-job might've helped), and Hayek
distracting (well, in some good ways but also in some bad), but overall, the
film was original, funny and certainly inventive.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
A convention premiere of DOGMA in Atlanta during the first week of November
1999, provided some more insights into the man better known as Kevin Smith.
1) Kevin claimed that he only wants to direct ten films in total and that he
only has three ideas for future films ready now, so it might turn out to be
only seven. The one idea that he did mention was an adaptation of Mage
(comic book).
2) Kevin said that Jay and Silent Bob would probably be in one more film and
then would only appear in the comics and the Clerks Animated Series.
3) He also explained that one of the major problems that he had with
Superman producer Jon Peters while he was still attached to the project was
that Peters wanted Braniac to have a "gay" robot sidekick (similar to C3Po).
He even wanted the black guy from CHASING AMY to do the voice.
4) Other than Ben Affleck, Chris Rock and Matt Damon, Smith said he would
not try and get big name actors for his movies.
5) He said that the reason Jeff Anderson (Randall from CLERKS) wasn't in
MALLRATS or CHASING AMY was that Anderson had a falling out with Smith over
some money from CLERKS. The good news is that Anderson does have a small
role in DOGMA as the gun store clerk. Note that Brian O'Halloran (Dante from
CLERKS) also has a small role in DOGMA as the reporter.
Kevin Smith wrote the DOGMA script before he had ever written his first
flick, CLERKS, but shelved it because he wanted to do it with the proper
special effects.
British actress Emma Thompson was originally slated to play the part of God
but pulled out before filming began in order to have a baby.
As usual, dozens of other movie references show up in the film (too many to
enumerate here, but I'm sure they'll show up on many a Kevin Smith fan page
over the next few weeks), but at least five John Hughes films were referred
to directly in this film. Smith has always said that he "grew up" on John
Hughes comedies and admires them.
Smith got married to reporter Jennifer Schwalbach in 1999 and had a daughter
soon thereafter. The child was named Harley Quinn (also the name of a
character in TV's "Batman: The Animated Series").
This should also go without saying but Kevin owns his own comic book store,
"Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash" in Red Bank, New Jersey. He had
apparently sold his comic book collection for money to film CLERKS (which
cost about $27,000), but bought it all back once the film became a huge
success.
The "guy on the bus" character is played by none other than producer Scott
Mosier.</P>
