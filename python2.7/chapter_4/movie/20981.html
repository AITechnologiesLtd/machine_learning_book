<P>Movies about serial killers are typically from some detective's POV as he
and we try to figure out just who the serial killer is. Why is it like this?
Simply because if the audience isn't seduced into some sort of sympathetic
relationship with the ostensible main character of the movie, that movie
doesn't work. We've got to care about the main character, not want him or
her to die. And, if the main character were the serial killer, well, it
would be that much harder to make him or her sympathetic. So most take the
conservative way out, allow the killer to be the focus of things, but make
the sympathetic detective the main character, the one we can feel
comfortable identifying with. Hampton Fancher's The Minus Man turns this all
around, makes the serial killer the main character. Which isn't all that
new, really, but, instead of establishing some sort of hierarchy of
immorality whereby the killer is serving some vigilante conception of
justice (Slingblade), Fancher makes his serial killer just as random and
heartless as Early Quaid from Kalifornia, or, better yet, Henry, from
Portrait of a Serial Killer.
His name is Vann Siegert. He drifts around in a phantom-grey 1979 F-250. And
he kills people (in a low-budget way), and he's done it enough that he even
has self-imposed rules, and he's played by none other than Owen Wilson (in a
Bottletrocket-ish role), ingratiating himself at every turn with his
I'm-showing-all-my-teeth-Mom smiles, his wide range of shy shoulder shrugs,
and a childlike diction which supplies a lot of the dry humor of The Minus
Man ('If Doug did something bad to his wife, he sure picked a bad time').
None of this is kept from us, either. From the opening frames, when he does
away with the down-and-out Caspar (Sheryl Crow, debuting), we know that Vann
Siegert's our Minus Man here. What we don't know is why, and Fancher uses
this generated need for explanation to pull us through the rest of the
movie. It's a device, yes, one most often used when the middle parts are
going to directionless enough that direction has to come from elsewhere. To
look at it another way, the idea is that if we want the answer badly enough,
we'll sit through anything to get it.
But then anything stretches two artfilm hours, which is to say clever
dialogue mismatched with an overly deliberate pace. Or perhaps perfectly
matched, imperfectly conceived. Either way, it drags at times, though of
course there's the necessary developments: the unsuspecting potential victim
Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), a postal co-worker/love-interest, the
escalation/rising suspicion which results from too many bodies suddenly
turning up, the injustice of killing those who don't really deserve to
die--all the usual serial killer stuff.
What's strong about The Minus Man, though, is that there's more.
Specifically, there's serial killer Vann Siegert having bad enough luck to
rent a room from the most deranged family in town. And he's supposed to be
the deranged one here. As it works out, though, he quickly becomes something
of a replacement for the family's missing daughter, and subsequently finds
himself doing everything he can to keep that family sane. All the while of
course leading his double life--killing people on the side with zero
remorse, no passion. In fact, his 'killings' and the running monologue he
keeps about his bad habit suggest that he either sees himself as some
impersonal force of nature or wants to be that impersonal force of nature.
Which is as close as we ever get to any explanation. So be it.
Vann Siegert doesn't just talk to himself about it, though, either. As in
Chasing Amy, he has a couple of imaginary friends to bounce ideas off of.
But these imaginary friends, they're something of a cross between a David
Lynchian 'projected guilt' trick and the little kid who beat up Keifer
Sutherland in Flatliners. Meaning they 'bounce' ideas off him. Dwight Yoakum
and Dennis Haysbert, FBI agents extrordinaire, who together comprise about
2/3rds of the law in The Minus Man. The other third is a real state trooper,
whose presence allows an equally real Clay Pigeons type ending, which is the
only intense scene in the whole movie. Better late than never, right? When
all else fails, do what's been done. Fancher does, and it works, but just
barely.
