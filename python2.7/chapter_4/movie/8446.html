<PRE>BLUE VELVET (1986)
A film review by Nick Schaden
Copyright 1997 Nick Schaden</PRE>
<P>        "Blue Velvet" opens with images of the perfect "Beaver Cleaver" town:
painted white fences, open blue sky, a friendly waving fireman in slow
motion.   Nothing could be farther from the truth.   That is the
underlying theme in David Lynch's "Blue Velvet", one of the most
controversial and critically acclaimed movies of the 1980s.</P>
<P>        "Blue Velvet" paints the picture of Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan),
a young college student returning to his hometown as a result of his
father's illness.   On a walk through the woods on the way to the
hospital where his father resided, Jeffrey finds a human ear in the
grass. The human ear is somehow connected to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella
Rossellini), a singer in a local bar. Jeffery decides to investigate,
with help from a high school girl (Laura Dern).   Their adventure goes
through many twists and turns, eventually meeting one of the most
hideous, evil villain in movie history, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).</P>
<P>        I don't talk more about the actual "adventure" because doing so would
reveal the full plot of "Blue Velvet", one of the most disturbing and
innovative in film history, in my humble opinion.   In sum, while the
plot on the surface may seem quite simple, the underlying theme director
David Lynch is trying to show is much deeper.  Lynch works hard, winking
to emphasize the irony of an idyllic American
town with perversity and darkness beneath it all.</P>
<P>        Now the big question: why is "Blue Velvet" one of my favorite movies?  
I think the greatest strength of the movie is the art.   Director David
Lynch pulls into the movie, using visuals and sound unlike any other
movie, magnifying the mystery and horror of the movie's nature.  
Second, it's bold, horrific, and probably the most original (and
shocking) drama/mystery I've ever seen.   Finally, the theme is deep and
thought provoking, with many scenes from "Blue Velvet", imbedded deep
into my mind.</P>
<P>        With all my praise, I highly recommend this movie with a very serious
warning: this movie is VERY disturbing, and not for everybody.   It has
very graphic portrayals of violence, sex, and other bizarre subjects,
let the viewer beware.   However, for those who can handle it, it's a
wonderful and captivating movie.</P>
