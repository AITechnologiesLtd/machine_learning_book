<PRE>                                   THE SNAPPER
                       A film review by Richard Montanari
                        Copyright 1993 Richard Montanari</PRE>
<PRE>Up the Pole in Barrytown<HR></PRE>
<P>     Sharon Curley is havin' a snapper, wot?  A whippersnapper, that
is.  A baby.  Except the twenty-year-old Sharon's not married, see, and
still lives at home with her rather large, rather eccentric Dublin
family--her youngest sister wears shaving cream around the house,
her dad greets neighborhood dogs at the door, by name, and shows them
to the parlor. In defiance of all the cajoling and threats, Sharon is
simply not about to identify the father of the child.</P>
<P>     But Desi Curley, Sharon's father, can't let it go. He is
determined to get to the bottom of it. No matter how many pints of
Guinness Stout he has to imbibe in the process.</P>
<P>     And so goes life in THE SNAPPER, the second installment in the
Barrytown trilogy by Irish novelist Roddy Doyle. The first act, THE
COMMITMENTS, itself made into a smashing 1991 film by Alan Parker,
introduced us to a group of working-class Dublin kids hell bent on
forming a soul band.</P>
<P>     This time we meet the Curleys, an endearing cast of Dublin
characters headed by Desi (Colm Meaney), a man best trusted when the
statement in question is sworn to be true, "... on the Boible."</P>
<P>     The main suspect in putting Sharon "up the pole" is George Burgess
(Pat Laffan), a neighborhood stalwart and mini-pillar in the
community.  This causes some distress to Desi because George Burgess is
about ten years older than he is. Desi confronts the alleged lecher in
the pub one night, but the man denies it.</P>
<P>     So, why then is old Georgie following Sharon around Barrytown,
moon-faced and forlorn?  In spite of the repeated efforts of Sharon's
girlfriends--a tough-talking cat-pack reminiscent of the sexy backup
singers The Commitments--Sharon remains steadfast. She say she
wouldn't give it up, even if she'd " ... shagged the Elephant Man."</P>
<P>     As the blessed day draws near, the Barrytown intrigue rises, with
the possibility of a Spanish sailor being introduced as the potential
father, claims and counter-claims, attempted bribes, pub brawls and,
certainly not least, Desi's remarkable transformation into a sensitive,
working-class feminist, courtesy of a birthing book called Everywoman.
The change is so complete that even Mrs. Curley (Ruth McCabe) reaps a
few benefits, in the kip, if you know what I mean.</P>
<P>     By the time little Georgina is born (7 pounds, 12 ounces, "big for
a baby, small for a turkey,") the Curley clan is once again intact and,
for better or worse, the first thing the little snapper will see when
she gets around to opening her eyes.</P>
<P>     Director Stephen Frears (DANGEROUS LIAISONS, THE GRIFTERS, HERO)
returns to the working class milieu of MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE with a
remarkable comic touch, a sensitivity to the comedy of the mundane that
seems, for some unknown reason, exclusive to the Brits.  And while some
of the nuances of this very parochial Irish film may be lost on
American audiences (including this reviewer), and some of the accents
may go undeciphered, these moments are scant.</P>
<P>     Colm Meaney's performance as the beleaguered Desi Curley is a true
delight. The actor first staked out this character as the
Elvis-worshipping Mr.  Rabbitte, the father in The Commitments.  His
wide, earnest face is a perfect background for the train wreck of
emotions any father would feel at the notion, the very idea, of
grandfatherhood at such a young and, he might add, virile age.</P>
<P>     Yet THE SNAPPER is as much about modern-day Dubliners and the joys
and sorrows of a large family, as it is about the bond between a father
and his daughter--a relationship rarely explored on screen.</P>
<P>     THE SNAPPER is easily this holiday season's charmer.  I swear.  On
the Boible.</P>
