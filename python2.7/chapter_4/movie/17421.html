<PRE>THE KING OF MASKS</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.

<P>   Some movies are tearjerkers of the worst sort.  "Message
in a Bottle" is perhaps the most recent example.  Others are
heartbreaking.  "The King of Masks" is an excellent example
of this latter category.  Photographed to resemble a
landscape painting in a Chinese village meant to be part of
that vast country's Sichuan province, director Wu Tianming's
uplifting drama of love shared by two outsiders brings
to mind the affection between the aging Dora and the
orphaned Josue in Walter Salles' Brazilian triumph, "Central
Station."  </P>
<P>   The narrative takes place in the 1930s, during a particularly
bleak period of Chinese history; its people ravaged by civil
conflict among warlords, incursions by Japan, a rising
Communist movement, and natural disasters like floods and
droughts.  As captured skillfully by photographer Mu Dayuan,
scenes render pathetic attempts by poverty-stricken citizens
to sell, even give away their children, whom they are no
longer able to feed.  Male youngsters fare a little better than
girls, often able to secure $2 or $3 for their impoverished
fathers and mothers, while the fair sex--considered next to
worthless in the patriarchal society of its time--are simply
given away to anyone with compassion or the wish to put
them to work as cooks, perhaps even hookers.    </P>
<P>   Wei Minglung's screenplay centers on two desperate
people: a lonely old man who ekes our a meager living by
changing faces, i.e. by managing through sleight of hand to
shed and change up to 14 facial masks in a matter of
seconds--so quickly that the gathering crowds have no idea
how the magic is performed.  Since an old tradition requires
such people to pass on their secrets to male heirs, the titled
king of masks, Bian Lian Wang (Zhu Xu), is despondent: he
is alone and lacks the necessary beneficiary.  His spirits are
raised when the cast-off eight-year-old Doggie (Zhou Ren-
Ying) attaches herself to him, but Doggie--who has concealed
her gender behind a short haircut--is discovered when asked
to urinate into a cloth which is to be used as a poultice.</P>
<P>   "The King of Masks" follows the duo, who have by now
bonded, as they make the rounds of the village.  While Bian,
who is known only as "grandpa" or "boss" by his young
sidekick, fascinates the crowds, young Doggie assists by
announcing each act and, what is more important, serves as
the companion so needed by her adopted grandpa.  When a
series of misfortunes occurs, obliging the king of masks to
throw the young girl out of the boat which they call their
home, Doggie is ultimately called upon to save her
grandfather's life from execution by the authorities--who have
accused the old man of kidnapping.</P>
<P>   The chief virtue of the film is its realistic portrayal of the
growing attachment between two of society's outcasts. 
Avoiding sloppy sentimentality by presenting a vivid,
believable, thoroughly heartfelt drama of unsullied affection
between dependent girl and despondent magician, "The King
of Masks" headlines an astonishing performance by young
Zhou Ren-Ying.  Zhou is anything but robotic.  Mature well
beyond her years (in part, the press notes tell us, because
she had to make her own way early on), Zhou was picked for
the role because of her experience in show business, having
performed from the age of three with an acrobatic troupe in
the city of Xian.  Not only does Zhou shatter our hearts with
her soulful discharge of the role: she does her own stunts.  In
one particular feat she hangs on a steel cable from a twenty-
meter high rooftop, to which she has repaired to get a
government official's attention.  </P>
<P>  In telling the story, director Wu educates film-goers on the
conventions of Chinese opera.  He cuts several times to
performances of a troupe led by the revered diva, Liang Sao
Lang (Zhao Zhigang), leaving us with the impression that this
Chinese art form shares protocol with Greek and Japanese
theater.  Liang, in the role of a man who regularly plays a
female character, shows his audience in the movie seats that
Chinese opera is anything but the bizarre exhibition that
Westerners take it to be.  By the conclusion of this soulful
drama, we are reminded even of King Lear by this king of
masks: a man who for a time discards the daughter who
loves him the most, ultimately redeemed by an insight he
acquires altogether late in the game.  </P>
<P>   Fortunately for Wu--and for the Chinese people
themselves--subjects which would have been taboo under the
Communist regime before 1980 (such as Buddhism) are now
acceptable in a country that has opened its gates even to
controversial American entries.  To no one's surprise, "The
King of Masks" has acquired top awards in festivals around
the world, from Istanbul to Moscow to China itself.  The film is
in Mandarin with English subtitles.</P>
