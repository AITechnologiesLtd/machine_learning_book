<P>   Centering on a group of feisty women yet too arty to be
called a chick flick, with its subjects too old to designate this
a date movie, "Tea With Mussolini" is an opulent production
that typifies its director's craftsmanship. This sentimental and
autobiographical work features frequently witty dialogue and
superb acting by a team of true professionals with solid
insight into the minds of people so set in their ways that they
refuse to recognize the realities of the political turmoil
encircling them.  "Tea With Mussolini" is a filmed version of
the first three chapters of film director Franco Zeffirelli's
autobiography, adapted for the screen by scripter John
Mortimer--whose expertise about Italy during the 1930's
serves the project well.  We come away from the picture with
a better understanding of how childhood influences affect a
director's output.  Zeffirelli's entire yield--his lush, innovative
filmed versions of such Shakespearean plays as "Romeo and
Juliet, "The Taming of the Shrew," "Hamlet" and "Othello"--
might not have been possible had not a group of women
known as the Scorpioni (for the their biting wit) stamped their
influence on him early on.  Making bold use of his
imagination--particularly in casting two outrageously
handsome young men as his youthful stand-ins and in
implying that he was a member of the Italian resistance
against the German occupation force--Zeffirelli paints an
ambivalent portrait of a circle of English and American
women who arrogantly stand up to Italians with whom their
countries are at war.  Refusing to heed warnings to go home
before war is declared, they emerge a few years older but
none the wiser for their troubles.</P>
<P>   The women, eccentrically diverse, form a community in the
Florence of the 1930's, and include the group's doyenne,
Lady Hester (Maggie Smith), the widow of the British
ambassador to Italy; Arabella Delancey (Judi Dench), who
copies frescoes in the Uffizi Gallery and is followed
everywhere by her beloved dog; Mary Wallace (Joan
Plowright), who does secretarial work for the clothing
manufacturer who has fathered a boy, Luca, out of the
wedlock; the stunning and fabulously rich American Elsa
Morganthall (Cher), who is in Florence to collect modern art;
and Georgie (Lily Tomlin), who is in Italy on a dig and is an
out-of-closet lesbian decades before this was fashionable.</P>
<P>   The film opens in 1935 as war clouds hover over Europe
and ends with the liberation of Florence from German
occupiers by Scottish troops.  Loosely plotted, the story
begins in the office of a clothing manufacturer who refuses to
take responsibility for Luca (Charlie Lucas), his out-of-
wedlock son who is cared for by the industrialist's secretary
and translator, Mary (Joan Plowright).  Through Mary, who at
one point builds a miniature set with puppets representing
Romeo and Juliet, Luca gains a thorough appreciation for
Shakespeare.  Lady Hester (Maggie Smith), the de facto
center of the group of English expatriate women, is confident
that she and her circle would always be safe in Italy, because
she had been invited to tea with Mussolini, who promised that
no harm would ever come to her and her friends.  In a
surprisingly low-key and often weepy role, Judi Dench plays
the part of a mediocre painter of frescoes while the most
flamboyant presence is Cher, who performs in the role of
Esta, a boorish American yet benevolent art collector who
believes she is entitled by her affluence to possess a
particular painting of Picasso.  Esta's gaudy presence serves
as a catalyst for some of the movie's wittiest lines, as Lady
Hester, noting the sky-high concoction of desert that she
purchases for Luca, remarks "The Americans even vulgarize
ice cream."  </P>
<P>   When Italy opportunistically declares war against France
and England in June 1940, the women are rounded up and
herded into a one-room hovel, but Elsa secretly pays the bills
at a nearby hotel, enabling the circle to live as though the
war does not exist.  The entire story of these "biddies" comes
to us through the eyes of Luca (Baird Wallace as the Zeffirelli
stand-in at age 17), a mature young man who has come to
love the women who have befriended him and in a couple of
instances secretly delivers passport to the hands of those
who desperately need to get out of Italy.  </P>
<P>   "Tea with Mussolini" is exquisitely filmed by David Watkin--
whose previous work includes cinematography for "Out of
Africa."  Sites include Florence, Rome and the medieval town
of San Gimignano--which retains the ambiance of 14th
century Italy.  Perhaps the most positive feature of the epic
work is the insight we are given into the psyche of its
director, while at the same time we bear witness to
performances by some of the great actresses of our
generation.  The principal flaw is the overly sentimental
treatment Zeffirelli furnishes of the Italian fascisti--who treat
the "enemy" women with deference, even fearing their sharp
retorts and condemnations. Even the German occupiers are
soft-pedaled.  As the subjugating troops retreat from Florence
and prepare to blow up a historic tower, the women chain
themselves to the wall, forcing the Germans to back way and
decline the planned destruction.  After all, though, most of us
look back to our childhoods remembering the good times and
censoring the adverse.  Franco Zeffirelli shows us a good
time indeed.</P>
