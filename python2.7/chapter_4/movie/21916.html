<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>There are a lot of devil worshippers in New York.  These Satan servants
are everywhere; I'm talking about the psychiatrists, cops, nurses and
hobos.  They're all here to revere Gabriel Byrne in a role Al Pacino
was born to play.  Welcome to Schwarzenegger's long anticipated return
to celluloid, "End of Days."   It's also Arnold's first foray
into "drama" as he plays a suicidal alcoholic bodyguard who's here to
save us all from the devil himself.</P>
<P>In a nutshell, End of Days' plot is simply this: Satan needs to find
the girl he marked as his mate twenty years ago and impregnate her with
the Anti-Christ between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM, Eastern Standard Time on
December 31, 1999 to initiate the "End of Days."  Only Jericho Cane (Ah-
nuld) can save the world from Lucifer and his flammable urine.  How
will he kill Mephistopheles when he has only ten seconds to nail Robin
Tunney?  Only if you're willing to part with your hard-earned cash will
you find out and I seriously recommend that you don't.</P>
<P>Now some of you may be asking yourselves, "What the hell is Gabriel
doing back in another pisspoor religious movie?"  You'd think after
Stigmata he'd learn to pick better scripts.  Byrne just doesn't have
the intensity to pull this role off.  Pacino had it and used it well in
the guilty pleasure "The Devil's Advocate."  Playing a heavy like the
Prince of Darkness ain't easy, so why didn't casting director Jackie
Burch put as much time into "End of Days" as he did "Lost & Found," "I
Still Know..." and "Judge Dredd?"</P>
<P>Every action film these days requires a sidekick, so why should a
cliché-layered film like this be any different?  They have Kevin
Pollack spewing cheesy one-liners from the "Die Hard" trilogy's cutting
room floor, and according to the audience I was with, they're
hilarious.  I mean come on, lines like those are golden!  In the stark
reality of the world Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack haven't done
anything respectable besides "The Usual Suspects."  That is the only
one good film they starred in, everything on their resumes preceding
and following it are comatose.</P>
<P>It's important to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger's big performance.  Let
me tell you, this guy never has been able to act, he's not acting
in "End of Days" and I truly doubt he'll ever have any talent in
acting.  Maybe, it's in the accent, you know, Arnold's voice just
doesn't seem capable of tugging at my emotions.  He just doesn't have
the skill to do anything properly in a dramatic fashion.  All he can do
is look the role, but looking it just isn't enough nowadays.  There's a
scene in the film where Schwarzenegger's getting his ass whooped by
Miriam Margolyes in an inconceivably hilarious approach that makes me
question whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting a little weak
around the edges or he just thinks getting a beatdown from a 58 year
old is hilarious.</P>
<P>And of course, let's not forget Peter Hyams, the "acclaimed" director
of "Timecop," "Sudden Death" and "The Relic" doing a pretty sloppy job
of helming this film.  If I were the exec at Universal, I would've
really pushed Sam Raimi to direct this.  In a year of groundbreaking
special effects fests like "Star Wars" and "The Matrix, "Days" looks
incredibly lame.   Those looking to see another Jar Jar Binks
or  "bullet time" will be disappointed.  The $100 million budget used
here was spent on the same old fireballs and explosions we've seen
several times before, directed by a hack with no sense of style or
artistic ability.</P>
<P>"End of Days" is nothing but another scab on everyone involved's
already wounded careers.</P>
