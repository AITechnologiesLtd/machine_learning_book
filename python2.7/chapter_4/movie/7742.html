<PRE>                                  THE ROCK
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1996, R, 136 minutes [2 hours, 16 minutes]
[action]
starring: Nicholas Cage (Dr. Stanley Goodspeed), Sean Connery (John Patrick
Mason), Ed Harris (General Frank X. Hummel), John Spencer (FBI Director
Womack), produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Don Simpson, written by David
Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, Mark Rosner, directed by Michael Bay.</P>
<P>I had a difficult time trying to finalize my verdict of "The Rock." It's
completely over-the-top, but it knows this and makes no apologies. At times,
it shows signs of originality, but sometimes it seems like another exhausting
rip-off of a Schwarzenegger flick. I enjoyed it simply for the ride, but at
the same time I couldn't help being cynical.</P>
<P>The film uses all the standard elements for action thrillers involving the
government and terrorists: new weapons, government conspiracies, and a
futuristic, high-tech mood. A ballistic U.S. General, Frank X. Hummel
(Harris), has formed a militia of his friends and fellow Marines. His goal is
to compensate the families of soldiers who were killed during secret
government operatives. His team storms Alcatraz Island, holds 81 tourists
hostage, and threatens to use a powerful chemical weapon against the city of
San Francisco if he, his team, and the unhonored dead soldiers' families are
not paid millions of dollars.</P>
<P>Had the film's biggest flaw not been so obvious, perhaps the countless
other, smaller ones wouldn't have been as noticeable. Why would General
Hummel resort to terrorism to extort money? In this age of technology and
information (especially in the movies), wouldn't it be easier to steal money
through computers? But then again, this is a matter of war-related honor, and
no one can be more stern than insane militias with powerful weapons.</P>
<P>It's obvious someone is going to have to go in and stop Hummel, and the
modern action movie needs an odd couple to make for characterization and
comic relief. This is provided with the characters John Patrick Mason
(Connery) and Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Cage). Mason is the only person to ever
have escaped Alcatraz, so the government needs his help to break in.
Goodspeed is an FBI scientist who is experienced with the chemical weapons
Hummel is armed with. Connery and Cage have some chemistry, with Cage as the
so-called common man and Connery as an even older Schwarzenegger or
Stallone-type character. Of course they constantly argue and threaten each
other, but always save the other's life when minutes before they would have
killed them.</P>
<P>But this is not a film about dialogue or characterization. It's an action
movie, and there is action here, lots of it. There are car chases that have
almost nothing to do with the plot; scenes in rooms full of gears, steam, and
fire that don't do anything other than pose a threat to the heroes. There's
lots of shootouts, fist fights, knife fights, people dangling from ledges, a
long-lost daughter, a pregnant fiancee... but mostly there's just shootouts
and fist fights. Not to mention the super suspenseful scenes where if the
character twitches, all are dead.</P>
<P>Despite all these gratuitous elements, I never found myself feeling bored.
At times I was a bit worn out by the action and the constant dragging and
milking of the story, but never bored. The stunts and special effects are
fantastic, but not necessarily impressive. For the most part, the dialogue
and storytelling style are easy to swallow, although sometimes it becomes so
trendy (a la Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron) it's distracting.</P>
<P>It's obvious "The Rock" doesn't want to be taken seriously, and for that
it's enjoyable. Then again, it's not as lighthearted as it should have been,
and thus it's difficult to appreciate it as quick fun. </P>
