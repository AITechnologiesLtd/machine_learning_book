<PRE>DARK CITY</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: **1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>New Line / 1:43 / 1998 / R (violence, language, nudity, muted sex)
Cast: Rufus Sewell; Kiefer Sutherland; Jennifer Connelly; William Hurt; 
Richard O'Brien; Ian Richardson; Colin Friels; Mitchell Butel 
Director: Alex Proyas 
Screenplay: Lem Dobbs; David S. Goyer; Alex Proyas </P>
<P>What's worse: a movie that glows with unfulfilled promise, or one that 
shows no promise at all? Alex Proyas' "Dark City" falls into the former 
category without a doubt, and it's a shortcoming that should leave its 
viewers with quite a bad aftertaste. But the operative word here is 
"should," especially seeing as how "Dark City" is one of those cinematic 
experiences that sticks with and grows on you. It's still a wildly uneven 
film, full of ham, cheese and more than a few bouts of sporadic silliness, 
but it's got immense style to spare and a screenplay that's quite 
intriguing. I hesitate to call "Dark City" solid, or even really *good,* 
but if ever a two-and-a-half star film bordered so very close to mild 
success, it's this one. </P>
<P>"Dark City" takes place in, well, a dark city -- a swirling vortex of 
menacing ambiance, kind of like a sinister New York with all of the lights 
turned out. The residents of this place appear to be unaware that it always 
seems to be nighttime, and they move about their surroundings in an oddly 
detached way. Also adding to the province's sky-high weird quotient is an 
underworld group of beings known only as the Strangers. The Strangers are 
death-pale, capable of flying and possess a strange psychic power called 
Tuning -- they can alter physical environment just by focusing on any given 
object or location. </P>
<P>One random night, a man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a seedy motel 
bathtub and finds a prostitute stabbed to death in the adjoining bedroom. 
He has no idea who he is, how he got there or what exactly is going on, so 
he flees the scene promptly. The man -- who later learns his name is John 
Murdoch and that he's married to an estranged nightclub singer (Jennifer 
Connelly) -- is put at the top of a wanted list by a determined detective 
(William Hurt). While on the run and trying to uncover answers about his 
seemingly altered state, he discovers that he's a master of Tuning as well, 
and is also targeted by the Strangers and their human lackey (Kiefer 
Sutherland) who likely see Murdoch as a kink in their shady plans. </P>
<P>"Dark City" doesn't quite get off to a stable start, as it takes some time 
to adjust to the prattling manner in which Proyas introduces his cast of 
warped characters. The funky narrative eventually draws you in; while 
you're waiting, pay attention to the movie's dazzling visual flair, which 
emanates both film noir and science-fiction sensibilities. "Dark City" 
looks fantastic thanks to behind-the-scenes work from production designers 
George Liddle and Patrick Tatopoulos and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski; 
these Oscar-worthy attributes hold up even when the movie degenerates into 
all-out craziness towards its end, as Murdoch battles a plethora of enemies 
that look like they just walked off of the "Hellraiser" set. </P>
<P>The assembled cast is curious, to say the very least. Sewell (most widely 
seen in "Cold Comfort Farm") fares best in the lead, creating a protagonist 
who's engaging and likeable. You root for him, even though at times you're 
not quite sure what you're rooting for him to do. Luscious bombshell 
Connelly ("Inventing the Abbotts") isn't given much to do, but looks so 
very fine in her pseudo-period duds. While Sutherland overacts with halting 
speech enunciation, Hurt counteracts by deadpanning a little too dull -- 
these guys are interesting, but not very well played out. And as one of the 
more prominent Strangers, Richard O'Brien seems to have found another role 
destined for instant cult success; he played Riff-Raff in 1973's "The Rocky 
Horror Picture Show." </P>
<P>The middle segments of "Dark City" work fantastically, overcoming some 
opening and closing missteps. For the most part, the film marks a more 
mature, assured effort from Proyas, whose 1994 hit "The Crow" was a 
one-note revenge thriller that captured Brandon Lee's soulful swan song. 
There are some great ideas at work here (for instance, a series of final 
denouements that are actually quite engrossing in their explanation), but 
they're executed in a movie that sometimes just doesn't click. Is "Dark 
City" a great film? No. But does it attempt to be something more than comic 
book-eye candy? Yes, and it almost works. </P>
