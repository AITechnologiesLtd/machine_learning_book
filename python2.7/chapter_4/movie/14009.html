<PRE>The Avengers
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items
begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years
after the item was made. That's when the kids of that time have jobs,
disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood
that has disappeared from their lives. Check out the prices of toys from the
late sixties and you'll find that <I>Yogi Bear<I> lunch boxes are demanding
big bucks.</P>
<P>There's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies
and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen. Boomers are now mostly
in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long
time. They'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of
yore. Hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them.
Directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time.</P>
<P>And for the most part they're messing it up.</P>
<P>"Mission Impossible", "Lost In Space", "Godzilla", "Zorro". None of these
successfully capture the originals. None of these are even good films. You can
now add "The Avengers" to the list.</P>
<P>The British television series began in 1961. Super secret agent John Steed
(then-Patrick Macnee) and his third partner, Emma Peel (then-Diana Rigg) are
the pair that the American audience fell for. Surrealistic and witty, the
series fit the mood of the times. The leather-clad Rigg probably didn't hurt
the ratings either. After all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce
her character's name without "appeal".</P>
<P>Now we're in the nineties. Steed (now-Ralph Fiennes) and Peel (now-Uma
Thurman) are battling evil genius Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery) who is
screwing with England's weather.</P>
<P>That's about as much of a plot as we have. There's some footage about a lot
of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense. We get
betrayal for some unknown reason. Evil clones appear and vanish and have no
connection to the film. Remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with
machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason. There's a
high tech hot air balloon, but I have no idea why anyone's in it.</P>
<P>The spy agency is run by a man called "Mother" who is in a wheelchair and a
woman named "Father" who is blind...at least in some scenes. There's probably
a reason for all of this, but we'll never know it.</P>
<P>Macnee makes an appearance of sorts. He is the voice for an invisible man
whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing.</P>
<P>A group of villains sits around a table, all clad in huge pastel-colored
teddy bear outfits. At first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around,
but then it becomes goofy.</P>
<P>The movie is a medley of clutter, confusion and wrong decisions around every corner.</P>
<P>It feels like major portions of the film are missing. The storyline jumps
rather than flows. Reportedly the film was re-cut several times. This is one
of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially
since some of the parts appear to be missing.</P>
<P>There's one good point where Peel is running from one room to another in a
house designed by Escher. Other than that, the effects are second-rate. The
weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes.</P>
<P>Thurman almost makes an adequate Emma Peel but it doesn't work. She looks
good, dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark. Fiennes
fares even less well. Macnee's Steed was a witty man of the world with a sense
of humor. Fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who
has never been out of his home town. Even Connery, one of the greatest living
actors, doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes.</P>
<P>The action scenes are difficult to follow. Director Jeremiah Chechik
(responsible for the atrocious remake of "Diabolique") somehow manages to put
the camera exactly where it shouldn't be. Things happen, people move around,
but even if, with the utmost effort, you were able to care about any of it,
the scenes are bewildering.</P>
<P>The primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads.
Witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination.
Admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film, but there's no
chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever. One of Emma Peel's first
lines of dialog is "Rules are made to be broken." It doesn't get any better.</P>
<P>Advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone. The release
date was changed several times. Connery refuses to promote the film. There was
no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for Warner
Brothers. At least this way, they get something of an audience for the first
weekend before the news gets out.</P>
<P>Admittedly I haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of
decades. My guess is that it would be severely dated now. No matter how
antiquated it might be, there's no doubt that it holds up better than this
film is at first viewing.</P>
<P>There's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside
watching this movie. No reason at all.</P>
