<P>     AMISTAD is a bit of a sit.  Seemingly shooting for another SCHIN-
DLER'S, Steven Spielberg only halfway hits the mark with this fascinat-
ing but emotionally under-involving 19th Century history lesson.  He
nails the slave ship sequences, to be sure-- they're as riveting as
anything you'll see this season.  Too bad they occupy no more than 20 or
30 minutes of screen time, tops.  The rest is talky courtroom stuff,
with a bit of punchy humor, here and there, in each culture's reaction
to the other.  (Particularly choice is the African take on Christian-
ity.)  The period detail is excellent and the actors are quite good,
even if the cast is populated by a few too many familiar faces.  (Look,
there's Stellan Skarsgard from GOOD WILL HUNTING!  Look, there's Daniel
von Bargen from THE POSTMAN!)  Most jarring is John William's score,
which intrudes to the point of embarrassment.  (The "give us free" mo-
ment is particularly painful.)  Schmaltz has its place in many Spielberg
movies, but not this one.  With Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey,
Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, David Paymer, Pete Postlethwaite, and
in a small but critical role, Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams.</P>
