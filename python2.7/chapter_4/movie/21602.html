<P>"Farmers are stingy, foxy, blubbering, mean, stupid and
murderous! God damn! That's what they are! But then, who made
them such beasts? You did! You samurai did it! You burn their
villages!  Destroy their farms! Steal their food! Force them to
labor! Take their women! And kill them if they resist! So what
should farmers do?" --Kikuchiyo, Seven Samurai</P>
<P>Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is perhaps the closest any
director has come to a true cinematic study of social class.
Much of the film's genius revolves around moments of humanity
hidden where we least expect them--in the merry laughter of
peasants, sharing a joke only minutes before the start of the
battle which could destroy them; in the tears shed by a brash
warrior when confronted with reminders of the past; in a young
man's scream of remorse as he is forced to kill for the first
time. More than anything, Seven Samurai is an epic behavioral
study, and it's this attention to detail which elevates the
work from a standard Japanese 'jidai-geki' (samurai picture) to
a masterpiece.</P>
<P>Sure, there's also a great story contained herein, but that
alone can't account for the film's enduring appeal and renown.
Seven Samurai is unequivocally regarded not only as Kurosawa's
greatest film, but as the best cinematic work ever to come out
of Japan--no small praise, especially considering the caliber
of the director's other achievements. There's more going on
here than skillful story construction: the events resonate with
a degree of sincerity rarely found in modern cinema. It's easy
to love these people, because they seem real--they're neither
action heroes nor cardboard stereotypes.</P>
<P>The story: A small village finds itself annually raided by an
army of bandits, who steal the meager crops harvested by the
peasants. Tired of relinquishing their food supply but woefully
inept in combat skills, the villagers decide to hire a band of
samurai to protect them. It won't be easy, however: the
villagers have nothing to offer their would-be saviors except a
few handfuls of stale rice. The advice of the town elder? "Find
hungry samurai."</P>
<P>Eventually six warriors are recruited. The regal Kambei
(Takashi Shimura) accepts their offer because he believes it's
the morally correct thing to do. Katsushiro (Ko Kimura) is a
young, inexperienced 'ronin' (masterless samurai) who comes
along for a taste of adventure. Schichiroji (Daisuke Kato), an
old friend of Kambei, also offers his assistance, as does
master swordsman Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), and two additional
samurai, Gorobei (Yoshiro Inaba) and Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki).
Trailing after the band of warriors is the brash Kikuchiyo
(legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune), the son of a farmer,
who wishes to be admitted into the warriors' ranks.</P>
