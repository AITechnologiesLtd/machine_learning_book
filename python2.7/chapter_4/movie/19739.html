<P>IN SHORT: Arthouse connoisseurs only</P>
<P>Original title The Powder Keg, which is a name Kevin Costner has grabbed
for a flick in development. Thus, the name change.</P>
<P>The Website says: Over the course of one evening various interlinked
stories unravel; A boxer discovers the extent to which his life has been
a facade and fights his best friend in an act of desperate retaliation;
A former Sarajevo professor is too proud to work for the new refugee
mobsters dealing in gas, cigarettes, and other contraband, opting
instead to drive a bus; A young woman, harassed during a bus hijacking,
ends up safely in the arms of her boyfriend only to find that their
lovers quarrel places them in an absurdly dangerous situation. In his
focus on the lives of ordinary people living in the dawn of an awakening
political consciousness, Belgrade-born Paskaljevic masterfully balances
dark comedy with heightened realism, creating a compelling exploration
of the human spirit.</P>
<P>Cranky sat through Cabaret Balkan watching the dehumanizing portraits of
lives in a country on the brink of war thinking, were we bombing the
wrong side? As the various stories play out, there are a couple of none
too subtle remarks about racial or religious background which to
American eyes meant very little. All them Balkanites/ Yugoslavs/
Macedonians look pretty much the same. Nor do the male of the species
come off as particularly enlightened.</P>
<P>Lessee what we've got here. There are a pair of middle aged best friend
boxing and drinking partners, one of whom has admitted to an
indiscretion with the other's long forgotten girlfriend whom he had
promised to watch over. The other "friend" then proceeds to reveal a 20
years long systematic emasculation of his buddy. One smashed beer bottle
in the gut later, the survivor heads off in a drunken haze, boarding a
train with no destination in mind. But there's a blonde on the train
that gets the attention of his stunted little willie and while she
attempts to defend herself from the coming rape, her weapon of choice, a
grenade, works against her. Meanwhile, in a hijacked bus across town,
tough guy with a knife is sexually terrorizing the hostage passengers.
One poor woman, whose legs are spread and stroked by said blade will get
away and call her boyfriend to come get her. The lout who is her
protector automatically assumes that it is the woman's fault that she
was attacked; that she may have derived pleasure of some sort from the
attack and so has emasculated him. Like I wrote, a very enlightened male
populace. The stories get even more unpleasant, culminating in a
lynching and a string of car explosions symbolizing the "powder keg"
that is modern Yugoslavia pushing civilized behavior beyond the boiling
point to utter depravity.</P>
<P>OK film students and arthouse cineastes, this is the kind of stuff you
maintain you like. If it turns your stomachs and makes you ashamed to be
part of the greater human race, then it must be good film and everyone
should see it.</P>
<PRE>Oh Get Real</PRE>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Cabaret Balkan, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$1.00</PRE>
<P>I save the zero for total drek. Cabaret Balkan wasn't drek, though it is
not to my taste. Thoroughly unpleasant and not recommended to anyone
outside of the film student arthouse circuit.</P>
