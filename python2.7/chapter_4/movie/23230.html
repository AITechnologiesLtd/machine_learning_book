Martin Garralaga, et al. An MGM film</P>
<P>For many years, Robert Taylor  (1911-1969) was one of the top stars 
at MGM. He was internationally thought to be the handsomest actor in 
Hollywood. He did deserve to be called "the man with the perfect 
profile," and while not a performer of AAA caliber, he was very good.</P>
<P>Beginning in 1934 (at age 23) he was in a quick succession of movies. 
As the lead in the musical "Broadway Melody of 1936" (1935).he was 
popular, but it is with "Magnificent Obsession" (1935) that he became 
a star. Other films confirmed his status: "The Gorgeous Hussy" (1936) 
and above the super-romantic "Camille" (1937) where as Armand Duval 
he was cast opposite Greta Garbo. Other successes followed, 
culminating again with the World War I sad romance "Waterloo Bridge" 
(1940), with Viven Leigh. In subsequent movies -- in many genres -- 
his  stature remained high, even though few of the pictures were 
truly superior. Some were indifferent. Some were stinkers.</P>
<P>"The Bribe" is in that last category. Still young at 39, Taylor looks 
good -- and that's all one can say about the film, which opens with 
one of the most-used clichés of film noir: the first-person narration 
that leads to a long flashback.</P>
<P>Taylor, named just Rigby, is a Federal agent. His superior calls him 
in. Taylor arrives wearing impeccable, expensive clothes of the kind 
that one mostly sees today (A.D. 2000) on TV network news hosts. 
Egged on by the movie's title, one might suspect that he has been 
taking bribes, but then his boss too is snappily dressed. Perhaps 
some research into Government employees in 1949 is in order.</P>
<P>Rigby is assigned an undercover job in Carlotta, a tropical island in 
Central America. Some clever racketeers purchase in the USA war 
surplus equipment as junk, but secretly too ship to Carlotta valuable 
airplane engines. The operations nets them millions, on which they 
pay no taxes to the US. Government.  Since Carlotta is not a tourist 
place except for deep-sea fishing, Rigby will pose as a dedicated 
amateur fisherman.</P>
<P>The island is transparently one of those formulaic, generic and 
unconvincing studio sets. As usual, the central meeting place for 
locals and foreigners is an hotel with a restaurant, bar and music.</P>
<P>Too many of the clients are wearing (or holding) jackets in 
Carlotta's sweltering weather. It adds another phony note yet. And, 
of course, there is the "de rigueur" beautiful American torch singer 
who is stranded there. In this case she is Ava Gardner, who has an 
American husband, former wartime, then civilian airplane pilot John 
Hodiak. A basket case of disillusionment, he works as barman and is 
habitually in his cups. (Why do they keep him?) The cast is rounded 
out by a peculiar Charles Laughton with hurting feet, and the 
predictably villainous Vincent Price.</P>
<P>Adding to lack of genuineness is the hotel's band of  Central 
American musicians who accompany Ava's singing. But you can sense 
immediately that the music is mostly provided by a large-ish, unseen 
studio orchestra.</P>
<P>Predictably Taylor and Gardner will fall for each other. What follows 
will not be told here except that it lacks shape, suspense, true 
romance, and any sort of interest. Neither Taylor nor Ava are 
convincing in their roles.  What could be noted is that from the 
start of the film there is an enormous amount of smoking by all, even 
by the 1940s standards. If Taylor did this in real life it  is no 
wonder he died of lung cancer.</P>
<P>Ava Gardner's performance is a mediocre as everyone else's. Her 
singing is indifferent. The song she does is by composer Nacio
(for " Ignacio") Herb Brown who contributed splendidly to many a 
film, and whose last picture was no other than "Singin' in the Rain." 
You wouldn't suspect this from the dullness of his song here. Nor 
does the score by another great talent, Miklos Rozsa, make a dent.</P>
<P>How the mighty can fall, at times!   (Edwin Jahiel)</P>
