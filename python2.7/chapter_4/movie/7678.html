<P>     MRS. BROWN is a love story much in the same vein as CARRINGTON in 
that it deals with platonic affection that runs deeper and truer than 
that of the motion picture staple romantic variety.  These days, it 
seems that whenever we see a male/female friendship on screen, it's just 
a setup for the inevitable moment when the two realize that they're 
fated to be lovers.  Not so with MRS. BROWN, one of the most emotionally 
sensitive and intelligent love stories of the year.  It shows, amongst 
other things, that it's possible to love completely and with unflagging 
devotion without sex ever becoming an issue.  </P>
<P>     Queen Victoria was born on May 24, 1819 and died nearly eighty-two 
years later, in the first month of 1901.  Her reign as England's 
monarch, which began in 1837, lasted more than six decades and left such 
an indelible impression upon the country that, upon hearing of her 
death, author Henry James wrote, "We all feel a bit motherless today."  
MRS. BROWN, which is based on actual events and uses historical figures, 
transpires during one of the darkest periods of Victoria's reign -- a 
four year segment from 1864 to 1868 (with a brief epilogue in 1883).  
Still mourning the death of her beloved husband, Prince Albert, who died 
over two years earlier, the Queen (Judi Dench) is in virtual seclusion 
at Windsor.  She sees no one outside of her servants and her immediate 
family, rarely goes out, and has no taste for politics.  In the words of 
her loyal secretary, Henry Posonby (Geoffrey Palmer), they are all 
"prisoners of the queen's grief," which he describes variously as 
"ferocious introspection" and "unfettered morbidity."  So, in an attempt 
to revive Victoria, Posonby summons John Brown (Billy Connolly), the 
highlander who runs the queen's Scottish retreat of Balmoral, to 
Windsor.  It's Posonby's hope that Brown will "appeal to the queen's 
sentimental belief that all highlanders are good for the health."</P>
<P>     Brown arrives and proves to be a breath of fresh air.  Before he 
enters Windsor, the castle is a place of icy silence and solitude.  
Director John Madden so effectively conveys this atmosphere that we 
become keenly aware of such things as a ticking clock and a cleared 
throat.  Brown's attitude of speaking what he thinks, regardless of the 
consequences, horrifies the servants and family.  But, after initially 
being annoyed, Victoria warms to his methods, and it isn't long before 
the two develop a unshakable friendship.  They become so close, in fact, 
that wags begin calling the Queen "Mrs. Brown."  The Prince of Wales, 
wary of Brown's growing influence over his mother, seeks to have the 
highlander sent back to Scotland.  And the Prime Minister, Disraeli, 
wonders whether Brown is more likely to be a valuable ally or a 
dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>     Like 1995's THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, MRS. BROWN mixes the 
political machinations of various MPs with the growing fissure between 
the monarch and the Prince of Wales.  However, while George may have 
been mad, Victoria is merely eccentric.  Nevertheless, her extended 
period of mourning, during which she has been out of the public's sight, 
has created a great deal of uncertainty among her subjects, and 
Parliament is beginning to discuss the possibility of disestablishing 
the monarchy -- a prospect that horrifies Disraeli and Prince Edward.</P>
<P>     Brown and Victoria's relationship develops and deepens slowly and 
naturally, and credit must be given to both of the lead actors, Judi 
Dench ("M" from GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES) and Billy Connolly 
(Howard Hessman's replacement in the TV series HEAD OF THE CLASS), for 
their extraordinary performances.  Both actors immerse themselves in 
their roles, playing Brown and the Queen without a hint of artifice, and 
the chemistry between them is palpable.  Theirs is a wonderfully real 
relationship that is reminiscent of the one between Lytton Strachey and 
the title character of CARRINGTON.  (Ironically, Strachey is most famous 
for his 1921 biography of Queen Victoria.)</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best thing of all about MRS. BROWN is that it doesn't 
offer any hokey, Hollywood-type moments.  The picture remains true to 
itself throughout, affirming that film maker John Madden (ETHAN FROME) 
has a keen insight into the human psyche.  MRS. BROWN is a fascinating 
character study, a wonderful love story, and a brilliant period piece 
(MASTERPIECE THEATER and the BBC, both renowned for their costume 
dramas, are listed as co-producers).  In a summer that is sure to be 
glutted with formulaic action thrillers and flat romantic comedies, MRS. 
BROWN will delight and touch any viewer who seeks it out.</P>
