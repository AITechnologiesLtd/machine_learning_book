<P>   When people lie, cheat, steal, even kill, they will either deny
that they committed these transgressions or will make
excuses for the iniquities.  Some people are psychotic and
are able to do dastardly deeds without feeling a twinge of
guilt.  Most of us, though, are made cowards by our
conscience.  If the society does not catch up with us, we
punish outselves, unable even to look ourselves in the mirror. 
How do we protect ourselves from these unfortunate feelings? 
We rationalize.  We do what we can to justify our bad conduct
to ourselves and to others.  "Return to Paradise" is the story
of two young men--regular, fun guys--who must make a moral
choice.  Do they surrender three, maybe six years of their
youth in order to save the life of a friend?  Or do they turn
their backs on him and spend that time enjoying their careers,
their girls friends, their comfortable lives in America--perhaps
unable for the rest of their lives to face themselves?</P>
<P>   To get a broader picture of the dilemma, take a quick look
at one of the great stories penned in the 20th century about
our ability and willingness to rationalize.  In Friedrich
Duerrenmatt's play, "The Visit," an old and very rich woman,
Clara Zachanassian, revists the town of her youth to take
revenge on Anton Schill, who made her pregnant and then
abandoned her.  She offers all the people of this Central
European village a substantial sum of money if they would
surrender to her the life of Anton Schill.  At first
the townspeople consider the notion immoral and
preposterous, but they are inevitably corrupted.  When they
start buying things on credit in anticipation of the money they
will get, they rationalize their pathetic behavior by saying that
Schill deserves his fate.</P>
<P>   Now look at how two men in "Return to Paradise" decide
how to excuse themselves should they turn their backs on
their friend and how, in addition, an appealing woman
vindicates herself for her own frauds and deceptions.  Sheriff
(Vince Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad) and their buddy Lewis
(Joaquin Phoenix) are three happy-go-lucky guys in their
twenties who are enjoying the beaches, waters, vegetation
and women of Malaysia's Penang region.  They smoke
hashish regularly, and, hale fellows that they are, they have a
couple of misadventures.  At one point, they are offered an
aphrodisiac by a fast-talking Malaysian woman which turns
out to be a rhino horn, and they barely escape with their lives
from a small gang of local toughs.  Just after Tony and Sheriff
board a plane to go back to New York, Lewis, who stays
behind to work on a new project, is arrested for possession of
104 grams of hashish.  He is indicted for dealing--although
the weed was strictly for personal use--and under Malaysia's
stric anti-drug laws is sentenced to hang.  That Asian
country's attorney general makes a deal: if Lewis's two friends
return to Malaysia to take responsibility for their part in the
ownership of hashish, Lewis's life would be spared, though
Tony and Sheriff would have to spend three years in jail.  If
only one of the two friends returns, Lewis's life would still be
spared but the buddy would have to spend six years in jail.  </P>
<P>   "Return to Paradise" is in no way a sterile, academic
exercise in Philosophy 105: Ethics.  Joseph Ruben directs
Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson's screenplay with a tight
hand, keeping the tension on a steady keel and unleashing a
series of clever twists that keep the audience guessing about
Lewis's future.  Reynaldo Villalobos's camerawork delivers the
ambiance of a section of the world that is indeed a tropical
paradise, contrasting the lush vegetation and colorfully
relaxed city atmosphere with the stark, dank span of the local
penitentiary.  </P>
<P>   At first Tony is determined to return to save his friend even
while Lewis is obstinate about keeping his stable, though
dead-end, life in Brooklyn undisturbed.  Their ultimate
decision is inspired by the actions of a woman who represents
herself as Lewis's American lawyer, Beth Eastern (Anne
Heche), who appears willing to do anything to save the
imprisoned man's life.  She must contend with the scheme of
a zealous reporter, M.J. (Jada Pinkett-Smith), who is
determined to break a story about Malaysia's draconian
system of justice--a story which Beth believes would infuriate
the Malaysian society and have an adverse effect on her
client.  She will use money and sexual favors to persuade the
two young men to go back to the Far East to face at least
three years in a prison that would make Attica look like a
country club.  She has no compunctions about lying--insisting
that this third-world dungeon allows residents an ample supply
of rice and is free from the threat of violence by the guards. 
And as she rationalizes her deceitful maneuvers, the young
men do likewise, acquitting themselves of accountability
should they decide to turn their backs on Lewis.</P>
<P>   While "Return to Paradise" headlines several surprises, the
grandest revelation is Anne Heche.  Who would have
imagined her depth, judging by her hack performance in the
lame comedy, "Six Days, Seven Nights" and her waxen-faced,
two-dimensional portrayal in "Wag the Dog"?  It took a drama
of global import and moral gravity to bring out the full range of
her talents, and in this she is well supported by the three
men, especially by the strong appearance of Vince Vaughn as
a posturing Brooklynite whose moral standards get a quick
turnaround from his relationship with a fiercely determined
woman.</P>
<P>   We in the audience cannot help leaving the theater
pondering what we would do in this situation.  And remember
that you'll not know your response unless and until you are
actually faced by the severe predicament.  Unfortunately,
"Return to Paradise" undercuts an otherwise taut picture by a
contrived ending, a conclusion which weakens the entire
ethical temper of the story.  It would be unforgiveable to give
away this resolution--a shocker that would have let the
condemned man's pals off the hook if they chose to remain in
New York. Go back a sec to Duerrenmatt's "The Visit."  In the
play, the townspeople must face their guilt in condemning one
of their own to death.  In a movie version starring Ingrid
Bergman, however, the old woman gives her enemy his
freedom.  That done, couldn't the townspeople have said, "We
knew all along that you would not carry out the death threat. 
That is why we felt free to spend the money we were to
receive from you."  Rationalization is a powerful defense
indeed.</P>
