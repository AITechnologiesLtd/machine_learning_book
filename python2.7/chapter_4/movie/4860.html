<P>     GIRL 6 is the first major motion picture about the phone sex 
industry.  Director Spike Lee (DO THE RIGHT THING, MALCOLM X) places 
would-be actress Judy (Theresa Randle) in a position where her best 
chance to earn a living is by talking dirty to anonymous men over the 
phone.  All day long, she sits in an office cubicle, next to dozens of 
other girls in similar cubicles, using her disembodied voice to play 
dominatrix, schoolgirl, housewife, and any number of other roles.  
However, Judy falls prey to the profession's dark side.  It's easy to 
become hooked on the fantasies, and, especially with a little Marijuana 
to augment the experience, reality can become a tenuous thing. </P>
<P>     When it comes to details, GIRL 6 is excellent.  Lee's film is 
sprinkled with touches that give his phone sex world an aura of 
verisimilitude:  dark-haired, black women pretending to be busty 
blondes, someone flipping through a magazine while moaning into the 
receiver, and workers scarcely able to contain laughter at callers' more 
absurd requests.  The phone sex mantra is simple:  "Listen, appreciate, 
and don't judge -- you want them to like you."  The girls go by numbers, 
not names; hence, Judy becomes "Girl 6".</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, as good as GIRL 6 is with the fine points, the 
larger brushstrokes are erratic.  Lee may have a keen sense of setting 
and dialogue, but his characterization is off.  Other than Judy, no one 
has any depth, and even she isn't afforded much development.  Theresa 
Randle (SUGAR HILL, MALCOLM X) is okay in the role, but not a 
revelation.  The other characters, especially Judy's ex-husband (Isaiah 
Washington) and her baseball memorabilia-collecting neighbor, Jimmy 
(Lee), are virtual nonentities.  </P>
<P>     Psychologically, GIRL 6 is superficial.  Unlike EXOTICA, which cut 
deeply into the motivations of those who work in and frequent strip 
clubs, this film is content to skim the surface of a similar industry.  
One scene of poignant disillusionment notwithstanding, Judy's burgeoning 
addiction to the illusory aspects of her job is used more as a plot 
device than a means of exploring her psyche.</P>
<P>     Is being a phone sex girl exploitation or just another job?  The 
question is raised, although Lee doesn't really probe it.  While GIRL 6 
is considerably more effective than SHOWGIRLS at exploring the issue, 
there are times when this film seems like the proverbial triumph of 
style over substance.  Cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, who worked 
with Lee on CLOCKERS, uses a battery of odd camera angles and 
experimental shots.  Most of these work on a purely visual level, but 
their attempts to telegraph emotional states are less successful.</P>
<P>     The highlights of the film are a trio of parody fantasies.  In two 
of these, Lee dresses Judy as Dorothy Dandridge and Foxy Brown.  In the 
other, he fills the role of George Jefferson in a sendup of the hit TV 
series.  There's also an impressive list of cameos:  Naomi Campbell 
(Girl 75), Ron Silver (a sleazy Hollywood director), Peter Berg ("Bob 
Regular"), John Turturro (Judy's agent), Madonna (the manager of a work-
at-home phone sex operation), Halle Berry (herself), and Quentin 
Tarantino (portraying, and mocking, himself).  Give Lee credit for using 
Madonna and Tarantino in roles they're capable of playing.</P>
<P>     If nothing else, GIRL 6's perspective of the industry is 
fascinating.  The fantasy is that phone sex women are all beautiful, 
young, and hot.  The stereotype is that they're ugly, wrinkled, and 
haggard.  The reality, at least in GIRL 6, is somewhere in between.  
None of the revelations here are especially shocking -- we've seen a lot 
of this stuff before, anywhere from TV news magazines to Robert Altman's 
SHORT CUTS (where Jennifer Jason Leigh played a phone sex girl), but Lee 
puts it all together and adds a few twists. Unfortunately, while certain 
aspects of GIRL 6 are handled with flair, the film's dramatic scope too 
often isn't compelling enough for subject matter of such rich and varied 
possibilities. </P>
