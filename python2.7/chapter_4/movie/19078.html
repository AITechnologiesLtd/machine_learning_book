<PRE>BIG DADDY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        If the image of Adam Sandler screaming "SOMEONE GET THIS KID A
HAPPY MEAL!!" at the top of his lungs makes you snicker, then "Big Daddy"
is definitely for you.</P>
<P>        Sandler's latest film (following his recent mega success with "The
Wedding Singer" and "The Waterboy") isn't much of step up from those
previous encounters, but it retains all of their good-natured affability.
Heck, I even enjoyed "Bulletproof," most notably because of the lively
pairing of Sandler and former "In Living Color" frontsman Damon Wayans.</P>
<P>        Here, Sandler is ably supported by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse,
who play the post-diaper-wearing kid adopted by Sandler's character.  For
those who might be apprehensive about the film's adoption theme, fear not.
The film isn't in the same league as the detestable "Problem Child"
(ironically also directed by "Big Daddy"'s Dennis Dugan) and its equally
offensive sequel.  Similarly, for those who feel that the only decent child
actors are European, fear not again.  The Sprouse twins may be as
indistinguishable as Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, but they differ from those
obnoxious little automatons by being both cute yet not precocious.</P>
<P>        In "Big Daddy," toll-booth collector Sonny Koufax (Sandler) is
having some difficulty with his girlfriend Vanessa (played by Kristy
Swanson, the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  Just when things are at
their worst, a strange package is delivered to Sonny's door: a
five-year-old orphan called Julian.  Julian arrives with a note attached
that explains how he's purportedly the son of Sonny's roommate Kevin (Jon
Stewart), who's currently heading out of the country.  Like the
all-around-good-guy he is, Sonny phones Kevin at the airport, explains the
little problem, and volunteers to take care of Julian, at least for the
time being.</P>
<P>        Before you know it Sonny starts bonding with the little tyke (who
has a real difficulty containing his bodily fluids), seeing his new-found
parenthood as a way to prove his commitment to Vanessa.</P>
<P>        Although Sonny has a law degree (perhaps the first Sandler
character with brains), his parenting skills are limited at best, and the
film goes all out to create funny scenarios involving Sonny showing Julian
the ropes: teaching him to pee on buildings, eat junk food to excess, wear
ridiculous outfits, use bad language, etc.</P>
<P>        In the course of all this inanity (helped along by the redoubtable
Steve Buscemi as a homeless wino and Rob Schneider as an Eastern Block deli
deliveryman), Sonny falls for a corporate lawyer played by Joey Lauren
Adams ("Chasing Amy").  In "Big Daddy," Adams finally lays to rest the
rumor that she's a terrible actress.  She proves it!  The film culminates
in a "Judge Judy"-styled courtroom sequence that piles on the
sentimentality and would be a total embarrassment were it not for Sandler's
playful, puppydog persona and a strong turn by Joe Bologna as Sonny's
disapproving father.</P>
<P>        Although I enjoyed "Big Daddy," I wouldn't take my pre-teen
daughters to see it, since the profanity is endless and unnecessary.  In
addition, they don't need incessant Hooters' (the restaurant and beyond)
references forced down their impressionable young throats.  Adam Sandler
should stick to yelling about Happy Meals.  McDonalds is our kind of place.</P>
