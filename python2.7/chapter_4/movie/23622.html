<P>Starring Hilary Swank, Chloë Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton
III. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. Rated R (Warning: This movie is on
the outer boundaries of the R rating. Don't take aunt Helen).</P>
<P>Boys Don't Cry is a brutal, often painful to watch the biopic of Teena
Brandon, a teenage girl who dressed up as a boy, lied to a girl, mixed
in with the wrong crowd and got brutally raped and murdered. In a year
when Hollywood adaptations of true stories -- some truthful than,
controversially, others -- dominated critics' top ten list, this may
have been the only one I truly liked, though "enjoyed" is the wrong
word to use here.</P>
<P>This is a situation movie, where there is a set-up and then events are
allowed to progress on their natural course without an honest-to-
goodness storyline. In what is easily the year's most lauded
performance, Hilary Swank plays Teena Brandon who, as I've mentioned,
dresses up as a boy and makes friends with a group of trailer-trashy
folk with family problems and what seem like outgoing personalities.
Specifically, Teena falls in love with Lana (Chloë Sevigny), a
beautiful young woman stuck in the middle of a dysfunctional family and
trapped in a town where she has no future.</P>
<P>Teena and Lana form a nice relationship, but they have to deal with
Lana's family, who will not stand for the idea of a boy pretending to
be a girl should they ever find out the truth. In real life, of course,
they did find out the truth and the results were tragic.</P>
<P>For better or for worse, depending on the viewer, Boys Don't Cry does
not spare us the details. The final scenes become painful to watch --
we want to turn away but we don't dare. Director Kimberly Peirce
portrays the final event in all its crushing realisticity, refusing to
soften things up for those who can't stomach them. Many reviews have
had this caveat and I will say it again: Boys Don't Cry is not for the
squeamish. It is rated R but could easily have received an NC-17. Use
caution.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the movie has received uniformly bad reviews from the
wacky, inimitable Christian Right. Hardly surprising, considering the
film's liberal good intentions. It is decidedly pro-homosexuality,
though I hate to put such a simplistic label on a movie as good as this
one. Reading some reviews for it, I was surprised that people can hate
it so much just because they disagree with it.</P>
<P>The reason that Boys Don't Cry has received so much media attention is
simple: Hilary Swank. She is, indeed, phenomenal -- not only successful
in playing a girl-turned-boy but also in lodging her character deep in
our hearts, a place she will remain in for a long time. What's less
fortunate, perhaps, is that she casts a long shadow on her equally
amazing co-star Chloë Sevigny. At once gorgeous, approachable and, in
the end, powerfully poignant, Sevigny was nominated for an Best
Supporting Actress Oscar. Despite the awards recognition, when people
talk about Boys Don't Cry, the name Hilary Swank always comes up; her
co-star is all but forgotten.</P>
<P>The film is, in some ways, expressing rage against intolerance but it's
too good a movie to act as a propaganda machine. In the end, of course,
it comes back to this central theme but rather than preach through the
whole movie, the filmmakers take us on a journey through a world we may
not realize that we live in. Indeed, in a perfect world, this movie
wouldn't had to have been made. Unfortunately, this is not a perfect
world and the absorbing, daring Boys Don't Cry points out one of its
flaws.</P>
