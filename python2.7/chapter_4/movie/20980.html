<P>In Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, set in the 90s, Austin's
arch-nemesis Dr. Evil is laughably stuck in the 60s, demanding a million
dollars to ransom the world, etc. Now it's the second installment, though,
and, to keep it interesting, Mike Myers has turned it all around: back in
his own time--the 60s--Dr. Evil is now laughably stuck in the 90s. Meaning
he now wants to ransom the world for a billion or so dollars, which is just
as preposterous as his 90s ransom demand. Which is precisely what Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is all about: temporal dislocation. It's why
we love (or hate) Austin--via some fantastic cryogenics, he's managed to
preserve a 60's mindset wholly unsullied by the 70s and 80s. But, to return
to the little binary set that propels both movies (Dr. Evil/Austin Powers),
while this childlike quality is light-hearted and attractive in Austin, in
Dr. Evil it's a character flaw. Granted, a lighthearted, entertaining one,
but still, more or less the reason Austin defeats him in International Man
of Mystery.
The Spy Who Shagged Me isn't quite so balanced. This time the binary set of
Austin/Evil falls apart a bit, with Dr. Evil more or less taking the lead
role, leaving Austin and Agent Shagwell (Heather Graham) to their series of
hijinks etc. Perhaps this is a result of the introduction of Fat Bastard
(Mike Myers again), Dr. Evil's lackey, or perhaps Evil's Mini-Me skewed
everything somehow. Whatever the case, with Austin and Evil no longer
counterbalancing each other narratively, the mojo that propelled us through
the first installment is somewhat diluted, and all we have to pull us
through then is the slapstick, the self-conscious intertextuality, the
in-jokes.
But there is plenty of all three.
Maybe even too much. Granted, Dr. Evils' Puff-Daddy intermezzo is one of the
highlights of the movie, something we can cue into, and there's Austin
mistaking a stool-sample for coffee, even Agent Shagwell pulling an Austin
from International Man of Mystery (sleeping with the enemy), but it doesn't
all cohere. Instead of going constantly forward as a 'fantastic' comedy
absolutely needs to, The Spy Who Shagged Me sidesteps again and again into
un-plot-related SNL-ish sketches. Dr. Evil's Puff-Daddy intermezzo is a case
in point. But , again, these sketches are entertaining (especially Will
Ferrel's Monty Python take-off), they just make The Spy Who Shagged Me a
fundamentally different type of movie than International Man of Mystery,
which used the sketches as plot devices.
In spite of these narrative difficulties, however, The Spy Who Shagged Me
does redeem itself, both with the frame it sets itself in (Jerry Springer
episodes) and with a wonderful little device it uses never to say 'penis'
when 'penis' really needs to be said. Just as in the closing scene of
International Man of Mystery the naked Austin and Vanessa Kensington's
(Elizabeth Hurley) R-rated parts are always hidden at the last possible
moment, so in The Spy Who Shagged Me--via wordplay, editing, and cameos
(Woody, Willie, etc)--'penis' is never said in the proper context, though
it's what everyone's talking about. This is Austin Powers, after all, and,
while we may not expect narrative rigor, we can can count on extended
joke-sequences such as these, handled with that signature Mike Myers touch.</P>
