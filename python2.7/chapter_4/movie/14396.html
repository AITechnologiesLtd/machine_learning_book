Susan Granger's review of "NEXT STOP WONDERLAND" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>        Independent film-maker Brad Anderson's whimsical, low-budget
romance was a big hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. Hope Davis
is a 30ish Boston nurse who has just been dumped by her political
activist boy-friend, a Marxist, who, heartlessly, took the futon and
left her a farewell message on the video. This callous rejection
prompts her meddling socialite mother, played by Holland Taylor, to
place a personals ad on her behalf in a local newspaper. Meanwhile, on
the other side of town, Alan Gelfont, a second-generation plumber, is
trying to separate from his family's seedy underworld background by
becoming a marine biologist. Unfortunately, however, his work at the
Boston Aquarium revolves around fixing leaky pipes. As sulky Hope
embarks on a series of disastrous dates with strange suitors, she
keeps almost meeting Alan as they're both traveling on the Boston
Metro's Wonderland line. Finally, of course, they do meet and romance
blossoms.  Of course, then there's the 'what next?' problem or, as one
character comments: "The real mystery is what keeps two people
together after they meet." With her big brown eyes, pale skin, long
blonde hair, and tart commentary, Ms. Davis is, indeed, a contemporary
Alice, pondering her destiny as she's gazing into the looking glass
with the same quirky appeal of Lewis Carroll's adventurous heroine. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Next Stop Wonderland" is a wry,
wistful 7. Set to a Brazilian bossa nova swing called "saudade," it's
an intelligent, upbeat look at the urban singles scene, a "chick
flick."</P>
