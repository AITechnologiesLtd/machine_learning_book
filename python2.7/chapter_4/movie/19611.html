<PRE>The 24 Hour Woman   * * (out of * * * * )</PRE>
<P>Directed by Nancy Savoca.
Cast: Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Diego Serrano, Wendell Pierce, 
Patti LuPone, Karen Duffy, Aida Turturro.
1999 - 92 minutes.
Rated R (for profanity and brief violence).
Capsule Review, July 27, 1999.</P>
<P>The exquisite characters , tightly-wound stories, and memorable writing that 
usually accompanies films directed by talented indie filmmaker Nancy Savoca 
(1989's "True Love," 1991's "Dogfight") are all but absent in her latest 
comedy-drama, "The 24 Hour Woman." Rosie Perez heads the hit-and-miss film as 
Grace, a rising television talk show producer whose life drastically changes 
when she gets pregnant with her actor husband (Diego Serrano), and ultimately 
becomes overloaded when the baby comes, questioning whether her career or job 
as a parent is more important. Rosie Perez, in one of her more quietly 
restrained and effective roles, is left stranded in a tiresome comedy-drama 
that is not very funny and is often too overwrought to be poignant. If 
anything, the film successfully shows how difficult a job parenting is; 
perhaps too successfully, since watching the non-stop chaos of children 
became overly stressful to me, even as merely a viewer.</P>
