<PRE>                                 METROPOLITAN
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  An outsider gets involved with the
     tinder of the vanities, a clique of young, chic, semi-
     intellectuals who talk like the ATLANTIC MONTHLY but whose
     lives are just as mis-managed as anyone else's.  Walt
     Stillman's dialogue is the main reason to see METROPOLITAN.
     Rating: +1.</P>
<P>     There is a separate sort of film I think you would have to call "the
dialogue film."  It is a concept parallel to that of "the special effects
film."  A dialogue film is built around and shows off its dialogue the way a
special effects film is built around and shows off its visual effects.
While films one would classify as dialogue films have been more common in
Europe than in the United States, obvious American dialogue films include
RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, THE BIG CHILL, and especially MY DINNER WITH
ANDRE.  METROPOLITAN has marginally more plot than the former three films,
but it probably still qualifies.</P>
<P>     In METROPOLITAN, Tom Townsend (played by Edward Clements) gets politely
kidnapped to a debutante party populated by young, wealthy, sophisticated
intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals.  They call themselves the SFRP
(Sally Fowler Rat Pack) and representatives of the UHB (Urban Haute
Bourgeoisie).  Tom's background is not quite so haute as the others but he
can talk the talk and with a little help from the others he can walk the
walk, in a second-hand tuxedo.  But it is talking the talk that is the main
thing and while on an intellectual level Tom has objections to this young
tinder of the vanities--Tom believes himself to be a Fourier socialist--he
nonetheless finds himself repeatedly drawn to their company.</P>
<P>     The plot of METROPOLITAN is only very slight as one of the quieter
members of the rat pack, a literature fan named Audrey Rouget (played by
Carolyn Farina), takes a liking to Tom, though Tom is still in love with
former girlfriend Serena Slocum (Elizabeth Thompson).  But this film's fine
point is not so much the plot as its view of this young aristocracy and the
often funny and always engrossing dialogue.  Writing credit for the dialogue
(as well as most of the rest of the credit) goes to writer/director/producer
Walt Stillman who, according to VARIETY sold his Manhattan apartment to help
finance the film.  He probably will not get rich making films like
METROPOLITAN, but he should be able to get another apartment.  I rate this a
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
