<P>Stockholm film Review (<A HREF="http://www.reviewfilm.com">http://www.reviewfilm.com</A>)</P>
<P>After a daring robbery of a Rembrandt, insurance agent Gin Baker
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is convinced that a famous art thief,
Robert 'Mac' McDougal (Sean Connery) has been responsible, and
persuades her boss Hector Cruz (Will Patton) to let her go
undercover in order to track Mac down. Hector reluctantly agrees,
and Gin heads to London and soon makes contact with Mac. She
persuades him that she is a fellow thief, and that she needs his
help in order to steal a priceless (what else ?) Chinese mask,
which is on display in an English castle. They devise an intricate
plan to bypass the security systems (which involves lots of lasers),
which involves the help of Mac's associate, Thibadeaux (Ving
Rhames). The questions are, is Mac really convinced that Gin is a
bone fide thief, and what is Gin's real role; undercover agent or
double agent ?</P>
<P>Entrapment is a curiously listless affair. It's intent seems to be
a glossy, fast-paced international thriller, full of exotic locales
and exciting action sequences. Almost like a 007 movie, perhaps ?
However, no amount of tourist scenes from the U.S. and Malaysia can
disguise the fact the movie is more or less set in Scotland. Sound
economics maybe, but not so exotic. Sean Connery produced this
movie and he finished it under budget. It shows. It might also
explain the most puzzling aspect of the film. There are two heists
in the film, the theft of the mask, which takes up most of the
movie, and a cunning scheme to rip of an international bank in
Kuala Lumpur on the eve of the millennium (the film opens 15 days
before the Millennium) which provides the climactic finale to the
film. Though it becomes apparent that the bank heist is intended
to be the highlight of the film, and a complicated job, it
occupies a small amount of screen time. Moreover, Mac and Gin only
have less than 24 hours to read a bunch of detailed schematics of
the world's tallest building, learn about all the security systems
and plan their robbery, and spend half of that time trying to
double-cross each other.</P>
<P>What is even more odd is the amount of time spent avoiding the
alarm laser beams which intersect the exhibition room. This means
that Gin, is a rather fetching, skin-tight costume, must perform
an intricate routine (almost like a ballet) to squeeze between the
beams. While it is great to look at (and, I suspect, the actual
reason for the scene) it accomplishes very little, since the guard
arrives about 10 seconds after they take the mask, and sounds the
alarm. A smash and grab would have achieved the same result. The
bank heist isn't much better, and degenerates into a very routine
chase.</P>
<P>Since Sean Connery is almost seventy years of age, and Miss Jones
is a mere slip of a girl at 29, it was always going to be a bit
difficult to convince the audience that there can be a plausible
romance between the two. In fact, you would find more evidence of
chemistry (organic or otherwise) on the Moon. If anything, their
relationship comes across as more father-daughter, which is probably
even less palatable than a straightforward romance. Moreover, the
Gin character acts more like a teenager than would-be master
criminal, and most of the plotting and attempted double dealing
is either incomprehensible or just silly.</P>
<P>It is possible to make an enjoyable movie with the sort of raw
material available in Entrapment. After all, Brian DePalma managed
such a feat with Mission:Impossible (1996). Jon Amiel not so much
directs as just points in the general direction, in the vague hope
that the film finds its own way. It doesn't. Ving Rhames is sadly
underused (and just about repeats his Mission:Impossible role),
Will Patton doesn't have much to do either, and Maury Chaykin
performance as criminal art collector Conrad Greene is excruciating.
Connery himself looks tired throughout the film, as if perhaps he
has finally realised that he's getting a bit old for this sort of
nonsense. It's not that Entrapment is a very bad movie, just a
very indifferent one. For a thriller, that's not much of a
recommendation, though.</P>
