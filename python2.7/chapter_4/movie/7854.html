<PRE>                                FORGET PARIS
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1995, PG-13, 101 minutes [1 hour, 41 minutes]
[romantic comedy]
starring: Billy Crystal (Mickey), Debra Winger (Ellen), Joe Mantegna (Andy),
Cythia Stevenson (Liz), written by Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz, Babaloo
Mandel, produced and directed by Billy Crystal.</P>
<P>What is it about Europe that makes people fall in love with each other? Not
too long ago a wonderful film called "Before Sunrise" depicted a young couple
meeting in Europe and falling in love. By the end they had to go their
separate ways but no one wanted them to. "Forget Paris" wonders what would
happen if they had stayed together... and were older... and if it were a
comedy.</P>
<P>Billy Crystal stars in this film he also wrote, produced, and directed about
an NBA referee named Mickey who finds himself stuck in Paris, looking for his
father's coffin after the airline that shipped it there lost it.</P>
<P>Mickey meets the airline's customer service manager, Ellen (Winger), a
beautiful brunette who happens to be an American living and working in Paris.
They are immediately attracted to each other, but neither can come right out
and say it. This typical plot device works well here because of Crystal and
Winger's great chemistry. There is a scene that perfectly defines the  "don't
let her get away!" element.  It's difficult to make an audience think this,
and when Mickey and Ellen do get together it is quite satisfying. These two
people seem made for each other, and it appears as if everyone will live
happily ever after...</P>
<P>The two fall in love, move to L.A. and get married, but they have some
problems. Mickey travels constantly because of his job, and this affects
their relationship. There are some hysterical scenes in which Mickey takes
out his angst on the giant NBA players. It's very funny to watch this small
man get into a shouting contest with David Robinson and Charles Barkley, and
the fact the players can act doesn't hurt a bit. I only wish more there had
been more scenes like these.</P>
<P>Mickey and Ellen's marriage seems to be crumbling before their eyes and they
can't figure out what to do. They know they love each other and they don't
want anyone else, but because they are separated so much it takes its toll.
Crystal is able to keep a good balance between the comedic aspects and the
lighthearted, but realistic drama. No one over acts here, and the script
doesn't allow for any quick fixes.</P>
<P>Eventually Mickey takes time off from work, but Ellen's cranky, senile
father (William Hickey) moves in and hilarity ensues. The in-law friction
could be seen as a typical comedy device but it is believable here. But
things never seem to be as good as the should be, which makes us sad because
we actually care about these characters. They seem like real people who are
meant for each other, not just two characters in a movie. </P>
<P>When Mickey and Ellen try to have a baby it doesn't work because of
fertility problems. There is a hysterical scene in which he must give a sperm
sample, and all I can say is, it takes a squad of police cars to safely
deliver his sample - a funny exploitation of the male code. </P>
<P>Describing and critiquing the ending (and entire last act) would be rather
pointless. It's predictable, but it's sweet.</P>
<P>"Forget Paris" doesn't have the charm of "Before Sunrise" but it is still
funny. We laugh, we cry, we get a fairytale ending, but the process involving
in telling this story is entertaining and that's what counts. </P>
