<PRE>                                  SOAPDISH
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SOAPDISH is a film starring Sally Fields, Kevin Kline, Robert
Downey, Jr., Cathy Moriarty, and Whoopi Goldberg.  Elizabeth Shue also
has a major role, but doesn't get mentioned in the display ads.</P>
<P>     SOAPDISH is a very funny movie, a farce that understands perfectly
the weirdness of the soap opera, the "continuing daytime drama" as the
TV guys like to put it, and understands equally well that people like
their soaps.  It exploits this weirdness until I was howling, yet never
makes itself superior to the genre.  It satirizes without patronizing
and it works wonderfully well.  There is hardly a mean bubble in this
soap.</P>
<P>     Sally Fields is not my favorite actor.  The last time I liked her
ditzy energy was in that movie about stand-up comics, the one that
everyone else in world loathed and abominated apparently.  SOAPDISH
makes me a fan; she is perfect as the aging queen of the soaps,
"America's sweetheart," whose professional and personal lives are
coming apart.  Her live-in boyfriend goes back to his wife; her producer
and one of her co-stars (Cathy Moriarty) are plotting to push her out of
her long-running soap.  A demon (Kevin Kline) from the past shows up in
both her worlds unwelcome and unbidden.  Her misery is perfect,
comically exaggerated and intense, agonizingly funny, just as her
vulnerability and desperation make her human and appealing.  We laugh
ourselves silly at her expense, but we never dislike her.  This seems to
be exactly what is missing from most Hollywood comedies these days; does
anyone *like* John Candy, par exemple?</P>
<P>     Kevin Kline can do no wrong, as far as I'm concerned.  He's not so
driven here as he was in A FISH CALLED WANDA, but instead he's a lot
more human.  When we first meet him, in a geriatric dinner theater in
Florida, playing Willy Loman, we know that he can relate to his role.
He is an excellent foil to Fields' craziness, more in control but just
as desperate, just as determined to win through, and just as funny.</P>
<P>     Robert Downey, Jr., and Cathy Moriarty are the conspirators, the
heavies, he driven by his lust for Montana (Moriarty), she driven by her
need to be the queen of the soaps.  Downey is really quite wonderful
here, his timing, delivery giving his part a kind of snappy hilarity
that makes him appealing and adorable in a sleazy way.  Moriarty is
strange; about her I can't say too much without talking about plot,
something I try to avoid in these notices.  Leave us say merely that she
makes a major contribution to the hilarity.</P>
<P>     Whoopi Goldberg is Fields's head writer and only friend.  She looks
wonderful in her slightly wacky outfits.  She is the only
straight-thinking, honorable person is the soapy world of ratings and
rivalries.  She has her funny moments, but her major role is that of
second banana to Fields, something Goldberg carries off with surprising
skill considering her own enormous comedic skills.</P>
<P>     Elizabeth Shue plays the newcomer who throws everyone's lives and
plots into the trashcan.  This role has to be a boost in her somewhat
floundering career; after all, I don't think she's carried a movie since
ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, in which she sang the memorable "Babysitter's
Blues."  She looks good, she acts well, she's a more than competent
comedienne.  Since I'm expecting SOAPDISH to be a major money machine, I
think Shue's name will in all likelihood be moving up above the title
one of these days soon.</P>
<P>     This is a very funny movie that achieves its high level of hilarity
through a combination of sight gags, sexual humor, farce, satire, and a
respect for the audience that is extremely rare and successful.</P>
<PRE>     I can recommend SOAPDISH even at full prices.</PRE>
