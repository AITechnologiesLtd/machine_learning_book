<PRE>                     A review by Albert Sanchez Moreno</PRE>
<P>                  Miguel de Cervantes' great seventeenth century Spanish
classic, "Don Quixote de La Mancha", is universally acknowledged as one of
the greatest books ever written,and the first truly "modern" one (i.e., a
novel in which the main characters evolve emotionally and
intellectually,and change over a certain period of time). It is an
enormously long work,and an extremely difficult one to adapt to the screen
without sacrificing the philosophical insights of the novel,some of which
may seem undramatic on screen, others of which are subtly hidden beneath
the comic surface of the book.</P>
<P>                   Most filmmakers since the beginning of movies have opted
for two approaches, a superficial stringing together of just a handful of
the tragicomic misadventures of the knight and his squire Sancho
Panza,while carefully pruning most of the philosophy out of the work, (as
in the 1948 Spanish film,considered a monumental achievement in its native
country)or a film merely suggested by the novel and heavily revising its
plotline to suit dramatic purposes (as in the famous stage musical "Man of
La Mancha",filmed in 1972, or the 1933 semi-operatic Chaliapin version). I
have nothing against this if it is done with integrity,as in "Man of La
Mancha",but some film versions,notably the Rex Harrison 1973 BBC-TV
version,drastically change the entire tone of the work.</P>
<P>                     This most recent television version, starring John
Lithgow as Don Quixote and Bob Hoskins as Sancho Panza,tries to do both,and
succeeds remarkably,due to an excellent script by British playwright John
Mortimer,who seems to be one of the few writers to truly understand how to
adapt this brilliant novel without substituting his own inventions to bring
out the inner meanings. Director Peter Yates also seems to understand that
"Don Quixote" doesn't need to be treated in a heavy-handed,tragic style;
that it is all right to trust Cervantes' own style as well as the
intelligence of the audience,something that obviously isn't always learned.
Lithgow is brilliant as the Don,hilariously nutty in the early scenes,and
poignant in the second half of the film,in which Quixote is made the
dignified victim of cruel and insensitive practical jokes. Bob
Hoskins,despite his pronounced Cockney accent,does an admirable job as
Sancho Panza.</P>
<P>                        The other roles are little more than cameos,even
the misleadingly third and fourth-billed Isabella Rossellini,as a seemingly
sweet,but inwardly horrendously insensitive Duchess,and Vanessa Williams as
both the milkmaid Aldonza and the Don's imaginary ladylove,Dulcinea del
Toboso,who makes HER appearances in the Don's imagination. </P>
<P>                          Director Yates is intelligent enough to resist
the temptation to overplay the insensitivity of the outside world as much
as possible; unlike so many other directors, he does not take sides with
the characters.and tries to be as objective as Cervantes himself. He allows
us to discover for ourselves the insensitivity of the Duke and Duchess,and
perhaps the only unfortunate change he makes is in turning Sanson Carrasco
into a wholly sympathetic figure,rather than the full-of-himself clod that
Cervantes creates, and even Yates couldn't resist a "Man of La Mancha"
touch in the final scene (nobody can,now,actually).</P>
<P>                            The period of the film has been updated to
about 1800, to make the idea of knight-errantry seem even further in the
past,though this does not really hurt the film. It is
unfortunate,though,that producer Robert Halmi couldn't resist providing a
sop to the now wildly popular notion of working special effects into
everything. Unlike any other version, Quixote's hallucinations are vividly
shown onscreen,and it must be admitted,it does lend a certain flavor to the
story to see them,but the "monstrous giants" shown onscreen have more in
common with a  George Lucas "Star Wars" film or a Ray Harryhausen Sinbad
flick than with "Don Quixote". </P>
<P>                                   Still,this latest version of the novel
is excellent and not to be missed. It has been beautifully photographed on
location in Spain,and enhanced with a Spanish-flavored musical score. It is
easily the best version of Cervantes' original novel done in English.</P>
