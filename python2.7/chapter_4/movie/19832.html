<P>While not very filling in itself, An Ideal Husband is a nicely rounded
and all-together fluffy period romance. There's enough dashing
wardrobes, sharply-spoken dialogue and humorous plot twists to keep
everyone entertained - if they can stand a break from a summer full of
big-budget action movies.</P>
<P>Rupert Everett has always been a striking leading man, but he hasn't
been able to break through with a character since My Best Friend's
Wedding. At least, not this successfully. An Ideal Husband gives Everett
the role of the grouchy but handsomely divine Lord Arthur Goring.
Despite the constant bickering of his father (John Wood), Goring refuses
to settle down with someone or even consider marriage. His best friend
is the wealthy, popular politician Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam),
who is married himself to the calmly but beautiful Lady Gertrud (Cate
Blanchett). The central plot circulates not around Goring, but instead
deals with Sir Robert and some past problems that have come back to
haunt him. With the appearance of the mysterious Mrs. Chevely (Julianne
Moore), an old friend of the family, Sir Robert's life begins to
evaporate into deceit and mistrust. Mrs. Chevely has evidence of a past
scandal that could destroy Sir Robert's stand in politics, and she
threatens to blackmail him if he doesn't support her requests. With his
wealth and marriage on the line, Sir Robert turns to Lord Goring for
advice and friendship.</P>
<P>This plot outline successfully ties all of the lead characters into one
amusing web, including Mabel Chiltern (Minnie Driver), the witty and
sharp-tongued younger sister of Sir Robert. An Ideal Husband, based on a
play by Oscar Wilde, is set in the late 19th century. To be taken in by
the humor, we must first believe the time period. The set and production
designers responsible for An Ideal Husband do a commendable job of
bringing the horse-guided carriages and feathered hats to colorful life.
Kudos also to the makeup and costume artists, who have obviously spent
countless hours researching the fashions that wealthy men and women
(particularly the women) would wear. The wonderful setting of An Ideal
Husband makes it so much easier to absorb all the goings-on.</P>
<P>The dialogue throughout the film is bursting with brilliance, and it
helps matters that the experienced and talented cast is delivering such
lines. The confrontations are marvelous exchanges of devious wit and
wordplay, and there is never once a lull in the screenplay. There are
many clever quips spoken throughout, such as when Lord Goring states
with a conceited smile: `To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance...' Nicely said.</P>
<P>Although I may be jumping to conclusions (and making the assumption that
the late-summer kiddie flick Inspector Gadget will not win him raves),
I'd say this is going to be one of Rupert Everett's most memorable
performances. Everett is a scene-stealer in An Ideal Husband, with a
delightful knowledge of all his buffoonery that makes his character more
enjoyable. He's smart, captivating, and light on his feet. But to ignore
the supporting players would also be deemed entirely un-called for. The
entire cast looks simply smashing, from Driver's spirited turn to
Moore's deviously evil execution, it's just a viewing pleasure. In some
respects, the resolution of An Ideal Husband may be somewhat slight, and
the film is also too entirely short. But these are shortcomings gladly
forgotten as we are whisked away by the arresting dialogue and plot
turns.</P>
<P>There is little hope for this film to be widely recognized, with
competition like Will Smith and profane cardboard-constructed eight-year
olds. But nestled in the heart of summer lies this entertaining and
briskly enjoyable movie that will make more of a boom with critics and
audiences than Godzilla's thundering footsteps ever did.</P>
