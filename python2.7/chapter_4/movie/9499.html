<PRE>THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Steven Spielberg
Writer: David Koepp (kinda based on the novel by Michael Crichton)
Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Jullianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince
Vaughn, Arliss Howard, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee
Carter, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazello</P>
<P>I saw "The Lost World," the sequel to "Jurassic Park," for a buck
twenty-five at my college's cheap movie theater, since I wouldn't pay a
good five bucks to see it in a regular one when the rest of the world
was seeing it.  Since I had passed a good environment up for crap
quality, a pan-and-scan format, and sound that was muffled and blaring,
as well as the question of whether or not the whole screen would even be
in focus, you can tell I had low expectations.</P>
<P>Yeah, I really liked "Jurassic Park."  It was breathtaking, scary, and
just good old fun.  But, well, you know that good sequels are about as
plentiful as good college food (so I have no school spirit...).  With
the rare exceptions ("Empire Strikes Back," "The Godfather Part II,"
"T2," "Addams Family Values" - that was about it), the sequel is pretty
much just a gimmick to make even more money on a gimmick that worked
once.   I mean, was it just me, or was "Home Alone 2" just "Home Alone,"
just in a different locale?</P>
<P>No, "The Lost World" is not nearly as good as the first one.  But did it
thrill me?  Oh yeah.</P>
<P>Many people criticize this film, and with good reason, but let's face
it: Steven Spielberg knew there wasn't much he could do with this, but
just wanted to make a fun movie, and toss in some little guilty pleasure
stuff he couldn't work into the original because he was trying to make a
little message.  So, while the first one was majestic, and somewhat
satirical in respects to cloning (though not a masterpiece or anything),
this one is darker, more violent and gorey, and even features one and a
half more T-Rex's.  Why one and a half?  Because one of them is only a
baby.</P>
<P>Of course, when you're making a film like this, where you want suspense
scene after suspense scene, you're bound to run into some little
problems.  For one, he never really builds up any of the characters,
with the exception of the only person from the original to have a major
part - Dr. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) - but that's because he was IN the
first one.  Also, the script is only marginally funny, with most of the
cool lines going to Ian (duh), while it does what most big
budget/let's-give-the-audience-what-they-want-and-deserve flicks do: use
characters' idosyncrasies as cheap plot devices (i.e. a characters
sadism towards the smallest dinosaurs on screen, another characters' gum
chewing, etc, etc, etc).  And there are more plot holes than you can
shake a stick at.</P>
<P>The plot is anti-climactically cheesy and flat: there was ANOTHER
island, where they bred hte dinosaurs or something, and the "capitalist
turned humanist" John Hammond (Richard Attenborough, proving again that
he is a better actor than a director) asks Ian to go back to the
dinosaurs and make sure they're okay.  Obviously he wouldn't want to go
back there, but we have an incredibly cheap plot device where his
girlfriend (Jullianne Moore) is already there.  So off to the other
island for some more dinosaur adventures.</P>
<P>Unlike the first one which pitted a couple characters together with one
goal - getting off the island in one group - we have two groups.  One
the good side are Ian, his girlfriend, his stowaway daughter (Vanessa
Lee Carter, who's mallato-ness caused a bit of a stir in the audience),
a buff photographer ("Swingers"' Vince Vaughn), and Mr. First-Death
(Richard Schiff, who was a scene-stealer in "City Hall").</P>
<P>And on the bad side are the company stereotypes, and their employees. 
We have the nephew of Hammond (Arliss Howard, who NEVER looks the same
in any of his movies), the big hunter chief guy (Pete Postlethwaite), a
sadistic hunter (Peter Stormare, lukewarm off of "Fargo," although I
think he rocks), and a couple of other guys (read: dino food).  They are
united about halfway through the film, following one of the big suspense
scenes.</P>
<P>After the traditional "Jurassic Park" long opening (although not nearly
as awesome as the beginning of the first one, since you were being kind
of educated and awed), we get to the point of the film: to scare the
shit out of you with improbable but highly skilled suspense scenes. 
Yes, the truck-hanging-over-the-cliff sequence is totally unbelievable
for nearly every second, but when you're watching, you're too freaked
out to even notice.  Spielberg, as it turns out, is a pretty good
director, and even if he lets plot holes like "why did Ian not make sure
his daughter was on a train or something before leaving" fly out into
the open, he knows exactly how to frighten us.  There were times, like
in the original, when I jumped, and even when I actually let out a
little Ted-like scream.</P>
<P>The ending, which is the most improbable of them all (the T-Rex is let
loose in the streets of San Diego), is actually done well.  It's all
tongue-in-cheek, with lots of inside jokes (a "Burger King" sign on a
ravaged bus - get it?), as well as blatantly funny ones (the video store
has signs for Robin Williams in "Jack and the Beanstalk" and Ah-nold
Schwarzennegger in "King Lear"), and even a couple parodies tossed in
for good measure (three japs running in terror from the Rex).  The
ending is not as satisfying as the original, mainly because we've been
scared for no good reason.</P>
<P>So is that a bad thing?  Not really.  I mean, yeah, we were scared in
the original, AND there was a reason for it.  But I personally see no
real reason why being scared for the sake of being scared is a bad
thing, other than that means you have to watch this film numerous times
intermittently.  No, the cloning-is-bad message is no longer really
there, but who cares?  It's a sequel.</P>
<P>The cast is amazing, yet there aren't any real acting stand-outs, let
alone Postlethwaite (big shock).  Goldblum isn't nearly as entertaining
as he was in the first one, but has a couple good lines here and there,
and is nicely done by good old Jeff (who should really start demanding a
percentage of the profit of his movies).  Moore, who can shift smoothly
between big budget film and indie, is okay.  The big sadness here, other
than Storemare having such a small and crappy part, is Vince Vaughn. 
After demonstrating exactly what a star-making performance really is in
"Swingers," he gets an under-written role that merely requires him to
look and act cool.  I mean, yeah, he rocks, but if you're gonna have
raptors jumping around and sneaking up on people in 4-foot-high grass,
you might as well toss in a scene where he jumps on top of a building
with a big gun and starts shooting those bastards.  It's only fair.</P>
<P>And as for the whole unlike-the-book spiel, I'll have you know that the
script and the book are two different entities.  They were written at
the same time to do well in their specific mediums.  I mean, I read the
book a long time ago, but I think Ian actually DIED in the first book,
but he's alive here, and starring.  So stop bitching, you Chricton-ites!</P>
<P>The darker tone, and the vicious-ness is a welcome surprise to the film,
causing it to become more fun than the original, in cases.  Sure, it had
plot hole after plot hole, stupidity after stupidity, and a plot weaker
than an Ethiopian (a joke, okay, a joke), but it wasn't aiming for
brilliance.  This was made to make money and entertain.  And I think it
achieved both of those, although not in any kind of spades.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
