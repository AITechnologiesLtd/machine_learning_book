<PRE>_Hurlyburly_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The ensemble cast of Anthony Drazan's screen take on David Rabe's
celebrated play is uniformly excellent, led by Sean Penn, who reprises
his stage role as Eddie, a drugged-out Hollywood casting director headed
quickly down the road of self-destruction.  Filling out the very capable
ensemble are Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Chazz Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn,
and the usually irksome Garry Shandling and Anna Paquin.</P>
<P>So what is the film _about_?  Not much at all, by my evaluation.  The
trailer for _Hurlyburly_ defines the term as "tumultuous commotion,
uproar," and it could not more aptly describe this high-strung but
virtually plotless film.  The movie is merely a collection of scenes
where a bunch of frantic Tinseltown losers such as Eddie talk, talk, and
talk some more, sometimes in English so overly complex that it's hard to
tell if any of these people, let alone the audience, know what they're
talking about.  Keeping the audience at an even further distance is
Drazan's stagy direction, which fails to sufficiently open the play up
for the screen.  But the film is not without its rewards, in particular
the work of Penn, who makes Eddie's meltdown compelling, even though it
is not particularly involving. </P>
