<PRE>                                 THE MASK
                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1994 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     THE MASK just burst onto summer screens.  It will be interesting
to watch and see how it does at the box office.  From me it gets a
mixed, if mostly positive, review.  The film has many assets, and not a
few liabilities.</P>
<P>     The production had the guts to go with the grotesque design of the
character itself, and I can't help but wonder how many people will want
to see a whole movie with *that* face in it.  On the other hand, the
movie is clearly at its best when the mask is on.  When it comes off,
the energy drops and the audience has time to fidget and notice the
frayed curtains around the stage.  When it goes back on, hot dang.
Nobody notices anything except the great gags on the screen.  Some of
them are so well timed as to pull most of their humor from the basic
element of comedy, and others are simply audaciously funny.</P>
<P>     Star Jim Carrey is himself a mixed blessing.  His gift for broad
physical comedy serves him well when he is The Mask, but in his Dr.
Jekyll state it's obvious that, as nice a guy as he is, he just can't
act his way out of a wet paper bag.  I mean, watch him try to be
sincere and *then* come tell me how bad Keanu Reeves is.  A pleasant
surprise is the actress who plays the bombshell (I'm sorry I didn't
catch her name in the credits, but I expect we'll all know it after
this movie).  She acts rings around Carrey (no big deal) and manages to
project some charm through her ho-hum role.  And that's the trouble
with all of the other characters--they're just not interesting.  The
simpleton sidekick to the detective is a bright spot, but for the most
part we just want Jim to put the mask back on so we don't have to spend
more time with these people.</P>
<P>     The film's greatest assets are the art direction and the stunning
effects.  THE MASK paints the frame in solid, comic book colors and
strong graphic shapes.  It almost looks as though someone dipped DICK
TRACY in a little of THE CROW.  Both the design and, more importantly,
the animation of the cartoony transformations are top notch.  On the
downside, the film wants to pay homage to Tex Avery, but doesn't quite
understand how.  When The Mask becomes the Tex Avery wolf who used to
pop his cork at the Preston Blair girl, he's not staged in profile.
Instead, he's seen three-quarter view and in a darkly-lit setting.
This robs an otherwise flawless 3D adaptation of the graphic impact
Avery had in his films.  (My animation bias isn't showing, is it?)</P>
<P>     The story is also a mixed bag.  Many aspects of how the mask works
and how it changes the life of a spineless bank clerk are addressed in
a solid and entertaining manner.  Other basic questions are just
ignored.  The spine of the story contains no real surprises, although I
have to admit that a lot of things happen which I just did not see
coming.  Any sort of a surprise in a fluffy summer film is a pleasant
one as far as I'm concerned.</P>
<P>     So, if you've already seen TRUE LIES, wander on down to the
theatre.  Try to see THE MASK in a good one: the sound effects editor
had the best sense of timing and one of the best senses of humor of
anybody involved in the project.</P>
