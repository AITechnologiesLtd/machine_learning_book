AMERICAN HISTORY X
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>AMERICAN HISTORY X, director Tony Kaye's vitriolic movie, paints an
unflinching portrait of an America filled with uncontrollable racial
hatred.  Focusing on two young men within a Nazi skinhead group of young
whites, the didactic story suggests a world of warring gangs, segregated
by race, whose raison d'etre is to malign and kill all the other races.</P>
<P>Starring Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, the proudly racist leader, the
film partially overcomes David McKenna's ridiculously vituperative
script by the force of Norton's performance.  The movie is such
balderdash that, were it not for the seriousness of the subject matter,
one might find it laughable.</P>
<P>Norton, a chameleon of an actor, sheds the mousy look of his roles in
EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU and THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT for a buff body,
heavy on the tattoos.  Using the explosiveness he showed in his Oscar
nominated performance in PRIMAL FEAR, he brings a chilling credibility
to the role of a hate monger and killer.  In short, he is the reason,
and the only reason, to see the movie.  Without him, the ludicrous
picture would be close to unbearable.</P>
<P>The story starts with 3 African-Americans breaking into Derek's car.
His younger brother and future skinhead, Danny (Edward Furlong) sees
them and interrupts his brother during sex to tell him.  Derek grabs an
automatic weapon and starts killing people.  When one of them refuses to
die from the bullet wounds, Derek crushes his skull on the curb.</P>
<P>Derek goes to prison, and, when he gets out, he spends his time trying
to extricate his younger brother from the white supremacist movement.
The movie jumps backward and forward in time with all periods filled
with long diatribes of racial epithets.</P>
<P>The supporting cast covers all the stereotypes.  Elliott Gould is a
wimpy Jew who'd liked to date Derek's mom were he not scared of Derek.
Beverly D'Angelo is Derek's sickly mom, who coughs between every drag of
the cigarettes she chain smokes.  Ethan Suplee plays Derek's skinhead
buddy, a 400-pound behemoth who couldn't speak without the use of
profanities.  Stacy Keach is a creepy old member of the skinhead set who
plays puppeteer to his Nazi minions.  And the teacher who befriends the
Vinyard boys is an African-American high school teacher with 2 -- count
'em -- 2 Ph.Ds.</P>
<P>The manipulative film, when it isn't spewing racial slurs, uses images
to toy with our emotions.  After Derek complains about how "those
people" are destroying his neighborhood, the camera cuts to an innocent
little, 3-year-old black girl, smiling warmly into the camera.</P>
<P>Anne Dudley's score for the film is impressive, but misplaced.  Full of
long violin notes and dramatic Kettledrums, it strongly punctuates a
film that needs some subtly.</P>
<P>Among the biggest deficiencies in the story is the lack of proper
motivation for Derek's beliefs and actions.  One time it is suggested
that it has something to do with his father's murder.  Later the movie
implies that his attitude stems from a two-minute conversation that he
had at dinner with his dad.  Derek has been reading and liking "Native
Son," in his high school class, but his dad warned him against the book
and the double-Ph.D. teacher who assigned it.  We are asked to believe
that, after this brief conversation, his life was forever changed.</P>
<P>AMERICAN HISTORY X runs 1:57.  It is rated R for graphic brutal violence
including rape, pervasive profanity, sex and nudity.  It should be
considered NC-17 and would be acceptable only for the maturest
teenagers.</P>
