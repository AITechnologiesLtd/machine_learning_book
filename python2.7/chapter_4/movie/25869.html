<P>   My civics teacher taught me that America is a classless
society and I believed him until I graduated from high school
and took a temp job in a large coffee processing plant in
Brooklyn's Greenpoint section.  My seventeenth summer was
not a romantic one.  My job was to type reports, send bills,
do general office work.  Everyone had lunch in the company
cafeteria and there I got my awakening.  All the blue-collar
workers sat on one side on the large mess hall, the white
collar people on the other.  I was naive and asked my new
summer pal why this was so in 100% of the cases.  He said
vaguely that this was not a matter of snobbery.  It's just that
those who got coffee on their hands had little in common with
those who--absent the wonderful aroma of the cheap blended
coffee--could have been working in a dress factory.  Maybe. 
I think now that snobbery was involved.  In the 1950s you
were a snappy piece of work if you wore a white shirt to the
job and came home with barely a ring around the collar. 
Imagine how I felt later on in my career when I discovered
that the gulf between the executives and the white collar
workers was even greater!</P>
<P>   Europeans are not so innocent.  The Continent has always
been divided by class and in Laurent Cantet's striking film,
which was shown at New York's Museum of Modern Art New
Directors/ New Films series as well as at film fests in
Thessaloniki, Torino, Sundance, and San Sebastian, a
twenty-one year old business school graduate gets an on-the-
job education that his graduate studies will scarcely duplicate. 
"Human Resources" sometimes looks like a docu-drama
composed by a militant union, but at its heart it's the story of
a permanent rift between a father and son caused ironically
by dad's own dedication to his son's education and need to
give the boy a life he did not have the opportunity to live.
This is the theme that gives the work its altogether human
measure.</P>
<P>   Opening on a family scene in a provincial French town,
"Human Resources" hones in on young Frank (Jalil Lespert),
ready to take his first serious job in life--as a management
intern in a large factory that welds machine parts.  Sporting a
finely tailored suit on his first day, he is escorted by his dad
(Jean-Claude Vallod), who has worked in that same plant for
thirty years, to the human resources head (Pascal Semard)
and then to the chief of the factory (Lucien Longueville), who
takes paternal interest in the lad and soon fills him with
promises of stellar references.  Notwithstanding, Frank does
not get a swell head, in fact, because his father works in the
plant and he comes from a working-class background, he
holds a sympathy for the ordinary factory hands and is
amused and almost enthralled by the tough talk of the
Communist union boos, Mrs. Arnoux (Danielle Melador). 
After innocently distributing a referendum to tabulate workers'
opinions on a proposed thirty-hour week, he is stunned by a
letter he finds in the private computer of the personnel
manager, a letter that ultimately leads the plant to strike.</P>
<P>   As dramatic and often amusing as the details of
employment are, the real hub of the picture is Frank's conflict
with his father.  On the one hand the boy is appreciative of
the chance he is given to pursue a degree in business
administration.  On the other hand he harbors a long-standing
resentment of his father's social class, actually disgusted that
the man has meekly gone to work, standing up, bent over a
machine that punches up some metal slabs.  In fact, when
the old man expresses pride in his efficiency with his
machine--which treats as though it were his baby--Frank is all
the more repulsed.  The entire film builds up to a staggering
climactic scene in which the young man fiercely lets out all
his repressed rage at the father.  The look on Jean-Claude
Vallod's face throughout the diatribe is the single key
highlight of the entire story.</P>
<P>   What is particularly astonishing is that Jalil Lespert in the
role of young Frank is the only professional actor in the
piece.  To director Laurence Cantet's credit, the rest of the
cast perform credibly and with heartfelt emotion as though
they were indeed going through the torments themselves. In
fact, Danielle Melador as the fiery Mrs. Arnoux really is a
union leader and Lucien Longeuville is in fact an executive.</P>
<P>   The picture made me look book once again in disgust at a
scene I witness from time to time.  Whenever the local
Macy's department store (formerly A&S) had conducted a
strike on Fulton Street in my Brooklyn neighborhood, I would
witness scores of similar working-class people march right
past the pickets, through the revolving doors, as though the
folks holding the signs and fighting for their economic lives
were not their brothers and sisters.  Since I have personally
been on--and in fact led my fellow public high school
teachers--in five risk-filled strikes during my teaching career, I
have a feeling of camaraderie with my fellows in the working
class--and call us teachers middle-management or what you
want, we are indeed working class.  I remain repulsed by the
unkind choices made by ordinary people to patronize stores
that are the scenes of labor disputes.</P>
<P>   In "Human Resources," Frank is in dire straits. 
Sympathizing with labor while knowing he will never work like
them with his hands and on the other hand educated to be
part of management, he will spend his days in conflict, unable
to climb down his metaphoric fence to take a stand on one
side or the other.  How poignant the old union song, "Which
side are you on/ Which side are you on."  </P>
