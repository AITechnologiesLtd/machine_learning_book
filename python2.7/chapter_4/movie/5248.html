<PRE>                               CELTIC PRIDE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     To each his own.  There are those who can be glued to their TVs
watching every sports program and there are those who could not care
less.  Celtic Pride is about two of the former taken to the nth
degree.  Yes, it's a comedy about two basketball fans, Mike O'Hara
(Daniel Stern) and his pal Jimmy Flaherty (Dan Aykroyd), both fanatics
about their Boston Celtics.  Actually, the silliness that this film
engages in can hardly be called "comedy" without demeaning the word.</P>
<P>     Mike and Jimmy are a couple of crazies who are watching Lewis
Scott (Daman Wayans) lead his Utah Jazz team beat the pants off the
Boston Celtics in the game that will decide who is the best team in the
NBA.  Before long, the series is tied at the sixth game and it looks
like the Celtics are going to go down to defeat in the final game.</P>
<P>     When Mike and Jimmy discover that the Jazz's start player is
enjoying an evening at a local nightclub, the two idiots decide to get
Scott drunk so he will be unable to play well the next day.  Need I say
more?</P>
<PRE>                     Directed by Tom De Cerchio.</PRE>
