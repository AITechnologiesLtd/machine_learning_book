<PRE>"Meet the Parents" – A Pleasing Experience
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>For any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to
his girlfriend, there are certain rules that he needs
to follow.  Firstly, fill her life with happiness and
romance during the courtship.  Secondly, buy her a
beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes. 
Thirdly, find the perfect moment and location to
propose.  Finally, the groom-wannabe should probably
get her parent's blessing.  Of these four, the last
one can be a nightmare.  Meeting parents is a rite of
passage, fraught with unexpected questions, bouts of
nervousness, the reality of being disliked, and the
inability to make a positive impression.  If you're
lucky, things will go smoothly.  But, if you're Greg
Focker (Ben Stiller), everything will go wrong.  And
with a name like that, how could it not?</P>
<P>When Greg first meets his fiancée's father, Jack
Byrnes (the grimacing Robert DeNiro), Greg immediately
feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive.  When
he tells Jack that he's a male nurse, the incorrigible
Dad shoots back, "Not many men in your profession,
huh, Greg?"  It's definitely not a good start.  But
Greg is determined to win him over, and it's this
desire that fuels the movie.  He first takes small
steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner.  It
doesn't matter that he's Jewish.  If Daddy Byrnes asks
him to say grace, then that's what he's going to
gamely do.   "Oh God...you're such a good God", he
moons.  His discomfort at trying to force out a simple
prayer will make you chuckle, but when Jack gives him
the "DeNiro Squint" (that familiar, unsettling gaze
that gives DeNiro that aura of invincibility), it's
pretty hard not to grin.</P>
<P>Things get progressively worse for Greg.  And that's
too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a
romantic heart.  Eventually, he begins to try so hard
that he starts to mess everything up, committing a
host of gaffes that embarrass, humiliate or injure
other people.  It's a never-ending ordeal of missteps,
miscues, and mistakes.  He buys some champagne, but
uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous
circumstances.  He tries to find Jack's missing cat. 
But his method of solving the problem leads only to
more trouble.  And there are several other episodes,
each one trumping the next in outrageousness.  The
more our well-meaning beau screwed up, the more the
audience groaned in sympathy.  We liked Greg.  And, we
liked this movie.</P>
<P>"Meet the Parents" is a farcical comedy that certainly
has its moments.  Just sit back and watch Greg get
into trouble.  No matter what the situation, whether
its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or
sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house, things will
horribly go wrong.  We laugh at Greg's expense, but
love often makes a person do dumb things, and Ben
Stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool. 
DeNiro is also affable, tough on the outside yet
sentimental on the inside.  Their tug-of-war is often
funny, the slapstick is elaborate, and there are
several topical throwaway gags (mostly targeted at the
airline industry) to make this film an amusing yet
smart lampoon about future in-laws from Hell.</P>
