<P>The state of the Horror genre in American films has been in dire
straits for the past 20 years. Several films have been heralded as the
savior of the genre. Films such as Wes Craven's "Scream" and "I Know
What  You Did Last Summer" really did nothing to revive the format. It
wasn't until last year with the release of "The Blair Witch Project"
and "The Sixth Sense" that horror films came back to the land of
box-office  success and audience acceptance. But the trend was
actually started back a year earlier with a small little film from the
Island of Japan.</P>
<P>Yes, you heard right the same country that gave us rubber monsters,
samurais masquerading as Italian cowboys, and Laser Discs. But there
has always been a tradition of lyrical and hypnotic horror from the
Island nation. Such regarded films as "Kaiden" and "Onibaba" both
revel in their story telling and ominous portrayal of dread. But for
the past 30 years, audiences have been fed so much carnage that it's
refreshing to find a film that deals in the subliminal and the
sublime.</P>
<P>"The Ring" (Japanese title: "Ringu") is such a film. Telling its tale
of supernatural revenge and atonement  with a leisurely pace and
atmosphere that almost cries out terror. This is not the school of
revulsion. Far from it, this is the realm of bad dreams and bad deaths
that come at you with inexorable finality. This is sublime terror that
cannot be withstood.</P>
<P>The film opens with Tomiko and her friend, two teenage girls spending
the evening together while Tomiko's  parents are at a baseball game.
Tomiko's friend relates the story of a young boy, who had watched a
strange videotape, wherein a old woman, pointing her finger at him
said he would die within a week. Tomiko remains silent as he friend
details the aftermath in which the boy received a phone call
immediately after viewing the tape. The voice on the phone said the
same thing. Tomiko asks her friend what happened to the boy. She
replies, "His parents found him dead. His mouth wide open, like he was
screaming". Tomiko lays down on the floor, her discomfort palpable.
Suddenly, her friend starts to laugh claiming the story is a joke.
Tomiko turns the tables on her friend claiming to have had the exact
same experience while on a camping trip. As her friend starts to
succumb to the fear inherent in the situation, Tomiko breaks down
laughing, replaying the joke.</P>
<P>Suddenly the phone rings! The two girls stop laughing and run down
stairs to answer it. Tomiko's friend  picks up the receiver. The call
turns out to be from Tomiko's Mother. The baseball game is going into
extra innings and they won't be home until late. Tomiko's friend runs
off to use the bathroom. Tomiko hangs up the phone, when the
television in the living room suddenly turns itself on. Tomiko slowly
walks into the room to turn the set off. Returning to the kitchen to
pour herself a drink, Tomiko feels something oppressive in the room.
She turns towards the television; her eyes grow wide in terror. She
screams.</P>
<P>Reiko Asakawa (Nanako Matsushima) is a journalist working on a story
for her television station concerning the urban legend of the cursed
videotape. Interviewing a group of schoolgirls, Reiko becomes immersed</P>
<P>in the tale. Returning home to her son, Koichi (Katsumi Muramatsu),
Reiko gets ready to visit her parents for  the funeral of her niece
Tomiko!</P>
<P>The tale of the curse videotape, formerly only an urban legend has now
become a personal issue for Reiko. Talking with some of Tomiko's
friends outside the home, it is learned that the girl visiting her
that night that she dies is now hospitalized in shock. Hearing that
two of Tomiko's friends died in a car the same evening, Reiko
investigates further. She searches Tomiko's room, finding a roll of
film from her camping trip. Taking the film for developing, Reiko
finds the resort the teenagers had stayed at. But another anomaly is
found on one of the photos. A group shot of all four teens, innocent
enough, except that faces are all distorted and warped.</P>
<P>Investigating the resort, Reiko finds the unlabeled videotape behind
the front desk. She asks the desk clerk about the four teens, but
without any real recollection other than they did not stay the night
they had paid for, there was nothing else strange about them. Reiko
goes to the cabin that her niece had stayed with her boyfriend and
watches the video. The television is first rife with static. But then,
smeared images of a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, someone with
a cloth covering their head, their finger pointing down towards the
bottom of the screen. Numerous other bizarre unconnected images
concluding with a view of a well in a small garden. Reiko turns off
the video. As she does the phone rings!!</P>
<P>Reiko returns home to her son. She is disturbed and uncomfortable. She
calls her ex-husband, Ryuji Takayama (Hiroyuki Sanada) a reporter for
a tabloid and a practicing psychic. Ryuji arrives at Reiko's home. He
stops outside as his son in going off to school. The two stand in
front of each other for a moment,  without exchanging a word. Koichi
goes on his way. Inside the home, Ryuji feels an ominous presence.
Skeptical about the urban legend, he asks to view the video. Reiko
produces the tape (having stolen it from the hotel). As Ryuji watches,
Reiko steps outside unable or unwilling to experience it again. Ryuji
steps outside and tells her, "It's over.. It's been five minutes. No
phone call."</P>
<P>Taking the tape to the Reiko's office, they examine it frame by frame
on a digital editor. Researching the image of the woman on the video,
they find that it is Mai Takano (Miki Nakatani). The only problem is
that Takano, a noted psychic died in the early 60's. The investigation
continues, leading to the Doctor who  brought Takano to Tokyo to
validate her claims of being a true psychic. With only days left
before Reiko may fall prey to the curse, the search for a way to
dispel the curse becomes even more serious when Koichi is urged to
view the video by the ghost of his cousin, Tomiko.</P>
<P>"The Ring" is a luxurious horror film. Director Hideo Nakata is to be
commended for constructing such a chilling and thought provoking film.
The imagery and use of space in the film continually closes in on the
viewer, giving one a continual feeling of claustrophobia. Almost
subliminally, reflections, shadows, and  spectral visions abound in
the periphery of the film. There is so much depth that one is
immediately pulled into the terror.</P>
<P>Nanako Matsushima as Reiko is just marvelous. This is one of the
finest performances I have seen this year. Her decent into terror is
too palpable to be ignored. As she is in almost every scene, she must
carry not only the plot of the film but its emotional depth. Hiroyuki
Sanada as Ryuji is also remarkably good, having to play the bitter
ex-husband part. His dissatisfaction with his marriage and his family
is frightening in and of itself. A loner blames everyone for it. In
essence, he is a psychic that cannot see into his own heart.</P>
<P>The script by Hiroshi Takahashi is such dark poetry that from the
first frame of the film to the final  denouncement, the feelings of
dread never let up. The characters are written with such detail to
their lives and relationships that they seem to be real people. The
film becomes almost a document, a diary if you would of these bizarre
and unfathomable circumstances. The structure of the film plays almost
like a dark detective story or supernatural noir, with clues being
found and dug out of the most desperate of places. The central idea of
an urban legend being true is nothing new, but in the hands of
Takahashi the material is raised to level of suspense and unease that
one cannot really appreciate until after the film has ended.</P>
<P>"The Ring" is without a doubt one of the most unique and frightening
films since "Night of the Living Dead". Unlike that film and other
horror films for the past 30 years, it does so without any gratuitous
scenes of violence of gore. There are a few brief moments of the
grotesque, but they are not handled in a manner that could be
considered exploitative. The subtlety of technique and story telling
make this film closer to Val Lewton territory than anything else in
memory. However, Lewton's films were never this disturbingly real or
close to home. By all cost see this film, this is the true beginning
of a renaissance, and a harbinger of horror films that we can honestly
enjoy and respect. With Fine Line films releasing "The Ring" sometime
this year, it has my vote for one of this years best films.</P>
