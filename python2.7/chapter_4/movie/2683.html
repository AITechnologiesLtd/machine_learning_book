<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
   A vengeful mad-bomber torments an old friend, now on the bomb squad.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Jim Dove (Jeff Bridges) has been with the Boston bomb squad for
quite awhile.  He's a hero.  But now he wants out. He wants to settle
down with Kate (Suzy Amis) and her daughter Liz.  However, a figure
from his obscured past comes back to haunt him in the form of Mad
Bomber Ryan Garrity (Tommy Lee Jones).</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     BLOWN AWAY sucked.  I wanted to see lots of things blowing up.
Hoards of things.  And, to be fair, they did blow up a bunch of
stuff--a toilet, a truck, a man, a bridge, and a boat-of-eternal-
shrapnel-that never-hits-anyone.  They could have blown up more stuff
but our hero, played by Jeff Bridges, has this annoying tendency to
disarm the damn things.  And they missed a damn fine destruction chance
in one scene, where they imply that some lurking news and police
choppers were in for serious shrapnel.  But alas, no chunks-of-truck-
in-the-rotors.  A bomb's just not a bomb if it doesn't blow up, as
pointed out by Dennis Hopper in SPEED.</P>
<P>     Action.  That's what I wanted.  I've got a soft spot for mad
bomber movies, and SPEED hit the spot.  But BLOWN AWAY just didn't do
it for me.  Instead of lots of action, all sorts of PLOT gets in the
way.  Jeff Bridge's character is haunted by his past, he's the best but
he doesn't like it, he accidentally blew up some people he loved, he's
in Bomb squad to repent, blah blah blah.</P>
<P>     And the mad bomber?  The angry, insane IRA bomber is kinda old,
and the U2 soundtrack playing in the background is a little much.
Plus, Tommy Lee Jones is now robbing his own crazy man skit from UNDER
SIEGE.</P>
<P>     Oh, yeah. And there's BLOWN AWAY'S idea of suspense.  It's called
"extreme closeups" and slow-motion.  Dunno about you, but I though Jeff
Bridges' face looks awful stupid in extreme slow-mo.  And although
there are no spring-loaded cats (as horror movies are fond of for a
cheap scare) there's a kitchen scene where they'd have you believe
everything possible is gonna blow.  It works for the first grab at the
fridge, but the second?  Then the stove?  Then the light?  And the
phone?  And all five dials on the stove?  one by one? There was
laughter in the theatre on the third extreme closeup of the stove dial
hitting "lite."</P>
<P>     Any good stuff?  Yea, I guess so.  Let's see--the mad bomber has
a preference for Rube Goldberg type bomb triggers which make some
pretty neat scenes.  The bomb lore is pretty fascinating--"bouncing
betty's," and distilling explosive crystals with coffee filters.  They
killed a dog.  I dunno.  Read some other reviews for good stuff. I
don't wanna spend too much time remembering BLOWN AWAY.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     Bah.  BLOWN AWAY took itself too seriously and got bogged down in
needless plot that didn't add anything to the experience.  Go see SPEED
again if you want a mad-bomber action flick.  Go rent IN THE NAME OF
THE FATHER if you want an Irish/IRA flick.  But don't spend your summer
movie cash on BLOWN AWAY.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
 X watch it on cable            see once at full price
   watch it on videotape    see it several times - full and/or matinee
   see once as a matinee    see many times at full price</PRE>
