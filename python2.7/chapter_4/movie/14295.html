                                THE GOVERNESS
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>

YEAR:       1998

<PRE>                   RATING: *** 1/2 (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        Sandra Goldbacher's "The Governess" is, like Minnie Driver
herself, a creation of uncommon beauty.  Every frame of the film shimmers
with color and exquisite visuals, thanks to Ashley Rowe's incredible
cinematography and keen eye for detail.  The lovely score from Edward
Shearmur finds the proper tone for every scene, never once intruding into
the dialogue or serving as a phony emotional cue (ie, "This is a sad
moment, so we'll beat you over the head with weepy violins now.")  Even
if it contained nothing but these items, the movie would still be worth
a peek.</P>
<P>        Fortunately for us, it also contains one of the year's best
performances.  Rosina da Silva (Ms. Driver) is the educated, spirited
daughter of a wealthy Jewish merchant, living with her family in one of
London's Sephardic communities during the early nineteenth century.
Although content with life, Rosina sometimes feels constrained by the
demands imposed on her by Victorian etiquette ("Try not to look so tall,
dear," frets her mother).  Although she has no training, she dreams of
one day leaving home to become an actress, exposing her soul on the stage
for all the world to see.</P>
<P>        Her dream soon becomes reality, though not in the way she'd hoped.
After her father passes away unexpectedly, the family finds itself in
desperate need of money.  Rosina, the eldest daughter, decides to look
for a domestic service job to help the family struggle by, and she
eventually receives an offer to act as governess to young Christina
Cavendish (Florence Hoath) at the Cavendish family home in Scotland.  The
only catch: the devoutly Christian Cavendishs don't know that Rosina is
Jewish; if they did, she'd never be allowed to work for them.  Needing
the job, Rosina buries her heritage and invents a Gentile persona named
Mary Blackchurch.  If questioned about her heritage, she plans to tell
her employers that her olive skin is the result of the (fictional)
Italian blood she received from her mother's side of the family.  Thus
begins Rosina's acting career... though it's far from what she originally
had in mind.</P>
<P>        After arriving at the Cavendish home, Mary quickly becomes
enamored with her employer, Charles (Tom Wilkinson, last seen as the
grumpy foreman in "The Full Monty").  Highly intelligent, and charming in
his own fumbling way, Charles is working in an exciting new field known
as "photography," though he has not yet figured out how to keep an image
from fading mere moments after the picture is developed.  Rosina/Mary,
possessing an extensive knowledge of chemistry, begins to assist him in
his work.  Soon a strong bond forms between them, the ramifications of
which will change both of them forever.</P>
<P>        As usual, Minnie Driver devours her role, acting with such
skill and charisma that I forgot about everything in the world except the
story I was watching.  I wasn't looking at a movie screen; I was gazing
through a window into the nineteenth century, watching a beautiful,
intelligent young woman trying to sort out her own tormented emotions.
Ms. Driver was nominated for "Best Supporting Actress" for her work in
last year's "Good Will Hunting," though the award ultimately went to Kim
Basinger ("LA Confidential").  I predict another Oscar nomination, and
quite possibly a win, for her performance in "The Governess."</P>
<P>        The material could have been approached in a number of ways: as
a Great Statement about prejudice, a commentary on nineteenth-century
social classes, a depiction of the maternal relationship Rosina/Mary
develops with young Christina, a journey of female self-discovery, a
steamy historical romance, etc.  Director Sandra Goldbacher, however, has
chosen to include ALL these things in her film.  It's both the movie's
strength and biggest hindrance.</P>
<P>        Quite simply, there's a little too much story contained in "The
Governess"; at its conclusion, we're left with as many questions as
answers.  In particular, the final scene is maddeningly vague, and we're
left to ponder its meaning as the end credits roll.  It's not a fatal
flaw; the film still resonates with enough simple truth that it can't be
derailed so easily, but the less interesting subplots (such as the ones
involving Charles' son Henry) do cause the pace to drag from time to
time.</P>
<P>        One other (admittedly petty) thing concerned me: why does
Rosina/Mary need to go to Scotland for a job?  Is no one in London
hiring?  Or England, for that matter?  There may well be a good reason
for this; my knowledge of Victorian Europe is basically non-existant, but
the question nagged at me while watching the film.  If the script hadn't
made it so clear that Rosina was uncomfortable about taking a job so far
away from her family, I would've simply chalked it up to her spirit of
adventure.</P>
<P>        With that said, "The Governess" remains a film of rare beauty.
Its wonderful acting, cinematography and music place it a notch above
the usual historical costume drama.  Only an overly long running time
and a slightly unfocused script detract from its visual elegance.  This
is a fine debut; if Sandra Goldbacher can learn to prune her future work
a bit more liberally while keeping her direction and photography at this
level, she could very well emerge as one of Europe's most interesting
female directors.</P>
