<PRE>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 66</PRE>
<P>"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" was the second leg in
John Ford's 'Calvary trilogy', following "Fort Apache"
and preceding "Rio Grande" by one year.  Each film
starred John Wayne as an aging calvary officer
fighting Indian wars, with always entertaining
Victor McLagen in a supporting role.  James Warner
Berner was the writer for each film.</P>
<P>The plot has Wayne approaching his day of retiring
from the army in 1876.  However, Custer has just been
killed, and various indian tribes are united and
on the warpath.  Wayne has the chivalrous task
of leading a troop escorting two women to safety.
The young and pretty woman (Joanne Dru) flirts and
fights with Lieutenants John Agar and Ben Johnson,
while showing proper admiration for Wayne.</P>
<P>"Ribbon" is best known for its cinematography by
Winton Hoch, which deservedly snagged an Academy Award.
Much of the footage takes place in the Utah desert,
with picturesque rock and cloud formations.
The film has been restored to its former glory.</P>
<P>I can't speak so kindly of the score, which is
heavy-handed and blaring.  The same can be said of
the title track, and after the second or third reprise
you may hope that she takes the ribbon off.</P>
<P>My favorite scenes involve comic relief McLagan,
especially one where he single-handedly whips eight
men between drinks.  His presence certain can light
up a movie.</P>
<P>While "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" is a good film,
the story and script are too nondescript to merit
a higher grade.</P>
