<PRE>The General (1927)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 82</PRE>
<P>"The General" is a silent film starring Buster Keaton.
It is his most ambitious work, and probably his best.</P>
<P>"The General" takes place during the Civil War.  Keaton
is an Southern engineer who has two loves: his steam train 
and his girlfriend.  Because of his occupation, he is
refused conscription.  He loses his girlfriend, as her
family considers him a coward.</P>
<P>One day, Northern agents steal his beloved train.  In a long
chase scene, he follows the agents North in a second train.
He later manages to recapture the train and begins the
journey back South, but this time he is being chased, by
Northern soldiers in their steam train.  Keaton also gets
involved in a Civil War battle fought over a bridge.</P>
<P>All the Keaton hallmarks are in "The General."  He plays
an ordinary man forced by events to perform heroic feats
to win his true love (who, by an amazing coincidence, has
been taken hostage by the same Yankee agents who swiped
his train).  There are several excellent gags (my favorite
has Keaton having all sorts of problems loading lumber
on a train car) and one magnificent stunt (a steam train 
collapses a burning bridge).</P>
<P>But there are differences between this and other Keaton
films.  There is fine cinematography of steam trains
and Civil War armies in the field.  Keaton's love of
trains and railways is evident.  The extended "chase"
scenes build dramatic tension and are fascinating in
the multiple obstacles that Keaton's character must
overcome.</P>
<P>Some people consider Keaton to be as important a silent
film director as Chaplin.  I can't agree with this.
Several Chaplin films were clearly better than 
"The General". Chaplin's tramp character is more 
charismatic and had greater emotional range.  Also, 
Chaplin had a greater social awareness: he was trying to 
make a statement as well as to make you laugh.</P>
