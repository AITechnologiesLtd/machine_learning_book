A Simple Plan (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> A Simple Plan is not a simple movie to watch.</P>
<P> It's a film that, on its surface, shows the depths to which greed drives
some people. It is a story of moral corruption and murder.</P>
<P> Three men - Hank, his younger brother, Jacob, and Jacob's friend, Lou -
find a plane that has crashed deep in the woods. In the wreckage they
discover the body of the pilot plus a bag containing $4.4 million.</P>
<P> Realizing the money must be either stolen or drug money, they decide to
hide it until spring, then divide it three ways.</P>
<P> Of course, from the outset, everything goes awry. First, an innocent
farmer is accidentally killed when Jacob tries to stop him from entering
the woods. From that point, events escalate, and the body count rises.</P>
<P> But the question you are left to answer is: Were these good people to
begin with who were corrupted by the discovery of the money? Or, were they
morally weak and was the discovery the catalyst that unleashed their baser
instincts?</P>
<P> Hank (Bill Paxton) seems to be a decent guy. He has a boring job at the
feed store, and a loving, pregnant wife (Bridget Fonda) at home. Hank is
the practical individual. He's the one who stashes the money and devises
the plan to keep it hidden until after the snows melt.</P>
<P> All his level-headedness, however, cannot halt the freight train of
disaster that unfolds once he conceals the money.</P>
<P> The unemployed Lou (Brent Briscoe) is a big-mouth, drunken lout who is
eager to get his share of the loot immediately.</P>
<P> The moral core of the film is anchored by Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton). Also
unemployed, Jacob is a bit dim-witted, usually going along with whoever
devised the latest plan.</P>
<P> Jacob, though, wants to use his share of the money to buy back and restore
the family's farm, lost after their parents' death.</P>
<P> One lie builds upon another as the trio find it more and more difficult to
contain their secret.</P>
<P> Hank loses his moral compass, rationalizing the violence that ensues.</P>
<P> One problem with the film, adapted by Scott B. Smith from his novel, is
the character of Sarah, Hank's wife.</P>
<P> Her transformation from a decent woman appalled by her husband's actions
into a greedy, grasping harridan is too sudden and inexplicable.</P>
<P> Director Sam Raimi, best known for his horror outings such as The Evil
Dead, Army of Darkness and Darkman, uses the cold and isolation of the area
to dominate the film. You feel the breath of the characters as they
contrive their misbegotten plans and watch in horror as those dreams slowly
disintegrate.</P>
<P> A Simple Plan is a disturbing movie. The characters gain your sympathy
while they simultaneously appall you. A Simple Plan is a film that
demonstrates how weak the moral fiber can be when it is severely tested.</P>
