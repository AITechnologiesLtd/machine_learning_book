WHAT'S COOKING?
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Like visual crib notes for reviewers, the opening to Gurinder Chadha's 
WHAT'S COOKING? sweetly and concisely summarizes the movie's message.  
As the national anthem plays in the background, a turkey slowly comes 
into focus.  The camera pulls back to show us that the turkey is part of 
a Thanksgiving meal in a Norman Rockwell-style painting on the side of 
an L.A. city bus.  We then cut to the multi-ethnic tapestry of life 
inside the bus.  </P>
<P>Set at the quintessential American holiday, Thanksgiving, the movie 
celebrates our country's melting pot tradition.  The warm-hearted but 
completely forgettable WHAT'S COOKING? would have been more 
appropriately released as a television movie for the holiday season.  </P>
<P>Four large families -- one black, one Vietnamese, one Jewish and one 
Latino -- gather for Thanksgiving in their homes on opposite corners of 
a street in a middle-class LA neighborhood.  Taken together, the 
families become the dots in a large pointillism canvas.  Their numerous 
stories are little more than clichés on their own, but taken together 
they form a handsome portrait of American life.</P>
<P>The extensive ensemble cast includes Alfre Woodard, Dennis Haysbert, Ann 
Weldon, Mercedes Ruehl, Maria Carmen, Victor Rivers, Douglas Spain, A 
Martinez, Lainie Kazan, Maury Chaykin, Kyra Sedgwick, Julianna 
Margulies, Estelle Harris, Joan Chen,  Will Yun Lee, Kristy Wu and Jimmy 
Pham.  Each actor gets a brief time on stage, but none gets a 
well-developed character.  Loud, warm-hearted music fills in the gaps 
left by the erratic story.  </P>
<P>As in LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE and other motion pictures that celebrate 
the joy of cooking, WHAT'S COOKING? features significant amounts of food 
photography.  Jong Lin's lensing of the food is quite respectable and 
colorful but doesn't have the mouth-watering appeal of most food films.  
Still, this is certainly the longest product placement ever for 
America's turkey breeders.  </P>
<P>As the families have their small squabbles and discussions prior to and 
during their big culinary events, their conversations never amount to 
much nor are they intended to.  This is a mood piece that intends mainly 
to evoke a warm nostalgic feeling in the viewers, which it does quite 
successfully.  Even if WHAT'S COOKING? is little more than an ephemeral 
treat, it is a relatively flawless one.  Save one shamelessly 
manipulative scene which the studio has specifically asked critics not 
to reveal, there isn't anything wrong with it.  WHAT'S COOKING? is a 
movie that conjures up respectful, but not enthusiastic adjectives.  
It's a nice, pleasant but inconsequential picture.  </P>
<P>WHAT'S COOKING? runs 1:46.  It is rated PG-13 for some sexuality, brief 
language and a perilous situation and would be acceptable for kids 
around 10 or 11 and up.</P>
