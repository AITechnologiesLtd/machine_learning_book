                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Bill Mitchell (Kevin Kline) is the forty-forth President of the
United States.  On a night when he wants to engage in an
away-from-the-office fling with one of his female assistants, he
arranges for Dave (also played by Kevin Kline), his virtual double, to
impersonate him.  Unfortunately, during the course of his night of
passion, the President has a massive stroke that leaves him in a coma.
Two of his aides (Frank Langella and Kevin Dunn), unwilling to give up
the power they have amassed during Mitchell's term, persuade Dave to
stay on and continue his masquerade for an undetermined period of
time.  He agrees and his subsequent performance is good enough to fool
even the First Lady (Sigourney Weaver).  Problems begin, however, when
Dave starts to act like a leader--and a compassionate one at
that--instead of the puppet that his Chief of Staff wants him to be.</P>
<P>     As far as Hollywood is concerned, Ivan Reitman has the Midas
Touch.  Not only do his films deliver big laughs to the audience, but
they bring in lots of money to the production companies.  His string of
hits is impressive, including such titles as ANIMAL HOUSE (which he
produced but did not direct), GHOSTBUSTERS I and II (produced and
directed), TWINS (produced and directed), and KINDERGARTEN COP
(produced and directed).  He was also responsible for last years
profitable-but-moronic animal film BEETHOVEN.</P>
<P>     DAVE is a departure for Reitman.  The comedy of this film takes a
more adult path than anything he's done in the past.  Nevertheless,
DAVE is proof that predictable movies with only a marginally original
premise can still be tremendous fun.  Reitman, along with screenwriter
Gary Ross (BIG), have fashioned a highly-enjoyable, fresh, and
energetic motion picture that even the most hard-bitten cynic would be
hard-pressed to condemn.  DAVE isn't just a good movie; it's an
excellent one.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the comedy in DAVE works, due in part to the
performances of a cast of veterans.  Kevin Kline shows a marvelous
sense of comic timing and delivery, Sigourney Weaver does a good job
playing her role straight, Frank Langella is perfectly over-the-top as
the "frothing at the mouth" villain, and Ving Rhames delivers a deadpan
performance as a no-nonsense Secret Service Agent.</P>
<P>     There's time for a political message or two, but these are all
kept low-key and never allowed to interfere with the pacing of the
film.  DAVE is first and foremost a comedy, and drama is only allowed
to interfere on those rare occasions when it's absolutely needed.</P>
<P>     The list of cameos for this film range from Arnold Schwarzenegger
to Tip O'Neil, with about three dozen Washington insiders, celebrities,
and Senators in between.  What THE PLAYER did for Hollywood, DAVE does
for America's capital.  Larry King and Jay Leno have appearances, and
Oliver Stone gets to poke fun at his image by pontificating about a
conspiracy he senses to be brewing at the summit of the United States'
governmental pyramid.</P>
<P>     DAVE is a film that is so well-crafted that its obvious
shortcomings are easily overlooked.  Likeability overcomes
originality.  This isn't a movie where we want a twisty, complex plot
filled with unexpected revelations.  The familiar territory of DAVE's
story is perfect for the subject matter.  Just a shade away from
following a formula, the film is comfortable without ever being dull.
DAVE is pure, unfettered entertainment--something that's been
all-too-rare on movie screens thus far in 1993.</P>
