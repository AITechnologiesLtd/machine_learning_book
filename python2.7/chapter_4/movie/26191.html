GIRLFIGHT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>One more fight at school and Diana, played with sullen intensity by 
newcomer Michelle Rodriguez, will be expelled.  Living in a Brooklyn 
ghetto and with a dead-end life, Diana decides to channel her energy 
into boxing at the gym like her brother (Ray Santiago).</P>
<P>Once she begins to fight, the angry and depressed Diana begins to find 
some relief from her surroundings.  Although the seedy gym, The Brooklyn 
Boys' Club, where she trains is even more rundown than the miniscule 
apartment she shares with her father (Paul Calderon) and brother, she 
gets the fulfillment from her sport that she has never gotten from 
school.  Rodriguez's impressive acting debut, however, is the only real 
reason to see GIRLFIGHT.</P>
<P>Although first-time writer and director Karyn Kusama spent 5 years 
preparing this project, the script is significantly underdeveloped and 
the director sets a lethargic pace.  Think of the film as ROCKY ON 
VALIUM.  There's lots of brooding teenage angst, but remarkably little 
ever happens.  Only in a dramatic confrontation scene with her father, 
in which she tells him, "Everything I know about losing I learned from 
you, Dad," does the movie have much emotional impact.</P>
<P>The picture follows a completely formulaic arc toward the big concluding 
match.  The gym features lots of clichéd signs ("Champions are made not 
born." "Winners never quit, and quitters never win."), even though the 
movie wants badly to be taken as something more than another Rocky 
Balboa story.  Nevertheless, the movie is one-idea story -- girl rather 
than boy as young boxer -- that never gets fleshed out beyond its 
concept.</P>
<P>Diana's boyfriend is a handsome fighter named Adrian (Santiago Douglas).  
Want to bet on whom she boxes in the concluding match?  Want to bet who 
is going to win?</P>
<P>The only surprise is how the final fight is edited.  After waiting for 
an entire movie for it come alive, the ending bout happens so fast that, 
if you blink a few times, you'll miss it.  I told actor Santiago 
Douglas, who was at our screening, that I did not like the way it was 
edited down to almost nothing.  He rolled his eyes and said only, "I 
agree. I agree."</P>
<P>GIRLFIGHT runs 1:50.  It is rated R for language and would be acceptable 
for teenagers.</P>
