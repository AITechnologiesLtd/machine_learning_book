<PRE>WAYDOWNTOWN
-----------</PRE>
<P>In downtown Calgary, a complex of shopping malls, offices and
apartments are interconnected via glass walkways for block after city block.
Five wildly different office colleagues have wagered a month's salary that 
whoever can stay inside the longest wins the pot in cowriter (with James 
Martin)/director Gary Burns' "waydowntown."</P>
<P>Playing in relative real time over the course of a lunch hour on
the 24th day of the bet, we first meet Tom (Fab Filipo), the new guy in the 
office, a marijuana smoking Goth and the bet's chief architect.  Tom takes
pleasure in rattling go-getter Sandra (Marya Delver) with creepy facts about
recycled air, while growing somewhat concerned with the mental health
of 'Sadly I'm' Brad (Don McKellar, "Last Night"), a twenty year office
veteran.  Randy (Tobias Godson) informs Tom that Curt (Gordon Currie), the
engaged-to-be-married-for-two-years office lothario, won a bet like this 
before, so Tom nudges Curt towards easy prey - the also engaged, mousy clerk
Vicki (Jennifer Clement).</P>
<P>Tom's been tasked with picking up a gift for the firm's octogenarian owner, 
Mr. Mather (Harris Hart), but is consistently kept off course by one comic
incident after another.  He keeps crossing paths with Sandra, who's just been 
given the important job of following Mather during lunch hour because he's
a kleptomaniac.  Tom becomes troubled by his ethics when he won't go outside
to check on the possible suicide he may have caused while Sandra manically
steals perfumed magazine inserts which she uses like a gas mask.  Randy hangs 
out with a shopping mall security guard, commenting on the passers-by.  Back
in the office, while the receptionist eavesdrops on Curt and Vickie's bathroom</P>
<P>encounter, Brad escalates from stapling himself with motivational mottos
('Don't compromise - prioritize') to dancing ever closer to the glass windows
clutching a marble-filled bottle. By film's end, all five will have shifted
their priorities when they realize where their bet as led them.</P>
<P>Martin and Burns' script is amusing and often inventive, although some
choices,
such as making Mather's gift a $3,500 crystal vase, are nonsensically plot 
driven.  Visually, "waydowntown" is more like a music video than a theatrical
film, with Tom frequently flying around corridors like the super heroes he
sees
darting around corners.  We see his imaginings of an arch villain taking
hostage the enclosed inner city visualized like a floating snow globe.  The
office interiors look like temporary structures and are photographed with no
imagination.  Use of a French language cover of the Petulia Clark hit
"Downtown" is a witty acknowledgement of its Canadian location.</P>
<P>"waydowntown" joins the likes of "Office Space" and "Haiku Tunnel" in the
genre of cubie comedy.  It's a cute flick, but its small screen look
makes it better suited for video.</P>
