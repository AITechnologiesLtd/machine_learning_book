Company Man</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>This little film sure tries hard to be silly. Unfortunately, most hits 
strike wide of funny bone central. It's a Marx brother's script with a 
Stan Laurel where a Groucho should have been. </P>
<P>Breaking onto the screen with "Secret Agent Man" rocking the sound 
track, the mood is set for a 1960's spy spoof. Mild-mannered 
schoolteacher Allen Quimp stumbles into spy mode in an attempt to quell 
his hounding spouse who has much higher aspirations for him than 
grammar. Sigourney Weaver does an average job of playing her Olive Oyl 
role with a bit of a sting, "Everything would be better if you just, I 
don't know, died." </P>
<P>Early on, Quimp bumps into, and haphazardly aids in the defection of, a 
famous Russian gymnast very well played by Ryan Phillippe for about 3 
minutes before he defects from the film, "You want to leave Russia just 
when you're winning the space race?" This event Forest Gumps Quimp into 
actual assignments with the CIA. Eventually, Quimp finds himself smack 
dab in the middle of the Bay of Pigs, Cuba. </P>
<P>I'm not quite sure why this film misses, it moves well and has high 
energy; perhaps it's the casting. I'd have recruited Paul Giamatti from 
"Duets" for the lead and Shelly Duvall as the pushy wife. Perhaps Jon 
Favreau or someone really dangerous like Harvey Keitel (or even Denis 
Leary) could have nailed the crazed "kill communism" soldier role. </P>
<P>Leary is fine as an intermediary agent, "I've only started one sentence 
since you've been in town and you've been correcting it ever since!" </P>
<P>Good lines like that get buried in throwaways like, "Just because you're 
a revolutionary, doesn't mean you have to be revolting." </P>
<P>Lots of energy and movement, unfortunately little amusement. </P>
