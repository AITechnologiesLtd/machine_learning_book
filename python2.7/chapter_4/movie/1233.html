<PRE>                          THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE
                       A film review by Myra Van Inwegen
                        Copyright 1992 Myra Van Inwegen</PRE>
<P>     I saw THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERIONIQUE about a week and a half ago and
figured that while I was writing reviews I might as well write about
this one too.</P>
<P>     The basic idea is this: there are two women, Veronika in Poland and
Veronique in France, whose lives are somehow connected.  In addition to
looking a lot alike and having similar lives and talents, each feels that
she has a counterpart somewhere in the world although they have never
met (they did come close enough to see each other once).  Also I found
it amusing that Veronika's aunt looks a lot like Veronique's Dad.  But
anyway...</P>
<P>     I felt that the idea of the movie was interesting, but there wasn't
enough in the actual film to hold my attention.  There was some
interesting photography, but it was insufficient to save the movie by
itself.  It moved very slowly, and though things happened I was left
with the strange impression that nothing very important occurred.  Now I
have no complaint about slow-moving films as long as I find something to
hold my interest, but I couldn't find it in this movie.  It was a bit
confusing and seemed mysterious for no apparent reason.</P>
<P>     Suffice to say that I didn't like it much.  But, to present an
opposing view, the friend that I went with liked it, enough that he
would like to see it again to understand it better.  Evidently it gave
him plenty enough food for thought, though it left me still hungry.</P>
