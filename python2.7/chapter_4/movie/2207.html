                       A film review by Jason John Seaver

<P>     Combine KNIGHT RIDER 2000 and CROCODILE DUNDEE with a tiny bit of
BRAVE NEW WORLD, and the result will, for better or worse, be something
like Silver Pictures' new action comedy, DEMOLITION MAN.  In this case,
it manages to be better than several of its components, although the
writers have an unfortunate tendency to play it safe a little too
often.</P>
<P>     The movie opens in 1996 as LAPD sergeant John "Demolition Man"
Spartan heads into his final confrontation with Simon Phoenix, a
sociopathic criminal he's been trying to collar for two years.  Though
Phoenix is captured, the warehouse he was using as his headquarters is
completely destroyed, and more than twenty hostages are found dead in
the wreckage.  Both men are sentenced to cryo-prison, where they will
be placed in suspended animation, having rehabilitation work fed
directly into their minds.</P>
<P>     Thirty-six years later, Phoenix escapes when thawed out for a
parole hearing.  Within two hours he's killed seventeen people; a
development for which the San Angeles (much of LA was leveled by "the
big one of 2010," LA and several other cities have become the idyllic
San Angeles metroplex) Police Department, which hasn't had to deal with
a "Murder Death Kill" in twenty years, is woefully unprepared.
Luckily, the cop who brought Phoenix in last time is in cold
storage....</P>
<P>     The producers must be congratulated for going out on a limb here.
While people would have paid to see a movie that was little more than a
two-hour shootout between Stallone and Snipes, the movie has a
satirical bent.  It pokes fun at formulaic action movies--someone
actually comments on a one-liner thrown out in the middle of a fight,
and when Spartan gets angry at being regarded as some sort of
action-movie stereotype, the speaker simply switches him from the
"macho he-man" stereotype to the "brooding loner" ideal.  The dwindling
American attention span has been extrapolated to where fifteen-second
commercials are the most popular music.  The fear of intimacy being
created in the AIDS era has extended to the point where nobody ever
touches each other, not even to shake hands.  What some observers see
as a disturbing trend to sacrifice freedom for safety in America today
is pervasive.  The names "Spartan" and "Phoenix" actually seem to be
chosen with something in mind, and an "underground" movement is to be
taken literally.  Stallone and Snipes look like photographic negatives
of each other early on in the movie.</P>
<P>     However, many of the interesting questions that could be raised in
this movie are given lightweight treatment.  Spartan had a wife and
daughter, and though his spouse's death is one of the first things he
learns when being revived, he doesn't seem to react much.  Spartan
mentions a nightmare that lasted thirty years, and Phoenix had a
similar experience, but little is made out of it.  And though at least
some explanation is offered for the radical changes in society (better
than with most movies of this genre, most recently typified by
Fortress), it doesn't quite seem adequate.  And is the sterile
environment limited to San Angeles, or does it extend to all of
California/ the United States/North America/western civilization/the
world?  Also, it would seem that Spartan has more in common with
Phoenix than anyone else in this future, but little is done with this.</P>
<P>     The action is well-shot, and the special effects are pretty
seemless.  They even showed a metric temperature reading that didn't
say "degrees Kelvin," although the object in question was a 1 K without
any visible insulation.  The acting is tolerable.  Stallone, though
somewhat wooden, has learned a lot about playing the straight man from
his brief foray into comedy, and pulls off his lines here without
embarrassment, and actually managing to elicit quite a few laughs.
Wesley Snipes throws caution to the wind as Simon Phoenix with an
over-the-top portrayal of the insane criminal mastermind.  Bullock is
fairly poor, but it fits with the character she plays.  Hawthorne is
passable, and half of Denis Leary's four scenes are more or less
carried by material straight out of his stand-up routine (he even
starts pacing back and forth).  Rob Schnieder from Saturday Night Live
also shows up as a character who might have escaped from an SNL skit
about bureaucrats you want to punch out on sight.</P>
<P>     DEMOLITION MAN falls in the 7.0-7.5 range.  It's more clever than
the average action movie, but missed several opportunities.</P>
