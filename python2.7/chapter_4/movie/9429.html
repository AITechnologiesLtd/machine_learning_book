I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997)  ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Also known as, I KNOW WHAT MOVIE I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN LAST NIGHT. 
Kevin Williamson got the world on a platter when the horror comedy 
he wrote, SCREAM, grossed more than $100 million with its 
willingness to flip the bird to horror cliches while at the same time 
embracing them. Now comes Williamson's follow-up, I KNOW WHAT 
YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which skips the ironic humor and just 
sticks with the cliches instead. I can hardly wait for SCREAM 2.</P>
<P>        Williamson gives us four main characters straight from the 
horror mold. There's brooding Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt, filling the 
Williamson quota of one beautiful "Party of Five" girl in every movie 
he writes -- now that I know Neve Campbell and Hewitt are both on 
the same show I might have to make it a party of six every week), the 
smart, responsible one. On the opposite end is Helen (Sarah Michelle 
Gellar, TV's vampire slayer Buffy), the town beauty queen, in the 
movie to scream and show off cleavage. Her boyfriend is Barry (Ryan 
Phillipe), football quarterback and all-around stud. Rounding out the 
group is Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Hewitt's boyfriend and the artistic, 
freakish type.</P>
<P>        We meet these four on the fourth of July, during their South 
Carolina fishing town's big celebration. They all drink, party and 
make out like all horror movie teens do, and are on their way home 
when disaster strikes. A man runs into the path of their car and gets 
creamed. Chaos ensues, with Ray not wanting to go to prison, Billy 
drunk and revealing psychotic tendencies and Hewitt trying to talk 
some reason into them. The decision is made to dump the body in the 
river, and they consent, promising they'll take the secret to their 
graves.</P>
<P>        But, and this should come as absolutely no surprise, 
someone knows what they did last summer. Julie gets a note with 
nothing but the movie's title written on it (talk about shameless self-
promotion!) when she comes home from college next year. As the 
guilty party, she rounds up the other three, who are still languishing 
around town, and they try to figure out what's going on. Here's what's 
going on -- there's a slasher killer on the loose, someone who dresses 
up in a fisherman's slicker and kills people with a meat hook. This is 
the person who knows what they did last summer, and you'd think 
these kids would just send him a note back saying, "I know what 
you're doing right now." I mean, the guy's a freakin' murderer.</P>
<P>        Like SCREAM, Williamson tries to make I KNOW WHAT YOU 
DID LAST SUMMER into a murder mystery. There are three main 
suspects -- David from "Roseanne," who has a killer crush on Julie 
(get in line, there, buddy), Helen's jealous older sister (Bridgette 
Wilson, who isn't convincing because she's actually prettier than her 
sister) and the dead guy's sister (Ellen's better half, Anne Heche, who 
is even more butch and white trash than usual here). None of this is 
the least bit well constructed and is resolved in an even more 
disappointing fashion.</P>
<P>        There's not a whole lot to like in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST 
SUMMER, but I tried my hardest. Aside from some very nice Hewitt 
wardrobing (I never wanted so much to be a shirt two sizes too small) 
and a few clever kill scenes, this movie has none of the original 
dialogue, charm or humor of SCREAM. And very little suspense. Its 
clone characters, lame murder mystery and constantly-pulsing "hip" 
soundtrack make this the very kind of movie SCREAM so mercilessly 
satired. And the door is left wide open for a sequel. I know what 
they're doing _next_ summer...</P>
