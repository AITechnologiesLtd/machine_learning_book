<P>I was born during a time when Charles Chaplin was the most important part of
film, when you were a kid growing up.  And the intelectual world around me,
also liked him for other reasons, most of them with political overtones.</P>
<P>This film, joins both, and makes a truly inspirational film, about a legend,
who made mistakes, but also gave us so much more, that we can never measure
in the scale of enjoyment.  Much of his comedy was precious.  And he did not
repeat himself, as did most of those around him.  This bit does not go by
un-noticed by the director.</P>
<P>Charles Chaplin started in the early days, in the Mack Sennett stuff, as a
bit part actor.  He soon graduated to his own films, and even though he had
some terrible times, the competition for the dollar was very tough, and the
depression was just arriving, he managed to give Hollywood a dignity which
it lacked.  The Busby Berkley
stuffs looked stupid when people couldn't afford a bowl of soup.  The Mack
Sennett stuff needed money.  But Charles just did his own little films, even
with little budget, and busted out through the depression like the no one in
Hollywood could.  And he became the ultimate symbol of what the depression
is really like, with his short THE TRAMP.</P>
<P>But Charles' life wasn't simple.  From the early days when he felt compelled
to live a slight fantasy, until he learned of a lie, he kept himself a
constant list of ladies in waiting, and some of them were famous for trying
to hook rich people in those days ( several scandals ).  He barely escaped
one himself.  But his art form was better than ever.</P>
<P>In enter, the portion of his life he would rather forget.  The FBI in those
days, had no intrigue, except to try and snoop out anyone that was
un-American, or whomever, J. Edgar Hoover felt should be bothered.</P>
<P>But the real art survives, and little can touch it, and a small time hero
like Hoover can never touch it.  They manage to pull off an anti American
fiasco, but the whole thing looms stupid and the film makers are having a
heyday with the government's stupidity and waste of funds.</P>
<P>The film ends, with the famous special OSCAR that Charles Chaplin was given
for his tremendous efforts, specially during a time when it appears that all
was lost.  Charles may have been, but the tramp was not.</P>
<P>Superb performances in this film include Robert Downey Jr as Chaplin, and
Dan Aykroyd as Mack Sennett, and even Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks.  The
surprise bit is the grand-daughter ( Geraldine Chaplin )
playing grandma, who tried so hard, to help their sons withstand so much
during such hard times.</P>
<P>Lovingly directed, with a respect that is not always found in much film
making these days, this longish film is a treat.  Visually, story wise, and
just about at any turn.  It is told in retrospect, as a bit of a memory, by
an aging Charles who is telling one of his biographers ( Anthony Hopkins )
about some of the events in his life. The biographer is disappointed that
there are many holes in the tale, of moments that are obviously buried, and
Charles does not wish to discuss them. like his father, and some of his more
notorious affairs.</P>
<P>But the film is a great tribute to one of the greatest artists the 20th
century has ever seen on film.  He may not have been perfect for himself, or
many, but he made it perfect for the audience, who just howled, and bowled
over, such tremendously funny material.</P>
<P>This film is worthy of all the accolades it ever got, and then some.</P>
