<PRE>                              THE CUTTING EDGE
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Jaye Mathisen
                        Copyright 1993 Jaye Mathisen</PRE>
<PRE>     Summary:
          An ex-hockey player, and a screwed-up figure
          skater team up to go for the Olympic gold medal in
          pairs figure skating.</PRE>
<P>A brief sidenote:
    [I seem to be finding quite a few movies recently that while
    not epics of modern filmmaking, seem to be quite enjoyable.  I
    call them my "pick-me-up" movies, and when I'm looking for
    a movie that's not too heavy, but fun, I turn to some of these.
    So I thought I'd toss a few reviews out, in case you haven't
    caught these.  None of 'em are box-office smashes, but I find
    them enjoyable.]</P>
<P>     D. B. Sweeney plays ex-hockey amateur star Doug Dorsey, who gets
his eye injured in the 1988 winter Olympics, and can no longer play
competitive hockey.  Moira Kelly is Kate Mosely, an Olympic medalist
wanna-be, but who's earned a nasty reputation as the Ice Bitch, for her
lousy attitude.</P>
<P>     As to plot, there's not much there.  Kate can't find a male partner
to skate with, and so her coach in a last ditch effort, contacts Doug,
to see if he'd be willing to make the attempt.  He is, they do, there's
conflict, resolution, and an ending with everybody happy and Doug and
Kate in love.</P>
<P>     The film is intended to be a love story, built around skating,
probably to tie in to the Olympic skating craze.  It's not a great love
story, it's a good love story.  Moira Kelly has the bitch part down pat,
her facial expressions of disgust towards D. B. and some of his antics
are priceless.</P>
<P>Rating:
     3 stars out of 4.  There is some nice camera work in taping
     some of the skating, especially all the fancy footwork, but
     nothing amazing.  It looks like Kelly and Sweeney did a fair
     amount of skating, although certainly not all the stunt
     skating.</P>
<PRE>Enjoyability rating:
     4 stars out of 4.  This is one of the movies that kind of
     gives me for whatever reason, a warm fuzzy.  My wife looked
     at me kind of cockeyed when I mentioned it, but she enjoyed
     the show too.  If you're expecting epic greatness, stay
     away from it.  If you want something light, with a moderate
     dose of romance, and a sappy ending, then this will fill
     the bill.</PRE>
