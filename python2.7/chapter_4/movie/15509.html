<PRE>WITHOUT LIMITS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Without Limits is the second biopic of Olympic track athlete Steve
Prefontaine (following last year's Prefontaine). Both films hit all the
same bases, and have about the same effect:  a modest appreciation, but
little understanding of the man.</P>
<P>Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup) is introduced through the eyes of
college scouts.  "Pre" is the most sought after high school runner in
the country, and every prestigious college can't wait to recruit him.
However, Pre has his sights on the University of Oregon, where the
legendary Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland) coaches.</P>
<P>The film doesn't display a very high opinion of running coaches.
Bowerman's only advice to Prefontaine is to avoid "front running", a bad
habit which Pre refuses to break, and with which he wins.  Aside from
that, the grand strategy in this film seems to simply be: run faster.</P>
<P>The film follows Pre, both as a collegiate athlete, an olympian, and
later as an "amateur" athlete.  Through it all, he's the consummate
rebel. He never wants to simply run with the crowd...he always wants to
lead the pack.</P>
<P>More than the previous Prefontaine biopic, Prefontaine, Without Limits
gets us on a personal level with Steve Prefontaine.  It's too bad the
Pre Without Limits shows us isn't all that interesting. He's just
another romanticized version of the "doomed athlete".  We never find out
what makes him tick...or why he was important enough to merit two movies
about his life.</P>
<P>Billy Crudup plays Pre with all the spit and polish deserving a
wonder-boy athlete. There are no rough edges, yet no real defining
character distinctions, either. Donald Sutherland fares better as his
coach, though at times he seems like he's starring in a Nike commercial
(a company with which the real life Bowerman was involved).</P>
<P>The story itself is more or less straightforward, but there are odd
little gaps here and there.  They're kind of like holes in memory...it
doesn't seem like anything is missing, but things don't quite flow
right.  Whether this was the filmmakers' intent, or just the result of
some sloppy editing, the result is a vague outline of the events in
Pre's life, rather than a clear picture.</P>
<P>Without Limits is not completely satisfying.  But it does manage to
conjure up a sense of respect for an athlete who, after nearly 30 years,
has likely faded from most memories.</P>
