<P>     FEAR OF A BLACK HAT is the 1990s version of THIS IS SPINAL TAP,
skewering rap music on the same stake that Rob Reiner used to impale
heavy metal.  For three-quarter of its running length, this is a first-
rate parody of the most bawdy kind.  It is unapologetically politically
incorrect, and some of the biggest laughs come at the most off-color
jokes.  There's virtually no stone in the world of rap music left
unturned by BLACK HAT, which has something to say about everything from
drug dealing and gun violence to the new wave of black film directors.</P>
<P>     As was the case with SPINAL TAP, the premise behind FEAR OF A
BLACK HAT is that someone is doing a documentary.  In this case, the
filmmaker is a graduate student in sociology, Nina Blackburn (Kasi
Lemmons), whose has decided to focus her doctoral dissertation on the
rap musical culture.  The group she chooses is NWH (Niggaz With Hats),
comprised of the fast-talking leader Ice Cold (Rusty Cundieff), the
ultra-violent Tasty-Taste (Larry B. Scott), and the spiritual Tone Def
(Mark Christopher Lawrence).</P>
<P>     The film opens with a warning to the audience that FEAR OF A BLACK
HAT will make use of a number of potentially offensive terms, but does
not intend to do so gratuitously.  It then repeats each of those words
several times, and prints them on the screen for good measure.  From
this moment on, we know that we're in the hands of an accomplished
satirist, and the result is predictably better than other feeble
efforts such as CB4 and those elements of the WAYNE'S WORLD movies
which tried something similar.</P>
<P>     The documentary-within-the-movie starts by interviewing the
members of NWH.  These three, who come from "Tough Neighborhood, USA,"
give their views on why it's never a good idea to smile.  In the
process, we learn that Tasty-Taste was once a "pharmaceutical
distributor"--but they're not going to get into that.</P>
<P>     From that point on, the jokes come faster than the uses of the
word <*term censored*>.  The parodies of rap videos are
inspired--writer/director Rusty Cundieff injects an MTV-like glamor,
but makes sure that each possesses all sorts of excesses.  With titles
like "Guerrillas in the Midst" and "My Peanuts" with lyrics that will
not be reprinted here, Cundieff has found rich ground to hoe.</P>
<P>     Almost every facet of the rap culture gets similar treatment.
Security guards at a concert are shown doing amazingly "thorough" gun
searches.  NWH becomes the target of an anti-obscenity campaign.  Their
first manager gets gunned down in a dispute between opposing rap
groups.  A marquee in Chicago refuses to use the word "Niggaz," so it
calls NWH "Negroes With Hats."</P>
<P>     Certain well-known personalities don't escape Cundieff's
attention, either.  There's a white rapper named Vanilla Sherbert and
an "M.C. Slammer" who wants to excise "M.C."  An all-girl group is
called Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. ("We have four spices.")
Then there's Jike Springleton (hmm ... I wonder which two prominent
directors he could represent?), the black filmmaker who gives Ice Cold
his feature film debut.</P>
<P>     The humor of FEAR OF A BLACK HAT rolls along nicely for about an
hour before beginning to sputter and fizzle.  The last quarter of the
movie is uneven, and seems like an attempt to stretch a concept beyond
its natural playing time.  There aren't many notable moments in the
final twenty minutes until the end credits start scrolling.</P>
<P>     Using parody as its means, FEAR OF A BLACK HAT has a lot to say
about the exploitation that surrounds the rap music business.  This
movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced, but it is (for the
most part) highly entertaining.  For those who have been waiting for a
sequel to SPINAL TAP, this may be the best alternative.</P>
