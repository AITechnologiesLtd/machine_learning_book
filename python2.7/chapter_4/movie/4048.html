<PRE>ANGUS
=====</PRE>
<P>     The title character in this coming-of-age flick is a very large
(and very smart) high schooler with two primary problems:  a tremendous
crush on a cheerleader and a lifelong feud with her boyfriend, the
school's star quarterback.  In a plot twist reminiscent of CARRIE, fat
boy and blondie are unexpectedly named King and Queen of the prom and
you can guess what's planned to happen next.</P>
<P>     Though as lumpy as its hero, ANGUS has a soft heart and an even
sweeter message.  Newcomer Charlie Talbert, who plays the lad, is an
affable presence, even if he lisps a bit much.  Also on hand is Kathy
Bates, as Mom, and George C. Scott as the narcoleptic grandfather whose
sole advice to his `son is "screw `em."  Great soundtrack, too.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>HACKERS
=======</PRE>
<P>     "Hack the world!"  That's the credo of a gang of young cyberpunks
who find themselves doing damage control after one of them
steals-for-fun a sensitive corporate file with potentially ecologically
disastrous results.  As one character in the movie notes, "there is no
right and wrong, only fun and boring."  [The pocket-protected audience
nods in silent approval.]</P>
<P>     Director Ian Sofely (BACKBEAT) gives the film a grungy, lived-in
look that's very inviting.  As are the fresh faces in the cast,
including Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie.  (Look closely and you
can see the resemblance between Jolie and her father, Jon Voight.  What
a find!  And, yes, that's Alberta Watson of SPANKING THE MONKEY fame
playing the mother!)</P>
<P>     The "hacking" sequences are unusual.  Sofely opts for imagery
instead of explanation; dazzling VR instead of a line-by-line (or
window-by- window) demonstration of the craft.  Sure, there's not a
byte of believable technology here--the story is set some
not-too-far-future where laptops can do *anything*--but the characters
are strong.  What a concept, a character-driven "computer movie."</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>SAFE
====</PRE>
<P>     Writer/director Todd Haynes' intriguing drama about a woman
suffering from "environmental illness" is maddening for two reasons.
First is the pace, which is s-l-o-w.  SAFE moves at about half-speed.
More time to reflect?  Perhaps.  More chances to become restless?
Yes.  The second method for my madness is Hayne's relentless ambiguity
towards his subject.  We're given the facts of the case--a housewife
(Julianne Moore) becomes increasingly "allergic" to her
surroundings--and nothing more.  Haynes invites us to draw our own
conclusion, but just a *little* bit of opposing viewpoint would be
nice.  At least *one* character who could stand up and say "what a
bunch of New Age bunk!"</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
<PRE>SEVEN
=====</PRE>
<P>     Three years after his underrated directorial debut on ALIEN 3,
music-video whiz David Fincher is back with an equally engaging
thriller about an ingenious serial killer stalking a nameless American
city.  The detectives on the case are played by Morgan Freeman (the
veteran) and Brad Pitt (the rookie).  Their quarry is a sermonizing
killer who's preaching through imaginative variations on the seven
deadly sins.</P>
<P>     Atmosphere is everything in Fincher's house of horrors.  Constant
rain, dismal lighting, and amplified sound effects all work to weary
effect.  As does the queasy subject matter.  (Though the gore is kept
to a minimum, you'll know very early if you have the stomach for
this.)  The methodical pace may also be off-putting to some.  SEVEN
requires patience.  Anxious viewers may find themselves straining their
chains much in the same manner that Pitt's gung-ho character does.</P>
<PRE>Grade: A</PRE>
<PRE>SHOWGIRLS
=========</PRE>
<P>     Though it certainly doesn't aspire to any lofty ambitions,
SHOWGIRLS is still a failure.  The problems start in the opening scene,
where the liabilities of actress Elizabeth Berkley are exposed even
before her breasts are.  She has spunk and little else.  (Though some
might argue that she *needs* little else in a movie that wants to give
new meaning the term "titillate."  Forget the rating--the worst you'll
see here are a few female frontal shots.)</P>
<P>     Drawing from the Bad Actors Guild is only part of the problem.
The director, Paul Verhoeven (BASIC INSTINCT, ROBOCOP), can't decide if
he's presenting a strip show or a morality play.  So he tries for
both.  What he ends up with is $40M of Vegas glitz that's neither
erotic nor dramatic enough to be interesting.  A long sit.</P>
<PRE>COMPARATIVE WORTH:  Screenwriter/MPAA taunter Joe Eszterhas was paid  
                    over $3 mil. for his supposedly "tell all" story.  
                    How much does that translate to, on a per-boob 
                    basis?
Grade: D+ </PRE>
<PRE>UNSTRUNG HEROES
===============</PRE>
<P>     Los Angeles, circa 1960.  A young boy (Nathan Watt) is struggling
to cope with his dying mother (a graceful Andie MacDowell), his distant
inventor father (John Turturro), and two mentally ill uncles (Maury
Chaykin and Michael "Cosmo Kramer" Richards).  The first dramatic
feature directed by actress Diane Keaton didn't move me in the least,
so I can't advise on the story's emotional core.  *I* didn't find it.
Still, this is an admirably well-restrained weeper, with a polished
period look that's easy on the teary eye.  From the memoirs by Franz
Lidz.</P>
