<P>"The Deep End" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a 
vast array of blues. Alluring, attractive blues, but also icy and 
foreboding. After taking in their beauty, the eye seeks out the 
reassuring browns and greens, like a tired swimmer searching for the 
safety of land. The production works that way as well – it pulls you in 
initially as a crisp, thoroughly-modern thriller, with clipped exchanges 
between defiantly non-communicative characters. But the real draw of the 
film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "The Deep End" 
gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy 
coating. </P>
<P>SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals the basic storyline. I believe the 
plot points are incidental, because the real rewards come in exploring 
the mindset of the main characters, but still, you should proceed at 
your own risk. </P>
<P>With her husband Tom, a Naval officer, often away at sea, Margaret Hall 
(Tilda Swinton) holds down the fort, taking care of the children, Beau 
(Jonathan Tucker), Paige (Tamara Hope), and Dylan (Jordon Dorrance), 
while her father-in-law Jack (Peter Donat) hovers in the background, 
always watching. The story opens with Margaret leaving the family home 
in Lake Tahoe to storm a male strip club in Reno. It seems that Beau, 
her eldest, is having an affair with Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), a 
disreputable sort 12 years his senior. Margaret demands that Darby leave 
her son alone, only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be 
glad to steer clear of Beau – for $5000. </P>
<P>Back at home, she tries to talk about it all with her son, but the kid 
won't even confirm that he's gay, let alone discuss the issues she has 
with his boyfriend. He does, however, get attentive when she reveals 
Darby's $5,000 offer, even as he maintains his sullen demeanor. Late in 
the evening, Darby shows up outside, tossing pebbles at Beau's window 
like a schoolchild. The two meet by the water at the boathouse, where 
something important happens. I won't reveal what; suffice to say we 
become aware of a significant fact that Margaret does not. </P>
<P>All of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie, by the way. 
Within a day or so, Margaret's life becomes even more complicated when a 
suave man named Alec Goran Visnjic) turns up with an explicit videotape 
documenting the sex life of Beau and Darby. He and his associate are 
willing to destroy the tape, once Margaret coughs up $50,000. </P>
<PRE>Oh, what's a mother to do? </PRE>
<PRE>END SPOILERS </PRE>
<P>Written, directed and produced by Scott McGehee and David Siegel 
("Suture"), "The Deep End" is based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's 1940's 
novel, "The Blank Wall," which was also the source of the 1949 film, 
"The Reckless Moment." I've neither read the book nor seen the movie, 
but I understand that the filmmakers changed some details. In Holding's 
story, the "scandalous" relationship is between an older man and 
Margaret's teen-age daughter. Switching the gender makes the tale seem 
more contemporary, and it also raises questions about Margaret's 
motives. </P>
<P>Many reviews of "The Deep End" describe Margaret as a mother ferociously 
protecting her son, but I wonder. Consider this: Margaret lives in a 
meticulously kept upscale home. Her husband is absent most of the time 
and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure. Her father-in-law 
is constantly present, almost as if he is monitoring for his son. And 
when her husband does call, Margaret is careful not to tell him about 
anything disturbing that is going on with the family. </P>
<P>So is Margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is 
simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take 
advantage of him? Or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class 
complacency, desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything 
will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea? You sort 
it out. </P>
<P>Regardless, the resonance of "The Deep End" comes from two actors. Goran 
Visnjic, best known from the TV drama "ER," is striking as a blackmailer 
unlike any you've seen before. He engages Margaret in a mesmerizing 
dance of protocol, chivalry and simmering eroticism. But the star of 
this show, without a doubt, is the remarkable Tilda Swinton. Watch the 
shadings, depth, resource, vitality and understated sexuality she gives 
Margaret and try to imagine the film without her. Days after my second 
viewing of "The Deep End," I can still vividly picture her negotiating 
with villains, trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue 
water. "The Deep End" is an exceptional film and Tilda Swinton is the 
best part of it. </P>
