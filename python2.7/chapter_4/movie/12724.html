<PRE>.                                 BULWORTH
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     You know, I've seen NETWORK before, and it's a much better film.</P>
<P>     BULWORTH is, in the kindest of words, an "homage" to that picture, and
at least it has an excellent role model.  Simply take the story about a TV
newsman who goes nuts, stirs up controversy, and fatally angers the
establishment and change it to a US Senator who does the same thing, and
you've got BULWORTH.</P>
<P>     Warren Beatty's title role performance is the only reason BULWORTH has
anything going for it at all.  Much like Tom Cruise in JERRY MAGUIRE, Beatty
takes a difficult character and makes it his own, and while Beatty as a
foul-mouthed politician is not exactly playing against type, it's still his
very aggressive performance that carries the picture.</P>
<P>     Everything else, from the dismal supporting cast (Halle Berry has never
looked so lost) to the throw-away one-liners (you've seen all the best over
and over again on the trailers) is cut-and-pasted from NETWORK or clearly
dredged from some late night rewrite session.</P>
<P>     Still, Beatty's in fine form, and his outrageous wackiness takes the
film halfway to where it could have been.  (And geez, he directed, produced,
wrote, and starred in the film... maybe someone was a little too busy?)  But
overall, the missed opportunities, the overtly silly anti-PC message backed
up by nothing, and the all-too-forseeable ending make BULWORTH little more
than a fable that we already knew: That anyone involved with politics is
totally insane.</P>
