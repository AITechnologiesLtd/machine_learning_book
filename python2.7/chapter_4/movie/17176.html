THE BIG ONE (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Writer/Director: Michael Moore</PRE>
<P>Starring: Michael Moore, Phil Knight, Rick Nelson, Garrison Keillor, 
Studs Terkel</P>
<P>No, I haven't seen "Roger and Me" (and let's just forget "Candian Bacon" 
doesn't exist, eh?) but I do know a few things about Michael Moore, as I 
did happen to watch a couple minutes of his short-lived 
summer-replacement TV show "TV Nation" back in the day (and managed to 
glance over "Downsize This" in a bookstore once). He's a liberal with a 
whole lot of money and a loyal film crew, both which he uses to shake up 
the "system" in an attempt to get the point across about the downtrodden 
workers, which let me assure you there are in abundance (I'm one of 
them, though not of the I'm-not-getting-benefits kind, but of the lazy 
kind, not that benefits don't bother me). Physically he looks like a 
poor man's Roger Ebert, an oafish man with a big grin perpetually 
plastered on his face, not revealing his immense intelligence and making 
him easily approachable. He also has an incredible sense of humor, and 
that's his best weapon because otherwise no one would take him seriously 
(you've seen the typical angry demonstrators, and face it, you're as 
annoyed as I am). His other chief weapon is the camera, which he uses to 
embarass the hell out of those in control of workers' jobs, and who have 
no better explanation about mass lay-offs in profitable corporations 
than that someone's greedy. Oh, and he made a film called "Roger and 
Me," which, again, I haven't seen yet, but as I hear, it's about him 
going around with the camera in a northern town, trying to interview the 
CEO of a company that laid off millions of workers at the time.</P>
<P>It's been about a decade since that film hit, and a good thing and a bad 
thing have happened to Mr. Moore: a) he's not lost his sense of humor, 
but b) he's lost his focus...well, sorta. "The Big One" follows him on 
his book tour for "Downsize This," which he describes as the book he 
wrote just so people would still know he was alive (and thus the film), 
and the result is an episodic trip around the America, meeting book 
dates, giving interviews, holding auditorium-sized discussions, and, of 
course, meeting with either potential or actual unions. So every ten 
minutes, we get to see Moore and his crew talk with a union, and then do 
the noble thing of attempting to help them out, with means he tries to 
go right up and see the big cheese, at which point he's either giving a 
bunch of bullshit from the underlings or told by security to leave the 
premises (or at one point, lied that he'll get an interview with the 
president of a company).</P>
<P>And it's all great, priceless material because Moore is such a witty and 
down-to-earth guy, not merely a typical guilty-liberal, but a man who 
has the knowledge of how the system works, the funds to do what he can 
for them, and the showmanship to attract real attention. He's not afraid 
to humiliate people to get something proven (and many of the instances 
are totally worth the price of admission), even if nothing concrete 
actually happens until later. So basically, as I hear, nothing's 
changed...except for a little thing. Throughout the the film, there's a 
disturbing amount of self-gratification going on. More and more scenes 
of him in front of pleased crowds, a near-shameless scene where he gives 
hope and courage to a woman who lost her job the day she met him (and 
buying a 25 dollar hardcover book immeadiately after?), and a lot of 
reaction shots that show Moore listening like a great martyr. In fact, 
there's not much of a point of making this film. Other than showing that 
he's still hard at work, it also shows a side of Moore that takes 
pleasure in the way he helps people, and the entire film has creepy 
undertones of a big fat valentine directed at himself, albeit a 
subconcious one that I'm not sure he realized he was forming when he 
assembled the film together.</P>
<P>But it's so easy to merely brush that aside and ignore it so that you 
can just sit back and enjoy the way this film is made, which is more 
entertainment than social criticism. Moore's wit is heavily on display 
here, and even the aimlessness of the film's structure becomes 
appealing, because you just have no clue what he's going to do next. One 
minute, he could be signing books at Media Play; the next, jamming with 
Cheap Trick member Rick Nelson in his home right near by. It almost has 
the charm of an improv sketch, and Moore has such a great sense of fun 
and adventurism that "The Big One" comes off more like a really 
entertaining ride, even more entertaining if you buy into his philosophy 
(which I do, for the most part). And he concludes it with the one thing 
he couldn't provide in "Roger and Me": an actual filmed interview with a 
CEO. In a priceless bit of movie-dom, Moore sits down for two long 
tete-a-tetes with Nike CEO Phil Knight, accusing him of everything he 
can, humiliating him, yet still coming off as friendly and polite to 
him, and ditto with Knight. The entire last section of the film is 
easily the best, and even if maybe part of the charm of "Roger and Me" 
was that you didn't actually get to see any kind of cherished interview 
transpire (I'm only guessing here), it actually doesn't matter since the 
entire point of the film is that of entertainment. In fact, "The Big 
One" may actually be one of the funnier, more entertaining films of the 
year. But what was the point of Moore even making the film? Beats me. I 
guess it has something to do with him not selling out.</P>
