<P>I can't wait to revisit Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. 1997's
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery failed to light up my life
the first time I saw it; I felt no urge afterwards to utter Austin's
catchphrases, among them "Yeah, baby, yeah" and "Shag-adelic!"
Subsequent viewings of the film somehow improved its comedy; by the
time I received Austin Powers... on DVD for Christmas, I was a
full-fledged fan. The Spy Who Shagged Me features as many guffaws as
its predecessor, but I left the screening feeling again amused but 
unenamoured.</P>
<P>This sequel picks up almost immediately where the first picture left
off. After the luminous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) makes a
startling revelation to Austin (Myers) during their honeymoon, the
superspy is off once again to do battle with Dr. Evil (also Myers).
This time, the bald, scarred, pale madman has devised a time machine, 
which he uses to go back to the sixties. There, with the aid of his
pint-size clone Mini-Me (Troyer) and an obese bagpiper (who eats
babies) named Fat Bastard (Myers, in repulsive make-up), he locates
Austin Powers' cryogenically frozen body and steals his mojo. Nineties
Austin is rendered impassive to espionage and randy women, so he
travels thirty years into the past to get his groove back. At his old
pad, he hooks up with sexy Felicity Shagwell (heart melting, doe-eyed
Graham), and together they search for Dr. Evil's volcanic lair.
Despite much crass humour that follows (including an endless anal sex
jape), The Spy Who Shagged Me is ultimately sweet. The film covers no
new ground in terms of homage to bygone spy thrillers, and very little
of the humour is innovative, but its genteel tone smoothes over the
laughless bumps.</P>
<P>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is only casually interested in
telling us a complete story. Mostly, it's a showcase for Myers' range
and improvisational skills. (Duh.) Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard
are such distinct characters that one will not likely scan for
split-screen lines when any combination of them is on camera together.</P>
<P>"Distinct," however, doesn't necessarily mean "rich." Austin, for all
his signature attributes (the rotting teeth, the velvet suits, the
soundbite-ready dialogue), sends-up popular British TV and movie
secret agents who were never taken seriously in the first place. Watch
a swinger like "The Avengers"' John Steed (played with pursed-lip 
winkingness by Patrick Macnee in several incarnations) or the mod
criminals Steed pursued in action and you'll see prototypes for Austin
Powers rather than ripe targets for parody. Austin the man is a
one-note joke whose only real appeal is his promiscuity-it's been too
long since we've had a hero who lives and breathes for sex. (Aside: a 
naked Austin once again prances around buck naked, but his private
parts aren't so cleverly disguised in The Spy Who Shagged Me-in fact,
digital trickery appears to have erased them altogether.)</P>
<P>In other words, Austin is amusing but Dr. Evil is the star of this
show. Much funnier than Austin's non-sequitor gags, such as a lame
montage involving the Queen's guards set to "I'm a Believer," are Dr.
Evil's non-sequitor gags. It is through the desperately uncool Dr.
Evil that Myers and company skewer: the Jerry Springer show (in 
two very funny sequences-be sure to stay through the end credits);
1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau remake (Dr. Evil and Mini-Me perform a
hilarious piano duet of Joan Osborne's "One of Us"); Jerry Maguire;
time travel movies; and, of course, James Bond. There are also amusing
subplots involving Dr. Evil's sampling of Austin's mojo and the
strained relationship between the doctor and his logic-prone son,
Scott (Green). (As before, Scott is constantly told to shut up by his
father, here in umpteen variations on "zip it." My favourite: "Ladies
and gentlemen of the court, exzipit ‘A.'")</P>
<P>The audience I watched it with cheered the antics of both Austin and
Dr. Evil. (Perhaps I will, too, one day.) Based on crowd reaction, The
Spy Who Shagged Me will see smashing box office returns. While I have
reservations about recommending it, I would never begrudge it of
success.</P>
