<PRE>The Sixth Sense (1999)
Reviewed by Brian Matherly
**** out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Haley Joel Osment, 
Donnie Wahlberg
Written and Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan
Running Time: 107 minutes
Date Reviewed: August 9, 1999</P>
<P>Bruce Willis stars as Malcolm, an award winning child psychologist who 
discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from 
inner demons.  The now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his 
wife (Olivia Williams from Rushmore) are celebrating his award, shoots 
Malcolm in the stomach, then takes his own life.  Almost nine months later, 
Malcolm discovers Cole (Haley Joel Osment, in a brilliant performance), 
another young man
afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient.  He takes on the 
child's case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous 
one, alienating his wife in the process.  He soon discovers that they boy 
can see and speak to the dead, and his life becomes forever turned upside 
down.</P>
<P>Although the first hour is very slow, The Sixth Sense turns out to be a very 
powerful and moving film.  I was expecting this film to be Mercury Rising 2, 
but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller 
with an outstandingly satisfying ending.  You'll find yourself mentally 
retracing your steps through the film
to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll.  I 
must give M. Night Shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written 
screenplay.</P>
<P>The cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid 
as it is.  A lesser cast could have made this film a joke.  Bruce Willis 
portrays his character perfectly, balancing his need to help Cole and his 
agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully.  Haley Joel 
Osment shines as nine year old Cole, showing patience in his character that 
few young actors these days can pull off.  Toni Collette, looking markedly 
different from her pathetic character in Muriel's Wedding, gives a strong 
performance as Cole's mother, who is trying to cope with both her son's 
"illness" and the passing of her mother.  Finally, Olivia Williams deftly 
portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who's not around and 
flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly
accepted end.</P>
<P>It's a shame that they show Cole's abilities in the trailer, because the 
movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same, so we 
already know what's going on before most of the rest of the cast does.  In 
retrospect though, the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end 
of the film, so I have fewer complaints
now then I did while I was watching the film.  I'm glad that the run of 
teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more 
adult fare.  Films like this, the similarly themed Stir of Echoes, and 
countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty 
entertaining close to 1999.  [PG-13]</P>
