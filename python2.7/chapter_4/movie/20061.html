<P>'The Haunting' was originally a small budgeted film from 1963 with the
same name.  In 1999, this version of 'The Haunting' is such a
stupendously bad film that it's tough to know where I should begin. 
It's written in wooden fashion by David Self, based on the novel 'The
Haunting of Hill House' by Shirley Jackson.  I didn't think that camera
man turned academic director Jan DeBont could make a worse film than
1997's 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' but he has.  'The Haunting' is a gothic
style of film making that is protracted, muddled, and doesn't seem to
know where its high points are and to make the most of them when they
try and come up.</P>
<P>My parents took me to Disney World in Florida in 1976 for the first time
when I was eleven and there was a ride called 'The Haunted Mansion'. 
You sit in one of those carnival cars and ride through a simulated
haunted house and as you do so, a tricky light show makes you believe
that you are seeing ghosts everywhere.  At one point you even pass by a
mirror and it seems that a ghost is sitting between you and your
companion.  That five minute ride was more entertaining than this film.</P>
<P>In 'The Haunting', it's tag line is...SOME HOUSES ARE BORN BAD.  Maybe
they knew when they had their finished project that it was such an
abysmal accomplishment, they decided to blame it on the house where most
of the setting takes place.  : - )  You could also make the argument
that the film is entirely disrespectful to anyone who loves horror
movies.</P>
<P>Lili Taylor plays Eleanor Vance, a woman who took care of her mother for
the last eleven years before the sick woman died.  After her death, mom
left her property to her other daughter who seemingly did nothing to
serve her mother in her final years and she and her husband want Eleanor
out of the house.  Eleanor's sister and husband are horrid people who
are materialistic, cut throat and devious.  </P>
<P>Eleanor answers an ad in the paper that will pay her nine hundred
dollars per week (she needs the money now that she's homeless) where a
doctor (Liam Neeson) needs people to fill a study depicting the effects
and causes of insomnia.  Others who answer the ad are a trendy babe
named Theodora (Catherine Zeta Jones), a woman who aches to be a fashion
victim and brags about her huge spending habits and is every credit
card's nightmare. Last there is Luke (Owen Wilson), a character that is
completely wasted as we never get to know anything about him or who he
really is.</P>
<P>The wasted cast gather at an old mansion with a sinister past, its
former owner more than a century ago employed children in a sweat shop
operation and their abuse led to their deaths and the house is
supposedly haunted with their troubled souls.  The characters find that
instead of being studied for their insomnia, they are tricked into be
studied for the effects of fear that plays upon them.  There is a
mythological explanation of the house's history and what the religious
overtones are meant to be and the film looks like a cross between a rare
bad episode of 'The X-Files' and out takes from the achievement a first
year film student.  The entire film spends too much time building up its
climax and when it's supposed to pay off here and there, it relies too
much on convincing the audience that special effects will work better
than the story and this is a major miscalculation.</P>
<P>The fate of the characters in the film's last act is the true testament
as to just how bad this film is.  You can always judge a good or bad
film by how much you care about what happens to the major players.  You
won't care a bit about anything when this film is over.  It looks more
like an instructional film shown to upcoming film technicians on how to
use special effects than it does an actual motion picture with any
redeeming qualities.  A shocking disappointment, especially coming from
Dreamworks, started and owned in part by Steven Spielberg!</P>
