<PRE>                                 ANGUS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This seemed like the movie for me. Socially-awkward fat kid 
goes through high school rejected by his peers and harboring crushes 
for beautiful girls who won't talk to him. Unfortunately, even though 
the theme was right out of my darkest high school memories, the 
movie itself wasn't quite executed properly. If ANGUS had been 
presented as a one-hour after school special, it would have worked, 
but as a feature-length film there's not enough substance. You have 
to get by the unsightly padding to find any value, which is actually a 
metaphor for what the movie's about.</P>
<P>        Angus (Charlie Talbert), doomed with the self-fulfilling 
prophecy of being named after a cow, is going through his freshman 
year as a tormented outsider, "a fat kid who's good at science and 
football." That's where the Angus character and I fundamentally differ. 
The movie could have been called ANDREW except that I hate sports 
and science, although I could identify with the scene in the beginning 
of the movie where Angus is responsible for the jock quarterback's 
winning touchdown but his contribution is ignored as the jock is 
surrounded by screaming fans. It reminded me of the days I would 
write plays for the popular kids to act out, after which they would 
conveniently forget to acknowledge my participation.</P>
<P>        The movie could have also been called ANGST, because it 
once again delves into the popular topic of people being ostracized 
for proudly being different. In Angus' case, a group of brainless jocks 
who are threatened by his nonconformity (and don't we all know the 
type?) arrange to have him elected Homecoming King so they can 
humiliate him at the dance. Angus, meanwhile, has to handle the 
decision of whether to skip the dance or take the opportunity of 
dancing with Melissa, the Homecoming Queen, on whom he's had 
a lifelong crush. The part of Melissa is played by Ariana Richards, 
the girl who had to escape dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK. Here, 
she's chased after by someone slightly larger... Hey, I'm _allowed_ 
to make fat jokes. I'm in the club.</P>
<P>        There are several key people in Angus' life rooting him 
on -- his truck-driving mother (Kathy Bates), grandfather (George C. 
Scott) and best friend. They offer means of support in their own 
weird ways, including a mother-son Hagen Daaz binge (permanently 
answering the question of who taught the kid to pig out) and a 
videotaped dance with a blow-up doll... I identified with a lot of 
things in this movie, but just so you know, the blow-up doll thing 
held no personal meaning for me.</P>
<P>        Ultimately, the film is predictable and offers only a few 
laughs, some of which come at the expense of scenes which were 
supposed to be taken seriously, like the climactic scene at the dance, 
where Angus delivers an impromptu speech to the student body about 
how it's okay to be different and the oppressive jocks are actually 
afraid of us for not playing life by their rules or giving a damn about 
what they think of us. All this is true, of course, but it sounds 
unnecessarily absurd coming in the middle of a school dance. At 
least in REVENGE OF THE NERDS, they played this kind of thing 
for laughs, but in ANGUS we're supposed to seriously think a teenage 
crowd would applaud such a speech. Uh-uh. Take it from me, an 
asskicking would occur after a speech like that.</P>
