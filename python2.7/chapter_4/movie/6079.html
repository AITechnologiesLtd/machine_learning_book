<PRE>               A film review by Jeremy Denison</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Jeremy Denison</PRE>
<PRE>(British, 1996(?) Dark Comedy/Drama)
*****(5) out of *****(5)

<P>This British import follows the (mis-)adventures of a group of heroin
crazed Scottish youths.  There is Marc Renton (who narrates), Spud (the
dim-witted one) Sick Boy(The Sean Connery obsessive), and Begbee (the
violence obsessive). Powered by a top rate, but not top name
soundtrack(Iggy Pop, Sleeper, Elastica, Lou Reed...) the film follows
Renton who gets clean, gets back into heroin and gets clean again. Some of
the wit in this movie is sharp and Pulp Fiction-esque, and some is just
Dumb & Dumber gross(the bed sheets) and stupid (the bb gun)
Although the film starts out on a comic note, it takes a sharp term in the
middle, and becomes almost depressing. 
The film is based on an Irving Welsh novel bearing the same title. I can
honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is an
obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the US by such movies as Mission
Impossible and ID4. The film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of
the actors. This is a very original film, as far as films go today. It
definetly deserves multiple viewings (partly because of the slang and
accents)<HR>Jeremy Dennison
