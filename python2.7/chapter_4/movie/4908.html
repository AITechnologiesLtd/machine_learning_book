<P>"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is the latest exception to the 
commonly held opinion that movie remakes are never as good as 
the originals. It is a thoroughly reworked remake of the 1964  
movie "Bedtime Story," which was a weak comedy starring  
Marlon Brando, David Niven and Shirley Jones. On the contrary, 
"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is most amusing and excellent in its 
scenario, direction and pacing. It is sure-footed 
entertainment, tightly controlled yet consistently maintaining 
an air of spontaneity. The performances are top-notch, from 
the principals' to those of the supporting cast. The 1988 
version is infinitely superior to its model.     </P>
<P>Michael Caine plays a suave, elegant  gentleman who, with the 
complicity of police chief Anton Rodgers (a convincing 
Frenchman for a change), fleeces rich women in the French 
Riviera town where he resides in luxury. The tricks are so 
imaginative that they raise  Caine from the level of con man 
to that of a veritable con artist.    </P>
<P>Caine's territory is invaded by another scoundrel, small-timer 
Steve Martin. Martin is uncouth, looks like an unkempt "Europe 
on Ten Dollars a Day" tourist in sneakers and baggy chinos, 
acts like a parody of American not-so-innocents abroad. The 
contrast between the aristocratic, low-key Caine and loud 
vulgarian Martin is like that between The Prince and The 
Pauper. But appearances are deceiving: the yokel Martin is a 
real and present danger to Caine's business.So, when the Brit 
fails in his efforts to get rid of this menace, a "modus 
vivendi" must be found... </P>
<P>"DRS" has a wealth of clever situations and twists which keep 
going at a steady, clippety-clop pace, with nary a dead 
moment. From the start, the tone of a comic scam is immensely 
aided by having as Caine's first victim the terrific Barbara 
Harris. She was the con woman in Alfred Hitchcok's last 
picture, "Family Plot." Her presence here is a delightful 
homage to the Master. </P>
<P>There are many more fine in-jokes and references to other 
movies. You don't have to catch them all to enjoy this film, 
but connoisseurs could  double their pleasure when those parts 
come up. Caine, while creating a new, original persona, is  
also obviously a Cary Grant figure ( notably that of "To Catch 
A Thief," which was also set on the French Riviera). He does 
an imitation of German-Swiss psychiatrist, a type familiar 
from older  Hollywood farces including Marx Brothers and 
Hope/Crosby pictures.</P>
<P>Martin produces a simian Jerry Lewis number. The Caine-Martin 
relationship could remind you of those animated shorts where 
an indestructible Roadrunner keeps reappearing unexpectedly...</P>
<P>The casting of Caine and Martin was inspired. The chic 
Britisher is like an aging Don Juan; the dishevelled American, 
like  an aging child. In the film's clever fundamental 
reversal--which operates almost like a funny scam on the 
audience--the typecast plebeian and Cockney Caine (Alfie, 
Harry Palmer, etc.) has been turned into a quiet, patrician 
gentleman. </P>
<P>The changes, however, are not methodical. Martin is still the 
same old Steve. He retains his familiar wild and crazy 
character, but at the same time he is made into such a loud, 
grating interloper, that in the Caine-Martin confrontation our 
sympathies are with classy Caine. </P>
<P>Since so much of the public's enjoyment hangs on the 
developments, twists and double-crossings of this movie, I 
will only mention that the basic plot principle (which works 
very well ) is that of multiple stings where the con men 
practice their scams both on outsiders and on each other. Few, 
if any, of those turns are predictable. You will, for 
instance, be lulled into the belief that American women (the 
scoundrels' customary targets) are all simple-minded, 
provincial an naive creatures, but just you wait! </P>
<P>Another surprise is that the movie is unexpectedly asexual and 
free of conventional romantic entanglements. It does not deal 
with men as males and women as females, it is no battle of the 
sexes but a  battle of wits and of steadily escalating 
inventiveness. </P>
<P>"Dirty Rotten Dirty Scoundrels" has three scriptwriters, of 
whom two were the scenarists of "Bedtime Story." This fact 
alone should   normally guarantee a pedestrian remake. 
Remarkably though, the way in which the 1964 text was 
rewritten is appealingly fresh. And while physically (with 
genuine location sets and crisp photography) the film is an 
update to the end of the 1980s, in spirit it is a return to 
the buoyant, airy and good-humored movies of the 1930s. </P>
