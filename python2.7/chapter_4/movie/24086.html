<P>In 1927, during the waning days of silents, Cecil B. DeMille made an 
impressive life-of-Jesus film called "King of Kings." Nicholas Ray's 
longer 1961 version goes one better. It is surprisingly moving and 
sober, and while reverential, it amounts to much more than a 
collection of biblical postcards. The narration, spoken by Orson 
Welles, is limited  (that is, not invasive) and well done.</P>
<P>The movie came after a spate of youth-centered pictures such as 
Nicholas Ray's own classic "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955), and after 
silly titles like "I Was a Teen-Age Frankenstein" or "I Was a 
Teen-Age Werewolf." So the wags dubbed it "I Was a Teen-Age Jesus " 
-- a  good jest had the movie deserved it.</P>
<P>But it didn't. The joke was unfair to the film, its makers and Jeff 
Hunter. Hunter's face may lack the necessary intelligence for his 
role, but he is so well directed that he's convincing enough.</P>
<P>True, his King's English is not perfect. Hunter tells the rebelling 
Jews : "Romans are conquerors. If you become conquerors you will be 
no different than them." Good pacifism, bad grammar. Someone ought to 
have caught that jarring "than" and credited Christ with better 
English, so to speak. But then, literacy is not Hollywood's forte.</P>
<P>The picture establishes a clear continuity from Jews to Christians, 
that is, it stresses the Christians as Jews. There are several 
unusual scenes. Among them, Golgotha's disorderly array of crosses 
comes through like a mass of TV antennas --whether by chance or on 
purpose I cannot tell. Curiously, the opening of Francois Truffaut's 
British-made "Fahrenheit 451" of 1967, with its own antennas, bears 
some resemblance to this.</P>
<P>(Interestingly, Ray Bradbury, whose book Truffaut adapted, is the 
uncredited writer of the narration of "King of Kings")</P>
<P>Jesus on the Cross is not a ghoulish sight. We see no torture. The 
descent comes very rapidly and discreetly. Physical violence and pain 
are neither underlined no exploited.</P>
<P>The interesting supporting cast includes Siobhan McKenna, Robert 
Ryan, Hurd Hatfield, Viveca Lindfors, Rita Gam and Rip Torn.</P>
<P>There are many Spanish supporting actors and extras. The movie was 
filmed in Spain, as was the entire quartet of "epics" produced by 
Samuel Bronston. These were Bronston's claims to fame:  "El Cid" 
(1961, also partly shot in Italy and the UK);  "The 55 Days of 
Peking" (1963); "The Fall of the Roman Empire" (1964). The 1960s were 
the heyday of shooting "epics" and action pictures in Spain, 
including the works of Sergio Leone --his justly famous Spaghetti 
Westerns --which were also Paella Westerns.</P>
<P>Beautiful score by Miklos Rozsa. "King of Kings" absolutely ought to 
be shown letterboxed, but is not always.  (Edwin Jahiel)</P>
