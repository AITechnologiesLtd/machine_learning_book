<PRE>Review:                YOU'VE GOT MAIL</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, 
                Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Nora Ephron</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, The  SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>In 1940 Ernst Lubitsch directed a memorable film entitled `The Shop
Around the Corner'.  It starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan as
lonelyheart penpals in a Budapest notions shop.  In 1949 is was remade by
MGM as a musical starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson entitled `In the
Good Old Summertime'.  Then it became the Broadway musical `She Loves Me'.</P>
<P>Bringing it up to the computer age, You've Got Mail stands on its own as
an original story, not as merely a re-make.  Two people accidentally
meeting in cyberspace is not the same as lonelyheart penpals.  These two
did not go looking for someone out of desperation.  Each is supposedly
happy with a significant other.  </P>
<P>Joe Fox [Hanks], the scion of a mega-bookstore family, lives with
Patricia Eden [Posey] a dynamic woman executive.  Kathleen Kelly [Ryan],
the owner of `The Shop Around The Corner', is in a relationship with Frank
Navasky [Kinnear] Each of them have frustrations in their lives and they
find a little bit of solace in each other when on the Internet.  There is
no intention to meet, or to break up their relationships.  Each day they
pass within footsteps of each other, not realizing that she is `Shopgirl'
or that he is `NY152', their Internet names.</P>
<P>There are so many interesting sub-plots in the film.  The Fox family
would be the basis of a hilarious movie on their own.  And, there's the
love story involving Birdie [Stapleton] and her Spanish lover.  Each and
every character is well presented.  You care about them all.  When the Fox
family causes the demise of Kelly's bookstore, you are genuinely concerned
about the future of the employees.  </P>
<P>The film's ending doesn't hit you over the head as to what course their
lives will take, but you can figure it out all by yourself.  Brinkley is a
nice touch, too.</P>
<P>It will be referred to as a `chick' movie, or a date movie, but it is
truly a good, old-fashioned love story.  I could see it over and over, on
TV.   I give it a B+.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
