<PRE>                                LOVE JONES
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     "Have you been listening?" asks lead character Darius Lovehall
(Larenz Tate).  "The point is.  The point is.  I don't know what the
point is."  And neither does LOVE JONES's writer and director Theodore
Witcher.</P>
<P>     I suppose that if this lame excuse for a film has a point, it is
that blacks can make formulaic romantic comedies too.  In less than a
week I have seen two romantic comedies, the other being FOOLS RUSH IN,
that are neither romantic nor funny.  As bad as FOOLS RUSH IN is, at
least it had enough energy to keep your interest.  In contrast, LOVE
JONES is lifeless.  There is not a character in the show worth caring
about, and the leads demonstrate little genuine chemistry.  I was in a
fairly full audience and rarely heard more than a few snickers -- not a
good sign for a comedy.</P>
<P>     Ernest Holzmann's warm cinematography evokes an immediate intimacy
that promises more that the show ever delivers.  When the characters
begin to speak, one of the problems of the film becomes evident.  All
of the characters speak in a low, monotonic voice, making their dialog
sometimes unintelligible.  To exacerbate this, the loud background
noise frequently drowns out the speech.  With proper straining, one can
make out their lines, but then the more substantial problem emerges.
The writer constructs the dialog out of random snippets of small talk
laced with heavy profanities.  I go to enough art house films to be
able to tune out the profanities, but LOVE JONES's dialog is vacuous
with or without the cussing.  I found myself wishing for the smart,
funny dialog and crisp direction of Spike Lee's SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT.</P>
<P>     Female lead Nina Mosley is played by Nia Long.  Both Long and Tate
are good looking actors, but they are unable to make any talent they
have shine through this material.  I suspect the director got just the
mood he wanted, but it is a formula I have seen innumerable times
before and without a decent script, sitting through it again was
painful.</P>
<P>     I'll give you a few points of the story, and you can easily guess
most of the rest.  With typical 1990's movie morals, Nina and Darius
have sex and spend the night together on their first date.  Darius
claims interest only in sex, but falls in love as well.  Nina favors
romance but wants to test his level of commitment so she tries to make
him jealous.  The only scene with any imagination occurs late in the
picture.  She invites him to her apartment to sleep over and then
temporarily denies him sex.  This induces mass anguish on both of their
parts.</P>
<P>     Maysie Hoy's editing has jarring cuts between scenes and lets most
scenes live on way past their welcome.  I became reacquainted with my
watch during the show.  Finally, the film did end, and I was released.
Had I not been at a screening, I would have walked out, and if I had
left, I would have missed nothing.</P>
<P>     Toward the end of the picture, one of Darius's friends gives him
some advice.  "It ain't supposed to make sense," he says.  "Love,
passion -- it is what it is."  Well, this show made little sense and
had little credible love or passion.  I hope that for his next film,
first-time writer and director Witcher will either avoid formula films
or, if he feels compelled to make another, find something fresh to say.</P>
<P>     LOVE JONES runs too long at 1:50.  It is not yet rated, but will
certainly get an R for a little sex, a little nudity, crude sexual
humor, and a lot of profanity.  If teenagers go, they should be mature.
I would not wish this film on anyone else so I give it thumbs down and
a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
