<PRE>                                ARACHNOPHOBIA
                       A film review by Chris Hillery
                        Copyright 1990 Chris Hillery</PRE>
<P>     *Do not* see this movie if you actually are affected by
arachnophobia (fear of spiders, in case you didn't know).  The friend I
saw this with is a severe arachnophobe, and he practically broke the
poor chair he was sitting in by flying out of it so hard.  If you can
guess from this that this is a scary movie, well, it is.  While it is
marketing itself as a "Thrill-omedy," this movie has much more thrill
than "omedy," which is fine if that's what you're prepared for.  It also
spends a good deal of its time in extreme close-ups of spiders in
action, hence the opening warning.</P>
<P>     Basic plot synopsis: a large (!) and ill-tempered South American
spider (a new species no one knew of previously, natch) hitches a ride
to a small backwoods town in the coffin of a photographer whom it had
killed in the  jungle.  It escapes into the local woods, where it mates
with a local spider and creates a whole bunch of deadly toxic
mean-spirited little spiders, which take off to terrorize the town.</P>
<P>     Most of this movie centers around the new local doctor's struggle
to get people to believe that the deaths of several people were not
cardiac arrests brought about by his own negligence, as the old doctor
would have it, but are in fact attributable to these spiders.  Once real
evidence is found for this, a regional spider expert is brought in, and
the ground is laid for a plan to rid the town of the threat, leading (of
course) to a grand confrontation  between the grandaddy spider and the
doctor, who (of course) has a serious fear of spiders due (of course) to
an incident in his infancy.</P>
<P>     You might have notice that this summary makes no mention of the
role of the exterminator, played by John Goodman, who is in all the
commercials.  This is because, unfortunately, he has very little screen
time and is not at all important to the plot or development.  This is a
real shame, and a great waste of both a good character and a good actor.
The scenes involving Goodman are uniformly quite funny, as his role as
the down-n-dirty and rather thick-headed exterminator is ideal for him
and played to the hilt.  If this movie had been, as I suspected,
Goodman's first real starring role and centered on his battle against
the spiders with his spray-gun, this could have been a truly hysterical
movie, while still being a thriller.</P>
<P>     Luckily, the movie isn't a total loss without this; indeed,it's a
reasonably enjoyable flick with many good scares (plenty of spiders
flying around) and quite a few laughs along the way.  It's pretty
formulaic, beyond its unique plot device, but still well-done; the plot
and tension build nicely if a bit slowly, and the climax is quite, well,
climactic.  All the important characters are pretty well fleshed out.
The plot is sensible and has several sub-plots which interact quite
nicely.  And so on.</P>
<P>     All in all, this is a "solid" movie.  It could have been much
better had it been, as it is being marketed as, a movie starring John
Goodman as the back- woods exterminator on a mission to save the town;
that could have been made into a truly funny, cornball movie based on a
thriller, in the same style as the classic GHOSTBUSTERS (the first one,
of course).  However, when you realize that it isn't that movie, you can
enjoy what it is.  Check it out; it's worth a look.</P>
<PRE>    Ratings IMHO, 0-100 scale:           Compare to:
     ARACHNOPHOBIA                        GHOSTBUSTERS      (well... they were
       Plot: 80                             Plot: 95        marketed about the
       Thrills: 85                          Thrills: 30     same...)
       Comedy: 65                           Comedy: 100
       Advertising: 5  :)                   Advertising: N/A
       Overall: 77 [B-,2 3/4 stars]         Overall: 99 [A+, 4 stars]</PRE>
<P>     Please note that the "Overall" ratings above are in no way intended to be
a summation of the previous ratings, but instead a true rating of how good the
movie was taken as a whole.  Four categories are not enough to rate all aspects
of a movie, neither should all four be weighted equally.  For instance, the
rating for Thrills in GHOSTBUSTERS above was quite low, but that wasn't what
the movie was intended to be about; whereas Thrills were central to ARACHNO-
PHOBIA.  The reason I chose to compare it to GHOSTBUSTERS was, as I said, that
ARACHNOPHOBIA was marketed to appear to be a similar type film.
