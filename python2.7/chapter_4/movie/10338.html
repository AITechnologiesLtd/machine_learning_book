<PRE>                         DECONSTRUCTING HARRY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A number of interesting stylistic
          touches that work to varying degrees of success.
          The story, however, is a disjointed, confusing
          portrait of an almost totally uninteresting
          Lothario who never misses an opportunity to screw
          up his own life and to hurt others.  The film is a
          collection of story fragments and manipulative
          arguments.  If this is a confession Allen should
          have written it in his diary and put it under his
          pillow, not on the screen.  Rating: 3 (0 to 10), -1
          (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 16 positive, 4 negative, 1 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Woody Allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in
Hollywood, but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker.
In his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy.  From
there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with
different approaches and styles.  Some of these work better than
others.  ZELIG and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS are the work of a creative
and intelligent artist.  DECONSTRUCTING HARRY goes to the other extreme
and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives
back.</P>
<P>     Harry Block (Allen) has in his life only two drives.  He wants to
have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his
life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing.  The
story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a
number of often clumsy stylistic experiments. Perhaps the most
irritating device is to express the disjointedness of Harry's life by
editing Harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show
missing time with something edited out.  As a writer, Harry puts his
friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises.  The film
dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his
real story line and fragments from Harry's books with different actors
playing the real and fictional people in Harry's life.  These fragments
are frustrating in their lack of completion, but even more frustrating
is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with
the real characters.  It is up to the viewer to keep track not just who
is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the
fictional doppelganger of which real person.  If that sounds
complicated, it is.  Then as another device in one of the stories, an
actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus
and can only be seen in blurry image.  Harry sees this as a metaphor
for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time.  As if
these touches did not create sufficient confusion, the story is told
out of chronological order.  If Allen were giving the audience a story
that was worth decoding, any and all of these stylistic touches could
be excusable.  But Allen puts the audience through all of this to give
us a portrait of Harry Block who is a selfish manipulator who is not
worth the effort to understand.</P>
<P>     DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is set at a time when Harry's old college,
the one that expelled him when he attended it, wants now to honor him
for a lifetime of writing achievement.  Harry is searching among his
friends to find one who will go with him.  Just why someone who is so
unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the
support of someone else is unclear.  Harry tries his current girl
friend Fay (Elizabeth Shue) only to find that she is about to marry
Harry's old friend Larry (Billy Crystal).  Block would like his son
Hilly (Eric Lloyd) to accompany him, but Hilly's mother, previously
first Harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife, refuses to let
her son see his father.  Another friend Richard (Bob Balaban) would go
but has health problems.  Harry also considers bringing a prostitute
Cookie (Hazel Goodman).  It is interesting that Allen should introduce
another likable prostitute so soon after MIGHTY APHRODITE, but Cookie
is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than Mira Sorvino's
character in the previous film.</P>
<P>     While the comedy sequences are never complete, a few are elaborate
and some quite funny.  The centerpiece of the film is a journey into
Hell with Allen playing a sort of Orpheus rescuing Fay from the
clutches of the Devil, who looks a lot like Larry.  That story also is
left uncompleted, perhaps to show Harry's unwillingness to commit even
to telling a story.  The linchpin that was needed to tie together the
stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and
who gives us something about which to care.  That character is patently
not the one Allen creates in Harry Block and not the characters around
Harry as seen through his acerbic eyes.  Allen can do much better than
DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.  I rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
