<PRE>                                  FLIPPER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Let's say you want to make money, I mean make a movie.  First, you
acquire the rights to a kids' TV show which was popular in the 60s,
"Flipper."  Next you line up a sure fire and likable star, Paul Hogan
from CROCODILE DUNDEE fame.  You get a known child actor, Elijah Wood
(AVALON, RADIO FLYER, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN, THE WAR and NORTH).
Finally, your piece de resistance is the show will feature an animal so
naturally charming that surely riches must yours for the taking.</P>
<P>     Well, it's not that easy.  If you get a lame script from an fairly
inexperienced screenwriter (Alan Shapiro), and a similarly
inexperienced director (also Alan Shapiro) who is unable to breathe any
life into the film, all of your other good ideas will be nullified.
This show has such little energy it may put you to sleep.  Count
yourself extremely fortunate if this happens.</P>
<P>     The setup for the plot is that Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan) is being
paid by his sister to keep his 14 year old nephew Sandy Ricks (Elijah
Wood) for the summer.  Uncle Porter lives in a fishing village that is
going broke because a bad guy, Dirk Moran (Jonathan Banks), is dumping
toxic waste into the waters nearby.  Sandy finds an adorable dolphin
which he names Flipper.  Flipper becomes attached to him and follows
him around.  The film is pure formula from beginning to end.</P>
<P>     The script attempts both physical and verbal humor and both fall
flat.  An example of the visual jokes is the way Uncle Porter makes
toast which is by pushing white bread onto a nail in a metal wall and
then using a blow torch to create instant toast.  It sounds funnier
that it is on the screen.  A gross piece of humor is that Sandy throws
up all over himself, but never gets around to putting on a clean shirt.
I am talking caked on vomit a half inch thick which completely covers
the front of the shirt.</P>
<P>     Since the uncle smokes big cigars, Sandy tries them as well.  His
uncle lets him do this until he gets sick.  I think it makes underage
smoking look cool if you are macho enough not to get sick, which is the
wrong message to give to the film's intended audience.  The language is
silly, but at least it is clean.  A typical insult is when Uncle Porter
calls someone a "butt faced wombat."</P>
<P>     The script has a few nice lines.  Uncle Porter warns Sandy,
"You're going to have to use your brain which is going to hurt because
it's the weakest muscle in your body."  Another is when Dirk threatens
Porter with "I ought to teach you a lesson."  Porter retorts, "I'd like
that.  I have a thirst for knowledge; teach me."</P>
<P>     To make sure the audience understand how evil Dirk is, they have
him shoot dolphins with a high powered rifle from his boat, which is
called Bounty Hunter.  Similarly, to remind the audience how in awe
they should be of the dolphins, the cinematographer (Bill Butler) uses
lots of orange filters to give the jumping dolphins a mystical look.</P>
<P>     The acting is pretty awful.  Paul Hogan does not play Uncle
Porter.  Instead he delivers a weak rendition of the old Paul Hogan.
Think of it as Paul Hogan with most of his life blood sucked out as if
there was a vampire picture being filmed on the next lot.  Elijah
Wood's performance is so detached it is like an out-of-body experience.
Only Flipper seems up to his assignment, but he is not given much
interesting to do.  Tossing a soda can from off screen, does not a
moving performance make.  Jessica Wesson (MILK MONEY and CASPER) plays
Sandy's friend Kim.  If they had done something with this romantic
angle it might have been a refreshing change of pace, but it is never
developed much.</P>
<P>     FLIPPER runs 1:35.  It is rated PG and nothing offensive happens.
There is no sex, nudity, bad language, and little violence.  My easy to
please son Jeffrey (age 7) gives film a thumbs up, but only for kids 5
and up.  He feels like the attack by Scar, the hammer head shark, may
scare little kids.  I'm glad Jeffrey liked the show, but I hated it.  I
am still amazed that they could take such a likable star as Flipper and
make such an inanimate movie.  A big thumbs down from me and a rating
of a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
