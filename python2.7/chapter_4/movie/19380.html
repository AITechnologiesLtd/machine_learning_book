<P>   Terence Stamp, an unusually fine character actor, is the
titled character of a film called "The Limey" (a slang term
generally meaning citizen of Britain) because Stamp's
character, Wilson, is so quintessentially lower-class English
that his colloquialisms and even his heavy accent are
scarcely understood by the Americans with whom he comes
into contact. "The Limey" is a crime story with a simple
trajectory: man's daughter is murdered, dad comes looking
for the killer to avenge the offense.  What gives the film an
unusual stamp, so to speak, is the method by which its
director, Steven Soderbergh, unfolds the plot.   Soderbergh is
anything but a conventional 36-year-old director.  His quirky
"sex, lies and videotape" which surfaced ten years ago, is
based on a script he wrote in one eight-day burst and put
across with a budget of just over one million dollars--a
morality tale that was the hit of the 1989 Cannes Film
Festival (Palme d'Or--best film).  Exceptionally well acted by
James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher, his
first film was about a selfish lawyer with a frigid wife, who
takes on his sister-in-law as a lover--an exceptionally talky
drama coming from a young hand.  </P>
<P>   "The Limey," however, is anything but dialogue-driven.  Full
of action--though not gratuitous violence--the picture is
Soderbergh's way of proving that you can tell a story with a
succession of images, some repeated at various points in the
story, others thrown in almost helter-skelter with the aim of
showing us Wilson's character from different points of view. 
We see Wilson as an outsider in Los Angeles, a visitor who
flies into town the way the hero gunmen used to do to clean
up the old West.  He has not come to admire the gorgeous
scenery of the Big Sur area, but simply to eliminate up the
scourge he finds and delete not only his daughter's killer but
apparently all who work for this fabulously wealthy man.  He's
no marshall Gary Cooper putting on his guns to help purify
the West, but rather a flawed visitor from out East who has
just completed a nine-year sentence for armed robbery in his
native England.</P>
<P>   As Wilson (a man of few but charmingly idiomatic words)
mounts his design for vengeance, he allies himself with two
friends of his deceased daughter, Ed (Luis Guzman) and
Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren), who fill him in on their area of
the cliff-bound countryside and act as his guardian angels
while this powerful 60-ish man knocks off some of the
toughest characters who are into the state's opulent drug
culture.  His opponent is a weak man, too easy to pick off
once his bodyguards are eliminated.  As the villainous Terry
Valentine, Peter Fonda is a handsome but aging and
somewhat effeminate party-giver with two lavish cliffside
homes and a gorgeous girl friend, Adhara (Amelia Heinle)--a
man whose income allegedly comes from his success as a
producer of rock-and-roll records during the mid-sixties but
whose major income actually comes from criminals who use
him to launder their drug money.</P>
<P>   "The Limey" makes no major innovations in the crime
genre save for its repeated use of imagery thrown in for no
apparent purpose save to look inventive.  A recurrent
impression is of Wilson sitting poker-faced in his airline seat
presumably contemplating revenge as he heads from London
to L.A.  He frequently speaks to his daughter's friend, Ed, in
Ed's unassuming house, the camera suddenly changing
locations to Ed's car, where the conversation is actually
taking place.  At times the rapid scene changes come across
so arbitrarily that viewers cannot be blamed for thinking that
they are watching a rough, unedited cut of the story.  The
most striking recollection is the movie's chief comic touch. 
>From time to time Soderbergh flashes back to a more
youthful Terence Stamp of thirty years ago as he serenades
the gals with his guitar--the footage actually taken from Ken
Loach's "Poor Cow", about working-class loners, in which
Stamp plays the best friend of a promiscuous woman's
husband.  This is a clever touch indeed.</P>
<P>   Though a minor entry into the crowded world of movies
about iniquity, "The Limey" is well-acted particularly by
Stamp--known to teens as the evil General Zod in "Superman
II" and to me mainly for a role as a sex therapist in a
fabulous film not even mentioned in his press bio, "Bliss."</P>
