<PRE>Scorsese Triumphs in `Bringing Out the Dead'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Of the most chaotic times and places to be, I would
give my vote to the early 1990s in the Hell's Kitchen
district of New York City.  It is a time period when
drug use and the devastation of the AIDS epidemic were
on the rise.  And it is a place where, at night, the
streets seem like a swamp of despair and hopelessness
where even the neighborhood citizens scurry around
like rats.  It is this setting where `Bringing Out the
Dead' takes place.  We are introduced to Frank Pierce
(Nicolas Cage) who is a paramedic, and it is through
his eyes that we see the gloomy world in which he
exists.</P>
<P>Frank works the graveyard shift and every night seems
like a full moon.  All the city's craziness that has
been bottled up is about to erupt.  On top of that,
Frank hasn't had a good night's sleep for days and he
hasn't been able to save any lives in over a month. 
Frank's hands are gifted and his heart is giving.  But
there is only so much that he can do in this time and
place.  The ghosts of those that he could not save
haunt him.  He drifts in and out of a state of
bewildered consciousness.  This is not an easy life. </P>
<P>`Bringing Out the Dead' shows us three long nights in
the life of Frank as the burned out paramedic.  In the
first night, he's paired up with Larry (John Goodman)
who sees his job as simply a meal ticket.  Save lives,
get paid, and eat.  He's almost too relaxed given the
nature of his job.  On the second night, he is paired
up with the ultra-religious Marcus (Ving Rhames).  He
uses their emergency visits as a way to promote their
healing techniques as miracles.  Finally, his third
partner is Walls (Tom Sizemore), a sadistic person who
feels that it is better to beat up frequent visitors
to the emergency room rather than to transport them
there again and again and again.  Two other characters
factor into Frank's life.  One is Noel (pop star Marc
Anthony), who is one of those frequent visitors.  He
represents every hollowed soul whose life is consumed
with misery and drugs.  The other is the reformed
addict Mary (Patricia Arquette).  In trying to save
Mary from her state of turmoil, Frank may rid himself
of his inner demons.</P>
<P>`Dead' is truly a Director's film.  That is, it does
not succumb to Hollywood's familiar formula of
storytelling.  Scorsese has free reign to make his
kind of picture, and it is a work of directorial
excellence, uncompromising in detail and atmosphere. 
Perhaps its only weakness could be that it lacks the
dramatic arc and the climax that most moviegoers
expect from today's films.  In fact, there is no real
plot, as it relies on individual events.  But this
film is a wonderful exercise in bringing to fruition
the extended limbo in which Frank exists.  Cage does
all the right things that bring out Frank's pain and
despondence.  And all of the supporting characters and
the excellent camera work add vivid color to a world
that many would probably rather be lost and forgotten.
 This is definitely not a feel-good film like `Happy
Texas.'  And this film probably won't gross huge box
office dollars.  But a few Oscar bids are probably in
order, including Best Director for Scorcese. 
`Bringing Out the Dead' is terrific filmmaking from
one of Hollywood's greats.</P>
