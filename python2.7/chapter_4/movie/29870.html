<P>Life As a House, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International
Film Festival, was described in the program book as being reminiscent of
Parenthood, It's a Wonderful Life and The Parent Trap, but the film reminded
me of a previous Toronto world premiere - American Beauty. Now, let's not
get carried away here, because House couldn't carry Beauty's jockstrap.  The
similarities are only in the content, not the quality.</P>
<P>Kline (The Anniversary Party) plays architect George Monroe, who, like
Lester Burnham before him, suffers daily at a job he no longer feels
passionate about, but gets fired in one of the film's opening scenes.  On
his way out of the building, George collapses and is taken to the hospital,
only to find out there's a cancer present that will devour him from the
inside out within a few months.  He is also father to a dark, brooding
teenager named Sam (The Virgin Suicides' Hayden Christensen, who will soon
be the dark, brooding Anakin Skywalker), who huffs gas and asphyxiates
himself when he jerks off.</P>
<P>Unlike Lester, who sort of knew he was going to die and suffered a midlife
crisis instigated by employment issues, George has been divorced from Robin
(Kristin Scott Thomas, Up At the Villa) long enough for her to have squirted
out two new kids with her current husband, the cold, unloving Peter (Jamey
Sheridan, Law & Order: CI).  And although he lives in a ritzy suburban
neighborhood like Lester, George's house is a shack, which is a painfully
ridiculous metaphor for both his rotten life and decaying innards.</P>
<P>Knowing he'll be pushing up daisies soon (and keeping his illness a secret
from everyone), George decides it's the perfect time to bond with his
rebellious son as the two - get this - tear down the shack and build
George's dream house.  Sam, of course, hates the idea, but soon changes from
a pierced, dyed, black-clad, perpetually headphoned rent-boy into a normal,
well-adjusted kid with no makeup and no attitude.  After all, what angry,
distant teen wouldn't relish taking a crowbar to his father's house?</P>
<P>Sure enough, the montage of the two building the new home soon follows, but
George and Sam are joined by neighbor Colleen (Mary Steenburgen) and her
daughter Alyssa (Jena Malone), and soon, even ex-wife Robin shows up with a
hammer in her hand.  As the house gets closer and closer to completion,
George's health gets worse and worse, but he feels better on the inside, and
that's all that counts, right?</P>
<P>House's neatly telegraphed story (penned by As Good As It Gets' Mark Andrus)
offers precious little that we can't see coming a mile away (or that we
haven't seen a bunch of times before).  The only thing remotely surprising
here is the amount of sex.  I don't want to give anything away, but there
are all kinds of combinations going on - May-December, December-May,
December-December, May-May and so on.  It's supposed to lighten things up, I
guess, but some of it gave me douche chills.</P>
<P>Although it's totally schmaltzy, House is still somewhat stirring, due to
its performances (especially Kline and the always reliable Malone). Director
Irwin Winkler (At First Sight) doesn't do anything special with the
formulaic script, unless you weren't expecting to see scenes where George is
doubled over with pain.  Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond keeps
everything bathed in a nice, warm light.</P>
