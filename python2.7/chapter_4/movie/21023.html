<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>More than adequately suspenseful, A Perfect Murder one-ups its
predecessor with a bigger and better cast and a boatload of twists and
turns.  Based on the Frederick Knott play, which spawned the Hitchcock
thriller Dial ‘M' for Murder, the modernization is a glowing exception
of a remake surpassing its original in terms of sheer entertainment
value.</P>
<P>Michael Douglas (The Game) stars as Steven Taylor, a seemingly
successful New York businessman married to trophy wife, Emily (Paltrow,
Sliding Doors), a United Nations employee.  They live in a swank pad
overlooking Central Park, but that don't mean they're happy – he's is
secretly going broke and she's boffing an angry long-haired artist named
David Shaw (Mortensen, G.I. Jane).</P>
<P>Not being a dumb guy, Steven quickly finds out about the affair and
confronts David with a strange proposition – murder Emily for $500,000.
Why does Steven want his wife dead?  Turns out she's worth millions and
needs the cash to keep his business afloat.  Why would David kill the
fuck-bunny that he's been more than eager to use for a sperm
receptacle?  He's really a gold digger who has already been convicted
twice and faces the deadly `three strikes – you're out' law if charged
again.  In fear of being caught for his previous scam in Florida, David
agrees to take $100,000 up front and the balance on receipt of the dead
babe.</P>
<P>While Steven has the entire murder planned out, things quickly spin out
of control.  By the time you realize that something is afoul, it becomes
impossible to tell who's trying to con who into what.  I've seen the
original and I was on the edge of my seat.  OK – slumped down on the
edge of my seat.  But you get the point.</P>
<P>Douglas is wonderful as the savvy equal to Gordon Gecko, although he is
flawed in different ways and much angrier and much scarier (I think).
He's the only guy that I can think of that can win the support of the
audience by trying to kill his wife.  Paltrow is, well, nice eye-candy.
She's perfect as a leggy May to Douglas' December and even spends time
in a subway and elevator ala Sliding Doors.</P>
<P>The ugly duckling of the threesome is Viggo Mortensen, who's pretty boy
looks make him more of a candidate for Melrose Place than the big
screen.  His chin dimple is a huge distraction, rivaling only Harry
Hamlin in terms of size and depth.  I spent too much time trying to
think of funny things to jam in there – a tennis ball, a rubber chicken,
Sandy Duncan's glass eye.  In certain light, Mortensen strikes a
disturbing resemblance to Douglas.</P>
<P>The real heroes of the film are, as always, behind the scenes.
Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (The Crow) keeps everything dark but
bathes the leads in a warm overhead light.  The score, composed by James
Newton Howard (E.R.), is both eerie and precarious, and the direction
(Andrew Davis, The Fugitive – no stranger to making really old guys look
good) adds a classy touch to the mix.</P>
<P>Yeah, it's not The Spanish Prisoner, but that's like comparing apples
and oranges.  Or maybe apples and orange Jello.</P>
