<P>     I don't think any American filmmaker in my lifetime has had his
personal life as closely associated with his films as Woody Allen. For 25
years, his leading ladies on screen -- Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton, Mia
Farrow -- were his leading ladies off screen. When HUSBANDS AND WIVES --
his last film with Farrow before their break-up became a tabloid staple --
came out in 1992, critics observed it in terms of the disintegration of
their real-life relationship. DECONSTRUCTING HARRY was seen as a
justification for someone to live as a complete jerk provided he also
created great art (and got younger women in the process). The compulsively
auto-analytical Allen created a classic film persona, but he also created
a monster: a body of work constantly being read for clues about its
creator.</P>
<P>     SWEET AND LOWDOWN is framed as the documentary biography of a great
but little-known (read: fictional) jazz guitarist of the 1930s named Emmet
Ray (Sean Penn). Widely regarded by scholars as second only to the
legendary Django Reinhardt among jazz guitarists, Emmet also has a few
minor personal quirks. He's a womanizer. He's a kleptomaniac. He's an
alcoholic. He's a part-time pimp. He's an egomaniac. And he spends every
dollar in his pocket before he actually has it in his pocket. But he's a
player whose artistry causes women to swoon and club owners to forgive his
chronic unreliability.</P>
<P>     At first, it may sound like another apologia for the artist as
world-class clod, a la DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, but there's actually
something more going on in the character of Emmet Ray. As played by Penn,
Emmet has bought into the clich of the artist as self-destructive free
spirit. He proudly announces to his various women his need to "be free;" 
he wears the fanciest clothes to support his image; he shoots junkyard
rats for entertainment. When he tells every listener that he's the
greatest guitar player there is -- "except for this gypsy" -- he's
desperately trying to defend his life. If he's not the best there is at
his art, he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from
emotional connection.</P>
<P>     I'm coming to believe that Sean Penn may be the most talented 
American actor alive. His ability to take characters like Emmet Ray and
DEAD MAN WALKING's Matthew Poncelet and give them a sympathetic soul
without softening them is an extraordinary gift. Penn does so many things
right as Emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that Allen doesn't quite
know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant. 
The light-hearted structure, with jazz scholars commenting talking-head
style on Emmet's misadventures, becomes jarring and distracting as Emmet's
story unfolds. Episodes like Emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent
contest or his role in a botched hold-up (told in three possible
variations) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a Woody Allen
sensibility. Only when Allen holds Penn unexpectedly in the dead center of
a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd
usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what
he has working for him.</P>
<P>     Samantha Morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a
mute laundress with whom Emmet has a lengthy relationship, and it's 
certainly an impressive physical performance. It's also clear how much
Morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story, only to be
replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered Uma 
Thurman. But this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead
performance of a fascinating character, in spite of a structure always on
the verge of sabotaging that character. You might suspect that the
notoriously private Allen was using SWEET AND LOWDOWN as a first attempt
to really open himself up emotionally on screen, but found it so awkward
that he had to keep telling jokes. Or maybe he's just an imperfect
filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film.</P>
<PRE>     Naaaaahhhh ...</PRE>
