<PRE>Good Will Hunting
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Nearly everyone has  exceptional talents of some type and occasional sparks of
genius. It's rare that these skills are ever put to use because there are
thousands of reasons not to. It's so much easier to just keep on keepin' on in
the same old comfortable way.</P>
<P>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) enjoys nothing more than drinking and fighting with
his rowdy buddies from the poor Irish neighborhood of South Boston, but
there's a problem. He's secretly a mathematical genius. Working as a janitor
at MIT, he solves intricate formulas in minutes that took the professors
years. His life changes overnight when his ability is discovered by Professor
Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard).</P>
<P>Lambeau catches up with him after Hunting has been arrested for assault. He
arranges a release on two conditions: the young man meet with the professor
once a week and also see a psychologist. The former is easy: Will wants to
learn. He isn't much interested in therapy though and burns through several
doctors who refuse to continue seeing him after one session.</P>
<P>As a last resort, the instructor takes him to Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a
former college friend who now teaches at a junior college. Will and McGuire, a
fellow "Southie", make an instant connection. Both are damaged by their past
and paralyzed in the present. McGuire continues to carry the pain of his
beloved wife's death. Hunting can't get beyond his abusive childhood.</P>
<P>McGuire toils away at his thankless job, going nowhere. Hunting tells himself
that it is noble to continue in his old ways rather than explore possible
futures. Neither can get anywhere because they are more sheltered in the
familiar, as agonizing as it might be. Through their weekly encounters, each
pushes the other out of their complacency.</P>
<P>While Will is trying to decide just what it is he wants to do, he meets Skylar
(Minnie Driver), a Harvard student who steals his heart. Their relationship is
as tumultuous as that between him and McGuire. They fall in love, are filled
with doubts, fight, break up, almost get back together, break up, maybe get
back together...</P>
<P>Damon and Williams have heat in their scenes together. There's something
authentic happening as they challenge each other. As real as the interaction
between the genius and his therapist are, Will's changes don't ring completely
true. It does happen at times that a person thoroughly makes life alterations
as a result of treatment, but it's difficult to accept that it could all
happen so rapidly. McGuire's transformation seems more genuine.</P>
<P>Much more believable is the relationship between Will and Skylar. Director Gus
Van Sant ("My Own Private Idaho", "Even Cowgirls Get The Blues") captures
young love admirably. The intensity of their attractions and their hesitancies
are convincingly passionate. They aren't sure what they are doing and that's
the way that it really is.</P>
<P>Damon looks to be on the fast track towards becoming one of cinema's brightest
bad boys. He's a good looking guy who can look brooding with the best of them,
bringing to mind James Dean and the young Marlon Brando. That alone could
bring him several roles, but the fact that he has impressive acting skills
insure his longevity.</P>
<P>Robin Williams has two modes that he excels in. The first is the manic, no
holds barred wacky guy. The other is Sean McGuire. Similar to his characters
in "Dead Poet's Society" and "Awakenings", Williams plays the therapist with
humanistic depth. He's a human being with genuine emotions.</P>
<P>Ben Afflect ("Chasing Amy" and co-writer of this film along with Damon) is
Will's best friend Chuckie and steals the scenes that he's in. Off-screen
friends, their camaraderie translates to the movie.  Chuckie is a tough kid
complete with gold chains, and is in many ways the more colorful of the two.
As good as Damon is in the role, the film might have been even better with
Afflect as the lead.</P>
<P>The subtext of Bostonian classism is handled oddly. The message that manual
labor is virtuous but only for some people is a strange one. It's fine for
Chuckie to continue living in the old neighborhood and working all the
live-long day, but not for Will. This confuses the issue. Is Will embracing
his potential or betraying his roots? Not everyone can be saved, but is
Chuckie, as he claims, in fact living the fullest life he could? The film
tells us "yes", but well, maybe "no". Maybe those guys carrying bricks are
doing honest virtuous works. Or maybe they're just being told that so they
continue carrying bricks. The movie straddles the fence on the very issue it
attempts to address.</P>
<P>Will's situation at the end is a difficult one, much like real life. He is
forced to choose between his passion or his passion. It's a difficult
decision, but he makes the only one possible for a man who has awakened to
himself. Good for him.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 22 years and has yet to
decide which he believes was the best film of 97. Maybe he never will: stay
tuned. <A HREF="mailto:Redman@bvoice.com">Redman@bvoice.com</A> is one way to influence him.)</P>
