<P>     COMMANDMENTS, the first major feature from writer/director Daniel 
Taplitz, is a satire of faith, religion, and hypocrisy.  Strangely 
enough, it's also the most offbeat disaster movie to come along in years 
(note:  that's "disaster movie" not "movie disaster").  In fact, for the 
price of admission, we're treated to three different manifestations of 
Mother Nature's wrath:  a tornado (not up to TWISTER's visual effects), 
a violent thunderstorm (with associated lightning strike), and a 
hurricane (accompanied by Weather Channel graphics).  COMMANDMENTS even 
borrows VOLCANO's tag line -- "The Coast is Toast" -- during a key 
scene.  And there's a dog that makes it through the movie alive 
(although he loses a leg).</P>
<P>     Taplitz obviously intended this to be a black comedy, and, viewed 
as such, it's reasonably successful.  It is also potentially offensive 
to anyone who considers himself (or herself) a deeply religious person.  
COMMANDMENTS dares to call God "a raging psychotic" (and mean it) and 
postulates that the reason he allows suffering is that he's either a 
fraud or malevolent.  A few of the theological questions posed here are 
ones that fundamentalists tend to sidestep or talk around because they 
raise disturbing possibilities.  And some of the satire is as vicious as 
it is risky, which may alienate mainstream viewers. </P>
<P>     The main character, Seth Warner (Aidan Quinn), was a nice, well-
adjusted True Believer -- until God chose him to live a '90s remake of 
the Book of Job.  Within a short time, he lost his wife and unborn 
child, his home, and his job.  When he demands an answer from the 
Almighty, he gets struck by lightning and ends up in the hospital.  
While convalescing there, he comes up with an audacious scheme to show 
his contempt for God.  He's going to break every one of the Ten 
Commandments.  When he confesses the plan to his brother-in-law, Harry 
(Anthony LaPaglia), it doesn't provoke much of a reaction.  It seems 
that Harry routinely breaks five or six commandments a day without much 
thought.  "Get back to me when you start breaking some really serious 
ones," he says.  Meanwhile, Harry's wife, Rachel (Courteney Cox), is far 
more sympathetic to Seth's circumstances, and it doesn't take long 
before she becomes his primary target for Commandment #7 ("Thou shalt 
not commit adultery").</P>
<P>     Give Taplitz credit for casting a pair of good-looking actors as 
the leads.  Aidan Quinn and Courtney Cox are appealing and attractive, 
and they work well together.  They also make it all-but-impossible to 
dislike Seth, despite his radical and potentially-unbalanced stance.  
COMMANDMENTS occasionally strays a little too far into the romance 
arena, but I suppose that's designed as a tonic for the cynical 
perspective embraced by large chunks of the film.  Anthony LaPaglia, on 
the other hand, does a good job in the thankless role as the grim 
unbeliever (who also happens to be the narrator).  </P>
<P>     As much as I appreciate COMMANDMENTS' mocking approach to certain 
aspects of religion, the movie's theology is confused and contradictory.  
(Some might argue that all religions are defined by these 
characteristics.)  In addition to satirizing belief systems, I think 
Taplitz is trying to say something positive about faith and God, 
although I'm not sure what.  That, no matter how many commandments you 
break, if you turn back to The Lord, you will be saved?  Perhaps.  That 
knowledge and understanding come through suffering?  Maybe.  That 
violating the Ten Commandments opens the Pearly Gates?  Unlikely, but 
not impossible.  COMMANDMENTS isn't at all clear about its real feelings 
about religion, and this creates some serious questions about what the 
movie's central message is.  </P>
<P>     Nevertheless, although the mixed signals detract from COMMANDMENTS' 
basic entertainment value, they don't doom the film.  It's still 
enjoyable in a strange, unorthodox sort of way, and it looks great. 
(Cinematographer Slavomir Idziak, Kieslowski's longtime collaborator, 
also worked on DECALOGUE, perhaps the most thought-provoking cinematic 
exploration of the Ten Commandments.)  While the script isn't a 
masterpiece of twists and surprises, not everything goes as expected, 
and the audience isn't quite as far ahead of the characters as it 
initially thinks.  For anyone who isn't easily offended and doesn't mind 
forthright irreverence, COMMANDMENTS is worth checking out -- at least 
you haven't already seen five movies like it already this year.</P>
