<P>While technically well-made, Stigmata never possesses a very logical
story or enough originality to warrant a recommendation. It's a
spiritual thriller that most audiences will either find offensive or
preposterous, depending on their religious view-point. The plot asks for
too much of the viewer's co-operation, and the film itself is an
all-together numbing experience for all who get involved.</P>
<P>The Stigmata are the wounds of Christ on the wrists, feet and back.
Certain religious individuals have been afflicted by these bizarre
lacerations over the years. The latest victim appears to be single
hair-dresser Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), who has began suffering
strange demonic attacks. On more than one occasion, Frankie is admitted
to a hospital with bleeding wounds that appear to be self-inflicted.
It's only after a public attack on a subway train that the Vatican
begins to take notice. They send a Roman Catholic Priest named Andrew
Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate the phenomenon, and see for
himself whether the Stigmata are involved. One argument to prove
otherwise is that Frankie does not attend church, and the victims are
always `deeply religious people'.</P>
<P>Video director Rupert Wainwright is behind the camera for Stigmata, and
his sense of style oozes through every frame. The entire movie is shot
in a bizarre tone of bleached colors. It looks as if Wainwright was
glazed over the film, accentuating certain colors with a neon tint and
blocking out others. He also uses stylish camera work, but
unfortunately, this approach grows tiresome after a while. It seems as
if when one aspect of the production is working, the other is flagging
hopelessly behind. The set-up of the story is awful, but the movie looks
great. Then, as the plot shifts into high gear, the film develops into a
reasonably competent thriller. Of course, by this time, the quick-flash
editing and camera trickery are getting old (not to mention tough on the
eyes). If you're a very patient person and you love Patricia Arquette,
then Stigmata is definitely for you.</P>
<P>For others, I would advise to stay clear. Some people are not going to
be very pleased with the religious undertones presented here. As the
story develops, the Cardinal (Jonathan Pryce) becomes worried that the
new reports could destroy the Vatican. But, despite some obvious
potential, there are few twists and turns involved in the initial story.
There's nothing particularly fresh or new. Just a plot that delivers an
occasional jolt to maintain the viewer's interest, including graphic
attack sequences that will make your head spin in a dizzying rage. Some
of these bloody scenes could have been toned down, in violence and
momentum.</P>
<P>The cast is quite good. Arquette is perfect in her role as the tormented
twenty-something victim, but it's the Vatican members who make the
biggest impression. The talented Byrne plays Kiernan as a wise and
authoritative individual, even when his actions seem relatively
implausible. In minor supporting roles, Pryce and Rade Sherbedgia are
both commanding. Without the willing participation of these actors,
Stigmata would have been a big, bloated mess.</P>
<P>It's not very pretty as it is, but the movie has some strengths. The
director does a fair job of involving the audience in the mindless muck,
and some of the information is moderately interesting. But all of this
is only to a point. Once Stigmata abandons it's over-the-top approach
and begins leaning toward a more conventional thriller, things
(ironically) improve. Wainwright, though, demands too much attention for
a feature-length film, and should stick to the MTV profession.</P>
<P>Who exactly is this movie for? People wanting a revised story of The
Exorcist? Even those loyal followers may be frustrated by this mixed bag
of spiritual shenanigans.  Sorry folks, no flying green phlegm here.</P>
