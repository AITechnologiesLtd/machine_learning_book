<PRE>Anaconda
A movie review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1997 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: Luis Llosa
Cast: Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz</P>
<P>Humanities quest for knowledge never ends. So a team of scientists and
film-makers travel to the Amazon to search for a legendary Indian
tribe. The party consists of anthropologist Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz)
and the camera team consisting of Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez), Danny
Rich (Ice Cube), Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson), Denise Kahlberg (Kari
Wuhrer) and Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). Early on their journey
they meet Paul Sarone (Jon Voight) whose boat is stuck on the shore.
They agree to give him a ride to the next village. He claims to know
the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe. Very soon
their friendliness backfires on the group because Sarone turns out to
be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant
anaconda and sell it to a zoo.</P>
<P>We don't have to wait too long for the giant snake. She just had a
panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course. 
Our heroes paddle around in the Amazonas as if it were the pool in
their own backyard. No wonder giant animals mistake their splashing
for a dinner bell. Our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first
victim in one big gulp. Enjoy!</P>
<P>So much for the first attempt to catch her. But who would want to
catch a giant snake with a fishing pole? Our villain Sarone shows his
soft side when he stops Terri from shooting the snake. Too bad that
anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition.
One by one she goes after the others.</P>
<P>Eric Stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is
mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure. The rest of the
crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of
the movie had planned. However the scenes without the anaconda are
rather boring. Whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a
laugh. The snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous
animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster. Her
attacks always follow the same plan: one last hypnotic look - she's
looking at you, kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her
victim and starts to gush it down. Mostly we don't see the act of
devouring. But she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging
middle part. Whoever did the special effects on this movie may have
wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes. Maybe then the
anaconda model would have looked more real.</P>
<P>The animatronics are somewhat more believable. But that didn't work
for the strangling scenes. Don't go see the movie for the F/X. They
are everything but up-to-date.</P>
<P>The viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her
surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team. We may
doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work. A
well known American science magazine is also mentioned in the credits,
but I will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its
reputation. The majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon
as the credits start rolling, anyway.</P>
<P>What kind of audience is the target group for this movie? Hard to say.
This can't be a serious horror movie, or can it? See for yourself.</P>
