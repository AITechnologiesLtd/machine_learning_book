The Odd Couple II (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>So, it's thirty years later, and Oscar and Felix are together again.  That
might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the "odd
couple" of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have been reunited in several recent
movies:  1993's "Grumpy Old Men," 1995's "Grumpier Old Men," and 1997's "Out to
Sea" (i.e. "Grumpiest Old Men").  So, "The Odd Couple II" (i.e. "The Grumpiest
Old Men of All, Really") seems just another entry in a tired series.</P>
<P>The plot is even similar to that of "Grumpy Old Men" in that Lemmon and
Matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their
children.  Oscar's son (Jonathan Silverman) and Felix's daughter (Lisa Waltz)
are getting married, and former roommates Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar
Madison (Matthau) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . . . then
hilarity ensues.  Well, a few chuckles ensue anyway.</P>
<P>Neil Simon, the award-winning playwright who created Oscar and Felix, provides
the screenplay, which is a shock, because the script is a piece of talentless
hackwork from beginning to end.  Unlike the original play/movie, "Odd Couple
II" doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters. 
Instead, it depends upon a series of humorous situations:  Oscar and Felix lose
the car over a cliff, are caught smuggling Mexicans over the border, take up
with two women on the run from their violent husbands (the women are played by
Christine Baranski of "Cybill" and Jean Smart of "Designing Women"), and hitch
a ride with a man who dies in the desert.</P>
<P>The original 1968 movie "The Odd Couple" remains a classic comedy.  It
introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies
and sitcoms ever since.  It was the second outing for the Lemmon/Matthau team
(which debuted in 1966's "The Fortune Cookie"), and they made a couple more
worthwhile comedies, "The Front Page" (1974) and "Buddy Buddy" (1981), before
going their separate ways.  The reunion of Lemmon and Matthau in "Grumpy Old
Men" six years ago was delightful, and its sequel seemed appropriate because it
tied up some loose ends from the first movie.  But "Out to Sea" and "The Odd
Couple II" are just beating a grumpy old horse.  (You can add Lemmon's "My
Fellow Americans," i.e. "Grumpy Old Presidents," to that list, too.)  Let's
hope that Hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do.  Let's hope
also that we see Neil Simon's name on movies that do it justice (this is his
first since 1993's "Lost in Yonkers").</P>
