<P>Rounders has a good poker face, but a light two pair behind it.</P>
<P>A review of Rounders by James Brundage</P>
<P>Clichés. They exist in our everyday lives in the form of platitudes and in
our everyday situations in the form of idiosyncratic events. In movies,
clichés exist simply as cliches. The single word covers whatever we've seen
before, or rather seen before so many times its trite. I guess my definition
of cliché, however, is warped by how many movies I've seen.</P>
<P>To any normal viewer walking into Rounders, they'll come out with a smile on
their face. They may come out knowing more about poker, too. They also will
come out with a slightly funny look on their face because of the highly
technical talk and barrage of New York City slang. A good example is the
title, which, for all people who are probably wondering what on earth it
means, a rounder is street slang for a card shark good enough to make it his
or her living.
But then comes the movie buff. The movie buff, he'll look at the film and
he'll see right through it like an actual Rounder reading a player's hand
without looking at it. He'll see what lurks behind the sharp, well-acting
eyes of such stars as Matt Damon, (Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan)
Edward Nortan (The People vs. Larry Flynt), John Malkovich (In the Line of
Fire) , who, don't get me wrong, did great jobs in their part. He'll hear
the lines that seem so average. He'll spend his two odd hours enjoying the
movie for the poker, but not for the film itself.</P>
<P>It's not that the film is bad. It's a two pair. But, problem is, it had to
go down charted waters to go into the uncharted ones. It's enjoyable. It's
fun. You may come out feeling like you won, you may come out feeling like
you lost. I guess the point is this : seeing Rounders is like playing poker.
If you only play part of the time, you'll have fun. If you're a pro, it's
simply taking care of business.</P>
