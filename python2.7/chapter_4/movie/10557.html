<P>   Psychologists and journalists seem almost prosaic when
they discuss mid-life crisis and post-menopausal syndrome. 
To find a more lyrical expression of the dubious pleasures of
these phenonema, you'd have to turn to literature, and when
you direct your attention to the novelists you could not do
better than select Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway."  In her
novel, which was first published in 1925 and which deals with
the period immediately following World War I in England,
Woolf creates a 52-year-old woman, the title figure, who
seems to plunge into late-mid-life straits one morning and to
reconcile herself to her plight by the evening.  Experimenting
with interior monologues and numerous stream-of-
consciousness flashbacks, Ms. Woolf constructs a story to
which a great many of us can relate in a book which is
considered by some literary critics to be her masterpiece.</P>
<P>  Because of the fluidity of its telling--particularly in its early
segment in which Mrs. Dalloway introduces the movie
audience to many characters both in the present and her
youthful bloom--the novel adapts easily enough to the movie
medium.  In director Marleen Gorris' ("My Antonia") hands
with the adaptation of the principal performer's right-hand
woman, Eileen Atkins, the First Look Pictures interpretation of
this thoughtful piece highlights both the satirical take on the
British upper classes and the somber drama of a woman in
distress.  You come away from this movie with a better
understanding of two of its principals, "What does the brain
matter, when compared with the heart?"</P>
<P>   Centered on Mrs. Dalloway, who is played by Vanessa
Redgrave--a luminous woman considered by some the world's
finest actress--the story unfolds in a tony section of London
on a sunny day in June 1923 as Mrs. Dalloway (Vanessa
Redgrave) gleefully prepares for a party by stopping in a
Bond Street florist's shop and walking spiritedly about a park
announcing plans for "my party."  Despite her outward show
of happiness, which is genuine so far as we can see, she is
inwardly troubled by a decision she made some 30 years
back when she chose a safe marriage to a successful
politician who still loves her and rebuffed the entreaties of an
impetuous, adventurous young man.  As she begins to relate
her torment to the movie audience, Sue Gibson's camera
plunges us into Clarissa Dalloway's youth, revealing her
courtship with Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen) and baring her
20-year-old self as performed by the lovely Natascha
McElhone.  While she is apparently footloose and fancy-free
with this spontaneous young man, she is bewildered by her
sexual feelings toward her best friend Sally (Lena Headey), 
who at one point prances naked throughout Clarissa's home
and unselfconsciously embraces and kisses her pal.  As
though the two brash young people were not enough for her
fragile emotions, she is pursued as well by the somewhat
stodgy Richard Dalloway (Robert Portal), who is determined
to make his mark in politics and appears to promise her a
safe, comfortable, frivolously bourgeois life filled with teas,
parties, and idle chatter.</P>
<P>   In a fragment of the story seemingly unrelated, we are
made privy to an account of a disturbed fellow, Septimus
Warren Smith (Rupert Graves), shell-shocked from an
experience during the war in Italy, in which he witnessed the
sudden death by a explosion of his fellow soldier and
comrade, Evan.  We are soon to see a parallel between
Septimus's life and that of Clarissa--both share a backdrop of
homosexual feelings, both are afflicted with demons, and both
have contemplated suicide.  (Perhaps the most interesting
aspect of the movie is the subtext in which novelist Virginia
Woolf, who took her own life, has projected her passions onto
this disturbed young man.)</P>
<P>   Particularly suited to the medium of film is director Gorris's
lavish evocation of the life of a snobbish British society of the
1920s, a haughtiness that has by no means disappeared in
that thoroughly class-conscious isle.  Miss Kilman (Selina
Cadell) effectively conveys the religious extremism of one
sector of the upper caste, insisting that "there is wisdom in
suffering," and tries to inflict her ideology onto Clarissa's
beautiful 17-year-old daughter Elizabeth (Katie Carr)--who is
strangely infatuated with this older woman.  The film's
lingering exposition builds up to its most striking segment, as
guests arrive for Mrs. Dalloway's party and, for the most part,
engage in trivial and prevaricating conversation.  It is here
that the movie shines, utilizing the technique of inner
monologue as did Eugene O'Neill in "Strange Interlude" to
contrast with the outward conversation.  While lavishing
compliments on her guests, Clarissa shares with us--and with
us in the movie audience only--her true feelings about the
prigs and uglies in attendance.  When Peter, the true love of
her youth, arrives unexpectedly, her spirit soars, an incident
which only makes her ponder once more on the mistake she
may have made in choosing her loving but stuffy husband.</P>
<P>   "Mrs. Dalloway" has the Merchant-Ivory look, a view that
should be taken as an entirely positive measure.  The entire
ensemble, but especially Ms. Redgrave, convey the flights of
feeling that entangle their lives, the sudden changes of fervor
that make life both exciting and anxiety-ridden.  Mrs.
Dalloway's ultimate reconciliation, which is furthered by news
of the fate of the shellshocked young man who is about to be
involuntarily sent to an institution for "rest" by an unfeeling
duo of psychologists, is credible, dramatic, and moving. Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 97 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
