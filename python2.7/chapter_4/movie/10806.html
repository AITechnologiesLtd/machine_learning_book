<PRE>COPLAND</PRE>
<P>Director: James Mangold
Cast:        Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta,
Anabella Sciorra</P>
<P>The first thing you notice about this movie is the excessive weight being
lugged around by the actors. There has been considerable publicity about
the twenty kilos that Stallone piled on but nothing has been mentioned
about the appearance of flubber on the other actors in the film. I fear it
is because, while Stallone deliberately put the weight on himself, the
other actors have let themselves go in the past year or so. Harvey Keitel
is no longer the tight, taut body he was in MEAN STREETS and Ray Liotta is
obviously been gorging on ring-dings due, no doubt, to the fact that he
hasn't been in a Scorsese movie since GOODFELLAS. On the other hand, Robert
De Niro, while he isn't exactly resembling RAGING BULL days, seems to be
enjoying his meals at his Tribeca restaurant a bit too much, whereas Cathy
Moriarty thought it may be a good career move to do the De Niro thing and
look like Jake La Motta. All in all, the stellar cast of this film carries
some excessive baggage in more ways than one.</P>
<P>Weight issues aside, COPLAND is a well-structured, well-cast, well-acted,
well-photographed and well-directed film. While it is no GOODFELLAS, it has
all the ingredients of a better than average cop/corruption movie. The cast
is mind-boggling. It was great to see Keitel with De Niro again, Liotta
with De Niro, Keitel with Liotta, Sciorra with a white guy and Stallone
with someone else other than Talia Shire and Burt Young. </P>
<P>The film centres on an attempted police cover-up over a cop shooting a
couple of crack-addicted black folk (for a change). The young cop, being so
distressed, jumps off the George Washington Bridge. But did he jump? We
find out later that his uncle (Keitel) set it up so that he could get away
with the killing but things don't go to plan. Things become messy and now
the uncle has no choice but to save his own ass by actually killing his
adopted nephew. Stuck in the middle of all this is Freddie (Stallone), the
sherrif of the town where these policeman reside. The police town "where
everyone feels safe to cross the street" is Garrison in New Jersey (I
didn't think anyone was safe in Jersey), just over the Washington Bridge
from where the cop allegedly jumped from. Freddy knows that the kid is
alive and now has the dilemma of either doing nothing and keeping his
police friends and quiet job or he could do something for himself, his
career and justice, Amen. Guess which option Stallone chooses?</P>
<P>This film could have been a turkey. Stallone could have flexed his muscle
and turned his character from a repressed loner to a Rambo-like law
enforcer. But no, instead we have Stallone giving a terrific performance
and his best one sinceum,well...Rocky 1. His usual droopy eyes and
incoherent mumbling are perfect for a character who lacks the confidence
and self-esteem to take any decisive action (talk about a stretch) until he
is forced too. While the film is not short of action, opting to delve a bit
more into the characters than the usual Hollywood fare, the predictable
final shoot-out is a knockout. It is shot with a muffled sound to reflect
Stallone's impaired hearing and the silence is deafening.</P>
<P>The heavyweights put in their usual strong performances, especially Keitel
who, thank God, isn't playing another sweet-natured middle-aged man and
plays what he was born to play: a baddie. The surprise packet is Stallone.
His performance is a revelation. There is a beautiful scene with Anabella
Sciorra where she asks him why he hasn't married and he gives her this
dopey, alcohol-induced stare and says "Because the good ones are taken" and
his head falls on her shoulder. It is such a touching and restrained
performance that leaves you wanting more. I want more of Stallone like
this. More sensitive, caring and lovey-dovey. More acting and less high
testoserone, macho, American flag-waving bullshit. Give me a character I
can work with. Despite my wishes, I hear Stallone is planning another Rambo
film and his next film is a mindless action flick. Oh well, it was good
while it lasted.</P>
