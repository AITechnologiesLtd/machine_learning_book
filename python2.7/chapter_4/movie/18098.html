<PRE>Entrapment
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (Out Of ****)</PRE>
<P>If the real world were like some recent Hollywood films, most of the couples
strolling down the street would be 60 year old men with women in their 20s.
The older women and younger guys would be left sitting around playing euchre.</P>
<P>This does happen occasionally although not at the frequency that Sean Connery
and Clint Eastwood would have us believe. What is the appeal? Freud suggests
that women look for their fathers and older men make good big daddies.</P>
<P>The more likely explanation, according to some theories, is the biological
hardwiring left over from prehistoric days. Subconsciously, men seek
childbearing potential and women look for protection from the dangerous
beasties for their offspring. In our society older men are the more powerful.
As Henry Kissinger supposedly observed, "Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."</P>
<P>(Of course Kissinger's comment was self-serving, he being an extremely
powerful man at the time. It would be like me proposing the idea that writing
movie reviews is the ultimate aphrodisiac - and I can assure you that has
_never_ worked.)</P>
<P>In the alternate dimension of cinema, the explaination is a bit simpler. A
young romantic interest asserts the virility of the leading man and gives the
males in the audience something to look at. As the adventure heroes age, they
still have a box office draw, but need some propping up.</P>
<P>The film industry is slower in recognizing the appeal of mature women. There
are a few roles available (Sigourney Weaver is over 50), but they are rare.</P>
<P>I could go on about this topic and am tempted to. It's much more interesting
than the film this column is supposed to be about.</P>
<P>Connery is Robert "Mac" MacDougal, a famed art thief so successful that now he
pulls jobs just for the thrill of it. When insurance investigator Virginia
Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) convinces her boss that Mac is behind a recent
theft, she's on his trail.</P>
<P>She teams up with Mac to catch him in the act. Or is she actually a thief
herself and needs his help? Or is something else entirely going on?</P>
<PRE>And it's all just so-so.</PRE>
<P>The opening sequence involves a high-tech heist with the thief hanging upside
down outside a skyscraper and breaking in to a heavily protected room. A half
hour later one of the characters drops a supposed bombshell about that scene
that anyone with eyes and half a brain has already figured out. </P>
<P>Connery is a charismatic as ever. As he ages, he is no longer the agile James
Bond, but his acting skills have only increased. This is certainly not his
greatest role, but it's virtually impossible for him to be uninteresting.</P>
<P>Zeta-Jones captured the imagination of the movie-going public in last year's
"Zorro". She appears to have some talent, but here she's mostly eye candy for
the males in the audience. A scene where she's clad in a skin-tight outfit and
moving snake-like through a series of security lasers appears designed
primarily to show us what an impressive posterior she possesses.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, most of the time there's not a great deal of chemistry between
the two. They connect for a few moments, but usually it's as though they are
in different rooms. This part of the formula doesn't work.</P>
<P>There is an abundance of wasted potential. Ving Rhames, as Mac's partner, is
on screen for only seconds. Will Patton is Virginia's boss but his character
is boring and serves no function. Maury Chaykin is something like you might
expect if Marlon Brando played Jabba The Hutt, but is oddly understated for
such an over-the-top role.</P>
<P>Understated may be the theme for the movie. Much of the action feels lame. The
sexual tension doesn't click. The plot maneuverings are too often transparent.</P>
<P>The film features a few entertaining bits. The climax atop the world's tallest
buildings in Kuala Lumpur features its share of excitement. A New Year's Eve
theft depends upon a bank's last minute Y2K testing making this the first film
to incorporate a millennium bug plot device.</P>
<P>The primary appeal is the two stars. Connery's screen presence is like an old
friend. Zeta-Jones' butt is nice, but I'm not sure its worth the price of a ticket.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has been writing a film column much like this one for over 23
years but refuses to believe he falls into the "older man" category yet.
