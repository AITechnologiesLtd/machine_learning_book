<P>   With the recent exception of Emily Watson's Maggie and
Daniel Day-Lewis's Danny Flynn in "The Boxer," working-class
people are consistently portrayed as craggy-faced, sullen, and
just plain homely.  Perhaps the hard life of physical work
takes its toll, or maybe it's just the lack of hope, the
resignation, that reflects in their features.  In "Nil By Mouth,"
Gary Oldman's biographical drama of the actor's childhood in
the slums of South London, Oldman represents the brooding
men he remembers as violent, drug-addicted, and foul-
mouthed while his women are resigned, accepting, even
loving in their own ways.  While "Nil By Mouth" is not Gary
Oldman's own family portrait, he has filled the screen with
people he has known in his childhood and whom he looks
upon with an patina of sympathy and understanding despite
their profane manner and primitive culture.</P>
<P>   "Nil By Mouth," which was a selection of the 1997 Cannes
Film Festival and even supplied a best-actress win for Kathy
Burke, is not what anyone would call narrative-driven.  Its
chief merit is as a showcase for some remarkable acting
talent--its principal characters absolutely believable in their
rage, desperation, and ultimately their fondness and warmer
side.  Its lavish disregard for plot, however, makes this a
difficult film to sit through, as it cannot be said to have a real
dramatic arc and, what's more, those behaviors which are
exhibited are perfectly predictable.  This latter deficiency is on
display particularly in the opening half-hour, in which Oldman
wants to impress on every member of the audience the
ambiance of the South London district of his childhood. 
Focusing particularly on Raymond (Ray Winstone), who has
no regular job but apparently acquires his poundsterlings
through a network of scams, Oldman opens with a family
scene as the locals gather in a downscale night club to be
entertained by a comedian imparting bawdy jokes to a crowd
that alternately pays him an ear and tell jokes of their own to
their family circles.  Ray, his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), and
Valerie's brother-in-law Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) smoke up a
storm, drink Smirnoff's vodka, and when the men sit around
without their women they discuss their experiences in strip
joints with all the enthusiasm of adolescents who have just
acquired their legal ID's and sample the fare of the adult
world.  </P>
<P>   We learn quite a bit about these people but little or nothing
about the framework that has mired them in their futile straits. 
Ray is the most violent member of the group, one who looks
for excuses to swing his fists.  In the picture's most appalling
moments, he punches and kicks his wife, accusing her with
no evidence whatever of having an affair with a neighbor. 
When Valerie lands in the hospital, she follows the
neighborhood code--mum's the word--and claims to have
been knocked over by a hit-and-run driver.  In another
episode of mayhem, Ray virtually breaks the nose of his
brother-in-law, Billy, whom he accuses of robbing his cache of
drugs.   In one unexpected setting, Ray's mother-in-law Janet
(Laila Morse) looks without disgust on his snorting of drugs,
even providing money to maintain the wastrel's habit--
anything to keep the family together, particularly since her
daughter is pregnant.</P>
<P>   An American audience--and perhaps an upscale English
crowd--may have difficulty with the dialect spoken by these
folks, which appears to challenge "Trainspotting" for the most
unintelligible dialogue and would provide a lifetime of work for
Professor Henry Higgins should he have the unlikely bad
fortune of being employed by them.  "Nil By Mouth" would
probably have more success on the legitimate stage.  Oldman
has not opened up his film too much to show give us a
neighborhood ambiance but hones in on the indoor locations
favored by this group of people who are going nowhere fast. 
The upbeat ending is a bit of a surprise: we wonder if Ray
and the woman he hospitalized have truly reconciled or
whether Oldman is merely providing us with a contrast to all
the bleakness in order to demonstrate what might have been
if only...</P>
<P>   Kathy Burke's modulated performance is the item to watch. 
While Ray Winstone in the role of Valerie's husband, can
send the celluloid ablaze with his tempestuous fury, Ms.
Burke's rendition of an abused wife who fears separation
more than anything else is the three-dimensional portrait that
redeems the otherwise predictable and altogether flaccid
narrative.  Rated R.  Running Time: 128 minutes.  (C) 1998
