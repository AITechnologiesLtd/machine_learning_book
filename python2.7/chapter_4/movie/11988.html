<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        Time and time again, we see period films that revolve around the
primitive idea of arranged or forced marriages.  We learn about and feel
sympathy for the peasant boy who can't marry the rich heiress, whom he
loves, because of his lower placement in the caste system (such as in
the excellent Washington Square); and, sometimes, it's the woman unable
to marry a man of higher class.  This situation is familiar, and often
works as a plot device, but there has to be a spin somewhere.  Dangerous
Beauty, which tells the story of a young woman in 1500s Venice, is a
film that begins with this premise.  What makes the movie interesting is
her method of avoiding the problem:  she becomes a prostitute.</P>
<P>        Of course, she's not an average prostitute:  she's a courtesan--an
educated, intelligent, and undeniably sexy woman who makes men feel
important in numerous ways, and gets paid for it.  The woman's name is
Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), and, upon falling in love with a
young senator named Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), is made a courtesan by
her mother (Jacqueline Bisset).  Becoming a courtesan doesn't change
Veronica's social class, but, interestingly, it makes an affair with
Marco easier, despite his marriage to a cold and quiet woman.</P>
<P>        Conflict arises mainly towards the end, when the Holy Inquisition
assumes control of Venice during a plague which kills thousands of
people.  Believed to be spreading the disease through witchcraft,
Veronica is put on trial for her apparent crimes against God.</P>
<P>        Dangerous Beauty is a lot of things:  it's a love story about two
well-developed and well-acted characters; it's a period film rich in
detail and atmosphere; and it's a political statement of the status of
women in the 1500s.  All of these elements are ultimately successful in
various ways, and this is due, in part, to the steady direction by
Marshall Herskovitz, and the sharp script by Jeannine Dominy (adapted
from the factual novel The Honest Courtesan by Margaret Rosenthal). 
It's remarkable, really, that the film manages to develop each of these
elements while still proving lively entertainment.</P>
<P>        It's liveliness often springs from McCormack's energetic and convincing
performance.  Last seen (and underused) in Braveheart, McCormack
effortlessly proves herself as a leading actress, and I find it a marvel
that this huge, sumptuous role was not given to an actress who has
"proven" herself (not just in talent, but in box-office draw, for I am
speaking of a Warner Bros. film here).  McCormack, aside from radiating
a physical beauty that does, in fact, feel dangerous (in a good way),
she wistfully slides through this film, never hitting a foul note.  Her
performance is both strong and subtle, and developed fully.  We get a
feel for her innocence when she is a maid in the beginning of the film,
but we can also see her strength in her eyes.  Later, as in the
satisfying conclusion, she need not raise her voice to prove her power: 
her calculated words are enough.</P>
<P>        Matching McCormack's talent is Rufus Sewell (Dark City, Hamlet), an
intense actor who gives this rich senator life and verve.  Sewell, like
McCormack, attests with this role his versatility and vigor, and shows
once again that he is capable of holding an entire film with his
presence.  The scenes between the two leads--particularly the love
scenes--are electric:  their dialogue flows smoothly, and they
compliment each other physically.  Also good are the supporting
performers, including Jacqueline Bisset and Oliver Platt.  </P>
<P>        The tone of Dangerous Beauty is complete, and always pleasing.  The
primary colors used are gold and light browns, and each scene seems to
be shot with filters that soften the image.  The sets and costumes, too,
are exceptional and noticeable, and all of this creates a film that
never falters with its mood.  The uniqueness of Venice is done justice
here.</P>
<P>        Perhaps most interesting (and unexpected) about the film is the
statement it successfully conveys.  Here is a woman who finds her own
salvation in going against the typical route of women (which, normally,
leads to being a housewife and a mother to many children).  She doesn't
just reject this monotony, however--she spits in its face by becoming
something that most "ladies" find degrading and limiting.  Veronica
loves what she does, and is happy because of it.  This is not a feminist
film, mind you--there is no male-bashing here.  What there is, however,
is a detailed illustration of how much men desire women, and to what
lengths they will go to have what they need.  </P>
<P>        Like all films, Dangerous Beauty isn't perfect.  It is fairly
predictable in its plotting, and the climax, though satisfying, falls
prey to some seriously heavy-handed emotions.  But these are minor
quibbles:  Dangerous Beauty is engrossing from start to finish.  I
admire films that are complete in their endeavors, and a film that
successfully develops multiple themes while actually making us care
about the characters will forever be welcome.  Dangerous Beauty also
supplies a little history lesson about the importance of courtesans and
the role of women in this society.  And while I am often skeptical about
history lessons learned in films, it's nice to know that a film can, on
occasion, provide more than simple entertainment.</P>
