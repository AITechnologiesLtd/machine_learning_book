<PRE>The Gift  * * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Starring: Cate Blanchett, Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, Katie Holmes, Greg 
Kinnear, Gary Cole, Hilary Swank, Kim Dickens, Michael Jeter, J.K. Simmons.
Directed by: Sam Raimi
Running Time: 111 minutes
Rated R: violence, language, sexuality, nudity.</P>
<P>Movies that start out, and capture me from the opening titles are movies that 
do not exist that much. The last movie to make me sit up and watch every 
single moment of the movie was 1999's "American Beauty", of course this year 
we had excellent movies such as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Traffic", 
and now "The Gift". It's a horror thriller directed by film master Sam Raimi 
that is so moody, well acted, and well written that in the end it is a treat 
to watch.</P>
<P>Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) is a young woman in a small-town, who is 
widowed and lives with her three young boys. She brings in the people of this 
town because she is a psychic, and she gives readings for people and they 
give her as in her own words "donations". Annie, of course in this small town 
has a few enemies one of whom is Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), he believes 
she is a witch and she told his wife Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) to 
leave him because he physically abuses her. Valerie however thinks of Annie 
as a friend as does the mentally unstable Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi), who 
is oddly confused about having nightmares about a blue diamond.</P>
<P>When Annie is called to her son's school after he is in a fight, she meets 
the principal Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear) which she finds her self attracted 
too, however he is engaged to the young Jessica King (Katie Holmes). When 
Annie sees Wayne and Jessica together she gets a bad feeling that overcomes 
her and sees an image that she will never forget. At a party she sees these 
two again, and goes out to get some fresh air and catches Jessica with a 
wealthy lawyer David Duncan (Gary Cole), she doesn't disrupt the two, but 
learns of the disappearance of Jessica a few days later. The cops are drawn 
to Annie to try to help with her psychic abilities. As Annie is about to find 
out, there is a lot more than what it seems that lies beneath this 
disappearance. </P>
<P>Sam Raimi has done such a great job with "The Gift" that I am proud to name 
it one of my best films of 2000. The thing that stands out the most in the 
film however is the acting, and especially that of Cate Blanchett in the lead 
role. To me she gives the best female performance I have seen, and definitely 
deserves an Oscar Nomination for her role. She is a very beautiful actress in 
Hollywood, and it's nice to see her starring in good movies (Her last being 
"The Talented Mr. Ripley"). In the supporting roles Greg Kinnear gives a 
somewhat bland performance, and doesn't really suit his character. After his 
Oscar Nominated role in 1997's "As Good As It Gets", he hasn't had really 
many big roles. Keanu Reeves is not one of my favorite actors at all, but he 
gives it all he can, and in the end Keanu Reeves actually clocks in a great 
performance as a realistically scary man. Hilary Swank fresh off her Oscar 
Winning role in 1999's best film "Boys Don't Cry", she gives yet another 
fantastic performance in a great but small role. Gary Cole whom is always 
good, gives a nice creepy performance as the rich lawyer. Next to Cate 
however I think Giovanni Ribisi gives the best performance in the movie as 
the mentally unstable Buddy, he gives it all he can and goes over the top in 
scenes and it works out great. Katie Holmes as the promiscuous Jessica is 
stellar in her performance, and shows she can do nudity in a non gratuitous 
style. Kim Dickens (Hollow Man) is nice in her small role also. </P>
<P>The script written by Billy Bob Thorton (whom also starred in Sam's 1998 
masterpiece "A Simple Plan") is that of a great one. The dialogue is tightly 
written, and the twists and plot changes come fast and quick. The ending is 
especially surprising, and will leave a tear in your eye, and a smile on your 
face. Sam Raimi's direction puts so much atmosphere in the film, that at 
times you almost seem like you are a character in the film. For those fans of 
Raimi check out the car Cate Blanchett drives, a nice little homage to the 
"Evil Dead" series. </P>
<P>"The Gift" is one of the best films of 2000, and one of my favorite thrillers 
in a long time. Everything in the movie stands out, from the acting, to the 
script, the direction, to the editing. I can't wait to watch this one again, 
its a winner!</P>
