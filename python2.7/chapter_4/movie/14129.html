<P>The late 70's and early 80s was a period of decadence.        Also, the end of
innocence as we now know it.  It was our last dance, our chance to be wild,
crazy, uninhibited, before the specter of AIDS unknowingly came down upon us.
I was a child of this decade, I lived through the hostage crisis, fuel
shortages, and yes...even disco.  Recently, Hollywood has grasped to relive
this era, via the movies.  Films like Boogie Nights, The Wedding Singer and
The Last Days of Disco have tried to recreate the attitude and essence, of a
time that some don't want to remember.        Some people are not proud of their
actions then, responding to questions with the response of..."Yeah, I lived
through it" and nothing more. In the annals of these dark decadent days, lies
the legend of Studio 54.  Steve Rubell's non-stop party, the place where the
rich, and average, stripped away their social titles, and just had fun,
ignorant of the consequences.</P>
<P>This was a legend that was ripe for a good retelling, it had sex, scandal,
reckless abandon, stars, drugs, and a complete and total lack of basic
morality.  Why then, is this telling of the story so boring.  You would think
that a movie about the one place on earth where nothing was taboo,   and the
people who inhabited it, would be a story of never-ending energy.  But alas,
this movie falls flat, very flat.  The reason..the characters, and the script.
I didn't care what happened to the characters, because I didn't care about
them.  The director tried to cram so many stories down your throat, that he
never bothered to develop any of them, so that we could care.</P>
<P>Also, the music, the one thing that most people of that era remember, is the
music.  The lemming-like infectiousness of such songs as YMCA, Hot Stuff, and
Don't Leave Me This Way, made disco memorable, if not despised, by most back
then.  But 54 fails miserably to cash in on the current retro trend.  The
Wedding Singer, Grosse Pointe Blank, and Romy and Michelle's HS Reunion
succeeded in this facet.</P>
<P>It is hard to judge the performances, because the script is do devoid of any
cohesiveness.  Ryan Phillippe, (I Know What You Did Last Summer's pretty
blond stud-o-the-moment) has nowhere near the acting ability to carry this
film (He should contact Mark Wahlberg, for "80s Movie-Acting Lessons
101")..you, my son, are definitely no John Travolta. He seems more concerned
with flexing his ab's, and grooming his blond locks, then actually acting.
Salma Hayek is radiant, and oozes sexuality, but she, along with husband
Breckin Meyer are given too many stories, and not enough smart dialog to make
us care. The biggest waste in this movie is Neve Campbell, not because of her
performance, as much as her purpose in the movie.  She has about 15 minutes
of screen time, and seems to serve only two purposes really.  One, to draw
hormonal teens, Scream fans, and Party- of-Fivers in, and Two, to be the
obligatory love interest.  Short of those, I fail to see the relevance of he
character here at all.        Also, an underplayed, undeveloped appearance, by the
very talented Heather Matarazzo (Welcome To The Dollhouse), who steals every
scene with Phillippe, and maybe, if more of the focus was here, we would've
cared more.</P>
<P>The true star, and shining moment of this movie, is Myers. He played his part
perfect, made you forget you were watching Wayne, or Austin Powers.  It made
me wish he was given a better script or story to flex his dramatic muscle
with. His portrayal of Rubell, in his pallid, sickly, yet relaxed exuberance,
was very well done, and for those who knew, or met Rubell, may bring back
some haunting images. His presence onscreen, is the only time the movie is
even mildly interesting.</P>
<P>Boogie Nights set the standard for movies aiming to show the decadence of
this era, and succeeded because it never tried to be too much, and made us
care, and empathize with each character.  That is this movie's greatest
failure.  A pointed analogy occurs near the climax of this movie, which was a
bit cheesy, but did make it's point.  Indeed, the party is truly over, wait
for cable, and hustle, bump and busstop, in the privacy of your own home.($$)</P>
