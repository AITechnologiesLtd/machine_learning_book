<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a staid, low-budget B- sci-fi'er about giant scorpions that come
out of a volcano in a remote part of Mexico and attack humans and cattle
in their lust for blood. It is a poorly done remake of "Them!", worth
seeing only for the efforts put forth by the great animator Willis O'
Brien, the animator of "King Kong," who did this film when he was in his
seventies.</P>
<P>When a volcano strikes a remote Mexican area, whose power is estimated
to be as great as the eruption from Vesuvius, two geologist are sent to
do a preliminary investigation, the American, Dr. Hank Scott (Richard
Denning) and his Mexican friend, Dr. Artur Ramos (Carlos Rivas). They
discover strange happenings, such as a dead policeman who emptied his
gun before dying, crushed cars, and huge footprints. They go to the
nearest village and meet Father Delgado. He tells them that there are
strange things also happening in the village, that the natives
superstitiously believe that the volcano was caused by a "demon bull," a
symbol for evil.</P>
<P>In the field investigating the effects of the volcano, the two
scientists discover a pretty lady ranch owner, Teresa Alverez (Mara
Corday), who has fallen off her horse. Hank instantly falls in love with
her and the two become very close in the next few days, as the
scientists are guests in her luxurious ranch. The scientists collect
samples and send them to the leading scientist in Mexico City, Dr.
Velazco (Carlos Múzquiz). Meanwhile, Artur finds a fossil of a scorpion
in an obsidian stone, and when he breaks the rock open, a small live
scorpion comes out, which is of a species that has been extinct for
thousands of years. At about the same time, a telephone repair man spots
a giant scorpion attacking him and tells this to Theresa, before he gets
crushed to death.</P>
<P>>From Dr. Velazco, we learn that giant scorpions have emerged from the
volcano and have come back to plague the Earth. He goes on to say, they
only come out at night and are slow-moving. When it is discovered where
the scorpions nest, the two scientists go down the deep cave by cable
car and take photographs of it, and then have the army dynamite the cave
and seal it.</P>
<P>But the scientists soon learn the danger is not over, one giant scorpion
remains on the loose and has gone on a blood lust, since they have to
have blood every 3-4 days. A plan is coordinated between the scientists
and the army, as they aim to hit it with a projectile and
electrocute it with six hundred thousand volts, and from its throat
obtain its poisonous venom so that they can have the poison available to
inject any other scorpions that might pop up.</P>
<P>The star of the film, Richard Denning, made a career of appearing in B-
sci-fi films, with his best known role being in "The Creature From The
Black Lagoon."</P>
