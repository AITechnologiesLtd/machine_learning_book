<PRE>BROKEN ARROW (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>If you know me well enough, you know that I'm a big John Woo fan.  And this
makes it hard for me to review his films.  I'll try to put this bias aside
for this review of his second US film.</P>
<P>Two Air Force officers take up a B-3 experimental bomber with two nuclear
bombs in the bomb bay.  They are going to be flying over the Utah while
being tracked by a ground station to see if they can be caught.  Riley Hale
(Christian Slater) slyly says before take-off, "When the time comes that we
have to go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass, you know?"
 During mid-flight Vic Deakins (John Travolta) tries to kill his co-pilot
Riley Hale in order to jettison the nuclear bombs.  We find out later that
Deakins is working with a businessman, Mr. Pritchett (Bob Gunton), and they
plan to make a load of cash with these nuclear devices.</P>
<P>Something goes wrong during the mid-flight fight and Hale is ejected while
Deakins jettisons the bombs and also ejects.  Hale meets up with a park
ranger (Samantha Mathis) and together they try to stop Deakins and his band
of military men from taking off with the nuclear weapons.</P>
<P>The script is by Graham Yost, whose last script was Speed.  Yost, who as
we've seen with Speed and now with Broken Arrow, is not a great writer.
His scripts need the help of a good director to come out on top, and with
both Speed (directed by Jan De Bont) and now Broken Arrow, he got what he
needed, and the films come out on top.  Yost needs to work on writing more
believable and less silly dialogue (while running down a hill to catch some
Humvees carrying the nukes, Mathis' character says to herself, "This isn't
a good idea."  Duh..)  What we don't see in Broken Arrow, as we do in Woo's
previous Hong Kong releases and in Face/Off, is the blurred difference
between the good and bad characters.  In Broken Arrow the characters are
either good or bad.</P>
<P>Woo looks to have gotten more freedom on this project he did in his debut
US film Hard Target.  He pulls out his bag of tricks and uses them to the
fullest.  These included the-endless-gun-magazine, the slow-mo, and the
double-fisted gunfights.  These all make for incredibly fun action that is
visually inspiring.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is Hans Zimmer's score for the film.  He knows how to
create themes for characters, and he shows this with his very memorable
theme for John Travolta's character Vic Deakins.</P>
<P>Broken Arrow is a loud, sometimes dumb, movie about two dueling Air Force
pilots, which is basically a long chase movie.  Suspension of disbelief is
a necessity for this film, but if you can suspend your disbelief, Broken
Arrow can be enjoyed for its amazing and visually stunning action.</P>
