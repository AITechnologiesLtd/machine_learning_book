<P>   The public fascination with movies on occult themes is
bottomless.  Given the general routines of our lives--our daily
trips to work, shopping for this and that, suburban barbecues
on weekends while city people go to the zoo--we seek out
drama and conflict more exotic than that of ritual battles
between political candidates who debate such trivial matters
as whether a building on a deserted street should be seized
and destroyed to make room for a wider road.  In short, we
look for battles that have higher stakes than squabbles within
cities or a discordant national dialogue or even rows between
nations.  We want nothing less than a clash between good
and evil, in which selling your soul to the devil does not mean
taking bribes to award a contract to x or y construction
company but a literal conjuring up of the Lucifer to achieve
power beyond ordinary human scope.  </P>
<P>   Few directors can comply with audience demands to be
pulled out of their mundane worlds better than the sixty-six
year old Roman Polanski.  We can understand Polanski's
interest in the obsessions of the principal characters of his
absorbing new movie "The Ninth Gate" when we grasp his
difficult youth.  Polanski had a terrifying childhood.  At the
age of eight, his parents were shipped off from Krakow,
Poland, to a Nazi concentration camp where his mother died. 
Roman escaped from the Jewish quarters (ghetto) of Krakow
before its destruction, was hidden by Catholic families as he
wandered the Polish countryside, and in more than one
instance became the victim of a sadistic game by Germans:
They used him for target practice, watching Polanski dodge
bullets by soldiers who used him for target practice in much
the way that Ralph Fiennes' character exercised his power in
Steven Spielberg's blockbuster, "Schindler's List."  His early
childhood, then, was given over to more fear than perhaps
the most abused kids in the U.S. today experience.  This
anxiety translates to his films, and though Polanski is capable
of breaking loose from his characteristic style with an
exquisitely literary and cinematic "Tess," he is best known
today for his adaptation of Ira Levin's modern thriller,
"Rosemary's Baby"--in which an innocent woman does not
suspect the bargain that her husband has made with
satanic forces.</P>
<P>   Something of "Rosemary's Baby" comes forth in "The Ninth
Gate," though not until the penultimate scene.  Most of the
lengthy--but not overlong--drama accommodates a
supernatural tone, but happily,  no ridiculous aliens burst
from the abdomens of human beings and no stereotypical
bloodsuckers seduce their victims into eternal, if profane, life. 
Polanski relies on a noir inflection, shooting many of his
scenes in dimly lit interiors and displaying his central
character as a chain smoker with scholarly, owlish glasses
who becomes involved  with two fetching women that could
have come from a Hammett novel.</P>
<P>   The talented and diversified Johnny Depp performs in the
role of Dean Corso, a man with an enormous knowledge of
rare books who is also a mercenary willing to sell his talents
to the highest bidder.  Essentially a book detective, he takes
on a commission from the fabulously rich collector Boris
Balkan, Ph.D. (Frank Langella), whose vast personal library
includes the exceedingly rare "The Nine Gates of the
Kingdom of Shadows" published during the 1600s and
allegedly co-authored by Lucifer himself.  Balkan offers a
huge sum to Corso, who must travel to Portugal and France
to find the other two copies of this rare book, presumably to
determine whether Balkan's copy is authentic or a forgery. In
the course of his investigation he interviews the
sinuous Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), recently widowed from the
previous owner of the book, and is followed everywhere by a
mysterious, green-eyed blonde whose name is not revealed
(Emmanuelle Seigner) but whose identity becomes clearer in
the concluding scenes.</P>
<P>   Frank Langella, not unaccustomed to villainous roles during
his career on stage and screen, looms physically large in this
production.  Wearing an unusual rug on his head, an
expensive pin-striped suit on his body, and a heavy pair of
eyeglasses on the bridge of his nose, Langella is convincing
as a man whose millions do not provide what he is really
after--more power than that enjoyed by any human being. 
Since the engravings in the books he seeks would complete
a set of illustrations he already owns and allow him to conjure
the devil--much as Rabbi Loew animates an avenging
monster in Paul Wegener's 1920 film "The Golem"--Balkan
will stop at nothing to gain possession of the volumes.  </P>
<P>   Whether you think the film comes apart near the finish as
many critics have offered depends really on your age.  A
youthful audience may turn on from the unleashing of 
psychic energy as black-robed men listen to a sinister
supplication in Latin, while a more enlightened crowd will
appreciate the human aspects of the drama, especially
the remarkably adept performance by Depp.  "The Ninth
Gate" is far and away superior to the blatantly exploitative
"End of Days," avoiding most of the special effects beloved of 
Peter Hyams while displaying a humorous scene involving
Jose Lopez Rodero who is f/x'd as a pair of twins, Pablo and
Pedro Ceniza.  Though the final minute of the film will have
most of the audience scratching their heads and wondering
"Is that all?" despite its generous 132 minutes, "The Ninth
Gate" is for the most part an appropriately restrained, deftly
acted and smartly stylized with a dynamite score by Wojciech
Kilar.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 132 minutes.  (C) 2000
