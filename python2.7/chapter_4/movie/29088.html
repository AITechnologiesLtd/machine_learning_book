<P>It almost sounded too good to be true - high school cheerleaders-turned-bank
robbers, and slumber parties where they roll around together in giant piles
of cash wearing only underwear and bras.  But Sugar & Spice's PG-13 rating
dashed the hopes and dreams of men throughout the country.  The good news is
that the film probably deserved an R rating, and while the slumber party
money-rolling scene was left out, there is a slumber party money-throwing
scene.  It's not the same, but at least it's something.</P>
<P>Spice is about the A-squad cheerleading team at Lincoln High School who
decide to rob a bank to ensure the financial security of the unborn child of
the team's captain who was knocked up by the school's dreamily dumb
quarterback.  A silly concept, but rife with comedic possibilities, the film
stretches a weak script that would have been better suited for a short into
a (barely) feature length picture that, like the last big cheerleading flick
(Bring It On) tries way to hard to have witty, acidic dialogue like
Clueless.</P>
<P>Spice, which is shown almost entirely in flashback, opens with jealous
B-squad cheerleader Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff, The Practice) spilling her
guts in a police interrogation.  Lisa had nothing to do with the bank
robbery, or the events leading up to it, but happily fingers the girls who
were involved.  At first, her voiceover and the flashback technique work
well to establish the background of each of the film's characters, but it
quickly becomes very tiresome.  An alarming percentage of Spice is told with
the voiceover, which usually signals a major problem and attempted last
minute resuscitation in the editing room.</P>
<P>The five members of Lincoln A-team are the typical cross section of girls
you'd find in any teen movie.  Kansas (Mena Suvari, Loser) is the bad ass,
Hannah (Rachel Blanchard, Road Trip) is the goody-goody Bible-thumper, Lucy
(Sara Marsh) is the Harvard-bound braniac, Cleo (Melissa George, The Limey)
is obsessed with Conan O'Brien, and Diane (Marley Shelton, Never Been
Kissed) is the perpetually perky captain who becomes impregnated by Tom
Cruise-clone named Jack (James Marsden, X-Men).  That's right - Jack and
Diane.</P>
<P>When Diane realizes that she and Jack don't have enough money to take care
of their impending arrival, she hatches the idea to knock off the grocery
store bank branch she works at after school.  Diane gets the idea from
watching Point Break, and she and her cheering chums pick up robbery tips
from other bank heist films, like Dog Day Afternoon and Reservoir Dogs (even
though the latter didn't have a robbery scene) and from Kansas' convict
mother (played by an unrecognizable Sean Young, Poor White Trash).</P>
<P>There are big problems with the film, most notably the bizarre gestation
period of the American Cheerleader (or Titimus Bouncimus Maximus).  Spice
starts at the beginning of the school year, but one scene where Jack
measures the growth of Diane's stomach tells us it's August.  To make things
more confusing, Diane is seven-months pregnant at Christmas.  She also
sports the fakest looking stomach in the history of film.</P>
<P>That said, there are still a lot of really funny one-liners, and it's pretty
entertaining to watch the girls bicker before the robbery while donned in
Betty Doll masks and matching outfits.  Spice would have made a great short
and, ironically, was directed by a woman who won an award at the 1996
Sundance Festival for a short called Pig! (Francine McDougall).  There just
isn't enough material here to justify a running time of this length.
Perhaps another robbery or two would have livened things up a bit.</P>
<P>1:22 - PG-13 for language, sex-related humor and some thematic elements</P>
