<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   What *is* it about Burt Bacharach these days?  His banal, decades-old
   handiwork seems to be invading contemporary cinema at an alarming
   rate for some reason or another.  We had a plethora of Bacharach
   tunes used in memorable fashion by P.J. Hogan in MY BEST FRIEND'S
   WEDDING, and ol' Burt himself even made a cameo appearance in Jay
   Roach's supremely silly AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.
   So, after a successful 1997 run in the United Kingdom, here comes
   Stefan Schwartz's zany comedy SHOOTING FISH, serving as yet another
   homage to Bacharach -- the soundtrack is dominated by his music, the
   film's protagonists have a jukebox shrine to the popmeister in their
   bizarro home, and there's even an impromptu spirited rendition of "Do
   You Know The Way To San Jose?"  I don't know what Mr. Bacharach is up
   to, but whatever it is, it's working.</P>
<P>   Meanwhile, SHOOTING FISH is an effervescent comic romp with charm to
   spare which finally spins out of control in its third act.  The
   film's protagonists are the young team of sleek, smooth-talking Dylan
   (Dan Futterman) and awkward technical wizard Jez (Stuart Townsend),
   along with their new temp Georgie (Kate Beckinsale), and after an
   amusing prologue which depicts Dylan and Jez's innate characteristics
   as fully formed while mere little tykes growing up in respective
   orphanages, we open to find Dylan in a boardroom confidently
   demonstrating a new voice-recognition capable computer to an
   impressed business executive.  Claiming that the machine has a
   vocabulary of 80 000 words (this figure is upped on successive
   pitches), Dylan astonishes his potential customers by
   conversationally speaking to the computer, which politely responds in
   turn.  (The machine physically resembles a TRS-80, enabled with an
   appropriately tinny, HAL-like speaking voice).  It doesn't take long
   it to sink in that Dylan and Jez are con artists (as for the talking
   computer, visualize the *most* silly way in which this feat can be
   pulled off), and soon the trio are gleefully fleeing the office
   complex to the safety of their parked vehicle, advance payment
   cheques in hand.</P>
<P>   The two young men are scammers, all right, but they're likeable,
   relatively harmless ones that consider themselves present-day Robin
   Hoods ("Thin fish", Jez whispers to Dylan when a potential target
   turns out to be an elderly lady that can ill-afford to be ripped-off;
   they respectfully retreat.)  As for Georgie, she's initially not sure
   what to make of all of this, but after she's reassured that the
   proceeds of their spoils are going to orphans (a claim which isn't
   *entirely* inaccurate), she agrees to along with their exploits.</P>
<P>   SHOOTING FISH subsequently rockets through their series of misdeeds,
   and therein lies the principal weakness of the film.  It barrels
   along at such a breakneck pace that it's often a struggle to keep up
   with the developing plot.  There are points, particularly in the
   film's latter half, where one is left so dizzied by the frantically
   energetic plot zinging by that it becomes increasingly difficult to
   attempt to piece things together.  While the film has some very
   amusing elements, its wicked pacing leaves much to be desired; the
   primary narrative is maintained, but minor elements are often not
   immediately clear upon first consumption, to the detriment of the
   comedy.</P>
<P>   This is an unabashedly silly, light-hearted film, but it does
   occasionally run out of palatable comic ideas -- you know that when
   you're resorting to old inflatable doll sight gags, you're scraping
   the bottom of the barrel.  Still, the madcap hijinx of our heroes are
   generally droll and inventive, and the film has a sort of breezy and
   whimsical feel to it that helps to quash a more cynical perspective
   of the proceedings.</P>
<P>   Predictably, SHOOTING FISH is compelled to throw a love triangle into
   the mix, and a subplot deals with both Dylan and Jez vying for
   Georgie's affections.  While Dylan's the more photogenic and suave of
   the pair, Jez's feelings for Georgie are more genuine and heartfelt;
   it's no surprise whom Georgie ultimately sides with.  (Besides, the
   come-on line employed when Georgie's taken on a date to a nightclub
   isn't typically a successful one.)  The courtship's all played out
   well enough, and the characters are likeable, but there's no real
   resonance in the relationship; it's rather unengaging.</P>
<P>   What drives this film are the winning performances by its appealing
   trio of actors.  Mr. Futterman, with an assured manner and
   mischievous gleam in his eye, demonstrates good leading man
   potential, while Mr. Townsend is quite sympathetic as the awkward,
   soft-spoken Jez.  And Ms. Beckinsale, who positively exudes star
   qualities, successfully breaks type as a period piece mainstay in
   delightful fashion; lively and high-spirited, she's remarkably
   captivating.  SHOOTING FISH benefits tremendously from its impressive
   young cast.</P>
<P>   While its comedy is somewhat hit-and-miss and all of its elements
   don't satisfactorily gel in the final act, SHOOTING FISH is an
   irreverent little comedy that makes for an often pleasing lark.  The
   film's gags aren't exactly sophisticated, but with its simplistic,
   innocent comic outlook lies much of its charm.</P>
