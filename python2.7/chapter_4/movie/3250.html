<PRE>                         STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is a beautiful film from Cuba, based on a short story by
Senel Paz, "The Wolf, the Forest, and The New Man."  What makes it so
wonderful is that it is a story of tolerance.  Some people like
Strawberry and others like Chocolate.  Whatever turns you on.</P>
<P>     There is David, (Vladimir Cruz) a political science student,
quiet, loyal to Cuba.  Then there is Diego (Jorge Perugorria) who is
just the opposite; very outgoing, friendly and, unlike the straight
David, he is gay.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, the two become very good friends but when David
confides in his friend Miguel (Francisco Gatorno), another student,
that he is friends with a gay man, Miguel wants David to find signs of
subversion so that Diego will be imprisoned.</P>
<P>     Lastly, there is Diego's neighbor, Nancy (Mirta Ibarra), who is
busy finding a man for herself.</P>
<P>     One of the funniest scenes is after David loses his virginity to
Nancy, he has a perpetual grin.  He tells Diego, "There is nothing like
doing it with a woman."  Diego's response cracked me up!</P>
<P>     The film, a beauty, is a collaboration between the Cuban Institute
of Art and Film Industry, the Mexican National Film Office, Tabasco
Films, Telemadrid and S.G.A.E. and was filmed in Cuba, Mexico and
Spain.  Maybe this is an indication that the Cuban government is
becoming more tolerant of homosexuals.</P>
<P>Directed by Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio.</P>
<P>The film has won awards at the Berlin Film Festival and the
Latin American Film Festival in Havana.</P>
