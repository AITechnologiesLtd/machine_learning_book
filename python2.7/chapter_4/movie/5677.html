<PRE>GRADE: A </PRE>
<P>In the very first shot of Trainspotting, a good-looking Scot with
close-cropped hair and his gawkier sidekick are running like hell through
the streets of Edinburgh, a pair of security guards in close pursuit and
Iggy Pop's percussive "Lust For Life" pumping on the soundtrack. The
imagery and sound are absolutely perfect, characterizing the film's
headlong, nihilistic style in its very first moments of action. In
voiceover, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is taking a sidelong gander at his
options for clean living. "Choose life," he drawls almost playfully in a
thick Scottish brogue.  "Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family.
Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact
disc players, and electrical tin openers." </P>
<P>He's mocking the bourgeois lifestyle, of course, concluding, "Choose life
.... Why would I want to do a thing like that?" Casting aspersions on
notions of a normal life, Trainspotting is a deliciously entertaining and
only vaguely depressing show that presses thumb to nose throughout its 93
minutes. The film is eager to shock and sicken, but it takes such a keen
interest in character -- and its performances are so surefooted -- that
even as it dives headlong into the murky toilet water of the Scottish drug
culture, Trainspotting emerges triumphant, a cockeyed grin plastered
across its face. </P>
<P>In Irvine Welsh's celebrated novel, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter
John Hodge find the humanity that eluded their previous effort, Shallow
Grave.  It was hard to really care about the characters in that film, a
trio of greedheaded flatmates who destroy themselves for the love of
money. It may have seemed an even more formidable task to penetrate the
unlovable patina of heroin-addled youth, but Hodge's smart, compact
screenplay, coupled with winning performances by McGregor, Ewan Bremner
(Spud, Renton's cohort in the opening scene), Jonny Lee Miller (the
weirdly charming Sick Boy), and Robert Carlyle (Begbie, who's sort of
Scotland's answer to a Joe Pesci character), makes for a downright
charming picture. </P>
<P>Renton is the smartest of these unapologetic junkies, and the film's
subjective center. We watch through his eyes as he and his mates tie off
and shoot up, and we process thoughts along with him as he ruminates on
the meanings of life and death, the severity of his cravings, and the
place of his fellow Scotsmen in the world. "I hate being Scottish," he
rants in a rare moment of social consciousness. "I don't hate the
English-they're just wankers. We, on the other hand, are colonized by
wankers." McGregor's delivery is easily hilarious, but the true feelings
that it suggests boil well under the surface of this film, as does much
situational unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Trainspotting's stylish gloss is hardly realistic, and its portrayal of
addiction is nearly as glamorous as the film's detractors may have you
believe-but it's not a glamour without consequences. We see the deaths
that are brought on by all this nihilistic cavorting, and the film's
centerpiece is a nightmarish, surreal drama of overdosing and kicking the
habit, set to the longing strains of Lou Reed's glam-era "Perfect Day" and
some truly disturbing imagery that could have been nicked from Jan
Svankmajer. (The overdose itself actually reminds me of the funeral
procession from Carl-Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr.)</P>
<P>What really gives Trainspotting credibility is its close relationship with
the body. Needle tracks, accidental and deliberate bloodshed, casual sex
with schoolgirls, and explosive diarrhea are all part of the tableau.
Understanding that you can't make a movie about the pleasures and pains of
drug addiction without seeking intimacy with the body that feels the rush,
Boyle's camera gets close to McGregor's starmaking performance, going so
far as to set one flatulent scene in "the worst toilet in Scotland." </P>
<P>You may well be wondering how I can use words like hilarious and charming
to describe such a picture. The simple answer is that Trainspotting is
brilliant and audacious filmmaking. Trainspotting helps you understand the
lure of the heroin culture by introducing a gang of addicts who are
affable and charming and addicted to a rush that's described as superior
to a thousand grade-A orgasms. These kids seem to be victims of
circumstance and class struggle as much as anything (again, such concerns
are left to flow well below surface level), and there's a simple vicarious
thrill to be had by the audience in sharing their outlaw lifestyle. I
wouldn't want to be Mark Renton, but I surely wish him well. </P>
<P>Even so, there are audiences who will find this all to be a little much,
and who might characterize the humor or its attending sentiments as
"sick." They would do well to stay away. Others may well be put off by the
lack of any strong female characters -- the most prominent is Diane (Kelly
MacDonald), playing jailbait, and she's in the film for about five
minutes. (Somebody obviously identified the "boys club"  angle as a
marketing waterloo, since ads feature MacDonald prominently even though
she's a decidely minor character whose best scenes were cut before
release.) Again, it's good to know what you're getting into before you buy
your ticket.  Trainspotting is a vein-tapping, shite-slinging, loo-diving
virtuoso piece -- and it's best recommended to folks who aren't timid
about that sort of thing. They'll be rewarded. </P>
