<PRE>SEXY BEAST
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Ah, it's the good life.  Retired from the daily grind of making a living as a
British gangster, Gary "Gal" Dove (Ray Winstone), accompanied by his wife DeeDee
(Amanda Redman), lives in a remote Spanish villa.  With their fellow British
friends, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White), they are retired and
comfortable.</P>
<P>One day, into this life of contentment comes an unwelcome reminder of Gal's
past, a scary hood whose mere name, Don Logan, causes everyone to freeze.  With
a bald head, big ears and a menacing goatee, Ben Kingsley, in another of his
bravado performances, plays Don.  Like Gandhi's evil twin, Don uses silence and
laser-like glares to frighten the wits out of anyone who dares to cross his
path.  </P>
<P>SEXY BEAST, directed by Jonathan Glazer and written by Louis Mellis and  David
Scinto, has the intensity and the staccato dialog of a David Mamet film.  Don is
there to make Gal an offer that he can't refuse, literally.  Don needs Gal's
help on one more job.  Gal makes up his mind to turn down the offer, but he
explains to DeeDee that Don is not someone who allows disagreements.  Although
normally possessing a demeanor that's roughly the equivalent to the calm of the
eye in the center of a hurricane, Don can be riled.  In his most explosive
scene, Kingsley starts shouting, "No, no, no, ..."  with machine gun cadence and
force.</P>
<P>The melancholy music suggests that all is not going to go well.  And Gal's close
escape from a freak, killer boulder is an unmistakable omen.  The story's real
questions are how Don will convince Gal to do his bidding and who might end up
dead in the process.  Although there are a few nice twists along the way, this
is a crime drama that uses the force of the characters, not cheap plot tricks,
to maintain the tension.  Only those who require non-stop action will leave
disappointed.</P>
<P>SEXY BEAST runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for pervasive language, strong
violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, is it currently showing at the Camera Cinemas and the Century
theaters.</P>
