<PRE>                                    KOLYA
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This is the Czech entry for the Academy's best Foreign Film.  I have
never yet seen a Foreign Film entry that I did not like, and KOLYA is
no exception.   True there are periods when the action does not seem to
be moving fast enough but those are mostly at the film's beginning.
The film picks up greatly, however, with the appearance of 5-year-old
Kolya (the 6-year-old Andrej Chalimon who was discovered in a
kindergarten.)</P>
<P>Every moment in which Kolya appears is delightful and once he enters
the story he dominates the film.  He is a very handsome child, who with
a little luck will be asked to act in many films in his future.  He
seems born to act; his face, his movements, are all professional yet
childlike.  One wants to hug him.</P>
<P>The story is of Fratizek Louka (Zdenek Sverak, who also wrote the
screenplay), a cellist in the Czech Philharmonic but, with Russia's
army in Czechoslovakia, he cannot earn enough to live on and so he
supplements his income by playing in a chamber group at funerals.</P>
<P>A friendly grave-digger suggests that Fratizek marry his niece; not a
real marriage but signing a slip of paper.  In exchange he will be paid
sufficient money to buy a small car, pay his rent.  Fratizek wants to
remain in every way a bachelor but when he sees the pretty niece, he
relents.</P>
<P>Things now happen quickly.    His "bride" runs off to Germany with her
lover but leaves her 5-year-old son Kolya with his "father",
Fratizek.    In no time at all, as we can easily surmise, Fratizek and
Kolya love each other as if they were, in fact, father and son.</P>
<PRE>A delightful film.</PRE>
<PRE>In Czech with English subtitles.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Jan Sverak.</PRE>
