<P>Who would have thought the final apocalyptic battle between
the forces of good and evil for the future of the world would take
place in New Jersey, of all places?  Possibly only Kevin Smith
(Clerks, Chasing Amy, etc), the idiosyncratic writer/director who sets
all his off beat, low budget comedies in his beloved New Jersey.</P>
<P>In the past, Smith's films have offended many with their
misogynistic humour, their cynical take on relationships, and their
decidedly anti-authoritarian stance.  While Smith is obviously working
with a bigger budget here, Dogma is little different in style or
content from his earlier films.  However, Dogma is a far more
ambitious film, and finds Smith exploring more sophisticated themes
and ideas.  Smith deconstructs 2000 years of biblical mythology and
Catholic dogma, as well as tackling issues of mortality, faith, and
belief versus organised religion.  Among the more contentious ideas
offered up in Dogma are a female God (played with a curiously
childlike grace by rock singer Alanis Morisette), a black Jesus, and a
thirteenth, black apostle left out of the Bible for reasons of
political correctness.</P>
<P>In Dogma, hot young stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck continue
the familiar best buddy schtick they have perfected through films like
Good Will Hunting, etc.  The pair play Loki and Bartleby, two vengeful
angels thrown out of heaven but anxious to return to the good graces
after centuries in exile.  They have now found a liturgical loophole
that will enable them to re-enter heaven.  However, if that happens,
it will somehow prove the fallibility of God and thus destroy
existence as we know it.</P>
<P>Tapped to prevent this cataclysmic event is Bethany (Linda
Fiorentino, from The Last Seduction, etc), a lapsed Catholic who runs
an abortion clinic in Pittsburgh.  Also along to help out is hyper
active, fast talking comic Chris Rock (Lethal Weapon 4, etc), who gets
some of the film's best lines as the very annoyed and ignored 13th
apostle Rufus.  The hapless duo of Silent Bob (played by Smith
himself) and Jay (Jason Mewes) have played gradually expanding roles
in each of Smith's films, and here the pair are given a major role to
play as they are mistaken for a couple of prophets mysteriously sent
to assist Bethany in her mission.</P>
<P>Dogma is very funny stuff, with plenty of great one liners,
Smith's irreverent, iconoclastic sense of humour, and the usual pop
culture references.  But Smith's penchant for clever writing often
leads to great long patches of dialogue and unnecessary
philosophising, that slow the film down to a crawl.  His fondness for
puerile scatological humour also surfaces, and while this base humour
may appeal to some in the audience it will not sit as comfortably with
others.</P>
<P>Fans of Smith's warped comic sensibility will find plenty to
enjoy in Dogma, while those who have never really appreciated him or
his films will find little here to redeem him in their eyes.</P>
