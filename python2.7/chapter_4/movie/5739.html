<PRE>                                CASABLANCA
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>****</PRE>
<P>        Unarguably one of the very best films in Hollywood 
history, CASABLANCA is set in French Morocco just before the 
start of World War II. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the nightclub 
owner who has refused thus far to take sides with the French 
resistance or the newly-appointed Nazi officials. He's his usual 
cool, collected self until a ghost from his past walks in on the arm 
of the most wanted man in the resistance. The woman is Ilsa (Ingrid 
Bergman), his lost love from Paris who never made it onto the train 
with him.</P>
<P>        Since then he's managed to suppress the emotional scars 
of jilted love, but finds himself drinking alone that night, pondering 
the reason why, "of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world,</P>
<P>she had to walk into mine." No one tells him that if she hadn't there 
wouldn't have been a movie, but the Paris past of Rick and Ilsa and 
her reasons for staying behind are what drive the movie, along with 
the exit visas Rick has in his possession that are the only chance 
of Ilsa's man, the resistance leader, to get out of Casablanca 
safely.</P>
<P>        Repeated viewings add a lot of poignance to the early 
scenes, not just in putting the intricate, slowly-unfolding plot in 
big picture perspective, but in fully appreciating the reunion of 
Rick and Ilsa in his nightclub and understanding why Rick comes 
storming out to stop Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) from 
playing "As Time Goes By" after Ilsa requests it. The song, for 
anyone who's seen CASABLANCA, is symbolic of so much of 
the movie's meaning that it will be forever identified with 
CASABLANCA, even though it pops up in a great many other 
romances, including SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.</P>
<P>        In the end it comes down to the age-old love triangle 
scenario. Bergman is still in love with Bogart but feels obligated 
to support her husband, while Bogart is in the situation of being 
in control of the destiny of the man who is married to the woman 
he loves. The ending is one of the most famous and memorable 
in movie history, and just about any line of dialogue is quotable. 
CASABLANCA is a wonderful, must-watch film from the Golden 
Age of Hollywood, one of the few movies that has actually 
improved with age and demands repeat viewings.</P>
