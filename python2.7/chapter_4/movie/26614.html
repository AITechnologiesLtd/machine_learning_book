<PRE>BEST IN SHOW     * * * </PRE>
<P>Director: Christopher Guest
Writers: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy
Cast: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, 
Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard
Rated PG-13, 89 minutes</P>
<P>Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) is preparing his bloodhound to sniff out 
the faults in his fellow canine competitors. Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene 
Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are getting their terrier ready for battle. Sheri 
Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired trainer hope their poodle 
will win a third consecutive blue ribbon. Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) 
and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) are a gay couple who pamper their 
animal, and hope for victory. Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael 
Hitchcock) have high hopes for success with their dog. What's gotten all of 
these people and others all worked up? The Mayflower Dog Show of course! It's 
the world's most fabulous event for pooches and their owners alike. The tough 
rivalry and judges send some of the humans into states of insanity, while 
others feel less pressure. Calling this group of people quirky is an 
understatement. Using nearly the exact same cast from Guest's previous 
picture, "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show" tries for a similar triumph, 
but this judge says the picture is stale.</P>
<P>After "Guffman," plus previously co-writing and co-starring in "This Is 
Spinal Tap," there are few roads Guest can take for further creative 
achievement, especially in the mockumentary genre. Rather than experiment 
with something new, the director and co-writer decided to repeat himself. 
That was a mistake because this production almost negatively affects his past 
work. If someone sees this, and then goes to rent "Guff," the disappointment 
continues. Since it feels like the people of Blaine, Missouri agreed to 
appear in another film, it's rather a situation of which movie you see first. 
Either of them works wonderfully for the first spot, but watch the other sour 
in second. </P>
<P>This isn't to say there's a lack of material, or that nothing is funny. 
Jennifer Coolidge is marvelous as an Anna Nicole Smith-like woman with a 
hidden sexual preference and an eccentric taste in clothing. She must have 
spent millions on a long necklace that outlines her large breasts in gleaming 
diamond fashion. While no Corky St. Clair, Guest's performance as Harlan 
Pepper is quite good. The problem is that both of these persons get little 
screen time. The most time goes to the surprisingly lackluster Eugene Levy. 
The running gag is that his wife has slept with every man they encounter on 
their drive to the show. It works, yet he's overused. I finally understand 
why people find Parker Posey annoying. Her way over-the-top bit here as a 
control freak catalog and Starbucks lover was just plain irritating. At least 
Fred Willard never lets up the enthusiasm as a dog show commentator who asks 
irksome questions to his posh British colleague. Willard's comments and ideas 
to improve the show are the high point here. The gay couple has little flair, 
and they misfire horribly. There needs to be one sane person here to balance 
it out. </P>
<P>The animal and its owner(s?) that do win the title prize weren't my first or 
second choice, yet there's little mystery or tension as to who the winner(s?) 
is(are?) early on. </P>
<P>While far superior, "Best in Show" shares a remarkably similar problem with 
"Scary Movie." The actors act like they know they're in a satire. That never 
works! You can see the snickering in their faces. Only when a person doesn't 
believe they're being watched can they fully be themselves, and, therefore, 
provide prime comedy. "Scary" was awfully cruel with the beings onscreen, 
something "Show," thankfully, does not do. </P>
<P>At 89 minutes, this movie is entirely too long. The film tends to repeat 
itself, and the pet pampering gets annoying. There's no apparent reason 
behind all of this love and affection, besides some faux human nature. The 
dogs get treated like little children. And how do the dogs turn out? They 
emerge unscathed from this semi-humorous film that touches, but never delves 
into the many chances for humor that it covers. The real competitions are 
much more fun to watch. This doesn't reach the potential possible of canine 
mockery. Guest should go back to the drawing boards, or maybe back to Blaine. </P>
