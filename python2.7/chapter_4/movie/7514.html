<PRE>                                 FATHERS' DAY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What are the odds that the two would-be fathers of one woman's son
would be two of the biggest comedians of the screen today!?  Well,
they're pretty good if you see FATHERS' DAY, yet another Ivan Reitman
(BEETHOVEN, TWINS, KINDERGARTEN COP, et. al.) film that is so
disgustingly sweet you'll want to spit out your jujubes.  Billy Crystal
and Robin Williams play the titular fathers, out to rescue the missing
son they never knew they had.  (Plot Simplified: Nastassja Kinski was a
stonkingly huge slut and doesn't know who daddy is.)</P>
<P>     For all its saccharine heavy-handedness, FATHERS' DAY does manage
to come across as one of Reitman's better efforts in recent years, but
the by-the-Hollywood-book formula, structure, and pacing really bog down
the production.  There's plenty of missed comic opportunities, but
plenty that hit dead-on -- especially a notable, heavily-pierced cameo
(watch for it!).  And yes, the estranged son looks exactly like me.  A
1/4 star bonus for that.</P>
<P>     And yes, I'm sick of *writing* mediocre reviews, too.</P>
