<P>            -----------------------------------------------------</P>
<PRE>    Ahhh! Where to begin...  I know! </PRE>
<P>     Never have I seen so much Day-Glo colors, iridescent neon lights
and campy behaviour in my life! That aside this was the most
anticipated and over-hyped summer movie in recent memory.  And while
much has been made of the new cast, director, Robin, batsuits, nipples,
etc. my main concern was would I be able to hold down my lunch while
watching this extravaganza? In a word ...  YES!</P>
<P>     Joel Schumacher, director of such diverse films as THE LOST BOYS,
FALLING DOWN, DYING YOUNG and last year's CLIENT, manages not only to
create a world totally different in feel and style from his
predecessor, Tim Burton, but he brings a sense of fun and silliness not
usually associated with The Dark Knight You can't help but smile at the
humor, the costumes and yes, even the horrid makeup which were able to
transform even actor Tommy Lee Jones to a level of excess not before
seen on the screen.</P>
<P>     Confession time: I have never been a fan of comics, whether it was
Batman, Superman ... what have you.  The genre certainly has its loyal
fans and in deference to them I will say that I can sympathize with
their outrage for the departure from Tim Burton's vision of the Bat of
old.  Frankly I always found it too dark and ominous to be enjoyable.
So?  What did I think of its latest incarnation?  Here goes:</P>
<P>     I had a blast!! The cast blended well together.  They seemed like a
bunch of kids let loose on a playground at recess who had been told
that school was out for the day.  Just give a bunch of talented people
enough money to make some dreams come true, lots of crazy outfits and
makeup galore and put it in the hands of someone like Schumacher and
watch what happens!</P>
<P>     As for the cast: Val Kilmer, the new Batman! While yes I did like
Michael Keaton, Kilmer is a refreshing change.  He's just as sexy,
certainly good-looking and those buns!! Warner couldn't resist filling
the screen with them for a not-so-brief view in his new Batsuit. :)
Can't say I blame them!</P>
<P>     I do have one gripe with WB.  Well ... considerably more than just
one but this is neither the time nor the forum for that.  WB did all
they could to keep the production closely under wraps for fear of too
much information getting out and possibly ruining the suspense and
anticipation, not to mention its vast merchandizing schemes in
connection with the movie.  Well maybe they ought to have re-examined
the trailers and movie clips they release since they nearly covered the
entire film with them and left little to be discovered by sitting in
the movie theater.</P>
<P>     But what they did leave out was just as exciting and dazzling as
the rest and more than kept my group of fellow movie-goers
entertained.  Jim Carrey's Riddler was sure to be as Over-The-Top as he
could make it but it was fabulous to watch.  As was Tommy Lee Jones'
Two-Face.  I'd heard much of their supposed competition for Top Dog (no
Red Dog pun intended) but I really saw none of it on the screen.  Each
found a way to bring pure hokum to their roles.</P>
<P>     I'd always been against comic book adaptations to the big screen
because I'd thought the cross-over did not work.  Certainly I'd never
seen anything worthy of the effort ... until now.  BF is as good as it
gets.  You find yourself anxiously wanting to turn the page to see what
comes next.  I know I did whenever Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian)
was alone with Batman/Bruce.  I'm all for romance but I found myself
giggling along with the rest of the audience the three times they
kissed.</P>
<P>     Overall impressions: Kilmer's got the job for as long as he wants
it.  Chris O'Donnell's Robin is here to stay too.  The rumors abound
about the sure-to-follow sequel.  Will Carrey's Riddler escape from
Arkham Asylum? Yeah, I'd say so... and unless he demands $50 million I
can't see Warner refusing him anything.  Does Two-Face survive? Given
his final shot, outstretched hand catching his favorite dual-sided
good/evil coin as he sinks beneath the water, head (good) side up --
yeah, I think we'll see TLJ come back again.  Schumacher?? Are you
kidding? The man has created a blockbuster by seeking inspiration from
such films as Tron and Raiders of the Lost Ark, among other films,
finished the movie ahead of schedule and under the budget!! Of course
he'll be back!</P>
<P>     The story?  Well, no one ever said that revenge wasn't a good story
now did they? Duality is omnipresent as well.  Everyone has two sides to
them and each is explored throughout the film.  The music is fine
although I found myself thinking of John Williams from time to time and
I couldn't help shaking the feeling that the main theme sounded a heck
of a lot like "Begin the Beguine."  The sets are spectacular and large!
The largest I've seen in quite a while.  You'd think the actors would
get lost in such a setting but Schumacher brings them out and makes
Entertainment the catch-phrase for the viewers.  You leave the theater
feeling that you not only got your money's worth but that you'll gladly
go into debt to see this one several times.</P>
<P>     Well ... this hasn't been a typical review by any means but then
again this was no ordinary movie.  To have seen the highly controversial
Batsuits with their nipples and the brand-spanking new Batmobile,
Batwing which conveniently transforms into a new Batsub, Batboat and
assorted new gadgets, even E. Nygma's RES Box which is nothing more
than a souped-up blender, I must say that it was all great fun.</P>
<P>     Jim Carrey continues to prove that he does indeed have a lot of
talent and under the careful guidance and I presume restraint of
Schumacher, brought to life The Riddler with all of his insanity,
god-complexes and all.  Tommy Lee Jones' turn as former DA Harvey Dent
was loud, gravel-voiced and as campy as his makeup but it worked.  It
played perfectly opposite Carrey's antics and bag of tricks.  Filling
out the rest of the screen and essentially acting as window dressing
were Two-Face's girlfriends, Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar as Sugar and
Spice, yin and yang to Harvey's dual personalities.  Michael Gough, the
only hold-over from the Tim Burton days, was as irresistible as ever
as Alfred.</P>
<P>     Not much left to be said except that I plan on seeing this one
again for sure! Recommendation: Not to be missed on the big screen by
anyone who loves action, Batman, romance, and just plain good ol' fun.</P>
