                             LETHAL WEAPON II
                                [Spoilers]
                         A film review by Jeff Meyer
                          Copyright 1989 Jeff Meyer</PRE>
<P>     Okay, Cinema Philosophy Time:  Can a film with an abysmal script,
unremarkable photography, reams of shoot-outs and chase scenes, wind-up
villains, outrageous plot blunders, gratuitous advertising (how many Subway
Shops can *you* spot in this picture?) and a totally predictable climax be
saved by a good rapport between the two main characters, and a basis for said
relationship that overshadows the pedestrian film?</P>
<PRE>     Well, no.</PRE>
<P>     I mean, I like watching Gibson and Glover when they get together.  I
particularly like the concept for their relationship: Gibson plays a cop who is
right on -- I mean *right* on -- the edge; he's a finely-honed, somewhat
demented (at least in risk-taking) fighter.  However, he would have burned
himself out (or killed himself) long ago, if it weren't for his friends, i.e.
his partner (Danny Glover) and his partner's family, who've adopted him and
given him that lifeline that anchors him to reality.  Their affection for him,
and his for them, works.  Unfortunately, that constitutes about 15% of the
movie.  The rest of it has to be one of the lamest excuses for an action film
since FATAL BEAUTY.</P>
<P>     Oh, Lord, where to start?  The villains are drug-dealers, sadists *and*
racist South African officials.  (I'll bet the head honcho was originally
Joseph Goebbels, Jr., but they decided to cut that bit out to save running time
for the action sequences.)  What these people are able to get away with under
the aegis of Diplomatic Immunity is unbelievable.  (Even under the Bush
administration.  Hell, even under the Quayle administration.)  Characters are
introduced and then killed left and right to get G & G (and the audience) into
the "Waste Their Ass" mood -- it's pretty transparent.  And if that wasn't
enough, the main henchman comes out of the blue to say that he killed Gibson's
character's wife before LETHAL WEAPON!  Gee, why not have him responsible for
shooting down Korean Airlines Flight 007, or spitting on Jesus -- *really* give
Mel that excuse to Waste His Ass!</P>
<P>     Good points, besides the chemistry between The Guys?  Neat nail gun.
(Craftsman?)  The girl looks like Susan Dey with her own Wolfe tanning system.
And there are a few good lines.  Not enough to sustain the movie, though.</P>
<P>     My suggestion: see THE ABYSS.  It isn't a masterpiece, but I can still
remember what happened in it.  LETHAL WEAPON II has sort of faded from my
memory -- no doubt some sort of natural protection mechanism.</P>
