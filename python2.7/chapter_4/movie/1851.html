<P>     Huck Finn (Elijah Wood) is a young lad with a penchant for getting
into mischief.  He spends the bulk of his days playing truant from
school, getting into fights, and lying to his two female guardians
about how he got black eyes.  One day, Huck's drunken, good-for-nothing
father (Ron Perlman) arrives and takes his son away with him, looking
for a way to get his hands on $600 left to Huck by his late mother.
Huck escapes from his father's clutches, and, in the company of a
runaway slave by the name of Jim (Cortney B. Vance), sets off on a
journey by boat down the Mississippi with the eventual goal of getting
Jim's freedom.  Along the way, the pair meets a number of interesting
people and become involved in several adventures.</P>
<P>     Whenever a book is adapted into a movie, there are sacrifices and
interpretations that must be made because the totality of the written
work cannot possibly be translated to the screen.  The choices become
even more difficult when the work is one as widely-read and
well-beloved as Mark Twain's THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN.  In
the case of this latest filmed version, Stephen Sommers' script is
faithful in spirit--if not in all the details--to the original.  Much
of Twain's keen insight into human nature, as well as his finely-tuned
sense-of-humor, is kept intact in Disney's 1993 THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK
FINN.  It should be noted, however, that significant chunks of the
novel are missing--including the bulk of the ending--and the character
of Tom Sawyer doesn't make an appearance.  While it's easy to debate
the merits of what was cut, the final result manages to convey a good
sense of some of the book's scope</P>
<P>     Family films are something of a scarcity, and those that fit into
the category of "good entertainment" even less common.  THE ADVENTURES
OF HUCK FINN is one such rare movie.  Very young children may be a
little frightened by some of the violence in the film but, overall,
it's an excellent choice for a family's night out.  As is true of the
book, there are many levels on which the story can be enjoyed.
Children will like the adventure, but there's plenty to keep adults
engrossed as well.  Much of the wit will certainly go over the heads of
younger viewers, as will the clever characterizations of several of the
people who cross Huck's path.</P>
<P>     Young Elijah Wood shows enough aptitude to carry this film.  Once
he puts on the suspenders and the attitude, he is decidedly convincing.
With good supporting performances by Jason Robards as The King and
Robbie Coltrane as The Duke, the acting in THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN
is without problems.</P>
<P>     One of the things that impressed me the most about this movie is
the realism of the river scenes.  Of necessity, less of the movie takes
place on the Mississippi than in the book, but the river remains an
important part of the plot and the cinematography is notable.  It's
genuinely awe-inspiring, and a little frightening, to see a giant
steamboat bearing down on a little raft, and the scenes on the sinking
boat are handled expertly.</P>
<P>     Disney has a reputation for watering down subjects that may cause
controversy.  HUCK FINN is a story with a single major issue--that of
slavery--at its core.  Unlike the book, the movie never uses the word
"nigger" (it's an omission that's not particularly noticeable and
certainly less offensive), but that's about the only thing that's
obviously sanitized.  The evils of slavery are shown--rather
graphically, at times--and it would be wrong to assume that THE
ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN doesn't have a social agenda.  Also displayed
with frankness is the brutality of Huck's father.  Other versions have
toned this down, but Sommers' script is, in this instance, completely
faithful to the book.</P>
<P>     Some will doubtless argue that this latest updating of the story
of Huckleberry Finn didn't need to be made.  Regardless, the 1993
version of HUCK FINN is an entertaining and worthwhile movie experience
with a solid story to please just about everyone in the family.  It's
not a milestone motion picture, nor can it be considered the definitive
adaptation of Twain's work, but, on the whole, it deserves some
recognition and credit.</P>
