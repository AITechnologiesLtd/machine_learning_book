<P>         Last year, director Andy Tennant transformed the tale of
Cinderella into "Ever After," one of 1998's most endearing sleeper hits.
For his follow-up, he's tackled the culture clash between British
governess Anna Leonowens and King Mongkut of Siam, the same material
that's previously been dramatized in the 1946 film "Anna and the King of
Siam" and musicalized as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The King and I."</P>
<P> Was another telling of this story absolutely necessary? Perhaps
not, although "Anna and the King," like "Ever After," puts forth some
intriguing new ideas about its characters while providing a banquet for
the eyes and ears. This is precisely the kind of "cast of thousands"
extravaganza Hollywood rarely produces anymore and the movie's seductive
visuals, charismatic performances and glorious scenery make for two and
a half hours of immensely pleasurable viewing.</P>
<P> For those who grew up with the 1955 Yul Brynner/Deborah Kerr
version of "The King and I," "Anna" comes across as slightly
disorienting at first. It feels slightly strange not to hear "Getting to
Know You" when Anna is introduced to her scores of Siamese pupils and
though the screenplay retains the famous scene in which Anna is
literally swept off her feet by the king at a ball, "Shall We Dance" is
conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Accept Tennant's film on its
own terms, however, and you'll be rewarded.</P>
<P> Thematically, the biggest difference between the screenplays of
the two movies is found in their approach to the king.</P>
<P> In "The King and I," Mongkut is portrayed as a steely but
slightly goofy monarch whose fascination with science and English
customs is often played for laughs. Anna, on the other hand, is the
walking embodiment of all the glorious traits Britain once attached to
its policies of Colonialism: She's single-minded but proper to a fault
and knowledgeable but not overbearing. She handles Mongkut with the same
firm hand and gentle manner a well-bred mother in 1862 might have used
to control a temperamental child.</P>
<P> There's never any doubt in "The King and I" that Western ways
are superior to the mysticism and superstition that rule the East, and
those attitudes have led some contemporary critics to label the musical
as an example of benign racism.</P>
<P> "Anna and the King" offers a more balanced picture of the two
worlds. As portrayed by Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat, Mongkut is
exceedingly intelligent and powerfully sexy, a man who's not about to
let an outsider rearrange his traditions. Jodie Foster's Anna is a
strong-willed widow with backbone and determination, who announces upon
her arrival in the Orient that "the ways of England are the ways of the
world," but slowly begins to find value in certain aspects of the
Siamese approach to life.</P>
<P> "Anna and the King" is drawn from the diaries Leonowens kept
during the six years she spent in the palace and the later part of the
story diverges markedly from "The King and I," as Mongkut and his family
fend off a plot to seize the throne and venture into the jungle to
escape a rebel army. Whether this is ultimately more accurate than
Rodgers and Hammerstein's version of the story is hard to say since
historians continue to argue over how much of Leonowens' writing was a
romanticized embellishment of life in the royal court.</P>
<P> Regardless, it makes for exciting viewing, with cinematographer
Caleb Deschanel providing some of the richest on-location photography
since David Lean's "A Passage to India" and Sydney Pollack's "Out of
Africa." Unlike "Africa" author Isak Dinesen, the Victorian Leonowens
was not bold enough to reinvent her love life in the name of a good
story so the romance between Anna and Mongkut remains strictly platonic
-- even though the heat between Foster and Chow is all but palpable.
