<P>Imagine a reverse spin on "The Exorcist," all trussed up with MTV-style 
graphics, and you'll have a fair idea of what to expect from "Stigmata," 
an overwrought horror story burdened by sluggish pacing, a lame 
screenplay with a distinct lack of internal logic and an insufferable 
soundtrack. Despite its laundry list of flaws, I still got caught up in 
the story, which appeared to be building towards a climax that would make 
some profound statement, only to watch the film deflate like a cheap air 
mattress with a faulty stem. For all its posturing, "Stigmata" is much 
bloody ado about nothing.</P>
<P>It begins in a tiny village, where Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) 
investigates reports of a religious statue that bleeds profusely. Father 
Kiernan, who travels the world serving as a sort-of miracle cop for the 
Vatican, remains remarkably subdued even when the statue weeps bloody 
tears. When the phenomena reoccurs, accompanied by birds flying through 
the church and great bursts of wind blowing out the chapel candles, which 
spontaneously re-ignite around 30 seconds later, the padre is suitably 
impressed and reports his findings to the big boys in Rome. His boss, the 
creepy Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), merely glowers and instructs 
him to pack up the statue and have it sent to the church labs for study. </P>
<P>Cut to Pittsburgh, where hairdresser Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) 
has her own set of troubles. After her mother sends her a rosary stolen 
from the body of the priest from the aforementioned church, Frankie 
experiences bizarre attacks where she spontaneously bleeds from her hands,
 head or feet. Not only are the occurrences terrifying and painful, but 
the red clashes with her trendy outfits. Doctors can't determine why this 
is happening, frustrating the hip young atheist even more. To make 
matters worse, Frankie's boyfriend Steven (Patrick Muldoon) begins to 
distance himself from her and even her girlfriends Donna (Nia Long) and 
Jennifer (Portia de Rossi) start looking at her as if she was Linda Blair.</P>
<P>Enter Father Kiernan, who explains the situation to Frankie. Stigmata is 
the appearance of wounds on a body in the five exact places where the 
crucified Christ was pierced. Those who experience stigmata are deeply 
religious people, like Saint Francis of Assisi, who lost a pint a day, 
according to the Father. He fears for Frankie, because no one except her 
has ever displayed more than two of the wounds at the same time. If she 
simultaneously shows all five, the result may be death. </P>
<P>A number of questions arise at this point. Even with magic rosary beads, 
why is an atheist experiencing a phenomena that affects only the 
extremely faithful? Why do those who witness this full-fledged miracle 
react solely with horror instead of wonder? Where are the cops and the 
media when Frankie runs into the street and causes a series of car wrecks?
 Why are her attacks scored with annoying music from Smashing Pumpkins 
leader Billy Corgan? How does a hairdresser afford the largest apartment 
in Pittsburgh? And what the hell is an actor of Gabriel Byrne's caliber 
doing in a cheesy movie like this?</P>
<P>The prime subplot of "Stigmata" is far more interesting than all the 
"Exorcist" histrionics, but it turns out to be both anticlimactic and 
illogical. (SPOILER ALERT: the following reveals significant plot points) 
Cardinal Houseman and his cohorts strive to stifle Father Kiernan's 
investigation. It seems that there exists another gospel, written by 
Christ himself. Certain Catholics, including the late priest from the 
little church, were close to revealing the writings and the Vatican 
baddies fear that Christ's message would destroy their lucrative 
organization. </P>
<P>While intriguing, the subplot has two big problems. First, an elderly 
priest (Rade Serbedgia) who specializes in translations repeatedly states 
that the first-hand gospel has been lost forever, even though he holds 
sharp photographs of the scriptures in his hand. Second, when we finally 
hear the legendary message, it turns out to be a benign truism that most 
of us learned on the first day of Bible school. Is this simple message a 
threat to the very existence of the Catholic Church? I don't think so 
(END SPOILERS).</P>
<P>So we are left with a lurid horror show, edited in quick-cut MTV style 
and surrounded by quasi-alternative music. One of the reasons "The Sixth 
Sense" worked is because the filmmakers understood that the extraordinary 
is most effectively presented in a low-key fashion. "Stigmata" takes 
miracles and turns them into grandiose music videos, and while a few 
moments are genuinely disturbing, the bulk of the film plays like a big, 
dumb trip through an ecclesiastical spook house. </P>
