<P>YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Gramercy / 1:40 / 1998 / R (sex, language, abrasive dialogue)
Cast: Jason Patric; Ben Stiller; Amy Brenneman; Catherine Keener; Aaron 
Eckhart; Nastassja Kinski 
Director: Neil LaBute 
Screenplay: Neil LaBute<HR>Regarding the unsavory main individuals that give Neil LaBute's "Your 
Friends & Neighbors" its ironic title: They won't be there for you, and 
even Mister Rogers wouldn't offer up a howdy if he saw them coming his 
way. In fact, he'd probably hop on the Neighborhood Trolley and stay 
far, far away, which is very likely what moviegoers will do once word 
spreads that LaBute's sophomore effort possesses few of the disturbingly 
provocative hooks that turned his 1997 debut "In the Company of Men" 
into a hot-button classic. While there's a lot to get worked up over in 
"Your Friends & Neighbors," it's really just not worth the effort. </P>
<P>This "modern immorality tale," as the ads go, finds drama coach Jerry 
(Ben Stiller) growing sexually distant from his girlfriend Terri 
(Catherine Keener). Jerry decides to initiate an affair with Mary (Amy 
Brenneman), the wife of his best friend Barry (Company alum Aaron 
Eckhart), and when Terri finds out, she has a fling of her own with 
Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), a sexy art gallery employee who also catches 
the eye of Cary (Jason Patric), a buddy of Jerry and Barry's. The long 
100 minutes it takes for these people to out-nasty each other feels like 
group therapy with a bunch of self-centered whiners or, worse, an 
episode of "Jerry Springer" sans schlock value. </P>
<P>All of the bed-hopping, put-downs and duplicitous characters, and "Your 
Friends & Neighbors" isn't even amusing in a "Melrose Place" sort of 
way. The blame may be in the repetitious screenplay, but it's certainly 
not in the acting - this ensemble is so excruciatingly believable that 
you'd just like to give everyone a good smack. Particularly whup-worthy 
is Patric's Cary, a repugnant lothario who owns both the funniest (when 
his occupation is revealed) and the creepiest (when he tells about his 
"best lay") scenes of this so-called black comedy. Stiller and Eckhart 
are close behind as creeps with different horniness outlets, but neither 
matches Patric's vile ferocity. </P>
<P>The women's roles aren't much nicer, save for Kinski, who stays on the 
underdeveloped side of things. Keener and Brenneman are fine as 
respectively curt and "sensitive" gals, but what's missing here is a 
reason to care about all of this depraved behavior. In "In the Company 
of Men," that sympathy generated from a deaf secretary who was the 
victim in a shocking scheme hatched by to cruel co-workers. The 
antagonists' behavior in that film sucked you into an uncommonly 
discomforting story, while here it sends these five irritating folks 
through terribly misguided motions over and over and over again. Save a 
seat for me, Fred. I'm coming with you.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
