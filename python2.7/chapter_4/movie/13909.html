<PRE>"I think America is still a very confused place. What I can see now is
that its got a lot of wonderful things that I rejected before, yet
there's an inherent dumbness that floats through the whole thing."
                                           -Terry Gilliam, Sight and Sound</PRE>
<P>Adapt, the last time I checked, means to 'make suitable for a new use
or situation'. No where in the dictionary that I consulted did it say
to 'clumsily and simple mindedly try to force something into a new
situation.' And yet for some reason the majority of filmmakers seem to
use the latter definition in screen adaptations. (The English Patient,
Forrest Gump etc...) Such films fail because of a misguided approach
to adaptation which usually involves simply directly translating
original material into a photoplay. This ignores that implicit in the
very definition of the word adaptation is a transformation a complete
change to give rise to something new, not a simple translation.  Often
reactions to adaptations will discuss whether 'justice to the
original' was served. To ask a film to do this is ridiculous. Some of
my favourite adaptations have yielded something wholly other than the
original and in so doing simultaneously converges with the tone or
central concerns of that work.  Terry Gilliam's (Brazil, The
Adventures of Baron Munchausen) latest film, Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas is to be commended for carrying out this imperative despite
source material that was touted as 'unfilmable'. Although it has been
repeated a thousand times elsewhere, the perfect fit between Gilliam's
style and Hunter S. Thompson's 'novel' cannot be overstated. it is
surely because of such a perfect match that Gilliam has been able to
craft a masterwork from an original that would have stumped many
another director.</P>
<P>     The film recounts the misadventures of journalist Raoul Duke
(Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr.  Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) over the
course of a debilitating weekend in Las Vegas during which Duke is
meant to cover a motorcycle race. The two centrepieces of the
adaptation are the visual design and the tone of the film. Gilliam is
known for paying careful attention to the details of his worlds; not
just the look, but the very shape and texture of them. Director of
Photographer Nicola Pecorini does an outstanding job of rendering a
multiplicity colour to each frame. Instead of a colour scheme that
implies an overriding pattern or logic, most scenes are constructed in
exactly the opposite way.  There are red skies, shifting filter
colours and a hilarious amount of excess. The Vegas setting that
occupies much of the film has never seemed more ominous despite much
more realistic recent portrayals (Leaving Las Vegas). The chaotic
visuals are anchored to a narrative that is exemplary in its subtle
shifts in tone and point of view.  This is the key element that
elevates the film. Through careful manipulation of the duo's
interactions Gilliam is never far from reminding the viewer of the
very temporary nature of theirpleasures. (Not unlike those of the
conventional cinema) Duke's repeated returns to the type writer-
despite his condition making the task seemingly impossible- are an
example of the tonal shifts.  On the one hand it is hilarious that
what comes out is so lucid and yet the whole circumstance itslef is
haunting. Such shifts achieve their greatest effect in one of the
final scenes of the film that occurs in a diner. The ensuing events
can only be described as unsettling and serve as a clear reminder that
the film's ambition lies beyond being a quizzical cult artifact.</P>
<P>    Gilliam goes further to lend the material weight by using a very
carefully constructed soundtrack. A number of aspects of the film call
attention to this device from the very perticular articulations of the
two main characters, to the final third of the film that finds Duke
trying to reconstruct past events from a sound recording of them. The
sound effects found throughout the film are rarely only the directly
motivated sounds of on-screen events. The result is a soundtrack that
contributes to the discomfort felt throughout the film but also denies
the convenient conclusion of a single unified and coherent narrator.
The voice-over is a big part of this density that Gilliam acheves
through sound. Although nitially the voice-over is ostensibly a
conventional first person narration, through the course of the film
this gets collapsed with the 'read-over' of Duke's writing. The
bridging of this gap further undermines the protoagonist as a reliable
narrator and puts into question any notions of the two protagonists as
heroes.</P>
<P>    Some of the moments in the film that most terrified me are the
interations between the two main characters - played impeccably by
Depp and Del Toro - and the other Vegas dwellers. It is this
interations that show the chasm like gap that exists between the two
protagonists and the current conventions. This is very much the matter
of the film as opposed to it being purly 'about drugs'.  The early
scene in which bar patrons take on the semblance of giant lizards
signals any such interactions as important moments in the film: The
subsequent scenes involving Duke trying to leave his hotel without
paying or Gonzo scaring people in a neighbouring car are chilling
reminders of what side of the spectrum most of us occupy.  </P>
