<PRE>                    MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the
screening of this film about the Algonquin Round Table of the 1920s
with its extraordinary group of wit and talent.   Who could forget
Robert Benchley, Harold Ross, Alexander Woollcott, Edna Ferber, Deems
Taylor, Will Rogers, Robert Sherwood, Heywood Broun, Neysa McMein,
George S. Kaufman, Marc Connelly, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Harpo Marx, FPA,
Donald Ogden Stewart ... and the many more who made that period a
memorable one?   Among the leaders of that superb pack was Dorothy
Parker herself who was (and is) probably quoted more often than anyone
but Shakespeare.</P>
<P>     Many of the actors looked like those they were portraying which
was fun to spot.  But even those, like Benchley (Campbell Scott) who,
tall and slender, did not resemble the more rotund Benchley, gave some
of the finest performances.</P>
<P>     Where the film loses out is that Jennifer Jason Leigh, playing
Dorothy, chose to use some weird accent so that aside from sounding
like the proverbial marbles in the mouth, the witty words she spoke
were often lost.   Having read Dorothy Parker's verse, stories and
one-liners for lo these many years, I was able to recall the punch
lines but I fear that most in the audience missed many of the gems.</P>
<P>     Mrs. Parker's life should have been the most glorious because she
was a unique and talented personality.  Instead, her private life was a
mess and this the film does explore to the end.  How sad that a woman
who wrote better than most of the men of that period (all famous), as
well as drink them under the table, should have been such an unhappy,
lonely soul.</P>
<P>     Whatever makes the film worth seeing is due to the many witticisms
that flew across the table, and the rest of the cast which includes
(among many, many others), Matthew Broderick, Sam Robards, Martha
Plimpton, Stephen Baldwin, Wallace Shawn, Keith Carradine, Nick
Cassavetes and Peter Benchley.</P>
