<P>
 Antz (1998) 4 stars out of 4. Featuring voices of Woody Allen, Sharon
Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman and Chirstopher Walken.</P>
<P> Antz is a witty, entertaining story about conformity vs. individuality,
the worth of the individual vs. the welfare of the whole and, of course,
true love.</P>
<P> Oh, it's also about ants. And after seeing this computer-animated feature,
you'll hesitate before trying to crush another one again.</P>
<P> Featuring an all-star cast of vocal talent, including Woody Allen, Sharon
Stone, Anne Bancroft, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, Danny
Glover and Christopher Walken, to name just a few, the story will capture
the interest of young and old viewers.</P>
<P> And the story is strong enough that you quickly accept that these are
computer-created creatures and get totally involved in their insect lives
and dreams.</P>
<P> Allen is Z, a worker ant who is tired of being like all the other workers.
He tells his shrink that he "feels insignificant," to which the
psychologist (voiced by director-actor Paul Mazursky) congratulates him on
making a breakthrough. "You are insignificant," he explains to Z.</P>
<P> At a workers' bar, Z meets Princess Bala, who is slumming away from the
palace. They dance, creating their own steps, thus breaking away from the
others who are marching in step.</P>
<P> To see her again, the smitten Z trades places with Weaver (Stallone), a
soldier ant. After a dress parade, the soldiers are sent by the mad Gen.
Mandible (Hackman) to make war on the termites.</P>
<P> Z is the only survivor and is declared a hero.</P>
<P> Later, Z and Bala share many adventures and thwart Mandible's wild scheme
to begin a new colony.</P>
<P> It's all fairy tale-like, but in a sense rather adult.</P>
<P> The script, by Todd Alcott and Chris and Paul Weitz, is droll and quirky,
filled with many zingers and one-liners. The writing, especially that of
Allen's Z, feels as if the writers watched most of Allen's films to get his
vocal cadence and rhythms. In a sense, when Allen speaks, it almost sounds
as if he wrote his own lines.</P>
<P> What makes Antz successful is that the performers take their roles
seriously. Hackman sounds like a demented Patton, while Walken brings his
usual creepy persona to his role as the general's aide.</P>
<P> Even Stallone has some fun as the soldier ant, who trades places with Z so
he can meet some female workers.</P>
<P> Antz is a rewarding experience. It will enchant the children and rivet
their attention. Adults will appreciate the movie's technique and humor.</P>
<P> It is truly a film for the entire family and a portend of the road the new
Dreamworks studio is creating.</P>
<P> With this, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and the upcoming Prince
of Egypt, Dreamworks will be a Hollywood innovator.</P>
