<PRE>Mystery Men Review
Starring:Ben Stiller, William H. Macy</PRE>
<P>  Usually when a blockbuster comes out, it's loaded with effects, stars, bad
scripts, and plenty of action. Mystery Men may contain an all-star cast, and
efects, but the clever script and characters are what really works, which is
rare to see this year.</P>
<P>  The film is based upon the comic book series "The Flaming Carrot" by Bob
Burden, in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime, only to be out
done by the real hero of Champion City, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). Things
go a little haywire, when the sinister Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) is
released into the city, where he captures Captain Amazing, and plans to wreak
havoc upon Champion City. Well, the trio decide to take matters in their own
hands, by saving the city, but first they need some assitance. This is where
the film takes a turn for the better.</P>
<P>  In the beggining, there were only 3 wanna be heroes. "Blue Raja (Hank
Azaria), "Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) and "The Shoveller (William H. Macy). Sure
they were enterataining, but their acts grew old fast. that is until they
aquire "Invisible Boy" (Kel Mitchell), and "The Bowler" (Janeane Garafalo) and
"Mr. Splein" (Paul Reubens), 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a
disastorous mess. Thankfully, the original 3 heroes become amusing, with some
support of Reuben and Garfalo on screen.</P>
<P>  The whole premise is rather ridiculous, but packs a few punches to keep
interest. For one, the film is considerably clever. It literally pokes fun at
super hero films, like Batman And Robin, Superman etc. In fact, many scenes are
similar to Batman And robin, including the opening sequence, only altered in a
humorous and superior way. A part of the cleverness comes from the cast.
Sometimes a film with such talent is overblown, but the acting is what keeps it
alive here.</P>
<P>  While Azaria and Macy were enteratining, 2 characters really stood out. One
was Paul Reuben. No matter how disgusting or revolting "Mr. Splein" may be, you
still can't help but laugh. It' so incredibly moronic, it's just a riot
watching Reuben relieve himself of bodily functions. Janeane Garafalo also was
an interesting character. She seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing
character on screem, due to her enthusiasm, that kept the film flowing. Men is
worth seeing alone, for those 2 troubled heroes.</P>
<P>   On the downside, a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really
lift off. Kel Mitchell and Geoffrey Rush, were both utterly useless. Their
parts were so limited, they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20
minutes. Ben Stiller too was wasted, mostly because of his unlikeable power and
dialogue. None of these characters get a rise out of anybody, but happily they
are lost in the charming flow of the film.</P>
<P>  As far as the budget goes, it was wisely spent on the cast, not the effects.
While the set designs and action all look nice, I'm glad there was a seperate
aspect, that the film focused on, and for that I applaud.</P>
<P>  Slow at times, and rather pointless, Mystery Men still delivers. It forgets
about money making, because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's
proceeders, and that's what works. Stupid? Maybe, but for once I'm not
disappointed. No one expected an intelligent film, but you get a film thats wit
captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year.</P>
<PRE>3 stars out of 4</PRE>
