<P>   When Mark Twain wrote about innocents abroad, he had
no idea just how much trouble spoiled American kids could
get into when traveling outside their own liberal democracy. 
But Joseph Ruben certainly did when he directed last year's
"Return to Paradise," about two New York City men who are
strongly advised to return to Malaysia to confess their part in
a drug crime lest their friend get hanged.  Like Ruben's film,
Jonathan Kaplan's "Brokedown Palace" is about motifs like
responsibility, conscience and redemption, but his three
principals do not give him the strong performances turned out
by Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche and Joaquin Phoenix in last
year's dramatic movie about a similar subject.
For all its vivid camera work in photogenic Bangkok,
Thailand, "Brokedown Palace" is the sort of melodrama that
would fit more into a quality TV movie niche than it does on
the big screen.  The film is absorbing at times--a movie about
teens which, like "Election," is really directed toward a more
mature audience--but on the whole rings false because the
lawyer's redemption is not at all credible and the final
affirmation of one of the young women is uncalled for and
thereby bogus.</P>
<P>   Despite these faults what you've got to hand to the
production team is its guts in daring to imagine a pattern of
corruption in one of America's friendly nations abroad, a
design which, however exaggerated, has a ring of
authenticity.  The government of Thailand would obviously
not welcome the filming of this movie in Bangkok.  (It was
shot in the Philippines.) After all, if you were a high-ranking
minister in charge of film regulation in a tightly governed
monarchy (actually more of a military dictatorship), would you
welcome a shoot whose script reveals your beloved land as a
Third-World stinkhole? </P>
<P>   The innocents abroad, teens Alice (Claire Danes) and her
bosom buddy Darlene (Kate Beckinsale), are presented by
their folks with trips to Hawaii for their high-school graduation.
Instead they head out secretly to Thailand because the fun
that should await them there seems less "middle class." 
Indeed.  After sneaking into a fancy hotel pool, they are
caught charging their drinks to an actual guest's room and
are bailed out by charming 20-something Australian
businessman, Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who wines and
dines the two and generously gives them two tickets to Hong
Kong for the weekend.  He is allegedly to join them later. 
Unbeknownst to the girls, Nick is a drug smuggler responsible
for stashing a stash of heroin into their luggage where it will
presumably be picked up by an accomplice in Hong Kong. 
Seized at the airport by police, the girls are tried, quickly
found guilty, and hire money-grubbing, ambulance-chasing
ex-patriate lawyer Hank the Yank (Bill Pullman) to help them
out.  </P>
<P>   Director Kaplan places heavy emphasis on the tense
friendship between the two teens.  Though they have known
each other for years seemingly without conflict, Alice deeply
resents Darlene's behavior in stealing away the dashing
Australian with whom Darlene spends the night.  When
Darlene convinces Alice to fly with her to Hong Kong only to
be arrested along with her, Alice, already on edge from the
romantic interlude, suspects Darlene of yet another, far more
serious betrayal.  Yet when put into a primitive Thai jail to
serve a sentence of 33 years, they stick together, surrounded
by women prisoners and guards whose language they do not
speak.  When the crunch comes and Alice has a chance to
free her friend, she must decide how far she will go--just how
precious their lifelong friendship has been.</P>
<P>   Danes has done better work in the edgy, postmodern
"Romeo and Juliet" and a year after that in "The Rainmaker," 
while some believe that Beckinsale should have been Oscar-
nominated for her role in last year's "The Last Days of
Disco."  Their talent notwithstanding, they have little of
substance to work with this time around, coming off like a
couple of foolish, banal kids--one naive enough to sign a
statement (actually a confession) written in Thai, the other
flustered enough to think she owes her idiotic friend a huge
favor despite her being conned into signing on to the fateful
trip to Hong Kong.  Bill Pullman comes off the best, as
expected, as a sleazy lawyer who sees better opportunities
defending rich kids in a faraway place than he could find in a
far more prosperous country that for all its litigiousness has
too darn many attorneys.  Kaplan takes some fairly
hackneyed tourist shots of the famed temple area in
Bangkok, the seedy, commercial side streets, and best of all
the rank prisons in which inmates have to shout in a group to
their visitors across thirty feet of space.  But the movie will
have served its purpose if only to warn prospective tourists
headed for foreign lands to check their luggage before
heading to the airport and once again before passing through
customs.  After all, what chance have you got to be found not
guilty when everyone from the hotel bellmen to the Minister of
Justice is on the take--not to forget high U.S. officials in our
embassies abroad--their financial assets dependent on how
many unsuspecting tourists they can railroad to the brig?</P>
