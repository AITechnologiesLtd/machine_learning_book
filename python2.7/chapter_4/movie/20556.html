<P>DICK is the best kind of stupid movie: the kind that knows it's 
stupid. It is the work of filmmakers who have thrown all credibility 
to the wind in favor of going for one ridiculous gag after another. 
Most of the jokes work, and when one doesn't, you still have to 
admire them for even trying it in the first place.</P>
<P>The film takes as its title the moniker of former President Richard 
Nixon, who is one of many targets in this screwball satire. Its 
premise is that Deep Throat, the mysterious informant who provided 
Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with 
crucial leads in the Watergate case, was in fact the pair of Betsy 
Jobs (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams), a couple 
of dimwitted teenage girls who didn't even understand what they had 
discovered. They had been at the hotel at the night of the break-in, 
but they didn't realize what was going on, and it is only after a 
paranoid G. Gordon Liddy (is that redundant?) noticed them at the 
White House later that they began to stumble across the shady 
dealings. Convinced that they were spies, Liddy had them taken aside 
from their school field trip to a private study, where Nixon and Bob 
Haldeman cooked up the idea of making them official White House 
dog-walkers to keep them quiet. The irony, of course, is that they 
had no useful information until they were brought inside the White 
House in order to keep them from leaking information.</P>
<P>At this point, the history of the last two years of the Nixon 
presidency unfolds as a comedy of errors. The pullout from Vietnam, 
for example, is another concession to the girls, after one of them 
solemnly tells Nixon, "War is not healthy for children and other 
living things." Unique explanations are offered for some of the more 
peculiar details of the scandal, such as the missing 18-1/2 minutes 
on the Oval Office tape, which is caused, indirectly, by Arlene's 
schoolgirl crush on the President. Woodward and Bernstein, meanwhile, 
turn out to be childish idiots, squabbling with each other over who 
gets to be on the telephone with the girls (their initial phone call 
to the newspaper was only meant to be a prank) and what not. When 
Woodward meets with them in an empty garage, a noise is heard in the 
background and they fear they've been followed. And they have--by 
Bernstein, whose pratfall off his bicycle accounted for the noise.</P>
<P>All of this, of course, is absurd (though I do wonder if the details 
of the real Watergate scandal would seem believable if they hadn't 
actually happened). But everyone involved seems to know it's absurd, 
and neither director Andrew Fleming nor any of the performers take 
any of it remotely seriously. While there is, of course, an element 
of political satire present, most of it is fairly obvious, as the 
filmmakers are by and large unconcerned with maintaining any 
connection to reality, opting instead to create their own deranged 
screwball universe. All in all, this movie really has more in common 
with AIRPLANE! than it does with DR. STRANGELOVE.</P>
<P>Needless to say, DICK is not exactly what one would call a classic. I 
regard it in much the same light as this year's SOUTH PARK feature 
film, as an inventive, amusing, and largely inconsequential comedy 
(though far less vulgar). Profound it ain't, but at least it made me 
laugh.</P>
