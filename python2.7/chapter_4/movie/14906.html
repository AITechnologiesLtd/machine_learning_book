<P>   Bill Clinton has made mea maxima culpas the de rigueur du
jour, so I think I'd better 'fess up too and maybe get my own
four and one-half minutes of fame.  Back in the Jurassic Age
when I was living in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, I
was best friends with this kid, Herbie, whose dad owned the
local dry cleaning store.  Herbie's pop had a back yard full of
creatures small and little, and he introduced me, still an
innocent lad of seven, to the mysteries of the native ant
colonies.  Having explained their patterns of work and battle,
he proceeded to pour cleaning fluid on them and, while I am
now indeed sorry for what I'd done, I joined him and whiled
away many an otherwise dreary day in that activity until we
discovered the more adult joys of comic books.  Did I say
sorry?  Make that utter contrition.  I've seen the movie "Antz"
and only now realize that these creatures are human just like
us, only a little smaller.  Like the rest of us, they've got bad
guys, too, fellas that deserve a shot of Herbie's magic potion
to prevent far more treacherous perils.  I speak particularly of
some of the leaders--no, not the queen, she's OK--but the
generals.  At least the general in the movie, who is a the
biggest, baddest critter in the tunnel.  He's the dude that
favors ethnic cleansing...no, on second thought, he's not for
putting down ants of another colony who are of a different
clan, but for wiping out most of his own kind, those of a
different class; namely, the workers.  He wants to start a
brave new world of Aryan ants.</P>
<P>   "Antz" is a thoroughly imaginative and delightful 83 minutes
of pixar animation with a more riveting plot than that boasted
by "The Toy Story," made by a competing studio.  As a
parable with strong Twentieth Century resonance, it's a
chilling tale involving warnings of massive extermination and
ideological warfare, but given its romantic input it leaves us
with the feeling that love can conquer all.  Sporting the voices
of some of Hollywood's super-stars, this non-stop-action show
featuring beings who thankfully look only a bit like ants will
capture the regard of adults and leave the little guys in the
audience admiring the graphics but wondering what the heck
their parents, guardians, and big brothers and sisters are
snickering about. In other words "Antz" is not one of the
movies "made for kids but with something for the grown-ups"
but a film targeted at the mature with pretty pixars thrown in
for the kiddies.  To avoid the dreaded "G" rating, scripters
Todd Alcot, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz throw in one and one-
third naughty words each: "damn," "hell," "crap," and "anus."</P>
<P>   The story opens with ant Z (Woody Allen) on the couch,
whining--as one familiar celebrity is known to do--about his
worthlessness.  "I feel insignificant," he moans, throwing up
his arms."  "You've made a big breakthrough," exalts the
therapist."  "I have?" replies Z.  "Yes," the doctor responds,
"You ARE insignificant."  </P>
<P>   The biggest problem in this movie is that only two other
one-liners top that one.  One zinger occurs when the general
asks for time to debrief one of his privates, to which the
soldier replies, "Please, general not a first date."  The other is
a sign that appears on the ground after the soldier ants and
soldier termites wipe one another out, leaving only one ant
survivor: "One to nothing--we win!"  Yet there is much to
admire in the dialogue and certainly a lot to revere in the bold
illustrations that hit us from the entirely computer-generated
software.  What's groovy about the story line is the very many
contemporary references it has to today's world, particularly to
some of the great ideologies of the century.  One is the
danger of the military-industrial complex, as General Mandible
(Gene Hackman) pushes the worker ants to produce a great
tunnel with signs surrounding the tunnel complex like "Nothing
satisfies like work" (not a bad slogan in itself, but chilling
when you think about that infamous sign of the 1940s, "Arbeit
Macht Frei").  While driving the workers forward he cheers his
great army, telling the soldiers that they may consider
themselves quite a step above the workers in class and
importance.  (Then again, so did Plato way back then.)  But
Z, the formerly insignificant worker who becomes a celebrated
revolutionary, challenges the millions in his colony below
Central Park to think for themselves and to stop blindly
following orders, making "Antz" the most subversive movie of
the year.  Thank goodness the seven-year-old in the theater
seats won't have a clue about the dialogue.  What would
happen if they gave Z a chance and refused to comply with
everything their mommies and daddies want them (for their
own good, of course) to do?</P>
<P>   The romantic element is provided by the lovely Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone), daughter of the Queen (Anne Bancroft),
who falls in love with Z while slumming in a workers' bar and
reluctantly follows him to the perfect village known as
Insectopia.  It would reveal nothing that this land of peace and
love is none other than New York's own Central Park, and
when Z and Bala emerge from the tunnel like Plato's cave
dwellers abandoning their underground shadows, they know
they've arrived at the center of the world.</P>
<P>   One of the great scenes involves the legs of a human being
which unwittingly trample on both Z and Bala, who are saved
from extinction by the wide spaces in the running shoes.  We
get to see what it's like from an ant's eye view by watching
the legs slowly rise and fall like choppers taking off and
setting their cargo down with a thump.  </P>
<P>   It's difficult to tire of Woody Allen's celebrated, self-
depracating dialogue, though he has one annoying habit that
makes you think he's improvising.  Woody routinely says that
most irritating of all throat-clearers, "ya know" about two
dozen times, a custom he vexatiously practiced in the recent
documentary about his European tour with a band of
musicians, "Full-Tilt Boogie."  But this is a minor cavil.  When
Princess Bala, in the throes of love with Z, tells him "You're
not like anyone else," let's hope that the kids will take this
guidance to heart and halt the millennium-old custom of
mindless conformity.  But this is too much to hope for.  After
all, with the coming of the new millennium (to paraphrase
Senator Bulworth), we're not even close to insectopia.</P>
