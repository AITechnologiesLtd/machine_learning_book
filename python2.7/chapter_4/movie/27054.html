<P>Since the film has been around for several weeks it has been widely 
reviewed.  Some opinions are tepid, some  positive, others ecstatic. 
Much depends on what a viewer knows about the great Spanish painter 
(1746-1828), art, aSpanish history, Napoleonic Wars, etc.  Much also 
depends on what the spectator expects from a film about a major 
artist to be.</P>
<P>It is decidedly not a documentary, an "educational" movie, a 
traditional biography, or anything familiar in movies. The closest to 
a categorization is : a fractured Goyaesque view of periods, 
elements, the personality and the talent of Goya, qua artist and qua 
human being.</P>
<P>It is civilized cinema. Its most obvious main attribute is the superb 
cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, the Italian master who has won a 
record four Oscars : The Last Emperor, One From the Heart, Reds, 
Apocalypse Now,</P>
<P>Goya is introduced as an exile in Bordeaux (France) at age 82. (This 
un-didactic and un-academic film may give  the impression that he had 
been sent into exile, but this was a voluntarily exile of many 
Spanish Liberals who detested the royal regime). In France, the 
widowed Goya lives with his latest mistress Leocadia who is his 
junior by 40 years, and his youngest daughter Rosario who is a 
lovely, loving child, smart and wise beyond her years.</P>
<P>Old Goya is played by Francisco Rabal who was then about 74.  Rabal 
has been in about 185 movies,  Spanish, international ( French, 
Mexican, Italian, American, etc.) Many were directed by such masters 
as Torre-Nilsson, Bunuel, Saura,  Bardem,Visconti, Antonioni, Tanner 
and others.  For those who remember the younger Rabal, he is 
unrecognizable here.  The old man Old Goya is a human wreck, a 
debilitated monster, cranky, crotchety, tormented by the past and 
present, and a lip reader since losing his hearing at age 45. His 
"story" is told without crystal-clear chronology, mostly to his 
daughter or as visions, with  zig-zags of time. The flashbacks and 
flashforwards lead to a multiplicity of periods, as well as the 
joining of past and present in several scenes. (One must suspend 
disbelief in the many sections where Goya read lips so well that 
reality becomes mythical.)</P>
<P>The "young" Goya is well performed by 42-year old Jose Coronado who 
notwithstandings some 20 films is unknown outside Spain. A small 
puzzle: while Coronado plays his Goya at different ages, he looks 
essentially the same. But then, the movie is such a work a fantasy 
that literal realism is no big problem.</P>
<P>There is no way to tell the "story" without using up column inches or 
confusing the reader. The movie is self-explanatory, the art of the 
superb director Carlos Saura is apparent, his collaboration with 
Storaro seamless.</P>
<P>The film is a cauldron with a paella of thoughts, talk and visuals 
about art, with interspersed sketches, drawings, engravings, still 
paintings, paintings that move and take on life, homages to Velasquez 
(both by the film and by Goya),    "tableaux vivants," politics, and 
the long affair between Goya and the love of his life. She is always 
in his  heart and mind.  The Duchess of Alba was a great beauty, a 
great wit, a powerful political figure, the richest woman in Spain 
and at some point the hated enemy of the King and Queen. The latter 
and her lover Godoy poisoned her, says Goya.  The Duchess was the 
model for  Goya's paintings "The Naked Maja" and "The Clothed Maja" 
which stand in amazing contrast to the revolutionary series "The 
Disasters of War."</P>
<P>Carlos Saura grew up as a passionate lover of films, music (his 
mother was a concert pianist), painting (his brother was a famous 
artist), dance, theater  and everything concerning art, politics, 
psychology or behavior. His record is sublime, from realistic to 
symbolic or allegorical political films (during the years of  that 
other Francisco, dictator Franco), to poetic works on love, dance and 
music (within dramas) which blend traditions and experimentation, and 
more. He made Goya at age 67. His passion for the subject and the 
film are obvious and striking. I can't help feeling that  they are 
colored by the Master's intimation of mortality.</P>
