A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tamara Jenkins</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Tamara Jenkins</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: Precocious teenage girl during the summer before high
school, family</P>
<P>Starring: Natasha Lyonne, Alan Arkin, Marisa Tomei</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this coming of age story a precocious girl named Viv (Natasha Lyonne)
lives with well-meaning family members such as a marijuana-smoking
brother and a ditzy female cousin (Marisa Tomei ) who has run away from
her rich home. The summer before high school, Viv discovers her breasts
have grown large. Before high school starts, she must learn how to use
menstrual pads and a vibrator, lose her virginity, and deal with her
breasts and family.</P>
<P>Opinion:
I applaud the efforts of writer/director Tamara Jenkins, who manages to
provide eccentric, sympathetic characters and writes quite well. At the
same time, I think the subject matter is problematic because of limited
appeal. There's probably not a very wide audience that finds summer
movie entertainment in pre-high school menstrual pads and vibrators.</P>
