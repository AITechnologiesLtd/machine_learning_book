<PRE>                           SENSE AND SENSIBILITY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Jane Austen's plots generally do not
          appeal to me, but this adaptation is done with
          style and quiet wit that livens the story.  Emma
          Thompson's script and Ang Lee's direction make this
          the most pleasant excursion into the world of
          Austen I have yet seen.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Well, it is almost certain now.  E. M. Forster, monarch of art
house class film productions has been deposed.  With so many of his
major novels already adapted, it was only a matter of time before a new
monarch had to be chosen.  The new queen is Jane Austin.  Emma
Thompson, one of the two most popular art house actresses (the other
being Helena Bonham-Carter) not only stars in this adaptation of
Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY but in this case she even tries her hand
at writing it.  Well, perhaps suggesting that a crown has been passed
is overstating the matter, but in less than a year we have seen
CLUELESS (inspired by EMMA) and PERSUASION, and we will shortly have a
serious adaptation of EMMA and a BBC version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.
The current SENSE AND SENSIBILITY certainly has the marks of being a
prestige film.  It is directed by Ang Lee of THE WEDDING BANQUET and
EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN and it has a lush and luscious score by Patrick
Doyle who has done so many of Kenneth Branagh's films, often featuring
Branagh's wife Emma Thompson.</P>
<P>     In Jane Austen's time "sensibility" was almost the opposite of
today's meaning of "sense."  The word meant following emotions rather
than logic.  Austen's novel is of two sisters who have very parallel
sorts of stories, but one of whom approaches life with sense and the
other with sensibility.  In the story Mrs. Dashwood (Gemma Jones) and
her three daughters find themselves reduced from having a comfortable
existence to being homeless when Mrs. Dashwood's ex-husband dies.  The
widow discovers her home has been left to her step-son, John Dashwood
and his wife, the aptly-named Fanny.  John was left with the
responsibility to take care of the women, but Fanny talks him out of
the expensive duty.  The family of four women eventually are invited by
a cousin to move into a Devonshire cottage much smaller than their
previous living arrangements and the daughters' prospects for finding
good husbands are much diminished.  Marianne, the middle daughter
(played by Kate Winslet of HEAVENLY CREATURES), a women of great
sensibility (in the Austen meaning) but little sense, is attracted to
the handsome John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who seems to love her.  The
eldest daughter Elinor (Emma Thompson), a woman of strong sense but
little emotional sensibility, is attracted to Fanny Dashwood's brother,
the pleasant but oh-so-diffident Edward Ferres (Hugh Grant).  But their
plans will go awry when each man is called away unexpectedly to London.</P>
<P>     I cannot claim to be much of a fan of Jane Austen and her stories
of what seem often to me to be overwrought accounts of love and
manners.  But Ang Lee tells this story so well and with such warmth and
wit that he overcomes the weaknesses in the plot.  He manages to make
Austen's characters far more interesting than what they do.  And it is
the minor characters who have the most interest.  Yes, there is some
depth to Elinor Dashwood as the logical spinster in the role Thompson
wrote for herself; Thompson is always very good with body language.
Also Winslet is good but not really memorable as the flighty, romantic
sister.  But the minor characters are the most engaging.  Gemma Jones
has a great air of sad dignity as Mrs. Dashwood.  Elizabeth Spriggs, a
freight train of a woman, is a popular busy-body.  Much too rarely seen
outside of British TV comedy is the rubber-faced Hugh Laurie who could
read the phone book and make it funny.  Here he has a small role, but a
funny one.  Alan Rickman is usually good actor and here as the patient,
disappointed suitor he matches the sad dignity of Gemma Jones.  Hugh
Grant plays almost the same likable foul-up that he played in FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  The look of the film and especially the
costumes give a real period feel, though at least the print I saw
seemed to be faded and the film stock inconsistent from scene to scene.</P>
<P>     After I did not greatly enjoy PERSUASION earlier this year I was
not expecting to like SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  In fact it was the first
film of Jane Austen that I can remember having enjoyed.  Rate it a +2
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
