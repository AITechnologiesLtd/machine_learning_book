<P>_Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Take a dash of _Trainspotting_'s scuzziness and generous helpings of the
oeuvre of Tarantino, and you've got an extremely derivative film.   But
if the film is as entertaining as first-time writer-director Guy
Ritchie's fresh and fun _Lock,_Stock..._--a smash in its native Great
Britain--the lack of originality hardly matters.</P>
<P>Ritchie takes his time setting up the players in this story about a
foursome of inept small-time hoods (Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng, Jason
Statham, and Dexter Fletcher) who stage a heist to pay off a gambling
debt owed to a crime boss (P.H. Moriarty).  The fact that these players
are lacking any real depth or substance is actually of little
consequence, for Ritchie drops them in a clever, complex, and comic caper
that takes its share of unexpected twists and turns.  It may not a
perfect debut for Ritchie, but the visual flair and ingenious plotting he
displays with _Lock,_Stock..._ leaves one optimistic about his future
efforts.</P>
