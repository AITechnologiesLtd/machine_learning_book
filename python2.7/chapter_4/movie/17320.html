<PRE>`The Corrupter' – Good Heart, but Muddled Focus
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Among the several friends that came with me to see this film, I'm
definitely in the minority when I say that there were some very good
elements about `The Corrupter' that merits the purchase of a ticket. 
But I have to caveat that by saying that to find these really good
elements, you have to be able to sit through a lot of bad elements.  </P>
<P>`The Corrupter' stars Chow Yun-Fat, an extremely popular Asian movie
star who possesses confidence, sass and style.  He transfers his
charisma successfully onto the screen as Lt. Nick Chen, a revered
officer that leads the Asian Gang Unit in New York City.  It's a very
tough assignment, and it's made no less difficult with the ongoing
power struggle between two rival ethnic Chinese gangs.  In one scene,
gang members bomb a small store with enough explosives to level a
square block.  When the half-alive, hapless victim stumbles out onto
the street, the gang members walk up to him and fire their weapons
until all of their bullets have been used.  The gang war is malicious
and body counts will continue to rise.</P>
<P>To help Chen, he is assigned green cop Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg). 
Chen looks at him with disgust.  He seems too soft.  But worst of all,
he's white.  It's a political decision within the force to bring in
Wallace.  Chen does his best to get him up to speed, although
grudgingly.  He saves his life more than once and tries to show him
the mentality of the Asian man.  In one lesson, Chen says while eating
his beef tripe soup, `if you want to be Asian, you've got to eat the
nasty stuff.'  Chen actually has some terrific scenes and his
character is complex yet well developed.  In fact, the Chen character
is what drives this movie. The movie itself plays out like the typical
story of two dissimilar cops who constantly bicker as they make their
way to the final showdown.  At some point, their relationship does
take an intriguing turn.  But the plot becomes mired in twists and
revelations that make the story too difficult to follow.  Heavy
accents also make some of the dialogue incomprehensible.  </P>
<P>The real joy of the film is Chen's character. He is a minority police
officer that has overcome many glass walls in trying to establish
himself but has trapped himself within the politics of the Asian Gang
Unit along the way.  We learn about his thought process, his secret
involvement with the rival gangs and even his poignant relationship
with a prostitute who is a victim of the gang's prostitution trade. 
Wahlberg's presence makes a nice counter story as he is also new to an
unfamiliar territory and needs to find ways to prove his worth.  But
his acclamation process onto the team is a series of coarse statements
by fellow Asian officers.  Among other things, they compare their
manhood, and I can only guess that these officers never saw `Boogie
Nights.'  Alas, I'm torn.  There was so much to like about the
characters, but so little to praise about the story.  Still, I'm
giving this a marginal recommendation, because I think that Chow
Yun-Fat deserves a nod and there seemed to be something definitely
good in there, but never had the right focus to get out.  Too bad.</P>
