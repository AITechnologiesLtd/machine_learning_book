<PRE>A LIFE LESS ORDINARY</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: *** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>20th Century Fox / 1:43 / 1997 / R (language, violence, sexual 
material)
Cast: Ewan McGregor; Cameron Diaz; Holly Hunter; Delroy Lindo; 
Ian Holm; Stanley Tucci; Maury Chaykin; Ian McNeice; Dan Hedaya
Director: Danny Boyle 
Screenwriter: John Hodge </P>
<P>The opening scene of "A Life Less Ordinary," the new comedy from 
the creative team behind "Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave," 
takes place in heaven, and although eventually messy plotting in 
the last half-hour almost sends the film to script hell, it's 
still quite an enjoyable, fast-paced romp. Sturdy acting, 
splendid visuals and warped originality amount to much in the 
long run and act as a steering wheel to jerk the movie back on 
track whenever it veers off course -- which is more often than 
you'd think. </P>
<P>The film's afore-mentioned kickoff finds bumbling celestial cops 
O'Reilly (Holly Hunter, who's never looked more luminous) and 
Jackson (Delroy Lindo) receiving an ultimatum from Chief of 
Police Garbiel (Dan Hedaya), who is under pressure from God to 
"unite men and women" -- they must successfully play matchmaker 
for a pair of humans, or spend the rest of their existence 
walking on earth. But uniting target couple Celine (Cameron Diaz) 
and Robert (Ewan McGregor) isn't as easy a task as it sounds -- 
she's a pampered heiress who passes the time by shooting apples 
off the top of the hired help's heads, he's a janitor for her 
wealthy businessman dad (Ian Holm) who dreams of writing the 
"great American trash novel." </P>
<P>Their lives collide right away -- when Robert loses both his job 
and his apartment, he storms into the office of his boss, who 
happens to be in the midst of scolding Celine for a recent pistol 
and fruit-related accident. Operating on impulse, Robert takes 
Celine hostage, but her general willingness and lack of 
resistance throws him off. She dislikes her father just enough to 
work with Robert on a kidnapping scheme -- they'll hit him up for 
a hefty ransom for her safe return, then take the money and run. 
O'Reilly and Jackson trail Robert and Celine the whole way, 
staging wild tricks that give them little choice but to fall in 
love. </P>
<P>Less is certainly not more in "Ordinary"'s case. It takes pride 
in its overabundances, and for the most part, so do we. The 
characters are quirky, the story is interesting and the movie's 
funky visuals are not to be denied. Considering the cheeky 
material that's being performed, it's a blessing that "A Life 
Less Ordinary" never sprouts an overtly serious edge, even when 
the first hour's fascinating execution is traded in for a 
send-off that grows progressively non-sensical, including a corny 
bit of Divine Intervention and a Claymation ending sequence (go 
ahead -- scratch your heads with me). But even when the movie 
begins to fall apart, it's still pretty much a blast to watch. </P>
<P>The setup is almost exactly similar to August's awful Alicia 
Silverstone vehicle "Excess Baggage," but "A Life Less Ordinary" 
livens up the convoluted territory with some really inventive (if 
flawed) material. For example, take the plight of the angels. 
Conceptually, they're a great idea, and Hunter steals the picture 
with her twitchy mannerisms and oft-changing accents. But 
screenwriter John Hodge limits their imagination by placing them 
in too-absurd situations. Why do they masquerade as bounty 
hunters for Celine's dad? And why, if they're supposed to be 
getting the pair together, are they constantly endangering their 
lives? These questions are never answered, but they make for some 
clever scenes (it's a funny running gag how violently Hunter's 
O'Reilly is knocked around). </P>
<P>"A Life Less Ordinary" doesn't fully realize its potential (a 
slightly angering flaw), but there is still enough solid material 
to keep you entertained and enchanted. McGregor and Diaz exhibit 
a strong chemistry; their sequences together -- one where she 
trains him on how to make a ransom call and another where they 
perform a surreal, rollicking karaoke version of "Somewhere 
Beyond the Sea" -- rank as the movie's brightest. And director 
Danny Boyle keeps things spinning with "Trainspotting"-like 
camera angles and even a subtle reference to McGregor's upcoming 
role as Ben Kenobi in George Lucas' new "Star Wars" trilogy. "A 
Life Less Ordinary" isn't ordinary in the least, and it proves 
that that's not necessarily a bad thing. </P>
