<P>"Kolya" deserves its Oscar for Best Foreign Film as well as its Golden
Globe . Its closest contender this year was the French "Ridicule" (shown at
the Art months ago), for its wit, originality, lavish images and clever
ironies. I had seen both films at the 1996 Cannes Festival. Both were even
better on second viewing. "Kolya" was the best Film Market ( i.e.
non-official or competing) movie I watched at Cannes '96.</P>
<P>It also deserves a clean print, which is not always the case with foreign
movies that, no matter how praised, play mostly in art houses.And since
such theaters are not big producers of income for distributors, the latter
only too often send them battered copies. In "Kolya," much good classical
music is tied to the story and very well played, so that the sound is just
as important as the images.</P>
<P>It also belongs in the tiny category of Best  All-time Father-and-Son
movies. Jan Sverak directed it. His father Zdenek Sverak wrote the script
AND plays the top role of Louka.</P>
<P>Virtuoso cellist Frantisek Louka (Franta to his family and friends, Maestro
Louka for others) was dismissed from the Czech  Philharmonic Orchestra by
order of the apparatchiks who collaborated with the Soviets. The reason was
so ludicrous that it makes good sense within the absurd context of the
times.</P>
<P>The place is Prague, the year, 1988, the last one of the Soviet  presence
that will end with the  final liberation of the country, the Velvet
Revolution of 1989 (shown near the film's end) and the retreat of the
"115,000 heavily armed Soviet soldiers that occupy our homeland" as per a
Radio Free Europe broadcast heard in the movie.</P>
<P>The specific reason of Louka's fall comes out in bits. I won't reveal it in
the body of this review, but I will do so after the end, for those who burn
with curiosity.</P>
<P>Riddled with debts even after selling his car, the cellist can hardly
survive by playing in a small ensemble at funerals in the Prague
Crematorium, which the musicians call The Bakery.  He also re-gilds ("with
real gold") inscriptions on tombstones.</P>
<P>Maestro Louka is 55, has thinning hair, a beard with more salt than pepper,
but he is a handsome, youthful figure a la Sean Connery in certain hirsute
roles. Always worried by lack of money, he normally wears a serious
expression.</P>
<P>Don't let this fool you. He is a bachelor who took his late father's advice
that a professional musical career is incompatible with marriage. But Dad
said "marriage" and not "women." Louka is a Don Juan, a womanizer whom the
opposite sex finds irresistible. There is a large line-up of ladies, all
professionals, all attractive in looks and personality.</P>
<P>If the man is politically incorrect by Government standards, as a
lady-killer he is even more feministically incorrect .He cannot resist
making passes at Klara, the group's singer, as they perform. An
incorrigible voyeur, he lifts her skirt with his bow. On the street, his
eyes rove. He still has his beautiful apartment with a view ("my tower") at
the top of a lovely old building. He keep his phone busy as he calls old,
recent or new conquests, married or into relationships. Just about all are
willing to come and spend the night. Louka's little black book and his
memory are so full that he often mistakes one invitee for another.</P>
<P>The movie paints a full, colorful portrait of Louka before getting into its
other, big topic. This starts out with the musician's need for a car. He
cannot even afford an outrageously priced, second-hand Trabant, that
famous/infamous, hardy but primitive, uncomfortable polluter from East
Germany. A grave-digger friend (another likable fellow, and with a
picturesque family) comes up with a scheme: a hefty sum if Mr.Louka weds --
in name only --a Russian woman who wants Czech papers and the benefits
thereof, mainly not having to go back to Russia.  Reluctantly, Louka
yields. This aspect is what, in the U,S. would be called the Green Card
side of the picture.</P>
<P>Nadezda, the bride-on-paper, is ravishing, speaks no Czech, has a 5-year
old boy called Kolya. Soon after the wedding she skips to West Germany
where she has a married lover, leaving Kolya with Aunt Tamara. But when the
older woman is hospitalized, Frantisek Louka gets stuck with the kid.</P>
<P>The child speaks no Czech, Louka remembers only bit of school-Russian.
Problems of  communication, legalities, and "fatherhood" arise. If you
can't guess the rest, you haven't been going to the movies enough. But how
can you help seeing things coming? The gradual bonding between Louka and
Kolya, the changes in both, the growing "Dad" and "Son" relationship.</P>
<P>This has been a genre of films of all periods and nations. Yet if the
tale's skeleton is familiar, the flesh that covers it in "Kolya" is
wonderfully original. Yes, "Kolya" manipulates its public, but sometimes we
love to be manipulated, especially when this is done with such charming,
colorful, picturesque events and details. The movie has a way of keeping
our interest without dead moments or breaks. It places whatever deja vu
components it contains within a fresh-feeling context (and a quickly
decipherable subtext) of Czech society, culture and life under the Soviets.</P>
<P>No one likes the Russians, least of all Louka's mother who lives at the
family home along a beautiful provincial square. Inventive Louka first
tells her the child is a Yugoslav, but this won't wash. The few Russians
seen are soldiers, not ogres but nice young men, as we glimpse them in a
terrific sequence where Kolya meets them.</P>
<P>The film is the production of a finally independent Czech Republic that no
longers fears censorship and can say things that were taboo for decades.
Nonetheless, what really gives it its fascination is that it remains
faithful to the unique nature of films, the bittersweet irony, the
distinctive humor, a feeling for absurdism, of films made mostly during the
artistic boom of the Spring of Prague, that hiatus which began with
liberalization in 1963 and ended with the Soviet invasion of 1968.</P>
<P>There is also that lovely thread of Czech literature that has little people
fox, or get even with, unreasonable authority -- although this is
attenuated here first because the Maestro is not an ordinary man and second
because the Velvet Revolution is what brings a closure to his problems with
the Establishment.</P>
<P>The basic scheme of Louka-Kolya rapport may be sweetly predictable, but the
details and the presentation are consistently clever and novel. Among them
is the fact that through thick and thin, Louka 's sexual adventures are
unabated. In one, a beautiful blonde violinist comes to the Maestro because
she wants to switch to the cello. It is a collector's item of eroticizing
musical talk and instruments. In contrast, on another occasion Louka calls
a different girlfriend, a teacher of Russian, not with an invitation to
spend the night but for her to read to Kolya over the phone a fairy tale in
the boy's native language.</P>
<P>The actors are superb, down to the smallest of supporting roles.  Prague's
great beauty is used of course, but functionally and discreetly, not in
exploitative travel-poster fashion. Always in the background, the politics
of the country are given a mocking or caustic rather a melodramatic
treatment. Sentiment, leavened by wit, is ever-present, but not
sentimentality in the pejorative sense of the word.</P>
<P>In an unassuming way "Kolya" covers a wide territory with warmth and
deftness. It does not bang, it glides.  Its production values are
first-class, especially the imaginative and unpretentious photography and
editing.</P>
<PRE>A winner all the way.</PRE>
<P><HR>What caused Frantisek Louka's dismissal from the Philharmonic.</P>
<P>Louka's brother had emigrated to the West and done well. Louka was allowed
to visit the West. On his return he was grilled by the Czech police.</P>
<PRE>"Did you meet any emigres?"
"Yes"
"Did you speak to them?"
"Yes"
"What did you discuss with them?
"Just the usual shit, Comrade Blaha."</PRE>
<P>That did it. That was the impertinent answer that cost Louka his job.</P>
