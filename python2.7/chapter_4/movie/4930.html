<PRE>                                 DIABOLIQUE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I've been awaiting this update of the 1955 classic French thriller
with a mixture of nervous anticipation and deep-seated dread.  The
original DIABOLIQUE was one of the few examples of how thrillers ought to
be made...and I figured Hollywood would find some way to screw up the
remake.  (They did, of course.)</P>
<P>     The story is timeless.  Evil boarding school principal Guy (Chazz
Palmenteri) is married to ex-nun Mia (Isabelle Adjani), a nervous "child
bride" with a penchant for heart medication.  Guy also has at least one
mistress, the cold-as-ice Nicole (Sharon Stone), and everyone knows of and
quietly accepts the affair.  They all work and live under the auspices of
the school, and in the darkness of its halls, a plot is hatched by Mia and
Nicole to do away with Guy for good.  It starts to get a little hairy
when, after a seemingly perfect murder is pulled off, things start to seem
not-so-perfect and questions over potential witnesses and the actual
life-or-death-ness of Guy begin to surface.</P>
<P>     As it turns out, my skepticism that DIABOLIQUE could be successfully
Americanized and transplanted into the future 40 years was partly
unfounded.  While it retains a distinctly nostalgic look and feel, the
update is mostly a seamless job.  Stone pulls off an excellently icy
performance, reminding us why audiences like her so much, and Adjani,
while maintaining a look of total surprise on her face for the whole film,
is too innocently cute to think anything ill of.  Pieces of DIABOLOQUE are
stylish and cool, even bordering on edge-of-your-seat suspense at times.</P>
<P>     Then come the problems.  Enter Kathy Bates, whose philosophy about
acting is "More is Better," as an obnoxious investigator who really gets
on your nerves.  Add Palmenteri's just-like-I-did-in-JADE performance and
you've got a mixed-quality picture already.  The kicker is the pasted-in
additions to the script, as writer Don Roos just couldn't leave the
original alone, adding in some long and uninteresting expository scenes,
some silly high-tech bits, and, the worst of all, a new, schlocky
horror-style ending.  With all this, the picture starts to seriously fray
around the edges.</P>
<P>     What this all ends up with is some good performances and some bad
ones in an uneven film with some high points and some low ones.  The
remake ends up nowhere near the mastery of the original, which *still*
ought to surprise you even after you watch the 1996 version.</P>
