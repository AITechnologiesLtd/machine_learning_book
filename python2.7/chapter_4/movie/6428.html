<PRE>                           GREENAWAY'S PILLOW BOOK
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Froilan Vispo
                        Copyright 1996 Froilan Vispo</PRE>
<P>Someone had made a post days ago seeking info on a Peter Greenaway, who
I do not know, and yesterday there was an enthusiastic post on THE
PILLOW BOOK by Peter Greenaway (DROWNING BY NUMBERS, THE COOK, THE
THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER, PROSPERO'S BOOKS) which I had seen last
September, so here's my contribution on Greenaway and his latest film.</P>
<P>THE PILLOW BOOK is about a young Japanese fashion model, Nagito (Vivian
Wu), with a predilection for writing on skin.  Attention-getting
premise, to be sure, with lots of erotic and symbolic potential.  The
film brings together two intimacies: the knowledge of the lover's skin
with the revelations of the personal diary, for the knowledge of
another's thoughts is intimacy itself.</P>
<P>The film takes its title from a diary of random observations, organized
under headings similar to "Annoying Things" or "Things We Love," which
were recounted and written at the bedside by its author, a Japanese
lady of the court.  Nagito will write her own pillow book, and the film
follows the painful completion of hers.</P>
<P>Our protagonist's father was himself a writer on skin as well as an
author, often writing on Nagito's skin when she was a child with a
calligraphy brush, chanting the same phrase again and again, something
like "...and He made her out of clay, and He took up His brush, and
painted in her eyes, her breasts, and her sex.  And then He painted in
her name,  so that she will not forget." (It has been awhile since I've
seen this film, so any corrections/reminders, such as our protagonist's
name, as well as opinions, are invited.)</P>
<P>Nagito grows up and makes a bad marriage.  Then, like her father, she
also attempts to write, at the same time struggling (as all artists
must, it seems) to make a living, until she is discovered (as all
supermodels are, it seems) and becomes a fashion model whose dalliances
are much sought after by papparazzi.</P>
<P>Like her father, Nagito makes another mistake - she gets into the
publisher's bed, in a way (and here lies another twist that will remain
unrevealed).  You see, she had met this publisher's translator and
lover, Jerome (Ewan MacGregor), earlier and had judged his sexual
potential to be poor based on his calligraphic ability.  But Jerome
becomes her means of getting her own books noticed.  How?  By bedding
him and writing her manuscript on the Jerome's skin for his
publisher/lover to read and eventually, obsess, over.</P>
<P>One more mistake - she falls for the Jerome and the rest of the film
sees her struggle to complete her contractual obligation to her
publisher for the possession of the most-prized pillow book of all (see
details after the SPOILER warning below) - one that truly combines
thought and touch and remembrance of past love.</P>
<P>I very much wanted to like this movie but it failed on several points.</P>
<P>If you like Greenaway's usual lush art direction, there's much to watch
here.  Too much, in fact.  At several points smaller screens are inlaid
along the edges of the main one, each filled with its own images, so
either you twist your neck making glances or your eyes are drawn to the
peripheries concentrating on nothing.  Either way you are left with
nothing but fragments.  Showing far more than can be possibly observed
becomes a poor excuse for seeing any movie again, and the interest
wasn't there to warrant a second viewing of TPB.</P>
<P>There is Nagito's own writing.  If her writing wasn't up to publication
standards the first time around, how does it become more worthy of
publication or obsession when written on the publisher's lover's skin?
It's too gimmicky and backfires on our protagonist, and I would be
willing to forgive on this point if we were given adequate proof of our
Nagito's skills, but we are given little, and the hints offered weren't
exactly enthralling.</P>
<P>The story becomes a tiring game of one-upsmanship at the end, a movie
revolving around a gimmick.  In DROWNING BY NUMBERS the story
progresses along with the counting of numbers one to one hundred,
sometimes appearing where unexpected.  Here, again and again,
love-poems written on bodies are offered, and with each new one we are
asked to  play a guessing-game with Greenaway playing the braggart who
offers us no choice but to endure this display of cleverness.</P>
<P>This is not the first time I came out of a Greenaway film
disappointed.  I recall being infuriated by THE COOK, THE THIEF..., all
that pomp and ceremony adorning a bad joke masquerading as a plot.
What disappoints more is that with his undeniable intelligence, with
all his daring and virtuoso art direction, the narrative and
characterizations end up neglected, and sadly this is true for TPB.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, for a film with so much erotic potential, there was very
little of it, if any at all, in the actual movie.  With so little to
relate to, we end up playing the role of the uncaring voyeur.
Greenaway cares enough to make us pay attention, but makes no effort to
make us care.</P>
<P>I was willing to be seduced, was almost awed into submission by the
visual glory of it all, but ended the film discovering that I had
played the role of the unsatisfied lover who is all too aware of "what
might have been, what might have been." No, I didn't rush up and out of
the theatre after a film to work away with my paintbrushes with glee.
Instead, months later, I type away at my keyboard venting my
frustration with Greenaway's flashes of genius.  If only he could keep
it up for an entire movie....</P>
<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>Jerome dies and a grieving Nagito is inspired to write her masterwork
on the dead Jerome's skin.  The publisher, by now obsessed over
Nagito's writings, then has Jerome's body stolen and flayed for
possession of the script-laden skin.</P>
<P>Like THE COOK..., the dead male lover becomes the object of obsession
and literally the book - in TC... the lover dies by ingestion of book
leaves while in TPB the skin is adorned by love poems.</P>
