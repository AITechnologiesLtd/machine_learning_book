<P>   What do you give to the man who has everything?  A
plane?  A horse and some land to play polo?  Women?  An
executive job in a bank?  An exquisite home?  We're not
on the same page: he HAS everything.  What is the guy 
missing in life: Excitement?  You got it.  Flying his own
aircraft, tallying goals, and scoring with women just do not do
it for him. He needs to challenge the establishment.  Burgling
an art museum would be right on the money.  </P>
<P>   When Norman Jewison filmed the original version of "The
Thomas Crown Affair" in 1968 he cast the perfect man in the
title role.  In his private life Steve McQueen, then 36 years
old, was to accumulate 55 cars, 5 planes, and 200
motorcycles as one of the highest-paid actors of the sixties
and seventies, and yet--as his first wife tells us in her book
"My Husband, My Friend," he was abusive and
self-destructive.  McQueen came out of a miserable
background and all the celebrity and money and toys didn't
do it for him either.  (McQueen died at the age of 50 while
undergoing surgery for chest cancer in Mexico.)</P>
<P>   "The Thomas Crown Affair," which was filmed three
decades ago with a plethora of new techniques including the
overuse of split-screen procedures, is such a gem that one
wonders why we need a new version.  Does the current
rendering, which replaces McQueen with Pierre Brosnan and
the 28-year-old Faye Dunaway with the 45-year-old Rene
Russo justify a new entry?  Hardly.  The plot calls for a
steamy, conflicted relationship between a burgler and the
insurance agent who is tracking him down.  Renee Russo is
not appealing enough for the role. She's no Faye Dunaway--
and this has little to do with age, because Ms. Dunaway is
again in the story albeit in a small role of psychiatrist
and looks a lot better and has more pizzazz than the current
star.  As for Pierre Brosnan, he's strikingly handsome, but
he's plastic and no match for Steve McQueen.  Mel Gibson
would have been the man for the role.</P>
<P>   The plot itself is an intriguing one, a cat-and-mouse game
between the friendliest of adversaries.  Director
John McTiernan is dealing metaphorically with two neighborly
people playing a game of chess who are wary an distrustful
of each other because high stakes are involved.  The title
character, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a
multimillionaire who buys and sells properties and owns the
very Manhattan building in which he conducts his affairs. 
Though he golfs on Saturday mornings (thinking nothing of
placing a $100,000 bet on a single shot), plays regularly on
his yacht and flies a plane, he needs some excitement in life-
-which he gets by stealing art works valued in the tens of
millions.  (In the 1968 version, Crown is a bank robber.) 
After engineering an almost inconceivable burglary of a
Monet painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art--a deed
that would be the envy of Peter Ustinov's character in Jules
Dassin's "Topkapi"--he attracts the attention of a high-
powered insurance investigator, Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo), who somehow senses that Crown is the culprit.</P>
<P>   Implausibly, Crown admits early on that he is the pirate as
the two begin to date and to fall in love with each other.  As
Crown escorts Catherine for a spin in his plane, a sail on his
boat, and even a quick weekend in his Martinique villa,
Crown dares his friendly foe to catch him.  Ultimately a
showdown approaches.  Catherine faces a conflict: will she
flee (perhaps to Brazil) with this clever thief or will she betray
him--turn him over with evidence to Detective Michael
McCann (Denis Leary) and collect her $10 million reward
from the insurance company?</P>
<P>   Director McTiernan seems confused about the time period
of the story.  While "The Thomas Crown Affair" has been
updated to the present from its original 1968 setting, Russo
bursts on the screen not in a business suit as befits a highly
placed insurance investigator but in a glamorous sixties-style
attire.  Though she is in motion throughout, she changes
outfits with such frequency that she gives the impression
she's modeling rather than pursuing a keen, albeit not
dangerous, criminal.  Pierce Brosnan is the biggest problem,
however.  He is so wooden--a trait that perhaps makes him
qualified to play the cool, emotionless 007--that he challenges
his audience to believe she could engender feelings in him
that would have him risk everything to win her over.  Steve
McQueen, by contrast, displayed a more manly appearance
as the original Crown while Faye Dunaway, just 28 years old
at the time, put herself across as both a genuinely
professional investigator and a more alluring and more
conflicted co-conspirator.  </P>
<P>   The colors are lush, images hugging the wide screen that
appropriately captures the joys of great wealth--the private
golf course, a yacht that appears to own the sea, an island
that comes across as the private domain of this one man. 
But will anyone believe he'd risk losing everything for a
woman as bland as Catherine, or that Catherine would throw
her career overboard for plastic man?</P>
