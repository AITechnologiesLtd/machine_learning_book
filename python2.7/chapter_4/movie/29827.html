<PRE>THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I was warned in advance about The Man Who Wasn't There, having been told
it was "definitely a Coen brothers movie."  Indeed, there's no better
description for this film aside from that vague insult.</P>
<P>Shot in black and white as an homage to film noir, The Man Who Wasn't
There (no relation to the Steve Guttenberg movie of the same name) tells
the tale of Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton, sporting a veritable work of
art on his head as a toupee), a mild mannered, chain-smoking barber in
sleepy 1940s Santa Rosa, California.  As Ed's life consists of cutting
the same heads of hair day in and day out, he can be forgiven for a
little dissatisfaction with his life.</P>
<P>So, when a stranger (Jon Polito) passes through looking for an investor
in a nutty "dry cleaning" operation, Ed decides to blackmail his
neighbor and local department store magnate Big Dave (James Gandolfini)
for the seed capital -- because he also happens to think Dave is having
an affair with Ed's wife Doris (Frances McDormand).  This of course is
only the beginning, as a body count starts to rise and nothing turns out
to be as it seems.</P>
<P>Or actually, as everything turns out exactly as it seems.  If it weren't
for the usual populace of Coen brothers "wacky characters," The Man Who
Wasn't There would be little more than Z-grade noir unfit for the
bargain pulp rack at the drugstore.  As it stands, it's merely Z-grade
noir full of weird non-sequiturs like some utter nonsense about alien
abductions and a bit with a would-be piano prodigy (Ghost World's
Scarlett Johansson, utterly wasted here).</P>
<P>Shot with that typical Coen brothers flair in stark and shadowy black
and white, the evocation of noir is impressive -- but in the end this is
completely and utterly ruined beyond any hope by the fact that the boom
is visible in almost every scene.  Readers will think I'm exaggerating,
but I'm serious.  At least 30 times a honking black microphone -- and
often the pole to which it is attached -- can be seen bobbing over the
heads of the actors, even moving around in the scene to pick up the
voices of different players.  It's distracting to the point where you
wonder if it's something the Coens put in the movie as a nutty gag.  If
that's the case, knock another star off my rating.</P>
<P>But the noir hopes for The Man Who Wasn't There are limited even with
its pathetic technical work.  Thornton's narration comes nonstop,
initially a charming throwback to the real days of noir but inevitably
overdoing it to the point where you never want to hear his voice again. 
The entire second act revolves around Doris's wrongful arrest and trial
for murder, but the legal case is so absurd it's wholly impossible to
believe.  That's too bad, because the appearance of Tony Shalhoub as
Doris's lawyer is one of the few highlights in the movie.</P>
<P>While it's pretty to look at and occasionally clever, the movie rambles
incessantly and just ends up as unsatisfying on a number of different
levels.  I hate to say it, because I'm a fan of much of the Coen oeuvre,
but The Man Who Wasn't There is barely there itself.</P>
