Reviewed March 19, 1999.</P>
<P>In "Baby Geniuses," directed by the wildly uneven director of some great 
movies (1974's "Black Christmas" and 1983's "A Christmas Story") and a 
particularly awful one (1981's "Porky's"), the key selling-point that is 
brought up is that babies are actually geniuses who hold the key to all 
of life's questions and are able to understand all languages (even 
though they speak in "baby talk"), and it is only once they "cross over" 
at about age two that they forget everything and become a so-called 
normal person. Although this theory is far-fetched in the extreme, it 
also is admittedly kind of intriguing. The film itself, however, throws 
all original ideas out the window in the very first scene to become a 
sort of junior version of "Look Who's Talking," minus practically all 
the wit and brightness of the story and situations. After enduring this 
mainstream family movie (kids deserve a lot better than this, even if 
they may enjoy some of it), I think it's safe to say that director Clark 
should go back to making movies about Christmas, since that is 
apparently the only thing he's good at.</P>
<P>Partially set at Babyco, a company that includes the world's largest 
indoor amusement park (a visual delight for the limited amount of time 
it recieves), the evil founder, Dr. Childers (Kathleen Turner), has 
secretly turned the basement into a scientific test area where she keeps 
a slew of baby prodigies and studies them. One of the children, Sly, who 
is the leader of the baby group, actually has a twin named Whit (both 
are played by real-life triplets, Leo, Myles, and Gerry Fitzgerald), who 
is living with a nice family unknowing of this separation (Whit was 
adopted). Through a series of incidents, Sly escapes from his confines 
at Babyco and gets loose out in the city where, the following morning at 
the mall, he comes into contact with Whit and is switched with him by 
his mother (Kim Cattrall). And so on...and so on...and so on...</P>
<P>In its whole 93-minute running time, "Baby Geniuses" included about four 
or five amusing lines of dialogue by the babies ("The first words I say 
to my parents aren't going to be 'mama' or 'papa,'" says Whit's 
15-month-old sister, "I'm just going to recite the whole Gettysburg 
Address"), but that's painfully stretching things, especially when 
nothing else works at all. Director Clark and screenwriters Clark and 
Greg Michael assume that audiences will fall for the movie if they stuff 
a whole bunch of "as-cute-as-sbutton" babies down our throats, but in 
the process, they forgot to add a few vital elements, such as charm and 
entertainment. To top everything off, the baby talk that we hear in 
english is completely unconvincing when looking at the children, who 
obviously are the subjects of cheesy visual effects that make it look 
like they are moving their mouths.</P>
<P>That there are a few actors in "Baby Geniuses" that have proven to be 
talented in the past, the fact that they have stooped so low to appear 
in this clap-trap is mind-boggling. Kathleen Turner vamps her villainess 
role up, but like everyone else, has nothing at all to do except look 
mean and bothered. Faring even worse is Christopher Lloyd, who has 
lately fallen on hard times (he also appeared in the award-winning "My 
Favorite Martian" in this year alone!), and it was only once the movie 
was over that I wondered to myself, "did I really even see Christopher 
Lloyd in it?" I questioned myself on this not because Lloyd had a 
blink-and-you-miss-him part, but because he seemed to simply stand in 
the background of shots (or in extreme close-ups) and do nothing but be 
Turner's nasty henchman. Also making embarrassing appearances are the 
aforementioned Cattral, MacNicol, Dom Deluise, and of all people, Ruby 
Dee! By the way, feel free to laugh at these actors' plummeting film 
careers whenever the mood hits you.</P>
<P>By the time the tiresome, surprisingly violent climax began, the last 
nail had already been hammered in this unfortunate film's coffin, as we 
are subjected to seeing giant robotic babies and scary-looking clowns 
jumping out, and people falling from helicoptors onto the roof of a 
building. If this sounds at all like a nice, fun-for-the-whole-family 
children's movie, then I feel sorry for you, but by all means, take the 
kids. If, on the other hand, you think that your children deserve 
better, then I am sure you will also agree with my final point: the 
makers of "Baby Geniuses" were so concerned with, yes, making the babies 
geniuses, that they seem to have forgotten to include an inkling of 
intelligence into the film itself.</P>
