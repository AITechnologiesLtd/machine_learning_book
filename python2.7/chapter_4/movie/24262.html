<PRE>                                 U-571
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This film is essence of submarine war
          film.  In fact, the one serious problem is that it
          seems inspired so much more by submarine movies
          than anybody's real wartime experiences.  This
          solid action adventure really has too many scenes
          familiar from other films, particularly the great
          DAS BOOT.  But still how can you go too far wrong
          with action scenes set on accurate renditions of
          American submarines and German U-boats?  Rating: 7
          (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Well, let's get this out of the way immediately.  It did not
really happen this way.  If you read the statement at the end of the
film, even the film tells you that it did not happen this way.  The
first Enigma machine was captured months earlier than this film's
Spring 1942 setting.  It was the British H.M.S. Bulldog whose 1941
mission in the North Atlantic captured the first Enigma.  Americans did
capture a U-boat with an Enigma machine, but not until 1944--much later
in the war.  In fact, even that was a total foul-up.  If the Germans
learned that the Americans had captured an Enigma they would have
changed their codes and ruined the precious work done by the British
cryptographers.</P>
<P>     It was the British who cracked the German military code Enigma in
World War II (building on pervious work by Polish mathematicians
earlier in the war).  That task required a chain of extraordinary
feats, not the least of which was capturing one of the machines.  When
Michael Caton-Jones wanted to make an exciting film about flying
bombing runs over Germany he fibbed and made it the last flight of the
Memphis Belle in the film MEMPHIS BELLE.  The real last flight was not
so dramatic.  It is a sort of dramatic license.  Similarly when
Jonathan Mostow wanted to make a film about submarine warfare in World
War II, he invented a fictional American mission to capture an Enigma
box in 1942.  And for those who think that it is so terrible for
Americans to claim what was really a British accomplishment, I suggest
they look up David Lean's 1952 film THE SOUND BARRIER.  So now we are
even with the British.</P>
<P>     It is spring, maybe four months after Pearl Harbor, and the crew
of an American submarine, the S-33, is called back early from leave for
a special mission that will not wait.  Commanding the submarine through
this world of rain, wind, steel, fire, and water, a world of heavy
machinery, darkness, and loud explosions, is Captain Dahlgren (played
by Bill Paxton) and his second in command, just passed over for
promotion to his own command, is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew
McConaughey).  Tensions arise as Tyler knows that the reason he was not
promoted is that Dahlgren would not recommend him for command.  But
Tyler is going to get his taste of command this mission.</P>
<P>     The S-33 has been modified to look like a German U-boat in a
deception intended to help the crew capture the disabled U-571.  This
U-boat has an Enigma code machine.  The plan is to capture the machine
and scuttle the U-boat so the Germans assume that the Enigma machine is
lost.  But as the title suggests, the U-boat will play a more important
role in the story than that.  Once the American crew finds the U-571
the pace of this film is non-stop up to the closing credits.</P>
<P>     The real problem with U-571 is the amount that has been recycled
from previous films.  The very first shot is just an eye staring.  In a
second or two we realize that it is an eye staring into a submarine
periscope.  It is very similar to the opening scene in THE RUSSIANS ARE
COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING.  In the next seconds the U-boat
torpedoes a ship and then looks around to see a destroyer headed
straight at the periscope.  Seen almost from the level of the surface
of the water it is a sobering sight.  It certainly was in the film DAS
BOOT.  The filmmakers have used very little imagination to show us
situations we have not seen before.  Perhaps DAS BOOT used up all the
good anxiety scenes that one can have with a U-boat.  But all the
classic submarine film scare sequences are somewhere here.  The
submarine is depth charged as the crew sits and listens waiting for the
concussion that will spell their death.  There is the sequence with a
submarine sinking too deep.  The water squirts in as if from a fire
hose and gauges crack.  A bolt flies like a bullet.  (That is why
submarine hulls are welded, not bolted.  That would not happen in real
life.)</P>
<P>     Jonathan Mostow, who is best known for having written and directed
the very different film BREAKDOWN, repeats those functions in this
film.  The script calls for Paxton to be mature and McConaughey to be a
little less self-possessed.  They do that reasonably well, but neither
gives a memorable performance.  McConaughey looks like he is under
pressure and sweats well, but does not make the audience identify with
him.  Harvey Keitel is a good actor who almost always plays someone
unsavory and somebody who lives outside of society.  It is something of
a departure seeing him playing a good decent career navy man with
nothing but decent intentions.  His few major scenes are really the
acting that I will remember.  Jon Bon Jovi is hardly noticeable in the
film and that is probably just fine.  Richard Marvin's score sounds
brassy and martial, but unlike the characters, the score plays it safe
and takes no chances.  Mostow, however, does take some chances and the
biggest is making this film that will obviously invite comparison to
the modern classic submarine film DAS BOOT.  He loses but, it is a
competition he could probably never have hoped to win.</P>
<P>     Perhaps we should consider U-571 to be just a fanciful thriller
set in World War II in the style of Alastair MacLean.  It is a "could
have happened but didn't" sort of action tale like THE GUNS OF
NAVARONE.  But for the familiarity of the situations I would have rated
it fairly well.  I give it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     [In November 1999 PBS ran a very good documentary, "Decoding Nazi
Secrets" on what all was involved in breaking the code.  Details are
available at <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/decoding.">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/decoding.</A>]  By the way,
capturing a U-boat is one thing, figuring out how to run it in a matter
of minutes is something very different.  It should have taken days.
That is one more place where this film takes liberties with the truth.</P>
