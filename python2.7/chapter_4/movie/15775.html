<P>   "You've Got Mail" comes across as a feathery romantic
comedy centering on two people who have each broken up
with their live-in friends and who have replaced them with
people they truly love.  This is the sort of movie that you'd
expect form Nora Ephron, who put the same actors together
five years ago in her "Sleepless in Seattle."  As sweet as
"Seattle" was, some of us wondered whether the only way to
generate old-fashioned romance in a '90s movie is to conjure
a turnout of Hollywood's Golden Age--in that case "An Affair
to Remember."  Once again, Ephron has copied the harvest
of earlier comedies: the 1940 Ernst Lubitsch film "Shop
Around the Corner," about coworkers in a Budapest notions
shop who do not realize the are lonelyhearts penpals, in turn
scripted from Nikolaus Laszlo's play "Parfumerie" which was
later musicalized as "In the Good Old Summertime," then
brought to Broadway as "She Loves Me."  
   Apparently fearing that not enough potential fans in the
U.S. would relate to a setup in a charming European city or
that they may consider a perfumery too wan to situate their
characters, Ms. Ephron updated and Americanized the old
warhorse, setting the action in her own neighborhood, New
York's Upper West Side, using internet mail as the MacGuffin
to propel the action.</P>
<P>   Though polls taken after the early screenings of the movie
show that young New York women, the targeted core
audience, are all weepy and smiles about the whimsical
adventures of Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan), perhaps they have no right to be--given the uneven
power relationships of the two principals.  It's not so much
that Joe is the scion of a major book baron who owns a chain
of megastores selling at deep discounts and who is
consciously driving independent shops out of business. 
That's the nature of the game.  It's more that Joe knows
something that Kathleen does not, conceals that intelligence
from her, and manipulates her into humiliating situations.
These circumstances include one in which he stands her up
and another that sees him toying with a lovely person who
should have been given full disclosure at the first opportunity.
Even worse, Kathleen responds to Joe's competitive drive
with a dislike that is not at all convincing.  She's just too
amiable to detest anybody and Joe is even more the cad for
suppressing what he knows.  In a romantic comedy we want
the two principals to get together after what is seemingly half
a lifetime of obstacles.  In this case we should want Nora
Ephron to make an exception.  We want her to frustrate Joe
in the final scene to punish him for making Kathleen's life
hell.</P>
<P>   As the story opens we observe that Kathleen runs a
bookstore that has been in her family for decades, one which
specializes in the sale of children's books about which the
owner knows absolutely everything.  One of her employees,
Birdie (Jean Stapleton) has been associated with her for
about as long and acts as the store's bookkeeper.  Just a
block away, Joe Fox is busy following his dad's plan to build
a megastore, one which will sell all sorts of books and
distribute them at deep discounts--which he can do because
of the economics of massive purchases.  Communicating via
AOL with a cyber partner whose identity he does not know--
and who does not realize who he is as well--he discovers that
he is reaching the very woman whose business he is
threatening.  Each time he runs into her, he chats in a
friendly manner as you'd expect from a guy who has the
superior edge.  When she learns that he is the man who will
put her shop into bankruptcy, she rebuffs him, but even then
her responses are so saccharin that you'd scarcely guess the
depth of her resentment.</P>
<P>   Despite the mean-spiritedness that underlies this only
seemingly dulcet story, "You've Got Mail" is a valentine to
New York's Upper West Side neighborhood, a center of
liberal, well-educated individuals who patronize a plethora of
megastores and independents as well.  The surroundings are
a perfect urban answer to the malling of America with its
variety of specialty shops, some of which are lovingly
portrayed--particularly the great Zabar's appetizer emporium
and the fairly new presence of Starbuck's.  The streets are
spotless, the residents are friendly, and those friendly
denizens include eccentrics of every variety.  They embracee
Kathleen's live-in friend Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) who
opposes all industrialization beyond the typewriter, and
Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), who in the words of her
boyfriend Joe would "make coffee nervous."  Ephron piles on
the oddities by introducing two youngsters of grade-school
age, Matt ("My father's son," says Joe) and Annabel ("My
grandfather's daughter," he adds).</P>
<P>   Tom Hanks no longer has the agreeable appearance he
exuded in "Sleepless in Seattle."  He is developing a double-
chin, his face rounding out unpleasantly giving him a look that
is without his signature character lines.  Meg Ryan hasn't
changed a bit, however, so that it's not surprising that in the
week of the movie's opening she is on the cover of both
People magazine and TimeOutNY.  Of the movies that have
cast her this year, "You've Got Mail," rather than "HurlyBurly,"
is perfect for her personality.  It's just unfortunate that the
script designed by Ms. Ephron and her co-writing sister Delia
Ephron allows Joe to take advantage of Kathleen's
sweetness.  This only reinforces the idea that nice girls don't
really win.  As critic Matt Zoller Seitz concludes in his New
York Press review, "It reminded me of one of those soap
opera plotlines where a woman falls in love with her rapist."</P>
