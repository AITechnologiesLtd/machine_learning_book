<PRE>UNDER THE SUN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Colin Nutley's UNDER THE SUN (UNDER SOLEN) is a sweet and touching story of
first love.  This Swedish movie was nominated for an Academy Award for best
foreign film in 2000, but lost to ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER.  For my money, UNDER THE
SUN is easily the better of the two.  Told with impeccable honesty, the script
by Johanna Hald, David Neal and Colin Nutley, based on the H.E. Bates novel "The
Little Farm," concerns a middle-aged farmer and virgin who goes in search of
female companionship after his mother dies, leaving him alone.</P>
<P>In a compelling, straightforward performance, Rolf Lassgård plays Olof, the
large, beefy farmer.  Although some might see him as ruggedly handsome, most
would call him homelessly plain.  In order to secure a housekeeper for his
remote farm, he takes out a simple newspaper ad: "Lonely farmer, 39, own car. 
Seeks young lady housekeeper."  He comes back to the newspaper office to add one
last line: "Photograph appreciated."  </P>
<P>With just two responses, Olof chooses the only one to send a photograph. 
Putting on an awkwardly fitting suit and tie, he goes to meet Ellen, played with
grace by Helena Bergström, who looks a bit like a movie star from the 1950s,
when the story is set.  Dressed to the nines in a blue suit and hat, she looks
like she is applying for a secretarial position in a modern office building
rather than a cleaning job on a fly-infested farm.</P>
<P>Actually, the farm may be primitive, but it looks quite inviting.  With Jens
Fischer's golden-tinted cinematography and Paddy Moloney's soothing music, the
Norwegian tourist board should set up a booth in the theater lobby.  Bookings
for Norwegian tours should be brisk afterwards.</P>
<P>UNDER THE SUN goes for naturalness where other movies might try for bits of
sensationalism to ignite the viewers used to Hollywood dramatics.  Rather than
throwing himself at Ellen, Olof worships her from afar.  It is she who makes the
first move, a little kiss, which causes him to jump away.  In contrast to Olof,
who treats women with so much respect that he's afraid to touch them, his
younger friend, Erik (Johan Widerberg), brags about having had hundreds of
women.  Erik is only willing to say the dreaded "I love you" if it quickly gets
something in return.  Needless to say, Erik is suspicious of Ellen's motives.</P>
<P>The one mystery that keeps nagging at the viewers and at Erik is what an
attractive 33-year-old woman like Ellen would find in Olof.  The answer to this
question isn't quite the shocker that many might expect, but it sets up a
touching and satisfying ending to a delightful little tale.</P>
<P>UNDER THE SUN runs 1:58.  The film is in Swedish with English subtitles.  It is
not rated but might be R for sexual situations and would be acceptable for
teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, October 19, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
