<PRE>                           SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<P>        "What exactly does the 'it' refer to?" my mom asked in an 
accusatory tone when I brought the SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT video 
home. "Commitment," I replied, to get her off my back, but that 
couldn't be further from the truth. The 'it' in SHE'S GOTTA HAVE 
IT is S-E-X, a topic Spike Lee usually puts on the back burner in 
favor of his usual favorite topic: race. But in his debut film, 
directed with labored shots in artsy black-and-white (and one 
brief color sequence), race is a barely-mentioned factor in a story 
of relationships. Of course there are no white people in the movie -- 
you know if Lee could have possibly been able to film the movie in 
just black instead of black-and-white to make a metaphorical point, 
he would have.</P>
<P>        Nona Darling (a made-up name if I've ever heard one) 
is a successful woman in her 20's who is juggling purely physical 
relationships with three men who want more. There's average 
working man Jamie, rich conceited oreo Greer and immature 
pint-sized Mars (Lee himself, naturally). She sees them as parts 
of one big, well-rounded man and doesn't want to choose between 
them or settle down with any one of them. In her words, she's got 
a job and an apartment and doesn't want someone leeching off of 
her, little Mars in particular because, as Dr. Ruth has pointed out, 
one can never have a fully satisying relationship with anyone 
named after a planet (sorry, Jupiter).</P>
<P>        SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT isn't like most other Spike Lee 
films. Besides the absence of white (people) and color (film), nearly 
all the characters are likeable (except Greer, who actually uses the 
phrase, "The minute you get fat, I'm leaving you"), even Nona's 
friend Opal, one of those devastatingly beautiful Hollywood 
lesbians who tries to pull all of their friends into the web of 
experimentation. That storyline is never resolved, but then neither 
is the overall one, which keeps in the tradition of a woman who 
wants the bellboy but doesn't want him carrying any emotional 
baggage.</P>
<P>        Overall, there's not too much meaning in the movie and 
it's about as believable as the Ace of Base "All that she wants is 
another baby" song. We know 95% of men in the world would 
jump at the chance to get the sex without the commitment, but 
what percentage of women out there would want a similar 
arrangement? And how many of those would actually want to 
see Spike Lee pantsless? I guess it's all part of the Hollywood 
lesbians believability package.</P>
