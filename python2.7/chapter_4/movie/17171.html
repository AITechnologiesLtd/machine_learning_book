<P>The next time you go to a store that rents or sells video games, take a
look at some of the titles.  A lot of them are based on popular film
titles (Mission: Impossible and GoldenEye) or television shows (South
Park and Beavis & Butt-Head), but when was the last time you said, `Hey,
they oughta make this game into a movie'?  And when was the last time
that a film based on a video game was watchable, let alone good?</P>
<P>Remember Double Dragon and Super Mario Brothers?  How about Mortal
Kombat and its legendary sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation?  Granted,
the makers of these movies probably didn't dust off the ol' mantle in
anticipation of winning multiple Academy Awards.  Aside from MK's
soundtrack, they're all pretty much a waste of money, time and film.</P>
<P>Wing Commander (1/2 *) follows in the great tradition of game-to-screen
failures and is actually not better than a sharp stick in the eye.
That's right – I would actually prefer to lose the power of sight in one
of my eyes than see a film this wretched.  Its story is deplorable and
acting third-rate, but it has the common courtesy to keep its running
time under 100 minutes.  100 mind-numbing minutes.  100 minutes that I
would like to have back.</P>
<P>Commander is set in the year 2654 during an intense war between Earth
people and these cat-like people called Kilrathi.  As the film opens,
the Kilrathi have just destroyed a big Earth spaceship and have sent a
huge fleet to wipe out our planet.  And they can arrive in our solar
system very quickly because they have stolen something called Pegasus
Navicom A.I. that tells them which black holes to fly into in order to
save time.</P>
<P>Luckily, us Earthlings have two hothead fighter pilots on our side.
Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard (both of She's All That fame)
deliver a secret message that's been entrusted to them by the Admiral,
then join a rag-tag squadron of other fighter pilots.  Then they fly
around and blow stuff up and save the world – nay, the universe.  And
that's pretty much it.  There is very little air combat, practically no
decent special effects, and you barely get a glimpse of the kooky
Kilrathi soldiers.  So, that leaves you with Prinze, who is a horrible
actor, and Lillard, who is downright ugly.  That's an equation that
doesn't equal big fun regardless of what galaxy you're from.</P>
<P>Writer/Director Chris Roberts, who has no feature film experience but
created these characters for the second and third installments of the
popular PC game, should not only be strung up by his thumbs but should
also be beaten about the head and shoulders with a blunt object until
his face resembles red pudding.</P>
<P>Like my old Aunt Pearl used to say, `If you don't stand for something,
you'll go for anything.'  Of course, that doesn't have anything to do
with Wing Commander, but every once in a while she would poop her pants
and smell up the house.  I would rather clean up her rancid feces than
see this film again.  Consider yourself warned.</P>
<P>1:38 – PG-13 for adult language, some sexual content and adult
situations</P>
