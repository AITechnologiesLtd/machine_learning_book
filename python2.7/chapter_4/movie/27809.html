THE YOUNG UNKNOWNS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>"The story is dead," Charlie (Devon Gummersall) says.  "Image rules."  
Charlie is an auteur, at least in his own mind.  He is a young filmmaker 
with an ego as big as the swimming pool outside his father's LA hills 
home in which he lives.  Actually, Charlie has only done commercials, 
but he has impressive plans.  In the meantime, he belittles everyone 
else from his incompetent DP (Director of Photography) to his 
girlfriend, Paloma (Arly Jover, BLADE), who is merely a production 
coordinator.</P>
<P>Writer/director Catherine Jelski's THE YOUNG UNKNOWNS is based on 
Wolfgang Bauer's play, and it shows.  The claustrophobic and static 
movie is in bad need of some opening up.  This isn't helped by the music 
choices, which are uniformly disconcerting and just flat all wrong.  The 
story, which will remind you or HURLYBURLY, concerns people "in the 
business," who hang out in a house, while doing drugs, bragging and 
trading insults.</P>
<P>Charlie tells his girlfriend his priorities, "I take care of myself - 
me, myself, I."  His friend Joe (Eion Bailey) stops by to wrestle with 
Charlie like an older brother and to show off his new squeeze, a blonde 
model named Cassandra (Leslie Bibb, SEE SPOT RUN).  Charlie loves 
himself the most, and Joe clearly has eyes for him as well.</P>
<P>After spending time listening to these four unknowns party, you will 
feel like Cassandra, who remarks to Charlie, "I am so sick of this."  Me 
too.</P>
<P>THE YOUNG UNKNOWNS runs 1:27.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
hard drug usage, violence, language and sexual situations.  It would be 
acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
