BEVERLY HILLS COP
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>As people grow older they tend to see their younger days
through the rosy glasses of nostalgia. So, now 1980s are
becoming the next golden age, and, consequently, Hollywood
films made in that "golden era" are becoming fashionable
again. This probably wouldn't please majority of film
critics who see 1980s as the darkest period of American film
history when general low quality of movies used to be in
sharp contrast to high artistic standards of the previous
decade. Decline of the quality was often blamed to the big
studios and producers who found new ways to make their films
profitable, mainly by concentrating more of their efforts on
advertising and less on the quality of actual films. The
result was the situation we have till this day - overhyped
"event" films that make good results on the box-office only
to perish from people's memory after a year or two. However,
some of 1980s films that represent such blockbuster
philosophy in its essence are actually quite good. One of
them is BEVERLY HILLS COP, 1984 action comedy directed by
Martin Brest and often mentioned as the best 1980s film
featuring Eddie Murphy.</P>
<P>In this film Murphy plays Axel Foley, undercover Detroit
policeman whose tendency to ignore police procedure often
causes rows with his superior, Inspector Todd (played by
Gilbert R. Hill). Another such row would develop when Axel's
childhood friend Mikey Tandino (played by James Russo) gets
killed by professional assassins. Axel is determined to
investigate the murder, but his boss wouldn't let him, so he
takes vacation and decides to find the killers on his own.
Trail leads him to Beverly Hills, where Mikey used to work
as security guard in art gallery run by elegant but sinister
art dealer Victor Maitland (played by Stephen Berkoff). Axel
suspects that Maitland deals in something other than art,
but local police is not only sceptical but also disapproves
Axel's unorthodox methods of investigation. Lieutenant
Bogomil (played by Ronny Cox), in order to keep Foley in
check, assigns two of his detectives - Detective Billy
Rosewood (played by Judge Rheinhold) and Sergeant Taggart
(played by John Ashton) - to monitor his every move.
Streetwise Axel, of course, won't allow that those two
distract him from his true mission.</P>
<P>BEVERLY HILLS COP was produced by Don Simpson and Jerry
Bruckheimmer and, naturally, has all the their trademarks.
The plot is simplistic and rather predictable, characters
are mostly cartoons, but all this is compensated with
spectacular car chases, shootouts and general mayhem
together with the loud soundtrack (almost all the songs, as
well as the title theme by Harold Faltermeyer, turned out to
be very popular hits of 1980s). But the secret of BEVERLY
HILLS COP success is one man - Eddie Murphy. In the
beginning, this film was supposed to be quite serious police
thriller, but Murphy single-handedly turned into comedy by
enabling his loudmouth, streetwise character to deliver
laughs in almost every scene. Because of that, role of Axel
Foley is now considered one of the best in Murphy's career.
The rest of the cast was also good, especially many bit
players like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans,
who would start building their own successful careers in the
years to come. Direction of Martin Brest, on the other hand,
is the least noticeable element of the film and this is
probably one of the film's advantages - plot develops
neatly, without overdistracting MTV-style scenes that used
to plague its sequel.</P>
<P>Additional reason why we should pay attention BEVERLY HILLS
COP is because this film illustrates some of the general
sensibilities of 1980s America. A lot of humour is based on
the sharp contrast between eroding industrial heartland of
America, represented in impoverished, blue-collar America,
and booming, rich and sophisticated Beverly Hills whose
yuppie inhabitants, law enforcement included, lost any touch
with "real" world and old American values. As a result,
foreigners penetrate and subvert America from within -
either as Japanese businessmen who buy American companies
or, in the case of this movie, European gangsters who under
cover of expensive clothes poison American children. British
actor Stephen Berkoff thus plays a distinctively English
villain - a cliche that would become almost obligatory in
1990s Hollywood. Ironically, the movie franchise later
suffered because of American chauvinism - Eddie Murphy
reportedly turned down proposed sequels with plots happening
in various cities across of the world, which was rather
unfortunate decision, judging by two less than stellar
sequels with plots situated in Beverly Hills.</P>
<P>One of the most amusing aspects of its film is the way it
treats homosexuality before "political correctness" became
Hollywood's latest dogma. Some of today's oversensitive
audience might get offended by implicit gay bashing in
scenes when Murphy's characters meets or impersonates gay
characters, usually portrayed as quasi-feminine caricatures.
Then again, those viewers who follow Tarantino's example and
start seeking hidden homosexual subcontext might find plenty
of scenes of male characters bonding and expressing love for
each other.</P>
