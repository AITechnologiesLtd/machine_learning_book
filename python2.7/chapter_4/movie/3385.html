                       A film review by Alex Fung

<PRE>Me: *** (out of four stars)</PRE>
<P>     The release of DOLORES CLAIBORNE into wide release this weekend
adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of Stephen
King's work.  This slow-moving character study provides some
outstanding acting performances by the principals, but suffers from a
tepid conclusion, inconsistent direction, and may not have wide
commercial appeal.</P>
<P>     When the maid, Dolores Claiborne, is found brandishing a rolling
pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer, it seems
like an open-and-shut murder case.  Upon hearing of the death via a
mysterious fax, Dolores' estranged and bitter daughter, Esquire
magazine writer Selena St. George, returns from New York back to her
tiny island village childhood home.  As the two clash horns, the story
behind the mysterious death of Dolores' abusive husband two decades
ago, ruled an accident despite the protests of Detective John Mackey,
is revealed.  Did Dolores kill her husband?  And did she kill her
employer?</P>
<P>     DOLORES CLAIBORNE is certainly more of a character study than a
suspense thriller.  Consequently, it is fortunate that their cast
includes some of Hollywood's finest character actors, such as Bates,
Leigh and Strathairn.</P>
<P>     Kathy Bates plays the film's title character, and gives a
sensational lead performance.  DOLORES CLAIBORNE is essentially a
showcase for the talent of Bates, as her character has a huge amount of
screen time.  She dominates the screen, producing a character that is
compelling and arresting, as we watch the character go through two
decades of history via flashbacks.  Kathy Bates' performance is
award-calibre stuff.</P>
<P>     The rest of the cast is also very good.  Jennifer Jason Leigh
plays the perpetually sour, bitter Helena St. George well, and
Christopher Plummer seems to be enjoying himself as Dolores'
ever-present nemesis, the determined Detective John Mackey.  David
Strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and
despicable as Dolores' husband, Joe St. George.  Judy Parfitt is fine
as Dolores' tyrannic socialite employer, Vera Donovan--it would have
been interesting to see, say, Meg Foster in this role.  Child actor
Ellen Muth is also worth noting as the young Selena during the
flashback sequences; she is very impressive.</P>
<P>     The direction of DOLORES CLAIBORNE by Taylor Hackford wildly
varies throughout the film, ranging from some parts which are quite
clever in their own right, to parts which are embarrassingly hokey.  The
segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in
terms of effectiveness.  The pacing of the film tends to be numbingly
slow, which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up.
However, the cinematography by Gabriel Beristain is wonderful--I
particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day
scenes, contrasting well with the many Nova Scotia ocean shots--and
Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film.</P>
<P>     It would seem that the commercial potential of DOLORES CLAIBORNE
is limited.  None of the performers in the film could be classified as
a big draw, and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a
gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and
axe-wielding psychopaths.  Although being essentially the only film in
its genre in release now, it may also be hurt by the negative
perception of King works, even with the recent critical success of THE
SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE STAND.</P>
<P>     DOLORES CLAIBORNE suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion, and
moves very slowly.  However, the performances are uniformly excellent,
particularly Kathy Bates, and the film has its moments.  On my
four-star scale, I give DOLORES CLAIBORNE three stars.</P>
