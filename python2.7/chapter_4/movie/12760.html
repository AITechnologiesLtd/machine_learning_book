<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I'd like to believe that we all see films that strike us in ways that
we know will not affect every viewer.  I was looking forward to The
Butcher Boy mostly because Neil Jordan is a brilliant artist, and one of
my favorite film makers; he has proved this over and over again, in
films like Mona Lisa and The Crying Game.  But I have a glaring personal
issue with this film --  the main character, Francie Brady, and the
portrayal of him by young Eamonn Owens.  I can say that it's a good
performance, but I'd be misreporting my feelings, because it's also one
of the most intensely annoying performances I've ever had to watch.</P>
<P>But that's not my only problem with The Butcher Boy.  This is supposed
to be a black comedy, but I found absolutely none of it even the
slightest bit amusing, let alone funny.  And it's a crazy picture, full
of misguided energy and expletives, and any kind of meaning that Patrick
McCabe inserted into his novel (on which this film is based) is not at
all clear to me from Jordan's film.  It's ironic, really, the amount of
energy that this film tries to harness, because, for all of the wacky
music and graphic deaths, it left me feeling pretty drab.</P>
<P>The film is about the childhood struggles of Francie Brady, a young
Irish boy who lives with his alcoholic father (Stephen Rae) and suicidal
mother (Aisling O'Sullivan).  He's a loud, obnoxious kid, and seems
fairly unmoved by the unpleasant conditions in which he lives.  His best
friend is Joe (Alan Boyle), and they spend a lot of time in the woods
chasing each other around.  </P>
<P>Francie's nemesis is the evil Mrs. Nugent (Fiona Shaw); he goes to
school with her son, and Francie finds pleasure in torturing the young
boy.  Later, Francie pulls a prank (a vicious prank, I should say) on
Mrs. Nugent, which gets him sent to a boarding school.  Just when
Francie seems to be improving, the head priest at the school turns out
to be a pedophile; Francie, of course, has no idea what this old man's
problem is, but the incident allows Francie to return to his hometown in
Ireland.  </P>
<P>The film doesn't follow strict plotting, nor does it have a truly
cohesive narrative.  I don't mind these elements so much, but in The
Butcher Boy, I was never quite sure what I was supposed to be watching
for.  Clearly the focus is Francie, but both the character and Owens'
portrayal of him are static throughout the picture.  If any child ever
had attention deficit disorder, then Francie is that child, for this is
a boy so out of control, so crazed, so maniacal, that I simply could not
manifest sympathy for him.  I never saw him as anything more than a
sadistic little demon, and this fact simply wrings every bit of comedy
out of the film for me.  </P>
<P>In addition to this, I can't see where Jordan has tweaked the material
to move it over the dubious boundary from serious to funny.  Elliott
Goldenthal's musical score is adequately twisted, but it takes more than
music to make this kind of material funny and engaging.  Jordan has
dabbled in graphic violence in his other films (both The Crying Game and
Mona Lisa have sudden moments of extreme violence), but he never wanted
it to be funny before.  Here, I get the feeling that I'm not supposed to
take it seriously, but there's no incentive to laugh.  So, I took the
movie seriously, and what I got was a rather disengaging biography about
a heinous, unsympathetic child.</P>
<P>The other performances are very good, and probably what I like most
about the film.  Stephen Rae is a terrific actor (and always in Jordan's
films); here, he does a good job of making us care about this man who
has wrecked his son's life through neglect and alcohol abuse.  Fiona
Shaw is an underused and underappreciated actress, and her work here
proves that she needs to make more films; her intense and often
exaggerated performance as Mrs. Nugent is the one element in The Butcher
Boy that I think works with the black comedy-feel that it seems Jordan
was going for.  Unfortunately, she, like the rest of the actors, is
stifled by the handling of the story.</P>
<P>I find great distaste in criticizing Jordan so harshly, since he is
such a fantastic film maker and because I am just a self-proclaimed
critic, but I'm confident knowing that this is the first misstep in his
distinguished career.  As for Eamonn Owens and young Francie Brady, both
are people whom I hope to never meet for as long as I live.</P>
