<P>The narrative concept of humankind's reactions to its impending
annihilation is not original. Numerous stories have been written that
explore the compelling question of how people deal with a world that
is ending. During the Cold War, this question was especially poignant
because it was felt that such a scenario could actually play out. This
made it a relevant question to explore at that time. Today the
zeitgeist is more optimistic, and the idea has become more abstract,
but no less compelling.</P>
<P>The story immediately posits that the end of the world will occur at
midnight of that day, and it follows several different characters in
their various methods of coping with the tumult. It is implied that
the destruction cannot be avoided. As would be expected, there are a
multitude of ways in which people deal with the issue of impending
destruction. On the lowest level, there will be those who see no
recourse for their action, so they indulge in nihilistic destruction.
This is the least interesting dimension of human reaction, because it
is simply pandering to the basest elements. None of the main
characters take this approach.</P>
<P>The story is a composite of many characters and subplots, but the
primary character is apparently Patrick Wheeler (Don McKellar), a
young man not unfamiliar with loss. He indulges his parents by
attending a dinner with his family that is played as a holiday
reunion. It is a pathetic attempt to reawaken the warm memories of the
past, and Patrick is barely able to conceal his cynicism. The approach
of his parents is a melancholy resignation to their demise, which
perhaps is to be expected of those already in the later years of their
lives.</P>
<P>One subplot follows Craig (Callum Keith Rennie), a friend of Patrick's
whose final desire is to complete his collection. Another of Patrick's
acquaintances fulfills his life-long desire to perform his music
publicly. The president of the gas company takes it upon himself to
call each of his customers personally and thank them for their
patronage. This provides a common thread as his calls touch each of
the characters presented. Another subplot follows Sandra (Sandra Oh),
a young woman who has decided along with her husband that they will
kill each other at the final moment rather than passively allow
themselves to be taken.</P>
<P>The setup used in this story is often the kernel for a science fiction
or action narrative, by having the characters devise a plan for saving
themselves. This approach is dismissed by not even entertaining the
possibility that destruction can be avoided. The primary concern of
the film is its characters. It examines how each individual reacts
differently, and how the composite describes the human condition. The
feel of the film is like that of a scientific experiment where normal
characters have a disruptive influence injected into their existence,
and the viewers are observing their reactions in order to understand
them at a deeper level.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. The film clearly sets out to examine the specific
elements of its premise that deal with introspective human drama.
Although there may have been opportunities to explore many aspects of
the given scenario, the film limits itself to those dimensions that
are the most compelling</P>
