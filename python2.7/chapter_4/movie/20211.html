<P>   When I was a kid and saw films made in Europe
during the late 1940s, I noted that the teens on the Continent
seemed more mature than the youngsters in the States.  I
asked my dad whether this was because the 14-year-olds on
the screen were actors and not real people, or whether their
early ripening was in fact true.  He explained that here in the
U.S. we hadn't had a war on our soil since 1865, whereas the
Europeans were afflicted with every kind of armed struggle in
this century.  Bombings and machine-gunnings that go on
day after day for five years--as in the case of the Second
World War--can make kids grow up early.  Presumably in
countries like France and Germany today, the 14-year-olds
are able to play out their childhoods as nature intended--
kidding around, acting their own age rather than like small
versions of adults.</P>
<P>   But many areas of the world have not been that fortunate
even decades after World War II.  Lebanon--like Northern
Ireland--had been torn apart by sectarian violence, in their
case pitting Muslims against Christians.  Simply put, though
Lebanon--one of the few countries with more of their people
living abroad than in their home state--had a Muslim majority,
the Christians ran the government.  When the situation
became irreconcilable, civil war broke out, so that during the
years that Ziad Doueiri situated his coming-of-age movie
(1975), the city of Beirut was divided between an Eastern
part controlled by Christians and a Muslim sector in the West. 
Between the two areas was a no-man's-land, Zeytuni, which
in this remarkable film becomes the focus of the most laughs. 
The city's best brothel was located there, the one area in
which Christians and Muslims were both welcome.  "The bed
knows no religion," proclaimed the Madam.  In fact males who
patronized the whorehouse essentially used it as a sanctuary
from the fighting.  If a patron would hold aloft a bra or a panty
while walking to the house, the snipers would treat the
garment like a white flag and not fire on the turned-on fellas.</P>
<P>   Coming-of-age dramas often juxtapose the most tragic
scenes against great humor.  After all, in life, even during
some pretty devastating circumstances, people still need to
laugh and find ways to do so.  Much of the comedy in "West
Beirut" comes from the vulgar dialogue that Lebanese
citizens freely indulged in as though they were living in New
York, exchanging insults with one another that are not directly
related to the war. The comedy starts early on as Lebanon's
own Mrs. Tingle, a teacher in the city's French high school,
first leads the youngsters in a patriotic French song only to
be subverted as one kid sneaks into the building to grab an
electric megaphone and from the balcony pilots the boys and
girls into a Lebanese strain.  In the principal role of sixteen-
year-old Tarek, Rami Doueiri, the younger brother of the
director, is made by the teacher to write his name on the
board, but he can scarcely spell "Monsieur."  Although the
instructor tries to instill the lads with a love for France which
"gave you Lebanese your culture and your political
boundaries," Tarek dislikes going to school, particularly one
which has a Francophile agenda.</P>
<P>   Director Doueiri squeezes more knowledge of the Lebanon
of the seventies into his 105 minute film than you could learn
on your own in five times that length of time, creating
humorous, bombastic, and wrenching dialogue virtually each
line of which tells us something more about the culture of that
small beleaguered nation.  We quickly learn that Tarek's
father, Riad, is notably pro-French though a Muslim, but that
despite the bombings and shooting going on around him
which drive his educated wife Hala (Carmen Lebbos) to utter
distraction and to a desire to leave the country for good, her
husband will not hear of this.  "In America, they call us sand
niggers...we're all terrorists to them," he explains, and what's
more he is an ardent nationalist who brags about the
contributions made by the Arabs while Europeans were still
crawling in caves.</P>
<P>   While Ziad Doueiri has fun with side characters--with
sandwich and flour supplier Hassan (Mahmoud Mabsout) who
treats his favorite kid to food on the house, with the Madam
of the country's famous brothel, Oum Walid (Leila Karam),
who is perplexed by her new 16-year-old customer, by an
obese neighbor who cavils about everything from the rooster
that wakes her up each morning to her couch potato husband
who watches soccer all day--he hones in on his young
brother who is in the starring role of a teen.  For most of the
story Tarek acts like any American his age. He has posters of
American movies ("Airplane") on his wall.  He cuts up in
school.  He frolics with his friend Omar (Mohamad Chamas)
and is repeatedly chastised by Omar for risking his life just to
get some super-8 film developed in the antagonistic East
Beirut.  His girl friend is the orphaned May (Rola Al Amin)
who for some dumb reason insists on wearing a crucifix
although she lives in Muslim West Beirut.  By the conclusion
of the movie, young Doueiri has grown up but not in the good
sense of the term.  He is in tears, wondering what he will do
if the bombs kill his parents and he is orphaned in much the
way his girl has been.  </P>
<P>   One of the fascinating aspects of this intriguing, fast-
moving film is the background of one of the performers. 
Mohamad Chamas (Omar) was a street kid, the equivalent of
an inner-city American teen, whose mother was killed in the
1970s Civil War and whose heroin-addicted father abandoned
him years earlier.  Amazingly this fella, who turns out a
professional performance as Doueiri's best friend, had no
acting background when he was hired and, despite the quality
of his work he not only has not been scouted but is today
living in a refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut.  Let's hope
enough people with clout get to this wonderful movie, a film
that both poignantly and humorously tells us what it's like to
grow up in a war zone, so that performers like Chamas can
get the acting contracts they deserve.</P>
