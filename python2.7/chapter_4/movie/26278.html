<PRE>                          BICENTENNIAL MAN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Isaac Asimov's story comes to the
          screen with the best of intentions, but there is
          just a little too much warmth and sweetness for
          most adult audiences to fully appreciate it.  A
          robot who is already nearly perfect struggles to
          become human.  Robin Williams and Embeth Davidtz
          star.  Pleasant without being satisfying.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     In the year 2005 a father (Sam Neill) surprises his family with
a new robot (Robin Williams) whom his family dubs Andrew.  But there
is more to Andrew than just Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics.
The laws make certain that Andrew is benevolent, but he is
considerably more.  He has a streak of creativity and independent
thinking that supposedly robots do not have.  Rather than being an
appliance, he has the rudiments of actually being human.  The family
has two daughters.  One who is simply called Little Miss (Hallie
Kate Eisenberg as a child and Embeth Davidtz as an adult)
immediately takes to Andrew while older daughter Lloyd immediately
wants to see Andrew discredited and destroyed.  The father comes to
take a fatherly interest in Andrew.  We see Andrew doing some very
human things like showing compassion for a spider and trying to
master the complexities of human humor.</P>
<P>     Racial themes enter the story as a human woman comes to love
Andrew and he loves her in return, but Andrew is only a machine
becoming human.  It is years before a real romantic relationship is
possible between him and a human.  But robots are essentially
immortal and as the title implies, we see Andrew over the course of
two hundred years.  This means even though it is a longer than
average film, 131 minutes, it still covers superficially mostly only
the more important events of Andrew's life.  It seems almost as soon
as you meet characters they are old and dying.</P>
<P>     One thing the film does not handle very well is the view of
society during the passage of so much time.  Change is coming to our
society at an accelerated rate.  One need only look at the rate at
which our own society has changed in the last 40 years.  Forced with
showing the changes in society over 200 years or ignoring them, the
producers have almost entirely had to steer clear.  We see minor and
superficial changes, but not nearly the amount we would expect.  We
are left with an uneasy feeling that society has stagnated, but for
some relatively small advances in the sciences relevant to the
story.</P>
<P>     Even when Isaac Asimov's story "The Bicentennial Man" was first
published, it far from original.  Asimov had been writing for years
about benevolent robots who were misunderstood.  Ray Bradbury wrote
the story "I Sing the Body Electric," produced on TWILIGHT ZONE,
about a family getting a grandmotherly robot and learning to love
her.  Asimov combined this and with some more complex themes for his
novel.  However, the wish to become human and the slow transition to
fulfilling that wish was plundered from the novel and used very
publicly in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION with the character Data.
The viewer has agonized over Data's attempt to learn to deliver
humor and it seems unfair to make the viewer do it again.  That and
much more of Data's difficult road to becoming human is
recapitulated in this film.  Like STAR TREK, this film never
questions the smug assumption that being human is the highest state
of being.  At its best BICENTENNIAL MAN holds up a mirror to show us
what it means to be human.  But where it rings false the writers
fall back on Andrew being a robot.  That makes its observations
undependable.</P>
<P>     Some of the visuals are very good, but some are surprisingly
flawed.  In particular the futuristic skylines are unconvincing.  If
Andrew behaves too much like Data, he also looks a little too much
like C3PO.  Kudos should, however, go to the design of the robot
makeup and mechanism.  The faces maintain the look of metal and
still are expressive to what is perhaps an unrealistic level.</P>
<P>     Not surprisingly, this is Robin Williams's film.  Somehow his
attempts to be a normal human are touching but never as powerful as
Cliff Robertson is in the comparable film CHARLY.  Sam Neill, after
this film and THE DISH, seems to be vying for the title of the
mellowest actor on the screen.  Embeth Davidtz has a harder role
than Williams.  If Williams does not seem quite right, well, he is a
robot.  Davidtz is quite good as a human, which is harder.  Young
Hallie Kate Eisenberg, known for Pepsi and Independent Film Channel
ads, is her usual sweet self falling a little short of being
cloying.  Oliver Platt is always watchable.  Chris Columbus directed
and previously directed Williams in MRS. DOUBTFIRE.  James Horner's
score is unremarkable.</P>
<P>     While this film does not have all the resonance that a film
aimed at an adult audience should have, it should be good for a
young adult audience.  I give it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
