<P>Barton Fink
*** (out of 4 = good)
1991, R, 117 minutes [1 hour, 57 minutes]
[drama/satire]
starring: John Turturro (Barton Fink), John Goodman (Charlie Meadows), John
Mahoney (W.P. Mayhew), Judy Davis (Audrey Taylor), produced by Ethan Coen,
written by Ethan and Joel Coen, directed by Joel Coen.</P>
<P>Sometimes the movies have a way of playing with our heads by confusing us,
not necessarily plot-wise, but mood-wise. Sometimes we can't tell what's real
and what's a dream. "Barton Fink" is a journey into that world of vertigo
where what's real seems more like a dream with constant surprises and
unexplained occurrences. It's a satire, obviously, but what is it satirical
of?</P>
<P>The Coen brothers are no strangers to the world of the bizarre, many of
their films are seemingly normal with very unusual twists to them. We
recognize the objects, but they become foreign to us in the way they are
presented. That fascinating sense of the surreal is what this film is all
about - usual characters in most unusual circumstances. </P>
<P>We meet our main character, Barton Fink, played wonderfully by John
Turturro. He is a struggling Jewish playwright in 1940s New York who is given
rave reviews but isn't satisfied. He knows there's something out there for
him but just doesn't know what it is. When Barton is asked by a major
Hollywood studio to come out and write for them he thinks this may be his
chance to make a difference. Unfortunately, he is assigned to write a campy B
movie that has no value whatsoever. This is reflective of the society in
which it is produced; a place where only action and money matter, where
reality becomes blurred because of the isolation from the regular world. </P>
<P>Barton moves into a dumpy hotel and is befriended by his next door neighbor
Charlie Meadows (Goodman), a portly insurance salesman who seems to be the
most normal and most caring person in Hollywood. Charlie's dialogue is
composed in such a way that it seems very "written," but it also enhances the
satirical mood.</P>
<P>Barton's problem is that he feels he is too good for everyone, but does not
realize it. He writes about the common man, yet he does not accept the notion
he is a common man. He insults Charlie to his face but does not realize that
he is doing so. The chemistry between the characters is portrayed very well
as Turturro and Goodman work off of each so well because of their
differences.</P>
<P>When Barton meets W.P. Mayhew (Mahoney), his favorite writer, he is shocked
that he is an an alcoholic. His mistress Audrey (Davis), probably did all his
writing, and an attraction between the two is evident. There is potential for
a typical movie affair but it is not carried out over time and in secrecy,
just a one night stand that ends in tragedy. The film had seemed rather
offbeat until this time, but suddenly it becomes almost incomprehensible.</P>
<P>Maybe the Coen brothers got the idea for "Barton Fink" from a dream. We are
not placed in this type of atmosphere for shock value, but for a glance
through the looking glass. </P>
