<P>   With "Onegin" we're faced with one of the great paradoxes
of movie-making.  How do you depict the utter boredom that
characters in the story are feeling without making the movie
itself a bore?  This is not easy but for my rubles, Martha
Fiennes, sister of both this film's star, Ralph Fiennes, and the
composer of its musical score, Magnus Fiennes, has
portrayed ennui without boring the audience.  The picture is
slow-moving, Masterpiece-Theatre style, so that the MTV
generation would find it excruciating if any of its
representatives mistakenly wandered into the wrong screen
on the way to "Galaxy Quest."  Those who might appreciate a
solid personal story told with integrity by a director with a
sufficient budget to dazzle us with a few scenes that might
have come out of "Dr. Zhivago" could do worse than take in
"Onegin."</P>
<P>   That's not to say that the film--from the verse poem that
Tchaikovsky made into an opera and into a ballet as well with
a wholly different score--can compare with the pages
generated by Alexander Pushkin. Pushkin's verse novel
written in 1823, actually the first great Russian poem ever, is
difficult enough to translate into English.  All attempts to do
so have failed to convince literate people in the English-
speaking world of the poem's majesty.  The beauty of the film
medium is that the glory of the verse can be approximated if
the director captures the right images for the audience--which
Martha Fiennes succeeds in doing by filming partly on
location in St. Petersburg.</P>
<P>   In this creditable movie version, the title character, whose
role is played by Ralph Fiennes in his signature effete
manner, is a man who has everything.  He has good looks,
charm, money, and property--two homes, in fact, one in St.
Petersburg and a lavish country place that he has just
inherited from his uncle.  He adds up to nothing,
unfortunately, because he is an idler who presumably goes
through women with the same boredom with which he
surveys the snowy Russian landscape.  We see him at first
attending an allegedly sophisticated urban recital in St.
Petersburg, where he and his unproductive acquaintances sit
at tables gossiping about which women can be "had" and
which are not worth the effort.  After taking possession of his
new country home, he meets and befriends his neighbor
Vladimir Lensky (Toby Stephens), is enchanted by Lensky's
fiance Olga Larina (Lena Headey), but is unresponsive to the
attentions of a pretty, intelligent, eligible, and straightforward
young woman, Tatyana (Liv Tyler).  Years later, after a series
of incidents, one ending in tragedy, the romantic
circumstances are ironically reversed as Evgeny Onegin
realizes the terrible mistake he had made in rejecting the
woman who so vulnerably confessed her love.</P>
<P>   Surprisingly enough, Liv Tyler, considered perhaps an all-
American actress appropriately cast in blockbusters like
"Armageddon," profits from her earlier experience in the role
of a teen girl intent on losing her virginity during a trip to Italy
in Bertolucci's "Stealing Beauty."  She easily inhabits the role
of a reticent but up-front Russian blue blood who appears to
care little for the genteel trappings of aristocracy or for the
undemocratic convention of serfdom.  A passionate woman
seemingly fond of romantic novels that she borrows from the
Onegin estate's vast library, she risks her pride by declaring
her love to the handsome ex-urbanite and, having failed to
capture his fancy resigns herself to marriage with a proper
noble for whom she feels little emotional connection.  </P>
<P>   Of the side roles, that of the wonderful veteran of stage
and screen, Irene Worth as Princess Alina evokes the
movie's principal laugh, as she sharply advises Tatyana to
make a politically advisable match and to forget her childish
notions of marrying for love.  "If you insist on your penchant
for love," she responds, "Save it for outside the marriage
bed."  </P>
<P>   One of my favorite spoofs of 19th century Russian novels
is Woody Allen's "Love and Death"--about a devout coward in
the Napoleonic wars, featuring Sergei Prokofiev's music. 
When we hear the term "Russian literature," we all think of
Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and the like--the sort with the
long, epic plots with multitudes of characters we can scarcely
keep track of.  "Onegin," by contrast, is a chamber work,
focusing strongly on two central personalities and the internal
struggles they tussle with to carve out some happiness in
their lives without losing their integrity.  Chamber works are to
big spectacles as string quartets are to rousing symphonies. 
They appeal to a specialized audience, as should this fine
film as it negotiates the art circuit in urban centers and
college communities.</P>
