A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Darin Scott</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Darin Scott</PRE>
<P>Starring: Bokeem Woodbine, Cynda Williams, Basil Wallace, Joseph
Lindsey, Clifton Powell</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Innocent man just out of prison, tarot cards, beautiful fortuneteller,
killer</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
CAUGHT UP is similar in plot to PALMETTO. In PALMETTO Woody Harrelson
plays an unjustly convicted man, freshly out of prison, who falls prey
to a seductress who tries to use Woody as a pawn in a lucrative
kidnapping scheme. Similarly, CAUGHT UP features an unjustly convicted
man named Darryl (Bokeem Woodbine), freshly out of prison, who falls
prey to the seductive tarot card reader Vanessa (Cynda Williams).
Vanessa wants to use Darryl as a pawn in her diamond-stealing scheme.</P>
<P>The movie takes place in three stages: the whole first half, the
beginning of the second half, and the finale. In the first half, Darryl
meets Vanessa. A masked person suddenly starts shooting at them, and
Vanessa tells Darryl that her jealous ex-boyfriend Ahmad is shooting at
them because Vanessa has never returned Ahmad's valuable stolen
diamonds. The story builds as if there will be a showdown between Darryl
and the psycho Ahmad.</P>
<P>In the second half of CAUGHT UP, Ahmad goes away empty-handed, and the
showdown is left unresolved. Vanessa is apparently dead, and Darryl
concentrates on solving the location of the missing diamonds. After the
diamonds are located, and most of the main characters die in a gun
battle, Darryl turns his attention to solving the identity of a new
gunman who may be related to Darryl's past. When Darryl solves this last
mystery, the movie ends.</P>
<P>Opinion:
The pace is good during each of the three stages of the movie, but at
the end of each stage, there is little or no transition, so there's dead
space where nothing interesting happens and Darryl isn't really
motivated to do anything but sit around and act confused. Because of
this the action seems to jump and rest, then jump and rest. One source
of confusion is when unrelated people from Darryl's past pop into the
picture - - for example, his old girlfriend, her estranged husband, and
a security guard from a bank make appearances in Darryl's life. Adding
to the confusion is when dead people get undead, good guys become bad
guys, and so on. </P>
<P>CAUGHT UP is a good vehicle for actor Bokeem Woodbine to strut his
stuff, and he shows admirable versatility in portraying anger, fear, and
grief. Woodbine's costar Cynda Williams does good backup as a credible
seductress and con woman. </P>
<P>The bottom line is that CAUGHT UP is an energetic and watchable B-grade
movie that suffers from the same weakness as PALMETTO: it tries to have
too much going on at once - - instead of having plot elements and
characters blend together in one smooth suspenseful run.</P>
