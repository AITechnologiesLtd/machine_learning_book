<P>     TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE presents a fictionalized account of the 
lives of the 17th Century French musician-composer Sainte Colombe and
his brilliant, flamboyant student, Marin Marais.  The story begins with
the death of Sainte Colombe's beloved wife and progresses onward as he
tries to be the best father he can to his two daughters.  After the 
passage of about twelve years, the seventeen year old Marin Marais 
arrives, seeking to become Sainte Colombe's pupil.  Both of Sainte 
Colombe's daughters are attracted to Marais, but it is the eldest
daughter,  Madeleine, with whom he has an affair--an affair that is
destined to shape all that comes after.</P>
<P>     Were TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE a British production, it might 
appear on MASTERPIECE THEATER as a two-part drama.  The film moves at a
leisurely pace, refusing to let modern conventions drive it faster than
it's prepared to go.  Those who are unwilling to simply sit back and
enjoy the story as it gradually unfolds would find their time better
spent somewhere else.  TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE demands--and
rewards--patience from its audience.</P>
<P>     This is a movie of few words.  Take away the framing narrative of
Marin  Marais as he looks back on his life, and there's little dialogue
in the film.  As a result, TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE demands distinctive
performances from its participants when they don't speak.  Eyes, lips,
hands, and body language are vitally important to the success of the
film.  Fortunately, the assembled cast, with the possible exception of
the younger Depardieu, are up to the challenge.</P>
<P>     As for Guillaume, he's not the actor that his father is.  At best,
his performance is wooden, and it stands out uncomfortably in compari-
son to the stunning portrayal given by Anne Brochet (Madeleine).  
Guillaume lacks range, and, as result, the film takes a dramatic turn 
for the better when father takes over for son in the role of an aging
Marin  Marais.</P>
<P>     Where dialogue is lacking however, a resonant musical score takes
over.  Arranged by Jordi Savall, the soundtrack is evocative and moody,
and, as might be expected, includes several compositions by Sainte
Colombe and Marin Marais.</P>
<P>     What might at first seem like a deceptively simple story is
actually a tale of ego, passion, and the clash between the desire for
fame and the pursuit of true art.  Young and ambitious, Marin Marais
wants to play at court for the king.  Sainte Colombe, who has already
rejected that honor, claims that the call of the musician supersedes
all.  The two clash over this issue, as well as over the affair between
Madeleine and Marais.</P>
<P>     TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE is an emotional story whose potency grows
with every passing moment.  The unhurried pace of the film allows for
greater character development than can be found in many domestic movies,
and this enforces the impact of the conclusion.</P>
<P>     Costume and set design are both impressive, well deserving of the
honors already heaped upon them.  We don't for one moment doubt that
this story is taking place in the latter part of the 1600s.  If there
are anachronisms,  I couldn't find them.</P>
<P>     Despite its meandering pace, TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE is a well 
worth a look for anyone who doesn't demand a large dose of action in a 
film to keep them riveted.  This is the kind of pure drama, energized by
character interplay, that Hollywood almost never produces.</P>
