<PRE>BLESSED ART THOU
A film review by Norm Schrager

<P>I'm usually a sucker for a Disney movie.  Blessed Art Thou, screened at
the Boston Film Festival, is a Disney movie of sorts, but this ain't no
Little Mermaid.  The only Disney involved here is Tim Disney,
writer/director of this tale of theology, faith, and the sexes.  The
plot alone could make his great uncle Walt thaw out, and this
live-action film as a whole is appealing, gentle, and hopeful, despite
its weaknesses.</P>
<P>At a quiet monastery on a vineyard, Brother Anselm (M.E. Hackett) claims
to have witnessed a true miracle.  He purports to have seen the angel
Gabriel himself descend to Earth and initiate a sort of "connection"
with Anselm, one that Disney smartly keeps vague.  There's further
confusion in that Disney actually shows us the encounter, a strangely
homoerotic visual that might have worked well in a dream sequence in the
Village People's Can't Stop the Music.  Toss in the Brother's
androgynous look, and Blessed Art Thou is an exciting little mystery
right from act one.</P>
<P>The older, superior brothers (played by a crew of character actors led
by Bernard Hill, Captain Smith in Titanic) question Anselm's reports. 
But then Anselm's meeting with Gabriel seems to motivate another, well,
miracle.  Some reviewers have chosen to give this one away, but I do
believe the plot point to be a spoiler, so I won't.  It's enough to say
that it tests the faith of every member of the small order, in one way
or another, and creates infighting within the previously peaceful
monastery.</P>
<P>Disney, working from a story by Rachel Ingalls, does a fine job giving
the narrative its due time to evolve and develop, but the script peters
out where it counts the most -- at the end.  The big finale that we hope
we'll get doesn't have the passion and humility of the rest of the film,
and it wraps too abruptly.</P>
<P>But Disney's first effort (he is credited, by the way, as a contributing
writer to 1988's Oliver and Company) is filled with pleasing details --
that of a monk's life, of the workings of a vineyard, of the
conversations that emerge between two men who have different
interpretations of faith.  That kind of attention makes a small project
like this an entertaining endeavor.  (Perhaps the biggest kick I got out
of a film with such a sweet religious bent was that it was playing two
doors down from The Exorcist.)</P>
<P>The director also works in an editorial of his own, commenting on the
politics of such a place, where a person of free will may join for the
love of God, but is given commands by a higher ranking human.  Visually,
there is a strong connection through Disney's lens between the cell of a
monastery and a prison cell.</P>
<P>But for all the heavy commentary, it's surprising how light and easy
Blessed Art Thou feels.  Depending upon your point-of-view, that could
be a strength or a weakness, but at a minimum, I expected a bit more
punch at the finish.  The film doesn't necessarily demand your 90
minutes in a theater, but, for a thoughtful, eyebrow-raising story, it
works.  You may now return to associating the Disney name with plush
toys.</P>
