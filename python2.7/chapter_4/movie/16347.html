<P>Invite George A. Romero, Sam Raimi and Terry Gilliam over for a night of
Zombies, Bloody Mary's and some great conversation, secretively slip a few
dozen hits of orange-moon-pied acid drops into their respective drinks,
stir, serve on the rocks, and you will only be slightly prepared for the
bloody onslaught of style, horror, annihilation and gruesomely decorated
psychosis that director Peter Jackson has bestowed upon this world in the
form of this film. This movie is essentially for the 90's, what NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD was for the 60's, and EVIL DEAD 2 (7.5/10) was for the 80's. An
all-out disgusting bloody mess of a horror show! All I could say is "wow".</P>
<P>PLOT:
A man who has always lived under the oppression of his own mother, suddenly
finds himself taking care of her, after she gets bitten by a rare rat-monkey
at a local zoo. It turns out that the bite from the animal actually turns
people into flesh-eating human zombies, and so his mother slowly but surely
crumbles into that state herself. As more and more people get bit, the man's
house turns into an absolute slaughterhouse for the dead, the living, and
the undead. Blood, carnage, decapitations, and did I mention blood...ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A fantastic cinematic achievement, this film has the greatest horror special
effects that I have ever witnessed in my entire life. It also has the most
gore, the most guts, the most blood, the most style and the most
mutilations, that I have ever had the privilege to be completely repulsed by
as well. This movie starts off slow, and looks like a highly stylized film
ready to thrill you with its eye for the quaint shot, but sadistically turns
into one of the most disgusting horror movies to ever greet the screen. This
film is gross beyond belief, with bloody murders after bloody murders,
followed closely by bloody decapitations, bloody maimings and dozens of
other novel shots of zombies killing, chomping and gnawing their way into
others.</P>
<P>THIS FILM IS NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED!</P>
<P>This gorefest is filled with shots of body parts being ripped apart from one
another, limbs flying all around, and human insides taking on a life of
their own. Mrs. JoBlo could not take the whole film, and had to be relieved
of her duties as shotgun watcher, as the film progressed with only me
holding a barf bag to my side. I really do not know enough about this film's
background to know of Mr. Jackson's technique in this film's regard, but
suffice it to say that the man does an excellent job of coming up with a
plasma-infested horror spectacle that will not leave anyone lest an opinion.
Timothy Balme also does an excellent job of playing the straight-guy within
this mess of butchered torsos, even as he literally mows through them by the
end. His character was just like Bruce Campbell in EVIL DEAD 2. A chunk of
straight man material, plenty of black humour and a whole lot of
psychological head-trippings. Which reminds me, this film is not meant to be
a straight-forward horror extravaganza. It's got its tongue firmly placed in
cheek with a lot of off-humour pieces as well, like the one that has the
priest kicking some crazy zombie butt in the graveyard, and another one that
features our protagonist taking the baby zombie out for a carriage stroll in
the park.</P>
<P>This film will never leave your mind once you have seen it, and will most
certainly make a sickening impression on you, at first glance. You might
change your mind afterwards and respect its style, wondrous craft of
filmmaking and overall gruesome effect (as I did), or decide that it's one
of the sickest and vile things that you have ever had the indecency to
witness in your entire lifetime as an adult on this planet, and regurgitate
your appetite for ever taking in another horror movie. But even with a
fabricated absence of this film from your memory, you will never be able to
forget the fact that you were one of the lucky ones to have witnessed one of
the bloodiest, sickest and campiest fiestas of murder ever presented on
film!! Trust me, you'll feel better in the morning :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
BRAINDEAD was the original title for this movie, but Vidmark changed it to
DEAD ALIVE.
The mad funeral director's assistant is played by director Peter Jackson
himself. He was born in New Zealand, and also directed 1996's THE
FRIGHTENERS (7/10). He is presently working on all three parts of THE LORD
OF THE RINGS trilogy, which will be shot back-to-back. New Line Cinema has
apparently committed more than $130 million to produce this live action,
special effects-packed trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's
internationally renowned fantasy novel. The filming is scheduled to begin in
May 1999 in New Zealand, with the first episode due for Christmas 2000
release.
Peter Jackson's favorite scene, in which the "baby" is taken for a carriage
ride in the park, was shot on the last two days only, because there was some
money left in the budget. The film apparently only cost $3 million to make,
with the director not making one cut from his original script.
Peter Jackson was one of the first people approached to script the JASON VS
FREDDY movie, but had to decline due to other commitments.
During the lawnmower scene in this movie, blood was pumped at five gallons
per second.</P>
