<PRE>"Nurse Betty" – Not Enough to Fancy
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Betty (adorable Renee Zellweger, who could charm the
Grinch) is a woman who would be better off living any
kind of fantasy.  But the closest she comes to it is
by being an avid watcher of the sudsy "A Reason to
Live," a "General Hospital"-esque soap opera.  She is
so enrapt in its story that not only can she recite
many of its lines, she is moved to become a nurse
herself.  But her bullying, mullet-headed husband
quickly squashes any dreams that she may have.  This
louse of a partner cheats on her behind her back,
never remembers her birthday, and ridicules her for
watching soaps.  "It's only people with no lives that
watch other people's fake lives," he disdainfully
says.  This is the kind of guy that every woman can do
without.</P>
<P>The husband is not only a cheat, but he's also a
thief.  And when he double-crosses one of his business
ties, two hitmen come to town to kill him.  Betty
witnesses this horrible act of violence, and as a
result, slips into a state of dementia.  She enters
her ultimate fantasy by living her life within the
realm of her favorite soap.  She packs her things and
heads off to Southern California in search of the
heartthrob doctor (Greg Kinnear) that heads the cast
of "A Reason to Live" believing that she once jilted
him and now wants to make amends.  She's a mixture of
glee and delusion</P>
<P>This is the part of the story that is the most
farcical and interesting.  Arriving in L.A. in a
nursing uniform that makes her look more like a
Halloween party-goer rather than a functional nurse,
compassion and dumb luck gains her employment at a
local hospital.  She even manages to meet her
fictional doctor.  And when they do, she talks as if
she is on the show.  Instead of laughing at her, the
actor thinks that she is a talented method actress,
projecting a Doris-Day-thing and improvising an
audition.  He is flattered and her fantasy continues.</P>
<P>But all is not heaven for our heroine.  A darker side
to this film emerges as the two hitmen (courtly Morgan
Freeman and Chris Rock, who seems to have his squelch
volume stuck at maximum), try to track her down.  Not
only is Betty a witness to the murder, but the car in
which she has driven contains something that these two
are trying to retrieve.  </P>
<P>"Nurse Betty" thus becomes something of a twisted
Cinderella story.  There is an inventiveness that the
writers achieve in which the magical realism of
Zellwegger's world is countered against the
no-nonsense world of Rock's.  But, the plot lacks the
charisma that is needed to maintain the weekend
moviegoer's attention.  The tone also seemed a bit
unbalanced.  It brims with sweetness when the story
focuses on Betty's fabled world, but the 'hitmen'
angle injects a sour feeling, especially since Rock
curses like it was as involuntary as his breathing
process.  As a whole, the film did have its moments. 
It had some original ideas.  And, it may have won a
writing award at this year's Cannes International Film
Festival.  But it's questionable as to whether this
dark fable will win over your approval.</P>
