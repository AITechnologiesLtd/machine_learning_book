<P>I've always felt that all film "critics" should at least be able to
appreciate the type of movie that they're watching before voicing their
opinion on it. I mean, is any 50-year old man's opinion of this film, which
is obviously geared towards teenage girls, really gonna matter to a 13-year
girl in the target audience? I highly doubt it. So what makes my opinion of
this film any better? (I'm a dude in my late 20s) Well, for starters, I was
sent a nasty little email by a "fan" a few weeks ago, who actually called me
a "teen girl" because I happened to rate GET OVER IT with a higher grade
than his apparent notions of "genius cinema" like HAPPINESS and BEFORE NIGHT
FALLS. Of course, I take every email seriously, so if I'm a "teen girl",
would I like this movie...if I was a teen girl, would I like this movie...if
I was a teen girl...? <dozes off></P>
<P>PLOT:
Based on the popular cartoon series from the Archie Comics, Josie and her
best friends Val and Melody have a musical group called "The Pussycats".
When an evil manager comes to Riverdale to find himself a new hot group, he
hooks up with the Pussycats and makes them one of the more popular bands in
the world within a few weeks. Of course, he's also slapping subliminal
messages into their songs so that the government could mold the minds of the
young, but what else is new, right? :)</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A cute, harmless little movie that will likely be enjoyed by both young boys
and girls, with catchy, bubblegum songs, many clever in-jokes, some lulls,
some misses but an overall sense of fun. This movie tries to do what
CHARLIE'S ANGELS did last year, with bright colors, energetic scenes, lotsa
style, lotsa winkie-wink moments...but for teens! Unfortunately, this movie
only semi-succeeds with too many jokes which try to be funny, but aren't, a
few corny "romance" moments and a way too obvious story line (I know, I
know...that's not why we see movies like this one, but still!). And a lot
like the latter film, this movie knows that it's there just for fun, milking
many a pop culture moment and even making the obvious "pussy" joke during
its opening credits (impressively daring!). There's also the whole TRL
sequence in which Tara Reid's character is going back and forth with Carson
Daly, which is quite hilarious (they are a real-life couple) and even more
fun is paid at the expense of the entire "boy band" phenomenon (go Seth!).
The movie is also quite self-referential, like the one spot in which one of
the characters is asked why she is tagging along with the band and she says,
"Because I was in the comic book".</P>
<P>But the funniest two characters in the whole movie are Melody (Tara Reid)
and the evil manager (Alan Cumming). They both stole every scene in which
they were present, and you couldn't help but enjoy Melody's complete
goofiness. Great performances from both actors! In fact, all three Pussycats
played their characters very well (although Rosario Dawson seemed quite
"big" compared to the others) and made you believe in them. I did however
think the character of Alan M. was completely miscast as a sensitive skinny
dude, as he's always been known as the jockey built guy in the comics (yup,
I still read Archie comics, boys and girls...it's pretty darn sad). But like
I said before, there were also way too many moments in which not much was
happening, or "funniness" was supposed to occur, but it just didn't gel
(like Parker Posey's character, who wasn't as humorous as you'd think). In
the end, the movie is basically just having a lot of fun with itself, so I
don't think anyone seeing it should take it too seriously either. Of course,
that doesn't mean that it's a "good" movie by any means, but if you're in
the mood for mindless, goofy, teen, bubbly fun, than you could do worse. I
guess what I'm saying is basically what Josie said near the end of the film
before her final song (allow me to paraphrase): "If you think it's cool,
great, and if you don't, that's fine, too. But decide on your own."</P>
<P>Did I just quote Josie in my review? Yipes...maybe they really did
subliminally slip some things into this movie <as I crunch right into my Big
Mac and reach for my FIGHT CLUB DVD></P>
