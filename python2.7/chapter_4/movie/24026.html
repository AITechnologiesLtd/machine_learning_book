Susan Granger's review of "ME, MYSELF AND I" (Sony Pictures Classics)</PRE>
<P>Remember the "Sliding Doors" parallel lives concept in which
Gwyneth Paltrow imagined what might have happened if she had not
missed the subway one day? Remember Rachel Griffiths who co-starred
with Emily Watson in "Hilary and Jackie"?  Put them together and you
have this fantasy in which Rachel Griffiths plays Pamela Drury, a
celebrated, award-winning journalist who lives in a lonely, box-filled
apartment in Sydney, Australia, and worries that life may somehow have
passed her by because she didn't marry Mr. Right. She wonders "what
if"....until, suddenly, one day, in an alternate universe, she
magically switches places with her alter ego, Pamela Dickson, who
married her old sweetheart, has three demanding children and lives in
suburbia.  While Pamela Dickson gladly slips out of station-wagon
bondage, Pamela Drury copes with the strenuous, nitty-gritty routine
of the neglected wife and soccer mother she would have become if her
heart had ruled her head.  Australian film-maker Pip Karmel's premise
is reminiscent of the old adage, "Be careful what you wish for because
you may just get it." But it gets a bit clumsy during the transitions
between the two Pamelas, particularly since we never learn enough
about the newly liberated Pamela Dickson. And are we really to believe
that a serious woman with a penchant for investigative journalism
would be totally content writing hackneyed romantic how-to articles
for a women's magazine?  In the final analysis, it's the charismatic
dual performance by Rachel Griffiths that makes this road-not-taken
film memorable. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Me, Myself,
and I" is a poignant, daydreaming 6. It's summed up best by
Ms. Karmel's line, "Regret is futile."</P>
