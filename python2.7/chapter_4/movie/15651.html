Susan Granger's review of "YOU'VE GOT MAIL" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>This hip, contemporary remake of the Ernst Lubitsch comedy "The
Shop Around the Corner," which was based on Miklos Laszlo's
"Parfumerie," stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as two booksellers who fall
in love in the age of e-mail. She runs a small children's bookstore on
New York City's Upper West Side, while he's the scion of a huge
superchain which is putting every independent bookstore out of
business. They both buy groceries at Zabars and pick up coffee at
Starbucks, passing each other on the street, but they've never met. He
lives with a hyperactive book editor (Parker Posey) and she lives with
an erudite newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear). Yet, as they face off
against one another in their professional life, they unwittingly
romance each other, using pseudonyms as they pour out their hearts on
the web. Nora Ephron has cleverly updated the story for the electronic
age, giving the old-fashioned a fresh, new panache. "The Internet
looks infinite," she explains. "But, like a great big city, it's
really a series of villages, full of people who care about similar
things connecting with one another." While Tom Hanks is splendid, his
best bet in the Oscar derby is for "Saving Private Ryan," but isn't it
about time Meg Ryan got an Oscar nomination?  With a captivating
combination of fragility and ferocity, she makes romantic comedy look
so easy. In a supporting role, Jean Stapleton strikes a memory chord
as she sings and plays the piano.  Remember her as Edith Bunker in
TV's "All in the Family," warbling the theme in the opening credits?
On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "You've Got Mail" delivers a
first-class, charming 10. What a sparkling, sweet treat! It's the most
romantic movie of the holiday season.</P>
