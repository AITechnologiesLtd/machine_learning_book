<PRE>IF I WERE A WHITE BOY...</PRE>
<P>      If I were a white boy.  O, if I were a white just-graduated 
middle-class American boy.  All day long I'd diddee-diddle-dum, 
play crosswords, talk in conversations involving the simulated 
quiz-show sound "Ding!", watch washing-powder ads, listen to 
taped ansaphone messages from my girlfriend in Prague, drink 
in townie bars, get laid with freshman-girls, and still look morose.  
I'd re-enrol in college, or maybe I'd back out of graduate school  
because I  couldn't adjust to the one-hour difference in the timezone.  
I'd put my life on hold for years, and then realize this WAS my life. 
And I'd have to put it all on film. </P>
<P>       I could do all of the above, but really the thing is to get a bunch 
of us graduated white boys, and divide up the work.  So let me 
introduce Otis (Carlos Jacott), the ever-embarassable, who has this 
habit of doing vaguely alternative things without the confidence to 
admit to them ("Are you wearing mascara?" "NO!.....[pause]...yes.").  
Then meet Chet (Eric Stoltz),  the everlasting student, prolonging 
his postgraduate education into its dozenth year while moonlighting 
as a bartender.  On the same note (but with hazier motivations), 
there's Skippy (Jason Wiles), re-enrolling in college to take all the 
classes he missed (and also to keep an eye on his flirty undergrad 
girlfriend). As court-jester-cum-prophet-of-gloom we have Max, 
(Christopher Eigeman) an aimless sort with a gift for acid-sharp 
one-liners (on hearing about someone turning seventeen,  "Now 
you'll finally be able to read Seventeen and get all the references.").</P>
<P>                And then there's Grover (not the blue furry superhero-cum-loser, 
but quite possibly inspired by him).  He's the one with the heart troubles, 
paining for his girlfriend who's gone to study in Prague, recalling in 
flashbacks the unfolding stages of their relationship. This is meant to 
be the emotional core of the film, but as played by Josh Hamilton, 
Grover comes across as being both boring and dislikeable. When he drolly 
tells a friend on the phone (within earshot of the girl he's bedding), 
"Sorry, I can't talk now, I have to sleep with a freshman", the director 
probably wants usto empathise with his ennui, but all I can do is wonder 
why that girl even talks to him, rather than doing something far more 
worthwhile likekneeing him in the groin.</P>
<P>       Much better is Olivia D'abo, (remember the sister in 'The Wonder 
Years'?) as his girlfriend,  Jane.  She's got an appealingly awkward 
habit of toying with her tooth-braces, and she has enough intelligence 
and gopher-cheeked charm to make her easily more interesting than 
any of the boys.  That said, though, Chris Eigeman is very good -- 
he's perfected the knowing sarcastic role in films like METROPOLITAN, 
but here hismelancholy and self-deprecation make him more than just 
another smart aleck.  Oddly enough, for all his gloomy humour, he 
seems the least self-pitying and least deluded of the guys.</P>
<P>      This is a movie I should like a lot -- and in some ways I do.  It's got very 
smart and often funny lines, and it paints a sharp picture of a certain 
group of people, a picture that aims to be both satirical and 
sympathetic (and it nearly works).  But I've got problems watching 
this film.  It's not so much a suspension of disbelief that's required 
to enjoy this film, as a suspension of dislike.  One has to put aside one's 
annoyance at these guys' silly habits, their self-absorption, their thinking 
of themselves as so terribly smart and funny and hopelessly doomed in 
that Gen X kindaway .  One must bravely resist the urge to tell them to 
shape up, get a life, get a job, call your bloody girlfriend if you miss her 
so goddam much. Maybe it's because (and not in spite of) my being about 
22 and also freshly graduated : it's close to home, yet it doesn't hit the 
mark, somehow.  Maybe, whatever bits I do identify with,  I don't like that 
bit of myself enough to want to see it on screen. Or maybe if I were a white 
boy, I'd enjoy this film more.  Whatever it is, I still believe this Noah Baumbach 
(a first-time director) has it in him to direct some rather brilliant films.  I 
just think KICKING AND SCREAMING isn't one of them.</P>
