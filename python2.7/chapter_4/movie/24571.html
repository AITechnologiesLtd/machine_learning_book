<P>>From Small Time Crooks' one-sheet, you might think the film is a kids'
movie.  It features a shadowy figure munching on a chocolate-chip
cookie, while the title seems to be a play on words, with the
implication that the `crooks' in question may be diminutive in height.
Relax, pedophobiacs – there isn't a child anywhere in Crooks.</P>
<P>Crooks starts off like a modern-day version of The Honeymooners.  A
dishwashing ex-con named Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) dreams of retiring to
Miami, where he wants only to swim and spend time at the dog track.  One
day, the former stick-up man hatches a plan to rob a Manhattan bank by
renting an abandoned pizza parlor on the same block and tunneling into
the bank's vault.  As Ray sees it, the only thing that stands between
him and his big score is his wife Frenchie (Tracey Ullman, Tracey Takes
On), a derisive manicurist that becomes immediately suspicious when her
husband brings home a box of chocolates before revealing his devious
robbery plans.  When she hesitates, Ray practically sends her to the
moon, Ralph Kramden-style.</P>
<P>Aiding Ray in his attempt to convince Frenchie to go along with his idea
are his two friends and cohorts, Tommy (Tony Darrow, Mickey Blue Eyes)
and Denny (Michael Rapaport, Deep Blue Sea), who are described as being
`so dumb that they never graduated kindergarten because they were
drafted.'  The three would-be criminals need Frenchie for both her
monetary contribution to their scheme, as well as to run the cookie
store that will serve as a front while the men burrow toward the bank
vault.</P>
<P>Of course, the bank heist doesn't go as planned, and the bumbling
burglars instead decide to franchise Sunset Cookies, which has become so
popular that they've hired Frenchie's dimwitted cousin May (Primary
Colors writer Elaine May).  One year later, everyone involved in Sunset
is filthy rich and are even interviewed by 60 Minutes' Steve Kroft in a
particularly funny segment.  All of this takes place in the Crooks first
half-hour.</P>
<P>The remaining hour of Crooks focuses on how money affects the Winklers'
relationship.  Ray despises being rich and longs for his old life back,
while Frenchie dives headfirst into Manhattan's high society, despite
having horrendous taste in both decorating and fashion (in other words,
she turns into Carmella Soprano).  Frenchie, a former stripper, also
hires an art dealer (Hugh Grant, Mickey Blue Eyes) to teach her to how
to become a more proper socialite by escorting her to museums and
performance art shows that Ray wouldn't be caught dead attending.</P>
<P>If there's one thing that Allen can do (besides writing fantastically
original screenplays), it's eliciting great performances from his
actors.  In his last film, Sweet & Lowdown, both principal actors (Sean
Penn and Samantha Morton) received Oscar nods.  Hell, he even made Mira
Sorvino an Oscar winner in Mighty Aphrodite.  And Crooks is no different
- the film features some of the best comedic acting that you will ever
see.  Period.  Crooks is also one of Allen's loudest films, with
cinematographer Fei Zhao perfectly capturing just how loud and gaudy
Frenchie's taste became once she came into money.</P>
<P>Crooks is Allen's thirty-second directorial effort, and the first he's
featured himself in since 1997's Deconstructing Harry.  Since then, the
sixty-four-year-old has appeared in several unbilled cameos (The
Impostors and A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries), provided the voice for
an animated film (Antz) and been the subject of a documentary (Wild Man
Blues).  It's also the second film that the prolific, twenty-time Oscar
nominee has released in the last six months.</P>
