A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>Stephen King is a prolific and sometimes gifted writer, but his track record
with the movies is spotty.  Every now and then, we get an original vision or
an offbeat story to begin with, and the result is really memorable: THE
SHINING, THE DEAD ZONE, STAND BY ME, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION were all
strong and enjoyable.  The rest of them have been by-the-numbers piffle,
like this one.</P>
<P>What's wrong with this movie?  It was lifted more or less intact from his
novel of the same name, and I think that's the source of the problem.  Many
of his novels have become windy, overcooked exhalations to no clear purpose.
Once you get your mind around the basic conceit of the story, the rest is
just a taxi ride.  NEEDFUL THINGS fits squarely into that category.  As a
movie, it's even more insufferable and dessicated than the book it was taken
from.</P>
<P>The story opens up in Castle Rock, another of King's fictional Maine towns
that looks peaceful on the outside but you just know is brimming with
repressed horror.  Ooo.  One day a store that vaguely resembles an antique
store, named "Needful Things", opens shop.  The proprietor is played by Max
von Sydow, who is probably the best thing in the movie, since he is always
enjoyable as someone of diabolical intent.  I'm half expecting a movie
biography of Anton Szandor LaVey with him starring in it, and come to think
of it, that would be far more interesting than anything that happens here.</P>
<P>Never mind.  The store has in its collection of bric-a-brac various items
for which all the members of the town all harbor the deepest desires.  The
proprietor sells them, but he is of course charging the highest possible
price for them: your soul.  There are other developments, too, which involve
the townspeople stabbing each other in the back to curry favor with Satan.</P>
<P>The only person who holds out against the Big Sellout is Ed Harris, playing
a police chief with an ugly past, but soon everyone else in town has
succumbed and it isn't long before the whole place is going up in flames.
God, I'm so sick of a movie's third act where they "solve" everything by
blowing it up.  It didn't work in ZABRISKIE POINT, so why should it work
now?</P>
<P>There's not much variety in the movie, either; it's all horribly
monochromatic and repetitive.  Satan arrives, sets up shop, people fall all
over each other selling out to the devil, mayhem ensues, movie eventually
terminates on a sarcastic note.  When I think about how much money and time
and care goes into making any movie, and I see something like this, my heart
dies a little.</P>
