                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>MANNY & LO *** Written and directed by Lisa Krueger. 
Photography, Tom Krueger.  Editing, Colleen Sharp.  
Production designer, Sharon Lomofsky. Music, John Lurie. 
Producers,  Dean Silvers and Marlen Hecht. Cast:  Mary Kay 
Place (Elaine), Scarlett Johansson (Manny), Aleksa 
Palladino (Lo), Paul Guilfoyle (Humphreys), et al. A Sony 
Classics release. 90 minutes. Rated R (language, short 
sexual scene). </P>
<P>A road movie that's not quite a road movie, "Manny and Lo" 
is named after its two sisters on the lam , Amanda, 
precociously wise at 11, and Laurel, sexually awake at 16, 
orphaned when their (unseen) mother dies. We know little 
about mom except for hints ("Was she stoned or drunk?") 
and nothing of the father. The girls were placed in foster 
homes. Lo escaped from hers, obtained an older car (the 
mother's? Unclear) and "rescued" Manny.</P>
<P>They take to the road, in a purposefully vague (albeit 
contemporary) period, and anonymous locations (New 
Jersey and upstate New York in reality), sleeping in the 
car, or outdoors, or in model houses they break into. They 
steal gas, shoplift food, but never behave aggressively or 
defiantly. </P>
<P>The movie is the feature debut of Lisa Krueger who has an 
interesting background in film, academic in Berkeley and 
Paris, practical, as a Jill-of-all-trades, in New York and 
elsewhere. She made a short, "Best Offer" with brother 
Tom as cinematographer and brother Matthew as 
production designer. It premiered at the 1993 Sundance 
Festival,  won awards in San Francisco, Chicago, 
Oberhausen and other festivals. "Manny and Lo" was 
carefully developed at the Sundance Institute. All this 
means to me that Ms. Krueger goes well beyond the 
casual, new independent filmmaker, that her success with 
"Manny and Lo" is no flash in the pan.  </P>
<P>Funny what thoughts come into a film-buff's mind while 
watching pictures. Manny's narrating of parts of the this 
film recalled, in a different way, the scratchy, working 
class-voiced narration of Linda Manz (whatever became of 
her?) in the masterful "Days of Heaven" (1978)--but the 
resemblances stop there between that spectacular fresco 
and the small budget, essentially three-character "M & L."</P>
<P>There is solid originality in "Manny and Lo," along with a 
quiet way of presenting the girls' quandaries. Manny, 
inside a model home (desirable yet soulless) swipes 
mantelpiece photos of families. This  clear, unspoken wish 
for a normal life may be obvious but  is not pat. Obvious 
too, and on the forced side is when the sisters play, in the 
model house, a rather incongruous home video labeled 
"Welcome to Tiffany" (what is it doing there?), which turns 
out to be the record of a baby's birth. </P>
<P>Lo, who keeps gaining weight and, with bad faith,  blames 
it on junk food, is in a state of advanced pregnancy. This 
leads the sisters to an illogical but eloquent visit to a 
maternity store. The temporary salesperson, Elaine, is a 
weird, authoritarian, know-it-all,  "I'm never wrong," 
figure full of advice on everything. The girls abduct her to 
an empty vacation cabin and shackle her. Why? Because, 
mixed up and lost, they need help with the pregnancy. </P>
<P>While it is obvious that the pregnancy is most unwelcome 
by Lo, in one of the film's major and better ambiguities 
this "I'm my own boss" young lady, while putting up a 
strong front, is badly in need of a mother figure. Confused, 
she doesn't seem to know which evil is the lesser, having 
the baby or aborting it. </P>
<P>Elaine gradually supplies the missing link, the maternal 
presence. Her odd  personality hides a mysterious past, 
her authoritative character hides her own insecurities and 
wounds. Mary Kay Place regularly steals the show. Now as 
a prisoner who goes on hunger strikes, now wobbling on 
her tied up feet, preparing healthy meals for the trio, 
serving...  The girls may think she is a real nurse, but is 
she, or does she have the experience without the title? </P>
<P>Elaine goes through small but significant changes, ever 
forceful but never transformed into a sentimental or 
overtly appealing movie cliche.  </P>
<P>Complicitous bonding between Elaine and Manny forms 
gradually, sometimes amusingly, sometimes with 
restrained pathos. It will expand quite late into rapport 
between ever-suspicious Lo and kooky Elaine. The 
climaxes is not so much a closure as a condition curative 
for all concerned. </P>
<P>I will not get into the details, whose accumulation makes 
up the movie. Some miniature episodes seem throw-away, 
irrelevant. Some red herrings are included--at one point, 
late in the film, a visitor and his car even conjured up 
"Psycho" for me. Even so, the parts fit well together, their 
mix of semi-violence and semi-sweetness has a 
consistent tone of a musical scale in a minor key. </P>
<P>In this not-so-hidden but cool paean to maternity, family, 
roots and women supporting one another, it is the three 
characters' characterizations that carry the load. The 
dialogue is not especially interesting, arguments and 
dialectics are noticeably absent. But it is precisely this 
combination of what is done and what is unspoken that 
gives the film a look and feel all its own. </P>
<P>No minor virtues are the good music by John Lurie and the 
picture's length. Its hour-and-a-half qualifies it for 
inclusion in the Golden Book of the famous BBNMM Society, 
"Bring Back the Ninety Minute Movie."</P>
