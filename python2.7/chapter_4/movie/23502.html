<P>   Those who take in "8-1/2 Women" as their introduction to
Peter Greenaway's vision would likely that the picture is far-
out, different, novel.  Indeed it is.  But the old Greenaway
hands can't be blamed for feeling that the fifty-seven-year old
Welsh director is losing his experimental edge.  Put "8-1/2
Women" side by side with such daring pictures as his "Pillow
Book," "Drowning by Numbers" and in my conviction his best
work "The Draughtsman's Contract" and the film evokes no
such probing or even visual splendor.  "The Draughtsman's
Contract," for example, which came out of Greenaway's more
youthful mind, deals with an arrogant young artist who takes
commissions from the mistress of an estate in return for
sexual favors--not unlike his current movie, by the way--but
the 1982 movie was delightfully inflected by its 17th Century
spirit and looks more sumptuous than "8-1/2 Women." 
Greenaway made history in the U.S. when his "The Cook,
The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover" (1989)--a parable about
love, revenge and greed--made the Motion Picture Academy
change its concept of rating movies, eliminating the "X" rating
in favor of the current "NC-17."</P>
<P>   Thematically, Greenaway has always been obsessed by
humankind's avarice, sexual fantasies, and revenge, while
visually his movies tend to be distant, cold, and aloof with a
strong emphasis on visual splendor over narrative
conventions.  Leaving much of narrative to the printed page,
Greenaway believes that cinema is first, last and always for
the eye, with story lines taking a back seat.  But "8-1/2
Women," oddly enough, follows conventional story lines from 
A to Z without the challenging experimentation of his previous
offerings.  This time he singles out the idle rich for his satiric
barbs, honing in on a father-son duo who have the most
stereotypical views of women, who exploit them when they
are weakest, and who get their deserved comeuppance in the
end.  That's about as conventional as you can get with
Greenaway.</P>
<P>   What sets the story in motion is the grieving of a
prosperous Geneva banker, Phil Emmenthal (John Standing)
after the death of his wife and the efforts of his son, Storey
Emmenthal (Matthew Delamere) to perk his old man up. 
When the two inherit pachinko (gambling) parlors in Kyoto,
Japan, they may have intended to run them strictly for the
profits that would come from the Japanese fascination with
gambling.  But after seeing Fellini's 1963 movie "8-1/2"
illustrating its self-analytical filmmaker's utilization of women
for his new project, Matthew conceives of a way to cheer up
his grieving dad.  Letting their fantasies run reckless, father
and son commit incest with each other and then turn their
Geneva estate into a bordello.  To serve them, they employ
eight women plus one additional female who has no legs.
The harem include Kito (Vivian Wu), who turns on when she
sees male-female impersonates; Giaconda (Natacha Amal),
who has had six children and will produce another for the
bankers in return for $25,000; Beryl (Amanda Plummer), who
steals horses and fears extradition to Saudi Arabia where she
could receive harsh punishment; Griselda (Toni Collette), who
is pushed into portraying a nun; Palmira (Polly Walker), a
beautiful hooker with the heart of gold.  </P>
<P>   Filmed exquisitely in Japan and Luxembourg by
Greenaway's regular photographer Sacha Vierny, "8-1/2
Women" graphically demonstrates--with liberal use of both
male and female frontal nudity--that the sexual fantasies of
the men soon become banal to them and that the women
ultimately gain the upper hand with fancies of their own.  To
illustrate the vapid, stereotypical views of women held by the
Emmenthals, Greenaway populates the screen with females 
representing the usual clich‚s.  The bankers run through an
earth mother, the eternally pregnant woman, the thief, the
fainthearted, the heart-of-gold whore, the nun-at-heart, and
the servant; the only creature engaging them when the sex
becomes routine being Palmira--who has no use for "unused"
youth, goes after the older man, and evokes the envy and
frustration of young Storey.  John Standing and Matthew
Delamere do make a convincing father-son team, the son's
ultimately disastrous advice assuring us that the scheme,
however unusual, is credible enough.</P>
<P>   To embody his view that painting represents the best
means of contemplating the world, Greenaway calls upon
some of the great works of art in formulating his women. 
Mother Earth is found in the works of della Francesca,
Rubens and Picasso while the chaste nun has been painted
by Rembrandt and fantasied by de Sade.  The good-looking,
sympathetic whore has been the subject of fantasies from
Mary Magdalene to Marilyn Monroe.</P>
<P>   The vision is there, all right.  What is lacking are a deeper
exploration of the connection between the paintings and this
picture and a truly experimental style to cast Greenaway's
bold notion into a more innovative style--a technique that
could have a better chance of capturing audience awe.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 120 minutes.  (C) 2000
