<PRE>Reviewed by David Gardiner</PRE>
<P>It's 1940 on the western seaboard of the continent of Europe. The retreating
British army is driven back to the sea on the beaches of Dunkirk, and makes
good its escape back to England carried by a makeshift fleet of sea-going
pleasurecraft and small boats that previously carried parties of
holidaymakers up and down the Thames or over and back to the Isle of Wight.
But his time the advancing German army does not stop at the coast.....</P>
<P>The premise of this most unusual war film is that Britain was invaded and
occupied after the Dunkirk retreat, and in a mixture of documentary and
narrative styles it sets out to tell the story of the occupation that the
country narrowly (some would say, unaccountably) escaped, up to and
including the 'liberation', orchestrated by the efforts of local partisans
with American assistance, in the war's closing year.</P>
<P>This is a low-key, reflective war drama, which follows its central
character, an Irish-born district nurse working in a village near Salisbury,
through the horrors of a partisan ambush that goes wrong, to a chilling
Nazi-dominated vision of London, where she finds herself assimilated into
the highly political "Immediate Action Organization" and receives her
"political re-education", on to a rural medical centre specialising in
euthenasia for "undesirables", through to the final chilling irony of
"liberation" and the wholesale slaughter of "collaborators".</P>
<P>It is hard to believe that this film began its life as the spare-time
project of 18-year-old Kevin Brownlow, a film enthusiast working in the
cutting-room of a small London production company, and his 16-year-old
schoolboy friend Andrew Mollo, who had a passion for military history and a
collection of old German uniforms and regalia. Starting without a budget,
using a borrowed 16 mm camera, the two doggedly pursued their dream of
completing the project for almost eight years, finding actors, actresses,
sets and backing as they went along. The incredible story of the film's
birth is told in Kevin Brownlow's 1968 book "How It Happened Here"
(Doubleday & Co., New York), now unfortunately out of print.</P>
<P>The most famous sequence in the work is a six-minute scene in which genuine
Neo-Nazis expound their ideas. When the film was first previewed at various
British film festivals, it was this scene that incurred the wrath of a
number of Jewish organizations, who mantained that the film lacked balance
in that no substantial counter-argument was presented to the opinions
expressed by these monsters. Early performances were greeted by jeers,
chants of "shame" and mass walk-outs from film theatres.</P>
<P>Kevin Brownlow maintained throughout that the Neo-Nazis condemned themselves
out of their own mouths for anyone with an ounce of intelligence, but the
topic was too hot to handle and in order to get the film accepted for
distribution by United Artists the Directors had to agree to the removal of
the sequence, which was not allowed back into the British release version
until the distribution rights were taken over by Connoisseur in 1993. The
Connoisseur video version of that date is a full, uncut transcription.</P>
<P>As well as the Jews, many others were offended by the film, and it was
widely criticized on political grounds, as being deeply unpatriotic. The
British public had been flattered by Churchillian rhetoric into believing
itself exempt from the flaws of other national groups. A people who had
become accustomed to declairing: "Thank you, Lord, that I am not as other
men!" was being tapped in the shoulder and told: "Sorry, my friend, you are
no different".  There could be no more subversive artistic act than an
attack on this smug self-image.
Every individual and every group that the film portrays is tainted in some
way with moral compromise. We are presented with an England peopled by cowed
and unthinking conformists who just want to "get the country back on its
feet"; fanatical resistance fighters who have no concern for the fate of
ordinary people caught in the cross-fire; German soldiers who casually
murder unarmed civilians, smile sheepishly, and continue on their way;
American "forces of liberation" who do the same to groups of so-called
collaborators as they carry out a scorched-earth de-Natzification policy of
the newly "liberated" territory; mild-mannered old country doctors in
genteel rural hospitals who calmly dispatch their patients with lethal
injections before making their way downstairs for supper. Every incident
portrayed is based on well-documented events that took place in other
occupied countries.
Nobody is spared in Brownlow's profoundly pacifist analysis of the military
mind-set. War and military occupation are presented as pits of horror and
despair that are without bottom. Ordinary, well-meaning people like Pauline
Murray are swept along by forces far beyond their control into dark
political whirkpools from which there is no escape. This is a chilling
nightmare of a film that demands of every viewer that they ask themselves
the question: What would I have done?</P>
<P>The ideas put forward in "It Happened Here" are so riveting even for a
modern audience that it tends to be discussed mainly as a socio-political
treatise and neglected as a film. And looked-at as a film, it undoubtedly
has its faults. The acting, as one would expect from a group of amateurs, is
uneven. Pauline Murray (who is very cleverly allowed to retain her own name
in the film) was the wife of a doctor friend of the two Directors: she had
never acted before. We  see her technique develop as the story progresses
(it was filmed more or less in sequence) and it is a process which, no doubt
unintentionally, actually adds to the strength of the film. The story seems
to emerge out of a naive daydream into something increasingly realistic and
dreadful.</P>
<P>The film's mixture of documentary and narrative style, somewhat reminiscent
of Citizen Kane, was an ambitious and thoroughly appropriate format,
surperbly well-realized with the help of such genuine news-reel voice-over
artists as Alvar Liddell and John Snagge (who gave their services free). The
staged "archive footage" of the Flanders Field Christmas Day football match
would do credit to any professional production company, as would the use of
rousing military music to establish and maintain atmosphere. Brownlow's
skill in carrying us along with his appalling fantasy is rooted in his
commitment to the project: we see German tanks everywhere when we know in
our heart of hearts that Kevin was only able to get hold of one, because
this is the world that we have agreed to enter into. There is no real
interest in looking for the seams and the improvisations. We are involved in
the realization of a nightmare. It is the spirit and the atmosphere of the
piece that seize hold of us, not the limitations of the production budget.</P>
<P>I found this film disturbing, unsettling, unfogettable. The scale of the
achievement involved in the creation of a work of this quality from such
humble beginnings can hardly be overstated. I sincerely hope that you may
get the opportunity to see it, because it is, I know, something of a rarity.</P>
