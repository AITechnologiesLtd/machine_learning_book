<P>"Kadosh," a hard-hitting feminist polemic, revolves around the tangled
sexual politics of three men and two women in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish
sect in Jerusalem.</P>
<P>Meir, a Talmudic scholar, and his wife Rivka have been married for ten
years but have not been able to produce children, no matter how many
prayers are recited or how many ritual baths Rivka takes to rid
herself of "uncleanness." In the opening scene, Meir rises from his
bed and goes through an elaborate series of prayers culminating in
thanks to the Almighty that he was not born a female. The prayers are
conducted while he wraps the leather thongs of the 'tfilin' around his
arm, which altogether gives the appearance of a junky preparing for a
fix. Instead of searching for a vein, Meir seems intent on mainlining
God.</P>
<P>Rivka's younger sister Malka is in love with Jacov, but can not marry
him. He has joined the Israeli army in defiance of the sect's ban on
serving in the military. He is still deeply religious but is regarded
as a renegade by the rest of the sect, who view any departure from the
rigid code of conduct as evidence of godlessness.</P>
<P>Symbolizing this rigidity in the most dramatic fashion is Yossef, who
attends the same Talmud school as Meir. When we first see the two men
together, they launch into an extended disputation over whether it is
more observant to put sugar into hot water when making tea on the
Sabbath or vice versa. It turns out that the water should be poured
over the tea and the sugar so as to preclude the possibility that the
act amounts to cooking. Yossef is the sect firebrand and drives around
in sound-truck during the week urging Jews to "close ranks" against
their godless enemies, which includes both turncoats like Jacov and
all Arabs.</P>
<P>Their rabbi has instructed Malka to break off with Jacov and marry
Yossef. In a truly riveting but repulsive scene, Malka and Yossef are
shown in bed on their wedding night. He first reads a prayer that is
supposed to heighten the chances of procreation and then coldly
instructs Malka to spread her legs. Without any foreplay, he mounts
her like a ram and thrusts violently until he has climaxed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the rabbi has also instructed Meir to end his marriage with
Rivka. The fact that she has not been able to conceive is regarded as
a sin by the close-knit community and it is time for him to live up to
his responsibility as a Jew. In their world, men are brought into the
world to study the Talmud and women are there to support them. This
means first of all procreating and secondly to cook and to keep the
house clean.</P>
<P>Regarded by Time Magazine critic Richard Corliss as the greatest film
ever made in Israel, "Kadosh" is director Amos Gitai's attempt to come
to terms with what many secular Jews in Israel regard as a threat to
their existence. The ultra-Orthodox Jews are a tightly-organized
political faction that pressures Israel from the right. From the
standpoint of Gitai, a left-wing Jew whose grandparents came to
Palestine in the early part of the century as Labor Zionists, their
orthodox cousins are an uncomfortable reminder of where they came
from. While tokens of a backward and insular past are considered
hindrances to civil society in the Israeli present, the more important
question that the film-maker and most secular Jews are not prepared to
confront revolves around their future. In truth it is very likely that
within 25 years the only "true", i.e. observant, Jews will be the
ultra-Orthodox.</P>
<P>The ultra-Orthodox sects, also known as the Hasidim, originated in
18th and 19th century Poland and Russia in a time of great economic
stress and persecution. Marxist historian Ilan Halevi explains their
origins in his "Question Juive":</P>
<P>"The internal crisis of the Shtetl, whose roots are to be found in the
crisis of Polish feudalism, was exacerbated and radically aggravated.
The domain of Polish sovereignty was shrinking rapidly. A kingdom that
had stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea grew smaller and
smaller as around it tsarist Russia, the Hapsburg empire and the
German states grew larger and larger. The Polish question became the
European question and centuries-old Polish Jewry saw its territory
carved up among several states Austria, which took Galicia, lightened
the conditions of Jews there: but Russia, having seized the Ukraine
and Byelorussia, oppressed them there, said Lenin, 'more harshly than
the Negroes'. The Napoleonic conquest, short as it may have been,
precipitated the disintegration, inducing a general upheaval in the
empires of the centre and east. Following the French occupation, the
whole map of the region was transformed. The new frontier of Austria
and Russia, which shared the whole of what remained of Poland in 1815,
cut the Ashkenazi world in two, divided the dynasties of Hasidic
rabbis, and determined new sub-problematics. The sociological unity of
Ashkenazi Judaism was beginning to fracture."</P>
<P>Against this pattern of disintegration, the Hasidic rabbis created
cults based on three key elements that were supposed to function as
life-rafts:</P>
<P>--Strict observance of rituals, particularly those involved with
"cleanness"</P>
<P>--Reverence for the rabbi, who in most instances were seen as a
potential Messiah</P>
<P>--Fervent recitation of prayers, dancing and singing meant to induce
mystical states</P>
<P>For some secular Jews, and even some non-Jews, this last element has
served to bring them into the fold. For instance, Bob Dylan drew close
to the Lubavitcher Hasidic sect in the 1980s. He swapped these beliefs
for Christian fundamentalism not too soon afterwards.</P>
<P>The Lubavitcher sect occupies a place in NYC politics not unlike the
sect depicted in "Kadosh" with the blacks of Brooklyn standing in for
the unfortunate Arabs. The Lubavitchers have used political clout to
gain preferential treatment to gain access to subsidized housing in a
neighborhood where it is in short supply. Such tensions provided the
backdrop for the riots that broke out during the Dinkins
administration when the lead car of a Hasidic caravan struck and
killed a black child. A Hasidic scholar Yankel Rosenbaum, identical to
the film's characters, was stabbed during the violence and Dinkins was
blamed for his death. The Hasidic community then delivered their votes
to the "law-and-order" candidate Rudy Giuliani who has done everything
possible to intimidate the black community, just the way that the
current Labor government in Israel is using every means at its
disposal to intimidate Arabs.</P>
<P>The contradictions of late capitalism are acting on worldwide Jewry in
a manner that few Marxists--in my opinion--have fully understood.
Social and economic processes are in motion that tend to create three
distinct "peoples". One is the ultra-Orthodox sect depicted in the
film. The second is the Israeli "Sabras", the native-born, largely
secular, Jews who retain many of the values of any colonizing people
like the Afrikaners. The third are the largely assimilated and secular
Jews outside Israel who in a generation or two will retain nothing
distinctly Jewish except perhaps their family name. The unique racial
politics of worldwide Jewry will be forced to define itself in terms
of how these various groups relate to worldwide capitalism and the
oppressed Arab and Palestinian peoples. Political polarization will
generate at least in some cases a radical response that the film
"Kadosh" hints at. It is a positive sign that the film criticizes some
of the most backward elements of Israel society and at least points
the way toward a deepening critique of that society, including its
secular but racist elements. </P>
