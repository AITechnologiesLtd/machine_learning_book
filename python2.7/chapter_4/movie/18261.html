<PRE>PLUNKETT AND MACLEANE (M).  
(Polygram)
Director: Jake Scott
Stars: Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Liv Tyler, Ken Stott, Michael 
Gambon, Alan Cumming, Michael 
Culkin.</PRE>
<P>When two 18th century highwaymen start plundering their way
through London's upper class the first victim is historical accuracy,
which seems to have been sacrificed in order to make this period yarn
more appealing to a youthful audience.  The script takes many
liberties with the facts, while debut director Jake Scott (son of
famed director Ridley) deliberately adds a number of contemporary
trappings, including prolific swearing, some raunchy sex, generous
dollops of violence, and a heavily techno- influenced music score from
composer Craig Armstrong.</P>
<P>Plunkett And Macleane reunites Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee
Miller, two of the stars of Trainspotting, who play the highway
robbers with an energy and humour that lifts the material.  Carlyle
seems to be enjoying himself immensely here as Will Plunkett, a
notorious thief and crude outsider.  He reluctantly joins forces with
Captain James Macleane (Miller), a disgraced soldier, when they both
end up in prison.  Plunkett convinces the well-connected Macleane to
use his charms to gain entry into the homes of London's wealthy and
check for potential victims.  As their crime wave increases, pressure
mounts on the sadistic chief law enforcement official Chance (a
suitably menacing and grim Ken Stott) to bring the pair to justice.</P>
<P>Liv Tyler may as well have phoned in her lines for all the
impact she has on the film, trapped in a rather thankless role as the
beautiful young Lady Rebecca, who falls for the handsome Macleane.</P>
<P>Scott brings plenty of energy to his first feature film, and
Plunkett And Macleane maintains a reasonably cracking pace for much of
its length.  He gives the film a flashy visual style and a slick
surface, that betrays his background in advertising and rock video
clips.  The tyro film maker shows that he has learnt a lot of his
father's visual tricks and flair, but little of his meticulous eye for
accuracy or period detail.</P>
<P>The production design is quite impressive, with Prague
doubling for dingy 18th century London.  But the film has primarily
been shot in dark tones by John Mathieson, who prefers to use the sort
of natural lighting that seems to have become popular in many modern
movies.
 It may emphasise the shadowy mists and fogs of London, but it also
makes it hard to discern what is happening, and strains the eyes.
Plunkett And Macleane is ultimately let down by an overall superficial
quality that suffuses the production.</P>
<P>This should have been a jolly old romp through the decadence,
debauchery and corruption of Georgian England in the company of a pair
of likeable thieves.  Instead it turns into something of a misguided
and disappointing mess, and its contemporary touches jar.
