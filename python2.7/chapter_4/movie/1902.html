<P>IN A NUTSHELL: quirky, endearing comedy about a young boy in 1954's
Tito-ruled Yugoslavia.  Unable to cope with his extended dysfunctional
family and cramped quarters, he spends more and more time in a fantasy
world where Tito is the benign father figure.  This causes humorous
fiction in his dissident family (a little like 60's activists having a
child turn Republican.) The break-down of a party-line teacher's
control over a summer camp hike resembles the crumbling of Yugoslavia
itself.  The lead child actor occasionally gets on your nerves, as does
the repetitious soundtrack, but worth seeing.  Probably better at a
theatre than on video.</P>
<P>     The film is a clever combination of filmed action spliced with
high camp Tito newsreels, melded to a zany mambo soundtrack.  Young
Zoran is overweight, and an outcast with most of his family and school
mates.  He retreats further and further from reality, seeing Tito as a
romantic idol.  He stuns his school by winning the essay contest that
will have him go on a "young pioneer" camp/march and meet the Dictator
himself.  The film follows the giddy path that eventually confronts
young Zoran with his idol, clay feet and all.</P>
<P>     A smug, dyed in the wool Commie teacher takes out his own sense of
powerlessness on the hapless youth.  Many viewers will share my
observation that this Commie teacher is remarkably like the "my country
right or wrong" Republicans that  many baby boomers had as teachers in
grammar and high school.  (Back in the 60's I had a high school English
teacher who gave us our "party-approved" reading assignment, "The
Bloody Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh" ... from Reader's Digest! ...  Welcome
to California.)  Apparently it's a universal phenomenon for failures in
the job market, with thwarted ambitions to end up the keepers of our
children's minds.  This teacher resembles a scruffy Tom Selleck, with
all the charm of a J. Edgar Hoover.</P>
<P>     Amusing sidelights are cast by Zoran's "artist" parents (a
musician dad who ends up playing sax in seedy night clubs, and his
jealous/possessive ballerina mother who grates the holier than though
live-in sister-in-law.)</P>
<P>     A great film to brighten up the next rainy Sunday afternoon.
Check it out.  The ending may be a bit syrupy (shades of KARATE KID)
but the film is full of heart and good belly laughs.</P>
