[film] "Virus"
A Postview, copyright 1999 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>Taking a leaf from the Daleks' book, a sentient informational lifeform
tries to invade Earth. Fortunately, it is defeated by Jamie-Lee Curtis
and one of the lesser Baldwin brothers. Unfortunately, it is defeated by
Jamie-Lee Curtis and one of the lesser Baldwin brothers.</P>
<P>It happens every year, regular as clockwork. No one knows why. They dash
unthinkingly towards their doom, the horde sweeping over the edge into
the abyss. Perhaps it is the rhythm of nature. Perhaps it is something
primal. But every year, a film crew tries to remake "Alien".</P>
<P>There are minor differences of course. Sometimes the monster is a robot,
sometimes a mutant. Sometimes the victims are trapped in the arctic,
sometimes in a city. And sometimes they are a bunch of schmucks stuck on
a Russian freighter in the middle of the Pacific. </P>
<P>Of course trawling the depths of such suckiness can sometimes be
tremendously entertaining, such as the loopily wet "Leviathan", the
colourful "Hardware", the demented "DeepStar Six". But connoisseurs of
crap can be tragically let down when something doesn't suck as much as
it nearly does. And let's face it: Jamie-Lee Curtis in a sou'wester is
no ones idea of fun.</P>
<P>For those of you that didn't catch "Virus" at the cinema (which from the
box office figures is - well - everybody), the story goes like this: the
crew of the "Minnow" are in trouble. Their cargo barge is taking water.
Their ship is running into a hurricane. And their skipper is Donald
Sutherland. The uninsured cargo barge sinks and Donald retreats to his
cabin, to clutch a pistol and gaze at a photo taken during his youth.
"I've let you down, boy," he sighs. If you weren't watching closely, you
might think he was talking in character. But Gilligan (Curtis) spots a
disabled Russian freighter and they board, hoping to make a mint in
salvage. Unbeknownst to them, a huge cloud of static electricity has
drifted across space, zapped Mir, telneted down to the ship and is
looking for more copies of Microsoft Office to infect. Unbeknowst that
is, until they find the sole demented Russian survivor for some quick
plot exposition.  (Courtesy of Joanna Pacula, whose chief qualifications
for playing a Russian scientist seem to be the fact she has short hair
and a funny surname.) See, it _is_ just like "Gilligan's Island". </P>
<P>Let me cut to the chase: it's lucky the "Minnow" has such a fearless
(and large) crew because they die one by one or get turned into
bio-mechanical killing machines. Ginger is left alone in the critically
important generator room and just like the dizzy-headed movie star he
is, goes to investigate a noise and is strangled by a powercable. The
Howells and Maryanne split up and blunder around alone in the ships dark
corridors until they get eaten. The Professor rigs up a complicated
device so he can escape the ship. Of course, it's a long standing law of
trashy monster films that characters die in order of increasing
socio-economic standing. The Professor, being the token black, is thus
doomed never to see the end of the film. But for those who like to keep
their finger on the pulse of popular culture, it's a hopeful sign of
progress that he dies after the alcoholic, the Cuban and the redneck.
(And after the Maori, who has a Sydney accent.) My, what a long way
we've come. And true to 20 years of playing twitchy villains that betray
everyone, Donald Sutherland betrays everyone. Tragically, Jamie-Lee is
half-drowned, burnt and soaked with petrol but just refuses to take her
clothes off. Damn.</P>
<P>Oh, there's some nice Harryhausen style effects as robots chase
Jamie-Lee and Baldwin X around the ship, but it's largely just a dull
routine affair, not even bad enough to be good. I'm sure that the rights
have been sold and in a few years we'll see a cheapie sequel starring a
different Baldwin brother. [*/misfire] and a nagging chest cold on the
Sid & Nancy scale.</P>
