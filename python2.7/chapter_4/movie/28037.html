<P>   When Harriet Beecher Stowe, the diminutive author of
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," was introduced to President Abraham
Lincoln, the first words from Lincoln's mouth were, "So you're
the little woman who started this big war!"  The pen can
indeed be mightier than the sword.  If we go along with
scripters Andrew Davies, John Le Carre and director John
Boorman's often humorous interpretation of John Le Carre's
novel, a tailor who learned his trade in prison could have led
the U.S. into a war with Panama in 1999.  "The Tailor of
Panama" is one of two movies opening within a week of each
other (along with "Blow") that will be of particular interest to
one segment of the movie-going population while
disappointing another.  If "Blow" is an urbane biopic about a
major drug lord responsible for the majority of cocaine that
came into the U.S. in the 1970s and not an updated version
of "Scarface" as some might expect, then "Tailor," while
featuring a womanizing James-Bond sort of feller, is more for
lovers of chess matches than video games.  An ultra-
sophisticated, sardonic spy story in the tradition one of the
genre's most famous novelists, "The Tailor of Panama" is
loaded with ironies and twists and enough surprises to keep
even the most passionate fans of the species on their toes.</P>
<P>   Featuring Philippe Rousselot's lavish, widescreen lensing of
the Panama Canal and the capital city of that Central
American nation--which captures the free-spirited people of
that ravishing, hot, sulty and diverse expanse--"The Tailor of
Panama" is the story of a bizarre friendship of convenience
between a burned-out, forty-five-year old spy about to turn in
his cloak and dagger and retire when he is given a final
warning.  Having been caught in a compromising position
with the wife of a European ambassador, Andy Osnard
(Pierce Brosnan) is relieved of his assignment in London and
sent to the backwater post of Panama to finish out his career
and to unearth information about the future of the Panama
Canal.  A rumor is circulating that Panama's president is
considering the sale of the waterway from which the U.S.
retreated in 1999 and that the vital conduit could pass into
the hands of enemies of Britain and the United States.  </P>
<P>   Being the sort of chap who would rather swing in
hammocks and swing in more active ways than do any dirty work
himself, Osnard hires his own spy, a subcontracting job if you
will, playing up to a man he believes can give him the
information he needs.  That would-be informant is the title
figure, Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), a high-class tailor to
the bankers, lawyers, and other movers and shakers right up
Panama's president, and what's more his wife Louisa (Jamie
Lee Curtis) is the administrative assistant to the canal's
director.  If the tailor cannot provide juicy details, no one else
can.  Luring Pendel into the conspiracy with envelopes
loaded with cash, Osnard is pleased to learn from the tailor
that a dangerous deal is indeed going down for the sale of
the canal and that the whole operation, which could spell
disaster for the West, could be halted if a leader of Panama's
resistance movement known as the Silent Opposition can be
financed to wage an insurgency.  Osnard and Pendel are
more interested in skimming some big bucks for themselves
than in getting reasonable proof of Panama's course of
action.  They would as soon put a phony spin on frail
evidence even if their testimony leads to an international
cause celebre.</P>
<P>   While "The Tailor of Panama" is fiction, the story makes
one think of just how unfair the foreign policies of
superpowers could be.  For example, when President Clinton
ordered the bombing of an alleged weapons-making plant in
the Sudan, was his information accurate or was the bombed-
out works just a legitimate pharmaceutical operation as the
Sudanese claim?  And was the Bay of Tonkin Resolution
which led to an escalation of the war in Vietnam based on
appropriate details about the plans of the Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese to expand their influence even beyond their
own borders?</P>
<P>   Our doubts about our own state department are evoked
when things turn out seldom what they seem in the lush land
whose travel posters once used the tagline, "So romantic that
even the oceans get together."  Osnard himself, however, is
not exactly a romantic, but a cynical soon-to-retire snoop who
is so certain of his looks and charm that he boldly seduces
women, even those who appear as difficult as Francesca
(Catherine McCormack), the ice princess administrator
working out of the British Embassy in Panama City.  Told by
an expected conquest, Harry Pendel's wife Louisa, that he is
a wicked man, Osnard coolly responds, "That's part of the
appeal, isn't it?"  Brosnan is Bond, but an evil one this time
around and Geoffrey Rush, who can play an emotionally
disturbed concert pianist with the same fortissimo as he can
a sadistic inmate in a French asylum, is magnificent as a
sewer of tall tales who under stress gets visions of his
departed Uncle Ben (Harold Pinter).  </P>
<P>  The entire ensemble pulls off this complex tale of intrigue
will alacrity, including Brendan Gleeson (who was the title
character of John Boorman's masterful "The General") and 
Jamie Lee Curtis as the suspicious wife of Panama's most
accomplished but prevaricating tailor.  Watch especially for
the scene in a gay bar highlighting a dance in which Osnard
leads Pendel to the tune, "Let's Face the Music and Dance."</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
