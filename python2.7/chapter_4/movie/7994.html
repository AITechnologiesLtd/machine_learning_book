<PRE>                        THE PEBBLE AND THE PENGUIN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     So what does it take to make a good movie for children?  An
intelligent and funny script?  Fully developed and believable
characters?  A truly sinister villain?  A compelling story?  Yes, all
of those and more.</P>
<P>     If these seem similar to the requirements for a more adult film,
they are.  The only differences, to the extent that there are any, are
the choice of subject matter and the limitations on activities (sex,
violence, profanity, ...) that are not appropriate for youngsters.</P>
<P>     The 1994 film THE PEBBLE AND THE PENGUIN, directed by Don Bluth
and Gary Goldman, fails by just about any measure.  My son Jeffrey, age
8, and I saw it in the theater in one of those summer morning
children's films series.  Our fairly full audience of kids had a severe
case of the fidgets, and who can blame them.</P>
<P>     The movie opens and closes with exceedingly bland musical numbers
set to Barry Manilow tunes.  Perhaps with handsomer animation, the
numbers might have been tolerable.  But the flat colors and
unattractive drawings of this movie are never involving.  Although
there is one colorful scene set in the tropics, most of the drawings
look as if they were quickly slapped together without regard to
quality.  While Disney movies are careful to get the animal motions
right, the animals in this cheap imitation have predominately human
mannerisms.</P>
<P>     The shy hero of the story is a penguin named Hubie (voice by
Martin Short).  Rocko (voice by James Belushi) is his supposedly
comical sidekick.</P>
<P>     The story has Hubie wanting to give his pebble (think ring) to his
timid and completely helpless girlfriend Marina (voice by Annie
Golden).  The penguin bad guy, drawn so poorly that I had to ask my son
to stop complaining about it, is a dark skinned villain named Drake
(Tim Curry).  I am surprised they did not have a black hat on him.</P>
<P>     The other villain is "man," and our heroes spend some time trapped
in the hold of the ship "Misery."  (The only funny joke in the film has
Hubie and Rocko in a skiff pulled by a big boat.  The big boat is named
Homeward Bound and the little one is called Homeward Bound II.  You
savor any small pleasures you can find in this movie.)</P>
<P>     Some funny one-liners sure would have been appreciated.  Instead
we get a stream of pointless dialog and some unfunny jokes worthy of a
third rate vaudeville routine.  ("What do you call a flower before it
opens," asks Hubie?  "A bud?" answers Rocko.  "I love it when you call
me bud," responds Hubie.)</P>
<P>     "You are crazy, insane; you're amazing," Rocko tells Hubie.  He,
and all of the rest of the characters, are not any of these and therein
lies the film's problem.</P>
<P>     THE PEBBLE AND THE PENGUIN runs, thankfully, just 1:14.  It is
rated G for the lack of any offensive material.  Jeffrey and I decided
to rate the show "DD" for double dumb.  He thought the many songs were
particularly "stupid."  We both give the picture thumbs down.  I award
it * only because it could have been worse.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
