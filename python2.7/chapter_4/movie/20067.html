<P>Do we really need more movies about aliens? Since the success of the mediocre
"Independence Day," the multiplex has been full of them. Television has "The
famous black-and-white footage of a supposed alien autopsy. We have also had
the marvelously witty and wicked satire "Mars Attacks!" but seriously folks,
the thrill is gone. "Men in Black" is an entertainingly engaging comedy, and is
full of whiz-bang effects galore, but it doesn't come close to the level of
"Mars Attacks!"</P>
<P>During the opening sequence, we see Will Smith as a cop chasing a remarkably
fast and superhuman killer who leaps from a high-rise building and disappears.
It turns out the killer is an alien, and the Man in Black (Tommy Lee Jones)
arrives on the scene and blasts Will's face with some kind of flashlight stick
called a "neuralizer." Pretty soon, Smith hesitantly joins Jones in a secret
organization called M.I.B., led by a big boss played by Rip Torn who "works 27
hours a day." Their job is to monitor the 1,500 extraterrestrials who disguise
themselves as humans and are mostly residing in Manhattan. Any human memory of
aliens is zapped by the M.I.B's neuralizers. The aliens themselves are not
really evil or monstrous, they are really annoying! One of them even disguises
himself as a dog. </P>
<P>One evil visitor lands in a farmer's backyard. The bug-like alien kills the
farmer and assumes human form as played by Vincent D'Onofrio - he becomes a
decomposing zombie with an obvious limp. This becomes a sly, amusing joke and
it as wacky and overdone as you can imagine. Still, director Barry Sonnenfeld
("Get Shorty") has a commonplace flaw - he tends to take the spontaneity out of
all the numerous gags and jokes by presenting them one after another and
compressing them, and then giving us some dead space until the truly funny
climax. This become more overbearing than exhilarating, and you might forget
most of the jokes since they slip by so quickly. "Men in Black" runs by at a
full-throttle speed of 98 minutes, but it never truly takes off.</P>
<P>The performances hit all the right notes. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have
great comic chemistry and seem to be having a great time. D'Onofrio is a real
riot to watch, although Linda Fiorentino is underutilized, as most female leads
are nowadays, as a doctor who is constantly neuralized. The biggest scene
stealer is an alien disguised as a dog ("You can kiss my furry little butt.")
that provides the biggest laugh in the entire movie. </P>
<P>The visual effects are impressive, especially the final shot of an alien
holding the entire universe on the palm of his hand, and Sonnenfeld has a quick
directorial eye (his visual inventiveness since "The Addams Family," though,
has diminished). The movie is definitely fun yet somewhat dispiriting, and is
not half as clever as the original "Ghostbusters." Another flaw is that it
starts and stops frequently after a bright, rhythmic half-hour - a problem that
conflicts most box-office bonanzas. It's decent fun but, frankly, I've had it
with aliens and would prefer more dinosaurs any day.</P>
