<PRE>Moulin Rouge (2001) 126m.</PRE>
<P>There's a windmill that keeps popping up in MOULIN ROUGE every few minutes.  
It's not central to the plot: it's just there, decked out with pretty 
lights, turning around in circles and going nowhere.  It's probably as good 
a metaphor for MOULIN ROUGE as any, although I'm tempted to think that 
director Baz Luhrmann originally intended it as a jokey aside to the 
Quixotic nature of his brash new undertaking.  You will either love or hate 
MOULIN ROGUE, or more likely both.  There's much that is wonderful and 
dynamic, and just as much that is irritating or hackneyed.  There's 
certainly not much in the storyline: Ewan McGregor plays a would-be bohemian 
writer visiting Paris at the turn of the 20th century, where he becomes 
besotted with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star attraction of the infamous 
Moulin Rouge nightclub.  The fate of the nightclub is in the hands of an 
unscrupulous Duke (Richard Roxburgh) who also has his eye on Satine and will 
brook no competition from the lovesick McGregor.</P>
<P>It took me a while to figure out exactly what Luhrmann was trying to do with 
MOULIN ROUGE.  It's a natural, if predictable, progression from his previous 
two films STRICTLY BALLROOM and ROMEO + JULIET but at first glance seeks 
only to amplify them.  It wasn't until the melodrama of the film's final 
reel that I remembered its great opening credits, and realized that MOULIN 
ROUGE is intended to be a silent film - with music.  Luhrmann, who I suspect 
would be quite pleased to become heir apparent to the throne of Postmodern 
Cinema, throws every reference, in-joke and quotation imaginable into what 
he determines to be the 21st Century version of the Musical, a genre that 
was pretty much defunct after the 60s.  It would not suit the viewing 
sensibilities of modern audiences to play the story straight, as would have 
been done in the days of Judy Garland or Gene Kelly, so instead Luhrmann 
chooses to be campy and flippant.  This makes the film great fun, but also 
repeats the inconsistency of his previous ROMEO + JULIET: MOULIN ROUGE 
immerses us in a totally artificial (i.e. distinctly cinematic) world with 
over-the-top characters and then expects us to feel genuine emotion for them 
at the end simply by descending into pathos.</P>
<P>The death scene, a less successful rehash of R+J, is tiresome, but not as 
tiresome as the film's other patent flaw.  Luhrmann is a talented director 
with a wayward sense of humor, but in MOULIN ROUGE he has only one joke and 
it is repeated ad nauseam.  Worse, it is that laziest recourse of humor, the 
anachronism joke.  It first happens a few minutes into the film when Ewan 
McGregor bursts into a rendition of 'The Sound of Music'.  It's a forgivable 
gag when it occurs, because it points out to us the direction the rest of 
the movie is heading.  Twenty minutes later, when it becomes apparent that 
the characters are not going to stop quoting song lyrics as if they were 
prose, the joke has worn thin (and reminds us that Luhrmann had a better 
writer for his earlier picture!).  It also raises some confusion - there is 
a specific audience that will be of the right age to recognize the quotes 
(mostly from 1970s tunes) so the spoofy nature of the dialogue will be lost 
on many viewers.  It's one thing to have Prince's 'When Doves Cry' 
reformatted for choirboys in ROMEO + JULIET, but another to have McGregor 
and Kidman spouting Bernie Taupin lyrics as if they were poetry and talking 
in conversations made up entirely of lines from Jennifer Warnes, David 
Bowie, The Sweet, Wings, and other artists.  This might be the stuff of 
Postmodernism but it's also a depressing reminder that a number of new 
film-makers are cannibalistic: they don't make movies based on books any 
more, they make movies based on other movies.  Just to show how intertextual 
Luhrmann gets, Kidman's opening scene starts with her belting out 'Diamonds 
are a Girl's Best Friend', which is abruptly interrupted by a phrase from 
Madonna's 'Material Girl'.  Why?  Because the original Madonna video clip 
was itself a parody of the 'Diamonds' number from the film GENTLEMEN PREFER 
BLONDES.  At this stage Luhrmann isn't even making a movie based on a movie, 
but a movie based on a film clip based on a movie.  In the end, MOULIN ROUGE 
is left strutting its stuff like a Frankenstein monster covered in glitter.</P>
<P>Despite this pot-pourri approach, MOULIN ROUGE still manages to be 
refreshing and original.  This doesn't mean it's an original musical - the 
songs are well-known pop tunes that have been incorporated, mostly for 
humorous effect, into the storyline.  I don't have any complaint with this 
because it wasn't uncommon for musicals of the past to be made in a similar 
style, with tunes cobbled together from the likes of Gershwin, Porter and 
Berlin to ensure good box-office - even the classic SINGING IN THE RAIN is 
made up of songs taken from other films.  When it comes down to the bottom 
line, only one question needs to be asked: is this film worth seeing?  The 
answer is yes.  The high points outnumber the flaws (or, more likely, 
overwhelm them) and it is a gloriously cinematic spectacle which deserves to 
be seen and especially heard in a theater.  It outdoes everything Luhrmann 
has done to date, and while it may not be as cohesive as his earlier work it 
at least seems to have been the film he has always wanted to make.  Besides, 
anything featuring a cameo of pop princess Kylie Minogue as a hallucinatory 
green fairy has got to be worth checking out.</P>
