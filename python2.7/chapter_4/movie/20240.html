<PRE>GET BRUCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>After a dramatic production number of "The Color of the Wind," an Oscar
nominee for best song, Academy Awards host Whoopi Goldberg steps back up
to the podium.  The moment is too solemn for her so she decides to go
for one of the lines that she wasn't expected to actually use.
"Question I've always wanted to ask," she muses aloud, "what color is my
wind?"</P>
<P>If you laughed at that joke or any of the other Oscar jokes in the past
decade, you probably have comedy writer Bruce Vilanch to thank.  The
word in Hollywood is that no Oscar or other celebration can happen these
days unless they GET BRUCE, hence the title of Andrew J. Kuehn's
hilarious documentary.  As fast paced as the best monologue, the movie
flies by as laughter fills the theater.</P>
<P>Kuehn has just the right touch with the movie's mixture, helped
enormously by Vilanch who even looks and acts as funny as his classic
comedy lines.  Looking like a Muppet version of the Pillsbury Doughboy,
his large economy-sized head holds two mops full of scraggly hair and
fluffy beard.  Dressed in one of his thousands of sarcastic T-shirts
("My Other Body's In The Shop" being one of his favorites) and
bright-colored shoes and glasses, he's a guy that would stand out in any
crowd, even a Halloween one.</P>
<P>The director takes interviews in which stars like Goldberg, Billy
Crystal and Robin Williams ham it up as they reminisce with Vilanch and
mixes them with live examples of the routines he has crafted for them.
Interspersed with all of this is the telling of Vilanch's life.  An
obese, Jewish guy, Vilanch says that he suffered at an early age by
being moved from New York to New Jersey.</P>
<P>Part of the film concerns the preparation of the material.  Vilanch
subscribes to 65 newspapers and magazines and is a voracious reader,
always trolling for possible material.  In town for a day in New Mexico
to do a show, he finds the report of a gas leak that caused an explosion
the day before.  He's immediately on the phone trying to figure out
who's the most famous fat person in town.  This day he's in luck.  He'll
be able to roast the mayor herself as being the source of the killer
gas.</P>
<P>"Actually everything gets revised 4,000 times," Vilanch says of all the
hard work that goes into each production.  "There is no writing, only
rewriting."   He shows us some of the script versions for one telecast
with each printed on different colored paper.</P>
<P>Watching Vilanch at work, you get a glimpse of true genius.  A
prodigious worker and writer, he started as a cub writer for the Chicago
Tribune.  He reviewed a Bette Midler routine and ended up having dinner
with her.  He told her she needed more dialog in her shows, and he came
to be the one to supply many of her lines.</P>
<P>Soon, he was off to Hollywood where his big break came when he landed
the job as the head writer for "The Brady Bunch Comedy Hour."  He says
he hit bottom when he found himself writing jokes for Donny and Marie
Osmond.</P>
<P>These days he creates comedy sketches for everyone.  "He's given more
great lines to celebrities than any coke dealer," Nathan Lane says with
a grin.</P>
<P>Vilanch carefully tailors his approach to each of his star clients.  For
Robin Williams, he throws ideas at him and then stands back and watches.
One of the clips in the documentary shows one such collaboration.  After
some obscure inspiration, Williams starts fashioning an ad hoc routine
that mixes "The Jack Benny Show," "Amos n' Andy" and "The X-Files."</P>
<P>Although normally behind the scenes, Vilanch does surface on occasion as
when he won an Emmy.  His one-line acceptance speech was hysterically
funny and typically Vilanch: "I'm very sorry I didn't have to sleep
around to win this award."</P>
<P>GET BRUCE runs a blisteringly fast 1:12.  It is not rated but might be
an R for language and sexual innuendo.  It would be fine for kids 12 and
up.</P>
