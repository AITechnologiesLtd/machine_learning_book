<PRE>                           A BUG'S LIFE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
       3 out of 5 for the Davids and Goliaths of the insect world</PRE>

Pierce, Denis Leary, Joe Ranft, Phyllis Diller, Richard Kind.
Screenplay: Andrew Stanton and Donald McEnery & Bob Shaw. Directors:
John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton.</P>
<P>Somehow the idea of playful, individualistic insects with attitude
hasn't caught my imagination. This movie is primarily aimed at children,
but will entertain adults as well. It is not as cleverly scripted as the
humourous Antz, but carries about it a more innocent charm that is rose
coloured and typically Disney. From the story's start you get the
feeling that the dumb, mean locusts are being set up for the cute,
little, purple ants to overcome. This is to highlight several Disney
themes like – ‘It doesn't pay to be a bully', ‘for every Goliath there
are several Davids', ‘there is strength in unity' and ‘dare to be
yourself'. There is enough good O' southern preaching in this movie to
fill the sermon books of any lay preacher. Needless to say, Disney does
not failed to entertain or deliver the goods. The songs are lively, the
characters delightful and engaging. Although this is not my idea of A
Bug's Life, which is usually promptly ended under my foot, who is to say
we can't romanticise a picture perfect insect world where everything
works out perfectly in the end.</P>
