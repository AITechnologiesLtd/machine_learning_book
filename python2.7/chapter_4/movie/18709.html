<P>I have become sickened by all the Tarantino rip-offs, too many to
mention.  Almost all have none of the grace, wit or humanity that dear
Quentin invests in his own works. They are like well-designed
wallpapers flung with graphic violence, countless obscenities, and
numerous rock n' roll/rap songs and packaged as something shocking and
new. Some star Michael Madsen, Martin Sheen or Dennis Hopper. "Out of
Sight" was the most dazzling but that had the advantage of a great
author, Elmore Leonard, as its basis, and Steven Soderbergh, a stylish
director. The new "Go" is different - it's as symmetrically close to
"Pulp Fiction" as you can imagine but it has an electric energy and
volume all its own.</P>
<P>The film begins with a supermarket checkout girl named Ronna
(soft-voiced and droopy-eyed Sarah Polley from "Sweet Hereafter") who
establishes a drug connection for two handsome soap opera stars, Adam
(Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr). Ronna's drug of choice is ecstasy,
which one member of her elite group nearly overdoses on and imagines
speaking to a cat with Zen subtitles. Ronna has to deal with the seedy
drug dealer, Todd (Timothy Olyphant), who has a propensity for sexual
favors. But when her good friend, Claire (Katie Holmes), another
supermarket checkout girl, is left alone with this devil, things truly
go haywire.</P>
<P>After Ronna's predicament, we flash back to the beginning of
the story told from the point-of-view of a thick-accented, red-haired
Brit, Simon (Desmond Askew). Simon is a drug connection for Todd
(Ronna is the replacement) and goes off to Vegas with his pals,
including the suave Marcus (Taye Diggs) and a stoner who thinks he's
black, Tiny (Breckin Meyer - always the pothead).  Unfortunately,
after a debacle involving backroom lap-dancers ("Do not touch!"), they
are now on the run from a vicious gangster (the terrifically oily
J.E. Freeman). And it is here where we experience one of the most
dazzling car chases ever filmed to the tune of Steppenwolf's "Magic
Carpet Ride."</P>
<P>Then the story flashes back again and we see the story told
from the point-of-view of the two soap opera stars, who are working
undercover under the tutelage of the Teutonic cop Burke (William
Fichtner), a character that makes you squirm. Burke invites the pair
to a Christmas dinner that is fraught with misunderstandings and
unclear intentions. Let's just say it is a howler of a sequence,
guaranteed to keep you laughing at its inevitable payoff.</P>
<P>The characters, as well as the audience, experience one
near-catastrophe after another, and all the characters seem intent to
make a whole 24-hour, Rashomon-like experience as dangerously exciting
as possible with no inhibitions - they will do absolutely anything for
thrills. There are gangsters, awry drug deals, dances to the tune of
"Macarena," distorted visions, extreme violence, conversations about
Tantric sex and the comic "The Family Circus," and lots more to feast
the eyes and the ears.</P>
<P>"Go" is suffused with electric energy throughout - there is
not a moment that is not thrilling or kinetic in any way. Director
Doug Liman ("Swingers") frames his charismatic actors with tension
abounding every step of the way by means of a constantly roving
camera. The opening titles show a stroboscopic club where silhouetted
patrons dance the night away in light blue hues, and the editing is
lightning-paced. This brilliantly sets up the rest of the film's pace,
and sometimes Liman will slow down long enough to study the actor's
faces.</P>
<P>I enjoyed all the actors on screen, but Sarah Polley has a
dole-like quality that is more realistic than the cardboard teens
shown in other films - I could not stop looking at her. Katie Holmes
displays a sensuousness and a charm that made me swoon. I also liked
the merry soul of Taye Diggs, a definite star-in-the-making.</P>
<P>"Go" may remind many of "Pulp Fiction," but this film has its
own momentum, and plenty of style to spare. It's a crazy film that
will keep you on edge - funny, energetic, joyous, jolting, ironic, and
tense. You can't ask for a better time at the movies.</P>
