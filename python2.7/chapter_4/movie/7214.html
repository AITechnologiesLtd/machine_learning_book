<P>    This is the dopiest of the three movies and, thus, the easiest to
pick on.  The tone is insufferably broad.  The cross-cutting is hideous.
Even wise old Yoda is a bore, hacking his way through an embarrassing
death scene.  (Eh heh, eh heh, eh heh, throat lozenge please pass.) And,
and, and, so what?  To quote someone else's .signature, "The ability to
criticize STAR WARS is insignificant next to the power of The Fans." For
all the stuff that sucks-- two words: Ewok babies-- there's something
else that sends even the casual fan soaring.  My favorite moment is
watching Vader watching his son getting creamed by the Emperor.  Those
hollow, plastic eyes chill me to the bone.  (That is, once I accept the
fact that no amount of purple electricity is going to make Mark Hamill's
hair stand on end.)  And don't miss the added footage, at the very end,
showing celebrations on a couple of other planets.  These are the first
glimpses into what we'll likely see in two years, when George Lucas
unveils the first of his STAR WARS prequels.</P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>    RETURN OF THE JEDI was screened at Mann's Chinese Theater, in Los
Angeles.  Lines had formed for both the afternoon and evening shows.  I
had my picture taken with three costumed characters, an Imperial pilot,
a Stormtrooper, and an Imperial guard.</P>
