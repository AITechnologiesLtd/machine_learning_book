<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Why do titles have to be so ironic? Not to say that Practical Magic is an
oxy moron, some of the camera tricks that they have are nice and neat. But
the movie itself is neither practical nor magic, which it would so much like
us to believe. It's not a witchcraft movie, it's not a female bonding movie,
or a family movie. It's not much of a romance, it's not much of a thriller.
It's not much of a PG-13 horror, either. What it is is OK. Nothing more,
nothing less.
It's one of those movies that I kind of just sat through. I was a passive
participant. I didn't even get to make my usual comments picking on it while
I watched it (except for one). It's not a waste of your time, if you have
time to kill. It's not a bad movie to take some witches to: I can say its
religiously accurate. But what use is that?</P>
<P>You'd think it be great, or at least good, starring Nichole Kidman and
Sandra Bullock, directed by Giffen Dunne (Addicted to Love). But instead its
just mediocre. It's just OK. End of story. End of film. End of review.</P>
