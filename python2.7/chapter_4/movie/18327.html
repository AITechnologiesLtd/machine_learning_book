<PRE>MY FAVORITE MARTIAN
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Another day, another nostalgic sitcom movie adaptation.  But, with My
Favorite Martian, Hollywood is truly scraping the bottom of the barrel.
(Well, one could argue that the barrel scraping started with Car 54,
Where Are You? and McHale's Navy, but let's not quibble, shall we?)  The
headache-inducing My Favorite Martian has little to offer but empty
special effects and a vacant sense of humor.</P>
<P>Jeff Daniels stars as Tim O'Hara, a struggling television journalist.
He spends his time chasing pointless news stories while lusting after
the boss's sexy reporter daughter, Brace Channing (Elizabeth Hurley),
and completely ignoring his production assistant, Lizzie (Daryl Hannah).</P>
<P>Tim's entire life is turned upside down when he witnesses a UFO crash.
Before he knows it, the alien inside has donned human form, and moves in
with him, posing as his "Uncle Martin" (Christopher Lloyd).  As if
living with an alien with magical powers wasn't enough, Tim also has to
put up with Martin's self-animated talking spacesuit, named Zoot.  (Zoot
was apparently added to demonstrate special effects technology and
provide comic relief...neither of which he does very well.)</P>
<P>In addition to repairing his spaceship, Martin must evade the
governmental men in black who are hunting him down.  Led by the obsessed
scientist, Dr. E. Coleye (Wallace Shawn), and accompanied by the
enigmatic Armitan (Ray Walston), the government agents will stop at
nothing to capture a live Martian specimen.</P>
<P>This is the type of film whose most inspired scene is its very first (in
which the Mars Pathfinder somehow misses evidence of a thriving
futuristic alien society on Mars).  It's a scene almost worthy of a
laugh, and everything is all downhill from there.</P>
<P>Borrowing a page from Flubber, My Favorite Martian subscribes to the
theory that frantic special effects action simply must be humorous.  The
idea is that if there's enough commotion on the screen, your mind will
simply stop trying to find humor, and just assume that things must be
funny.  Granted, small children and the easily amused might actually
fall for that ploy, but most people will simply get annoyed.</P>
<P>Christopher Lloyd's spaced out spaceman is simply a variation on his
familiar wild and eccentric characters.  Martin could easily be Back to
the Future's Doc Brown with antennae (if only he were more amusing).
Jeff Daniels once again  plays the exasperated straight man.  You would
think he would be able to find better material than this by now.</P>
<P>Young children and others who don't know better might pretend to find
some sense of amusement in My Favorite Martian.  But don't be
fooled...this film is even more desolate than the arid Martian
landscape.</P>
