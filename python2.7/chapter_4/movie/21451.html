<PRE>Omega Code: indirectly to video</PRE>
<P>It is possible to counterbalance weak writing with high action, cool
effects, all that. Look at all the American Ninjas, Gymkatas, etc, which,
though admittedly lacking in story, are nevertheless fun to watch for all
the head kicks and double back flips. Or, take Fair Game, a shoddy movie
with very well-choreographed effects, which keeps us coming back to it again
and again. Or Starship Troopers, which, as we go it to solely for the space
bugs, tends to satisfy (i.e., has enough space bugs to go around). The
formula is simple: construct whatever story is minimally necessary to allow
all the cool effects. This is how porn works, after all, yes? It's about
anticipating your target audience's needs and then catering to that
audience. There's an implicit deal there, even, an understanding. Supply and
demand; exploitation.</P>
<P>As with any 'implicit' deal, however, there's room for misunderstanding, the
possibility that a movie will lure the target audience into the theatre only
to show them a different movie altogether. Regrettably, this is what Omega
Code does: instead of foregrounding all the high-action stuff as the trailer
suggests, it attempts to supplant it with a reckless amalgamation of all the
stories that 'should' work. Which is to say what it tries to make cool is
the story, when we're not there for the story. And then, to add insult to
betrayal, it's not even a good story at that. Or rather, it's a bad mix of,
say, the religious thriller aspects of Seventh Sign (Prophecy, Omen,
Stigmata, etc), the 'biblical code' intrigue of pi, and the 'ancient
gadgetry' of Stargate, with a load of shallow historical references thrown
in as afterthought (e.g., the bad guy is "Alexander," trying to conquer that
world).</P>
<P>It all centers around Dr. Lane (Casper Van Dien; Starship Troopers, yes),
motivational guru, world religion expert, Joseph Campbell wannabe. He's our
hero, strutting into every situation with the same unshakable confidence
Brandon Fraser had in the 1999 Mummy. As if he knows it's all just a movie.
Soon enough Lane hooks up with Stone Alexander (Michael York), and together
they remap the Middle East with not much more than platitude and gumption.
After a feat like that, the world's easy pickings. In a matter of scenes,
then, Alexander is crowned king of the new world order. Granted, the ease
with which he conquers the known world is nominally justified by the fact
that Alexander is clandestinely following his stolen Omega Code like a
script--simply fulfilling the history-of-things-to-come as it's spelled out
in numbers, in the Torah--but still, if simple foreknowledge were all that's
necessary, wouldn't (James Bond's) Spectre have figured that out long ago?
Essentially, Alexander comes to power the same way Biff from Back to the
Future 2 wanted to: by reading tomorrow's paper. And that's been done and
done and done.</P>
<P>To Omega Code's credit, however, it does fulfill a few genre expectations:
the bad guy does have a foreign accent and access to all the computers; the
good guy is having marital difficulties; all the women are stunningly
beautiful; Michael Ironside is a somebody's henchman. And, as for the Omega
Code itself, it's comfortably familiar, or, is something of a mix between
the Omega Molecule in Star Trek Voyager and the Genesis Effect in Star Trek:
The Wrath of Khan. All of which is to say there's nothing new in Omega Code,
even down to it's attempt to play on our Millennium fears. It does have a 12
Monkeys moment, though, with the fugitive turning from a cop car only to
find his face on wall of television sets, but that's hardly enough to save a
movie that feels like it was accidentally routed to the theatre, when it in
fact should have gone directly to video.</P>
