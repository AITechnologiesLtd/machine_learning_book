Vincent D'Onofrio; Siobhan Fallon; Tony Shalhoub 
Director: Barry Sonnenfeld 
Screenplay: Ed Solomon </P>
<P>A July 4 weekend opening date. Will Smith battling aliens. A moniker 
alias composed of three characters. It must be the gospel truth to say 
that Columbia Pictures is hoping their "Men in Black" conjures up 
memories of last summer's mega-hit "Independence Day." Alas, it does, 
but in an unexpected way -- both films bear the mark of being vastly 
disappointing, although "MiB" doesn't ever come close to the 
mind-numbing awfulness of "ID4." </P>
<P>So hip it practically demands that you like it, "Men in Black" fails to 
surprise -- probably due to its heavily-pushed ad campaign. If you've 
seen the trailers, you've also seen most of the movie, a sad 
miscalculation that makes "MiB" feel less like a film than a 98-minute 
commercial for itself. But it's still no bore -- occasionally, there's 
wicked whimsy to be found, most of it likely spun from the hand of 
director and black comedy maestro Barry Sonnenfeld. </P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones exercises his bravura deadpan skill here as Agent K, a 
member of the top secret titular government sect whose job it is to 
monitor and regulate the on-Earth presence of intergalactic visitors. 
While K is showing the ropes to recently-recruited Agent J (Will Smith, 
displaying the same matter-of-fact cockiness that was the best thing 
about "ID4"), a terrorist bug crashes by a rural farmhouse, inhabits the 
body of nasty redneck Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) and sets into motion a 
diabolical plan that involves the theft of a golf ball-sized galaxy and 
the slaughter of an alien ambassador presently on the planet in human 
trappings. </P>
<P>"Men in Black" is most fun when it expands on the events unfolding 
between J and K. Smith's training session (where it is revealed that Al 
Roker, Dionne Warwick and Dennis Rodman are, uh, not of this world) is a 
subtle, jokey riot. The sequences where J and K talk to Edgar's 
understandably distraught wife (Siobhan Fallon) -- and afterwards, erase 
her mind of the preceding events with a neat little gadget called a 
neuralyzer -- and interrogate an extraterrestrial informant in a very 
unusual disguise bring on the few belly laughs that "MiB" offers. The 
rest of the movie is definitely watchable, but could have achieved much 
higher ground had the ensuing development not been delivered with such a 
strong feeling of deja vu. </P>
<P>The capable cast does what they can whenever Ed Solomon's screenplay -- 
based on a cult comic, by the way -- lags. It's great fun to see Jones 
interacting with other species with the same kind of laid-back serenity 
with which your typical person greets the mailman. Also effective is Rip 
Torn as the MiB overseer, but Linda Fiorentino is a tad underused as a 
mortician -- you can predict her character's inevitable destination as 
soon as she's been introduced. D'Onofrio, a little-known actor usually 
cast in small, independent films, gets suitably weirder as his carcass 
decomposes. </P>
<P>Had "Men in Black" kept secretive some of its strange creatures, then 
it'd be worth talking about. But as it stands, everything is foolishly 
foreshadowed, including a cadaver whose noggin pops open to reveal a 
mini alien and J's finale boxing match with a giant cockroach (which 
makes little sense). In the long run, the snappy dialogue ("The cab 
drivers on this planet are terrible," laments one weary space traveler) 
is far spiffier than any of the sights. "Men in Black" is more 
dissatisfying in immediate afterthought than in week-old retrospect, but 
relish what's good about it while you can -- as other big summer 
attractions pop up, you'll feel like someone flashed a neuralyzer at 
you. What color were they again? </P>
