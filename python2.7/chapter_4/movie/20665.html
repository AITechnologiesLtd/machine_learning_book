Stop Making Sense: Re-release</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A straight-lipped, ball-eyed David Byrne sets a tiny boom box on a bare
stage. The box clicks out a tragically unhip, retro drum-machine beat to
which he strums "Psycho Killer" solo on the acoustic guitar. A perfectly
quirky intro to Byrne's punk-paranoia, funk-roasted musical spazzfest. Bass
player Tina Weymouth joins him in "Heaven" (the next tune); each song
thereafter adding a new Talking Head player to the stage until the modest
Pantages Theater is rocking side to side with the sweat and swing of all
nine musicians.</P>
<P>Completely void of the now standard, blaringly quick, MTV camera cuts, this
particular concert flick allows you time to enjoy the band members sautéing
in their own emotions. What a refreshing way to view music. During "That's
the Way it Goes" all camera angles are kept above the waist; allowing only
"Head Shots" -- the musicians' eyes say it all. Byrne and the band are so
deliciously entertaining to watch that there's no need for digital special
effects, wipes, fades, millisecond cuts, guitar string close-ups, or crowd
shots. Much well-earned praise has been given to director Jonathan Demme for
this 1984 gem, but David Byrne gave the man mountains of visual sweetmeats
to dolly around.</P>
<P>When I saw the original release, I wasn't ready for Byrne's wiggly nervous
vocals. Now, from a 1999 perspective, I greatly appreciate his bold
electrically eccentric self-expression. It emanates from his eyes, voice,
guitar and boils over into his convulsing body. (The big suit can't even
contain it.) His ironic paranoid demeanor is a front for his magnetic
confidence. Byrne's oddity is set in perfect contrast to solid
punk-funk-rock and roll. (Perhaps he was exactly 15 years ahead of his
time.)</P>
<P>Though a surprising amount of the film is shot in soft focus (a euphemism
for "not really in focus"): a decade and a half later, the music and brash
presence of creative genius still byrne down the house.</P>
