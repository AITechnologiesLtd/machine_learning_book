<P>A weak offering from the Coen brothers will usually still be head and
shoulders above most other films, a point proven with O Brother, Where
Art Thou?.  Compared to any of the Coen's previous films, O Brother just
doesn't measure up.  But since the brothers have consistently made some
of the best films over the last decade and a half, even something that
doesn't seem up to their usual standards can tower over its competition.</P>
<P>O Brother, which is loosely based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' in set in
1937 Mississippi, where a rock-breaking chain gang appears on the screen
after the nifty silent movie title cards used for the film's opening
credits. Three of the convicts (apparently the only three white
prisoners there) escape through a giant cornfield and are quickly
involved in two very funny sight gags because of their still-shackled
feet.</P>
<P>The fast-talking leader of the group is Everett Ulysses McGill (George
Clooney, The Perfect Storm), who orchestrated the jailbreak because only
four days remain before his `treasure' will be underwater. The treasure
in question is from an armored car robbery McGill pulled off some years
earlier, while the "underwater" comment remains somewhat of a mystery.
In addition to the treasure, McGill also has some pretty serious issues
with his hair, which he constantly slicks back with Dapper Dan's Pomade.</P>
<P>McGill's two sidekicks are Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro, Cradle Will
Rock) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson, The Thin Red Line), two
animated dimwits who specialize in hysterical slack-jawed expressions.
The three men begin the trek to McGill's home, but first they come upon
a strange black man speaking in riddles that foreshadow what the escaped
cons are going to encounter over the next four days.</P>
<P>And, oh, the things they encounter.  They rob a bank with the manically
sensitive `Babyface' Nelson (Michael Badalucco, The Practice), interrupt
a Ku Klux Klan rally, run into a slightly deranged bible salesman (John
Goodman, Normal, Ohio), cross paths with three lovely sirens, and even
cut a hit record at a radio station owned by a blind man (Stephen Root,
Bicentennial Man).  And the coppers are on their tail the entire
journey.</P>
<P>O Brother is full of all kinds of great ‘30s slang and mannerisms, plus
some wonderful Southern accents.  The music is first-rate, too, with
most being penned by T-Bone Burnett (he was part of Bob Dylan's `Rolling
Thunder Review') and Chris Thomas King, who appears in the film as a
blues musician at a familiar crossroads after a certain appointment (his
name is Johnson – Tommy, not Robert).  And Roger Deakins' (Thirteen
Days) lush photography is spellbinding, giving every scene in O Brother
a golden glow that could translate to a golden night at next year's
Oscar ceremony.</P>
<P>The negatives of O Brother are pretty minor.  At times, it seems like
the Coens (The Big Lebowski) just stuck a bunch of random ideas
together, using bits that they couldn't squeeze into their previous
films.  From the color of the leaves and the dead corn stalks that make
up the backgrounds of nearly every scene, it should be autumn, but a
newspaper tells us it's the middle of July.  The film also wags its
tongue at P.E.T.A., showing some pretty bad stuff happening to animals
for comedic value.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, O Brother is practically a musical, offering more than a
couple of nicely orchestrated song and dance numbers.  Also somewhat
shocking is the strong performance from Clooney, who seems totally wrong
for a role like this, but does an exceedingly good job.  Turturro and
the relatively unknown Nelson (he directs an upcoming version of
Othello' – called O) deliver great performances, too.  An interesting
note: Turturro supplied the voice of Badalucco's dog when he played
David Berkowitz in Summer of Sam.</P>
<P>1:46 – PG-13 for adult language, violence and some bad animal cruelty</P>
