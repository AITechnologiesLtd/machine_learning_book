<P> Go (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Sarah Polley, Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf,
Desmond Askew and Taye Diggs</P>
<P> "Go" is an energetic exercise in frantic filmmaking that also is witty,
stylish and enjoyable.</P>
<P> The movie, directed by Doug Liman of "Swingers'" fame, tells three
interconnecting stories set on Christmas Eve and all concerning young
people involved in Los Angeles' raucous and seamy underground life.</P>
<P> The initial story revolves around Ronna (Sarah Polley), an 18-year-old
grocery store checkout clerk who needs to raise some money to keep from
being evicted from her apartment.</P>
<P> She hits upon a scheme to fill in for Simon (Desmond Askew), one of her
co-workers, who deals drugs as a sideline.</P>
<P> Simon, it seems, is taking off with some friends for a weekend jaunt in
Las Vegas.</P>
<P> Ronna scores some pills, which she is supposed to sell to Adam (Scott
Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr), a pair of TV stars, who, coincidentally, find
themselves starring in a real-life drug sting.</P>
<P> All those stories and most of the characters intersect in John August's
fast-paced script.</P>
<P> Liman, who also handled the cinematography, creates an edgy atmosphere as
he continually jumps his camera around. You never know what's going to
happen next, nor who will pop into the picture.</P>
<P> Of the three stories, the best - and funniest - is the vignette set in
Vegas where Simon and his buddies, including Marcus (Taye Diggs), are set
for a weekend of frolic.</P>
<P> Of course things go terribly wrong as Simon is involved in a fire, a
shooting and a car theft. The Vegas stay is cut short as the buddies make a
hasty retreat back to Los Angeles.</P>
<P> Though "Go" is an ensemble piece, a couple of the performers do stand out,
especially Diggs as the ever-cool Marcus and Polley as the beleaguered
Ronna.</P>
<P> This is a movie geared more for the 20-something audience. Older audiences
may not appreciate the casual approach to drugs and sex. If so, that's
their loss, since "Go" is rife with humor.</P>
<P> Wolf and Mohr are winning as the actors dealing with a moral dilemma,
while Askew is a bit outrageous as the impulsive Briton who, as he tells
his buddies, learned to drive by watching American cop shows.</P>
<P> Liman, following in the footsteps of Quentin Tarantino, deftly mixes
comedy and violence, overdoing neither.</P>
<P> And while "Go" is no "Pulp Fiction," it has a similar in-your-face air,
daring you to accept the movie on its own terms or forget it.</P>
<P> "Go" is an entertaining ride, a wild, kinetic experience that is most
satisfying.</P>
