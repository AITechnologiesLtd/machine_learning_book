<PRE>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
Directed by William Friedkin
Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan

(Theater)   R   123 min.</PRE>
<P>     Back in the '70s, when Vietnam was raging and the Young Turks
were blazing a rebellious trail through Hollywood, a tyro auteur like
William Friedkin, with the mantle of European artistic sensibility
draped stylishly across his shoulders, would have cast a cold eye on a
job of work like "Rules of Engagement".  That was then, this is now.
     Still, a lot of this movie is pretty engaging, if you close your
eyes to a smattering of logic-stretchers and wince-makers.  Two Marine
colonels, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) and Terry Childers (Samuel
L. Jackson), have been buddies since Vietnam, when Childers saved
Hodges's life.  Hodges sustained the leg wound that put him behind a
lawyer's desk for the rest of his Marine career while Childers went on
distinguishing himself in combat in the world's trouble zones.
     Then comes Yemen.  A protest outside the American embassy turns
ugly (we never quite know what it's about.)  Childers evacuates the
American ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and then, under withering attack
and with marines dropping like flies, orders his men to fire on the
crowd.  83 are killed, including a lot of women and children.  No
weapons are found among the dead, and a surveillance tape goes
missing.  Childers finds himself facing a court-martial.  Of course he
turns to his old buddy, who of course is retiring, and doesn't want
the responsibility ("I'm a good enough lawyer to know you need a
better lawyer than me.")
     What "Rules" would like to be about, and sometimes rises to, is a
moral ambiguity in which the boundaries between duty and excess,
defensible reaction and overkill, Guadalcanal and My Lai, good and
evil, are blurred.  The courtroom stuff is good, although the promised
mismatch between the self-described plodder Hodges and the brilliant
prosecutor (Guy Pearce) never materializes - Hodges holds his own
nicely.  But the story is generously ventillated with holes, and
characters do things that simply make no sense, and Friedkin grabs at
cliches like a contestant asking Regis for a lifeline.  It is revealed
that politicians are slimy and unprincipled, that men at arms forge
special bonds (even if they're on opposing sides), and that, as Pearce
points out, that "whether a man is charged with murder or hailed as a
hero is sometimes a very thin line.."
     The acting is of the high quality you'd expect from a cast that
includes Jones and Jackson and Kingsley and Anne Archer.  Pearce tries
on a Bronx accent, and wears it well.  Bruce Greenwood's villainy is
overdone, but the fault is with the filmmaker.  Whether a man is
hailed as a great director or pilloried as a hack is sometimes a very
thin line.  And sometimes not so thin.</P>
