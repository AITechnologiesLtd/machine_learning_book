<PRE>                              ME MYSELF I
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     What is it about foreigners and alternate reality comedy/dramas? 
On the heels of Sliding Doors, Twice Upon a Yesterday, and who knows
what other indies comes Me Myself I, starring Rachel Griffiths in the
dual role of a harried Australian woman and, well, herself.</P>
<P>     On her birthday, Pamela (Griffiths) wakes up to realize that her
life is a mess.  She's not thrilled with her job and eats cereal for
dinner, but more importantly, she doesn't have a man.  In fact, she
turned down a proposal some dozen years earlier, a move she now
regrets.  Surprise! when one day she is hit by a car that is driven by
none other than herself -- an unexplained alternate universe
dweller/magical leprechaun-type-of-person who accepted the
aforementioned proposal to Robert (David Roberts), and with whom she is
happily married.</P>
<P>     Or not so happily, as it turns out.  Single-Pamela soons discovers
numerous infidelities and three rotten kids, because Married-Pamela
quickly abandons her with her erstwhile family in a bid to swap lives. 
Single-Pamela learns the joys of dinner parties, grocery shopping for a
family of five, and potty training.</P>
<P>     I'm told the plot is virtually identical to The Family Man, only
with a chick instead of a dude.  You can take that for what you will,
but I for one and getting a bit tired of gimmicky stories like this. 
Griffiths is as capable as can be expected in her role, but the comedy
of Me Myself I is a bit flat, with only a few moments of ingenious
amusement to take your eyes off the advancing counter on the VCR.</P>
<P>     That said, the film also suffers from a horrendous sound mix, which
has its frequent musical numbers (including an atrocious title song)
blaring at four to five times the volume of the rest of the film.  I
actually had to get up and turn the volume down repeatedly, only to turn
it back up when people started talking again.  Not exactly what you want
from a romantic comedy when you're snuggling with your honey on the
couch.</P>
