<P>Starship troopers is a weird movie. Not weird as in "giant bugs want to
take over the unniverse and we are first on the list" weird...that i can
buy. It is weird because it uneasily balances two very different genres.
First there's the "look at me , i'm so good looking" genre from 90210
and then there's the "let's kick some alien butt" genre from ID4. </P>
<P>Any fool will tell you that these two items do not go together...but the
director , Paul Verhoeven , is not just any fool. He's a fool with a 100
million dollar budget. Unfortunately , he could not spare a few bucks to
buy a pencil and some paper to write a decent script. Money is power and
power corrupts. While wtaching this movie i swear i could sometimes hear
Paul screaming "More effects! More gorgeous people!" and laughing
sadistically in the background. </P>
<P>Hell , i'd be laughing too if i could get away with making a 100 million
dollar movie for the 90210 crowd...while making sure it contains enough
violence to attract the adults. Teens will love this film because of the
familiar surgically enhanced faces of their favorite tv actors and
adults will adore it for the outrageous violence.  The cast is straight
out of the Aaron Spelling school of acting , 'nuff said.</P>
<P>On the bright side of things it 's also the most fun i've had while
watching a movie since Men In Black. But i would be remiss in my duties
as a critic if i did not say that Starship Troopers is the most godawful
piece of crap i've ever seen. </P>
<P>My question to Paul Verhoeven is this:"What happened?"
He used to make great movies like Total Recall , Robocop , Basic
Instinct... So , at the risk of repeating myself , what happened? </P>
<P>Melrose Place happened , Baywatch happened...and this disease is
spreading to hollywood directors. I realized i was watching an episode
of 90210 during the scene when the prettiest girl in class barfs during
biology. Or when we find out our hero is in a love triangle. Or when he
loses the first girl , gets close with the second , she dies and he
jumps right back into the arms of the first. </P>
<P>I know this is what happens in the book but the directing is so bad it
feels like a bad soap opera. The actors are wooden planks that can run
and fire weapons. Except for Michael Ironside and , to a small degree ,
Dina Meyer. How bad are the rest? One girl gets stabbed through the
shoulder by a bug. She has a hole the size of a baseball in her shoulder
but , hey! , she's a tough cookie so the next second she's firing her
rifle and blasting bugs with said shoulder. </P>
<P>It's not all bad. In fact , it's pretty damn fun even amazing at times.
The effects and incredible and there is nothing more satisfying then
killing bugs. So , in conclusion...</P>
<PRE>-The dialogue sucks.
-The actors are horrible.
-The script is...uhm , missing.
-The movie takes an hour to get to the good parts...</PRE>
<PRE>...but from then on it's a hell of a ride!</PRE>
