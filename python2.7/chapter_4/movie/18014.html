<P>   Driving a cab must be interesting.  Every day you meet a
variety of people and chances are some of them are
celebrities whose popularity can rub off on you.  If the job is
so fascinating, why do so few New York drivers speak
English?  Nowadays, only immigrants with few skills seem to
be getting into driving and even then, only temporarily until
they can develop whatever is needed for something better. 
Fact is, there isn't much money if you're renting the vehicles
and medallion and, if you own your own, you're paying off the
$150,000 that it costs you nowadays just to get that badge on
your hood that allows you to do business in New York. 
What's more you're putting in 12 hours a day with little
exercise and considerable danger.</P>
<P>   Because driving a taxi is so unpredictable, you'd think that
drivers would have quite a few stories to tell.  Before the
great cafeteria The Belmore closed down a few years ago,
that bustling restaurant was a hot spot for drivers who'd be
able to park outside, use the facilities, and chew the fat with
their colleagues about their fascinating experiences.  You'd
think that quite a few movies could be conjured up from such
conversations, but "Fare Games" shows just how difficult
translating cafeteria conversations into celluloid can be.  </P>
<P>   Isaac Agami, who produced the movie "Fare Games" in
1995 (which is being released only now, four years later),
grew up in Jerusalem, where he developed a love for movies,
but when he moved to New York some two decades ago, he
found himself unable to earn a living as a distributor of
independent films.  He took to driving a cab.  Some of the
episodes of the movie may well be autobiographical.  The
trouble is that though the genre is ripe for both fun and
melodrama, Mr. Agami's crew has shaped a film that is so
ineptly written, so poorly acted, photographed and directed
that you'd have to search under the hood, in the trunk, and
under the back seat to find any redeeming value therein.</P>
<P>   Under the virtually invisible direction of Brian O'Hara, "Fare
Games" focuses on two forty-something drivers who are
friends despite their distinct temperaments.  Martin (Russel
Stewart) is bald and divorced and looks his age.  He lives
alone and despite the many fares he picks up, he admits to
getting along without a sexual outlet.  By contrast, the tall and
handsome Jimmy (Eddie Estefan) is married, lives in a
spacious Long Island home that seems well beyond his
means, with a wife who apparently does not work but spends
her mornings cutting up men with her friend Marilyn.  Each
driver is to meet a woman who will change his life.  Jimmy
develops a thing with Jennifer (Marina Morgan), an attractive
and uninhibited 20-year-old blond college student who invites
him to spend evenings with her in her rich aunt's home in
Riverdale.  Martin teams up with Susie (Elizabeth Curtain), a
sweet dancer in her twenties, who has been willing to dance
in a topless bar but draws the line at her waistband.  Needing
a place to stay, she is invited by Martin to spend some time
under his humble roof until she can get herself straightened
out financially.</P>
<P>   What passes for humor includes a guy who is spending
time on a pay phone, throwing in terms from the 70's like
"dude" and "bummer," some banal repartee between Jimmy
and the waitress in a Queens diner, a threat by Jimmy's wife
Barbara (Andre Leigh) to become the Lorena Bobbitt of the
late 90's unless her husband 'fesses up to his affair, and
some man-hating talk by Barbara's neighbor, Marilyn, who 
insists with a Brooklyn accent that "all men are dogs, just
sniffing around."</P>
<P>   There isn't a single episode on the long-running TV
comedy "Taxi" that doesn't beat the humor, the wit, even the
pathos of "Fare Games."  Granted: there are no Judd
Hirsches or Danny DeVitos is Mr. Agami's low-budget
production.  But during his 20+ years as a New Yorker,
couldn't the producer have found a dancer who does not go
through her role on Valium or a writer who doesn't exploit
every dated and banal colloquy in the books?  </P>
