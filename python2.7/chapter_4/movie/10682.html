<PRE>REVIEW: MOUSE HUNT (1997)</PRE>

<P>How do films like MOUSE HUNT get into theatres?  Isn't there a law or
something?</P>
<P>This diabolical load of claptrap from Steven Speilberg's Dreamworks
studio is Hollywood family fare at its deadly worst.  MOUSE HUNT takes
the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and
flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like JINGLE ALL THE WAY
look decent by comparison.</P>
<P>Writer Adam Rifkin and director Gore Verbinski are the names chiefly
responsible for this swill.  The plot, for what its worth, concerns
two brothers (Nathan Lane and an appalling Lee Evens) who inherit a
poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their
eccentric father.  Deciding to check out the long-abandoned house,
they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in
auction to the highest bidder.  But battling them at every turn is a
very smart mouse, happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it
to stay that way.</P>
<P>The story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering
over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as
the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe.  Whatever
promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue,
terrible overacting, and increasingly uninspired slapstick that
becomes all sound and fury, signifying nothing.  The script becomes so
unspeakably bad that the best line poor Lee Evens can utter after
another run in with the rodent is: "I hate that mouse".  Oh cringe!
This is HOME ALONE all over again, and ten times worse.</P>
<P>One touching scene early on is worth mentioning.  We follow the mouse
through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift
abode somewhere in a wall.  He jumps into a tiny bed, pulls up a
makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep, seemingly happy and just
wanting to be left alone.  It's a magical little moment in an
otherwise soulless film.</P>
<P>A message to Speilberg: if you want Dreamworks to be associated with
some kind of artistic credibility, then either give all concerned in
MOUSE HUNT a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent
writers and directors.  This kind of rubbish will just not do at all. </P>
