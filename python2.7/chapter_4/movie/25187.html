"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Julien Temple's second swing at documenting the rise and fall of British
punk purveyors The Sex Pistols is a home run deep into the center field
bleachers. Hell, The Filth & The Fury is one of those moon shots that's
still going up when you finally lose sight of it – a legendary rip that
actually knocks the cover off the ball, leaving the rawhide wrapping to
float gently back down into the hands of a lucky kid that, God willing,
will one day be inspired to radically overhaul the crappy state of music
today. We're about due for another sweeping change – there was a
twenty-two year gap between Bill Haley and the Comets `(We're Gonna)
Rock Around the Clock' and the Pistols `God Save the Queen (She Ain't No
Human Being).' And it's been another twenty-two since the Pistols' song
hit number one (or, as shown in Fury, since it didn't hit number one).
Don't tell me that it's `Boy Bands,' either, because I'll legally
acquire an automatic rifle and pepper MTV's Times Square studio with
enough metal to turn Carson Daly into the Tin Man, I swear to God.</P>
<P>See – just talking about The Sex Pistols gets people riled up. In a
music world that was populated by the likes of Kansas, The Eagles and
Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols burst onto London's music scene at a time
when the country was mired in garbage strikes, lethally high
unemployment and race riots. The economically drained blue-collar
workers had little else to do than hate the upper class and the Royal
family, especially when wealth was flaunted right in front of their
faces (like seeing the Queen riding around in a gold carriage during her
Silver Jubilee celebration).</P>
<P>Filth is the third documentary about the Pistols, but the first to
really tell their story. Temple's first attempt was 1980's The Great
Rock ‘n' Roll Swindle (the second was a non-Temple film called D.O.A.).
When he began filming Swindle, Temple could never have predicted the
ending – the break-up of the band and the suicide of its enigmatic bass
player, Sid Vicious. Swindle told the story through maniacal manager
Malcolm McLaren's eyes (he even narrated the film). The film premiered
not long after Vicious' death, and the `swindle' in question, at least
according to McLaren, was the bilking of money by record companies, the
mindless youth of England and the actual members of the Pistols – all
from a craze that he pretty much implies that he started on his own.</P>
<P>In Filth (the film's title is taken from one of the many London tabloid
headlines about the Pistols), the story of the band's twenty-six-month
existence is told from the band's perspective. We learn about the
childhood of the band members - some things aren't surprising (broken
homes) and some are (Lydon was in a coma for a year). But it isn't long
before Johnny (Lydon) Rotten, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Glen Matlock
form the Pistols, and the band took off like a depraved, spitting
rocket, triggering a London politician to say that the band would be
"much improved by sudden death.' Imagine Asa Hutchinson saying something
like that about Limp Bizkit.</P>
<P>Temple's film, while an amazing visual and aural assault, doesn't hit
you over the head with a bunch of silly messages that point out the
obvious. He lets you discover the irony of a band rallying against
conformity, but unwittingly launching a fashion trend where everyone
dressed in similar torn shirts and black leather jackets. He tosses in
animated clips of the band and British television comedies, as well as
snippets of Laurence Olivier playing Richard III. Temple also bathes the
surviving members of the Pistols in shadows during their interview
sessions. It looks like they're in the witness protection program, but
after a while, you don't even notice it. At least not until Rotten/Lydon
starts to get weepy when he talks about Vicious' death.  McLaren is
interviewed, too, but he's wearing a bondage mask. And the only thing
that they can all seem to agree on is that Sid's girlfriend, Nancy
Spungen, was the most despicable person on the face of the Earth (see if
you can watch her and not think about Courtney Love).</P>
<P>Fury also includes all of the famous Pistol-related incidents that many
of you may have only heard about or seen tiny portions of. There's the
Bill Grundy television interview, the Thames performance in honor of Her
Majesty's Silver Jubilee celebration, and the band's final concert,
which consisted of just one song. The film also includes a very touching
post-Pistol breakup interview with Vicious, as well as appearances by
future stars Billy Idol, Siouxsie Sioux and Shane McGowan.</P>
<P>1:48 - R for pervasive strong language, drugs and sexual content</P>
