<PRE>Review: Dantes Peak (1997)</PRE>
<P>After sensing small amounts of seismic activity, the USGS (United States 
Geological Survey) send vulcanologist expert Harry Dalton (played by Pierce 
Brosnan) out on what they think is a routine discovery to the small town of 
Dante's Peak.  After finding a pair of skinny dippers dead in a creek next to 
the mountain, Dalton fears that a volcanic eruption is not far away.  
Suggesting the town should be put on alert, government experts doubt him but 
Dante's Peak mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) starts to believe him after 
more volcanic activity is found and the lives of her children are threatened.  
Desperately trying to convince everyone of his theory before its too late, 
disastrous consequences occur as the volcano finally blows its lid after a good 
hour into the film.  Now more of a race against time then anything else, Dalton 
must get himself and his companions to safety while attempting to pass little 
"obstacles" like an acid lake and a house surrounded by lava.</P>
<P>Pierse Brosnan's character Harry Dalton is the typical disaster movie hero - 
he's young, good looking, determined and has an on screen radience that can 
carry a movie.  Yet more importantly, Dalton has a very nifty talent for 
sensing when a volcano is about to erupt after a close friend and partner of 
his was killed in the opening scene.  Being surrounded by Rachel Wando and her 
two children gives a nice aspect of romance to the film, yet sometimes can be a 
little tedious as Pierce Brosnan can be often seen of as more of a fatherly 
character rather than a hero constantly running from eruptions.  But overall, 
Brosnan's performance is very well suited to the movie and gives Dante's Peak 
the boost it needs to be a successful action film.</P>
<P>For an area of disaster never really covered before, Dante's Peak does 
extremely well in providing realistic special effects cleverly produced by 
computer and digital technology and directed by Australian-born Roger 
Donaldson, who happens to be a geology major with a passion for vulcanology. 
However impressive Dante's Peak may be, if you are anxious for lots of java and 
volcanic activity (and not just flying rocks) I would probably suggest that you 
wait for Volcano, which is scheduled to be released later this year.</P>
