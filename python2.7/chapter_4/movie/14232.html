<P>Recently, over on the Official Star Wars website, a teaser poster was shown,
spoofing the makers of Godzilla, saying "Plot Does Matter"  This statement has
seemingly been ignored for the most part, by summer movie makers.  To me, this
means that you have a sensible, cohesive plot, it doesn't have to be the focus
of the movie (i.e. in action movies, something to hold the  scenes together
whether they be action( Lethal Weapon 4) or comedy (There's Something About
Mary), or even, heaven forbid, the main focus of the movie (Truman Show, X-
Files).  Plots this summer have been as absent as Steven Seagal at the Oscar
podium, so I have to admire and applaud a movie, that teases action, and
delivers, surprisingly, more plot than expected.</P>
<P>The previews for Mask of Zorro, led me to believe that this would be an
action- packed, excitement extravangaza, with the pairing of Banderas, and
Hopkins, showing promise.  What was delivered, was a bit different.  Yes, the
action scenes are there, and they work magnificently, the sword fighting is
well choregraphed, Banderas shows a true talent combination of agility,
comedy, and emotion, while his chemistry with Sir Hopkins, worked quite well.
 You believed that they were teacher/mentor, with each respecting, yet
needing the other. The chemistry between Banderas, and Jones works as well,
staging the most sensual swordfighting scene that I've ever witnessed, (not
that I've seen many, but this one was quite intense), and most of all,
everyone here, seemed to be having fun.  Sometimes you can tell, if actors
are enjoying what they're doing, or just sleepwalking through to get a
paycheck, the good guys, with their agendas, the bad guys, as the foils (you
can almost see Stuart Wilson twisting his moustache in a Snidely Whiplash
manner)</P>
<P>My misgivings about this movie, regard the apparent identity crisis existing.
The story of Zorro is fairly well known, and here, we are given an
interesting twist regarding them.  But we are then deluged with plot.  The
makers of this movie, in my opinion, tried to cram too much plot in here. 
The focus of Zorro is to fight for the people who cannot for themselves, and
the movie establishes that.  But then it becomes a bit convoluted in creating
reasons for each character to fight on.</P>
<P>I believe that the opportunity to make an fun, swashbuckling, action movie,
existed here, and, when they focus on that fact, it's exactly what this movie
is, it is fun, I do recommend it, I just think they could've either decided to
focus solely on the plot, developing, etc, or use a lighter plot, to hold and
transition the action scenes.  I applaud the effort of the plot, showing that
someone in Hollywood still cares, but I just feel it could've been a little
more effectively executed.  Take this one in at a matinee</P>
