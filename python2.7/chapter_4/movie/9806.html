A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Michael Caton-Jones</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Chuck Pfarrer (But actually a remake of the screenplay ‘The Day of the
Jackal' by Kenneth Ross)</PRE>
<P>Starring: Bruce Willis, Diane Venora, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Gatling gun, plot to kill a politician</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A hit man who goes by the name of ‘Jackal' (Bruce Willis) is hired to
kill a politician who is to make a speech from a podium in front of a
hospital. Instead of staking out a sniper position on a nearby building,
Jackal gets fancy. He flies to Quebec and purchases a giant Gatling gun
(a swiveling machine gun with several barrels that can fire thousands of
rounds a minute). Of course, as a foundation for the gun, he purchases a
super strong metal alloy stand and a minivan, plus special expensive
uranium bullets and a remote control computer device that enables him to
use his ball-point pen as a joystick. He also sprays special poison on
the door of the van in case anyone tries to get in. Finally, Jackal
purchases a yacht so he can sail the Gatling gun into the United States
undetected. Typical of the logic the authorities use to catch the Jackal
are statements like: "There's a 3000 mile border between Canada and the
US. The criminal could be anywhere! Hmm. Why don't we try checking the
Chicago Yacht Club?" So they send 30 agents to the yacht club, and sure
enough, there's the Jackal, and a gun battle ensues. Will the
authorities catch Jackal before he commits murder?</P>
<P>Opinion:
The writing often makes or breaks a movie. Good movies are able to
ensnare you in the plot, until you're on the edge of your seat and
committed to seeing the movie through to its conclusion. Not-so-good
movies consist of two or three action-packed scenes introduced by
irrational jumps in logic and connected by long stretches of pointless
wandering around. In ‘The Jackal' the talents of stars Poitier, Willis,
and Gere, and Venora are not enough to rescue a poorly written script,
although the two or three action scenes are good, if you can wait around
long enough for them.</P>
