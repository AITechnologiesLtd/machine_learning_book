<PRE>                             FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                       A film review by Michael Dequina
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Dequina</PRE>
<P>>From Dusk till Dawn (R) ***
        A jarring hybrid of tense psychological drama and campy, B-grade 
exploitation horror, director Robert Rodriguez and screenwriter Quentin 
Tarantino's From Dusk till Dawn is bizarre, bloody... and a blast.
        Roughly the first hour of the film is a riveting 
killers-on-the-lam psychodrama, with the treacherous Gecko brothers, the 
relatively level-headed Seth and paranoid, hotheaded sex offender Richard 
(George Clooney and Tarantino), fleeing the authorities 
following Richard's jailbreak of Seth and their subsequent killing 
spree.  The two take former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his 
daughter Kate and son Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) hostage, using 
the family's RV to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.  Once in Mexico, the group 
hole up at the Titty Twister, a seedy stripper bar, where Seth and Richard 
intend to rendezvous with an associate.
        Following a steamy table dance by one Santanica Pandemonium 
(Salma Hayek), From Dusk till Dawn abruptly shifts gears into a vampire 
thriller when all the dancers and a number of the bar patrons reveal 
themselves as bloodsuckers, with Santanica being the queen.  From here on 
out, the film is a gleefully bloody homage to B-grade horror films of the past
as the Gecko brothers and their hostages, with the aid of bar patrons Frost 
(Fred Williamson, doing a fun sendup of his image as a blaxploitation 
action icon) and Sex Machine (Tom Savini) fight for their lives.
        Tarantino has gone on record that he and Rodriguez intend to 
"offend sensibilities" with this film, and based on the reaction of some 
of the audience members with whom I saw the film (first show, opening 
day, of course), they have succeeded.  During the nearly hour-long 
bloodbath of a finale, a number of people walked out of the theatre.  
Seeing the film, it's easy to see how someone could be appalled by the 
carnage; however, it's done in such a pleasingly cartoonish manner that it 
can't be taken too seriously; one can't help but have fun with it.  
Rodriguez and Tarantino are well aware that for the second half, he's 
making a "balls-out exploitation flick" (albeit one with a top-flight 
cast), and the honest lack of pretensions is refreshing.  The filmmakers 
set forth a modest goal and make no bones about it.
        Tarantino especially also appears to have offended critics' 
sensibilities with the hybrid narrative, which has been the major 
criticism of the film (one person who had walked out, who had sat in front 
of me, appeared to have been a critic of some sort, for I could see him taking
notes during the film).  However, I feel that the leap from drama to 
horror is a justifiable one, and not just on the basis of audacity and 
cleverness and shock value--it works on a thematic level.  For the first part
of the film, we see the Fuller family being put through a metaphorical hell, 
and in the second half, it takes a tangible form in the Titty Twister, 
which, ironically, also entraps the creators of that hell, in effect, giving 
the Gecko brothers their ultimate comeuppance--a taste of their own medicine. 
Also, the vampires serve as Seth and Richard's true rendezvous; they come to 
the Titty Twister to meet with an associate, and the bloodthirsty monsters are
"associates" on a deeper, spiritual level.  The Gecko brothers in a sense 
are seeing a reflection of themselves, albeit an exaggeration akin to a 
reflection in a fun house mirror.  I know I'm grasping at straws, 
trying to find a subtext in a film that by all intents and purposes is
supposed to be a shallow trifle, but for those searching for a "logical" 
reason for the abrupt genre shift, it's there.
        Rodriguez brings his usual expert craftsmanship to the numerous 
action set pieces, but his usual quick cut razzle-dazzle appears to be 
softened for this film; in fact, he borrows a thing or two from the 
handbook of Tarantino, such as the now-familiar "looking out from the 
trunk" shot.  A clever touch was to include references to their 
previous works; the Big Kahuna Burger logo from Pulp Fiction is 
emblazoned on the fast food bags Seth carries, and a crotch cannon only 
seen in Desperado is actually put to use here.  And in keeping with the 
spirit of B-grade exploitation flicks, the makeup effects are good but 
not all that convincing; in fact, they are kind of overdone, which adds 
to the air of excess and unpretentiousness.
        Clooney reveals himself to be a bonafide screen presence with his 
intense portrayal of Seth.  While level-headed as a whole, one can see 
the fire in his eyes, the dangerous killer ready to erupt should the need 
arise.  He's captivating to watch.  Tarantino is also quite effective 
here; his rather innocuous-looking exterior works for the truly psychotic 
Richard--it makes him that much more frightening when he explodes into 
violence.  Keitel, despite a labored Southern accent, lends quiet dignity 
to his role, providing a cool relaxed anchor in reality when the story 
turns toward the fantastic.  The same goes for Lewis, who, as in Cape 
Fear, perfectly captures adolescent awkwardness and insecurity and makes 
Kate's tranformation into, as Tarantino says, a "badass" entirely 
believable.  Hayek is also memorable as the sexy Santanica, but her 
appearance is much too brief; and Cheech Marin is a scene-stealer in 
three different roles, especially as a sleazy guy by the name of, ahem, 
Chet Pussy.  The only one not turning in a decent performance is newcomer Liu,
who is adequate during the first half of the film but whose second-half 
emoting is quite amateurish.  Rodriguez made a similar gamble casting young 
unknowns for his segment in Four Rooms; while it paid off incredibly well 
there, it does not here.
        One's enjoyment of From Dusk till Dawn depends entirely on one's 
expectations going in.  Those expecting a straight action/horror vehicle 
(which the ads are making it out to be) will be disappointed.  However, 
anyone wanting to see an interesting marriage of two seemingly unlinkable 
genres and a fun tongue-in-cheek gorefest that both spoofs and celebrates 
the glories of B-grade exploitation vehicles are in for an entertaining 
treat.</P>

<PRE>ON THE HORIZON
FRIDAY</PRE>
<P>Bed of Roses (R)
        Storybook romance involving a workaholic banker (Mary Stuart 
Masterson) and a secret admirer (Christian Slater) who sends her 
elaborate flower arrangements.  The original title of this one was Amelia 
and the King of Plants, but I guess that was deemed too offbeat.  Slater 
proved he could pull off romance in the sweet Untamed Heart, but 
Masterson, whose romantic appeal eludes me, fizzled in the horrendous Benny 
and Joon, so the jury's out on this one.</P>
<P>Big Bully (PG)
        Tom Arnold is the bully of the title and Rick Moranis is his 
victim in this comedy delayed from last summer.  Never a good sign.  Also 
not a good sign is Arnold carrying a film.  Decent character actors do 
not always good leads make.</P>
<P>Screamers (R)
        Sci-fi thriller with Peter Weller battling killer alien 
"screamers" on a distant planet.  Sounds like nothing out of the ordinary 
in the sci-fi genre.</P>
<PRE>V I D E O
NEW THIS WEEK</PRE>
<P>Jade (R) ***
        Granted, this fixture of many worst lists is very misogynistic 
and doesn't make complete sense, but I think it is a fairly entertaining 
whodunit involving a DA (David Caruso), his ex-flame (Linda Fiorentino), 
and her husband (Chazz Palminteri).  The obvious shortcomings of Joe 
Eszterhas's script are made up for by the good performances and stylish 
direction by William Friedkin, who includes a great car chase here.  A 
guilty pleasure that isn't a bad rental choice.  (Paramount Home Video)</P>
<P>Waterworld (PG-13) **
        Nearly $200 million down the drain, and you get this 
astonishingly mediocre action wannabe-epic about a half-man, half-fish 
anti-hero (Kevin Costner) who aids a woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her 
adoptive daughter (Tina Majorino) search for the legendary dry land in a 
world completely covered in water.  The sets, stunts, costumes--none of 
it appears to justify the inflated budget.  Displaced director Kevin 
Reynolds proved he could make a rousing action spectacle with Robin 
Hood: Prince of Thieves, but Waterworld, being neither boring nor 
particularly exciting, just sits there, leaving no impact on the viewer.  
(MCA/Universal Home Video)</P>
<PRE>ALSO NEW THIS WEEK</PRE>
<P>Love and Human Remains (R)
        Canadian drama that chronicles the romantic travails of roommates 
(Thomas Gibson and Ruth Marshall) while a serial killer preying on women 
stalks the streets.  (Columbia TriStar Home Video)</P>
