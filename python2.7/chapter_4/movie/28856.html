<P> "I've heard that the best programmers in the world
can do this in 60 minutes. Unfortunately, I need
someone who can do it in 30 seconds. Go."</P>
<P>Starring Hugh Jackman, John Travolta, Halle Berry, Don
Cheadle. Directed by Dominic Sena. Rated R.</P>
<P>Swordfish begins as an involving heist/hacker thriller
and ends as a muddled, incoherent mess. The movie
ruins its interesting set-up and undermines it's
well-made action sequences by taking a twist too many.
It's full of actors and filmmakers who know what
they're doing, but they have dedicated themselves to
utter nonsense; even if it is, sometimes, guiltily
entertaining nonsense.</P>
<P>Right about here I would usually be giving the curious
among you the film's plot. I pause here, because I
don't know the film's plot. I can give you the set up:
Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) is a world-class hacker
who has retired from the trade and now endures a
pathetic existence, living in a trailer and longing to
see his daughter, who was taken away from him by his
vindictive ex. One day, as he's hitting golf balls off
the top of his makeshift abode, a beautiful woman
(Halle Berry) comes to see him. Apparently, her boss
Gabriel (John Travolta), a rich supercriminal, has
heard tell of Stanley's skills and wants to meet with
him. Stanley goes through the motions, refusing her
left and right, but inevitably goes. It turns out that
Gabriel wants Stanley to help him in a glorified
high-tech bank robbery, for a hefty share of the
profits.</P>
<P>Does that sound like the plot? Like I said, it's only
the set-up, and it's the only part of the movie that's
comprehensible or entertaining. Director Dominic Sena,
incompetent behind the camera of last year's Gone in
60 Seconds, here shows some flair for chase scenes and
action set pieces (the movie's money shot, in which a
camera slowly spins 360 degrees around an explosion in
slow motion, is almost worth the price of admission).
And Travolta, who hasn't made a good movie since A
Civil Action, still knows how to entertain; his
Gabriel is a fun villain for the film's first half.</P>
<P>And then someone decided that Swordfish needed to be
clever. Let's get something straight: well-executed,
competent genre movies are in just as short a supply
as genuinely original alternatives, and it's no shame
to make one of the former if the latter is beyond
one's reach (director Jonathan Mostow, he of Breakdown
and U-571, is building a solid reputation doing
exactly that). This might have been a wonderful movie
had it simply settled down and gotten itself
organized. If you can't execute a good plot twist,
don't do it.</P>
<P>Swordfish doesn't heed that advice. The good guys and
the bad guys switch places at least 526 times, and
after a while I gave up keeping track of who's who.
The ending itself is a total head-scratcher; I don't
want to give it away for those who somehow stay with
the movie, but suffice it to say that a certain
character should have died but miraculously (and there
doesn't seem to be any other explanation) didn't.</P>
<P>What the hell is the problem with a perfectly decent
heist movie? All the ingredients are here, but
Swordfish dumps half of them out. If you see it, see
it for Travolta, who goes back to being a "serious"
actor later this year with some sort of
child-in-jeopardy thriller, and feel free to leave
early. </P>
