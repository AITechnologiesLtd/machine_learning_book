<PRE>Deuce Bigalow:Male Gigolo (1999)
Rating: 2.0 stars out of 5.0 stars</PRE>
<P>Cast: Rob Schneider, Arija Bareikis, Eddie Griffin, William Forsythe,
Oded Fehr, Gail O'Grady, Richard Riehle, Amy Poehler, Chi Chi LaRue,
Norm Macdonald 
Written by: Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider 
Directed by: Mike Mitchell 
Running Time: 88 minutes </P>
<P>The first film produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production
company (clever title eh?) is essentially a one joke movie, much like
the movies Sandler stars in himself.  However the difference here is
that this one joke just isn't very funny.  </P>
<P>Rob Schneider stars as the title character, a scruffy fish tank cleaner
who ends up becoming a "man-whore" to raise enough money to replace a
wealthy client's custom made fish tank, which Deuce destroyed while
staying in his home.  Deuce goes on numerous "dates", and each woman he
goes out with has a "humorous" quirk about herself.  One has narcolepsy,
one has Tourette's Syndrome, one is a man... etc. etc.  My problem is
that we see all of these women in the film's trailer, so why do I need
to watch the movie?  Seen the trailer... seen the film.  Only a quick
cameo from Norm Macdonald (and a follow up joke during the closing
credits) generates any chuckles. </P>
<P>Deuce Bigalow:Male Gigolo is available on DVD from Touchstone Home Video
(a division of Di$ney).  The disc includes the film in its original
theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and features the original theatrical
trailer (as well as trailers for Mystery Alaska, Happy Texas, and
Outside Providence), an extremely brief production featurette (which
contains footage not used in the film), and storyboard-to-scene
comparisons. </P>
<P>Yep, you read that right... there are STORYBOARD comparisons on this
DVD.  Two scenes are storyboarded... neither of which are particularly
exciting.  There are fight scenes in this movie, so why aren't we seeing
storyboards of those segments (especially the parody moments from The
Matrix)?  I wonder what's funnier: the fact that any moment in this film
required storyboards or that Di$ney thought fans of this film would want
to see them?  Deleted scenes?  Sure.  Audio commentary?  You betcha. 
But storyboards?  Come on. [R]</P>
