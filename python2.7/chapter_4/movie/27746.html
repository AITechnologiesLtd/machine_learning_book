<PRE>Harry, Sally: You've been replaced.</PRE>
<P>One of the liveliest comedies to come along in a decade, When Brendan
Met Trudy is an imported riot that messes with the romantic comedy genre
in such a way that it might never recover.  And I mean that in a good
way.</P>
<P>An offbeat Irish film, When Brendan Met Trudy is at its heart a simple
love story between staid schoolteacher Brendan (Peter McDonald) and the
mysterious Trudy (Flora Montgomery).  Brendan, an enthusiast for the
church choir and old movies, encounters Trudy in a pub after choir
practice one night, and soon enough an awkward and budding romance is
born.  Trudy says she is a Montessori teacher, so wouldn't they be a
natural fit?  Surprise, Trudy soon reveals that not only is she not a
Montessori teacher, she's really a professional burglar, and wouldn't
Brendan like to prove his nascent love by coming along on some jobs?</P>
<P>In other words, it's a story we can all relate to: Duplicity and its
place in romance.</P>
<P>It's always difficult to write a movie review that explains in words how
funny a comedy can be.  I won't do it justice, but When Brendan Met
Trudy is simply hilarious, full of small touches that no mere mortal
should have been able to dream up.  After one of their many spats, a
panicked Brendan pretends he's been hit by a car and flops down into a
rain-filled gutter, hoping Trudy will take pity on him.  Of course, she
doesn't.  In a moment of triumph, we freeze-frame on Brendan as he leaps
into the air to click his heels.  The freeze-frame ends, and Brendan
crashes down to the earth, a mess.  It's all so funny because it's all
so unexpected, and rarely in my moviegoing career have I been so
surprised by the direction a film has shot off to with the turn of each
scene.  (Not to mention: Trudy has the funniest "so-and-so became a
such-and-such" denouement subtitle sequences since Animal House.)</P>
<P>The man to thank for this brilliance is screenwriter Roddy Doyle, also
responsible for such Irish classics as The Commitments, The Snapper, and
The Van.  Doyle is working in a bit less family-friendly milieu this
time out, and clearly he's let his imagination run wild.  Virtually
unknown director Kieron J. Walsh -- and his two leads -- shine
throughout the picture.</P>
<P>Sadly, Trudy would certainly merit an even higher rating if it weren't
so difficult to understand the dialogue.  The accents, Montgomery's in
particular, are extremely thick -- we're talking Trainspotting thick; I
screened the film on video and was constantly rewinding to pick up what
had just been said.  In several instances, I never could figure out the
punch line -- and a few jokes had to go by the wayside.</P>
<P>Ultimately, that's of little matter.  It's too bad this film wasn't out
in the States in time for Valentine's Day, because you aren't going to
see a better bit of romance all year.  (Add a star if you're a native of
Ireland.)</P>
