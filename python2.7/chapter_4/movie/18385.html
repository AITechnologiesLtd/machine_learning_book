WOMAN OF DESIRE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Among multitude of erotic thrillers, that had been released
in the early 1990s, WOMAN OF DESIRE is interesting only
because it was directed by Robert Ginty, star of the B-grade
action films of the previous decade. Those who tend not to
be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the
type of movies that made Ginty the star. As director, Ginty
did very little to improve that impression.</P>
<P>The protagonist of the movie is Jack (played by Jeff Fahey),
yacht skipper that falls madly in love with Christina Ford
(played by Bo Derek). However, she has relationship with
rich and powerful Jonathan Ashby (Steven Bauer). One stormy
night, the tragedy occurs and Jack is accused of rape and
murder. However, his good friend Walter J. Hill (Robert
Mitchum) happens to be very good lawyer, so Jack might even
prove his innocence in the end.</P>
<P>Belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic
thriller, WOMAN OF DESIRE distinguishes itself from similar
films by having almost all characters behaving like total
idiots. Unfortunately, this film isn't comedy and any laugh
is unintentional. The characters are totally antipathetic
and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to
them. The actors that play them don't help either. That is
especially the case with Jeff Fahey, whose Jack is so stupid
that even the character played by Fahey in LAWNMOWER MAN
looks like a genius in comparison. His partner Bo Derek, on
the other hand, shows that she didn't age enough to cease
being the sex goddess, but that is small compensation for
her apparent lack of acting talents. Ginty, on the other
hand, tries to bring some life in the movie by using many
flashbacks and strange angles of shooting, but in the end it
gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied
viewer.</P>
