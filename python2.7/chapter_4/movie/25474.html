<P>What we have here is one of the year's most difficult films -- from a film 
critic's point of view. "Jesus' Son" is effortless to watch and hard to 
recall. That was fine when I was in the cinema, but now I'm at the keyboard, 
trying to convince you to see it, and all I can recall is loosely tied 
together events, sections that seem wandered into and inexplicable decisions 
by the characters.</P>
<P>But that is as it should be. This is the story of a young man who starts out 
a wanderer and then becomes a drug addict. Neither of these phases could be 
said to have reason or meaning. Still they are hypnotic to watch.</P>
<P>We know the guy only as 'FH'. You can pretty much guess what that stands for. 
It rhymes with "duck bed". He and some other anonymous buddies, who shuffle 
around a small Midwestern town in the early 1970s, drift through houses, bars 
and other unofficial hangouts. At one of these, FH (Billy Crudup) meets 
Michelle (Samantha Morton), a fascinating, quiet, petite girl who soon takes 
him to bed for surprisingly tender lovemaking. The morning after, he finds 
her injecting heroin at the breakfast table. He has never seen anyone shoot 
up before, but seems curiously unaffected by it, is enough of a vacuum to try 
it for himself, and soon finds that the narcotic is running his life.</P>
<P>Up to and after this development, "Jesus' Son" refuses to adopt traditional 
story structure. It is as meandering as many of the films from the time in 
which it is set, and indeed has even been photographed in the cheaply crisp 
and colourful style of a thirty-year old road movie. Moments of tragedy and 
comic absurdity all unfold at the same pace, side by side, seen by the idle 
camera as they would be through FH's glazed eyes. There is a harrowing 
split-screen comparison of two junkies' overdoses resulting in different 
fates. A Jarmuschian moment in a hospital where two stoned orderlies deal 
with a patient complaining of "knife in the head". Psychedelic drug fantasies 
wander onto the screen without warning. And yet not once does the sound 
design louden, the pace of the editing quicken, or the camera swerve.</P>
<P>I'm not exactly praising the discipline of the director, Alison Maclean, but 
more her courage to let the material move so stubbornly. The amazing thing is 
that we don't notice the rigid construction -- Maclean's tactics work 
wonderfully, and we get involved in FH's haze. Billy Crudup is well cast in 
the role -- he has the gift of keeping his body language technically lifeless 
while always looking like he's about to speak. He convinces us that FH is 
going nowhere, but still lets us hope for him; his eyes and mouth achieve a 
weird limbo that suggest they may spring into action at any time.</P>
<P>Strange, then, that the third act of "Jesus' Son" doesn't work. This portion 
of the picture is easy to remember, because in boring us, it breaks the 
hypnotic spell of the earlier passages. The screenwriters try to let fresh 
air run into the story, as FH finds redemption; but Maclean keeps up the 
quirky, cloudy ambience. FH's life starts to flow, but the narrative doesn't, 
and it feels wrong to see the film's closing events portrayed with a lack of 
focus, because in them FH finally opens his eyes.</P>
