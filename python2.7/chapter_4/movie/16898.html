<P>Vincent and Thomas are not really friends, but they have a connection in
that Vincent's father Arnold (who left the family years ago) saved Thomas'
life in an accident that left him an orphan as an infant. When Vincent finds
out that his father has died in Arizona, miles away from the reservation in
Idaho, Thomas offers to give Vincent the money he needs to make the trip to
recover Arnold's possessions on the condition that he accompany Vincent. The
nerdy Thomas and the tough Vincent</P>
<P>This is a film that I wanted to like more than I did. The overall theme is
rather moving, and it is expressed quite well in the voice-over narration in
the final scene. However, in many places the film seems forced. When a film
chooses to present extreme situations to make a point, rather than using
subtlety, it is not making the audience feel for the characters, but rather
it is telling the audience what to feel for the characters. It is easier to
write melodrama than drama. Also adding to the forced feeling is the rather
stiff acting. I was often left feeling that I was watching actors rather
than associating with characters.</P>
<P>Despite its weaknesses, this is still an enjoyable film. It does showcase
many aspects of the modern American Indian experience. One example is the
presentation of oral storytelling tradition. The stories that several
characters tell play pivotal roles, and what is interesting about them is
that what is considered "truth" in the narrative. Instead of being a
accurate portrayal of events as they actually happened, they often have a
more symbolic meaning. Since this is billed as the first film to be written,
directed, and co-produced by a Native American, one feels comfortable that
one is learning about that subculture rather than being presented with the
usual, often distorted, image.</P>
<PRE>Moderately Recommended.</PRE>
