<PRE>ROUNDERS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>If Martha Stewart were to make Rounders, here's how she would do it. She
would take one serving of the movie Rocky. From that she'd take out
Sylvester Stalone, not cute enough for her. She'd also take out the boxing,
too violent for her. Then she'd add Matt Damon in place of Sylvester
Stalone, cute to her. Also she'd change boxing to poker. To make the film a
bit more attractive, we add some sugar and spice, Famke Janssen (GoldenEye)
and newcomer Gretchen Mol. Stir until there are no lumps, bake for two
hours, take out of the oven and let cool for another ten minutes.</P>
<P>Rounders, though it doesn't seem like it at first, is a typical sports
film. The protagonist, Mike McDermott (Damon), opens the film losing
everything he has to a master poker player, Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). He
then falls into a state of acceptance that what he'd done was all wrong.
That is, until some external force, this time a character named Worm
(Edward Norton), brings the protagonist back into the fringes of the sport.
In Rounders, it's poker, where he must go through an uphill battle to try
to regain his confidence in the sport. And in a typical sports film, in
order for the protagonist to regain his confidence he needs to face the
person he lost it all to in the beginning of the film.</P>
<P>Rounders shows us where real poker is played. Real poker is not played in
the glitzy casinos. No, real poker is played in smoky black rooms. Real
poker players can figure out what the other players's hands are doing just
by watching their reaction as they get their cards. Real poker is a game
where you can lose everything you have in a hand.</P>
<P>As formulaic as Rounders sounds, it's quite a good character study of the
two main characters, McDermott and Worm. McDermott is the guy who thinks
that he's escaped the draw and glitter of poker but really hasn't. Worm is
the risk-taking self-destructive character who could win it all straight,
but still cheats to win just for the thrill.</P>
<P>Damon, who seems almost typecast as the "smart normal guy" plays McDermott
not too differently than he did with Will Hunting (Good Will Hunting).
Which is not a bad thing, especially for Rounders. We feel for McDermott as
he gets dragged deeper and deeper into the underground poker rooms.</P>
<P>Norton, who was brilliant in Primal Fear, turns up another great
performance in Rounders. He plays his character Worm as an unpredictable,
self-loving, and self-destructive person who will risk even his life for a
thrill.</P>
<P>Newcomer Gretchen Mol isn't given much to do. She gets relegated to the
role of the whiny girlfriend who lives in a boring - and unneeded -
melodramatic subplot. Also the beautiful Famke Janssen is also given
nothing to do but to smile and walk around in alluring dresses.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is John Malkovich as Teddy KGB. Malkovich is just fun to
watch. His Teddy KGB likes to eat Oreo cookies, slowly chewing on them and
enjoying the cookies. Malkovich, like his Teddy KGB, likes to use his
Russian accent. He takes his Russian accent and slowly chews on it and
enjoys it. Malkovich steals the screen.</P>
<P>Director John Dahl keeps Rounders from sliding into boring seriousness by
slipping in some funny moments throughout the film. The humor keeps the
film moving. I loved how the poker players hit the casinos and play against
unsuspecting tourists. At the casinos, none of them are playing as allies,
but they still end up taking money from the tourists like candy from a baby.</P>
<P>The ending to Rounders is not hard to guess, especially given what kind of
film Rounders is. And it is the predictability of the film that makes it a
bit hard to sit through its running time. I wish the writers and film
makers would have taken a chance, a risk, like the poker players, and put
in a ending worthy of the film. I recommend Rounders if you have a spare
two hours to spend.</P>
