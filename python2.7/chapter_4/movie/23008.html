<P>Slightly amusing and totally innocuous, but ultimately troubled, The
Tigger Movie proves that even the almighty Disney can mess up a
children's film. No, its not as bad as the mess formally known as
Pokemon and the non-summer/non-Thanksgiving release date should act as
a tip off, but Pooh and company are capable of much more than this 74
minute blemish on the legendary Hundred-Acre Wood.</P>
<P>The rambunctious Tigger is looking for someone to go bouncing with
(after all, that's what Tiggers do best!) when he manages to test the
nerves of all his pals, especially Rabbit. As it becomes obvious that
no one can bounce quite like Tigger (although Roo, the kangaroo,
certainly does try), Rabbit sarcastically advises that Tigger find his
family and go bouncing with them.  Taking these words to a literal
extreme, our protagonist begins the search for his long-lost family.</P>
<P>What the movie does have going for it is the unforgettable qualities
of its characters. Winnie the Pooh is the innocent and well meaning
but intellectually challenged bear. Owl is the wise and
good-intentioned but ultimately insomnia-curing owl. Piglet is the
adorable little pig who is light as a feather. Eeyore is the sluggish
and self-unimportant donkey that is cursed with bad luck. Kanga is the
single mother that every kangaroo would love to have. And Tigger is,
well, Tigger is T-I-double guh-rrr, Tigger.</P>
<P>Unlike the recent family hit, Toy Story 2, The Tigger Movie has little
to offer on any level other than that appealing to its five-year-old
audience.  The one time anything multidimensional is attempted comes
when The Brady Bunch, Rodin's Thinker and other non-pre-school
references are made in a chorus-line production that sticks out like a
talking tiger in a Lethal Weapon movie.</P>
<P>One thing parents needn't worry about here are the morals portrayed;
they are all family-value oriented. Roo, the little kangaroo, has only
a single mother, Kanga. Tigger occupies and mentors Roo by taking him
along on his quest and teaching him things like the
whoopdidoopersuperlooperallilooper bounce. Roo, in turn, cares for
Tigger and tries to cheer him up when his voyage is looking dim.</P>
<P>Although the trait has become synonymous with Disney films, sappiness
prevails a little too much here. The normally cheerful humor of
Christopher Robin's pals is weighed down by slow-paced songs that
clearly exist to 1) try to bring the audience to tears and 2) sell a
lot of soundtracks.</P>
<P>As I was leaving the theatre after seeing this film, someone asked me
if I thought it was a classic. After all, many Disney animated
features achieve that status and Winnie the Pooh certainly has as
well. My answer was "no" and, probably because of the hereditary
higher standard this movie is held to, that means it is a failure.</P>
