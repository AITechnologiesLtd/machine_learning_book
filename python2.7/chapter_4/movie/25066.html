<PRE>LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST
--------------------</PRE>
<P>Kenneth Branagh brings his fourth Shakespearean adaptation to the screen
with a twist - the frothy play, "Love's Labour's Lost" is set just as
World War II is dawning and set to the music of the Gershwin brothers and
Irving Berling, as much an homage to old movies as to Shakespeare.</P>
<P>The King (Alessandro Nivola, "Face/Off") decides to devote himself to years
of study, banning wine, women and song from his palace grounds.  His three
best friends, Berowne (Branagh), Longaville (Matthew Lillard, "Scream") and
Dumaine (Adrian Lester, "Primary Colors") aren't thrilled, but respect their
king in a pact that will soon be broken when the French princess (Alicia
Silverstone, "Clueless") and her ladies Rosaline (Natascha McElhone, "Ronin"),
Maria (Carmen Ejogo, "The Avengers") and Katherine (Emily Mortimer, "Scream 3")
pays a political visit for her father.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Branagh's proven very adept at translating the bard to the screen as period
pieces, so it's invigorating to see him try something different and
unequivocally nail it.</P>
<P>His screenplay adaptation deftly jumps the action of Shakespeare's light 
tale forward with song and dance numbers set to standards such as
"I Get No Kick from Champagne," "The Way You Look Tonight," "I'm in Heaven,"
and "You Can't Take That Away From Me"  The story is simple:  when the 
ladies appear, the King allows them to set up camp outside the palace gates 
where one by one they pair off with the kings' men until the King himself 
succombs to the princess.  The men try to keep their affairs secret from one 
another (Branagh stages a truly brilliant scene in the King's library for
them all to discover each others' dishonesty) while letters get into the wrong 
hands and the ladies switch identities to give the men their comeuppance.  
Word is sent that the King of France has died and the princess is distraught, 
declares the love matches mere flirtations and announces she and her ladies 
will depart.  The king proposes a one year enforced separation to test their 
loves after which they all live happily ever after.</P>
<P>Casting is brilliantly insane (two veterans from the "Scream" franchise?!).  
Branagh and McElhone are actually the preeminent couple and he allows her to 
shine as perhaps the most mature and womanly of the four ladies.  Silverstone 
is engagingly kewpie-dollish, delivering her lines with a petulant, baby doll 
pout, but becoming serious when circumstance demands.  Her man, Nivola, is 
handsome and dashing and funny, acting as if he'd stepped right out of a 30's 
screwball comedy.  Lester is fantastic with the dance moves, suggesting no less 
than Donald O'Connor's work in "Singin' in the Rain.  Lillard is surprisingly 
agile,putting a touch of slapstick in his long limbs even as he retains control
of his moves.  Their loves, Mortimer and Ejogo respectively, keep pace,
but don't get as much opportunity to develop their characters (it's also
neat that Branagh chose to racially crisscross these two couples).</P>
<P>Other lovers are afoot as well, from the hilariously over the top Timothy
Spall (Leighs' recent films) as Don Armado who pines for the country wench
Jaquenetta (Stefania Rocca, "The Talented Mr. Ripley").  He trips about on
tiny feet before launching into one of the most fantastical set pieces where
he even gets to perform aerial stunts in a biplane!  The king's
professors, Holofernia (Geraldine McEwan, "The Love Letter") and
Nathaniel (Richard Briers, Branagh's "Hamlet") represent the senior set,
albeit capped and gowned ones.  Nathan Lane is The Great Costard, a vaudevilian 
who is the agent of crossed wires, while Richard Clifford (Branagh's "Much Ado 
About Nothing") is Boyet, the ladies' 'old lovemonger.'</P>
<P>Branagh's love of old films is shown in dance numbers which mimic
Astaire and Rogers, Esther Williams, the June Taylor dancers and
even Bob Fosse, while non-dancing scenes recall the likes of "Casblanca" and 
the Marx Brothers.  Production design (Tim Harvey) and art direction (Mark 
Raggett) are superb, using muted colors and obvious set bound fakery to both 
mimic old films and throw the players into the spotlight.  Costumes (Anna 
Buruma) are gorgeous, particularly the four ladies' color themed ensembles in 
red (Silverstone), blue (McElhone), orange (Ejogo) and green (Mortimer).</P>
<P>This thoroughly delightful entertainment is presented by Stanley Donen and
Martin Scorsese - high praise indeed.  This is one to remember for this year's 
award nominations, and should bring a smile to any film lover's face.</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>It's the Bard meets Busby Berkeley as director Kenneth Branagh adapts
Shakespeare, this time with "Love's Labour's Lost," for the big screen, but
with an unconventional twist. Branagh stages his version of the play as a lush,
lively musical that pays as much homage to the classic musical extravaganzas of
1930's as it does to Will S.</P>
<P>It's 1939 and the King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) swears an oath with his
three best friends to forsake the company of woman for three years so the
quartet may devote themselves to the lofty study of philosophy. This plan is
thrown into complete disarray with the arrival of the Princess of France
(Alicia Silverstone) and her three beautiful attendants.
The men are smitten by the beauty and charm of the women and each, secretly,
seeks to seduce his beloved. Eventually, all four men realize that each has
betrayed their sacred oath, but recover from the disappointment as they fall
for the magic of love.</P>
<P>Branagh takes one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays and puts his own
imaginative spin on the subject. Besides setting the play in a fictional
European kingdom at the brink of World War II, he introduces the music of the
era as a key element of the story. Salted throughout the film's runtime are all
manner of dance numbers that honor the stylish choreography of Busby Berkeley's
colorful musicals (the original "42nd Street," "The Gold Diggers of 1933"). The
classic overhead shots of pretty, geometrically placed young women are reprised
in the new film, even including a nod to the Ester Williams waterlogged
musicals that carried Berkeley's signature style into the 40's.</P>
<P>Accompanying the flashy dance numbers that Branagh and choreographer Stuart
Hopps so lovingly create is a litany of songs that capture the spirit put forth
by the film's creators. Such musical maestros as George and Ira Gershwin, Cole
Porter, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern were selected to supply the wonderful
tunes used for the numerous, flashy dance numbers. Branagh's choice of such
seminal song and dance numbers as "I Get A Kick Out of You," "Cheek to Cheek,"
"Let's Face the Music & Dance," and other great songs had me whistling for days
after seeing "Love's Labour's Lost." The songs are the best part of the film.</P>
<P>Where "Love's Labour's Lost" is problematic is in Branagh's attempt to mix
genres. The music is great. The dance numbers, utilizing actors rather than
singers/dancers, are done with great enthusiasm by the players, but with uneven
results. Everyone works very hard, but only a couple of the principles look the
look of hoofers. Adrian Lester (playing the King's friend Dumaine) has a
background that includes a variety of stage and screen musicals and it shows in
his graceful execution of his dance numbers. Nathan Lane ("The Birdcage") shows
his Broadway chops in his performance as Costard the Clown, recreating the
moves of a true vaudevillian. Of the rest of the amateur dancers, Branagh shows 
the most grace as the King's trusted friend, Berowne, working harder than 
anyone does in his effort at being Fred Astaire. The rest of the cast give 
their all, but come across as enthusiastic and plucky non-professionals.</P>
<P>The crossover between the musical interludes and the straight Shakespearean
dialogue doesn't flow well. The almost abrupt way the dance numbers, with their
30's lyrics, ends and the "But, hark" of Shakespeare's lingo kicks in is
distracting. Branagh has a firm enough grasp of the Bard's work that his
delivery is fine. The rest, though, fare lass well. Alicia Silverstone, in her
big speech near the end, is wooden and unconvincing. She delivers her lines
like she's reciting them, without passion. Natascha McElhone is pretty and 
charming as Berowne's love interest, Rosaline. Of the rest of the ensemble 
cast, only Timothy Spall ("Topsy-Turvy") fares well as the outrageously 
accented Spaniard who considers himself a loyal friend to the king.
Costume design, by Anna Buruma (who, coincidentally, once worked at the Chamber
of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's) has a sweet continuity as each of les dames has
her own color scheme with red, blue, green and peach as the primary color for
their costumes. The scheme is carried through not only with the many different
outfits of each, but with accessories, too, including the boutonni
hres of the suitor and even the ladies' cocktails. It helps you keep track of 
who loves whom, too. Production design, by Tim Harvey, a long time 
collaborator with Branagh, provides suitable period feel.</P>
<P>In the end, "Love's Labour's Lost" feels derivative of Woody Allen's "Everyone
Says I Love You," but with the Bard's work as the subject matter. Branagh's
oeuvre has more to it when it comes to song and dance and less in the overall
execution. The musical numbers, alone, are worth the price of admission and I
give it a B.</P>
