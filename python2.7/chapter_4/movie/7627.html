<PRE>                             THE BABY OF MACON
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A vitriolic and razor-sharp attack on
          Catholic theology, this film was never even
          released in the United States until now.  What may
          be a second Messiah is born in the 17th Century in
          a time of pestilence.  The ignorance of the people
          and the Church turn the event into a far worse
          disaster.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4), 7 (0 to 10)</PRE>
<P>     I think I always have one of two reactions to Peter Greenaway
films.  Either I dislike the film or I like it but feel it is un-
recommendable.  In the latter category were THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS
WIFE, AND HER LOVER and PROSPERO'S BOOKS.  His BABY OF MACON [there is
a circumflex over the "a" in "Macon"] also falls into that category,
but I do not have to worry about people not liking it as much as I did,
at least in the United States.  It was considered either so
controversial, so revolting, or both, that it just never found a United
States distributor.</P>
<P>     More than usual with a Greenaway film, it is difficult to tell
exactly what is going on.  Presumably the story is of a play being
performed and/or set at the 17th Century Court of the Medici--it is
hard to tell which since events in and out of the play seem to blend
together.  As would have pleased Philip K. Dick, how many levels of
play-within-play there are is impossible to determine.  The story is a
sort of burlesque of the birth of a new Messiah, twisting as many of
the traditional Catholic symbols as possible.  It is a time of multiple
pestilence's and all the women of the region are sterile.  When an
obese old hag actually succeeds in giving birth to a beautiful baby,
the local women see it as a miraculous birth, even to the point of
asking for the baby's spit to use as an elixir.  The baby's sister
(played by Julia Ormond), sees a good thing and claims the baby as her
own child and "proves" the birth to be miraculous by proving she is
still a virgin.  The son of the Bishop (Ralph Fiennes) is a scientist
and a skeptic who does not believe in the purported new Messiah and in
trying to disprove the ersatz Virgin Mary is pulled into the symbolism
as a latter-day Joseph.  As Ormand's character tells him, "Too many
proofs spoil the truth."</P>
<P>     Somehow all this does not convey the throat-biting viciousness of
this satire.  By any objective measure, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST
was by comparison a gentle and reverent jibe.  Greenaway is a Howard
Stern for intellectuals and he keeps revealing that he has stores of
untapped acid and bile still in him.  While he has a right to express
himself as he wishes, I think if I were Catholic I would be very
uncomfortable with this film.  As interesting as THE BABY OF MACON is,
Greenaway makes it a real trial to sit through.  He uses a stodgy,
mock-neo-classical, dry style that sucks the interest out of a scene
like fluids out of a baby.  It is hard to imagine another director who
could make so dull a scene that features full- frontal nudity from both
Ormond and Fiennes.  Perhaps the reason Greenaway gets away putting so
much nudity in is films is that in doing so he completely sidesteps
eroticism.</P>
<P>     The production design skillfully makes each frame fascinating
while at the same time making so many full scenes seem endless.  This
film had four reasonable endings and gave the impression of finishing
all afternoon.  Greenaway often tries to build to a sort of twist
ending, but here the twist is much more expected than it was in THE
COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER.  Fans of Masterpiece Theater
in the 1960s will no doubt recognize the main musical theme as well as
an unsurprising plot twist near the end.</P>
<P>     Julia Ormond could well prove herself the Ingrid Bergman of her
generation.  Like Bergman she is a B+ actress with an A+ screen charm,
even in what is in this case a rather detestable role.  Ralph Fiennes,
on the other hand, completely submerges his ENGLISH PATIENT charm and
plays the rather pasty-faced son of the Bishop.  The Bishop,
incidentally, is played by veteran actor Philip Stone.  I first noticed
Stone in UNEARTHLY STRANGER, a great (but sadly now very rare) science
fiction film from 1963.  It is good to see him still acting.</P>
<P>     The best Greenaway film is really a mixed bag of quality, and this
one is more mixed than most.  I would give THE BABY OF MACON a low +2
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
