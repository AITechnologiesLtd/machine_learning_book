<PRE>TITANIC
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio; Kate Winslet; Billy Zane & Kathy Bates</P>
<P>So the question is -- is this the greatest movie of all time? Well, it's
certainly the most successful. Maybe not the best movie of all time in my
books, although I would have to say it comes pretty darn close. That's quite
an admission coming from me, since I've never seen a love story that I
didn't hate or fall asleep before the 1 hour mark. Titanic is just that a
love story, even with the multimillion dollar sets and special effects, it
is just a movie about the love two young passengers have for one another. I
will have to admit, as love stories go, this was a very compelling one.
Certainly, the best one I've ever seen. Although I still can't figure out
what all the excitement is about regarding Leonardo DiCaprio. I guess I
would have to be a teenage girl to figure out that one, but I digress. I
went to see titanic not for the love story (I planned on tolerating it) but
for the special effects. Believe it or not I actually found my cold-hearted
self actually enjoying the romance between Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio)
and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While, as I've already said, I don't
see what the fuss is over Leo, after seeing this film I couldn't imagine it
being made with actors other than DiCaprio and Winslet in the lead roles. A
fact that I think speaks volumes about their performances. There was truly
no doubt, in my little mind at least, that by the end of the movie the
characters of Jack and Rose were deeply in love. Heck, I actually even
started to care about their romance. (I think I'm getting too soft.)</P>
<P>Anyway, as they say, time flies when your having fun, and since I went to
see the special effects, that is what I wanted to see. Now to get off topic
for just a second, I was one of those who asked the burning questions before
the movie came out. Who in their right mind spends 200 million dollars to
make a film? Better yet on a film that everybody knows the ending to? If you
are crazy enough to spend such huge amounts of cash, why wouldn't you cast
some big name actors in the lead roles, so we the audience would have some
reason to go? A whole lot of people asked those same questions. If they are
anything like me, after seeing Titanic they had to ask themselves -- Why
would I have ever asked such stupid questions? Why? Well, because critics
are not filmmakers, and while we like to comment on films, and are
relatively knowledgeable on the subject, for the most part we don't know as
much as the people who make them. This is abundantly true with regard to
Titanic's director James Cameron. The same man who many considered would be
run out of Hollywood just a few short months before the film opened, is now
being recognized as being among the greatest directors of all time. I really
don't think that anyone can say enough about the job that this guy did.</P>
<P>This brings me back around to the reason I went to see this film -- the
special effects. The movie opens with breathtaking shots of the real Titanic
on the bottom of the Atlantic, shot specifically for this film by director
James Cameron. Although that almost pales by comparison to the special
effects used during the last half of the movie as the ship is sinking. The
200 million dollar price tag is certainly evident on the screen. Both in the
long shots where we get to see the great ship break up, and in the interior
shots that were done in giant flooded tanks. If, like me, you go to Titanic
for the special effects, I promise you will not be disappointed by anything
that appears on the screen.</P>
<P>A funny thing happened as I was watching the Titanic in its final minutes
above the water. As much as I was in awe of the effects, and the complexity
of the production, something else happened. An eerie feeling came over me.
Unlike other disaster movies, this one really happened. All too often, when
we think of the real Titanic sitting there on the bottom of the ocean, we
forget something. Oh, we remember the tragedy of the situation and that hund
reds of lives were lost, but most of us never stop to think what it must
have like to be there on that ship as it was going down. James Cameron has
captured those last moments, in a way that will make you think wonder why
you never thought about it like that before.</P>
<P>As spectacular as the special effects were, they could not overshadow a
simple love story and the tragedy associated with one of the worst disasters
of all time. A truly remarkable film, it is no wonder that so many people
have gone back to this masterpiece several times.</P>
<P>One of the greatest films ever made.  10/10 - I would give it a higher
rating if I had one.</P>
