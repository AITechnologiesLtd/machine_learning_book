<P>starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley
screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar
directed by Tom Dey</P>
<P>The level of humour never rises above that of its title in Shanghai
Noon, a play-on-words that "Mad Magazine" staffers surely brainstormed
at some point, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The picture is so
juvenile it makes the 1985 western spoof Rustler's Rhapsody look
pretentious by comparison, which is a major selling point in my book,
for comedies these days tend to be cynical, scatological affairs--in
short, Porky's redux, everything but good-natured.</P>
<P>If its innocuousness ultimately earns Shanghai Noon the dreaded label of
"family entertainment", so be it. (Here is what I scribbled on a piece
of paper after seeing the film: "Jackie Chan's doing his thang and it
comes off as downright innovative in light of crap like Road Trip.")</P>
<P>The year is 1881, and Jackie Chan plays Chong Wang, one of the Imperial
Guards ordered to deliver the ransom for kidnapped Princess Pei Pei and
retrieve her from the Chinese mining camps of Carson City, Nevada. En
route in America, his uncle is killed in a train robbery that leaves
Jackie stranded and in the company of laconic cowpoke Roy O'Bannon (Owen
Wilson), the "good" thief who had no part in the homicide. I'm getting
ahead of myself: before they join forces, Jackie defeats armed Crow
warriors with his bare hands and marries into an Indian tribe.</P>
<P>There's fortune in Roy's eyes as Wang (whose full name sounds like John
Wayne, "a terrible cowboy name!" exclaims Roy) tells him of the 100 000
in gold coins waiting to be exchanged for the princess, and so he
volunteers to set our Jackie on course and instruct him in the way of
the West. (I won't belabour that Shanghai Noon glibly trumpets
assimilation over tradition--the movie sides with Roy as he encourages
Wang to abandon his Eastern code of ethics--but let it be duly noted.)
Soon, they have not so much hatched a plot as stumbled upon one to free
Pei Pei, leading to a whopper of a Mexican standoff in a church. (Shades
of John Woo.)</P>
<P>Speaking of Woo, he had the right idea when he commented in a recent
interview for "Premiere", "Some actors are good in slow motion, some
not. Some you want to see them fast, like Jackie Chan: Pow! Pow! Pow!
That's his real character. He's just like a tiger. There's no reason to
use slow motion." About the only directorial misstep first-timer Tom Dey
makes in the requisite fight scenes (the first reason to see any Jackie
Chan flick) is the occasional half-speed flourish--untrained fighters
require camera tricks to appear graceful (would Ralph Macchio have
gotten by in The Karate Kid without them?), but not Jackie Chan, Jet Li,
Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, etc.</P>
<P>As with Jackie's other English-language pictures (and the American
versions of his Hong Kong exports), the big, prop-dependent brawls could
and should be longer, though this time around their brevity might be on
account of Jackie's age and not studio ignorance. (Miramax, from what I
understand, is under the impression that we prefer car chases and big
stunts to martial arts combat--that's why they recut Operation Condor to
emphasize grandiose action over the kung fu, nearly invalidating the
presence of Jackie in the process.)</P>
<P>Otherwise, Dey has crafted a tasty matinee snack; if Shanghai Noon
doesn't have any lasting impact, it won't cause indigestion, either. The
amusingly anachronistic and nonconfrontational screenplay--the film owes
great debts to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Blazing
Saddles--occasionally goes slack (as to be expected from the writers of
the meandering Lethal Weapon 4), but Dey and his cannily cast performers
always find their footing. Owen Wilson, possessed of a warm, soothing
drawl, is the most charmingly goofball he's been since debuting in
Bottle Rocket. Nimble Jackie seems much more at ease with him than he
was with abrasive Chris Tucker in the excremental Rush Hour. And Lucy
Liu, as the prototypical Jackie Chan heroine/damsel in distress, is
adequately regal and sexy. Okay, fine, really sexy.</P>
