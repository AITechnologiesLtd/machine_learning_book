<P>Those whose Latin extends beyond  "E Pluribus Unum" might just remember
"homo homini lupus" (man is a wolf to man). That's what the first part of
"La Promesse" tells us. But it is followed by " homo homini agnus" (man is
a lamb to man). At least that's my reading of the third feature by the
Belgian Dardenne brothers.</P>
<P>The movie, premiered in a parallel section of the 1996 Cannes Festival, has
been highly praised by American reviewers. It is mostly  set in or near the
city of Liege (Belgium). It is essentially a two plus two character drama.
The first duo consists of young Igor and his father Roger. Igor is 15 -- as
per information I gleaned in various documents. (The film proper is rather
frustratingly vague about times, places and other factual information). The
boy, already a heavy smoker and beer guzzler, but still a virgin, is
something of a Peeping Tom, works in a gas station as an apprentice
mechanic. He swipes the customers' wallets and shows up at the station
fitfully --which results in his dismissal.</P>
<P>Igor is his father's main helper in an illegal operation of  illegal
immigrant workers, African, Eastern European, Korean, etc., whom the ring,
for a high price, spirits into Belgium hidden inside automobiles carries on
car-transport vehicles. Then Roger, charging outrageously again, gets the
immigrants fake papers and houses them  in stinking, disgusting hovels
within decrepit buildings.</P>
<P>The traffickers know no decency. When, for example, there is political
pressure on the gang, the operators sacrifice some of the aliens by
pretending they'll be sent to America (after due payment), but betray them
to the authorities.</P>
<P>The story then focuses on an African couple (Amidou and Assita) and their
baby. Amidou, working for Roger, falls off a scaffolding and dies, but not
before exacting from Igor the promise that he will watch over Assita and
her child.  Since the body would cause an investigation, father and son
dispose of it by burial in concrete.</P>
<P>(It was unclear to me whether or not Amidou might have survived if taken to
a hospital -- which Roger refused to do as unsafe for his business. So
Amidou's death, may have to a killing by omission).</P>
<P>The man's death is not revealed to his wife. She is told instead that
Amidou had disappeared, run off perhaps to avoid paying debts. Roger now
tries to get rid of Assita by sending her to nearby Cologne (Germany) where
he would arrange for the woman to work as a prostitute.</P>
<P>About 40 minutes into the movie, Igor begins to feel pangs of guilt that
keep increasing.  He defies his father and attempts to come to the woman's
help. The process of a rising conscience and consciousness takes up the
rest of the film. It is intermingled with some local touches of racism and
xenophobia.</P>
<P>The entire process is filmed like a documentary, with a constantly mobile,
moving  and often handheld camera. There is obviously a desire by the
filmmakers to keep a realistic look and tone, which is understandable and
adds power to the movie.  This technique is valid in principle. It
distances the work from the smooth and slick Hollywood-type films. But it
often goes overboard and could induce fatigue in the viewers.  A modicum of
using the Steadycam system might have helped. ( This gyroscope-like method,
introduced in the mid-70s, puts a special harness on the operator and
allows moving the machine without jiggling).</P>
<P>The episodes are done with naturalness, economical dialogue and no
traditional  verbal elaboration. The burden is on telling details, on
implications and on the facial expressions of the performers.  Roger, and
above all Igor, acquit themselves nicely, with the latter's gradual
transformation following a credible development.</P>
<P>"La Promesse" is as far as one can go from commercial movies. It is
well-meaning but also well-handled, never showing any traces of glop,
sentimentalizing or romanticizing. Among its virtues is that if you imagine
that this subject had been filmed in routine ways, it might have made of
Assita a colorful --perhaps even wise -- character. Here, she is rather
attractive but, like her drab surroundings, a sad figure. In a good touch,
to find out if her husband is alive or dead, she consults the entrails of a
chicken and later is taken by an older African lady to a  witch doctor.</P>
<P>Both Assita and Amidou come from Burkina Faso (the former Upper Volta), a
small, poor country where, surprisingly, there is Africa's greatest ferment
of movie-making, partly encouraged by the regular Pan African festivals in
Ouagadougou, the capital. Director Idrissa Ouedraogo, a winner of major
awards (e.g. at Cannes) is widely known internationally.</P>
<P>Their real family names of Assita and Amidou are also Ouedraogo. It must be
Burkina Faso's equivalent of Smith or Jones or else Idrissa's dozens of
relatives have made it in cinema. A year or two ago, when Idrissa's latest
film was shown at the Cannes Festival, the credits had such an unending
list of Ouedraogos that at the press screening the critics kept bursting
into laughter exponentially.</P>
