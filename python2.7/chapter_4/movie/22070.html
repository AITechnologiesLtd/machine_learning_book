<P>THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC</P>
<P>Milla J., stick to the singing career.</P>
<P>Luc Besson, imaginative mind behind such notable works of art such as
The Professional, La Femme Nikita, and The Big Blue, has created such a
memorable mess of things with his newest release, The Messenger.  A car
crash of a movie headed straight for the Days of Heaven territory.</P>
<P>Joan of Arc, one of the most pinnacle figures of French history, has
been reduced to a crazy chick with a God complex unseen since Alec
Baldwin in Malice.  Luc, put down the Braveheart script and try to write
something interested and not convoluted like bad matinee popcorn that
sticks in a person's teeth. Also, the last thing I need in a movie is
Faye Dunaway doing her Mommie Dearest impression for the 56th time.</P>
<P>I wanted to understand the complexity of Joan of Arc's character - her
trepidation in confirming her personal beliefs, her fears of battle and
violence, her faith in God and country, her ability to stay so DAMN
ravishing during battle - I really do.  I DO!  But I just can't.  I just
didn't want to after the first fifteen minutes. Besson's inability of
winding together a cohesive plot structure and creating emotional
connection to the main characters is the main cause for the downfall of
the film.  When Joan is faced with the dilemmas of conviction and
execution of her leadership role, I am wondering what time I can get
home to watch the hockey highlights.</P>
<P>On the positive side, the cinematography is amazing, the set and costume
designs are impressive beyond words, and the battle scenes are notable
but unfocused.  One bright star in the cloudy sky is Tcheky Karyo, star
of La Femme Nikita and GoldenEye, who provides concrete battle ideals
that mesh together with Joan's abstract leadership ideals.  At least
Besson can rescue him from such films as Wing Commander.</P>
<P>Where are you Jean Reno, when we need you the most?</P>
<PRE>2.5 stars</PRE>
