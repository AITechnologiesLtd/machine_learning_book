<P>The Monday morning post-mortems about why, in the 1999 Oscars, Best Picture
went to Shakespeare in Love and not to Saving Private Ryan, produced some
good guesses.Among them, that the many academy voters who saw Ryan on home
video were not watching the real thing, since Ryan absolutely requires a
large screen.</P>
<P>This also applies to many a movie. So please see The General now, in a
theater.</P>
<P>Made by London-born Englishman John Boorman in his beloved Ireland,where he
lived for some 25 years, The General ranks with his best:  Point Blank ,
Deliverance,  Excalibur, The Emerald Forest, Hope and Glory, Beyond Rangoon.</P>
<P>It is about a major malefactor and his life. Martin Cahill really did exist
in Dublin. His c.v. runs like a catalogue of crime.He was a thief, a
suspected killer, a libertine, a bigamist, a weird art-loving collector who
stole paintings, a perpetrator of much else, all of it illegal.</P>
<P>His disdain for authority was monumental. It included the law, the
authorities, the English, even the Church (which for an Irishman is
anomalous). Hubristically, he defied the power of the police and, better
yet (or as turns out, worse for him), he challenged the might of the IRA.</P>
<P>The film takes Cahill from his assasination to his assassination, as this
event frames the movie. It  segues with just parts of his life story,
starting with the childhood of a preternaturally gifted, audacious and
self-controlled young thief. Cahill the adult is played by Brendan Gleeson
who is said to look uncannily like his model.</P>
<P>Gleeson-Cahill has a potato face and a potato-sack body, which ought not to
be derogatory terms in spud-loving Ireland. As conceived and performed he
makes us sidestep both our potentially romantic views and our indignation.
The picture lets us have our ups and downs in evaluating Martin, who could
be a vulgar but friendly teddy bear one moment, a crass torturer the next.</P>
<P>He became a celebrity in Ireland.The myth around him was often that of a
modern Robin Hood, which he decidedly was not. He may have given some money
way, but not on any large scale. But he certainly was a robbin' hood.</P>
<P>Boorman falls neither for the cliches nor for the conventions of the
gangster film genre. The General is a Thoroughly Modern Movie in every
aspect: conception, construction, editing, camera-work and all. But not of
the kind that shouts "modernism!" and tries to impress you with its
techniques. The techniques are there, but unshowy and clearly harking back
to Boorman's early period as a first-rate director of fifty-plus
documentaries for the BBC.</P>
<P>As an individual, and especially as the leader and brains of a gang, Cahill
was -- and remains on celluloid-- an amazing tactician. He plans and plots
cleverly and minutely, he thinks on his feet, improvises, makes instant
decisions, never loses his cool. He is so brazen that the word could have
been invented for him.  His brazenness may well have been his best weapon.</P>
<P>Scorning all that's scornable, the only thing he did not do was to thumb
his nose, literally, in courts or police stations. This, because in his
public appearances, he favored wearing hooded coats and spreading his hands
over his face, as though this would make him The Invisible Thug. Those
peculiarities add a kind of childish naivete to the man, although my better
guess is that they were his ways to avoid showing his true reactions, those
facial expressions that might have worsened his case.</P>
<P>Brendan Gleeson is the sort of  superbly skilled realistic actor that you
do not watch him as a thespian but as the character he lives, lives in, and
portrays. John Voight, Boorman's old friend from Deliverance, sports an
Irish accent that sounds genuine -- at least to American ears-- as he plays
(very well)  police inspector Ned Kenny whose Holy Grail was to get Cahill.
Somewhere, someone compared Kenny to the French Inspector Javert who
hounded Jean Valjean in Les Miserables. Not so.There is no cruelty, no
villainy about Kenny, and no innocence about Cahill.</P>
<P>The film is elliptical. Not to the point of confusing you but to the point
of asking for concentration. This task is sometimes arduous given the often
undecipherable accents. At  the Cannes Festival where I first saw the
picture, American critics who could not read the French subtitles were
often puzzled by the dialogue. For example, some people were confused by
Cahill's marital status: he has a lovely wife who has a lovely younger
sister with whom he also sleeps -- with the wife's blessing. A menage a
trois that even raised the eyebrows of some tolerant French spectators. In
addition we see our non-Robin stealthily stealing a child's toy while some
neighbors sleep. Its destination is the child he has had with his
sister-in-law.</P>
<P>Boorman decided to film in black and white. Says he: " Color films are too
saturated. They prettify. They vulgarize. And particuarly, they romanticize
poverty.[...] B &W abstracts while color distracts [...] But there are
deeper reasons. Most of us dream in B & W [...] a B & W film approaches the
condition of a dream, of memory, reaches out into the audience's
subconscious. There was often a mythic dimension to B & W movies. They
presented a familiar yet alien world, a contiguous reality."</P>
<P>The movie used color stock which was printed in B & W, a system that can
enhance shadings. And they shot in CinemaScope format which, used
intelligently, allows the screen's expansion to places that need to be
included. The B & W use of Scope reminds me somewhat of Francois Truffaut
's creative photography in Jules and Jim.</P>
<P>Not that friendship is celebrated as in Truffaut's movie. What's generated
is minute, complicated team-planning which is executed with brash
clockwork. There is strong suspense in the carrying out of holdups and
burglaries. The step-by-step preparations and crimes are not as detailed as
in Kubrick's race-track heist-movie The Killers, or Rififi's jewel robbery
that was made in France by American self-exile Jules Dassin. What I do
sense in the Cahill gang is a new element, the amazing luck that
accompanies the General's strategies. And all this has a constant
accompaniment of humor and amusing bits, even while you are aware that
Martin, his men and their actions are far from funny.</P>
<P>The movie's Irishness is beautifully observed, with no sentimentality, no
stress on poverty, no blarney, no unnecessary colorfulness. What there is
instead is Boorman's fascination with Cahill. The bottom line is that
Martin comes through as extraordinarily clever and innovative in his
avocation, but most likely a hollow man with no real interests --except for
his family and his bourgeois menage a trois--outside his profession. He
lived comfortably from his often spectacularly profitable hauls;  he took,
democratically, only one standard share; he did not drink or do drugs; his
home was nfancy middle-class;   and in general his kind of life that a 9 to
5 mid-rank employee might live. Cahill remains a mystery. Were his actions
motivated by a compulsion? As in Robert Bresson's "Pickpocket" but on a
gigantic scale?</P>
<P>Just as fascinating as the film is John Boorman's "A personal  account of
the making of The General" which runs nine tightly packed pages. It is both
an Odyssey and an Iliad  of the endless, complicated steps, search for a
producer and for funds, problems, troubles, financial deals, legal battles,
disappointments, searches, stumbling blocks, etc. from conception to
fruition. The shoot lasted eleven weeks; the preliminaries took years.</P>
