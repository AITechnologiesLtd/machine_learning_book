<P>     With the advent of the fall, relief from the past season's nonstop 
action is on the way.  Officially, BOGUS is still a summer movie, but it 
has little in common with the recent bulk of mainstream releases.  With 
a director like Norman Jewison (MOONSTRUCK) at the helm, it shouldn't be 
a surprise that BOGUS is well-realized and thoughtful, but, given the 
number of movies that have gone wrong over the last few months, it's 
refreshing to see something that lives up to its promise.</P>
<P>     BOGUS is a lightly-dramatic fantasy much in the tradition of Frank 
Capra's fare.  For the most part, this film is sentimental without being 
mawkish, and only at the very end is there a brief, and largely 
inoffensive, slip into melodrama.  BOGUS handles its subject matter -- 
loss, loneliness, and the need for a friend -- with admirable restraint, 
never employing the kind of relentless manipulation that can easily turn 
off the seasoned movie-goer.  Jewison is in control not only of tone and 
pace, but of his actors, as well.  This results in a string of strong 
performances.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, we're introduced to Lorraine Franklin (Nancy 
Travis), a bubbly single mom with a delightful, seven-year old son, 
Albert (Haley Joel Osment).  Lorraine is part of the Circus 
Phantastique, a traveling band of performers currently based in Las 
Vegas.  Albert has formed an attachment with the group's magician, 
Antoine (Denis Mercier), who acts as a substitute father.  When Lorraine 
is killed in a traffic accident, Albert finds himself alone in the 
world.  Antoine helps him with his grief, but he cannot be a full-time 
caretaker, and the young boy faces becoming a ward of the state.  </P>
<P>     To avoid that eventuality, Lorraine had drafted a will of sorts 
that names her one-time foster-sister, Harriet (Whoopi Goldberg), as 
Albert's guardian.  Reluctantly, Harriet agrees to take the boy in, even 
though, by her own admission, she doesn't have a "motherly bone" in her 
body.  Indeed, Harriet is not a good parent, and, to compensate for her 
inadequacies and fill a void in his life, Albert invents a good-natured, 
invisible friend named Bogus (Gerard Depardieu), who follows him around, 
offering advice and comfort.  Harriet, of course, doesn't believe in 
Bogus' existence, but a series of events makes her question her views of 
reality.</P>
<P>     It's said that many intelligent, creative children invent imaginary 
friends.  Considering that Albert has just lost his mother and surrogate 
family, and has been forced to move to Newark, New Jersey (ugh!), he has 
plenty of reasons to dream up Bogus.  As the movie unfolds, we learn 
that, despite the weighty subject matter, BOGUS isn't a downer.  It's a 
magical excursion into the worlds of imagination and potential.  
Lorraine's death is just the starting point -- the real story is about 
how Albert and Harriet grow close and learn that neither of them is so 
different from the other after all.</P>
<P>     Whoopi Goldberg, who seems determined to act here rather than just 
rely on her goofy personality, turns in a sympathetic and multi-layered 
performance.  It has been a long time since her work has reached this 
level, perhaps going back as far as THE COLOR PURPLE.  Meanwhile, with 
BOGUS, Gerard Depardieu has finally found a solid English-language role 
to place aside his numerous critically-acclaimed French parts.  Forget 
GREEN CARD and MY FATHER THE HERO -- BOGUS shows why the actor is 
internationally respected.  His ability to mix light comedy with pathos 
makes Bogus more than just a cardboard character.  Then there's Haley 
Joel Osment, who has as much charisma and screen presence as any under-
ten performer.  Osment is occasionally a little too cute, but such a 
minor flaw can be forgiven considering the maturity of his acting.</P>
<P>    BOGUS is a well-crafted and moving motion picture.  In striving for 
moderation rather than melodrama, Jewison has crafted a feature that 
touches the heart in a special place.  The film asks, but doesn't 
answer, the question of whether the process of growing up is worth the 
sacrifice of innocence and trust.  The director doesn't attempt too 
much, and his weaving of several themes into one is masterfully handled.  
Children and adults of all ages will be enchanted by this movie, which 
is the exact opposite of its title.</P>
