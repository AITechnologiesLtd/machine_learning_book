                        LIVE FLESH (1998)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Pedro Almodovar, "Live Flesh" is a complicated melodrama with
multiple angles of relationship, about the issue of love, desire, sex and
all the other passions in life.  </P>
<P>There are five players in this story and each becomes involved with
another one way or the other.  Victor Plaza is a hot-headed young man who
falls in love with the girl with whom he had his first sexual experience
in a public bathroom. This undeniably pretty girl, Elena, however, cannot
even remember his name.  She is the daughter of a rich Italian diplomat
and a drug addict on the verge of a nervous breakdown when Victor comes to
her door.  They got into an argument and Elena's gun is misfired, an event
that draws two policemen to the scene.  The two men have their own
problems though.  The older, obviously drunk cop Sancho just beat up his
wife Clara for her suspected extramarrital affair.  It doesn't take a
genius to realize that this somehow has to do with the younger, more
rational cop David.  </P>
<P>As a terrible misunderstanding and unexpected events go on in Elena's
apartment, Sancho and Victor struggle for the gun when a bullet is fired
to hit David and paralyzes him.  Victor is jailed for 6 years for this
crime that we later learn he does not commit.  When he is released, Elena,
the woman of his dreams, has straighten up and married David, who is now a
wheelchair basketball player.  Bitter for his misfortune, Victor dreams of
taking revenge on both of them, while fate takes him promptly to her door.
In the mean time, Victor meets this older woman who would sleep with him
and fall in love with him with all her desperate tenderness of an abused
wife.  Who could that possibly be in a melodrama like this?  Our Clara,
Sancho's wife, of course.  </P>
<P>All three men are head-strung and stubborn and jealous.  None would easily
back down from their love and desire.  The women are no push-overs either.
So the entangled relationships unfold...  At one point I really wonder how
this terrible mess would resolve itself, but the development and ending
are not easily predictable and relatively sensible.  </P>
<P>This is definitely a melodrama on the brink of soap opera.  The filmmakers
do not hesitate to use coincidence to carry the plot or push the
plausibility of the story.  However, these can be easily forgiven because
the fascinating and colorful characters.  None can be described with one
word nor can be categorized as good or evil.  David appears to be calm and
strong mentally, but also sleeps with his partner's wife and just as
jealous as Sancho.  Elena accepts her responsibility and at least tries to
correct her wrongs only to become the trigger of the tragedy once again 6
years later.  She also has this really brutal honesty that is just a bit
too... blatant.  Clara does sleep with other men behind her husband's
back, but she is also the victim of abuse and her pain and fear are
tangible.  Sancho is perhaps the least sympathetic character, at least to
us female audience, but he clearly loves his wife deeply and almost just
as desperate as she is, though for a different reason.  Is Victor the only
innocent soul?  Far from it.  He has no intention to back down from a plot
to destroy two marriages (although he is somewhat "entitled" to do so to
Sancho) and indirectely causes tragedy in the end.  And he is obviously
using Clara to teach him the techniques to please women while he does not
love her at all.  All characters are deadly passionate and seriously
flawed but still believable and morally ambiguous.  This is the ultimate
strength of this film.  Almodovar's relentless, uncompromising approach to
the characters is the key to make the film refreshing.  Not for once does
he show the laziness to lessen the mixed quality of these characters.  He
does not hestitate to push the emotional conflicts and moral dilemma to
their extremes and is willing to go all the way. </P>
<P>The film has quite a few bold love-making scenes as well as dialogues.
Are they explicity?  Definitely.  Are they necessary?  Absolutely.
Without them, the audience will never be convinced why Elena should leave
David to be with Victor, even though Elena and David really do love each
other.  These scenes are brutally honest about love, sex and relationship
as much as Elena's confession.  Sex scenes are often boring and mechanical
on the big screen, more misused than not.  This is one of the few
occasions that they work appropriately as an essential factor in the whole
story.  </P>
<P>The style of this film is consistently passionate and intense as the
emotional texture of the story and the characters.  The colors are
dazzling; the images fantastic; the music hot-blooded.  The songs are so
completely Spanish and over-the-top that they make my blood run faster and
hotter.  Surprisingly, the style works with the story, but never replaces
the story and characters.  That is why it is a successful piece of work.  </P>
<PRE>Grade: B+.  </PRE>
