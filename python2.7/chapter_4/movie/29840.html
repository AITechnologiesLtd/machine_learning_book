<PRE>THE NET (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>In the beginning of 1996 users of Croatian bulletin boards
services participated in the poll designed to establish
popularity of Hollywood starlets. The winner of this
popularity contest was Sandra Bullock, young actress who had
just became a star by appearing in SPEED. However, Croatian
modem geeks probably chose Bullock because of the interview
in which she had mentioned her own Internet surfing habits.
For the geeks, whole idea of Bullock being "one of us"
nicely corresponded with her down-to-earth "girl next door"
image, most responsible for her popularity. Whether
intentional or not, the aforementioned statement was
supposed to help the ticket sales for THE NET, 1995
cyber-thriller directed by Irwin Winkler.</P>
<P>In this film Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett, computer
expert who became so addicted to on-line communication that
she barely leaves her house. One day Dale Hessman (played by
Dan MacKinnon), an on-line friend and fellow computer
expert, sends her a program that seems to allow access to
most secret government and business databases. After
MacKinnon dies in mysterious airplane crash, Angela goes to
vacation in Mexico where she meets suave Jack Devlin (played
by Jeremy Northam), who later turns out to be assassin hired
to kill her. She manages to run back to States only to find
her entire existence literally erased - somebody has
tampered with her files within various government
institutions and replaced them with files belonging to the
convicted felon. Now she is forced to run for her life and
evade both the assassins and police. It becomes clear that
the disk is the key of mystery.</P>
<P>As one of the first Hollywood films to actually tackle new
phenomenon of Internet, THE NET can be forgiven for not
being too successful in this endeavour. Unfortunately,
scriptwriters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris can't be
forgiven for using the emerging world of on-line
communication as nothing more than an excuse for weak plot,
full of situations and characters that became cliches in
Hitchcock's time. Hollywood's technophobia and exploitations
of popular sentiments against Bill Gates (who is thinly
disguised in the form of movie's chief villain) are only a
backdrop in rather predictable story of a single protagonist
on the run from seemingly omnipotent Bad Guys. There are
plenty of scenes that are completely unneccessary (like
Angela's visit to her Alzheimer- stricken mother), full of
plot holes or simply don't work. Jeremy Northam is terribly
miscast as one of the film's villain. Although her character
looks too good for someone who is supposed to spend days
sitting in front of monitor, Sandra Bullock, on the other
hand, uses all of her charms and talents to make her
character believable and her efforts are at least partially
successful. Her role alone is the only reason why this film
should receive a passing grade, but this is not enough for
recommending this film to anyone except Bullock's fans and
those interested to see how Hollywood treated Internet in
mid 1990s.</P>
