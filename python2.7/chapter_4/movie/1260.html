<PRE>                                 HEAR MY SONG
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A bunch of newcomers to feature
     filmmaking make a highly impressive debut in this very
     original and funny comedy about a young impresario and a
     legendary Irish singer.  You may have to go some distance to
     find HEAR MY SONG, but it is well worth seeking out.  Rating:
     low +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     ear My Song is the first film directed by Peter Chelsom.  It is based
on a screenplay Chelsom co-authored with Adrian Dunbar, the actor who plays
the film's main character.  It is a spectacular start for two major talents.
British Chelsom is starting out with more talent than 90% of American
directors and with a skill that it took Bill Forsyth two or three films to
attain.  I choose Forsyth because Chelsom and Forsyth are both British and
each has a loving feel for the personalities of minor characters and local
color.  HEAR MY SONG is constantly doing the unexpected.  Only in the last
ten minutes does the film get a bit sugary.</P>
<P>     Mickey O'Neill (played by Dunbar) is a thirty-year-old concert promoter
in an Irish neighborhood in England.  He wants little more from life than to
put on successful concerts and to woo his girlfriend Nancy.  Tara
Fitzgerald, who plays Nancy, has the sort of pristine beauty that Grace
Kelly had.  There is absolutely no need for the film to explain why Mickey
is anxious to win Nancy.  Mickey, however, is having problems, both with
Nancy and with his promotions.  He finds himself promoting sleazier and
sleazier singers to ever-shrinking audiences.  Then he manages to book a
legendary Irish singer who has been a tax exile from England since 1958.
That sparks unexpected events and a quest in Ireland.</P>
<P>     Chelsom's style of story-telling is brisk and usually intelligent.
Plot details are not overly explained.  Some concentration is required and
there is the feeling that the plot could take a right-angle turn at any
moment.  Unusual camera angles abound.  Chelsom and Dunbar pack the film
with comic situations and dialogue.  Some mention should be made of the
films only two recognizable stars.  Top billing goes to Ned Beatty as a
reclusive Irishman who could be the key to Mickey's success.  His singing is
one of the few negative touches as his singing voice--dubbed by Vernon
Midgley--just does not seem to go with his speaking voice.  David McCallum
is largely wasted as a police inspector and as a heavy.</P>
<PRE>     This is a genuinely funny comedy and well worth looking for.  I rate
this a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
