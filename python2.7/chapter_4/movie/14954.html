<P>It's possible to classify cinema based on literature as an entirely
seperate genre aside from action, comedy, drama, and the usual
categories. Those movies which are based on books are almost always a
testament to their source - the author wrote such a visually or mentally
outstanding novel that it begged to be brought to life on the screen -
but as cinema alone they are often disappointing ventures. The most
disappointing transplant within the last few years was James Patterson's
KISS THE GIRLS: although the novel was tense and a very exciting read,
the movie was lackluster and far from noteworthy. The latest product of
this movement, Toni Morrison's BELOVED, does not stoop to such levels,
but it is a rather disappointing movie. </P>
<P>With all of the talent involved - both in front of the camera, behind
it, and in the script - BELOVED was almost a surefire lock for the
Oscars in March of next year. (It still may harbor such chances, as both
the Academy and several signifcant film writers tend to prefer deep but
cinematically boring films for their ballots.) It's directed by Jonathan
Demme, who won an Academy Award for his direction in SILENCE OF THE
LAMBS. The script is written by Akosua Busia, who wrote the energetic
segregation tale ROSEWOOD, and it's is based on the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel by Toni Morrison. Finally, the two top-billed
actors, Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover, have respectable if not
excellent track records in Hollywood. For all of these ingredients, a
very engaging motion picture experience is surely not unreasonable. </P>
<P>The results are quite the opposite. BELOVED is a three-hour long movie
which lacks anything substantial to power it through such an unlikely
length. Demme and Busia have chosen faithfulness to the novel over basic
principles of filmmaking, and in doing so they deep-six any chances the
movie has for widespread appeal. Herein lies the story of Sethe
(Winfrey) an ex-slave living in post-Civil War Cincinnati. For her, the
year 1873 sees the arrival of friend from the past and soon-to-be-lover
Paul D (Glover). Although Sethe agrees with Paul D's presence in her
household, her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) does not. Not long after
Paul D comes to stay with Sethe and Denver do we see the entrance of
Beloved, a strange and sometimes horrific young woman who may or may not
be the reincarnation of a daughter Sethe once had. Sethe and Denver are
enchanted with her, but Paul D knows there's something not right and so
he departs for parts unknown while the plot escalates to its climax. </P>
<P>And the climax cannot come soon enough. Both 1997 and 1998 have seen the
advent of several movies which push the envelope in terms of running
time, and only those films which have some sort of continual motion will
survive at such an extended duration. Anything which takes the better
part of three hours cannot simply rely on solid acting or tidbits of
tension, as in BELOVED. For therein lies the chief reason for the
disappointing outcome of the movie: although Winfrey and Glover give
outstanding performances, there is nothing here that we haven't seen
between AMISTAD and ROSEWOOD - and those were certainly more watchable
films. The only thing that BELOVED has going for it are the hints of a
ghost story, which, sadly, are dropped without realization very early in
the movie. Although some viewers may find this an outstanding and very
memorable film, it is not a mainstream product; and in the end, that is
what mars what might have been a truly fine movie.</P>
