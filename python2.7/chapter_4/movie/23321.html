<PRE>Titus</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
162 minutes
Fox Searchlight
starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, and Colm Feore
written and directed by Julie Taymor
from the play by William Shakespeare</PRE>
<P>There are some people who absolutely cannot understand Shakespeare. You either
fully grasp what is going on, you kind of get the picture, or you don't know
what the heck is going on. Unfortunately, I am a member of the third group. The
language in these type of films loses me completely, and while I was somewhat
able to identify the situations and main storylines for this film, it would be
lying if I didn't say I had several problems understanding the film and it's
message. (If it had one). It's a pretty bad thing to lose your audience for 162
minutes, even those who do know what's going on. But with the way this film
sets itself up, and the time period (if there actually is one) they are
supposed to be in makes it even more confusing for the common moviegoer.</P>
<P>Titus (Hopkins, who just can't seem to find good roles for himself) has
returned from battle and is faced with Tamora, (Lange) a mother of three sons
one day in his courtroom. He orders Tamora's oldest son killed, much to her
pleads of mercy. At some type of political election days later the charismatic
Saturninis (Cumming) revs up the crowd with a promising speech and pronounces
himself king (or something of the sort) in front of Titus. He plans to marry
Titus's only daughter, Lavinia. But refuses Saturninis's advances, and runs off
with the man she truly loves. So he must seek another bride. Tamora, feeling
the need for revenge for the death of her son, is willing to be wed.</P>
<P>And that's about where it all went downhill for me. Apparently Tamora is
sleeping with a black guard/prophet/something with weird marks on his face.
When they are discovered making out in the forest, by Lavinia and her lover,
Tamora's two remaining sons kill the man that Lavinia loved and Tamora tells
them to do what they'd like with her. They cut off both of her hands and tongue
and replace her former hands with branches. It is then that the games begin,
it's Titus vs. Saturninis and Tamora.</P>
<P>It has been a constant thing in films for as long as I can remember to worry
more about the look of the film, then the script of the film itself. It's never
been more apparent here. Director Taymor (who also directs the hit Broadway
version of The Lion King) packs her film so full of visual style that sometimes
it's too much to take. The film is up for a Best Costume Oscar, which it
rightly deserves. But there isn't much else going for this picture. The film
begins with a boy playing with action figures in his kitchen and suddenly turns
into a battleground for Titus's soldiers. The film seems to go in and out of
different periods of time. It's also very MTV for a Shakespeare play. While I'm
told this is one of his very early works, and probably the most mediocre of his
plays, I still doubt that Chrion and Demetrius (Tamora's sons) would listen to
rock music, hump the air whenever they dance, play pool, or suddenly turn into
rape and death, revenge's partners in a scheme to get Titus killed. (Don't
ask). And another thing, could someone please explain to me why the kid playing
with the action figures in the beginning of the film suddenly gets bigger,
becomes Titus's assistant, and starts speaking Shakespeare?</P>
<P>The marketing for this film happens is extremely misleading. The posters depict
the film as some type of historical saga with battles and a love story. In
fact, the trailer does this too. Do not be fooled. It was exactly the opposite
of what I was lead to believe. My major complaint in the film though, didn't
need any understanding at all. The entire picture was so horrifically violent,
and full of so many sexual images, that I'm surprised that the MPAA let it go
with an R rating.  There's nudity from every single member of the main cast,
sometimes you just see a character's butt, other times it's full frontal
nudity. Even though the film's dark subject, revenge, does deal with death and
pain, I really doubt the film needed to show a midnight orgy between countless
amounts of men and women. Since I didn't have a watch to keep checking, I must
have thought at least one hundred times, "When is this going to end?!" The only
other noteworthy thing here is an extremely strange type of ode to Hannibal
Lecter, Hopkins famous character from The Silence of the Lambs near the end,
but by then you'll probably just be wondering how much more of this you will
have to endure. Where did everyone find such an array of weapons? Why don't
people die when their hands are cut off? When is this supposed to take place?
Why were they using plastic? Don't ask these questions, this film won't answer
them. </P>
