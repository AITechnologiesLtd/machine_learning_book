<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I think the one thing that the general crop of Hollywood films lack
entirely is originality.  Most of them have a glimpse of originality
buried somewhere in them, but it seems to me that the vast majority are
padded with so many cliches and formulas that the films feel familiar
even if you haven't seen them before.  The Truman Show is a film
completely original in both its conception and execution, a picture so
intelligent and entertaining that I'm certain most will hail it as one
of the best films of the decade so far.</P>
<P>But it's not just a well-made movie -- it's an emotionally moving and
profoundly direct film that comes across as an all-new experience.  I
don't recall ever seeing a film that feels like this one.  Certainly
there are movies out there that attack the television industry (the
wonderful Quiz Show, for instance), but none of them do it in a manner
like this.  The image that director Peter Weir has created is seamless
and beautiful, Andrew Niccol's script is subtle and superb, and the
acting -- especially from Jim Carrey -- is perfect.  </P>
<P>Ideally, you should not know what the film is about before you see it. 
The trailers all tell you the big secret, though -- Carrey plays Truman
Burbank, a man who lives in Seahaven, Florida.  What he doesn't know but
the rest of the world does is that he's the star of a television show
that features every moment of his life.  He goes about his daily routine
as if it were a script, saying almost the exact same things to his wife,
Meryl (Laura Linney), that he did the previous day.  He works in a real
estate firm, and his best friend's name is Marlon (Noah Emmerich).</P>
<P>We've all considered the possibility that our lives are staged, that we
are at the center of the universe, that there might be people in white
coats looking at us at all times, that the walls might be illusions and
that we're actually in a laboratory somewhere.  The Truman Show takes
this idea and makes it somewhat pleasant (at least Truman isn't being
studied and probed for fun), but it also makes the concept believable. 
The show was created by Christof (Ed Harris), who is truly wrapped up in
the idea that he's created something wonderful, something pure -- much
more real than anything you can see in the real world.</P>
<P>The way Weir and Niccol set up the film is ingenious, because you don't
know for sure that Truman's at the center of everything (unless you've
seen the previews).  They drop hints though, such as moments during
which we see Truman through the eyes of a strange camera buried in the
bushes (we know it's a strange camera because of the oval matte around
the central image).  Weir allows these hidden cameras to be seen, but
all the hints are subtle (Truman's neighbor, for no particular reason,
carries around a garbage can at eye level, and the camera in the side of
the can is visible, but not obvious).  I can't effectively convey the
sheer completeness of the way Weir has created this fictional little
town, but this is the kind of film that you can watch repeatedly and
still see new things with each viewing.</P>
<P>As the film progresses, Truman starts seeing things that baffle him.  A
stage light falls out of the sky and crashes onto the street in front of
his house.  He examines it as if it were dropped from an alien ship (a
few seconds later he hears a newscast which announces that a passing
airplane had dropped some of its parts).  Soon, though, he sees things
that can't be explained with such ease.  He gets so bent on the idea
that he rushes into a strange building when no one would expect it, and
finds that there are people in a fake elevator eating donuts.  
Quickly he's thrown out onto the street by security guards.</P>
<P>Truman wants to get out of Seaside and go to Fiji, mostly because of a
woman (Natasha McElhone) whom he met in high school.  The woman was
actually an extra who tried to tell Truman that his life was a
television show, but ended up failing.  Truman's attempts at getting out
of the city are not successful, for every time he tries to leave
something strange stops him (random forest fires, sudden traffic jams,
etc.).  He also sees lots of things that are intended to deter him, such
as a poster of an airplane under attack from a giant bolt of lightning,
with the caption, "IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!" in block letters across the
top.</P>
<P>Weir's direction is amazing (he should easily be in for the Best
Director nomination), and his work is complemented by the wonderfully
pleasing aesthetics of Seahaven.  Cinematographer Peter Biziou and
production designer Dennis Gassner have done splendid work with the look
of the film; the imagery, such as in all the scenes with Truman sitting
on the beach, is absorbing and immersive, and is matched perfectly with
Philip Glass' score (it's worth mentioning that the musical score is
always flowing lightly in the background).  Even without the script, The
Truman Show is simply a pleasure to look at.</P>
<P>With this film, Carrey proves that he can act.  But this isn't just a
"coming out" performance, or a performance that everyone will adore
simply because he doesn't play himself.  This is a truly great
accomplishment, and deserves to be recognized on higher levels.  Carrey
is complex and subtle, but still manages to be hilarious in a more
realistic way than he has in the past (perhaps the funniest scene is
when Meryl forces a product placement for coffee at a moment when Truman
is very upset).  Carrey never goes overboard, but he's so good at
playing this character that I can't imagine anyone else in the role.  He
has the perfect face and demeanor for the character.</P>
<P>The supporting work is also fantastic, particularly from Ed Harris. 
Harris is a versatile actor (though he's often typecast as the bad-ass
military guy), and here is utterly convincing as a man who truly
believes that he is doing a great thing both for Truman and for the
entire world.  Linney is also perfectly pitched, and her acting is
clever in that she's playing an actress who constantly acts.  Natascha
McElhone, with her gleaming eyes and soft smile, is simply magnetic to
look at (a good casting choice), but she also turns in a great
performance as Truman's true love.</P>
<P>I haven't talked about the fact that the film is uproariously funny. 
This is the best kind of humor -- you have to think before you laugh,
and most of the jokes will only strike if you're paying close
attention.  Some of the humor is over-the-top if you think about it
(watch closely the scene in which Truman sees his father dressed as a
homeless man), but every attempt at humor in The Truman Show hits with
full force.</P>
<P>But this isn't just a comedy.  This is a smart and intelligent film
that actually takes a satirical view of the television industry.  It's
also a moving picture, because Truman is so well-written by Niccol and
well-acted by Carrey -- he's a likable man, and we want him to be able
to succeed and live a real life.  The Truman Show is actually quite
acidic towards the industry, but the message hardly bogs down the story
(note the final shot of the film, though, and then ask yourself what the
point of the film is).  Above all things, though The Truman Show is
original.  It's a new kind of film experience, as intelligent as it is
funny, and perfectly made as it is perfectly acted.  I recommend it
unreservedly to all viewers to love great films.</P>
