<PRE>WEST BEIRUT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Hanging prominently in the bedroom of Tarek (Rami Doueiri), a Lebanese
teenager, is a poster of the movie ESCAPE FROM HELL.  Writer/director
Ziad Doueiri's autobiographical WEST BEIRUT, set in 1975 in Beirut at
the start of the Lebanese civil war, uses the poster as an extremely apt
metaphor for the longings of the country's citizens.  The moving but
never morose film tells an always touching and sometimes funny coming of
age story.</P>
<P>Tarek is a high-spirited, good kid from a close-knit family.  He likes
his practical jokes, which sometimes get him into trouble.  His antics,
however, never get the film in any trouble, as the filmmaker stays clear
of anything approaching slapstick.  Tarek and his best friend Omar
(Mohamad Chamas), a Muff and Jeff pair, use an old Super 8 movie camera
to record various events, ranging from the cleavage of one of Omar's
future relatives to war footage.</P>
<P>Tarek's father (Joseph Bou Nassar) is an optimist who thinks this war
will not amount to much and will quickly blow over like the many other
wars that he's been through.  Tarek's mother (Carmen Lebbos), a lawyer,
isn't so sure and wants them to evacuate.  The movie takes the time to
show the teenage son playing innocent games with his parents.  Imagine
that.  A cinematic family that's not only not dysfunctional, but even
enjoys and looks forward to each other's presence.</P>
<P>Soon after the film starts, the war begins.  At first, his parents
insist on continuing as usual.  Their morning ritual includes driving
their son across town to his high school.  Along the way they come
across a roadblock patrolled by armed guards.  The guards refuse them
passage.  "But, I'm from Beirut," the angry father explains to the
militia, assuming that they must think he is some outsider.  "Beirut?"
mocks the guard.  "Today there is no Beirut -- only East and West."</P>
<P>At first there are those who resist the division of their city along
religious lines -- the Muslims controlling West Beirut and the
Christians controlling East Beirut.  "If anyone asks your religion, tell
them you're Lebanese, and if they don't like it, send them to me,"
Tarek's friendly baker (Mahmoud Mabsout) tells him soon after the
hostilities begin.  But it will not be long until almost everyone seems
to be taking sides and peacemakers like the baker are all but forgotten.</P>
<P>The family's normalcy is completely shattered when a bomb strikes their
apartment building.  No longer can they make believe that the war will
not affect their lives.  "I know it's tense," the father tells the
family.  "Tense!" his angry, frustrated and frightened wife barks back,
"People are dying and you call that tense!"</P>
<P>To add a small Romeo-and-Juliet spin on the story, a beautiful,
cross-wearing Christian teenager named May (Rola Al Amin) moves into
Tarek's apartment complex, and he is immediately smitten.  Omar, who
sees her as a danger, ridicules her by calling her Virgin Mary in hopes
that she will stop hanging out with them.</P>
<P>Omar tells Tarek that his parents have decided that their family will
become religious.  Omar's parents decry rock music as the work of the
devil.  "Is Paul Anka the work of Satan?" asks his nonplussed friend
Tarek, who brags that he doesn't know a word of the Koran.</P>
<P>The only unsuccessful part of the film concerns a noisy, obese neighbor
of Tarek's.  An obnoxious woman, she does have one saving grace.  She
elicits the movie's funniest line.  Throwing the woman out of her
apartment, the mother screams, "May you clot in hell!"</P>
<P>A delightful little subplot finds Tarek accidentally in a brothel run by
a Jabba the Hutt clone named Oum Walid (Leïla Karam).  What he does and
doesn't do there shows the difference between an indie film and a
Hollywood one.  The director takes a setup ripe for clichés and turns it
instead into another touching episode in a delightful little film.</P>
<P>WEST BEIRUT is filled with realistic people whom you'd like to know.
Tarek and his family and friends are so genuine and likable that you'll
wish you could invite them all over for dinner.  And because of this,
their difficulties in coping with their dire situation become personal
and palpable.</P>
<P>WEST BEIRUT runs 1:45.  The film is in Arabic and French, both
accompanied by easy to follow English subtitles.  The movie is not rated
but would probably be PG-13 for some profanity and some war footage.  It
would be fine for kids around 11 and up.</P>
