<P>   Some public schools in the U.S. are copying an idea
started by the prep schools and now require students to wear
uniforms to class.  In that way, say the proponents, the
youngsters will not be trying to one-up each other, implying
"My dad makes more than yours."  What they neglected to
require was uniform footwear, and so the inevitable resulted. 
Kids are competing over their running shoes.  Nikes are "in"
one year, Adidas the next.  With sneakers now running
upwards of $150 a pair, it's no wonder that some pupils,
especially those living in poorer neighborhoods, are using
illegal means to acquire the money in order to buy status, if
not from head to toe than at least from toe to ankle.  </P>
<P>   In Iran, on the other hand, the poorer kids don't even think
of choosing their shoes for prestige.  They're just happy they
have something to wear to school at all.  "The Children of
Heaven," a gossamer work by the wonderful writer-director
Majid Majidi, an adorable nine-year-old named Ali must not
only settle for a pair of ratty old white sneakers in order to
attend class at all. He actually has to share them with his
younger sister, Zahra; to meet her when she finishes her
morning classes and to quickly change footwear with her so
that he can get to his school for his later session.  Why
doesn't she have her own?  Unfortunately, when Ali took
them to the local shoemaker for repair, he left them for just a
minute or so outside the vegetable merchant's shop. When
he returned, they had disappeared.  Ali must spend a good
portion of this story trying to replace them not only because
sharing the pair's only shoes is an arduous task but because
Zahra threatens to report the loss to her mom and dad, and
that could lead to a beating.</P>
<P>   From this unlikely premise, Majidi etches out a charming
tale, a fable, really, that painlessly instructs us westerners in
some of the customs of his Middle Eastern land while at the
same time obliquely criticizing the vast gulf between Tehran's
many poor and its highly privileged wealthy class. 
Cinematographer Parviz Malekezade's camera focuses in on
one of Tehran's more ragged neighborhoods, a labyrinth of
rundown streets and tattered markets which is home to nine-
year-old Ali, his seven-year-old sister Zahra, their crying baby
brother, their ailing mother and overworked father. 
The family are five months behind in their rent and regularly
threatened by the landlord.  The vegetable man guides Ali to
the cheaper potatoes on the floor while refusing to allow
another day of credit.  At some point Ali's father, portrayed at
first as a cranky and craggy fellow who seems uninterested in
his children but then as a caring family patriarch, takes the
boy "uptown" on the family's threadbare bicycle where they
offer their gardening services to the rich who are protected
behind high walls and fierce, barking dogs.</P>
<P>    The narrative is simple enough, but Majidi mines the film
for sights rich in symbolism and local color.  A blind beggar
hugs his little girl when she arrives home and buys her the
best pair of shoes he can afford.  The schoolgirls and women
are clothed to a person in their traditional religious headdress
but are conspicuously absent from services in the mosque as
they are from important cultural institutions throughout the
land.  Teachers in the shabby elementary school do what
they can with the limited supplies they can dole out, the
principals lecturing the kids on the importance of cleanliness
while the instructors administer written tests to shyly obedient
children.  The men on the faculty run the gamut from a
bearded, serious fellow to a rotund coach who could easily fit
into the athletic staff of an American high school.  </P>
<P>   The two youngsters are portrayed as the titled children of
heaven. Yet they are not saintly or especially goody two-
shoes but rather harbor envious sentiment toward those who
have more than they, if only a simple pair of loafers or a
clean set of sneakers.  </P>
<P>   The acting is tops all around.  Happily, "The Children of
Heaven" is not a tearjerker nor does it conclude on a sticky
utopian note. While a Hollywood ending would have
demanded that Ali replace his sister's shoes as promised,
Majidi's conclusion would have likely brought a broad smile to
the face of O. Henry.</P>
