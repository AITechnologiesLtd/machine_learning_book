<PRE>       THE HOUSE OF YES
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           GRADE: B-</PRE>
<P>       Playing a fetching psychopath, Parker Posey puts a serrated
       edge on the mostly innocuous THE HOUSE OF YES, a comedy of
       early-80s manners that coops up three siblings, a matriarch,
       and an outsider in the family home over Thanksgiving night
       while a storm rages outside. Posey is Jackie-O Pascal, a
       well-practiced Jacqueline Onassis fetishist who's dangerous
       when she's unmedicated. She can't be accused of good taste --
       she pays homage to the Kennedy dynasty by dolling herself up
       in a pink suit and pillbox hat, a la the more famous Jackie
       O. At a costume party, she once added a blotch of ketchup and
       a dollop of macaroni to the outfit to, um, accent the
       ensemble with mock blood and brain matter from a certain
       assassinated president.</P>
<P>       It's not that our Jackie-O is simply an American history buff
       with a grisly bent. Also among her issues is a longstanding
       sexual relationship with her twin brother Marty (Josh
       Hamilton), who is helpless to resist her charms. (They
       reenact the Kennedy assassination together, Marty sitting
       upright and waving vacantly.) The soaking-wet outsider is
       Leslie (Tori Spelling), whom Marty has brought home for the
       holiday to introduce as his fiance. (Daggers from Jackie's
       eyes, natch.) But before the night is over, Marty and Jackie
       will pair off to, um, discuss old times. Meanwhile, awkward
       younger brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) already has
       designs on Leslie. As the matronly Mrs. Pascal, Genevieve
       Bujold hovers disapprovingly over the proceedings.</P>
<P>       Wackiness ensues, leading up to the third-act introduction of
       a loaded gun into the housebound milieu. (If you guessed this
       was based on a stage play, you're absolutely right.) THE
       HOUSE OF YES is fitfully funny, but I can't help but think it
       missed an opportunity to be truly bizarre. Although it's been
       compared to the bold work of Noel Coward, Harold Pinter, and
       Tennessee Williams (!), it retreats too readily to the
       shelter of self-conscious absurdity. The movie saves itself
       from its own staginess by being aggressively artificial, and
       nobody is better at playing that game than Posey, who can
       imbue even the most honeyed line with the flutter of latent
       wickedness. The result is a black comedy that's oddly
       agreeable. The outrageousness is parlayed with a wink, and
       the campy performances reflect the melodrama that seems to
       infect every corner of the Pascal family's daily life. Only
       Spelling, doing an uncanny imitation of a fish out of water,
       doesn't seem to be in on the joke.
