<PRE>KISS THE GIRLS
**1/2 of ****  C grade</PRE>
<P>I hate films in which the good guys don't ask for help of others (FBI)
because the killer needs to get away to preserve the standard film
running time! That is one thing that made KISS THE GIRLS such a mixed
experience, how can a film be so stupid and smart at the same time?</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman is chasing a serial killer that seems to be collecting
girls. Ashley Judd is the average kick boxing doctor who escapes from
Casanova's (killer's name) pad, an advanced labyrinth of mazes and
doors.  Her escape is one of the most exciting scenes in the film
because she is drugged and being chased and unable to dodge every tree. 
By the end of the chase she looks like Sly at the end of a Rockey pick
and is ready to tell the police everything she knows, but she doesn't
know much.  She convinces Freeman to take her with him (!!) and the film
begins to disable.</P>
<P>Too bad. Individual scenes are so good that they deserve a honest,
smarter movie to use them.  And the Acting is first rate, with Judd
showing she is one of the freshest and best new actresses around and
Freeman is sharp in a role that didn't deserve him. Gary Fleder,
director of this and the under-rated Things To Do In Denver When You're
Dead, has style to burn. Unfortunatly the film does burn.</P>
