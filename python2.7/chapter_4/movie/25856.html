<PRE>"Woman On Top"</PRE>
<P>Isabella (Penelope Cruz) is a beautiful, talented chef living in contented bliss
with her husband, Toninho (Murilo Benicio), at their little restaurant in the
Brazilian port town of Bahia. But, while Isabella works in isolation in the
kitchen, Toninho sings and socializes with the patrons nightly. The pretty cook
can deal with her husband's flirtations as long as he can live with her
affliction: severe motion sickness. It's a condition so bad that she must be in
control of her movements at all times, or get very sick. She must drive when
they go out; she can't take the elevator; and, she must lead when they dance.
Even worse for the macho Toninho, Isabella must be on top when they make love.
This last fact drives the couple apart and Isabelle flees to San Francisco to
seek a place to practice her culinary skills in "Woman On Top."</P>
<P>Director Fina Torres ("Celestial Clockwork") uses the screenplay by newcomer
Vera Blasi to create a magical little love story that owes much more than a
passing nod to the 1992 food and fantasy film by Alfonso Arau, "Like Water For
Chocolate." In both films, the cuisine is a character unto itself that, in the
hands of the magical maestro, takes on a sensuality that will "fire the blood
and satisfy the heart." The Arau film is more involving in its combination of
complex and numerous characters and a wonderfully lyrical mysticism that makes
the film so magical.</P>
<P>Blasi's original story is more forced in it situational setup of plot devices as
the fantasy story unfolds. For example, how many people live in obscure little
Brazilian towns, but run off to San Francisco when the marriage breaks up? This
is a real stretch for the imagination and is just one of the problems with the
story. There is the best "girl" friend, Monica Jones (a marvelous performance by
Harold Perrineau, Jr.), who is supposed to be a childhood friend of Isabella's,
but seems to be there just to be the off-beat transvestite comic relief.
Isabella's success and popularity, especially among the guys in San Francisco,
is made believable only because of the charisma of Cruz.</P>
<P>The love story that is drawn through the film does have a certain amount of
charm as Toninho realizes his loss when Isabella leaves after catching him with
another woman (where he got to be on top). When the despondent restaurateur
learns where his true love has fled, he makes a beeline to the US to find her.
Isabella has had a spell cast to make her fall out of love with Toninho, but
that won't stop the passionate Brazilian as he risks anything, including arrest
and incarceration, to get Isabella back. Toninho is aided in his quest by a
three-piece band that  (magically, of course) accompany him in his continuous
serenades to the beautiful Isabella. The love story is sweet and the music,
especially Toninho's love songs, helps set the romantic mood.</P>
<P>The acting will not bring any attention at the end of the year. Cruz is lovely
to look at and has a real presence on the screen, but the actress is more eye
candy than character. Don't get me wrong, Isabella is a beautiful object of
affection. And, she can cook! Murilo Benicio is a handsome, personable young
actor and does a fine job as the tortured Toninho. When he realizes just what he
lost when Isabella left him, nothing else matters as he does all he can to get
her back. Harold Perrineau, Jr. (TV's "Oz") gets lots of opportunities to camp
it up as Isabella's best friend, though the point of the character is lost to
me, except as comic relief. There is little, if any, other character development
by the rest of the supporting cast, which is a problem.</P>
<P>Food may be the focus of the film, but it is obvious that cinematographer
Thierry Arbogast has a crush, visually at least, on Cruz. The camera lovingly
captures every move and expression of the actress in a way that is almost a
caress. This helps to build the sensuality of the film while giving the guys in
the audience a chance to linger awhile and gaze at one of the world's most
beautiful women. Other tech credits are first rate with costumer Elisabeth
Tavernier giving Cruz a complimentary look and she has some fun dressing up
Monica. Production design by Philippe Chiffre is slick, especially with the sets
for Isabella's cooking show.</P>
<P>The music used in "Woman On Top" must be noted, too. Classic Brazilian songs
from the '40s and later are used to wonderful effect, with Toninho using the
soulful romantic ballads as tools to get his beloved wife back, even if on her
terms. Scoring, by Oscar-winner Luis Bacalov, carries the Latino music theme
through the whole film that blends nicely with the songs.</P>
<P>The forced artificiality of much of the story tends to dim the shine of the
sweet romance that develops between Isabella and Toninho. The overt magical
references and effects, the glitter of Isabella's sudden fame on TV, thoughtless
network honchos, spell casting and other such devices end up hurting the film,
making its 92 minute run time seem excessive.</P>
<P>Penelope Cruz has been gaining popularity internationally with her
collaborations with Spanish directors Pedro Almodovar and Fernando Trueba. The
actress is stunningly beautiful and casts a sensuous shadow across any role she
plays. With "Woman On Top," she gets the chance star in a film that is a
showcase for her beauty and her entry into the great American star machine.</P>
<P>While "Woman On Top" may not be all that it could have been - a more mature
screenplay that delved into relationships, magical or not, would have helped -
it does has a gentle nature that helps cancel out some of the film's problems,
but not all. It just doesn't cast a spell on me. I give it a C+.</P>
