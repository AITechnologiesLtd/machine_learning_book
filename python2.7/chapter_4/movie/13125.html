<PRE>REVIEW: 6 Days 7 Nights
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline Obradors,
Temuera Morrison
Director: Ivan Reitman
Screenplay: Michael Browning</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: June 25</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and half stars</PRE>
<P>It would make my forehead cringe to think of a story more simple than
this: the scruffy pilot Quinn (Harrison Ford) manages to crash a small
airplane in the middle of nowhere with prissy women's magazine editor
Robin (Anne Heche) as the only passenger.  The two then grumble and
groan their way through 6 days and 7 nights; griping and whining at
every problem they encounter (and boy, there are a few).  Meanwhile,
Quinn's sluttish assistant (Jacqueline Obradors) tempts Robin's finance
(David Schwimmer).</P>
<P>Did I mention that it's all based in tropical paradise?  Well, it is -
and these exotic islands come fully equipped with wild pigs, fragile
mountain floors and even their own set of pirates ("You mean Arrgh?").</P>
<P>With much controversy surrounding the film regarding lesbian Heche
giving a "straight" performance, allow me to say this: she does a much,
much better job conveying a straight woman than most straight women do.
The main problem with Six Days Seven Nights does not lie in her
performance, and came to think of it, nor does it with anybody else's.
Ford, Heche, Obradors and Schwimmer all make passable if not pleasing
appearances on the screen; giving a fun sense of improvisation to their
roles.</P>
<P>What limits the film from being an inventive, rewarding feel-easy
adventure is the far too loose script.  Perhaps if writer Michael
Browning had been able to add more creativity to the action scenes,
flesh out some of the characters and give the film a better climax, it
may have been more convincing as both a romance and an adventure.</P>
<P>Like many poorly written mainstream films (Godzilla, Hard Rain and
Independence Day come to mind), the script is awash with one liners -
"I'd better not catch you smiling," Robin remarks when Quinn's hand is
down her pants, trying to remove a snake.  Whilst often hilarious, these
remarks serve as a quick joke, illustrating the fact that it's easier to
create a witty remark than it is to build a genuinely funny scenario.</P>
<P>Perhaps director Ivan Reitman's greatest achievement with Six Days Seven
Nights was taking us on a journey to practically no where, and having
fun along the way.  Having said that, the film is nothing more than some
fun - and although you may often find yourself laughing at it, the humor
alone may just be enough to tide you over until you see a better,
smarter film.</P>
