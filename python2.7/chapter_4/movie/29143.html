<PRE>"You cannot land on this island!!"</PRE>
<P>Starring Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni,
Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, Michael Jeter, John
Diehl. Directed by Joe Johnston. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Jurassic Park III is shameless populist entertainment,
short, breezy, well-made and unpretentious. It's the
epitome of the cliche that is the "popcorn movie."
Free of the scientific and ethical mumbo-jumbo that
polluted the first two installments in the series,
director Joe Johnston, with a prodigious technical
skill that rivals Spielberg's, simply turns on the
dinosaur machine and gives the audience what they
expect from a Jurassic Park movie: a hell of a ride.</P>
<P>Plot and dialogue are likewise formalities Johnston
feels free to dispense with, and for once, it's fine
with me. The movie's skeleton is this: paleontologist
Alan Grant (Sam Neill), the only character returning
from the previous films, is recruited by Mr. and Mrs.
Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, uh,
respectively), to be their guide as they fly over Isla
Sorna, the island where genetically engineered
dinosaurs roam free. Grant is extremely reluctant to
do this, as he has been extremely critical of the
experiments that brought the specimens into existence.
So imagine his shock when the Kirbys, who have an
ulterior, if not malevolent, motive, land on the
island without consulting him, leaving them to fend
for themselves in a confined space with huge,
unexpectedly intelligent lizards running around.</P>
<P>Then, with nothing standing in its way, the movie
takes off. The dinosaurs look awesome, with the
special effects team employing a new method of mixing
animatronic reptiles with CGI ones. When a giant
lizard chases the characters, the sight is genuinely
frightening; for the first time, the dinosaurs
actually look gargantuan. Like Spielberg, Johnston
also knows what to do with them; too many movie
special effects just sit there on the screen,
expecting us to be awed by their mere existence. These
dinosaurs do everything we'd expect an actual dinosaur
to do, and there is even a jar of T-Rex urine that
makes an appearance.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Jurassic Park
III is its running time of less than 90 minutes. A lot
of directors feel that when they are given a lavish
budget, they must make a long movie to justify it (see
The Mummy Returns), and a lot of them wind up feeling
tortuous. Johnston realizes the film's breezy,
thrill-park-ride nature and works accordingly. There
isn't a word, moment or shot wasted; this is the most
stringently utalitarian movie I have ever seen.</P>
<P>The credits roll just about when we would expect the
third act to begin. Though I was having a great time,
this was okay by me. I like suprise endings no matter
the nature of their surprise; others I've talked to
have felt slighted at the lack of a de facto climax,
but their complaints sounded fairly moronic (sorry,
guys). At least you can't call the movie repetitive.</P>
<P>I'm grateful for movies that truly want to entertain,
rather than drown the audience with special effects
and marketing gimmicks. The phrase "popcorn movie"
seems to apply to everything that's not considered an
"art movie," but there's an art to popcorn movies as
well. It is clear, despite the film's simplicity, that
a great deal of work and thought went into all of the
aspects of Jurassic Park III, and not just into the
special effects. Artistry can be found in the
unlikeliest places. </P>
