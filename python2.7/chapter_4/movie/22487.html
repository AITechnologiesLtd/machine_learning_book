<PRE>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)</PRE>
<P>Starring Rob Schneider, William Forsythe, Eddie Griffin, Arija Bareikis, Oded
Fehr, Richard Riehl, and Norm MacDonald.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Mike Mitchell
Written by Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider</PRE>
<P>"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" is a film that gives star Rob Schneider a perfect
chance to meander the streets with no clothes on. This heinous image is
sprinkled throughout the film to everyone's chagrin. Why would we want to see
this…especially on the big screen? If this image is triggered to disgust its
audience, it certainly succeeds. There are points where it is almost impossible
to stare at the screen. Some films of this same gross-out genre are highly
entertaining for one reason. They disgust and entertain simultaneously because
they are either innovative or hilarious. "Deuce Bigalow" lacks these two
qualities causing the disgust factor to greatly outweigh the entertainment
factor. Most of the jokes were unoriginal, either tired spoofs from other films
(there were two idiotic Matrix spoofs in two different scenes) or blatantly
stolen from its predecessors (an angry dog bangs against a door almost
identically to the dog in "There's Something About Mary"). If I wanted to see
funny gags just like those of past movies, I would see past movies. It's
cheaper and much simpler. The saddest thing about "Deuce Bigalow" is that its
mentor is an unfunny Adam Sandler flick. By copying off unsatisfactory movies
like "Happy Gilmore" or "Billy Madison" in which the loser does something crazy
but winds up getting a hot girl at the end, Rob Schneider's movie is even more
unsatisfactory. Now I know why Sandler himself produced this film; he is trying
to make his pictures look better. </P>
<P>"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" tells the story of sad, pathetic Deuce, a
worthless pervert who also happens to be a fish freak who cleans fish tanks.
Under some wacky circumstances, Deuce finds himself making money as a gigolo so
he can pay off debts to a real gigolo whose house he ruined. As a "man-whore,"
as they call male prostitutes, Deuce ends up tagging along on dates with
bizarre women who no one else will go out with. He escorts an incredibly large
woman, an incredibly tall woman, a narcoleptic, a woman with Tourette's
syndrome, and of course the woman of his dreams. It is hard to root for
Schneider in his role. He is just so pathetic and slimy to start out with, that
when he begins to date these women the enthusiasm to see him succeed is very
low. At least Sandler is like the guy next door you go to sports games with.
Schneider's character is just such a jerk that eventually he becomes
excessively irritating. </P>
<P>The film follows a one-joke premise that dies off half way through. Although
this may be one of the shortest movies of the Winter, with the openings of
nearly a dozen three hour plus films, it seemed a lot longer than an hour and a
half. Its predictable plot is mostly responsible for this. Also its terrible
acting from the talented William Forsythe, who spends the whole film
complaining about the size of his private part, to Norm MacDonald, who had a
quick and forgetful cameo as a bartender.  </P>
<P>The saddest thing about this movie is that it, and the many others like it, are
successful at the box office meaning they will continue to multiply and top
more deserving films. The scariest, and only real thought that popped into my
brain after watching this movie (besides the fact that I think it made me
stupider) is that if this movie copied off the very disappointing Sandler
flicks, then will future films copy off "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo." I
continue to shiver at the thought.</P>
