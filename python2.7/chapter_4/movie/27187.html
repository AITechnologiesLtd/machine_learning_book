<PRE>                      THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The Disney animation factory tells
          a story of its own invention set in pre-
          Columbian Peru.  A selfish young emperor is
          turned into a llama.  Taken far from his palace
          he goes on an odyssey to return to his home and
          win back his throne from an evil pretender.  The
          story and the characters are likable, and for
          once Disney is not trying to impress with
          cutting edge animation techniques.  While is it
          no BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, it is both fun and
          funny with a couple of good lessons for kids
          hidden behind the entertainment.  And how many
          films can you name set in pre-Columbian Peru?
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     What would the holiday season be without a new animated film
from Disney?  This outing rather than taking some classic story and
inaccurately making it into a film, they have taken their own story
setting it in Peru vaguely sometime before Columbus came to the New
World.  The Emperor Kuzco (voiced by Saturday Night Live veteran
David Spade) has been particularly cruel to a well-meaning lug of a
peasant Pacha (John Goodman). Kuzco may not have a shred of meanness
in his body but the also does not have a scrap of empathy or
kindness.  What does have is an ambitious and evil adviser, Yzma
(the great Eartha Kitt).  Yzma tries to poison Kuzco in order to
take his place but instead accidentally turns him into a llama and
then loses him.  Kuzco find himself alone and friendless except for
the peasant he has mistreated.  He finds it a rocky friendship but
one he comes to depend on.</P>
<P>     As Disney animated films go this is not the best, but
definitely not the worst.  The script does not go into the
characters as much as it might, choosing instead to keep the script
denser in humor.  Wait long enough and the relationship between
Kuzco and Pacha will become surprisingly touching.  The choice of
setting is one that has rarely been used for film and one that the
younger members of the audience might not immediately recognize or
understand.  It may provide a good opportunity for parents to give
their children a history lesson, if indeed the parents understand it
themselves.  Of course the history must not be taken too seriously
either.  The script mixes its cultures a little too much having in
one scene a Mexican piata party.  One of Sting's forgettable songs
incorrectly refers to this part of the world as "Meso-America."
John Goodman is a little large and plump to play an Inca.  Incas
were probably short and certainly not heavy.  The script manages to
avoid having anything larger than a ladybug die in the course of the
story.  The most frightening scenes are not of violence, but of
dangers of falling from great heights.  Then again, this is Peru and
you expect great altitudes.  The religious right may object to a
usually likable gay character, even if he is the conflicted henchman
of the villain.  Those who would ban books like Harry Potter and THE
WIZARD OF OZ may be unhappy that magic has an effect in this film;
though they may take consolation in that it seems never to be the
effect intended.</P>
<P>     This film does push what were at least of few years ago limits.
For most of the film Pacha's wife is noticeably pregnant.  And in
spite of the fact she seems content to be what we would call "a
housewife," she proves herself more than match for some powerful
baddies.  Most of Disney's best villains have been women so they
have never held back from allowing women to be villains, though
usually they are uglier and older women and this film is not really
an exception.  The corpulent hero is, however, something of a change
for Disney.</P>
<P>     For once the animation techniques do not run away with the
show.  There are no scenes that are anywhere near a breath-taking as
the opening of THE LION KING.  Most of the animation seems fairly
flat and old-fashioned.  This is Mark Dindal's second outing as
director.  His previous effort was CATS DON'T DANCE for Turner
Broadcasting.  He did previously direct for Disney the animation
sequences for the under-rated THE ROCKETEER.  The music is by John
Debney and David Hartley.  Sting wrote the songs and is apparently
unhappy that some of his songs were dropped.  He might have a point.
The songs dropped could easily have been better than the boring
place-holder songs that were not dropped.  At least I think they
were boring place-holder songs, admittedly not much about the songs
comes to my mind at the moment.  When Disney Studios said that they
mourned the loss of Alan Menken, it was with only the best of
reasons.</P>
<PRE>     As animated films go, this one is above average, but it will
probably not be a Disney classic.  I give it a 6 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
