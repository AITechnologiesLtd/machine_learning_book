<PRE>View: In Dreams (1999)</PRE>
<P>In Dreams opens with the flooding of a small town and wonderful music
composed by Elliot Goldenthal. The opening titles blink by, scratched in
a font approximating a child's handwriting, superposed onto the first of
the underwater sequences that likely inspired the film's working title,
'Blue Vision.'</P>
<P>We then meet the protagonist, Claire Cooper, as she is helping her
daughter Rebecca to memorise her line in her kindergarden's production
of a very Disneyan Snow White. The rest of the film has nothing in
common with Disney, and everything to do with Snow White, especially in
the light of the fairy tale's many interpretations. The stage has been
set, and onward goes In Dreams, with its dream-logic and vitality, like
vein blood seen blue through thin skin, and red bloodstains or apple
blossoms.</P>
<P>It is a very beautiful, very flawed, and very memorable nightmare. You
do not need me to tell you anything more about it.</P>
<PRE>                             __IN DREAMS directed by Neil Jordan stars
Annette Bening and is based on the novel DOLL'S EYES by Bari Wood don't
bring your kids along__</PRE>
<P>Word to every other critic (Mr Ebert, This Means You): I was left
puzzled by one 'detail' at the end, but I'm going to do something about
it (and verify my educated guess)... *Read the book*</P>
