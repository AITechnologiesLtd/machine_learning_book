<PRE>                   RATING: **** (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        In some respects, "What Dreams May Come" reminds me of
Richard Bach's "Johnathan Livingston Seagull," a book which
sparked my imagination with an intensity that few other works
of art have ever equaled.  It was a novel that challenged the
way I approached the very concepts of religion and spirituality.
Although I didn't agree with every aspect of the story (and still
don't, incidentally), the sheer beauty of its presentation was more
than enough to make up for its shortcomings; when I finished
reading it, I found myself deeply moved by both its power and
message.  Walking out of an opening-day screening of "What Dreams
May Come," I felt a similar sense of awe... even though, once again,
I didn't agree with everything that was said.</P>
<P>        A brief collection of scenes, displayed during the film's
opening credits, sets the plot in motion.  Chris Nielsen (Robin
Williams) and his wife Annie (Annabella Sciora) meet while on
vacation in Europe; soon, they fall in love and marry.  They
eventaully have two children, but Fate has a nasty shock in store:
both kids are killed in a car accident while in their teens.  Annie,
who asked the housekeeper to drive the kids to school that day,
blames herself for their deaths, figuring that things may have
turned out differently if she'd been behind the wheel.  Years pass,
and the couple's emotional wounds slowly heal.  Then one day, Chris
offers to run an errand for Annie; while doing so, he is killed in
another car accident.</P>
<P>        Chris's soul, after coming to terms with his death, makes
the journey up to Heaven.  He finds a place of such astonishing
beauty that I will not even attempt to describe it with words;
suffice it to say that the film's visuals are among the most
awe-inspiring ever captured on celluloid.  Heaven, it seems, is
somewhat like the Holodeck from "Star Trek": it can be completely
customized, based on the wishes of its occupant.  Everyone's Heaven
is different: because Chris was such a fan of art in life, he
chooses to live in a world comprised of painted landscapes, like
those Annie used to create.  Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Chris's
spirit guide and friend, teaches him to manipulate his environment,
and in time Chris is even reunited with his children.  The only
thing missing from his world is Annie, who he wistfully watches
from afar.</P>
<P>        But Annie, nearly comatose with grief after losing her entire
family, decides that she no longer has any reason to live; soon
after Chris's death, she takes her own life.  Chris assumes that his
wife will now join him in eternal paradise, but it is not to be:
suicide victims are forever barred from the rewards of the afterlife,
and he can only watch helplessly as Annie is sent to Hell.  Despite
the wonders of Heaven and the reunion with his children, Chris
refuses to spend eternity without his soulmate, and decides to
gamble his own soul in a desperate attempt to save her.</P>
<P>        To say that Robin Williams is excellent in his role would
be redundant, as the man is incapable of being anything less; also,
Cuba Gooding Jr. is the very picture of warmth and patience as the
understanding spirit who helps Chris make the awkward adjustment
from life into death.  Best of all may be Annabella Sciora's
portrayl of Annie: it's she who undergoes the greatest number of
emotional changes over the course of the story, yet she always
remains a fascinating (if occasionally unsympathetic) character.
But Max von Sydow, who plays a helpful "soul mercenary" named The
Tracker, is significantly less interesting: he adds little to
the story except some vaugely philosophical dialogue that doesn't
really go anywhere.</P>
<P>        The truth is, the characters in this film take a back seat
to the experience of just *watching* the thing; in that regard, I
was reminded of "Brazil" and "2001: A Space Odyssey."  The movie is
far from perfect, and the unneccessarily "cute" final scene does much
to undermine the previous fifteen minutes of the story, all so
the filmmakers' can make the audience go "Aww."  The biggest problem,
however, is the simple fact that we don't see enough of our heroes'
"lives" after they die; instead, the film presents us with so many
tedious flashbacks that the story screeches to a halt nearly every
time one appears on the screen.  In addition, the cloying score from
composer Michael Kamen actually crosses that fine line which separates
sentimentality from self-indulgence, and we're forced to listen to him
throttle the audience's emotions with a sweeping arrangement of
strings that never lets you forget that you're supposed to be sobbing
into your popcorn.  It's even worse than the score for "Volcano," a
feat I thought was impossible.</P>
<P>        But none of that really matters.  "What Dreams May Come" is
so strikingly original that it's worthy of respect and serious
analysis, despite the occasional flaw.  There's an undeniable
grandeur to the production, an epic quality that raises the film
from mere cinema into a sensory odyssey.  Director Vincent Ward had
no interest in making a timid film, and indeed he hasn't; for that
reason, I'm willing to give the story some slack.  I highly
recommend that you see this movie with several of your closest
friends.  Afterwards, go get a cup of coffee and discuss what you
just saw.  I promise, it'll keep you talking for the rest of the
evening... and maybe the whole week.</P>
