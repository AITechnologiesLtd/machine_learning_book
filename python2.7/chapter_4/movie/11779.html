<PRE>Darkman (1990)</PRE>
<P>This is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst movie that I've ever
seen.  If you want to see a proper review, then you're in the wrong
place.  This is how vividly this movie stuck to me as the most horrible
excuse for entertainment I've ever encountered:
I can remember the reason I saw this movie, where, when, and I can
especially remembering having thoughts about walking out of the
theater.  You must know that if I had had anything better to do, I would
have left.  (In fact, I've never walked out on a movie.)</P>
<PRE>But I had absolutely nothing to do, so I sat there and suffered.  I was
intrigued how anything so pathetic could have made it to the theaters.
When I think of a movie that rates as a "0 star" movie, I look for:
bad plot
bad screenplay
bad acting
bad directing
bad editing</PRE>
<P>Darkman truly delivers in every single bad category.  It lacks any sense
of purpose, plot, or entertainment value.  There are dozens of movies
which I could name that I'd gladly watch before I'd watch this movie
again.  Movies which people consistently rate 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The major thing that mystifies me about this, uh (shall I say it?) movie
is that there was a sequel.  (Okay, only on video.  But there were two
sequels.)  It makes me sad to think that there was any interest in this
trash enough to let it linger.  I have heard a rumor that either Siskel
or Ebert gave it a good rating.  If so, rest assured that either they
were given a large sum of money to do so or they truly are the most
inept of critics.  Any critic that would have a positive </P>
<P>If all of my words have made you want to see it for the sake of
adventure, then no doubt you have the same idea I had when I failed to
leave the theater.  I knew that this movie was insidious and yet I kept
watching.  Let's just say that curiosity will kill you on this one.</P>
<P>Note that Sam Raimi directed - a pseudonym used by permission of the
Director's Guild if I'm not mistaken.  I would be most interested to
know the true culprit.  I would like to ask him, "What were you
thinking?"</P>
<P>It might be Bradford May - the guy who directed the two Darkman sequels
and a director of foreign TV movies.  I've never seen any of his other
stuff.</P>
<P>He also directed "The Amy Fisher Story" and "Madonna: Innocence Lost." 
I have a feeling that this guy's stuff isn't quite what I'd call
"quality."</P>
<P>One final note: I have not seen either Darkman II or III.  I can imagine
that these movies must be just as terrible as the original.  Don't
bother warning me about them, I will never see them.</P>
