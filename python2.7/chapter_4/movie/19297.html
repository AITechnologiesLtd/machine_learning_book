<PRE>10 Things I Hate About You.</PRE>
<P>Starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Directed By Gil Junger
Running Time: 1 hour 37 minutes.</P>
<PRE>(Touchstone Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' gets transferred to 90's America in
this fun tale of romance. Julia Stiles plays Katarina Stratford, a bitchy
'hate chick'  who's sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) desperately wants to
date boys. However, daddy (Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until
Katarina dates, and there isn't much chance of that happening. Enter Cameron
(Gordon-Levitt) who desperately wants to date Bianca. Of course, he can't
date Bianca until Katarina dates, so Cameron and friend Michael (David
Krumholtz) set in forth a plan to get weirdo Patrick (Ledger) to date
Katarina. Not everything, however, goes to plan.</P>
<P>Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have delivered a script that
makes Shakespeare actually quite good fun. The dialogue is funny, and the
film goes along at a cracking pace. In fact, the film moves a little too
fast, because some plot developments occur in a hurried way that aren't
entirely believable. The largest casualty of the fast paced script is
Katarina, who goes from independent chick to soppy, big eyed typical
teenager in the space of seemingly a few days. The film also gives the
current Hollywood saying, which is "if you don't conform, you won't be
popular." A worrying trend. Still, the dialogue is fresh, and the jokes come
out at a steady rate which gives the film a lively feel, and doesn't sound
like the writings of a forty year old desperately trying to sound cool.</P>
<P>The actors are obviously having a good time with the material. Most of the
cast have transferred from television, and are less brattish than some of
the brat pack appearing on the screen at the moment. Stiles has great fun
playing the easy role of being a bitch, and has fun running off the endless
insults. Her characters a little flat, however, and her transformation is
more than a little shaky. Still, she looks great, acts well, and handles the
main role with ease. The hulking Ledger is good fun as the seemingly
braindead Patrick, who's charm increases throughout the movie, until he
becomes the most likeable character in a likeable cast. Gordon-Levitt
suffers from the 90m.p.h script, and his character is therefore lacking. He
gives a decent performance, but he never has enough time to truly shine on
the screen. He also looks about thirteen years old. David Krumholtz is
hilarious as the typical geek, and this, following his performance in Slums
of Beverly Hills, shows he has a great comic talent. The pretty if empty
Larisa Oleynik (also known as Alex Mack) makes the least impression in the
movie, her performance is a bit boring and two dimensional. Allison Janey
pops up in a bit role as the horny school counsellor, and like most bit
roles gets all the best lines and disappears with her pay cheque.</P>
<P>The rest of 10 Things I Hate About You follows the standard teen flick
formula. There's a glaring rock sound track featuring a good selection of
rock tunes. There's the 'hip' school teacher, overplayed by Daryl Mitchell.
There's a performance or four by a live band. And the film ends at a prom,
and the weather is always good. It all seems a little too perfect, and for
some people watching spoiled kids live out their spoiled lives holds no
opinion. But it's better made here, and thankfully the characters are fully
likeable.</P>
<P>10 Things I Hate About You is a worthwhile teen flick, directed with a
bouncy flair by Gil Junger which gives the film a light, fluffy feel. The
ending is obvious, the sentiment piled on. But 10 Things I Hate About You is
a worthwhile movie that is good for a matinee.</P>
