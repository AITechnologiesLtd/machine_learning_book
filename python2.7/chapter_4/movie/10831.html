<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    When Jennifer and Lisa Pailey (Joanna Going and Rose McGowan) return
home to the quiet little town of Snowfield, Colorado, they find the maid
dead on the floor. This happens two minutes into the film. Scared, the
two women trek around town, finding that the streets are empty and the
air silent. Later, they find severed heads, and by this time it is
crystal clear that there is a problem. Luckily, they meet up with
Sheriff Bryce Hammond (Ben Affleck) and two of his underlings (one of
whom is Liev Schreiber, doing his best to act all nervous and crazy and
stuff).</P>
<P>    While searching through a hotel because of strange music emanating
through the building, they find a message written with lipstick on a
mirror (in a locked room with no windows, one of the characters notes).
The message refers to a certain Dr. Timothy Flyte. With no idea as to
what on earth is going on, Hammond calls for help, mentioning the
lipstick message in his call. The help shows up with Dr. Flyte (played
by Peter O'Toole) to solve the problem.</P>
<P>    See, it turns out that there is a big worm that looks like
solidified oil; conveniently, it thinks it's Satan. This is a Learning
Worm, so it is very smart. I'll leave the rest of the shocking plot
developments for you to discover for yourselves.</P>
<P>    Although I describe with utmost sarcasm the way Phantoms moves
along, I must admit that these silly little plot details are just about
the best thing about the film (aside from the cast). I think smart oil
is a unique idea for a bad guy, especially in a horror film.
Regrettably, the film is bad. It isn't scary, or suspenseful, or even
particularly well-crafted. The characters are stale and cardboard-like.
Like most of the films that enter this genre, this one has nothing new
to offer.</P>
<P>    The film begins on the wrong foot, jumping too quickly into action.
The two sisters, for example, are given one scene of dialogue before
they're confronted with the problem. I guess it's possible to be
concerned based solely on the fact that they are the good guys, but in a
perfect world I would like to have gotten to know them better before
seeing terrified looks on their faces. The same goes for Hammond,
although we at least learn a juicy bit of his history. The
actors--McGowan, Going, and Affleck--all do what they can with the lack
of depth, but they are defeated nonetheless.</P>
<P>    And it doesn't help that the characters are stupid. Towards the
beginning, they discover the body of a police officer, who has clearly
drawn his gun and fired off three rounds. Regardless of this fact, the
characters still consider the possibility that they are dealing with a
virus. Only O'Toole can project some kind of intelligence, although it
should come as no surprise that he is wasted in this role.</P>
<P>    Phantoms was directed by Joe Chappelle, who doesn't give off the
feeling that he wants to be making this film. Every moment is so
standard that I doubt any particular sequence will leave you feeling
like you've seen something all new and different. This is an alarming
thing to consider, especially when I realize that this is a horror film,
intended to scare and shock me. We've all seen films in which the evil
force can look human and fool our heroes. Here's yet another film that
uses this approach, and nothing new is done with the premise.</P>
<P>    If you just have to go out an see a horror film, then I suppose this
one isn't any worse than the other slop that's playing right now. I
suppose it's moderately fun on a really campy level, especially when we
get to see the big oil creature. When I watch a film like this, I just
have to wonder if it's really getting so hard to scare people. There
isn't a moment in this film that startled the audience with whom I saw
it. It simply fails in its prime directive.</P>
