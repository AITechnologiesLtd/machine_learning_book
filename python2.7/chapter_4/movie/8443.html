<PRE>                      IN THE COMPANY OF MEN</PRE>
<P>It was difficult for me to picture the motives of the two
yuppie junior executives Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt
Malloy).    They are unhappy with their jobs because they seem
always to be passed over when promotions are made . . . and they
are angry at the world.  So far, that is understandable.  What is
not so readily understood is the absolute meanness, perversity in
the suggestion by Chad that he and his friend find a woman who
needs love and friendship, overwhelm, her with kindness . . . and
then drop her like a bomb from on high.</P>
<P>True, they both have lately been having girl trouble but their
prime anger seems to be with their employment . . . and it a far
cry from that to the obscene undertaking they engage in with a
pretty woman, Christine (Stacy Edwards), a secretary.  What kind
of misogynist bastards are they?   How are we supposed to
understand, to relate to these two brutes?   What possesses someone
to think up such a vile trick and what allows another to go along
with it?</P>
<P>Christine is dated by both men.  While she falls madly in love
with Chad, she has strong feelings for Howard as well.  Why not?
They treat her as if she were the most desirable woman on Earth.
With her disability of being mute, able only to speak in a strange
voice, this very pretty woman is vulnerable to anyone who will
shower her with attention.</P>
<P>At some point, she is told by Chad that he will no longer see her.
No reason.  Just a metaphoric slam in the face.   When Howard
later confesses to her that he, too, is in on it, that it is only
a gag, I wanted to throw things at the screen.   A controversial
film?  You bet it is.</P>
<P>Fine acting, good dialogue, keep the film alive and worth seeing
. . . but be prepared to hate a couple of rats.</P>
