<PRE>ANXIETY (1998)</PRE>
<P>"We must die with dignity, mustn't we?"</P>
<PRE>1 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Irene Papas, José Pinto, Leonor Silveira, Luis Miguel Cintra
Written & Directed by Manoel de Oliveira, from stories by Agustina 
Bessa-Luís, Prista Monteiro, and António Patrício
Cinematography by Renato Berta</P>
<P>When writer/director Manoel de Oliveira first conceived of ANXIETY, 
it probably sounded like a really good idea.  It would be a sombre, 
literate meditation on mortality, told through three interwoven 
stories, each story resonating with the others to create a whole 
greater than the sum of its parts.  That, indeed, sounds like a movie 
I would enjoy.</P>
<P>ANXIETY is not that movie.  It is one of the most excruciatingly 
tedious experiences I have had in a theatre in a long time, an opinion 
shared by the friend who endured it with me and (evidently) the two 
dozen or more people, wiser than I, who left before it was over.</P>
<P>What is wrong with the film?  Almost everything.  On an intellectual 
level, it does offer some thought-provoking ideas, but that's of 
little use when those ideas are removed from any human context.  De 
Oliveira's approach to his material seems to be one of philosophic 
detachment, but he was entirely too successful with the detachment 
part.  The characters exist so that they can debate certain ideas; 
they have no personality traits beyond those immediately required.  
They have no passion, no life.  The acting is stiff, and everyone 
appears to have only one emotional register, viz., sober reflection.  
Characters mostly sit in one place and talk, using very formal, 
'written' language.  The camera is static.  The men philosophize about 
women, while the women ... well, the women sit around so that the men 
can philosophize about them.</P>
<P>Worse, the production values are shabbier than any I have seen for 
quite some time.  The sets are bland and unappealing, the lighting 
dim.  The editing and mise-en-scène seem like the work of an amateur, 
although they are not: de Oliveira made his first film in 1931.  He is 
89 years old and still at work.  I am sure he is a fascinating human 
being.  I am sure, with all those years of life lived, he has some 
fascinating things to say about mortality.  I just wish he had come 
right out and said them, rather than making this movie.</P>
<P>Bits and pieces of ANXIETY show promise.  There are some nice images, 
like a shot of a rough-hewn tunnel lined with candles.  There is a 
blackly humourous moment at the end of the first part, which concerns 
a father and son arguing about whether the son should commit suicide 
so that he will remain famous after he's dead.   As I was watching 
these things, I was thinking, "That would have been interesting, if I 
actually gave a damn about what was going on."</P>
<P>There is also a neat twist in the transition from the first story to 
the second story, but unfortunately the second story is the worst of 
the lot, devoted largely to the musings of one man about a courtesan 
he has slept with, and what it is that she represents in the grand 
scheme of things.  The man's repeated invocation of the phrase "poor 
Suzy" becomes unintentional self-parody.  By the film's third act, a 
myth about a 1000-year-old 'Mother of a River' who passes on her 
knowledge to a young girl, I was numb to any possible pleasures, and 
simply looking forward to the end credits.</P>
<P>This is by no means the worst film I have seen; at the very least, it 
has some potentially compelling ideas, which is more than you can say 
for some movies.  The screenplay might actually make for good reading, 
but it just doesn't translate onto the screen.  De Oliveira seems to 
have been striving for the sort of static, contemplative mood used so 
successfully by, say, Tarkovsky.  But the artistry that makes a movie 
like THE SACRIFICE so mesmerizing is lacking here.  The fact is, I 
don't think most people would enjoy this movie even if it did succeed 
on its own terms, just as most people are probably put off by THE 
SACRIFICE and similar works.  I, however, am part of the target 
audience for ANXIETY, and I hated it.  That's never a good sign.</P>
