<P>Susan Granger's review of "3 STRIKES" (MGM release)</P>
<P>        Referring to California's controversial ordinance that
requires a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life for anyone convicted
of a third felony, the title tells it all - and this inept movie is
definitely out. Written and directed by D.J. Pooh, the rap-record
producer who co-wrote Friday (1995) with Ice Cube, it adds little to
the urban comedy genre. Brian Hooks plays a hapless twice-jailed loser
who has every intention of going straight when he's released from the
Los Angeles County Jail. "I'm going to do whatever it takes not to go
back," he vows. But when his pal, De'Aundre Bonds, picks him up in a
stolen car, they smoke a little weed and get involved in freeway
gunplay with the LAPD.  He's innocent but his image is caught on
videotape. Immediately, he finds he's once again on the lam - with no
one willing to help him. So where does he hide? The Ritz Carlton
Hotel, where else? Who would think to look for him there in the midst
of a citywide manhunt? On the screen, just about everything goes
wrong. The crude script is inane, the characters little more than
racial stereotypes, the rude dialogue filled with cliches, and
flatulence propels the toxic humor. Even the car chases are
boring. N'Bushe Wright doesn't stand a chance as Hooks' remarkably
tolerant girl-friend, and David Alan Grier is wasted as a
trigger-happy detective on his trail. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1
to 10, 3 Strikes barely musters a 2. This is a truly dismal cinematic
experience!</P>
