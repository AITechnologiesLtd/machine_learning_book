<P>A Simple Plan is a different kind of thriller. While the common
dime-a-dozen suspense film pits the hero against an outside force, all of
the enemies dealt with in this film come from the inside, making the events
that unfold all the more disturbing. Most movies of it's kind deliver cheap
thrills, but this one poses some very frank and tough questions about
paranoia, trust and man's natural capability of evil. After years and years
of formula rehash, A Simple Plan is a very welcome breathe of fresh air. </P>
<P>Based on Scott Smith's best seller about the deceit and ultimate tragedy
that follows the discovery of millions of dollars by three ill-fated men,
this is as eerie and effective as any thriller I've ever seen. Instead of
rushing the story ahead with unnecessary twists and turns, causing the plot
to be chalk-full of gaps and holes, director Sam Raimi lets the suspense
build slowly, giving us one piece of the puzzle at a time. Even if the film
as a whole had been disappointing, this would still be a prime example of
the art of direction. </P>
<P>But that's not to say that this isn't just as fine an achievement in other
areas. If the screenplay doesn't grab you right off, you'd better check
yourself for a pulse; Bill Paxton plays Hank Mitchell, a content middle
class feed store manager who, along with his brother Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton, who could be looking at his second Oscar) and Jacob's friend Lou
(Brent Briscoe), finds roughly four and a half million dollars tucked away
in an abandoned crashed plane. Deducing that it's most likely drug money,
the trio decide to keep the loot for themselves. After all, if someone
comes looking for it, they can always just burn the cash, erasing any
evidence that connected them to the downed aircraft. Figuring this to be a
fool-proof and simple plan, they agree to wait until the plane is uncovered
by the authorities before they split up the money and hit town; all they
have to do is wait. But before they know it, their allegedly "simple" plan
has spiraled into a web of trickery and deceit that will eventually claim
more than one life. </P>
<P>The acting is also top of the line. As the conspiring brothers, Paxton and
Thornton turn in the performances of both their careers, the former
riveting you with his increasing lust for the money, and Thornton tugging
at your heart strings as the put-upon and neglected Jacob. Both are fine
pieces of work and should not be looked over in favor of showier parts when
Oscar time rolls around. </P>
<P>However, as accomplished as everything is (including technical aspects like
music and film editing), A Simple Plan belongs to Raimi all the way. Famous
for his rock'em and shock'em gore flicks in the Evil Dead trilogy, he
finally finds his footing to reveal himself as a major talent. I'm just as
big a fan of The Evil Dead as the next guy (perhaps even more so), but this
is the really strong evidence that Raimi is a true master of his
profession. </P>
