<PRE>                                 NAKED LUNCH
                       A film review by Sarah Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah Elkins</PRE>
<P>NAKED LUNCH: An examination of the creative process?  A spy story?  The
new, updated version of REEFER MADNESS?  Or just writer/director David
Cronenburg playing head games?  You decide.</P>
<P>PLOT/KICKOFF: Bill Lee, an ex-addict, ex-writer (?), turned bug
exterminator turned bug powder addict, has to flee the US to go to
Interzone, an Arabic-style refuge populated mainly by the Interzone boys
(hustlers) and giant talking cockroaches, centipedes, and creatures who
eject narcotics from tubes sticking out of their heads.  Or is most of
the action a hallucination?</P>
<P>CHARACTERS/ACTING: Peter Weller (ROBOCOP, BUCKAROO BANZAI) plays Bill
Lee in a low-key way.  His character reacts to the strangest of events
not with hysteria, but mostly with an air of taking it all in,
sponge-like, except when he's having drug reactions.  I found this
worked for the movie on all levels.  An excellent job.  Judy Davis
(IMPROMPTU) plays Joan, Bill's wife in the US and a pawn in Interzone in
a dry, zombie-like way which also worked for this movie.  I did like her
better in Impromptu, but that was a much more likable character, after
all.  Julian Sands plays the mysterious Yves.  I don't know who played
Joan's husband in Interzone (Ian Holm?), the Interzone boy Kiki (?)  or
the various bug voices.  A fine cast, all in all.</P>
<P>CINEMATOGRAPHY/FX: A tribute to this movie is that all the unbelievable
things going on in this movie didn't *look* unbelievable; they looked
like reality, not F/X.  There's a lot of ugliness in this movie.</P>
<PRE>SCORE: I didn't notice it.</PRE>
<P>VIOLENCE/GORE: bullet holes in bodies, drug injections, but the major
disgust factor was those bugs - gore when they're splattered, gore
during "sex," gore gore gore.  Much worse than THE FLY, IMHO.</P>
<P>LANGUAGE: very offensive language, and lots of homophobic slurs and talk
about them as being perverts, but I think considering the rest of the
movie we weren't supposed to take it any more seriously than the
spy-vs.-spy bugs.</P>
<P>SKIN/SITUATIONS: This movie was a turn-off for me.  Bug "sex" portrayed,
and it's not a pretty sight.  Yeah, some people have sex too.</P>
<P>Analysis: I understand this movie was sort of inspired by William S.
Burroughs' NAKED LUNCH.  I haven't read it, so can't comment on that
aspect of the movie.  As seen in the first section of my review, this
movie has several different levels and possible meanings.  Taken
separately, I don't think they hold up, but strangely enough as a whole
this movie *does* work.  However, yesterday my reaction of "Gross!
Yuck!  Ugh!" etc., still had the upper hand.  It took a couple of days
before I could get past that reaction, but now that I have, I liked much
about the movie, and only wish I'd paid more attention to some of the
lines in the movie (they may have been straight from the book),
particularly the ones about writers.  I don't want to give spoilers, and
I don't want to lecture on what I thought different parts of the movie
meant, but this movie did make me think about what makes a writer tick,
what drives them to write and why they sometimes have to be driven to do
so, what they may have to sacrifice, and how involved they should get
whatever they're writing about.  And surprisingly enough, parts of this
movie were very funny.</P>
