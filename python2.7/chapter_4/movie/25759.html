BUTTERFLY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>José Luis Cuerda's BUTTERFLY (LA LENGUA DE LAS MARIPOSAS) is a coming of 
age story set against the background of a brewing Spanish Civil War.  A 
tale so modest that 15 minutes would more than suffice in telling it 
all, the movie has nothing wrong with it but little that is compelling 
either.</P>
<P>Moncho (Manuel Lozano), the story's protagonist, is off for his first 
day of school.  An asthmatic, he is so scared that he literally pees in 
his pants in front of the class on his important first meeting with his 
new classmates.  But this is that rare and unbelievably tolerant class 
that never holds his embarrassment against him, thanks to the guidance 
of their nearly sainted teacher, an atheist named Don Gregorio (Fernando 
Fernán Gómez).  Both of these male leads deliver noteworthy performances 
in this minimalist drama.</P>
<P>"Be careful with him," Moncho's mother admonishes Gregorio before the 
eventful first day.  "He's a sparrow out of the nest for the first 
time."  This episode gives Moncho the occasional nickname of sparrow.</P>
<P>The one-room schoolhouse in the small Spanish town where the story is 
set houses boys of all ages.  The girls' schooling, or lack thereof, is 
never addressed.  We do know that there are girls in the town because of 
a scene in which young school-age kids of both sexes swim together 
partially clothed -- the type of scene that would probably never past 
muster with the MPAA censors were the movie not foreign.</P>
<P>Shot in warm earth tones, the movie is visually appealing.  After 
various small incidents from nature walks to the canonical scene of 
young kids peeping on adults "humping," the movie finally takes off in 
the last 5 minutes.  With the predictable climax of denounce or be 
denounced, the villagers are forced to take sides in the war, with the 
consequence of a wrong choice being fatal. It is a powerful scene, but 
the movie needs many more such ones to be worth recommending.</P>
<P>BUTTERFLY runs 1:35.  The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.  
Officially it is rated R for "a strong sex scene," but it also contains 
nudity and a shockingly violent scene in which a dog is stabbed to 
death.  The movie would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
