<P>GREAT EXPECTATIONS
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
 "Great Expectations" looks so incredibly beautiful and magnificently styled
it takes you in practically from the first shot, and the luxuriant visuals
continue throughout the movie as director Alfonso Cuaron carefully and
precisely stages every scene for maximum opulence. Through his eyes even the
subways of New York and the crumbling docks of Florida take on a kind of
gritty glamor. The camera sweeps through the streets, soars into the sky and
whirls around stars Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow, creating some of the
most striking cinematography in quite a while. Look closely and you'll see
very calculated color schemes that set the mood of each moment. Listen and
you'll hear a soundtrack that cleverly mixes many different kinds of music
with effortless grace. This movie is a dessert for the eyes and ears.
 But "Great Expectations" is also like a stunning commercial that wows you
but doesn't tell you much about the product. In the final analysis this
modernization of the Charles Dickens classic has almost nothing to say and
next to no emotional impact whatsoever. Dickens' novel was about the
difficulties of transcending the rigid class system in mid-19th-century
England; the movie ocassionally pays lip service to the idea of moving up in
the world while retaining your principles, but primarily it's about a
sweet-natured guy named Finn (Hawke) who can't get over his infatuation with
a blonde knockout of a tease named Estella (Paltrow). What drives this
obsession remains a mystery since Estella never reveals herself to be
anything more than a pretty face with a cold mind. Any man with half-sense
would have wised up after the first couple of years, but Finn's pursuit of
her goes on for almost 20 years, as she repeatedly tantalizes him, arouses
him, and then splits, usually without so much as a goodbye.
 It's difficult to see this kind of victimization as particularly
romantic --unless you're a 13-year-old boy getting your heart pulverized for
the first time by your own little Estella-- but Cuaron and company do
everything in their power to make it look spectacular. Anyone with even the
slightest interest in film production should see "Great Expectations" just
to savor the richness of the design. But don't expect to come away from it
feeling satisfied. Like its heroine, the movie is ultimately easier to
admire than to embrace.
