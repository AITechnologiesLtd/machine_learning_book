<P>Nick Nolte encapsulates the weary, average working man beautifully in a raw,
bristling performance in Paul Schrader's latest exercise in machismo,
"Affliction." Nolte is so ideal in this role that it becomes iconic - his bulky
physique and dark, cropped hair remains the most frustrating character of
suburban domesticity since Jack Nicholson's Bobby Dupea in "Five Easy Pieces." </P>
<P>Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a born loser in a small town in New Hampshire.
He is the sheriff, a schoolbus crossing guard, and performs some chores for a
local, hot-headed businessman. He is also a rotten husband and father who
doesn't have an inkling of how to treat his unctuous daughter. His ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) hates him, his straight-arrow brother (Willem Dafoe) abandoned
him and the family, his father (James Coburn) doubly hates him, and the whole
town seems to have no respect for him. </P>
<P>The only one he has left to support him is his girlfriend, a kindhearted and
loyal waitress named Margie (Sissy Spacek). Margie is a name synonymous with
any small-town tale. Wade does find an avenue of restoring some respect and
dignity when an accidental shooting occurs in the woods. He feels there is a
conspiracy, a cover-up dealing with the building of a ski resort. He becomes
more resourceful, and just as pathetic. </P>
<P>He beats people, drags his daughter around like a rag doll, tries to sue his
ex-wife for custody of the daughter, and gives a speeding ticket to a grieving
son whose father has just died. Wade is convinced that the conspiracy, which
has riled up the town, will make him respectable. </P>
<P>The underlying story in "Affliction" is Wade's relationship to his domineering
father - both are virile yet weak men with no other agenda than to abuse. Wade
is afflicted by his father's abusive past, shown in hand-held grainy footage
with a dark-haired Coburn spouting all kinds of obscenities. It is his
childhood and his mother's untimely death that drives Wade closer and closer to
the brink of madness. </P>
<P>"Affliction" does not have the degree of depth of Paul Schrader's other
machismo portraits, such as "Raging Bull" or "Taxi Driver." Somehow, we see the
weaknesses and afflicted behavior of Wade, but we rarely get close to the
demons tearing him apart. In one shattering scene, he pushes his father against
a wall, threatening to kill him if he gets close to Margie. Another scene has
him pulling his bad tooth out of his mouth and shedding a tear. They are
individual moments of isolated violence, but they do not make for a cohesive,
full-bodied portrait. </P>
<P>This has a well-rounded cast, including Nolte's raw, hard-edged personality
that still makes the character unforgettable, despite the ambiguities. There is
also James Coburn, in perhaps the finest, shrewdest performance of his career,
as the monstrous, unredeeming father with a cold, heavy heart - he does have
one moment where he appears dejected after his wife's death, though there is
nothing remotely sympathetic about this man. </P>
<P>Mary Beth Hurt brings a warm glow to this brutally cold landscape as the
ex-wife. She has a stirring scene where she speaks kindly about Wade's dear old
mother (while 'Ases Death' from "Peer Gynt" plays on the soundtrack) - a
beautiful, poignant moment. Sissy Spacek is nicely understated as the patient
Margie, who finds that Wade can be too much to bear. </P>
<P>"Affliction" has some dark, heavy blues in its cinematographic look that
embodies the snowy environment in Russell Banks' novel - he also wrote "The
Sweet Hereafter." The performances are solid and powerful. But it's Wade's lack
of logic and unmotivated actions that may leave viewers straining to put up
with him and his afflictions. </P>
