<P>"Pygmalion" meets "Saved By The Bell" in the featherweight comedy "She's 
All That," a formula teen flick redeemed by a scattering of inventive 
moments, coupled with the sheer charm of lead players Freddie Prinze Jr. 
and Rachael Leigh Cook. The pre-fab romance, while far from memorable, 
works when viewed as cinematic sherbet; a pleasant diversion to while 
away the time until something more substantial comes along. Put simply, 
if it were the offering on a long airplane flight, I'd pony up a few 
bucks for the headphones.</P>
<P>The plot is old enough to warrant carbon-dating. On a bet, a high school 
hunk sets out to turn an ugly duckling into the prom queen. From that 
sentence, you should be able to anticipate absolutely everything that 
happens in "She's All That." If not, perhaps a "Teletubbies" marathon 
would be more to your liking.</P>
<P>As with all makeover stories, you spot the swan-to-be immediately. She's 
the one whose dark-rimmed glasses, messy hair and rumpled clothing 
couldn't possibly disguise the fact that she is knock-out, drop-dead 
gorgeous. What a treat it would be if, just once, the "ugly duckling" was 
actually unattractive. Or, even better, if the young woman turned to her 
"benefactor" said "No thank you, I like myself just the way I am and have 
no desire to be done up in Cosmopolitan drag. I treasure my individuality 
and, if you require a perky teen queen, why don't you ask Jennifer Love 
Hewitt to the sock hop and leave me alone?"  </P>
<P>But enough dreaming. This is, after all, a corporate product, and the 
filmmakers slavishly adhere to the tried and true teen movie formula. The 
de rigueur soundtrack from flavor-of-the-day pop stars throbs incessantly 
in the background, while scenes are kept short and snappy, to avoid 
challenging those audience members suffering from attention-deficit 
disorder. The young cast is a veritable Whitman's Sampler from recent 
teen movies, with two actors from the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" 
films, two from the "Scream" movies, two from "Can't Hardly Wait," two 
from "The Faculty," both leads from "The Mighty," and one cast member 
each from "Varsity Blues" and "Halloween H20." If these kids decide to 
mate, inbreeding will be of paramount concern. </P>
<P>As is the norm, the supporting characters are broad caricatures. Matthew 
Lillard ("Scream") gleefully chews scenery as a thinly-veiled variant of 
Puck, the social Neanderthal from "The Real World" who gained fame by 
being thrown out of the house by his roommates. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe 
("Halloween H20") hams it up as a "Melrose Place" style villainess, and 
Paul Walker ("Varsity Blues") sneers a lot as a jock with a heart of coal.</P>
<P>Of the adults, only two leave any impression. "Animal House's" Tim 
Matheson looks depressingly haggard as Prinze's father, while comic and 
character actor Kevin Pollack brightens the screen as Cook's papa, a 
chronically-preoccupied pool cleaner with an acerbic wit. </P>
<P>With a film as fluffy as "She's All That," everything hinges on the 
appeal of the lead actors and, thankfully, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael 
Leigh Cook have plenty. Cook is a tiny thing, a sweet-faced youth who 
convincingly projects vulnerability and defensiveness, along with a 
welcome sense of underlying strength. Prinze, who gave a wonderfully 
subtle, complex performance in the delicious black comedy "The House of 
Yes," does solid work here, infusing his character with a nice blend of 
uncertainty and earnestness. Prinze is handsome in an unfinished way - - 
I suspect his face will age well. Hopefully, this film will offer both 
actors the showcase they need to snag more substantial roles in the 
future. </P>
<P>In addition to Prinze and Cook's charisma, "She's All That" manages to 
sneak a few moments of originality into the formula. Early in the story, 
as Prinze's girlfriend explains why she is dumping him for Lillard, the 
film jumps to a flashback sequence on a beach, and as the scene 
progresses, Prinze strolls along the side of the action, offering pointed 
color commentary on the reminiscence. Later, Prinze visits a theater to 
witness Cook in a wickedly funny parody of performance art and, towards 
the end of the movie, an incongruous dance number livens things up. Bits 
like those, along with lead actors able to transcend their material, left 
me with a smile on my face. "She's All That" is a distinctly minor 
pleasure, but a pleasure nonetheless. </P>
