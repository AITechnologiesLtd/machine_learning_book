<P>     This howler of a thriller stars the Artist Formerly Known as Marky
Mark as a young psycho who seduces and later terrorizes a 16-year-old
high-schooler (Reese Witherspoon).  She's a nice girl from a nice family
who learns too much too late about her seemingly sane boyfriend.  Good
afternoon, Mrs. Cleaver.  With better casting, director James Foley
(GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS) might've had something here.  He picked a good
pair for the parents-- Amy Brenneman (HEAT) and the always reliable
William Petersen-- and that's about as far as he got.  Ms. Witherspoon
has no screen presence to speak of, while Underwear Boy is a hollow
creeper, at best.  (And he looks a good ten-years older than his
character!  Oh, how we could've ended things early if Dad had just
spoken up and said "for Christsake, Nicole, he looks like he's thirty!")
Completing the terrible triumvirate is Alyssa Milano, wildly overacting
as Nichole's slut girlfriend (a.k.a. the Bad Influence).  Yes, they're
unwatchable, but the story is so mercifully straight-forward that you
may find yourself getting caught up in the camp.  A surprisingly
engaging ending also keeps the film from collapsing on itself.  If
there's a single redeeming feature to speak of, it's that the story is a
virtual primer for teenage girls on how to identify a predator.  Of
course, they *could* just listen to their dads... </P>
