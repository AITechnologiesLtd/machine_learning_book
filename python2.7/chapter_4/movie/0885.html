<PRE>                            THE GODFATHER PART III
                       A film review by David Alba, Jr.
                        Copyright 1990 David Alba, Jr.</PRE>
<P>     It is here.  Yes, after sixteen years Francis Ford Coppola has
decided to complete the epic story of the Corleone family.  For those
who can remember back to THE GODFATHER PART II, we last left Michael
Corleone sitting alone contemplating the fact that he had ordered the
execution of his own brother, Fredo.</P>
<P>     The third installment of the Godfather trilogy takes place twenty
years after THE GODFATHER PART II.  Aging Michael Corleone is trying to
turn his dream into a reality.  His dream has been to make the Corleone
family completely legitimate.  Michael has been attempting to do this
ever since he took over control of the family at the end of the first
film, THE GODFATHER.</P>
<P>     The film opens with Michael Corleone receiving a humanitarian award
from the Archbishop.  Michael is later approached by the Archbishop,
who has been placed in financial charge of the Vatican.  In an effort to
help the Vatican overcome their financial trouble Michael offers to
donate 600  million dollars in exchange for the Vatican's controlling
interest in a company called Imobilare.  It is Michael's belief that if
he can gain control of the financially strong company he would finally
be able to make the Corleone family legitimate.  Michael encounters
problems when several members of The Vatican council refuse to give
controlling interest of Imobilare to Michael because his family is
involved in organized crime.</P>
<P>     Al Pacino returns to his familiar role as Michael Corleone, along
with Diane Keaton who reprises her role as Michael's estranged wife Kay.
Also returning, as Connie Corleone, is Talia Shire.  The film also stars
newcomers Andy Garcia as Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, and Sophia
Coppola as Michael's daughter.  The fine cast is also joined by veteran
actors Eli Wallach, George Hamilton and Joe Mantegna.  There is also a
small role played by Don Novello who is best remembered as Father Guido
Sarducci on "Saturday Night Live."</P>
<P>     This film is beautifully filmed with splendid cinematography of New
York and Sicily, but it also contains the violence that has become a
trademark of the Godfather films.  The performance of Pacino was
adequate--he portrayed an aging and sick Michael who couldn't overcome
the guilt of having his brother killed--but it is the performances of
Andy Garcia and Talia Shire that really stand out in this movie.</P>
<P>     This film is unarguably not as good as its two predecessors, but I
believe this film is good enough to stand on its own as a continuation
of the Corleone saga.  See this film before someone makes you an offer
you can't refuse.</P>
