<P>'The Whole Nine Yards' plays out with a series of in-jokes, no doubt many of
them planned and executed by the cast but has a few too many pratfalls for
its own good and also has, at the root of its story, a lining of old
fashioned material greed as its theme.  It tries to be many things.....a
comedy, an intriguing thriller, a mob story, a take on marriage, a depiction
of the theory about honour among criminals and last but not least, it tries
to be entertaining and earns an 'A' for effort.  Unfortunately, the film has
to throw in stereotypes and some unbelievable finishing touches in its
climax where things work out just a bit too perfectly for its own good.</P>
<P>Matthew Perry plays a struggling dentist from Chicago named Nicholas
Oseransky (later given the nickname Oz) living in Montreal, Canada with his
French-Canadian wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) and her witch of a mother and
the two of them make fun of Oz whenever they can.  They accuse him of not
being able to make money (with a large debt to pay off), despite being a
dentist, and they poke fun of him at every turn.  Needless to say, Oz's
marriage is on the rocks.  His wife and mother-in-law are painted as
materialistic and/or evil.  Oz comes across as a wimp and lives up to this
tag admirably.</P>
<P>Oz welcomes his new neighbour, a seemingly nice guy named Jimmy Jones (Bruce
Willis)....as he introduces himself that way to Oz.  He is in fact Jimmy
"The Tulip" Tudeski, a ruthless Chicago hit man who has killed almost 20
people in his illustrious career and Oz recognizes him from the tattoo on
his arm.  There is a funny sequence where, upon recognizing Jimmy for who he
is, Oz has a noisy flashback in his mind of newspaper articles and other
mental passages that clue him into the fact that his new neighbour is a mob
connected mass murderer.  What a predicament!  Oz later breaks the news to
his wife about who their new neighbour is and he mentions that rival crime
organizations have put a price on Jimmy's head and Sophie forces Oz,
reluctantly, by threatening to make his marriage more of a hell than it
already is, to go to Chicago and give information to Jimmy's enemies as to
his whereabouts and perhaps collect a hefty finder's fee in the process.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival in Chicago, Oz is greeted off guard in his hotel room by
Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man who supposedly works for a mob
boss named Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak), who wants Jimmy dead.  Oz can't
figure out how the mob got a hold of the information detailing his arrival
and he had no intention of ratting Jimmy out as he later tells a friend he
just came to Chicago to get away from 'the bitch'.  Oz is caught up in a
whirlwind of playing all sides against each other and falls in love along
the way with Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge).  Oz's
dental assistant is named Jill (Amanda Peet) and she has a secret fantasy
about career choice that we find out about a little too late in the film
which gives the film a bitter red herring and many will find it too
preposterous to accept.</P>
<P>As an overlapping story of double crosses, cleverly woven plot intimacies
and character development, 'The Whole Nine Yards' works just fine but as a
superlative comedy, it stops just short and reminded me at many times of
what the Three Stooges would come off like without belting each once
throughout the course of one of their movies.  You know, the dialogue
without the slapstick finish and the ability to make an alternative form of
comedy fall flat without your trade mark finish.  No one in this movie has a
truly great trade mark for comedy and many of them are not good at comedy at
all but some of the in-jokes help.  There is a clever reference to
mayonnaise put on hamburgers used by Willis as John Travolta and Samuel L.
Jackson did in their exchange about what's put on french fries in France
instead of ketchup in 'Pulp Fiction', which of course, co-starred Willis
(and Rosanna Arquette).  Arquette seduces a policeman in this movie (Harland
Williams) in a rather shameless manner which again, just isn't funny or
totally necessary to the plot.  She wants to use him for something she can
do herself without anyone else being involved or finding out about what she
has in mind.</P>
<P>Director Jonathan Lynn who has done 'The Distinguished Gentleman', 'My
Cousin Vinny' and 'Greedy', lets the comedy spiral out of control at many
points and allows his cast to take a few too many liberties with the
original material written by Mitchell Kapner and turn it into amateur comedy
often seen too much in variety shows and hapless sitcoms (Perry IS from
'Friends').  Still, 'The Whole Nine Yards' runs a very acceptable 98 minutes
and all comedies should run well under two hours as most of them in this day
and age simply aren't funny and look more recycled than they do original.
Not quite the case here but then again, it is still a little too low brow
for a recommendation.</P>
<PRE>OUT OF 4 > * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
