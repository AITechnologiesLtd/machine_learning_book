Vaccaro
 Cast: Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott,
Oliver Platt</PRE>
<P>   "Three to Tango" is a romantic comedy that wants to shock
the audience into laughing by presenting some cutesy takes
on the gay culture.  The only difficulty with this theme is that
what would be startling in the 1950's is thoroughly passe by
now.  Since Damon Santostefano, who directed the slight
story, does not have a script that can make much use of the
big screen, "Three to Tango" might fit in just fine as a TV
sitcom, preferably about 7 o'clock on a slow Monday evening.
The story is perfectly suited to the talent of its TV-based star,
Matthew Perry ("Friends").  Even its motif is strained and
implausible: a multimillionaire tycoon, Charles Newman
(Dylan McDermott), hires an architect, Oscar Novak (Matthew
Perry), to spy on his mistress, Amy (Neve Campbell).  Oscar
and his partner Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are fighting to
win a 90 million dollar contract to construct a cultural center
in Chicago.  By catering to the honcho's undignified whim,
Oscar believes he can beat the larger, slicker firm of Decker
(John C. McGinley) and Strauss (Bob Balaban).</P>
<P>   Any moderately intelligent fourteen-year-old will be way
ahead of the thoroughly predictable plot, whose loose ends
are tied up tightly, with justice perfectly meted out to each
principal.  "Three to Tango" is a one-joke comedy based on a
gimmick so slim that Santostefano can barely sustain the
romantic tension for half of its mercifully brief length.  The
gimmick is that Oscar, who has agreed to keep tabs daily on
Amy, is erroneously thought by Oscar's boss Charles to be
gay.  When Amy, an artist who holds frequent exhibitions of
her work, meets Oscar for the first time, it's love at first sight
for both, but given that Amy believes Oscar to be gay and
that Oscar must continue to play the game if he is to win the
contract, the two are unable to consummate their relationship. 
As with virtually all romantic comedies, the two principals
must be kept apart until the very end, a concept easily
fulfilled by this notion.  </P>
<P>   Santostefano, making his major motion-picture debut, plays
the sit-com card to the limit, using several themes to milk
what little comedy can be found in the story.  One such strain
allows Amy to be more honest with Oscar than she would be
with a guy whom she believes to be straight.  She allows him
to watch her while taking her bubble bath and makes him the
guest of honor with her circle of girl friends as they exchange
barbs about the clumsy pick-up lines they've encountered
form men.  In a climactic situation, Oscar is chosen as
Professional Gay Man of the Year by one of Chicago's
prominent gay and lesbian organizations and must give a
speech to a large congregation about the joys of coming out
of the closet.  One of the classier jokes sees Oscar and Amy
indulging in a grotesque-looking tuna melt, stepping outside
the diner, and vomiting into the gutter.</P>
<P>   One wonders what scripter Rodney Patrick Vaccaro had in
mind when he believed that the entire population of Chicago
would be abuzz on the morning that one of its leading dailies
headlined the news that Oscar--who with his partner is
expected to build the culture center--is a gay man.  </P>
<P>   The one redeeming feature of this unimaginatively
photographed movie is the attractiveness of the three actors,
though Dylan McDermott does appear too old for Neve
Campbell whose perpetual smiles are a mite too broad to
believe.  If Matthew Perry has any depth beyond what he has
shown in "Friends," none of it appears here.  You've seen it
all many times before with slightly different motifs, and as
they say, "Three to Tango" is a crowd.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 1999
