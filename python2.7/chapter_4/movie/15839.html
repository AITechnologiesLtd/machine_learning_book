_Jawbreaker_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Glam gals Courtney Shayne (Rose McGowan), Julie Freeman (Rebecca
Gayheart), Marcie Fox (Julie Benz) and Liz Purr (Charlotte Roldan) make
up _the_ clique at Reagan High.  That is, until a birthday prank goes
fatally wrong, and Liz's slot is left open.  Enter Fern Mayo (Judy Evans
Greer), the geekiest girl in school.  After Fern finds out the truth
about what happened to Liz, ringleader Courtney offers the social outcast
a makeover and popularity beyond her wildest dreams--in exchange for her
silence.  Hence the barely noticed disappearance of Fern and the
much-noticed arrival of the one-named Vylette, a blonde, self-proclaimed
bitch who threatens Courtney's crown as the school's "it" girl.</P>
<P>As Julie so eloquently tells Courtney regarding Liz's jawbreaker-induced
death, "You can't hide the truth with a makeover!"  The same can be said
of writer-director Darren Stein's black comedy, which is a mishmash of
elements from _Heathers_, _Clueless_, and _Very_Bad_Things_.  But its
derivative nature aside, _Jawbreaker_ is a darkly fun romp, thanks to
Stein's witty script and stylishly energetic direction (Fern's
Frankenstein-like transformation into Vylette is a nicely surreal touch)
and, especially, McGowan's deliciously wicked turn as the ruthless ice
queen Courtney.  (opens February 19)</P>
