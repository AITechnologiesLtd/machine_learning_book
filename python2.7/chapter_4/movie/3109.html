                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1994 Bryant Frazer</PRE>

Written by Alan Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn</PRE>
<P>     Somebody write a masterpiece for Jennifer Jason Leigh--please.</P>
<P>     The withering wit of the legendary American writer Dorothy Parker
is the best source material any American actress has had since THELMA &
LOUISE drove into the Grand Canyon, and Leigh does wonderful things
with it in the new literary biopic, MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE.
The throaty drawl she delivers her lines with may not be entirely
accurate (Leigh studied tapes of Parker's voice, though some scholars
have suggested that Parker probably spoke differently in her youth),
but it certainly lends an appropriate, insistent rasp to Parker's
trenchant poetry and one-liners.  Her sympathy is apparent and complete
for the Dorothy Parker that she creates--a tragic figure whose fall
from literary grace and relentlessly bad luck with men fueled her
propensity for morbidity and cynicism.</P>
<P>     Dorothy Parker was the most famous member of the Algonquin Round
Table, a cadre of New York writers who met for lunch daily at the
Algonquin hotel on Manhattan's West 44th Street beginning in the 1920s
(for a New York movie, this one has surprisingly little New York in it,
relying overwhelmingly on pretty interiors).  The movie draws a
broad-brush outline of her life, beginning around the time of her
firing from VANITY FAIR.  That incident cements the friendship of
drama critic Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott), who quits his job at the
magazine in a protest against the "stupid" decision to fire
Mrs. Parker.  Benchley is indeed Parker's greatest friend, and could
perhaps be the great love of her life, if the two of them weren't
already married.  The moments when the movie absolutely hits its mark
are the ones illustrating the unconsummated love between Mrs.  Parker
and Mr. Benchley.  That relationship rings so true (and is so well-
performed) that it manages to anchor the whole film--which needs it.
We see characters talk about forming a magazine devoted to
sophisticated discussion of New York ("Why not call it the NEW
YORKER?" someone asks), we watch Mrs. Parker struggle ever-so-briefly
to come to terms with Hollywood, and we get to eavesdrop on the titular
"vicious circle"  of authors (all of whom besides Parker are virtually
unknown today), but none of this is compelling and most of it is
unconvincing.</P>
<P>     Alan Rudolph, the quintessential L.A. director and Robert Altman
crony, obviously cares about this woman's story, but he honestly has
little to add to it.  Some viewers may be encouraged to do a little
reading and research of their own (which they will find more rewarding
in a historical sense), and God bless them for it, but few will find
this to be a satisfactory exploration of the woman and the environment
she worked in.  As long as it's enough to let Leigh show her stuff and
toss around a few choice passages from THE PORTABLE DOROTHY PARKER,
the whole thing glides along nicely.  But other scenes, which rely on
fresh dialogue (by Rudolph and co-writer Randy Sue Coburn) to give the
impression that the writers are having a smashing time with themselves,
are pretty but dull.  The low point comes when Rudolph trots out a
psychotherapist to explain the problems of Parker's dysfunctional
literary family--presumably for the benefit of the audience, since
Mrs. Parker doesn't seem to learn much from his observations that she
didn't already know.  If Rudolph was doing his job, the audience would
know it, too.</P>
<P>     But it's worth the outlay of eight bucks just to see Leigh bring
Dorothy Parker back to life in her own image.  In the film's closing
scenes, when Leigh plays Mrs. Parker as an old woman, her
transformation is nearly complete.  Whether or not Leigh's character is
a faithful recreation of the Algonquin Round Table's most famous
member, it's a luminous creation of its own, and one that lives on in
the memory after the film itself has faded.  One of these days, Leigh
is going to get a great part in a great movie (SHORT CUTS, though
ambitious and admirable, was not that movie).  Until then, we can hope
that this performance will open up new doors for her and get a part in
a film that succeeds as film, not just as an interesting character
study that offers Cliffs Notes to history.</P>
