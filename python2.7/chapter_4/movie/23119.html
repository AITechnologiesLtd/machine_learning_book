<P>When viewing a Bond film, it's extremely hard for a critic to look at it
objectively. For example, all the things I would normally criticize another
movie for (like predictability, clichés, and lousy dialogue) just don't seem
to apply. Nor does it seem to matter that the latest Bond flick, "The World
Is Not Enough," seems a whole lot like every other Bond flick that's been
made. Most other films of this genre are damaged by the audience's overt
familiarity with the subject matter, but Bond only seems strengthened by it.
Let's face it: 007 cannot be judged by normal standards. Is this fair? No,
but it's true. We want to see James Bond do all the things he's been doing
for the better of three decades. Here, he delivers. We get stunts, femme
fatales, nutty gadgets, and a nearly incomprehensible twisting plot that is
of little consequence. This, the 19th installment of the 007 series, proves
that the British charmer still has life left in him.</P>
<P>The plot (though I'm still not sure of it) deals with Renard (Robert
Carlyle), a mysterious terrorist who is trying to steal a nuclear bomb
(natch) after assassinating a good friend of M (Judi Dench). Determined to
have the terrorist brought to justice, M begins a worldwide manhunt and
assigns Bond (Pierce Brosnan) to protect the dead man's daughter, Elektra
King (Sophie Marceau). She and the villain had a prior history, as Renard
had kidnapped Elektra years earlier, only to have her escape before he could
collect the ransom money from her father. Bond tracks down Renard as he is
about to steal the bomb from some nuclear scientists, the leader of which is
Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, and no jokes about the name). The
villain has an interesting quirk: a bullet in his brain is slowly killing
him, but as it burrows in further, it makes him stronger and impervious to
pain. (Do not try this at home.) Once the bomb is taken, all Bond has to do
is get the girl, kill the bad guy, and save the world. No problem, right?</P>
<P>A real strong point of "The World Is Not Enough" is the acting (with one
major exception). I think it's safe to say that Pierce Brosnan feels very
comfortable in his role, and he is now pulling off Bond with suave charm. He
's a different kind of Bond. Low-key and reserved, he doesn't mug for the
cameras, but lets the persona speak for itself. Considering how long the
character has been around (this being the 19th film and all), this is a
valid approach. Brosnan's Bond definitely knows who he is, but he doesn't
flaunt it. It's because of Brosnan's confident performance that the
screenplay's many self-referencing inside jokes and uncharacteristically
raunchy sexual humor come off so well. Brosnan understands that when the
one-liners are purposely over-the-top, they must be played with a straight
face, and he does so.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is game enough. Desmond Llewelyn returns for possibly
the final time as Q, and he's brought along a younger replacement, naturally
referred to as "R" and played by John Cleese. R's scenes are priceless, as
Cleese reprises his upper-class bumbler of Monty Python and Fawlty Towers
fame. Robert Carlyle plays the villain with aplomb, but should have been
given more to do (his supposed super-strength never really comes into play).
Robbie Coltrane appears as a carryover character from "GoldenEye" and lights
up every scene he's in. I suppose Judi Dench could never be considered a
"Bond girl," but this time M is given a whole lot more to do, as her
character now has a personal stake in the proceedings. As could be expected,
more Dench is a good thing. Her M is strong and resourceful, a nice addition
to the old formula.</P>
<P>And what about those Bond girls? There are two of them, Sophie Marceau and
Denise Richards. Marceau's performance is actually pretty good for a Bond
character. She exchanges witty banter with Brosnan and is more than up to
the task. She is certainly attractive (as Bond girls must be), but she's
also a good actress, and a touch above what might be expected of her.
Marceau definitely shines, but the weak link in the cast is clearly Denise
Richards. I was unaware that Bond dialogue was terribly difficult to say,
but Richards manages to stumble over nearly every line. Yes, her breasts are
large. Yes, she looks good in a tank top and shorts. (Regular nuclear
physicist attire, I'm sure. Check your common sense at the door for a Bond
flick.) Unfortunately, any and all sexual attraction is ruined when she
opens her mouth and talks like she's on "Dawson's Creek." It doesn't matter
how wet her shirt gets if every line she speaks makes the audience wince,
and keeping the exact same facial expression whether she's speaking a line
like "Hello, how are you?" or "I have to diffuse that nuclear bomb!" doesn't
help. Somebody needed to tell her that she's exchanging lines with James
Bond, not James Van Der Beek.</P>
<P>Richards-bashing aside, this film has a whole lot going for it. The action
sequences are fun. We open with a motorboat chase, and proceed with a ski
chase, a race through an oil pipeline, and the standard sinking-submarine
bit to top it off. All are loads of fun. Completely improbable, but fun
nonetheless. (I do, for example, enjoy the random gasoline barrels placed to
explode at any moment.) "The World Is Not Enough" also possesses a
better-than-average Bond script, which doesn't mean the plot is any more
coherent, but the dialogue is spicier than normal. After Mike Myers' two
"Austin Powers" films, it's hard not to poke fun at the conventions Bond has
been perpetuating for the last 30 years. This latest installment does that
early and often, alluding to 007's penchant for wine, women, and massive
property damage. Fortunately, the film does this without becoming too
farcical, mainly because director Michael Apted shows a certain reverence
for the Bond traditions. He plays it straight, without allowing too much
winking self-parody. It's a pleasing combination.</P>
<P>Is "The World Is Not Enough" the best Bond film ever? Probably not, though I
'm not terribly qualified to make the decision, having only seen a handful
of them. Still, it will probably be enjoyable to both fans and those
unfamiliar with the Bond series. With smashing action, a game cast, and
snappy dialogue, this film is a fun globe-trotting romp. It's got just about
everything you could want from a Bond movie, and it's one of the most purely
entertaining movies I've seen this year.</P>
