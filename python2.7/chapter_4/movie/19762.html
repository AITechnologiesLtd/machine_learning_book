<P>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
directed by Mike Nichols
starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, Sandy Dennis
Rated R for language and mature themes</P>
<P>In the 1960's, many changes occurred in cinema.  One of them was the
burial of the Production Code.  Once, films were limited by censors who
believed in the well-being of audiences, but now, almost anything can be
said in a movie.  Midnight Cowboy audaciously went beyond the adult
content norm, as did Easy Rider, the story of drug-wielders.  Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf, from the controversial play, went through
censorship hell before Jack Warner decided he would be true to the
play's essence and keep the phrases "h**p the hostess" and "scr**" in
the film.  Mike Nichols and the cast quartet comprised of Elizabeth
Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis create an eerie,
surrealistic film, bitter and dark.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were then at the center of a
tipsy-turvy marriage and some say the two, who play an unhappily married
couple in the film, didn't have to act much.  I'm sure Taylor's and
Burton's rocky marriage contributed to the utterly choking atmosphere
between the two in the film, and the resulting performances are
absolutely riveting.  In the tradition of A Streetcar Named Desire,
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was a Broadway play before it was made
into a movie.  It also has a dark, shaking atmosphere like Streetcar and
it also only has four principle actors.</P>
<P>The couple- George and Martha- in the movie is so dysfunctional.
Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, in one of the funnier moments in the movie,
screams at George (Burton) for not knowing which film the line "What a
DUMP!" is from.  "You're so stupid," she quips, "it's some damned Bette
Davis Warner Bros. epic!"  The movie begins when George and Martha are
returning home, under a moonlit sky, from one of Martha's father's
parties.  George is a college professor and Martha's father is the
college president.  At home, Martha screams and bickers at the weary
George and announces, to his surprise, they are having guests.  "At this
time of the night?!" George yells.</P>
<P>The guests, Honey and Nick, are flawlessly played by Sandy Dennis and
George Segal, and they are new in town.  Nick is a professor in biology
at the college.  The night starts out with few words (they have nothing
to say to each other) and then dips into a nightmare of wicked
flirtation (between Martha and Nick), bitter mockery (between Martha and
George), flowing alcohol, long-kept secrets, and ghoulish games.  Honey
and Nick are surprised at the ceaseless stream of insults the elderly,
middle-aged couple throw at each other and they become ill-at-ease.
They are trapped, however, in Martha and George's web of deceitful and
frightening games.   Honey, a frail woman, becomes sick after one of the
most potent scenes in the film:</P>
<P>"So here I am with this FLOP, this BOG!" Martha screams, pointing at
George.  Martha is playing a game with him- to see what will make him
snap.  He does, breaking a glass bottle on the bar and, to drain out the
noise of Martha's voice, sings loudly "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"
while dancing and twirling with the very drunk Honey.</P>
<P>The film is basically in three acts- the first one just mentioned, the
second one where more games are played at an empty dancing club, and the
huge finale involving Martha and George's marriage-long illusion of a
son.  We have learned that both couples have an inability to reproduce-
Martha has created the image of a son in her mind, she has kept up with
this game throughout her failed marriage.  Nick is impotent and Honey is
frightened of childbirth.</P>
<P>Haskell Wexler's phenomenal black-and-white cinematography only
heightens the emotions on this non-stop two-hour roller coaster.  He
uses a hand-held camera much of the time and telling close-ups.  He uses
shadows, creating a dream-like state for some of the reality-fantasy
sequences.  The shakiness of his camera makes us feel we are looking
through the eyes of the four characters as they go through this inferno,
this earthquake of a night which begins after midnight and ends at dawn.</P>
<P>The performances are very smart and well-done, especially the two
leads'.  Elizabeth Taylor, in her finest performance, her Hamlet, gained
twenty pounds to play Martha alongside her-then husband Richard Burton.
She is flaming, red-hot madness: loving George one minute, and pounding
him the next.  She has so many memorable scenes and never have I seen
such a raging performance from her.  Richard Burton is not to be
outdone- he has quiet moments in the film which are his best.  His
character, George, has a softness that Martha tries to take advantage of
and make fun of.  George Segal is very good as Nick, the perplexed,
naïve new professor and Sandy Dennis goes from soft-spoken to a loud
drunk in the film and it is absolutely fascinating.</P>
<P>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? could almost be called a war film.  It
has the psychological twists and turns of Streetcar but, here, it seems
Elizabeth Taylor is the barbaric Marlon Brando and Richard Burton is the
timid, ruined Vivien Leigh.  The film has been called a black comedy,
and though so many scenes scream a humorous irony and preposterousness,
there isn't much that is funny about this difficult drama.   Mike
Nichols is like Elia Kazan here, pulling out every ounce of emotion from
his actors.  The anger of the film is unsettling and depressing, like
Streetcar's, and the movie feels stagy during many parts of the film.
But I have never been moved more by Mr. Nichols, nor have I seen such a
well-put-together cast for a long time.</P>
