<PRE>Review: Spawn (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>Comic books are often the origins to some very entertaining films.  Which, when 
you think about it, makes a lot of sense.  After all, who wouldn't appreciate 
seeing Batman battle some bad dudes or an agency of Men in Black protecting the 
Earth from intergalactic warfare?  For me, comics are a source of entertainment 
and fun.  But the creation of a film based on Todd McFarlane's popular hero 
"Spawn" is unfortunately never much fun at all.</P>
<P>Bearing a definite resemblance to the sets from the Batman series; the dark and 
gothic surroundings of Spawn help prepare us for the depressing time that lies 
ahead, where the question "Why did I come and see this again?" will be asked 
one too many times.  </P>
<P>The film (and the comic series) is based around the peculiar experiences of Al 
Simmons (Michael Jai White).  Being one of the finest professional assassins in 
the world, Simmons is more than aware of his talents yet underestimates those 
of the people around him.  So after a stylish assassination at the beginning of 
the film (which incidentally was one of my favorite parts), he makes it 
perfectly clear that he "cares" about innocent people losing their lives.  This 
alone is an unforgivable mistake.  Michael Jai White wants us to believe that 
this soon-to-be hero can be as emotional and sensitive as anybody else.  He has 
no problem in firing missiles or using impressive artillery, but later on 
complains that people's lives were in danger.  Even if we push aside the fact 
that no one really wants to see an 
emotional-at-times-and-ruthless-at-other-times hero, White gives Spawn about as 
much emotion as a prison meatloaf - which you could imagine is not terribly 
impressive.
Anyway, after a sudden outburst of emotion and ethics, Simmons soon finds 
himself burned to death with a face that looks like a toasted Pop Tart.  He 
then goes on his merry old way to the fiery realms of hell (which, by the way, 
is fabulously animated) and makes a pact with the devil: he is able to return 
to Earth to see his beloved wife Wanda (Theresa Randle) if he agrees to lead 
Hell's Army in a battle to destroy mankind.  As you may have guessed, Simmons 
heartily agrees and finds himself back on Earth - 5 years after his apparent 
death.</P>
<P>However a few things have changed.  Wanda is now married to Simmons' former 
colleague Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) and are producing sons and daughters whilst 
living a happy family life.  And if this wasn't enough to get used to, he is 
rapidly introduced to the devil's number one assistant Clown (John Leguizamo) 
and Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson), who helps Simmons harness some new fighting 
abilities and works along side him in many fiendish battles.  So as Simmons 
discovers that he is no longer human and always dressed in a mysterious black 
suit and red cape, he struggles to decide whether he should let the forces of 
evil prevail or to defend the Earth at any cost.  Born into darkness and sworn 
to justice, Spawn is a hero to be reckoned with.</P>
<P>It doesn't take many brains to guess that Spawn is not going to get much more 
complicated than the old good versus evil skit; and although it wants us to 
feel for the character of Al Simmons, most audiences will be looking forward to 
the fighting scenes but not much else.  To save the film from total failure, 
Spawn's dazzling eye candy is state of the art computer generated effects. The 
team from Industrial Light and Magic has once again distracted us from a fairly 
weak film by placing us in the middle of a special effects bonanza of the 
highest degree.</P>
<P>Fans of the comic books will get a thrill to find their hero right in front of 
their eyes, and the impressive sets of Spawn give a perfect conversion from the 
dark, gloomy comic artwork.  But director Mark Dippe went no further than this, 
and Spawn fails to achieve many interesting aspects that would create fans 
rather than reward them.  </P>
<P>It's interesting to note that the film spends all of its time explaining how 
the hero emerged, so in the grand scheme of things the end of the film is 
really right at the start of the comic series.  Which is actually something 
pleasing considering that Spawn is a fairly modern character and unknown to 
many - so the possibility of a sequel or a series of films is not unlikely.</P>
<P>Spawn seems to me to be a movie you can like a lot better when you look back on 
it, where you remember how good the special effects were but not really care 
when you're watching them.  The film is solid and consistent with average 
action, a below average plot, dismal acting and great special effects.  Is it 
worth seeing?  Well the cinema, when I got out of my chair and began to walk 
out, I asked myself "What kind of people would really love that film?"  Of 
course, the answer hit me almost suddenly when one of my friends blurted out 
"Wasn't that awesome!"  You got it - teenagers.</P>
<P>2 out of 5 stars
Spawn's dazzling screen mayhem will appeal to some teens, but most people 
should wait for this one to hit the video shelves so they can fast forward to 
the semi entertaining battle scenes and a creative depiction of the undead.</P>
