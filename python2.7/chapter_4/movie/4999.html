<P>     A densely plotted, poorly paced adaptation of the William Diehl
best seller, PRIMAL FEAR does have *one* thing going for it:  the cast
is *very* handsome.  Richard Gere, in one of his good roles, as a high-
profile Chicago defense attorney; Laura Linney (CONGO) as the prosecutor
he once dated; Andre Braugher (TV's "Homicide") as his investigative
assistant; John Mahoney as the state attorney he antagonizes; and the
list goes on.</P>
<P>     They all meet in court, after the brutal murder of the city's
beloved archbishop yields a single suspect:  a soft-spoken altar boy
(played with surprising conviction by newcomer Edward Norton Hey
Ralph!).  Despite a few faces that don't register-- neither Frances
McDormand's psychiatrist nor Alfre Woodard's no-nonsense judge make an
impression-- it's fun to watch so many good actors knock-around on
screen.  Too bad that award-winning television director Gregory Hoblit
doesn't know where to go with it.</P>
<P>     As a potboiler thriller-- or, even, as a decent courtroom drama--
PRIMAL FEAR is just too slow.  Despite an enormous amount of plotting,
the film lacks any real sense of urgency.  Very few scenes *move*.  (You
may even fall asleep!) And, as a character study, PRIMAL FEAR is just
too murky.  Gere's character is a fantastic creation:  a hotshot lawyer
with principals and, ah, convictions.  The problem is that we're never
shown how the events in the film affect *him*.  Instead of, say, a coda
that indicates growth, change, or awareness, all we get are a few
closing shots of him outdoors, standing alone.  What's the point?</P>
