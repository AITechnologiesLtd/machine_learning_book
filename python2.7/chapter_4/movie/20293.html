<P>A silly little action flick, The Chill Factor preaches that `Keeping
Cool is a Matter of Life and Death.'  But they don't mean `cool' like
the Fonz - they mean literally cool, like Hillary Clinton.  In the worst
and most unintentionally hysterical rip-off of Speed yet, the film's two
stars race across Montana to get a deadly biological weapon to an Army
base before – get this – the temperature of the chemical hits fifty
degrees.</P>
<P>The weapon, called Elvis, was created over ten years ago by an Army
scientist, played by David Paymer (Payback).  I think his name is
actually Dr. Richard Long (or directory style - Long, Dick), but I'm not
sure.  While isolated on a tiny desert island, Long tested a very small
amount of Elvis before his computer was done compiling data on the
deadly agent.  Originally intended to affect a 200-yard radius around
the test site, Elvis instead engulfs the entire five-mile island,
killing all eighteen men that were not located within the safety of the
control building.</P>
<P>Long escaped with a slap on the wrist, but his Colonel (played by Peter
Firth, Mighty Joe Young) is tossed in Leavenworth for ten years.  Of
course when he gets out of the clink, he wants to kill Long, steal Elvis
and sell it to foreign countries for - insert Dr. Evil voice here - 100
million dollars.  So Firth heads to Long's current research facility in
Jerome, Montana with a group of ninja-types.  Long story short, the
doctor lives long enough to get Elvis out of there, and Elvis ends up
with Long's fishing buddy Mason (played by Skeet Ulrich, The Newton
Boys), who works the late shift at Darlene's Diner.</P>
<P>Learning about Elvis' temperature restrictions, Mason commandeers an ice
cream delivery truck and, together with its driver (played by Cuba
Gooding Jr., Instinct), the two spend the remaining hour and a half
running from the Colonel and his garrison of black-clad foot soldiers.
Ulrich has the charisma of an orange and Gooding is like Martin Lawrence
turned up to eleven.  Shouldn't Oscar winners be held to higher
standards than the slop he's been pushing?  The only way this could have
been worse is if Jared Leto and Master P were cast in the leading roles.</P>
<P>Among the film's highlights are Ulrich and Gooding, Jr. using a rowboat
to sled down the face of a mountain, which at first sight is a straight
drop-off, but when they're actually hurtling down the hill it has
somehow transformed into a less dangerous forty-five-degree angle.  And
there is the obligatory fight on the roof of the ice cream truck as it
races in and out of tunnels bored into the mountain, which relegates the
bad guy to a Wile-E.-Coyote-type fate.  Are people still entertained by
this?  Thanks to the weapon being nicknamed Elvis, there are also quite
a few witty lines like `Elvis has entered the building' and snappy
comebacks to questions like `Where's Elvis?':  `Dead, last time I
checked.'</P>
<P>Not to be confused with the 1990 Gary Crosby pic of the same name, or
the short-lived 1972 Robert Culp/Eli Wallach televison series, Factor is
the directorial debut of Hugh Johnson (insert additional penis joke
here), who was previously the cinematographer on G.I. Jane.  The film
was scripted by Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda, the former in his debut and
the latter the screenwriter for something called The Shape of Things to
Come, a sci-fi thriller that only played in Canadian theaters when
released in 1979.  Plus, his name is almost a type of cheese, so that
should tell you something, too.  (1:42 - R for violence and language)</P>
