<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This routine noir feature just doesn't cut it -- it's story is too
implausible and it lacks proper tension. Zachary Scott plays a charming
scoundrel who uses the name Ronnie Mason back East, but in Los Angeles
he is Ronnie Marsh. He lives off vulnerable women by sweetly wooing them
and then becoming dishonest and ruthless when he goes after their money.
We first see him in the hotel apartment of his dead girlfriend, Mrs.
Turner, whereby he steals her wedding ring and lifts some money from her
purse, and when the landlady knocks on the door, he climbs out the
window and flees. When the police investigate, they find a suicide note
next to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Turner (Ridgely) tells the police his wife ran off with a man named
Mason who said he was a writer, and he is positive that she would not
commit suicide, as the police tell him that all they can do is keep the
case open, as the newspapers reported it as a suicide because of the
suicide note found. What gives this opening scene its noir look, is the
shadowy photography James Wong Howe provides in Scott's escape through
the window.</P>
<P>Scott gets on a bus for Los Angeles and steals a service pin from a
sleeping passenger. When he looks for a vacant room to let in Los
Angeles, he has the service pin on his suit lapel and poses as a wounded
veteran. He talks Hilda Fenchurch (Faye Emerson), who is a stenographer
for a college, into letting him rent the place. When she sees his
service pin and is impressed by his good manners and handsome looks, she
changes her mind about not renting the room. She was at first opposed to
her mother's idea of renting the room because it would mean additional
work. But she now rationalizes that she rented the room for patriotic
reasons since there is a housing shortage due to the war.</P>
<P>Scott has already charmed Hilda's mother and he soon courts Hilda, and
he wins her over with his earnestness and smooth gift of gab. He gives
her the ring he stole from Mrs. Turner and tells her it's his
grandmother's, and that they should keep their engagement a secret until
he can sell a story and afford to marry her.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Hilda's impressionable teen-age sister, Anne (Mona Freeman),
returns from being treated in the hospital for a sickness. The young boy
who wants to date her, Bunky (Erdman), finds that he is being rejected.
It seems that the 28-year-old Scott secretly takes Anne out dancing
evenings and plies her with liquor, and actively turns her against
Hilda. This whole scene was really unconvincing, but, nonetheless, he
manages to continue to charm the mother (Servoss). But he arouses
Hilda's suspicion when Bunky phones and tells Hilda that Anne is not
with his group of friends at night but with Scott, and that he saw Scott
at the bank cash several checks for stories he already sold. Hilda
reacts angrily, going into his room to snoop and discovers a revolver in
his suitcase. She confronts him and demands he leaves, but as hard as it
is for me to believe, he has Hilda's mother and sister on his side and,
thereby, he remains.</P>
<P>When Anne tells the family that they are engaged, this is too much for
Hilda, who can't reason anymore with her naive sister. She realizes that
he asked her sister to marry him when he found out that she will inherit
a considerable amount of money when she marries. She then goes to the
college psychoanalyst, Dr. Silla (De Camp), to tell of her plight. Dr.
Silla analyses the situation and decides to visit the Fenchurch home for
dinner. There she gets into a conversation with Scott and comes to the
conclusion he is an egotist, someone who is love with himself, who spent
his adult life luring women but he doesn't respect them. She makes a
plan with Hilda that they will get Scott to come to her beach house and
there she will break him down and expose him for the scoundrel he is.</P>
<P>But things happen very fast and Hilda can't wait for that meeting. Her
opportunity for revenge comes when a shy and absent-minded science
professor, Dr. Lang (Bennett), someone who admires her but can't get up
the nerve to ask her out, comes by her house and asks her to do
inventory in his lab. She discovers a tube of poison while there and
sneaks it out of the lab, planning to poison Scott by inviting him to
dinner with her at the beach house.</P>
<P>When Dr. Lang tells Dr. Silla he can't understand why Hilda stole the
test tube of poison, she tells him she understands. She gets him to
bring along an antidote for the poison and the two rush to the beach
house, losing a police car tailing them for speeding. At the beach house
they find that Hilda couldn't go through with poisoning the scoundrel.
Anxious to leave the beach house, Scott rushes out and when he does,
there is Mr. Turner waiting for him. While running away from Turner,
Scott slips and falls to his death down a cliff. Why and how Turner was
there, was never explained, except he seemed to be tailing Scott on his
own.</P>
<P>The story simply didn't add up, but its quick pace helped move things
along, and Faye Emerson and Zachary Scott can always be counted on to
give competent performances. But nothing can save this film from
mediocrity, as the film made a febrile attempt to study a psychopath,
but was restrained by the film's weak script and lacklustre directing
effort.</P>
