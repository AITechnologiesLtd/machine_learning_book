<P>How interesting can it be to film people's responses to loneliness, loss of
love and women's liberation? New York filmmaker Henry Jaglom ("New Year's Day,"
"Eating") has taken the route of doing just that - filming people's responses
to those subjects, and the result is one of the most profound, exciting and
personal films of the 1980's. </P>
<P>Henry Jaglom plays a film director named Danny who is shaken and perplexed by
his girlfriend, Helen (remarkably played by Andrea Marcovicci) who wants to be
left alone, much to Danny's chagrin, when she sleeps. After she brushes her
teeth, Danny has to leave so she can sleep in peace. On that note, Danny flies
to Santa Monica to see his brother (Michael Emil) who is in the real estate
business, and who deplores Danny's profession insisting it isn't work, it is
"play." His brother is co-owner of an antique theater that is about to be
demolished after having sold it. Danny gets the creative idea to stage and film
his old friends and acquaintances in the theater, and so he makes invitations
to all who are lonely on Valentine's Day to attend. A surprising number of
people show up including his emotional companion Helen, a singer; Dave
Frishberg who plays the piano in a beautiful montage sequence; Sally Kellerman
as a distraught, popular movie star who all the men flirt with; Kathryn Harrold
as an actress who wants to have a family; Steven Bishop who gets to play the
guitar; and even the sage Orson Welles, in his last role, as a film director
who delivers profound insights on women's liberation, loneliness and
filmmaking. And for avid film buffs, Oja Kodar makes a pleasing guest
appearance as a Yugoslavian woman who admires Danny for his truth and honesty
(Oja was Welles's longtime collaborator and companion and appeared with him in
"F for Fake"). </P>
<P>"Someone to Love" is an eye-opening pseudo-documentary of relationships and
what it means to have a companion, and the benefits and hazards of being
lonely. It is the only film from the 80's to deal honestly, and with startling
candor, on such issues. The question of Danny's credibility as a filmmaker is
brought up at one point when he films Helen while dancing with her and she gets
visibly upset. To quote Michael Powell, is all this filmmaking healthy? Is
Danny asking questions that are too personal, or does he really want his
brother to mingle and meet people at this offbeat party? Could it be that Danny
is the only miserable person at this party?</P>
<P>"Someone to Love" has no real ending but it does have a stirring conclusion
with Welles smoking a cigar and cracking up as he expounds on what Jaglom may
or may not have accomplished in his film. "Your films are very different from
mine," says Welles. "You like happy endings because you are a sentimentalist."
"Someone to Love" is never sentimental but it is a love letter to all artists
(and people) who are miserable, happy or unhappy about life and love, and to
those who consider loneliness a virtue. Are women better off without a male
companion or a marriage? Are men also plagued by the same questions? These may
be questions you ask yourself everyday but rarely are these questions ever
explored in a film. "Someone to Love" is a sad, passionate, funny, messy film
of great magnitude by a great director. And yes, his films are very different
from anyone else's.</P>
