<PRE>Road Trip </PRE>
<P>Another Gen-X sexy summer comedy about obnoxious boys and the slightly 
smarter girls who try to tame
them. The story revolves around four college dudes from Ithaca University who 
must travel to Austin,
Texas in order to save one of the dudes' love life. </P>
<P>The title says it all so there's not much need to list the funny, wacky and 
just plain insane pratfalls our
heroes will likely endure given the circumstances. This is a college movie so 
you can take a guess as to what
kind of humor is going on here. Does it work? Yes... if you're not easily 
offended! But it's unfortunate the
screenplay doesn't have much going for besides the jokes which makes the film 
one-dimensional. It's your
call. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
