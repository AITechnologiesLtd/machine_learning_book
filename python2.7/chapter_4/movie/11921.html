<P>Summary
    A young man is caned with a thick stick to his backside and he should be in
more pain or distress than he appears, but apparently it is more or less a
common ritual for him and the boys living with him. His name is Danny Embling
(Noah Taylor) a teenager living in a boarding school in Australia in the mid-
1960's. Although he is a bright student, he is tormented by most of his
classmates. He is not much of an athlete, does not have many friends and he has
an unfortunate slight stutter for which he is given the nickname "Bird" (it is
actually more like "B-B-B-Bird"). It seems like it should be a tough time for
him, but he is actually doing rather well. He keeps with his studies, sees his
hazing as more of a petty nuisance, and has one good friend who he confides
with. His life is about to get better.
    Her name is Thandiwe (Thandie Newton), a pretty girl from the school across
the river. It is an all-girls school that shares many social events with
Danny's, and their eyes meet at a Rugby match. They do not speak until their
next encounter, at a debate between the schools and it is obvious they like
each
other. They make a date for an upcoming dance, which almost becomes a disaster
as Danny is informed that he cannot go, but the two of them sneak away from
their perspective groups and spend time together. Their relationship starts out
with playful flirting.
     The relationship develops as the couple attempt to spend as much time
together as possible, usually by sneaking out of their dormitories to meet in
the early morning hours, risking possible expulsion. They talk about their
families a great deal, flirt and experiment with sex. They also have some
difficulties, including misunderstandings regarding a letter written by
Thandiwe
that gets into the wrong hands, and the constant threat of other students
reporting them to school officials. Danny also risks physical harm as he
foolishly tries to defend his dignity and fight the school boxing champ in the
ring.
    Of all possible events to threaten Danny and Thandiwes' relationship, it is
the most unlikely that strikes a mortal blow. The political unrest in Uganda,
Africa (where Thandiwe comes from) threatens her parents, who are writers that
speak out against injustice. Their lives are in danger, and Thandiwe must
return
home to help the family in a time of need. She may not return, and Danny must
deal with losing his first love. </P>
<P>Commentary
    I am a fan of most John Hughes films, but the teenagers in his films do not
always act and behave like most teenagers in the real world. His films are more
like teenage fantasy, and they are entertaining, but the teenagers in
"Flirting"
seem so real it is an absolute pleasure to watch them. The relationship between
Danny and Thandiwe is very honest, sweet and well written. Dare I say that the
chemistry between these two young actors was more powerful then many films
concerning adult relationships? I do.
    One of the strengths of the movie is that not much is made of the racial
differences between the teenagers. Thandiwe is African American, but the only
racial stereotypes present are the occasional crude comments about the color of
her skin by Danny's schoolmates. There is also an uncomfortable moment when the
parents meet each other for the first time after a school play and are clearly
surprised. The scene is a great example of the wonderful writing and directing,
and is one of the films' best moments.
    Another strength is the inclusion of the political uprising in Uganda.
There
could have been many different ways for the relationship between the teens to
be
threatened, but by making it such an important event on such a large scale (and
beyond their control), it makes it much more poignant and sad.
    Few movies about teenage love are as effective as this one. The characters
seem absolutely real, as if they were in a documentary about Australian
boarding
schools. The two lead actors were relatively unknown this time, adding to this
effect. The only recognizable face is that of Nicole Kidman, playing an
upperclassman looking over Thandiwe. 
I could almost see this film be rewritten into a John Hughes type film, but
that
one would have popular young actors, a pop music soundtrack, a predictable
romance and a typical Hollywood ending. You will see that watching "Flirting",
and it is a real treat.</P>
