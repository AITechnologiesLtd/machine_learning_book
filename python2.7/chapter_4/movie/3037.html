<P>     In 1993's THIS BOY'S LIFE, the memoirs of author/professor Tobias
Wolff were committed to film.  Wolff's affecting story, a coming-of-age
tale set in the Pacific Northwest, concentrates on the difficulties
experienced by a boy growing up in a single-parent household.  Also
based on an autobiography (that of Sheila Ballantyne), director Anthony
Drazan's IMAGINARY CRIMES explores similar terrain (both literally and
figuratively--this movie takes place in Oregon).  In this case, the
central figures are Sonya (Fairuza Balk) and her widowed father Ray
(Harvey Keitel).</P>
<P>     IMAGINARY CRIMES opens in 1961 with Ray operating a series of
sophisticated cons designed to keep his family fed and sheltered.  His
wife Valery (Kelly Lynch) is eight years dead from cancer, leaving him
two daughters:  high school senior Sonya and her younger sister Greta
(Elisabeth Moss).  Ray has never held a solid job, instead opting to
run get-rich-quick scams.  Although these have never paid off, Ray
refuses to face reality, convinced instead that one day his ship will
come in.  Sonya, a veteran of broken hopes, has come to accept the
bleakness of her life, much like Valery had done before her death.</P>
<P>     The story is told in two phases:  the "current" struggles of the
Weiler family during late 1961 and early 1962, and a series of
flashbacks framed as short stories written by Sonya.  These chronicle
certain events from the previous decade, both before and after Valery's
death.</P>
<P>     As an account of growing up in a family constantly on the verge of
blowing apart, IMAGINARY CRIMES is often touching, and occasionally
poignant.  This is Sonya's story, not Ray's or Greta's, so ultimately
the viewer's emotional response is determined by the effectiveness of
Drazan's dramatization of the young woman's turmoil.  For the most
part, he is successful in toning down the melodramatic elements in
favor of a more honest approach.</P>
<P>     Oddly, some of the earlier sequences might have been enhanced by
the use of a little *more* skillfully-applied melodrama.  Until the
flashback of Valery's death thirty minutes into the film, it's
difficult to connect emotionally with any of the characters.  That's a
rather long time for an audience to be held aloof, regardless of the
eventual payoff's impact.</P>
<P>     The similarities with THIS BOY'S LIFE don't end with common
themes.  Harvey Keitel's performance echoes that of Robert De Niro in
the earlier film.  Keitel occasionally seems trapped by the restraint
demanded by this role, which makes for a few awkward moments.  In
general, however, the actor acquits himself as the father about whom
his eldest daughter says:  "Never has a man less equipped for
parenthood tried so hard."</P>
<P>     With an unforced portrayal that makes use of her expressive eyes,
Fairuza Balk (of GAS FOOD LODGING) is the real star of IMAGINARY
CRIMES.  The central question for Sonya throughout the movie is whether
her father, a con man, really loves her and her sister--indeed,
whether he's capable of love at all.  Balk accurately and believably
conveys the turmoil caused by this uncertainty.</P>
<P>     Those finding the recent wave of coming-of-age stories to their
taste will probably appreciate what this movie has to offer.  IMAGINARY
CRIMES is a difficult film to connect with, but once the connection is
made, it rewards with an unexpectedly rich emotional texture.</P>
