<PRE>Wag The Dog
Grade: B- (Wait for Video and/or discount shows)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man, Toys, Avalon)
Written for the screen by Hillary Henkin and David Mamet (Oleanna, 
Homicide) from the novel American Hero by Larry Beinhart
Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro, Willie Nelson, Denis Leary
Year of Release: 1997
Rating: R</P>
<P>Deserves Recognition for: Actor (Hoffman), and an almost Criswell-like 
ability to anticipate a certain current scandal</P>
<P>Capsule Review:
    This ultra-satirical comedy has a great writer (David Mamet), an 
exemplary cast (Hoffman, Deniro, Anne Heche, and Woody Harrelson to name 
a few), and a killer, eerily prescient, hook (in order to get a 
struggling President reelected , Hollywood & Washington team up to 
declare war on an unsuspecting Albania), - so why isn't it funnier, 
dammit? Director Barry Levinson, whose comedic sense has drastically 
slipped since the days of DINER and TIN MEN, struggles to find the right 
tone here, resulting in a film that, for every scene of genuine 
hilarity, all too often just lies there smirking at itself about how 
darn clever it is. Still, there are some truly inspired bits, and 
Hoffman does his best work in years as a thinly-veiled caricature of the 
legendarily egomaniacal producer Robert Evans. If for no other reason, 
watch it sometime for William H. Macy's cameo as a secret agent with 
some definite views on Mexican Desserts.</P>
