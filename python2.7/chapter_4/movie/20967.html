<P>The trick in a movie with a title like Love of the Game is to, by the end of
the movie, redefine 'game' so that it refers not so much to sports but to
the main character's life situation. Thus winning or losing the game means a
little more. It's a common enough trick, from Rocky to Happy Gilmore to
Varsity Blues. Or, talking Kevin Costner, Tin Cup. Which is to say Love of
the Game is, as the title also suggests, a love story, or, more
specifically, a love triangle--aging superstar Billy Chapel (Costner),
freelance writer Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), and America's favorite
already-romanticized (Field of Dreams) past-time.
None of this is unexpected. What is a surprise, though--for those who didn't
read Michael Shaara's novel--is how Love of the Game isn't structured over
the length of a season, as with Bull Durham, but instead uses the last game
of Billy Chapel's season as a springboard into everything that's gone
before. Meaning yes, the bulk of the movie happens in the movie's past. It's
all flashbacks, occasioned by pained expressions from the dugout, reached
through soft dissolves, all that, which has the effect of gradually making
this 'last' game more and more important. Or, of making us realize how
important it is. Which is all good and fine.
The problem with non-linear approaches like this, however, is that--unless
every flashback is both a surprise and absolutely necessary narrative
exposition, qua Tarrantino--it can get old real fast. As in repetitive. As
in every scar and every comment has an explanation. In Love of the Game,
they're all explained, which is a little bit of overkill. And you can tell
when the explanations are coming, too, which doesn't help any, and doesn't
do anything to subtract from the occasionally nauseous levels of nostalgia
already circulating. But then it a movie about baseball. And it is Kevin
Costner.
And it is--in spite of all this 'ghosts of Christmas past' feel--a
dramatically sound movie: the 'story of them' (Billy Chapel and Jane Aubrey)
is a strong little story, with no real bad guys, lots of bad luck, all the
things we've liked since When Harry Met Sally, Forget Paris, all those. And
this 'story of them' does catch up with the present-story very nicely (see:
without intruding), in a way that gives us no real choice but to care,
to--as with any date-movie--beg for the happy ending. However, unlike most
date movies, Love of the Game doesn't wholly give itself away until the
closing frames.
But of course Billy and Jane aren't the only two characters here in search
of restoration. Everyone in the movie wants to be redeemed, and, like
dominos, they more or less are, which is a little too picture-perfect for
comfort. Which isn't to say you're not happy for the minor characters when
they get 'redeemed,' it just feels a little cheap immediately afterwards.
Perhaps it's meant to be all about the moment, though, in which case it's a
success.
The thing is, though, there are so many moments, better than two hours of
them. Which would be fine is Love of the Game were epic in scope, like, say,
Dances with Wolves, Waterworld, orThe Postman, but it's not. Or, it tries
hard to be more sweeping than it is. Meaning it's a little inflated. And
this simply because every picture in it has a story. But so be it. It is
satisfying in other ways. There is a definite Unforgiven-feel, of the aging
hero proving himself in high style, which America so loves. And there is a
seriously magical moment when director Sam Raimi cues Bob Seger when Bob
Seger is exactly what's needed, which manages to keep us from dismissing the
rest of the movie, on the off-chance that there might be another magical
moment like that, more chances to cry. Love of the Game is full of them.
