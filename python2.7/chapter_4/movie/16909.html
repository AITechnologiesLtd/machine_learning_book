<PRE>A REVIEW OF "SHOWGIRLS"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1995
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>Movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good, the bad, and
the despicable. I originally wrote this review for my college
newspaper back in '95, but I wanted to re-write it because not
all retro reviews should be about the classics. We need to be
warned about some truly awful films, too. This picture was so
bad, it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating (see ratings
chart below). The only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that
being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing
than renting a porno. So, it does indeed have some plusses...</P>
<P>In fairness, Elizabeth Berkley is certainly worth seeing in the
buff. And her ability to whine and irritate us, even while nude,
was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress Nomi Malone.
This character is not smart, not interesting, and (deliberately?)
far too annoying far too often. Like in 1998s "Bulworth", when
the movie was over I didn't care one little iota about the main
character. At least Warren Beatty tried to make a statement with
his dreary and overrated film, though. "Showgirls" is too stupid
to make a statement.</P>
<P>Some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "All
About Eve" of all things! If exploitation expert Joe Eszterhas
was half the screenwriter that Joseph L. Mankiewicz was, he'd
be...well, he'd be a good screenwriter. Instead, this project may
have sunk his career. He wrote the (HA HA!) script and the
usually reliable Paul Verhoeven directed. The same team who
created a GOOD sex-film in 1992 ("Basic Instinct") struck out
here with their occasional violence, gratuitous X-rated sex
scenes, and numerous (and quite unnecessary) lesbian overtones.</P>
<P>The predictable storyline revolves around Nomi streaking into Las
Vegas to make it big as a dancer. After the supposed street-smart
young "lady" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed
yokel in the opening sequence, she befriends a tailor of the
glamorous stage production at the "Stardust Hotel". Nomi doesn't
take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of
dirty dancing right away. First, she becomes a lap dancer at a
scummy strip club. She sells her hot little wares at "The
Cheetah" for a short time, turning on the fictitious customers
and the actual theatre audience. Hey, I never said she wasn't a
hot number...</P>
<P>Maybe it's that, her body, which gets her into the big-time when
the star of the "Stardust Hotel", Crystal Connors (Gina Gershon)
stops into the strip club (it certainly isn't her brains or
pleasant disposition!). Crystal requests a private lap dance for
her boyfriend (Kyle MacLachlan). He also happens to be the
pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show. Crystal gets Nomi
onto the "Stardust" team and, after an interminable amount of
time, Nomi "earns" the role of Crystal's understudy. The slut
then deliberately injures and hospitalizes Crystal.</P>
<P>It was almost laughable that Nomi had the guts to claim that
she's "not a whore". That's a phrase we hear a few different
times and it's completely ludicrous. Of course she is! She sells
her soul to make it big, but in the end we're supposed to believe
that she's a better person than that. We're supposed to root for
her. No way! She's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved
nothing--least of all vindication in the...ahem...climax. She is
not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that
the audience should think that she is.</P>
<P>The sub-plot with a male dancer (Glenn Plummer) who claims to see
talent in Nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance
naked a little bit more. It sure ain't character development!
Plummer also appeared in "Speed" in '94 in a smaller, yet better
role. This sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to
deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth
control.</P>
<P>Kyle MacLachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his
standards have dipped since appearing in "Blue Velvet". That
picture was weird, but some critics claim it's one of the best
movies of the '80s. Now ol' Kyle can say that he acted in one of
the worst of the '90s, too. His sleazy character is important to
"Showgirls", but we don't learn anything about him. He uses
people to get what he wants, but that only means that he fits in
well with the other characters in this movie. Is he a villain?
Who cares!</P>
<P>Ultimately, this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit. Everyone
must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation,
especially the riotous romp between Berkley and MacLachlan in his
pool. What few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited
this movie is. Everyone's either having sex, exacting revenge, or
WISHING they were having sex or exacting revenge. It's just too
hard to take (especially for over two hours). If we must be
exposed to the evils of the Vegas world, why couldn't Verhoeven
have also made a point of highlighting the whispers, grunts, and
other sounds during the dance numbers? It's hard to care about
these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of
doing on-stage.</P>
<P>Berkley may have a future in Hollywood because she can dance and
she has a great body. After all, the world of porn is still an
active, dishonourable profession. Perhaps Berkley could join
their ranks and leave the REAL acting to Pauly Shore and Cindy
Crawford. Oops, they're bad actors, too. Well, at least, they're
not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty Nomi Malone.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Ironically, Elizabeth Berkley played virtuous and
"holier than thou" Jessie on the teeny-bopper TV show, "Saved By
The Bell", before breaking onto the big screen.</P>
