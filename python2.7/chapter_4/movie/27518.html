<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Of all the possible choices of career or hobby, writing is hardly the most 
glorious. It is, in general, a solitary pursuit, the sort of thing on 
which a person can labour for days, months, even years, and have little to 
show for it (or, at least, little of true quality). Writers are usually 
invisible behind their work, and even when an author does have the 
opportunity to discuss his metier in public, the content of the questions 
rarely rises above the cliche of, "Where do you get your ideas?"</P>
<P>It is refreshing, then, to have experienced "Finding Forrester", a movie 
which is not only about an author (in fact, two of them), but which 
depicts both the joy which comes from writing and the tenacity it demands. 
It is about much more than that, of course -- it is a coming of age story, 
and a teacher/student story, and a story about fighting injustice. But 
whereas director Gus Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting" -- to which "Finding 
Forrester" bears both notable similarities and enormous differences -- was 
about a mathematics prodigy but could have chosen any number of other 
subjects for the title character's expertise, writing is a fundamental 
component of "Finding Forrester".</P>
<P>Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown) is a black teenager growing up in the Bronx. 
He's a smart kid, but in order to gain acceptance with his peers, he only 
does enough classwork to pull off a C average, and instead concentrates 
his skills on the basketball court. The only outlet he permits his mind is 
his writing, which he keeps secret. Then two events occur, almost 
simultaneously, which force Jamal to rethink the direction of his life. 
First, his top marks on standardised tests invite the interest of a 
prestigious private school, which offers him a full scholarship and a 
chance at a very different life. Second, a friendly dare prompts Jamal to 
sneak into the apartment of a reclusive old man known only as "the 
Window".</P>
<P>When the Window scares Jamal away, the boy accidentally leaves behind his 
journals, filled with the stories he wrote. When he retrieves the 
notebooks, Jamal discovers that the Window has included critical comments 
on every page. Eventually, Jamal convinces the old man to speak with him 
face to face, and it turns out that the Window is Robert Forrester (Sean 
Connery), a Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote "the great American novel" 
half a century ago and hasn't been seen or heard from since. Forrester 
reluctantly agrees to become Jamal's mentor, while Jamal tries to 
penetrate the mystery of what caused Forrester to abandon the outside 
world.</P>
<P>Much of "Finding Forrester"'s success is derived from the two central 
actors. Connery is back in fine form after a drought of good starring 
roles. He captures all the key elements of Forrester's personality: his 
eccentricity, his paranoia, his tragedy, his innate benevolence, and most 
importantly, his love of writing. Although this is a role that could 
easily have been taken to extremes by a lesser actor, Connery never 
indulges himself. Consider the scene where Forrester finally emerges from 
his apartment only to panic when he finds himself alone in the midst of a 
bustling crowd. Instead of playing up character's response, Connery keeps 
his reactions subdued; he makes us feel Forrester's anxiety, rather than 
forcing it down our throats.</P>
<P>Newcomer Brown proves to be a real find, his performance here at least as 
much of a breakout as Matt Damon's was in "Good Will Hunting". Brown 
brings an extremely natural feel to the film; I have no idea what his 
background actually is, but he certainly made me believe he had grown up 
in an environment not unlike Jamal's. Despite the fact that Connery has 
decades more acting experience, Brown is a good match for the veteran 
performer, holding his own in scenes of considerable emotion and power.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Mike Rich is a tremendous piece of work, an excellent 
example of how economy in writing leads to a better product. In between 
the lines of the central storyline about Jamal's relationship with 
Forrester, Rich slips in a number of secondary tales -- Jamal's efforts to 
fit in at the private school (epitomised by a not-so-friendly rivalry on 
the basketball court), his budding romance with rich white student Claire 
(Anna Paquin), his difficulty maintaining ties with his friends from his 
old high school, and his need to decide between writing and basketball as
his true passion. During the movie, I started to fear that some of these 
threads would go underdeveloped, only to discover as the credits rolled 
that this was by no means the case. Rich tells each aspect of the film in 
perfect measure, for the most part neither leaving his subplots stillborn 
nor dwelling on them any more than necessary.</P>
<P>It's not all perfect -- one major storyline, in which Jamal is accused of 
plagiarism by a jealous teacher (F Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe a 
basketball player from the Bronx could possess such talent, is a little 
too familiar. The way it plays out recalls the denouement of "Scent Of A 
Woman" and many other films; it's a surprising concession from an 
otherwise highly creative movie. Paquin's character also goes slightly 
astray in the picture's closing minutes, as the subplot about her and 
Jamal never really reaches fruition. It's as though one last scene between 
them was accidentally omitted from the final cut. This is a particular 
shame because Paquin, as usual, gives a bright and energetic performance.</P>
<P>But whatever the faults of the screenplay, they are minor, and more than 
compensated for by Van Sant's excellent direction. There is an unusual 
liveliness to "Finding Forrester", and this is particularly impressive 
given the static nature of the subject material. Van Sant gives 
Forrester's lessons a palpable verve. It's enough to make you wonder why 
all English teachers can't be this passionate, and why they aren't all 
this successful at communicating that passion to their pupils.</P>
