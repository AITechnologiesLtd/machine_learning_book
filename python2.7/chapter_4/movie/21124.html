<P>The tagline on Random Hearts reads "In a perfect world, they never would 
have met." In a perfect world, I never would have seen this movie. The 
biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film, Kay Chandler (Kristin 
Scott Thomas) and Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) are the only two 
major characters alive; resulting in little doubt that they will end up 
together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some 
production.</P>
<P>Dutch is a sergeant in Internal Affairs at the District of Columbia 
police department. Kay is a congresswoman from New Hampshire. Although 
they both think they are happily married, their spouses are cheating 
with each other behind their backs. Dutch and Kay are soon widowed when 
a plane goes down carrying their partners; they subsequently discover 
the affair. The rest of the film is the pointless, unrealistic and 
often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship 
that they were blind to, and getting to know each other in the process.</P>
<P>Two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film. Dutch 
is trying to arrest a fellow officer, a task that seems rather ordinary 
for Hollywood fare. All the great stereotypes get pulled, including my 
personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered 
soon thereafter. Kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her 
campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter 
from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal. These sub plots 
could have made for semi-interesting points, but the film seems afraid 
to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth, and 
consequently suffers.</P>
<P>Random Hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells. Although 
both Kay and Dutch are given their own sub plots, they seem to never 
deal with anyone other than themselves or each other. There is plenty of 
opportunity, Dutch having a partner and Kay having close friends and her 
daughter, but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships. 
Veteran actor and director of this film Sydney Pollack, and critically 
acclaimed up-and-comer Dylan Baker both have cameo roles, but be careful 
not to blink too much or you will miss them both.</P>
<P>Other than its weak plot, it is hard to criticize Random Hearts. 
However, it is also hard to compliment it. Had the film taken some small 
risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have 
tasted more like a well frosted cake, rather than the dry one that 
equates to be.</P>
