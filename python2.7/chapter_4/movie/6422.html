<P>     This big-budget Christmas comedy has a coarse and very obvious wit,
which would be perfect for kids if this were a kid's movie.  I'm not
sure it is, even though the humor is as broad as the shoulders of its
star, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The Terminator plays a daddy desperate to
find the most coveted toy in Minneapolis-- a Turbo Man doll-- on the day
before Christmas.  Sure, the wee ones will love seeing Arnie chased
through a living room by a reindeer, pummeled by purses in the Mall of
America, and all the roughhouse rowdiness between him and Sinbad, who
plays his postal-carrying rival.  But what will they make of the darker
elements, like Phil Hartman's lecherous next-door neighbor?  Or Schwarz-
enegger slugging a Conga line of Clauses in a bootleg toy factory?  Or,
my favorite, the smoldering head of a wise man that gets drop-kicked
into a crowd of carolers?  (Heh.  Who *hasn't* wanted to cause unrest
among ye merry gentlemen?) Tolerating the rest of the movie, with its
lazy plotting, frantic pacing, and a message that violence is a solution
to everything, is a greater challenge.  As is accepting the fantasy
ending, which, while extremely upbeat, veers uncomfortably into LAST
ACTION HERO territory.  Stay through the credits for the final gag.
Great soundtrack, too, with several swingin' tunes from the Brian Setzer
Orchestra.</P>
