<P>Maureen and Eddie are crazy in love. They live in a run-down apartment in 
a seedy neighborhood. Maureen spends a great deal of her time looking for 
Eddie, who disappears a lot. Despite being pregnant, she smokes and 
drinks while wandering around complaining about her husband and seeking a 
little company. Eddie is an alcoholic, prone towards oddly poetic 
statements and bursts of irrational behavior. Maureen and Eddie are a 
mess, not the easiest people to be around, but one thing is for sure, 
they are crazy in love with each other.  </P>
<P>Their devotion is the core of "She's So Lovely", a gritty character study 
starring Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn and John Travolta. Actor and 
independent film director John Cassavetes wrote the script 20 years ago, 
intending to star in the film along with his wife, Gena Rowlands. Shortly 
before his death in 1989, Cassavetes rewrote the screenplay for Sean Penn,
 who initially planned only to direct the film. Eventually, Cassavetes' 
son Nick became director, with Mr. And Mrs. Penn playing the lead roles. 
The film is divided into two acts. In the first, a burly neighbor (James 
Gandolfini) invites Maureen (Wright Penn) out for some friendly drinking 
and dancing. When they return to their apartment building, it becomes 
clear that his intentions are more than friendly and he assaults the 
mother-to-be. She concocts a story to tell Eddie about her bruises, 
prompting him to slur "That's all I get; fables to cover foibles". 
Eventually, Eddie goes postal during a drunken binge and ends up 
institutionalized in a mental hospital. Maureen desperately assures him 
that he'll be better in "three months or so".  The second half of the 
film takes place ten years later, as Eddie is released from the hospital, 
unaware of how much time has passed. He learns that Maureen has remarried 
and has three children, two from new husband Joey (John Travolta). His 
head still fuzzy from years of medication, Eddie sets off to fetch his 
wife.</P>
<P>"She's So Lovely" was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival, garnering a Best 
Actor award for Penn. He deserves it. Penn's acting is nothing short of 
dazzling in this film. He invests great detail into Eddie, creating a 
damaged man who is both simple-minded and remarkably complex. There are 
hints of other characters in Eddie, everyone from Joe Pesci's explosive 
thug in "Goodfellas" to Dustin Hoffman's autistic savant from "Rainman", 
but Eddie remains a unique and compelling individual. When he tells a 
friend "You can't see my obscurity", the line feels real, the kind of 
statement one might make while groping through a fog of drunkenness and 
near-psychosis. Eddie is a lost man, tethered to this earth only by his 
unwavering love for his wife Maureen.</P>
<P>Robin Wright Penn throws herself totally into the role of Maureen. Her 
New York accent goes over the top periodically, but her character is 
credible nonetheless. With dark eyes and an uneven gait, Maureen is 
compulsive and abrasive. She takes care of her daily activities in a 
perfunctory manner, with her inner demons lurking just beneath the 
surface. Maureen isn't particularly likable, but she certainly is 
fascinating. The real-life chemistry between the Penns transfers onto the 
screen smoothly, their scenes together are electric.</P>
<P>John Travolta does fine work in his supporting role as Maureen's second 
husband. Realizing there would be no screen time to establish the back-
story for his character, Travolta makes every moment count. Bursting with 
nervous energy, his Joey is a devoted husband and father who dreads 
Eddie's arrival, knowing deep inside that while Maureen is his wife, 
Eddie is her one true love. </P>
<P>"She's So Lovely" is an odd bird, a love story about people its hard to 
like. Maureen is self-destructive and very angry, Joey swears constantly 
in front of his young daughters, and Eddie is just plain nuts, but 
Cassavetes' script and the skilled cast locate the sweetness within these 
unpleasant people. Despite the horrible behavior of their parents, the 
three daughters are bright, well spoken young women. That seems 
incongruous initially, but in the end it really makes sense. Despite all 
the swearing and histrionics, Eddie, Maureen and Joey are essentially 
decent people, and decent people produce secure children. 
And despite all the grit and ugliness, "She's So Lovely" is a pure and 
simple love story. Thanks to the wonderful performances from Penn, Wright 
Penn and Travolta, it's a memorable one as well. </P>
