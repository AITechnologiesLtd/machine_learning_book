                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<P>     Hitch-hikers have always been good material for horror stories,
but this effort is classier than most.  That's not to say it is
entirely without its B-movie elements.  Story is at once simple and
complex.  Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) picks up a hitch-hiker (Rutger
Hauer) on a Texas road in the middle of nowhere.  Within the next
quarter-hour of screen time, this hitcher has pulled a knife on him,
forced him off the road, narrowly missed running him down, and almost
blown him up.  This is familiar territory for most psycho-killer
stalk-and-slash fare, and audiences usually don't give the killer's
motives a second thought.  He's a psycho, ergo he's crazy and kills
people.  Enough said.  But THE HITCHER goes beyond this convenient
movie mindset and after a while it becomes clear that Hauer is not
trying to kill Howell (though he comes awfully close) as much as scare
the hell out of him.  It's almost as if he is a psycho 'playing the
part' of a movie psycho, and Howell is his audience.  In the creepy
opening sequence, in which Hauer evades all of Howell's questions, we
are given only one indication of the stranger's intent.  "Stop me,"  he
tells Howell.  From that point on Howell is plunged into a waking
nightmare, realizing that the hitcher is on a killing rampage,  and one
that he has unwillingly become a part of.</P>
<P>     It's the hitcher's motives that provide the puzzle in this film.
One possible explanation for his behavior is that he has totally
divorced himself from his conscience, and by externalizing it in the
form of Howell (who he may suspect is too weak to stop him), has passed
on all responsibilities for his actions so that he can commit his
violent acts with abandon.  As he realizes that Howell is too soft a
touch, he toughens up his campaign.  Which turns out to be bad news for
anyone Howell comes into contact with.  But a more intriguing idea
behind Hauer's motives is that he is a latter-day Flying Dutchman,
doomed to wander the hellish desert roads from one end to the other.
When investigated by the police he is found to have no past record,
driver's license, or any means of identification whatsoever.  He has
seemingly come from nowhere.  The name he gives Howell upon their first
meeting is the obviously pseudonymous "John Ryder".  Has he found a way
to end his curse--or worse, pass it on--by goading Howell to end his
life?  (When he places coins on Howell's eyes, he is suggesting that he
is damned).  Significantly, during their final confrontation, Hauer
drops a chain to the ground and smiles: he is free at last.</P>
<P>     The film has moments that are alternately nail-biting and exciting.
Top-notch cinematographer John Seale makes this one worth seeing on a
long screen, if only for the wonderfully-framed shot of two police cars
spinning end over end along the road.  Focused script and direction by
Eric Red and Robert Harmon respectively.  And Hauer makes a great
villain--we can't really hate him even though the things he does are
horrifying.  Also with:  Jennifer Jason Leigh (who'd already been at
odds with the villainous Hauer the previous year in FLESH + BLOOD).</P>
