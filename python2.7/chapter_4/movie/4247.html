<P>     It's hard to believe that THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT was made by the
same man responsible for the no-holds-barred satire of THIS IS SPINAL
TAP.  Is there any element of American culture more ripe for the
humorist's razor-sharp wit than presidential politics?  Yet, heedless of
what it might have been, this film is content to hunker down in the
valley of feel-good entertainment, sacrificing intelligent plotting for
mass appeal.  While neither bad nor unwatchable, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
is nevertheless the second straight disappointment from director Rob
Reiner (his previous effort being NORTH).</P>
<P>     Attempting to mix behind-the-scenes Washington machinations,
political rhetoric, and a love story, Aaron Sorkin's script ends up
shortchanging all of its elements.  It comes across as painfully
politically correct, offering trite sermons on various "hot-button"
issues (gun control and the greenhouse effect).  The narrative follows
an unwavering by-the-numbers strategy with an ending that echoes the
"cornball" of Al Pacino's climactic SCENT OF A WOMAN speech.</P>
<P>     The setting is contemporary Washington DC.  It's an election year,
and the incumbent Democratic President, Andrew Shepherd (Michael
Douglas), is counting on his much-ballyhooed crime bill to cinch the
result of the upcoming political struggle.  His approval rating is
already astronomically high (63%), and his "family values" opponent,
Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss), is floundering.
He can't bring up the so-called "character issue", because Shepherd is a
widower with a young daughter, and political experts say that personal
attacks will have a disastrous backlash.  So Rumson bides his time,
waiting for the President to make a mistake.  Which, of course, he does.</P>
<P>     That mistake comes in the person of Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette
Bening), who represents the Global Defense Council.  Not only does she
attract Shepherd's support for a pro-environment bill, but she catches
his eye as well.  He asks her to accompany him to an official State
dinner, and the next morning all the papers are calling her the
"President's girlfriend".  What follows is a variation on the tried-but-
true story of boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get girl back
again.  The only real difference here is that the romance takes place in
and around the White House.</P>
<P>     Sorkin, who wrote A FEW GOOD MEN (which Reiner also directed), has
sprinkled the screenplay with understated humor and sparkling dialogue,
but the clever lines and amusing vignettes can't fully overcome the
plot's essential mediocrity.  The set design is very good--attention
to detail is such that it's easy to accept that all the action takes
place within the most securely-guarded residence in the United States.</P>
<P>     The cast is solid, with Michael Douglas doing a credible job as the
Commander-in-Chief, Annette Bening being alternately winsome and tough,
and Martin Sheen offering hard advice as the Chief of Staff.  Michael J.
Fox does a believable George Stephanopoulos-type and Shawna Waldron is
appealing as the President's daughter.  Only Richard Dreyfuss, whose
one-note bad guy grates, doesn't do much with his character.</P>
<P>     THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT wants to be a fantasy--Shepherd is far too
good to be true--yet it keeps trying to ground itself in a
"Clintonesque" faux reality, creating a noticeable conflict in tone.
And, unlike DAVE, this film doesn't offer anything really biting.  Sure,
it's likable (which DAVE was, as well), but it's also bland.  All things
considered, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is probably going to find it
difficult campaigning against the likes of GOLDENEYE and CASINO.</P>
