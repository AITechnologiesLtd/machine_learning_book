<PRE>POLLOCK
-------</PRE>
<P>When actor Ed Harris' ("The Truman Show") father saw the book 'Jackson Pollock:
An American Saga,' he initially thought he was looking at his son on the cover.
The father-to-son gift inspired the actor to make his directorial debut while
also starring in "Pollock."</P>
<P>As adapted from Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith's book by Barbara Turner
and Susan Emshwiller, Jackson Pollock is portrayed as a simple man, an unknown
artist and alcoholic leaching off his family in New York City until fellow 
painter and future wife Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden, "Space Cowboys") took 
on the burden of selfless caretaker and nurturer.  Krasner put her own career
on hold to promote Pollock's because she believed in his genius.  She had the
connections he did not and was able to first get the attention of Howard Putzel
(Bud Cort, in an endearing performance) who led to the all important
sponsorship of Peggy Guggenheim (Harris' wife Amy Madigan, almost
unrecognizable).  Krasner also got Pollock away from the bottle and the city,
moving out to an old Long Island farmhouse where Pollock stumbled upon the
splatter technique which would become his defining style.  </P>
<P>As his fame rose and his ego swelled, Pollock drew the city to him and alcohol 
regained its grip.  He became abusive to the woman who saved him and began
openly having affairs until Krasner left for Europe.  Pollock's last affair
with the much younger Ruth Klingman (Jennifer Connelly) ended in tragedy when 
he lost control of his car, killing himself and Ruth's friend Edith Metzger 
(Sally Murphy, "Fearless").  Klingman survived the crash.</P>
<P>While Ed Harris captures the all the surfaces of Jackson Pollock, his subject
remains an enigma.  Pollock speaks simplistically ('You're a damn good woman
painter,' he tells Krasner on his first visit to her loft) or not at all.  His
eyes portray hurt and bewilderment when coming out of one of his drunken 
stupors, yet we never understand what drives him to paint nor what it is he's
expressing in his art.  (When Krasner first sees his initial splatter painting
and proclaims 'You've done it Pollock.  You've cracked it wide open.'  My 
reaction was 'huh?')  Pollock the man appears to get more pleasure out of
rubbing his extended family's noses in his fame than in the act of creation
itself.  His emotional connections to the women in his life, including his
mother Stella (Sada Thompson), are not explored.</P>
<P>Marcia Gay Harden's Krasner, on the other hand, is a complex picture of a
woman whose strong beliefs drive her to action.  Harden makes us understand
why this woman stood beside this difficult man for so long.  When she finally
breaks after Pollock throws a drunken Thanksgiving dinner tantrum, our 
sympathy is with her.  She's a muse grounded in hard-nosed reality.</P>
<P>Support is hit and miss with the aforementioned Cort ("Harold and Maude")
appearing all too briefly and Madison's Guggenheim coming off as a bit of a
circus freak.  Jeffrey Tambor is Clement Greenberg, Pollock's personal critic.
Val Kilmer is too attention-drawing an actor to disappear into the small
role of Willem de Kooning.  Jennifer Connelly, so affecting in "Requiem for
a Dream," is relegated to window dressing here.</P>
<P>Harris as director tells his story in what sometimes comes across as
disconnected snippets, although they're artfully framed snippets.  He does
capture the physical energy, if not the inspiration, that went into Pollock's 
painting.  Bright, colorful cinematography by Lisa Rinzler ("Three Seasons")
is particularly effective in the country locations.</P>
<P>When asked to comment on his art, Jackson Pollock tells a Life reporter 'It's 
like looking at a bed of flowers.  You don't tear your hair out over what it
means.'  That could be said of Ed Harris' portrait of Pollock as well.</P>
