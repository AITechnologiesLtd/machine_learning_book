<P>     THE JUROR starts in a courtroom in the United States and finishes 
with a chase through a ruined temple in Guatemala.  If you can imagine a 
screenplay that cobbles together elements of TRIAL BY JURY, THE PELICAN 
BRIEF, and CONGO, you have a fairly good idea what to expect from this 
movie.  As soon as you think THE JUROR can't get any more silly, it will 
inevitably prove you wrong.  </P>
<P>     This is yet another in a *long* line of inane thrillers to pit 
"ordinary" people against amazingly-intelligent, incredibly-nasty, 
often-psychotic adversaries.  Add THE JUROR to an already overpopulated 
category that includes THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY, 
PACIFIC HEIGHTS, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, THE TIE THAT BINDS, and EYE FOR AN 
EYE.  There are three prerequisites this kind of film:  the basic 
storyline must have little or no basis in reality, the main character(s) 
must be unreasonably virtuous, and the villain must be evil incarnate.  
THE JUROR follows each of these precepts to the letter.</P>
<P>     Get ready for Demi Moore in yet another high-profile, artistically 
barren motion picture.  Unlike DISCLOSURE, however, which was actually 
enjoyable, THE JUROR is a trial to sit through.  The movie would like 
viewers to believe it has something relevant to say about the ease with 
which our legal system can be abused, but, in the end, all the posturing 
about the need for a "reasonable doubt" in criminal cases becomes just 
another lame plot element.  THE JUROR never comes close to making a 
serious statements about crime or justice.  Director Brian Gibson wants 
thrills and shocks, not potentially thought-provoking questions.</P>
<P>     Annie Laird (Moore) is a hard-working single mom who spends all of 
her spare time caring for her pre-teen son, Oliver (Joseph Gordon-
Levitt).  She's so ignorant of current events that she becomes an ideal 
candidate for a juror in the high-profile trial of reputed mob boss 
Louie Buffano (Tony Lo Bianco).  At first, she's excited to be selected, 
but it doesn't take long for the thrill to turn to terror.  The evidence 
against Louie, which includes a tape recorded conversation, is 
overwhelming, but the mob isn't worried.  Their best man, the Teacher 
(Alec Baldwin), is on the job.  He singles out Annie as his target and 
makes her an offer she can't refuse:  vote "not guilty" or both she and 
her son will suffer the consequences.</P>
<P>     If this plot sounds familiar, that's because it's a retread of 
1994's TRIAL BY JURY, another horrible courtroom thriller about jury 
tampering.  To differentiate this movie from the earlier one, THE JUROR 
(based on the best-selling novel by George Dawes Green) has expanded 
beyond the trial, resulting in an increasingly-ridiculous series of plot 
twists that climax in a crumbling temple deep in the heart of a 
Guatemalan jungle.  It's like a bad John Grisham plot -- lots of danger 
and running around, little of which ultimately means anything.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of 
formula motion picture.  Demi Moore is the lone exception -- it's rare 
that she's believable for more than part of a scene.  Alec Baldwin, on 
the other hand, gives a nicely controlled performance as the obsessive 
man who wants to control not only Annie's vote on the jury, but 
everything about her life.  Supporting players Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 
Anne Heche, and James Gandolfini all do solid, if unspectacular, jobs.</P>
<P>     However, no number of competent performances can save THE JUROR.  
The painfully obvious storyline is what sinks this movie, and even the 
most accomplished cast couldn't have done much more with the material.  
This motion picture is guilty of wasting the time of anyone who wants 
even a modicum of intelligence in their entertainment.</P>
