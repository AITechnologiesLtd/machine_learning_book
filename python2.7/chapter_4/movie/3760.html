<PRE>                               THE SUM OF US
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: David Stevens's stage play is adapted
          for the screen.  A father and his gay son live
          alone together in a middle-class neighborhood in
          Sydney, each looking for a mate.  The minimal story
          moves slowly, but the character development and the
          unusual father-son relationship make this a
          watchable and well-constructed film.  Rating: +1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     David Stevens is probably most notable in this country for co-
authoring BREAKER MORANT together with Bruce Beresford and Jonathan
Hardy.  That was a very political film.  His SUM OF US, based on his
own stage play, is a very different sort of story.  At the center of
this story are Harry Mitchell and his son Jeff (Jack Thompson of the
excellent TURTLE BEACH and Russell Crowe of ROMPER STOMPER).  We see
them doing some very normal things like having dinner together.  Jeff,
as we quickly learn, is gay.  Harry accepts his son's sexual
orientation with a sort of stoicism.  Most of the time he presents a
face of complete toleration, but find him in the right mood and he will
admit that he wishes his son would know the joy of "planting his seed
and seeing it grow," as he puts it.  And if you catch Harry drunk and
with his defenses down, you can tell that his natural instincts are
anti-gay.  Still, he is a man of wit and intelligence who greatly loves
his son and who, while in control, will make every effort to be
supportive.  Harry's determination to be not just tolerant but chummy
with Jeff's boyfriend Greg (John Polson) ironically is more of a
hindrance than a help in that relationship.  But if Harry is disrupting
Jeff's relationship, Jeff's being gay may impact Harry's romance with
an attractive divorcee he has met through a dating service.</P>
<P>     Jack Thompson is a familiar face in Australian cinema and has been
in such films as MAD DOG MORGAN, BREAKER MORANT, and THE EARTHLING.
Here he gives a likable and nicely understated performance.  This
really is his film and even in moments of minimalist repartee with his
son, a natural charm and wit shine through.  Crowe is fully credible as
the son but somehow is not able to command the same audience empathy
that Thompson does.</P>
<P>     Stevens creates a real study in the degrees of tolerance among the
families shown in this film.  In Jeff's family the dominant emotion is
love; in Greg's it is anger.  Greg's father seems to have little use
for his son, not even knowing that his son is gay.  The one really
unconventional touch in the style of this film is to have Harry and
Jeff talk directly to the camera frequently.  This technique is often
used in films, but rarely to this degree.  Curiously, this is not at
all bothersome when it is first used, but toward the end of the film
there are cases where it is awkwardly inappropriate.</P>
<P>     This is a film with some comedy and some sadness that warmly
explores an unusual father-son relationship.  There are no thrills and
no special effects, just a simple story.  I wish this country would
make more of this sort of film.  It gets a laid-back +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
