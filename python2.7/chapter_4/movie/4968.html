<PRE>                               BETSY'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        One of my colleagues was surprised when I told her I was willing to
see BETSY'S WEDDING.  And she was shocked to hear that I actually liked it.
Her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves
around Molly Ringwald, who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986.  But
the fact is, BETSY'S WEDDING is also an Alan Alda film.  And while Ringwald
has been making duds for the last four years, Alda has been involved with
several noteworthy projects, including CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and A NEW
LIFE.</P>
<P>        Written and directed by Alda, BETSY'S WEDDING is a vibrant
slice-of-life, mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical
humor.  Alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change
of pace from the usual summer fare.</P>
<P>        As bride and groom, Molly Ringwald and Dylan Walsh are the pivotal
characters in the film, but they are by far the least interesting.  Walsh
is a nonentity, with all the screen presence of a door knob.  Ringwald is
simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain.  She looks
hideous with her short-cropped orange hair, red lip-stick and grotesque
outfits.  She's supposed to be a dress designer, but she looks more like a
clown.  And to make matters worse, Ringwald's performance matches her
appearance.</P>
<P>        Thankfully, Alda keeps Ringwald's screen time to a minimum; he is
far more interested in the colorful periphery characters.  The wedding is
just a device to bring together the bride's working-class, Italian family
and the groom's rich, gentile family.  Ringwald's folks are homey and
down-to-earth, with Alda as her free-spirited father, Madeline Kahn as her
practical mother, and Ally Sheedy as her lonely sister.  Walsh's clan, on
the other hand, is prim, proper and ostentatious.  When the two families
meet and mingle, the movie becomes a story of culture clash, or as one
character puts it, "money versus values."</P>
<P>        Ally Sheedy, in a wonderfully understated performance, is one of
the film's most pleasant surprises.  Sheedy expresses more with just her
eyes than Ringwald does with her entire body.  It's Anthony LaPaglia,
however, who seizes the spotlight.  LaPaglia plays Stevie Dee, a suave,
overly polite mafioso who is formally courting Sheedy with old-fashioned
chivalry.  LaPaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot.  And
what's uncanny is that LaPaglia is a dead ringer for Robert De Niro, with a
little bit of Alec Baldwin thrown in for good measure.  LaPaglia seems to
have attended the De Niro school of gangster acting, and his inspired
performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off.  I
don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born, but I do
know that LaPaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed.</P>
<P>        The scrumptious comic acting, however, extends well beyond Sheedy
and LaPaglia.  Joe Pesci, in particular, sinks his teeth into his role as
Alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law, a slum lord with mob ties, who is
cheating on his wife (Catherine O'Hara).  Alda, faced with challenge of
both directing and acting, somehow finds just the right comic touch as the
bride's financially-strapped father, a carpenter whose dreams are bigger
than his wallet.  The film adopts Alda's psychological point of view as he
tries to one: plan the wedding, and two: pay for it.</P>
<P>        As a filmmaker, Alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and
tasteful.  And while he doesn't have the comic genius of a Woody Allen,
Alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more
entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy.</P>
