<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>There is so little known about the life of composer SAINTE COLOMBE, that it
took a novel to get some attention.  And a director who loves music, because
if you didn't, this film might not have been worth it.</P>
<P>This is not the CLIFF NOTES of music appreciation.  This is the real
thing....... and it is done so carefully, and meticulously, that one is
probably going to go out and buy a lot of this music.............
Sainte Colombe, became a historical composer, and creative musician because
he disdained the music business more than for his own music, although it is
intensely private, and extremely beautiful.</P>
<P>He was more famous for having created a scandal when he refused the favors
of the courts of Louis XIV in France.  He was less interested in the
popular, or court attentions, than he was in being lost in his own grief,
for a wife he truly loved, and if it is an indication, the first person that
showed to him that his music not only made sense, but was good.  However,
Sainte Colombe's prowess with the instrument
he devised ( the precursor to today's cello -- he added a 7th string to the
viola to add more lower notes ) was clear, and the desire of many who hoped
to get him as a teacher.  Most were refused, and it
is possible than none actually got any teaching.  But Marin Marais has in
his memoirs some moments to tell, and the film's writer devised a novel
about the tragic life of a man, who was truly lost
in his own creation.</P>
<P>Opening with an extreme close up of the sad Marais, in grief, for he too has
been bit by his inability to deal with the guilt he has for having left
Sainte Colombe's daughter, who went on to hang herself,
the elder Marais tells his story to an audience of young musicians that are
trying to rehearse, but have no touch, no feel for any music.   And the film
ends with the elder Sainte Colombe entering
and saying the final line of the film.  " I am proud to have taught a
student like you " ... A submission, that he has finally seen what he has
felt and preached to himself all his life.  The music has
won out.  And the feelings have been elevated to a new high.</P>
<P>With a superb cast, both Depardieus ( father and son ), J-P Marielle as
Sainte Colombe, and Anne Brochet and Carole Richert as the daughters of the
composer, just smooth their way through the whole
film, which appears long, but isn't..... but pleas that you listen and live
the feelings of the music... which is not something Hollywood likes to
do..... they would have cut half hour out of this  film........</P>
<PRE>SUPERB FILM
MUSIC IS GREAT
SLOW....IF YOU LIKE IT FAST.
DEEP FEELINGS...INTENSE.</PRE>
<PRE>5 GIBLOONS of 5</PRE>
