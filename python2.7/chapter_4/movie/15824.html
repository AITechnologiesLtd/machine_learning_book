<P>Lisa Cholodenko's "High Art," is an intelligent, quiet drama. Its 
strongest quality, aside from the top-notch central performances, is the 
perceptive way in which the film, also written by Cholodenko, observes 
its characters. They are all flawed people, some more troubled than 
others, but they are not judged. Judging the characters in this picture 
would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts, because no one, no 
matter how bad off they are, deserve to be negatively judged if they are 
involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of.</P>
<P>Syd (Radha Mitchell), a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime 
boyfriend James (Gabriel Mann), has recently been awarded an ideal job 
at the high-profile photography magazine, "Frame." She very much enjoys 
where her career is headed, but is often not taken very seriously by her 
managers, who are always giving her petty jobs to do, when she knows she 
could be doing more important things. One night, while taking a bath, 
Syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers, so when she 
goes up there to inform them of it, she meets Lucy Beliner (Ally 
Sheedy), a thin, worn-out, and unhappy woman, who lives with her 
drug-addicted German girlfriend, Greta (Patricia Clarkson), a pathetic 
former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out 
of conciousness. Syd quickly strikes up a conversation with Lucy, and 
discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years 
before. Lucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession, 
but Syd manages to convince the "Frame" editors to do a piece on her 
work. All the while, Syd begins to grow deep feelings for Lucy, even 
though she has never previously been attracted to a woman, and Lucy 
starts a battle with her personal demons.</P>
<P>"High Art," is such an effective motion picture because it is never 
suger-coated or idealized, but instead an honest and convincing portrait 
of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere, while 
Syd's luck begins to rise. The film in no way is about lesbianism, but 
about love, which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual 
stereotypical portraits of homosexuality. As Lucy and Syd grow closer 
and closer together, we really do believe that they are falling in love 
with each other, even if the relationship might be doomed. </P>
<P>With this picture, Ally Sheedy's star has risen once again, thanks to 
her touching, nearly flawless portrtayal of Lucy, a woman who, in the 
course of a decade, has found her life consumed almost entirely by 
drugs, which has taken away her once-blossoming career. Her characted 
really is tragic, and one particular scene involving Lucy and her 
mother, in which Lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem, and her 
mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her, is 
heartbreaking. Although not autobiographical, Sheedy has had drug 
problems in her past, and I suspect she brought that knowledge of 
already being in Lucy's footsteps to her role. Also very good is Radha 
Mitchell as Syd, who previously starred in the slight 1997 Australian 
comedy, "Love and Other Catastrophes," wh caught me by surprise with her 
performance. Easily being able to pass as Christina Ricci's older 
sister, Mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made Ricci 
so popular recently.</P>
<P>As accurate as almost every detail is in, "High Art," I wish the 
relationship had been more tightly written involving Syd and James, who, 
played by Gabriel Mann, is left with a throwaway role. By the time he 
finds out about Syd and Lucy, he disappears from the film, and I wish 
there had been another scene where they confronted each other.
This is a very minor fault, however, in a film that is full of riches. 
Although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair, 
Syd and Lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems. The 
character of Dominique (Anh Duong), the "Frame" editor who decides to 
give Syd a chance with her ideas, was also written to be far more mature 
than expected. And the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and 
originally done. For once, it did not invlove steaminess, or violent 
sexual activity, or gratuitous nudity, but focused on the actual 
characters, who love each other, and their insecurities involved in 
making the decision to actually have sex. "High Art," which won the 
screenwriting award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, marks the 
superior feature film debut of Cholodenko, as well as Sheedy's 
strongest, and best, role to date.</P>
