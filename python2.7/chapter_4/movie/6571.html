<PRE>                               THE CRUCIBLE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE CRUCIBLE is Arthur Miller's
          allegory of the politics of the 1950s Red Scare
          told with a setting of the Salem witch trials.
          This 45-year-old play is as powerful a drama as you
          will see on the screen this year.  While a little
          hampered by the 17th century prose, it remains a
          moving theatrical experience. Rating: +3 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: positive: 20, negative: 1, mixed:

<P>     THE CRUCIBLE is the story of the Salem witch trials, but it is a
lot more than that.  It is an examination of a society that through
fear gives unquestioned authority and power to a select few supposed
defenders.  The result is an exercise in power far worse than the
threat it was intended to curb.  The House Un-American Activities
Committee hearings, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy were the
inspiration for Arthur Miller's original play, but the parallels he
draws can be applied to any situation where the public allows itself to
be ruled by fear rather than reason.  It is a ready-made and fully-
formed analogy that some can apply to the "political correctness"
argument, others to the firearms debate or political issues with
religious implications. The term "witch hunt" has come into common
usage as any campaign against dissension, perhaps in large part because
of this play.</P>
<P>     The setting is Salem, Massachusetts in 1692.  This is a community
committed to an extreme devotion to its religion and what it sees as
service to God.  And if the Bible says that such things as witches
exist, then witchcraft must be a very real and very present threat to
the community.  Several adolescent girls, led by Abigail Williams
(played by Winona Ryder), are caught in the act playing the voodoo-like
game of "conjuring boys."  Williams has taken things a step further and
has tried to use the magic to kill a woman she considers her enemy.  At
first she denies that the game had anything to do with witchcraft, but
quickly discovers that she has happened onto what seems to her a good
thing.  The first suggestion that any of the people of Salem have
engaged in witchcraft seems to bring down the wrath of the whole
community.  And the people of Salem, many already involved in minor
conflicts with their neighbors, seem all too ready to accept and
exploit witchcraft accusations against their enemies.  Soon there area
dozen or so girls making accusations and basking in the celebrity their
accusations bring them.</P>
<P>     Drawn into the situation are John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and
his wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen).  John had had a short dalliance with
Abigail, but now wants to remain faithful to Elizabeth.  It is a
situation that Abigail, with her new-found power, discovers she can
change.  To investigate the accusations come first the Reverend Hale
(Rob Campbell) and then the esteemed Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield),
Deputy Governor of Massachusetts.  Hale is a moderate man as likely to
find an accused witch innocent as guilty.  Judge Danforth, on the other
hand, is a religious zealot who couches his actions in legalisms.  At
heart, however, he is deeply afraid of witchcraft himself and can no
longer accept any possibility of innocence.  He sees the girls'
accusations as God giving him the tools to root out the Devil in Salem.
Eventually the witch hunt will take on a life of its own and will get
beyond even his control.  Caught in all of this is John Proctor who
still has some affection for Abigail but sees first hand the evil that
Abigail is wielding.</P>
<P>     Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder each seem acceptable by
themselves, but somehow do not seems to have much dramatic chemistry
together on the screen.  Day-Lewis is made up with considerably more
realism than is Ryder.  He, like many of the people of the story, show
the sign of a hard life with scars and with rotted teeth.  Even making
allowances for Ryder's youth, a similar hard life seems to have done
little more than ruffle her hair.  Ryder appears out of place and too
well cared-for considering the look of most of the other people in the
film.  Joan Allen, who previously played Pat Nixon in NIXON gives a
subtle uprightness to the role of Elizabeth Proctor.  Paul Scofield
playing another judge will surely bring memories of A MAN FOR ALL
SEASONS.  He brings a lot of the same magnetism to this role as he had
in that, perhaps presenting another side of the same character.
Familiar faces in less pivotal roles include Bruce Davison, Jeffrey
Jones, and George Gaynes.</P>
<P>     In some senses this production is a little too polished to feel
accurate.  The opening sequence shows a voodoo-like ceremony in the
woods complete with mystic chalk symbols drawn on ground, and Tituba
chanting a perfectly recorded version of the Yanvalou Chant.  It was
very theatrical but not very realistic. Some may find the film a little
hard to follow, particularly in the first half hour.  The viewer is
introduced to a large number of characters speaking in the manner of
17th Century English.  A word should be said about the accuracy of this
film to the historical fact.  It is not much beyond the names of some
of the people. Abigail Williams was an eleven-year-old and John Proctor
was sixty, so much of the Miller's tale of sexual revenge does not work
as history.  However I am willing to give Arthur Miller more latitude
to play with the facts in this film than I give Gibson for BRAVEHEART.
Robert Bolt in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS or William Shakespeare with JULIUS
CAESAR is doing a lot more than just telling an adventure tale.  Miller
is a writer who can tell a story of complexity with some profundity.
If THE CRUCIBLE is not historically accurate, it transcends that.  I
personally hold BRAVEHEART more accountable for historical accuracy
than I do THE CRUCIBLE.</P>
<P>     THE CRUCIBLE is a powerful play on stage, but it has been made
available to mass audiences only twice before, once as the 1957 French
film LES SORCIERES DE SALEM and then again in 1967 as a play performed
on CBS.  With the exception of the latter, no non-live version has ever
been available to American audience until now.  It is something of a
service that it is available now.  I give it a +3 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
