<PRE>                           AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS                           
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The locale is the countryside outside Paris in a Catholic boarding
school for young boys.  The time is that period in World War II when
France was occupied by the German army.   To the school where a priest
is the principal are sent three Jewish boys where they can be hidden
from the Gestapo.   Teachers and principal are in the Resistance and
risk their lives by keeping the Jewish children in their school.</P>
<P>Louis Malle directed this semi-autobiographical look at the school, the
students, the staff, the nuns, the German soldiers, and the Gestapo.
This film is right up there with the best films ever made.</P>
<P>The last lines of the movie as the final screen credits appear is a
real clincher.</P>
<P>French with English subtitles.  An award-winning film. </P>
