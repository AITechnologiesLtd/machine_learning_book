<P>        "Rounders" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see.
It's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence, but because it's a film
that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling. And to take make
things "worse" it proves this through its original, fascinating story.</P>
<P>        There have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the
"noir" mood, that is, the dark, shady atmosphere where the vices of the world
become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life. This film
starts off in the tradiational noir style, introducing us to the underworld of
modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing. Matt
Damon stars as Mike McDermott, a 20-something law student in present-day New
York City who tells us how the game of poker is REALLY played. Damon narrates
throughout the film, but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly
to completely and totally define the setting.</P>
<P>        Mike's about to go up against Teddy KGB (Malkovich), a Russian gangster who
looks like a serial killer. But then again, he practically is one and the film
does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes, his slow
movements, his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir
cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld
(literally). Damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his
expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features, but his narration is what
brings it all together. He never sounds like he's reading from a script, nor
that he's trying to embellish anything, it just comes natural to him. The
screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood, from the
smell of the air, to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and
cards, and all without sounding remotely trite. </P>
<P>        Immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers, but for near-
geniuses with nerves of steel. The game is a quiet war, with strategies just
as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers. The gangsters Mike
plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their
car, but when it comes to the game of poker, all respect is due to the winner
because he is truly the better man.</P>
<P>        The film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the
first act. It concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the
progression of the story stumble a bit. We learn only a little about Mike,
both past and present. Presently we know he has a girlfriend named Jo
(Gretchen Mol) who he constantly argues with over his gambling. They go
through a few break-up/make-up cycles until Mike's childhood pal and fellow
rounder "Worm" (Norton) is released from prison.</P>
<P>        It's not at all surprising Worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob, but what
is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and
execute it the way it does. Technically, the plot isn't unlike many children's
sitcoms in which the "good" kid's "bad" friend gets the good kid in trouble
and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid. What this film does is
use a different medium to tell that story. Mike and Worm have been in over
their heads their entire lives, but both share a passion for out-thinking the
other player who is trying to do the same to them. Where as Worm prefers to go
the sleazy route of cheating (hence his jail time), Mike always takes the
cards he's dealt and works with them. Sometimes they pay off (i.e. his ability
to pay his way through law school on his gambling money), but other times they
don't (i.e. the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job
after dropping $30,000 on a single hand).</P>
<P>        Once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot
into an intricate web of detail and mood. Mike and Worm bob and weave through
all kinds of games at all kinds of places, from socialites' mansions, to
taking the tourists at Atlantic City, to outwitting the gangsters that control
it all. </P>
<P>        Everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that
everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals. One scene demonstrates
this perfectly in which Mike is told by a judge (Martin Landou, in a perfectly
cast and performed role) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the
same time. Matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great
lawyer. He could go professional as either, but with one he could lose
everything or win big, but with the other there's stability but not much risk
involved. Can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips
and leave?</P>
<P>        If the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing, then the ending
is our test. Everything is told from Mike's perspective, but we're finally
able to recognize some things on our own. This makes the final, against-all-
odds showdown seem like just that. It works just like the game it revolves
around - showing us some of the cards, but still evokes the element of the
unknown, and the consequences thereof.</P>
<P>        What separates "Rounders" from most other films about games is the fact the
challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end.</P>
