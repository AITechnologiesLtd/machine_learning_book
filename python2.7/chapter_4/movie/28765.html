<PRE>THE CROW: SALVATION
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Nothing like low expectations to enhance your movie-going pleasure.  
Invited to a special theatrical screening of Bharat Nalluri's THE CROW: 
SALVATION, recently released on tape and DVD, I wasn't particularly 
looking forward to it.  Having avoided previous movies based on James 
O'Barr's "Crow" comic book series, I was pleasantly surprised with THE 
CROW: SALVATION.  Although I wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend 
it, the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing, albeit 
overly dramatic, acting.  The script is so over the top that it would 
probably work better for an animated movie than a live-action 
production.  Think of the film as a cross between DARK CITY and a 
Charles Bronson revenge thriller.</P>
<P>Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius) is a quiet hero who slaughters the bad guys in 
the most dramatic and painfully violent ways possible.  As the story 
opens, he is about to be executed for allegedly killing his girlfriend.  
After being electrocuted, but before completely dying, he goes forth 
into the world in order to seek vengeance.  A zombie, neither dead nor 
alive, he proceeds to murder the dozen or so people involved in setting 
him up.  A crow accompanies him on his journey among the living.  Also 
along for the ride is Kirsten Dunst as the sister of Alex's girlfriend.  
Although Mabius gets maximum mileage out of his quiet intensity, Dunst 
has trouble figuring out her character's purpose in the story.  So far 
over the top that his performance is a real hoot, Fred Ward plays a 
corrupt police captain with a badge the size of a large pancake.</P>
<P>Shot impressively by Carolyn Chen, the movie has a striking look of dark 
blues shrouded in fog.  The red of the ever-present blood serves as the 
main contrast to the film's bluish tint.  If you rent the movie and you 
find the story a bit too ludicrous, you can always enjoy the visuals.</P>
<P>THE CROW: SALVATION runs 1:42.  It is rated R for pervasive strong 
violence and for sexual content and language.  It would be acceptable 
for older teenagers.</P>
