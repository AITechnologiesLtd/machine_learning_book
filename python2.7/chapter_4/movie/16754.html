<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
One star</P>
<P>Many years ago people believed that witchcraft was not something to poke
fun at; witches symbolized evil in its most satanic and scariest form.
But nowadays, witches are funky and cool.  Compare the witchcraft in
Macbeth or The Crucible to that of Bewitched or Sabrina: The Teenage
Witch, and you'll notice an astonishing difference.  Vile old women have
now been replaced by the likes of Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock, and
the only thing scary about them is their choice of films.  Attractive
young women may give their characters energy and liveliness, but
witchery has lost its meaning and relevance in cinema.  In the case of
Practical Magic, it doesn't represent evil; it represents very bad
filmmaking.</P>
<P>For centuries, the Owens family of witches has suffered from a
disturbing curse: any man they fall in love with soon ends up dead.
Sisters Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) deal with
this problem in different ways.  Sally chooses to ignore her family's
past and marries a man she is deeply in love with, whilst Gillian
pursues a life of loveless affairs.  Things get a little tricky when the
sisters kill Gillian's boyfriend, in self-defense.  They attempt to
cover up the murder, whilst likeable cop Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn)
investigates who done it.</P>
<P>Any chance to pace Practical Magic in a sensible way has been
conveniently ignored.  The story moves from romance, to sanitized
horror, to a murder mystery, then back to romance, then back to
sanitized horror, and then to something even more ridiculous (let's just
say a group of ordinary women become part of an absurd ritual, and leave
it at that).  The three screenwriters who adapted the film from the
novel by Alice Hoffman have shown no talent for unraveling any hint of a
coherent story.  Practical Magic is never evenly faintly believable, and
only occasionally enjoyable.  Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman give a
sexy and fun feeling to their roles, but their performances are
simplistic and one-dimensional.</P>
<P>The film never succeeds in finding stable ground, but comes reasonably
close to it when Aidan Quinn arrives on the screen.  Quinn's previous
film was The Assignment, in which he boldly portrayed two different
characters, and was brilliant throughout.  Here, he looks out of place
and ignorant of the idiocy surrounding him, but at least provides the
reason why Practical Magic is (sometimes) tolerable.</P>
<P>Few films insult my intelligence and ever fewer inspire me to walk out
early, but Practical Magic did both those things.  Director Griffin
Dunne seems to have no idea of how to make a solid, respectable product,
largely because of the film's clumsy screenplay.  Condescending,
embarrassing and immature, Practical Magic is practically pathetic.</P>
