<P>Turning "Going All The Way" into a movie wasn't easy. So much of Dan 
Wakefield's classic novel takes place in the thoughts of one sad, 
repressed and desperately horny young man. How do you take such an 
interior story and transfer its essence to the big screen? Quite well, 
thankfully. 
With some PBS documentaries and the award winning video of Pearl Jam's 
"Jeremy" giving them a little clout, producer Tom Gorai and director Mark 
Pellington convinced Wakefield to write the screenplay for his story, 
then secured funds to film it in Indianapolis, where the novel is set. 
Pellington is an ardent fan of "Going All The Way", having read the book 
at least 25 times, and knows the lead characters inside and out. His 
vision and Wakefield's dialogue merge to create a remarkably faithful 
adaptation of the story of two young soldiers returning to Indianapolis 
in 1954. While train-bound home, Sonny Burns, an introvert who has spent 
most of his brief life trying to blend into the nearest wall, is 
mortified when another soldier, Gunner Casselman, strikes up a 
conversation. Sonny remembers Gunner as one of the "big rods" from high 
school, a handsome, assured athlete and cocksman, a member of a social 
caste Sonny envied and feared. Gunner's experiences overseas have changed 
him, however. He now views his glory days in high school as the stuff of 
childhood and longs to find the deeper meanings of life. He admires Sonny 
for "not buying into all that jock bullshit" and Sonny, feeling like a 
total fraud but grateful for the friendship, bonds with him. Much to the 
confusion and dismay of their respective parents, the two set off on a 
quest for substance, only to find their penises acting like divining rods,
 drawing them towards the nearest beautiful woman.
In his 1970 novel, which sold over a million copies, Wakefield made what 
could have been a stock coming-of-age story fresh with his stunningly 
honest look at the details of spiritual, social  and sexual desperation, 
balanced with many sardonically funny moments. Pellington conveys those 
feelings with striking visual style, using bold colors and contemporary 
editing techniques to allow us to see the world through Sonny's eyes. 
When the young man gets drunk at a dance, Pellington's edgy camera 
captures Sonny's perceived urbane finesse, including an absurd, brilliant 
dance scene you will never forget. When a sexual liaison turns into a 
disaster, Pellington employs a black and white palette and stark lighting 
to show Sonny's nightmarish race away from the scene of his humiliation. 
Again and again, Pellington comes up with just the right method to thrust 
us into the center of Sonny's tortured soul. Pellington came up with just 
the right actor as well. Jeremy Davies, who made his mark in the indie 
film "Spanking The Money", is a scrawny young man who doesn't faintly 
resemble the doughy character described in the novel, but within moments 
Davies makes it clear that he IS Sonny Burns. Stammering, shifting and 
casting his eyes ever downward, Davies is remarkably adept portraying a 
man who appears apologetic for merely existing. Complimenting Davies is 
Ben Affleck ("Chasing Amy") as Gunner, in an confident, effective 
performance. The original cut of "Going All The Way" was nearly three and 
one half hours. Forced to trim the film to under two hours, Pellington 
had to edit a major subplot involving, among other things, the 
ramifications of Gunner growing a beard in the ultra-conservative 
Indianapolis of the 50s. Sadly, the result somewhat mutes the development 
of Gunner's character and gives the talented Affleck limited time to show 
his chops. Hopefully we'll see a director's cut with restored footage 
someday.
Several supporting cast members stand out, notably Amy Locane as Buddy, 
Sonny's "safe" girlfriend, and Rachel Weisz, dazzling as Marty Pilcher, 
an art student who hits Gunner like a thunderclap. Jill Clayburgh is 
scary as Sonny's mother, an over-possessive fundamentalist whose cloying 
patter fails to mask her emotional terrorism, and Lesley Ann Warren is a 
knockout as Nina, Gunner's sexy Mom. Warren has one of the film's most 
outrageously comic scenes, when she confronts Gunner over his 
relationship with a Jewish girl and spews some absolutely insane anti-
Semitic bile.
Production designer Therese Deprez won an award at the Sundance Film 
Festival for turning Indianapolis into a model of 1950s style. Her sets 
are dead-on, providing a bright contrast to the story's dark tone. 
Enlivened by many funny moments, "Going All The Way" remains a dark tale 
that invigorates because of its bracing honesty. Wakefield, Pellington 
and company have much to be proud of here. Hopefully, their work will 
show other filmmakers that classic books can become winning films, when 
talented artists respect the integrity of the source.</P>
