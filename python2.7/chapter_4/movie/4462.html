<PRE>                            AKELE HUM AKELE TUM
                       A film review by Ashok Singh
                        Copyright 1995 Ashok Singh</PRE>
<PRE>United Seven Combines
Written & Directed by Mansoor Khan
Music : Anu Malik
Cast : Aamir Khan, Manisha Koirala, Shafdi Inamdar, Paresh Rawal            </PRE>
<P>     Mansoor Khan is one of the few directors who make films from the
heart and not for commercial success.  The era of character-driven films
about human conflicts seemed to end when film-makers like Gulzar,
Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and Basu Chaterjee reverted to television and
made fewer films.  They knew how to successfully combine artistic merit
and entertainment in films with popular stars.  Their films were neither
"art" films nor "commerciial."  Mansoor Khan's films always have good
character development and AHAT does a fine job with the lead pair as
well as the supporting roles.</P>
<P>     Aamir Khan gives another excellent performance.  His emotions were
perfectly portrayed as a struggling music director trying to raise his
young son on his own. 1995 has been his best year in films with a wide
array of roles from BAAZI, RANGEELA, and now AHAT.  Manisha Koirala
also gives a commendable performance.  This film along with BOMBAY will
nominate her for acting awards.</P>
<P>      The theme of marital discord has been done many times before in
films such as ABHIMAAN, DO ANJAANE, THODI SI BEWAFI etc.  But in those
films either the husband or wife have been singled out as the reason
for the separation.  In this film both Aamir and Manisha's have been
shown in a negative light.</P>
<P>       One of the film's strong points are the dialogues by Nasir
Hussain who teamed up with Mansoor Khan in QAYAMAT SE QAYAMAT TAK & JO
JEETA WOHI SIKANDAR.  This is a film that makes you care about the
characters and succeeds on the merits of its strong screenplay and
doesn't need any stylized violence, or superb cinematography to
maintain the interest of the viewers.</P>
