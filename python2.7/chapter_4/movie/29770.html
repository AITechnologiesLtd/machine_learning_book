<P>_Serendipity_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        "A fortunate accident" is how Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) defines the
concept of "serendipity" to Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) early on in Peter
Chelsom's romantic comedy of the same name.  Accident or not, _Serendipity_ the
film can certainly be described as a "fortunate" arrival in multiplexes during
this less-than-stellar year.  The film is hardly a groundbreaker, but it most
certainly a big-hearted charmer--and when it comes to the rom-com genre, that's
all that matters.</P>
<P>        Much of the charm comes from leads Cusack and Beckinsale, who establish
a palpable romantic rapport in the film's extended prologue.  It's rush holiday
shopping season in 1990 New York City, and Jonathan and Sara meet when fighting
for the last pair of black cashmere gloves in a crowded department store.  A
search for gloves appears to have become a discovery of love, for the strongly
attracted pair then spend one long night on the town getting to know each other
and falling hard.  But the timing is off for the attached Sara, and she proposes
to Jonathan an unusual plan where they part, leaving their reunion entirely up
to the powers of fate.  Years later, Sara and Jonathan are in committed
relationships with other people, but both still keep watch for possible
signs--and consider the idea of taking destiny into their own hands.</P>
<P>        Notions of fate and destiny aren't an alien concept in romantic
comedies; in recent years the concept has become somewhat of a staple, playing a
role in films from 1993's smash _Sleepless_in_Seattle_ to the recently released
_Happy_Accidents_.  Writer Marc Klein doesn't make many, if any, deviations from
tried-and-true formula.  Not only do the pieces of the plot fall into their
expected places at all the regularly scheduled intervals, the characterizations
also have a ring of familiarity.  Both Sara and Jonathan have best
friends/sounding boards who have quirky senses of humor; the current love
interest for the female is eccentric to say the least, and the one for the male
has her share of neuroses.</P>
<P>        While innovation is always a welcome addition to any film, it's not
entirely necessary in a film like _Serendipity_.  What matters most is the
manner in which it goes about its familiar business, and those behind
_Serendipity_ have made an immensely likable entertainment.  Not only do they
strike convincing sparks together, the affable Cusack and the luminous
Beckinsale are able to engage the audience individually, a critical component
considering they spend most of the film carrying separate halves of the film. 
However, they are strongly helped by the well-cast supporting players.  The
lively comic instincts of Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven elevate what could have
easily been stock best friend roles; in Piven's case, his lifelong off-screen
friendship with Cusack makes for an added level of convincing on-camera
cameraderie.  As the potential spoilers to a Jonathan-Sara pairing, John Corbett
and Bridget Moynahan are also appealing, albeit in different ways.  Moynahan's
Hallie isn't so much ill-suited for Jonathan than simply not as an ideal a match
as Sara; Corbett's eccentric, egocentric new age musician Lars is harder to
like, but his charisma makes Sara's attraction to him understandable.</P>
<P>        Such sharp casting and performances is a testament to the wonderful
directing job by Chelsom.  From the first frames he sets up the right atmosphere
of fairy tale romance; contributing mightily to that is John de Borman's
cinematography, which captures all the visual splendor of winter in the Big
Apple (a sight that is even more powerful and magical in light of recent
events).  More importantly, however, Chelsom found the right rhythm for this
story, and the film comes in at an efficient sub-90-minute run time.  There
isn't a wasted moment, and as such _Serendipity_ leaves one with a pleasant
feeling few films generate: that of wanting more.</P>
