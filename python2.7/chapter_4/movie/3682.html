<PRE>                                BRAVEHEART
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: With some major accuracy problems and
          some anachronistic language Mel Gibson
          entertainingly tells the story of legendary 13th
          Century Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace.
          Not all of the film works, but only because the
          story was so ambitious for a second directorial
          effort.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).  For general
          information and comparison, following the review I
          will describe my understanding of the history of
          Wallace, some of which might be considered film
          spoiler.</PRE>
<P>     With the directorial experience of just one film, THE MAN WITHOUT
A FACE, Mel Gibson has tried to make his own film comparable to
SPARTACUS, built around the late 13th Century Scottish hero and freedom
fighter Sir William Wallace.  He has given the film a 177-minute length
of which could have been better used to tell the story of this larger-
than-life hero.  Unfortunately, Gibson's pacing is a bit off and the
film gives way to some dull stretches.  This is a film that I am happy
I did my homework for before seeing to avoid being too impressed by the
film and then having to be disillusioned later when I discovered the
film's inaccuracies.</P>
<P>     The story, with many obvious parallels to that of the film
SPARTACUS, tells of the young Wallace growing up in a Scotland occupied
by the troops of Edward Longshanks (a.k.a. Edward I, played by Patrick
McGoohan).  William's father narrowly misses being murdered with some
other important Scots, then is killed fighting Edward.  William is
brought up by his uncle and taught to fight with his wits rather than
by brute strength.  He returns home to live as a simple farmer, and the
story slows down to tell the story of his romance and marriage.  But
soon Edward's injustice reaches out to him.  Wallace strikes back, is
outlawed, and becomes a powerful leader of the rebels fighting against
English rule.</P>
<P>     In a large film with a big cast Patrick McGoohan walks away with
all honors as the villainous pre-Machiavellian Machiavellian King
Edward I.  Rarely has the screen produced so ruthless a tyrant.  While
more ruthless than the character he played in DANGER MAN (a.k.a. SECRET
AGENT), he brings the same cold, calculating efficiency to this role.
Gibson seems to have had his hands full directing the film and brought
little to his role more than expected.  Besides the apparent love of
freedom, he could have been playing his character Mad Max.</P>
<P>     Curiously, this film seems less anachronistic than its trailers
made it feel.  Occasional lines seem, if not out of place, at least
overly fine-tuned for the late 20th Century.  Having characters
exclaiming "Excellent!" seems better attuned to the time of Bill and
Ted than of William and Edward.  Gibson's visual style seems not yet
matured so that he overuses slow motion scenes, sometimes telegraphing
the action.  Some of his scenes seem contrived and unbelievable.  One
such scene involves a dead body that drips blood just at perfect
instant.  Another involves what has to be the world's least skittish
deer.  (You have to have seen the film to know what I mean.)</P>
<P>     Gibson tries to create a realistic feel by making Scottish
communities seem properly grimy, though he applies this standard far
less to women than to men.  He has a great deal of violence, graphic
and implied, in the course of the film.  Toward the end of the film
there are certainly some painful scenes to watch.  Gibson also has some
fun with the battle scenes that I suspect was not inspired by any
historical record.  Unfortunately, while the battle scenes are exciting
and colorful, what we see bears little relation to what actually
happened in the battles portrayed.  In fact, while the film seems to
say that Wallace was trained to use his wits in battle rather than
brute force, that is not how he is portrayed on the screen.  The
historical Wallace used his wits far more in battle than Gibson's
representation, who seems to rely on a good speech and little more than
headlong berserker assaults.  (The battle shown are very little like
the real battles.  See the historical note after the review.)</P>
<P>     BRAVEHEART is well-intentioned and ambitious, but is
disappointingly flawed.  It probably required a more experienced
director--and one who would have demanded a little more from Gibson.I
give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     HISTORICAL NOTE (possible light spoilers):</P>
<P>     In the years just preceding William Wallace's revolt Edward I knew
his real enemy was France to the south with a military force much
superior to his own.  England had been at peace with Scotland for more
than a century and Edward expected little trouble from the north.  But
John de Balliol, King of Scotland, allied himself with Philip IV of
France rather than supply Edward with men and arms to fight the French.
It was not a strong alliance since France had little faith in John's
power to defend his title as king.</P>
<P>     Edward was already taxing England for the war with France and did
not relish the idea of fighting a war against Scotland and France at
the same time.  He certainly did not want to tax his people for both.
In 1290 he had expelled the Jews from England and without them to
borrow from any more he was finding that the decision to expel had been
a costly one.</P>
<P>     Edward decided to confer with Scotland's King John and to assure
John's loyalty.  He called upon John to meet him at Berwick.  John
refused.  Edward took this as a declaration of war and invaded Scotland
with intent to conquer, sacking Berwick.  King John then renounced any
homage to England.  But Edward's commander, Warenne, the Earl of
Surrey, defeated King John at the Battle of Dunbar.  He captured John
and imprisoned him.  Edward declared himself to be King of Scotland
before returning to fight France.</P>
<P>     Edward set up a puppet government in Scotland, not expecting much
resistance.  William Wallace, the son of a poor knight, was outlawed at
this time when he got into a personal argument with a young Englishman.
The Englishman Selby insulted Wallace and Wallace killed him.  Wallace
joined one of the several bands of outlaws.  With a band of 30 men he
burned Lanark and killed the sheriff in May 1297.</P>
<P>     Wallace organized an army from the small landowners and organized
guerilla attacks on the English between Forth and Tay.  Through this
time Edward was fighting in France and Wallace was fighting the Earl of
Surrey.  Surrey brought a large army to fight Wallace in September.
The two armies met September 11, 1297, at the Battle at Cambuskenneth
(a.k.a. Stirling) Bridge near Forth.  (This is very different from how
the battle was portrayed in the film.)  A narrow bridge separated the
two armies.  The Earl's own advisors told him that he could not get his
full army across the bridge in under eleven hours and if he tried
crossing he could bring only a small part of his army to bear on
defense.  He ignored the advice and ordered him men across the bridge.
Wallace awaited the proper time, when about half the army was across
the bridge, and attacked.  Half the army watched helpless on the far
bank as the other was driven back into the river to drown.  Wallace
earned a stunning victory and in the process captured Stirling Castle.</P>
<P>     Edward made a truce with France by marrying the king's sister and
betrothing the king's daughter to his son.  He was off in Flanders when
he found out that Wallace had defeated his army and, flushed with
victory, had invaded England and was sacking Cumberland and North
Umberland.  Wallace was knighted and given the guardianship of Scotland
ruled in Balliol's name.  He decorated his shield with the skin of an
English tax-collector.</P>
<P>     Edward I, having his truce with France, re-invaded Scotland,
marched to Stirling, and met Wallace's army at Falkirk on July 22,
1298.  Wallace formed his forces into four schiltrons.  That is a
circle of men with spears pointed outward (similar to what the film
showed at Battle of Stirling Bridge, but that was a straight line).
Edward's knights could do little against these phalanxes and so were
called off.  Instead the English used a shower of arrows from long
bows.  This made quick work of the Scottish army.  Wallace, however,
survived by hiding in a dense nearby wood.</P>
<P>     Wallace resigned his guardianship, but still fought a guerrilla
war against the English in Scotland.  In 1305 he was arrested at
Robroyston near Glasgow.  He was found guilty of being a traitor to
Edward, though he had never sworn allegiance to the king.  He was
executed that same year, much in the manner shown in the film.</P>
<P>     Contrary to the film, however, Edward I did not die until 1307,
Edward II did not marry until 1308, and Edward II's and Isabella's
first child was Edward III who was not born until 1310.  Henry the
Minstrel, also known as "Blind Harry" made Wallace a popular hero by
immortalizing him in an epic romance poem in the 15th Century.</P>
