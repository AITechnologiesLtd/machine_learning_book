<PRE>NON-STOP
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Murky and confused, the Japanese import "Non-Stop" ("Dangan Ranna")
is a pale precursor to Tom Tykwer's exhilarating "Run Lola Run" from 1998.
Both films share a central premise of a shady deal gone awry resulting in a
pivotal figure--in "Non-Stop" it's actually three protagonists--run, run,
running for their life/lives.  And there's also the intriguing plot device
of learning more about our leading player(s) as time elapses, through
flashbacks and fast forwards.</P>
<PRE>        But there the comparisons end.</PRE>
<P>        "Non-Stop" was actually made in 1996 but is only now seeing a US
release thanks--but not many--to those indie promoters over at Shooting
Gallery.  So it's more likely that, if anything, Tykwer borrowed from
writer/director Hiroyuki Tanaka (typically credited as Sabu as he is here).
If Tykwer did draw his inspiration from "Non-Stop," then he improved upon
the original no end.</P>
<P>        Tomoro Taguchi plays a would-be bank robber who, as the film opens,
is plotting one big score.  Forgetting his mask, he ducks into a local
convenience store and ineptly shoplifts one, which is when the chase
begins.  Hurtling along, the thief's pursuer (the store clerk, played by
Daimond Yukai) clumsily collides with a local Yakuza (Shinichi Tsutsumi
plays the gangster) who subsequently takes up the pursuit.</P>
<P>        Much of the film's scant 82-minute running time is made up of these
three grown men dashing through the streets of downtown Tokyo, all keeping
an oddly safe and equal distance from each other.  These men share a common
bond in that they are losers: Yasuda (Taguchi) cannot hold down even the
most menial of jobs as a kitchen aide, and his planned robbery is partly an
attempt to impress his girlfriend; Aizawa (Yukai) is a would-be rock star
with a heroin habit; and Takeda (Tsutsumi) is living with the stigma of
letting his mob boss take a fatal hit.</P>
<P>        Whereas "Run Lola Run" was an adrenaline rush from start to finish,
"Non-Stop" is just plain silly.  Tykwer's film was smart and kinetic, its
heroine alive and ablaze, its real and imagined situations by turns
creative and absurd, pulsing with portent and unpredictability.  "Non-Stop"
is none of these.  It feels amateurish and uneven.  Even the subtitles are
often times poorly translated.</P>
<P>        Likewise the film is supposed to be a black comedy but there are
few laughs to be found among the shattered lives and machismo violence.
One Asian family in the audience, who perhaps detected some culturally
significant reference, was laughing uncontrollably during a sequence in
which the runners pass an attractive woman who has stooped to pick
something up.  Momentarily distracted from their ultimate fate, all three
men have similar (sexual) fantasies as they breeze on by.</P>
<P>        While more clever than amusing, this scene is one of the few in
which the director actually appears to be in control of his material,
taking full advantage of the inventive gimmick at the center of his film.
Otherwise, "Non-Stop" is a long haul, a never-ending marathon of good
intentions marred by missed opportunities.</P>
