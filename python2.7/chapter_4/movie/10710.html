<PRE>CASINO (1995)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Martin Scorsese
Writers: Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese (based on the book
"Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi)
Starring: Robert DeNiro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, James
Woods, Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollak, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers,
John Bloom, Pasquale Cajano, Catherine Scorsese, Melissa Prophet, Bill
Allison, Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen, Jerry Vale</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese has a knack for making a film fascinating from start to
finish, while still presenting an interesting and brilliant take on
something that's familiar and cliched.  "After Hours" was a brilliant
everything-bad-that-could-happen-happens film, "Cape Fear" was a
fantastic stalker thriller, and "The Age of Innocence" put an ingenius
twist on the costume drama, stripping it down to its bone.  "Casino" is
your brilliant Vegas flick, stripping that down to the bone, and
exposing what makes its so alluring.</P>
<P>On first glance, this film resembles Scorsese's "Goodfellas."  We have
some of the same actors in the leads, a female who causes a rift, lots
of swearing and graphic violence, a narration undertoned with a great
soundtrack of oldies and rock tunes, a rise and fall structure, and a
cameo from Marty's mom, Catherine (but she's in most of his films
anyway).  But this is purely superficial, and on closer examination,
it's nothing like it.</P>
<P>While "Goodfellas" showed that the allure of the mafia was that you
could basically get away with anything anytime you wanted, "Casino"
shows that the allure of Vegas is because of the mafia.  When you go
there (though I've never been there), you get the feeling that you're
living life on the edge, playing against the rules, and if you're caught
cheating, you could easily be killed.  Of course, it's not like that
anymore, but "Casino" takes us back in time to the glory days of Vegas,
when it was still run by the mafia.</P>
<P>It does this by telling us a little melodrama, which is something we've
heard before, but is given a magnificent backdrop that it can affect. 
Our protagonist is Sam Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), a bone fide gambler
who knows everything about it.  He is chosen by the mafiasos who run
Vegas from far away to run one of their biggest casinos: The Tangiers. 
For the first hour or so, we get an in-depth introduction to this world,
which tells us all the inside material, and just engulfs us into it so
we can feel the right way when it begins to collapse piece by piece. 
One of the best things about Scorsese is his attention to every single
detail about the worlds he creates.  I have a feeling if this guy ever
did a documentary, it'd make millions.</P>
<P>But two people enter Sam's life, and begin to tear apart the foundation
of Vegas: Sam's old tempermental bud, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), not far
from his Tommy character in "Goodfellas;" and Ginger McKenna (Sharon
Stone), a con artist/hooker who seduces Sam without much strain, but
begins to selfishly tear it apart due to some of her weaknesses.  Even
though she ends up marrying Sam early in the film, she still has a sick
devotion to her old pimp/friend, Lester Diamond (James Woods, at his
sleaziest), who begins to spark some nerves in Sam.</P>
<P>While this plot is, yes, cliche-ridden, it is nevertheless fascinating,
and works flawlessly with the backdrop.  The mafia, after all, can get
too greedy and selfish for their own good, and can self-destruct due to
just one person's slip up or stupidity.  Over the course of the three
hour film, this is what happens, but the film makes us care for the
characters and for what we have been shown as Vegas that it becomes
devastating when it crumbles at the end.</P>
<P>This is the magic of Scorsese: to make a film which is so real that if
anything happens to it, it has almost the same impact on the audience as
it does to the characters on the screen.  The film is never boring, and
is never a film where you continually check your watch for the time. 
Scorsese is a master at seducing his audience into watching his world
unfold, and even the first hour where very little action happens, it's
probably the best time you'll have at the movies for a long time.</P>
<P>Every scene is carefully plotted out, and every shot is framed
perfectly.  As many people have once said, "You haven't seen 'Casino'
till you've seen the Widescreen Version," and that's true.  If you see
his cropped pan-and-scan version, you're missing out on half the movie. 
You miss a lot of the great swooping camera work that Scorsese is famous
for, and that's one of the best things about watching Scorsese.  No
other director has utlized the camera so well as he has.</P>
<P>The soundtrack, while not as great as the one for "Goodfellas," is
nevertheless amazing, and enhances every scene it is used in.  I
particularly love his usage of vintage Stones songs, with whom he has an
obvious affection for.  But this time, he actually goes so far as to use
Devo's remake of "Satisfaction," which plays throughout the ending (a
note should be made that he also uses their signature hit, "Whip It"). 
My favorite scene in the movie, where two cheaters are caught and dealt
with appropriately, is enhanced to perfect heights with a great Rod
Stewart song (not sure of the name), which is accentuates every beat of
the scene.  Scorsese would also make a great music video director
(though he did do Michael Jackson's "Bad").</P>
<P>The acting, as always, is amazing.  DeNiro plays a more reserved
character this time, seeming to be in perpetual deep thought, but always
looking tough.  Pesci is predictably awesome, even if his character is
very reminiscent of the one in "Goodfellas," and even if he has trouble
with nailing his accent (it's Bostonian, then Long Islandian, then
Kentuckian...).  And Sharon Stone, whom I thought would suck when
compared to these two leads, is actually awesome.  She hits the right
note of her character, making her seductive and lovable, yet still
possessing all her flaws.  Her decent into madness is also very well
done.</P>
<P>In the supporting cast, we have Don Rickles acting surprisingly reserved
and controlled in the role of the manager of the Tangiers, Alan King
also acting very reserved and controlled in the role of one of the chief
of staff of the Tangiers, and Kevin Pollak...whew...also acting very
reserved and controlled in the role of another chief of staff at the
Tangiers.  So Scorsese does have good control over his comedians in
serious roles (not to mention, Dick Smothers is a hypocritical senator,
and Joe Bob Briggs himself - as John Bloom: his real name? - plays a
stupid hick working as the slot machine manager because his uncle is a
town commissioner).  And James Woods goes pretty wild with his role.  No
shock there.</P>
<P>Special note should be made to Frank Vincent, who has been in Scorsese's
"Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas" in smaller roles, and in both of them,
was beaten up horrifically by Pesci's respective characters.  In this
one, he finally gets a bigger part, and also his revenge on Pesci...</P>
<P>Scorsese is the real king of the movie though.  Like Tarantino, Woody
Allen, and Kubrick, he attracts crowds just because of his name in the
directing slot.  His films are, for the most part, incredible
masterpieces which astound and complex people for as long as they live
after they've seen them.  "Casino" has some flaws, but it is one of the
most fascinating films he's ever made.  While taking an interesting
stance on the allure of Vegas, he also creates a film which is
engrossing from start to finish, and not many directors can hold their
audiences in their grip like he can.</P>
