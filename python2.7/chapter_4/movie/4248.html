<P>     A combination of coincidence and trend has just brought us at
least three new American movies either directed by women and/or with a
nearly all-female cast: Diane Keaton's UNSTRUNG HEROES, David
Anspaugh's (HOOSIERS) MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO, and, by Australian
Jocelyn Moorhouse (PROOF), HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT.</P>
<P>     In MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO a bunch of relatives and/or friends are
trying to support college poetry teacher Elizabeth Perkins after her
(also academic) husband is killed in a yuppie accident: a car hits him
as he jogs.</P>
<P>     MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO is a would-be tearjerker.  The problem is
that the tears are on the screen and not in the audience, unless you
count tears caused by boredom.</P>
<P>     The script, from a play by Neil Simon's daughter, suffers from
uninteresting everything: characters, acts, facts and dialogue.  A lot
of useless yakety-yak here makes the sluggish pace even slower.  The
talk is of time-killing trivia.  The death-in-the-family treatment is
far inferior to that in UNSTRUNG HEROES.  The roles are dull and
artificially constructed--much less attention-getting than those in
HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT.</P>
<P>     The consolers are themselves in need of drastic straightening out
too.  The ladies bond, de-bond, re-bond.  A hefty Whoopi Goldberg, a
pottery maker, is unstable, with pathological fears about her husband
leaving her.  Gwyneth Paltrow, still mixed up from the long-ago death
of her mother,  spots a kooky, perpetually hat-wearing student of her
sister Perkins.  The movie telegraphs with hammer-blows that a new
twosome is in the making.  And as Paltrow has troubles with her
virginity, she first shows her body to Big Sis who decrees "You're a
knockout.  You should never wear clothes." Then she asks Sis for advice
on how to moan during sex.  Perkins obliges. ( I am not making any of
this up).  And to think that they now blame the Internet.</P>
<P>     Kathleen Turner--whose best role by far was in SERIAL MOM--is
photographed in terribly unflattering ways, with the focus on her oddly
soft nose, while she has an un-dimensional, vague part as a
self-centered, hard-nosed business exec.</P>
<P>     It takes 29 minutes into the film  (during which time you waste
your energy deciphering matters) to establish relationships or
unscramble who's who and what's what.  Even then things are not always
clear.</P>
<P>     The neighborhood seems to be bucolic suburbia--with too many
pretty landscape shots--of the "On Golden Pond" school.  For some
reason, sentimental family gatherings in movies are located in the East
of the United States, unlike the enormous majority of other subjects
that all take place in California. (Ph.D. thesis, anyone?)</P>
<P>     Perkins teaches a three-minute class (sic).  She also injects
Francois Truffaut in her lectures, for no discernible reason.
Distraught Perkins (the very actress who was recently quoted as
deriding Demi Moore's nudity in movies) takes a bath.  The mixing of
pathos and nipples is counterproductive, distracting indeed, as it is
known from statistics that 94.67 percent of men are voyeurs to some
degree.</P>
<P>     Turner turns out to be the former stepmother of Perkins and
Paltrow, whose father, at the funeral reception, is coyly told by his
ex that she needs a hug and kisses.  He replies "Here's my kiss, and
you fax me your hug."  That's the movie's best line.</P>
<P>     Except for Paltrow's new boyfriend, the main male presence is Bon
Jovi's.  He is a house painter, an Italian who speaks no English, and
whose buns inflame the women's libido.  They discuss them openly, until
the man turns out to be a real Yankee. (Score one for sitcom humor).
His name is wrongly believed to be Valentino, hence the awkward title.
The other part of the title comes from Bon Jovi showing up at night to
paint the Perkins home.  Why night?  He's a romantic, which leads of
course to intercourse that speeds up Perkins' healing process. (He also
relaxes Perkins by teaching her how to eat pizza with her fingers).How
exciting.  There is a mystery  however: is why change the house color
from a perfectly nice gray to the color of regurgitation?</P>
<P>     The bottom line in this film is that everyone, but everyone, is
uninteresting.  Not only is everyone unconvincing, but everything
stultifies us with boredom, down to the heavy, lachrymose musical
score.</P>
<P>     Capping all this, the "good-bye to Ben" (Perkins' defunct spouse)
finale has all the women, with painted faces, coming to terms with the
past by doing a kind of witchcrafty ritual at night, in the cemetery,
with loud music and song plus up and down dancing.  Then a magic rain
falls.  Ugh!</P>
