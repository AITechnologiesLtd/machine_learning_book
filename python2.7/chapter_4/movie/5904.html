<PRE>                        SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted.
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     So are you searching for a good movie for the whole family?  Does
your household have preteens in it who have outgrown the little kid
movies, but still would like to see shows that are exciting and that
can inspire them?  Do you like shows that not just for preteens, but
the whole family can enjoy?</P>
<P>     Let me take a little different approach in this review.  Think of
it as a questionnaire.  Do you like movies where</P>
<PRE>     o the characters are intelligent
     o the script is bright
     o people don't have to talk in 4 letter words to make points
     o kids to be heroes do not have to be in sports
     o it is okay to show kids from non-broken homes
     o it is okay to show kids who are healthy, not reformed
     o it does not have to have stupid sub-plots
     o parents can be wholesome yet still be interesting
     o you can show an adult at their place of work and show them happy
     o you can have classic showdown scenes yet have real surprises
     o you can have no violence and not be boring</PRE>
<P>     If you were able to answer in the affirmative to most of these
questions, I recommend SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and give it ***.
Even if you know nothing about the game of chess, I still recommend it
to you.  Knowing chess will improve your enjoyment only slightly of the
film and is not necessary.</P>
<P>     With a strong cast including Max Pomeranc as chess whiz Josh
Waitzkin, Joe Mantegna as his wise but not too pushy dad Fred, Joan
Allen as his mom Bonnie, Ben Kingsley as the expert Bruce Pandolfini,
and a great Laurence Fishburne as the local park chess king Vinnie.  A
sweet and heartwarming show.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
