<PRE>REVIEW: The Truman Show
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha
McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ted Raymond
Director: Peter Weir
Screenplay: Andrew Niccol
Australian theatrical release date: September 24</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</PRE>
<P>Who would have thought that two of this decade's most fascinating film
concepts have come from the same writer?  And that this writer, who uses
his craft as if he has worked with it for decades, has only these two
films under his belt.  Andrew Niccol wrote and directed 1997's Gattaca,
a scorching and nearly perfect science fiction film that seems to be
becoming science fact.  The Truman Show is equally interesting, but not
as complete or well crafted.  But it's still an excellent film, and
piles better than most mainstream counterparts.  In fact, the only thing
that Truman is missing is firm direction from its own mastermind.</P>
<P>Not that Australian Peter Weir doesn't do a good job, though.   The man
who directed such films as Witness and Gallipoli certainly has much
talent to offer; but Niccol seems eccentric and intelligent enough to
give a greater flair to his material. In that way, The Truman Show is a
little disappointing, but shows no faults that can't be overlooked, and
gives no moments that can't be enjoyed.</P>
<P>Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of his own twenty-four hour
documentary-soap opera.  It's the longest and most popular television
show in history, shot in the world's largest studio, one of only two
man-made structures visible from space.  You see, Truman is unaware of
the thousands of cameras around him, filming every action and every word
in his life.  Ed Harris plays Christof, the show's creator, who is
partly a god, a director and a father.  The women in Truman's life are
his wife Meryl (Laura Linney) and Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) - who
Truman has always considered as the one who got away, as she was forced
to depart the set after attempting to tell Truman that everything around
him was fake.  Marlon (Noah Emmerich) is his best mate, whose answers to
life's problems are found in a six pack.</P>
<P>It would be hard for any director, Niccol or no Niccol, to hide the
fairly significant flaws in the plot fabric - especially since
everything is crammed into a neat little 100-minute package.  The story
board of The Truman Show is just about as demanding as they get, with
turns and developments at every corner, and the fact that it is a show
within a world far too obsessed with mass media hysteria automatically
adds another dimension to the film.</P>
<P>Christof is easily the most intriguing character; a man who treats
Truman with all the care and love of a father but does nothing that
would strip him of a good camera angle.  When Marlon tells Truman that
he "would never lie" to him, the irony of the moment is given upon
Christof's order to fade the television music out.  The whole world is
watching while two best mates express their emotions. Ed Harris gives
Christof a real kick and an impeccable performance, marred only by a few
lines of silly dialogue towards the end, when he tries to persuade those
around him that Truman would be happier inside his comfortable nest
rather than in the real world.  As Internet reviewer Bryan Frazer
stated, "for Truman, the real media-induced nightmare is outside of the
bubble, not inside."</P>
<P>It will come as a relief for many to know that, for the first time in
history, Jim Carrey doesn't play the over-actor. Carrey gives a
carefully subdued performance, allowing him to express his characters
actions with eccentricity but not over-acting, and there's a major
difference between the two.  The over-actor of the film is Laura Linney,
who gives a google-eyed over impersonation of a cheesy sitcom character,
and ends up looking out of place and faintly idiotic.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, The Truman Show ends with a happy conclusion.  It's
not a complete one, though, since many characters seem to fade out of
existence.  This is perhaps Andrew Nicoll's only error in his
screenplay, as his carefully placed characterizations of the show's
actors seem to vanish into television fuzz.  But it's really Truman's
piece, and as he concludes his soul-searching journey, one can't help
but be emotionally attached to this wonderfully complex yet distinctly
humane character.</P>
<P>More than anything else, Weir seems determined to make his thoughts
about the irony of world's media clear.  As the final moments draw to a
close, we realize that there will always be an audience for the next
Truman Show, and that the people who cheered for his freedom are the
same who supported the show over its many years.  For this fetching
notion to be any more intriguing, inventive or prosperous, it would have
taken its own mastermind to direct it.</P>
