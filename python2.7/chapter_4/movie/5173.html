<P>     It's so easy -- too easy, in fact -- for a war movie to turn into a 
celebration of blood, death, and mayhem.  Exploitation of wars and their 
dehumanizing affects has become a staple of American action films (FIRST 
BLOOD, MISSING IN ACTION).  Occasionally, however, a rare and powerful 
war movie reaches the screen -- one that delivers a visceral anti-
violence message with the force of a punch to the gut.  STALINGRAD, a 
1993 German/Swedish co-production from Guenter Rohrbach, the producer of 
DAS BOOT, is such a picture.  In the tradition of APOCALYPSE NOW, 
PLATOON, and A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, it uses graphic violence to condemn war.</P>
<P>     STALINGRAD, which takes place between August 1942 and January 1943, 
chronicles Hitler's failed invasion of the Russian city -- one of the 
miscalculations that lost the war for Germany.  More than one million 
died in the bloody struggle, the fatalities caused by wounds, disease, 
and the same bitter cold that stopped Napolean's forces more than a 
century earlier.  STALINGRAD faithfully re-creates the principal 
historical aspects of the battle while telling a more intimate tale 
through the eyes of a small group of German characters.</P>
<P>     They are Hans Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann), a clean-cut lieutenant 
making his first trip to the front, and Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder (Jochen 
Nickel) and Fritz Reiser (Dominique Horwitz), two hardened veteran 
enlisted men.  Together, these three make the long, weary trek down the 
road of senseless violence and death, losing bits of their humanity 
along the way.  The horrors of STALINGRAD irrevocably destroy these men, 
strafing their souls and crushing their spirits.  By the end, it no 
longer matters whether they live or die -- in almost every way, they're 
already gone.</P>
<P>     The psychologically destructive power of war is most clearly 
illustrated through the changes undergone by Hans.  When STALINGRAD 
opens, he is a patriot serving the Fuhrer and Fatherland 
unquestioningly.  Soon, however, loyalty to his country is supplanted by 
loathing as he sees the inhumane treatment accorded to Russian prisoners 
of war.  Then, as the battle becomes desperate, with the German army 
losing scores just to capture another street, the most basic of animal 
drives -- the need to survive -- asserts itself.  Ultimately, even that 
runs dry, and Hans finds himself groping to save a tiny vestige of the 
man he once was.  </P>
<P>     There isolated moments of human triumph in STALINGRAD -- like a 
Russian and German exchanging bread for meat, and Hans setting a woman 
free instead of raping her.  But these are exceptions.  STALINGRAD's 
disturbing power comes through its portrayal of the horrific -- 
decapitations, amputations, grizzly deaths, and mutilations.  Nothing is 
gratuitous; everything is effective.  Director Joseph Vilsmaier pulls us 
into the trenches with these men, who are no different from soldiers on 
any side in any war.  STALINGRAD is packed with tension, and the battle 
sequences are startlingly realistic, but it's the inescapable message 
that lingers.  </P>
