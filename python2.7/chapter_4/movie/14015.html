<PRE>THE GINGERBREAD MAN (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Altman
Writer: Al Hayes (based on a story by John Grisham)
Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidtz, Roberty Downey Jr, Daryl Hannah,
Robert Duvall, Famke Janssen, Tom Berenger, Jesse James, Mae Whitman</P>
<P>"The Gingerbread Man" is a film that almost cries out to be made into a
piece of Hollywood fluff, and it would have been if it hadn't been directed
by someone like Robert Altman.  It's not surprising that this film is based
on a story by John Grisham, one of the current kings (or at least he's a
duke) of bestsellers, since it has to deal with his favorite topic -
lawyers being forced to go above and beyond their duties - and because it
soon descends into a kafkaesque nightmare where the protagonist's life is
turned inside out.</P>
<P>Yet it's effortlessly not like the other Grisham films, like "The Firm" and
"The Client."  There's more atmosphere, more plausible twists, less
contrivance (in comparison, that is), and one other quality the other
lacked: surprise.  As a hurricane (nicely titled "Geraldo") sweeps through
the film's location of Savannah, Georgia, the film tells a nice piece of
pulp where the twists are geniuine, and so is the atmosphere and the
characters.  And yet the pulp is another of the Grisham lawyer stories,
following a formula that has been perfected yet doesn't feel like it's
being followed all the time.</P>
<P>The story deals with, well, a southern lawyer named Rick Magruder (Kenneth
Branagh, with a flawless and not-at-all annoying Southern accent), who
arrives home from a case one night and finds his staff and friends have
thrown a party for him.  After chatting it up with his assistant (Daryl
Hannah, who's not at all bad in this) and a couple of his other staffers,
he leaves and runs into a waitress who was there, Mallory (Embeth Davidtz),
who's car is stolen and who ends up with a ride home from Rick.  Rick
discovers that Mallory suspects her father (Robert Duvall), a crazy old man
who has been stalking her of late, stole it, and when back at her house,
the two become close as she tells him of her problems and he tries
unsuccessfully to help.  The two end the conversation by sleeping together.</P>
<P>>From here on, Rick begins to feel a certain need to help her, and he
manages to get her father to court, where they win effortlessly, and he is
sent to a mental institution.  But he is broken out by a cult he belongs
to, and soon Rick's life is being turned upside down.  He gets threats in
the mail, finds out cars are following him, and soon begins to take the law
into his own hand.  For once in a real long time, Altman manages to make
everything very suspenseful, with some real geniune nail biters here, even
though the final chapter of the film is basically one big predictable
contrivance, bringing it to a cliched albeit less glossy ending that it
could have avoided.</P>
<P>It's not the plot I really liked about this film.  Most Grisham plots are
in all reality just throwaways.  His novels are entertaining, but let's
face it: they're forgettable.  You read it while on vacation or on breaks
from work, and when you're done, you read his next book and the cycle just
continues.  What Altman has done differently, something which the other
directors didn't do, is give it a personal touch.  Altman's a very original
director.  He goes for a less glossy approach to all his films, using lots
of sloppy and improvised close-ups, following many voice tracks at one
time, and just allowing the film to lay still as he allows characters to
just hang out.  Look at how he designs Rick's office staff and you'll see
how loose and free this film really is, even if its confined by a plot.</P>
<P>As for the element of surprise it introduces - what I mean is that it
allows us to feel a lot like the characters, and it never really lets us
onto thinking of possible conspiracies.  We go along with everything. 
We're there with Rick in his rage towards the second half of the film, when
his kids are kidnapped by someone and we all know who did it.  It doesn't
hurt that Kenneth Branagh is such a likable actor that he manages to make
Rick, who could be just a lawyer who may just be on the receiving end of
instant karma, into a sympathetic and lovable guy.</P>
<P>I can't say I totally liked this film.  It's still a contrived film, with
an ending that Altman fought with the studio over and you wonder why he
didn't just look for a better one.  And Altman's free direction, which
allows mood and characters to be more prominent than plot doesn't exactly
work perfectly well with a film where the plot is so important.  And this
film is disappointing in one major way: just the fact that this was
directed by someone as amazing as Altman.  This certainly can't be a step
forward for the same man who less than a decade ago made a brilliant little
film called "The Player."</P>
<P>But I'm still one of the few people who try to look at every film by a
director as a singular piece of art, and not judge him from his others. 
This man has made "M*A*S*H" and "Nashville."  So what?  Directors sometimes
need to take breaks but still direct, and making films like this, that are
never meant to be masterpieces is sometimes refreshing.  I remember when
Martin Scorsese made "Cape Fear" and some critics criticized it for not
being as great as, say, "Raging Bull."  I suppose the difference between
this film and that one is that "Cape Fear" WAS a great film, and "The
Gingerbread Man" is merely just good.</P>
