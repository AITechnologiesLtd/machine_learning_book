<P>   They say that adolescence is the most trying time in a
person's life--hormones raging, bodies changing, depressions
and elations intertwined. They say that the forties are a trying
time--midlife crisis, "is that all there is," no more career
advancement to look forward to.  Truth to tell, every time is
trying and the twenties are about as difficult a decade for
Americans as any other as proved by Greg Berlanti's "The
Broken Hearts Club"--which happens to deal strictly with
twenty-somethings in the West Hollywood gay community but
which Berlanti insists is a universal, cross-over story.  It's
isn't really.  The young men, mostly handsome, some
average, seem more self-absorbed than they should be, and
since "The Broken Hearts Club" purports to be a movie and
not a play or a cable TV program, Berlanti should have
opened it up more at least to dissipate this tedious immersion
in these me-generation bores.  The story could have taken
place in a studio easily enough for all the background he
gives us to the political or social aspects of the time and
while the film is tightly edited with a strong thematic focus,
the men yada yada yada so much that they could just as
soon be in one of the French talkathons that bore the blazes
out of most of us.</P>
<P>   The story's center is Dennis Timothy Olyphant) who, being
on the verge of celebrating his 28th birthday, is at the time of
life that he wonders whether he should stop switching
partners in favor of having a real relationship with someone
permanent.  His role model for this view is the group's father
figure, Jack (John Mahoney), who is a part-owner of a
successful restaurant together with some of the young ones
and who serves as the guys' coach each time they play their
middle-league baseball games.</P>
<P>   Most of the discussion ranges around the self-
consciousness and envies of the individuals, with average
looking Patrick (Ben Weber) wishing (like the others,
perhaps) that they were Cole (Dean Cain), who is the best
looking fellow in the group and has just landed a small role in
a movie.  Kevin (Andrew Keegan) is the youngest, just 23,
and he has just come out of the closet, or rather, he is
cautiously wandering out and stepping back in like a dog who
is bravely approaches and then judiciously backs away from
a stranger.  </P>
<P>  In a side plot that is the least convincing and seems to
come from another movie, Leslie (Nia Long) has a long-time
relationship with Anne (Mary McCormack) and tries to
convince Anne's brother Patrick to donate sperm so that she
can have a baby that looks something like the object of her
affection.  Berlanti tries to eke some humor out of the fact
that the donor center has no "Hustler" magazine on hand to
assist the men.</P>
<P>   "The Broken Hearts Club" says nothing fresh and has no
particular lines of great wit or particularly interesting
characters--given their incessant "look at me" or "I wish I
were" vocabularies.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 94 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
