<P>"They talk funny down there."
     - Zelda Harris, who's ten-year-old character has returned from an 
       extended visit "down south."</P>
<P>     Spike Lee goes back to Brooklyn in CROOKLYN, an amusing, 
fictionalized look at the filmmaker's family life in the 1970's. No 
controversy here, just a sprawling comedy/drama that's filled with 
moldy oldies, freaky fashions, and, surprise!, clean city streets.</P>
<P>     Meet the Carmichaels. Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) is the high-strung 
mother who teaches school to pay the bills so her husband, Woody 
(Delory Lindo), can work at reviving his stalled career as a jazz 
musician. Mom's on the edge and can barely keep her (five) kids under 
wraps; they scream and shout about everything from watching SOUL TRAIN 
to eating ice-cream.</P>
<P>     For the Carmichaels, life on "the stoop" has both good days and 
bad. One day they're bickering with their bizarre next-door neighbor 
(David Patrick Kelly), the next they're all crying 'cause Daddy's left 
home. But CROOKLYN, like youth, is relatively upbeat and, with one 
exception, nothing terrible ever befalls the family. Even after an 
experiment in shoplifting by oldest child and only girl Troy (played 
by Zelda Harris, who is the *real* find in the film).</P>
<P>     In fact, the biggest threat on the block is a pair of airplane-
glue sniffers!  Wow, what a difference a double-decade makes.</P>
<P>     Well-intentioned it is, well-written it ain't. CROOKLYN is a 
narrative train-wreck that splits the focus in too many directions. 
Mom and dad and the kids and the neighbors and the merchants all 
compete for story time and, simply, there's too much going on to know 
on what's really going on.</P>
<P>     (My vote for Most Glaring Non-sequitur is David Patrick Kelly, 
who has a split-second *second* role as a TV preacher with a wife 
who's wearing just a tad too much makeup. Sound familiar? :)</P>
<P>     But Spike's skills as a director are always fresh and CROOKLYN is 
certainly a good watch.  That is, with the exception of his choice to 
change the film's aspect ratio during a family visit "down south." But 
the joke's on Lee-- his portrayal of The-South-as-a-another-planet is 
*already* disorienting.</P>
<PRE>     Pity the poor projectionist who has to field questions on *this* 
one!</PRE>
<P>     Oddly, CROOKLYN doesn't do extremes. Lee keeps a tight reign on 
both dour drama and high hilarity. The tears are few and the laughs 
are lazy. He doesn't skimp on the music, though, and CROOKLYN features 
over three *dozen* period pieces that are available, as the credits 
conveniently note, on a two-volume soundtrack set.</P>
<P>     Lest we forget the errs of our ways, credit the design 
departments for filling this 70's Offend-A-Thon with orange walls and 
platform shoes and more afros than you can shake a pick at. May we 
never paint furniture olive again.</P>
<PRE>HUMANE NOTE:  The film features some hilarious politically incorrect
              animal abuse, including one gut-buster that's worth the 
              price of matinee admission. The gag even beats A FISH 
              CALLED WANDA for croaked-canine comedy.</PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Spike Lee takes a break from controversy to spend a 
              summer in Brooklyn with this fictionalized look at 
              family life in the 197O's.  Amusing to no end, CROOKLYN 
              is less story than slice-of-life and the change is 
              relatively refreshing.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C+</PRE>
