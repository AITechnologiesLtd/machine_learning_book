<PRE>                              ARMY OF DARKNESS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In the third "Evil Dead" film, a man
     from the 20th Century unleashes war between medieval armies
     of the living and an army of the Dead.  In the right hands
     this could be a very exciting concept.  Unfortunately, Raimi
     plays it off for easy laughs and fails to make a film that
     comes even close to being worthy of the concept.  Rating: low
     +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD was a low-budget horror film that was above
average for its kind.  It combined fluid camerawork (often with undercranked
cameras) and a fresh look at the then over-used concept of the walking dead.
It made a name for Raimi as a director willing to do the unusual.  While
ostensibility the same sort of film, EVIL DEAD II picked up the pacing and
increased the creativity by a large factor.  It was a wild, funhouse sort of
horror film where just about anything weird could happen.  The accent was on
being strange and funny with gooseflesh becoming a low priority.  The film
ended by dropping its main character through some sort of evil vortex into
medieval Europe.</P>
<P>     Determined to play the ball where it lies, the third of the "Evil Dead"
films begins with Ash arriving in medieval Europe and eventually gets him
involved in an epic battle between the living and the dead.  ARMY OF
DARKNESS is another giant leap in creativity, but this time Raimi has gone
too far.  This film shows just how far Sam Raimi has allowed his reach to
exceed his grasp.  ARMY OF DARKNESS is a truly magnificent failure.  The
concept of an apocalyptic battle of the powers of Darkness against the
powers of Light has been toyed with by writers from Milton to
J. R. R. Tolkien and James Blish.  When Clive Barker adapted his CABAL into
NIGHTBREED, he also said what he wanted to do someday--and what that film
gave only an inkling ofwas such a mammoth battle of the Dead against the
Living.  The Raimis (Sam co-scripted ARMY OF DARKNESS with his brother Ivan)
try to tell the story of such a battle, but squander too much of the effect
on cheap one-line jokes, insufficient humor, and images that often don't
work.  The scripting is weak and the camerawork often captures exactly the
wrong mood.  The Raimis could not get their tongues out of their cheeks long
enough to realize they were squandering what could have  been a great horror
fantasy classic.</P>
<P>     Bruce Campbell recreates his role as Ash, who now finds himself caught
up in a "Connecticut Yankee" sort of plot as he prepares for the battle.
However, the Raimis do not have the writing skill of a Mark Twain, so Ash's
programmed response to problems is to use his shotgun or his chainsaw.  When
Ash fouls up a mission to retrieve the NECRONOMICON--the classic book of
evil--he inadvertently looses on the world a battalion of skeletons.  The
Raimis fail to build much excitement about the ensuing battle, playing it
more for giggles than thrills.  And the final sequence of the film, which
seems horribly out of keeping with the rest of the story, is apparently an
afterthought.  The conclusion of the film as shown at the Sitges Film
Festival and reported in the October 19, 1992, VARIETY, was much bleaker but
also probably much more effective than what was shown in local theaters.</P>
<P>     I rate ARMY OF DARKNESS a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale, mostly on the
basis of some good ideas albeit mishandled.  Maybe somebody else will pick
up the idea again.</P>
