<PRE>REVIEW:                        THE MUMMY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:                Joy Wyse, the SILVER screen critic</PRE>
<P>In the first scenes of the movie, when the Pharaoh's mistress appears,
you get the impression that this is not a movie for children.  But, you'd
be wrong.  Her `dress' is alluring, but it's only provocative, not
revealing.  For a few seconds, you think that she and her lover could be
the `good guys' but they are not.  This guy is NOT the Pharaoh.    She is
slain for being unfaithful, and her organs are removed and placed into
five jars.  Then, her lover becomes the Mummy of the title when he is
wrapped in gauze and put into a sarcophagus, with a jugful of roaches, and
buried.</P>
<P>Does this sound like a movie for kids?  Well, it is.  Throughout the
movie I kept thinking that my nine-year old grandson will love it.  There
are interesting moments as they dutifully explain the mummification
process.  It is not a great film by any account, but I'll bet that it will
become a favorite with young boys (and girls) all over.  When my children
were that age, they totally enjoyed a movie where the good guys battled
skeletons.  I think that it was `The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad' or such.  I
really didn't think that it was a very good film, but they talk about it
to this day.  The Mummy is that kind of film.  It makes you think of
`Raiders of the Lost Ark' and Brendan Fraser is very reminiscent of
Harrison Ford instead of being a cartoon character like George of the
Jungle. </P>
<P>When movies such as the original Mummy and Frankenstein were made many
years ago, you knew that such events couldn't really happen, but they
scared you to death.  Too many films today show shootings, explosions, and
other mayhem to `entertain' you, but unfortunately, they could happen.  
That really scares me.    The Mummy is a fun, scary movie.  You know that
something is going to jump out at you, but you enjoy it.  The woman behind
me let out a scream that embarrassed her, but she was scared!  </P>
<P>You won't recognize most of the actors by name, but you'll remember
seeing them `somewhere'.  They are all excellent in their roles.  They
also reminded me of old-time actors like Peter Lorre, and J. Carroll Nash.
 It is well worth your time.  Take your kids and grandkids, and let
yourself just be entertained without analyzing the production values.</P>
