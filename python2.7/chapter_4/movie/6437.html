<PRE>                      SECRETS AND LIES
                A film review by Bryant Frazer
                 Copyright 1996 Bryant Frazer</PRE>

         Starring Brenda Bethlyn, Timothy Spall, and Marianne
                                               Jean-Baptiste.

<P>It took me some time to catch up with Secrets and Lies, but I
finally saw it on Thanksgiving Day. The timing could not be
more appropriate, really, since that holiday is most closely
tied in my mind to family gatherings, especially reluctant
ones. Considerations of family are key to Mike Leigh's
much-lauded film, which culminates at a forced family
gathering turned nearly riotous by the presence of brothers,
sisters, in-laws, and strangers.</P>
<P>As the movie begins, a young black Englishwoman named
Hortense is helping bury her adoptive mother. In the
aftermath of the funeral, something inside compels her to
seek out her birth mother. A quick visit to a social worker
nets Hortense her own adoption paperwork (her mother, she
learns, is white), and a few more minutes of research give
her the address of a sad little flat in London's East End.</P>
<P>The resident of that flat is Cynthia Purley (Brenda Bethlyn),
a lonely woman who keeps her home stuffed full of trinkets
from her past, works in a factory, and laments the bitterness
incipient in her 20-year old daughter, Roxanne (Claire
Rushbrook). She's all but lost touch with her beloved
brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall), and his wife, Monica
(Phyllis Logan), when Maurice drops by to invite her and her
daughter to celebrate Roxanne's impending 21st birthday with
a backyard barbecue at his house. Maurice is the comfortably
successful owner of a photography studio, and Cynthia blames
Monica for having shut her out of his life while building a
comfortable, insular home for the two of them.</P>
<P>The mere fact of Maurice's visit is doubtless the highlight
of Cynthia's week, but her excitement is overshadowed by
shock and trepidation when she receives a phone call from
Hortense -- when she realizes she's speaking to the daughter
she tried to leave behind, Cynthia slams the telephone down
in terror. Hortense rings back immediately, intent on meeting
her mother, but Cynthia insists that Hortense must never
visit Cynthia's home or even call her again. Eventually, the
two of them agree to face each other on neutral ground
outside a tube station, and the film's revelatory centerpiece
is the ensuing conversation over tea and the profoundly
disturbing yet liberating effect it has on Cynthia. Before
the film is over, that conversation will prove to have
transformed Cynthia and indeed everyone around her.</P>
<P>Mike Leigh's films give "ensemble cast" an enhanced meaning.
His performers are in on the creative process, riffing on the
material they're given en route to a finished screenplay, and
while Leigh's films are distinctly his own, his characters
and situations ring with a nearly uncanny truth that seems to
indicate the efficiency of this technique. The performances
in Secrets and Lies are remarkable, and only the characters
of Roxanne and her boyfriend Paul ring a little hollow,
perhaps for lack of screen time.</P>
<P>Bethlyn in particular is extraordinary. I was reminded
immediately of Emily Watson's performance in Breaking the
Waves -- another 1996 picture that's utterly reliant on the
abilities of its lead performer to penetrate to the essence
of a character under the camera's intense scrutiny. Bethlyn's
Cynthia is admirable, bold, and pathetic all at once. She
places an emphasis on her character's faded youth without
overstatement and helps Secrets and Lies overcome the more
pedestrian of its urges.</P>
<P>Those urges bubble to the surface in a broth that is the
climactic birthday party. Cynthia has invited Hortense to the
party under the pretense that she's a friend from work. More
inexplicably, Hortense has agreed to come along. I'm not
spoiling anything by telling you that her presence leads to a
dramatic unraveling of some very tightly knotted
personalities -- the interest is in seeing how Leigh gets
them to the breaking point and what happens to these
characters when all hell bursts loose. This screeching,
sobbing kaleidoscope of emotion verges on farce, and I think
Leigh realizes that -- witness the grimace on Paul's face as
he watches the family work through this melodrama.</P>
<P>Mostly, it's a wise and gentle affirmation of our ability to
work through the spitefulness that can spoil a family, and a
catalog of the ways in which we can absolutely fail to
communicate with the people who need us the most. Still, I'm
bothered by the nearly glib tidiness of this resolution. It's
a fairy tale for dysfunctional adults, right down to
Maurice's speechifying at the end -- a diatribe against
mistrust that's already been telegraphed by the movie's
title. Leigh spends the movie setting up these impacted
relationships just to knock 'em down, and I'm afraid that
there's a pat structure here that puts me off in the same way
that Lone Star disappointed me. Certainly Secrets and Lies
lacks the odd narrative and skewed characters that made a
first viewing of Leigh's previous film, Naked, such a
memorable and unpredictable experience.</P>
<P>But don't get me wrong. Secrets and Lies is 99 percent
compelling, beautifully acted, and at times very funny --
through and through, it's one of the best films of the year,
with characters that are both down to earth and much larger
than life. More than anybody, cinephiles everywhere have
Bethlyn to thank for one raging catharsis of a performance
that reveals in a way that mere words, however carefully
scripted, never can.</P>
