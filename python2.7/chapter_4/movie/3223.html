<PRE>                            LEGENDS OF THE FALL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is an old-fashioned epic of an
          early 20th Century Montana ranching family and the
          coming of more urbanized life styles.  An alienated
          father and three very different sons pull in
          different directions.  The film features nice
          photography and a rich score.  Rating: low +3 (-4
          to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Much too rarely seen these days are the big, sprawling historical
epics with beautiful scenery well photographed, and with big brash
scores.  That's what LEGENDS OF THE FALL is.  This is a story of
Montana going through the transition from its more wild frontier past
to so-called civilization.  It is the story of the three sons of a
ranch family: Tristan (Brad Pitt), a wild remnant of the frontier
culture; Alfred (Aidan Quinn), who chooses ties with the coming civic
world; and the young idealist Samuel (Henry Thomas).  The head of the
family is Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins), an alienated and
disillusioned retired cavalry officer who grew to hate all government
after he was ordered to help preside over the destruction of the Plains
Indians.  From his early youth Tristan forms a bond with OneStab
(Gordon Tootoosis), Col. Ludlow's Indian scout who now lives on the
ranch.  OneStab introduces Tristan to Indian mystical ways.  The boys
grow with a seemingly unbreakable bond.  But when Samuel first brings
home a fiancee, Susannah Finncannon (Julia Ormond), then convinces his
other two brothers that the three should enlist to fight in the Great
War breaking out in Europe, he sets in motion a train of events that
were to change completely all the relationships in the family.</P>
<P>     The storytelling is occasionally just a bit rushed and sketchy in
LEGENDS OF THE FALL.  The plot has a lot of territory to cover and
while the film is 134 minutes long, it could easily have made good use
of another half hour or more.  Though the story that formed the basis
was of only novella length when published in ESQUIRE, the film has an
epic sweep.  John Toll's camera work can admire the foothills of
Montana or show the chaos of a battlefield in France with equal grace.
On the other hand, however, there are some noticeable visual mistakes,
including a child of thirteen who when seen three or four years later
still looks like a child of thirteen.  The narrative could have fallen
into melodrama with its fraternal romantic conflicts, but Zwick
generally keeps the story on a higher level.  The one concession to
melodrama that bothers is in Tristan's practicing of Indian ritual,
often in unlikely places like a battlefield in France.</P>
<P>     Following close on the heels of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, we
have a very different sort of role for Brad Pitt.  Considering that in
1992 he was still getting thankless roles like the minor one in COOL
WORLD, his is becoming a major name in films.  While his is the
character of greatest interest, the most demanding role is probably
Aidan Quinn's.  Anthony Hopkins gets second billing, but has a
distinctly secondary role.  An actor of less stature would probably not
gotten second billing for this role as written.</P>
<P>     LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a thoughtful and occasionally powerful epic
film.  It is unusual to see film makers taking a risk on this type of
film any more, but this one deserves to pay off.  I rate it a low +3 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
