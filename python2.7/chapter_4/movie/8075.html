<P>In a recent interview when asked what he did in Men in Black, Tommy Lee
Jones gave a simple answer, "You can't be too cool in this movie." Isn't
that the truth Mr. Jones. And cool he is along with Mr. Smith.</P>
<P>I don't remember laughing so hard and much during any recent movie that
I've seen. Men In Black is an all out sci-fi comedy from Barry Sonnenfeld
(Get Shorty, The Addams Family). There is a story that carries on in Men In
Black, but it's pretty thin. And that's a good thing. For a movie like MIB
there's nothing more annoying than a heavy plot to weight down the movie.
MIB takes from comic roots, and the story seems to be on that line too,
simple and to the point, nothing that gets in the way of the comedy and
special effects. </P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K, who works for the super secret MIB group.
They answer to no one, because government asks too many questions.
Patenting alien technology and selling it here on Earth creates the funds
needed to run the MIB group. The MIB serves as the INS (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) of the universe. They get aliens on Earth, and keep
track of them. Will Smith plays a NYPD cop who is recruited by Agent K to
work for the MIB and he soon becomes Agent J. Smith, who did some alien
hunting in Independence Day, gets more to do in this film. And it is a
well-deserved part for Smith. Together K and J must find a "bug" who has
crash landed here on Earth and is trying to steal a universe in Orion's
Belt. Well, there's the story. Pretty simple, but enough to keep the
audience at bay for just under two hours.</P>
<P>The bug that has crash-landed here on Earth takes over the body of a
farmer, Edgar, played very well by Vincent D'Onofrio. The alien has a hard
time inhabitting Edgar's body, and this is one of the comedy bits that runs
through the movie. Seeing the alien walk around in Edgar's body,
uncomfortable and crowded. The comedy in the movie comes in all forms, some
from J encountering new aliens to aliens who take the bodies of bulldogs.
Tommy Lee Jones, who admits in interviews that he is not a comedic actor,
pulls a great performance out of the hat. His seriousness on the screen
equates to some of the funniest scenes. Will Smith who is a natural comic
does well (again) as an alien-hunter.
The overall production value is noticeable. The aliens are incredibly
detailed, I especially liked the Ambassador alien who lives in a man's
head. This alien is so life like in the movie that it was a
how-did-they-do-that moment. The break-room aliens were also hilarious.
But, these are just a few of the many aliens that inhabit the world of MIB.
And unlike some sci-fi movies where all the aliens are humanoid and speak
English, MIB is populated by aliens who are of all shapes and sizes and
speak their own native languages. The set designs, alien designs, and
costume designs are all well done. From the simple black suits that MIB
agents wear to aliens whose heads regenerate after being shot, the movie
just drips with big, well done production values.</P>
<P>In the worth mentioning section, I have to mention two things. First is the
film score by Danny Elfman. Yet another great movie score by Elfman
(Batman, Mission:Impossible, Nightmare Before Christmas). The music fits so
well with the film that it is hardly noticeable at times. The second thing
that is worth mentioning is the opening sequence that follows a mosquito in
flight for five minutes, during the credits, before an untimely death.</P>
<P>Men In Black is one of those heavily hyped films that doesn't disappoint.
It has a well-balanced blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and
eye-opening-special effects that will appeal to everyone. Go see Men In
Black, you won't be sorry.</P>
