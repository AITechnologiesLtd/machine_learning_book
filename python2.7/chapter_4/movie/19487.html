<PRE>Wild Wild West (PG-13) * 1/2
Starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline
Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Imagine putting both Addams family movies together, adding a heap of sexual
innuendo, and placing the effects of Men in Black on top of it. Now imagine
taking the dry wit out of all these movies, adding an extreme amount of
violence, ethnical slurs, and push-up bras. </P>
<P>Wild Wild West, a new creation of Barry Sonnenfeld, director of Get Shorty and
Men in Black tries to make it work...it doesn't. Exactly whose fault it is is
yet to be determined, so let me just give you an outline. </P>
<P>James West (Smith, who still fits the superhero role nicely, but he's horribly
miscast) is teamed up with effects specialist Artemus Gordon (Kline, who puts
on that fancy-pants know-it-all thing that worked in In & Out, but not here) to
save president Grant from an 80-foot tarantula created by Arliss Loveless
(Kenneth Branagh, who, I'm ashamed to say, should stick with Helena Bonham
Carter and Shakespeare) he's using to take over the entire US government
turning the Northwest into Loveliss Land. </P>
<P>Now this could be an original premise, but the film is so darned contrived that
you know Will Smith will win in the end. Whereas, Arlington Road (a better
action/paranoia thriller by about, oh, ** or *** stars) had a suprising
explosive ending that you couldn't see coming until the very end, this one's
obvious at about the 30-minute point.</P>
<P>I believe that the filmmakers realized this, so they decided to make the film
more fun by adding cool gadgets, heaps of jokes about breasts, tons of violence
(an extreme amount for a PG-13 movie) and racial and ethnic slurs that sound
like their coming from episodes of Jerry Springer and American History X. </P>
<P>This film is not for children and parents should be very cautious about taking
them to it. I actually believe that a child would benefit much more from seeing
South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, Arlington Road, or maybe even American
Pie. Thus, I give Wild Wild West (the worst movie of the year so far along with
Virus) * 1/2 stars.</P>
