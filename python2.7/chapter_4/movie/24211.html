<P>When it comes to submarine movies, the last word will
probably always be director Wolfgang Petersen's 1982
thriller "Das Boot," the story of a World War II German
U-boat's many brushes with disaster during a particularly
perilous mission.</P>
<P>The shadow of Petersen's film hangs heavily over "U-571,"
in which Matthew McConaughey and a group of American
sailors try to evade the enemy after commandeering a Nazi
U-boat. In fact, one key scene - in which the sub has to
dive to a dangerously low level to avoid an oncoming
destroyer - figures prominently in both movies.</P>
<P>In terms of the filmmaking, there's really no point
comparing the two pictures. "Das Boot" has considerably
deeper characterizations, a much creepier mood and more
believable dialogue and relationships. There's not much
time devoted to human interest stories in "U-571," an
unpretentious, no-nonsense suspense film engineered to
provide two hours of excitement. It's not art, and it won't
get a theatrical re-release 20 years from now the way "Das
Boot" recently did. But on its own simple terms, it works
just fine.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Sam Montgomery fictionalizes a 1941
mission by the British navy to capture an Enigma, a
machine that would help the Allies break the secret codes
used by the Germans to send messages. In "U-571," the
time frame has been shifted to the spring of 1942, when
U.S. Navy Lt. Andy Tyler (McConaughey) and his
inexperienced crew are dispatched to a disabled U-boat to
retrieve an Enigma.</P>
<P>Despite the importance of the assignment, Tyler can't help
but be a little distracted as he prepares to leave for it; he
just lost the chance to command his own sub because his
captain (Bill Paxton) wouldn't give him a recommendation
because of Tyler's lack of self-confidence and leadership.</P>
<P>"You have to be able to make hard decisions based on
imperfect information," his commander tells Tyler. "If you're
not willing to make those decisions, without pause, without
reflection, you're not ready to be a submarine captain."</P>
<P>With that kind of a setup, it's a safe bet Tyler will soon be
called upon to display his true mettle. Indeed he is, as he
and several of his men are forced to take over the U-boat
after their own ship is destroyed. Director Jonathan
Mostow (who made the 1997 sleeper "Breakdown")
manages to work up a pretty potent atmosphere of tension
as the crew faces dangers ranging from a bombardment of
depth charges to internal problems stemming from
misreading the sub's instructions (which are, of course, in
German).</P>
<P>In keeping with such other contemporary looks back at
WWII such as "Saving Private Ryan," "U-571" does not
have a bunch of superheroes or archvillains at its center.
Instead, most of the guys feel underqualified for the work
they have to do and they sometimes question Tyler's
orders even while carrying them out. Erik Palladino (Dr.
Dave on "ER") plays the loudest voice of dissent, a pest
who tries to undermine Tyler's authority and finally gets a
sock in the jaw for his trouble.</P>
<P>In his first time out in an action film, McConaughey hits
the right notes of heroism, while Harvey Keitel as a veteran
sea dog and a hard-to-recognize Jon Bon Jovi offer effective
support.</P>
<P>The real stars of "U-571," however, are the special effects
(the subs look considerably more authentic than the ones
in "Das Boot"), Richard Marvin's panicky score and the
truly outstanding sound. This is one movie you really must
see in digital stereo to fully appreciate. The explosions, the
rushing water and the terrifying creaks of metal giving way
are so vivid you can practically feel them, and for many
people that's as good a reason to go to the movies as any.
