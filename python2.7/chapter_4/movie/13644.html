 ***: good picture, sound, and seats]</P>
<P>If there's any genre that could use improvement, the lowbrow screwball comedy
 is it. One does not tend to associate such films with authentic romance,
 intricate plotting, and witty scripting, which are all qualities possessed by
 "There's Something About Mary" that make it a cut above the rest. There's an
 over-all sense of moderation here to make the jokes all the more funnier,
 especially considering how questionable the level of taste is.</P>
<P>The film starts out with a flashback to the mid 1980s, in the suburbs of
 Rhode Island where all comedies involving high school flashbacks might take
 place. The teens all appear to be in their 20s, but it keeps with the
 nostalgic, satirical atmosphere. We're quickly introduced to our main
 characters, Ted (Stiller), a dorky loser who inadvertantly charms the new foxy
 girl Mary (Diaz), after standing up for her retarded brother in a scene so
 generic it's original in its unapologetic approach.</P>
<P>Initially, the film is a little slow to demonstrate its comedic power. The
 atmosphere is rather sitcom-esque, but once the first bout of zaniness is
 unleashed, it's clear this is not going to be zinger-oriented comedy.</P>
<P>The promotions hint at the first major joke and plot device, which involves
 Ted having a painful accident with his zipper. To elaborate on the set-up of
 this joke would be an injustice to the film, but the way this gag is set up
 and the ultimate, hilarious delivery it provides goes to show how such a crude
 joke can be stretched out without snapping. </P>
<P>Ted's injury itself is funny, but the way the other characters react to it is
 the key. Penis jokes are pretty much the lowest of the lowbrow, but the film
 works in such a way as to let the viewer decide how gross the gag is (although
 it's still funny no matter how you see it).</P>
<P>Eventually a plot unfolds involving Ted's modern-day search for Mary. Through
 a series of connections he is put in touch with Pat Healy (Dillon), a slow-
 witted creepy character who fits in perfectly in such a screwball comedy.
 Healy tracks down Mary, who is now an orthopedic surgeon living in Florida,
 still foxy as ever, and still yearning for true love. It's no surprise Healy
 is attracted to her and proceeds to lie to Ted to discourage him from pursuing
 her. Using a bag of tricks James Bond might have thrown away, Healy learns
 everything about Mary. The conversations he is allowed to hear might seem a
 little too convenient to the plot, but the set-ups are funny and interesting
 enough to make them pay off. As Healy spies on Mary, we too feel the sense of
 voyeurism, which of course makes for many jokes and gags, but is something a
 film like this wouldn't usually inspire.</P>
<P>And it is this kind of surprising, subtle charm that gives the film merit.
 It's not meant to be any kind of achievement in film making, but just a good
 comedy which is becoming increasingly difficult to do. It takes the time to
 sketch out the characters - to provide motivation, backstory, and thematic
 elements. None of this is really necessary, as the film could have easily been
 more concentrated on the gags, but the fact it's here at all shows a level of
 maturity. Maturity in the midst of jokes involving slapstick, bodily functions
 and fluids, stupidity, and gross sight gags, but maturity nevertheless.</P>
<P>The entire middle hour can be used to illustrate this concept, as it's not
 just a series of jokes to string together a plot, but a story that constantly
 unfolds new layers without becoming confusing or predictable. New characters
 and minor sub-plots are introduced into the fray as natural transitions of the
 story. For example, another possible suitor for Mary named Tucker (Evans), is
 casually introduced as a supporting character. Gradually we learn he is not
 what he seems, as he too has been victimized by Mary's charm and beauty and
 will stop at nothing to gain the same affection both Ted and Pat Healy are
 striving for. More background material is lain out to give the plot some
 semblance of complexity. The gags and one-liners are plugged in at all the
 right points, but they all push the story just that much further. </P>
<P>Of course the film does get a little sidetracked for the really bizarre
 elements of the comedy. The Farrelly brothers have been known to push the
 envelope, but where as most do so for pure shock value, theirs seem to be
 natural progressions of the story. Somehow an elaborate gag involving
 masturbation provides for the slightest, idiosyncratic insight to the male
 mind. The same can be said for conversations about meat products on sticks and
 cones, or why movies like "Harold And Maude" aren't made anymore. Taken out of
 context this type of comedy might seem typical, but inside the film they work
 well.</P>
<P>Wrapping up zany comedies such as this usually involve a lot of cop-outs,
 sudden revelations, wild action, and predictable endings, and although some of
 these things are present here, the process of putting them together continues
 to highlight the film's subtle hook. As is most of the film, it's generic and
 off-the-wall, and yet funny and charming.</P>
<P>My only major grievance with "There's Something About Mary" might be the fact
 it's not as funny as it could have been, but that's because there's a sense of
 continuity and thoroughness here - something a lot of other movies could take
 a cue from.</P>
