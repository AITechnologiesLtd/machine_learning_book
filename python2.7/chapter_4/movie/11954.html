<PRE>TWELVE MONKEYS
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1994
Directed by Terry Gilliam. Written by David and Janet Peoples.
Starring Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt. </PRE>
<P>"5 billion people will die from a deadly virus in 1997. The survivors will
abandon the surface of the planet. Once again the animals will rule the world
. . ."
-Excerpts from interview with clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic,
April 12, 1990 - Baltimore County Hospital </P>
<P>With this caption begins TWELVE MONKEYS, the most recent of director Terry
Gilliam's many excursions into the realm where reality and fantasy often seem
to intersect, overlap, and sometimes collide head-first. This time, the
vehicle for his protagonist's confusion is time travel. The year is 2035 and
the last of the human race have been driven underground by a dangerous plague
unleashed, apparently, by a terrorist group known as the Army of the Twelve
Monkeys. Seeking to develop an inoculation and reclaim the surface, a group of
scientists decide to send a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis) back to
the year 1996 in order to collect samples of the virus in its original,
un-mutated form from before it was released on the population. </P>
<P>The script was penned by David Peoples (of BLADE RUNNER fame) and his wife
Janet, and with the help of Gilliam (BRAZIL, THE FISHER KING), one of the most
accomplished fantasy directors in modern cinema, they take the issue of time
travel and explore it, far-fetched as it may seem, in an intelligent and
thoughtful manner. One avenue that the script takes is to examine the
practical uses of time travel and the problems that time travelers might
encounter. The famous physicist Stephen Hawking once commented that time
travel will probably never be invented for the reason that we, in the present
day, are not being visited by time travelers from the future. After seeing
TWELVE MONKEYS, I found myself speculating that if we were, they might all be
locked away in mental institutions, for this is Cole's fate on his first
journey to the past. TWELVE MONKEYS also follows a different route than the
usual return-to-the-past-to-change-the-present routine that is common to
science fiction movies (and often results in a story riddled with paradoxes).
Cole is not trying to avert the spread of the virus, and he even says as much
when he confronts the man who he believes is responsible for its release: all
he is trying to find is a sample. </P>
<P>TWELVE MONKEYS is divided neatly into three acts. In the first, Cole is
mistakenly sent to Baltimore in 1990 instead of 1996, where he is immediately
taken into police custody and diagnosed as delusional by Dr. Katherine Railly
(Madeline Stowe). The resulting scenes at the mental institution, in which a
hyperactive patient named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) constantly stirs up
trouble and seems to allude vaguely to the impending disaster, are at once
amusing and eerie, capturing Cole's strange experience of being immersed in
human civilization at a time that he knows is only six years before its
destruction. </P>
<P>He is subsequently recalled to 2035, where he explains the malfunction to the
scientists, who, this time, manage to send him to 1996 as planned. Desperate
to complete his mission, he seeks help from Dr. Railly, who now works in
Philadelphia; although she is frightened by him at first and tries to convince
him that he is still "mentally divergent," she gradually begins to trust him
after some of his predictions about the future seem to come true. These scenes
are marked by a sort of innocent abandon on the part of Cole, who, for the
first time since his childhood, finds himself able to enjoy things like music,
open air, and streams in the forest. </P>
<P>In the final act, after another recall to the future, Cole returns once again
to 1996 Philadelphia, this time only three weeks before the unleashing of the
virus. Once again, he seeks out Railly, who is now beginning to believe his
story (just as he himself is beginning to think that he may be delusional
after all), as the two of them realize the trust and attraction that had been
growing between them and begin to wonder if the disaster really is just around
the corner and whether or not the Army of the Twelve Monkeys are the real
culprits. Meanwhile, Cole ponders the meaning of a recurring dream which
echoes an experience from his childhood, in which he sees a man shot by an
airport security guard as a woman calls after him. It's never clear exactly
what is coming next in TWELVE MONKEYS, but the twists in
plot and character, however intricate and complex, never seem contrived or
phony: the script flows naturally, especially for a fantasy film, and the way
in which Cole's dream finally fits into the big picture is both logical and
quite poignant. </P>
<P>Gilliam's vision of both present and future is about as bleak as they come.
What we see of human society in 2035 seems devoid of any vitality and is
instead surviving by nothing more than a sort of plodding inertia under a
vaguely authoritarian structure (the scientists "volunteer" Cole for their
experiments against his will, and among his criminal charges are violations of
the "Permanent Emergency Code"). The present doesn't fare much better, from
the dilapidated, chaotic Baltimore mental hospital to urban Philadelphia,
where Cole and Railly encounter violent thugs in abandoned buildings,
countless homeless people inhabiting the run-down streets, walls covered with
graffiti, and a strange man who assaults them and claims that their hotel room
is his "territory." One gets the feeling that, had a lethal virus not been
unleashed into this society three weeks later, it might have eaten itself
alive in a few more years anyway. </P>
<P>Still, TWELVE MONKEYS does not insist on fear and despair to the exclusion of
everything else: even in the face of the present and future (or, from his
view, past and present) horrors he has witnessed, Cole's enjoyment of the
simple things like the open air or a pleasant song on the radio is honest and
genuinely innocent. One of the best scenes comes near the end, when, for a
reason I won't reveal here, a group of wild animals escape the zoo and run
across buildings and freeways: it's sort of like the last gasp of humor and
amusement before the impending onslaught of the virus. Aside from general fear
and confusion, this is probably the most pervasive emotional motif in the
film: the beauty of these simple things, even in the face of pervasive
insanity and destruction. Perhaps the strongest testimony to this is that
towards the end, Cole actually begins to hope that he is delusional, because
he and Railly might have a future together in this world and in the absence of
the virus. </P>
<P>If there's anything wrong with TWELVE MONKEYS, it's that it tries to do a few
too many things at once. The question of how society decides someone is insane
is raised several times, but Gilliam and the screenwriters seem to have
forgotten about it by the end: nowhere in the last half hour or so is it even
acknowledged. Similarly, the way the script leaves it ambiguous as to whether
or not the film's events are real or are taking place in Cole's imagination
amounts to little more than a distraction. The film would have worked
perfectly well as a drama with a science fiction backdrop without introducing
the possibility of an unreliable first-person viewpoint. Gilliam is a talented
director, but even he seems to find his hands full when trying to do science
fiction, drama, mystery, romance, and satire all at once. </P>
<P>Whatever its minor flaws, the film is sophisticated and poignant and surely
deserves to be remembered as a science fiction classic - no less than what one
would expect when the creative minds behind BRAZIL and BLADE RUNNER join
forces. I can't quite give it four stars, but I can say this: TWELVE MONKEYS
is probably the best 3-1/2 star film I have ever seen. </P>
