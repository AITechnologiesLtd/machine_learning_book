<P>_East_Is_East_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Children rebelling against strict parents is common comedic fodder on
television and the big screen, so it's a tribute to the makers of this
British comedy that an idea as familiar as that is made fresh.  Part of
that has to do with the point of view, which is from an Anglo-Pakistani
family, the Khans, in '70s Britain.  The seven children born to Pakistani
George (Om Puri) and the British Ella (Linda Bassett) want to be ordinary
products of their turbulent times, but George insists on nothing less
than a traditionalist upbringing for his kids, including arranged
marriages for all of his sons.  The lengths to which George--who is a big
hypocrite, considering he's married to an Anglo woman, who is his second
wife, no less--comes to assert his power over his family are monstrous,
but Puri's performance adds an invaluable layer of vulnerability.  Puri
makes one believe that he really does love his family and wants the best
for them; it's just that he refuses to see any beliefs other than his own
as being so.</P>
<P>While there is serious grit to its story, _East_Is_East_, adapted from
Ayub Khan-Din's play by director Damien O'Donnell and Khan-Din himself,
is foremost a comedy, and there are plenty of laughs to be had from
various domestic situations, culminating in one raucous climax.  It's a
credit to O'Donnell that the comedy not only doesn't cheapen the serious
issues addressed in Khan-Din's story but that it feels like an integral
part of the bigger picture.  As a result, _East_Is_East_ is one of the
rare films that gets to have the best of both worlds: hit serious and
true emotional buttons while delivering a genuinely fun time.</P>
