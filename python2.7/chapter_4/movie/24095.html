<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<PRE>Frequency (2000) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Gregory Hoblit
Written by Noah Emmerich</PRE>
<P>Starring Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Elizabeth
Mitchell, Andre Braugher, and Noah Emmerich.</P>
<P>Frequency n., The number of times a specified
phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the
number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values
of a periodic function per unit variation of an
independent variable…etc</P>
<P>Don't worry. When watching the thriller Frequency, you
won't have to know what the heck frequency means. The
premise, although it may sound complex, is very basic
on the big screen. A New York cop, John, (Jim
Caviezel) finds a radio in his house, which allows him
to communicate with his New York firefighter father,
Frank, (Dennis Quaid) who died thirty years ago.
Immediately John warns his father that he will die
trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse. When
Frank takes his advice and survives the accident he
wasn't supposed to, the two eventually realize that by
changing that one moment in the past, they have
created a whole new future in which a serial killer
murders John's mother and nine other women. It is now
up to John and Frank to use their special connection
and save thirty years ago to make present time a
better place. (I told you that wasn't confusing…).  </P>
<P>Overall, I was very pleased with Frequency. It's
occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with
its suspenseful serial killer scenes. I usually don't
buy those cheesy "I love you dad" segments in movies,
but this one surprisingly satisfied me. Maybe because
the plot is so creative and universal that I believed
that this is how most people would act when talking to
a dead relative. Frequency's creepy premise left me
thinking once the film ended, what if? What would I
do? Would I help my own family or save a historical
figure from being assasinated? Or stop some kids from
shooting other kids? Or buy stock from Yahoo!? (a
character in the film does the latter with humorous
consequences). </P>
<P>Frequency also reminded me of the fantastic Back to
the Future. Both share that "change the past slightly,
and you'll change the future heavily" warning. The
changes between the present and the past, such as
different newspaper headlines or people disappearing
and reappearing in photographs, are very similar. Both
are also wonderful feel-good family films that can
attract to a number of generations. The only
difference worth noting is that Frequency's final
scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative
sequel already in the making. </P>
<P>There are some problems with the film though. First,
there is a major flaw in the story towards the end
that is somewhat distracting (Email me if you have
seen the movie and want to know what I think it is).
The plot must have confused even the filmmakers who
frequently (no pun intended) switch from 1969 to 1999
while telling the story. Another problem is that the
supporting cast, including Noah Emmerich and Andre
Braugher, are underused. While in the film, which is
not enough, the aforementioned actors steal every
scene they are in.</P>
<P>Frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the
audience I saw it with who cheered at the end. Even if
you know what is going to happen or if you think the
preview ruined the movie for you, like it almost did
for me, check this movie out. You may be surprised as
well.</P>
