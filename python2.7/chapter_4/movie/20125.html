<P>Pioneered by Danish enfant terrible Lars Von Trier, the Dogma
manifesto represents a back to basics style of film making.  The
manifesto stipulates that films made under its guidelines are truly
collaborative efforts, without individual recognition or credit given
to cast and crew.  Under this code of practice, films are shot on
location using hand held cameras and natural lighting, and attempt to
draw out the natural emotional elements of a specific scenario rather
than rely on artificially created action.  The Idiots (Idioterne) is
the first film produced under this manifesto to reach Australian
screens, and it is something of an eye opener.</P>
<P>The Idiots is a challenging, provocative and outrageous film
about a group of middle class friends who "spass" - pretend to be
mentally handicapped in public places.  Spassing allows them to get
free meals from restaurants and enables them to get away with
behaviour that would normally be greeted with condemnation.  People
are prepared to tolerate and accept certain standards of behaviour,
and make allowances for the handicapped, but this group callously
trade on their generosity and faith.  The group live in a communal
arrangement in the house owned by Stoffer's uncle.  The loosely
structured plot follows them through a number of public encounters - a
factory tour, a swimming lesson, a meeting with a couple of bikies -
and explores the hypocrisy of society when it comes to dealing with
mental illness.  There are some hilarious sequences throughout, but
there is also an uncomfortably vicious tone to some of the group's
antics.  In one scene, Stoffer introduces his friends to some
potential buyers who have come to check out his uncle's house.  While
the couple profess to be comfortable with their handicaps, they can't
wait to get away.</P>
<P>The lonely and troubled Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) briefly joins
the group, and finds solace and escape from the harsh reality of her
life.  But slowly the group begins to fall apart as their spassing
gets out of control.  The Idiots explores the dynamics of group
behaviour, and depicts how the selfish actions of one person can
impact on the harmony and unity of the rest.</P>
<P>The film's content may well offend many in the audience, but
one suspects this is what Von Trier deliberately set out to achieve.
Some eight seconds worth of footage have been deleted from the
climactic orgy scene.  Von Trier has always been a provocative and
challenging director, but here he is also pushing aesthetic and
ethical boundaries to the limit.  With its naturalistic,
quasi-documentary style, Von Trier also seems to be deliberately
turning his back on those earlier stylish films that established his
reputation as one of Europe's finest and most inventive young
directors (Europa, etc).  Some scenes seem improvised, and the
performances are natural and spontaneous.  There is something of an
amateurish look to the film as boom microphones keep dropping into the
shot, and crew members can be seen walking around in the background on
several occasions.  The jerky, hand held camera movements and the
fuzzy, out of focus shots eventually become irritating.  Ultimately,
this style of cinema verite becomes an artifice rather than a genuine
advance in cinematic technique.</P>
<P>Von Trier gives The Idiots a sort of warts-and-all
documentary-style feels, as he features talking heads interviews with
the principal characters to disguise the technical blemishes.</P>
<P>Brimming with contentious ideas, The Idiots offers a
challenging time at the cinema that many within the audience will not
feel entirely comfortable with.  The film will certainly polarise
audiences, and many may not last the distance.  While The Idiots lacks
the raw emotional power of Von Trier's Breaking The Waves, it will
still move audiences in other ways.</P>
