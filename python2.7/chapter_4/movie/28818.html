<P>   Lake Tahoe is known to Americans as a vacation spot, a place
to escape from urban summer heat in the California Sierras--
fairly isolated but near enough to Reno's excitement.  There are,
however, people who live there the year-'round, folks who'd
make most of us envious for their proximity to the turquoise-clear
lake that gives the area its name but which, underneath the
shimmering surface, is frigid and uninviting.  In "The Deep End,"
Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton), a year-'round resident, is by
contrast chilly on the outside but  deep down, craves something
more than what she's getting.  She is lonely despite the presence
of an aging father-in-law and three fairly decent kids.  Her
husband is a naval officer who is not often home.  She's the type
of woman whose pallid features announce her submission as a
mom who is busy enough escorting her young daughter Paige
(Tamara Hope) to ballet class, driving her teen son Beau
(Jonathan Tucker) to trumpet practice, and keeping the little one,
Dylan (Jordan Dorrance) out of mischief.  The adventure that
changes this domestic scenario, a tragic chain of events that, I'd
imagine, she almost welcomes, supplies the noirish, if
melodramatic, texture of a film--one which garnered for lenser
Giles Nuttgens the Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance
Film Festival.</P>
<P>   Filmed mostly on location in Lake Tahoe, "The Deep End" is
both directed and written by Scott McGehee and David Siegel,
who updated the 1940's melodramatic novel of Elisabeth Sanxay
Holding fittingly to appeal to an audience in our less innocent
time.  Its chief merit is its repudiation of a Hollywood stereotype:
One of the villains is not a mean guy after all.  Though
handsome, George-Clooney-like Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic),
wants money, we see from the start that he's a guy with heart,
someone who both alerts Margaret to her forlorn condition and
even saves the life of her deadly-dull, annoying, live-in father-in-
law Jack Hall (Peter Donat).</P>
<P>   "The Deep End" opens with a visit by Margaret to a shady
friend of her teen son, Darby Reese (Josh Lucas), with an urgent
request that the 30-year-old man--whom she rightly considers a
bad influence--stay away from the lad.  She's ignored, of course,
and when her son accidentally kills Darby, she covers for her boy
and is in turn blackmailed by Alek--who is under the thumb of a
senior blackmailer and really bad-guy villain, Carlie Nagle
(Raymond J. Barry).  As the film progresses at a lingering pace,
McGehee and Siegel gradually up the suspense ante,
juxtaposing what starts as a conventional murder-cum-blackmail
melo with an unusual romantic twist.  Aptly named "The Deep
End," the story is fixated with water--the slowly dripping faucet in
the Hall residence, the burial spot for a victim of accidental
murder, above all a metaphor for Margaret's existential condition
as a woman who is figuratively underwaterall the time.</P>
<P>   Tilda Swinton, astonishing in her role as a cross-gender, trans-
century woman in "Orlando," is more than proficient in a down-to-
earth capacity, having an adventure in a single area during a
period of just a few days--a woman whose iciness is slowly
chipping under the influence of a dashing bandit.  Though
Scottish and sporting a British accent, she integrates herself well
into an all-American community and makes the entire story not
only exceptionally watchable but believably suspenseful.</P>
