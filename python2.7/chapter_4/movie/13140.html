<P>   At the beginning of a 10-round prizefight, two
contenders come out and touch gloves as a sign that they
don't really mean each other harm: it's just part of the game. 
Then they pummel each other as though to belie their act of
camaraderie.  By the end of round 5, one guy's eye is virtually
closed, the other is bleeding from the nose.  The crowd
cheers.  What would happen if, before coming out for the
sixth round, each fighter called a half-hour time out and both
existed for the nearest luncheonette for a cappuccino and a
chat? "How's your little baby doing?" says one, while the other
responds, "Is your mother OK after her surgery?"  Would they
still have the same fight in them when they returned to the
ring?  Hardly.</P>
<P>   This is the premise of "Out of Sight," a crime story mined
by novelist Elmore Leonard--also known for "Get Shorty"--for
comic resonance.  It's a metaphoric boxing match between a
charming bank robber and a beautiful federal marshall who is
chasing him and rounds up getting pursued instead.  He, Jack
Foley (George Clooney), has just broken out of prison where
he is serving a thirty-year sentence; she, Karen Sisco, is a
federal cop who can get a jump on her career by bringing him
in but is hindered by her romantic feeling for him.  As the
novelist states, "Like if she were to make a T with her two
hands, calling for a time-out....It would be okay then to say hi,
how're you doing?  They stand there talking, polite to each
other.  He might say something about her shooting at him and
she'd say heah, well, you know....You have time for a
drink?...The next time she saw him, she'd cuff his hands
behind his back and take him in."</P>
<P>   Director Steven Soderbergh, known for spare statements as
in his celebrated "...sex, lies, and videotape," and for the dry
humor of that great monologue, "Gray's Anatomy," helms
against type by finding a broadly comic tone in this movie
version of "Out of Sight."  Filmed in bold color by veteran
Soderbergh cinematographer Elliot Davis, the film comes right
to the point by opening without credits on a bank robbery that
that is so smooth and confident that you need not wonder that
the perp is a veteran of 200 such escapades.  Caught when
his car would not start, he is given a 30-year jail sentence as
a incorrigible criminal, then manages to break out--but not
without interference from federal marshall Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez), who happens to be on the scene.  Sisco is
overpowered and, in the key scene, is tossed into the trunk of
a getaway car together with Foley.  Their conversation
proceeds like anyone's dream first-date, leading to instant
Stockholm syndrome.  The two are in love, an unlikely pairing
which provides much of the comic impact of this delightful
caper movie.</P>
<P>   A good deal of the story is centered on the way both Foley
and Sisco live in anticipation of their next meeting.  As with
any good romance film,  a great deal is put in the way of their
getting together, not the least being that she is obligated to
bring Foley in while he needs both to avoid her and to
consummate his attraction.  Soderbergh films with striking
hyperrealism in one scene, as Foley and Sisco get together
for a romantic interlude in a dazzling night club and, as they
converse they fantasy the inevitable conclusion to the
evening's dalliance.  Soderbergh also makes Elmore
Leonard's novel cinematic by use of flashbacks, frequently
dashing from some of Anne V. Coates's briskly edited scenes
to incidents involving Foley's stay in the Florida prison.</P>
<P>   For George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, "Out of Sight"
stands as their best work.  Clooney has lost his signature
cocked-head, smiling mannerisms while Lopez, who
substitutes for the blond agent of the book, conveys her
conflict with every move.  In the convincing and jocose side
roles, Dennis Farina portrays Karen's understanding dad,
Steve Zahn a drug addict who talks too much, Albert Brooks a
multimillionaire jailed for insider trading who confides too
readily in his jailmates, and best of all Ving Rhames as
Buddy, famous for confessing his crimes to his sister who
promptly turns him in each time.  Gary Frutkoff's production
design dazzles, particularly in his conception of a night club
on a snowy night that makes Detroit look like Davos.</P>
