rating)</P>
<P>The best film around these days may well be the 27-year old "The Garden of
the Finzi-Continis,"  re-released in a beautifully restored print, with
updated sound. It was made by Vittorio De Sica, one of a handful of masters
of neorealism, the Italian "movement" (in subjects and style) that appeared
during World War II and widened incalculably the scope of film.</P>
<P>"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis"" won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1971
and a slew of other honors. It was said to be De Sica's comeback, but he
had really never gone away. There was and still is a general misconception
that De Sica's star waned after 1953.</P>
<P>There have been so many misapprehensions and hasty judgments about De Sica
that a short evaluation is in order.</P>
<PRE>===========THE FILM  REVIEW PROPER CONTINUES AFTER THIS SECTION==========</PRE>
<P>De Sica started his career as a stage performer. He soon became very
popular. He then became also a film actor. From the early 1930s on he was
idolized in Italy by the public and the critics. As in the Fascist period
the once-great Italian cinema had declined enormously, it is safe to say
that De Sica's presence salvaged a big percentage of the 20 or so films he
appeared in during the Mussolini era. Some years ago, a retrospective of
Italian movies of that era at the Pesaro Festival  proved beyond question
the importance of De Sica as an actor.</P>
<P>He began directing films in 1939, with good results right away, notably
"The Children Are Watching Us" (1942). Soon his lifelong collaborator was
Cesare Zavattini. Arguably the best of Italian scriptwriters, he worked on
practically all of De Sica's movies. In 1946 began the director's golden
neorealist period, with classics like "Shoeshine,"" Bicycle Thieves,""
Miracle in Milan, and "Umberto D."</P>
<P>Between 1953 and 1963 he directed eight films and a very good episode in
the omnibus "Boccaccio 70."  "Indiscretion of an American Wife" (Stazione
Termini) (1953) has its virtues but was hampered by the tug between the
director and the producer, and its original release print cut down to 63
minutes. Next, De Sica showed that he had a talent for comedy in the
excellent "The Gold of Naples." "The Roof" is a touching return to
neorealism. "The Last Judgment," unknown in the US and little-known
elsewhere, is very good. The realistic, gripping "Two Women" is a superb
drama which won Sophia Loren an Oscar. Two more features, "Anna from
Brooklyn" and "Il Boom," hardly  circulated in the States, if at all. And I
cannot remember clearly "The Condemned of Altona" to give an opinion.</P>
<P>Then came in 1964 the very colorful, funny yet touching "Marriage Italian
Style" with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. It won a 1964 Oscar
nomination for Loren, and (oddly, in 1965) the nomination for Best Foreign
Film, while De Sica's "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," also with
Loren-Mastroianni, won the 1964 Oscar  for Best Foreign Film.</P>
<P>Even those movies that, for some viewers, seemed  beneath what they
expected of De Sica, have more than a few flashes of brilliance. This was
confirmed a few years back during a major  De Sica retrospective at my
favorite film festival, in La Rochelle (France). (La Rochelle has
repeatedly opened our eyes to other "auteurs," whether unknowm,
little-known , neglected or misunderstood.)</P>
<P>After his Oscar triumphs, De Sica, driven by his need of money, made six
(or parts thereof) commercial films in so many years. Three of them, "A
Young World," "The Witches" may be unknown in America.  "After the Fox" and
"Woman Times Seven," are underrated. The very commercial "A Place for
Lovers" (Mastroianni and Faye Dunaway " and "Sunflower" (Mastroianni-Loren)
are admittedly duds.</P>
<P>A second comeback followed with "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis." Finally
came his last three works, one good, two excellent, all of a serious nature
"A Brief Vacation," "We'll Name Him Andrea" (1972) --sadly not seen in
America--and "The Voyage" (1973).</P>
<P>Throughout his life De Sica continued to play in several films. Most were
by others. Some he directed himself but he hardly appeared in any of his
top works. By my count he was in at least 74 movies, probably more. Both
his accepting roles and directing some pictures stemmed from his perpetual
need of money. He was a compulsive gambler who kept losing fortunes. In the
early 1970s I once sat not far from him in a casino. It was a sad sight.</P>
<PRE>====================    REVIEW  RESUMES ===============</PRE>
<P>"The Garden" chronicles the years 1938-1943 fitfully and with some clear
flashbacks (but has none of the customary dating of World War II's
developments), around a wealthy, cultivated and aristocratic Jewish family
in Ferrara. Their large, walled-in estate and mansion, open to friends and
family, become a gilded ghetto when Mussolini  starts his anti-Semitic
decrees. At first it's like an avoidance reaction: stay apart and things
may improve. This is not stupidity. Jews in other countries were clinging
to similar hopes. After all, in places like Germany or Italy so many of
them were totally assimilated and respected that it was inconceivable that
patriotic people (many had fought bravely for their country in the Great
War ) would be treated savagely.</P>
<P>But the measures get nastier: exclusion from clubs, no military service for
Jews, no phone directory listings, no obituaries in papers, no non-Jewish
servants, no going to schools or public libraries and other places, etc.
And World War II is looming. Says main character Giorgio, a son in another
Jewish family: "The war will be even harder for us -- the Negroes."</P>
<P>Giorgio's parents are well-to-do Ferrarans. His father is a proud Fascist
--until he sees the light. For ten years, Giorgio and the Finzi-Contini
daughter Micol, have been best friends. Now grown-up, Giorgio has an
unrequited passion for the girl. She would like to keep the camaraderie but
love is out of the question. Is there another man? Does cool, elusive,
self-possessed Micol have an incestuous relationship (whether in thought or
in deed) with her beloved, terminally  ill brother Alberto? Is he
homosexual? Is it by chance that Micol is reading Jean Cocteau ("he is
chic") who deals with both gayness and incest?</P>
<P>The film weaves with skill and pertinence its various elements, reactions,
personal relations. Discrimination is mostly dealt with in a low-key
fashion, without the shown or verbally described physical brutality of most
Holocaust pictures. There are questions and ambivalences yet the whole
remains lucid. A major role held by Malnate -- Giorgio's best male friend,
a Communist and a non-Jew -- adds veracity and complexity to the story.</P>
<P>The Fascists' anti-Semitic measures may not have been anything like the
Nazi ones, and were disapproved by a large number of Italians, but they did
exist. There was no deportation of the magnitude in other countries. For
example, in Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, were
concentrated most of the Jews of the country,  in a community of at least
60,000. During the Occupation of Greece in World War II, the Nazis deported
all of Thessaloniki's Jews to death camps from which an infinitesimally
small  fraction returned. (Of the few thousands of other Jews living
elsewhere in Greece, some, warned by the Thessaloniki disaster, managed to
hide. Still, many others were sent to death camps).</P>
<P>But then, the horror of persecution both is and is not a matter of numbers.
The focus on the Finzi-Continis makes it come terribly alive. Even if the
people in authority, as they herd off the victims, keep saying "Prego"
(Please).</P>
<P>Without symbolic obviousness, the film contrasts intelligently changes of
seasons, the beauty of nature, young people or old buildings, with the
ugliness of the events. Ferrara is not a studio set but the real city. The
performers are, in neo-realist fashion, mostly non-professionals except for
the headliners: Austrian-born Helmut Berger; the first-rate Lino
Capolicchio and Romolo Valli;  and Parisian Dominique Sanda. She had
already made her mark in three films : by Robert Bresson, Maximilian Schell
and especially in Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Conformist."  The latter plus
"The Garden" made her a major star.</P>
<P>This is a film without audience manipulation or pulling of heart-strings.
The actors are surprisingly "un-Italian" by not engaging into big, overt
emotions, not to mention that wonderful Italian theatricality that would
have been out of place here. There are no heroes. We watch the protagonists
with their strengths and weaknesses in an almost cerebral fashion as we do
the senior, dignified Finns-Contini members. Yet emotion gradually builds
up, climaxing with the final off-screen singing of a heart-breaking
Kaddish, the Prayer for the Dead.</P>
