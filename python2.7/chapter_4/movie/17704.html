<PRE>                              THE MATRIX
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: What a mixed bag!  This is a film
          with great ideas, beautiful visuals, terrific
          martial arts, and concepts that tie reality in
          knots.  It also has incredibly thin characters and
          long sections where the plot does not advance
          beyond who is kicking, shooting, or blowing up
          whom.  The storytelling is totally muddled.  But
          for the characters and the plot this would be a
          great film.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
          +4).  Note: Every effort was made to keep this
          review spoiler-free.</PRE>
<P>     THE MATRIX is a tough film to review for many different reasons.
In the first place, what can one say about the basic concept without
revealing too much?  The entire premise of the film is something of a
surprise.  I will say that it is fair to say that things are not as
they seem at the beginning of the film, but saying anything more than
that about the premise could conceivably damage the viewer's enjoyment
of the film.  In this story the actuality is really very different from
being what it seems to be.  Philip K. Dick would have been right at
home in THE MATRIX with his frequent stories of reality being turned
inside out.  I believe there was an episode of the newer series of THE
TWILIGHT ZONE on this concept, but this is its first treatment in
detail in a feature-length film.</P>
<P>     Neo, the main character (played by Keanu Reaves), has this gut
feeling that there is something different that is going on beyond with
everybody seems to know.  It is something VERY different.  Neo wakes up
one morning with a phone call from the mysterious Trinity (Carrie
Anne-Moss) Trinity seems to be something like a hacker with what
frequently look like magical powers--powers like an ability jump
amazing distances.  Trinity takes her orders from someone even more
elusive and mysterious, the nearly omniscient super-hacker Morpheus
(Laurence Fishburne).  The government is trying to track down the
hackers Trinity and Morpheus, and sends to recruit Neo some agents who
look a lot like the title characters in MEN IN BLACK.  Neo is given the
choice of helping to capture Morpheus or of being enslaved by strange
forces.  Soon it is not clear to Neo what is real and what is in his
dreams.  But when he throws in his lot with Morpheus and Trinity,
things become even stranger.  And then they become a lot stranger
still.</P>
<P>     THE MATRIX is written and directed by brothers Andy and Larry
Wachowski who previously demonstrated that they could write and direct
a nice compact and tightly plotted thriller with BOUND.  There is,
sadly, little that is compact or tightly plotted about THE MATRIX.
This is a film just chock full of martial arts fights, shootouts, and
bomb explosions.  But the Wachowskis spend very little screen time
fleshing out their main characters or getting us to care too much what
happens to them.  We know they stand between the world and some really
nasty fate.  Presumably if they lose, the people in the audience lose
also.  But that is not the same thing as making us really care if these
people live or die. Keanu Reeves sees to be is a sort of stupor through
much of the film.  That is not unrealistic considering the
circumstances but it certainly kills his empathy value.  The characters
get themselves in and out of danger without ever creating dramatic
tension.</P>
<P>     Somehow in BOUND the Wachowski Brothers did a much better job of
getting the audience to identify with their primary characters.
Unfortunately, the two brothers were far more concerned about the look
of the film than about making the audience empathize with Trinity or
Neo or even Morpheus.  This film shows the main characters getting lots
of action, having lots of fights, but never giving us any reason to
care who wins and who loses those fights.</P>
<P>     The exquisite look of the film, frequently variations in visual
themes of blacks and reds, is created by cinematographer Bill Pope, who
previously filmed DARKMAN, ARMY OF DARKNESS, CLUELESS, and BOUND.
Perhaps part of Pope's inspiration was the noir-ish world of DARK CITY.
His photography nicely shows off the stunts and martial arts work of
Hong Kong director Wu-ping Yuen, here just a stunt coordinator and a
martial arts instructor. But all too often Yuen seems to be soaking up
screen time.  It seems a pity that this film has such an audacious
concept and ends up with so many fights that could have been taken from
any simple police procedural plot.  It is a little insulting to the
audience to present some of the more interesting ideas and then to
treat them on such a superficial level, almost as if the script did not
realize how good its own ideas were.  THE MATRIX could have done so
much more to engage the intellect and not simply a gut reaction.</P>
<P>     When there was so much potential for an intelligent story here the
Wachowski Brothers have opted to spend most of their screen time on
mindless action.  This is a good martial arts film and action film in a
world already overflowing with martial arts and action films.  It
should please the vast bulk of the audience who want to see it Friday
night, have a good time, and have forgotten about it by Saturday
morning.  Those who would want an intelligent and thoughtful piece of
science fiction will be more tantalized and frustrated than gratified.
I rate THE MATRIX a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
