<P>TV-Style-One-Line-Summary 
-------------------------
     An angel experiences life on earth and finds that things are
better (and worse) than expected.</P>
<P>Tak Summary
-----------
     The movie starts out with our hero, and another angel, popping
about time and space to observe whatever catches their fancy.  Unable
to stand by and witness a tragedy about to happen, one of the angels is
unexpectedly cast into human form.</P>
<P>     Thus begins his adventures--he wanders aimlessly, becomes
homeless, joins a band of similarly "fallen" angels, works for a
gangster, and then tries to make a difference.  Throughout his
adventures, the Devil (William Dafoe) ensures he has a really hard time
and gets some of the more dubious human experiences.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     I saw this movie by accident.  Seriously.  I was at a screening of
BAD BEHAVIOR, a comedy, which started late.  By the end of the movie a
small crowd was waiting to get into the preview theatre ... so I just
stayed seated.  I had *no* idea what I was getting into.</P>
<P>     So picture my surprise when the movie opens in grainy black and
white with a French narration and subtitles.  Do you remember that beer
commercial?  It goes something like this:</P>
<P>    [bored guys and dates watching a clown speaking anguished French]</P>
<PRE>    "Why do foreign film have to be so ... foreign?"</PRE>
<P>    [another night--movie w/explosions & gunfire ... now dates bored]</P>
<PRE>    "Why ask why?"</PRE>
<P>     Well, the first fifteen to twenty minutes mins of this film seemed
like the anguished-clown foreign film clip.  Our hero and his companion
move around space and time (within a few generations), philosophically
musing to us (in French, with subtitles) about life, death, and what it
might be like to be a human.  Ei Yi Eee.</P>
<P>     Okay, so I think I'm identifying more with the guys in that
commercial ... I like guns, bullets, adventure and whatnot.  Hell, I
saw CLIFFHANGER twice and *loved* it.</P>
<P>     But just before my patience wore uncomfortably time, our hero is
thrust into a human body, and then all sorts of fun stuff happens.
Eventually we get to see some limited gun-fu, mobsters, a hare-brained
con involving "Columbo," and some extensive acrobatics (I always
suspected those acrobatic people were a little, well, different).</P>
<P>     Okay, on to the subtitles. *Weird*, but neat.  The characters are
speaking French at first.  As the cast expands, they include German,
then English, dropping the subtitles only when English is spoken.</P>
<P>     As the film rolls on, they start mixing the languages ... French,
German, English, all kinds of things--*in the same sentence*!  And I
didn't even notice at first!  It posed absolutely no problem to my
understanding of the dialogue.  Now, admittedly I took a two years of
high school German (mainly so I could understand what the extras were
saying in the war movies I was into at the time--RAIDERS OF THE LOST
ARK is a good case), but I felt as if I could understand anyone, no
matter what language they happened to be speaking.  'Twas a neat
feeling.  If you see this movie, watch for this effect.</P>
<P>     The movie had lots of little subplots, almost too many. Most
everything is wrapped up at the end. But I was left with a vague sense
that something, somewhere, was skimmed over, rushed past us, or left
unfinished.  But I'll be damned if I can remember what.  This seems to
be a characteristic of Wim Wenders stuff.  I had a similar feeling with
UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD.  Apparently, he loves to explore lots of
things in long movies.</P>
<P>     Focus.  I guess that's the problem.  We're all over the place
here.  We get a sermon on guns, pornography, gambling, homelessness, a
sentimental attachment to an elderly Nazi chauffeur, acrobatic angels
on a stealthy ninja mission, death, precious life, and all SORTS of
things.  It leave you with a lot to think about... lots of breadth, no
depth.  The most engaging films I've seen have focused on one theme,
rather than this huge assortment.</P>
<P>     If I'm gonna see a serious film (as opposed to a whup-ass film) I
much prefer a film that acts as a magnifying glass, focusing the sun
into a painfully burning spot, rather than a nice diffuse tan.</P>
<P>Technical Comments
------------------
     They did the currently trendy switching from black-n-white for the
angels (apparently angels have dog eyes) and color for humans. It did
work well though.</P>
<P>     Soundtrack is pretty cool too.  Lou Reed has a cameo role as
himself.  I've heard friends say they like the soundtrack, though I
haven't heard it yet.  I tend to let the soundtrack fade into the
background ('cept for UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD, another Wim Wenders
film, which had an awesome soundtrack that jumped out at you.  Oh, and
there was DAZED AND CONFUSED, too).</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     Well the Cannes Film festival people liked it.  It got a "Grand
Jury Prize: Cannes 1993".  As for me, well, it was good, but in the way
something very beautiful, expensive and fragile in your mother's house
is.  Or a big smorgasbord that you want to savor, but you're only
allowed a pinch from each area.  So I enjoyed watching it, but I'm not
gonna rave about it.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
 X  see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
    see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
