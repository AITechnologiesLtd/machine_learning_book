                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1995 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     I had a conversation with a sagacious friend at work last week
about the current rash of serial killer movies.  Naturally the subject
turned to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.   Here we had a movie which was a
critical and box office smash.  As my friend Jeff noted, Hollywood
loves to copy a success, but they often copy the wrong thing.  Some
collection of empty suits evidently thought that SILENCE succeeded
because it had serial killers.  They were wrong.  It succeeded because
it had well drawn characters who had an interesting relationship, and
because the movie generated genuine tension in the audience.  Enter the
ironically named COPYCAT.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT fails completely as a thriller.  It did not raise my pulse
once.  Aside from the odd "boo!," I sat unmoved.  There were a few
character moments, and one good line ("Helen!  I seem to have cured
your agoraphobia!").  And I'll admit that there wasn't much that I
actively disliked about the film.  But neither did it do much to win me
over.  All in all it played about like an old "NBC Mystery Movie"
except with blood, profanity and naked corpses. (I may be doing
injustice to the old TV show.  Most episodes of "Columbo" were much
more satisfying.)</P>
<P>     The only real surprise in the film was the way one character was
killed off.  The surprise came entirely from the staging and from the
fact that it was completely pointless.  He wasn't even killed by the
serial killer, but rather by some random tertiary character introduced
out of nowhere to play just this one scene.  I rather suspect that the
screenwriter just didn't want to have to deal with him at the end of
the movie.  Or maybe it was just another in a succession of cheap
thrills.</P>
<P>     I, for one, am looking forward to the end of the current fad of
cinema sadism.  While we wait for the boardroom brain trust in
Hollywood to start copying the wrong thing from some other hit movie,
we can at least cast a tiny vote for originality by spending our $7.00
on something other than COPYCAT.</P>
