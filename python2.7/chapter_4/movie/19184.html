<PRE>eXistenZ (Dimension Films)
Directed by David Cronenberg</PRE>
<P> With violent video games currently under scrutiny in light of the
tragedy in Colorado, writer-director David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" has
probably taken on a timeliness its author could never have anticipated.
But teetering on the cutting edge is hardly an unfamiliar position for
Cronenberg, whose 1982 shocker "Videodrome" prophetically warned about
the desensitization of viewers fed a steady diet of violent or
pornographic films, and whose 1986 remake of "The Fly" is often read as
an allegory about the AIDS crisis.
 "eXistenZ," which is almost lightweight in comparison to other
Cronenberg creations, spins a genuinely jolting yarn about world-famous
game designer Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest
breakthrough is a kill-or-be-killed program that's downloaded directly
into the body through a port in the base of the player's spine. Even the
controllers look like flattened-out, misshapen breasts. The problem with
the new technology is that it's too realistic, too convincing. Allegra
and her partner (Jude Law) finally get so swept up in what's going on
they can't tell if they're in the real world or the virtual world.
Through some clever twists, Cronenberg eventually succeeds in making the
audience feel as disoriented as Allegra, uncertain of what to believe at
any given time.
 Leigh, who couldn't underplay a part if she tried, envisions Allegra as
a kind of electronic junkie who shivers and writhes in ecstacy as she
plugs into the electronic drug she's created; to further underscore the
connection, the wires that link her to the source look uncannily like
umbilical cords. The rallying cry of Cronenberg's characters in
"Videodrome" was "Long live the new flesh!", but almost two decades
later the taut and tricky "eXistenZ" argues that sometimes progress can
take us to places we might have been better off avoiding altogether.
