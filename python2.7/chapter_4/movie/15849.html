Susan Granger's review of "DANCING AT LUGHNASA" (Sony Pictures Classics)</P>
<P> Give two-time Academy Award winner Meryl Streep a juicy role
with a foreign accent and, once again, she delivers a performance that
shimmers with Oscar gold. In this screen adaptation of Brian Friel's
Irish play about five unmarried sisters living in Donegal in 1936, she
plays the self-righteous eldest, an imperious schoolteacher whose
determination holds the family together - until, one magical August,
everything changes. After spending 25 years as a missionary priest in
Africa, their befuddled brother (Michael Gambon) returns. It's a
family reunion complicated by the re-appearance of the wandering
Welshman father of the eight year-old love-child of one of the sisters
(Catherine McCormack) and the festival of Lughnasa, a pagan ritual to
celebrate the harvest with music and dance. All of this emotional
upheaval is set against a time of change - the first radio, which
brings music into the modest farmhouse - and the industrial
revolution, which puts an end to two sisters' occupation of knitting
woolen gloves at home. Director Pat O'Connor not only delves into the
hardscrabble beauty of the rural Irish landscape - aided by the
magnificent cinematography of Kenneth MacMillan - but also elicits
remarkably strong performances from each of the actors. Nevertheless,
this is primarily a cerebral piece, not a cinematic one - which may
prevent it from reaching a wider audience. How does the film compare
with the play? It's better in that, on-stage, several of the Irish
actors spoke with such thick brogues that - while the concept was
clear - individual speeches were often indecipherable. On-screen, with
the added advantage of close-ups, each word is easily
understandable. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dancing at
Lughnasa" is an eloquent 7, a gritty tale of hardship and heartbreak.</P>
