<PRE>The King and I (1956)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 61</PRE>
<P>Margaret Landon's novel "Anna and the King of Siam"
was successfully adapted to the screen in 1946.
In 1951, it became a hit musical, featuring songs
by Rogers and Hammerstein.  Yul Brynner shaved his
head for his role as the King (he would eventually
give over 4,000 performances).  He also starred in
the film version of the musical, winning a Best Actor
Oscar in the process.</P>
<P>Deborah Kerr, wearing hoopskirts wide enough to
function as parachutes, played the schoolteacher.
Her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who would
later dub Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and
Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady".</P>
<P>The story of "The King and I" remains largely
faithful to the 1946 film version, although it
has been made more gentle (the characters of
Louis and Tuptim survive in the musical incarnation).
The $6.5 million production also boasts glorious
widescreen color cinematography, showcasing the costumes
and sets better than the original.  Still, I prefer
the 1946 version with its more dense script, which
has been simplified in the musical version to
accomodate the songs.</P>
<P>The story is well known.  In 1862, the widowed Anna
(Kerr) arrives in Siam (modern-day Thailand) to tutor
the many children of the King (Brynner).  The King is
a polygamist, and his many wives have produced
dozens of cute little kids, all of whom apparently
are under the age of twelve.  The King's latest
acquisition, a gift from Burma, is Tuptim (Rita Moreno).
But Tuptim is in love with Lun Tha (Carlos Rivas),
with whom she plans to elope.</P>
<P>Anna and the King have something in common: they
are both stubborn.  Anna insists on having an adjoining
brick house built for her, while the King wants her
at his beck and call.  As she wins his respect, she
becomes one of his chief advisors, especially for
impressing visiting British dignitaries who have
plans of making Siam a 'protectorate'.  In a coincidence
that could only occur in a movie, the British Ambassador
(Alan Mowbray) had once proposed to Anna.</P>
<P>My sympathies go to poor Louis (Rex Thompson), Anna's
pre-adolescent son.  Perpetually dressed up like
Little Lord Fauntelroy, one can only hope that Mother
will spring for a new wardrobe by the time he hits
puberty.</P>
<P>There is an interesting play-within-a-play, Tuptim's
Siamese adaptation of "Uncle Tom's Cabin".  Elsewhere,
however, the musical numbers, even when performed
by Asians, are completely Western in style.  Sometimes
they can be lame as well: "Hello Young Lovers" and
"We Kiss in a Shadow" are better in reputation than
in practice.</P>
<P>Brynner, of course, makes an excellent King of Siam.
His character has more bark than bite, and is often
quite funny; sometimes he even gets the best of Anna,
which is no small task since her character is more or
less perfect.</P>
