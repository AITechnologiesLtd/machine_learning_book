<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars</P>
<P>If taken in its most simplistic form, Little Voice examines the life
surrounding an incredible singer who wishes to keep her talents to
herself, with diversions along the way.  But if you can swallow what
director Mark Herman (Brassed Off) squashes into the package, Little
Voice suddenly becomes much more. No longer is it just about a woman
with a unique gift; it is about an innocent soul surrounded by a world
full of greed and selfishness.  In the last half of the film Herman
changes its tone into something much darker, and Little Voice advances
from passable entertainment to wild and uncouth insights into characters
and life.</P>
<P>Mark Herman adapted the screenplay of Little Voice from Jim Cartwright's
play, and that shows because the film is melodramatic and relies heavily
on strong performances.  Fortunately, the three or four key characters
have talented actors bringing them to life.   Michael Caine is the best
of the lot, delivering a show stopping performance in a difficult part.
In the hardest and most important role, Jane Horrocks proves she is
better as a singer/impersonator than she is as an actor, but is good
enough to handle the pressure when so many others would have bombed out.
A couple of other fine performances from Brenda Blethyn and Ewan
McGregor make Little Voice a good example of a simplistic story given
meaning by its performances.  In comparison to the many other
screenplays that are smarter, more meaningful and more accessible,
Little Voice probably shouldn't have been the very good film that it is.</P>
<P>LV (Jana Horrocks) is a shy and reserved woman with a troubled past.
After the death of her much loved father LV has lived with her loud,
vulgar mother Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn).  LV finds a sanctuary from the
crazy world around her in a collection of old records, featuring Billie
Holiday, Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Marlena Dietrich,
and others.  She has an extraordinary talent for impersonating these
artists, and when Mari's sex partner Ray Say (Michael Caine) hears her
singing, he sees dollar signs.  But much to Say's horror, LV does not
want to become the star he wishes her to be.</P>
<P>It is always a hard task to portray socially inept characters without
allowing them to appear as freaks. The fundamental attraction of 1997's
As Good as it Gets was Jack Nicholson's portrayal of one of societie's
oddballs, but the attraction to Little Voice lies in its supporting
characters. Brenda Blethyn gives an appropriately over the top
performance which carries more weight than you might at first presume.
She is imperative to the story, serving as a contrast to LV's timid
personality.  But the true appeal of Little Voice is Michael Caine, who
caught my eye as an expert performer ever since he purposely made The
World's Great Detective look like The World's Greatest Idiot in 1988's
Without a Clue.  Caine is a definite scene-stealer, and is fortunate
enough to star in the best moment of Little Voice - a fiery and moving
scene in which he recites Roy Orbison's "It's Over."</P>
<P>With so much retrospective appeal, it's surprising that Mark Herman
rarely creates scenes of straight entertainment.  Instead he pretty much
goes nowhere for the first half of Little Voice, prolonging the dramatic
scenes until he decides which characters should voice them.  The most
moving and emotional performance should have been Jana Horrocks', but
the film's supporting cast overshadows her with roles that generate more
entertainment and interest.</P>
<P>As Little Voice begins to wind up, Herman satisfies his audience by
providing enough reason for sitting through his peculiar creation.
Although it takes a while to get there, Little Voice eventually
reassures us that the strongest people are not always the loudest, and
that when one manages to finds happiness there are many others who get
lost along the way.</P>
