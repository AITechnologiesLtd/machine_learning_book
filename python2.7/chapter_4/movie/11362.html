<PRE>L.A. Confidential
3/01/98</PRE>
<P>Welcome to 1950s Los Angeles, city of greed, corruption, money, and power,
just of few of it's qualities. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL displays all of these
characteristics in under two and a half hours, an incredible achievement.  </P>
<P>The story revolves around three cops, Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey), Bud
White(Russell Crowe)and Ed Exley(Guy Pearce). These three are out to find
out the truth concerning a slaughter at a local coffee shop the Night Owl.
During their investigation they find out that the motive is far more
involved than simply robbery.  During their investigation Bud gets involved
with a prostitute, Lynn Bracken(Kim Basinger), who looks like a famous
actress. Jack is also getting payoffs from  Sid Hudgeons'(Danny DeVito)
tabloid magazine all the while investigating the murders.</P>
<P>This movie has a lot good about it, in fact its relatively perfect.
Director Curtis Hanson(The Hand That Rocks the Cradle) does a superb job of
pulling everyone in the crew's talent together in a movie that is very
fluid and highly entertaining. The acting is flawless, Kevin Spacey and Kim
Basinger deserve Oscars for their standout performances. Guy Pearce,
Russell Crowe, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell deliver outstanding
performances as well. The cinematography(Dante Spinotti), music(Jerry
Goldsmith), costumes(Ruth Myers) and editing(Peter Honess) are noteworthy
and add to the film's excellence. Lastly the script(Brian Helgeland &
Curtis Hanson, based on the book by James Ellroy) is taut and full of
delicious plot twist that keep you on the edge of your seat in
anticipation.  This movie is an American Film-Noir masterpiece, and one of
my personal favorites of 1997.  </P>
