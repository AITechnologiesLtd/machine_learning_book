<P>     While a complete review is in the works, I can report that BATMAN
AND ROBIN is easily the most light-hearted of the franchise.  Though not
quite the camp classic that director Joel Schumacher obviously intended,
it delivers many a hearty Batlaugh, from Schwarzenegger's see-'em-a-
mile-away one-liners to Thurman's wonderfully punny innuendo.  (To the
diamond- stealing Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy purrs "I'll help you grab your
rocks.")  As usual, the villains steal the show-- what else is new?--
but at least the heroes get a bigger share of the screen time.  Chris
O'Donnell is, again, the most believable on the dramatic front.  Clooney
is the best *looking* Bruce Wayne to date, but, well, he smiles too
much.  Ms. Silverstone, making her debut as Batgirl, is adequate and
little else.  More action-figure action, much of it way-over-the-top,
from sky-surfing without parachutes (!) to a vehicle chase down the arm
of a giant statue.  Great production design, too.  (The most accomplish-
ed of the four films, I'd say).  Like all the Batfeatures before it,
however, the film's greatest failing is in the editing.  Nips and tucks
(and even some slices) are needed all over the place.  And what's with
the repetitive score?  Definitely not for purists.</P>
