<P>Francis Ford Coppola knew that if a third installment in his 'Godfather'
series was going to be made,
he would have to offer audiences and critics alike a new perspective.
His story of power within an organized crime family had propelled 'The
Godfather' (1972) and 'The Godfather Part II' (1974) to the top of many
"all time greatest films" lists.  Those who expected 'The Godfather Part
III' to be as good as those films were, frankly, fools.  Coppola's
intention in the third film was clearly aimed at offering a story of
redemption.  Sixteen years had passed and 1990 brought a whole new
decade of film making that so far by 1998, would look a great deal
better than the 80's.</P>
<P>Returning for the third time would be Al Pacino, referred to by Coppola
as America's greatest actor.  Pacino would reprise his role of Michael
Corleone, a man who destroyed his life by bowing to the trappings of
wealth through ill gotten means which he inherited from his father.
Michael, as a more ruthless ruler and killer than his father had been,
is now looking to redeem his immortal soul by going straight.  All
illegitimate investments made by the Corleone family have now been sold
off and their money has been invested into real estate.</P>
<P>As part two left off, it was 1959.  As "The Godfather Part III' opens,
we see the decaying former Corleone estate in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.  It is
now deserted.  Michael begins narrating a letter he is writing to his
children, asking them to come to a religious ceremony where he will
receive a special award by his church for his charitable contributions.
As the letter is being narrated, the film shifts to a shot of New York
City.  It is 1979.  In the church, as Michael is receiving his honour,
he has a flashback to the murder of his brother, Fredo.  A murder which
Michael engineered and gave the go ahead to.  As fans of the series
know, Fredo betrayed Michael, which led to this ghastly fate.  As
Michael grew older, he regretted this action and had been haunted by it
ever since.  Fredo's murder and Michael as the perpetrator of it, would
be the central theme of the film and the most admirable thing about 'The
Godfather III' is the under lying Shakespearean overtones express.  Not
just in the last scenario I described, but throughout the film as many
tragedies are showcased.</P>
<P>Also returning for a third time would be Diane Keaton as Michael's
former wife Kay and Talia Shire as Michael's loyal sister Connie.  Some
other minor characters reprise their roles and it's fun to watch for
them and say "I remember that guy.  Is he still around?"</P>
<P>A vibrant new character named Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) would be
introduced to audiences as Michael's illegitimate nephew.  Vincent is
the son of Michael's brother Sonny, portrayed by James Caan in the first
film and seen in a cameo in the second.  Garcia would be the only cast
member nominated for an Oscar.  He was nominated for Best Supporting
Actor and the Academy's failure to nominate Pacino as Best Actor was a
travesty as Pacino brought a fresh angle to his character with total
believability.  Pacino got nominated for as Oscar the same year he made
'The Godfather Part III'.  He was nominated as Best Supporting Actor
(against Garcia) for 'Dick Tracy' as he played an over the top villain
under heavy make-up.</P>
<P>Michael takes Vincent under his wing and shares his experiences in what
is now the legitimate family business.  Vincent's desire for a life of
crime is driven by his greater desire to destroy a vile and under handed
thug named Joey Zaza, played very well by Joe Mantegna.  Zaza controls
all the things the Corleone family used to be involved in.  Drugs,
gambling, prostitution and other vices are Zaza's specialty and he aims
to kill Michael later in the film with help from some powerful forces
who are also out to swindle and destroy Michael.  Michael is drawn back
in to a life of crime by sheer destiny.  A destiny set in motion when
Michael was a young man, not thinking that once you're in, it's for
life.</P>
<P>Pivotal to the film's outcome is the character of Mary Corleone,
Michael's daughter.  As portrayed by Sofia Coppola (Francis' daughter),
the character is nearly ruined.  Her acting is just downright bad and if
her part had been any bigger, the film would have failed miserably.
Coppola had to replace Winona Ryder who had started in the role of Mary
but had to withdraw after suffering from exhaustion by coming directly
off a couple of other films she worked on.  Julia Roberts and Madonna
had also been considered at one point for the role of Mary.  Michael's
other grown-up offspring, Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) is a complete throw
away as his character is never examined or given any real focus.</P>
<P>Other notable actors in the film are George Hamilton as Michael's
attorney and Eli Wallach as an old friend of the Corleone's who double
crosses Michael for his own selfish gains.  Robert Duvall, who played
Tom Hagen, Michael's step brother and family attorney in the first two
films, didn't appear in part three, reportedly because they wouldn't pay
him enough.</P>
<P>Technically, the film moves well.  Gordon Willis' 'prince of darkness'
photography has an uncanny depth of focus and sizzles with many darkened
indoor scenes and one scene involving a helicopter attack upon a group
of crime bosses through the skylight of a hotel banquet room, is
brilliantly photographed.</P>
<P>'The Godfather Part III' is an overall excellent film that offers a new
story while it combines memories of the past through its reoccurring
characters and Andy Garcia's performance of what Michael was in the
second film.  Part three was nominated for seven Oscars including Best
Picture and Best Director for Francis Ford Coppola.  Coppola wrote the
script with Mario Puzo and they failed to receive an Oscar nomination
for their writing this time around.  The two of them won Oscars for
their screenplays of the first two films.  There is no need or desire on
my part for a fourth film.  Coppola didn't get lucky by having his third
film accepted by critics, audiences and his peers.  He constructed the
film sharply and didn't repeat himself.  He re-invented himself.</P>
