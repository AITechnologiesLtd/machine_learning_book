<P>Suppose you are about to tie the knot.  You are forced to travel on
the road after your plane ride goes awry on the way to your wedding
destination, a number of strangers you pass like a ship in the night
strike up a friendly and time consuming conversation with you where you
hear alleged horror stories about the padlock known as marriage where
conservative belief is that in most cases it's all supposed to work out
and things will remain rosy but the truth is that people, as different
as they all are, sometimes have a hard time staying with the same person
for their whole life.  That is the premise behind 'Forces of Nature'.</P>
<P>Ben Affleck stars as Ben Holmes, a New York City writer who is engaged
to a southern belle from Savannah, Georgia named Bridget (Maura
Tierney).  Her family is wealthy. Her father (Ronny Cox) is a straight
shooting conservative businessman and her mother (Blythe Danner) voted
twice for Clinton because as she puts it: "All the best presidents sleep
around".  Ben's mother and father are upper middle class and don't see
eye to eye with their southern in-laws.  As his coach flight is about to
take off, a freak accident occurs that prevents the plane from taking
off and Ben now has to find an alternative form of transportation.  He
travels with a woman who believes he saved her life named Sarah (Sandra
Bullock), a free spirited woman who won't be held down by anything and
travels in whatever direction the wind is blowing.  They experience all
the bad luck you can imagine such as the kind of fun (for the audience
only) that Steve Martin and John Candy experienced in 1987's 'Planes,
Trains & Automobiles'.</P>
<P>The film's entertainment value trickles down slowly like a pleasant
light rain.  It's constant and very relieving and even manages to remain
very witty along the way.  If you're going to tell a story about two
people who learn something about each other and apply it separately to
their own lives, it's a good idea to balance the amount of time each has
on screen and this is done perfectly.  And what really makes the film
work is that neither Ben Affleck or Sandra Bullock try to upstage one
another.  Their personalities enhance the film extremely well and they
have the perfect on screen chemistry needed to make any relationship
picture work.</P>
<P>Director Bronwen Hughes ('Harriet the Spy'), gives his film a good pace
but about half way through, it slows down considerably --- more than it
should actually, but picks itself up for a satisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>'Forces of Nature' works for another good reason.  The script by Marc
Lawrence, Ian Bryce, and Donna Roth has a tendency to look for acute
social observations on marriage, divorce, parenthood and relationships
without making it look obvious.  The film's dialogue flows so naturally
that personality is the movie's strongest trait.</P>
