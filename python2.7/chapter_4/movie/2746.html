<PRE>                                  THE MASK
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The biggest thing in movie making these last few years has been
the advent of fantastic special effects.  Leading the pack is ILM,
Industrial Light & Magic, which has given us JURASSIC PARK, DEATH
BECOMES HER, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, ET: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL, the
"Indiana Jones" series, the "Star Wars" trilogy, and on to FORREST
GUMP.  In THE MASK they live up to their reputation as the best.</P>
<P>     Here the wearer of the mask has all the outlandish movements we
are accustomed to seeing in cartoons.  The character spins like a top,
whirls into the air and away, has eyes that pop way out, a tongue about
a yard long, a heart that jumps out several yards and pumps away.</P>
<P>     But while special effects are great the movie also needs a story
and THE MASK provides that along with some great comedy by Jim Carrey.
Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) is a timid bank clerk.  Into the bank (with
thunder and music turned way up) enters Tina (Cameron Diaz in her
first film): tall, blonde and with a body made in heaven.  While making
advances on the stunned Ipkiss, the camera in her purse is taking
pictures of the vault.</P>
<P>     When, through a series of circumstances, Ipkiss finds a mask that
has been in a treasure chest under sea for many years, he puts it on
his face as a gag and instantly changes into a man of action, a super
hero.  Bullets cannot stop him.  He whirls, he dodges, he is invincible
but always in a highly original and humorous way.</P>
<P>     Very funny dialogue aids the film so that Carrey's broad comedic
style here and the odd story of the magical mask all result in a
hilarious and different kind of movie.  While the film could use about
15 minutes of editing, it is one of the funniest to come along in a
great while.</P>
