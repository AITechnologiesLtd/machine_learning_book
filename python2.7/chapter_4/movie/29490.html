<PRE>The Musketeer</PRE>
<PRE>Avoid at All Costs</PRE>
<P>While it may seem petty, in light of this week's events, to decry this
movie as an abomination, well, that is what it felt like sitting in the
theatre.  The Musketeer starts out in an average enough fashion, with
slightly wooden dialogue, Tim Roth over acting, super tight shots of abrupt
movements.  Then, an appalling 1970's student film takes over for the
opening credits.  Apparently paying Xin Xin Xiong (the fight choreographer,
whose name was the only one billed in the previews) left no cash for the
titles.  My companions giggled uncomfortably during the weird and horrible
early 80's TV movie titles.  Still, chin up, we will survive this - and
besides, the teaser portion of the movie looked just fine.  Key word:
Looked.  Please note the past tense.</P>
<P>Then the movie reverted back to normal.  The sucking began slowly,
gradually, imperceptibly.  An out of focus shot here, an overly dark action
sequence there, inexplicable behavior and silly dialogue scattered like
breadcrumbs in the dark woods.  It was still the first real scene in the
film, it could just have been a ham-handed bid at mystery.</P>
<P>The first fight scene is elaborate, almost cartoonish in its
fifty-moves-where-one-will-do, with fingerhold balance absurdity.
Impressive hiding of the wires, however - it was so dark in this scene they
could have been suspended from nautical ropes.  Was it dark?  You bet -
almost totally Asian stunt team (according to the credits) probably did not
resemble their white French Gallic patrician characters very much, so the
director opts for a muddy too-close soup of stupidity.</P>
<P>The director, Peter Hyams, is also the cinematographer (in a low attempt to
be Robert Rodriguez, I suppose) and his name set off clanging Notre
Dame-size bells in my head - but from what?  End of Days, that wasn't so
bad (but now that I think about it, it was dark), Timecop - and The Relic.
Long the butt of my movie crowd's derision, The Relic was only used as an
object of positive comparison after Phantoms came out.  Similarly, The
Musketeer is only watchable when compared to the truly unwatchable, like
Battlefield Earth.  We did have a lot of laughs watching this film, and it
is extremely MST3K-friendly, but man is it rank.</P>
<P>Enter the dame, modern American Virgin/Beauty/Pie's Mena Suvari, whose
period acting is comparable to Winona Ryder's.  "Sexual tension" is played
as flat wit after being translated into various languages.  Then it gets
worse.  Continuity is non-existent - bad guys disappear when they are
dispatched like a Playstation game, and turn up with the same logic-free
silliness.  By the end we were holding our pounding heads in agony (like
Relic companion SJ's forehead bruise after pounding his fist there
repeatedly during that film), rolling our eyes, gasping in horror, and
inserting our own superior dialogue.  Instead of calling in, say, William
Goldman or Carrie Fisher, apparently all the script rewrites were done by
Koko (the gorilla) - didn't Cardinal Richlieu at one point say "drink drink
apple me kill D'Artagnan?"
Bad dialogue, dark dark scenes, Stephen Rea & Tim Roth yawning through
their scenes, Catherine Deneuve looking like she shot up heroin just to
tolerate the job, and D'Artagnan (The Wedding Planner's Justin Chambers)
almost irritatingly serious throughout.</P>
<P>Good points:  production design, art department, locations, makeup,
wardrobe, all fantastic.  The ladder scene (even if it is ridiculous, it's
still extremely cool.)
Bad points:  Everything else.  The entire movie is a flimsy and needlessly
complex construct to justify the admittedly cool ladder scene.  FYI:  The
Ladder Scene is one hour, 45 minutes into the film.  Do yourself a favor:
buy a ticket to Rat Race, watch these 5 minutes of the Musketeer, and then
go see Rat Race.</P>
<P>Hong Kong actioners generally don't need such dense and elaborate plots to
show off cool fight choreography.  The Must-Not-Hear is low on fights, big
on badly explained 17th century French politics, and long on suck.  The
HTML code on the home page for The Musketeer would be a better screenplay.</P>
