<P>In 1991, "Less Than Zero" author Bret Easton Ellis stirred up a hornet's
nest with "American Psycho," possibly the most reviled book of the
decade. The novel detailed the thoughts of Patrick Bateman, a yuppie
obsessed with status and murder, offering non-stop brand name dropping
and surgically explicit descriptions of the mutilations of his prey.
Outraged readers denounced the story as a misogynist (most of the
victims were female) piece of gore-porn.</P>
<P>Nine years later, "American Psycho" returns to the spotlight as a film,
written and directed by women.</P>
<P>Director Mary Harron, who co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner,
dismisses the critics, calling the novel "a brilliant social satire and
a devastating portrait of the 1980s." By keeping most of the violence
off camera, she has crafted a highly stylized fable, a combination
creep-show and pitch-black comedy that steadily builds to an almost
hallucinatory climax. While virtually every element of the film was
better explored in last year's exceptional "Fight Club," Harron's
adaptation holds several distinct rewards.</P>
<P>Chief among them is the performance of cult favorite Christian Bale
("Empire of the Sun," "A Midsummer Night's Dream") as Patrick Bateman.
Bale looks like an elongated, stressed-out Tom Cruise and adopts an
upscale Eastern American accent. He starts with a mildly exaggerated
power tone that gradually escalates to full hysteria, venturing
extremely close to caricature while never quite crossing the line.</P>
<P>Bale spent months weight training for the role and looks great, but in
the context of the story, his body appears less like that of a sexually
attractive male and more like a well-designed android. Despite his
constant grooming and preening, Patrick Bateman is just an anonymous
capitalist, so indistinguishable from his Wall Street peers that he is
often mistaken for another of the corporate boys.</P>
<P>Boys, by the way, is the operative word. These arrested adolescents
define themselves totally by their clothing and acquisitions. Instead of
comparing penises, they whip out their business cards to determine whose
is the most tastefully extravagant.</P>
<P>Of course, attacking materialists for being shallow is about as daring
as calling politicians dishonorable, but Bateman's personal life does
provide some twisted fun. He does crunches while watching "The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre." He peppers his conversations with serial killer
references and drops hints about his homicidal leanings (asked what he
does for a living, he glibly says "murders and executions," which his
companion hears as "mergers and acquisitions").</P>
<P>During foreplay, he gives impassioned lectures about his favorite pop
artists. Particularly enjoyable are his inane comments on Huey Lewis.
Bateman states that the homogenized popster's early works were "too New
Wave" for his tastes and describes one of whiter-than-white Huey's songs
as "too black sounding." He also rhapsodizes about Whitney Houston and
Phil Collins, going so far as to play Collins' infamous "Sussudio," one
of the most wretched songs ever recorded, while having sex.</P>
<P>Incidentally, that sex scene, which shows Bateman gazing adoringly in
the mirror at his muscles as he makes it with two women, was the only
segment that had to be edited to satisfy the prudes in the MPAA. To
avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating, a couple of thrusting motions had to be
cut out (Harron intends to put them back in when the film hits DVD).</P>
<P>After a round in the sack, Bateman likes to cap things off by hacking up
his partner. The film's most memorable stretch has him chasing a hooker
through the halls of his apartment building (a la "The Shining") while
hoisting a chain saw in front of his nude form like some mega-phallus.
Not exactly subtle, but it works.</P>
<P>If, like me, you grow weary of "American Psycho's" repetitious narration
and lack of plot, try entertaining yourself by deciding (WARNING:
POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD) whether the murders are real or figments of
Bateman's imagination. A case can be made either way, although oddities
in a number of scenes, coupled with a wildly surrealistic finale, point
strongly to the latter. I prefer the it's-all-in-his-head scenario;
serial killer movies are a dime a dozen, but the idea of a nicely
mannered co-worker smiling and nodding while quietly fantasizing about
hacking me to pieces is chilling (END SPOILER ALERT).</P>
<P>When I give even a qualified positive review to a film like "American
Psycho," I inevitably receive a handful of letters from readers furious
that I "lured" them into wasting their money on "a parade of utter
crap." As a preemptive strike, I wish to clearly state that "American
Psycho" is a difficult movie. D-I-F-F-I-C-U-L-T. If you generally prefer
mainstream fare, there's a good chance you will not enjoy yourself. Got
it? Good.</P>
