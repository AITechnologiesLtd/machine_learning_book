<PRE>AMERICAN PERFEKT (1997)</PRE>
<P>"All over America, sane people doing insane things."</P>
<PRE>2.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert Forster, Fairuza Balk, Amanda Plummer, David Thewlis
Written & Directed by Paul Chart
Cinematography by William Wages</P>
<P>AMERICAN PERFEKT knows exactly what kind of movie it wants to be, but 
it doesn't know how to be it.  It aspires to be a quirky road movie, 
but goes about it in the wrong way.  It's as if debut writer/director 
Paul Chart held his material at arm's length, looked at it carefully, 
decided that he wanted it to be weird, and systematically applied 
cosmetic changes to make it seem weird, hoping that these surface 
changes would somehow sink into the bones of the story, transforming 
it.  They don't.  </P>
<P>Chart works from the outside in, but real weirdness comes from the 
inside and works its way out, distorting everything it touches along 
the way.  It takes the eye of a David Lynch or a Joel Coen to make a 
really weird movie.  Chart doesn't have that eye.  This is not to say 
that he doesn't have talent; I think he does.  But, in AMERICAN 
PERFEKT, I think his talent is wrongly applied.  The premise is that 
of a thriller-cum-road-movie, pure and simple; the other stuff just 
gets in the way.</P>
<P>Robert Forster stars as Jake Nyman, a criminal psychologist obsessed 
with chance.  In a world where science seems to have an answer to 
everything, Jake thinks the toss of a coin--a 50/50 proposition whose 
outcome cannot be known in advance--holds an uncertainty that is 
immensely appealing.  He decides what to have for breakfast by tossing 
a coin; he decides who to kill by tossing a coin.  Life, he believes, 
has become routine and predictable; people need the unexpected in 
their lives.  This, he says, is the reason why white-collar petty 
crime, like shoplifting housewives, is on the rise; he takes this need 
for the unexpected to the extreme.</P>
<P>Forster, fresh off his Oscar nomination for JACKIE BROWN, does good 
work here.  He seems like such a regular guy, in appearance and 
demeanor, but there is a maddening reasonableness in everything he 
says and does which subtly suggests the insanity of a serial killer.  
As he travels through California, two emotionally unbalanced sisters, 
Sandra and Alice (Amanda Plummer, Fairuza Balk), and a British con man 
(David Thewlis) will be involved in his fatal game of chance.</P>
<P>Each scene in the film has an off-kilter quality, as the characters 
talk and act in unpredictable ways, but there is no flow.   Each scene 
seems to stand apart, and the weirdness does not progress according to 
any internal logic.  Characters act strangely only because the script 
wants them to be strange.  Alice at one point describes her 
ex-boyfriend as being "like all the colours you've never seen," yet 
nowhere else does she speak in this flowery fashion.  Santini makes a 
comment about a piece of music which makes him want to cry--for no 
apparent reason, except that it's not the sort of thing you'd expect 
him to say.   Nor are they an appealing bunch--Plummer, Balk, and 
Thewlis play people who are downright annoying.  You want to grab them 
by the lapels and shake some sense into them.  We don't care about 
them, so what we have to care about, if we are going to like the film, 
are the idiosyncracies that make the material fresh and compelling.  
But it is not idiosyncratic enough.  The narrative momentum carries us 
past the weaker moments, but leads to a conclusion which is abrupt and 
unsatisfying.  AMERICAN PERFEKT is not solid enough as a thriller to 
satisfy us, and not weird enough to intrigue and entertain as a 
bizarre road movie.</P>
<P>There are nice details.  I liked Paul Sorvino as a small-town law 
official who seemed at first to be another of those incompetent hick 
sheriffs who are commonplace in movies, but turned out to be an 
efficient, reasonable guy, playing off our expectations.  And Sharp 
has a flair for disorienting the viewer in small, subtle ways.  Early 
in the film, Sandra and Jake are talking, and the camera pans right 
till we can only see Sandra, who keeps talking; moments later, Jake 
reappears on the opposite side of the frame, having circled around 
off-camera.  It's a neat, disarming touch.  Even the end credits 
scroll backwards, from bottom-to-top.</P>
<P>But all this stuff, which I liked, happens on the edges of the film.  
The centre does not hold.  The story is incoherent, lacking background 
and resolution, leaving us with a series of encounters and incidents, 
loosely pieced together.  Maybe all this incohesion is justified by 
Chart as being part of the randomness of life, the randomness 
celebrated by Jake in his own bloody way--but anyone can use that as 
an excuse for a bad movie.  Cinema is not a random happening.  And if 
Chart really wanted to make a movie which imitates the messy 
unpredictability of life, he shouldn't have used the overdetermined 
logic of a thriller to draw us in, then abandon that logic when it 
suited him.  He wants to have his cake and eat it too; he plays with a 
two-headed coin, and as Jake himself observes in the movie, that's 
cheating.</P>
