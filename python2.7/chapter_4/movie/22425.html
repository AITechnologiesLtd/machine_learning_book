<P>Looking for an action movie with lots of special effects?  Then don't look 
at "The Straight Story."  But if you're after a well-acted character study, 
a masterful collection of frame tales,  this small film will leave you well 
pleased.</P>
<P>Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a character based on the real man 
who drove his lawn tractor across Iowa and into Wisconsin in order to see 
his sick brother.  As always, Farnsworth exhibits a gentle, patient style of 
acting.  If you saw "The Natural," you may remember him as the assistant 
coach with the white mustache, who ate spaghetti with Robert Redford, 
treating him like a friend when no one else did.  Here Farnsworth shows 
quiet dignity when friends discover him on the floor of his kitchen, unable 
to get to his feet.  It turns out that Alvin has bad hips, and his daughter 
Rose (Sissy Spacek) is very worried about him.  When he discovers that his 
estranged brother Lyle has had a stroke, Alvin stubbornly makes his 
decision.  Bad hips, bad eyes, no driver's license, stiff-necked 
independence:  not many options.  No one seems to have faith in Alvin's mode 
of transportation, an ancient lawnmower tugging a makeshift plywood-covered 
trailer.  In fact, Alvin does not even reach the next town, fulfilling the 
pessimism of one of the nosey curmudgeons down at the hardware store.  But a 
friend sells him a more reliable - though still thirty year-old - John 
Deere, and he's able to resume his slow but sure journey.</P>
<P>What begins with a simple premise offers consummate opportunities.  This is 
a finely wrought road movie, with all kinds of stories-within-stories 
waiting to be told.  There's a pregnant runaway who receives a wiener and 
life-saving advice around Alvin's campfire.  There's a woman whose car hits 
a deer just yards in front of Alvin's motley rig - the thirteenth deer in 
seven weeks.  There are several other sidetracking tales told and heard 
along his route - one particularly wrenching one narrated by Alvin himself.  
It's the storytelling motif that makes this film hang together, with the 
implication of just how important stories are to our very lives, to our ways 
of understanding the world.</P>
<P>Along with the quiet ways of the wizened character actor Farnsworth, there's 
also a quietness about the movie's tone.  A few scenes we view from several 
yards away, the speakers too far to hear distinctly, and so we must rely on 
our understanding of plot, a bit of inflection thrown in….  Director David 
Lynch further uses shots that linger longer than they would in another 
filmmaker's movie.  The cuts don't come as quickly, and therefore we get a 
sense of prolonged realism, a technique that makes for solid character 
study.  Modern attention spans would not be pleased by several of these 
moments.</P>
<P>In a just world without politics, Richard Farnsworth would receive large 
awards for his work in "The Straight Story" - and not because it's sometimes 
deemed fashionable to send a trophy the way of a senior citizen.  In nearly 
every shot the actor acquits himself with remarkable reserve, depicting the 
determination it must take to drive across states at a speed of four miles 
an hour.  We hear stories that tell us Alvin is the father of 14 children, 
seven of whom survived childhood.  He saw combat in the Second World War.  
And now he has decided to see the brother to whom he was so close in youth.  
Each time Alvin tells his story to a curious listener along the way, we 
understand he is also preparing himself for the actual visit to Lyle, a 
piece of his life lost through anger and alcohol.  Once again, Farnsworth 
knows how to mimic the most subtle emotions, plainly plodding toward Alvin's 
crazy goal.</P>
<P>Sissy Spacek delivers an astounding portrayal of a mentally challenged woman 
- Rose, Alvin's daughter.  The most striking aspect of her performance is 
perhaps her awkward, halting pattern of speech, a hard-starting stutter that 
puts us in mind of a sensitive and troubled soul.  She is now her father's 
faithful housekeeper, though further into the film we discover the 
unpleasant events that shook Rose's life.  Though we see the father-daughter 
relationship only in the first third of the film, its strength sends a 
powerful message about family.</P>
<P>The supporting cast does a nice, natural job, interacting well with Alvin, 
in many cases showing him good deeds that he usually tries to refuse.  Jane 
Heinz is Dorothy, Alvin and Rose's neighbor; Everitt McGill is Tom the John 
Deere dealer; and many other actors play the average people occupying the 
towns through which Alvin drives.  Although his appearance is short, Harry 
Dean Stanton is perfectly cast as Lyle Straight, a man who lives in a 
ramshackle cabin in the Wisconsin country, every bit as stubborn as his 
older brother.  Stanton is one of the few actors whose craggy face matches 
Farnsworth's own.</P>
<P>The nature of the film calls for outdoor scenes, and clearly part of Lynch's 
agenda is to show beautiful expanses of the American Midwest.  Much of the 
landscape awes us not only with its beauty but with its size, Alvin crawling 
along a road that stretches endlessly before him.  We do get a few too many 
aerial shots of wind-blown corn fields, at times a harvester going full 
blast in the October sun.  Repetitive violin and guitar music frequently 
accompanies these scenic establishing shots.</P>
<P>Part of this G-rated film's attention has come from its director's 
reputation for making off-beat, often graphically violent films.  Yes, "The 
Straight Story" is a different path for David Lynch, but it shows strong 
intuition and storytelling sense.  And it's certainly a pleasure to be able 
to take every member of the family:  though you may not find this film in 
every multiplex, it is worth searching out.  You'll leave the theater with 
an encouraging vision of the real America, held together by a creaky but 
still strong backbone.</P>
