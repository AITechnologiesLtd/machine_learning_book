USA, 1980
Rated R (graphic violence, strong language, some sexuality)</PRE>
<PRE>A</PRE>
<P>Raging Bull is about violence.  It is a graphic film that uses time and
space in and out of the boxing ring to full effect.  The celebrated
1940s and '50s boxer, Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro), is portrayed here as
sleazy, jealous, and brutal; he's an animal.  For Martin Scorsese,
Robert DeNiro, and Paul Schrader, Raging Bull had to be made and their
passion paid off: over time, the film has become the team's most famous
achievement after Taxi Driver and has been named the best film of the
‘80s and one of the greatest films of all time.  It is a relentless
movie and the complete opposite of the much more affectionate tribute to
boxing, Rocky.</P>
<P>However, as critics are eager to point out, Raging Bull is not about
boxing.  It looks at the sport as an outlet for expressing one's
inclement emotions.  Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxing champion, is
extremely violent in nature and he doesn't box for the sake of boxing
but to calm his frustrations.  To him, being inhumane is almost
medicinal.  Living in New York, LaMotta is plagued by several things but
mainly by his ever-present jealousy and suspicion of the women in his
life.  Being the brute that he is, he tries to turn his lovers into
subservient, timid creatures.  This ends his first marriage and scars a
second one to a blonde young woman named Vicki (Cathy Moriarty).</P>
<P>Jake's brother and manager, Joey (Joe Pesci), is similarly burdened by
him.  During the straining course of LaMotta's boxing career, Jake seems
to enjoy being the victim.  Seeking the sin of relatives and friends, he
pulls crimes out of thin air and accuses those close to him of them.
Vicki is loyal but emotionally emaciated by Jake's merciless scrutiny of
her every move.  She can't even say goodbye to a male acquaintance
without being interrogated by Jake.  We never learn if Vicki is cheating
on him but, from what we witness on screen, he has no good reason to
suspect her of betrayal.</P>
<P>The fights in Raging Bull, both in and out of the boxing ring, are
bloody.  Perfectly edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and exceptionally framed
and photographed by Michael Chapman, the film boasts several vicious
boxing sequences. We watch LaMotta punch his opponent into a pulp.  When
his wife briefly comments that a future opponent, Janiro, is
good-looking, he goes into a fit of rage.  When he finally fights
Janiro, he wounds his face so bad that a Mafia boss in the audience
quips "He ain't pretty no more." Martin Scorsese twists time and space
in the film, putting us inside the ring with two very angry men (there
are many sequences with LaMotta fighting Sugar Ray Robinson).  Scorsese
uses a stark soundtrack that is, at one moment, loud with screaming
spectators of a fight, then filled with quiet suspense as one rival
prepares to bloody the other.  Time and space is also manipulated
outside the ring.  To Jake, Vicki is an enigmatic, God-like figure.  We
see Vicki in slow-motion several times.  We also see those who LaMotta
believes to be Vicki's lovers in slow-motion.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the film, everyone leaves Jake. The last straw for
Joey is when Jake accuses him of cheating with Vicki.  It is amazing how
LaMotta blows every single movement of his wife out of proportion.
Vicki gives Joey a kiss and he goes flying with fury.  Vicki eventually
files for divorce when Jake retires and becomes a shoddy, overweight
emcee at bars.</P>
<P>The most famous scene in the film is LaMotta's recitation of the "I
coulda been a contenda…" speech from On the Waterfront.  Jake's reading
tells us of his relationship with his estranged brother, Joey, and his
regret for becoming what he now seems to be, "a bum."  DeNiro delivers
the scene without a shred of emotion but the parallels between Terry
Malloy's situation in Waterfront and LaMotta's in Raging Bull are
evident and profound to us.</P>
<P>Robert DeNiro's performance is searing.  His gaining fifty pounds for
the role of Jake LaMotta has become one of Hollywood's greatest
behind-the-scenes stories.  More importantly, DeNiro succeeds in showing
us LaMotta's ugliness and brutality and, at the end, his pathetic but
present streak of humanity.  LaMotta reaches a place of loss and slight
self-revelation at the end of Raging Bull and DeNiro makes his crisis
subtlety moving.</P>
<P>Raging Bull seems to be Martin Scorsese's film, however.  Incorporating
his trademark Italian-flavored dialogue (which is often hilarious and
lightens up the heavy issues of human bondage at hand), his sense of
physical and emotional violence, and his way with actors, Scorsese made
Raging Bull an indisputable masterpiece.  It is one of the most
unsympathetic and saddening portraits of a character whose inner demons
have eaten away his integrity.</P>
