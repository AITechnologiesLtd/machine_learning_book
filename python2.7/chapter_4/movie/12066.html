A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Nicholas Hytner</PRE>
<P>Written by: Wendy Wasserstein, from a novel by Stephen McCauley</P>
<P>Ingredients: Unsatisfying relationships, pregnant woman, gay man </P>
<PRE>Starring: 
Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A young woman named Nina (Jennifer Aniston) is the fiancee of Vince
(John Pankow). Meanwhile across town a young homosexual named George
(Paul Rudd) is the lover of Joley (Tim Daly). But these are largely
superficial, sexual relationships. One day at a party, Nina is attracted
to George. When she learns that George needs a room, she invites him to
share a two-bedroom apartment with her. Gay George breaks up with his
boyfriend and moves in with heterosexual Nina.</P>
<P>Soon enough, Nina and George are blowing kisses at each other, and
spending the night draped in each other's arms watching TV. When Nina
gets pregnant, she announces to the father, Vince (paraphrased): "It's
MY baby. I don't care if you're the father; I want you out of our lives
so that George can raise the baby." </P>
<P>Vince agrees to stay away. Then Nina tries her best to turn George into
a heterosexual, despite his orientation. Will she succeed?</P>
<P>Opinion:
I watched Jennifer Aniston in PICTURE PERFECT. She gets to do more
acting as Nina in THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, but as a fan, I'd actually
like to see Jen break out of the romance genre, and do an
out-of-character role like Mira Sorvino's in REPLACEMENT KILLERS or Matt
LeBlanc's Don West in LOST IN SPACE.</P>
<P>The intention of THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION is to give the audience the
message that, "Sometimes in life events compel things beyond our
control, and we must make the best of it, and isn't it surprising how
life turns out after all these years?"  </P>
<P>The problem is, Nina and George seem very much in control and not
propelled by events, so the 'forces beyond our control' theme doesn't
really work for THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION.</P>
<P>Nina, who already has a steady beau, meets complete stranger George at a
party, and asks him to live with her, no questions asked. Why would she
ask a stranger to move in without checking him out, if no normal person
would? The next day Nina signs George up to be her permanent dance
partner. What is she thinking?</P>
<P>Similarly, it's hard to see how a decidedly gay man with the honesty of
George could kiss Nina repeatedly on the lips, allow Nina to fondle him,
sleep in the same bed with her, let her unbutton his shirt, unzip his
fly, lick his abdomen, and pretend he's not leading her on. She's just
about to give him oral sex; why isn't he telling her he's gay? What's
his big secret?  </P>
<P>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION tries to be a light comedy, but the
characters and events are painful and thought-provoking. In THE OBJECT
OF MY AFFECTION, Nina and George are apparently complicated people
deliberately doing things that don't make any sense or might hurt, but
the film tries to brush it off.</P>
<P>I wouldn't mind seeing a re-make of THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION. When
characters are as deep as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL or THE ICE STORM, why not go
for it, and go deep?</P>
