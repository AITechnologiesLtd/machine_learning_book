   The first quarter of any year is bound to be horrendous, film-wise that is. 
January and February drag on into March with nothing but trash after trash
flowing into theatres.  Studios cross their fingers that a certain star or ad
campaign will catch the majority of filmgoers for a fateful weekend to secure
the box-office crown.  Up until Erin Brockovich's March 18 debut, the
theatres were putrid.  But, we finally are starting to see a turn towards the
better, with the summer build-up heading towards full tilt.  On April 14th, a
truly splendid comedy graces its way into theatres.  Keeping the Faith
is similar to 1998's You've Got Mail, but Edward Norton, who directs and
stars, takes Stuart Blumberg's script and produces a romantic comedy that
provides just as many off-beat laughs as it does gushiness.
   Keeping the Faith has a very volatile blend of drama and comedy, such
that it once and awhile detracts from the humorous experience.  The main
premise of Keeping the Faith focuses on the relationship between Father
Brian Finn (Norton), Rabbi Jake Schram (Ben Stiller) and Anna Reilly (Jenna
Elfman).  The trio were best friends during grade school, but were fractured
when Reilly moved away after eighth grade.  Over 15 years later, Anna is
returning to New York for business and the trio is reunited once again. 
Keeping the Faith goes all over the place, but manages to get sensible
laughs no matter where it travels.  Whether it be the differences between
faiths, the hypocrisy of outer-faith relationships or Edward Norton's dead on
Raymond Babbitt (Rain Man) impression, Keeping the Faith gets its
laughs cleanly and whole-heartedly.
   Keeping the Faith opens with Father Brian stumbling down the street,
drunk, and goes to a bar.  Right from the get-go, Norton establishes that this
is a comedy.  Five minutes into the film, he makes fun of the obvious "priest,
rabbi and a women" jokes that never seem to go out of style.  From this point
on, Norton never ventures into serious territory over religion or
relationships, and when he manages to tread the line, he or Ben Stiller manage
to show us the punchline in it all.
   The plot evolves from the union of the trio to the love that the priest and
rabbi share for Anna.  Schram, a rabbi constantly fixed up by his congregation,
is looking for spontaneous love, not a relationship that will just make him
look better to his peers.  Finn, a priest looking to modernize his faith,
finally finds something worth loving; a new faith that he is fully interested
in pursuing.  Through both perspectives, Norton explores what true faith really
is.  And through it all, he maintains a high level of comedy, whether it be the
perfect timing of Ben Stiller, or the off-beat comedy of minor characters like
Don (Ken Leung; Rush Hour) or T-Bone (Brian Anthony Wilson; Snake
Eyes).</P>
<P>The cast is harmonious.  Norton once again displays his versatility, going
from the daring Fight Club to the darling Keeping the Faith.  The
chemistry between himself and Ben Stiller is what keeps Keeping the
Faith on its toes.  Norton is not a veteran comedic actor, but being paired
with uber-comic Stiller let him learn the ropes rather quickly.  Jenna Elfman,
coming off her stellar performance in EDtv (hint: sarcasm), manages to
provide most of the romance in the film, and for the most part, lets Stiller
and Norton get the laughs.  The supporting cast is perfect, with small parts
that lend hardy laughs at key moments.  Seeing Finn pry at Schram in the audio
store got rather tedious, and at this rather dull moment, Don (Leung) makes his
first appearance, chiming away on the karaoke machine.  Keeping the
Faith stays fresh because it throws in comedy at the perfect points
throughout, while still managing to balance out the romance and faith that
ultimately end the film.  The one strong supporting member of the cast with
quite a few scenes is Anne Bancroft (The Graduate).  She lends the
veteran scars to Keeping the Faith and her neurotic role as the rabbi's
mother is delightful, extracting an "Oi Vei" from the audience at the end.
   For all of this praise, Keeping the Faith does have a few minor
detriments.  Clocking in at over 2 hours, Keeping the Faith drags on
while heading into the homestretch.  Romantic comedies are not keen for twist
endings, so watching the montages of each character does get a little tedious. 
Of course, this is the part where faith and love take over for comedy.  This
span of fifteen minutes is the one part where Blumberg forgets about the comedy
that had ruled the film.  This could have been cut down, but despite it,
Keeping the Faith still comes up on top with its charm intact.
   You've Got Mail was delightful, but Keeping the Faith steps
out of the usual path of romantic comedies by providing some all-around humor. 
It may be a great date movie, but I would highly encourage anyone to see
Keeping the Faith that is looking for some great laughs.  With
characters having names like Father, Rabbi and T-Bone, Keeping the Faith
may seem like another cheap piece of comedy, but it is anything but.  Norton
manages to keep his film distinct from any others, and in doing so, reminds the
viewer to KEEP THE FAITH in some diamonds in the rough for the first
quarter of the film year.
Final Verdict: B+</P>
