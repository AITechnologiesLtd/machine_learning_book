<PRE>Message In A Bottle
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Shutting down after a personal tragedy is not an uncommon occurrence. Our
lives are on automatic. We sleepwalk through the day with emotions flatlined.</P>
<P>Some people work through grief and eventually move on. Others cling to the
catastrophe and continue the rest of their days with only memories. Their
present is the past: a comfortable but lonely place to live.</P>
<P>Garret Blake (Kevin Costner) has mourned the death of his wife Catherine for
two years and can't get beyond his guilt of not being the perfect husband.
He's given up on his dreams and writes messages to Catherine, rolled up in
bottles and tossed into the sea.</P>
<P>On a run along the beach, recently divorced Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright
Penn) finds one of his bottles. The words are so poetic and heart-felt that
she has to find the author.</P>
<P>As you might expect, when she does locate him in North Carolina's Outer Banks,
she is instantly captivated and his feelings begin to awaken. (In real life
the odds of it being Kevin Costner are just about as great as an anonymous
emailer turning out to be Meg Ryan.)</P>
<P>The film is infuriatingly uneven. The injured souls' romance is believable and
touching. Their hesitancy in getting involved is poignant. But just when the
story grabs you, it shifts gears.</P>
<P>Theresa's boss and co-workers at the "Chicago Tribune" are dull yet eat up
screen time. Garret's fight with his former in-laws doesn't contribute much.
It feels like padding for an already overly-long film.</P>
<P>One of the biggest sins is a far-too-common plot device. When Theresa first
encounters the man of her dreams, she doesn't tell him the true story of why
they meet. After they become involved, it's too late. She's waiting for the
right moment to confess and, of course, it never comes.</P>
<P>The audience knows that he's going to find out, get angry and leave her. 
Unfortunately the film takes its sweet time getting there and most of the
intervening scenes are lost as viewers anticipate the inevitable.</P>
<P>This film is designed to appeal primarily to women. The bitter-sweet romance
is a tear-jerker with a red sun shimmering in the background against an orange
sunset, sailing ships on the high seas and lovers under a starry sky as
strings swell on the soundtrack. They spend their first few nights in bed just
holding each other. I have it on good authority that women like this kind of stuff.</P>
<P>Oddly enough for one of my particular gender, I usually enjoy "women's films."
However this one has an inexcusable flaw. The ending, out of left field, is
cinematic manipulation at its worst. The filmmakers take a convenient easy way
out just to pull at the heartstrings.</P>
<P>Costner is one of my guilty pleasures, but his character here mostly just
mopes. Penn is difficult to get a grasp on. She plays a strong enticingly
beautiful woman but her habit of leaving sentences unfinished and filling in
with giggles is less than endearing.</P>
<P>Paul Newman as Dodge, Garret's crusty dad, is a treat. The old codger could be
Hank Stamper, his role years ago in "Sometimes A Great Notion", slightly more
mellow and relocated to another coast. Newman and Costner work well as father
and son. Sometimes you'll wish that the movie were about _their_ relationship.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for well over 23 years and as you are
reading this, is probably still sleeping off the Wild Raccoons Party Mardi.
