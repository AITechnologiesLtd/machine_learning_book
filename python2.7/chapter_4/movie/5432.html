<P>In retrospect, I should have seen Mel Gibson's Braveheart when it was
out in theaters. Having failed to do that, however, I finally got
around to renting it a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, seeing this
film on the small screen with a single, little speaker did not produce
the sense of epic grandeur that this film obviously aimed at. After
all, these big budget, star-studded, action-packed period flicks are
all about dressing up, talking funny, and grinding the mad-cow beef of
evil into the mincemeat of justice! (Yes, I've been watching "The
Tick," but I do think that these film epics work with the basic
emotions or not at all.) It's interesting, isn't it, that just having
Mel Gibson in a picture makes it count as "star-studded?"</P>
<P>Braveheart does indeed work on the "basic" emotions, love, anger,
lust, and loathing mostly. William Wallace is an angry young man,
fresh from a tough childhood and tempered by a continental education.
Onscreen, we witness the obligatory childhood traumas that will
explain why Wallace is such an unyielding guy: His father is
treacherously murdered by the English, hung from the rafters of a
barn. After this, we know his life will be dedicated to making life in
Scotland as miserable as possible for the English occupiers. At his
father's funeral, he meets Murron, his future wife. They are both mere
youngsters, but the focus on their brief interaction assures the
viewer they will be together soon. What we aren't shown are his
subsequent travels on the continent with his relatives, where he picks
up French, Latin, and a civilized intellect. Upon returning to
Scotland, Wallace elopes with Murron (to avoid the egregious law
enacted by King Edward that gives the local English noblemen the right
of "first night" with new brides) and professes a desire to raise some
kids and some crops. Fat chance!</P>
<P>Getting the character development out of the way like this did not
provide a very compelling opening for the movie. Basically, almost
every B-grade martial arts flick begins with a similar sequence: The
evil warlord burns down the young man's village, murders his parents
(with an option to rape his sister and shoot his dog), and then waits
20 years for the young man to grow up, master Kung Fu, and come to get
him. Braveheart's developmental sequence is not so trite, but it
shares the property of getting any character motivation fixed early so
that the audience can just sit back and enjoy the kicks, punches, and
witty banter. This is fine for B movies, but I think it is ultimately
counterproductive in Braveheart.</P>
<P>There are other options. You could use flashbacks, or possibly just
have characters refer significantly to past events and let the actors'
reactions speak for themselves. If I recall, Rob Roy used this latter
technique quite well to explain why Rob was so stubbornly honorable.
In any case, the setup makes the rest of the plot feel rather
inevitable - the way events unfold seems relentlessly foreordained,
which becomes annoying during a picture with a three hour runtime.
Wallace is understandably angry when the English murder his doomed
wife, and unswervingly pursues them with an army all the way to York.
Frankly, the simple inflexibility of his character made Wallace's
constant occupation with "freedom" seem more like an idee fixe than a
noble frame of mind. At a guess, I would say that the character of
Wallace was written to be ambiguous: either a zealot the way the
English and Scottish nobles saw him, or a sympathetic patriot the way
the Scottish commoners saw him. It is difficult to play a sympathetic
zealot, however, and I think the problem was that Gibson sometimes
sounded like a zealot while acting like the sensitive, heartthrob
type.</P>
<P>While I'm complaining, I'll just add that I found the handling of
Robert Bruce a bit bothersome too. I appreciate the contrast between
him and Wallace: Wallace's father died early and inspired his son,
whereas Bruce's father clung unnaturally to life (or so it appeared)
and served only to poison his son's spirit. Freud would certainly be
nodding his head knowingly at Bruce's predicament - sons must separate
from their fathers to have a healthy adulthood. But the half-shift in
focus from Wallace to Bruce late in the film was distracting in nearly
inexplicable, at least if you didn't already have some idea of the
role the actual Robert Bruce played in Scottish history. In
Braveheart, Wallace's execution, Christlike, redeems Bruce from his
role as a Scottish Judas and shows him that he must carry on the good
fight. But Bruce's introduction and development are accomplished
somewhat laboriously by simply having the camera follow him around
here and there. When this is finally over, Bruce becomes more
interesting and ultimately extracts himself from the backpocket of
King Edward, changing himself from a leaf in the tide to a leader.</P>
<P>This review does little justice to the good points of the film, but
most other reviews I've seen (and they've been out for a while now
too) do an adequate job of this, so I figured some criticism was in
order. As a spectacle, Braveheart is well executed without being
stagey or treacly, and the battle scenes, I think, epitomize this
quality of the film. But the general lack of depth in the characters
is made too apparent by a conventional development and some
unfocussed, lingering direction. Better to see it on the screen,
perhaps, where you can always enjoy the setting when the pacing
wanders a bit.</P>
