<PRE>The Mask of Zorro (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>Zorro and I have a history.  Whenever I could find Guy Williams in the 
Disney series, his big shoulders swinging the sword to make the fat 
sergeant's pants fall, I watched with fascination.  Here was a show that 
had fun following a formula, that advertised its lack of seriousness.  </P>
<P>The show hooked me on action and adventure, clearing the way for my 
Friday-night addiction to THE WILD, WILD WEST.  As long as I didn't sit 
too close to the set, my parents let me watch as much as I wanted.</P>
<P>THE MASK OF ZORRO wants the audience to enjoy itself, and succeeds in 
most of its purpose.  The film is longish for a story that smacks of 
movie serials;  but enough swordplay, pursuit and explosions pack the 
minutes that the viewing experience is certainly never boring - and only 
slightly repetitive.</P>
<P>As Don Diego de la Vega, Anthony Hopkins wins our regard effortlessly.  
He plays a Zorro who, only a few minutes into the film, communicates the 
essential traits of the character.  Saber blazing, he defeats countless 
Spanish soldiers, rescues peasants whose execution was the bait that 
drew him, and finally, confronts the despicable governor Rafael Montero 
(Stuart Wilson).  Although Zorro escapes to show his familial tenderness 
at home, telling stories to baby Elena and kissing wife Esperanza 
(Julietta Rosen), the gentleman soon loses all that matters to him.  He 
is thrown into a terrible California prison just as Montero returns to 
Spain, accompanied by Don Diego's stolen infant.</P>
<P>The other plot involving injustice and greed centers on a couple of 
Mexican outlaws, the Murieta brothers, and a red-bearded mercenary named 
Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher).  The action has jumped 20 years, 
and fate has thrown together Alejandro Murieta (Antonio Banderas) and 
Don Diego, who has escaped from his dungeon in a manner dreamed up even 
before Alexander Dumas.  It is the classic mentor-apprentice 
relationship:  one of the producers has even described it as Merlin 
teaching Arthur.  Credit goes to the director, Martin Campbell, for not 
spending too much time on the scenes in which the at-first inept 
Alejandro learns the craft from the elder Zorro and then assumes the 
mask himself.</P>
<P>Banderas is the most convincing Zorro yet.  His looks and accent only 
assist his comic timing and physical coordination.  (I confess it was 
hard to tell which was Banderas and which was the stuntman, especially 
in scenes showing Zorro masked.  But Banderas does a good deal of the 
fencing and fighting himself.)  Veteran combatant coach Bob Anderson did 
a masterful job with the male leads, as well as with Catherine 
Zeta-Jones (the adult Elena).  I can envision Banderas returning every 
few years for more slice-'em-up action - another old product remade into 
a franchise.</P>
<P>Technical aspects of THE MASK OF ZORRO are mostly smooth and 
transparent.  The sets are remarkable for their size and accuracy.  Many 
of the colors are probably too brilliant for nineteenth-century textiles 
and paint, but the buildings - and especially the scaffolding of a gold 
mine worked by enslaved peasants and political prisoners - contribute 
much to the storytelling.  The editing also pushes the story ahead 
rapidly.  In fact, very few scenes exist only to develop character.  I 
do not expect to see Elena brushing her hair or Zorro nursing his sore 
muscles;  but I would argue that the film is too tightly edited.  We see 
loads of action (and countless fights between our hero and the same 
baddies), with little connective tissue.  As I write this I remember, 
though, that Martin Campbell is known in part for his action films:  THE 
MASK OF ZORRO even copies the openings and closings of James Bond.  
Zorro swirls his cape and, turning to the audience, carves a burning 
"Z".  </P>
<P>In the end, the film's action has fashioned a tone that is almost 
tongue-in-cheek.  We know the formula;  we've known it since we were 
kids.  Some of the fights are so deliciously over-the-top that they set 
my son and me laughing out loud.  Unlike several recent disappointments, 
THE MASK OF ZORRO works hard but knows when to lighten up.</P>
