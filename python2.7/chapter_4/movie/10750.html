<PRE>STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Writers: Raymond Chandler, Whitfield Cook, and Cenzi Ormonde (based on
the novel by Patricia Highsmith)
Starring: Farley Granger, Robert Walker, Ruth Roman, Leo G. Carroll,
Patricia Hitchcock, Marion Lorne, Howard St. John, Jonathan Hale, Robert
Gist, Laura Elliot</P>
<P>What's amazing about "Strangers on a Train" is not just how absolutely
thrilling it is after all these years, but also how deeply reflective it
is on humanity.  Here's a film which is a classic of the suspense genre,
one that has been copied, parodied, and rehashed ever since its initial
release.  But it's depiction of the murderous and agressive qualities in
man is what makes it even better, what makes it not only a popular film
commercially, but also critically.  Of all the films Hithcock made, this
is one of his absolute masterpieces.</P>
<P>Guy Haines (Farley Granger), a semi-famous and respectable tennis player
and his relationship with the off-kilter rich boy, Bruno Antony (Robert
Walker, who slightly resembled a young Robert Vaughn), is what the
film's focus is on.  Both are passengers on a train one day, and over
the course of a lunch, both open up to the two people they hate the
most: for Guy, it's his present wife, Miriam (Laura Elliot), whom he
wants to divorce so he can marry the daughter of a senator, Anne Morton
(Ruth Roman), but unfortunately she won't let him; for Bruno, it's his
fascist-like father (Jonathan Hale), who treats him horribly.  Bruno
comes up with an unthinkable plan for each to murder the other's object
of hatred because they have no other connection than a coincidental
meeting on a train, but Guy laughs it off, thinking of it as a joke.  A
couple nights later, Bruno stalks Miriam and her friends at a carnival,
and when no one is around, strangled Miriam to death.</P>
<P>Upon learning of this, Guy's initial reaction is to turn Bruno in, but
he has ran into a wall: he has no proof, and he's the chief suspect in
the murder.  In fact, the police have mapped out a way he could have
murdered her and still gotten back home when he did.  Meanwhile, Bruno
still wants Guy to murder his father, and when he refuses, he begins
slowly entering his life, stalking not only him, but his future family,
including the Miriam-looking sister of Anne, Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock
- yes, there's a relation; she's his daughter).</P>
<P>The finale of the film, which clocks in around 25 minutes, is one of the
most carefully constructed, intelligently and deftly tailored finales of
a film I've ever seen, ending in an outrageously visceral ending
involving an out-of-control merry-go-round, which is even more tense
when one discovers that the stunt involving the old man did not involve
any kind of special effects (it's probably the most dangerous stunt of
all time).  The ending is a perfect finish, with an afterthought
containing some extra suspense.</P>
<P>First off, the film is jam-packed with brilliant sequences, cool shots,
and various other suspense sequences that made Hitchcock famous.  The
first one is the beginning, which has no action or anything, but the
dialogue (co-written by none other than Raymond Chandler) is brilliant. 
In the scene, the two discuss the respective people who piss them off
the most, and then Bruno tries to get him to "switch murders."</P>
<P>Two other sequences include a party held by Anne's father (Leo G.
Carroll) where Bruno shows up and ends up in a discussion over how to
murder someone and not have to expound a lot of energy (winding up in a
demonstration how one strangles another); and a scene where Guy journeys
over to Bruno's mansion to kill his father.  Bruno's house is gigantic
and eerily gothic, and the cinematography in this sequence is some of
the creepiest I've ever seen.</P>
<P>But the best sequence, other than the finale, is the one where Bruno
stalks and murders Miriam.  Lasting about 10 minutes or so, it's a
masterpiece in montage, as Bruno has to make sure he follows her but has
to strangle her when none of her friends are around.  Unfortunately,
Bruno is hardly subtle about it, giving himself an eery presence with
his head held down and a hat darkening most of his face (as well as
those eyes he gives).  By the time he finally strangles Miriam to death
(effectively mirrored through her fallen glasses), it's not
anticlimactic but silently frightening.</P>
<P>One of the chief powers of this film lies in the character of Bruno,
who's one of the creepiest and most insane villains to ever grace any
screen.  Instead of being just a cold-hearted bastard, he almost seems
like a harmless little boy, with a gentle presence, resulting in
something which becomes a tad unerving.  Bruno is completely oblivious
to his lack of sanity, most notable in a scene after he kills Miriam
where he approaches and talks to Guy, who is, obviously, appalled at
what he did, but he acts like he did nothing wrong.  He also adds a
touch of homoeroticism, as he seems to attempt to seduce Guy in several
scenes.  Robert Walker's performance is one of the greatest in a
Hitchcock film, if not the best (an observation attributed to AMC host
Nick Clooney).  Unfortunately, Walker died shortly following this film
of "reaction to sedatives."  Too bad; he was just perfect in this film.</P>
<P>The power of this film, though, is its presentation of human beings as
having a murderous and violent nature.  A lot of the characters in this
film, most notably Guy, the one woman at the party, and, of course,
Bruno, who all present different stages of this ailment.  In one scene,
Guy fumes after a heated discussion with his wife that he wishes he
could strangle her, although we know he would never do it.  The woman
giggles along with Bruno in the party scene, but shows an active
interest in the world of murder, but again, she would never do it.  But
Bruno, who seems to have no morals, has no problem with it, and the
chief problem would be getting away with it (or having to do a lot of
work).  The truth is we humans have an interest in murder in general; it
just piques our interest.  Which is probably why Hollywood makes so many
films about them.</P>
<P>But above all, "Strangers on a Train" is a brilliant piece of suspense. 
Hitchcock is at his best with this film, giving us interesting
characters who we care about, a set-up which is fascinating, and
sequences which are intense.  The story, which has been copied many
times (most recently in DeVito's "Throw Momma From the Train"), is not
only a fascinating idea, but an intriguing reflection of our society. 
It's also one of Hitchcock's very best.</P>
