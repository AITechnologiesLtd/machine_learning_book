<P>Why do people always insist on trying to make me like golf? It's like those
folks at weddings who always try to get everyone else to dance, when they
obviously don't want to. Hey man, leave me alone, I don't want to dance and
I don't want to play golf! Feels like a strange "cult-like" thing or
something. When I was in business school, it was all about "you gotta play
golf to mix business with pleasure". When I joined the corporate world, it
was all about "you gotta play golf to suck up to the managers" and even now,
my married friends will come around and say "you gotta play golf man, it's
not as boring as it looks on TV".</P>
<P>Well, I've taken a couple of swings at the ball, never played a real game,
but still don't feel any need to wake up at 6am and club a little white ball
for hours on end. Just not my style. And even though THE FIELD OF DREAMS
actually made me feel like playing baseball, this film STILL was not able to
convince me of any so-called "magic" connected to the game. But maybe I'm
just not holding my driver the right way...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A guy who used to be a great golfer goes to war and loses his touch. He
returns in shame, abandons the girl he loved dearly and drinks himself silly
until a local golf tournament needs him to raise the spirits of the
townspeople. At that point, a figure by the name of Bagger Vance helps the
man regain some of his old self-confidence, take a shot at the tournament
and his old glory.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie wasn't bad but I honestly expected a deeper meaning behind it
all, a bigger inspiration to go out and do something great in my own life,
or in the very least, a little magic. Unfortunately, none of that came
through in this movie, a film which looked great and felt good, but
ultimately didn't say much to me. The acting was solid across the board, but
nobody really stood out. The message of the movie was nice, but nothing to
change your perspective as such. The costumes were beautiful, the décor
authentic and even the golf courses majestic, all perfect accoutrements for
the events unfolding around them, but for me, most of the story seemed
pretty predictable from the start and nothing particularly fantastical or
surprising took me aback during the entire picture. Perhaps the film will
mean more to golf fans. I don't know. Perhaps there is a much greater,
deeper inspirational thought or message that I didn't pick up on. Not sure.</P>
<P>All's I know is that unlike the viewing of an actual game of golf, this film
did not bore me out my skull, and did manage to sustain my attention for its
entire two-hour run, so all in all, not bad. I didn't particularly care for
Will Smith's character, who I thought was a little too "nagging" and "glib"
to be of any inspiration to anyone, but he eventually managed to lighten up,
so no major harm done there. One thing that didn't grow on me was this one
particular continuity issue which just bothered me throughout. If Matt
Damon's character was supposed to have been this great golfer back in the
day, why is it that when he returns to the game all those years later, he is
still decades younger than the top golfers of that time? The fact that
Damon's character was this aged golfer who didn't look a day over 25 just
struck me as very odd and somewhat distracting. Or was that just me? Anyway,
other than that, the film was okay but nothing to go out of your way to see
on the big screen. Catch it on video and see Theron perfect the art of
crying in cinema, Smith finally show a little range as a dramatic character
and Damon, well, he's a good actor but a little too typecast for my taste. A
great looking picture with great looking people, a sad-sack romance, some
dopey lines and a so-so plot line. Interest you any?</P>
