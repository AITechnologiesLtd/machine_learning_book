<PRE>GODZILLA
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It happens every year -- the days get longer, the weather gets 
warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters. 
This year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers, even 
1997's lackluster trio of BATMAN & ROBIN, THE FIFTH ELEMENT and 
THE LOST WORLD. The marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered 
on GODZILLA ("Heeere, lee-zerd, lee-zerd..."), which doesn't make me 
optimistic about future summers. GODZILLA is, of course, based on a 
series of cult movies (translation: really bad movies only a few people 
can tolerate) from Japan that turn up really late at night on Ted 
Turner-owned cable stations. That this big-budget remake won't rise 
above its roots is fairly obvious.</P>
<P>        The credits show us the origin of Godzilla. In five words: 
Nuclear explosion creates giant lizard. Sounds like an Enquirer 
headline, doesn't it? The mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable 
"discovery" sequence. This time, a Japanese guy is eating noodles with 
chopsticks while watching Sumo wrestling (if that ain't a stereotype...) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip. People die.</P>
<P>        Cut to our protagonist, played by Matthew Broderick. He 
makes his first appearance wearing headphones, warbling along to 
"Singin' in the Rain." It's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he 
were in a classier movie. No dice, Bueller. From the beginning, poor 
Matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms 
and stand in Godzilla's enormous footprint. Every disaster movie has 
to have a know-it-all scientist, and this time Broderick is it.</P>
<P>        As the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms (And 
wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card?), 
Broderick is invaluable to the government. He immediately dispels 
Vicki Lewis' theory that Godzilla is a dinosaur because, hey, you can't 
take seriously the intellectual arguments of "Newsradio" cast members. 
Broderick instead hits the nail on the head, announcing Godzilla is a 
radiated lizard. "The radiation isn't an anamoly," he announces, and 
lightning strikes. "I believe this is a mutated abberation," he continues, 
and lightning strikes again. It's vocabulary lightning, you see, 
activated by words of four syllables or more.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, we're introduced to our New York cast, headed 
by an ambitious broadcast journalist (Maria Patillo), Broderick's 
former love. Gee, what are the odds their paths will cross again at a 
dramatically important time? Poor Patillo has been trying to get ahead 
in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless 
anchorman Harry Shearer. Italian cameraman Hank Azaria tells her 
she's not ruthless enough: "Nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town. 
It's dog eat dog."</P>
<P>        Actually, it's lizard eat city, as Godzilla emerges from the 
Atlantic to begin a rampage on the Big Apple's core. The filmmakers 
provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks Godzilla. "I 
think I've got a bite," he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins 
rushing toward him. You can guess what happens next. Similar 
reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city. Hearing the 
rumble of approaching footsteps, one New Yorker remarks, "Please 
don't tell me that's another parade." Please don't tell me that's the best 
line you could come up with.</P>
<P>        Mayor Ebert is not pleased. Played by the principal from 
"Head of the Class," he continually makes the wrong decision when 
given an option, and bickers with his assistant Gene. I guess the 
filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics 
and didn't even bother to kiss ass. The problem is, if you're going to 
attack Siskel and Ebert, you should at least make it funny. Dialogue 
like, "Didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until 
after the election?" followed by, "Back off, Gene," just doesn't work for 
me. Other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the 
Broderick character's last name and Frenchman Jean Reno's inability 
to find a good cup of coffee in New York.</P>
<P>        There's even more fun to be had as GODZILLA progresses. As 
the beast heads back into hiding, Broderick suggests the military lure 
it out with food. Cue twelve dump trucks, all dropping fish into a New 
York intersection. (BRODERICK: That's a lot of fish.) That ambush fails, 
but Broderick soon figures out why Godzilla came to New York by 
buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood 
through them. Yep, Godzilla's with children, which makes you wonder 
just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with 
Godzilla. That's until Broderick explains that Godzilla reproduces 
asexually, like Linda Tripp.</P>
<P>        GODZILLA comes to us from the makers of INDEPENDENCE DAY, 
so it has a lot of dumb action scenes, destructive special effects and 
shallow subplots. Look no further than Patillo's betrayal of Broderick 
(PATILLO: What have I done, Animal? What have I become?) and 
the climactic "Godzilla's nest" sequence in Madison Square Garden. 
The main difference is, INDEPENDENCE DAY was about the experience. It 
had a real global, patriotic element to it, and some genuinely fun 
characters. GODZILLA has lots of rain and lightning, reptilian action 
ripped off from JURASSIC PARK and endless product placement from the 
likes of Kodak, Blockbuster, Juicy Fruit, Swatch, Sprint and Bumble 
Bee Tuna. Yes, Bumble Bee actually paid to be known as the official 
tuna of GODZILLA . That fact alone is twice as interesting as anything 
in the movie.</P>
