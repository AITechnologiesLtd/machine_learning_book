Cast: Ryan Phillippe; Salma Hayek; Mike Myers; Breckin Meyer; Sela Ward;

Hutton 
Director: Mark Christopher 
Screenplay: Mark Christopher<HR>For a movie about disco-era excess, "54" comes up surprisingly short on 
the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s 
Manhattan dance club. Think of it as a sort of "Boogie Nights"-lite - 
where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry 
was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive 
midpoint tone shift, "54" leaves the kinkier details to your 
imagination. It never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter, but 
it thankfully never resorts to preaching, either. In fact, were it not 
for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment, "54" would be 
about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle. </P>
<P>Studio 54 was a haven for the rich, famous and generally good-looking 
before it closed its doors forever in 1986. Inside, anything went and, 
we are told, everything did. The film's fictional main character is 
Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe, the jerky jock from "I Know What You Did 
Last Summer"), a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond 
the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence 
he can only read about in magazines. His wish comes true when Studio 54 
owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one 
night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his 
hideous shirt, of course. </P>
<P>Once inside, Shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex 
and drugs. He has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave, so he 
seeks employment as a busboy. He quickly becomes friends with Greg 
(Breckin Meyer) and Anita (Salma Hayek), a married couple who work along 
side of him; Greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big 
money as a Studio 54 bartender, while Anita checks coats but desires a 
recording contract to call her own. After rubbing elbows (among other 
things) with a renowned socialite (Sela Ward) and gaining the personal 
interest of Rubell, Shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54. 
But fame doesn't come without a price. </P>
<P>"54"'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting 
players - at a slim hour-and-a-half, the film is too short to take on 
such a multi-character focus, and more than a few balls are dropped in 
the resulting juggling act. Alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are 
more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and 
ambiguous interaction, since "54" sometimes feels like it's missing a 
scene here or there. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Shane's 
relationship with soap opera actress Julie Black (Neve Campbell), a 
frequent Studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar. The romance 
is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something 
special. </P>
<P>That "54" works despite these limitations, then, is largely due to the 
competence and energy with which it's assembled. Sure, it's shallow, 
slick, sanitized portrait of a bygone age, and sure, we've seen the 
rags-to-riches story gazillions of times, but debut director and 
screenwriter Mark Christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots 
of the Studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit 
his bouncy vision. The film boasts some fine comic creativity, the 
pinnacle of which is Disco Dottie ("The Wedding Singer"'s Ellen Dow), an 
elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public, but 
slides up to Shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a "funky little 
treat." </P>
<P>The solid, sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the 
film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot. 
Newcomer Phillippe has the charisma and Joisey accent down pat; he and 
Campbell, as fetching as ever, look so good together it's a shame their 
subplot goes nowhere. Meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him 
a delight to watch in "Clueless" (he was the stoner with the 
Joker-smile), while Hayek simply sizzles, especially when leading a 
dance class with the mantra, "One, two, three, attitude!" Sherry 
Stringfield, unidentifiable under big '70s hair, takes on her first 
big-screen gig since she left "ER" as Rubell's accountant, but she's 
criminally underused. </P>
<P>As the droopy-eyed, drug-addled Steve Rubell, Myers is worth the price 
of admission alone. When he's not playing the life of the party, the 
ex-"Saturday Night Live" comedian strips away all of Rubell's confidence 
and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty, unhappy 
life with exorbitance; it's a moment worthy of pity when, while lounging 
on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening, he 
attempts to seduce one of his employees. And while his performance is 
largely serious, Myers mixes the empathy with a delicate "Austin 
Powers"-esque wink, thus keeping consistent with "54"'s overall feel - 
gaudy, larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental, not unlike a giant 
disco ball.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"‘StarGate' is like a film school exercise. Assignment: Conceive of the 
weirdest plot you can think of, and reduce it as quickly as possible to 
action movie cliches. If possible, include sun god Ra, and make sure 
something gets blowed up real good." -Roger Ebert on "StarGate"</P>
