                             LEATHERFACE:
                     TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III
                    A Review in the Public Domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     Any film that includes the quote "I'll be in hell for breakfast" can't be
all bad.  And LEATHERFACE isn't, really, although it certainly isn't all good,
either.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, the Phantom has been at his wits' end recently.
Christmas is always a bad time of year for him, and recently he even resorted
to renting SLEEPING BEAUTY again just to see a film -- any film -- that gives
him the shivers.  (Truthfully, the Phantom has yet to find anyone, himself
included, who isn't scared silly by the Evil Queen.)</P>
<P>     The Phantom should also point out that he although he is a big fan of the
original CHAINSAW, he was rather disappointed with its first sequel.  It just
seemed to trivialize what should have been a continuation of one of the most
terrifying horror films ever made.  Even Dennis Hopper, turning in one of his
most truly lunatic performances, couldn't save it.  So it was with some
trepidation that the Phantom purchased his ticket for part 3.</P>
<P>     LEATHERFACE arrived last week with quite excellent trailers, and the catch
phrase "The most controversial film since..." something or other.  The Phantom
can't quite remember, because although he, like every other horror fan, heard
the rumors about LEATHERFACE's release date being held up pending approval by
the MPAA, he has to admit that the film is resolutely ordinary and not in the
least controversial.  In fact, much of the film plays like the shower scene
from SCARFACE, except without Al Pacino's outrageous Cuban accent.  That is,
although most of the scenes have a violent tone about them, you really see very
little.  In fact, in the Phantom's opinion LEATHERFACE might even have gotten
away with a PG-13, assuming the censors (er, board members) were in a
charitable mood that day, and that they somehow came to believe that a film
about a family of cannibals and chainsaw-wielders required only "parental
guidance."</P>
<P>     More surprisingly, although the title and trailers emphasize Leatherface
and imply that he's Texas's equivalent of Jason, he's really on screen only
about half the time.  The other half is occupied by assorted members of his
creepy family -- a family, you phans may remember, that has been killed several
times over by now.  In fact, the connection between this film and its two
predecessors is not quite clear (except for the clever real-life connection
made by the folks at New Line between a familiar name and the guaranteed box
office receipts it will generate).  There *is* a brief explanation that scrolls
across the screen at the beginning of the film (this explanation is also read
aloud, as if in acknowledgment of the likely handicaps of the film's audience),
but it serves only as an excuse to get things going; really, it's nothing more
than the filmmakers' way of winking at the audience and saying, "We know you
like sequels, you know you like sequels... what do you want us to do, come up
with an original idea or something?"</P>
<P>     The film itself is well directed and edited and is generally suspenseful
throughout.  It's missing some big payoffs -- and if you expect serious,
high-tech, monster gore a la HELLRAISER you'll be disappointed -- but it has
enough little payoffs to make up for its lack of serious violence.  It even has
a few funny moments, although Leatherface will never be another Freddy; since
he doesn't speak, he's limited in the kind of material he can do.  But he's a
little more human than Jason, if that counts for anything.  The Phantom also
appreciated the feelings of tension and dread the film generated.  Although
things don't really get cooking (so to speak) until about half way through, the
beginning of the film is by no means boring or uneventful, and much of the film
is directed in such a way that you never quite know what's going to happen
next.  (The Phantom must admit, however, that he had his beeper turned on
during the film, and that his feelings of tension and dread may therefore have
had more to do with that than with the action on screen.)</P>
<P>     The plot (sans spoilers, of course) will be familiar to anyone who has
seen the original: a handful of happy-go-lucky folks get caught out in the
middle of Texas, lose their way or crash their cars or both, and find that the
woods hold more than just Smokey the Bear.  By the way, those woods have always
intrigued the Phantom; in the original CHAINSAW, they didn't really seem out of
place, although in LEATHERFACE we go from highway to scrub land to forest
awfully quickly.  The Phantom blinked and thought the action had shifted to
Vermont -- it was only the Texas drawls and the fact that the woods weren't
flowing with sap after Leatherface made a few swipes at the trees that made him
realize that no one had left the Lone Star state.</P>
<P>     They meet up with the first family of Texas (no, not the Bushes) and swing
axes, throw rocks, and run away from chainsaws until they finally convene for
dinner.  In fact, there's quite a bit of walking and running in this film, and
there are probably a dozen too many shots of people's legs moving this way and
that.  (Perhaps the producers were hoping for Reebok or Nike to cosponsor the
film, though the only product the Phantom noticed was a can of Diet Pepsi early
on.  Even the fabled chainsaw was generic!  Think of the missed advertising
opportunities here -- Leatherface could even do endorsements at local True
Value hardware stores nationwide...)</P>
<P>     Shortly thereafter some number of them escape (who escapes the Phantom
won't reveal, but suffice it to say that anyone who's ever seen a horror film
before will be able to guess).  Or possibly no one escapes -- the ending is
sufficiently dream-like to allow for the five minutes of concentrated
implausibility that ends the film and, of course, for the requisite sequel.</P>
<P>     That's the Phantom's best guess, anyway.  He thinks that dreams must have
played an important role in the making of LEATHERFACE, for certainly the
producers were under the impression that it might enjoy the mass-market appeal
of the original, and for them to think that implies either that they were
dreaming or that they never bothered to watch the film themselves.</P>
<P>     Still, LEATHERFACE is a fun film and never boring, and especially in this
season of post-Christmas letdowns, with no new horror fix in the foreseeable
future, it's worth a look before it hits your local Blockbusters.  It's a good,
solid, horror film that lacks only in the originality and creativity
departments.  But truthfully, the Phantom doubts that anyone could make a
really good sequel to the original CHAINSAW, and while he wasn't surprised that
LEATHERFACE did little more than reprise its more effective and more successful
predecessor, he will say that it is entertaining enough in its own right to
warrant a look.</P>
<P>     For those phans who like to take their film reviews with a dose of
relativity, the Phantom will say that LEATHERFACE is more enjoyable than either
of Jason's or Michael's most recent flicks, and that it is less stupid than
SHOCKER (though less original and less fun as well).</P>
<P>     But he still likes SLEEPING BEAUTY better....</P>
