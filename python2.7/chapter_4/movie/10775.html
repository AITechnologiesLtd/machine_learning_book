                         OSCAR AND LUCINDA 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               3 :-( :-(  :-(  for the trials of gambling</PRE>
<P>We have a minister (Ralph Fiennes) who is scared of water, addicted to
gambling, a bit of a wimp, a murderer, who wages his girlfriend's
inheritance that he can deliver a glass church to the back yard of the
world (Australia bush), before being seduced by a female vamp and
drowning in the glass church ……and somehow I'm meant to be better off
for having journeyed with this tormented man to his watery grave? Hah.</P>
<P>This product of this Peter Carey novel had me annoyed and bored to tears
from the word gamble. To think that it was a prize-winning novel, had me
convinced that it achieved it's end not so much for what was written,
but how it was written. Yes, this movie is not for the pubescent
adolescent waiting for their first taste of love, not for those in their
twenties looking for true romance or those in their thirties searching
for a spouse. OSCAR AND LUCINDA can be left for the time when the kids
have come and gone, and you can once again afford to walk around the
house naked and contemplate the meaning of what else to do with your
life. Come to think of it everyone in the theatre was either carrying a
frame or a walking stick. This made me feel awkward and strangely out of
place for not having arrived on the same bus from the local retirement
village.</P>
<P>Needless to say, the performances by Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett
are superb, but what is the use of fine performances when the story line
suffers from the angst of poor motivation. We have two
obsessive/compulsive gamblers. One is a woman and the other an Anglican
minister. Oh the dilemma the dilemma is like whether to light another
fag when you are desperately trying to stop smoking. So the minister
bites his nails, twitches nervously trying to water down his tainted
conscience, becomes tormented by his lack of self control which
ultimately results in a fool hardy bet that leads to his death.
Undoubtedly, this man is in dire need of Gambler's anonymous, but I
cannot bring myself to empathise with him. To think the entire situation
could have been easily prevented by a simple ‘I love you' and not by
‘Lets make a bet that I can deliver a glass church to the
outback'.….well annoys the hell out of me.</P>
<P>Full marks to Gillian Armstrong for tight direction, but really the
story line majorly sucks.</P>
