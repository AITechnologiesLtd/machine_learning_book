<PRE>                                   THE SWIMMER
                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<PRE>The Swimmer (1968) 94m. </PRE>
<P>When we first see Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) dive into a pool and
then jump out again he is spry, jovial, and optimistic.  By the time
he has had his last swim he is wading in and hauling himself out, a
broken man.  Director Frank Perry's cult favorite follows Lancaster's
progress from one residential home to another as he plots his route
(on foot) back to his hillside mansion according to the availability
of swimming pools in the area.  Lancaster knows his wealthy neighbors
well, but we soon discover that he has been out of touch for some
time, and that they know something we don't.</P>
<P>Despite our introduction to Lancaster's character, who is full of
compliments and bon homie, we can't help feeling doubtful about him. 
Part of this is due to that fixed, trademark Lancaster grin and his
constant promises and appointments (which mount up until we realize he
can never remember them all), but I believe much of the discomfort we
feel is also due to his appearance.  Dressed only in swimming trunks,
he is exposed to the elements, constantly getting wet and drying off. 
It isn't long before he is footsore and shivering (significantly, the
only time we see him inside a building is when he is showering).  It
appears that Lancaster is stuck halfway - he is baring his physical
self but not his soul.  Does he realize he has a problem?  Perry's use
of light flare and out-of-focus links perpetuate Lancaster's confused
state of mind - his head is in the clouds, as his constant ruminations
about the sky testify; his conversations with people consist almost
wholly of reminiscences.  Interestingly, the moment we associate
Lancaster's reveries with denial, the characters he encounters start
to change.  Initially full of good cheer, they become more hostile
throughout the film's course.  Because the tricky script concentrates
mostly on Lancaster we don't notice that half the people he meets are
probably just as screwed up as he is.  Perry equates the status symbol
of the backyard pool with all the snobbery and foibles of the
nouveau-rich.  They don't want him in their pools / they don't want
him in their social circle.  By the time Lancaster has reached the
public baths at the end of his journey, he has descended into an
overcrowded, overchlorinated hell.  It was a journey he had to make:
he just failed to recognize the real reason.</P>
