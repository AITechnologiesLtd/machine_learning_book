<PRE>THE MATRIX
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        "What is The Matrix?  Unfortunately, no one can tell you what it
is.  You have to see it for yourself."</PRE>
<P>        So preaches a very cool-looking Laurence Fishburne to a befuddled
and bewildered computer hacker played by the equally cool-looking Keanu
Reeves.  That observation serves as an apt commentary on the film itself:
it's better to see "The Matrix" than to have someone describe it to you.
Since it's my job, however, I'm obligated to try.</P>
<P>        Reeves' character (Neo to his online chums) is being "recruited" by
this guy Morpheus (Fishburne) who believes Neo to be The One.  The One who
can save Morpheus' rebel brigade from falling further down the existential
rabbit hole, so to speak.</P>
<P>        The One?  Rabbit holes?  The film is packed to the rafters with
these kinds of allegorical and literary allusions yet, surprisingly, the
end result is a totally original motion picture that grabs you by the
throat and doesn't put you down until the end credits.  It's all very weird
and confusing but it's great looking and moves at such a pace that you
won't notice the anomalies in the pre-programmed realities it stirs up.</P>
<P>        Morpheus and his "ragtag" band of space pirates (think Ridley
Scott's "Alien") are being pursued by Rayban-loving agents who sure look
like Feds but speak so slowly and deliberately (e.g., pronouncing the "n"
in environment) that you suspect they're not what they appear on the
surface.  Fortunately the good guys have this neat ability to travel down
telephone lines the minute danger threatens, as Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss)
ably demonstrates in the film's striking opening sequence.  Fortunately she
knows something about ju-jitsu--and defying gravity--too.</P>
<P>        Trinity finally hooks up with Neo and brings him to Morpheus, where
the psychobabble gets really heavy.</P>
<P>        After choosing a red pill (to learn what The Matrix is) over a blue
one ("you wake up in your apartment not knowing whether or not any of this
really happened"), Neo is reborn in a creepy futuristic world, immersed
cocoon-like in some serious glop, his head shaved and umbilical appendages
attached to almost every part of his quivering, naked body.</P>
<PRE>        Next time, Keanu, take the blue pill.</PRE>
<P>        First the Coens, then the Hughes, next the Farrellys, and now the
Wachowskis--the latest in a successful line of brother-directors keep this
visually stunning sci-fi thriller on the boil for well over two hours,
saturating their palette with dark and dingy hues, only rarely allowing
anything resembling color to engage the senses.  The writing is very smart,
if at times overly arch and occasionally bordering on the portentous, but
Andy and Larry have dreamed up an exhilarating vision in which reality, it
seems, is not what it seems.</P>
<P>        What is The Matrix?  It's a surreal, icky, post-apocalyptic
cyberpunk hacker mind-trip of a movie.  And a very good one at that.</P>
