POLLOCK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>POLLOCK, about the renowned and controversial modern artist Jackson 
Pollock, is at once intriguing and insightful as well as boring and 
baffling.  Ed Harris, who stars as Pollock, makes his directorial debut 
with the film.  Although clearly a labor of love on Harris's part, the 
film amply demonstrates why most actors need someone other than 
themselves giving them guidance.  Harris delivers one of his best 
performances, indeed, another Oscar worthy one, but his director spoils 
what could have been a masterpiece by letting scenes drag on and on.</P>
<P>Still, for anyone interested in the creative process, the movie can be 
quite rewarding.  It is difficult to show exactly how an artist goes 
from a blank canvas to a fully realized vision.  POLLOCK tries by simply 
letting us observe Pollock at work.  With the intense performance by 
Harris as a troubled artist, the creative tension is almost palpable.</P>
<P>Suggesting a Van Gogh-like relationship between art and madness, the 
story paints a picture of Pollock as an alcoholic who received a 4F in 
World War II because he was "too neurotic."  Acting like a 
manic-depressive, Harris portrays Pollock as a troubled soul.  Drinking 
from morning till night, with the exception of one two-year bout of 
sobriety, Pollock is a walking time bomb.  That he was able to create 
anything memorable through that alcoholic haze is quite surprising.  </P>
<P>One well-staged drinking-and-driving episode best illustrates the depth 
of Pollock's troubles.  As he bikes back from the local grocer, having 
swapped a painting to pay his debt and buy a new case of beer, he can't 
wait until he gets home to pop open another cold one.  Inebriated, he 
tries to hold the case on his handlebars while opening a beer.  Weaving 
in the road, he crashes, losing all of his precious brew to the hot 
asphalt.</P>
<P>Pollock accidentally discovers his signature style of drizzling and 
flinging the paint.  Spilling paint on the floor, he likes what he sees 
and decides never to touch the brush to the canvas again.  Although his 
work was frequently criticized as consisting of little more than random 
splashes, Pollock defends his technique.  "I don't use the accident, 
because I deny the accident," he says during an interview.</P>
<P>A genius when it came to paint, the sullen Pollock is awkward and 
insecure when communicating with fellow humans, probably because of his 
years of boozing, although an argument could be made that it was the 
other way round.  Perhaps he hated human interaction so much that he 
resorted to drinking as a fast means of escape.</P>
<P>Basically a one-man show, it does have many other characters in 
complementary roles.  Marcia Gay Harden (SPACE COWBOYS) plays fellow 
artist Lee Krasner, who takes Pollock in as she might a wounded puppy.  
Nurturing him with motherly advice and support, she eventually demands 
to be his wife.  He agrees but flaunts his subsequent infidelity.  
Towards the end of the picture, Jennifer Connelly, who was so 
spectacular recently in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, plays another of her more 
typical throwaway roles as the beautiful but vapid Ruth Klingman, the 
last of Pollock's mistresses.  Amy Madigan, Harris's wife, looks plump, 
old and pasty as Peggy Guggenheim, Pollock's first patron.</P>
<P>Luck is shown to be the key difference between obscurity and fame.  Only 
after Pollock happens to be featured in a Life magazine article is his 
genius recognized and his poverty transformed into wealth.</P>
<P>Is POLLOCK a beautiful failure or a flawed success?  Like his paintings, 
it is in the eye of the beholder.  For me, it was better than a 
documentary on the History Channel and well worth seeing.  In an 
unsympathetic and enigmatic performance, Harris creates a fascinating, 
flawed man of flesh and blood, who throws temper tantrums like a toddler 
one minute and acts like a recluse the next.  If you can stay awake 
through the long dull periods, you will learn a lot and get to witness 
one of the best performances of the year in the process.</P>
<P>POLLOCK runs 2:02.  It is rated R for language and brief sexuality and 
would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
