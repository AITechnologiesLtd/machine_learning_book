<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Perfect casting has never been a problem for Jim Carrey. Who else could have 
made The Mask believable and fun? What type of person would Truman Burbank 
have been without him? He has approached all of his latest roles with energy, 
and there is no exception here. Whatever material the Farrelly brothers hand 
him, whether itâ^À^Ùs golden laugh-out-loud comedy or gross-out trash, he 
delivers it with vigor. Perhaps he is a little too full of energy for his 
own, and this movie's good. This is the role Carrey seemed born to play and 
he fits it perfectly. He is so good itâ^À^Ùs scary. The script, however, is 
frightening for other reasons. </P>
<P>Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey) is a peaceable Rhode Island state trooper 
that's constantly taken advantage of by everyone around him. His wife sleeps 
with an African American midget on their wedding day, and later produces 
three large, black genius sons. He doesnâ^À^Ùt seem to care the whole town is 
laughing at him behind his back. After a day of unusually tough verbal abuse, 
Charlie cracks revealing Hank. Hank is the complete opposite of Charlie. Hank 
likes to fight, is less than a gentleman to women, and wreaks havoc wherever 
he goes. Doctors determine that Charlie has schizophrenia, and give him 
medication to control the problem. Irene (Renee Zellweger), a golf course 
manager, is a young woman that gets sent to jail unawares of her boyfriendâ^À^Ùs 
illegal conduct he has involved her in. Charlie must escort her to a New York 
jail. Before leaving, Charlie forgets to grab his medication. As both of his 
personalities begin to fall for Irene, Charlie must win the battle between 
Hank and himself before he loses Irene for good.</P>
<P>The Farrelly brothers are famous for their work on Dumb and Dumber and 
Thereâ^À^Ùs Something About Mary. In interviews they have tried to evaporate 
their title of the gross-out kings of comedy by saying things like, â^À^ÜWhat is 
gross? We do everything only to be funny.â^À^Ý Not to be too graphic, but I do 
not find a thirty second shot of a chicken shoved up a manâ^À^Ùs behind at all 
humorous. This type of shocking humor is copious. As the film continues, it 
becomes so abundant that it just isn't funny anymore. An early scene 
involving a cow that just will not die will have animal activists screaming, 
and will have everyone else screaming with laughter. Charlieâ^À^Ùs three black 
sons (flawlessly performed by Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod 
Mixon) are the only things regularly funny in this movie. The rest crosses 
the line of good taste too often. The Farrelly brothers have the wrong 
approach to making people laugh. When they did the hair-raising hair gel 
scene in Mary, it was outrageous because it came out of nowhere. With this 
movie, we expect the gross humor. Therefore, it isnâ^À^Ùt nearly as hilarious or 
shocking when performed. </P>
<P>The romance fails too. Perhaps the offscreen chemistry between Carrey and 
Zellweger is good, but their onscreen work is horrible. Irene doesnâ^À^Ùt match 
the Charlie/Hank character, and the screenplay robs Zellweger of any comic 
opportunities. She tries to be her usual exuberant and shining female 
character, but the script works against her. Supporting performances from 
Robert Forster and American Beautyâ^À^Ùs Chris Cooper do nothing to help the 
film. Me, Myself & Irene is about a half hour too long for all of the above 
reasons. The romance moves along at an unhurried pace, while the comedy wants 
to move faster.</P>
<P>Even if the Farrellyâ^À^Ùs borrow much from their two previous films, they do one 
thing here that is genuinely interesting and original. Stay for the credits, 
and youâ^À^Ùll see the name of every single extra that worked on the film, as 
well as a picture of the place they appeared in the movie. This is certainly 
an intriguing concept, one that is far more interesting than this shocking, 
yet bland movie.</P>
