<PRE>CITY OF ANGELS
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I've said it before and I'll probably have to say it again -- I just 
don't buy the Hollywood theory that the biggest desire of angels is to 
be human. There's no bigger proponent of this idea than CITY OF 
ANGELS, which has a climactic, humanist speech from Nicolas Cage 
along the lines of, "I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one 
kiss from her mouth, than eternity without it. One." Meanwhile, I'm 
thinking, "Yeah, Meg Ryan is cute, but come on, no one would give up 
an eternity in heaven for her."</P>
<P>        Obviously, this Less is More philosophy carried over to the 
script, written by Dana Stevens. The idea seems to be that a moviegoer 
would rather see one rehashed plot, one oversentimentalized method of 
acting, than a fresh, unconventional movie. One, which is also the 
number of scenes in CITY OF ANGELS that really engaged me. Shame, 
because the early pieces of Brad Silberling's direction, which show 
lengthy aerial shots of black trenchcoated angels perched on Los 
Angeles architecture, suggested an artistic movie that would actually 
explore the life of the angel.</P>
<P>        Instead, we get a love story. The human protagonist is a 
doctor (Ryan) who loses one of her patients at the beginning of the 
film. We already know, from one overly melodramatic child death 
scene, that angel Cage just hangs around, waiting for people to die. 
Then he walks them to The Other Side, after they've told him what 
they enjoyed most about life. After that, he compares responses with 
his closest angel friend, played by Andre Braugher, in his most 
subdued role ever.</P>
<P>        So Cage catches a glimpse of Ryan at work, then stares her 
down as she cries over the dead patient. That's more or less what these 
movie angels do, just stare at humans, with a creepy demeanor that 
suggests some kind of stalker-pervert. That they all wear trenchcoats 
doesn't help their credibility. Anyway, Cage finds himself smitten with 
Meg and decides to let him get a look at her because, as Braugher 
says, "people can see you if you want them to."</P>
<P>        They flirt for awhile, Ryan thinking he's a friend of the heart 
patient (Dennis Franz) she's going to operate on tomorrow. Then Cage 
disappears mysteriously, reappears, disappears, and so on, until we 
find out Meg is in love with him. It's when she starts coming up with 
questions like, "Why does he wear the same clothes all the time?" that 
things get tedious. At the same time, Cage starts wanting to forsake 
his angelic existence to be with Meg.</P>
<P>        He gets the idea from Franz, whose character's name is 
Nathaniel Messinger. It's about the most obvious name for an ex-
angel, although I'd hate to think my guardian angel looks like Denniz 
Franz. Hell, it's hard enough to swallow the idea of Cage as an angel. 
Rest assured, though, that since this is a movie, Cage will let his lusts 
dictate a fall from heaven. I just didn't think the filmmakers would do 
something so laughable as having Cage dive off a high building. 
Here's a hint, you guys: it's supposed to be a figurative fall, not a literal 
one. But the good news is Cage's black trenchcoat DOES fall with him.</P>
<P>        I won't give away the ending, except to say it's the most 
cheesy, formulaic, pseudo-ironic ending possible in a movie like this, 
and one that would inspire Nicolas Cage to say, "I would rather have 
had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, than eternity 
without it." Personally, I would rather have had a good script, genuine 
acting and direction that didn't rely on lingering shots and sappy 
orchestration. A movie like this sure isn't going to make a real angel 
fall from heaven, unless he falls over laughing.</P>
